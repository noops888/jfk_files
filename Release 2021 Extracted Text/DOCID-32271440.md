Biography

This

section should go often a brief.

intro to the outline of Elenair

story.

Elena Garro de Paz was born of Spanish parents in

Puebla, Mexico on December 11, 1917. Ms. Garro attended

the National Autonomous University of Mexico and later

did graduate work at Berkley in California and at the

University of Paris. In 1963, Elena had long been married

to Octavio Paz, a career diplomat who is also one of

Mexico's finest poets and leading intellectuals. When

Octavia was named Mexican Ambassador to India, the couple

separated by mutual consent. Elena's daughter, also

named Elena, has always resided with her mother.

•Since Elena spent seventeen years of her early

life in Europe she had a rather un-Mexican objectivity

about her native land and had a reputation for being one

if its more articulate detractors. At the same time, Elena

was considered emotionally committed to many aspects of

Mexican life and made an important contribution to its

artistic development.

In the 1960's Elena became a significant writer.

Hogar Solido, El' Rey Mago, La Senora en su Balcon, Ventura

Allende, Andaise por las Ramas, Parada Empresa, and El Viaje

are plays that have had appreciative audiences in Europe,

where they were translated into German, as well as in Mexico.

Ms. Garro's short stories are collected in a volume called

La Semana de Colores.

The Literacy Supplement of the London

Times has called her novel, Los Recuerdos de Porvenir, "a

people who knew Elena have asserted that the frontier

between reality and fantasy is also difficult for her to

Ms. Garro, for many years, was an active worker in

the Confederacion Nacional Campisina (CNC), the agrarian

arm of the Partido Reformista (PRI). Because Ms. Garro

was a tireless propagandist and agitator on behalf of the

poorer Mexican peasants, she was on close personal terms

with and enjoyed the respect of peasant leaders from all

over the country

(ib.1)

Elena was considered a witty, urbane and opinionated

woman with an unflagging sense of humor. Her forthright

opinions and sharp wit tended on occasion to ruffle feathers

in Mexico, but her important social, literacy, and political

connections rendered her fairly immune from serious counter-

attack until 1968. Then, Ms. Garro was forced to flee the

country with her daughter, Elenita and her sister, Deba

Before her disappearance from Mexico, Elena was

well disposed toward the United States and had been

friendly with Embassy officers. Her broad range of signifi-

American Embassy, made her a useful Embassy target.

The Garro's claimed that they had recognized Oswald's

photograph when it was published after the assassination.

The arrest of Silvia Duran "underlined their certainty"

that the man had been Oswald. (IBID.)

Deba added that Lynn and one of the Duran brothers

had made trips to Texas. She also said that, even though

they were always poor before the

assassination, they were

both driving expensive new cars. A notation on the memo

He was apparently quite smitten with the

Ta further investigate Ms. Garro's story,,the Federal

Bureau interviewed Ario Alejandro Lavagnini Stenius on

November 27, 1964. (IBIDe) Lavagnini recalled that there

were approximately thirty people at the Ruban Duran party,

few of whom he knew.

He recalled having met a Mexican girl

who had recently returned from living in France. He was

unable to fix the date of the party, but felt it was

probably early in September because of a heavy rain which

occurred as they were leaving the party about 2:00 a.m.

(IBID. p. 4)

Lavagnini noted no Americans present at this party.

He was familiar with the appearance of Lee Harvey Oswald

because of publicity following the assassination of President

Kennedy but otherwise had no knowledge of him and had never

seen him except for news photographs following the assassina-

tion, (IBID. p. 4)

On 12/10/65 Charles Thomas, a political officer

at the American Embassy, wrote a memorandum about a

conversation with Elena Garro de Paz. (CIA #586-587,

her by telling her that the American Embassy was full

where they were "protected" by Governor Lopez Arias.

She said that Ruben Duran, reportedly "protected" by

General Clark Flores, was very prosperous and was driving

She stated that the party had been at Ruben Duran's

home.

She was unclear about the date of the party. It

was a few days before the Soviet istronaut, Gagarin,

visited Mexico; she thought that this would put the party

around September 2 or 3, 1963.

She believed that the party

was on a Monday or Tuesday because it was an odd night for

a party. The memo noted that September 1 and 2 were

indeed a Monday and Tuesday. Elena could not check her.

because the calender was

During the conversation, Elena described Oswald

and his companions. The man who she thought was Oswald

wore a black

sweater. She said he was quiet "and stared a

lot at the floor." One of his companions "was very tall

and slender and had long blond hair which hung across his

forehead. He had a gaunt face and a rather long protruding

chin." The other companion was also tall, with short,

light brown hair and no really distinguishing characteristics.

The three Americans did not dance or mix with the other

guests. Elena saw the same three men on the street the

next day. (IBID.)

A note fached to this cable by Allen White stated

"I don't know what FBI did in Nov 64, but the Garro's

no pictures is reasonable since Elena claimed that the

the Cuban Embassy was not normally photographically

surveilled; and 2.) the "disturbance" occured inside the

Ambassador regarding the Garros allegations. (Memo from

Legat to Ambassador, 2/23/66, CIA #571; WX-7241 Entry #455,

p. 95, CIA #722.) This memo reports that "extensive investi-

Mexico prior to September 26, 1963 and that no information

had developed that would show that he had not been in

New Orleans in the early part of that month. The memo

repeated that no further action was being taken by the

FBI because her allegations had not been substantiated.

(IBID.) A marginal comment by this entry in WX-7241 says,

basis for Elena's reporting." (IBID; referenced to

office in response wrote that Alan White from the CIA had

indicated that he was aware of Elena's unreliability.

The Legat's office further wrote that the concept that

to review and evaluate the action taken by that agency

is, of course, untenable. (IBID.)
