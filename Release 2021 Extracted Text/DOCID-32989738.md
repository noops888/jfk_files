FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATIQN

Date of transcription 8/4/78

NIC. HOWARD C. KENNEDY resides at 55 Harneywold Drive,

Ferguson, Missouri 63136, residence telephone number (314)

521-8221.

Mr. KENNEDY is presently self-employed as a private

investigator and polygraph examiner.

He retired from FBI

service on February 28, 1977. Prior to his retirement he

was assigned to the St. Louis Division of the FBI fIom 1954

to the date of his retirement. During 1974 he was assigned

to general criminal matters and worked as a Special Agent

under the supervision of Field Supervisor ROBERT I. BENDER.

HI. KEINEDY's recollection was refreshed regarding an

interview with him at the FBI Office in St. Iouis, Missouri,

on July 28, 1273, by SAC ROY B. KLAGER, JR., concerning a

closed St. Louis file 137-16185; nore specifically, serial 5

of that file. Mr. KENNEDY recalled having read this serial

in detail.

He further recalled earlier discussion on July 28,

1978, concerning a notation appearing on the above serial

which states,

"Notify locals of info re killing", and his

earlier reply that in his recollection this comment pertained

to a matter appearing on page 2 of the memorandum and unrelated

to the MARIIN LUTHER KING information.

Mr. KENNEDY was asked if he did in fact disseminate the

information in keeping with the above-cited handwritten

notation.

He related that he recalls with reasonable certainty

that he did disseminate the information appearing on page 2

to someone in the St. Louis Police Department whose identity

he does not now recall.

Mr. KENNEDY called further attention to the last paragraph

of page 3 of the memorandum in question which refers to another

killing, unrelated to the MARTIN LUTHER KING matter.

volunteered that this additional unrelated information vas also

disseminated, io the best of his recollection, to the St. Louis

Police Depariment; however, he similarly does

not recall to

whom this information was given.

8/4/78

Attention is directed to two FD-302s in this file,

reflecting interviews conducted on 7/23/73 and 8/4/78,

respectively, by me, of former SA HOWARD C. KENNEDY.

Particular attention is directed to the interview with

KENNEDY on 8/4/78 as it pertains to dissemination of

informacion by him, which information is reflected in

serial 5 of St. Louis file 137-16185.

In this interview

of 8/4/73, KENNEDY stated that he recalls with reasonable

certainty that certain information was disschinated by him

to the St. Louis Police Department.

In order to document such dissemination, this is to

record that I personally searched our dissemination control

file, 66-2340, for the months of April through July of 1974

and

found no rocord of such dissemination having been made.

It should be noted that the volume of 66-2340 for the

month of March, 1974, and prior months are no longer maintained

as they have been destroyed under the file destruction program.

There is no FD-159 (dissemination form) concerning this

matter contained in 137-16185 or the related file 87-21859.

Beyond that, the purpose of

This female then stated that she was

alone in the art gallery, but was able to reach

O'HARA by telephone.

She did

so, and the interviewing

agent spoke with O'HARA. Again, since this contact

was by telephone, O'HARA was informed only as the

female was informed above. The interviewing

agent and O'HARA agree to meet the following day.

The following day, 7/28/78, the inter-

viewing agent went to O'HARA's above gallery.

A man claiming to be O'HARA came to the door of

the gallery and refused to acmit the agent to

the gallery.

Thereafter that day, the interviewing

JALOVEC to be present while the agent presented

O'HARA with certain papers which would

inform

O'HARA of the matters set forth in referenced

teletype.

Thereafter, O'HARA would have the

option of responding to the interviewing agent

and of discussing the matter with his attorney.

This meeting was arranged for the

PURPOSE:

To furnish information regarding captioned

Committee's efforts to gain access to Memphis Field Office

files of five (5) former informants and to recommend, in

accordance with a decision by the Department of Justice,

that excised copies of these files be made available only

to the HSCA's Chief Counsel and Director.

SYNOPSIS: The HSCA is trying to resolve allegation that

FBI informants reporting on the Invaders, a Memphis youth

gang, acted as "agent provocateurs" in instigating violence,

causing King to return to Memphis where he was killed.

SCA

requested access to FBI Headquarters (FBIHQ) files on five

informants reporting on Invaders.

This access was granted

to HSCA Chief Counsel and Director only as effort to

compromise with HSCA and assist in resolving allegation.

HSCA then requested access to Memphis Field Office files

on the same informants.

This request was denied in Director

letter to Congressman Stokes, Chairman, HSCA, (copy attached)

primarily because it would be detrimental to our informant

development program.

By letter to the Attorney General from

BY

HSCA Chairman dated 7/5/78 (copy attached), a meeting with

UNGLAS

the Attorney General was requested to resolve the issues.

Mr. Robert I. Keuch, Assistant Attorney General, stated HSCA

available.

Memorandum to Mr. Bassett

RE:

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (SCA)

why files should not be made available were informally

provided him and are outlined in this memorandum. On

7/27/78, Mr. Keuch stated our arguments

are persuasive,

but he still believed the decision in his letter of 7/24/78

was the best course of action in this matter.

However,

he desired to use our arguments in responding to

Congressman Stokes' letter and asked this information be

furnished him on a formal basis.

Mr. Keuch has determined

that our action in this matter will have no bearing on the

Socialist Workers Party litigation in New York. The

Congressional Inquiry Unit (CIU) believes that since copies

of these files will be excised to prevent compromise of

informants' identities, we should agree with Mr. Keuch's

position and make files available.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. That we follow the decision of Mr. Keuch in

making excised copies of these informant 'files available to

the HSCA's Chief Counsel and Director only.

Memorandum to Mr. Bassett

RE:

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (SCA)

DETAILS: By letter to the Attorney General dated 4/12/78,

the HSCA reguested access to files on our informants

within the Invaders, a Memphis youth gang. This request

was apparently made after a review of the

FBIHQ which disclosed the Memphis Office had five informants

who were providing coverage of that organization.

eage of the

Invaders file at

Mr. G. Robert

Blakey, Chief Counsel and Director, HSCA, had advised Legal

Counsel Division that the HSCA is trying to resolve whether

or not the Invaders fomented racial violence to get King to

return from Atlanta to Memphis where he was killed and to

determine if

"any of these informants acted as "agent

provocateurs" in starting this violence.

None of the five informants involved are currently

active.

Only one informant actually became a member of the

Invaders and that was not until after King's assassination.

Memphis files on these informants total 47

sections.

By Mr. Ryan to Mr. Bassett memorandum dated

4/27/78, it was approved to release FBIHQ files on

these

informants with all informant identifying data excised.

It

was hoped these files would satisfy the HSCA

that informants

were not responsible for violence.

This action was taken

primarily as a

"compromise" to demonstrate cooperation with

the Committee.

Any additional efforts by the HSCA to review

field office files of the informants or to determine informant

identities would be opposed.

Access to FBIHQ informant files

was limited to Mr. Blakey, since some staff members were

familiar with substantive file on the Invaders and to allow

staff access could jeopardize informants' identities.

As reported in Mr. Ryan to Mr. Bassett memorandum

dated 5/19/78, Mr. Blakey reviewed excised copies of all

five FBIHQ informant files on 5/17/78, in the presence of

two Agents of the CIU.

Following a review, Mr. Blakey stated

he found no evidence that any of our informants acted as

"agent provocateurs." He furnished FBIHQ 15 pages of notes

which he took during review and desired these notes be kept

at FBIHQ for possible later use in constructing a paragraph

in the final HSCA report to the effect that he found no

evidence that any of these informants instigated violence.

Following this review, Mr. Blakey made no verbal request that

field office files of these informants would be needed.

Memorandum to Mr. Bassett

RE:

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (HSCA)

By letter to the Attorney General dated 5/23/78,

Mr. Blakey requested access to Memphis Field Office files of

these same five informants.

This letter stated that the

procedure used for review of FBIHQ files was unacceptable and

contrary to the Memorandum of Understanding, but could be

utilized again.

In response to this request, a letter from the Director

to Congressman Louis B. Stokes, Chairman, HSCA, dated 6/13/78,

was sent denying access to these files.

A copy of this

letter and the

letter transmitting it to the Department of

Justice are attached to this memorandum. Our denial was based

primarily on the overall detrimental effect this access could

have on our informant development program and, as this letter

pointed out, the lives and safety of our informants could

be placed in jeopardy.

This letter also stated that our

decision to make the FBIHQ informant files available was

meant to serve as a precedent for the HSCA to request field

office files for the same informants. Mr. Robert I. Keuch,

Deputy Assistant Attorney General, concurred with our position

in the absence

of additional information from the HSCA bearing

on the allegation that our informants acted as "agent

provocateurs" in instigating the violence in Memphis.

On 7/11/78, representatives of the CIU and Legal

furnished a copy of a letter from Congressman Stokes to the

Attorney General dated 7/5/78. A copy of this letter is

attached to this memorandum. This letter sets out in detail

the basis on which the HSCA

feels it has for requesting access

to informant field office files.

This letter appealed to the

Attorney General to resolve the matter of the informant files

and requested a meeting with the Attorney General to discuss

the issues involved.

Mr. Keuch advised that the HSCA was

prepared to subpoena these files.

In his opinion, Mr. Keuch

believed the Department would lose a court decision over

the files and it would be in the Bureau's best interest

to comply with the HSCA request of 5/23/78 and allow access.

Mr. Keuch believed the letter from Congressman Stokes

contained additional information bearing

on the allegation

against the Bureau in that the Committee's own investigation

Memorandum to Mr. Bassett

RE:

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (HSCA)

had established a need to review the field office informant

Illes and the request was not based on irresponsible allegations.

Mr. Keuch requested that the FBI reexamine its position and

advise if the files could be made available to Mr. Blakey

only.

On 7/13/78, Mr. Keuch advised that if files were

not forthcoming, the HSCA planned to issue a subpoena for

them, an action

to commence 7/17/78.

At a meeting with representatives of the CIU,

Mr. Bassett and Mr. Bailey on 7/13/78, Mr. McDermott

directed that all five informants be contacted to determine

if they have any objections to their identities being disclosed

to the HSCA. If any did not object, then a signed waiver

would be obtained authorizing release of their files to the

HSCA.

Subsequent to the meeting, Mr. Keuch was telephonically

advised of this action.

On 7/17/78 and 7/18/78, the field advised that

all

five informants had been contacted and refused to allow

their identities to be disclosed

I to the HSCA. On 7/18/78,

Mr.

Keuch was telephonically advised that all five informants

objected to their identities being disclosed to the HSCA.

By letter to the Director dated 7/24/78 (copy attached),

Mr.

Keuch outlined the basis which he, as Special Counsel to.

the Attorney General, believed that excised copies of these

informant files should be made available to the HSCA. In his

opinion, Mr. Keuch believes the HSCA's legislative

and

investigative needs for the files are not based on "pure

speculation and/or naked allegations"; that the Committee

will issue subpoenas for the files and if we lost a court

decision regarding subpoenas, access would be broadened

and informants' identities could be disclosed; the nature of

the Committee is "that the Bureau and Department of Justice

are targets or subjects of the investigation" and we are

obligated to be as cooperative as possible; and, that "if

and

when we reach the ultimate confrontation over the possible

disclosure of informants" our position will be strengthened

by taking cooperative steps consistent with our needs to

protect informants' identities.

Memorandum to Mr. Bassett

RE:

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (HSCA)

Subsequent to receipt of this letter, Mr. Keuch

was informally furnished by the CIU a list of points against

making these files available to the HSCA. These points

were derived as results of discussions by interested

divisions at FBIHQ and a review of Congressman Stokes'

letter to the Attorney General dated 7/5/78.

While it was

believed Mr. Keuch's position in this matter is sound, we

also desired he be made aware of our arguments in opposition

to making these informant files available.

These points

given to Mr. Keuch informally are as follows:

As stated in our letter to Congressman Stokes

dated 6/13/78, if it becomes general knowledge that FBI

informant files are being opened

to outside parties, informant

privilege is threatened

and our informant development

program can be severely hampered. Despite the HSCA's statement

in the letter from Congressman Stokes that it is not seeking

the informants' identities at this time, this is not the

central issue in point. The central issue is the principle

of opening a field office informant file to outside parties.

The HSCA was provided access to_ FBIHQ files

concerning informants who reported on the Invaders.

Although the HSCA feels these were administrative in

nature, the policy of the bureau at that time required that

all information of a substantive nature be furnished to FBIHe•

Data such

as informant's travel, amount of payments and a

summary of background material are examples of such infor-

mation provided to FBIHQ.

Therefore, FBIHQ feels that its

files contain significant information concerning the operation

of any informant.

3. All information of substance concerning the

Invaders organization furnished by these informants would be

reported in the Invaders file at FBIHQ.

The HSCA has had

access to this file since December, 1977. The HSCA has

shown no interest in reviewing the Memphis Field Office

file concerning the Invaders, a file which would contain

all reports from informants covering the Invaders.

It

would appear logical to examine this file in detail prior

to pressing for files of informants, none of whom were

even

members of the Invaders at the time of or prior to

King's assassination.

RE:

HOUSE

SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (HSCA)

4. Review of FBIHQ informant files was restricted

to Mr. G. Robert Blakey, Chief Counsel and Director, HSCA,

and not to his staff because, since the staff had access

to the Invaders file at FBIHl, their knowledge of the

organization could possibly result in identification of

informants through a cross checking of the files. Subsequent

to Mr. Blakey's review of the informant files, the FBIHQ

Invaders file was delivered to the HSCA on 7/6/78. NoW

Mr. Blakey himself has access to the substantive Invaders

file, and

similarly, his possible new knowledge could result

in source identification if allowed access to field office

files.

5.

On 7/17/78 and 7/18/78, all five informants

were contacted to determine if they would permit disclosure

of their identification to the HSCA. All declined.

6.

Following his review of FBIHQ files on

5/19/78, Mr. Blakey told agents present that he found

no evidence that any of our informants acted as "agent

provocateurs. "

He furnished notes taken during his review

to FBIHQ and

requested the notes be maintained by the FBI

for possible future use in writing into his final report a

paragraph to the effect he had found no evidence that any of

these informants had instigated violence.

He made no request

at that time to review field office informant files. It is

possible that Mr. Blakey is satisfied with the review of

FBIHQ informant files.

7. The FBI desires to maintain consistency

with regard

to our position in this matter. In our letter

to Congressman Stokes dated 6/13/78, access to these

files was denied.

position 6/13/18, decided

This position was decided upon after

careful deliberation between interested divisions in the

FBI and in our view the HSCA has provided no basis to cause

a change of this position.

8. Providing the HSCA access to field office

informant files, although excised, could serve as an

undesirable precedent for other outside groups to review

such files.

9. Because of the large number of excisions

in these files to protect the identities of informants,

it is unlikely the HSCA will be satisfied with its review,

if granted. It will probably ask for fewer excisions and/

or the identities of the informants.

Memorandum to Mr. Bassett

RE :

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (HSCA)

10. Finally, the letter from Congressman

Stokes dated 7/5/78, has been analyzed at FBIHQ and,

generally, it is not believed it contains additional infor-

mation giving substance to the allegation that our informants

acted as "agent provocateurs."

Specifically, the following

points are noted:

a. The letter states (pages 1 and 4) that the

HSCA had access to relevant Bureau personnel and has

conducted extensive interview among those who may also

be subjects of this aspect of the

Committee's investigation.

The Committee claims need to review the files to determine if

the written record supports or refutes the oral testimony

on the relevant questions.

However, the letter offers

no specific results of interviews of personnel or

others concerning

the basic allegation.

It has not identified

any specific individual who has furnished information

bearing on this allegation.

b. The letter states (page 4) that based on

field interviews with former members of the Invaders and

people present in Memphis at the time of the march, the

"Invaders were in fact a proximate cause of the violence."

This is not new information.

The FBIHQ file concerning the

Invaders, media reports issued

then and more recently verifies

the Invaders culpability regarding violence during the march.

The letter also states

(page 4) that "it is universally

believed that the Invader followers who caused the violence

were paid FBI operatives." The FBI considers this statement

a sweeping generalization and again the Committee offers

no specific identities of individuals who believed those

causing violence were

FBI Intormants.

Other than articles

appearing in "Newsday" magazine in 1976 and more recently

statements by Mark Lane and possibly former members of the

Invaders, who else shares this belief? The letter from

Congressman Stokes identifies no one.

c.

This letter states (page 4) that the "Memphis

Field Office had prior knowledge of impending violence (a

fact memorialized in FBI documents) ."

This statement

implies the FBI knew of violence because its informants

Memorandum to Mr. Bassett

were instructed to instigate violence. However, as shown

in our files, FBI knowledge of impending violence was based

on information from various informants and officials,

resulting from a tense

situation brought about by the

Sanitation Workers Strike, all of which made knowledge of

impending violence rather

obvious.

d. The letter states (pages 4 and 5) that "members

of the Invaders were observed by agents of the FBI exhorting

the crowd and readying weapons from signposts (a fact later

testified to under oath by these agents)."

Invaders and informant files at FBIHQ disclosed that none

of the informants were members of the Invaders at the time

violence occurred. Only one of these five informants was

ever a member and that was subsequent to the assassination.

e.

The letter states (page 5) that

"Professor

Blakey's review of the files revealed that at least one

informant subsequently joined a more violence-prone

organization."

It is assumed this statement is to demonstrate

the informant's propensity for violence.

However, the FBI

believes that King's death and the rioting that followed

intensified racial feeling and tended to make some organiza-

tions

more violent.

Therefore, it is logical that whatever

organization our informant was

redirected into, it would be

more violence prone.

On 7/27/78, Mr. Keuch telephonically advised a

and found them

as outlined in his letter of 7/24/78 was the best course

of action in this matter.

He stated, however, that he

desired to use our arguments in responding to the letter

from Congressman Stokes and asked that this information be

furnished him on a formal basis.

Mr. Reuch also stated

he had contacted

the United States Attorney in New York

handling the Socialist Workers Party case and had received

clearance that our action :

in this matter would have no

bearing on that litigation.

The Honorable Griffin B. Bell

Attorney General of the United States

Department of Justice

Washington, D.C.

Dear MI. Attorney General:

In connection with the Committee's investigation into

the circumstances surrounding the death of Dr. Martin Luther

King, JI., I write to request that you make certain field

office informant files available to the Committee so that

serious allegations involving the Federal Bureau of Inves-

tigation and the death of Di. King may be resolved.

The

Committee has already had access to the relevant Bureau

personnel, and it has conducted extensive interviews among

those who

may also be subjects of this aspect of the Com-

mittee's investigation.

The focus of the Committee's

effort now is to determine if the written record supports

or refutes the oral testimony on the relevant questions.

These files have been denied to the Committee by the Director

of the Bureau by letter dated June 1l, 1978, with the con-

currence of the Criminal Division. I write this letter to

ask that you give your personal attention to resolving this

serious matter.

of understanding been the department ate me meant con-

As you will recall, it was intended that the.

Memorandum should cover what materials the Department of

Justice would release to the Committee, (I.A.C.).

Blakey, the Chief Counsel and Staff Director of the Com-

violence that occurred in Memphis when Di. King was there

In 1968.

The files were to be examined in a form in which

only the identity of the informants had been exercised from

• them.

The letter also expressly noted the "Committee

reserves the right to request...the identity of all Invader

informants during 1968 should the sanitized files and agent

interviews be inconclusive on the issues to be resolved by

the Committee."

(See I.B. (1))

During the week of May 14, 1978, the Bureau, in partial

response to the April 12th request, permitted only Professor

Blakey to review the duly excised FBI Headquarters informant

files. The staff of the Committee was denied access to the

files.

Professor Blakey agreed to this form of limited access,

reserving the right to insist that the terms of the Memorandum

đt the too

of Understanding be complied with.

In a letter dated May 23, 1978, the Committee then

requested "that the Memphis Field Office files for these

same informants be prepared for access by the staff."

The

Headquarters files contained basically administrative data;

it was felt that the Field Office file might be more en-

lightening.

The

letter also observed, "While the Committee

feels that the procedure by which... (Professor Blakey) was

permitted access to the first set

of files was unacceptable

and contrary to the Memorandum of Understanding, pending

further discussions to arrange to broaden access, this pro-

cedure may again be utilized."

It should be clearly understood that the Committee's

request for these files, as well as the other informant

files, is predicated on the precise language of the Memo-

randum of Understanding.

Section I.B. (2) of the lemorandum sets out the

"Specific Rules"

by which access to materials may be ob-

tained.

Section I.B. (2), in pertinent part, provides:

Where... requested materials reveal the

identity of FBI sources who are or were

informants...The D(epartment) of J (ustice)

will appropriately sanitize, including ex-

cising, if necessary, information identifying

such operations, sources or informants.

Under I.B. (2), the only matter at issue is the terms

of access.

Denial

of access is not contemplated. B(2)

clearly allows access to the files at issue, subject only

to proper sanitization. Nothing else is asked for here.

The Committee is fully cognizant of the issues raised

by the Bureau in its letter of June 13, 1978, in response

to our request.

It is, of course, recognized that a measure

of confidence in the Bureau's informant program would, in

fact, be eroded should it become general knowledge that

the FBI identified its informants in anything but extra-

ordinary circumstances, where, under the prevailing view,

they must be identified. See

Roviaro v. United States,

353 U.S. 53 (1957).

Nevertheless, all this is premature;

the Committee has not requested, as yet, that the identity

nat the sacnes,

of these informants be revealed.

All that is requested is

access to the files, in order that serious allegations

involving the informants and the Bureau be resolved.

The Director's letter of June 13, 1978, offers instead

of access to the relevant files, sworn affadavits denying

the Bureau's informants acted as "agents provacateurs".

The

Committee feels that this procedure for resolving this

issue

would be unacceptable.

As you know, with respect to the king

investigation the Committee is, in effect, performing for

death of DI. King the same function that the Warren Commission

performed for the death of President Kennedy.

One of the most

frequent criticisms of the Warren Commission is that in at-

tempting to resolve the issue of whether or not Lee Harvey

Oswald was an FBI informant, the Commission accepted sworn

affadavits from the Bureau.

that it is unacceptable in this instance merely to rely on

sworn denials without an opportunity to examine and cross

examine the relevant witnesses and to examine primary source

documents. Our investigation must command the confidence of

the American people if it is to achieve its goals. Conse-

quently, it will not be possible for the Committee to accept,

as the Director suggests, that this issue be resolved by the

taking of affadavits from the Bureau.

After noting that the allegation that the Bureau or

persons employed by it instigated violence is not new, the

Director's letter of June 13, 1978, denied the Committee

access to the files, referring to "overwhelming evidence

disproving the...allegation."

In support of that assertion,

the Committee is told that "The Memphis Office advised that

these informants did not advocate nor take part in the

planning of any riot."

Next, our attention is drawn to the

Department of Justice Task Force's conclusion, stated in two

sentences of their report.

:.

"There is no evidence that the activities

of these informants related directly to

DI. King.

Moreover, there is no evidence

that would suggest that these informants

were connected in any way to the assassina-

tion of DI. King.

(HQ 134-11867; 170-1841;

170-1922; 170-2530, and 157-4885)."

From the Committee's perspective, this "evidence" is

hardly overwhelming.

But that is largely beside the point.

Without access to this evidence, it cannot be evaluated.

Mere denials and conclusions cannot be accepted in lieu of

records and sworn testimony.

The Committee has completed

the compilation of an oral record of the events that tran-

spired in Memphis during March and April, 1968.

This record

consists of interview notes,

testimony under oath before the

Committee, and witness depositions.

It is now imperative

that these witnesses' current recollections be compared with

the contemporaneous

written record,

particularly that con-

tained in the Iclorant informant files.

Throughout the effort to resolve this issue, the Com-

mittee has attempted to move with restraint. It was not until

our field interviews with former members of the Invaders and

people present

in Memphis at the time of the March 28, 1968

march revealed: 1) that the Invaders were in fact a proximate

cause of the violence, and 2) that it is universally believed

that the Invader followers who caused the violence were paid

FBI operatives that we reguested access to any informant files.

By that time, the Committee had reviewed the Sanitation

Strike, Invaders,

King and Southern Charter Leadership Con-

ference files.

It had also reviewed the Memphis Police

Department files, and it had interviewed their undercover

operative within the Invader organization.

The Committee had initially hoped that the answers it

"sought would be contained

in the Headquarters files.

They

are, as noted above, largely administrative, containing only

general information on informant reliability, payment of fees,

and justification for continuing the informant's status. They

do not contain agent instructions; they do not reflect in

detail the working

relationship between agents and informants.

From the Conmittee's perspective, therefore, the information

contained in the Headquarter files proved inadequate. Sub-

sequent interviews with current and

former agents have also

revealed that:

1) the Memphis Field Office had prior know-

ledge of impending violence (a fact memorialized in FBI

documents) and 2)

members of the Invaders were observed by

agents of the FBI exhorting the crowd and readying weapons

from signposts la fact later testified to under oath by

•these agents.) Professor Blakey's review of the files

revealed that at least one informant subseguently joined

a more violence-prone organization.

You can see, therefore,

the reasons why access to the files, duly excised, is es-

sential.

I feel that this is a matter that can best be resolved

by our discussing the issues involved.

Since the Select

Committee's investigation is in its last stage - our public

hearings will begin in August -- I suggest that you give me

a call this week and we can meet as soon as possible to dis-

cuss this matter.

JUL 2 4 1978

The Director

Federal Bureau of Investigation

DATE:

Robert I. Keuch

Special Counsel to the Attorney General

House Select Committee on Assassinations

Request for Memphis Field Office Files

RLK :mal

By letter dated July 5, 1978, directed to the Attorney

General, the Select Committee has repeated its request for

access

to the Memphis, Tennessee, field office informant files

concerning informants in the Invaders, a black militant group

It is my judgment, as Special Counsel for the

Attorney General, that it is necessary to provide access to

excised versions of the requested files to Committee Chief

Counsel, Professor G. Robert Blakey. I have made an oral

request

to have the files processed

and this is to request

that this task be completed as soon as possible and that

ProfessoI Blakey be provided access to the processed files.

As you are aware, we had, by letter of June 13, 1978,

previously refused the request of the Committee. I

concurred

in that action and believe it was correct based on the fact

that, in our view, the only need demonstrated by the Committee

for access to the

field office files rested on naked allega-

tions which had been denied in the past.

In the Committee's

latest demand, presented by the July 5 letter, the Committee,

on pages 3, 4, and 5 of the letter, outlines in greater detail

the justification for its request.

ment

that the information set forth by the Committee is not

sufficient to substantiate the allegations made about the

activities of the informants at issue, it is equally clear

that we can no longer take the position that the Committee's

legislative and investigative needs are based on pure specula-

tion and/or naked allegations. That being the case, the

limited access outlined above

should be granted in response

to the Committee's request.

I am, of course, aware of the deep concern held by the

Bureau concerning any indication that we are willing to

disclose informants or release information which will lead

to their disclosure.

I share that concern and my decision

in this matter has been reached only with the greatest

possible consideration of that concern.

It is regrettable but inescapable that the timing of

this demand by the Committee makes our decisions much more

subject to public comment and criticism.

The present interest

in, and repeated stories related to, the allegations in the

case of MI. Rowe makes

this one of the worst times to come

to a point of absolute refusal in the face of the justifica-.

tions advanced by the Committee. If and when we reach the

ultimate confrontation over the possible disclosure of

informants, our position will be extremely strengthened by

any steps we can take consistent with our needs to protect

our informants to provide the Committee with necessary

evidence and information. That balance, at least at this

stage, is best struck by offering the limited access under

discussion.

Since the Committee's last request was directed personally

to the Attorney General by the Chairman of the Committee, the

Committee is preparing for public hearings in the near future,

and has delayed issuing subpoenas for these materials based on

my representations that we were making immediate efforts to .

respond, we should not delay our response to the Committee.

Therefore, I am sending a copy of this request to the Attorney

General.

If the Bureau disagrees with my determination and

not to comply with my decision, your response should

be directed to the Attorney General so this matter can be resolved

quickly.

NW 65994 Docld:32989738 Page 34

---

## Page 35

- 2=

In addition to the further justification submitted by

the Committee for their request, I believe there are other

• factors which support my conclusion that we should provide

the limited access discussed.

An important factor is that,

if the response to the Committee's latest request is a complete

refusal, the Committee will issue subpoenas for the informant

files.

The only way we could respond to such subpoenas other

than by providing the requested information would be to seek

to have them enjoined by a federal court.

While

this type

of confrontation may ultimately be necessary during the course

of the Committee's proceedings, it does not appear wise to

take this step without first offering limited access. This

is so for two reasons.

First, in contrast to the limited access we will offer

the Committee, a subpoena would request access to the informant

files by the entire staff thereby increasing the possibility

that the informants could be compromised through the knowledge

of the members of the staff who have studied the other files

in the matter in greater detail and, in any case, would broaden

the number of individuals who could

learn the identity of the

informants.

Secondly, if we are to prevail in the litigation, a

possibility which, in my juagment, is remote given the, subject

matter of the Committee's inquiry and the allegations and

information that formed the basis of their request, we can

only win if we show a reasonable posture to the court. An

absolute refusal to comply would not do that. An attempt

to meet the Committee's needs while protecting our interests

by providing limited access to excised files would do that.

eurther support lor the procedure of providing limited

access stems

Irom the very nature of the Committee's investi-

gation.

Unlike the normal Congressional investigation and/or

lawsuit, the Bureau and the Department of Justice are targets

or subjects of the investigation. Under such circumstances

our obligation to be as cooperative as reasonably possible

with the Congress is obvious.

pubLic conception or oui

cooperation is going to be a very important factor in the

acceptance or lack of acceptance of the Committee's efforts

and determinations in these investigations.

To put ourselves

in a posture of confrontation with the Committee over this

particular issue without first attempting some accommodation

of competing interests would only serve to revive all the

allegations and criticisms of us and our actions concerning

the assassinations.

St. Louis informant file.

SYNOPSIS AND DETAILS: In Ryan to Bassett memorandum dated

7727/78,

background information was provided regarding the

recent discovery of information in St. Louis file 137-16185

concerning the existence of a possible conspiracy in the

MURKIN

case, which, apparently, had never been acted on or

disseminated. This information, contained in a meniorandum

of SA Howard

of a meeting between a

St. Louis informant (SL 3167-C) and

Russell George Beyers, a St. Louis fence,

1973. During that meeting, Beyers advised that he had met

with a St. Louis attorney and another individual, and they

had offered him $10,000 or $20,000 to kill Dr. King. Beyers

also stated that the unidentified individual was the person

who later paid off James Earl Ray for the assassination of

Dr. King.

On ?/28/78, the Director indicated that the two

former Special Agents from the St. Louis Office who handled

the informant (SL 3167-C) should be interviewed to ascertain

on 7/28/78.

Copies of the FD-302's reflecting those

In his interview, former SA Kennedy advised that he

had handled St. Louis informant 3167-C. He was shown a

memorandum dated 3/19/14, to SAC, St. Louis, Erom him, reflecting

several contacts with that informant.

The informant furnished

information on several matters, including the information

which pertained to the MURKIN case.

Kennedy recalled

receiving that information, but he

had no recollection of ever

having disseminated it.

stated

that his failure to

do so was through inadvertence and, in retrospect, that

information should have been handled further.

He advised

that his evaluation of the informant and the individual from

whom the information was obtained, Russell George Byers, did

not affect the manner in which this matter was handled.

Robert L. Bender, tormer st. Louis supervisor,

advised

that he had supervised the squad to which Kennedy

was assigned. He did not specifically recall the memorandum

of 3/19/74 or the information regarding the MURKIN investigation

found on Page 3 therein. He stated that because his hand-

MI. KENNEDY was unable to provide an evaluation of the

routine excisions, including identities of persons for privacy

reasons. (Attachment two contains a copy of documents as

released under FOIA). Although we are concerned with the

privacy of individuals, we cannot object to release of this

material for privacy reasons. Release of our documents to the

HSCA was an authorized means of disclosure under the Privacy

Act. In any subsequent release, privacy of individuals involved

is the responsibility of the HSCA.

Therefore, for above reasons, we should offer no

objections to release of this information, and Mr. Keuch will

as stated in the nolA letter, these documents, except for

Identification Division records of Ray's brothers and those

marked as Court Exhibits, were given out under FOIA.

However,

routine excisions were made, and therefore the documents are not

in their entirety in the public domain.

It is the opinion of the CIU that the nature of this

material furnished by the HSCA could at best be described as

"bland".

It is believed the HSCA is seeking sensationalism

and publidity and therefore it is unlikely its hearings will be

limited to areas covered by the attached documents.

addition, the Department of Justice and FBI were given only

three days to review this material and state its objections,

if any. Mr. Keuch was contacted on this point and agreed to

protest this short deadline to the HSCA. A representative

of the Legal Counsel Division (LCD) will also bring this point

to/the attention of Mr. Blakey in effort to secure more time

for future review of documents subject to public hearings.

This matter has been coordinated with Ron Heller,

Legal Liaison and Congressional Affairs Unit, LCD,

H. P. Beckwith, Disclosure Section, FOIPA, and S. P. Riggin,

Operations Section, FOIPA Branch.

Walker was received at the MSP on December 20,

1977, to serve three consecutive three year sentences

from

Cape Girardeau, Missouri, for Exhibiting and Flourishing

a Dangerous and Deadly Weapon, for a total of nine years

sentence.

He previously had been in the MSP from October 10,

for Assault With Intent to do Great Bodily Harm.

He previously

had been committed to State Hospital #4 in Farmington, Missouri,

on several occasions, dating back to 1957, with

final

release

in May 1967.

His history of mental disorders included alcoholism,

and Warden

Wyrick furnished

the following background information

from the file on Walker, which includes references to Reverend

Martin Luther King:

"HEALTH: No restrictions. Subject had several admissions

to Barnes Hospital early in 1964.

A report from his doctor

concerning this indicates the subject suffers from recurrent

hematemasis which is severe enough to cause anemia.

he suffers from blackouts and paralysis.

The subject's

and apparently believes his paralysis are due to hysteria.

"Subject has been admitted to Farmington hospital on several

occasions dating back to 1957.

He has been discharged several

times and escaped from the hospital on two different occasions.

He was diagnosed as schizophrenic reaction, chronic

"SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT: According to the subjects mother he had

worm spasms when he was one year old and suffered with

enuresis until he was 17 years of age. School records

(1941 - 1972), who was case agent in captioned matter, by

staff employees of the House Select Committee on Assassinations

in Washington, D. C. on 6/28/78, are set out. The interview

was voluntary on the part of Mr. DOBSON, in accordance with

current cooperative Bureau policy and was conducted by MICHAEL

EBERHARDT, Assistant Deputy Chief Counsel to the Committee. An

unknown female in her mid to late 20s was in the room during

the interview.

She was originally introduced by EBERHARDI but

no mental note as to her name was made as it was assumed she

was a stenographer.

She was later observed to be taking notes

in longhand, from which it was presumed she was another staff

attorney.

The interview was preceded by a conference with

Former Special Agent Harold R. Dobson (1941 - 1972),

residence: 8831 Bracken Circle, St. Louis, Missouri

63123,

who was St. Louis case Agent on the M. L. King - James Earl Ray

case in 1968, was interviewed, not under oath, by MI. Michael

Eberhardt, Assistant Deputy Chief Counsel to the House Select

Committee on Assassinations, at the offices of that committee,

Room 3386, Second and "D" Streets, Southwest, Washington, D. C.,

from 2:00 P.M. to 2:45 P.M. on the afternoon of June 28, 1978,

at which time he furnished the following information in response

to direct questions:

Dobson served as a Special Agent of the Federal Bureau

of Investigation from October 20, 1941 to retirement on June 30,

1972, being assigned to the Boston, Newark, St. Paul, and St.

Louis Divisions. He was in St. Louis from 1947 until retirement.

little knowledge or experience regarding New Left, racial and hate

group cases. He was an alternate supervisor but declined

authorization as supervisor for personal reasons.

Dobson was generally aware of the existence of the

Cointel Program in St. Louis, but was unable to recall any

specific activities, objectives, or accomplishments of same.

Dobson was unable to suggest why the case was assigned

to him, except that he had the first St. Louis lead in the case,

to trace the weapon used through officials of Browning Arms

Company, with whom he had continuing liaison, and for the further

reason he had been utilized in an administrative capacity on

virtually every major case of national importance in the St.

Louis Division beginning with the surveillance and apprehension

of St. Louis Communist Party leaders in 1952. Another Special

Agent since retired handled the Ray penitentiary escape case

Special Agent in Charge Thomas Gearty supervised the

King case in St. Louis.

It was Dobson's responsibility to

coordinate the investigation, handle the resulting "mountain of

paper", see that obvious, logical, reasonable, or merely

desirable leads or avenues of investigation were appropriately

assigned (with Special Agent in Charge approval), promptly and

adequately covered, and properly reported, and to keep the

Special Agent in Charge, Bureau, Memphis,

and other interested

offices promptly advised of pertinent developments.

Until the true identity of Ray was established, every

Special Agent in the St. Louis Division was assigned exclusively

to the case.

Twenty-four hour coverage of all leads was

mandatory.

Developments of the day were discussed, and "brain

busting" sessions were held at nightly conferences of all

Special Agents, at which most new assignments were made. All

employees clearly gave of their best efforts..

Dobson was unable to recall specifically what efforts

were made to determine the whereabouts of John Ray on the day

of the assassination. He suggested the file would be the best

evidence in this regard.

He believed the possibility of John

Ray's involvement was undoubtedly recognized and that appropriate

steps were taken to resolve.

Toll call records of relatives were obtained in

accordance with a then current Bureau policy subpoena process.

Relative bank accounts were monitored and results set forth in

reports with a statement that the information would only be

available after issuance of a subpoena duces tacum.

Coverage of

relatives consisted of this, plus personal interviews and contacts

## Page 54

HOUSE SELECT. COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

with informants, sources, neighbors, and associates, and

available public records.

Relatives were initially uncooperative in varying

degrees, but subsequently became generally cooperative,

although Dobson never fully trusted any of them. He was unable

to recall any evidence developed that Ray was ever in St. Louis

territory, or in contact with any relatives there, subseguent to

his penitentiary escape. He doubted financial contributions to

Ray by them, as their combined incomes and assets, in his

estimation, were insufficient to support the life style Ray

apparently enjoyed following his escape.

Dobson had no knowledge or any information as to the

source of Ray's income following his escape. He conjectured

the same would have logically had to result from successful

criminal activity or be contributed by an unknown person or.

He recognized Ray's record stamped him as a "loser"

but opined

it was not beyond the realm of possibility access

to an excellent prison library and association with convicts

less unsuccessful than himself could have enhanced the quality

of Ray's thought processes to a point where he could have

conceived and carried

out a

successful supermarket or other

similar robbery. At least his escape was successful. He

considered Ray's technically proper preparation and filing of a

motion for a new trial, which was pending at the time of his

escape, as evidence of this possibility.

Dobson recalled that,

as a Missouri prosecutor prior to entering the Bureau, he had

uniformly recommended alternative punishment for non-habitual

criminals, as the Missouri Penitentiary, even then, was generally

considered a "finishing school for criminals".

Supermarkets

offered the possibility of being almost as lucrative as banks,

without the disadvantage of incurring Federal jurisdiction.

He

feels sure major police departments in the St. Louis territory

had been contacted to determine if Ray could be a logical

suspect in unsolved supermarket robberies. He recalled some

indication Ray might have been involved in a bank robbery in

Alton, Illinois and that the Springfield, Illinois Division had

been so advised, but he had no knowledge as to the outcome of

investigation there.

Dobson was generally aware of the existence of white

hate organizations, but was of the opinion members of such

organizations in St. Louis territory lack sufficient organization,

3

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

intelligence, and financial capability for significant

involvement in the King killing. Such organizations, in his

estimation, should have been

able to reasonably foresee

King's death would elevate him to the status of a martyr,

which would have been counterproductive to their aims and

He was of the further opinion that any intelligent

co-conspirator would undoubtedly have eliminatedRay as a

security measure. He suggested that, if then current rumors

that King had become a liability to the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference were true, that organization had the most

to gain from King's demise.

All St. Louis informants, potential informants and

sources regarding criminal, security, racial,

hate group, or

other matters, were under continuing instructions to immediately

report even the slightest information which they could obtain

or which might come to their attention regarding the King case.

Dobson recalled John Gawron as an elderly, selt-

contessed habitual criminal, who had lived with Ray's mother

several years until her death. He never met, saw, or talked

to

Gawron. If Gawron was initially carried as a PCI, but later

appeared openly, Dobson was unable to recall why, but suggested

Gawron may have initially indicated some potential for

furnishing information regarding current criminal matters and

was later found incapable of doing so.

Having lived with Ray's

mother, Gawion was undoubtedly able to furnish some factual

personal history and background information as to the family

in the past, but it was Dobson's impression that Gawron was not

fully trusted by them and was capable of furnishing only

conjectural information as to their then current activities.

According to Agents handling Gawron, he would start with a half-

truth or conjecture, and embroider upon it, and therefore was

considered generally to be unreliable.

St. Louis Agents contacting released fellow inmates

were instructed to not only obtain

all possible information as

to Ray's whereabouts, but all possible information as to their

degree of association with him, his sentiments, his plans, the

identities of any associates or friends either

in or out of

prison, and the manner of his escape.

Dobson was unable to recall any telephonic contacts

with the Memphis case agent, although there may have been one

or two. He was in frequent telephonic contact with the..

Chicago Assistant Special Agent in Charge, who was handling

the case there,

as Jerry Ray made at least one trip to visit

St. Louis relatives.

Dobson never met, saw, or spoke with any Ray relatives,

with the exception of Jerry Ray who contacted him telephonically

on two or three occasions during a visit to St. Louis pursuant

to instructions from the Chicago Division.

Dobson had no idea as to the basis for any friction

which may have existed between Director Hoover and King. Mr.

Hoover never confided in Dobson and never sought his advice.

The Bank of Alton, Alton, Illinois, was robbed

by two

white males wearing stocking masks on 7/13/67. The unknown

subjects were armed with a sawed off shotgun and an

automatic pistol. They escaped with $27,230.00. No one was

harmed. There were no bank cameras, no bait money, and no

latent fingerprints developed. Numerous subjects, including

James Earl Ray, were developed. No one was ever identified

as the robber and the case remains unsolved. James Eugene

Gawron, known to have been an associate of Ray, advised that

he and

Ray cased the Bank of Alton, in 1959, but did not rob

it as planned. Extensive investigation by the Springfield

Division, including showing of Ray's photographs, failed io

identify Ray as one of the robbers. The bulk of the Alton

investigation pertaining to Ray's involvement was reported

in the Murkin file and not the 91 file.

1/015e

The Select_Committee_on Assassinations_has learned that

the Department of Justice recently commerced an investigation

into the misfiling of an informant allegation in the St. Louis

Field Office of the FBI.

This allegation discussed a sum of

money being offered to an individual named Russell George

Byers to kill Dr. Martin Luther King, JI.

As you are aware, the Committee is pursuing this allega-

tion and investigating whether the circumstances relate

in any fashion to DI. King's assassination in Memphis,

Tennessee on April 4, 1968.

Therefore, in conjunction with our investigation, it is

requested that the Department of Justice, as well as the

Federal Bureau of Investigation, provide the Committee with

copies of all reports, inter and intra-office memoranda, airtels,

teletypes, photos, and other miscellaneous materials pertaining

to the investigation of this matter.

•/5,

This request should be considered on a

priority basis

and the Committee appreciates the cooperation of the Department

of Justice as well as the Federal Bureau

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

July 27, 1978

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

Captioned committee, by letter dated June 16, 1978:

requested an Interview with Special Agent D. Alan Reighley, III,

Allentown,,Pennsylvania, Resident Agency, Philadelphia Division,

at a date to be later decided.

The interview was subsequently

scheduled at 11:00 a.m., on July 11, 1978, at the House Office

Building, Annex 2, Second and D Streets, S.W., Washington, D. C.

On July 11, 1978, SA Reighley was interviewed by

Staff Attorney Tom Sacco, House Select Committee on Assassinations

(HSCA), at the above address.

Mr. Sacco advised he is in the

process of "tying up loose ends"

in that portion of the Martin

Luther King assassination dealing with "extremist groups".

oI his questioning

concerned activities of the Klan and Minutemen

groups in the Reading, Pennsylvania, area during the period of

August, 1967, through April, 1968, when Dr. King was assassinated.

SA Reighley was able to give Mr.

Sacco a fairly detailed account

of the general activities of these groups during the pertinent

period.

During the above interview, Mr. Sacco advised that

he is in receipt of certain "allegations"

from certain sources

regarding the relationship between the FBI and Klan and

Minutemen groups in the Philadelphia fBl territory, and, more

specifically, the Reading area. The "allegations" being that the

FBI "on a regular basis" furnished right wing extremist groups

a Fit an or gas out, the

with intelligence information for their use against Dr. King.

He stated he has specific reference to an allegation that the FBI

in the Reading area furnished extremist groups with photographs

oI Dr. King In attendance at a meeting with

"communists" which

the extremist groups used to try to discredit Dr. King.

conclusions of the FBI.

House Select Committee on Assassinations

In answer to the above "allegation", SA Reighley

emphatically denied that the fBl in the Reading area had ever

engaged in such activity during his assignment there, nor

had he ever received any information that this had been done

in the FBI elsewhere.

Mr. Sacco

stated that the above "allegations" came

Irom Roy Frankhouser (former Grand Dragon of the United Klans

of America for Pennsylvania and activitist with numerous white

hate groups including the Minutemen); and that he had also received

the same information from "other sources".

He later admitted

that his investigation indicates that the information received

from "other sources" emanated from Frankhouser.

Mr. Sacco then

asked numerous questions about Frankhouser and

' his background

and SA Reighley answered these questions in detail. He also

asked questions regarding the relationship between Frankhouser

and FBI Agents in the Philadelphia Division.

He made specific

reference to retired SAs William E. Davis and Frank Kauffman,

formerly of the Reading Resident Agency; and retired Assistant

Director Joe Jameson,

Philadelphia Division.

Readinformer specie

former Special Agent in Charge of the

SA Reighley stated that his relationship

with Frankhouser had always been an "investigator-subject"

relationship and that to the best of his knowledge, this was the

l alwayse ben

same relationship that Davis and Kauffman had with Frankhouser.

SA Reighley also advised Mr. Sacco that he has no information at

all as to whether or not Frankhouser had any relationship

whatsoever with Special Agent in Charge Jameson but that it is

highly unlikely that Frankhouser had ever even met Mr. Jameson.

Mr. Sacco stated that SA Reighley had sufficiently

covered the area in which he is

interested and he sees no

necessity to call anyone else from the FBI concerning this

particular matter.

He indicated that he had certainly questioned

the reliability of the source of the allegations, namely,

Frankhouser; however, his main concern was leaving the

"allegations"

unanswered.

SA Reighley thanked Mr. Sacco

for the opportunity

to answer the "allegations"

and offered to be of any future

assistance in this regard.

City Division. Mr. Eberhardt was informed of Special

Agent Weaver's date of birth, home address, telephone

number and number of years assigned to the

Jefferson

City, Missouri Resident Agency in response to his specific

questions.

Mr. Eberhardt's questions and Special Agent

Weaver's responses were, in summary, as follows:

Number of Agents assigned Jefferson City pre-

sently and in 1966-1968:

3 Special Agents assigned presently and 2 in

1966-1968.

Form which would have been used in 1966-1968, by

Missouri

State Penitentiary, in advising FBI of an escapee

and requesting Unlawful Flight to Avoid Proseation Process:

Missouri State Penitentiary officials would have

notified Jefferson City Resident Agency of escapee and

method of escape, existence of warrant for escape and Cole

County Prosecuting Attorney would have been contacted by

Resident Agency regarding a letter requesting Unlawful

Flight to Avoid Prosecution Process through the United

States Attorney for the Western District of Missouri, at

process if such were not in the hands of the prosecuting

attorney, but in response to fir. Eberhardt's question, no

specific cases were recalled.

Regarding any knowledge of any questioning of

James Earl Ray's family in UFAP case on Ray:

Normal investigative procedure would have included

interviews of Ray family members and friends and associates

of Ray in a fugitive investigation to locate him, but the

case was assigned to special Agent Rowan B. Ayers, deceasec

In November, 1974, and Special Agent Weaver is not familiar

with specific leads set out in UPAP case on Ray by Special

Opinion of Special Agnt (SA) Weaver as to how Ray

escaped from the Missouri State Penitentiary:

SA Weaver recalls arriving at conclusion based on

review of Missouri State Penitentiary records that Ray

probably escaped by hiding in bread box which left Mis-

sourt State Penitentiary in truck, hauling bread to outside

prison farm.

SA Weaver's opinion of any outside help Ray re-

ceived in his escape:

Either through review of records or casual conver-

it is SA Weaver's recollection that it

a car possibly operated by a family member, outside prison,

possibly after walking a distance on railroad tracks,

but

SA Weaver now has no

specific recollection of how this know-

ledge was gained; and in response to Mr. Eberhardt's specific

question, SA leaver did not gain this information through in-

formant sources.

Knowledge of narcotics in Missouri State Peni-

tentiary in the 1960's:

SA Ayers was probably in the Missouri State Peni-

tentiary two or three times per week in about the Mid-1960's

and SA Weaver only occasionally there during the course of

a month since his territory did not include Cole County

and the Missouri State Penitentiary in the Mid-1960's.

Whether or not FBI had any informants at Mis-

souri State Penitentiary in the Mid-1960's:

Since Missouri State Penitentiary is a State

No recollection of civil rights complaints or civil

New Orleans to Memphis, captioned "MURKIN" which sets forth

a list of guests registered at the Provincial Motel.

V. 157-10673-802 P. 70 is a xeroxed copy of the

registration card

for "JOE PARISH" at the Provincial Motel

as set forth

on page 84 of the report of SA ALBERT E. MILLER

dated 11/27/68 at New Orleans.

The indices of the New Orleans Office contain no

other references relating to anyone by the name of "JOE PARISH."

For the information of the Bureau because "JOE PARISE"

was unable to be identified and located, it appears possible

that this is a fictitious name used by a male to rent a room

for a

"I-nite stand."

"JOE PARISH" would be used in

a similar manner as

the name

"JOE SMITH" is used in other

parts of the country on motel and hotel registration cards.

It is being noted that the name PARISH is commonly used in

this area as all 64 counties in the state of Louisiana are

as or referred

to as a Parish, ie. Orleans Parish,

Jefferson Parish, St. James Parish, St. John the Baptist Parish,

Rustin who in turn, had been called by Jim Lawson (scLe

representative in Memphis, Tennessee) and said they were trying

to get all kinds of civil rights leaders

During their discussions, levison told wachted that

a contribution. Levison said he meant (questions such as)

SEGNAT

Martin Luther King, JX.

Wachtel secured plane reservations for sir persons

to fly to Memphis the night of April 4, 1968: Wachtel felt that

he and his wife, Stanley Levison, Clarence Jonest

Harry Belafonte

and possibly Bayard Rustin would make the trip.

Levison preferred not to have Rustin present at any

meeting they might have (in Memphis) because he, believed the

rest of the (SCLC) staff would feel hostile.

Therearter, beyison and wachtel began to doubt the

wisdom of going to Memphis that night since they could not

hold any important discussions or make any important decisions.

Wachtel noted that the most important thing they would try:

to do is not to have violence in King's name.

He indicated

that Andrew Young,

Executive Vice President of the SCLC, has

taken that approach. Levison stated this is not the kind of

approach he would have taken, that he did not mean to tell

them not to be calm or to urge them into violence, but that

he feels the point they should be making is, what

kind of

system

'is it that produces such a thing (King's death) when

he starts to fight for the lowly, like the garbage men. Levison

said that in other words he thought "we've got to be angry"

Levison added that Andrew Young was probably, thinking that there

are a great many Negroes who are going to get hysterical and

• go out and get

themselves shot down.

Levison subsequently told Harry Belafonte that he

nad talked with desse Jackson,

an SCIc official, who told him

not to come to Memphis. Levison and Belafonte

agreed

to fly

to Atlanta at 11:30 AM on Friday, April 5, 1968. Levison told

Belafonte to make the reservations for the two of them and to

let Harry Wachtel and the others worry about themselves.

On April

5, 1960, the same source learned that

Andrew Young contacted Stanley Levison on that date. They

discussed King's

successor and

agreed that Ralph (Abernathys

an SCLC official) was the only logical choice.

Young stated

that they were

of April 5, 196691ne to call a press conference on the morning

"To sort of straighten things out"

announce the establishment of the Martin Iuther King Fund to

perpetuate his memory.

Young noted that

I Senator Robert Kennedy

had put his plane at their disposal.
