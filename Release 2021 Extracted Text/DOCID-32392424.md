Headquarters will note from the above that three lines were disconnected in

order to cover three Yugoslav lines. Two of the lines which were disconnected

were Cuban Embassy lines, both were not in use by the Cubans. One was in

the apartment which had been vacated by Ramon Sinobas and not occupied by

other Cubans.

The other was a telephone in the Cuban Embassy which was

never answered. The Cubans are trying to get Sinobas' line moved to the

Embassy.

They have also asked for the telephone company to repair 14-92-14.

As soon as these lines are working again, coverage of two of the Yugoslav

Embassy lines will be dropped in order to pick up all the Cuban lines which

are presumed to have a much higher priority.

3. Processing of LIENVOY Information

The Station continues to receive full transcripts in Spanish on the

• Cuban lines (three), the Soviet Embassy lines (five), and as of 18 and 23

September the Yugoslav lines (three). These transcripts are received each

morning for the day before. During September, the LIENVOY monitors

transcribed 1396 pages in addition to the daily resumen.

The outside translators now working on LIENVOY transcripts are

Orville HORSFALL, staff agent, who is used for almost any backlog which

begins to occur.

David B. SCHLAGETER, field contract agent, who transcribes the

Czech take.

Victor W. OBOLD, career agent, who transcribes the Yugoslav portion

of the Yugoslav take.

Douglas J. FEINGLASS, staff agent, who continues to transcribe the

Russian language portion of the Soviet take.

4. Exploitation of LIENVOY Information

Two leads from LIENVOY of operational interest in September 1963 were:

a. On 2 September 1963 a Russian speaking female contacted

the Soviet Embassy and asked for Svyatoslav Fedorovich KUZNETSOV, KGB.

She identified herself by name and as a professor from New Orleans..

gave the address of her apartment and asked for a meeting. This lead was

promptly followed up by station investigative assets who identified the woman

and learned that she was attending a philosophers' conference at the University

of Mexico. She returned to the United States on 17 September. All available

information was forwarded to Headquarters for passing to ODENVY.

b. MEXI-6135 reported the contact between an unidentified Czech

woman and the Czech Embassy.

5. Liaison

On 18 September 1963 Oliver G. GALBOND and Willard C. CURTIS

met with LIELEGANT and LIERGO. They also saw LIELEGANT on 20

September.

before 0800 hours to receive all LIENVOY tapes and trascripts from the

previous day. The daily meetings with Victor W. OBOLD and David B.

SCHLAGETER, the two EE translators, West transferred on 18 September 1963

from the Station EE case officer to the KURIOT technician, Gregory D.

PARMUTH who delivers and receives reels and transcripts from them each

day. PARMUTH also acts as a cutout for Douglas J. FEINGLASS.

Paul V. LEVISTER, Headquarters KUTUBE officer, visited the

Station from 22 September to l October to consult with LIENVOY and LIFEAT

case officers in preparation for a report to be written on the two projects

as examples of tap operations which produce both positive intelligence and

operational leads.
