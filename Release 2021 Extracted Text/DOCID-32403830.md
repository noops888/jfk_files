SUBJECT : Review of Agency Holdings Regarding Photograph of

Unidentified Individual in the Warren Commission

Report

REFERENCE: Memorandum from David W. Belin to E. Henry Knoche,

dated 15 April 1975

1. In accordance with reference request, we have examined

and summarized the record concerning a cropped photograph that was

considered by the Warren Commission in the course of its investi-

gation. The photograph (together with others of the same

individual) originated from an intelligence operation conducted

in October 1963. The photograph is of an individual who to this

day remains unidentified. Intelligence did not provide a photo-

graph of Lee Harvey Oswald during his brief stay in Mexico City

that month.

2. Under the extraordinary press of effort to develop infor-

mation on the assassin and the assassination, copies of the photo-

graph were made available by CIA's Mexico representative on the

afternoon of 22 November to the local FBI representative. Later

that day, assertedly on the decision of the Ambassador, copies

were conveyed by an FBI representative on a special U. S. Naval

Attache flight to the Dallas office of the FBI for possible use

in the ongoing investigation. One photograph, cropped by the

FBI, was shown to Mrs. Marguerite OSWALD (Lee Harvey. OSWALD's

mother) in Dallas on the evening of 23 November 1963 by an FBI

agent:

3. The Warren Commission's report describes the sequence of

events that ultimately resulted in Mrs. Marguerite OSWALD's

NW 65990 Docld:32403830. Page 3

## Page 4

-allegation that she had been shown a cropped photo of Jack RUBY

the day before he murdered her son. A further complication

compounding this erroneous conclusion was the fact that, when

she had been shown a copy of the same photograph in her appearance

before the Commission, it had been cropped by the FBI in Washing-

ton in a

slightly different manner.

4.. Although in no way related to Lee Harvey OSWALD Of his

stay in Mexico City from the morning of 27 September 1963 to the -

morning of 2 October 1963, at least one set of photographs of the

unidentified man originated during OSWALD's stay there. It is

important, therefore, to an understanding of the acquisition and

handling of the photographs by the CIA's Mexico representative

to review what he ascertained and did with the information

developed about OSWALD in Mexico City, together with CIA Head-

quarters action on that information.

5. From all credible evidence known to this time (none,

incidentally, added since the exhaustive work of the Warren Com-

mission), Lee Harvey OSWALD

spent four (4) full days and two (2)

partial days -- about 116 hours in all - in Mexico City from

about 10:00 a.m. 27 September 1963 to about 8:30 a.m. 2 October

1963. His place of residence was a small commercial traveler

hotel, not frequented by "gringos" -- the Hotel Commercio -- where

he was registered under alias. Exhaustive and detailed interviews.

and interrogation by the Mexican authorities and the FBI after the

assassination established that, in the recollection of all hotel

personnel, he left and returned late each day of his stay.

NW 65990 Docld:32403830 Page 4

---

## Page 5

•6. Allowing for the fact of late arrival and early departure,

and

assuming that he slept one-third of the time of his stay

(38 or 39 hours), there remain some 78 hours of accivity to be

accounted for. Overall, CIA's information can account only for

very brief periods during 28, 29 September and 1 October.

7. It should be noted that OSWALD was in no sense "under.

investigation." None of the facts of his defection and stay in

the USSR and return to the U. 'S., 1959-1962, were known to CIA's

Mexico representative before 10 October 1963. On that date, the

bare bones of Oswald's biography were forwarded by Headquarters in

response to a cabled report of 8 October which had forwarded, on

a routine basis, what appeared to be a contact by an American fox

a visa to Cuba in transit to the USSR. This was indicated and

deduced from information acquired on 1 October, which was the first

and only occasion on that visit in which OSWALD was recorded as

identifying himself (partially) by true name.

8. At no time during his stay in Mexico City did the CIA

acquire a photo of OSWALD. A careful review of all coverage was

conducted on 22 and 23 November 1963 after the assassination,

including materials back to August 1963. This confirmed that there

was no CIA photo coverage of OSWALD at any time during his Mexico

trip or stay in Mexico City. Moreover, although it had made a

cabled request on 15 October, the CIA's Mexico representative had

no photo of OSWALD in his records, nor did he receive one from

Headquarters -- which did not have one either -- before 22 November

1963.

## Page 6

•2. It must

be

stressed that what information there was

had not been (and normally is not) processed in "real time."

The means of acquisition and the volume of the information

preclude anything but the spot reporting of items judged to

be of more than ordinary interest and, therefore, noted in

summary logs. Photo coverage tended to become available in

quantity lots which requires scanning and selection on a rapid

and accelerated basis in four or five day "peaks." One of the

"triggers" that normally operates to focus and accelerate more

speedy review and reporting of this kind of raw intelligence is

the identification of a person's name.

This was precisely what

occurred on 1 October. It was this information reported to Head-

quarters in its first reference on OSWALD on 8 October 1963.

10. The CIA's Mexico representative did one more thing in

his 8 October report on Lee OSWALD based on the 1 October infor-

mation: he coupled the data with descriptive information acquired

from a sensitive source -- a photograph of a male individual,

apparently an American, who was observed entering an Embassy

on I October. This detail was reported on the 8th as a matter of

coincident fact. CIA's Mexico representative did not assert ox

suggest that the data led to any deduction that the photo was in.

fact OSWALD of, indeed, was in any way related to OSWALD.

11. One additional element of background must be stipulated

now as the final precondition to understanding the relevance (or

irrelevance) of the photo of the unknown individual placed in the

chain of evidence on 23 November in Dallas by the FBl agent:

what was the totality of CIA Mexico's coverage of OSWALD's activity

4

NW 65990 Docld:32403830 Page 6

---

## Page 7

as of the afternoon of the 23rd when all available coverage

had been checked?

12. The totality of this coverage on or reasonably

inferable to be OSWALD was read by, discussed with, and

examined by Warren

Commission staffers in Headquarters and in

Mexico City during a stay from 3-13 April 1964. All were made

available promptly to the FBI.

13. At

about mid-day on 1 October, the camera registered

the entry into an Embassy of a white-shirted individual. In the

opinion of CIA's Mexico representative, among all the persons

photographed that day, he appeared to be the only non-Latin and

possibly American who entered. On the chance that there could be

an association between the identification data derived from

coverage and the descriptive data derived from the photograph,

the two elements were reported as separate facts in the cable to

Headquarters on 8 October.

14. This action was not unusual and really amounted to an

analytic "quantum leap," in terms of the primitive status of

the OSWALD identification. Many examples of a similar kind of

thing can be found in the day-to-day record of Mexico City

Headquarters correspondence and reporting.

15. On 22 November 1963 CIA's Mexico representative cabled

Headquarters at 2229Z time after learning of the arrest of Lee H.

OSWALD, age 24, possibly in connection with the assassination,

and

referenced its earlier messages of 8-9 and 15 October and

Headquarters' reply of 10 October. This cable requested by

5

NW 65990 Docld:32403830 Page 7

## Page 8

priority pouch a photo of OSWALD so that a check could be

made of "all recent coverage for OSWALD. Forwarding soonest

copies of only visitor on 1 October who could be identical with

OSWALD. "

16. This obviously was for comparison at the CIA Mexico

City office which had estimated

the age of the unidentified male

whose photograph it had selected as having the "apparent age of

35. "

17. A dispatch was prepared in accordance with the indication

given in the cable of 22 November. The dispatch noted that photo

coverage of the unidentified individual had turned up on 4 and

15 October. The text of the 22 November 1963 pouched dispatch

read:

"I. Attached are copies of the only photographs

obtained. ..on I October 1963 which appeared to be

an American. This same man visited [an] Embassy on

4 October 1963.

"2. •Copies of these photographs were shown to the

U. S. Ambassador on 22 November 1963 and a copy of

each of the two photographs was given to Chief FBI,

Mexico, on that date. • . .

"P. S. Photographs dated 15 October 1963 were

inserted after typing of dispatch. These were taken

as [the] person entered [an] Embassy."

18. The "Unidentified Individual" remains to this day

unidentified. There is still no credible evidence, as far as

Did CIA personnel play any role in building up, disseminating,

then denigrating a report that Oswald had received money to kill

Kennedy from someone at the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City? Was

there a CIA connection with Gilberto Alvarado Ugarte, the source

of the story?

Answer:

As stated in information provided to the Warren Commission by the

Agency', CIA had no connection with

activities or statements by

Gilberto Alvarado Ugarte concerning allegations that Oswald

received money to kill President Kennedy from someone at the

Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. After Gilberto Alvarado came to

the American Embassy in Mexico City on 26 November 1963 and made

his allegations, his story was investigated by local CIA and

FBI representatives in liaison with

responsible Mexican

law

enforcement authorities. The Agency representatives informed the

FBI that Alvarado was a well known Nicaraguan Communist under-

ground member who was an informant of a Nicaraguan Security

Service officer who was, in turn, a CIA source.] On November

30, 1963, Alvarado admitted to Mexican security officials in

writing that his whole story of having seen Lee Oswald receive

money in the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City to assassinate

President Kennedy was false. On the same day, CIA reported

to

appropriate U. S. Government authorities that Alvarado

stated

his motive in telling his false story was to get the United.

Is there any indication that CIA believed Oswald's defection

and return might have been connected with a nission for

another intelligence organization (e.g., military) and that

this kept CIA away from his case?

Answer:

No. An Inter-Agency Source Registry is maintained by CIA as

a service of common

concern. Such a registry was in existence

throughout the 1960's.

Its purpose is to preclude accidental

contact or use of an intelligence

source of

one agency by

another.

Oswald's name never appeared in the registry.

Memorandum by Paul Hoch Concerning

CIA Activities and the Warren Commission Investigation

MI. Paul Hoch, a long-time critic of the Warren Commission

report, has been associated with Ramparts magazine, NBC news,

and US News and World Report in the past.

He has been in touch

with CIA on the Warren Commission investigation since at least

1971. Our files show that Mr. Hoch was one of 12 people who,

in 1967 or earlier, received a copy of the original unexpurgated

list of all Warren Commission material held by the National

Archives before a new list without CIA titles was prepared by

Archives

at our request.

In the introduction to his copyrighted

.24 March 1975 memo-

randum (Tab 1), Mr. Hoch notes that he "concentrates on the.

CIA, with emphasis on specific questions relevant to domestic

CIA activities, possible CIA nondisclosure to the Warren Com-

mission, and possible links between the assassination and CIA

attempts to kill Fidel Castro." A review of

the memorandum

reveals that it contains a number of questions and allegations

concerning CIA. However, it also contains questions and

allegations concerning the FBI, the Department of State, and

various military departments.

It appears to be a general

criticism of Warren Commission methods and findings with

particular emphasis on CIA's alleged role in obfuscating what

Mr. Hoch believes to be the true nature of its own activities

leading up to and following the assassination.

We are not competent to comment on Mr. Hoch's questions

or allegations concerning other Covernment agencies or the

Commission. He has raised a nunber of points concerning CIA

that we address

below.: Before doing so, however, a few words

are in order concerning the set of mind with which Mr. Hoch

seems to have approached this matter.

On page 11 of his memorandum, Mr. Hoch quotes Mr. James

Angleton as having made the following remark to Mr. Seymour

Hersh when asked by the latter about alleged CIA wrong-doing

and domestic activities: "A mansion has many rooms and there

were many things going on during the period of the [anti-warl

bombings.

I'm not privy to who struck John." Mr. Hoch then

expresses puzzlement over this latter statement. He notes that

"who struck John" may be a literary allusion or cliche unfamiliar

to him and goes on to say:

It may have been a

reference

to some other John--

e.g., Mitchell. Also, it is conceivable that "who

struck John" was some sort of code name for the. CIA

study of the Kennedy assassination.. Angleton should be

asked to explain that statement, and whether he is aware

of any CIA investigations of Oswald or the assassination,

particularly any which may have reached conclusions dif-

ferent from

the Warren Commission's: Regardless of what

Angleton now

says he meant by his comment, an

intended

reference to John Kennedy seems as likely as any other

explanation.

cerning CIA raised by Mr. Hoch. They are keyed to the page on

Did CIA intercept a letter and money order which Uswald's

mother sent to him shortly after he defected to Russia?

Answer:

No. CIA did not intercept a letter and money order sent to

Oswald by his mother shortly after his defection. Mr. Hoch's

question probably refers to a matter taken up by Mrs.

Marguerite Oswald with the FBI on 28 April 1960 and described

in the 12 May 1960 report

by the Dallas FBI office in Tab 2 .

What dissemination in CIA was made of the FBI report "Fair Play

for Cuba Committee--New Orleans Division" which dealt only with

Oswald and "A. J. Hidell," Oswald's alias?

Other than this

report, were any CIA employees or informants aware of Oswald's

activities in New Orleans?

Answer:

A copy of this report is attached at Tab 3. It was transmitted

to CIA by the FBI under a cover note dated 8 November 1963..

The

date stamp on the reverse of the cover sheet indicates it was

logged in to the Agency on 12 November 1963. The DDP Counter-

intelligence Staff liaison office received it on 15 November

1963.

The report then went to the counterintelligence office

of the DDP Special Activities Staff which was then concerned with

Cuban matters

(no date indicated). The registry for the Special

Activities Staff

counterintelligence office handled the report

on 21 November

1963. On 22 November 1963, the report was

received by the DDP Counterintelligence Staff special investi

gations office,

presumably because it concerned a former defector

to the soviet

Union. Apparently it was being processed by that

office when President Kennedy was assassinated. Prior to the

assassination,

CIA had no information concerning Oswald's

activities in

New

Orleans beyond this report.

With David Ferrie? With other associates of Banister?

Answer:

According to CIA records, during 1960 Guy Banistei operated a

private detective agency in New Orleans called Banister and

Associates.: CIA considered contacting him for use as

a foreign

intelligence source and for possible use of his firm for cover

purposes: However, security investigation revealed derogatory

information

about his professional conduct, and he was not

contacted. With regard to Mr. Ferrie, Agency files indicate that

CIA never considered contacting him for any purpose at any time.

Was Oswald ever a CIA informant?

Was he debriefed by CIA in

MOScow?

on his return from the USSR? If not, any particular

reason?

Did CIA ever receive in whole or in part Oswald's

manuscript about his life in Russia? Is #110669 an identifying

number used by CIA in any way?

Answer:

Lee Harvey Oswald was never associated or connected, directly

or indirectly, in any way

whatsoever with CIA (see Tab 4 for

testimony of John A. McCone and Richard Helms before Warren Com-

mission and Affidavit of John A. McCone). As a former marine

and as a returned defector, he was of primary interest to

military authorities and to the FBI who were responsible for any

debriefings of him upon

his return from the USSR. CIA received

copies of Oswald's manuscript from the FBI and the Warren Com-

mission in the

material disseminated by them after the

assassination. The number 110669 is not a CIA identification

number of Lee Harvey Oswald for any purpose including registration

as a source. Within CIA records, the number 110669 identifies

an individual of Austrian birth who was of intelligence

interest

in East Asia during the 1940's. The Inter-Agency Source

ISR for both Oswald's name and the number 110669. His name and

that number are not registered in the ISR.

Answer:

We have had previous communications with Mr. Hoch concerning

this matter (see Taù 5).

The Agency at no time in its dealings with the FBI in the

Field or with the Warren Commission in Headquarters described

or suggested that the unknown individual whose photograph was

taken'in Mexico City on 1 October was

Lee Harvey OSWALD. Our

total coverage of the unknown individual numbers twelve photo-

graphs taken on 1 October (USSR Embassy), 4 October (USSR

Embassy) and 15 October (Cuban Embassy). OSWALD left Mexico

City, it is known, at 0830 hours, 2 October. It is clear,

therefore, that this individual could not be OSWALD. Mr.

Helms, in a memorandum to

the Warren Commission Chief Counsel,

indicated

very clearly that the photograph of this unknown

individual had nothing to do with the OSWALD case. In the

light of all of the facts in the file, we find no reason to

nodify this judgment.

Mexican intercept operations: Did CIA have recordings of calls

between Cuban and Soviet Embassies in which Oswald

is discussed

or in which Oswald participated?

Did we have a recording of

Oswald's conversation with a guard at the Soviet Embassy?

Answer:

CIA has transcripts of such calls, including a conversation

between Oswald and a guard at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico

City,

which were made on 27 and 28 September and 1 October

1963. These transcripts were reviewed in their entirety by

the Warren Commission

at CIA Headquarters and in Mexico City

at the Station in April 1964. The recordings were erased

routinely after the transcripts were made.

Oswald identified

himself only in the course of the 1 October conversation, and

a summary of that conversation was the

first indication of his

presence in Mexico reported by the Station on 8 October 1963

and disseminated by CIA Headquarters on 10 October 1963.

Who had substantial knowledge of matters pertaining to Oswald

in the CIA Station in Mexico City at the time of Oswald's

visit there? Was E. Howard Hunt the acting chief of station

in Mexico City at or

near that time?

Answer:

The operations which produced the transcripts of the calls con-

nected with Oswald on 27 and 28 September and 1 October 1.963

were

aquite closely held at the station.. Few people beyand the

chief and his deputy, one or two senior officers, and the

monitor would have been privy to the material.

E. Howard Hunt

served in Mexico City from December 1950 to June

1951: From November 1960 until his retirement in 1970, he was

assigned to Headquarters. During the period in which Mr. Hunt

was alleged by Mr. Hoch to have been acting chief of station in

Mexico City--August-September 1963--Mr. Hunt was assigned to

DDP desk at Headquarters. See Tab 6

for documents covering Mr.

Hunt's activities then. (Mi. Hunt made one extended trip to.

There was no formal "study," but there was inter-agency

What actions did CIA take in Dallas

or in Washington after

Kennedy was shot or after Oswald was arrested?

Answer:

A special cable channel was established at headquarters to

insure that all correspondence concerning Oswald would be con-

trolled in a central repository. The resultant correspondence

was subsequently incorporated into the Oswald file which was

reviewed in

full by the Warren Commission.

Extensive investi-

gative and analysis work was performed by the Agency in coordi-

nation with other Government agencies and with the Warren Com-

mission.

Following the assassination of President Kennedy, DCI McCone

instructed the Domestic Contact Service (DCS) to send an

officer from its Dallas office to Parkland Hospital to contact

and offer assistance to the FBI

and Secret Service. ' Mr. Linwood

Davis of that office went immediately to the hospital where he

identified himself to the FBI and offered his services during

the emergency.

To date, our file review shows no indication

that any particular use was made of Mr. Davis at that time.

assassination.

That file had been opened as a

result of

Oswald's defection to the Soviet Union.

At the time of the

assassination the Warren Commission reviewed and received a

-copy, of

that file in its entirety. As the Agency

continued

to cooperate with the

Commission, the Oswald file grew. It

numbers 58 volumes now and contains all information in

possession of the Agency on Oswald or his family.

The single exception to the above statement concerns one

HTLINGUAL document dated 8 July 1961 but discovered only on

review triggered by press publicity following the Oswalds'

return to the U. S. in June 1962. The sensitivity of this

intelligence precluded its inclusion in the Oswald file in

general circulation. However, a copy of the document was

forwarded to the FBI immediately upon discovery. (Also see

question concerning Marina Oswald keyed to p. 14 of Mr.. Hoch's

memorandum.)

Was

there any FBI-CIA liaison concerning Oswald's intention

to attend Albert Schweitzer College in Switzerland?

Was

there any CIA intelligence interest in the school during that

period?

Answer:

Information concerning Oswald's intention to attend Albert

Schweitzer College in Switzerland was passed to CIA by the

the report of the FBI's interview with Mrs. Marguerite

C. Oswald on 28 April 1960 (see pp

5-6 of that report in lab 2).

A search of CIA files has revealed no CIA knowledge of an

Albert Schweitzer College in Switzerland.

Has CIA had any contact with Marina Oswald and are there any

CIA records on her not previously turned over to the Warren

Commission.

Answer:

CIA has had no contact with Marina Oswald.*

Our records

show

that a complete set of HTLINGUAL documents on Marina were

turned over by hand to Mr. Sam Papich of the FBI on

23 November 1963 for use by the FBI in the course of their

investigations. One other HTLINGUAL document received after

that date was passed

to the FBI in September 1964.

To

date,

we have found no

record indicating that CIA also passed these

documents to the Warren Commission; nor do we have any

record

of how they were used by the FBI during the Warren Commission

investigations.

CIA informant?

Answer:

The unidentified man who accompanied Mr. Helms to the 12 March

1964 meeting was Mr. David E. Murphy, then Chief of the Soviet

Russia Division, DDP. See paragraph 6 of the lab 9 memorandum

of reçord of this meeting for Mr. Helms'.

Has CIA pursued independent investigations

of the assassination

and developed any new information not already provided to the

Warien Commission, the Justice Department, or other responsible

authority? For example, what use did the Agency make of the :

Zapruder film?

30

Answer:

As noted by Mr. Helms in the course of his testimony before the

Warren, Commission (see Tab 4, PP 123-124), the case of Lee Harvey

Oswald and the assassination of President Kennedy is not closed

and "will never be closed" as

far

as the Agency is concerned.

CIA has

continued to be

alert for new information abroad concerning

this

matter, and the Oswald file has grown over the years. The

follow-up in Mexico City was particularly active during the

1960's. Throughout this period, no credible information has been

developed which would substantially change the conclusions of

the Warren Commission report. Any substantive information developed

independently by the Agency has been shared with appropriate

authorities, in particular the FBI.

A copy of the Zapruder film was acquired by CIA from Time, Inc.,

at

the request of the Office of Training in February 1965. The

agreement with Time, Inc., specified "'..this film will not..

be exhibited or published in any fasion except for internal

training..." The Agency has adhered to these restrictions on

the use of the

Film. From 1965 to 1969, the film was viewed by

some officials in the Office of Iraining. Since April 1969, the

Has CIA ergaged in any activities regarding critics of the

Warren Report, including dissemination of infornation about

them?

Answer:

Tab Il contains a copy of Book Dispatch 5847 which transmitted

guidance to certain CIA stations and bases concerning the

countering of criticism of the Warren Report. This guidance

for the field was prepared in response

to a rash of books

and

articles criticizing the Commission's findings. It was

sent out in April 1967. Our investigations to date have

turned up no other guidance

or activities undertaken in this

connection.

Answer:

Our file search to date has revealed no information concerning

these two addresses. However, we are not satisfied that all

lossible CIA records have been consulted. A final report

concerning this question will be forwarded

helping hin in that activity. Prior to his

arrest Amador Odio

Padron had been the owner of Cuba's largest inter-provincial

trailer truck concern.. (In fact, our records indicate that

he had used his trucking concern

to smuggle arms to anti-

Battista forces during the 1954-56 period.) During the mid-

1960's, Cesar Odio made several attempts to secure the release

of his parents by offering to purchase large quantities of

spare parts and transport them to Cuba.

The identities of the three men who reportedly visited Sylvia

Odio two months prior to the

assassination of President Kennedy

were established in the course of

the Warren Commission

investigation. (See Report of The President's Commission on

the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, U. S. Government

Dallas. However, there is a Hollandale Lane in Farmers

Branch, Texas -- a suburb of Dallas. Numbers on Hollandale

Lane run from 2800 to 3028. There is no 3126. In 1963, one

Lloyd Humphreys resided at -3028 Hollandale Lane, the last

house on the street. CIA has no record on Lloyd Humphreys.

SUBJECT: Webster, Robert Edward

1. Subject was born in Tiffin, Ohio on 23 October 1928.

Attended Edinboro Teachers College in Pennsylvania and Geneva

College in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania and the Carnegie Institute of

Technology in Pittsburs, Pennsylvania. He served in the United

States Navy during WW II, and was employed as a plastics technician

by Rand Development Corporation in Cleveland Ohio.

2. In the spring of 1958, Subject went to Moscow for the

opening of the SOKOLNIKI Fair. While there he was a demonstrator

for a Rand Development Corporation plastic display in the American

exhibit at the Fair. He disappeared in Moscow on 10 September 1959,

after he assisted in packing up the display upon completion of the Fair.

On 17 October 1959, Subject showed up in Moscow and signed a

statement to the United States Consul General renouncing his American

citizenship. In March 1960, and on a number of later occasions,

Subject wrote his father requesting assistance in returning to the

United States. At that time he was working in a scientific institute in

Leningrad. He was allowed to return to the United States in May 1962.

3.. A check of Agency records has not revealed that Webster

has ever been used in any capacity by this Agency or ever been given

any type of clearance. Consideration was being given in late May 1959

and early June 1959 for a debriefing of Webster in regard to his

proposed travel to the USSR. However, Webster was not contacted

prior to his departure for the USSR. On his return to the United States

in 1962 Subject was debriefed by Agency Officers to obtain Soviet

Realities data.

4. It is interesting to note that Subject and Lee Howard Oswald

both defected in 1959 and redefected in 1962. Webster was formerly

in the Navy and Oswald was formerly in the U.S. Marines.
