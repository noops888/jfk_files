1. This memorandum is in response to the request in

paragraph 4 of Reference A.

CCS maintains a file on one of the 24 individuals

identified in Reference B, as follows:

E. Howard Hunt - Approximately 100 documents con-

cerning the establishment

maintenance and use of

cover for subject during his Agency career as a staff

employee from 1949 to 1970, and, concerning subject's

participation in Watergate

inquiries from 1972 to 1977.

With respect to the

period 1958-1963.

resignation from the Foreign Service following assign-

ment to Uruguay, and a memorandum requesting appointment

consolidated into a single numbered file system, begun

circa 1967.

We have ascertained that DDA/OP/SPD/MPB

holds a file on Col. Ayers.

Frank Sturgis aka Frank Fiorini - The index

card leads to a memorandum for the DDo, dated

8 May 1974, Subject:

Agency File Review on Watergate,

which states that no indexed reference and no leads to

information on Sturgis aka Fiorini were found in CCS.

In order to further identify Captain William Morgan

(Item 13, Reference B), a middle initial and/or date of birth

Is required - CCS has several index cards on William Morgans.

As agreed between Mr. Shepanek and Mr. Latta of this

office in a discussion on 20 January 1978, relevant CCS files,

in this case that of Mr. Hunt, can be made

in CCS by an appropriately cleared HSCA Staff member.
