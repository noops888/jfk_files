HUNT, Everett Howard, Jr.

1.

In his book, Give Us This Day ("The Inside Story of

the CIA and the Bay of Pigs Invasion..."), on pages 98-103,

Everett

Howard HUNT, Jr., gives an account of some of the

activities of Pedro Luis DIAZ LANZ who defected from Castro

Cuba in mid-1959 as the first chief of Castro's air force.

HUNT points out that in October 1959 DIAZ LANZ piloted a

snall plane dumping hundreds of anti-Castro leaflets over

Havana.

DIAZ LANZ'S

copilot on the flight is identified as

Frank FIORINI, aka: Frank STURGIS. HUNT goes on to describe

what would appear to be personal contacts with DIAZ LANZ in

the Miami area.

utilizing the services of Bernard BARKER in

nis contacts with DiAL LANz and other Cubans.

HUNT further

describes his attempts to involve DIAZ LANZ with the Agency

in the invasion, but HUNT's overtures were not accepted by

Headquarters.

The concluding paragraph of this account states:

"After the invasion the Kennedy Administration

could not do enough for Manuel RAY... A cozy post

was secured for him in Puerto Rico as Chief of

Munoz Marin's housing projects.

equal effort was made in behalf of Pedro Luis DIAZ

LANZ, for our national tradition has become one of

shabby discrimination against known anti-Conmunists."

NOTE:

HUNT's contacts with DIAZ LANZ occurred

during the period circa October 1960 to circa

November 1961 while HUNT was assigned to JMARC,

Miami.

Office of Security files #202 792 and 351 502

concern Pedro Luis DIAZ LANZ but reveal no use of DIAZ LANZ

in the Cuban invasion or other Agency operational matters.

File #202 923 concerns Marcos DIAZ LANZ, the brother of

Pedro Luis DIAZ LANZ.

The file reflects that Marcos DIAZ

LANZ was the Deputy Chief of Castro's air force until his

defection in July 1959, effected by this Agency by his

exfiltration from Cuba clandestinely.: For the purposes of

instant memorandum, it is of note that this file contains an

Agency Information Report stating, "According to Colonel Oscar

MORALES Lopez, Chief of Aviateca--the Guatemalan government-

owned airline--Commandante Pedro Luis DIAZ LANZ, former inspector

of the Cuban rebel airforce, Captain Sergio DIAZ, and Captain

Frank FIORIII, also formerly with the rebel airforce, arrived

in Guatemala on 30 December (1959) and immediately contacted

They had a card from the Guatemalan Ambassador in

Washington and said that they had been in the United States

the first part of December and had talked with important

officials of the government.

The three wanted to talk with

President Miguel YDIGORAS Fuentes to obtain moral support for

their anti-Castro activities."

There is information showing

the mutual involvement of Frank FIORINI with the DIAZ LANZ

brothers in anti-Castro activities until at least the summer

of 1963.

Information in the file of Frank Anthony STURGIS,

aka:

Frank FIORINI (#353 459), reflects that from circa

May 1960 to at least January 1961, STURGIS was living in the

Miami area training a group of Cuban and American volunteers

for a military

invasion of Cuba.

By October 1960, the FBI

had determined that STURGIS's only activities in anti-Castro

matters were in conjunction with the activitles oi Pedro DiAL

LANZ, who was one of the leaders of the anti-Castro group,

"Liberation Alliance." Reportedly, STURGIS' invasion group

in January 1961 was calling itself,

"Brigada Internacionale,"

with variations of "International Anti-Communist Brigade" and

"Anti-Connunist International Brigade.". One of the sub-units

of the "Brigade" was identified in the press in July 1961 as

being

a paratroop unit called "Intercontinental Penetration

Force" or INTERPEN. The Commander of INTERPEN was identified

as Gerald Patrick HEMMING, JI., (#429 229) • The Office of

Security file of STURGIS contains nothing

further until October

1958, when his arrest was announced in October 1968--while still

heading the "International Anti-Connunist Brigade"--for his

involvenent in a group attempting to enter Guatemala to

"clean out anti-Guatemalan guerrillas.".

At that time FIORINI

claimed that two men who were sponsoring his operation were

Bob MOWELL, allegedly a friend of the Kennedy family, and a

General BIDDLE, member of the (John) Birch Society.

4.

To return to the events of the early 1960's, in

July 1952 an article appeared in the New Orleans States Item

by Bill STUCKEY, concerning an anti-Castro training base

established on

the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain.

This

unit was identified as INTERPEN, headed by Gerald Patrick

HEMMING, JI.

The article inferred that INTERPEN was still

part of

Frank FIORINI's (STURGIS) "International Anti-Communist

Brigade.

This particular unit received nationwide publicity

in 1957 when New Orleans District Attorney GARRISON alleged

that INTERPEN

was involved in the assassination of President

John F. KENNEDY and that INTERPEN members were

connected with

CIA.

5. The above noted Bill STUCKEY who wrote the July 1962

press article about INTERPEN and HEMMING is identical with the

Willian Stuckey who interviewed Lee Harvey OSHALD during a public

broadcast in New Orleans in August 1963.

According to testimony

in the Warren Conmission hearings by William STUCKEY and Carlos

3RINGUIER (Cuban Student Directorate delegate in New Orleans):

in early August 1963, Lee Harvey OSWALD came to BRINGUIER'S

New Orleans clothing store announcing that he, OSWALD, was a

former Marine trained in guerrilla warfare who wanted

to join

an anti-Castro guerrilla group in New Orleans. (NOTE: Many

a Hached,

countered OSWALD on

the streets of New Orleans passing out

"Fair Play For Cuba" leaflets. The encounter led to a disturb- 7

ance, and OSWALD and BRINGUIER were arrested. BRINGUIER subse-

quently alerted STUCKEY to OSWALD which resulted in the broadcast

interview.

It is of note that BRINGUIER inferred he was know-

ledgeable

of the anti-Castro guerrilla group training on the

north shore of Lake Pontchartrain and even collected funds for

the travel of two of the members to Miami when the group was.

disbanded.

6.

The individual in INTERPEN of most interest to GARRISON

was

Loran Eugene HALL, aka: Lorenzo PASCILLO, aka:

Skip HALL

(0S#348 527), who ostensibly arrived in Dallas, Texas, in October

1963, remaining until after President KENNEDY was shot.

GARRISON also alleged that HALL was involved with the

"Minutenen."'

The HALL file reflects that in August 1963

HALL was in Southern California, where he spoke before

numerous neetings of the John Birch Society attempting to

raise fuds for an anti-Castro planned invasion of Cuba

scheduled for mid-September 1953.

7. In June 1972 Frank STURGIS, E. Howard HUNT, Bernard

BARKER, and others were arrested while burglarizing the

headquarters of the Democratic National Committee at the

Watergate, Washington, D.C.
