Mr. Richard A. Sprague

Special Counsel

House Office Building

Washington,

D.C.

Dear Mr. Sprague,

I am a senior at Hollins College, studying English,

in Roanoke, Virginia.

lour name was given to me through

the office

oi Thomas N. Downing, who is our representative.

I am very interested in the work that you are doing in

the research of the assinations of Kennedy and Martin I

Luther King. During the month of January, Hollins has its

short term,

which is a period devoted to an independent

study or internship of

some sort. I wonder if I could

help you in some way.

It would be an "internship," with

no pay, beginning about January 7. Do you have need or

interest in any such help?

I look forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you.

Sincerely,

Liza Saunders
