C. Prior to Diaz' departur, the Cuban Air Force had purchased one

C-46 and one B-25 aircraft in the Miant area. The aircraft

are in BYERS' custody at present, but are in Fiorini's nave.

This was done to circumvent refusal of the United States

Government to grant export licenses. Until 7 July Florini

kas attempting to force BYERS to sell the aircraft and turn

the money over to him (Fiorini).

Do On 8 july, togetner with Sergio Dtaz, Florini asked BYERS

to hold onto the C-u6 and sell the B-25. Both men said

they would need the C-l6 for their revolutionary plans.

E. The Cuban Air Force, according to BYERS, is aware of the

situation concerning the two aircraft and sill probably

attempt to forestall any disposition other than one which

will give then ultimate possession of the planes.
