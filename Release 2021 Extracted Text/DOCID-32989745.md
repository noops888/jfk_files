cAste 611-17-16022

Re FBIHQ teletype to Atlanta, Birmingham, Chicago,

Los Angeles, Miami, New Orleans, and St. Louis, 8/18/77.

Atlanta is furnishing FBIHQ, under separate cover,

two xerox copies each of 3250 Atlanta documents relative

to captioned matter.

Referenced Bureau teletype pointed out that the!"

House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) which is

investigating the assassinations of JOHN F. KENNEDY and

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., had requested access to investigative

files of recipient

field offices concerning the Bureau's

investigation of the assassination of KING (code name MURKIN.).

FBIHQ instructed that recipient offices using

the criteria set forth on page 2 of referenced teletype,

furnish FBIHQ with two xerox copies of the MURKIN investigative

file.

Based on the above, Atlanta noted that it had

a main 44 file on MURKIN, namely 44-2386, consisting of

23 volumes (2495 serials), plus subfiles B (1 volume -

bulky exhibits), C (1 volume - xerox copies of Atlanta transmittal

In addition, Atlanta had a racial matter case on the assassination

of MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., Atlanta file 157-3094 which

consisted of 3 volumes (266) serials and appears to have

been a repository of information regarding KING's assassination,

the KING funeral, etc., prior to the opening of the Atlanta

Atlanta has reviewed all the above files and volumes

and two xerox copies of each serial in these files are being

Although the reason as to why the serial numbers

are missing is not determinable, it is felt that all could

be simply the result of mis-serializing.

This theory is

supported indirectly by the fact that some numbers have

been used more than once within this same file without

having been discovered until this review of the file.

The enclosed serials have been separated according

to the respective volumes from which they cáme: and

arranged

chronologically.

Serials 495 and 496 are copies of California

Identification Records for HARVEY EDWARD LOHMEYER and THERAL

BURNS LYMAN respectively.

These serials are actually enclosures

to Serial 497, an airtel to Memphis, 'however, they have

been xeroxed and enclosed to maintain continuity in chronology.

UACB, this matter is considered RUC.

Assistart Attorney General

Criminal Division

Attention: Mr. Robert L. Keuch

NOTE: This scale model, presently in custody of the visual

Presentation Unit, Special Projects Section, consists of two

parts, a large scale model of the flop house from where Ray

fired

the shot and a smaller model of the entire block of

the crime scene.

Both parts were used extensively during the

trial of Ray.

Although introduced as evidence in the trial,

the District

lennessee, Left

Section Chief R. I. Strain, Special Projects Section,

advised that final authority

of the model by the HSCA

would rest with the Department of Justice. This authority was

provided verbally by Mr. Keuch on 6/6/77, to SA Aldhizer of

the Congressional Inquiry Unit. Personnel of the Special Projects

Unit prefer to deliver,

set. up

and retrieve the scale model in

order to provide careful handling.

Original blueprints from which

the model was constructed are retained in Bureau files.

Since there are no legal problems in loaning the model.

and Department authority has been obtained, HSCA cooperation

in this situation is warranted.

The HSCA has advised Mr. Keuch

that the model will be useful In interviewing its witnesses. In

request Of Mr. Stokes sald the model would be returned upon

the Department or after its use by the HSCA, whichever

comes first. HSCA staff offices are located in the old

Identification Division building.

This matter has been coordinated with sA strain,

Laboratory Division ana SA P. V: Daly, Legal Counsel Division.

Mr. Keuch has advised no letterhead memorandum to the HSCA is

necessary since he is coordinating delivery of the scale model.

This 1s Officcr Clifton baird. The next voice you will hcar

will be that of Arlic Blair (phonetic) and nyself."

A conversation then takes place on this tape roportealy

botween Baird and Arlie.

After sone idle chatter, Baild and

arlie,

in essence, say the fallowing regarding King:

Baird

"Talking cbout Martin luther King the other night, who

is it you know who wants him knocked off?' Arlic replies,

"Somebody"

... "a lot of then that want hin krocked off.*

baird agrecs and says there are only two organizations that

the "Cormunist Farty and the

arlie says

Daird agrees and says "

Baird says ''..I don't know, I

just don't want no part in it, do you?

I sure don't."

says "the only way I yould opcrate is if the toney was right -

which I ain't even involved, not now and I don't intend tò

It is noted that part of the examination by our

Technical Sorvices Division suggents that the "introduction".

(on this tape roportcaly nade by baird as set forth above) 'may

havo been inserted over the cxisting recording but a hore

definitive conclusion on this point cannot be reached without

developing and axamining the magnetic patterns on the aSCA tapc.

There is no further reference to Martin InthoI King

on this tape, lother than the infoimation on Pages 2-5 of the

enclosed renorandum summarized above) and no mention is made

of the FBI.

You were previously advised in my APril 5, 1977,

monorandun that the only reference in the files of the FBI tó

lix. Baird is that he was the cubject of a civil rights brutality

complaint in 1963.

The only referenco to an Arlie Ilair (or Pair)

in the files of FBI Leadquarters and our Iouisville Office is that

an Arlie Dlair, an officer of the souisville police department vas

the subjoct of a civil rights brutality complaint in 1957, Insuf-

ficient identifying data exists to know whother or not the Arlie

plair reportedly mentioned on this tape is identical with the

Arlie Blair who was the subject of this 1957 civil rights complaint.

The following is a transcript of a tape (which

was difficult to understand due to poor quality) made avail-

able by Mi. James Chenowich of the House Select Committee On

Assassinations on 4/29/77:

Side 1 of Tape

(Dotted lines denote words that are unintelligible.)

Baird - Today is September 20, 1965, on September 18,

Officer Blair (or Bair) (phonetic), riding home with me while

his car was

broke down

made the offer to me said he belonged

to an organization that wanted Martin Luther King killed.

•The

price he mentioned was $500,000 to anyone killing this man. I

refused the offer and tonight I will attempt to find out who

made this offer.

I will see if Officer Bair (or Blair) wants

a ride home tonight while his car is broken down. This is

Officer Clifton Baird. The next voice you will hear will be

that of Arlie Blair (phonetic) and myself.

Arlie - Well anyway me and him is gonna have to

have a little conversation---and I believe we can do it.

Baird - Down in the Carolina's?

Arlie - That's right.

Baird - When are you gonna get to see him? What

did he do to you?--

Arlie - The guy ain't done nothing to me yet.

I

just want to whip his ass.

Don't like his looks.

Think I

ought to take him up and kick him around.

Baird - Who is he?

Arlie - My nephew.

Baird - Your nephew? That's the one who's gonna

drive the truck with you, is it?

Arlie - I don't know if I did?

Baird - With him? You're talking about your nephew,

shit, you've been talking about us for three years.

a man, round nat to coho

Arlie - He's the only (scene obscene) I have met that's

a man, not because he's my nephew... he's the only son-of-

a-bitch I have met that is come out of the hills faster by God

than since the last well

• since I have been big enough to

know what. a, man is.---

Just like on a rain pole when that old

goddamn mule was marred.

You remember that shit real well.

I don't know what those obscene obscene) gonna do.

I know

them son-of-a-bitches is dogs.

That's right. I talked to

them; not to Bill but to Wood.--

Baird - Do you know what universal is?---

Arlie - When you can run

'em like that, go down and

have all that has money.

Baird - Well, they didn't know a damn thing about

trucks when they started.

Rafold (phonetic) was suppose to

have been a truck driver before he had come to the police

department.

and that sort ut, I think all he ever drove was farm trucks

But I don't think Rafold (phonetic)

ever drove the real commercial trucks, I don't think he knew

anything about then.

Arlie - I wouldn't doubt it..

Baird - They just took his opinion, that's all it

was.—-- They worked about six months and that outfit took

them

for everything they could get out of them and when they

went broke, why they picked it up.

Arlie - That's another thing, if you are gonna

hold out, you gotta take more out than

you need.

You know

that?

Baird - Oh yeah.

Arlie - That's right. Yes sir.

See when you work

them lathes (phonetic), there is no proverb if best of all.

Every time I talk about it, I get a kick out of that. You

know someone

• told us about

that black whiskey. You know

what I mean?...

Baird - . . . running them trucks, you gotta know

something

about it, you know, you can't just go into it blind.

Arlie - It's the easy thing you got Cliff. You

gotta have the guts . . .

Baird - Arlie, not to change the subject. You know

we were talking

about Martin Luther King the other night.

Who

in the (obscene) is it you know who wants the son-of-a-bitch knocked

Arlie - Huh?

Baird - Talking about Martin Luther King the other

night, who is it you know who wants him knocked off?

Arlie - Somebody.

•Baird - Well, Arlie, here's the thing about it.

Arlie - A lot of them that want him knocked off.

Baird - Oh yeah, there is a lot of people, yeah, I

agree with you.

Arlie -

Baird - But here is the thing about it, there is

only two organizations that would have that much money it

would be the Communist Party and the Ku Klux Klan and he

couldn't trust anyone of them.

Arlie - No.

Baird - So I am going to tell you. The best thing

you can do is to forget them.

(Noise of banging)

Baird - Backfires.

Arlie - I understand.

Baird - Because that son-of-a-bitch I am telling

you Martin Luther King is a big

son-of-a-bitch.

Arlie - Oh, he can be had.

Baird - He can be had, ya, that's right but when

you do; here's the thing

about it Arlie, when you do, you

have to start a civil war, probably.

Arlie - Right now that's about the best thing we

can have ...

a civil war.

'Bairâ - But here's the thing about it, its probably

coming it anyway.

agree

with you, it's probably coming.

But

that would start it I imagine.

Arlie - You know a funny thing Cliff.

Baird - But I tell you Arlie, I don't know, I just

don't want no part in it, do you? I sure don't.

Arlie - The only way I would operate is if the

money was right-which I ain't even involved, not now and I

don't intend to be.

The only

way I would be involved if I

went looking for it, and if I

went looking for it, of course

I went looking for it I would know uh----a number.

Baird - Well, I tell you Arlie, that Martin Luther

King is big and it will probably start a civil war.

I don't

know who it is that made this offer to you, but boy I tell

you, just forget it, because it is shit, it might start

something that 10 million people get killed : . : women,

kids, children, old ladies, old men, everybody else. But

the bastards like you and I, it don't amount to much . .

I mean you know we're superficial, I mean we can be replaced;

we will be replaced so will everybody... I mean everybody

will be replaced sometime or another.

Arlie - The thing about it is I ain't gonna worry

about it.

At one time . .:. let me you know---.

Baird - No, I'm not either Arlie.

Arlie - I don't know what them is.

Baird - You know all I want. .

Arlie - No, I know what you're thinking about Cliff.

And I think he misimproved me the other day on the. My good

With what I said, if I can kill you

without question the good----oh anyone else would like to know.

Without being caught.

Baird - Well here is the thing about it.

Arlie - I could.

Baird - Arlie, Arlie, the only people that wanted

Martin Luther King knocked off is

two people.

Arlie - Right.

Baird - I mean with one half million dollars is the

Communist Party which they would do it just to start a bunch

of crap, you know, and Ku Klux Klan.. they would do it

just out of revenge.

Ah--you know, to get

even or to keep

colored people down.

But I am gonna tell you Arlie, I

don't exactly sympathize with colored people.

I think most

of them could do better if they tried.

90% of them could do

better but you know down south in Alabama and Mississippi,

colored people are accustomed to--.

They are not allowed

to walk on the damn street or anything else. They have no

voice in the Government and you know here is why Hitler didn't

like the colored people.

They took all the shit and they

didn't have backbone to fight back. That was his sole reason

for hating colored people.

Arlie - That's the thing I think we ought to get

together now on.

I even had the chance now we can make a

deep voice.

That is why not we don't want those colored

folks down in South Carolina.

Baird - That's it. That's right. Why don't they

move up north.

That's it, I would, wouldn't you?

Arlie - No---

Baird - No, I tell you, this world can't stay much

longer like it is with the shit they got now. This world,

it's not for long.

You know the Bible's right, it's gonna

end in fire alright.

Arlie - You know the funny thing I like is that a

lot of people think I'm nuts but un I wonder why?----

Pity man that walks out on this earth. He can make a rock

about " or & million pounds of rock..

I am not going nowhere

I don't want it here in my living room.

But, I don't believe

man himself want to destroy this world. I don't really know

cliff.

Baird - I do Arlie, I believe man

is destroying

himself.

Arlie - I don't think so because I will tell you

why. Is there a

little meat in this place? He tells me

where to go.

----and someone said no one knows how we would .

look, the angels had said this.

No, no one else wants to

take your place. Man himself would

not destroy this earth.

You can forget

about that. Man has not enough sense.

Man

has made the h-bomb.

They can destroy about anything.

I

would tell you what I believe.

I don't think man himself will

blow this damn world up. I don't believe he can do it.

Baird - I don't know : . .

Arlie - If man himself wants to destroy the world,

the angels in heaven would ignore him. Wonder that man woul

want to destroy himself.

The Democratics come up with some

goddamn sharp place for a change.

Arlie - No he ain't. I bet you a hundred and one he

Baird - At least part of them.

Arlie - Maybe I ought to know, I ought to care myself,

if you want me to.

Baird - Well Arlie I don't know. I don't have the facts

to back me up.

But I'd say it's really - I don't have the facts

to back me up but I would say no use calling all the plays now

that's my opinion.

Arlie - He's, no it's -- I know what you're thinking

about.

He is calling the gas ghetto. Namely not a book and ah,

what can I say -, two or three other guys

But the idea you have to do Cliff you have to have a leader of

Baird - Well Ed Shoring (phonetic) is he's the one pulling

ühe thing together.

The minute you get older you don't like

stuff sweet you want something bitter.

•You get up to a certain

age you start liking pepsis or cokes.

Which are, cokes reminds a

little on the sweet side.

Pepsi's got a little more of a tang to

it. But then you get to

the point you don't like them.

Now then

you want something that's got kind of a, more of a bitter taste.

Baird - Yeah, like, ah, when I was 21, 22 years old I

had to have a drink and I'd

it with coke or ginger ale or

seven up or something, you know something sweet. And now I want

my yellowstone in water.

Arlie - Yeah.

Baird - I don't want anything sweet. And when I was

a kid I used to drink coffee all the time.

I drank coffee ever

since I was knee high to a duck and I use to put about four, five

teaspoons full of the damn sugar in It.

Arlie - I didn't put sugar in my coffee.

to knock that bitter

Baird - You know if I was building me another house, you

remember houses like you use to build way back in the country

with oak boards. You'd run them damn things straight up and down,

you know vertical, and then put a slab right over the crack?

Arlie - Yeah.

Baird - I'd like to have one of them damn things with

an over hanging, maybe about two and a half feet, and a great big

rocking chair.

-- tight ---- you know that son-of-a-bitch

would be pretty you know.

Arlie - Yeah.

Baird - But it would cost you a fortune to get that

kind of lumber now you know it.

Arlie - Sure would. I was talking to a guy up there

home, he's still

got à saw mill and a planer, in fact he's got a

----roof, but, ah, the only, the saw mill man I know up

there has got one because, I mean in town I mean there are lumber

companies now.

Baird - Yeah,

they've all got them there.

Arlie - Ah, but this guy I come around there, I was

wanting to buy some,

he built him a little house, of course this

guy made a cabin, heck of nice then, he had a boy that died back

while I was in the high school, heart trouble.

My closest

friend.

They were brothers, two brothers actually, they were so much older

than me and weren't around he wanted to put him in some nice oak

floor and he wanted to know for how much it would cost him for

what he'd need.

And figured out I don't know the - or how

big a house he had but --

___- about 52 or 53. He came over

and said,

well I can get $250 a thousand for the floor. He told

us he don't want pay

__----- for this.

It was just tire, what

you

call tire

sap, we used to

call lü, an inch and a quarter lumber

that we'd knock off the side of the log in getting down to a

square for a tire.

Why rather than cut it all off for a slab,

why I'd just

take off

_---the slab, the log was big enough

- 17 -

L NW 65994 Doca:32989745 Page 76

## Page 77

to make the tire but there'd be

enough on the side, actually,

that you'd be wasting.

Then we'd cut off another board there and,

ah, but,

the thing is you've got two saws like that and

you set

them back and forth and you can run your board through

there and it knocks off the two strips on the side.

And that

tire, at that time ran about $50 a thousand and now I imagine it

runs

about $80. That's just rough lumber and that's -- but

if you've got a doggone --

- you'll take that damn stuff

and make yourseli some nace dogrone.

anything you want.

He told

those guys he don't want to pay no $250. So I tell you what 1'11

do -

- no way, he'd take

------ logs and he had

•--/

truck and he said if you bring the logs around to

my mill.

He said I'll cut it up for you and run it through. Tell

you what.

You want $20 a thousand for sawing it he said

pay for $I5. So

- $35 a thousand, of course, a man

brings his own lumber in the mill..

We figure well ----

right. there I'd figure it would take 140 X 300, get me about right

close to 500 pieces of lumber for the house. So you figure that

for a man of like up there most people no money anyhow, but $250

that's $125 which the old man just wouldn't had anyway.

Baird .- Yeah.'

Arlie - But he was able to bring it around there and for

about, well it would cost around $18, $20. It's hard to believe

that doggone

tongue groove flooring.

Do you know what, tongue

groove, I don't know what costs around here but I know what it

costs around at home. Tongue groove oak flooring cost you now.

Baird - No, I don't, "but it's expensive I know that.

Arlie - Last job I had is $350 a thousand.

Baird - $350 a thousand

Arlie - 35¢ a foot.

Baird - That's a lot of money. You know Arlie when I

was a boy we bought rough oak lumber $4 or $5 a hundred. I don't

know just exactly what it was.

nicht at Bovie I can remember 1t selling "ha was $30 a thousand.

lumber so, we commonly call it tire sap.

That was

number one grade.

Baird - Yean, -

1ike that now it didn't cost you a fortune.

Where are you going to

get it?

You know Arlie here

a while back I was doing some work

around the house, and, ah, well it's been several years ago, but I

hit some fur two

the house there. Then I went back a couple of weeks later, oh

about a month later I guess, and picked the damn thing, up.

know that damn thing on the

end, a foot up from the ground, it

rotted completely and all that was left there was just a few little

splinters of those hard rings and that was all that was left of

that end.

Now you know when I was a boy we used to see those old

two by fours and you could take one out and throw it out in the

barnyard and that damn thing would lay there for years and it would

curl up and get hard as as a damn piece of steel but it wouldn't rot.

It would lay there and get just as black and just as hard as a, it's

- and all that stuff, it just ah.

•Arlie -

-- which I wanted to see if this brother-

in-law of mine, I told him I thought he was full of shit, but he's

all true force. Up in Last Tennessee, I don't'know, something is

supposed

to be around 70 or 80 miles

out of Kingsport.

supposed to be a boundary of white oak timber.

Four or five

couldn't get it..

I couldn't get that damn shit out of there. Suppose to be first

a group of. white oak timber.

Baird - How many acres is it?.

'Arlie - From what he says there is suppose to be somewhere

in the neighborhood of around 500 acres. That would be a hell

of a lot.

Baird -

- If you could get you some fencing and

fence the damn, put a fence around that and then get you some of

the old razorback hogs and turn them damn things loose and they'll

take care of your damn snakes.

Arlie - No, they say they won't.

Baird - They won't?

Arlie - They said not hogs. Now he said this my brother-

in-law said they was rougher in this area, in this place where we

took timber out of over near.

Baird - Well I mean water falls off the cliff you can two

or three more of you could take his place but a hog would eat a

snake and anything it can get.

Did you know that?

And it don't

make any difference a rattlesnake, copperhead, anything,

And let me tell you I was able to practically

walk up

that damn house out there at that time, and he says 1t's

rougher than that.

Baird - Well I was riding a bus through East Tennessee

one time and, ah, past this cornfield one time and I looked out and

I swear that

thing was on a slope just like that and you could

stand down in the lower row and get the corn off a row below you.

Arlie - Oh, yeah, I done that. (Laughs) But I just wanted

to say, well the funny thing trees are, of course, if there is an

opening on the ground, once the tree gets started it'll run the

coots a long time, the wrong way to get water in there and food

source in

order to get big.

But them white oaks, of course, if

they don't watch the stem what happens your lumber man, on, shit

just a minute, a long time ago they up and the law passed in fact

I think it's

on the books that only ----- they could use the

stays of one half.

cause it --

..

And that's what caused it.

But for a

white oak you couldn't make stays out of that shit if you wanted

to.

That's the crookedest damn bunch of shit I ever seen.

You

can take a white oak, ---- white oak and use ---------- at

the base

and then it'll run straight, it will look

real straight, nice

I don't know how it looks on

making stables, I've never made it on stables out side of grove

timber. None of them guys even tried. They sald you're wasting

your time and I wouldn't doubt it. But you can saw that shit up

& you're

and you can but it in a nice shady spot

where sun can hit it.

See

sun

will draw the boards like it will make them curl and you can

put weights on it and everything else and that damn shit will curl

up, twist up, snarl up.

Baird - Yeah.

use one==.

• Arlie - You can make a two by four or two by six or

anything else you want to out of white oak, satin rope, boy I'll

tell you what you can do if you don't want

it in the yard where

the sun will hit, that's freshly cut today, and I'll bet you by

the day after tomorrow that thing will be bent at least three

foot.

Baird - Yeah.

Arlie - I don't want that to do that.

Baira - Well here's the thing about it Arlie, it's not as

old as the other. That's the trouble.

and the lightening and everything.. They get tough you know, and,

ah, you take something that grows

20 years and it'll get big but it's not as tough as that other.

123

see you take little trees

out there 150 years in the wind, and the rain, and the storms,

In 20 years, a tree that grows

Arlle - No, white oak might be at least 50 years old.

Baird - At least yeah.

Arlle - Cause the good thing on the white oak I'd say

1s not over I'd

say shit 50 years but it would be a lot more

than that,

real fast -

_- board.

Baird - They grow real slow, real big, real strong.

Arlie - Yeah, you take a pine or a poplar that grows

real fast and a len (phonetic) grows lot faster than a poplar.

Baird - A what?

Arlie - A len (phonetic).

Baird - What's that?

Arlie - It's a, actually it looks like a poplar, a form

of a poplar family I guess.

It's real soft.

We call them len

(phonetic) trees and the tree is a little different than a

poplar.

Most of their -- wood is darker.

Most poplars got a

yellow color to them, but they've got a, orange or kind of a bloody

like color to it.

Actually -- One guy up there bought a

bunch of those and sawed one down and I told him, it might make real

pretty --

_-- Mr. Blair.

He was damned suprised alright.

_ stacked up out there. About three weeks before he

went and hauled it off -----

He said that stuff is

already fallen apart.

You can just take your finger and pinch it

through.

Dad said well I told you. But you could take that len,

(phonetic) you could take a board, say about two by four, two by

six and cut you one about foot and a half, two foot long and you

could took one of them with your bare hand and broke it in hall.

Baird - You know poplar is a real light but it is strong

and it'll last forever.

Arlie - Poplar makes good weatherboard, good ceiling

and good _a

lot of people use it for shooting on your --

Baird - Well poplar would be hard to find now anymore.

I imagine it would be harder to find.

Arlie - Yeah ----- there's one stand up at home, I guess

about 40 acres of it, and I don't know what become of it

Baird - You know we're talking about Eastern Kentucky.

What they ought to do is plant trees all over the eastern part

of the state.

You know take place of those coal mines.

Arlie -

Baird - You know what they do? They're

suppose to

reseed this stuff

and have been for years. They'll take a damn

airplane and they'll fly over those, what are they, ah, excavated

but cold you know, and they'll take a handfull of seed

and throw

it out

Arlie - They're as bad as those doggone drunk ------

- you know it.

There's no damn way your going to do it.

You're going to have to go out there and plant them son-of-a-bitches.

Damn, I set out about 5000 in one year up there.

But now they

should have been thinned out, my nephew went and thinned a bunch

of them out

--- up

there. I guess they were up around

20 to 20 some feet. But most

---_-__---- part of 1947

part of the 40's.

These southern pine seedlings, the little

rascals, are about this high.

What happened, I went around and

marked,

set them out in rows four foot wide, four foot apart, but

that's

too close.

What you do you set them

out and you let

: them

get up from 6 to 10 years old

wasn't around 6

years later. Ana you're suppose to go around and, of course, if they

all grow, naturally, I mean it would be, you would take out half of

them. You would take out every other one. In other words to

_ What the hell.

By god, you son-of-a-bitch, the next time

you come in drunk I'll whip your ass again. You've got to be real

quiet she's liable to come over here and want to whip my ass.

Move this damn junk out here.

Baird - I'm kind of tired tonight, for some reason

• I dian't do nothing, rode around all.

Arlie - How would like to have a big sandwich of some kina?

Baird - Oh I'm not even hungry.

Arlie - Ain't got nothing I want.

That one boy of mine,

the oldest of mine, got me kind of worried. Sick the last three

days: can't go to school. My wife

Baird - Sore throat?

Arlie - No he's running a fever.

some of the neighbors

say their kids been sick too. The doctor says there's a virus

going around. Hear this shit all the time virus, virus. That means

them damn son-of-a-bitches don't know what the hell it is causing

It.

Baird - That's right they don't know, don't have any idea.

They've got bacteria pretty well whipped. Virus might be two

or three different things you know.

boom pondi

What they call virus might be

a half a dozen different diseases you know. Well Mr. Blair I guess

Arlie - Head for the housy.

Baird - Head for the housy.

Arlie -

-- that and that

Baird' - That's all right.

Arlie --

-- step on his tail

There's a funny thing about them son-of-a-bitches.

Power is in

comparison to a crop job is lower.

Baird - Well it takes them a lot longer to

Arlie

get the momentum huh?

Baird - Yeah, to build up it's momentum. After It gets

up it's momentum it can go on faster.

Arlie - Oh shit

go faster.

Baird - But a crop for immediate speed and immediate

power he got it.

Shoot when he gets the motor started why he's

got full

power there.

Arlie -

_- won't prove like hell cats.

----; hell cats, during Second World War, It's amazing. Damn,

jets were too damn fast. What was you couldn't get those son-of-

a-bitches .down those doggone valleys.

And them doggone hell cats,

them son-of-a-bitches you could take those bastards down between

roof tops and everything else, damn.

Baird - Those hell cats are very maneuverable. I imagine

top speed is only about

350.

Arlie -

-- 400.

I don't think It was on the first

one but about 300:

Fact is I believe it's 300 or listed at 320,

that's about absolutely top. But that's the different type engine

you got

there.

Baird - Yeah, probably got a more powerful engine now.

Arlie - But still it's maneuvability to be able to

slow down, to slow down about 90. Well hell 90 miles an hour.

..

Baird - I remember during the Korean War Dukes brought

out

this damn biplane at a top speed of probably 120 miles per hour.

Arlie - At the nost.

Baird - And hell we had those saber jets and see them damn.

biplane machine gun troops with that little biplane and those damn

saber jets all of them didn't fire under 500 miles an hour forward.

Arlie - They'd fire under 300.

Baird - It was tilted faster,, they slide a little biplane

up to about 300 miles an hour.

Arlie -

-___- watch the cockpit and they come in

on you like that and you turn around like that and say well

_-- you turn around and you switch, you start to head off like

a diagonally

and.as quick as he starts moving closer starts getting

in gun range of you

they --------out and he's right back the

opposite way. Well when you get back the opposite way you're

going say 60 or 70 miles an hour and he's doing about 200

miles an hour why hell. Where's he at, oh, he's going yonder.

Baird - He's gone up.

Arlie - That's what it 1s. Yeah, and that was something

else. I'd

just

as soon forget about it.

Baird - You have a rough night last night?

Arlie - It wouldn't have been so bad if, except setting

around waiting for my bed four nours.

That Davis and Stuart.

They

running down there to the shoot.

We're here

now

we

everybody died and they still ain't got theirs.

Anyway this one son-of-a-bitch act the right real smarty. That

son-of-a-bitch said there was a guy around

thought it kind of funny.

I seen the guy standing there -------.

Now where he got the (obscene) rifle, I didn't bother and wait and ask

my nephew. Duke, goddamn I don't know what's been wrong with him

me, but he don't drink, so it can't be that.

I've been pulling

right by that son-of-a-bitch near that goddamned gate before he

stops.

I told him about that shit before.

I said you're going

to get us hurt one of these times like that

and Stuart drove by and here came this loud mouth son-of-a-

bitch been carrying on over there.

So Davis walks up and takes his

rifle to this guy.

Well the ruy didn't offer no resistance or

nothing. Young guy I'd say somewhere in about 25's.

We found

out he was a county policeman which we didn't know that at the

Baird - Yeah, I heard something about that. I didn't

know what happened.

Arlie - Well, here's how this son-of-a-bitch up there was

going to whoop this guys ass.

They were shuffling back, stood back

by my desk and I grabbed the (obscene) by the shirt collar and then

reached and

grabbed him by the ass of the britches, that's exactly

where it's at, and headed for the car with him. Took him on

over there in court and hold up your little right hand and swear

to the fact that this damn guy was up there doing the shooting

--- we didn't see no gaddamned shooting.

Baird - That's right you didn't see him.

Arlie - I said that's the things with these young kids.-

I could fabricate something and leave it go. Down there within a

time we can't call up

a---YOU -- yourself and do it.

The son-of-a-bitch he's still on the muscle when you get there you

get on the muscle ten times at home.

Baird - Yeah.

Arlie - But you pull up and leave that son-of-a-bitch

see the police car coming, look at you coming up,

and then if

there's any guilty partner they're gone. If it's anything very

serious the people that still

live will know who it is, right.

was carrying a sun for my use and I started

carrying one for him.

I knew who he was, of course, my mother and dad never did know that.

But this punk, 53 years old, he's trying to come out and tell me

that his 15 year old boy, which is bigger than I am, he don't know

Now if one of my boys comes in and

tells me daddy someone out there tried to shoot me or did shoot at

him I want to know who did it and if they say I don't know the next

thing I'm going to do is to slap them back end quarter or someplace

The following is an examination of this tape by

the Technical Services Division of the Federal Bureau of

Investigation:

Because the HSCA tape was provided for only a

brief period of time, only limited examination of the tape

could be conducted.

The following sets forth results of

examination of the

HSCA tape and technical analysis of the

copy of the tape produced at FBI Headquarters:

Physical inspection of the HSCA tape revealed it

to be standard 1/4-inch wide magnetic tape on a standard

5-inch diameter clear plastic reel. Into the plastic of the

reel was scratched "BFB 1 4-5-77."

The tape had the appearance

of standard 1/2 mil (1 mil = .001 inch) thickness. A measured

playback time of approximately 59.5 minutes at 3 3/4 inches per

second

supports the assumption that the tape is standard 1/2

mil thick.

The tape backing was polyester plastic and no

unusual visual characteristics or coloration of the oxide

were noted.

In summary, the reel of tape furnished appeared to

be commonly available standard tape and of a length within

the expected tolerances of tape manufacturers. This type

of tape would have been available in 1965.

Development of the magnetic patterns on the

beginning of the HSCA tape revealed that it was recorded .

in a 1/2-track configuration, that is, the recorded infor-

mation covers 1/2 the width of the tape.

This is a

standard tape recording configuration.

For the purposes of

convention, the recording of the pertinent conversation will

be referred to as "side l."

There is present on the tape a

second "side" (designated

as "side 2") which is a second

- 27 -

TW 65994 Docld:32989745 Page 86

---

## Page 87

track of recorded information. This information is recorded

backwards relative to side l, indicating the recorder used

was probably 1/2 track monaural.

This again is a standard

recorder configuration and recorders of this type would have

been common in or around 1965.

As indicated previously, the playback time of the

tape at standard 3 3/4 inches per

second speed was measured

to be approximately 59.5 minutes.

The recorded information

on side l and 2 is, however, of substantially shorter duration.

The recordings have the effect of continuously slowing down

causing the voices to drop in pitch and requiring constant

upward speed adjustment of the playback recorder to normalize

the speech.

The observed effect is however opposite to that

which normally occurs when batteries grow weak on battery-

operated recorders.

There might be other explanations for

this effect based upon mechanical considerations of the recorder

transport mechanism but exact cause cannot be determined with-

out specific knowledge of the type of recorder used.

Speed-

correction of the recording revealed that the side 1 recording

was approximately 34 minutes duration.

the conversation on

side I ran off the end of the tape.

The side 2 recording was

measured at approximately 34 1/2 minutes duration and the

conversation terminated prior to the end of the tape.

The following additional information is provided

concerning specific items of interest:

1) Nothing unusual about the physical characteristic.

i the Hsca tape to indicate the age of the recording was

observed.

Some oxide was missing from the very end of the

tape which usually indicates the tape has been used to a con-

siderable extent. It is entirely possible that the tape could

have been used to record a conversation in 1965.

2) There is no clear indication of whether the SCA

tape was an original or a copy. This kind of determination

is dependent upon availability of the recorder used to make

the recording as well as further detailed study of the HSCA

3) The acoustic characteristics of the recording

(reverberation, enhanced low frequency components to the

voices,

extraneous noises) indicate the recording could have

been made in an automobile or other vehicle. •If a remote

microphone was used, it would not be necessary that the

recorder

itself be in the passenger compartment.

At approxi-

mately 21 minutes 23 seconds into side 1, the recording

• indicates Blair to be returning to the vehicle. The sound

- 28 -

TAL 65994. Docld:32989745 Page 87

---

## Page 88

of the vehicle door slamming shut behind him is audible.

Little

other vehicular traitic 1s evident on side .

At

5 minutes 4 seconds a passing vehicle is audible, at s

ninutes 55 seconds a sound similar to squealing tires is

present and at 6 minutes 35 seconds a seriès of distant

explosions is audible to which Baird comments "Backfires."

The side 2 recording was made in an environment

similar to side 1. On side 2 considerable more extraneous

noise is evident.

At 1 minute 3 seconds, 2 minutes 48 seconds

and at 5 minutes

13 seconds traffic is heard to pass.

25 minutes 36 seconds and again at 28 minutes, 44 seconds

jet aircraft are audible and quite pronounced, indicating

the véhicle is parked relatively close to an airport. It

should be kept in mind, however, that sides I and 2 are

independent recordings

and could have been made at substantially

different times.

There is, further, no technical indication of

which side, side l or side 2, was recorded first.

4) It is very likely that the "introduction" did

not occur in sequence with the remainder of the side 1

recording. for approximately 8 seconds prior to the "introduction"

the recorder was activated.

Although no voice is audible

there are audible tones present on the recording.

Frequency

measurement of these tones indicate the tape was running slower

than normal speed and

was continuously decreasing in speed

(discussed previously).

Beginning

8 seconds into the recording and con-

tinuing for another 50 seconds (the segment which includes

the"introduction") the tones suddenly shift upward in

frequency and the recording occurs at normal speed. Immediately

following the "introduction", 58 seconds into the recording,

the tones shift downward in frequency discontinuously to a

point comparable to the first 8 seconds of the recording.

The "introduction" begins with an apparent recorder start

transient, a recorder stop transient is evident at the end

of the introduction, but no similar start transient is apparent.

The above suggests that the "introduction" may have been inserted

over the existing recording but a more definitive conclusion on

this point cannot be reached without developing and examining

the magnetic patterns on the HSCA tape.

5-6) The recorder appears to have been activated

manually. Bumping and handling of the microphone is audible

prior to recorder turnoff during the conversations.

This

suggests that the remote switch which activates the recorder

may be incoxporated in the microphone housing. During the

- 29 -

M 65994 Docld:32989745 Page 88

---

## Page 89

conversation on side l, the recorder was stopped and started

two occasions, at 14 minutes 40 seconds and again at 21

minutes 10 seconds.

These stops do not occur during the

pertinent conversations.

7) Indications are

that the tape was manually

turned over

to obtain recordings on both sides. No auto-

reverse markings or sensor tape was observed on the HSCA

tape and there is no time relationship between the respective

recordings on side l and 2 to indicate auto-reverse had occurred.

Memorandum W. D. Campbell to Mr. Cochran

RE:

MURKIN

DETAILS:

On 4/29/77 Mr. James Chenowich, HSCA furnished a

reel of magnetic tape for reproduction by the FBI. A direct

copy of this tape was made the same day in the presence of

Mr. Chenowich and SA John C. Lawn. Leader tape was attached

to both ends of the HSCA recording to ensure reproduction of

the entire tape. Upon completion of the reproduction, the

leader tape was removed and the tape was returned to Mr.

Chenowich in its original condition.

Because the HSCA tape was provided for only a

brief period of time, only limited examination of the tape

could be conducted.

The following sets forth results of

examination of the HSCA tape and technical analysis of the

copy of the tape produced at FBIHQ:

Physical inspection of the HSCA tape revealed it

to be standard 1/4-inch wide magnetic tape on a. standard 5-inch

diameter clear

plastic reel.

Into the plastic of the reel

was scratched "BFB 1 4-5-77." The tape had-the

appearance of standard 1/2 mil (1 mil = 001 inch) thickness.

A measured playback time of approximately 59.5 minutes at

3 3/4 inches per second supports the assumption that the

tape is standard 1/2 mil thick.

The tape backing was polyester

plastic and no unusual visual characteristics or coloration

of the oxide were noted.

In summary, the reel of tape furnished appeared to

be commonly available standard tape and of a length within

the expected tolerances of tape manufacturers. This type

of tape would have been available in 1965.

Development of the magnetic patterns on the

beginning of the HSCA tape revealed that it was recorded

in a 1/2-track configuration, that is, the recorded in-

formation covers 1/2 the width of the

tape.

This is a

standard tape recording configuration.

For the purposes

of convention, the recording of the pertinent conversation

will be referred to

as "side 1."

There is present on the

tape a second "side" (designated as "side 2") which is a

second track of recorded information.

This information

is

recorded backwards relative to side 1, indicating the

recorder used was probably 1/2 track monaural.

This again

is a standard recorder configuration and recorders of this

type would have been common in or around

1965.

Memorandum W. D. Campbell to Mr. Cochran

RE:

MURKIN

As indicated previously, the playback time of the

tape at standard 3: 3/4 inches per

second speed was measured

to be approximately 59.5 minutes.

The recorded information

on side 1 and 2 is, however, of substantially shorter duration.

The recordings have the effect of continuously slowing down

causing the voices to drop in pitch and requiring constant

upward speed adjustment of the playback recorder to normalize

the speech.

The observed effect is however opposite to

that which normally occurs when batteries grow weak on

battery-operated recorders.

There might be other explanations

for this effect based upon mechanical considerations of the

recorder transport mechanism but exact cause cannot be determined

without specific knowledge of the type of recorder used. Speed-

correction of the recording revealed that the side 1 recording

was approximately 34 minutes duration.

The conversation on side 1

ran off the end of the tape. The side 2 recording was measured

at approximately 35 1/2 minutes duration

and the conversation

terminated prior to the end of the tape.

The following additional information is provided

concerning specific items of interest.

1) Nothing unusual

about the physical characteristics

if the HSCA tape to indicate the age of the recording was

observed.

Some oxide was missing from the very end of the

tape which usually indicates

the tape has been used to a con-

siderable extent. It is entirely possible that the tape could

have been used to record a conversation in 1965.

2) There is no clear indication of whether the HSCA

tape was an original or a copy. This kind of determinatior

is dependent upon availability of the recorder used to make

the recording as well as further detailed study of the HSCA

tape.

3) The acoustic characteristics of the recording

(reverberation, enhanced low frequency components to the

voices,

extraneous noises) indicate the recording could have

- 3-

been made in an automobile or other vehicle. If a remote

microphone was used, it would not be necessary that the

recorder itself be in the passenger compartment: At approxi-

mately 21 minutes 23 seconds into side 1, the recording

indicates Blair to be returning to the vehicle.

The sound

of the vehicle door slamming shut behind him is audible.

Little other vehicular traffic is evident on side I.

5 minutes 4

: seconds a passing vehicle is audible, at

5 minutes. 55 seconds a sound similar to squealing tires

is present and at 6 minutes: 35 seconds a series of distant

explosions is audible to which Baird comments "Backfires."

The side 2 recording was made in an environment

similar to side 1. On side 2 considerably more extraneous

noise is evident..

At 1 minute 3 seconds, 2 minute. 48 seconds

and at 5. minutes 13 seconds traffic is heard to pass.

At

25 minutes. 36 seconds and

again

at 28 minutes, 44 seconds

jet aircraft are audible and quite pronounced, indicating

the vehicle is parked

relatively close to an airport. It

should be kept in mind, however, that sides 1 and 2 are inde-

pendent recordings and

could have been made at substantially

different times.

There is, further, no technica. indication

of which side, side l or side 2, was recorded first.

4) It is very likely that the "introduction" did

not occur in sequence with the remainder of the side 1

recording.

For approximately & seconds prior to the "introduction"

the recorder was activated.: Although no voice is audible

there are audible tones present on the recording. Frequency

measurement of these tones indicate the tape was running

slower than normal speed and was continuously decreasing in

speed (discussed previously).

• -4-

## Page 94

Memorandum W. D. Campbell to Mr. Cochran

RE: MURKIN

Beginning 8 seconds into the recording and con-

tinuing for another 50 seconds (the segment which includes

the "introduction".) the tones suddenly shift upward in

frequency and

the recording occurs at normal speed. Immediately

following the "introduction", 58 seconds into the recording,

the tones shift downward in frequency discontinuously to a

point comparable to the first 8 seconds of the recording.

The "introduction" begins with an apparent recorder start

transient, a recorder stop transient is evident at the end

of the introduction, but no similar start transient is

apparent. The above suggests that the "introduction" may

have been inserted over the existing recording but a more

definitive conclusion on this point cannot be reached without

developing and examining the magnetic patterns on the HSCA

tape.

5-6) The recorder appears to have been activated

manually. Bumping and handling of the microphone is audible

prior to recorder turnoff during the conversations. This

suggests that the remote switch which activates the recorder

may be incorporated in the microphone housing.

conversation on side 1, the recorder was stopped and started

on two occasions, at 14 minutes 40 seconds and again at 21

minutes 10 seconds. These stops do not occur during the

pertinent conversations:

7) Indications are that the tape was manually

turned over to obtain recordings on both sides. No auto-

reverse markings or sensor tape was observed on the HSCA

tape and there is no time relationship between the respective

recordings on side l

and 2 to indicate

auto-reverse had

occurred.

PURPOSE: -To-advise: of receipt of information from a Keith

Ernest Lamonica, a News Director of a Seattle radio

station, to the effect that a Raoul Santiago Estejo Martinez I

is the unidentified "Raoul" referred to by James Earl Ray.

Ray has claimed

that "Raoul" was

an international

-gun-runner and

he drove "Raoul" away from the crime scene wholly unaware of .

the killing of King.

62-117290-25743

SYNOPSIS: This case pertains to the assassination of Martin

Luther King on 4/4/68 in Memphis, Tennessee.

James Earl Ray pled

guilty to this murder and presently is

in local confinement. On 6/1/77, Keith Ernest Lamonica, a News

Director of

a Seattle radio station, advised SAC, Seattle,

that he now has developed information indicating that

• "Raoul"

is actually Raoul Santiago Estejo Martinez and that with the

cooperation of Ray's attorney, Lamonica is to meet with Martinez

through an intermediary, Cliff Andrews. Lamonica indicated

when

this information breaks, it will cause considerable

publicity; he has already been contacted by 3 major net-

works and leaves Thursday morning to be interviewed by the

"National Enquirer" in Florida.

He has been interviewed by

the House Select Committee on Assassinations HSCA) ; however,

he did not have the aforementioned information on "Raoul"

during this interview by the HSCA. Martinez reportedly

indicated he will testify if granted immunity.

Lamonica's

purpose in contacting FBI was to express concern for the

safety of his two daughters inasmuch as he heard indirectly

that a New Orleans "hit man" would cause him or his family alot

of trouble if the story breaks.

SAC advised Lamonica of the •

witness protection program and

that he should probably notify

HSCA of his fears.

Memorandum to Mr.

RE:

MURKIN

Fehl

Our prior investigation never identified the

existence of a "Raoul."

A Task Force of the Office of

Professional Responsibility, U. S. Department of Justice;

recently reviewed our investigation of King and in examining

the allegations re "Raoul," it concluded that "the task

force views the exculpatory content of these varying and

patently self-serving tales to be unbelievable,"

and "we

concluded Ray was lying about the existence of

a 'Raoul'."

Lamonica refers to intermediary, Cliff Andrews,

and although insufficient identifying data exists, there

was one C. H. Andrews who in 19.74, indicated to Ray's attorney

that he had information concerning a conspiracy; however, a

District Attorney General in Memphis and another attorney felt

this was a hoax and upon interview, Andrews denied any knowledge

concerning the King slaying.

RECOMMENDATION:

By memorandum dated 4/28/77, we advised the

Department that in order to

avoid duplication

of investigative effort and the attendant problems between the

EBl and the iscA that could arise in the future, and until the

jurisdiction of this Bureau in these investigations (both the

King and Kennedy cases) is delineated by the Department, the

FBI will refer all allegations

relating to these investigations

to the Department for its consideration as to whether any

investigation is required of the FBI, or whether the Department

desires to furnish these allegations directly to the HSCA.

Accordingly, the Department will be advised of the information

furnished by Lamonica and no investigation will be instituted

uniess specifically requested by the Department.

RE :

MURKIN

6:45 P.M., PDST, June 1, 1977, SAC Seattle received call

from individual identifying himself as Keith Ernest Lamonica.

Lamonica advised he is News Director with KYYX Radio, 1305 -

3Id Avenue, Seattle, Washington, lel. 682-2828.

Lamonica

identical with Bufile 46-53387, captioned Keith Ernest Lamonica;

Dare Curtis Torno, FAG, 00: seattle. Lamonica described

previous association with Bureau personnel while assigned as

Investigative reporter with WMPS RadiO, Memphis, Tennessee,

and also while working on the Yablonski murder cases in

Knoxville, Tennessee.

Lamonica presently resides 31022 -

48th Avenue SW, Federal Way, Washington.

Lamonica indicated he has been working on captioned

case and although he did not previously believe of the existence

of "Raoul" theory as posed by James Earl Ray, he now has developed

information indicating that "Raoul" is actually Raoul Santiago

Estejo Martinez and that with the cooperation of Ray's

Attorney, Jack Kershaw, he, Lamonica, is to meet with Martinez

through an intermediary, Cliff Andrews, who supposedly served

prison time with Ray.

Lamonica further indicated that when this information

breaks; it will cause considerable publicity and he has already

contacted by three major networks and

leaves Thursday

morning; to be interviewed by the "National Enquirer" at

Lantana, Florida,

from where he will return to Seattle possibly

on Friday.

He said approximately two weekends ago he was

interviewed by two investigators named Moriarty

(PH) , and Gilbert

from the House Select Committee on Assassinations who indicated

they would be subpoenaing Lamonica in the near future. At the

time of this interview lamonica did not have the aforementioned

information on Raoul Martinez. Martinez reportedly

indicated he will testify about captioned case if he can be

granted immunity from prosecution.

Lamonica's purpose in contacting Seattle FBI was to

express concern for the safety of his two daughters, Deborah

Angela, age. 7, and Dana Edna, age 6, who reside with his parents

at 4817 W. Richardson, Pasco, Washington, tel. 547-7935.

Raoul Martinez) would cause him or his family alot of trouble

Select Committee of his fears but to check with this office

upon his return this coming Friday.

Above furnished for information of Bureau for referral

to Department. All offices hold

specific leads in abeyance

pending instructions from Bureau.'"

BACKGROUND ON LAMONICA: Bufile 46-53387 reflects.that Lamonica

was the subject of a Fraud Against

the Government case in 1966. Lamonica allegedly was

in the

possession of a first-class radio telephone operator's license

registered to another individual as reported by the Federal

• Communications Commission. Federal prosecution was declined.

BACKGROUND ON "RAOUL.": Ray previously related to Author

William Bradford Huie that "Raoul" was

an international

gun-runner and he drove "Raoul" away from the crime

scene after the murder wholly unaware of the killing of king.

"Pacific News

Service" also préviously reported that Ray

received instructions from "Raoul" in Memphis. Our prior investigation

never identified the existence of a "Raoul."

A Task Force

of the Office of Professional Responsibility, U. S. Department of

Justice, recently reviewed our investigation of King and in

examining the "Raoul" allegations, concluded that "the task

force views the exculpatory content of these varying and

RE :

BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON CLIFF ANDREWS: Lamonica claims he is

to meet with Martinez

through an intermediary, Cliff Andrews. Although insufficient

identifying. data exists

for the purposes of identification, in

1974, one Clifford Holms Andrews had been in contact with

Ray's attorney, Robert Livingston, and indicated his knowledge of,

and involvement in, a conspiracy re this matter.

A District

Attorney General in Memphis and a Memphis attorney, who had been

in contact with Andrews, believed the revelations by Andrews

were a hoax perpetrated

to swindle Livingston of funds.

Andrews

was subsequently interviewed and denied any knowledge of the

King slaying.

RESULTS OF 'FBIHQ INDICES CHECK ON RAOUL SANTIAGO ESTEJO MARTINEZ

AND RAFAEL MARTINEZ - THE ALLEGED "HITMAN."

„Based on available identifying data, no pertinent information

was located in Bufiles concerning the above two individuals.

POLICY RE INVESTIGATING ADDITIONAI. ALLEGATIONS:

By memorandum dated 4/28/77, captioned "House

Select Committee on Assassinations," we advised the Department

that in order to avoid duplication of investigative effort and

the attendant problems between the FBI and the HSCA that

could arise in the future, and until the jurisdiction of this

Bureau in these investigations (both the King and Kennedy

cases) is delineated by the Department, the FBI will refer

all allegations relating to these investigations to the

Department for its consideration as to whether any investigation

is required of the FBI, or whether the Department desires to

furnish these allegations directly to the HSCA. Accordingly,

the information furnished by Lamonica will be furnished to the

Department and no investigation will be conducted unless

specifically requested by the Department. Our appropriate

field offices will be so advised.

SUBJECT:Martin Luther King Assassination

On April 7, 1977, James Travis Buckley, J.B. Stoner

and

I met in the United States Attorney's office in Jackson,

Mississippi, to complete discovery and work out stipulations

in United States ⅚. James Travis Buckley, Criminal No. J76-

54 (N) .

• On May 14, 1977, Buckley,

an attorney, was convicted

• on five counts of failing to file income tax returns for

1970 through 1974 and three counts of tax evasion for 1970,

1973 and 1974.

During the conversation on April 7, 1977, J.B. Stoner

mentioned that he had recently received

his Federal Bureau

of Investigation file covering 1483 pages under the Freedom

of Information Act.

He stated that the file reveals that

the Federal Bureau of Investigation had bugged his auto

mobile and his telephone:

He mentioned that the F.B.I. had

treated him like Martin Luther King. Stoner. went on

to say

that in 1957 or 1958, he had been approached by the head of

an Alabama Klavern of the Klu Klux. Klan. Stoner said that

everyone knew that this man was an f.B.I. agent.

Stoner

said that this individual offered him $25,000 to hire a

rifleman to kill Martin Luther King. He remarked to me that

he did not mind the F.B.I. killing an individual like Martin

Luther King but he did resent their attempt and the attempt

of the House Committee to pin

the murder on a scapegoat,

James Earl Ray.

(J.B. Stoner had represented James Earl Ray

on his appeal).

J.B. Stoner is one of the leading white supremacists

and anti-Semites in the nation.

He is the president of the

National States' Rights Party and edits a recist newsletter,

Thunderbolt, in Marietta, Georgia.

Special Agent William

Jack Sykes of Jackson, Mississippi, was also present when

Stoner made these comments.

however, did not require serialization accounting and the

field was instructed to include only documents not directed

to or received from FBIHQ and Memphis.

Recipients of this teletype have been contacted

telephonically in an effort to coordinate these two projects

involving the MURKIN files.

Offices in question were determined by the HSCA to

be key offices in the MURKIN investigation.

By letter

dated. 7/28/77, the HSCA requested field office files with

the exception

of chicago and St. Louis, which were added

at the conference on 8/16/77. Field office files involved

consist of approximately 150 sections and 12,500 serials.

At the meeting on 8/16/77, HSCA officials desired

that the Congressional Inquiry Unit (CIU) review all incoming

field office serials and check each against the FBIHQ and

Memphis files to insure that all communications were

actually received and filed. This request was rejected and

a compromise was reached whereby the CIU will check a small

random sampling of field serials to verify their

existence in either the FBIH@ or Memphis file.

Meeting on 8/16/77, at the HSCA office was attended

by Mr. Blakey and Robert Lehner of the HSCA; D. O. Coulson

of the Legal Counsel Division and J. T. Aldhizer of the CIU.

In adaition, this matter was coordinated on 8/17/77, with

Robert Keuch, Special Counsel to the Attorney General, who

is conducting liaison with the HSCA for the Department of

Justice.

Dear Mr. Kelley:

MANTRAT. MOYFANHENE

As you are aware, I have received a number of investigative

summaries on staff personnel of my Committee. These have been

extremely helpful. However, the information contained in four of

the summaries is of such a nature that I feel it prudent and proper

to review as much additional supporting data as might be readily

available in order to render a fair and balanced judgment in these

cases. In effect, the summaries do reflect somewhat noteworthy

comments by certain acquaintances, and it is quite important to

determine whether there is an offsetting information which would

serve to place the cases in better perspective from a security standpoint.

11259

In view of the above, I would be most appreciative if you would

furnish me, at your earliest convenience, with additional investigative

details on the following individuals:

Claire Louise Brown

Born: November.11, 1947, Atlanta, Ga.

Stephen James Fallis

Born: November 7, 1942, Oceanside, N. Y.

Jacqueline Hess

Born: June 20, 1951, Baltimore, Md.

ESCA request indicated that certain material could not be

readily copied, however, suitable copies of all of the

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

The Select Committee on Assassinations is assembling

a panel of firearms identification experts to evaluate and

test firearms evidence in the case of the assassination of

Dr. Martin Luther King, JX.

In this connection,. I am requesting that the Federal

Bureau of Investigation furnish to the Committee copies of

all memoranda, reports, documents and material in the posses-

sion of the FBI relating to its examinations of the firearms.

evidence in that case.

While the Committee already has access

to the requested material at the FBI Building, the staff needs

copies of the material to prepare for the Committee tests and

tö furnish to its panel of experts.

LIBERTO,

, SALVATORE LIBERTO, JOHN HE FERREN,

OTIS HUMPHREY MOORE, AND LOUIS LOMAX

This will respond to a May 13, 1977 letter to

the Federal Bureau of Investigation from Stephen J. Fallis,

Deputy Chief Counsel, HSCA, relating to Information in

possession of the FBI concerning Morris Davis, Frank

Liberto, Vincent Iberto, Anthony Liberto (lIsted on the

May 13, 1977 HSCA memorandum as "Alberto" Liberto, however,

belleved should be Anthony Liberto), Salvatore Liberto,

Morris Davis previously furnished

information

to the FBI concerning the assassination öf Martin Luther

King, Ji., on a confidential basis and this information

1s contained in the FBI's civil rights assassination file

pertaining to King (44-38861, abbreviated as the "MURKIN"

file) which has already been

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (HSCA)

NOTE: By memorandum dated 3/9/77,

the HSCA requested

information in possession of the FBI pertaining to the

listed individuals.

Insufficient identifying data was

provided and by memorandum dated 5/13/77, the HSCA fur-

nished available identifying data pertaining to this

request.

The HSCA requested Information pertaining to Morris

Davis who is a former potential criminal informant of the

Birmingham office and who has furnished some information

re MURKIN to the Birmingham office wherein he requested his

Identity be protected.

This information pertains to the

involvement of Frank Liberto, et al. In 1968 we conducted

an extensive investigation concerning Liberto who was employed

at a produce company where a conversation was allegedly over-

heard concerning a threat aginst King prior to his assassination.

All investigation conducted concerning the Liberto matter was

disseminated to the Department and no additional investigation

was requested. Davis subsequently was in contact with the

HSCA direct concerning his information. On 5/31/77 as set

forth in a Birmingham teletype, dated 5/31/77, Davis advised

his name could now be provided to the HSCA as the source of

the information he furnished which is contained in the MURKIN

file.

This responds to this HSCA request advising that

pertinent information is available in the MURKIN file and

in addition, all other pertinent references to the listed

individuals have been processed (making appropriate excisions,

etc.,) and are now available for HSCA access.

The HSCA

initially requested information on Anthony Liberto and

apparently this name was incorrectly transposed by the

HSCA as "Alberto" Liberto in the 5/13/77 request when

the name actually should be Anthony. All responses to

HSCA access are made through Mr. Keuch of the Department

who was appointed by the Attorney General to be Special

Counsel for the Department

in matters re the HSCA.

Honorable John Melcher

NOTE :

In April, 1977, Senator Melcher wrote, enclosing

an article from

"The Review of the News", a publication

printed in Belmont, Massachusetts.

This

article supported

the FBI's investigation of King and criticized the Senate

Intelligence Committee for refusing to release the FBI

file on King and his electronic surveillance results.

Melcher did not request a reply, but stated that allegations

not be kept secret.

In response to this letter, we outlined the

basis for our investigation of King.

We stated allegations

of Communist connections have been investigated, with results

furnished appropriate agencies of the Government. Regarding

Melcher's reference to surveillance records, we referred him

to a recent court decision which ordered all

tapes and

documents obtained from our electronic surveillance of King

to be sent to the National Archives and not to be made public

This decision was

rendered in two civil suits filed against the FBI by a former

assistant to King and the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference, which King headed until his death.

In his second letter, Melcher states he is not

requesting actual electronic tapes or other material gathered

during our surveillance of King and his associates.

He asked

that results of our King investigation be made public.

This matter was coordinated with SA R. C. Dennis,

Freedom of Information - Privacy Acts Branch.

Reference is made to my letter to you dated June 6, 1977, in

the above caption which discussed a report prepared by former Assistant

to the Department's review of FBI files in the investigation or Martin Luther

King, Jr.; and a memorandum of Robert A. Murphy, former Chief,

Criminal Section, Civil Rights Division, Which was an enclosure to the

Pottinger report. Our letter pointed out certain inaccuracies in the

Murphy memorandum.

During a conference on July 14, 1977, between representatives

ot this Bureau and MI. Robert L. Keuch of your olfice it was indicated

py Mr. Neuch that in furnishing the Murphy memorandum to the fisca,

it was intended that the Department would advise the ESCA of the

inaccuracies in the Murphy memorandum as claimed by us. There was

raised with Mir. Keuch the matter of two additional inaccuracies lone in

the Murphy memorardum, one in the Pottinger report) and Mr. Keuch

Ladvised that if we submitted in writing our claim of these two additional

naccuracies, he would entertain the suggestion of furnishing that

information to the HSCA:

The two inaccuracies and facts as known to us relating to them

are as follows:

Assistant Attorney General

Criminal Division

Attention: Mr. Robert I. Leuch

the FBI did have two electronic surveillances in effect in Atlantic City

during the period of the Convention. One was a telephone surveillance

on an individual at a hotel. The other was a microphone surveillance at

a storefront jointly occupied by two organizations. We believe that the

implication of an FBI eloctronic surveillance at the Convention site is

of such serious significance that the facts in this matter should be brought

to the attention of the FISCA in any furnishing to it of the Murphy memorandur.

Pago 9 of the Pottinger report contains a statement, "The files

reflect that the Bureau's action, especially in mailing of the tape,..."

(this refers to a mailing of a tape to the ling household in Atlanta, Georgia).

From all records available at the FBI.there appears to bo no doubt that a

tape was mailed to the ling family. There is no record in our files, nor

has any indivicual come forward with any intormation, to indicate that the

mailing of the tape was an oificial iBl action. father, the indication is

that the mailing of the tage was by an individual who was then an Assistant

Director of the FBI but with no indication it was with the approval of any

higher authority, inchding the late Director, J. Edgar Hoover. We have

previously indicated this position to the Senate Select Committee on

Intelligence Activities (Church Committee) and to the Department. It is

believed that our position relating to the mailing of the tape should ba

made known to the ESCA in the event it is furnished the Pottinger report.

-Memorandum to Mr.

Adams

Re: House Select Committee On Assassinations (HSCA)

OBSERVATIONS:

The manner and context in which this statement appears

very strongly implies, indeed some might justifiably claim it

actually says that there was an electronic surveillance (by the

FBI) on the floor or elsewhere in the Auditorium where the

Convention took place.

We know of no such electronic surveillance

by us or anyone else that I am familiar with. True, we had

such surveillances at two other Atlantic City sites

at the time --

one in a hotel and one in a storefront.

It seems to me that

there is a vast difference in terms of impact, any abuse of

power, etc,between such coverage at the Convention site as

opposed to elsewhere in the city. We have been subject to

considerable criticism relating to motivation behind past

acts, some justified, some not so.

Surely we should not be

placed in the position of being vulnerable to completely

unjustifiable criticism which we will surely be if the quoted

statement is furnished to the HSCA without attention being

drawn to its inaccuracies.

(2) Page 9 of the Pottinger report contains a

statement, "The files reflect that the Bureau's action,

especially the mailing of the tape,..."

OBSERVATIONS:

The Bureau has consistently taken the position,

in writing and orally, with the Church Committee and the

Department that the mailing of the tape was not an official

FBI action, or with the approval of Director Hoover.

Our position has been that the mailing of the tape was the

singular action of a Bureau official with no known sanction

and with the unwitting aid of other fBi employees.

It seems

to me that if we have made this claim to others before, we

need to again make it in the context of this report which

is to be disseminated to the HSCA.

In the strongest terms, and with the FBI as the prime

consideration, it is urged that these inaccuracies be brought

to Mr. Keuch's attention in writing.

RECOMMENDATION:

If you agree, the Congressional Inquiry Unit, Special

Investigative Division, will prepare the appropriate correspondence
