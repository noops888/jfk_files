Introduction

This act was the first in a chain of

events that is unequaled in complexity by any other Soviet

operation handled by the Central Intelligence Agency since

its establishment.

Because the case still has important

implications for

the overall Soviet intelligence effort

the United States, and because it raises nany basic questions

about the techniques of handling Soviet agents and defectors,

a reinvestigation of the case was commissioned by the Agency

in June 1976.

The results are embodied in this report and

its annexes.

Although United States officials of many agencies, up

to and including a president of the United States, were

briefed

on the case

and either played some role in making decisions

concerning it or actively participated in running the opera-

tion, it does not now appear that,

single individual has ever been fully informed as to all

aspects.

The complexity of this investigation therefore

stems in large measure from the fact that the case has pro-

ceeded

and often more, compartmented

along at least two to get a total picture of what

the effort

transpired has involved

an unusual amount of research in the

files of various components of

the Agency, plus personal in-

terviews with a large number of present and former Agency

employees.

The actions taken in regard to Nosenko were not the

result of decisions made by a unitary Agency acting as a

corporate entity; rather, in this case more than in most,

decisions were made by a

number of senior individuals on

basis of their own strongly-held views, which sometimes con-

flicted with the equally strongly-held

opinions of other

senior colleagues.

Thus, this report must,

if it is to be

comprehensible,

attempt to depict the decision-making process

in all its complexity by referring when necessary to the

individual participants.

CHAPTER I

Organizational Background: CIA's Handling

Of Soviet Positive Intelligence and CI Matters

The history of the Nosenko case can only be comprehended

within the framework of the organization and day-to-day func-

tioning of the Central Intelligence Agency

as a whole.

fact, opinions regarding the handling

In

of the Nosenko case may

differ substantially according to individual's differing

views regarding internal Agency organization and functioning.

This being the case, it is useful at the outset to make

explicit our understandirg of how the Agency actually func-

tioned in the relevant period, the 1960s,

as distinct fron

how it might theoretically have functioned

according to

Agency organizational charts and regulations.

The two instrumentalities for the conduct of day-to-day

operations in the Soviet field were the Soviet Bloc Division

(known successively by this and several other names* and

the Counterintelligence Staff.

In the nature and interrela-

tionship of these two organizations we find the key to much

of what was to happen in the Nosenko case.

Although the SB Division was considered a "line" organi-

zation, the CI Staff's name would imply (if the Agency's

organization were to be taken at face value) that its

function was limited to advising a command echelon. In fact,

such a distinction was never enforced.

"CI Staff" was actually a misnomer, because the organi-

zation carrying this name did not even

concern itself to any

appreciable extent with the counterintelligence function of

the Agency on a worldwide basis.

Rather,

it concentrated on

the USSR and Soviet Bloc countries.

Within the SB Division, there was lodged the so-called

the CI Staff.

Soviet CI Group? concerned itself, during most of the

which was in many respects a competitor of

period to be covered in this report, primarily with information

*This area component during the period of this report was

known as Soviet Russia Division

(1952-1966) and

• Soviet Bloc

Division (1966-1974). The two names are often used inter-

changeably.

on the intelligence and counterintelligence organs of the

USSR, and as

such was inevitably somewhat redundant

since

the same field was the major preoccupation of the Cl Staff.

Nevertheless, as will emerge later in this report, there

during most of the period with which we are concerned a

substantial congruity of

views between the SB/CI Group and

CI Staff that militated in favor of coherent operational

policy, even though the two organizations might disagree on

matters of detail.

One curious aspect of the organizational problem should

be mentioned at this point because,

it may have played a significant role. • While the SB Division

understandably. had a number of competent Russian linguists,

the Cl Staff did not have a single Russian linguist who could

be brought to bear on either the Nosenko or Golitsyn case.

The staff was therefore dependent for its data on translations

of Nosenko material and,

tion obtained fron discussions conducted with him in English,

a language in which he was not fully fluent.

A third organizational participant in the Nosenko case

was the Office of Security.

This office had overlapping

jurisdiction with Cl Starf and, to a lesser extent,

SB Division

in any matter that involved a suspected Soviet or Soviet Bloc

penetration of the Agency.

Nhile not usually a problem, the

overlapping jurisdiction was considerable in both

Golitsyn and Nosenko cases because so much of the activity

in connection with both operations revolved around allegations

that the Soviets had penetrated the Agency at a high level.

Although allegations that the Soviets had recruited

Agency staff emplojees did not first originate with Golitsyn,

it was he who lent special force to them by spelling out a

complicated theory of Soviet intentions and modus operandi.

He thus provided a detailed conceptual framework within which

to develop a hypothesis towards which some members of the

Agency were already predisposed. Golitsyn thus became the

ideologue's ideologue.

Prior to Golitsyn's defection, the Agency as a whole had

been hard hit by its

dealings with

tions of Western governments.

where, but they included British representatives such as

Kim Philby and George Blake.

Another important penetration

was Heinz Felfe, who rose to be Deputy Chief of Soviet

Counterintelligence in the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND).

The Felfe case

is particularly significant because it was

believed by a number of counterintelligence specialists in

he Agency that felfe's career had been systematically pro

noted by the Soviets through what came to be known as thi

"throw-away" technique.

According to the theory of this

group, a considerable number of valuable and productive

Soviet intelligence operations in Germany were made avail-

able to felfe so that, by detecting them and signaling their

presence to the West German

authorities, he could build

up

his reputation as a counterintelligence specialist.

while

there is

debate about the value of the assets the Soviets

made available, there appears to be enough substance to this

theory for it to have had a strong impact within the Agency,

particularly upon those persons who were members of

the

former

Eastern European (EE) Division of the Plans Directorate.

In the course of time, the continuing record of KGB

success in penetrating Western

governments nade it the more

feared of the two principal Soviet intelligence services.

Although we had had our successes also in penetrating the

Soviets, they were primarily through GRU defectors-in-place

such as Popov and Penkovskiy. The defection of Anatoliy

Golitsyn on 15 December 1961 was thus a major event.

Once again, it is not necessary here

to go into details

regarding Golitsyn, because this case has been covered exten-

sively in a recent studj. However, two points are worth

noting:

1.

First, Golitsyn was diagnosed early in

1962 as a "paranoid personality.

Although account

was taken of this psychological problem, It was

-considered in the light of a threat to the con-

tinuity of the debriefing process rather than as

a factor reflecting on the validity of the purported

intelligence he

theoretical generalizations.

2.

Secondly, Golitsyn presented us righ: from

the years, a complicated rationale for believing

that the KGB was successfully pursuing a mammoti

program of "disinformation" to the detriment of the

United States and its lestern allies.

This ratio-

nale

is covered in more detail in Chapter VI of

this report.

It is against this background that we view the approach

to CIA by Nosenko and his subsequent handling.

In doing so,

we shall

for ease of refcrence from time to time allude to

the thesis regarding KGB operations and intentions--claborated

by Golitsyn and others--as the "Monster Plot."

In fairness,

it must be allowed that this term was in common usage not

by the thesis' proponents but rather by its detractors; yet

no other name serves so aptly to capsulize what the theorizers

envisaged as a major threat to United States' security.

If

the term carries with it emotive connotations, the latter

were certainly shared by both sides to the controversy; and

this fact alone is enough to justify including "Monster Plot"

in the lexicon of this study.

the shipbuilding college that attested to his study in, and

At some time prior to July 1945, Nosenko accompanied his

father, who went to East Germany with a group of engineers.

For purposes

of that trip, Nosenko received

as an Army senior lieutenant, with appropriate documents and

uniform.

Nosenko entered the Institute of International Relations

in Moscow in July 1945.

Upon completion of the second year

at the Institute, and by virtue of his participation in a

military training program roughly equivalent to the ROTC,

Nosenko received the rank of

sisted that this was not his child.

Nosenko completed a four-year course at the Institute

of International Relations, but he actually received his

diploma a year later, in 1950, because he had failed the

examination in Marxism.

He had had to wait an extra year in

order to retake this examination.

In March 1951, Nosenko was assigned as an English

language translator in naval intelligence (Naval RU),

serving first in the Far East.

While on leave in Moscow.

(late April 1952), he developed an illness that caused him

to cough up blood, and he entered a tuberculosis sanatorium

near Moscow for treatment.

For reasons of health, he did

not return to the Far East but was sent instead to the

offer of help in getting employment

Security (NGB).

In March 1953, while again in Moscow, Nosenko

was called to Kobulov's office.

Kobulov had just returned

from Germany to become the First Deputy Minister of the MVD

(Ministry of Internal Affairs).

Nosenko did not see Kobulov

personally but was referred by the latter's assistant to the

deputy chief of the Second Chief Directorate (internal coun

terintelligence), hereafter referred to as SCD, by whom he

was hired.

In June 1953 Nosenko married his third wife, Lyudmila

Yulianovna Khozhevnikova, who was a student at the Moscow

State University.

Nosenko,

a member of the Komsomol since 1943, was

elected secretary of the SCD Komsomol unit in June 1953 and

served as secretary of that unit until about June 1954.

However, earlier in 1954, Nosenko had contracted venereal

disease

and gone to a clinic; to disguise his identity, he

used operational

documentation in alias in applying for

treatment.

When he did not go back for final treatment

as instructed, the clinic sent a letter to his ostensible

place of work

as shown on the alias document.

The MVD found

out about this improper use of alias documentation and re-

ported it to the seD.

Nosenko was not only disciplined

by the chief, SCD (reprimanded and placed under arrest for

15 days),

but the Komsonol also removed him as secretary

and expelled him from its organization.

In early spring 1955, Nosenko received a poor

charakteristika (pertormance evaluation), which described

rim as unsuitable for work in the first Department. None-

theless, he was neither dismissed nor transferred.

Although Nosenko survived the 1954 episode as well as

the poor performance report, these

events caused him to go

on what he has described as a "big drunk," which resulted

in his having to spend a month under hospital care.

To

keep Nosenko out of further trouble, his mother intervened

by making a telephone call to Petr Vasilyevich Fedotov,

chief of the SCD.

Seemingly as a result of her efforts,

Nosenko was transferred in the latter part of May 1955 to

the Second Section (which operated against tourists) of

the seventh Department,

SCD.

In late 1955, Lieutenant

General Oleg Mikhaylovich Gribanov was appointed chief of

the SCD.

advantage of the fact that he was the watchdog

for the

delegation' whereas its members could not watch him,

Nosenko used his freedom of movement to approach the

Agency, ostensibly for personal financial assistance.

Is he told it, Nosenko had recently slept with a

Swiss woman who had stolen 900 Swiss Francs of official

funds that he had on his person at the time; inability

to reimburse this relatively trivial amount

(about US

$250 at the time) would jeopardize his career.

In ex-

change for 2,000 Swiss Francs, he therefore proposed

that he provide us with two items of information.

These items, subsequently verified, related

to:

1.

KGB recruitment of a US Army sergeant

while he was serving in the American embassy

in Moscow as a "code machine repairman."

2. A Soviet official whom the Agency

had ostensibly recruited but who was being

run against us under KGB control.

At this time Nosenko was not forthcoming in response

tives inside the USSR.

Nevertheless, he "agreed "perhaps'

meet us when abroad" again at a later date.

our interest in him was whetted by his identification of

his deceased father as a former minister of the USSR.

In addition,

such information as he gave about himself

1911

indicated that he would be of high operational interest.

Inter alia his most recent assignment in Moscow was as

head of a KGB sub-section working against American

tourists.

and he had all the

you, he was of split motivation because

this was the big case of his entire life

And he wouldn't

agree to that, but we made a conpromise

and that was to take the material

and

falsify it as though it was an anonymous

letter sent to the embassy by an alleged

KGB person.

So the anonymous letter

was

drawn up, and [the principal case officer)

interviewed Golitsyn with the anonymous

But he began to point out in sone detail

and he very wisely stated that he wanted

everything on tape, because he knew that

as time passed in hundreds of interviews

and their counteraction took place, there

would be people accusing him of not having

divulged certain information.

The principal case officer's review of the Golitsys

information had indeed converted him to the view that

Nosenko's defection was bogus.

Equally convinced, as

clearly indicated by a number of documents that he

drafted, was his superior, the person who had become

might be (discredit Golitsyn, kidnap, pass

items, etc.).

C.. The Case Against Nosenko

Virtually

any information provided by Nosenko, or action taken by

him, was interpreted as part of a KGB "provocation."

If his information was in accord with that from other

sources, this fact not only confirned our suspicion of

Nosenko®

but was interpreted

as casting doubt on the

other sources as well.

While the above aspect will be covered at length

in Chapters V and VI, one example will serve to highlight

the attitude that prevailed.

Nosenko had, during our

neetings with him in 1962,

contributed information that

materially aided in the identification

and arrest of

William John Christopher Vassall, a British Admiralty

official who was also a KGB agent.

Because Golitsyn

had previously provided similar, but less specific,

information,

the usefulness of Nosenko's intelligence

was discounted; once Vassall had been identified, it

was concluded that Nosenko had been allowed to expose

him in order to support his own bona fides.

The argu-

ment ran that Vassall would in any case have been identi-

fied sooner or later on the basis of Golitsyn's leads.

In January 1964, Nosenko reappeared in Geneva ac-

"companying another Soviet delegation.

By now, the case

against him had been well established in the minds of

those dealing with the matter, and the record is there-

fore replete with manifestations of suspicion.

A particu-

lar example of our tendency to intetpret unfavorably al-

most anything Nosenko said is provided by notes that

Chief, Sk forwarded to Helms on 27 January 1964, with

the suggestion that they "convey very well the flavor

Yow this could be ar

idle pleasantry about my standing there like

but it is not

funny as FOXTROT

(ex-AEBARMAN) seemed to think it was and I

am afraid it means that he knows his own CIA

cryptonyn.

The above incident cxemplifies a main theme that ClA

was itself penetrated.

This fear had existed before

Golitsyn defected, but it was fed constantly by the lat-

ter's allegations

that information concerning him was

leaking to the KGB,

and the conclusion that the leaks

must have originated within the Agency.

Thus it was that a memorandum from Chief, SR on 27

January 1964, submitted to and approved by Helms, began

as follows:

Our goal in this case must be eventually to

break Subject and learn from him the details

of his mission and its relation to possible

agencies and those of allied nations as well

as to broader disinformation operations in

woe a betest served it sealece were brerests

as early as possible but since this is

mlikely, our actions must be conceived and

carried out in a manner which contributes to

our basic goal without alerting Subject unduly

at any stage.

Far from "alerting Subject unduly," on the surface

the Agency welcomed Nosenko with both cordiality and

generosity.

The following excerpts from a 30 January

1964 meeting make the point clearly:

Nosenko:

• D. Defection

As might be expected, the principal case officer

devoted a good deal of effort during the second Geneva

visit to persuading Nosenko to stay in place.

however, dismissed out of hand the possibifity of remain-

contact with CIA from within the Soviet Union,

he became increasingly

anxious to defect immediately.

When the principal case officer continued to press him

to remain

in Geneva long enough to effect an audio pene-

tration of the local rezidentura, Nosenko forced the

issue.

At a meeting on 4 February, he announced that a

cable had been received from Moscow ordering him back

home for a "tourism conference."

Though this claim was

subsequently to be the source of almost endless contro-

versy,

it was accepted at the time without apparent

question.

Preparations therefore immediately began for

evacuation to the United States.

A layover in another country en route to the United

States lasted about a fortnight.

This lasted from 2000 to 2230 and included

dinner with Subject and the case officers.

Conversation during this first meeting was

general in nature and followed no special

agenda.

Hokever, it did give me an oppor-

tunity to take Subject's measure.

I started

by telling Subject that I had come to form my

own impressions

of him as a person and an

intelligence officer who desired to place his

knowledge and experience at the disposal of

the United States government.

I added that

at face value.

in reaching them,

I was beset by a

viction they could pull off an operation like

this successfully and by a feeling of distaste

for the obvious and transparent manner in which

Subject played his role.

Chief, SR's distaste was sufficient to overcome any

interest he might otherwise have had in a recruitment

opportunity suggested by Nosenko:

Subject modified his position

to assure

"crude

plan and that we would

States.

Second,

I confirmed our agreement to

Finally,

Since failure to "break" Nosenko--i.e., force

him to admit that he had come to us not as

a genuine

defector but as a KGB-dispatched agent--was considered

virtually certain, plans were also being laid to re-

turn him to the

First Polygraph Examination

To raise Nosenko's level of apprehension and reduce

his supposed defenses

against the polygraph interroga-

tion technique, an additionai mechanism was also attached

to him, which he was told was an clectroencephalograph

(EEG) •

Chief, SR later commented that "Nosenko was com-

pletely confident of the polygraph when told that it

would be used until he discovered

graph

Despite the unusual circumstances surrounding the

the polygraph operator's conclusions,

stated in his report of 8 April 1964, were categorical:

It is the undersigned's conclusion that Subject

is not a bona fide defector

but is a dispatched

agent sent by Soviet Intelligence for a specific

mission or missions.

According to the pre-agreed upon plan, the

different phases

involving various pertinent

areas were covered with Subject polygraphically.

Challenge of Subject's reactions was indirect

and "soft."

On no occasion did Subject even

attempt to volunteer any explanation of the

possible causes for his polygraph reactions.

He continually denied and refused

to adnit

that there was

anything to any of

the ques-

tions which were asked of him.

When the final

test questions were completed and a record was

obtained of all of Subject's polygraphic re-

sponses, the nature of the challenge and

probing was changed.

Subject was

told that he was lying to nunerous

pertinent questions and was accused of being

Subject's only explanation

to the undersigned's direct

accusation was that

he could not be a dispatched agent because of

the

amount of information he had volunteered to

American Intelligence.

Subject,

who before and throughout testing

reflected complete self-control and composure,

now exhibited a completely different picture.

His composure was nonexistent, his eyes watered,

and his hands trembled.

Prior to being con-

fronted with the undersigned's opinion that

Subject was a dispatched

agent, when Subject

was asked on

from the KGB on how to attempt to beat the polygraph,

for several days with a specific inter-

rogation plan mapped out for each session.

At the end of the first interrogation session,

Subject noted that he had not harned the

United States in any way and that if we did

not believe him, he would consider going to a

third country because as he put it,

"I could

not return to the USSR."

When we begin the

next session with him, we will tell him that

his statement with respect to not having

harmed the US is erroneous.

We will refer

to his direct participation in the Barghoorn

case and to

the fact that his very mission

we will advise him

point in the future that country would be fully

apprised to our information concerning his mis-

sion to the lest and the details of his personal

behavior.

under which the polygraph was administered cannot be as-

I. Incarceration and Interrogation

Many aspects of this case did not go according to

plan, but one that did was the incarceration of Nosenko.

un Office of Security representative who periodicall

guarded Nosenko from November 1964 to May 1968, whe

questioned on 21 July 1976, described the regime as

Security Officer (SO):

Q: Nhat does visual custody observance mean? You

the door was a

type where we

were actually positioned outside the door on a

24-hour basis.

There were two security escorts

on duty 24 hours a day, and we were instructed

to maintain visual observance of him--just ob-

serve his activities.

A few of the

points will be summarized in the succeeding para-

graphs.

After he "failed" his polygraph on 6 April 1964,

Nosenko was interrogated on an almost daily basis for

nearly three weeks.

During this period a paricipant

commented that "we have

received daily support for our

conviction that Subject was sent on a KGB mission . . . "

and by 25 April the interrogators concluded:

We have gone about as far as the time permitted

for the

"information gathering" phase of the

interrogation will allow

The task now

is to sort out and analyze the results of the

past three weeks of interrogation, to mark

out the

strong and the weak portions of

Subject's story, and to plan the strategy and

tactics of the next phase ..

In the mean-

time, Subject will be given a short haircut

to dramatize his situation, and a week or so

without interrogations to emphasize our willing-

ness to keep his (sic) indefinitely and to

heighten his tensions.

Meanwhile, Golitsyn had been brought into the case

and was being employed as a behind-the-scenes consultant

in connection with the interrogations.

Golitsyn was

given for analysis voluminous material relating to the

case and was

told that "one of the most perplexing aspects

of the Nosenko case to us at the present time

is not

whether he was sent (we all certainly agree with your

view that he was sent on a mission) but the exact nature

Golitsyn's role will

be covered more thoroughly in a

From the

case had opened our eyes not only to security

threats

in our own midst and within the US

government, but also had revealed that many

other important sources were in fact KGB provo-

cations and in fact that our entire counterin-

telligence effort,

double agents

and all, may

be contaminated

and useless.

According to the theory being developed, no Soviet

or Soviet Bloc agent was immune from suspicior. if his re-

porting tended to confirm anything that Nosenko had said.

Agents who were then currently producing intelligence,

not only for CIA but also for the FBI and certain European

intelligence services, all came under heavy suspicion.

The single exception was

The latter,

although

he had confirmed Nosenko's identity (which had

itself been

in doubt at one point) as well as

his affiliation with the

KGB, also contributed the elaborate rationale according

to which the KGB was

sacrificing Nosenko and a host of

other agents and operations to protect even more important,

if somewhat nebulous, assets and plans.

Golitsyn thus be-

came the touchstone

against whom the trustworthiness of

all other agents was judged.

Because Nosenko refused to "break," however, it was

hard to adduce proof of Golitsyn's theory substantial

enough to convince Helms,

the FBI, and other officials

and organizations not so

deeply committed

to the theory.

A lengthy paper on SR/CI's findings on this subject was

ilways in the offing but was continually delayed; it did

not finally materialize until February 1967.

On the

other hand, no one had at his fingertips the vast array

of facts,

and suppositions masquerading as facts, on

which the case was based.

The theory was therefore

difficult to challenge; there may even have been

reluctance

to do so, because the main proponents of the disinformacion

theory frequently referred to unhappy consequences that

would flow from abandoning the course upon which the

Agency had embarked.

Should the Agency change course,

fer tae, though imi-defined,

by simply returning Nosenko to Soviet hands,

terrible,

consequences would cer-

tainly ensue.

As the principal case officer said (again

to his

know, the US government has every intention

of protecting itself against this dangerous

provocation by detaining him indefinitely.

The decision was therefore taken, with Helms' approval,

to build a new

detention facility.

The cell constructed

for Nosenko's occupancy was essentially a vault

enveloped

by a barracks-type building. Its projected amenities were

described as follows:

a.

Small cell with concrete floor and

ceiling and walls lined with

metal.

b. No electrical outlets in the cell,

lighting to be recessed

and grilled and con-

trolled from the day room.

c. No window in the cell.

d. One entrance to the cell which will be

of the metal bar type with

an exterior door in

front of this and a sliding panel in the exte-

rior door which will permit a complete view of

the cell area.

Plexiglass will be used in the

observation panel rather than glass.

on the same evrning, immediately prior to his

removal to new quarters.

The purpose of this

session was not

to deliver a new message of

any sort,

or to give Subject "another

chance

to confess";

everything that could be said had

already been

said by

the previous inter-

rogators,

and there was no doubt that Subject

inderstood pertectly well the meaning anc

importance of what had been said to hin: also.

it was recognized that Subject would sense an

impending move or change of

some sort,

and that

it was inevitable that he would hope that the

change would be for the better until he saw

otherwise.

The purpose of the confrontation

was rather to close the circle:

to show him

that although (the principal case officer) had

not seen him for over a year nothing had changed,

and nothing would change until he told the

truth.

An additional effect would be to empha-

size that the interrogators who had worked with

him in

the interim were fully responsible and

authoritative, and

that just as Subject had been

told when he was first locked up in April 1964,

what he was up

against was the collapse of the

operation in which he was involved.

Finally,

[the principal case officer) would

stress ...

that the "investigation is closed" and that

Subject had only prolonged and total isolation

to look forward

to now unless and until he

decides to confess.

the meeting took place just about as planned.

It lasted for 15 minutes only (2100 to 2115)

and was essentially a formality, although it

is hoped

that Subject will have reason to re-

flect on it in the months ahead.

seen from

the attached summary transcript,

Subject did not display any hesitancy of

indecision, and his answers and statements

were made in a mechanical manner.

With

the exception of being allowed certain books, carefully

selected for him by SR Division, Nosenko was confined

under conditions

that were as close to stimulus-free as

maintaining him in good physical

health.

At this point, we must pause to consider for the

moment how the period that follows is to be covered.

Because there were long periods of time when no human

being other than the guards was in contact with Nosenko,

Yet this period cannot be ignored. It constituted

over half of Nosenko's solitary confinement. And that

three-and-a-half-year period amounts to five percent of

the total life span

of a man who lives to be 70.

Obviously, then, this period will weigh heavily

in the findings made

at the conclusion of our study.

For these findings to be valid, they must be made on

the basis of as much empirical

evidence as can be

gathered.

Because the effect on Nosenko of this long

period of confinement can only be dealt with speculatively,

Representatives of SR Division, the Office of

Security, and the Medical Staff met in the SR

Conference Room from approximately 1400 to

1430 hours this date to discuss recent inci-

dents in Nosenko's behavior and a forthcoming

examination of Nosenko by [a doctor]

The undersigned entered the Conference Room

after discussions had begun,

initial remarks are not noted here.

(An Agency psychiatrist) first described to

those present his examination of Nosenko on

21 January 1966 and stated his opinion, based

on observations made at that time, that the

recent outbursts by Nosenko and his threats

of suicide are all

contrived

and do not

represent an involuntary reaction on his

part.

Nosenko's recent behavior started with

suicide threats, then progressed to auditory

hallucinations, and has now reached the stage

where every inanimate object in his environ-

ment, including

the trees and the wind out-

doors, are talking to him.

(The psychiatrist)

expressed his view that, if Nosenko actually

does hear voices, it could normally be expected

that they would

speak to hin in his native

rather than in English as he told the

base medical technician during a recent visit.

Nosenko apparently now realizes this ((the

On 1 March 1966,

the principal case officer and

and SR/CI representative accompanied the two doctors

to another examination of Nosenko.

One doctor conducted

the examination, while the other members of the party

observed it on a television screen.

None of the four

men

gave much credence

to Nosenko's clain of hearing

voices, but the following was noted:

Though Nosenko's mental difficulties are

it is also evident that

there has been a change in his outlook since

SR last had direct contact with him in August

1965.

If by nothing else, this is evidenced

by the single fact that he has taken a new

tack in his relationship with CIA:

He has

apparently given up hope that his legend of

"another source" can help him escape his

predicament and, as (the psychiatrist) earlier

proposed, is using his "voices" (except for

which Nosenko clains to be sane) to force

some sort of change.

to interpret the significance of his remarks

and behavior during

(a second doctor's) inter-

view--on one hand

there were

indications of

deterioration; on the other Nosenko is an

astute actor, who was clearly playing a role

for (that doctor].

Bearing in mind that these

superficial indications may well be a part of

this act, Nosenko appeared far more subdued,

almost despondent, compared with six months

ago.

For most of the interview, he slouched

or sat listlessly in his chair and only sel-

dom did he lean

forward and, by the motions

of his hands, attempt to reach and to secure

the understanding and belief of the interviewer.

There appears

to

be a slight deterioration in

his English-language fluency (see transcript

below) and his replies were broken by frequent

pauses, incomplete sentences, and confusing

revisions.

Nosenko's changed outlook next took the form of two

letters to the principal case officer, written in mid-

April 1966 (although incorrectly dated, because by now

(The reference to "special interrogation techniques"

harked back to a 13 January 1966 discussion with Helms,

during which the latter had stated that "he was inclined

to try special techniques on Subject in the hope that

they might somehow

provide the answers we are seeking."

In this context, "special techniques" was a euphemism for

the use of drugs as aids in interrogation.

As will be

shown later,

although Helms was willing

to discuss the

use of such

techniques in this case, he in fact

never gave

Preparation of the report was somewhat complicated

by disagreements between ClA and the FBl,

as well as

between

intra-CIA disagreement stemmed from differing views on

the validity of Golitsyn information.

Whereas SB Division

insisted that Nosenko, during his KGB career, had never

"served in

Nosenko's

claims regarding his KGB service.

bland assertion, however, was met by Chief, SR with

the statement,

sthere are things

ir this

case that

you do not know about.

Noneiheless,

in summing up

the sessions, the psychologist had this to say:

I am totally at a loss to even attempt to

rationalize why

this much

pathology would be used as a legend.

Nothing

could be served other than to discredit the

man to whon it was assigned.

In some remote

sense--to me--it might have been felt it would

evoke sympathy but this is really far out and

a very

dangerous gamble on their part.

The

manner in which he has told his story and

the nuances he has introduced would require

great ingenuity and preparation.

From my

standpoint,

he has been essentially convincing

and accurate in general if not always truthful

in detail.

Here I am talking about the psycho-

logical data only--I am not prepared to ex-

press an opinion

on other aspects.

Within

whaterer

frame of reference

ical evidence would indicate that he is Nosenko,

the son of Ivan Nosenko.

His life story is

essentially as he has described it.

It is

obviously distorted in places but in each case

there

is a probable psychological reason for

the distortion and deception.

No man is a

good reporter on himself and we all use

rationalization to avoid seeing ourselves as

others see us.

My opinion, for whatever it

is north, is that Nosenko cannot be broken

outside

the context of his life story and

personality structure.

It should be noted

here that the life story is completely com-

patible with

the personality

structure as

projected by psychological tests.

The psychologist claims now that he had more doubts

about the

validity of the SR view of Nosenko than he

felt it wise to express.

The following excerpt from a

nemo randum

of conversation, dated 4 August 1976, gives

his memory of the situation facing him:

views with Nosenko on

The reason

to Helms (who was by

but still riding herd

on the case), described the interviews as "unrewarding

in terms of producing new information or insights . ..

It was obvious that Subject had given some thought . . .

to improving and smoothing over some of the rougher

spots in his story."

By the end of 1965, there were others in SR Division

who doubted the thesis,

and one of them was willing to

risk his career by putting his thoughts on paper in a

31-page memorandum

SR commenting on a "sterile"

version of SR/CI's

"notebook" documenting the case against

Nosenko. It began:

I find the evidence that Nosenko is a

evidence

used in the notebook to condemn him as

a KGB agent.

It is because I am concerned about the serious

ramifications of a

wrong verdict that I wish to

set forth my dissenting views in considerable

detail.

If the present verdict of "guilty" is

right I believe there must be satisfactory

answers to the questions raised herein; if it is

wrong--as I believe it is--it should be

he provided.

In the 25 March 1964 memo to

DDP, it is

that "A comparison of

we have had an operational relationship shows

that all of them were consistently better able

The three persons in the Clandestine Services

with the background and experience to make such

a judgnent regarding Nosenko's production and

access agree that they are incorrect.

No KGB

officer has been able to provide more useful

intelligence than Nosenko has; experience has

shown that intelligence usefulness of KGB

officers in general is "practically nil."

Golitsyn's was nil.

text, therefore,

Nosenko's intelligence produc-

therefore be made on the basis of his counter-

Not long thereafter, Helms called the author by

phone and told him he

was having a

with the Nosenko case.

He said that he was therefore

going to turn it over to the ddCI, who he hoped could

get to the bottom of it for him.

Helms also asked the

author if he would agree to Helms' passing his paper to

an Agency psychologist.

A few days later, Helms again

called the author by phone and asked if he would agree

to his paper's being passed to both the DDCI and the

Director of Security.

N. Helms Takes Control

With the third anniversary of Nosenko's confinement

drawing near, no resolution of the case was yet in sight.

The FBI continued

to take what Chief, SB described as a

"neutral position" in regard to Nosenko.

The conflicting views of the various interested

parties are not sufficiently

relevant to the purposes of

this study to require a detailed coverage.

What is

relevant is the fact that the stand-off increased Helms'

impatience with continued delay.

He therefore initiated

a number of measures that gradually took handling of the

entire Nosenko matter out of the hands of the SB Division.

The first of these measures was to instruct the DDCI to

undertake a thorough study of the Nosenko case.

When debriefed regarding the Nosenko case on

21

September 1976, the former DDCI remembered his

involvement

as follows:

DDCI: I became concerned as a result of Dick Helms

(saying) that there was a matter that worried

him very deeply, that needed resolution, that he

doubted that there was enough objectivity amongst

the people in the Agency who handled it so far

to arrive at any kind of a really objective

solution to the problen, and it was very sensitive

indeed, would I please look into it and let him

know my conclusions.

cas confined and we had to do something eth him

one way or the other.

Q: He said that it was wrong to keep him confined?

DICI:

Yes, he was really distressed about the fact that

this fellow had been in confinement so long and

that they had never been able to arrive at a con-

clusion as to whether he was a bona fide or whether

he was a plant,

and he just had to get it resolved

and something had to be done to get this fellow

in a... oh, I've forgotten just how he put it,

• My second memorandum to Helms was to the

effect that, whatever the case, I didn't believe

that Nosenko was any threat whatsoever to the

Agency, that he ought to be rehabilitated, and

I got a free hand from Helms to go ahead with

the idea of rehabilitating him.

but we

I went on to point out to the (DDCI] that I

and had so recommended

on numerous

occasions in the past, that it would make a lot

of sense

for

(a member) of my Office to take

over the interrogation of (Nosenko] in order

to resolve several discrepancies that had always

concerned us.

Further,

said that the polygraph

examination given (Nosenko]

at the outset was.

designed only to "break hin" and was not an ob-

jective

designed to establish

or deny his bona fides.

I indicated that the

Director had approved this idea but that I had

been unable to sell the idea to . . . SB Division.

The DDCI] said that he thought this was an

excellent idea.

He agreed with me that we had

everything to gain and nothing to lose through

such a course of

action and that he would

to the Director.

I pointed out to

him that one of the things that had always con-

cerned us was that the Soviet Bloc Division had

never released any verbatim transcripts covering

their many interrogations of (Nosenko and that

we could make our judgment only on the basis of

written summaries prepared by the Division.

Thus, acting under the DDCI's orders, the Office of

Security transferred Nosenko to "a decent,

respectable

safehouse."

SB Division was cut out of the case, as was

the CI Staff.

The following is a summary report prepared on 16

November 1967:

This questioning of Nosenko was paralleled by a

separate investigation conduced by the FBI.

Results

were covered in two reports published at about the

same e me,

the FBI's on

20 September 1968 and the ClA

Security's on 1 October 1968.

The essence of the Office of Security's findings

was expressed

in

a covering memorandum to the Direct:

of Security:

That to gate is so on to the ca

during 1953-January 1964, that Nosenko was

not dispatched by the KGB, and that his pre-

vious lies and exaggerations are not actually

of material significance at this time.

The conclusions of the FBI report were more sweep-

ing:

1.

The current interrogations and collateral

inquiries have established a number of significant

omissions and inaccuracies in the February 1968

CIA paper and have invalidated the vast majority

of conclusions on which that paper relied to

discredit Nosenko.

normally have been accessible to him in his

positions.

There is no substantial

basis for doubting his bona fides as a defector.

The variety and volume of information

provided by Nosenko is such that it is considered

impossible that he acquired the infornation

only by KGB briefing.

It is also illogical and

implausible that the KGB would have dis-

patched an officer of his caliber with in-

structions to disclose the variety and volume

of valuable information furnished by him. No

compensatory objective is apparent.

In the interest of both

intelligence and counterintelligence agencies

of the government, interviews should be con-

tinued

to exhaust

his knowledge.

There should be a thorough re-examina-

tion of all information and cases emanating from

Nosenko and other defectors where the decision

for action, or lack of action, was previously

influenced

by the presumption

that Nosenko was

not a bona fide defector.

Despite the above findings, the CI Staff never gave

up its contention that Nosenko

was a KGB-dispatched agent.

On 31 January 1969, the CI Staff argued that to accept

Nosenko's bona fides meant repudiating Golitsyn, "the

only proven reliable source about the KGB for a period of

time which appears to be vital to both Nosenko and CIA."

An undated memorandum written by the Office of

Security officer in charge of Nosenko essentially brings

this chronicle to a close:

Since April 1969, Nosenko has had his own private

residence and since June 1969, his own automobile.

Even prior to April 1969, Nosenko could have, if

he chose to do so, acted

in a way seriously

adverse to the best

interests of this Agency

since control was not of such a nature as to

preclude independent action by Nosenko.

It is the opinion of Agency representatives in

regular contact with Nosenko that he is genuinely

interested in maintaining the anonymity of his

current identity, that is, not becoming publicly

known as identical to Nosenko.

As an example,

he has very interested in having a facial birth-

mark removed.

However, he has on numerous

occasions indicated his interest in participating

under the Nosenko identity in some action or

activity which would "hurt the KGB." Nosenko

considers that he has certain capabilities

and knowledge which could be useful in the

effort of the United States government against

This interest has not been associated

with any particular curiosity

in regard to the

activities of this Agency ...

Nosenko has consistently

expressed his deep

interest in obtaining United States citizen-

ship as soon as possible.

He realizes that

under normal circunstances, citizenship could

not be obtained until February 1974, but also

is aware that citizenship can be obtained in

less than the normal waiting period by legisla-

tive action.

Nosenko is considered by Agency personnel and

FBI

personnel in contact with Nosenko to have

made an unusual adaptation to Anerican life.

He lives like a normal Anerican and has an

obvious pride in his home and personal effects.

His home life from all appearances is quite

caln.

The fluency of Nosenko in the English

language has greatly increased and there is

no difficulty in understanding Nosenko or in

his ability to express his thoughts. Obviously

his accent and occasional incorrect sentence

structure (and nisspelling of words) has not

been eliminated and probably will never be

entirely eliminated.

Nosenko continues to complete vork assignments

expeditiously and with Interest.

As indicated

above, Nosenko is very interested in doing

"something active" which is understandable.

Full consideration should be given to this

interest since if properly controlled and

channeled, could be used in a way adverse to

the best interest of the KGB.

Nosenko has since become a United Stated citizen,

nas married an American woman

continues to lead a normal

life, and works productively for the CIA.

CHAPTER IV

Nosenko's Contribution: A Summary Evaluation

Any attempt to assess Nosenko's value to the US govern-

ment must begin by pointing out that he might well have been

able to contribute more had

he been permitted to do so.

¡ Unfortunately, we were

unwilling to give serious considera-

tion to his stated desire to assist us in making recruitments

of Soviet officials; we discounted Nosenko's suggestions

along this line as possibly part of a plan to embarrass the

US government.

There is no telling what potential recruit-

ment targets

might have emerged had we, soon after Nosenko's

defection, briefed him with such targets in view.

In this part of our study, we therefore confine our-

siderable odds, Nosenko was able to make. Let us take them,

siderable odds,

very briefly, oie by one.

A. Information on KGB Personnel

The Office of Security's 1968 report summed up

Nosenko's contribution in this field as follows:

Nosenko has furnished information concerning

perhaps 2,000 KGB officers and 300 KGB agents

or operative contacts (here the terms agents

or operative contacts are used to refer to

Soviet nationals), mainly in the Second Chief

Directorate or internal KGB organizations.

However, he has identified approximately 250

forner of current First Chief Directorate

officers and there is a considerable exchange

of officers between the Fed and seD. In

addition, numerous officers of the sch and

other internal KGB organizations travel abroad

with delegations, tourist groups, and as

visitors to various major exhibitions such

as World's Fairs.

It is impossible at this

time to estimate

the number of KGB officers

identified by Nosenko who have been outside

the Soviet Bloc since his defection or who

will be out some time in the future.

There has been very little attempted exploi-

tatio: of information furnished by Nosenko

concerning other KGB officers and, therefore,

the possible value of this information to

United States Intelligence cannot be esti-

mated nor can the potential damage to the

KGB be estimated.

B. KGB Recruitment Efforts Against US Citizens

Most of Nosenko's own operational experience with

the KGB involved efforts against Us citizens,

either

visitors to the USSR or members of the US embassy in

As a result of this background, Nosenko was

able to provide some 238 identifications of, or leads

O, Americans in whom the KGB had displayed

some interest.

Some of the KGB operational efforts culminated in

"recruitments" that, according to Nosenko, were more

statistical than real; the KGB played the

numbers game,

for purposes of year-end reporting.

Nonetheless,

Nosenko's reporting did result in

the uncovering of

certain US citizens genuinely working for Soviet intel-

ligence:

Us Army sergeant Robert &. Johnson,

who had been recruited in 1953, was arrested

in 1965 on the basis of a Nosenko lead

agent assigned to a US military installation

outside Paris who was providing

the KGB with

inportant documents as of 1962-1963.

from there.

Excerpts from a preliminary

damage assessment are included below:

The full extent of damage will only

be known when the current review of

documents by all affected agencies

is completed.

ments to date, indicate that as a re-

clandestine photography of documents, and

later as a courier between Johnson

and his

KGB handlers.

C. Moscow Microphones

In 1962, Golitsyn had in general terms reported on

the existence of microphones in the US embassy in Moscow.

This information was promptly sent to the Department of

State, but no action was taken; lack of specificity was

cited

as one of

the reasons.

It was not until Nosenko's

more detailed information was communicated to the Depart-

ment of State

in March and June 1964 that action was

taken that led to th: uncovering of a system of 52 micro-

phones, beginning in April ot that year.

Of the micro-

found,

42 were active at the time of discovery.

These microphones covered most of the offices in the

embassy most significant from the Soviet standpoint.

The British counterintelligence service stated in

"leading candidate" for suspicion as

a result of the Golitsyn information, it was in fact

Nosenko's information that

"was to clinch the identifica-

tion of Vassall as the spy."

CHAPTER V

The Analytical Foundations of the "Monster Plot"

For the purposes of this study, we have not chosen to

duplicate the mammoth effort put into analyzing and validating

by the FBI; we have reviewed their work and can find no pos-

sible reason to challenge their findings.

whom we now believe to have been cooperative and acting in

good faith.

A. Lack of Systematic Interrogation

At no time between June 1962 and October 1967 was

Vosenko afforded the kind of systeratic, objective, non-

nostile interrogation by well-informed professional in-

telligence officers which had otherwise been standard

operating procedures in dealing with defectors and in-

place sources from Soviet and East European intelligence

services.

Z2122RE

We now examine the manifestations and consequences

of this problem at various stages of the case.

disastrous problem of communication:

-argeved on see scene for the second Rueetans

with native Russian,

filled with assurance derived from his involve-

ment in two important operations concerning

CIA sources in Soviet Military Intelligence:

Popov from 1953 to 1958, and Penkovskiy (who

was

still working in-place as of the June 1962

Nosenko mectings).

Infortunately, the com-

nunication problem was exacerbated, not only

by the case officer's showing off his know-

ledge to Nosenko rather than listening to what

Nosenko nad to say,

but also by the case offi-

cer's inaccurate

summarizations in English

rather than translations of Nosenko's state-

ments in

Russian.

This case officer's

presence

was

justified by

the fact that the

senior

case

officer could

not cope with

Nosenko's

Russian,

but the second case officer distorted so much

of what was said that he was a barrier of com-

munication.

The second meeting,

the longest of the five,

was further disorganized by the fact that Nosenko

arrived half-drunk

from partying the previous day

and most of the night.

Even during the nearly eight-

hour interview, Nosenko continued to drink.

This

point was consistently overlooked or ignored in later

examination of boastful claims Nosenko made during

this meeting; e.g., Nosenko personally handled the

Langelle/Popov

case, Nosenko personally ran

the

operation against a

US

security officer, Nosenko

personally talked

to a US

code clerk to try

to re-

cruit him, etc.

When confronted in hostile interroga-

tions in 1964 and 1965 with these claims, he denied

personal participation in all three instances (other

than directing the code clerk case behind the scene)

and said that if he had said such things in 1962 it

was because he was either drunk or under very strong

tension at the time.

Such explanations were not con-

claims were let stand as evidence of his mendacity.

of meetings in Geneva, in

January and February 1964,

were sonewhat better

organized,

but--given the already prevailing belief

that Nosenko was a KGB controlled agent--he was not

carefully questioned on the information he gave.

This was partly because it was considered of

prinary importance not to reveal even by implica-

tion how much we

already knew, lest his mission

include elicitation of information CIA had received

from Golitsyn or other sources considered bona fide.

Debriefings in the United States after Nosenko's

defection were similarly limited to noncontroversial

generalities and were not noteworthy for attention to

accuracy and detail.

(Although most of the debrief-

ings of this period were taped, none of these tapes

was ever transcribed.

Notes were taken, and reports

were then written up on the basis of the notes.

This three-stage process did not always result in

an accurate version of what had been said.)

importance to the CIA concerns in this case, were:

by Golitsyn, whose aim was to trap Nosenko into

--to acquire fuller background on Nosenko's

alleged duties and activities in his various

KGB positions in order to use his own informa-

tion against him in the hostile

interrogation

period

that was to follow.

The January-March 1965 hostile interrogations

were carefully structured and systematic but were

not designed to collect information.

The information

Nosenko provided in these sessions

was consistently

and intentionally ignored, as the stated objectives

were to force Nosenko to agree with his interrogators

that (1) he did not know what he should have known

(according to ClA assumptions), and (2) that he had

not held the positions in the KGB that he claimed.

This objective was

"successfully" achieved in the

eyes of the

sign

interrogators by bringing Nosenko to

statements

that purported to

summarize his

statements of inadequacy of both knowledge and

ped hematie to sigh the secon

Each time, in signing these so-called

objected that the way they

"ere wooded dissented wiet he had said; however,

he acknowledged his inability to get his interroga-

tor

to

listen to what he was trying to tell him and

therefore his

inability to reword these papers in

any manner satisfactory to him.

When given one key

"protocol"

to sign--one that was a "confession"

that he nad been

sent by the KGB to deceive CIA,

and that he had lied purposely on behalf of the

KGB--he said that, if his signing this document

would serve some good purpose of CIA or of the US

government in general, he would do so, but only with

his interrogators'

clear understanding that the

entire "confession" was untrue.

Under these circum-

stances, his interrogators declined to have him sign

this document.

Thus this series of interrogations

failed in its ultimate objective--that of "breaking"

Nosenko.

Subsequent interrogation sessions were not con-

structed

to collect information any more

than the

previous ones but were designed to collect further

damaging evidence of Nosenko's ignorance

about the

KGB and of the areas in his reporting to which he

was "most sensitive" and that therefore were most

revealing of his "true KGB missions."

to Nosenko and a large amount of paper was

generated in consequence,

the canons of proper

interrogation were rarely observed.

4. Time Devoted to Debriefing or Interrogation

A point that can easily be overlooked is that,

of the total period of Nosenko's incarceration, a

relatively modest amount of time was devoted to

actually debriefing or interrogating him. The most

generous estimate we can make is that approximately

292 days were at least in part devoted to debriefing

or interrogating Nosenko, out of a total of 1,277

days'

incarceration.

Thus,

from the standpoint of

obtaining infornation,

about 77 percent, or more

than three-quarters, of the detention period was

downtime.

B. Faulty Record of Conversations with Nosenko

The outcome of the Nosenko case was prejudiced at

the outset by the establishment of a faulty record.

Let us look first at what happened during the June

1962 meetings.

The inadequacy of the principal case

officer's Russian for use

in

an interrogation has already

been mentioned.

The problem was exacerbated

the fact that he nonetheless took notes on

ed, toNesenko by

is purported to have said

which became part of the of-

Ficial record without their being compared with tape

transcriptions by a more competent Russian linguist.

If anything, the role of the second case officer,

who had a native conmand of Russian but little patience

with detail, simply compounded the errors.

Returning

from Geneva on 15 June, the principal case officer on

18 June began to dictate, using his own notes, a series

of 30 memoranda covering highlights of the meetings as

he had understood them.

These memoranda were reviewed

by the second case officer as they were typed, but he

made only minor additions or corrections.

The so-called "transcripts of the tapes" from the

five meetings were then prepared by the second case of-

ficer between the week of 19 June and mid-August 1962.

contrary to the usual procedure, the second case officer

did not first transcribe from the tades into the combination

of Russian and English (predominantly Russian)

actually used in the meetings,

and then make his

translations on the basis of transcrip.ions. Rather,

he dictated them into English directly, using the error-

filled nemoranda of the principal case officer's for

guidance.

In March 1964 a KGB defector of 1954 vintage was

brought into the case to examine Nosenko's reporting

in terms of his own expertise on personalities, file

procedures, reorganizations, etc.

He concentrated on

the early years

of Nosenko's

career, particularly 1952

and 1953.

In a resultant menorandum dated 12 March 1964,

he commented as

follows:

The undersigned began work on this special project

by reviewing the taped recordings of

the meetings

only, without reference to the meeting transcripts,

believing that it would be possible and preferable

to get all the necessary information and other

material firsthand in this way.

From the begin-

ning, however, it was obvious that this would be

very

difficult, if not in many cases impossible;

the early tapes (Nos. l-6 and especially No. 1)

were very poor in quality.

(These are the tapes

for meetings No. 1 and 2.)

After proceeding thus far in a review of the

tapes, the undersigned then switched over and

began

reviewing the transcripts alone and

without reference to the tapes.

This method

also quickly proved unsatisfactory; from his

memory of the discussions as actually presented

and hard to "caten,

although poorly reproduced

undersigned soon was

able to tell that the transcripts are, to say

the least, faulty.

A point-by-point review of the tapes and tran-

scripts was

then initiated and has been pursued

until the present time by the undersigned.

the course of this review, a large number of

errors--omissions and other discrepancies--

have been discovered scattered throughout the

transcript coverage of the meetings recorded on

the tapes.

It is impossible to make enduring pronounce-

ments of the

following type without knowing the

whole situation

and being fully aware of all

the motives and factors--personal and profes-

sional--involved, yet it should be noted that

the undersigned

in many places throughout the

records of the meetings

has encountered exanples

of what he would consider errors in the handling

and conduct of those meetings.

Let it suffice

nerely to register this point here; notes on

this subject will be drafted and presented in

later papers.

He then proceeded to cite nine major examples of

errors, omissions, distortions, and procedures characteristic

of the second case officer's transcripts (and performance

luring the meetings). He concluded by saying:

The foregoing present but a few examples of

errors,

plete report of all such

be prepared upon request.

The "complete report" was never prepared, and it may

never have been requested.

Later, the first series of hostile interrogations of

rosenko,

beginning on 6 April 1964, was monitored by

the 1954 defector,

who listened from an adjacent room.

On 17 April, Nosenko was challenged concerning a clain'

he had supposedly made

in June 1962 (according to the

second case officer's

"transcripts") that he in person

had recruited an American professor of Slavic languages

visiting in bulgaria during the time Nosenko was on TY

for briefing sessions with the Bulgarian internal coun-

terintelligence service.

Nosenko denied ever having

made such a clain and went into lengthy detail explaining

just what had happened.

In effect,

because by chance he

was in Sofia when

the Bulgarians

were planning their

operation against Professor Horace G. Lunt, he gave the

Bulgarians advice on how to go about the compromise opera-

tion--a homosexual one--and how to handle the actual

confrontation and recruitment.

Apparently as

a result

of listening to Nosenko tell his story, and his vehement

denial of any clain to personal neetings with Lunt, the

1954 defector went back to the 1962 tape recordings and

SECRET

NW 65990 Docld:32375547 Page 97

104-10211-10004

SEGRET

-93-

retranscribed exactly what Nosenko had said on the two

different occasions

in 1962 when he had referred to

this case.

The retranscription clearly verified

Nosenko's

detail.

Nonetheless, all

subsequent papers

on

the Nosenko bona fides question

included reference

to his having clained in

1962 that he recruited Lunt

in person.

His denial of such a statement in all sessions

from 1964 onward was lost from

sight.

In the course of the second series of hostile

interrogations in January-March 1965, a still further

discovery was made by the 1954 defector when Nosenko

was challenged on another "clain" supposedly made in

1962, which Nosenko also denied having made.

Reviewing

the tape recording of the 1962 meeting in which the

alleged claim had been made, the 1954 defector once

record was erroneous, and

that Nosenko was right again.

Later in 1965, retranscription of the 1962 tapes

was begun, faithfully transcribing Russian when Russian

was used,

and English when English

was spoken.

These

transcripts were

not translated into full English,

however,

until mid-1968 under the auspices of the

Office

of Security reexamination of the entire Nosenko case.

In late 1968-early 1969, a line-by-line commentary

on the more significant discrepancies between the two

versions was prepared. It required some 35 pages to

cover only the major errors and the effects they had

had in supporting

the charge that Nosenko was a false

• defector who "lied" and "changed stories."

C. CIA Misapprehensions Regarding Nosenko's Life Story

"perishable" information; i.e., positive

intelligence and important agent leads.

The next step

usually is to obtain a biographic statement

In February 1964, all information relating to his

life story, collated

from transcripts of meetings with

Nosenko (in Geneva, 1962 and 1964), was presented in written

form to Nosenko for him to correct

or expand upon.

This

draft was so full of errors derived fron defective

transcripts that only in the most general terns did

it correspond to his actual statements.

At this time,

however,

Nosenko was restless,

tense, and inpatient

with the tedious interviews with which ClA was trying

to keep him occupied.

It appears obvious that he paid

scant attention to the dates or terminology used in

chis draft,

because he nade only one noticeable change:

se insisted on deletion of a statenent attributed to hin

to the effect that he had attended a one-year course in

counterintelligence at the beginning of his KGB career

(a mistake dating fron the 1962 "transcripts" by the

second case officer).

Given the volume of other

erroneous

biography

one can only assune that he considered this

an exercise of no

particular inportance.

When hostile interrogations

began on 6 April 1964,

the inaccurate biography was used as the base point for

measuring so-called "lies" about Nosenko's entire life

story.

It therefore caused him

to be accused time and

again of "changing his stories."

One of the first wrangles that arose in the hostile

interrogations concerned his responses

to

questions on

his schooling.

Among other aspects of this subject,

Nosenko told his interrogators that he had spent approxi-

mately three years during world War II

in various naval

preparatory schools--(rough equivalent of American high

school-level military

"academies").

The problem that

arose

in this instance was

traceable first

to a careless

transcription by

the second case officer but was exacerbated

by ignorance on the part of the interrogators concerning

the subject under discussion.

Because it typifies other

misapprehensions that complicate the Nosenko case, this

example is worth relating in detail.

The second case officer "transcribed" the tape of

the 25 January 1964 meeting in Geneva, quoting Nosenko

thus (underlining is ours):

in

Later, when shown photographs of

Nosenko he positively identified him as the

same

man he had known in Leningrad in the

period

1944 to 1946 and gratuitously provided

the names of six schoolmates from Leningrad

that Nosenko should remember because they were

prominent members of the student body there.

Nosenko was subsequently queried about three

of these names, but out of context and with

no indication of who and what they might be.

He immediately identified then as schoolmates,

but positively affirmed that two

of them had

been the roommates

in Kuybyshev in 1941-1942,

while the other had been in the school in Baku.

According to Nosenko, none had gone on to

Leningrad.

Of the names provided by Artamonov,

Nosenko mentioned a fourth one independently,

but although he originally placed him in

Leningrad he later moved him to Kuybyshev and

stated

categorically that he saw him for the

last time in Moscow in 1942, before going to

Leningrad.

Artamonov, whose own elementary

and secondary schooling is a curious parallel

to Nosenko's, has provided other information on

the schools and dates which Nosenko claims to

have attended which is incompatible with Nosenko's

story but it has not been believed advisable to

requery Artamonov on this until we can be

certain that Artamonov is not deliberately

trying to substantiate Nosenko's bona fides

according to a prearranged plan which misfired

owing to crossed signals or Nosenko's poor

memory.

1.

Nosenko had been misquoted in the

second

case officer's transcript,

because

the second case officer did

not understand

what he was talking about.

He had referred

specifically to the "Leningrad Naval

Preparatory School named after Frunze," a

fact once again uncovered by the 1954 defector's

rechecking of the meeting tape, but not until

May 1965.

When Nosenko "admitted" ro his

interrogators in April 1964 that he had not

attended

the Academy, he didn't know this was

considered an admission; he never realized

his interrogators had thought he had made such

a clain.

2.

In general, wosenko's interrogators

overestimated their

substantive background.

Nosenko's "stories" about the several naval

preparatory schools he had attended during the

war are difficult to follow, because war

conditions brought about a number of reloca-

tions of these schools:

the Leningrad School

was relocated to Omsk

oblast but was still

called Leningrad School; the Moscow School was

relocated first to Achinsk, then to Kuybyshev,

but was still the Moscow School, etc.

Nosenko's

interrogators were almost totally ignorant of

these matters but did not know they were.

Because they were unable to follow his detailed

description

of

all these changes

(documented

by other informed sources, including Soviet

historians),

they thought something was wrong

with Nosenko, not with themselves.

D. Errors or Omissions in Available CIA Headquarters

Records

In this category lie many of the causes of error

in building the cast against Nosenko.

We are not

speaking here of transcript errors but rather of some-

times quite understandable lacunae in CIA's collateral

records.

Two important examples concern John Abidian, the

State Department Security officer in Moscow who was,

according to Nosenko, an American for whom Nosenko was

operationally solely responsible.

One point at issue was whether Abidian employed

a maid in Moscow who hould have been in a position to

treat Abidian's clothes with a so-called "thief powder"

used by the KGB to facilitate postal surveillance.

Nosenko claimed that there was such a maid, and that

her actions enabled the KGB to pick up three operational

letters Abidian mailed for CIA, when the powder activated

a sensor in the Soviet postal system.

The second point concerns the question of whether

Nosenko lied in claiming that Abidian cased a dead-drop

site in Moscow that we

assumed Nosenko knew

was crucial

to the KGB apprehension of Oleg Penkovskiy.

On the first point, ClA had no record of Abidian's

having a maid, because he did not formally hire one until

a few months after his last letter mailing for CIA. How-

the maid who served an American woman in the

embassy al:o informally took care of Abidian's apartment

throughout the time period in question. Thus, we were

wrong., Nosenko was right.

The second point has yet to be subjected to con-

"cased" the Penkovskiy dead-drop site not

once,

but twice.

The CIA officer tasked with the first

asing had been too afraid to go himself, as ordered,

and therefore apparently prevailed upon Abidian to handle

the job for him.

The report submitted by the case off-

CiA however, could lead the reader to believe that the

man had carried out the first casing mission--under

circumstances and in the time period when, according to

Nosenko, Abidian handled the assignment.

Both these problems seems minor in and of themselves.

But they were not minor in the context of the inquisition

to which Nosenko was subjected.

Rather, the discrepancies

involved were evoked, as was every other discrepancy

arising from whatever cause, to bolster the case against

him.

most

be

rendered in

English as "assistant."

Soviet

offices,

at least at the higher

levels,

conmonly have several "Deputies"; some may

have five or six or even more.

In keeping

with this multiplicity, the Soviet term does

not carry with it the same sense of responsi-

bility and authority paralleling the Chief

and of automatic replacement as the American

term.

The

Soviet position of "Deputy" is

probably not as intimately associated with a

specific slot as is the American position

of Deputy, if indeed it is so associated at

all.

In addition, the outline of a "deputy chief's"

duties can be considered

tendentious because it was de-

signed to establish a criterion of knowledgeability that

Nosenko clearly did not meet.

Had the principal case

officer examined the validity of the criterion more

closely, he could easily have determined for himself that

it was unrealistic.

1. Prologue

It is ironic that both Nosenko and Golitsyn

should have becone so involved in

retrospective

analysis of the Popov case, because neither knew a

great deal about it.

Perhaps they would not have

ecome thus involved had it not been for the dis-

information hypothesis.

Sone time after 19 June 1962 the principal case

officer was

given access to tape transcripts of

briefings of Anatoliy Golitsyn, the KGB officer who

had defected in Helsinki in December 1961.

Debrief-

ing of Golitsyn had been going on

for over six

months, compared with five relatively short, hec-

tic conversations with Nosenko.

'In a memorandum written by the principal case

officer dated 21 June 196%, the day after his inter-

view with Golitsyn, he set forth his viet's on

"Possible Control of (Nosenko)." He opened with a

the principal case officer had been

personally concerned in a minor capacity.

Petr Popov was a CIA sourcé within the GRU

from January 1953 to October 1959, when the KGB

rolled up the operation in Moscow.

He was the most

important Soviet source CIA had ever had until the

advent of Penkovskiy in 1961.

Therefore, any informa-

tion Nosenko might have on how the KGB had learned

of Popov's clandestine cooperation with CIA was of

great interest.

In Nosenko's discussion of Popov's compromise,

he explained that, in January 1959, the iGb had had

Golitsyn's 1962 reporting on how Popov

was compromised, i.e.

identified by name

through KGB

surveillance of Langelle in Moscow

in 1959, varied from Nosenko's story only in the

the officer surveilled.

The Golltsyn

report was actually completely omitted from a

17 April 1963 memorandum.

(Why this omission

passed unnoticed is not explained in any records

in this case.

Yet when Golitsyn gave a com-

pletely different story of the compromise in June

materials,

this story became the Golitsyn gospel

and has remained so to this day in Golitsyn's

argumentation.

We shall come to Golitsyn's 1964

version

Shortly,

but first some additional back-

around is needed.

Since Nosenko had said that Popov was com-

promised through KGB surveillance of winters, the

"mirror" technique indicated that this was not

the case.

The mental leap from this postulate

was that if surveillance of Winters was not the

compromise,

then recruitment of Winters

Winters, reported meeting this Soviet in Moscow.

The man called Komarov was known to Golitsyn

and to Nosenko as Vyacheslav Kovshuk, a Second Chief

Directorate case officer who was chief of the sec-

tion working against the American embassy, Moscow.

Winters' documented association with Komarov/

Kovshuk came to light immediately when name traces

were run on the Soviet.

The same reporting docu-

mented his one-time meeting with a friend of Konarov/

Kovshuk's--a TASS correspondent just returned from

Washington named Aleksandr Kislov.

Kislov, Nosenko had told CIA in 1962, was his

friend in the Soviet Disarmament Delegation in

Geneva with whom

Nosenko had gotten drunk on several

occasions.

Asked if Kislov was also a KGB officer,

Nosenko specifically denied that he was.

A review of FBI reporting on Komarov/Kovshuk's

Penkovskiy's arrest heightened the suspicions

In June 1964, while commenting on Nosenko's

version of the Popov compromise,'

Golitsyn stated

that the KGB report he had referred to in 1962

stated

that the KGB

did not consider running Popor

as a double because he could not be trusted.

He

then went on to give a completely new story of the

Popov compromise,

diametrically opposite to his

original information.

Golitsyn stated then that a certain Kotov

(first name not given), who had been in the KGB

in Vienna during the period Popov was there,

pected Popov of being a Western

agent and made

known his suspicions.

by the KGB as a CIA agent in Berlin in 1957

or 1954 .)

Golitsyn's 1964 story must be evaluated

within the framework of the facts that follow.

On 21 November 1963, Chief, SR recorded the

passage to Golitsy CIA by Popov,

through the CI Staff, of all

materials passed to

including

English language transcripts of all operational

meetings held with Popov in Vienna in 1953-1955

and all operational meetings held with him in

Berlin 1957-1958.

by the time Golitsyn

was commenting on Nosenko's version of the Popov

compromise in June 1964, he had become aware of

everything Popov had told CIA, specifically what

was going on in Berlin in 1957

and 1958.

This

included Popov's mention of a KGB officer named

Kotov, who arrived a week or two before Popov

was

recalled to Moscow,

and another KGB officer

named Zhukov, who had worked against the Yugoslav

target at the same

time that Popov worked on this

target for the GRU in Vienna.

In view of the fact

that Golitsyn's story in June 1964 varied drastically

from that he had told in March 1962, it is legitimate

to suspect that he had recreated a story of Popov's

compromise based

on deductions he had made after

reading the Popov transcripts.

Thus, the 1964

decision must be thrown out of court.

The Hypothesis that CIA was Penetrated

Unfortunately for the course of events in the

Nosenko case, it was Golitsyn's 1962 version that

was ignored in favor of his

"facts" of 1964, which

condemned Nosenko's story as strongly as his 1962

version had supported Nosenko.

The reason for this

is obvious.

The Popov compromise hypothesis had

been feeding on itself for so long that it had come

to be treated as fac, with the result that the sub-

ject of Popov's compromise became a kind of litmus

paper test of every

Soviet source.

If a Soviet

source reporting to CIA on Popov

agreed with Nosenko

that KGB

rather than a KGB agent--

a penetration of ClA--had compromised Popov, then

that Soviet source was held to be a part of an ever-

growing massive KGB conspiracy to protect penetration (s)

of CIA.

produce evidence that Popov and Penkovskiy had been

interpreted as proof that indeed such a penetra-

There can be liifle doubt that the handling Nosenko

Furthermore,

the timing of Nosenko's defection,

some months after that of

Golitsyn,

the fact that losenko provided information on some

of the same or similar persons or leads as had Golitsyn, and

Golitsyn's conclusion

that Nosenko had been dispatched by the

IGB specifically to discredit him (Golitsyn) as part of :

lezinformatsiva operation--all these factors combined te

preclude "normal" professional treatment of Nosenko.

As a

defector, Nosenko's bona fides should have been established,

or not established,

on ine basis of careful and sound

analysis

and investigation of the information he provided

under standard interrogation procedures.

in actuality, he

came under suspicion as a KGB-controlled agent long before

he presented himself as a defector, and his handling was

therefore based upon

this prejudgment.

long

dezinformatsiya is a Soviet concept and practice of

standing

that has been defined or

described dy numerous

sources through the years. Two representative definitions

are as follows:

Petr Deryabin: Dezinformatsiya is the

deliberate and purposeful dissemination of false

information regarding accomplished facts and/or

intentions, plans of action, etc., for the pur-

pose of misleading the enemy.

Such disseminations

nay be accomplished by means of the press, radio

operations,

fornation itself.

Anatoliy Golitsyn: In Soviet parlance, the

term dezintormatsiya is used to denote false, in-

complete,

misleading information passed, fed or

confirmed

to opposition services for the purpose

of causing these

(and their governnents)

to reach

erroneous conclusions regarding the USSR

or inducing them to undertake action beneficial to

the USSR.

By means of dezinformatsiya, again according to

Golitsyn,

the Soviet government hopes

ensure that the

policy decisions of a gien country will be based on a false

impression of the USSR's domestic or military posture.

Specific measures taken to achieve this end might be designed

to induce a foreign country to engage in costly and useless

the KGB (or its predecessor organizations),

although establishment of such a unit had been discussed from

time

to

time.

Each

geographic component handling foreign

intelligence

operations was responsible for dezinformatsiya

work within its own sphere of activity.

All such work was

carried out with the approval of higher authorities within:

the KGb'Affairs and Defense,

frequently in consultation with the Ministries of

Foreign

and even in many instances with

the specific approval of the Central Committee of the CPSU.

It was not until 1959 that responsibility for dezinformatsiya

insofar as it was to be the concern of the First (foreign

intelligence) Chief Directorate of the KGB was centralized

within that unit,

and not until 1961

that the concept of

dezinformatsiya played any significant role in the thinking

of CIA counterintelligence officers.

The dezinformatsiya concept was first highlighted for

CIA by the senior Polish UB officer, Michal Goleniewski, who

initially provided information by anonymous correspondence

starting in 1958 and later while under

interrogation follow-

ing his defection in January 1961.

The information he provided

was of major significance, as he had dealt with the KGB on the

subject of dezinfornatsiya

as early as 1953.and was in

fact not only a ranking Polish intelligence officer but also

a KGB agent.

While Goleniewski was not the first source to

refer to dezinformatsiya, he was the first to bring it to

clA consciousness as a technique to be reckoned with in our

analysis of the USSR's foreign policy.

It was his clain

that the Soviet intelligence

counterintelligence ser-

vices played a major role in the implementation of such

policies.

Goleniewski stated that one of the many objectives of KGB

dezinformatsiya was the protection

of action designed to mislead lestern security services.

listed among specific objectives and types of dezinformatsiya

operations those designed to confirm unimportant true

informa-

tion, thus establishing in the eyes of the

of a channel through which the

KGB passes mislead-

ing information to anti-Soviet governments.

Conversely,

another type of dezinformatsiya operation

might be designed to discredit accurate information of

signi-

ficance received by the opposition through sources not under

Soviet control, e.g., defectors, thus casting doubt on

the

veracity of the

source or sources of this true intormation.

Goleniewski stated further that the information passed

through dezinformatsiya channels could be based on analysis

of what was already known about any sensitive items, i.e.,

could stem from defector damage assessments.

One means

obviously might be the channeling of information at variance

with that provided by the defector.

Another means might

be

the provision of "give away"

material,

which neither added

o information already in the hands of the opposition nor,

by the same token,

did any particular damage to the KGB.

In extreme cases,

the KGB would be willing to sacrifice some

of their own agent assets in the interest of enhancing the

reputation of an agent penetration of one of the anti-Communist

intelligence services.

(That this latter technique was used

to advantage by the KGB in building Heinz Felfe as

a pene-

tration agent within the German Intelligence Service has been

assumed in most analyses of that case.

Felfe was a KGB agent

for all of the ten years he worked for the German Intelli-

gence Service,

from 1951 until his arrest in 1961.

During

this period Felfe was able to work his way up to the position

of chief of the Soviet Section of the German

counterintelli-

gence staff.

It has been postulated that Felfe's rise in the

German intelligence ranks was assisted by the KGB, which was

willing to sacrifice less important agent assets to enhance

Felfe's

reputation and position as their long-term penetration

agent.

In all its essentials, the information provided by

Goleniewski was

confirmed

and elaborated upon by colitsyn,

who defected in December 1961 and who was the first significant

Soviet or Soviet Bloc defector to come into CIA hands after

Goleniewski.

In addition to the

general definition of

Jezinformatsiya quoted above, Golitsyn said that a KGB (or

GRU) defector's file would be sent to the KGB dezinformatsiya

unit; the latter would search i.

opportunities to exploit

the situation, after review of the probable areas of informa-

tion revealed to the opposition by the defector.

He indicated

in this connection that the

Disinformation Department of the

KGB maintained extensive files organized on a topical basis,

containing all information on a given topic that was known

(from the debriefing of defectors to the Soviets, double

agents, captured agents, etc.) to be in the hands of opposi-

tion intelligence services.

For example, a KGB officer

assigned to Beirut to work

against the American embassy who

defected to CIA would

be assumed by the KGb Department of

Disinformation to have told CIA e erything he

knew about

KGB operations against the embassy and embassy personnel.

By reference to their files on Beirut operations,

the Depart-

ment of Disinformation would be able to determine the extent

to which KGB operations in that area had been compromised to

CIA.

On the basis of the foregoing information, it might be

assumed that the Golitsyn and Nosenko defections would have

received similar handling by the KGB Department of Disinforma-

tion and by CIA upon their arrival as defectors to the West.

However, the two men were not similarly received by CIA when

they presented themselves as defectors; they received com-

pletely different handling,

based

on quite different assess-

ment of the information they provided and their motives for

defecting.

Golitsyn was accepted as a bona fide defector in

relatively short order, while Nosenko was speedily rejected

as a bona fide defector, as explained below.

Golitsyn, an officer of the First Chief Directorate of

the KGB,

defected to CIA

in Helsinki in mid-December 1961.

Information that he provided relating to the organization

and structure of the KGB was accepted

as factual and true,

at least in part because there was relatively little record

information against which it could be compared, but also

because the information appeared to be logical

and reasonable.

In addition, he provided voluminous and valuable information

on KGB personalities; available CIA

file holdings were

limited, but the information provided by Golitsyn proved to

NW 65990 Docld:32375547 Page 122

SECRET

-117-

be accurate to the extent it could be checked against these

holdings.

Finally, he provided a cheory of KGB operations

that was not only accepted at face value but received with

outright

enthusiasm.

Given the value of his information,

plus his apparent motivation for defecting, which included

an obsession with the evil inherent in the KGB and

an

emphatically-stated wish to "fight against the KGB," his bona

fides was accepted in March 1962.

The reception accorded Nosenko, after he defected in

1964, has already been recorded in

letail.

That Nosenko did

not receive standard treatment as a defector whose bona fides

would be determined on the basis of the information he pro-

vided under interrogation after defection inevitably involves

reference to Golitsyn.

As explained in Chapter III,

Golitsyn

himself played a curious role in that, as

a result of the

trust placed in his judgment, he was actually encouraged to

label Nosenko as a deception agent.

This situation arose as follows:

During initial contacts

with CIA in 1962, Nosenko provided information on personalities

that was similar

to that provided a few months earlier by

Golitsyn.

Because ClA counterintelligence officers had been

warned by Goleniewski that they should not be "taken in" by

false information fed to them through no matter what channels,

the "duplication" or "overlapping" information given by Nosenko

was viewed with extreme suspicion.

This original doubt led

to information provided by Nosenko being shown to Golitsyn

soon after the former's

defection.

The paranoid Golitsyn

immediately saw Nosenko as a person sent out to discredit or

even assassinate him.

Thereafter, the desire of CIA counterintelligence offi-

cers not to be outwitted by the KGB led them to apply an ana-

lytical technique that has been referred to variously as "double

think" or "mirror reading."

This "analysis" led to the con-

clusion that Nosenko, as a dispatched agent, was feeding us

what the KGB wanted

us to believe.

he susa ehat the kG had

everything Nosenko

been unable

to recruit any Americans serving at the US embassy

in Moscow during a given period, this meant that the KGB had

been quite successful in doing so.

If he provided information

on a given topic that we had already received from another

source, this meant that the KGB wanted us to believe that

particular piece of information hence the other source un-

doubtedly was

a KGB agent

And so on.

that Nosenko was a dispatched agent.

Any other sources

whose information confirmed

tended to confirm, or dealt

with any of the

topics mentioned by Nosenko were regarded

- that is to say, they were considered

part of the same dezinformatsiya plot in which Nosenko

figured.

Golitsyn played a major role in this "analytical pro-

cess."

As soon as Nosenko's defection became public

Golitsyn asked whether he could participate

in Nosenko's

interrogation. should be brought into the operation and

As of 20 February 1964 the Dip had agreed

that Golitsyn

given full access to the "Nosenko material."

The reasoning

at this time, given Golitsyn's identification of Nosenko's

function

as

a

false defector, was that the Nosenko operation

was

"the reverse of the Golitsyn coin" and thus that Golitsyn's

assistance was required to pursue it properly.

Accordingly, •

over the next several months Golitsyn was provided with

material from the 1962 and 1964 meetings with Nosenko and at

his request was supplied with all available biographic data

on Nosenko to assist him in "analyzing" the operation.

on 29 June 1964 Golitsyn was interviewed by Chief The

Staff, Deputy Chief, CI Staff and Chief,

SR Division.

following is quoted

from the transcripts of this meeting:

1962.

Many of them had made mistakes--they had

told too nuch. They were,

therefore, in

the damage report (on my defection) and

for then

the only way to act was to

suggest

an operation against me in order to save

their face, to save the situation.

It can be argued that Golitsyn had two interests:

(a)

to discredit Nosenko in order to maintain a position of pre-

eminence as advisor to CIA (and other lestern intelligence

services) on Soviet intelligence matters, and (b) to pronote

his contentions as to how the West was being deceived by the

Soviet Union

and thus

to enhance his position

as advisor to governments on overall

Soviet political matters.

Golitsyn clearly had a high opinion of himself. When

he defected, he brought with him some 23 classified

docu-

ments from

the Soviet embassy in Helsinki, which he made

clear he wished to discuss with President

Kennedy and the

Director of Central Intelligence personally, to alert them

to what was going on and to measures needing to be taken.

Moreover, his willingness to cooperate with CIA and other

US government agencies underwent changes fron time to time,

depending upon whether his demands for access to and inter-

views with specified ranking officials of those organizations

were granted.

Golitsyn's chosen role as interpreter of Soviet policy

and anti-Western actions was threatened by the arrival of

His response was to gain access to virtually all

of ClA's files on Nosenko for purposes of providing ClA with

an "interpretation'"of the latter's role.

In any event, the

idea took hold within CIA as a result of

Golitsyn's hanner-

ing away at this theme that we

were being "had" by the

SovieT KGB counterintelligence operations, and that Nosenko

particularly by being penetrated

had to be "broken" at all costs; his "confession" would make

clear to us the details and dimensions of the Soviet

machinations.

Further,

with

it was deemed expedient not only to proceed

to "break" Nosenko but also to study past

to have been discounted. On the contrary, since the cases

included in the study were considered to have been hugely

successful in duping or deluding the hestern intelligence

services and governments, it was concluded that we were con-

tinuing to be deluded and duped.

It was reasoned that, as

CIA and other lestern intelligence services becane increas-

ingly aware of and inforned on the Soviet operational tech-

niques being used against them and changed their operational

tactics accordingly, the KGB simply adjusted to the new

situation and continued to outwit us.

With Shelepin and

succeeding chiefs of the KGB as members of the Central Com-

mittee,

it was assumed that those KGB operations that could

be (or

were) classed as dezinformatsija were not only

important per se but took on added importance inasmuch as

Conclusions

in retrospect, it seems worthwhile to point out that

(a) in the years since Nosenko's first contact and subsequent

defection, no information has ever been developed to sub-

stantiate

the charges made against him either by Golitsyn

or by the "mirror-readers"; (b) Golitsyn's information with

respect to dezinformatsiya has not been internally consistent;

and (c) Golitsyn himself as the architect and sponsor of

theories presented has not been able to support his claims,

despite the wealth of information made available to him for

analysis.

The following

is quoted

from

an unsigned paper,

dated 10 September 1968, in summation of Golitsyn's claims:

Golitsyn's overall thesis, that the Soviet

leadership in 1959 developed a "New Policy"

(peaceful coexistence, non-violent tactics,

united

front,

etc.) is

perfectly

as a statement of

the "Right"

acceptable

strategy

developed during the mid- and late-fifties

and enshrined in the November 1960 Moscow

• Manifesto.

Golitsyn's depiction of this

policy as, in toto, a "misinformation"

operation

rests upon his extremely broad

use of that term:

"special deliberate

efforis

of the communist governments to

mislead Western

studies and to direct them

in wrong directions" by means of official

Soviet speeches and Party documents, offi-

cial press and propaganda outlets,

travel

controls, diplonatic

His vocabulary and general handling of this

new Bloc

policy gives the strategy a con-

spiratorial quality not justified by its

essentially open and public character.

The role of the KGB in the execution and

coordination of this policy is constantly

alluded to, but no evidence is provided to

define the

precise nature of its role and

no actual "covert" disinformation operations

are cited for the years from 1959 to the

present.

Golitsyn provided factual evidence

for "politicalization" of the KGB in 1959,

but its new role may also be interpreted to

cover routine operations of covert propa-

ganda, political action, recruitment of

CHAPTER VII

Golitsyn Vs. Nosenko: ' A Comparison

of Their Handling By CIA

The purpose of this chapter is to describe the differ-

ences in

handling by ClA of the two

•KGB defectors, Anatoliy

Golitsyn and Yuriy Nosenko.

Comparison is material to this

study, since it was Golitsyn's "confirmation" of certain

theories regarding Nosenko

as a dispatched agent that helped

to establish

the standards by which CIA judged Nosenko when

he walked in some months after Golitsyn.

It is also material,

since Golitsyn played a role in CIA efforts

to "break" Nosenko.

Brief discussion of the treatment given the two men follows.

Interrogation

The defections of folitsyn and Nosenko cannot be con-

since some five meetings were

defection.

There had been no similar contact with Golitsyn

before his defection. However, the following statements can

be made.

Golitsyn was brought to this country within days of his

defection

in Helsinki

Standard interroga-

tion procedures were initiated

in December 196 included his systematic

which

lebriefing regarding his own biographic data, family back-

ground and career, and his knowledge of the structure, organiza-

tion,

personalities and operations of the KGB.

What he said

was checked against CIA files and formed the basis for his

acceptance within weeks of arrival in the United States as a

bona fide defector.

In Nosenko's case, he cannot be said to have been inter-

rogated at all, in

the strict sense of the word, during

nitial contacts with him in Geneva in June 1962. For one

thing, he evinced no desire to defect at that time but simply

offered certain pieces of information that he thought would

be of interest to CIA,

in exchange for a specified

money that he claimed

to need.

Also, time with hin was

limited.

When Nosenko actually defected in February 1964, he

was interrogated in a manner that contrasted sharply with that

applied in Golitsyn's case. In the interim between initial

contacts in 1962 and his defection in 1964, as previously

explained luminous papers had been written during this

it had been concluded that he was a dispatched

period "proving" that such was the case, and because of

the accumulated "evidence" it was decided to attempt to

"break" him as soon as possible.

Accordingly, and because

it was also belicved imperative

to act quickly, Nosenko's

interrogation took place in

various pre-planned stages of

phases, ranging from ostensibly friendly to hostile.

In Nosenko's case,

then, the entire effort was to force

him to admit to CIA's accusations rather than to obtain in-

formation from him in any logical or systematic fashion.

Efforts were made to "trap" him or "throw him off balance,"

by indicating that CIA had "proof" that he was lying, that

his only option was to "confess" that he had been sent by

the KGB, etc.

His denials of charges or

refusals to "con-

fess" only resulted in increasingly hostile treatment. While

his statements did contain inconsistencies, and there were

questions for which he gave no adequate or

consistent and

logical answers,

the manner in which he was questioned was

in no way that afforded the usual defector.

Moreover, the

pressures put upon Nosenko contributed to

the creation

of

a cilmate not conducive to proper

interrogation.

It was not

until October 1967, in fact, that he received a proper in-

terrogation.

Polygraph Examination

account of Nosenko's polygraph examinations is in marked con-

trast with that of Golitsyn.

home to him that the test was an absolute requirement for

The unusual manner in which the tests were conducted

is illustrated in the following quotations from

the report

later submitted by the polygraph operator:

The undersigned had a series of prepolygraph

conferences with (Chief], SR/CI [a] CI Staff

fficer, and lan officer of the Office of

Security.

The general consensus of the

interested parties regarding what areas

polygraph testing all reflected the fact

that Subject (Golitsyn] should be disturbed

as little as possible by the questions asked

during the polygraph test so that he would

not feel personally offended and as a result

become "sour," unmanageable or uncooperative.

tion, if (Golitsyn) was intentionally mis-

viewer, whether he had any secret prearranged

neans of contact with Soviet officials, if

he had a concrete plan to return to the USSR,

Although the operator was fluent in Russian, the test

as given to Golitsyn on 21 March 1962 in English: Russia

as used only when Golitsyn failed to comprehens

the full

and accurate meaning of a question.

Golitsyn raised no

objections to any questions asked, but the operator did nor

consider the day's testing conclusive,

Ficulties that had arisen oning to Golitsyn's poor compre-

hension of English plus a malfunctioning polygraph.

A second test was therefore given the following day,

28 March, in the Russian language, during the course of

which Golitsyn was asked the same

questions as on the previ-

ous day.

Before

the test could be initiated, however,

Golitsyn again had to be convinced of the necessity for

taking it.

He stated that he had thought over the ques-

tions he had been asked the previous day, and he considered

them "insulting." He resented having been asked whether he

had been sent by the KGB, whether he had a mission connected

with his defection having to do with misinformation,

his

notivation for defecting,

etc.

in the operator's words, he

resented "all in all, any and every

question which may have

reflected that he was not accepted 100 percent on the basis

of only his own explanations and assurances."

Nevetheless,

the test was finally conducted.

Upon its completion

the

operator informed Golitsyn that he (the operator) had con-

cluded that Golitsyn was

substantially truthful in his

answers and that,

as far as the operator was concerned, the

results were favorable.

Six months later,

the Office of Security reviewed the

polygraph charts, as well as the questions that had beer

posed, the transcriptions of the interviews, and the final

report.

On 19 Septeaber 1962, a memorandun

was prepared for

the chief of the Interrogation and Research Division

Office of Security.

The report contained the following

initial statements:

A review of (the operator's report on the

testing of Golitsyn] reflects everything

except a clear-cut statement of whether

or not Golitsyn lied or did not lie to

any or all of the questions.

The report

states that the first day's testing was

inconclusive.

The results of the second

day's testing is not set forth.

The re-

port is rather remarkable for this reason.

ing information.

The ultimate conclusion was that the charts,

with the limitations noted above,

did not show reactions in-

dicating that Golitsyn was a dispatched Soviet agent.

How-

ever, the

report also contained the following conclusion:

This should not be considered any definitive

(polygraph examination).

The conditions and

limitations placed on the (polygraph] offi-

cer as reflected in the body of the report

imposed a set of conditions that preclude

and make impossible any

unequivocal state-

ment that a conclusive (polygraph examination]

was conducted.

The use of the polygraph in Nosenko's case contrasts

sharply with the way it was used on Golitsyn.

go into detail here, because Nosenko's polygraph examinations

CHAPTER VIII

Use of the Polygraph in the Nosenko Case

series of six tests.

somewhat unorthodox is indicated by the following quotations

from the report of the polygraph operator:

During the pre-polygraph conferences with

representatives of SR Division, the under-

Signed was informed that the polygraph

interview was part of an

overald plan to

help

break (Nosenko] and elicit the truth

from him.

SR Division's instructions were

that, regardless of whether (Nosenko]

passed his polygraph test or not, he was

to be informed at the termination of his

interview that he was lying, and

had not passed his polygraph interview.

The question of [Nosenko's] willingness to

participate in the polygraph test was one of

ninor consideration, since he had, on previ-

us occasions, agreed that he would take the

test.

However, whether [Nosenko] would con-

tinue with the polygraph

testing, if he was

confronted

with attempted deception after

ал

initial

test run, was one of the considered

problems.

Consequently, in order to preclude

the possibility of (Nosenko's] terminating the

test prior to its completion,.

it was decided

that a minor deviation from

the accepted

polygraph technique would be used during the

posygraph resting,

specifically to ensure that

3 polygraph record of (Nosenko's] reactions

to all the pertinent questions be obtained

prior to challenging

any significant

polygraph deception

indications his charts

might reflect.

Because of the extenuating

(sic] circumstances of the case, this plan

was followed throughout the polygraph inter-

evident both to [the operator) and the

examining physician who checked [Nosenko]

prior to (Nosenko's] po-ygraph testing

Although (Nosenko) had used both alcohoi and

some unknown drug prior to testing, there is

no question, based both on

analysis of

[Nosenko's] polygraph charts as well as

personal observation during the interview,

that [Nosenko] has attempted deliberate

deception in the specific pertinent areas

(on which he was questioned).

iccording to the pre-agreed upon plan, the

different phases involving various pertinent

areas were covered with [Nosenko] polygraph-

ically.

Challenge of (Nosenko's] reactions

was indirect and

"soft."

told that he was lying

to numerous pertinent

questions and was accused of being a dis-

patched agent.

After completion of the interview

presentative at the safesite was informed,

in front of (Nosenko,, of (the operator's)

opinion that (Nosenko] was lying and was a

dispatched Soviet agent.

(Nosenko) was taken

into protective custody and escorted to his

new place of residence.

A second series of polygraph tests were administered to

Nosenko between 18 and 25 October 1966.

Although by this

time the operator had transferred from

the Office of Security

to SR Division, it was desired by SR that he conduct the new

polygraph tests.

He was allowed by the Office of Security

exception to the rule that all polygraph

Chief, SR's statement that,

for Nosenko's polygraphing, use

of a person ofhis "temperament" was essential.

The following is quoted from an interim report dated

24 October 1966 (i.e., before completion of the new polygraph

series), which was

attached to a memorandum from Chief, SR

to the DCI.

example of what I consider to be physical

abuse and regret that it was not brought to

my attention.

Nosenko's final

polygraph examination, conducted under

the direction of the Office of Security, was quite at

variance with the first two.

Initiated on 2 August 1968,

it concluded on 6 August 1968.

The tests took place after

approximately 7,000 pages of transcripts and relaied materials

had been compiled during the course of Nosenko's new interro-

tion undertaken in late October 1967. About 60 questions of

a pertinent nature were covered in the interview.

Nosenko

was completely cooperative, no problems were encountered,

and the conclusion of the polygraph operator was that Nosenko

had been substantially truthful in answering all relevant

questions put to him.

In the course of the present investigation, the Office

of Security was requested

to make a further reevaluation of

the Nosenko polygraph charts of April 1964, October 1966,

and August 1968.

CHAPTER IX

Psychological and Medical Findings

A small, but nevertheless key role was played by two

Agency specialists, respectively

in the handling of Nosenko.

Like so much

else that occurred in this case, this aspect is edifying

nainly in the negative sense of demonstrating how the ser-

vices of such professionals ought not to be exploited.

In

sum, the psychologist and psychiatrist principally involved

in this case were given

enough misinformation about Nosenko's

bona fides to prejudice seriously any chance of an accurate

personality assessment.

We now examine in some detail the roles played by the

psychologist-and the psychiatrist.

In doing so, we have

very nuch

in mind the fact that both these gentlemen are

members of organized

professions, both

of which imposi

explicit standards of conduct upon their members.

We must

therefore look for possible conflict between demands the

Agency made of these professionals on one hand, and their

professional standards on the other.

A. The Role of the Psychologist

The psychologist's role will be dealt with first

because,

to judge by the written record, he was the

first to assess Nosenko from the psychological point

of view, by means of a brief interview and

test administered

on 23 June 1964.

His initial report is dated 9 July 1964.

In addition, he interviewed Nosenko at length in 14 ses-

sions during the period 3-21 May 1965.

He then wrote a

chronicle of Nosenko's life and

an

overall psychological

evaluation based on these interviews.

By way of background, it should be said that the

psychologist is an extremely insightful person with

clinical experience acquired both before joining CIA

as well as during his CIA service.

He has developed

his own system of interpreting the Wechsler intelligence

tests (Wechsler-Bellevue and Wechsler Adult Intelligence

Scale), which ne calls the Personality Assessment Systen

(PAS) .

It is PAS that, for over two decades, has been

the main resource used

by the Clandestine Service in the

assessment of personality for operational purposes.

Subsequent events have revealed that Nosenko's

falsehoods were in fast minor ones.

But the psychologist

did not know. all this; told that Nosenko lied constantly

and knowing that manipulative lying

is part of the

psychopathic syndrome, he diagnosed Nosenko as a psycho-

path.

The term "psychopath" (another term used inter-

changeably is "sociopath") itself deserved a word of

explanation, because its connotation is misleading.

Like so many psychological terms, it evolved out of the

fact that psychologists tend to be involved primarily

with people in trouble, very often with those who end up

in prisons and mental institutions.

A survey of psycho-

one quintessential criterion of a psychopath

is habitually given to criminal or delinquent behavior.

The critéria that psychologists

use in distinguishing

between psychopaths

and non-psychopaths have been

developed almost entirely from studies of juvenile

delinquents, criminals and mental patients, and thus the

term is really only applicable with any certainty to in-

dividuals belonging to one or another of those groups.

Despite this tact, testing of many people who are not

delinquent or criminal may yield a score or profile

of scores suggesting psychopathy. To illustrate the

point, let us take an example.

On the Minnesota

Multiphasic Personality Inventory (one of the most widely

used clinical testing instruments in this country), the

profile that suggests psychopathy has also been generated

or the PAS

test is merely a warning signal of what you

might do under certain adverse circumstances.

When he tested Nosenko, the psychologist was not

fully aware of all the pressures under which this defector

was functioning.

He was unaware of the manner of his

sudden confinement after glowing promises had been made

of rewards for defection; of the falsified polygraph

results, and the fact that Nosenko had been informed

that the examination showed him guilty of deception;

or of the fact that the principal case officer had

told Nosenko that the latter's information (later to

prove of great value) was all "crap."

Given these

factors, we would have to conclude a priori that the

• resultant PAS personality profile was likely to be

partly spurious.

results were inexact cannot be determined, but one

example is illustrative of the possibilities.

he denied being under continued KGB control. The psychologist

Another vulnerability

is that he will "break" in order to get relief.

Nosenko's story was

consistent with

the previous diagnosis of a "bright sociopath"

(i.e., psychopath).

The psychologist was "totally at a

The US has no room for

system.

The above findings were still insufficient for some

of the SR Division personnel, who then drafted a series

of very specific questions to be put to the psychologist.

Of these the first three will be quoted, together with

the psychologist's answers:

1.

This man's story is full of denon-

strable lies.

Often these lies

seem point-

less--no matter from what point of view

they are studied.

when challenged, he will

sometimes retreat from one of his

stories;

in other instances, he will cling adamantly

to one even when it is clear to all that he

is lying and even when he has an easy way

out.

In other words, his lies, distortions

and rationalizations

are harder to under-

stand than those of most "normal" people.

In your opinion, when he lies, does he do so:

a. because he is a compulsive

liar;

(Answer: No.)

b. because he seeks to bolster

his stature and ego for his own reasons;

Answer:

Essentially yes.)

c.

because the KGB told him to.

(Answer: Perhaps.)

2.

Do the incidence and nature of his in-

accuracies and distortions add up to a behavior

pattern that might reasonably be called "normal"?

If not, how can it be described in layman's

terms?

(Answer: Not a "normal" personality but legally

normal and not hospitalizeable.)

3.

If his behavior pattern is not

"normal," could it be counterfeit, either

for personal reasons or because he was

briefed to comport himself this way?

Could he play such a role over a considerable

period of time?

(Answer: Absolutely not.)

findings of the psychologist were included in the

Nosenko's

rationalizations are not the pro-

duct of derangement.

The most notable quality of this summary is its

selectivity.

For example:

1. The sumnary nowhere mentioned the

diagnosis of Nosenko as a psychopath/sociopath.

The fact that psychopaths generally try to

evade the penalties of their misbehavior by

adaptive

role-playing (e.g, sudden religious

B. The Role of the Psychiatrist

The psychiatrist's role in the Nosenko operation

was more extensive and of longer duration than the

psychologist's.

In addition to physical examinations,

it included giving advice on how Nosenko should be treated

while in confinement, advice on special interrogation

techniques such as

the use of sodium pentothal, and an

assessment of Nosenko's personality.

The psychiatrist has stated (in discussions

with the senior author of this report) that he had

been told when he was first assigned to the case that

Nosenko was concealing information of great importance

to the US government.

That he worked throughout th

case under this assumption is evident from the total

context of his reporting.

On the other hand, there

is no evidence that either SR Division or CI

Staff

shared the reasons for their suspicions with him to a

sufficient extent for him to

have evaluated their

claim, even had he been qualified by professional

background to make such an evaluation.

He knew and

accepted his limitations in the latter regard; for

example, ih a report dated 23 February 1965,

after

he had

spent an hour observing an interrogation, he

remarked:

It should be made clear that throughout the

the psychlatrist was entitled to

feel that hu as act pay property was line of duty.

His component, the Office of Medical

Services/

Operational Services Division, was specifically

charged with providing assistance to the operational

components of the Agency.

It had long been Agency

practice, both at Headquarters and in

the field,

for medical doctors to function in a partly opera-

tional capacity, even though they were not neces-

sarily cognizant of all aspects of the operations

in which they became involved.

The assumption was

that senior operations officers knew what they were

about and

that, within rather vaguely defined

limits,

a doctor of medicine could

accept their

authority as guaranty of the rightness of what he

did to assist them.

Thus, it was only natural that the psychiatrist,

having been told by senior Agency officials that

Nosenko was consistently lying about his true mis-

sion, should accept their views.

Unlike the psycholo-

gist, he did not even have the

advantage of having

systematically debriefed Nosenko on his life history;

had he done so, he might have shared the psycholo-

gist's suspicions that the SR Division opinion of

Nosenko was not beyond legitimate challenge.

Nevertheless,

the anomalous situation in which

the psychiatrist was placed had two unfortunate

consequences:

Because he was led to assume that

Nosenko was systematically lying, his

diagnosis was somewhat distorted.

2. The same assumption led him to

play a quasioperational role in the handling

of Nosenko.

Let us look in greater depth at the first consequence.

In so doing, it is not our purpose to second-guess a

qualified psychiatrist; rather, it is our purpose to

ascertain whether this particular professional, well

to his colleagues for his devotion to duty, was

in fact given a fair opportunity to make an honest

evaluation.

The psychiatrist's diagnosis of Nosenko, which

he labeled

"Psychiatric Impressions," was dated 20

December 1964.

It read in part:

Psychiatric impression is that of an individual

that he has operated in this manner--without

Given the apparent consensus among the Agency's

leadership that there were good and sufficient reasons

for incarcerating

and trying to

"break" Nosenko, it is

not surprising in

hindsight that the psychiatrist offered

judgments and advice extending well beyond the bounds of

conventional medicine and psychiatry.

Since his quasi-

operational participation in this case has been covered

to some degree in Chapter III, we need only reevoke a

few examples here:

-His judgment of 24 February 1966 that "things

sound to change as far as Nosenko is con-

cerned--he is either going to stop faking or

things will get worse."

--His judgment, reported on 26 April 1966,

that reestablishing contact between Nosenko

and the interrogators would be a serious mis-

take because it would constitute a "relief."

-His opinion, offered after monitoring the

door."

Admittedly, the above comments come to us secondhand,

via memoranda

written by others.

Nonetheless,

they are

consistent with everything

in the psychiatrist's hand-

written reports of his visits to Nosenko in confinement.

It will suffice here to illustrate

our point with one

example, quoted from the psychiatrist's 14 July 1964 re-

CHAPTER XI

Methodology and Leadership

A. Lack of Counterintelligence MethodologY

We accept without question the necessity for counter-

as a category of the intelligence

concerned with the activities of hostile powers' Provers

and clandestine activities against the United States and

our allies.

But such a discipline, if it is to fulfill

its purposes, must employ an orderly and systematic

methodology.

Unhappily, in the Nosenko case it did no

such thing.

We are forced

to conclude that,

Interrogation was published by CIA in July 1963, but the

handling

of Nosenko gives no indication that any of the

Agency personnel directly involved had profited from it,

if indeed they had read it at all.

Insofar as we can

ascertain, in respect to Soviet nationals the Directorate

lacked:

1. Explicit written criteria to be applied

in evaluating the bona fides of a defector or

prospective agent.

2.

Explicit written procedures for the

collection,

analysis, and

evaluation of the

counterintelligence product of

a defector or

His reputation for expertise rested on his purportedly

unique knowledge of the KGB's worldwide covert political

In truth, no

one could compete with him as an expert

on this subject.

His analyses, based on fragmentary and

often inapplicable data, were more imaginative than

systenatic and therefore neither easily comprehended nor

replicated by his interlocutors.

But unlike the Emperor

and his imaginary clothes, Chief, CI's fantasies were never

vulnerable to objective examination,

simply because he

surrounded such data

as existed with a wall of secrecy.

His "facts" were available in full only to a minimum number

of trusted apostles; to

the rest of the intelligence con-

nunity, both American and foreign, he doled them out

selectively--seldom in written form--to prove whatever

point he was trying to make at the time.

Chief, CI's preference for oral over written communica-

tion is worth enphasizing.

During his incumbency as its

chief, the cl Staff, though it supposedly had in its

possession information concerning a horrendous hazard to

both the United States

and its allies, never committed to

paper any complete, written, documented report on the sub-

ject.

Therefore, the threat could never be systematically

analyzed and evaluated.

Only when Chief, CI finally departed

did dispassionate analysis of CI Staff's data holdings

finally becone possible,

and these have consistently failed

to support his central claims regarding the KGB's massive

influence in world affairs.

C.

Impact of Faulty Counterintelligence on Positive Intelli-

gence Collection

There is an important interrelationship between coun

At the time CIA was established, the primary mission

of what was later to become the Plans Directorate's

Clandestine Service was conceived to be the collection

of strategically-significant intelligence from clandestine

human sources.

How successful was the Clandestine Service

in fulfilling this mission?

Agency claims of success in the human-source col-

lection field have often

been so phrased, whether inten-

tionally of not, as to give the impression that our

achievements stemmed largely from the process called

"development and recruitment."

and American intelligence services:

contemplation.

"Chiet, CI was almost unique in his

interest in long-range analysis.

Within the Clandestine

Service, his generation was in general suspicious of

theory and ill-prepared in most cases to cope with it.

On the other hand, the best of the Service's leaders

--and there were many

good ones--were successful because

they possessed a difficult-to-define quality called com-

mon sense.

Its value should not be underestimated.

For

example

when Penkovskiy was producing strategic intelli-

gence that remains of value to this day, it was the com-

mon sense of these other

leaders that led them

to resist

Chief, CI's

tion

allegation that Penkovskiy was a "disinforma-

agent."

Nevertheless,

senior Clandestine Service supervisors

of the period 1948-1970 had seldom thenselves been trained

in rigorous analytic techniques, and thus they s+1dom

were in a position to demand high standards of analysis

of their subordinates.

Until the massive outflow of

retirees in recent years changed the demography of the

Service, most senior operational supervisors had received

their higher educations before systematized analysis be-

came routine even

in such "soft"

subjects as political

science (for which

knowledge of

inferential statistics

is now required at most universities).

Many, probably

nost, Of these same gentlemen were also educated during a

sort

of interregnum

in academe, when the study of classica

logic had passed from vogue but had not yet been replaced

by emphasis on scientific method.

In the realm of

technology, almost all senior executives in the Clandestine

Service before 1970 had finished college before the first

digital computer,

an invaluable

analytical tool, became

commercially available about 1951.

There also have been, of course, a number of bright

spots.

Some of the Plans

Directorate's divisions and

staffs had subordinate components that specialized in sub-

stantive intelligence and built up great expertise on

specific subjects over the years.

From time to time

there were also bursts of enthusiasm for the use of

psychological evaluation techniques in the assessment

of prospective agents.

But these cases were exceptions;

primary reliance within the Clandestine Service was on

judgments that, though sometimes bolstered by impressive

figures and

arcane terminology, were nevertheless essentially

intuitive and non-systematic.

Such systems and criteria as did exist were

largely in the heads of various individuals, ana there

is no evidence of any appreciable long-term

consensus

among the latter.

Every defector

case tended to be

subject to the vagaries of the momentary line-up of

CIA leadership.

The existence of an

Interagency

Defector Committee, subordinate to the DDP, introduced

some uniformity of

approach,

but its concerns were

limited for the most part to superficial administrative

and procedural formalities.

Summary

If we seem to have wandered far afield from the

nature and validity of methodology of previous Nosenko

bona fides studies, we have done so because the unfortunate

handling of Nosenko vas not an isolated event. Rather,

it was symptomatic ot some fundamental inadequacies of

Plans Directorate.

What this means

to us is that the

the

long-needed improvement in our conduct of counterintelli-

gence activity, now well underway, must be carried on

within the framework of a searching reexamination of the

analytical techniques employed by the Directorate and its

Clandestine Service.

Whatever the course taken, however, we believe that

the last quarter of this century is going to be

even more

than the past twenty-

exigent, though in a different w the implications of this

We therefore sum up

How can we ensure

that the upcoming generation of Clandestine Service leaders

is better prepared intellectually to meet the challenges

that face them than were those who ran the Service in

the sixties?

with responses to the matters covered in sub-paragraphs

Doubts regarding Nosenko's bona fides were of

our own making.

Had the job of initially assessing

him as a person, as well as of gathering and evaluating

the intelligence he had to offer, been handled

properly, he could have been declared a bona fide

defector

as readily

as have many other Soviet in-

telligence officers.

This is not to say that we can be certain of

the genuineness

any defector.

It will always

remain hypothetically possible

But the useful-

ness

of the Soviets' doing

so, in the manner

as-

cribed to them

in the Nosenko

case, is probably as

slight. as

is the feasibility.

Soviet success in

using native-born citizens of other countries to

spy on their own homelands has been considerable.

there is no record of the USSR's suc-

non-Communist power by use of an acknowledged

Soviet citizen,

least of all one whose career has

been spent in a Soviet intelligence or security

service.

We therefore conclude that Nosenko was from

the beginning a

bona fide defector.

2. Value of Nosenko

Nosenko's contribution has been summarized in

Chapter IV.

He has been of great value, but he

probably could have been even more valuable had he

been properly handled.

3. Relationship to Other Agents and Operations

As was made clear in Chapters X and XI, the

Nosenko case, through no fault of the defector him-

self, had a most unfortunate effect on all clandestine

operations in the Soviet field.

4.

Identification of Unexploited Leads

We have not felt that this subject was one we

could feasibly or properly investigate.

To do so

would have meant delving into the past and current

operations of both the SE Division and the CI Staff

to ascertain the extent to which there might have

persons whom Nosenko identified by name.

would not have permitted us to accomplish this

task, nor would our doing so have been consistent

with

the principle of compartmentation.

variety of techniques used in handling Nosenko did

B. Recommended Action

Most of our recommendations for action have been

previously stated or implied.

In the following para-

graphs, we

recapitulate them, with such supplementary

remarks as seem necessary.

1. Examination of the Role of Professionals

We recommend that the role that can properly be

played within the Agency by members of the organized

professions--medicine, psychiatry, psychology, law,

and others--be given careful study, within the con-

text of (a) ensuring that the Agency puts their skills

to the best possible use,

and (b)

refraining from in-

volving them in matters not properly within their

professional purview.

2. Improvement of Intellectual Standards

We recommend that the Operations Directorate,

and its Clandestine Service, take whatever steps

are possible to ensure that

the intellectual caliber

of their personnel is equal to the exigencies of the

We realize that the present personnel selection

system

sets high standards for

those entering on

duty at the professional level, particularly as

regards IQ and education.

But the

standards presently

in force do not by themselves guarantee that future

selections will possess independence of mind, analytical

ability, and objectivity.

In the case of personnel already on board,

it should be kept in mind that we live in a

rapidly-evolving, technologically-oriented

civilization.

Knowledge and intellectual

skills adequate at this time may be inadequate

For an intelligence or-

ganization, we define "inadequate" as anything

that is less than the best.

We suggest that a board of expert consultants

be established,

new entrants and improving the analytical skills

of those already on duty, with the aim of achiev-

ing and maintaining a high level of intellectual

excellence throughout the Operations Directorate.

Detection of Deception

We recommend that high priority be accorded a

program to develop new methods of detecting deception.

Some steps are already underway in this regard,

but they should be extended and given greater

emphasis.

Present methods, based mainly on the use

of the polygraph, are clearly obsolete.

Specific criteria of bona fides will follow

naturally from improved methods of detecting deception.

Psychological Aspects of Defector/Agent Handling and

Personnel Selection

We recommend a multi-track program of psychologi-

cal research, geared specifically to the Operations

Directorate's needs, to develop a new generation of

personality assessment techniques necessary for both

detector/agent handling and selection of DDO person-

nel. This program should be under direct DDO control.

A surprising amount of relevant expertise now

exists within the Agency,

and some valuable research

is underway,

but it is not being geared to DDO's

needs to the extent it could be.

Instead, it is

being handled by another directorate, which currently

accords it a low priority.
