Analysis of LIFEAT Traffic Relating, to LIEING/3 fOI

the Period

19-26 Apr11, 1957.

1.

In reviewing the traffic for the period indicated Ronton fuzd

valuable confirmation of LIRING/3 and LIRING/4 contact with Rami=s

Abreu, indicating that both persons complied with Rowton's suggertions.

LIRING/3's telepbonic contacts with Inrique Morales in Guatemala City

confirned reports given to him (Rowton) before and after the evezt.

The only iten not reported to Rowton, by LIRING/3 1s a dinner engaze-

ment. which Enrique liorales had in Guatemala City on 25/4/67 with friendg"

of Morales' wife, Esperanza. SAN-10 (17-5) also reveals that I756/3

and liorales are engaged in some sort of deal for the purchase of zurses

or briefcases (bolsas) either in Guatemala or San Cristóbal for ¿esale

1n Mexico City or import into the U.S. at a higüer price. (LIPD:/3

mentioned the opportunities in this line to Rowton previously, = Row-

ton did not react favorably).

2. The followirg are Rowton's comments on specific portions of the take

which will serve to clarify them la relationship to reports made to him

by LIRING/3 and IIRING/4:

LIRING/4 Contacts with Ramiro Abreu: On 22/4/67, shortly after Lowton:

suggested that LIRING/4 recontact Abreu and attempt to effect torough

him a reconciliation with the local mission, LIRING/4 telephined the

Embassy and attumpted to reach Abreu. From the content and taze of her

questions and remarks, it appears obvious that LIRING/4 has art bad re-

cent contact with the Cuban mission. She asas when Abreu is learing for

Havana, but is given no information. She tries again at abort 1900 and

2000, but there is no answer. She finally gets througa to drea on

14-13-26 who promises to come to her home between 1600 and 1:50 the

collowing day (23/4/67). She has to give Abreu the address, indicaiing

that he 1s not fawiliar with the home address of LIRING/3 or/z.

SAN-10 (5.0,8.2,12.2) reveal that Abreu called or talkod to zariG/4

on the telephone three times on 24/4/67. ITRNG/4 makes reference to

firston.

"so much analysis, so many thoories and ideas" which apparentiy xere i1s-

cussed between her and Abreu at their 23/4/67 conversation. inder re-

marks made both by LIRING/4 and Abreu indicate that Abreu 15, or watna

2.

In substance by LIRING/3, although Rowton has not as yet hid a chance

to talk directly with LIRING/4 to get her version of the conversations

with Abreu. Apparently in order to put. Abreu off (in his amorous de-

81A8) LIPI:G/4 teals bin on 25/4/67 that hex husband surrocts that

sorething 1s going on betweez shen. In reply to Abreu's enxious ques-.

tioning, LIRING/4 states that her husiand asked her shether she liked

Abreu and whether Abrew like her, to which she said that the repliod in

the affirmative (this apparently was calculated to cool Abreu off

without ali:nating hin). Abrew's visit to the ppartment ind his pro-

poed luncheon date with LIRING/3 were confimmed by the lutter in his

report to Ronton on 27/4/67.

Coaversatiuns Re the Birth Certificate: In SAN-10 (2.5) I.IRING/3 asks

his Guatemalan friend (Jacobo jodriguez Padilla?) whether it matters 11

the hath cantarianto ta for a person 10 years older? Jacoho replied

in the negative, but would prefer 1t of a person ten years younger.LI-

RIiG/3 promises to have the birth certificate in his posinssion by

25-26/4/87. This is the first confirmation Rowton has had of a state-

nent nade to him some two weeke previously that when he wunt to pick is

the (false) birth certificate at Registro Civil on instructions of his

half-brother (and the lawyer Folando Riojas) he discoverid that it was

for a person born in 1916 and hence useless for bimself. LIkinG/3 also.

reported to lowton that Jacobo kad contacted bin recently and asked fos

heip in obtaining false papers for himself. The above conversation

therefore would indicate that aIRING/3 plans to give Jacolo the false

docunent originally procured for himself through his half-brother. LI-

RING/3, however, has not revealed this plan to Rowton.

SAI-11 (16.0) reveals that LINING/3 inforned his brother two days later

that he has spent over ten days at Registro Civil but 1t 1a "impossible

to get the birth certificate. The book no longer exiasts." He adds that

he has written his half-brother a letter explaining everything. WRING/S

reportud to Rowton that he had asked his half-brother to obtain an

"acta notorial" in lleu of brita certificate and hoped to have the doci-

ment soon.

Commerce and Iniustry to obtaintho license for the importation of the

plastic flowers end that be had told Enrique korales Guerra to stand

by ustil the formalities of the license were completed. He added that

not feel under alz obligation to continue to use him, even in the flower

business, especially if Roston had any further reservations about him.

2. Regarding his friend Sergio González Marin of the Secretariat of

Commerce and Industry, LIRING/3 co: mented that, as he had reported pre-

viously to Rowtor, the latter had formerly been a member of the Communist

Party of Mexico, but was no longer active. LIRING/3 added that his sis-

ter, aurover, calitar

Conchlod Marin, was a very active member of the

Party and married tol a Raúl Moreno, who was also most probably a ember

of the Communist Party. LIatHG/3 continued that both faúl koreno and

Silva and binself (LIRING/ 3) had a mutual friend Sergichialdez who had

excellent contacts in extreme leftist circles LIRING/3 added that Sergio

Valdez was the son of the Siempre correspondent and associate of Alberto

Domingo, as well as vico Galán. According to LIRING/3, Sergio Valdez. 18

his (ITRING/3's) students for several years. LIRING/3 added that Sergio

Valdez' telephone number is 20-90-10, ext. 12.

3. In addition to the above, LIRIN /3 recounted that about 2 Nay, 1967, in

a contersation with Raúl Yoreno, he had learned that Moreno is friendly

with the FAR responsible for Propaganda at the National University. iI-

RING/3 commented that such a person would surely know "Garcia" of FAR,

and that therefor; he planned to arrange a meeting with him through Raul

Moreno at the first opportunity.

9 or 10.

preparlig a nunber of questions that still bothered him so that LIRIiG/3

could five a definitive reply that would close the matier for once and

all. LIRING/3 replied that he vas anxious to answer any questions forton

might have and hoped that this would resolve any problen and dispell any

lingering doubts that Rowton night still have concerning his bone fidea.
