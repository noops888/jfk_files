ing him that AL ROSEN was putting on & play in San Francisco and wanted

BIBERMAN to direct it.. An appointment was made for BIBERMAN at ROSEN s

thai day. This infornation was relayed by Source A, who later advised that

BIBERMA had contacted ROSEN and stated he had read the seript to the play

and it did not fit his talents.

This would indicate that despite BIBERIANiS

unemployment, which has been continuous since January, 1942, he refuses to

tako a legitimate job if it is not exactly what he wants. It

should also

be noted that BIBERMAN has been very anxious to obtain director's jobs and

do sell stories which he has writton, the former especially when they are

anti-pascist. (e

BIBERMAN was seen walking on Sunset Boulevard from the weste

It is believed

that he had been let out of a passing car.

The three men then got into a

1940 Suick Coupe, license 13-4-333. The short, stocky man, first described

above, was believed to be the driver. Thia car is registered to JULES DASSIN,

898 South Bronson, Los Angelos, legal ower G.l.A.d., 7046 Hollywood Boulevard.

The three men drove in this car to 1100 Sierra Alta Way®.

parked the car and it is believed that they entered the apartment

Sierra Alta Wey, although Agents did not see them enter the door.

Two other

cars were parked directly in front of the house:

Sierra Alta Pay was a 1935 Ford two-door, License 9-2-4588, rogistered to

MACK A. MANN, 1328 - 23rd Street, Santa Monica,

This car was' not grouped with the other three. (ClU)

The address 1100 Sierra Alte Pay 1s that of CuRTRUDE PRUCeL, men

ber' of the League of American titers, and

who in 1941 was an instructor

in the school for writers sponsored by the league. JULES DASSIN, & miter,

has been a contact of BIBERMAN's in the paste.

HY KRAFT is woll known in

the current investigation. lou

Lon Decenber 2, 1942, one Mrs. BROMILLER (phonetic), of the Progres

sive School,

contacted CALE SONDERGAARD, asking GALE 11 she wished to send

her child to school there. It was ascertained that CAlE did not intend to

send the girl there until aiter the first of the year. It was ascertained

on December 7, through Source A that Cale intended to send her airl to dirs.

"the following morning. Concerning the Progressive School, lo

cated at 2140 North lighland, it is Interesting to note that heLens BouGhtoNg

118 North Manhattan Place, Los Angeles, wrote a letter to Mias JOSEPHINE

VOLLER, Apartado 1179, Mexico D.F•

This letter was obtained by Confidential

Source E and relates that BOUGHTON has just returned from Mexico City and wants

to volunteer for any work she can do in Los Angeles for the anti-Fascist Com

mittee, apparently referring to the Joint Anti-Fancist Refugee Cormittee.

In the letter BOUGHTON states "I didn't succeed in reaching Mrs. MILLAN.

This Mrs, MILLAN may refer to VERNA C. MILIAN, author of "Mexico Reborn",

whose husband, according to Source E, Is IGNACIO MILIAN, The latter was

denounced by DIEGO RIVERRA, Mexican artist, as a member of the Communist

Party and therefore a member of 0 GoP.U.

This letter further reflects that

BOUGHDON was also unable to get to talk to hrs, SCHINDLER or to kirs. BIBER-

MAN, the Hollywood Chairman®

Continuings the letter

"Ohe of the musts of this week is

to see the people I have in mind who would be pretty sure to foot the picture

bill, so I hope that by the time I write again the check will be on its way.

I wonder whether addressing Nro. Whuan at the luis Vives School is all right.

The writer also referred to one CHULA BLACK,

whose energies she thinks might be utilized. The hrs. BIBERMAN referred to
