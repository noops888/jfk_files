MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE

SUBJECT: LANZ, Pedro Diaz

1. On 3 July 1959 Mr. Tom Flores, Wi Division, telephoned

my home, stating that he was unable to contact anyone in the

Alien Affairs Staff and that General Cabell was interested in

having a contact made with Immigration on an expedite basis.

2. Mr. Flores stated that Subject, the former head of the

Cuban Air Force, surreptitiously left Cuba and entered Miami on

2 July 1959. He was apprehended there by the Immigration and

Naturalization Service and is still in I&NS custody. Mr. Flores

stated that the FBI has talked to Subject; and that

the Wi rep-

resentative, Bernard Reichardt, has been in contact with the

Head of the

Inmigration Service in Miami. He has asked that

Subject be turned over to him for possible movement to Washing-

ton.

Mr. Reichardt stated that relationships between the Immi-

gration and Naturalization Service and himself were very good,

but that the District Director of I&NS in Miami had stated that

his Headquarters in Washington had ordered him not to release

Subject.

3.

Mr. Flores stated that General Cabell has been in con-

tact with the State Department, especially Bill Snow, Deputy

Director of Inter-American Affairs, and that Snow has the con-

currence of. Secretary Rubottom, who agrees with General Cabell

that Subject should be turned over to CIA for exploitation. Mr:

Flores stated that General Cabell directed that Immigration be

contacted to effect the release of Subject to CIA.

4. I contacted Herb Nice at his home and explained the

situation to him. He stated that he would attempt to contact

the proper officials in I&NS to effect the turnover. Some three

hours later Mr. Nice returned my call, stating that due to the

holiday weekend, he had had difficulty locating I&NS officials

and he has learned that General Swing had issued orders that

Subject's parole be revoked and that Subject would be held in

the custody of I&NS; that the Regional Director from Richmond,

& Mr. Shoneberger, would go to Miami on the case. Mr. Nice

stated it was his understanding that, because there was some

possible friction between the Army people in Miami and CIA, as

well as other possible agencies, General Swing had decided to

Keep Subject In I&NS custody and make him available to any author-

ized Agency who wished to talk to him.

5. Preparatory to a possible turnover to CIA, I contacted

Jim O'Connell, SSD, for possible support in moving Subject to

Washington. After learning of General Swing's decision to keep

Subject in custody in miami, I cancelled the support request to

Mr. O'Connell.

6. Later in the day Tom Flores, Wi Division, telephoned to

state he had been in contact with General Cabell and that General

Cabell had contacted General Willems, Assistant Chief of Staff,

Intelligence, Army, who authorized General Cabell to state that

he concurred in the turn over of Subject to CIA. Mr. Flores

stated that Air Force and State also concurred in this turnover.

Flores further stated that General Cabell was interested in being

7. I relayed this information to Mr. Nice, Immigration and

Naturalization Service, and he stated that he would inform the

necessary officials. Mr. Nice also stated there was no intention

on the part of INS to have any publicity concerning subject, but

that it might involve a situation with a newspaperman which could

not be controlled and inadvertently publicity might result, even

though it was Immigration's intention to not publicize the

fact

that Subject is being held.

8. I recontacted Mr. Flores and he stated that General

Cabell would probably be in touch with General Swing, Commissioner.

of Inmigration in Miami.

9. On 5 July 1959 MI. Nice

telephoned to state that he had

received a call from Mr. Henessey who is General Swing's Executive

Assistant and that it was his understanding that General Swing

would be telephoning General Cabell to discuss the situation. Mr.

Nice stated that he also understood that General Cabell had indi-

cated to General Swing that the CIA man, Reicharat, had not been

permitted to see

on Friday, 3 July, that Reichardt had seen Subject and that I had

received this information from the persons who were in touch with

General Cabell. Mr. Nice stated that this apparently was some-

thing that the two generals would have to iron out.

10. I attempted to locate Mr. Flores and General Cabell to

alert them to the possibility of a call from General Swing. I

could reach neither one.

11. On 6 July 1959 I advised Mr. Flores, WE Division, of

the information relayed to me by Mr. Nice on. Sunday, 5 July. He

stated that General Cabell had had a call from General Swing and

that the people in the State Department were quite concerned

the case would be taken up with the Wa Division today, 6 July.

12. I briefed Mr. Pennington, Alien Affairs, and advised

him that I was stepping out of the case.
