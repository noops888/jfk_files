I'S cannot be excected to keep track of him since tais 1s-a free country.

ander subpoena to the Senate Internal Security Subcarmittee and that wa

could get in touch with his by contacting the Comitted's officos. I ?

thanked hia for the Intomation and said that I would refer the matter

to xy supervisors innediately.

2. I soticed that the conversational tune used by Nice in telline

no the above kas sonenhat formal, and bellove tbat lils call was obviously

for the record. Re-enforcing my belief 1s the fact that Nice said he bad

called no outside of custonary liaison channels because ho wanted to nake

sure that the ren who would have to do the vort inrolved could be avare

or the situation.
