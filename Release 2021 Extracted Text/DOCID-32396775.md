Subject: Lee Harvey OSWALD.

"On the question of why Lee OSWALD felt that he could not get his Mexican

visa

extended without using his real name,

the following may be germane:

Mexican immigration records checked by the U.S. Consulate in Nuevo Laredo

and reported through the U.S. Embassy to both out office and yours HARVEY

that Lee OSWALD entered Mexico on 26. September 1963 using the name

OSWALD LEF.

It may be that OSWALD feared that any attempt to extend his

visa would result in discovery that he was in the country under a false

name; he might have had to show some identification to get the visa exten-

ded, and he probably had no documentation in the name of HARVEY OSWALD

LEE."'

Red Chinese would ask the Soviets for atomic weapons, the Communist Bloc

would win the war, the Chinese Reds would then assassinate KHRUSHCHEV and

Reference is made to your letter of 10 February 1964, relative to in-

formation supplied by this Agency on the activities of Lee Harvey OSWALD

in Mexico City

We surmise that the reference in OSWALD's letter of 9 November to a

man who had since been replaced must refer to Cuban Consul Busebio AZUE,

who left Mexico for Cuba on permanent transfer on 18 November 1963, four

days before the assassination. AZCUE had been in Mexico for eighteen

years and it was known (to us) as early as September 1963 that he was to

he replaced.

His replacement did arrive in September.

AZCUE was schedu-

led to leave in October but did not leave until 18 November

We do not know who might have told OSWALD that AZCUE or any other

Cuban had been or was to be replaced, but

we speculate that Silvia DURAN

or some Soviet official might have mentioned it if OSWALD complained about

AZCUF's altercation with him."

Documents on Lee Harvey OswALD rurnished by the soviet Govern-

[DDP 4-1764]

"1. The Soviet documents forwarded to this Agency under your letter of 20

May 1964 provide some additional detail on OSWALD.

The information in

these documents parallels that already available from other sources,

does not contradict our previous information.

The documents do clarify

somewhat OSWALD's alleged occupation at the Minsk radio plant giving the

original Russian terms used in decstabing his job.

"2. The following points relating to the documents are worth noting:

A significant omission from the materials provided is the letter

OSWALD allegedly wrote to the Supreme Soviet requesting Soviet citi-

zenship.

OSWALD signed a receipt in 1960 for his Identity Document for

Stateless Persons,

and a second receipt in 1962 for his Identity

Document for Foreigners.

The similarity of wording of the receipts

regarding his understanding of Soviet residence and travel regula

tions further supports our

belief that

such regulations are identical

or nearly identical for bearers of either type of identity document.

This means that OSWALD should have obtained permission in July 1961

to travel to moscow, but; as we know from other

cases,

failure to ob-

tain travel permission is not uncommon and not a serious oftense.

"c. The includsion of Marina's exit visa 'application' is singular

in view of the fact that the Commission had not requested information

on Marina.

The Soviet translators for OSWALD's early documents are believed

to be identical with persons already referred to in OSWALD's 'diary!.

113:

The format and wording of subject documents appear to be consistent

with Soviet practice."

"1:

In response to your memoranaum of 4o May. -904, we have established

that the only direct

flight from London

to. Hersinxi on

10 October 1959 was

Finn Air flight 852 which arrived in Helsinki at 2333 (11:33 p.m.):

OSWALD had taken this flight, he could not normally have cleared customs

and landing formalities and reached the Terni Hotel downtown by 2400. (mid-

night) on the same day:

This is based on the judgement of officers in

this Agency familiar with the Helsinki airport.

"2:

We are presently attempting to determine if OSWALD could have taken a

more circuitous

flight from London,

with a stop at Stockholm, Copenhagen,

or some other city:

•Any additional information received will be forwarded

to you promptly."

Subject: Lee Harvey OSWALD.

[DDP 4-3401]

The following remarks have been recently attributed to Soviet Consul

Pavel Antonovich YATSKOV in Mexico City regarding the subject.

'I met OSWALD here.

He stormed into my office and

wanted me to introduce and recommend him to the Cubans.

He told me that he had lived in the USSR.

I told him that

I would have to check before I could recommend him. He

was nervous and his hands trembled, and he stormed out !

of my office.

I don't believe that a person as nervous as

OSWALD,

whose hands trembled could have accurately

fired a rifle.'

MOHRENSCHILDT said that President Kennedy was hated

by the Dallas elite, and he felt that it was very

likely that certain reactionary elements in Dallas had

organized a plot to get rid of Kennedy and used a dis-

A review of the results of monitoring Soviet foreign broadcasts at

the time when an interview with Lee Harvey OSWALD had apparently been

taped was conducted with negative results.

Therefore, it is assumed

that such a tape, if broadcast at all, was aired over

a local USSR facili-

"2. With respect to the same question, Yuriy NOSENKO was asked if any

attempt had heen made hy the Soviets to exploit OSWALD for propaganda

purposes, such as Radio Moscow broadcasts,

telecasts, or lectures.

NOSENKO replied that this had not been done either in Moscow or in Minsk.

The American Embassy in Stockholm,

The letter purports

to he from one Ryo Liang Yuan of the Red Chinese Embassy in Stockholm,

no such official is assigned there and there is no record of Chinese

official by this name anywhere abroad.

The letter is written in broken English and stated that the Chinese

communists got in contact with OSWALD when he was in the Soviet Union.

When OSWALD returned to the U.S.A., the Red Chinese re-contacted him,

threatened to expose him if he did not cooperate.

The Red Chinese ex-

pected that the

U.S. would attack

Cuba when it learned that the assassin

was a Cuban sympathizer.

The Soviets would then attack'the U.S.A.,

Red Chinese would ask the Soviets

for atomic weapons, the Communist Bloc

would win the war, the Chinese Reds would then assassinate KHRUSHCHEV and

take over control

Entry in "Historic Diary"

[DDP 4-0864]

In a document entitled 'Historic Diary' there appears an entry

which refers to 'an elderly American'.

The entry is under the date 26

October 1959 when OSWALD was allegedly confined in an unidentified Moscow

hospital..

It is apparent that every effort should be made to iden-

tify the

elderly American, if he existed.

•We assume the lead is

still outstanding:

our recommendation that the Department of State

urgently request through its channels a careful search of Embassy and Con-

sular records in Moscow which might reveal the identity of an elderly

American hospitalized at the end of October 1959 and possibly registered

with the Embassy as a tourist.

His replacement did arrive in September. AZCUE was schedu-

to leave in October but did not leave until 18 November.

We do not know who might have told OSWALD that AZCUE or any other

or some Soviet official might have mentioned it if OSWALD complained about

AZCUE's altercation with him."

Documents on Lee Harvey OSWALD Furnished by the Soviet Govern-

/[DDP 4-176411

The Soviet documents forwarded to this Agency under your letter of 20

May 1964 provide some additional detail on OSWALD.

The information in

these documents parallels that already available from other sources,

does not contradict our previous information. The documents:

do clarify

somewhat OSWALD's alleged occupation at the Minsk radio plant giving the

original Russian terms used in decsribing his job.

"2.

The following points relating to

the documents are worth noting;

A significant omission from the materials provided is the letter

OSWALD allegedly wrote to the Supreme Soviet requesting Soviet citi-

zenship.

OSWALD signed a receipt in 1960 for his Identity Document for

Sole to meet te sincerity of wording oe the rectl

Desander foreigner and of solar te if need and of the receipts

tions further supports our belief that such regulations are identical

or nearly identical for bearers of either type of identity document.

This means that OSWALD should have obtained permission in July 1961

but, as we know from other cases,

tain travel permission is not uncommon and not a serious offense.

The includsion of Marina's exit visa

'application' Is singular

in view of the fact that the Commission had not requested information

on Marina.:

The Soviet translators for OSWALD's early documents are believed

to be identical with persons already referred to in OSWALD's 'diary'

The format and wording of subject documents appear to be consistent

with Soviet practice."

In response to your memorandum of 25 May 1964, we have established

that the only direct

flight from London to Helsinki

on 10 October 1959 was

Finn Air flight 852 which arrived in Helsinki at 2333 (11:33 p.m.):

""If:

OSWALD had taken this flight, he could not normally have cleared customs

and landing formalities and reached the Terni Hotel downtown by 2400 (mid-

night) on the same day:

This is based on the judgement of officers in

this Agency familiar with the Helsinki airport.

"2. We are presently attempting to determine if OSWALD could have taken

more circuitous flight from London,

with a stop at Stockholm, Copenhagen,

or some other city..

Any additional information: received will be forwarded

co you promptly."

The following remarks have been recently attributed to Soviet Consül

Pavel Antonovich YATSKOV in Mexico City regarding the subject:

'I met OSWALD here.

He stormed into my office and

wanted me to introduce and recommend him to

the Cubans

He told me that he had lived in the USSR.

I told him that

I would have to check before I could recommend him. He

was nervous and his hands trembled, and he stormed out

of my office:

I don't believe that a person as nervous as

OSWALD, whose hands trembled could have accurately

fired a rifle.'

Our Mexican Station has checked its records for the period OSWALD

to YATSKOV; or that he first spoke to KOSTIKOV who turned him over to his

superior YATSKOV.

"1. A reviow of the results of monitoring Soviet foreign broadcasts at

the time when an interview with Lee Harvey OSWALD had apparently been

taped was conducted with negative results.

Therefore,

it is assumed

that such a tape, if broadcast at all, was aired over a local USSR facili-

ty for internal consumption.

With respect to the same question, Yuriy NOSENKO was asked if any

attempt had been made by the Soviets

to exploit OSWALD for propaganda

purposes, such as Radio Moscow broadcasts, telecasts,

or lectures.

NOSENKO replied that this had not been done either in Moscow or in Minsk.

We have no information which would either confirm or refute allega-

in April and May 1960 or at any other time.

brought with him to the British Embassy may be translated 'wet affairs

It is an expression or jargon used by the KGB to refer

to activities involving kidnapping or assassination.
