DORIICOS of Cuba.

However, Echeverria later told LEGATithat he had decided to rearrest

Since we had received no reply to yesterday's teleprem (MEXI 7072 - para 97 above)

we have not requested Mexi gov to take g any aotion against Silvia except to maintain

Increased surveillance of her activities.

Echeverria Later denied to LEGAT that he had any

specific concrete evidence that she was about to leave for Cuba.

We do not now know which

Echeverria statements are accurate.

It is quite posslole, and even probable, that contra-

dictory statements made by Echeverria are explainges oy

of OSWALD visit here.

Mexi line still is that OSWALl, visit related solely to visa question.

Consistent with this Echeverria stated to LEGAT. that DORTICOS only interested in finding

This is obviously Incorrect

all of these individuals are on current consular list.
