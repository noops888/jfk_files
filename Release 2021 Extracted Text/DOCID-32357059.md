Letter to Mr. Richard HELMS, Deputy Director for Plans,

dated 31 January 1964, from J. Lee RANKIN, General Counsel:

"Thank you for your memorandum of January 25,

transmitting a detailed

OSWALD's stay in the Soviet Union

chronology of Lee Harvey

and

the alphabetical

list of persons in the Soviet Union who were known

to

or mentioned by Lee Harvey OSWALD or his wife.

"Based on an initial review I am confident that

this material will be of great assistance to the work

of this Commission.

However, I have a question re-

garding the mention of an appendix in the Name List.

For example,

there are references to

"Appendix B'

under items

No. 70 and No. 91.

I would appreciate

knowing whether one or more appendices have been

prepared to

the materials which can be made available

to this Commission."

31 January 1964

Letter to Mr. J. Edgar HOOVER, Director, Federal Bu-

reau of Investigation, dated 31 January 1964, from J. Lee

RANKIN, General Counsel.

"We understand you already have furnished the

Central Intelligence Agency with the Summary Report

entitled

'Investigation of Assassination of President

John F. Kennedy, November 22, 1963'

and accompanying

exhibits; the Summary Report

entitled 'Investigation

of Killing of Lee Harvey OSWALD,

Texas, 24

November 1963'; and the two Supplemental Reports to

these summaries.

At a conference on January 28,

1964,

attended by

Mr. MOLLEY and representatives of the

Secret Service and the Central Intelligence Agency,

we discussed the possibility of supplying additional

reports of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to the

Central Intelligence Agency in order to enable that

agency

to be of further assistance to the Commission.

It was agreed that F.B.l. reports would be made avail-

able to C.I.A.

and that representatives of the two

agencies would consult regarding

the precautions to

be taken in the use of these materials.

"Accordingly, the Commission would

appreciate

your furnishing

the C.I.A. (Attention:

Mr.. Richard

HELMS) copies of the following reports:

"All correspondence carried on by Lee Harvey

OSWALD with persons in the Soviet Union, in particular,

Commission your memorandum

dated January 31, 1964,

relating to information developed by your Agency on

Lee Harvey OSWALD activity in Mexico City during

the period of September 28 to October 3, 1963.

"I assume - and would like to be so advised

if the

contrary is the feat - that your January

as I recall

an

investigation is currently being pursued with

respect to an allegation of some significance

which emanated from the White House and which is

not referred to in the above-mentioned report.

With respect to this allegation,

it would be

greatly appreciated if you would furnish us with

Counsel.

"The Commission has recently received a report

from the Federal Bureau of Investigation covering an

interview that took place between representatives of

in a separate memorandum.

Mr. RANKIN's staff showed us a

Members of Mr. RANKIN's staff then spoke

about having found a book in OSWALD's possessions

that this might have formed the base or key

for a cipher system.

"5.: Members of Mr. RANKIN's

staff then com-

mented

on the testimony

of Mrs. OSWALD to the effect

that

the letters

from

her son regarding his desire

to return to

the United States had the appearance

of being dictated since they contained none of his

usual grammatical errors and

used

legal language

with which he would not have been familiar.

"6.

MI. WILLEMS noted that Mrs. OSWALD had

introduced a statement to the effect that she sus-

pected her

son

to be a CIA agent.

"7. A considerable part of the meeting from

point forward consisted of a review by Mr.

RANKIN and his staff of the gaps in their investi-

gation to date.

In connection with the Mexican

phase of

the investigation,

members of Mr. RANKIN's staff

questioned Mr. HELMS and Mr. ROCCA regarding

extent of the CIA file on OSWALD for the period

8 October to 22 November 1963.

The question of why no action was taken

by other agencies. of the government after their

receipt of CIA information that OSWALD was in

contact with the Soviet and Cuban Embassies in

Mexico City was next discussed.

The Commission, Mr. RANKIN said, would

be interested in any information held by CIA on

dated 16 March 1964, from J. Lee RANKIN, General Counsel.

"During

we discussed

our conference of March 12, presidential

informally several questions concerning

protection, which I would. like to put informally to

obtain any comments your Agency may desire to make.

"First, at the time of the assassination, did

description of the criteria to be employed by

its

personnel in determining what information coming to

their attention should be furnished to the Secret

Service?

If not

in a written

form,

was there any

general policy with respect to this matter?

"Second, has the Central Intelligence Agency any

recommendations to make regarding possible improve-

aspect of Presidential protection,

Assassination of President Kennedy, 27 March 1964,

"1. I talked with Mr. Samuel A. STERN re-

garding

the Commission's interest in original

Agency materials on Friday, 27 March 1964, from

2:30 to 4:00.

Mr. STERN hewed closely to the guidelines

which had been established between Mr. HELMS

and Mr.

RANKIN: he read - or asked to read - only papers

that had a bearing on the summarized information

that had already been forwarded to the Commission.

In the course of the discussion, he viewed the

following specific items of original Agency docu-

mentation:

FBI, and Navy reporting contact

with Soviet Embassy, Mexico, by American,

Lee OSWALD.

Mr. STERN stated he had a keen interest in

Agency programs for electronic data handling of in-

formation.

I pointed out to him the up-dated machine

control record on the contents of the OSWALD file

and suggested that I was sure that Mr. HELMS would

be pleased to offer him and others in the Commission

the possibility of viewing the Agency's data pro-

cessing mechanisms.

It was also noted that a

derable effort had already been made by Mr. HELMS'

subordinates to interest members of the intelligence

community in an interagency approach to the machine

control of counterintelligence and security informa-

A presentation had been made before the ICIS

•on this matter and an article had been prepared for

Studies in Intelligence.

I promised to make a copy

of the article available to Mr. STERN.

STERN was eager to view our actual

meghanisms for machine control of our information

and readily accepted the suggestion that a briefing

take place. It was indicated to him that he would

becontacted by CI Staff's Machine Records Officer

who would arrange the details for the presentation

in the near

future.

Mr. STERN volunteered oneupoint in the dis-

cussion that the Agency handling of the information

in the OSWALD case was unique among what the Commis-

sion had found had happened in every other agency.

He was critical of the Navy. He raised specifically

the question:

why had the Navy not forwarded the

He added that there were six or seven other

points on which the Navy had been gigged by the Com-

mission and there would be discussion

between him and

the Navy in the near future..

He stated flatly that

no Federal component except CIA had been able to show

the Commission hard documentation which indicated

there had been immediate

action

information by headquarters and full instructions

Mr. STERN tended to equate this perfor-

mance to the way we handled our data and for that

reason placed great emphasis upon what the Commission

might be able to do in its report for an improved

methodology based on machines among departments and

agencies involved in security matters."

Memorandum for Deputy Director for Plans, dated 13

April 1964, by David E. MURPHY, Chief, SR Division; Subject:

• Discussions with Mr. Allen W. DULLES on the OSWALD Case.

"I. At the instructions of the DDP, I visited Mr.

DULLES

on 11 April to discuss with him certain ques-

tions which Mr.

DULLES feels the Warren Commission may

pose to CIA.

Mr. DULLES explained that while the Com-

was Mrs. Marguerite OSWALD, Lee Harvey OSWALD'S

and the other was Mr. Mark LANE, Mrs.

OSWALD's attorney.

Mr. DULLES then suggested that the res-

ponse to this question could be in the form of

testimony before the Commission by a senior

CIA official or a letter or affidavit.

called that the Director of the FBI had replied

by letter to a similar question.

In any event,

Mr. DULLES felt that the reply

should be straight-

He thought language

which made it clear that Lee Harvey OSWALD was

never an employee or agent of CIA would suffice.

We should also state that neither CIA nor anyone

acting on CIA's behalf was ever in contact or

communicated with OSWALD.

I agreed with

him that a carefully.

phrased denial of the charges

of involvement ith OSWALD seemed most appropriate.

The next question concerned the possi-

of OSWALD's having been a Soviet agent.

suggested that the Commission's question on

this matter be phrased somewhat as follows:

the knowledge or judgement of CIA was Lee Harvey

OSWALD an agent of the Soviet intelligence services

of the intelligence services of other communist

states at any time prior to 22 November 1963, o1

was OSWALD solicited by

these intelligence services

to become such an agent?'

Mr. DULLES and J

felt that

it would be better to .

• confine our

response to a precise statement of fact.

in Mr. DULLES' view, could note that dis state-

possessed no knowledge either gained independently

or from

its study of the materials supplied by the

Commission tending to show that Lee Harvey OSWALD

of the Soviet intelligence services,

or the services of any other communist country, or

for that matter of any other country.

• Mr. DULLES mentioned other issues

which concerned the Commission.

He remarked that

members of the Commission could not understand why

cia had not begun an investigation of OSWALD as

soon as it received word that he had defected. I

noted that this question had been discussed with

Mr. RANKIN and his staff and there seemed to be

considerable [mis]understanding of the practical

circumstances which made it impossible for CIA to

undertake such investigation inside the USSR.

expressed the hope that it would not be necessary

for CIA to place matters

of this sort in the public

Mr. DULLES agreed.

Mr. DULLES then asked if it were normal for

the Soviet Government to permit a Soviet woman to

marry a foreigner and then allow her to leave with

her husband shortly after the marriage.

This question

perturbed the Commission and they would like to have

an answer.

I said that .

• the problem seemed to

lie more in the consular field and I suggested that

the best way to obtain an opinion on what constituted

'normal practice' in marriage cases in the USSR would

I did offer a personal opinion in

regard. to the way in which CIA should respond.

that testimony on questions such as these would be

difficult to insert in the public record, I suggested

that it would be best if the CIA response were

ten form.

However, much will depend on the form in

which the questions are eventually put to us and I

imagine that a final decision can be made at that time.

Pursuant to the Director's suggestion,

I presen-

Mr. DULLES and I then exchanged views on

the possibility of finding language which would al-

lude to the existence of otherm unverified informa-

tion on the OSWALD case.

This language would per-

mit the Commission to

say if challenged in the future

that it had taken the NOSENKO informa-

tion into consideration in the final report but at

the same time it would not be presented

which would be at variance with the important opera-

tional considerations we have raised.

It was agreed that an effort might be made

to find

such language if Mr. DULLES is again unsuc-

cessful in persuading his colleages to eliminate any

reference to the NOSENKO information from the report.

To attempt this, however, we would have to know pre-

cisely in what context the Commission intended to

make use of the NOSENKO information.

This, Mr. DULLES

will have to determine from Mr. RANKIN.

9 July 1964

Memorandum for the Record, dated 9 July 1964; subject:

Discussion with Warren Commission Staff Member; signed by

Lee. H. WIGREN, C/SR/CI/Research.

With the approval of C/SR and the DDP, I met

with Mr. W. David SLAWSON of the

staff..

purpose of this meeting was to discuss

apparent incon-

sistencies in material provided the Commission by CIA

and by the Department of State which were called to

attention in a letter from

the General Counsel of

Commission to Mr. HELMS, dated 3 July 1964.

By way of introduction, MI. SLAWSON said that

the portion of the Commission's report that he was

writing, he would have to deal with the question of

whether

or not the OSWALDs' departure from the USSR -

and the circumstances (i... timing) of that departure

were unusual or suspicious in any way. He expressed

his belief that they probably were not and cited

Soviet relaxation in such matters in the post-Stalin

However, he wanted to be

sure in his own mind

NW 65924 Docld:32357059 Page 17.

## Page 18

- 17 -

that our information was

not in conflict with that

which the Commission had received

from State since

all of that information would

remain in the records

of the Commission.

"3.

After stating my belief that there was no

real disagreement or inconsistency between

infor-

mation from CIA and that from State,

I expressed the

view that the matter resolved itself into three

questions:

Do the Soviet authorities normally

permit Soviet citizens married

to foreign

nationals to emigrate from the Soviet Union

to the homelands of their spouses?

Do they normally permit such Soviet

citizens to accompany

(i.e. depart simultane-

with) their spouses from the Soviet

"c.

How long does it take such Soviet

citizens to get Soviet exit visas for such a

purpose (time lapse from application to gran-

ting of visas)?

Concerning the first two questions (3a and

3b above) I pointed

out that we had addressed

to the question of Soviet citizens

accompany their spouses abroad while

State dealt only with the

larger question of Soviets

married to foreigners being allowed to emigrate with-

out reference to whether or not they left simultane-

ously with or at another time from their spouses.

Mr. SLAWSON commented that this explanation was most

helpful and he reread what both we and State had said

in that light.

the statements in paragraph 6 of our memorandum of

6 April 1964 concerning Soviets being permitted to

accompany their foreign spouses abroad were based on

a review of 26 cases, of which 10 involved Americans:

In only four of these cases did a Soviet wife leave

the USSR in the company of her foreign husband; in

and in the remaining seven cases

are known to permit us to categorize them.

that although State's information began by citing

the issuance of 724 quota and non-quota immigrant

visas by the American Embassy in Moscow during the

period FY 1954 to December 1963, it did not indicate

now many of these visas were for soviet citizens who

had married U.S. nationals.

Actually State provided

detailed information for only sixteen cases and did

indicate in many of these whether or not the

Soviet was permitted to accompany the foreign spouse.

In response to a question from Mr. SLAWSON

I stated that most of the 26 cases upon which we based

our statements involved foreign students,

exchange

teachers and other relatively transient persons,

while a number of cases have certain points in

they bear little similarity to the OSWALD case in that

none involved a defector who married prior to repatri-

ating. I noted that paragraph 6 of our 6 April 1964

memorandum to the Commission had pointed this out.

Mr. SLAWSON indicated he was now satisfied on this

authorities to process visas for Soviet citizens married

to foreign nationals (question 3c above), I stated

that, in my

opinion, the information provided by

State (in the third enclosure to Mr. MEEKER'S

substantially corresponded

to the views ex-

pressed in paragraphs 6 and 7 of our memorandum

asked if it would be possible to elaborate para-

graph 7 of our memorandum of 6 April by providing

statistical breakdown of the cases on which our

statements were based. I indicated that this could

be done.

"8.

At this point Mr. SLAWSON stated that as a

result of our discussion he felt that the question of

possible inconsistencies had been resolved..

However,

he asked that we send

a brief written reply to the

Commission's letter of 3 July 1964 embodying the sub-

stance of what I had said concerning the basis for

statements included in our 6 April 1964 memorandum.

Report. [Participants in meeting held on 16 July 1964:

J. Lee RANKIN, General Counsel of the Commission, Mr.

SLAWSON, MI. Tennent H. BAGLEY, and Mr. Lee WIGREN.]

At mr. HELMS' request we discussed with

SLAWSON

and Mr. RANKIN how and in what manner

NOSENKO's information might be used in the published

report of the Warren Commission.

Mr. HELMS had dis-

cussed this problem with Mr. DULLES and Mr. RANKIN

and Mr. MURPHY had also discussed it with Mr. DULLES

(the latter conversation was reported in a memoran-

dum of 8 July 1964).

Mr. HELMS'.

instructions to me

were to discuss the matter cooperatively but

leave all decisions to Mr. HELMS.

Mr. SLAWSON, with whom we gpoke alone for

the first 20

minutes, had drafted a memorandum to

Mr. RANKIN proposing

a text embodying NOSENKD's in-

formation for the Commission's report. He invited

us to read and comment on it.

After reading Mr. SLAWSON's proposed text,

I told him

that CIA wanted to assist the Warren Com-

mission in any way possible.

For a number of reasons

text could be damaging to the interests

of the Commission:

Regardless

of the wording

of the

source description, it was very.

likely that

the press would very quickly be able to i-

dentify the 'confidential Soviet Union Source'

as NOSENKO.

(Neither Mr. SLAWSON nor, later,

Mr. RANKIN disagreed with this.)

"b. NOSENKO is very likely to be uncovered

publicly as a KGB plant at some time in the future.

When this occurs unsophisticated readers of the

NW 65924 Docld:32357059 Page 19

Commission's report will be inclined to read

his

statements through

a mirror

and to assume

that the reverse of what he said

was true;

i.e.,. that OSWALD was a KGB agent, perhaps

dispatched on a mission to kill President

Kennedy.

The inclusion of NOSENKO's informa-

followed by the later revelation that he

was a Soviet plant, would cast a shadow over the

reliability of the

report and the judgement of

the Commission.

Revelation that NOSENKO had any speci-

fic knowledge of OSWALD's case in the Soviet

Union would be seized upon by

an alert press

the most intriguing new item

in the whole report.

It would make NOSENKO into a public figure again

and would raise demands for

public appearances

and testimonies.

This would have catastrophic

our current plans to get to the bottom

of the NOSENKO affair and,

among other things,

would lessen our chances of eventually learning

the true story behind his OSWALD information.

we might be able in this way to contribute

significantly to the work of the Commission.

Mr. SLAWSON immediately and without further

discussion said

that he was convinced of the validity

of our

arguments.

NOSENKo's name or information were included in the re-

portission spokesmen whether or not NOSENKO,

the press representatives would specifically ask

ledge of the affair.

be in the position of having overlooked this source

nor of having withheld matters relevant to the inves

tigation.

However,

since NOSENKO appears to be a

KGB plant,

not appear necessary or desirable to

information in full and Mr. RANKIN

agreed that

there would be

a public tendency to mirror-read NOSENKO's

after he was revealed to be a KGB plant.

At this point we all agreed that some language

could be found which would protect the Commission

later accusations of having used planted information

or of witholding testimony.

CIA's aim was to avoid

NOSENKO's becoming a public figure or mystery or center

of attention.

We whated if possible to slide through

the publication of the Warren Commission report with

our handling of NOSENKO as untroubled as possible.

Since Mr. RANKIN seemed rather certain that the press

ask whether NOSENKO had been

consulted, even if

did not appear in the report,

it might very

well be in CIA's interest,

as well as

the Commission's,

to have NOSENKO's name mentioned

in the report. (in a

manner which would discourage further questions).

inclined to say,

at one point, something to

the effect that the Commission received information

from various confidential sources, without specifying

what information or which sources were involved, which

'did not affect the Commission's conclusions'

We also discussed the possibility of drafting a state-

ment to be used by Commission members should they be

questioned by the press.

agreed that Mr. RANKIN and Mr. SLAWSON

work out some phraseology which

would meet our

Memorandum of Conversation, dated 28 July 1964;

subject: Use of NOSENKO Information

in Warren Commission

Report.

[Participants in a meeting on

27 July 1964:

Mr. Allen W. DULLES, Mr. J. Lee RANKIN, and Mr. David

SLAWSON of thé Warren Commission; Mr. Richard HELMS., Mr.

David E. MURPHY, and Mr. Tennent H. BAGLEY of CIA.]

This discussion,

following

earlier ones on

the same subject,

called by Mr.

RANKIN to discuss

proposed drafts for inclusion or non-inclusion of

NOSENKO's information in

the report of the Commission.

Mr. SLAWSON had

prepared

a short

memorandum with three

attachments, offering alternative dratts.

A copy of

Me. SLAWSON's memo;

which was

an informal one and

for permanent Commission records, is attached.

Of these drafts, one (#2) names NOSENKO, ad-

mits

he had direct knowledge of OSWALD's case in the

USSR

and comments that his reliability is uncertain.

Another (#3, parts 1 and 2) includes information from

NOSENKO about OSWALD which would be included in the

report; NOSENKO is not named as the cource.

(#4) is for inclusion in the Commission report if no

NOSENKO information is used, explianing why certain

information was not included in order to protect the

Commission from later charges of having failed to

use NOSENKO's information.

The CIA representatives thought that it woutd

be undesirable to

include any NOSENKO information in

and after some discussion, there was

agreement

on this view.

circumstances which

• contributed to this conclusion are summarized here:

NOSENKO is a KGB pland and may be pub-

licly exposed as such some

time after the ap-

pearance of the Commission's report.

evaluate the accuracy

nor the significance of his having reporting it.

Even without public discrediting of the

source, specific aspects of NOSENKO's information

are likely to lead to questions and doubts on the

part of perceptive readers.

Once NOSENKO is exposed as a KGB plant,

there will arise the danger that his information

will be mirror-read by

the press and

leading to conclusions that the USSR did direct

the assassination.

The Agency's greatest contribution to

the resolution of the questions at hand would be

to break NOSENKO and get the full story of how c

and why he was told to tell the story he did

about OSWALD.

While we have no certainty that

we can ever do this, if we are to succeed we need

time and must in the meantime avoird creating

pressures which might force us to release NOSENKO

to the public domain.

(There, articulate and

plausible,

he would

ungestionably be able to es-

tablish himself beyond hope of dislodging, since

his story cannot be easily be pierced even by

trained specialists, much less by private citizens

however intelligent.)

The release of the fact

that NOSENKO knew specifically about the OSWALD

case would, of course,

create such pressure,

and

no hedging

on source description could protect

his identity.

The Commission

representatives,

particularly

Mr. RANKIN, felt that

of NOSENKO might be

inevitable, at least when after the publication of its

report, the press would ask the Commission about him

and whether he had had anything to contribute.

HELMS suggested that CIA could provide a number of

Soviet intelligence defectors to testify to the Com-

mission, and the Commission could then report that

'defcetors',

and without naming NOSENKO,

had given information.

in general'it was agreed that the Agency

already provided such defector information in its

previous reports,

and that wording to this effect

could be worked into the Commission's draft #4, which

was otherwise quite suitable

from the point of

of the Agency and the Commission.

• At Mr. HELMS' sug-

gestion,

it was agreed that CIA would

draft a few sentences. to this effect.

Commission's

request, we have tested, in the soviet

Embassies in Stockholm and Helsinki

the time required

to get a Soviet tourist visa,

is impossible and five days the apparent minimum in

both places.

In one, however,

it was implied that

shortage of hotel space might be a contributing factor,

so these findings might not be valid for the month of

October, when OSWALD apparently got his visa in two or

three days."

CHRONOLOGICAL SUMMARY: Gilberto Nolasco 'ALVARADO Ugarte

19 September-1963

According to ALVARADO's statements made during an inter

view conducted in the morning of 26 November 1963 by an American

Embassy.security officer_and a member of the Mexico Station in

Mexico City, ALVARADO went at noon on 18 September to the Cuban

11202

Consulate to turn over passport photographs to the Cuban Consul

Eusebio AZCUE.

While standing by a rest room off a passage

way leading to a patio, ALVARADO saw a group of three persons con-

versing on the patio a few feet away.

One man was a tally thin

Negro with reddish hair obviously dyed He had prominent cheek

bonestland a noticeable scar on the lower right side of his chin.

He spoke radpidly with a Cuban accent and did speak some English?

Another member of the group was a white person whom ALVARADO had

seen previously in the waiting room, carrying a Canadian passport.

The Canadian had green eyes, blondish hair combed in an existen:

tialist manner with a pompadour. He was wearing: dark eyeglasses

of a type with a mirror tikerreflection ong the outer surfaces ther

third member of the group was Lee Harvey OSWALD. Her was waering a

black sport coat, a buttoned up white shirt with short collar tabs.

no tie, gray pants, and clear eyeglasses

ALVARADO saw a tall Cuban join the group momentarily and

pass American currency to the Negro. This unidentified Cuban ap-

parently came out of AZUE's office onto the patio. ALVARADO des =

cribed the Cuban as a tall, solidly built mulatto, with curly hair

who appeared to be about 37 years old. He was wearing a brown suit

and a red-striped tie.

ALVARADO never saw this man again after 18

September:

ALVARADO claimed he overheard the following conversation

between the Negro and OSWALD:

Negro (in English):

"I want to kill the man'

OSWALD

'You're not man enough I can do

it."

-SECRET

NW 65924 Docld:32357059 Page 55

SEGRET

Negro (in Spanish): "I can't go with you.

I have a lot

to do."

OSWALD

'The people are waiting for me-back

there."

The Negro gave OSWALD six thousand five hundred dollars

in large denomination US bills saying:

This isn't much."

Of the

sum, one thousand five hundred dollars was for extra expenses.

The

Negro also gave him about 200 Mexican pesos.

Later, ALVARADO saw a pretty girl, whom he believed to be

a Cuban employee of the Consulate, give OSWALD an abrazo embrace

and tell him she was living at Galle Juarez number 407 where he

could find her. The girl appeared to about 20 years ald and had

manners which reminded ALVARADO of a prostitute: OSWALD, the Negxo

and the Canadian then went upstairs.

ALVARADO left the building momentarily to buy popsicle

on the corner; he saw the above three men leave by the Embassy gate

near the corner of Tacubaya where they entered a parked black car,

possibly a Chrolet.

At the end of September, ALVARADO, telephoned the American

Embassy several times to report his belief that someone important

in the United States was to be killed.

When ALVARADO saw OSWALD's photograph in the newspaper,

he again contacted the Embassy on 25 November.

IMEX1-7069 (IN 68376), 26 November 1963]

25 November 1963

ALVARADO called the United States Embassy.

That same

evening the met with the Embassy security officer.

CIMEXI-7168 (IN 70860), 30 November 1963]

[Comment: According to the Mexican police report of the interroga-

tion of ALVARADO, the latter called the American Embassy and

"succeeded in speaking to a high official with whom he made an ap-

pointment for that same day at 5:30 p.m. near the Hotel Maria

Isabel.]

Two individuals appeared for the 5:30 p.m. appointment

They identified themselves and were carrying the credentials-of

appointment was made for 9:15 the next morning at the Jena Restau-

rant:

officer, and A. C. PLAMBECK (P), Mexican Station officer: ALVARADO

may have mistaken Embassy-identification documents for FBI creden

tiats.1

25 November 1963:

ALVARADO Claimed inter alia that two persons were in the

Cuban Embassy the morning of 25 November 1963 at 1100 who are in:

volved inthe plot to assassinate President Kennedy he described

them as one being a white person with a large cleft noses the

other had closed cropped hair with a copote fsic)y

ALVARADO claims that on the 18th of September, he was in

the Cuban Embassy in Mexico Gity and he saw Lee Harvey OSWALD Te

ceive 56, 500. OSWALD was speaking with a Begro, about 29 years of

age, who had a scar on his jaw, and had reddish hair which is pro-

bably tinted. The Negro spoke English well and might be a North

American. OSWALD was speaking of eliminating someone. The Negro

then said he was sorry that he could accompany OSWALD, saying:

"You understand my situation." To which OSWALD replied: That's

all right, I can do this myself."

The source' (ALVARADO?) was of the opinion that OSWALD

had come from Havana. When OSWALD entered (the Consulate 2) he

was affectionately greeted by a female employee of the Cuban Em

bassy, who has blue eyes and lives at Calle Juarez 407.

The "source" also stated that OSWALD was given $1,500

for extra expenses. Source stated that when he went to the bath

room he saw OSWALD counting the money in American dollars, on the

patio which is adjacent.

up and down a few streets. ALVARADO told them again what he had

observed in the Cuban Consulate and they gave him 100 pesos and

told him they woudl call him at the number 41-07-31, which is the

On 26 November 1963 Gilberto ALVARADO, a

professed Castroite Nicaraguan born 31 January

1940 in Ciudad Rama, Zelaya, Nicaragua, came

to the American Embassy in Mexico and made a

•statement about Lee OSWALD. He said that on

18-September 1963 he saw Lee OSWALD receive

Six thousand five hundred dollars in a meeting

inside the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City.

ALVARADO said he in Mexico

go to Cuba for sabotage training. He names

three other members of his organization in Ni

Carlos FONSECA Amador. Questioning-of ALVARADO

Pursuant to her inquiry, Silvia DURAN received a con-

the Soviet Consulate in Washington

indicating that he had

been long awaiting a visa for himself and his wife to go to

waiting period was sometimes

four or five months

The Ameri

can also had a letter attesting that he was a member of a

pro-Cuban organization but he had claimed that the Cubans

would not give hin a visa unless he had already received a

Russian visa.

Although the American was

still at the Cuban Consulate,

Silvia DURAN repeated

that she could not give him a transit

visa unless

a Soviet visa was forthcoming, notwithstanding

the American's wish

to go to Cuba to wait there for his So-

viet visa. According to DURAN, the American knew no one in

Cuba and

she intended to annotate appropriately the American's

card.

The Soviet official echoed her statement that the

American

was not known.

Cubans, that the problem with him (the American) is that he

Union,

to return to her country, she is going to receive her

visa in Washington but having this visa, she could communicate

to any place this permission, for example here or any place

she could

it (visa or permission), but right now they

Headquarters tells Mexico City Station that the arrest

of Silvia DURAN

is an extremely serious matter which could

prejudice United States Government freedom of action on the

entire question of Cuban responsibility.

With full regard

for Mexican

interests, Headquarters

requests the Station to

ensure that her arrest is kept absolutely secret, that no i

information from

her is published or leaked, that all

such

information is cabled to Headquarters, and that the fact of

her arrest and her statements are not spread to leftist or

disloyal circles in the Mexican Government.

23 November 1963

At 1915 hours (Mexico time), the Mexico City Station

advised the Legal Attache of Silvia DURAN's arrest and of

Headquarters'

desire for secrecy. The Legal Attache had

not heard of the arrest although he had talked to Gobernacion

contacts several times during the last hour. The Station

indicated that it had also

informed the Ambassador.

23 November 1963

Silvia DUPAN was arrested at home with her husband and

members of the family who were having a party.

"*All were

taken to jail. Since she had told not only her husband but

other members of the family about OSWALD's visits after she

read the name and saw his picture on television, she attribu-

ted her arrest to a denounciation by a cousin whom she does

not like. The Station then indicates that the source of the

Mexican Government's knowledge (of her contact with OSWALD)

has not been

revealed to her.

Silvia

DURAN had the impression that OSWALD had or be-

lieved he had made arrangements

in Washington

whereby in-

structions would be sent to the Soviet

Embassy

in Mexico to

issue a Soviet entry visa in a manner which would

not require

him personally to visit the Soviet Embassy. Failure of nis

real or imagined instructions to work smoothly caused him to

become rude to the Soviets. Her impression was that he was

simply a "comrade" who could not live confortably under the

rigors of capitalism and wished to return

to his spiritual

home in the USSR. If OSWALD talked to anyone else in the

Cuban Embassy, she was unaware of it.

[MEXI-7054 (IN 67378), 24 November 1963.1

According

to source,

the staff meeting at the Cuban

The

general impression was one of shock and disbelief.

[MEXI-7115 (IN 69636) , 28 November 1963.1

24 November 1963

Luis ECHEVARRIA told the Chief of Station that Silvia

DURAN was completely cooperative and gave a written state-

ment attesting to two visits by OSWALD. She could not remem-

ber the exact dated but said it was the latter part of Sep:

tember. OSWALD showed her a American passport showing a

long stay in the USSR. OSWALD said he was a communist and

an admirer of CASTRO. He wanted her help to get a transit

visa to Cuba in order to go to the USSR.

She said she could

only arrange transit through Cuba if he already had a Soviet

visa. The Soviets told her that they had further checking

to do before they could issue a visa. DURAN did not know

why he returned to the United States without a visa. DURAN

told Gobernacion that she had recognized OSWALD on the tele-

vision on :22 November 1963.

The Chief of Station has told the Ambassador of DURAN'S

arrest and will brief the Legal Attache at 0930, 25 November,

Luis ECHEVARRIA is aware of the United States Govern-

has warned Silvia

DURAN about talking. He feels, however, that at least the

fact of the arrest may well be leaked by other members of

her family who were picked up at the same time. The Chief

of Station will continue to push the need for secrecy.

DURAN and her husband will be released but will be kept

under close surveillance.

Headquarters asks the Mexico Station that when Lee OSWALD

was in Mexico City in late September and early October to get a

-Soviet visa and a Cuban transit visa, did he want to travel

to Cuba right away, alone, or have his wife join him there

and then leave later? Although it appears that he was then

thinking only about a peaceful change of residence to the

Soviet Union, it is also possible that he was getting docu

mented to make a quick escape after assassinating the Presi-

dent.

of the International Federation of Professional Newspaper

Organization, he was

at the offices of the newspaper Excel-

sior on the night of 25 November 1963. There he learned

through the Mexican press that the Mexican Government had

arrested one Silvia DURAN; that DURAN allegedly had OSWALD

as

guest in her house during his visit to Mexico; that

DURAN placed OSWALD in contact with officials of the Cuban

Embassy in Mexico City. DIAZ Verson went on to cläim that

he was told by Dr. DORRELL Navarros, an exiled Cuban news-

paperman employed by Excelsior that OSWALD and DURAN on the

day following OSWALD's arrival in Mexico City went to a res-

taurant called the Caballo Blanco or possibly the Caballo

Bayo where they met an official of the Cuban Embassy. DIAZ

Verson claimed he knows nothing about OSWALD and the Cuban

official leaving the restaurant together in a car.

the action of

the Mexican police in questioning an employee of the Cuban

Consulate in Mexico City about OSWALD's reported application

for a Cuban transit visa during his visit.

In its note, the Cuban Government had charged that its

Consulate's employee, Senora Silvia DURAN, had been detained

by the police on 23 November, held in prison until midnight,

physically mistreated, and subjected to insinutations about

alleged "intimate relations" with OSWALD.. The Cuban note

said that this "illegal" investigation corresponded to the

plan

of reactionaries. in the United States

who were using

President

Kennedy's assassination to promote a war policy on

the bases

of

accusations against Cuba and the Soviet Union.

Alleging that the Mexican police actions had disregarded the

owed to employees of

the Cuban

note concluded that the incident had damaged the

friendly relations between

11 January 1964

On 11 January 1964, Dr. Eduardo BORRELL Navarro Was

interviewed in Mexico City by a confidential source. He

made the following statements regarding Salvador DIAZ Ver-

son's allegations concerning Lee Harvey OSWALD.

Salvador DIAZ Verson Was in Mexico City as he claimed

and did discuss Lee OSWALD with BORRELL and other Cuban

exiles. BORRELL did not tell the story credited to him by

DIAZ Verson concerning the visit to a Mexico City restaurant

by OSWALD and Silvia DURAN. BORRELL had never heard this

story

or any similar story before.

BORRELL knew of no meeting between OSWALD and Cuban

Embassy officials other than the meetings which allegedly

occurred at the time OSWALD visited the Cuban Consulate in

Mexico City.

13 January 1964

The legal Attache in Mexico City informed the Mexico

Station of current problems in the FBI's investigations of

leads pertinent to Lee Harvey OSWALD:

"'a.

FBI Headquarters sent a cable to Mexico stating

that Salvador DIAZ Verson was the

source of the

ana-

lysis prepared by Cuban psychologist, Jose I. LASAGA

of Miami.

"b.

FBI interviewed DIAZ Verson who said that Silvia

DURAN took Lee OSWALD to Caballo Bayo Restaurant near

Chapultepec Golf Club where they met Cuban Ambassador

to Mexico,

Joaquin HERNANDEZ Armas.

Then HERNANDEZ

took OSWALD for a ride in his car so that they could

talk privately.

"c.

DIAZ Verson told the FBI his source was Eduardo

BORRELL Navarro, Mexican newspaperman who writes edi-

torials for Excelsior.

The FBI

sent Matthew CRAWFORD to interview BORRELL

Navarro on 12 January.

Latter said he did not know any

more than that OSWALD had been to

Mexico and had visited

the Cuban Embassy and Silvia DURAN.

He said everything

he knew had been published and was public knowledge.

On 17 January 1964, a source who has furnished reliable

information in the past advised that he had been unable to

locate a Caballo Blanco Restaurant in Mexico City, but stated

that there is a Caballo Bayo Restaurant located on the out-

skirts of Mexico City. He advised that on 11 January 1964,

he exhibited photographs of former Cuban Consul Eusebio AZCUE

Lopez, who was in charge of the Cuban Consulate at the time

of OSWALD's visit

there, of Cuban Ambassador Joaquin HERNANDEZ

Armas, of Silvia DURAN, and of OSWALD to employees of the

Caballo Bayo Restaurant and had conducted extensive interviews

of these employees. The source said he was unable to find

anyone among

the employees who could

recall any of the persons

whose photographs were exhibited as having been at the restau-

rant.

29 January 1964

DIAZ Verson, the source of Jose I: LASAGA's information

that the Cuban Ambassador to Mexico City had a long conference

with Lee OSWALD at a restaurant outside Mexico City, turns out

to be a highly unreliable source, with a reputation for fabri-

catior. He did go

to Mexico, via Guatamala and Nicaragua,

leaving

Miami

on 18 November 1963. He was to attend

a confe-

rence in Mexico of the FIOPP (Federacion Internacional de

Organizaciones de Periodistes Professionales) between 19 and

29 November 1963.

The FBI has questioned DIAZ Verson about his story.

He

said that Silvia DURAN, clerk of the Cuban Consulate in Mexico

City, took Lee OSWALD to the Caballo Cayo [sic] Restaurant

near Chapultepec Park where they mat the Cuban Ambassador

Joaquin HERNANDEZ Armas and that HERNANDEZ Armas took OSWALD

for a long ride in his car so he could talk. DIAZ Verson said

that his source for this information was Mexican journalist;

Eduardo BORRELL Navarro, editorialist for the large conser-

vative daily Excelsior, but when the FBI

asked BORRELL about

it he said that DIAZ Verson had made it all up.

BORRELL

said he knew nothing beyond the fact that OSWALD had been in

Mexico, had visited

the Cuban Embassy and talked to Silvia

DURAN.

A senior FBI official in Mexico, Clark ANDERSON, told

our Station Chief that he knew DIAZ Verson well wehn they

were both in Havana and that DIAZ Verson was noted for "re-

ports based on his intuitive feelings".

He rarely reported

facts.

This seems

to discredit completely the story that OSWALD

had had a long conference with the Cuban

Ambassador in Mexico

City.

Salvador DIAZ Verson was interviewed by Special Agent

of the Federal Bureau of Investigation at Miami, Floride,

on 27 February 1964, at

which time DIAZ Verson furnished the

following information:

"DIAZ Verson resides at 8770 S.W. 21st Street, West-

chester, Miami, Florida.

He is a Cuban exile, for-

merly associated with the Cuban police in 1933, Chief

of Cuban Military Intelligence Service during the

period 1949 to 1952, but primarily a newspaperman by

profession.

"He had been previously interviewed by a Special

Agent of the FBI

on January 4 and 9;

dates he furnished the data which he had

while attending a Congress of the International

Federation of Professional

Newspaper Organizations

(FIOPP), in Mexico City, from November

20, 1963 to

November 29, 1963.

"He stated he knew absolutely nothing first hand

concerning the visit of Lee Harvey OSWALD to Mexico

He stated

as previously reported, that he did have

Navarro,

employed by the Mexican newspaper Excelsior,

stated he did not

BORRELL Navarro the information regarding the contact

Of OSWALD with Silvia DURAN, an employee of the Cuban

Consulate at a Mexico City restaurant.

"DIAZ Stated the only contact of OSWALD discussed by

him with BORRELL Navarro was that of the visit of

OSWALD to the Cuban Consulate in Mexico, and the fact

that Silvia DURAN was picked up and interviewed by the

Mexican police.

He said there was some speculation

and talk regarding the identity of the specific offi

cial of the Cuban

Consulate or Embassy with whom DURAN

may have placed OSWALD in contact.

DIAZ Verson stated

Dr. BORRELL Navarro never stated

that OSWALD went to a

restaurant in Mexico City called

the Caballo Blanco or

possibly

met an official of

the Caballo Bay thwhere OSWALD and DURAN

DIAZ Ver-

son stated he did

not discuss with BORRELL

agust, in the house of Sil-

via DURAN while he was in Mexico.

"DIAZ Verson stated the matter of OSWALD allegedly

meeting with DURAN at the restaurant and allegedly be-

guest in her home,

were strictly unidentified

questions, comments, and the voicing of thoughts. and

by the FBI in Miami,

Verson and asked:

'Just what were those details about

OSWALD meeting DURAN in some cabaret or restaurant in

Mexico City and the introduction of OSWALD to an offi-

cial of the Cuban Embassy?'

FERNANDEZ Varela admitted

he had not understood the

story too well and

had confüsed it

'a little' when he retold it.

"On February

29, 1964, upon being further interviewed

During a meeting with his agent handler, LIRING/3

stated that "he was doing his best to keep active cer-

contacts he had had in the past that were on the periphery

of the official Cuban circle. He mentioned specifically

the case of Silvia and Horacio DURAN . ... He related that

Silvia DURAN worked as a receptionist at the Consulate in

1963-1964 and was on duty when Lee Harvey OSWALD applied

for a visa.

She had been recommended to the Cubans by Teresa

PROENZA, the Press Attache from 1959 until 1962.

LIRING/3

described Teresa PROENZA as a Cuban woman aged about 52, a

Lesbian, and

a member of the Communist Party of Cuba, who

was currently in jail in Cuba as the result of a conviction

for espionage on behalf of CIA. LIRING/3 recalled that dur-

ing his last visit to Havana, a friend of his in the Minis-

try of Education, informed him of Teresa PROENZA's present

situation and advised LIRING/3, in the event he was asked,

he deny that he had known Teresa PROENZA or had had anything

to do with her. LIRING/3 continued that just the other day

Silvia DURAN had telephoned him to say hello and that he had

visited her at her home to renew his acquaintance.

and had

gone out with him several

times since she liked him from the

start. She

admitted that she had

sexual relations with him

but

insisted that she had

no idea of his plans.

When

the

news of the assassination broke she stated that she was im-

mediately taken into custody by the Mexican police and in-

terrogated thoroughly and beaten until she admitted that she

had had an affair with OSWALD. She added that ever since

then she has cut off all contact with the Cubans, particu-

larly, since her husband Horacio who was badly shaken by the

whole affair, went into a rage and has forbidden her to see

them. She added that she felt certain that her telephone

was tapped by the Mexican police, or, more probably by CIA,.

since tapping was an expensive proposition and the Mexicans

wouldn't be able to afford it for so long a period.

ROWTON (P), LIRING/3's agent handler, counseled LIRING/3

against further contact with the DURAN's on

the ground that it

might

put him under some sort of suspicion whether in the eyes

of the Mexican police or the Cubans.

It may be that OSWALD feared that any attempt to extend his

Documents on Lee Harvey OSWALD Furnished by the Soviet Govern-

(DDP 4-1764]

The Soviet documents forwarded to this Agency under your letter of 20

May 1964 provide some

additional detail on OSWALD:

The information in

these documents parallels that already available from other sources,

does not contradict

our previous information.!: The

documents do clarify

somewhat OSWALD'S

alleged occupation

original Russian terms used in decsribing his job.

12.

The following points relating to the documents are worth noting:

A significant omission from the materials provided is the letter

OSWALD allegedly wrote to the Supreme Soviet requesting Soviet citi-

zership.

OSWALD signed a receipt in 1960 for his Identity Document for

Stateless Persons,

and a second receipt in 1962 for his Identity

Document for Foreigners.

The similarity of wording of the receipts

regarding his understanding of Soviet residence and travel regula-

tions further supports our

belief that such regulations are

identical

or nearly identical for bearers of either type of identity document.

This means that OSWALD should have obtained permission in July 1961
