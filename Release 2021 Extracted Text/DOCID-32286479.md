I. BACKGROUND

Residence

CG T-l advised that he has not observed GIANCANA

at or near the vicinity of his residence at 1147 South Wenonah,

Oak Park,

Illinois,

since he was incarcerated in the Cook

County Jail June 1, 1965. U

CG T-1 is in such a position that he observes

at the residence of GIANCANA practically on an hourly básitivity

during the day and evening hours and would be expected to see

GIANCANA should GIANCANA be at his residence.U

II!, TRAVEL

CG T-2 advised that he had caused investigation

to be conducted in the Grand Bahamas concerning the possibility

that SAM GIANCANA has visited there. CG T-2 advised that a

source of his contacted a usually reliable source who, when

shown GIANCANA's photograph, immediately identified him to

be NICKY MANCUSO also known as JOHN WILLIAMS.

According to

this source, GIANCANA was at Freeport in the Grand Bahamas

in approximately March, 1968, and at that time was using the

name of JOHN WILLIAMS,

staying either at the Lycayan Beach Hotel

Or

the Kings Inn. This source, an ex-Chicago Police Officer,

had conversation with GIANCANA at thi Kime and is quite certain

of his identification of GIANCANA.C

CG T-2 advised that inasmuch as hotels at Freeport

do not keep files of their guest as far back as 2 months, no

corroboration

of. the visit of GIANCANA in the Grand Bahamas

was possible

*vised that steps have been taken to insure

that GIANCANA's name is being placed before the Director of

Immigration of the Grand Bahamas with a view to having

declared undesirables.
