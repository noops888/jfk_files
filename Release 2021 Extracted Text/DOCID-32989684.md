Attached is a memorandum from Michael E. Shaheen Cla

The memorandum

instructs the Bureau to provide access to the House Select Com

mittee Staff Members to the Kissinger 17 material which was

previously made available for review by the Senate Select Com-

This material is exclusive of logs pertaining to

electronic surveillance matters.

Upon receipt of attached memorandum, SA Paul V. Daly

of this Division telephonically contacted Steven Blackhurst,

Assistant Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination in the

Department, and advised Blackhurst that the instructions insofar

as allowing the House Select Committee Staff Members to take notes

on the materials and remove these notes without screening py bureau

personnel back to their offices was contrary to the agreement set

Iorth in the Deparcmental letter to the Senate Select Committee of

July 15, 1975.

This letter required prior Bureau screening of

notes taken by Staff Members during their review of the afore-

mentioned material. Blackhurst subsequently advised SA Daly that

the Committee was

agreeable to having their notes screened by

Bureau personnel prior to their removal to their offices.

Blackhurst was then informed that inasmuch as this involved the

State Department and the White House, the Department should ad-

vise the appropriate representatives

of the White House and the

State Department of the aforementioned matter, especially in view

of information furnished by the Committee indicating that Secretary

State Henry Kissinger would be testifying in executive

session

before the House Select Committee

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams

RE: HOUSTUDY

On 10/30/75, Shaheen telephonically advised SA Daly

that the Committee representatives were on their way with

Blackhurst to Bureau space to review the Kissinger 17 materials

and that Daly was to advise Blackhurst that the Attorney General

had instructed the Committee not be granted access to the materials.

Upon arrival, Staff Members for the House Select Committee John

Atkisson and

Timothy Oliphant were advised of the Attorney General's

decision by Blackhurst.

Oliphant promptly consulted with Committee

Counsel Aarron Donner and Donner advised Blackhurst that the Com-

mittee was considering issuing subpoenas for the material and

would hold a press conference concerning the Department's noncomp-

liance with the Committee request.

Blackhurst indicated to SA

Daly that he was not fully cognizant of the background concerning

the Attorney General's instruction; however, apparently the White

House had instructed

the Attorney General not to make the material

available. He stated that he had informed the White House of the

aforementioned

request and their compliance thereof early on the

morning of October. 30th and that the White House had apparently

telephoned the Department objecting to making the material avail-

able.

Subsequently, Blackhurst telephonically advised SA Daly

that the Attorney General had reviewed the motion to modify the

Protective Order covering the Kissinger 17 documents which was

filed on October 28, 1975, and signed by the Judge on October 29,

1975, which allowed

for House Select Committee access to the

documents protected by a Protective Order which was issued by

that court on June 28, 1975, with the exception of electronic

surveillance logs.

The Attorney General after this review in-

structed that the material be made available.

RECOMMENDATION:

For information.

20530

Dear Mr. Levi:

OCT 2 3 1975

O.L.A.

One of the objectives of this Committee is to establish

the cost of domestic intelligence,

This letter is to request

that you provide FY 76 budget numbers (dollars and manpower)

concerning intelligence activities and intelligence related

activities within your Department. Should this kind of data

not be readily available, by Department, Bureau, Administration,

etc., your best estimate and an explanation as to how the

computations were made will suffice. We have a good deal of

budgetary data re: FBI, DEA, etc. already.

however, it is in

a format that does

not readily lend itself to isolating intelli-

gence activities per se, hence this request.

should there be any questions regarding this matter, Roger

Carroll of this staff, at 225-9751, is available for more

details.

We would appreciate your response by October 31, 1975.

Sincerely,

A Shack For

Mr. Hersimas. i chial, ie, in face, thay have participase

Mc. Dellums, Does your information indicate that it is

clearly crue thai noc all of the warrantless viretops thai ind

telephone company is avare of o5 perhaps even participated in

weire reported to the appropriate authorities?

Mc. Hershman. I think chat the mosü glaring avidence of

this is fron, of course, the Illinois Ball System, where

through theis policy they do noi caport finds of illegal

devices to law enforcerent.

I want to say that during the course of the National

Wiretap Conmission's business we had many allegations thac che

telephone company haj. cooperated nich law enforcement though-

out the country in instituting illegal wiretaps or buggings.

It has been the case, howaver, that we have only been able to

document individual telephone copany repairman or linesmen

having cooperatel and in nost of these instances that have

come to light, they lave been the subjaci of prosecution.

I believe that the instance discused here today with regai

to Rouston is still, under Grand Juzy investigatich. He will

have io wait and see how that turns out, I suppose.

nartain types of investigations - national security, the

crimes enunerated in tne doc, but I think thac even with safe-

sunrês, eleccronic surveillance is a dirty businass.

To think that the only agenoy chorcerea by this Congress

and this is the only Congress we have . to investigate those

violations has to vorry with a small unit with migratory birde

and antiurase, and so foren, is pretty sad. That is what I

Enclosed for your approval and forwarding to the

HSC is the original of a memorandum with enclosures which

constitutes this Bureau's response to a request contained

. in

HSC letter dated September 9, 1975.

The subject matter of this particular request concerns

information contained in FBI files relating to an alleged

Interception of Conmnications violation which possibly occurred

in 1972. House Resolution 591, which created the HSC, apparently

restricts its authority insofar as an inquiry is concerned

to intelligence operations.

In view of this mandate, it would

not appear appropriate for the HSC to inquire into possible

criminal violations referred to this Bureau such as the subject

matter of HSC inguiry set forth in referenced letter of

September 9, 1975. It is requested that the Department make

a determination as to whether the enclosures should be furnished

to the HSC. A copy of this memorandum with enclosures is

being furnished for your isrands.

PURPOSE:

To recommend that the Attorney General (AG) be

furnished at his request a list of*targets of Bureau

electronic surveillances conducted during the years 1970-1975,

indicating which surveillances had been made a matter of

public record, for the purpose of enabling the AG to decide

whether or not to accede to House Select Committee (HSC)

request for a list of such targets.

REC-114

DETAILS:

62-1164677341

On 8/19/75, HSC requested by letter a list of

all Bureau electronic surveillances conducted by this Bureau

during the period 1/1/70 through 6/30/75, accompanied by

documents provided the AG authorizing these operations.

No action was taken upon this request until such time as

the White House restriction upon furnishing classified

information to the HSC was lifted. When this restriction

was lifted, the AG agreed to this Bureau's furnishing the

HSC with copies of documents showing AG authorization for

all such installations, which documents

were to be excised

the tate reparation ot these documents celestated a

the excising and Xeroxing of approximately 1,650 packets

material, some of which have alreadylen furnt sheaz thet is 1975

and thes remainder will be furnished the HSC by 10/24/75.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re: Houstudy 75

62-116464

On 10/10/75, Congressman Robert McClory, HSC

Member, along with representatives of the HSC Staff, were

briefed in general terms by representatives of the Intelligence

Division concerning the manner in which Bureau electronic

surveillances were conducted., On 10/15/75, the HSC by letter

(which the Department advises was personally approved by

Representative McClory) modified their letter of 8/19/75 by

limiting theirrequest to a list of all electronic surveillances

conducted by this Bureau against "domestic targets" during

the period 1970-1975. This latter request for the specific

identity of such targets was appealed to the Department in

view of the AG's prior decision to furnish the HSC only

with supportive documents relating to these operations,

appropriately excised so as not to identify the target.

On 10/20/75, Steven Blackhurst, Assistant Special

Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, Department of Justice,

advised that the above matter had been taken up with the AG

who requested that, prior to making a decision as to whether

or not to accede to the latest HSC request, he desired

this Bureau to furnish him with:

1. A list of all United States citizens and

organizations which were the subjects of Bureau electronic

urveillance during the period in question where there wa.

no Indication of foreign contacts and indicating whicl

surveillances had become public knowledge, and

2. A list of all United States citizens and

organizations which were the subjects of Bureau electronic

urvelllance during the period in question in which foreig

ontacts were involved again indicating which surveillance

had become public knowledge.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re: Houstudy 75

62-116464

OBSERVATIONS:

Surveillance against "domestic targets" wherein

there is no indication of foreign contacts has been

prohibited by the Keith Decision in 1972 and, consequently,

no such surveillances were conducted by this Bureau after

that date. There is attached in response to the AG request

three lists setting forth the identity of United States

citizens and organizations which were the targets of Bureau

electronic surveillances during the period 1970-1975. In

addition to the above two requested lists, it was deemed

advisable to furnish the AG with a third list identifying

those surveillances which are currently in litigation, as

well as similar surveillances which could be affected by

the outcome of such litigation, às it appears that a court

ruling in such matters will eventually involve a decision

as to the extent of foreign contacts, if any, involved in

these operations.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the attached three lists of Bureau-conducted

electronic surveillances of United States citizens and

organizations conducted during the years 1970-1975 be

provided the AG in accordance with his above-stated request.;

FBI Relationships with the Senate and House Select Committees

STIFIN

Senate Select Committee

FBI relationships with the Senate Select Committee generally

have been harmonious with responses to the Committee requests

delivered promptly.

When difficulties have occurred they

have been overcome

by negotiation and tolerance on both sides.

Future difficulties that may be confronted and require similar

resolution include the scope of any public hearing regarding

electronic surveillance of foreign nationals or their agents

and establishments.

#MDR1G

House Select Committee

In the past the FBI has experienced the following difficulties

with the House Select Committee:

(1) It has held public hearings which were orchestrated

to present adverse views without an opportunity for

prepared rebuttal, such as occurred on October 9, 1975,

regarding electronic surveillance matters;

(2) It has demanded delivery of documents on unreas-

onably short notice considering the time necessary to.

locate and prepare for deliverythe enormous quantity

of documents called for;

(3) It has interviewed employees, former employees

and confidential sources of the FBI without first

advising the FBI of the proposed interview and has

demanded the appearance of agents below the policy-

making level.

A large number of documents dealing

with electronic surveillance

conducted without a warrant between 1970 and July 30, 1975, were

furnished to the Committee on Friday, October 10, 1975. Certain

excisions in these documents were made and it remains to be seen

whether the Committee will accept the determinations made as to

what types of information, e.g., identities of subjects who were

monitored, should have been excised.

The overriding concern for the future is the need to establish

an understanding on both sides of the policies to be followed by

each in responding to the Committee's mandate.

General agreement

to specified operating procedures would alleviate the suspicion

on the part of the Committee and the fear of Committee feesponsi-

SUBJECT: HOUSTUDY 75

Telephone Rm. _

On October 9, 1975, pursuant to a request of the Committee, less

Supervisor James Kraus, of the General Investigative Division, appeared

as a witness to testify concerning the Bureau's work in interception of

communications investigations. Also appearing as witnesses were Anthony J. P.

Farris, former United States Attorney; Anthony V. Zavala, former Houston

Police Department officer; Michael J. Hershman, former Chief Investigator

for the National Commission for the Review of Federal and State Laws

Relating to Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance; and Martin L. Kaiser,

the owner of a corporation which specializes in the development and manufacture

of electronic surveillance and counter-measure equipment.

Efforts were made on the evening of October 8th, with the prior

approval of the Deputy Attorney General, to substitute a Bureau official

for Mr. Kraus as the Committee witness, however, the Committee refused

to agree to such substitution. Assistant Director Gallagher and I accompanied

Mr. Kraus and during the course of the testimony Mr. Kraus consulted with

me concerning appropriate responses. On my recommendation, Mr. Kraus

advised the Committee that his appearance had been required by the Committee

in the face of the Bureau's offer to provide testimony by Bureau officials, and

further that Bureau officials were available to respond to the Committee

questions. Again, the Committee rejected that offer. As explained at the

conclusion of the hearing by Chief Counsel A. Searle Field, the Committee

intentionally called a Unit Chief in order to have his testimony as to the

operations of the unit which specifically supervises lOC investigations.

I prepared a memorandum to the Attorney General protesting the

Committee's procedures and upon its approval it was hand delivered on the

evening of October 9th to the Department. On the morning of October 10th,

I was called by Douglas Marvin, Executive Assistant to the Attorney General,

STATEMENT OF ANTHONY J. P. FARRIS,

Former United States Attorney for the

Southern District of Texas

Before the

Select Committee on Intelligence

October 9, 1975

Mr. Chairman, my name is Anthony J. P. Farris, and I

am

an attorney with Farris, Pain & Horne in Houston. From

February 14, 1969 to December 30, 1974, I served as United States

Attorney for the Southern District of Texas, with the principal

office in Houston. The District, is the eighth largest of the 94:

I understand I am here to testify about allegations of

illegal electronic surveillance by local law enforcement authorities

in Houston, Texas, about the lack of aggressiveness by the FBI

in investigating those allegations, about allegations that the

FBI and DEA had known about illegal electronic surveillance by

Houston Police Department officers and neither investigated them

nor reported

them,

and about allegations that both FBI and DEA

agents had either participated in illegal electronic surveillance,

or at least witnessed it.

These matters first came to light when the IRS commenced

an investigation of a big-time heroin dealer in Houston in 1971.

That investigation led the IRS into an investigation of illegal

electronic surveillance by certain members of the Houston Police

Department.

The latter investigation commenced in September of

1972 and resulted in indictments of nine officers in May of 1974.

When the allegations of Houston Police Department illegal

electronic surveillance began to surface in the late summer and

## Page 93

early fall of 1973, my chief assistants and I commenced commun-

ication with the FBI in Houston about these possible violations

and started to send material to the FBI. Allegations then

commenced about participation in illegal electronic surveillance

by the FBI and DEA. In preliminary and pretrial hearings in

the case of U.S. vs. Dudley Clifford Bell, Jr. in November of

1973, counsel for Defendant alleged. that the FBI Special Agent

in Charge knew about the Houston Police Department's illegal

activities and did not investigate them. He also alleged that

electronic eavesdropping equipment had been sold to a named FBI

agent in Houston and that federal funds had gone to the purchases

of equipment for electronic surveillance purposes by local law

enforcement entities.

I sent a copy of that transcript to the

FBI SAC in Houston sometime in the fall of 19.73 and to Washington

in 1974.

The District Attorney of Harris County (Houston) sent two

of his assistants to discuss allegations of illegal wiretapping

with the FBI SAC in Houston in the fall of 1973. In short, the

FBI in Houston had information before them of probative value

of allegations of illegal electronic surveillance by local and

federal authorities in the fall of 1973.

The investigation being conducted by the IRS in the fall

of 1973 resulted in indictments of seven Houston Police officers

and two former police officers in early 1974. From late 1973

until early 1974 I attempted to keep the same IRS agents on the

investigation of the Houston Police Department with the idea in

NW 65994 Docld:32989684 Page 93

---

## Page 94

- 3 -

mind that it was really an on-going investigation. Commissioner

Alexander denied that request through his assistants because the

IRS is chartered to investigate only Title 26 matters. From late

1973 to April, 1974, my chief assistants and I continued to

communicate with the FBI in Houston relative to the Houston Police

Department electronic surveillance and we did so by telephone,

in person and in writing. In April, 1974, we sent a lengthy

letter with exhibits to the FBI SAC in Houston and

asked him

formally, firmly and in

writing to commence his investigation if

he had not already done so. A copy of this lengthy letter and

copies of the exhibits were sent to the General Crime Section in

the Department of Justice in Washington. The FBI only saw fit to

assign one agent to this complex investigation of the country's

fifth largest police department. This FBI agent submitted reports

to our office which were notable only in their lack of substance,

to same istent

depth, and consisted (largely)of Xeroxed newspaper articles. We •

continued to communicate in writing, by telephone and in person

with the FBI in Houston urging them to give us something to work

on and my then Assistant Chief of Criminal spoke in blunt English

to the lone agent assigned to this matter: In June, 1974, a new

SAC had taken over in the Houston office of the FBI. Our letters,

memos and phone calls to the FBI in Houston continued unabated,

with copies to Washington, through December, 1974. There was no

noticeable increase in quantity or quality of the FBI reports

received by us. In the latter part of 1974, the new Police Chief,

Carroll Lynn, gave us additional information about allegations of

_ NW 65994 Docld:32989684 Page 94

---

## Page 95

- 4

Houston Police Department illegal electronic surveillance, about

allegations that the FBI and DEA had participated in illegal

electronic surveillance and that the FBI and DEA had known about

these illegal activities and had done nothing about them. i We

passed these allegations on to an FBI inspector visiting in

Houston in late October or early November, 1974 and to. the

General Crime Section of the Department of Justice:

Finally, in Decmeber, 1974, unable to get cooperation from

the FBI in Houston, I wrote a lengthy letter to Attorney General

Saxbe with copies to the Deputy Attorney General, the Assistant

Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division, and to the

General Crime Section recapitulating every point I could think

of and sending

as exhibits copies of all the correspondence with

the FBI, copies of the transcripts of the Dudley Bell hearings

and copies of the transcripts of the recordings made by Chief

Lynn of his own men.

I know of my own knowledge that the investigation of the

Houston Police Department matters, as conducted by the FBI through

1974, would rate one on a scale of ten. I know of my own

knowledge that when there were hijacking and kiunapping cases in

Houston the FBI had brought in many agents from other offices and

I know of no FBI policy that would forbid bringing in agents from

other FBI offices to help out in the Houston Police Department

case. I know of no internal investigation having been conducted

by the FBI of either the type of investigation conducted by the

• FBI of the Houston Police Department or of allegations of illegal

NW 65994 Docld:32989684 Page 95

electronic surveillance by federal officers. I do know personally

that through December 30, 1974, the General Crime Section of

the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice showed very

little interest in the investigation of this country's fifth

largest police department or of the allegations that federal

agents had

actually witnessed illegal electronic surveillance

activities and had done nothing about them.

In closing, I would once again bring up a suggestion that

the FBI bring in agents from other offices to investigate

allegations of illegal activities by local law enforcement officers.

This was first suggested by five U.S. Attorneys, in Arizona in

1973, while meeting with Bill Cleveland of the FBI. Mr. Cleveland

indicated to us that he interpreted our suggestion as an affront

to the

integrity of the FBI. We repeated this suggestion in a

report

to the Attorney General early in 1974 and two of us repeated

it to Clarence Kelley

in New Orleans in September, 1974 at the

U.S. Attorneys' Conference. I personally repeated it to two

committees here in Washington this year and am repeating it once

again now..

STATEMENT OF ANTHONY V. ZAVALA

Former Officer, Narcotics Divi-

sion,

Houston Police Department

Before the.

Select Committee on Intelligence.

October 9, 1975

Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, my name is

Tony Zavala. I want to thank the Committee for giving me this

chance to testify today, and I hope I can help in your investi-

gation. I also hope that by telling you what I know, I can

help other police officers from falling into the same trap

that I did---learning to break laws, and winding up on my way

to prison.

am a

former police officer with the Houston Police

Department, narcotics division. I joined the Department in

1965. I started in narcotics in

1967, where I stayed until

1973, when I was suspended preceeding my indictment in 1974

on wiretapping charges. In June of 1975 I pled guilty to one

count of wiretapping. Three weeks ago I was sentenced to

three years in Federal prison. I begin my prison term one week

from next Tuesday.

NW 65994 Docld:32989684 Page 97

During my work with narcotics at the Houston Police De-

partment I became more and more involved with wiretapping.

The first time was in early 1968, when one of my supervisors

ordered me to monitor a conversation from an empty building in

downtown Houston.

The last time was in 1972, when I monitored

conversations in a narcotics case, where because of the wire-

tapping involved, all charges against the suspect were dismissed.

ENGLOSUR 621/1 464- 32

---

## Page 98

2.

In between, from 1968 to 1972, I was personally involved in

about 35 illegal wiretaps.

Mine was not

an unusual case. Over time, as the twenty

or so narcotics officers I worked with talked casually at

police headquarters, I learned that other officers were. doing

it too--just about all the other officers. I would estimate

that during the time I was there, the narcotics division

conducted somewhere between 700 and a thousand illegal wire-

taps.

Aschnique

And there were other divisions using wiretaps: intelli-

gence, vice, homicide, burglary and theft. Again, I know this

only through the casual talk of many fellow officers at head-

quarters.

But we all talked, every day. We would talk about

our cases---the names, who we were tapping, what we were hearing,

how it

was working out.

And while we talked, members of other agencies---Federal

agencies, like BNDD and the FBI---would walk in and walk out,

and participate in the conversations.

While I cannot point to any one specific conversation.

with any one particular FBI agent, for example, I know that it

was all discussed freely, and that everyone knew what was going

on.

Wiretapping, in fact, became second nature to us all.

• So that the Committee may have some idea of the modus

operendi of tapping in Houston, I will describe our procedures.

When one of us wanted a tap, we would ask one of our supervisors--

a Sergeant, a Lieutenant, or a Captain. If the supervisor

approved, and he always did, he would telephone someone i

NW 65994 Docld:32989684 Page 98

## Page 99

3.

happen to know at Southwestern Bell Telephone Company for

the particular "cable and pair information" we needed for the

tap.

The individual at the phone company routinely

supplied what we needed a short time later. He would call

the supervisor usually; but sometimes he would call back

directly to officers like me.

The "cable and pair" information would include a specific.

location where the tap was to be installed. That information

would be given to another officer who was assigned to actually

install the tap--usually on a telephone pole. Later, the field

officer,

like me, was told he could go ahead and monitor, and

that's what he did.

Sometimes we would lose a tap. That. is, Telephone Com-

pany workmen would discover a tapping device. They would call

us, ask if we had lost the device, and return it without another

word:

The Telephone Company was involved in other ways too. We

used to attend narcotics training seminars.. I did not think it

was strange at the time, but there was always a Southwestern

Bell representative there. He would offer complete cooperation

in our enforcement efforts. Any information we needed, he said,

we could have.

The equipment for these taps was produced by our own police

department. It was manufactured, as a matter of fact, on the

sixth floor of headquarters. That also was common knowledge

among us all, and the Federal men who frequented our headquarters.

I myself have been in that sixth floor facility many times.

NW 65994 Docld:32989684 Page 99

---

## Page 100

4.

The guys who actually installed the taps were well

trained, and the training was always being updated. The

supervisors wanted everybody to be able to install a tap,

but that meant climbing poles, and some of us were afraid

of heights. I remember a Sergeant announcing that a pole-

climbing

school would be started in the department to take

care of that. But it never got going.

Mr. Chairman, I understand the Committee

is interested

in Federal

officers' direct participation in wiretaps. I

heard about many cases from fellow police officers.

But

that is hearsay. I have more direct knowledge.

On one occasion--in 1969--I was assigned by a Captain

to monitor a tap in a drug case. It was a lengthy tap. My

job was to monitor on nights and weekends. One night a fellow

police officer introduced me to several Federal narcotics

agents, two of whom I got to know pretty well, as they kept

coming and going, and listening with me to the conversations

of the target.

Some weeks later the suspect in the case was

arrested--by the Federal agents, incidentally--and afterwards

the three of us were discussing the wiretap at police headquarters.

• My two Federal friends were disturbed because the entire

conversation took place in front of a high ranking BNDD

supervisor.

They said I shouldn't talk about wiretapping in

front of him that way. The supervisor was smiling the whole

time.

NW 65994 Docld:32989684 Page 100

---

## Page 101

5 .

• In 1971, I conducted a wiretap on a narcotics suspect for

about two months. During the whole two-month period I supplied

the content of the tap to a United States Customs agent.

In 1972 and 1973, I worked as a DALE taskforce officer,

during which time my paycheck came from LEAA. In one case I

remember I attempted to obtain legal wiretap authorizations,

through the Federal authorities I was working with. After awhile,

I was told in effect that the "Title III procedures were too

much of a hassle" and that I would have to "do it in another

way." 'I definitely understood the word "it" to mean the wire-

tap I wanted. Later, I did conduct a wiretap in that case,

without going through any.

Title III procedures.

I would like to say also, while I was working with DALE's

Federal men, there were many conversations about my DALE

cases.

It was never said in so many words, but I am sure it

was

understood that wiretaps were being conducted.

As time went on, late in my work with the Department, the

secrecy and the lying became a real burden for me. I wanted out.

I tried several times to get transferred. But it never worked

out. The Feds started to get interested too.

Once, in 1972, the FBI apparently started an investigation.

But in that case our department conveniently knew about it in

advance. One of my superiors told us to "knock off the wiretaps

for awhile; I just got the word from the Feds; a taskforce is in

town ready to arrest anybody it finds wiretapping-even police

officers."

That happened a couple of times.

Mr. Chairman, I have just spoken about some illegal

things involving some people I know. I know

the names. And

I have given the

names to your staff. I have also cooperated

with the United States Attorney in Houston as fully as I know

how. He is continuing his investigation of these matters.

Also, there is now sitting a Federal Grand Jury, before which

I have already testified. I have also been told of the rules

of this Committee concerning accusations of crime. That is why

I have not mentioned the names I know in this public hearing.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will try to answer any questions.

STATEMENT OF MICHAEL J. HERSHMAN V

BEFORE

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE

October 9, 1975

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee.

Thank you

very much for the opportunity to appear before you this morning.

For a period of fourteen months I served as the Chief

Investigator for the National Commission for the Review of

Federal

and State Laws Relating to Wiretapping and Electronic

Surveillance: The "National Wiretap Commission" was established

to conduct a comprehensive study and review of the operation and

application of

the electronic surveillánce provisions of the

Omnibus Crime Bill enacted in 1968.

I would like to direct my introductory remarks to the

problem of illegal electronic surveillance. During my tenure

at the National Wiretap Commission the question most frequently

asked of me concerned the frequency of illegal wiretapping and

bugging in the United States. Although some individuals profess

to have an answer to this question, no one can really know.

The nature of illegal electronic surveillance is such that most

individuals remain unaware of their victimization. Furthermore,

many of those who do discover that they have been bugged or

tapped are reluctant to report it, because of embarrassment,

publicity and a

fear of subsequent investigations. These factors

combine to make it virtually impossible to estimate how much

wiretapping is taking place.

NW 65994 Docld:32989684 Page 103

tal 464-11560

---

## Page 104

- 2 -

However, we do know that illegal electronic surveillance

takes place, and there is evidence to indicate that it has

not substantially declined since enactment of the Federal Wiretap

Act in 1968. The motivations and incentives for illegal wire .

tapping have not significantly changed; illegal electronic

surveillance remains an inexpensive and effective technique to

gather information. In addition, it is a crime in which the

rewards generally outweigh the risks.

Before going further, I would like to put my remarks in

perspective.

Wiretapping and bugging occurs, but certainly not

to the degree claimed by many. We find that most of the individuals

claiming

massive eavesdropping

are in the business of de-bugging,

or selling de-bugging equipment.

Perhaps the most interesting point is that most of the

illegal wiretapping and bugging that takes place in the United States

today occurs in the private sector, and that most of it has nothing

to do with preventing crime. Eavesdropping devices are targeted on

employee dishonesty, on husbands and wives, political information,

industrial espionage, courtship

situations, and illegal police

surveillance.

The significant point is that there is apparently little

attempt by the federal government to curb these invasions of

our

personal privacy, or to curb the multi-million dollar traffic in

spy devices.

The FBI is supposed to be in charge, but the stories

of blatant abuse go on and on.

NW 65994 Docld:32989684 Page 104

## Page 105

A recent case illustrates the point. In 1974, a Florida

man in the middle of a divorce proceeding secreted a tape

recorder equipped with an automatic activator under a night table

in the bedroom of his home and connected the device to the •

telephone wires. When asked about the purchase of the equipment,

the husband stated that after having seen the equipment in a

sales catalogue he "walked into a retail store and bought it."

The automatic activator, a device which allows for self-starting

and stopping, cost $25.00 and the instructions explained how it

should be hooked across the telephone wires and plugged into the

tape recorder.

The tap, which was instituted in order to gain advantage

in a child custody battle, was discovered by the wife who reported

it to the telephone company: The husband was sentenced by a

state court to six months probation.

To give some idea of how

easy and widespread illegal

electronic surveillance is in the United States today, I would

like to report the results of an investigative study just completed

by the Wiretap Commission.

The purpose. of the survey was to

determine the types of electronic surveillance and countermeasures

available to the general public

and to determine the number of

private investigators willing to discuss, even in the course of

a simple telephone request, installing illegal eavesdropping

devices.

115 private investigating firms were contacted, in seven

cities. 42 either offered to perform illegal wiretapping and

NW 65994 Docld:32989684 Page 105

---

## Page 106

bugging themselves or referred the caller to another agency

that would provide the illegal service. Approximately a dozen

firms indicated they would be willing to discuss the subject if

the caller would come in to the office. The remaining firms

indicated that they would only engage in de-bugging. The estimated

costs of bugging or wiretapping ranged from $30 to $5,000, and

suggested methods ranging from simple tape recorders to a closed

circuit I.V.

When we speak of electronic surveillance, we cannot

consider the act without some mention of the tools. There is,

and always has been, a proliferation of devices on the American

market which are readily adaptable to eavesdropping.

Alarmingly, some of these devices are advertised, contrary

to Federal laws, in popular periodicals. The manufacturers

attempt to disguise their eavesdropping potentials by claiming

usages as "baby sitters" and "burglar alarms." Advertisements

read:

"World's Smallest Transmitter

Listen-in on any standard FM Radio

This miniature electronic marvel picks up the slightest

sound and clearly transmits them to any standard EM

radio up to 350 feet away..."

Or

"Wall Hanging Thermometer FM Ixansmitter

which features a transmitter built into a wall thermo-

meter.

Its sensitive microphone picks up all voices

and sounds in a room, transmitting by battery for more

than one week."

These advertised devices are aimed at relatively unsophis-

ticated individuals. Government agencies

have no need for such

NW 65994 Docld:32989684 Page 106

## Page 107

- 5 -

simple transnitters.

When a state or local police department wishes to purchase

electronic surveillance equipment it can solicit the business

of. any one of a dozen manufacturers which build and sell

surveillance equipment to government agencies.

Many state and local police, however, are not authorized

to engage in electronic surveillance. The Wiretay Commission

discoverad a number of

police departments in states without

authorization statutes, that is, without specific laws allowing

for the use of court ordered wiretapping of bugging, who were

purchasing electronic surveillance equipment which could be of

no lawful use to them.

The Commission's review of the sales of ten manufacturers

of electronic surveillance equipment showed that the manufacturers

have left the determination of whether a particular department

or official was authroized to purchase equipment largely up to

the department involved, with the result that a number of sales

of questionable legality have been made.

The reason given by some officials for their possession

of the equipment is not entirely satisfactory. In Dallas, for

example, where wiretapping without the consent of one party is

not permitted, the Chief of Police was quoted as stating that his

departnent used the bugging equipment "to make sure our good

debugging equionent is in working order."

NW 65994 Docld:32989684 Page 107

---

## Page 108

The results of the wiretap Commission's study, which was

conducted by only two people, are certainly interesting. But

they are particularly revealing when contrasted with the results

of a Department of Justice study which was released two days ago.

That study noted that there were only ll convictions last year

in cases it prosecuted under the electronic surveillance statutes.

Privacy invasion, as typified by illegal eavesdropping,

has a chilling effect in our society. Before speaking, many

people weigh the costs of speaking freely against the risk of

the possible word-for-word disclosure of their conversations to

unintended recipients: The comment, "I can't talk over the

telephone," has become the trademark of mistrustful individuals.

One step in restoring the confidence of Americans must be

an aggressive and affirmative approach to enforcing the criminal

statutes against illegal wiretapping. If any one factor has led

to the continuance of eavesdropping it is the failure of law

enforcement - Federal, State, and local - to take the offensive

against this type of crime. The authorities must take the

initiative and prove to the public that they are as interested in

protecting the people's privacy as they are their property:

Thank you.

STATEMENT OF MARTIN L. RAISER

BEFORE THE

SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE

October 9, 1975

Mr. Chairman and Members. of the Committee. My name is

Martin I. Kaiser and I am the president and sole owner of Martin

L. Kaiser, Inc., a Maryland corporation chartered in 1965, which

specializes in the development and manufacture of electronic

surveillance and counter-measure equipment. We presently market

over 300 products and have serviced and continue to service a

large variety of federal, state and local law enforcement

agencies.

Our list of clients includes but is not limited to the CIA, DIA,

Army Intelligence,. OSI, DEA, U.S. Postal Service, Secret Service,

ATE, IRS, Treasury, the FBI and numerous state and local law

enforcement agencies.

In 1975 I received the Baltimore County Distinguished

Citizen Award. I have been hired as a consultant by law enforce-

ment agencies throughout the United States and was recently

commissioned by President

Sadat. of Egypt to develop the electronic

surveillance and counter-measure capabilities for the Egyptian

Secret Service.

In 1968, the Omnibus Crime Bill was passed by Congress and

its passage had a great impact on the manufacture and sale of

• electronic surveillance equipment. Pursuant to this Act, the

manufacture, assembly, possession, and sale of electronic

surveillance equipment was severely restricted. Advertising of

such equipment was absolutely forbidden.

I noticed that there

NW 65994 Docld:32989684 Page 109

6214444-132

---

## Page 110

-2 -

were two types of manufacturers, those who lived up to the '

dictates of the Omnibus Crime Act and those who flagrantly

violated its mandates. I called numerous and glaring violations

deäling with illegal manufacture, sale, advertising and stockpiling

to the attention of the FBI. These types of violations were

clearly revealed by advertisements for electronic surveillance

equipment which were occasionally transparent and misleadingly

disguised as novelty items and which proliferated in both trade

and popular magazines. I would like to call your attention to a

variety of these items, copies of which are included in your

briefing books.

To the best of my knowledge none of the many violations

further action or

which I reported to the FBI ever resulted inpprosecutions. The

advertisements have not abated. In fact, they have proliferated

and the companies are flourishing. While I do not know why the

FBI refuses to enforce the regulations pertaining to electronic

surveillance equipment and enacted by Congress, I can offer this

theory. The FBI investigators do not seem to possess sufficient

Ischna expertise in order to feel confident in bringing cases against

these violators. Therefore, as time goes by it becomes increas-

ingly more difficult for them to prosecute activities they have

During one of my visits to the FBI, I noticed an entire

staff of people intently examining blown up schematic designs

of a pinball machine. They were apparently trying to put together

some sort of case regarding the interstate transportation of

pinball machines to Louisiana. If a similar effort was expended

to insure Bureau familiarization with the components of electronic

surveillance equipment, the illegal traffic in these materials

could be arrested.

I began my relationship with the FBI around 1967 os 1968.

All my correspondence was

sent directly to the FBI. However, the.

FBI

would never correspond with me. Instead, they sent agents

to my factory who selected equipment and made large orders. I

was directed not to send equipment to the FBI, but instead to

sell it to the U.S. Recording Company, a private company located

at 1347 South Capitol Street, Washington, D. C. I informed. the

Bureau that federal law would not allow me to sell to anyone

except bona fide governmental agencies. The FBI agents assured

me my actions were proper and subsequently supplied a stamp to

U.S. Recording which purported to certify on the purchase orders

that the transaction was in accordance with federal law. Subse.

quently, I discovered that U.S. Recording was charging the FBI

a 30% mark-up on the products that I supplied to them. During my

dealings with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, I sold a total

of $100,000 worth of electronic surveillance equipment to the

FBI which was routed through U.S. Recording.

I was recently contacted by a distributorship in Massa-

chusetts which informed me that they had received a request for

my equipment to be routed through ü.S.. Recording. I have provided

you with their brochure which shows that the specific item

ordered is marked up 100 percent by the company in Massachusetts

and will undoubtedly receive a further mark-up at the hand of

U.S. Recording on the way to its ultimate consumer.

I am in the constant process of improving and adding

innovations to my equipment. In order to insure the high

performance of my equipment, I will modify any equipment I have

sold with my latest innovations absolutely free of charge. In

1975, I contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation in order

to have them return equipment purchased from me so that I could

modernize and upgrade the quality of these electronic devices.

The FBI initially denied that they had any of my

equipment. I

consider this action not

only frustrating, but a foolish exercise

of secrecy for its own sake. Eventually, the FBI did admit

possession of my equipment.

In the course of my dealings with the other governmental

agencies to which I have previously alluded, I found myself in

another complex business arrangement. Whenever I would orally

contract to furnish a governmental agency with electronic

surveillance equipment, the written order for such equipment

would always be routed through Ft. Holabird as a U.S. Army order.

There was no indication on the order as to the real purchaser

of the equipment.

NW 65994 Docld:32989684 Page 112

## Page 113

- 5 -

.!

As an aside, while at Ft. Holabird, I noticed that my

equipment was being inserted into a number of imaginative objects,

including but not limited to mattresses, golf clubs and electric

toothbrushes.

In summation, it is clear to me as an expert in the field

of électronic surveillance equipment, that the FBI demonstrates

virtually no interest in enforcing federal laws dealing with

electronic surveillance equipment. This is discouraging to me,

- both morally and financially.

If the Committee is interested, I would be pleased to

demonstrate examples of equipment which I have sold to the

intelligence community.

Thank you.

Dear Mr. Chairman:

1 - Mr. W. O. Cregar

1 - Mr. A. F. Watters, Jr.

This is in response to your letter of Oetober 8, 1975, soliciting

my views and those of my associates concerning the future role of the intel

ligence community. As I indieated to you in my initial response to your

letter, dated October 17, 1975, I appreciate the opportunity to offer my

observations as to the future of United States intelligenca agencies and

activitics insofar as the FBl in concerned. Of course, congressional

assessment of the activities and effectiveness of the FBI and other

members of the intelligence community is not yet complete, und I

feel that it would be inappropriate for me to male specific recommen-

dations for consideration by your Committce at this time. However, I

would like to offer some general observations which relate to the fulfill-

ment of the Nation's security requirements.

I would hope that, out of the current Legislative and

Executive Branch examination of the intelligence agencies and their

propor zole, a consensus could be achieved concerning Presidential

powers in the national security field.

To ansure the future effectiveness of our national security

programs, I believe that the Congress should elearly define the broad

objectives which it expecte should be achieved by the various agencies,

Assoc. Dir.

which function as components of the United States intelligence community.

Dep. AD Adm. - .

As the FBI Dircetor, I accept full responsibility for taking appropriate

is it ny. action te achieve such goals through the estblishment and supervision

Honorable Otis G. Pike

We must have improved communications between the security/

intelligence agencies of the Executive Branch and the Congress, so that the

American public might be assured that the Nation's law enforcement and

national security interests are being protected in a manner consistent with

the policies declared by their elected representatives. We should strive to

establish some form of meaningful oversight of FBI activities so that we may

avoid duplication of testimony and the proliferation of requests for highly

sensitive information beyond that which is absolutely essential. Establish-

ment of a joint Senate-House oversight committee would be an appropriate

mechanism to achieve this objective.

It is my hope that any future determinations by the Congress to

onact statutory safeguards to protect the integrity of the law enforcement

function will not impose undue restrictions on necessary investigations

concerning critical national security matters. We in the FBI desire a

balanced picture to emerge concerning FBI investigations, which, in

addition to calling attention to any weakness in its performance, also

recognizes its accomplishments, and preserves for the FBI the investi-

native flexibility necessary to fulfill responsibilities of ever-increasing

complexity. This flexibility is essential if we are to funetion effectively

as a deterrent to increasing threate to our liberties, both from criminal

elements and the organized, sophisticated clendestine operations of our

potential adversaries in the international environment. In the domestic

security and foreign counterintelligence arens, the maintenance of the

stability of our system of Government and the provention of violence and

disorder are the FBI's primary objectives.

My staff and I would be happy to meet with you at any time

to discuss the future role of the FBI in the intelligence community and the

steps which we might now take to ensure the civil liberties of our people

and the protection of our national security.

sincerely yours,

Clarence M. Kelley

Attached is a letter dated 10/17/75, from Director Kelley to

Congressman Otis G. Pike (New York), Chaïrman of the House of

Representatives Select Committee on Intelligence. This letter is an initial

response to a letter dated 10/8/75 from Congressman Pike acknowledging

his request for the view's and recommendations of Director Kelley and FBI

officials concerning the role of the FBI in the intelligence community.

At some future date, the House Committee plans to report its

findings on the activities of the intelligence agencies to the full House of

Representatives with recommendations for legislation and administrative

reforms. Mr. Pike's request, at face value, gives the Bureau an opportunity

to express in writing its own views of future requirements and needs in

fulfilling Bureau responsibilities in the intelligence field.

The Intelligence Division is in the process of defining our future

needs and requirements in the domestic, security, counterintelligence, and

terrorist fields. INTD internal security and counterintelligence sections are

-prepared. The response will be coordinated with the Legal Counsel Division

and, if approved, will be forwarded to the Attorney General for Departmental

consideration and approval prior to being sent to the House Committee

Re: Houstudy 75

62-116464

Briefing was initiated by Special Agent McNiff

discussing the ground rules under which the briefing would

be given, emphasizing the sensitivity of such information

and suggested the format to be followed, all of which were

agreed to by those in attendance.

Section Chief Branigan then followed with a briefing,

in general terms, of the two proprietaries operated by the

Bureau in the field of national security, and Section Chief

McCarthy similarly followed with a briefing of three

proprietaries operated by 'the Bureau in the field of örganized

crime.

Upon conclusion of the briefing relating to each

operation, HSC Staff Member Hughes asked a number of questions

concerning each which were answered to his satisfaction by

Messrs: Branigan and McCarthy. At no time were any of these

operations identified by name nor were the names of involved

individuals mentioned. Mr. Hughes was advised that material

relating to the proprietaries in the national security field

is classified "Top Secret."

From the nature of the questions asked by Mr. Hughes,

it appears the primary interest of the HSC in this area is

Ithe financial aspects relating to each operation. Specific

questions dealt with the initial and operating costs, source

of funds, arrangements for handling of possible profits,

compliance with Federal and local tax regulations; as well

as compliance with ordinances relating to incorporating,

licensing,

etc.

At the conclusion of briefing, Mr. Hughes stated

he was impressed by the Bureau operations in these areas,

that information furnished him on this occasion would be

given to appropriate HSC personnel on a strict need-to-know

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re: Houstudy 75

62-116464

other HSC Staff Members present a brief resume of the

background and history of this Bureau's involvement in the

field of electronic coverage, including authorization for

use of same, procedures utilized for obtaining warrantless

telephone and microphone surveillances, extent to which this

Bureau has used this technique in the years 1970-1975 and,

in general terms, the type and value of information received

from this technique.

During the above briefing, Representative McClory

interjected several questions concerning the applicability

of Title III as provided by the Safe Streets Act of 1968,

which questions were answered by Mr. Wannall. Inspector

• Hotis

advised Representative McClory that he, Hotis, interpreted

the 1968 Act as an invitation to Congress to draft legis-

lation regarding electronic surveillance which would be

applicable to security-type investigations.

In response to specific questions, Mr. Wannall

also advised HSC representatives that this Bureau has not

engaged in warrantless electronic surveillance of domestic

targets since the Keith Decision in 1972, that at the time

of the Keith Decision this Bureau had 10 or less domestic

targets under electronic surveillance; that all such physical

installations were made strictly by Bureau personnel; that

on occasion arrangements are perfected with telephone

companies for the use of leased lines and that on occasion

such installations are made at the request of other Government

agencies and with the approval of the Attorney General.

Representative McClory then inquired as to the

number of electronic surveillances maintained by the Bureau

on domestic targets during the years 1970 to 1972, and

Mr. Oliphant inquired as to whether or not the Socialist

Workers Party (SWP) was one such target during that period.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re: Houstudy 75

62-116464

Mr. Wannall answered that the Intelligence Division is presently

in the process of preparing material identifying all electronic

surveillances conducted by this Bureau during the years 1970

to 19/5, as well as obtaining excised supporting documents

containing the authorization for each operation. This material

is being furnished the HSC on a continuing basis and it is

it aterial

anticipated the entire project will be completed in the very

near future..

Answers to the above questions, although not

immediately available at the time of the briefing, will be

found in the above material being prepared by this Bureau.

Representative McClory inquired as to whether such

material would include information relating to the Halperin

(one of the Kissinger 17) case. Department Attorney Blackhurst

responded that the Halperin material is covered by a restrictive

court order but he would attempt to see it the court order

applied to the fist, and, II so, he would attempt to have the

court order modified.

Representative McClory also stressed the importance

of prompt replies being made to HSC inquiries explaining that

the HSC Chairman considers a delay in replying as being

synonymous with a lack of cooperation. Mr. Wannall advised

that all HSC inquiries are being handled as expeditiously as

possible and he pointed out that, during the month of

September, 61.4 Agent supervisors out of a total of 130 assigned

point a put that,

to the Intelligence Division were occupied in non-substantive

work matters such as preparing responses to the HSC inquiries.

Inquiries from the HSC representatives then turned,

in general

terms, to areas covering the now defunct Attorney

General subversive list, criteria and purpose of the Security

Index and its successor, the ADEX, and Soviet espionäge in

this country.

Reference is made to HSC request dated August 27, 1975,

for "delivery of all ADEX lists that have been maintained since

January 1, 1973 until the present."

It is also noted on the

occasion of the testimony of Assistant Director E. W. Walsh of

the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) before the HSC on

August 7, 1975, on the subject matter "Budget Inquiry on

Intelligence Activities," pages 1278-1279 of the testimony

transcript indicates that Representative Ronald V. Dellums

inquired "What is the SI?; What was the authority for it?;

Is it still in operation?; If not, when did it end?; Was

operation ever discussed with Congress

or OMB; Did Bureau

budget show funds for operation of SI?"

As the subject matter of both the Administrative Index

(ADEX) and the Security Index (SI) programs are interrelated,

there is set forth below background information concerning these

programs which is believed will be responsive to inquiries of

the SC.

During 1939 and 1940, a custodial detention

list was compiled by the FBI consisting of the identity of

those individuals whose presence at liberty in the United

States in time of war or national emergency would be dangerous

to the public peace and safety of the United States Government.

On June 26, 1940, the Attorney General was advised of such a

List and on March 18, 1941, information pertaining to the

identity and tendencies of individuals on this list was forwarde

to the Department of Justice.

The use of the term custodial

detention list was discontinued on August 14, 1943, and the

During 1945 the SI was

cancelled except for those portions relating to communists,

Russians, and individuals whose nationalistic tendencies

resulted

from an ideological or organizational affiliation

with Marxist groups. On March 8, 1946, the FBI advised

the Attorney General a list was being prepared of all members

of the Communist Party and any others who would be dangerous

or potentially dangerous in the event of a break in diplomatic

relations with the Soviet Union, or other serious crisis,

involving the United States and the USSR. This list was

to be prepared as a result of developments in the internationa

situation during that time period and in light of soviet

espionage investigations then being conducted by the FBI. The

Attorney General was

apprised of this list so the Attorney

General could advise whether such action met with his approval.

As far back as September 20, 1946, the Department of Justice

advised the FBI that a program was under consideration for the

detention of communists in the event of a national emergency

or hostilities between the United States and the USSR through

Presidential Directive which would empower the Secretary of War

m traction that toed t

to define a military exclusion area and would provide for the

detention of persons by the Bureau of Prisons.

During August,

1948, the Department provided the FBI with a Departmental

Portfolio entitled, "Program For Apprehension and Detention of

Persons Considered

Potentially Dangerous to the National Defense

and Public Safety of the United States."

This program estab-

lished guidelines for the apprehension by the FBI of individuals

considered dangerous to the national defense of the United States

during times of emergency.

*to ta machined o

In time of an emergency a

Presidential Proclamation would be issued and brought before

Congress for ratification.

On September 23, 1950, the Internal Security Act of

1950 became a law and with it the passage of Title II concerning

the Emergency Detention Act (EDA) • Title II of the Internal

Security Act declared that when a state of internal security

emergency is proclaimed by the President, he, through the

Attorney General, would direct the apprehension and detention

of each person as to whom there were reasonable grounds to

believe that such person probably would engage in, or probably

conspire with others to engage in acts of espionage or sabotage.

The list, or SI, being maintained by the FBI of those persons

who should be considered dangerous during times of an emergency

was to be utilized to aid in the apprehension and detention

of individuals under the auspices of the EDA. During 1951, a

index is reviewed continuously and on a monthly basis is brought

up to date with names being added and deleted. Once deletions

are made, former lists cannot be reconstructed.

The index

on January 15, 1975, contained the names of 1,537 individuals

and as of August 15, 1975, there were 1,294 names on the index.

As an administrative aid the index currently utilized

by the FBI enables the FBI to remain alert to individuals who

have exhibited a propensity to conduct acts inimical to the

national security and affords the FBI a record of individuals

who would merit close investigative attention pending legal

steps by the President to take further action.

It also

serves as an extremely valuable list of individuals who pose

a threat to the safety of the President of the United States,

thereby enabling the FBI to provide current data to the

United States Secret Service concerning these individuals.

As noted above, the past lists cannot be reconstructed

and the index contains only the names and background information

which would identify individuals listed thereon. For reasons

of privacy and inasmuch as release of information on this

index could adversely affect current operations and

investigations being conducted by the FBI, information con-

tained on the index is not being furnished.

On the afternoon of September 30, 1975, Mr. Joseph Tait

voluntarily appeared in my office and advised me that he had been inter-

viewed by a representative of the House Select Committee on September 26,

1975. The purpose of the interview was to develop information concerning

confidential business transactions between the FBIad Mr. Tait's company

the U.s. hecording Company, Mr. Tait advised that his understanding wa

that his relationship with the FBI was confidential and he so advised the *

Committee representative who responded that it may become necessary

for the Committee to issue a subpoena for Mr. Tait's testimony and

for his records. Mr. Tait requested advice as to what action he should

take in response to demands by the Committee for information concerning

matters regarded as confidential.

I told Mr Tait that the information he furnished me would be

made available to the Department for consideration of action that might be taken

by the Attorney General concerning what appears to be interference with

FBI confidental sources by.

the damage that might be incurred if the records are produced to the

Committee. I also spoke to Michael Shaheen in the Deputy Attorney General's

office, explained to him in general terms the problem of Committee interviews

of confidential Bureau sources, and asked him whether it would be agreeable

for us to present this matter formally with a request that the Attorney Gener al

consider contacting the Chairman of the Committee. Shaheen agreed that the

matter should be submitted.

The information he wanted he knew Mr. Tait

could supply and if you will not cooperate with us and give us the

information, we will subpoena the records of your company.

Mr. Tait advised Mr. Vermeire that he could not give

him the information he wanted and that he should contact the Bureau

any unauthorized person. In reply to my question regarding who

had classified the information, Mr. Tait advised that the Bureau had

classified his records.

Mr. Tait cited an incident that happened probably in

1969 or 1970 which concerned John Matter and a contract with

the Martin Kaiser Company. Mr. Vermeire asked why this deal,

which concerned the purchase of some equipment, was not worked

out through Mr. Tait. Mr. Tait's response was that he thought this

information should be something received from the Bureau and that

he did not wish to discuss the matter.

Mr. Vermeire noted that there had not been as many

contracts with his company since the death of Mr. Hoover and he

wanted to know if he had received all the contracts because ha had

been a close personal friend of Mr. Hoover.

In response to my question regarding his purpose in

coming to the Bureau to furnish this information, Mr. Tait advised

that he had come to the Bureau voluntarily to furnish the information

concerning the interview and to receive some guidance as to what

he should do if he was recontacted by the House Select Committee.

Mr. Tait advised that he stamped the following statement

on all his contract forms:

"This order complies with the provisions of the

Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of

1968. "

Mr. Vermeire mentioned that Mr. Tait had no right to use

this stamp. That the above statement could only be used by a law enforcement

agency, or a law enforcement agent employed by a law enforcement agency.

I called Mr. Cochran in the Laboratory and asked him to

determine whether or not the records of confidential purchases were protected

by the classification Confidential under the executive order including records

maintained by the dealers and also I called Mike Shaheen in the

Deputy Attorney General's office and told him that we had a problem

concerning a confidential source of the Bureau who had been approached

by representatives of the House Committee for interview concerning his

contidential relationship with the Bureau. I told him of the possibility

that the records could be protected by classification, but I asked him if the

Department would be willing to address the matter with the Chairman of the

House Committee on the basis that the Committee staff is interfering

Shaheen said that we have such an agreement with the Senate, but

no agreement with the House Committee, but that he felt that this matter

• should be presented to the Attorney General formally and that the

Attorney General would probably address the matter to the Chairman

of the Committee.

Steven Blackhurst, Assistant Special Counsel for

Intelligence Coordination in the Department, telephonically advised SA

Paul V. Daly of this Division that he had received an oral request from

Richard Vermeire of the House Select Committee that Unit Chief James C.

Kraus be made available for public testimony before the House Select

Committee, Thursday, 10/9/75, the exact time was not specified. Vermeire

stated the topic of the hearings would be the Bureau's investigation of

Interception of Communications violations.

It was pointed out to Blackhurst that Kraus was a Unit Chief

in the General Investigative Division and the Bureau traditionally, as have

other Government agencies, used personnel in a policy-making position for

purposes of testimony before Congressional Committees. It was explained

to Blackhurst where in the Bureau's organization a Unit Chief would rank,

and Blackhurst indicated he was not aware of what the rank Unit Chief conveyed.

It was also pointed out that this was the same issue that had been

presented in the dispute between the State Department and this Committee

concerning who would be appropriate to testify concerning particular matters

and to our knowledge this dispute had not been resolved. Blackhurst indicated

he would communicate to the White House the request of the House Committee

and point out the fact the fact the Committee was calling witnesses to testify

on investigative policy who were not in a policy-making position. He also

stated he would convey this same problem to the Attorney General through

Special Assistant to the Attorney General, Doug Marvin. Blackhurst agreed

that the procedure concerning the designation by the Committee of witnesses

is not acceptable and that he would recommend that the Department and the

White House resist as much as possible this request: 62-111 t

RE: HOUSTUDY

In view of the possibility that our protests may not be

successful and Unit Chief Kraus may ultimately have to testify, it is

believed advantageous to waive the employment agreement of SA Kraus

and the Code of Federal Regulations provisions for purposes of testimony

at this time.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1) That the employment agreement and Code of Federal

Regulations provisions be waived for purposes of testimony by SA Kraus

concerning the Bureau's investigation of Interception of Communications

matters.

2) You will be kept advised of additional developments

conceming this matter.

Subsequently, Blackhurst advised he had talked to a White

regard. They stated they had similarly referred the matter in disputebetween

the State Department and the Committee to State Department to resolve.

Blackhurst requested a letter be written immediately to the Attorney General

setting forth the Bureau's observations concerning this request. A letter

is separately being sent to the Attorney General.

By memorandum dated 10/7/75, you were advised that we

have been requested by the House Select Committee to make avail-

able Unit Chief James C. Kraus for testimony concerning Inter-

ception of Communications violations before that Committee on

10/9/75.

We also advised that we were preparing a letter to the

Attorney General expressing this Bureau's position that it was

not appropriate or desirable for a Unit Chief to testify con-

cerning the Bureau's investigative matters and we would rather

designate another appropriate Bureau official for purposes of

this testimony.

The letter was prepared and delivered to the

Department on 10/7/75.

At his request, Assistant Director John A. Mintz and

Executive Assistant to the Deputy Associate Director Paul Mack

and John Pringle of the General Investigative Division met with

Deputy Attorney General Harold Tyler.

Also present from the

Department at the meeting were Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., Special

Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, and his Assistant,

Steven

Blackhurst. The Deputy expressed concern that if the Bureau o

Department

were to resist the request of the House Select Com-

mittee,

as was requested in our letter of 10/7/75, that the

Committee might escalate this resistence into a matter re-

quiring litigation.

in their refusal to make certain employees available before

that Committee appears to be entered into a situation which

will lead to litigation.

As a counterproposal, Assistant

Director Mintz suggested that it would be appropriate for the

Bureau to attempt through contact with Staff Members of the

House Select Committee to arrange for a substitute witness

and in the alternative arrange to have another Bureau official

accompany Unit Chief Kraus to the hearing.

Tyler

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams

RE: HOUSTUDY

Pursuant to the aforementioned suggestion, SA Paul V.

Daly of this Division discussed this matter with Richard Vermeire

of captioned Committee.

Vermeire indicated that he could not make

a decision in this matter and referred SA Daly to A. Searle Field,

Staff Director for the House Select Committee.

Field, after con-

ferring with Chairman Otis Pike, advised SA Daly that it was not

acceptable for the Bureau to substitute a witness for purposes

of the testimony. He stated, however, the Committee had no

objection to the Bureau sending along another Bureau official

with Unit Chief Kraus.

Field stated the hearing will be held

at 10 a.M., 10/9/75, in Room 2118, Rayburn Bullding,

and that

"peripheral witness."

By this Field explained

that the main witnesses would be Michael J. Hershman, Chief

Investigator of the National Wiretap Commission, former U.S.

Attorney in Houston, Texas, Anthony J. P. Farris, a manu-

facturer of electronic surveillance devices and an individual

who had done wiretapping. He indicated that Kraus would be

asked very few questions and that the possibility existed that

he might not be asked any questions and this is what he meant

by "peripheral witness." It was explained to Field that there

might be some questions which Kraus could not respond to be-

cause they involved ongoing Bureau investigations of other

policy considerations and Field concurred Kraus should merely

so state if such a question is asked.

The aforementioned decision of the House Select

Committee was explained to Special Counsel for Intelligence

Coordination Shaheen and he was asked if the Department was

willing to have someone accompany Kraus to this particular

It was pointed out that there is a

possibility we might get questions concerning current in-

vestigations or other areas in which the Bureau cannot

respond. Shaheen indicated that if there is a question

the Houston Wiretapping matter which is being re-

viewed by the Department, this Bureau should refuse to

respond stating that this matter is currently under review

by the Department and likewise if the question should per-

tain to an ongoing investigation, refuse to respond on that

basis.

and Ellen Miller, Staff Members of captioned Committee, for

conferences with members of the IS-1 Section, Intelligence

given to the Committee Staff Members by Section Chief Joseph G.

Deegan. This overall briefing concerning the work handled by

the Section; namely, black extremist activity, white hate

activity and extremist activity in the American Indian Move-

ment (AIM), was followed by more detailed briefings by

individual Supervisors in the Section. The detailed briefing

included the basis for our investigation of certain organi-

zations and individuals, as well as the present activities

of the organizations and individuals justifying the investi-

gation and an estimate of the membership strengths of the

various organizations.

Memorandum to Mr. W.R. Wannall

RE: HOUSTUDY '75

62-116464

The briefings went rather smoothly and the

only area of extensive questioning by the Staff Members

was the area of extremist activity in the AIM. The

Staff Members requested to be advised concerning allega-

tions of harassment by SAs of the FBI in connection

with investigations on the Pine Ridge Reservation prior

to the killing of two SAs.

The Staff Members were

advised that allegations of harassment were received

by the FBI and were looked into and it was determined

that they were unfounded and, further, that the Agents

on Pine Ridge Reservation, including the Agents who were

killed, were performing their official duties in con-

ducting investigations concerning criminal activities

and persons connected with fugitive matters. When asked

for specific details concerning these allegations of

harassment and the Bureau's answer on each one, the Staff

Members were advised that they should make a request in

writing. They advised that they would do this.

In addition to the above, they asked specific

questions concerning informants, including how many

informants were presently in the Republic of New Africa.

The Staff Members were advised that informants were not

a matter to be discussed in this briefing and that if they

desired additional information concerning informants,

they should also make a request in writing.

ACTION:

For your information.

questzons, there is no information in FET Hoadquarters filos

indicating this Burcau has over providod confidential information

to ITT. The IBI has a normal custoner relationship with both

the telephone company and ITT. ITT has been consulted from time

to time concerning business services and systems which have been

of interest to the FBI.

This has been especially true in the

conmunications field as the fll operates its own extensive

radio and teletype systems.

Additionally, the telephone company

provides leased lines for use in tochnical surveillances all of

which are authorized by the Attorney General. IBI personnel

install and connect these technical surveillances to the leased

lines.

Telephone company personnel are not involved in the

instollation of such surveillances.

The telephone company also

furnishes toll call records upon authorized requests in connection

with ongoing FBI investigations.

Page 1235 of the transcript teotimony contains a

question as to whether the FBI has ever attempted surreptitiously

to monitor the defense efforts of a Federal defendant. Ho.

The EBI Manual of Instructions, Section 107 F 12, & Copy of which

has been made available to the

ISC, contains specific instructions

regarding the procedura to be followed in situations wheré

efforts arg made by defense interests to involve our informants

in s defendant's defense preparations.

Page 1205 of the transcript testimony contains a

question as to whether the FEt,

There is 110

reasonably retrievable manner available to this Dureau short of

to the above question.

To the best recollection of Jureau individuals in a

The Attorney General

Accordingly, on the morning of October 9, 1975, Mr. Kraus

appeared before the House Select Committee accompanied by Assistant

Director Richard J. Gallagher, of the General Investigative Division, who

supervises Mir. Kraus' work, and by Assistant Director - Legal Counsel

John A. Mintz,

As the hearing proceeded, it became reacily apparent that tno

obicctve ol the hearing was to provide a forum for allegations made ly

former United States Attorney Anthony J. P. Farris; Michael J. Hershman,

former General Investigator for the National Commission for the Reylew of

Federal and State Laws Rolating to Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance;

Zavala, former officer of the Narcotics Division of the Houston

Police bepartment; and wartin l kaiser, the sole owner of a corporation

which specializes in the development and manufacture of electronic surveillance

and counter-measure equipment. The point of their combined testimony

was that the FBI was unwilling, as a matter of policy, to undertake appropriate

investigation of violations of the wiretapping statutes. In addition, the

Committee addressed inquirtes to Mr. Kraus concerning administrative

matters and FEI policy which, because of his position, he was not prepared

to discuss.

Though Vr. Kraus offered an explanation to the Committee that he had

been interviewed by Committee staff members and had advised the staff

of the limits of his authority and knowledge conceming FBI activities,

the Committee still had insisted upon his appearance as the FBI representative.

MI. Kraus suggested that other Bureau officials would be more

the committe decline too scent the beer of it a taility o, another

Bureau official. It should be noted that two Assistant Directors were

present with Mir. Kraus and available to respond to any inquiries the

Committee might have addressed to them.

The result of the arrangement enforced by the Committee's

insistence upon Mr. Kraus appearing as the witness was that the Committee

received public testimony containing numerous allegations concerning the

FBI, United States Attorneys, and the Department, but did not afford an

legitimate inquirles to be answered by those officiale in a position to

furnish complete ani accurate statements of polley concerning iroad

Attached is a letter from the Director to the Attorney

General enclosing a letterhead memorandum for delivery to the

House Select Committee dated September: 8, 1975. The attached

furnishes information stating that we have arrangements. to make

income tax payments for sources in certain instances with the

Internal Revenue Service (IRS) .

Since this communication serves

to notify the House Select Committee that IRS might have infor-

mation concerning Bureau informants, that Committee could well

contact IRS and request such information which i

might identify

informants.

The Legal Counsel Division contacted Steven Blackhurst,

Deputy Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination in the De-

partment;

to. determine whether the information concerning the

financial arrangements: made with IRS. be

given the Committee and

what the Department's position would be

if the Committee wanted

the IRS records. concerning Bureau informant income tax payments.

Blackhurst indicated that we should give the financial infor-

mation; however, he asked that the IRS be expeditiously advised

that should they receive a request concerning Bureau informant

tax material they should refer such requests to the Bureau so

that the Department might be appropriately apprised of such a

request. Blackhurst indicated that the Department would resist

any attempt. by the Committee to obtain such material but wante

the Committee to get such records

be sure that he had ample avance notice of any attempt s

GENERAL INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION

Attached

concerns the Interception of

Communications case which our Houston Office

has under investigation regarding alleged

wiretapping activities by the Houston Police

Department.

The UPI news release states that former

United States Attorney Farris said the FBI and

the Drug Enforcement Administration knew about

the illegal wiretaps and did nothing despite

repeated requests for an investigation by his

office.

The article also says he wrote to the

then Attorney General Saxbe and other officials

and talked personally once last year with FBI

Director Clarence Kelley. GID is not aware if

any personal contact with the Director.

It is noted this statement is either a

misquote or is in direct conflict with prior

testimony by Farris before the Subcommittee on

Courts, Civil Liberties, and the Administration

of Justice of the Committee on the Judiciary

on 5/27/75, wherein Farris was asked by Congress-

man Drinan why he didn't

go, to Clarence Kelley.

He replied that he had hope

the people in the

Criminal Division and

General Crimes Section

would do that as t

Chad done in other cases.
