You approved the hiring of Frank Eccles as an

I learned that this would mean that the Kennedy Task

Force would have four (4) investigators to the one (1)

remaining on the King Task Force with the departure of

Jim Chenoweth. I have discussed this with Bob Lehner

and Bob Tanenbaum and they are in agreement that Eccles

should be assigned to the King Task Force. If you have

In view of the departure of several

been interviewed by Cliff Fenton, Chief Investiga-

the Metropolitan Police Department with Jack Mori-

arty, Staff Investigator, who is an outstanding and

extremely talented fellow. Moriarty came to us after

serving 27 years on the Metropolitan Police Force

SUBJECT: Hiring for Position of Staff Investigator.

Frank Eccles was interviewed by me for a position on

staff as an investigator in January, 1977.

Mr. Eccles was an experienced investigator with 12 years

police experience with the Washington, D.C. Police Department.

He is presently self-employed as a licensed private inves-

tigator. In my opinion he would be an asset to the staff

and recommend that he be hired. Mr. Eccles was also inter-

viewed by Deputy Chief Counsel Bob Tanenbaum who concurs

with my opinion.
