report, advised SA JOHN L. PUDDISTER as follows:

He has been treating members of the MANNARINO organization

for about seven years and would gladly furnish information

concerning them and their activities.

Dr. MC CLOWRY, who

is of the Roman Catholic faith, has also been called upon

many times to treat Priests and Nuns, with particular

reference to Mt. St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, Freeport

Road, New Kensington, Pa,, the parish to which the MANNARINOs

belong.

Pastor of the parish, and his

chauffeur 1s JOHN STANISH, who is also a registered nurse.

Both have been Dr. MC CLOWRY's patients at one time or another.

During the period

In late 1958 that a subpoena was outstanding

for SAM MANNARINO's appearance before a Federal Grand Jury,

Pittsburgh, he was being hidden, part of the time, by Father

FUSCO on the third floor of the

Apostulate House for Mt. St.

Peter's Roman Catholic Church, located at 204 Charles Street,

New Kensington.

Dr.

MC CLOWRY has asked Father FUSCO on many

occasions not to assist

his "boys" and that the Federal Government is persecuting

them for things which are quite legal in Italy.

Father FUSCO

attended the coronation of Pope John XXIII, along with his

chauffeur, JOHN STANISH. STANISH has told Dr. MC CLOWRY that

upon returning from Italy, Father FUSCO was met in New York

City by ALBERT ANASTASIA's limousine and that they were

rushed through customs without an examination of luggage.

STANISH said they stayed a few days in ANASTASIA's home and

then returned to New Kensington.

later, ANASTASIA was shot to death in New York City. MC CLOWRY

has said he will furnish medical records on a confidential

basis and will attempt to obtain a photograph of SAM MANNARINO.

In view of the fact that certain information developed gives

some indication that

SAMUEL MANNARINO could be involved in

the cases captioned "STUART SUTOR, et al; TGP; ITSP; NM; FFA

(Bufile 52-72398)" and "BERNARD J.

EZHAYA, et al; ITSP - MT

(Bufile 87-41245)" and may become a subject of one or both,

considerable investigative time has been devoted to them.

In addition, the first named case may be presented for trial

in September, 1959, in U. S. District Court,

Pittsburgh.

This means that Top Hoodlum SAMUEL MANNARINO may be found

to be impleated in two substantive matters within the

jurisdiction of the FBI. Because there is still considerable

investigation to conduct in both above-named cases and

because investigation in those cases in effect constitutes

investigation of the MANNARINO organization, it is felt that

the interest of the Bureau will best be served by concentra-

cion on those cases:

Therefore, UACB and only until Initial

prosecutive action is completed, the Pittsburgh Office will

submit reports in instant matter every ninety days instead

of the usual forty-five days.
