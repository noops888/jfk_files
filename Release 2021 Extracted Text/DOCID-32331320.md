In conversation with the informant, WHITE told

him that JOE STASSI's son, JOSEPH, JR., was arrested because

of a letter which was found in his apartment.

that as yet STASSI has not been caught. It 1s

obvious that WHItE does not know that STASSI was apprehended

several weeks ago in Miami, Elorida.

For some weeks, WHITE has been requesting the

informant to install a gadget on his telephone so that he

will be able to record all of his 'incoming and outgoing

telephone calls. Informant has stalled WHITE, but said that

eventually, at his insistence, he may put the device on his

telephone.

a transmitter, which means that all of

would be broadcast and monitored by the use of the gadget,

as the informant referred to as a

"freak"

• It is pointed

out that the agents did not request this procedure and it

was further stated to the informant that they were not

interested in utilizing a "freak" in order to monitor any

Of WHITE's telephone conversations.

Periodic spot checks of subject's residence during

the investigative period were made by SAS PAUL G. DURKIN and

CHARLES G. DONNELLY.

Information from the NY Telephone Company was made

available by OSKAR G. DANIELSON, Security Supervisor, NYC.

In a separate communication, leads to identify and

Interview subscribers residing in offices not receiving this

report have previously been set out.
