MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director of Operations

SUBJECT:

Messrs. George Bush and Thomas J. Devine

1. Through Mr. Gale Allen, C/CCS/PRG, I learned that

Mr. George Bush, DC1 designate, has prior knowledge of the

now terminated Project WUBRINY/LPDICTUM which was involved

in proprietary commercial operations in Europe. He became

aware of this project through Mr. Thomas J. Devine, a former

CIA Staff Employee and later, oil-wildcatting associate with

Mr. Bush., Their joint activities culminated in the establishment

of Zapata Oil which they eventually sold. After the sale of

Zapata Oil, Mr. Bush went into politics, and Mr. Devine became

a member of the investment firm of Train, Cabot and Associates,

Buses ment "

New York.

2. The attached memorandum describes. the close relationship

between Messrs. Devine and Bush in 1967-1968 which, according to

Mr. Allen, continued while Mr. Bush was our Ambassador to the

United Nations.

Mr. Devine's 201 file shows no operational

involvement after 1968.

30 January 1968

MEMORANDUM FOR: DO/Security

SUBJECT:

Thomas James Devine - 201267708

OS #42069

1. Subject is a former Agency staff employee who resigned in

1953 to go into private business. A CSA was granted DO Division on

12 June 1963 for use of subject in Project WUBRINY operations. Since

this time, he has been used as a cleared and witting commercial asset

under Project WUBRINY. He has proved to be most competent and

trustworthy.

2. Subject is a personal friend and unofficial foreign affairs

advisor to Representative George. Bush of Texas. Mr. Bush recently

requested subject to accompany him to Vietnam. He did so during the

period 26 December 1967-11 January 1968. Prior to this trip, subject

requested the undersigned to arrange for the Department of State (Mr.

Macomber) to be advised that subject's Agency clearance is current.

DO/Security advised the Agency Legislative Counsel, Mr. John Warner,

of subject's clearance, and Mr. Warner advised Mr. Macomber of State.

However, as reported by subject, the Agency acknowledged in an inter-

agency check that information on subject was as of 1953. It became

necesgary for the Department of Defense to issue an interim top secret

clearance on subject to cover his Vietnam trip with Mr. Bush.

3. Subject has asked if the Agency can update his clearance.8o

that he may have a standing top secret clearance status. He expects to

make further trips abroad with Mr. Bush, and feels that a standing TS

clearance would greatly facilitate such trips.

4. Subject's current role in Project WUBRINY is limited to

being a cleared and witting contact in the investment banking firm which

houses and manages the proprietary corporation WUSALINE.

5. The undersigned recommends subject who is the most discreet

and security conscious business contact that the undersigned has met.
