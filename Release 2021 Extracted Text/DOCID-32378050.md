1.

Following Subject's arrival in Habana on 19 Karch 1957, he first

contacted ALPHODARCH-3 (on 20 larch) and set up fresh contact arrangements

betreer AIPHODARCH-3 and cut-out AMANTLOPE to be initiated following

VAIVADA's departure for PBPRIVE.

on 21 Karch, VAIVADA contacted the mother

Of AMPHODAPCH-10 and was inforned that the latter had taken asylum in the

Panamanian Embassy in rabana on 15 larch as a result of the attack upon the

Presidential Palace of 13 Harch.

At a personal meeting held la a secure

location with AYPHODARCH-10's mother on that day,

the latter asked help in

getting ALFHODAP.CH-10 into PEPRIE.

After consulting with the Station,

VAIVADA told the nother that this would be impratical as her son sould have

to personally appear in the Consulate to obtain a visa; she was advised to

toll ALPHODARCH-10 to go into exile in Panara, and fron there to go to Costa

Rica if he so desired under the conditions set out in FKH-A- 3507, dated

4 April 1957, already fortarded to San Jose and to the chief, MHD. At the

sane time, VAIVADA forwarded the sun of $100 to AlPHODARCH-10 through his

mother.

Ice help afforded A!PHODARCH-10 at this neeting was greatly

appreciated, the agent's nother affirming to VAIVADA before their parting

that she felt certain the agent tould cooperate mith us at any time.

Arrange

dents were sade for the Station to contact the mother independently at any

time this appears necessary.

2. In the evening of 21 Varch, after having telephoned to arrange a

T1s1t, VAIVADA net with the sister and niece of A'PHODAPCH-1. The Station had

deterined that VAIVADA should, if possible, broach the problem of payment of

the $1000 authorized at that time, describing it as being back salary due

AMPHODARCE-1, rather than presenting it as a pay-off since the amount, by

Jocal standards and that of an insurance policy premius, tas small.

was well-received by the family and as a result of the visit belleres there is

no possibility that the family is interested in embarrassing him. However,

thing could not be done by the Embassy regarding his murder.

atizenship Officer, after checking the files, told her that as AlPHODARCH_

mas not a citizen and therefore he could do nothing about the matter, the

niece left the Embassy obviously annoyed and disappointed. No further visits

to the Enbassy by AXPHODARCH-l's family have core to the attention of the

station, and no contact has been made with that family.

Efforts are being

nade, with the assistance of the local ODENVY, to identify the killer or

killers of this agont, for the record.

3. On 9 April 1957, the cut-out AVANTELOPE contacted AVTMODARCH3

In addition to a certain

anount of reporting upon student and university events, A'PHODARCH-3'8

principal current task is maintaining contact with AWPHODARCH-6 with a vien

to arranging a personal meeting between A'ANTELOPE and A'PHODARCiS to enable

the Station to check progress of this operation and strengthen our relation-

ship with the latter. Progress in this effort will be reported.
