Letter, to SAC, Washington Field purs

re: NORMAN RAY RUNNION C

PSI - DESECO - R

NOTE: (Runnion is a (journalistlemployed by (UPI Washington, D.C., CS

and is a member of the United Press Club.

He has had contacts

in the past with Soviet correspondents at the United Press Club,

and during a sounding-out interview he was cooperative in furnishing

Durineaus regarding his knowledge of these Soviet officials. U)

During such interview, he also furnished information concerning

Aline Mosby, indicating that when Miss Mosby was stationed in Moscow

with UPI, she was found unconscious and partially disrobed in a

gutter.

He indicated she was jailed overnight at that time and the

incident was mentioned in the Soviet newspaper, "Izvestia." Runnion C

added that it is his understanding that Miss Mosby was examined

at the American Embassy and it was determined she had been drugged.

Our informant in the TOPHAT case advised on 5-14-62 that Soviets have

à source for political information who is a correspondent in the

Washington, D.C., area. TOPHAT indicated this correspondent visited

Russia during

the same period that former Vice President Nixon was in

Russia in 1959.

WFO conducting investigation to identify this unknown

correspondent and is giving consideration as suspects those corres-

pondents who were actually assigned in Moscow during Nixon's visit

there, in addition to those reporters who actually accompanied Nixon to

MOSCow. IS (4)
