MrS. Eve YEASNER, 4943 Rieger St., Dallas, hastrecently

received letters from

her husband, Prt Thomas

PEASNER, RA 18 323 089, POW Camp

(JFK)

Democratic People's Republic of North Korea, which are worthy of note. In a

KSIE

98

letter dated 3 Dec 52, and mailed care of, The Chinese People's Committee for

World Peace, PHASNER requested his wife to join him in his "work in the fight for

do

world peace". After reiterating the need for world peace, the POW asked his t

wire to sit doin and miles letters supporting or requating support of wor ladies

peace, Address then to Senator Tom Connally, President Disenhower, Paul Rokeson:

John Gates (publisher of the New York Daily Worker), and Howard Fast. You may

0s

address Robeson and Fast care of Masses and Mainstream, 832 Broadway, New York, &,&

N.Y., of which magazine they are contributing editors". PEASNER went on to say

"I know that merely as my wife a more than sufficient body of material will present

itself. Express your doubts of the so-called 'benefits' of the Korean war. Think

of how the Korean people are being systematically destroyed. Think of your

personal suffering in an international light, as the suffering of all the wives of

men in Korea, Indonesia, Malaya, etc. And remember who is behind it all. Think

and write from the viewpoint of the working class

NDEXED-74

and I am sure that you will

bring this project to a successiul conclusion as

EX-10 on as possible."

In closing

his letter, PEASNER presented

a rather sordid picture of what. the world might be

like in the event of another world war,

intellectual plane than I do and he doesn't come down to earth much. So because

of that I cannot tell you hardly how he has adapted himself of course, I believe

to be only fair I should not say anything that he might not want to have said."

LUDLUM mentioned a "Jack NOBLE from Cal," with whom FEASNER had been composing

music when he, PEASER, was not "playing cards and reading.". According to

LUDLUM&s letter, Mrs. PEASNER has received about 6 letters from her husband,

which LUDLUM considered about average. The hospitalized POW returnee added,

in closing, "as for him writing articles, I could not say about that. But I'm

sure if he wrote any they were of his own free will".

(Fourth Army) G2 Comment: (Confidential) It appears that PEASNER may

have been subjected to an intensive Communist indoctrination program as a

POW. As his letter contains elements of the CP line, it is possible he may

have fallen victim to the Indoctrination program. It is also possible that

PEASNER may have found it expedient to cooperate with the Chinese authorities

while not actually believing in their principles. Whatever the case, The

Chinese People's Committee for World Pease is probably using PEASNER for

propaganda purposes. ROBESON (Negro), FAST, and GATES are all well known

American CP members. The Daily Worker is the official organ of the American

CP and the Masses and Mainstream (now the New Masses) has been cited by the

House Un-American Activities Conmittee as a CP front publication.
