Miami to furnish a copy of the LHi to INS, noting that the

arrival of FLeltss and other Cubans in Puerto Rico appeared

to be a violation of Immigration laws. Miami was instructed

Puerto Rico without papers, and under an assumed name.

said that FLEITES was granted Indefinite voluntary departure,

In view of the above, it did not appear that inter-

It is noted

that FLEITES has been interviewed on several occasions in the

past, and is not considered to be a reliable person, or cooperative.
