MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Security Analysis Group

FROM

Jerry G. Brown

SUBJECT

HEMMING, Gerald Patrick

OSH. 429

229

copy of a menace is containe the subachten ehich ds

7 November 1960 from Chief/Contact Division/00 to Chief/

Personnel Security Division/Office of Security captioned

"Jerry P. HENNING, JI., Ex-US Marine who served in Cuban

Army and Air Force 00-A-3170536!!

, a copy of which was

sent to WH Division and CI Staff. It is apparent that

the HENNING referred to therein

is identical with Gerald

Patrick HEMMING.

Of pertinence for the purposes of instant memo-

randum is that information contained in paragraphs four

and five of the reference and related by HEMMING voluntarily

to the Contact Division/Los Angeles Office between 11 and

21 October 1960, to wit:

"Henning returned to California in October

1958....He left for Cuba by air via Miami on

..or

about 18. February 1959 arriving in Havana

on 19 February 1959."

"He claimed to have contacted officials

'in the Cuban Consul's office in Los Angeles

prior to his departure."

3.

In substance relative to the

above, the HEMMING

tlle retlects that he served in the U. S. Marine Corps from

19 April 1954 to 17 October 1958.

(The 201 file concerning

HEMMING reflects that he served in Japan with a U. S. Marine

Air Wing.) He then returned to the Los Angeles arca for

discharge and then left for Cuba circa 18 February 1959 and

joined Castro's forces.

4. The pertinence of the foregoing is that Lee Harvey

OSWALD served with a U. S. Marine Air Wing in Japan, and

when OSWALD returned to the United States,

he was assigned

to Santa Anna, California (Los Angeles

area). Extensive

testimony contained in the Warren Commission hearings by

OSWALD's fellow Marines. at Santa

Anna contain the theme

that. OSWALD was

interested in going to Cuba

to join Castro

(upon his discharge) in early 1959 and that in early 1959

OSWALD allegedly made some contact with the Cuban Consul's

Office in Los Angeles.

5.

The above as well as the Office of Security file

concerning HEMMING which is replete with information

Posset linking HEMMING and his cohorEs to OSWALD was

to the attention

of Mr. John Leader (and Mr. Scott

BrecKinridge), Inspector General, on 6 April 1977.

Mr. Leader

advised he would pursue the matter.
