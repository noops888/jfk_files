SA Sammon was asked to identify Intelligence

was Sammon

Department, in a position to advise whether of not

any information furnished by Somerset was disseminated

to that intelligence unit during the period of

1961-1964•

SA Sammon was then queried at length regarding

Ku Klux Klan activity in Mississippi beginning in 1964,

in particular, - information regarding United Klars of -

America (UKA), White Knights of the Ku KLux Klan

of the WKKKK

regarding Klan activities in Mississippi since his

arrival in 1964.

SA sammon was then asked if he had conducted

any investigation regarding

that immediately after the shooting death of Dr. Martin

Luther King, SA Sammon was assigned the responsibility

of traveling through North Mississippi with photographs

of the evidence left by King's assailant, exhibiting

those photographs at motels, service stations, in

North Mississippi to determine if any of the photographs

could be identified.

SA Sammon was asked if he was aware of Somerset's

attempt to assassinate King in Montgomery, Alabama,

in 1958 through poisoning his food.

SA Sammon advised

the committee that he was not aware of any such attempts.

SA Sammon was then queried regarding Bureau

regulations regarding amounts of money paid informants and

policy of the Bureau to overseeing those payments.

SA Sammon explained to the committee that such amounts

are normally determined by the Agent contacting the

informant and are paid on a COD basis based on the value

of the intormation furnished by the informant. SA Sammon

advised that the Bureau oversees these payments only in

an auditing or accounting of the particular informant's

payment fund.

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE

ON ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA)

SA Sammon was then questioned regarding the

Bureau policy in discontinuing informants and if the

informants are advised that they are being so discontinued.

SA Sammon advised that the informant is so advised when

he is discontinued,

usually determined when the informant

has furnished

a lack of positive information, or when

he has exposed himself as an informant, and of course

upon his death.

SA Sammon was then questioned regarding

Somerset's personal involvement in violence;

Somerset's

personal bigotry toward minority races; his bigotry

regarding

union membership; his carrying of weapons;

and Somerset's knowledge, of explosive devices; and

intormation furnished by

Somerset regarding Thomas

Albert "Tonny" Tarrants

To these questions, SA Sammon advised that he

did not have any personal information of acts of violence

performed by Somerset; and that the only personal bigotry

exhibited by Somerset was Somerset's apparent dislike

for SA Sammon, as Somerset felt that SA Sammon was

of Jewish descent. SA Sammon advised that he had no

knowledge of any acts of bigotry in union membership as

indicated by Somerset, nor was SA Sammon aware of Somerset

ever carrying a weapon or Somerset's knowledge of any

explosive devices.

SA Sammon advised the committee that \

regarding Thomas Albert

was acquainted with Tarrants, having been involved in sammon

firearms shootout confrontation with Tarrants in 1969.

The committee pressed for further details concerning

this shootout and the committee was advised that in

August, 1969, Tarrants and two other inmates of the

Mississippi State Penitentiary (MSP), Parchman, Mississippi,

escaped from that penitentiary and were thereafter subjects

of an unlawful flight to avoid confinement investigation,

and were considered by the EBl to be federal fugitives.

the committee was advised that in August, 1yby, Intormatior

was received by the Jackson, Mississippi, Office that the

three escapees were hiding in a heavily wooded dense area

Thereafter, SA Sammon and

many other Jackson, Mississippi, Agents attempted to

locate and apprehend Tarrants and the two other inmates,

which attempts resulted in a gun battle, causing

one of the inmates, name unrecalled, to

be killed by

Law entorcement officers, consisting Of ibi Agents,

Mississippi Highway Safety Patrol (MHSP) officers,

and those of the Rankin County Sheriff's Office.

The committee was advised that this was SA Sammon's

First and last contact with Tarrants.

SA Sammon

in answer to specific questions, advised that he hac

no personal knowledge of the acts of larrants periormec

on a residence of a Jewish businessman

in Meridian,

Mississippi.

SA Sammon was then questioned regarding the

availability of FBI informants to other Federal or

local law enforcement agencies, and the Bureau policy

as pertaining to that availability. SA Sammon advised

• the committee that it is the practice of the FBI,

as well as other law enforcement agencies, not to

reveal the identity of Bureau informants to those

agencies, even though the information furnished by

those informants may be disseminated to those agencies.

The committee at this point took exception with

SA sammon indicating it was their feeling that the fBi

"receives all information but does not share information"

with other law enforcement agencies, Federal,

state, and

local.

the committee at this point

was unequivocally

advised that this has not and is not the case of the fBi,

and that information obtained by the EBI which is of an

interest to those agencies,

is disseminated to them,

even though the identity of the informant furnishing

such information is not revealed to those agencies.

SA Sammon was again asked for his knowledge

as to the availability of Bill Somerset to the Intelligence

Unit of the Miami, Florida, Police Department, to which

sA sammon again advised that he was not aware of such

availability during the years of 1961-1964, the only

period that sA Sammon was acquainted with Somerset.

SA Sannon was asked as to the degree of

contidence and reliability regarding the intormation

furnished by Somerset while an fbl informant.

SA Sammon

advised from 1961-1964, it was his opinion that the

information furnished by Somerset was reliable, and that

(ur 19d by

Florida,

FBI Office from 1961-1964, SA Sammon advised

the committee that as that period of time was from

14-17 years in the past, SA Sammon would try to be as

accurate as

possible as

to months and years involved;

however,

the committee was reminded SA Sammon's

recollection of the events may be six months to perhaps •

a year off. Mark Speiser advised SA Sammon that the

committee would only allow a four month leeway. This

comment may have been misunderstood by SA Sammon and

may have been in jest by Speiser; however, in any regard,

Speiser was advised that SA Sammon stood on his previous

statement that events occurring 14-17 years ago would be

timed as accurately as SA Sammon possibly could; however,

there would be no

four month allowance"

imposed

on SA Sammon, unless the committee intended to furnish

him documentary verification.

There was no such

documentary verification furnished SA Sammon during

his interrogation, with the exception of SA Sammon

being furnished a

"parade" lengthy article from what appeared

or pictorial section of the Miami,

Florida, Herald, Sunday Supplement Newspaper, which

article appeared to be regarding Bill Somerset.

article was furnished SA Sammon briefly in an effort

to identify Somerset by photograph as it appeared in

the article.

SA Sammon was unable to positively identify

Somerset, due to the length of time involved, and the

advised the committee that the poor photograph dic

resemble somerset; however, if the committee had not

advised Sammon that it was of Somerset, SA Sammon

would be unable to identify him.

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE

ON ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA)

SA Sammon was furnished a name of an

individual in Miami, Florida, which name SA Sammon

failed to record

and therefore the identity of

that individual is not recalled by SA Sammon.

SA Sammon was asked by the committee if he was

acquainted with this individual.

SA Sammon advised

the individual was unknown to him.

SA Sammon was then advised that this

individual was a house painter in Miami, and SA

Sammon was asked if Bill Somerset was acquainted

with this individual.

ATT. SA Sammon advised that he then recalled

that this individual may be identical to a person ::

who was at the scene of the James Meredith

Integration disorder at the University of Mississip,

xIora, Mississippi, which SA Sammon believed to

be in 1963.

The committee was advised that the

incident arose over Meredith, a Negro, attempting

to register to attend the University of Mississippi.

SA Sammon recalled that a lead was received

at the Miami Office to identify and interview this

Miami house painter as his vehicle had been observed

at the University of Mississippi campus during the

disorder involving the registration of Meredith at

that university.

SA Sammon advised that he and SA Leonard

C. Peterson contacted Bill Somerset for background

information on this individual and that Somerset

was acquainted with house painter and furnished

SA Peterson background information concerning this

Individual, to the best of SA Sammon's recollection

involving the house painter being a member of

National States Rights Party (NSRP).

Thereafter, SA Sammon assisted SA Peterson

in-the interview of this individual in Miami in either

the summer of 1963 or 1964.

SA Sammon recalled that

interview, was very hostile towards the interviewing

Agents; however, at the persistence of SA Peterson

he was interviewed regarding his appearance at the

University of Mississippi.

A short time thereafter, an article appeared

In the newspaper of the NSRP on the front page which

was submitted by this house painter.

This article

referred to his interview with. SA Peterson and SA

'a blond haired

and to SA Sammon as

a Jew bastard" or words

to that effect.

SA Sammon was asked if he was acquainted with

Joseph A. Milteer,

or if Somerset ever furnished any

information regarding Milteer and his activities.

Sammon advised he was not acquainted with MIlteer and

did not recall Somerset furnishing any information.

regarding him.

never said who put out the contract but said that he could get

the money for WILSON if he killed KING.

WILSON stated that MITCH was well aware of his, WILSON's,

thoughts concerning KING and the black civil rights movement, in.

that his father, who was a pastor of the Central Baptist Church at

Grenada, Mississippi, died of a heart attack which he, wILsON,

thought was caused as a result of racial tensions at Grenada brought

on by the forceful integration of his father's church.

WILSON stated that approximately five or six months before

KING's murder, he started gathering information on the movements,

habits, and whereabouts of KING.

WILSON advised that he had a red and white Bonanza airplane,

Register Number 34L, and a Cessna 310 twin-engine aircraft, which was

blue and white, which planes he used to fly to different places

where KING, was supposed to be. He stated that he recalls going

• to

Huntsville, Alabama; Tupelo, Mississippi; Jackson, Tennessee; Atlanta,

Georgia; and Greenville, South Carolina.

He stated that while at

Tupelo, Mississippi, he stayed in the Ramada Inn and believes that

in the

other places

he visited he stayed in Holiday Inns.

He stated that MITCH furnished him a Japanese sniper rifle.

He stated that he kept the rifle and that just before Christmas of

1975, he had it reworked at a

gunshop in Columbus, Mississippi, on

Fourth Street across from a bank..

He stated that the last knowledge

he had of

the rifle, his older son, StEVEN WAYNE WILSON, had the

rifle and a shotgun but had told him that he had sold it.

Mr. WILSON advised that there was a garbage strike in

Memphis for. a rally and instructed WILSON to come to Memphis where

he was to meet two men at the Wonder Bar located at the corner of

Summer Avenue and White Station Road.

Mr. WILSON advised that he flew to Memphis, Tennessee,

in the Bonanza aircraft and landed at an airport just north of

Raleigh,. Tennessee.

He stated that the airport was operated by a

long-time acquaintance of his who had attended a church which was

pastored by WILSON's father in the past.

WILSON stated that his

daughter, DEBORAH, picked him up at the airport in her 1965 white

Mustang,

which WILSON had previously bought for her and which was

registered in his name in Missouri.

He advised that DEBRAH and her mother, BETTY LOU, were

staying at the residence of WILSON's father-in-law, VERNON HOOTEN

• 3095 Ruskin Road, Memphis, Tennessee.

He stated that HOOTEN had had

a heart attack and that his wife and daughter were temporarily stay-

ing at the HOOTEN residence.

WILSON advised that he went to the Wonder Bar and while

having a drink two white men approached him, one having an accent

similar to a Puerto Rican.

The two white males furnished him with FBI credentials,

which he stated had a black and white photograph of himself on it,

and they took him and showed him where KING was to hold the rally.

They then took WILSON to a hotel on South Main Street near Beale

Street and took him to a room on the third floor. They told him

he was to be in the crowd at the rally and that a decoy shot was to

be fired and that he was then to shoot. They said that KING had a

habit of raising his arms over his head when he was making a speech

and that the second time that he did so, the shots were to be fired.

WILSON stated that on the day of the murder he was in the

crowd standing near a wood fence approximately 60 feet from where

KING was standing and that when KING raised his arms the second time

he shot him.

Mr. WILSON advised that he had the rifle which he used

strapped to his belt under a suit coat and attached to his belt on

a swivel.. He stated that the barrel protruded from below his coat

out no one questioned him concerning it. He said that he had prac-

ticed a great deal swiveling the rifle and firing it.

He advised that after the shooting, he was stopped by the

Memphis police, but he showed them the credentials, and they let

him

go,. and he

walked on down the street approximately two blocks

to where he had left the. Mustang parked. He advised that he got

in the. Mustang and drove back to the HOOTEN residence, and his

laughter, DEBORAH, then took him to the airport, and he got his

plane and flew back to. Kansas City. He stated that the airport

that he used was on the Kansas side on the highway to Olathe,

Kansas. He stated the airport was run by (First Name Unknown)

FISHER.

He also stated that he had purchased the Bonanza aircraft

from FISHER.

WILSON advised that approximately one week before the

murder, MITCH

gave him 525,000 1n s20 bills, and IodIOwing the

murder,

MITCH

gave him another $25,000, at which time he gave the

credentials back to MITCH.

HIS FATHER OBTAINED THE JAPANESE RIFLE FROM AN UNKNOWN

SOURCE AFTER HE WAS IN THE MILITARY SERVICE, WHICH WOULD

HAVE BEEN AFTER 1970. RECALLED HIS DAD SHOWING IT TO

FIRED THE WEAPON BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID THAT IT WOULD NOT

FUNCTION PROPERLY, AND SECONDLY, BECAUSE THEY NEVER HAD

OF HIS DAD USING THE WEAPON. HIS DAD HAD THE STOCK OF

WILSON told GLADDEN, "You won't see me anymore

He wanted the GLADDENs to have his watch

WILSON stated that he would only deal with the "Sheriff

investigative work while in the military service.

WILSON kept bringing up the fact that he was

going to meet with the Sheriff of Memphis, Tennessee,

norning of August 18, 1978, and even offered to furnist

GLADDEN this individual's name and telephone number if he

wanted it for verification. GLADDEN declined.

WILSON said that he had gone through 10 years of

hell because he killed KING. He said that it had ruined

26 years of a good marriage and now his conscience was bothering

him more than ever in the last few years.

WILSON referred to a sketch of the KING murder

suspect which apparently had been recently shown on television

and told GLADDEN that the sketch was almost an exact likeness

On March 25, 1976, under Cause Number 7712, WILSON

was placed on 8 years probation by the 22nd Judicial

District

Court,

Comal County, for Theft Over $200 and Under $10,000.

The charge resulted

from WILSON's taking a check for $2500

from a supposed business partner to Dallas, Texas, for the

purpose of purchasing stock for their jewelry store. WILSON

did not return. A condition of the probation was the restitution

of $2500 and payment of court costs in the amount of $62.50.

On June 8, 1976, WILSON reported to the Probation

Office while under the influence of alcohol.

WILSON advised

that he had been working for the U. S. Secret Service in

seguin, Texas, on a counterfeiting ring and that members of

this ring were attempting to kill him.

under the influence of alcohol and asked that his probation

be revoked. WILSON was incarcerated in the Comal County Jail.

Subsequent inquiry by ALLEN with the U.S. Secret

Service determined that WILSON had furnished information of

no value to that agency and that there was no counterfeiting

ring. After approximately three days of incarceration WILSON

advised ALLEN that the reason he had requested his probation

be revoked was because he was seeking protection.

He indicated

that he wanted his probation continued. By report dated

to the Probation Office, WILSON indicated

that he was residing at 113 Mill Street, San Marcos, Texas,

78666, telephone number 392-2776. He listed his employment

as self-employed - construction.

motel is supposed to be on Highway 72 in Corinth. I checked with the Southern

Motel and they have no record. I also checked with the Corona Plaza. They have

no record but the ownership has changed hands several times since 1968 and the

present owner is trying to locate the old records.

Enclosed you will find a copy of the letter and diagram of the location of

the motel. Also enclosed is a message from the National Sheriff's Association

addressed to Mr. Ray.

Do you think there is any reason why we should check any further into this matter

since you checked all the motels in 1968?

If we can be of any assistance to you in the future, please feel free to call

on us.

With kindness and best regards,

edwin

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Dallas, Texas

February 1, 1979

ASSASSINATION OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

CIVIL RIGHTS

On January 30, 1979, an anonymous woman caller

telephonically furnished the following information to

Special Agent Udo H. Specht, FBI, Dallas, Texas:

"she stated that an individual by the name of

C. H. Wison, residing at Boya, Texas, in a brick house

on the road between Boyd and Azle, Texas, might have been

responsible or somehow involvea in the assassination of

Martin Luther King, JI.

She described Wilson as a white

male, 6', 180

pounds, 51 years of age, and a pipe welder

by trade.

Wilson was involved in Ku Klux Klan activities

and lived in Greenville, Mississippi in 1968 and prior to

that.

Prior to the assassination of King, Wilson allegedly

stated that he would kill or was going to kill Martin Luther

King.

wilson

and another man, whom she would not identify,

were in Memphis the day King was assassinated. At that time,

Wilson owned a relatively new white Ford Mustang bearing

Mississippi license plates.

After Wilson returned to

Greenville, Mississippi, from Memphis, Tennessee, he hid the

white Mustang

• for approximately one month.

The caller stated that Wilson is an alcoholic and

was during that time.

He was drinking two and three quarts a

especially. it he ses been deinking.

The caller stated that Wilson is mean and capable of murder,

The caller would not identify the other man who was in

Memphis with Wilson until she found out somehow that someone is

investigating what she is saying.

On January 30, 1979, a telephone company information

operator advised that a c. H.

Wilson is listed as residing in

Boyd, Texas, telephone number (817) 433-5105.

The Dallas, Texas FBI indices to investigatory records

did not reflect any information identifiable with C. H. Wilson.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions of

the FBI. It is the property of the FBI and is loaned to your agency;
