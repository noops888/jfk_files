received a phone call from FRYE giving her instructions

about sending the money order.

She stated she sent the money

order on same date but that Western Union must have had some

difficulty as her daughter called back two or three times on

6/16/59 and 6/17/59 asking about the money order as she had

JELSEN maintained that she had no further

DI 88-2749

on 8/20/59, PCI DORIS HOWARD arrived in Dallas as

scheduled.

She has made contact with the sister of FRYE,

MARJORIE LOFTICE, and RUBY JELSEN:

She has made arrangements

to meet with JELSEN tonight for dinner and discuss of possible

contact with FRYE. JELSEN and LOFTICE have both advised the

intormant they are convinced that their phones are tapped,

biy the FBI and therefore do not desire to discuss any matters

by phone.

It should be noted that after each contact with the

informant, LOFTICE and JELSEN have called the FBI Office but

have not given full details of discussions with HOWARD. It is

believed they are making such reports based on their beliefs

that their phones

are tapped.

Investigation at Blossom, Texas, concerning father

Of FRYE, CHARLES ALLEN CLEBURN, WaS

conducted 8/17/59 without

result.

Little Rock by airtel, 8/19/59, advised that investigation

by that office based on information previously received from

Norfolk had been conducted without identification of POPE or

Phoenix by airtel 8/19/59 advised that interviews

with BILL SWIFT, PAUL CLINITE, and JOHN FLYNN had been conducted

by that office, but no pertinent information developed.

Dallas is continuing coverage of LOFTICE, FRYE, and

the informant throughout today and any subsequent necessary

days in the future in an effort to determine whereabouts of

FRYE and/or POPE.

POPE IS HEAVILY ARMED AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED

EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.

PERVE IS ARMED WITH A : 32 CALIBER

AUTOMATIC,

HAS ASSAULTED POLICE OFFICERS IN THE PAST AND SHOULD
