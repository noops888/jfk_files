SUMMARY OF FILE REVIEW CONDCTED AT CIA HEADQUARTERS ON 31 OCTOBER 1978.

Response dated 20 August 1978.

"SUBJECT: Response to HSCA Request of 25 July 1978.

1. A thorough review of Agency files containing production from the LILYRIC

photographic surveillance operation in Mexico City reveals the existence of

no LILYRIC logs or production earlier than 3 April 1967. It appears that

earlier photographs may have been destroyed in a purge of Mexiço City Station

files and that the folders for the destroyed material were re-used to

forward more recent photographic material to Headquarters for retention.

2. According to a blind memorandum dated 2 May 1977, subject: Review of

Mexico City Station Files at the Warrenton Records Center, the LILYRIC

folder which would have contained photographs and logs for the period

23 July through 30 November 1963 had been re-used to store LICALLA photo-

graphs and logs for the period 2 May through 30 June 1967.

(Cf.

Blind

memorandum dated 5 May 1977, subject: Photograph Records of the "uniden-

tified Man" who Was in Mexico City during October 1963.)

3. The above information

is contained in a soft file entitled: Photograph of

Unidentified Individual in Mexico City. This folder has been reviewed by

the following HSCA staff members:

13 March 1978 - Dan Hardway

10 April 1978 - Michael Goldsmith

Rober Genzman

4 May 1978 - Edwin Lopez.

DIR 28778 to which MEXI 9440 is referrenced is itself referenced to

DIR 22051 with the slug "TYPIC AMMUG" says:

Review of Soviet Logs: from Log Film 143.

The coverage for 27 September is given as 900 to 1900 but the last sequence of

photographs. was taken at 1146.

This does not appear to be too unusual.

on 9/25 the coverage is the same

and the last photos taken at 1137. See following chart.

Barbara gave me a

copy of a file entitled. "Response to HSCA -28.07.78

Item 5 (Delimitations Agreement)". as.a response to request of 7/20/78

for FBI-CIA agreements regarding Mexico.

10:30 AM

from KDFACTOR/KDLITERAL file

see attached chart.

Reply to 7/20 request regarding CIA-FBI coordination:

31 July 1978

Memo. for Breckinridge

from Shepanek

1. The answer to paragraph 2 of reference is that there are not now, nor

were there any, agreements between the CIA and FBI or other U.S. govern-

ment agencies concerning ClA responsibility to report on contacts fo

U.S. citizens with Communist Embassies or officials.

Such reporting would

be expressly forbidden by current legislation.

2. The CIA under operative legislation has a counterintelligence respon-

sibility for counterintelligence cases but this is not a matter of

agreement with other agencies nor does it concern simpl contacts of

Americans abroad with Communist Embassies or officials.

dated 18 November 1960

Review of Project LIEMPTY , attachment to HMMA 159794-seeks renewal of

project for period 1 December 1960 to 30 November 1961.--describes functions:

"LIMITED- This base compiles daily logs indicating all arrivals, departures

and where possible, identities of every person visiting or working at the

LIMERICK target....LIMITED's photographic coverage is still concentrated on

visitors, as opposed to employees, to the LIMERICK installation...

LILYRIC photographs also are concentrated on visitors to the target, as

opposed to employees.

It should be noted that LILYRIC operates for

photographic coverage during the hours from daylight to 1400 hours each

day of the

week except Sunday.

The LIMITED base maintains photographic

coverage from 1400 hours to darkness each day except Sunday."

No date on this document. Teh cover Memo from HQCO Charlotte L. Zehrung,

is dated 13 December 1960.

Review of Project LIEMPTY, attachment. to HMMA 17999, 10/31/61 says:

"1. 'To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK personnel and

physical facilities through use of photographic base houses.' Three photo-

graphic bases, LIMITED; LILYRIC and LICALLA, contribute to this objective.

to avoid repetition, the Station is omitting the usual description of the

functions of these three bases and how they contribute to the above objective.

There has been no change in the coverage as described in the 1960 Request

for Project Renewal."

Same on 1962, HMMA-20052,10/18/62

and 1963HMMA 22387, 10/25/63.

A Memo to Chief of Ops, DD/P dated 1/8/60 said :

"FI/OPS recommends strongly that the photo coverage be reviewed from the

standpoint of value and usefulness with a view to determinging whether

the LILYRIC activity could not be safely eliminated and the additional

photographic coverage conducted on a more selective basis, without materially

affecting overall usefulness.

Memo 2/3/61, to Chief of Ops/DDP from Chief DDP/PG says:

"LIMITED, which compiles daily logs on arrivals and departures from

the

LIMERICK employees, and handles the radio dispatch of the LIEMBRACE

surveillance team on LIMERICK personnel and targets of opportunity. This

basehouse also provides photographic coverage; concentrated on visitors.

(b) LILYRIC which provides clandestine photographs particularly of visitors

to, as well as employees of,

the LIMERICK installation, prepares weekly

reports on license numbers of all cars visiting the installation."

HMMA 14793, 4/8/60 says in para 3:

"While HMMA 14093 (not located) correctly referred to LIMITED,LILYRIC and

LICALLA as 'photographi basehouses,' the Station would like to emphasize

that photographic coverage is only one of their functions (please see

HMMA 12095, 4 February 1959) LIMITED is used as a radio dispatch base for

automobile surveillance teams in addition to physical surveillance of

persons entering the front gate.

Their photography is negligible compared

to their other duties. The LILYRIC base performs the best photography of

persons visiting the front gate, perhaps because the vantage point for

vantage point for of

taking the pictures is from the second floor and above the street traffic

which partially blocks LIMITED photographs.

LILYRIC also does individual

reports on LIMERICK personnel entering and leaving the main gate.

HMMA-23343, 4/30/64, says, in para. 2:

RET BiSA-14793

"The Station feels that it would be helpful to summarize at this time

information previously reported to Headquarters (see paragraph 3, reference

B) concerning the photo basehouses under this project

and thereby give

Headquarters an updated frame of reference in which to view the roles of the

various basehouses.

Thi LIMITED and LILYRIC BASEHOUSES provide coverage of front of the

LIMERICK installation. Although on the surface it may appear that these

two basehouses provide duplicate take, this is not the case.

It has been the

Station's experience in running the unilateral LIEMPTY operation that a 0900

to evening workday, which would be required of a single basehouse in order to

cover the LIMERICK target effectively, is just too long for any pair of

agents to remain effective. This is especially true when it is considered

that these basehouse operators are essentially unsupervised during their

workday. It would also be impossible for a single base-house to provide.

the kind. of coverage the station needs on the target installation, i

especially during the peak hours of activity, namely late morning and early

afternoon. For these reasons, the LILYRIC basehouse generally operates

from 0900 to 1400 or 1500 weekdays. LIMITED operates from 1200 to 1800 or

Saturdays. (These hours are subject to change to fit Station needs.)

Special coverage for Sunday is arranged on a need basis; however, past

experience has shown regular coverage of Saturday afternoons and Sundays

is not rewarding. This schedule provides for both basehouses to be in

action during the peak activity hours of the LIMERICKtarget.

Although

this arrangement is not completely airtight, anything less than this would

present unacceptable gaps in the coverage.

It must also be considered that :

without two basehouses covering the front of the target installation, any

illness, personal problem or vacation for operators of one basehouse

would terminate Station coverage.:..It is the Station's opinion that as

long as the LIMERICK Installation

is a prime target of the Station, it will

be necessary to maintain the present three basehouses.

To eliminate any one

of the thee would create a gap in the Station's coverage that would not be
