MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

24 July 1978

filed HSCA

SUBJECT : Meeting with HSCA on Mexican Interviews

1. Niles Gooding, George Joannides, Rodger Gabrieison,

Bill Sturbitts, Marty Hawkins and Norbert Shepanek met with

Messrs. Blakey

and Cornwell at 0730 Saturday morning.

The

purpose was to discuss

activity in Mexico City planned by

• HSCA.

2.

As usual, it is difficult to plan how to approach

questions as limited information

They had told us of

them out into separate groups and in the discussion with

the HSCA representatives, one of these groups was subject

to yet further distinctions.

3. The first group consisted of the following:

a. Calvillo.- An unwitting co-optee, it

had been agreed previously that Calvillo would not

be asked about the activity he engaged

in that,

unknown to him, was at CIA initiative.

b. Henry Lopez - A tormer contract agent

from agent.

of CIA. He is a former employee--as distinguished

from "agent" in the full sense of the word--and

could be interviewed as a former employee.

c. Two men by the names of Palomares and

Flores, neither of whom has had an operational

association

with the Agency.

The second group is more complex, consisting of

persons in whom the HSCA would be interested becaüse of

their private activities without reference to Agency

connections, which all of them had.

HSCA has spoken to

other persons in Mexico City, and had independent informa-

tion about them of interest to their investigation; they

(HSCA) felt they could simply approach them directly with-

out reference to

any Agency association. They are as

follows:

a .

The two who worked for CIA, LIONION and

Alvarez

Duran, operated photographic surveillance

posts.

It was agreed that arrangements would be

made whereby they could be interviewed by an

electronic means,

in adjoining but separated

rooms.

One of them may not be available as he

may be in Spain.

Wichtrich.

Both are private citizens who are reported to have

information of interest to the HSCA, in their

private capacity.

HSCA proposes to interview

these persons just as they did the two penetration

agents," without any mention of CIA.

5.

In essence, we have an anomaly, whereby we have

arranged to have

support agents (whose only interest to

HSCA is their work for the Agency) interviewed by tele-

phonic equipment

Two agents whose nature is ordinarily

even more sensitive (penetration agents) are being

interviewed directly because they worked in a hostile

diplomatic installation (and not because

they worked for

CIA) with no reference to be made to their association

for the first two agents above). And two .U.S. citizens whose

work with CIA is of no interest

to HSCA (although the reasons

for interviewing them were not revealed to us) will be inter-

viewed without reference to their Cla connection.

In the

eyes of ASCA, while they recognize a proprietary

relation-

ship on the part of CIA with the two support agents (operated

photographic surveillance posts), they do not recognize such

a relationship with the others,

as HSCA would have inter-

viewed them anyway for unrelated reasons (i.e., unrelated

to CIA connections).

6.

While HSCA has had to postpone their trip until

around 7 August (the Mexican Government requested a delay),

the basic problem remains. There is more time to get

some feel for what is involved, but in essence, it is the

position of HSCA that since they would have interviewed

the four persons without reference to a CIA connection)

they will do so anyway, but have solemnly undertaken to

not raise any question about CIA connections or activities.
