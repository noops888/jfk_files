PURPOSE

To produce material for psycho-

logical impact on Cuba.

Members of OAS need to be inspired

to push some special action through.

Current events offer a number of

opportunities for exploitation through

such OAS bodies as the Commission

on Human Rights, the Peace Committee,

the Council of Jurists, and the Children's

Institute, as well as the Special Con-

sultative Committee on Security.

and strong statements about the

Castro-Communist threat to the

Hemisphere, the failures of the

regime towards Cuban workers,

students, farmers, and freedom.

(STATE)

To produce material for psycho-

logical impact on Cuba.

Under the Ambassador's initiative,

each Country Team by now has the

means to generate more open and

active commitment of Latin American

political, intellectual, labor, youth,

religious, and military leaders. One

significant action in each Latin American:

country, for hard impact on Cuba, is a

minimum need.

TASK

POLITICAL - continued

Cause a major political action to

take place in an influential Latin

American country, to worsen

sharply that country's relations

with Cuba, to open rupture and

criticism; Brazil is nominated.

(STATE)

PURPOSE

To produce material for major

psychological impact on Cuba,

undermining the power and prestige

of the hierarchy of the Castro

regime.

PACE 2-

CONSIDERATIONS

Brazil and Mexico are the Castru

regime's prestige neighbors:

Brazil

is nominated due to its own past history

of a Communist attempt at armed over-

throw of the people's government, which

is ripe for further exploiting in connec-

tion with the Castro threat.

Country Team

means can be used to bestir sharp criti

cism by Brazilian workers and farmers

of Castro's betrayal of Cuba's revolution.

Tours of Cuban exiles of stature can

bear telling witness to the dangers of

Communism to Brazil and the shame of

condoning betrayal of the Cuban people.

The special film alerting Brazil to danger,

with its religious message, should be re-

played; labor audience films, strengthened

by moral of the story in today's events,

should be used to provoke sober thought

and pressure on the government to "break

with Castro now." Ultimate loss of Habana

embassy is greatly outweighed by psycho-

logical value at this time, inpairing Castro"e

power over the people and his machine

cadre.

TASK

POLITICAL - continued

Develop a suggested platform of

Cuban poltical-economic objectives

for possible adoption by Cubans in

freeing their country. , (STATE)

Assure that optimum values are

obtained from the CRC and Cuban

refugee groups in the U.S. (CIA)

TOP C

SPECIA

PURPOSE

For the guidance of Operation

Mongoose personnel, particularly

in the selection and readying of

agents to ensure that they are

committed to acceptable political

beliefs before introduction into

Cuba.

These Cuban external groups have

a vital role for propaganda impact

inside Cuba.

We must have pur -

poseful, singleness of guidance and

monitoring of their activities to

support the project.

PAGE 3-

CONSIDERATIONS

There are a number of statements of

Cuban political objectives, including

drafts by State and CIA.

What is needed

now, and promptly, is a single working

document for the guidance of U.S.

operational staffs.

CIA and State both have had roles with

the CRC and others.

Cuban leaders also

make contact at a number of high offices

of the U.S. government. For the good

of the U.S., the Cuban refugees, and our

project, there must be coordinated manage-

The Director, Central Intelligence,

should have this responsibility, particularly

with leaders of the stature of Dr. Jose

Miro Cardona.

PSYCHOLOGICAL

Working Group for day-to-day

Cuba operations, (STATE)

Make strong, repetitive theme

on radio broadcasts to Cuba of

the overwhelming disapproval

throughout the Western Hemisphere

of the Castro-Communist regime,

along with sympathy for the captive

Cubans. (USIA)

Crets

PURPOSE

To assure full consideration of

material, as collected, in terms

of special psychological-propaganda

use against the Cuban regime, and

to inform the public.

To undermine Castro's psycho-

logical basis of control over the

Cuban people and the lower echelons

of the regime's bureaucracy.

PAGE -4-

CONSIDERATIONS

This has been a normal State-chaired

working group.

It needs to be sharply

geared to the project's operations,

including consideration of declassifying

material for operational use.

Defense

should be added to the membership. It

is possible that USIA should assume

leadership.

This is to make full use of material

produced by actions in the Western

Hemisphere.

the Western Hemisphere) of

Cuban refugees and defectors,

as dramatic witness against the

Castro-Communist regime.

(USLA)

9. Ready the "Voice of Cuba" for

radio broadcast. (CLA)

SPECK:

PURPOSE

To undermine Castro's psycho-

logical basis of control and to

build the tone for anti-Castro

actions in the Western Hemis -

phere.

To provide a ready capability for

giving a "voice" to encourage

resistance elements inside Cuba

and to undermine the morale of

the Castro regime.

STOP S

PAGE -5-

CONSIDERATIONS

Note the inclusion of defectors in this

task; it is still a CIA task to produce

the defectors. Also, this task includes

exploitation of Dr. Miro Cardona's

intensely moving statement at the end

of the Armstrong Circle Theater drama,

"Anatomy of Betrayal."

Initially, this would be for brief news

broadcasts of local events inside Cuba,

simulating a location in Cuba, but

actually located off-shore.] A plan of

how best to do this, with the proposed

program format, is needed to obtain

policy decision.

SPECIAL HARAG

PURPOSE

To provide a ready capability

for low-risk propaganda dis-

semination inside Cuba.

To make the truth available to

the Cuban people about the

Communist regime.

PACE 6-

CONSIDERATIONS

A plan of how best to do this, including

types of propaganda content (with

thought given for delivery of symbolic

gifts, such as scarce foods or medicines,

as well as leaflets), is required for de-

cision. It is noted that USIA has a brief

recording of Castro's broadcasts,

sharply contrasting his promises when

he took power with what he said when he

admitted his Communist affiliation; these

could be put on cheap plastic discs and

into leaflets.

This is seen as smuggling in copies,

for passing from hand-to-hand!

The

smuggling could be done by third-

nationals.] (C)

SPECIA

PURPOSE

To make fullest possible use of

the existing Cuban labor population

on the base.

To provide catchy expressions of

popular resistance against the

Communist regime.

PAGE -7-

CONSIDERATIONS

Activities include sports broadcasts,

in Spanish, over the base radio station

on ball games, news broadcasts using

regular wire service news, and making

Spanish-language periodicals a::d litera-

ture available for reading on base.

USIA has a number of selected titles,

published in Mexico and Rio, for stocking

base libraries. Also, USIA has a number

of VOA "backgrounders" and refugee inter-

views on tape which could be used for

radio broadcasts to Cuban employees on

the base.

New words to a favorite song, a new tune,

a visual symbol for wall-painting, a hand

symbol as easy to do as "V for Victory,"

are the types of expressions sought.

USIA

should call on CIA for assistance, since

some thought has been given to this already.

PURPOSE

To make a psychological impact

upon the regime and public,

which symbolizes popular resis-

causes talk encouraging to resis-

tance.

To exploit recent experience in

order to ensure that there is ade-

quate coverage inside Cuba to permit

the firm end-of-July intelligence

estimate required for further decisions.

PAGE -8-

CONSIDERATIONS

CLA should select a feasible sabotage

operation, a "showy" one against the

regime, but not against the people,

and present a specific proposal for

approval.

PURPOSE

To provide material for opera -

tions putting pressure on the

Castro regime inside Cuba, and

for use on the OAS-UN opinion

stage.

To take the fullest possible advan-

tage of this open U.S. "listening

post'' on Cuban soil.

PAGE 9-

CONSIDERATIONS

Really current "inside"news tips can

do most to undermine the regime's morale

and interest the Cuban public.

Classifi

cation may be a problem but this use

must be pressed as a priority.

ONI can call upon ClA for assistance. A

communication link to Miami would per -

mit use of extensive CIA background infor

mation available there and leads for further

exploitation, not only for positive intelli

gence, but also for counter-intelligence.

A number of further steps are possible.

TREFORN

PURPOSE

To have a ready capability

for re-supply of agent teams

inside Cuba when needed.

To assure that skills needed for

guerrilla operations are present

inside Cuba, so that paramilitary

actions can be initiated when the

decision is made.

PAGE -10-

CONSIDERATIONS

Since the Air Force has readied a

capability for this task and since it

is still desired that CIA mount such

operations with Cuban or Latin American

personnel, an acceptable means must be

found promptly. CIA, with Defense assis-

tance, as a priority will review feasible

means of mounting these operations, and

recommend the most practical method

for a policy decision.

While CIA is currently carrying out

this task, it is worth CIA taking a further

hard look at its training program to anti-

cipate needs. If larger groups of action

types are to be trained for possible intro-

duction in September, it is known that at

least 3 months "lead time" is required

for minimum selection and training. That

means now.

It is possible that Defense

can be of far more help than called upon

at present. Also, it is possible that further

policy guidance might be required.
