INTERVIEWS OF FBI EMPLOYEES BY

CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES

By memorandum to All Employees dated May 28, 1975,

captioned, "Interviews of FBI Employees, " all employees were

advised of the necessity of securing FBI Headquarters approval

prior to submitting to interviews by representatives of con-

gressional committees.

The necessity of securing this approval

is prompted by the Employment Agreement all employees have

signed.

You were advised that Congressional Staff Members

were conducting interviews of former and/or current employees

and that this Bureau had pledged its cooperation with Con-

gress.

Our cooperative efforts, of course, must be consistent

with

Bureau procedures.

Recently, we have had attempts by Congressional

Committee Staff Members to interview current employees

without prior contact with FBI Headquarters. You are again

reminded that if a representative of a Congressional

Committee should contact a Bureau employee,

that employee

should decline to respond to questions posed to him and advise

the Congressional Staff Member of the necessity of receiving

FBI Headquarters approval before responding to questions.

Also, you are reminded of Title 28, Code of Federal

Regulations, Section 16.22 (copy attached), which reads as follows:

"No employee or former employee of the Department of

Justice shall, in response to a demand of a court or other authority,

produce any material contained in the files of the Department or disclose

any information relating to material contained in the files of the Department,

, or disclose any information or produce any material acquired as part of

Also, you are reminded of Department of Justice Order

Number 116-56, dated May 15, 1956, (copy attached) which, among

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

As consideration for employment in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), United

States Department of Justice, and as a condition for continued employment, I hereby' declare

authorized disclosure or production of national security information, other

classified information and other nonclassified information in the files of

the FBI;

(2) I understand that unauthorized disclosure of information in the files

of the FBl or information I may acquire as an employee of the FBI could

rosuit in impairment of nat

result in impairment of national security, place human life in jeopardy, or

result in the denial of due process to a person or persons, who are subjects

of an FBI investigation, or prevent the FBI from effectively discharging its

responsibilities. I understand the need for this secrecy agreement; there-

fore, as consideration for employment I agree that I will never divulge;

publish, or reveal either'by word or conduct, or by other means disclose to

any unauthorized recipient without official written authorization by the

such instance by presenting the full text of my proposed disclosure in writing to

the Director of the FBI at. least thirty (30) days prior to disclosure. I understand

that this agreement is not intended. to apply to information which has been placed

in the public domain or to prevent me from writing or speaking about the FBI but

ORDER NO. 116-56

It is the policy of the Department of Justice to extend the fullest

possible cooperation to congressional committees requesting information from

departmental files, interviews with department employees, testimony of depart-

This order supersedes the Deputy Attorner Genera.

al's Memorandum No. 5, date

March 23, 1953, and his Memorandum No. 97, dated August 5, 1954. It formal-

Izes the Attorney General's press release of November 5, 1953, establishing

procedures to permit committees of the Congress and their authorized repre-

sentatives to interview and to take sworn testimony from Federal prisoners.

It supplements Order No. 3229 (Revised) dated January 13, 1953, and Order

January 13, 1953), Insofar as said orders have reference to procedures to be

followed in the Department's relations with congressional committees. In

support of this order, reference should be had to the President's letter

dated May 17, 1954, addressed to the Secretary of Defense, and to the Attorney

General's Memorandum which accompanied it.]

A. REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM DEPARIMENT FILES

1. Congressional committee requests for the examination of files

or other confidential information should be reduced to writing, signed by

the chairman of the committee, and addressed to the Deputy Attorney General,

who is responsible for the coordination of our liaison with Congress and

congressional committees. The request shall state the specific information

sought as well as the specific objective for which it is sought. The Deputy

Attorney General will forward the request to the appropriate division where a

reply will be prepared and returned for the Deputy Attorney General's signa-

ture and dispatch to the chairman of the committee.

2. If the request concerns a closed case, i. e., one in which

there is no litigation or administrative action pending or contemplated,

the file may be made available for review in the Department, in the presence

of the official or employee having custody thereof. The following procedure

shall be followed in such cases:

the reply letter will advise the committee that the

file is available for examination and set forth the

name, telephone extension number, and room number of

the person who will have custody of the file to be

reviewed;

NW 65994 Docld:32989783 Page 28

---

## Page 29

•12.

D. Before making the file available to the committee

representative all reports and memoranda from the FBI

as well as investigative reports from any other agency,

will be removed from the file and not be made available

for examination; provided however that if the committee

representative states that it is essential that information

from the FBI reports and memoranda be made available,

he will be advised that the request will be considered

by the department. Thereafter a summary of the contents

of the FBI reports and memoranda involved v111 be

prepared which will not disclose investigative tech-

niques, the identity of confidential informants, or

by the division to the FBI with a request for advice as

to whether the FBI has any objection to examination of

such summary by the committee representative. The file

will not be physically relinquished from the custody of

the Department.

If the committee representative desires

to examine investigative reports from other government

agencies, contained in the files of the Department, he

will be advised to direct his request to the agency whose

reports are concerned.

3. If the request concerns an open case, 1. e., one which liti-

gation or administrative action is pending or contemplated, the file may

not be made available for examination by the committee's representative.

The following procedure shall be followed:

a. The reply letter should advise the committee that

its request concerns a case in which litigation or

administrative action is pending or contemplated; and

state that the file cannot be made available until the

case is completed; and

b. Should briefly set forth the status of the case in

as much detail as is practicable and prudent without

jeopardizing the pending contemplated litigation or

administrative action.

B. REQUESTS FOR INTERVIENS WITH DEPARIMENTAI PERSONNET

1. Requests for interviews with departmental personnel regarding

any official matters within the Department should be reduced to writing,

signed by the chairman of the committee, and addressed to the Deputy Attorney

General. When the approval of the 'Deputy Attorney. General is given, the

employee is expected to discuss such matters freely and cooperatively with

the representative, subject to the limitations prescribed in A respecting

open cases and data in investigative reports;

NW 65994 Docld:32989783 Page 29

2. Upon the completion of the interview with the committee repre-

sentative the employee vill prepare a summary of it for the file, with a

copy routed to his division head and a copy routed to the Deputy Attorney

General.

committee regarding official matters vithin the Department the Deputy Attorney

General shall be promptly informed. Then the Deputy Attorney General's approv-

al is given the employee is expected to testify freely subject to limitations

prescribed in A respecting open cases and data in investigative reports;

2. An employee subpoenaed to testify before a congressional committee

on official matters within the Department shall promptly notify the Deputy

(Revised) and the President's letter of May 17, 1954, cited at the beginning

of this Order.

3. Upon the completion of his testimony the employee will prepare

a memorandum outlining his testimony vith a copy routed to his division head

and a copy routed to the Deputy Attorney General.

D. REQUESTS OF CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES FOR THE TESTIMONY OF FEDERAL PRISONERS

Because of the custodial hazards involved and the extent to which

their public testimony may arfect the discipline and vell-being of the institu-

tion; it 1s the rolicy of the Department not to deliver Federal prisoners out-

Bide

the penal institution in which they are incarcerated for the purpose of

being intervieved or examined under oath by congressional committees. However,

when it appears that no pending investigation or legal proceeding will be

adversely affected thereby and that the public interest will not be otherwise

adversely affected, Federal prisoners may be interviewed or examined under oath

by congressional committees in the institution in which they are incarcerated

under the following procedures, and with the specific advance approval of the

Deputy Attorney General.

1. Arrangements for interviewing and taking of sworn testimony

from a federal prisoner by a committee of the Congress or the authorized

representatives of such a committee shall be made in the form of a written

request by the chairman of the committee to the Deputy Attorney General.

2. Such written request shall be made at least ten (10) days

prior to the requested date for the interview and the taking of testimony

and shall be accompanied by written evidence that authorization for the

interview or the taking of sworn testimony was approved by vote of the com-

mittee. Such request shall contain a statement of the purpose and the sub-

jects upon which the prisoner will be interrogated as well as the names of

all persons other than the representatives of the Department of Justice who

will be present.

3. A member of the interested committee of the Congress shall be

present during the entire time of the interrogation.

= 4=

other witness who is not a prisoner.

5. The warden of the penal institution shall have complete

authority in conformity with the requirements of security and the mainte-

nance of discipline to limit the number of persons who will be present at

the interview and taling of testimony.

6. The warden or his authorized representative shall be present

at the interview and at the taking of testimony and the Department of Justice

shall have the right to have one of its representatives present throughout

the interview and taking of testimony.

' The committee shall arrange to have a stenographic transcript

made of the

entire proceedings at committee expense and shall furnish a copy

of the transcript to the Department of Justice.

E. OBSERVERS IN ATTENDANCE AT COMMITTEE HEARINGS

In order that the Department may be kept currently advised in

matters within its responsibility, and in order that the Deputy Attorney

seneral may properly coordinate the Department's liaison with 'Congress anc

its committees, each division that has an observer in attendance at a .

congrssional hearing, will have the observer prepare a written summary of

the proceeding which should be sent to the division head and a copy routed

to the Deputy Attorney General.
