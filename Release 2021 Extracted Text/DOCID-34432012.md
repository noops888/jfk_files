1. (U) Reference Dossier #GL-011806, Subject Ingrid Pulley nee

Katterre.

2. (C) Pulley was incarcerated during September 1957, as a direct

result of information obtained from her during the course of

an interrogation

conducted by this Region. During the course of the interrogation, Pulley was

of the opinion that she would receive a sentence from three to five years

for her activities in attempting to defect US Army personnel to the Fast

Zone.

This office learned through its liaison contacts that the maximum

sentence she would receive would be approximately one year confinement.

Hence, this fact was used as a bargaining point to extract a confession

from Pulley. She appeared to be extremely grateful to CIC because she was

of the opinion that because she told the truth concerning her activities,

CIC had interceded in getting her sentence reduced.

3 (U) Pulley was discharged from prison on 14 October 1958. It is

interesting to note that Pulley voluntarily contacted this Region upon her

release. It is felt that she had two purposes in mind when contacting this

Region:

a.. An expression of gratitude for having had her sentence reduced

to one year.

b. To solicit information as to the whereabouts of her husband,

James W. Pulley, dossier #F2-006744, and her mother who resides in the vicinity

of Bautzen, East Germany.

4. (C) It is considered important that the whereabouts of Pulley is

known at all times. First, because of her mission; and secondly, because she,

in all probability, will legally or illegally attempt to contact her husband

and mother. When this happens, Region IV stands to benefit from any informa-

tion which she may obtain.

5. (C) Pulley appears to be friendly, cooperative, and fearful of

returning to prison.

She is of the opinion

that should she continue her

mission and come to the attention of CIC in unfavorable circumstances, she

would again be incarcerated.

6. (C) Plans for development of Pulley are to continue periodic contacts

with her to obtain any information concerning above SUBJLCT, and to maintain

CIs coverage •
