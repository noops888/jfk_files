This is to recommend attached letter be sent to

the Attorney General in response to his memorandum of 7/16/75,

also attached.

For your information, there are additional

attachments relating

to prior correspondence with the Attorney

General on the matter of direct operational liaison with the

White House.

In attached letter to the Attorney General the

response to the first matter was prepared by the Special

Investigative Division (R. J. McCarthy memorandum to

Mr. Cleveland, 7/21/75, captioned as above).

It is to be noted that attached memorandum of N. P.

Callahan to the Director dated 4/24/74 captioned "Proposed

Management Changes in the Department of Justice" indicates on

page ?, item number 5, Department opposition to the FBI

exercising any policy-type liaison with the White House.

Director Kelley on page 3 of this memorandum wrote,

"The

President told me the Director of the FBI has direct access

to him and he with the Drtr.

He described this as a traditional

relationship.

I do not contemplate bypassing the AG but on

the other hand may not be able to keep him completely informed

at all times. This may possibly be pertinent to number 5.

II not, I see no reason to mention it." In this Bureau's

reply to the Department, copy attached, dated 5/2/74 captioned

"Revision of the Department of Justice

Organization Regulations

(28 CFR Part O)" in which the need for Bureau operational

(liaison with the White House is documented, the above comments

were not mentioned, and there does not appear to be any need

for elaboration on

this point in our current letter to the

Attorney General.

At 10 a.m., Monday, 4/22/74, I delivered to Associate Attorney

General J.D. Sawyer the Bureau's memorandum containing our comments on the

proposed Order which would amend Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations.

I expressed our appreciation for being given the opportunity to present

the Bureau's reaction to the proposed Order and at that time briefly discussed.

the points raised in our memorandum to the Attorney General. Mr. Sawyer

indicated that he would review our memorandum and discuss it with the people in

the Department who were working on the proposed Order and be back in touch

with me.

On the afternoon of 4/23/74, at about 4 p.m., Mr. Sawyer asked me

to stop by his office, which I did. The following points were covered:

1. We had requested specific assurance that the Director of the FBI,

would be permitted to continue to exercise complete control over FBI personnel

including making assignment to Supergrade positions except those of Associate

Order would be revised to specify that delegation of authority to the Director.

2. As to continuance of the FBI to be excepted from the Department's

Executive Development Program and that no FBI personnel or positions would be

included in any*intra-Departmental personnel exchange program, Mr. Sawyer

stated that he agreed that the Bureau should be excepted but it was not thought

destrable to provide for this in the Executive Order, Instead, it was they 5"ll

intention to provide the exception for the Bureau in a separate memorandum

which the Office of the Legal Counsel of the Department will prepare.

3. Mr. Sawyer referred to Section 0. 190 regarding the provision

that the Attorney General's approval must be secured for the proposed establish-

ment, transter, or reorganization of major functions, sections, or other sub-

units, these being defined as any organizational activities under the supervision

or proposed supervision of an individual at or above the GS-15 or equivalent

level. We proposed that this item be revised to read, "The'head of each office,

division Bureau,. or board may from time to time propose the establishment.

transfer, reorganization,_0X_termination.of.major.functions." Mr. Sawyer

stated that the new Order would adopt our proposed language.

4. As to the Bureau's request that we be delegated authority to

continue unobstructed direct liaison with the Office of Management and Budget

(OMB) on EBI,budget matters, Mr. Sawyer stated that there would be no change

in the proposed Order but that there would be an understanding that the FBI

would have direct access to OMB after clearing with the Deputy Attorney General.

5. As to our request that the FBI's operational liaison with the White

House be excepted from the scope of Section 0. 6(e), Mr. Sawyer advised that

he was opposed to the FBI exercising any policy-type liaison. He suggested that

we prepare a communication to the Attorney General and to the Deputy spelling

out our need for operational liaision so that a decision could be made based on

he specifics we would turnish

6.

As to the request that the FBI be specifically excepted from Section

0.75(k) dealing with the functions of the Assistant Attorney General fOr

Administration in regard to Automatic Data Processing (ADP), Mr. Sawyer

stated that there would be no change except that the Order will specify that

security is to be maintained as to operations... He stated that the Department

wants to know specifically what these items are and would like to have a

separate advisory memorandum. This will be prepared by the Computer Systems

Division and-sent through for approval:

Mr. Sawyer indicated that the Order will be announced on 4/24/74,

to be effective 5/11/74. In this regard, however, the elimination of the functions

of the Associate Attorney General would be effective immediately and the

Office of Management and Finance, which is headed by the Assistant Attorney

General for Administration, will commence operating under the Deputy Attorney

General immediately.

RECOMMENDATION:

This is prepared for the immediate information of the Director.

I will follow closely to see that the information which Mr. Sawyer requested

After reviewing your memoranda in light of policies

I wish to pursue for supervising the work of the Department,

I believe that some of your concerns can be met without

specific changes in the regulations. Supergrade positions

in the FBI will continue to be controlled by the Director,

although any personnel action by any officer of the

Department is subject to the discretionary review of the

Deputy Attorney General under section 0.15(c). The FBI

will continue to be excepted from the Department's

Executive Development Program but since that program is

not referred an in the regulations, it was not necessary gla

With respect to your requests that the FBI be given

authority for dicect liaison with the Office of Manage-

ment and Budget on FBI budget matters (50.76(v)) and with

the White House on operational matters (50.15(b)(7)), I

believe it desirable to have the same language in the

regulations apply to the FBI as applies with respect to

other organizational units of the Department. Your

request for direct operational liaison with the White

House Office is reasonable, but we would need clarifica-

tion as to what you regard as "operational" as distinguished

from policy matters. I believe this request can be

accommodated by further correspondence without a change in

the regulations.

Because of the desirability for uniform treatment of

the various units of the Department in the regulations, I

do not believe that the FBI Should be exempt from section

0.75(k), relating to policies and procedures applicable to

automatic data processing.

However, the FBI's security

interests will, of course, be protected.

I appreciate your concern in these matters and assure

you that the FBI will have an opportunity to submit its

views before any policy changes affecting it are finalized.

Wart Gitenstein, stalf member of captioned Committee J'

who has been doing an antensive inquiry into the "efficial and contidential"

files reportedly maintained in former Director Hoover's suice,

telephonically contacted #A Paul V. Daly Gw-75 and requested the

idontitica of tbe employees who had brought the material from the

Director's office during Miay, 1872, to bir. Hoover's residenca and

to Mir. Felt's ofilce.

By way of bacisground, fir. Oltenstein has obtained through

interviow of Mir. Felt, former Assistant to the Director John P. moer,

and other Bureau personnel familiar with the operations of the Director's

oilice, considerable knowledge concerning the dificial and confidential

files.

There is also an estensive request contained in cantioned Committee's

letter of 5-4-75 pertaining to information surroanding these files.

Additionally, we responded to a request of the Committee contained in theis

letter of 4-2B-7% pertaining to the allegation si removal of certain matertal

from Mr. Hoover's residence after the death ot former Associate Director

Clyde Tolson. We have not, at this point, determined that Bureau documente

have been removed from Bureau space to Mir. Hoover's residence or any

other place outside the bureau. However, it is apparent that lar. Citenstein

has information, or believes he has information, relating to the removal

o1 Bureau documents.

Mr. Citenstein atated he had recontacted former Assistant

to the Director Jonn P. lohr on 6-5-75 and Mr. lohe, in response to

Air. Gitenstein's question, stated that the identities of employees who may

have brought material from the birector's oifice to Mr. Hoover's residence

Logal Counsel to Mr. J. B. Adams

RE: SENSTUDY 75

In light si thie response, Mr. Citenstein requested that

the Burean identily the personnei involved and it is his obrious intention

that the personnel will be lterviewed.

Insomuch as the inspection Division is condacting inquiry

into this matter, it would appear proper for that Division to determine

the identities of such personnel and, il deemed necessary, interview in

connection with the current inquiry. It is also believed that while this

request is oral in nature from the Committee, we should consider

fuzbishing the information as to the identities of employees to the

Committee inasmuch as if we do not respond to ths oral request

Mr. Gitenstein indicated, because of the Committee's interest in this

matter, there would be no probiem in his ebtaining zuthority to furnish the

request in writing. it is apparent at this point that we would not be able

to keep such intormation from the Committce it such a written request ware

• to be received. Additionally, by responding to the oral request it will

encourage the Committee, in the areas they described as "abuse-type,"

to give us an advance indication as to their inquiries.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the Inspection Division make the necessary inquiry

conceraing the identities of the employees and, if deemed advisable,

make available to the Legal Analysis Silice that information which will

be furnished to the Committee.

By memorandum dated May 23, 1975, you were

advised that captioned Committee had directed a letter

to the U. S. Postal Service requesting information con-

cerning mail covers initiated by the Federal Bureau of

Investigation. The Committee was referred by Postal

Service to the Bureau.

Mr. John Elliff, Task Force Director,

was advised to direct a letter over the Chairman's

signature requesting the information.

On May 30, 1975, we recontacted Mr. Elliff again

asking-that a letter be directed to the Bureau asking for

the information.

He was instructed that we had been gathering

the requested information, however; prior to our responding,

we should receive a confirmation from the Committee. Present

at this discussion was K. William O'Connor, Special Counsel

to the Deputy Attorney General. The same information was

conveyed by Special Agent Paul V. Daly to Paul Wallach, Staff

Member of the Committee, who had been making the mail cover

inquiries.

Mr. Wallach indicated that he would correspond

to the Bureau in accordance with this request.

K. William O'Connor advised subsequently that the

Department had received a letter from Wallach to the Department

June 7, 1975, containing the request. Mr. O'Connor stated

that this was not in accordance with our discussion with the

Committee and he was to convey the fact that the request should

be over the Chairman's signature.

Memo to Mr. Adams from Legal Counsel

SENSTUDY 75

On June 11, 1975, Mike Shaheen of the Department,

who is working with K. William O'Connor in handling responses

to the captioned Committee, informed Special Agent Paul V. Daly

at 5:30 p.m. that we

should respond to the request concerning

mail covers without waiting for a letter from the Committee

over the Chairman's signature.

He advised that this instruction

was received fiDeputy Attorney General, Harold R. Tyler.

Tyler distinguished this postal request from others

by stating that inasmuch as the Committee Chairman hađ

authorized the Committee to inquire concerning mail covers

in a letter to U. S. Postal Services, it should not be

necessary for them to write a subsequent letter.

The requests to the Department were conveyed to

the Section Chief of the. Intelligence Division, W. O. Cregar,

on vune il, 1975.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the Intelligence Division expeditiously prepare

the necessary responses concerning mail covers.

at the FBI, two FBI-agents reportedly

removed some documents from the late director's

house in Washington, where Tolson had been 11V-3. 5/21/75

ing. Officially, the FBl denies taking any

such action, and

a friend of Tolson's says the

reported earlier that some of Hoover's private

were left in Tolson's custody, and a source

told Newsweek this week that the materials were

carted away in a truck.

Assuming that the files in question may be part

of the so-called

"Official and Confidential" files, your

testimony before

the House Judiciary Committee on February

27, 1975, is instructive. You said that the number of

files which you reviewed

contained matters relating to

"Presidential directives regarding the role of the F3I in

the security field"

Furthermore, at the same time, Director Kelley

suggested that materials from the "Official and Confiden-

tial" files were taken to Director Hoover's home.

He

stated:

Immediately after his death /Mr. Hoover's/

• some of his employees, including his personal

secretary, went through his files and completed

the destruction of the remainder of the files

that were purely personal.

These were destroyed

by shredding.

Some I understand were taken out

to his home and placed in his home, they being

historical I presume to some extent. There is

no indication that they were other than personal

files.

residence by FBI agents or former FBI agents after

Mr. Tolson's death. If agents of the FBI dia go to

Mr. Hoover's or Mr. Tolson's residence to remove files,

please provide the

Select Committee with a complete des-

cription of the documents taken into custody by the FBI.

Were any such documents copies or originals of documents

relating to the business of the FBI? If so, please des-

cribe the subject matter of each such document. Also

indicate the individual within the FBI who has custody

over these files. Furthermore, I respectfully

request on

behalf of the Select Committee

that such files not be des-

troyed or removed

from the FBI's custody until further

notice.

MEMORANDUM FOR DEPUTY ATTORNEY

#mDRL6

ALI, INTORMATION CONTAINI

LEREIL IS UNCLASSIFIED

BYSF2 ALM

GENERAL TYLER AND DIRECTOR KELLY

April 30, 1975

DATE 10/20/00

This memorandum concerns paragraph IV of the attachment

to Senator Church's letter of March 19 to the Attorney General.

On behalf of the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental

Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, I would like to

request

the following:

1. Superseded Sections of the Manual of Instructions.

Certain sections of the Manual currently in effect have been produced

to us. We had intended by the request to ask for the relevant super-

seded sections (note the absence of the word "current" in Section IV

(as compared to Section IIIA) and we did indicate previously to the

Liaison staff that we vere interested in superseded sections. But 1. 6/17/75

without regard to that, it is clear from documents such as the

2.6/18/75

Director's letter of August 7, 1973 to the Attorney General that

3.6/20/15

certain superseded sections will be highly relevant in analyzing

the question of legal authority, as well as in understanding particu-

far events in earlier years. We would appreciate their being sent

to us promptly or if that causes mechanical problems, being able to

promptly review them at the FBI in order to select particular

portions for copying. At a minimum we would be interested in

superseded Manual provisions for the sections set out in Appendix A.

Sections of the Manual of Instructions Not Previously

Based upon the previons production to us of the table

of contents to the Manual of Instructions, we have identified

1.5/19/75

certain additional sections of tie Manual which we would like to2. 5/20/15

exanine. Rather than having these made available to us in the

3.5/22/15

first instance in our offices, we suggest that they be made avail-

able to Mark Gitenstéin, and other designated members of the stafr 1, 6/11/75

for initial examination at the FBI offices. A listing of those

2.6/12/75

sections is annexed as Appendix B.

3.6/13/75

• 3. Manual of Rules and Regulations. Again, besed upon, 5/20/75

the procedure whereby we were first furnished with the table of

2.5/20/15

contents of the Manual of Rules, we have identified those sections

which we want to examine initially. Io expedite matters, these

3.5/22/75

sections, identified in Appendix C, could be examined by Mr. Gitenstein,

or other designated staff members, at the FBI offices.

4. Filing System. It would also be most helpful if you

could provide the Conmittee with any other written materials on

Reference is made to letter dated June 30, 1975,

to Mr. I. Hilliam O'Connor of the Department of Justice from

Mr. John T. Illiff of the SSC which sets out that "one of the

COINTELPRO Case studies" that SSC is examining concerns "mea-

sures directed against the Black Panther Party in the late

1960's and early 1970's in San Francisco-Oakland, Los Angeles

and San Diego, California, by the Field Offices

of the FBI,"

Referenced letter sets out requests concerning nine

categories of documents and six categories ot witnesses.

Regarding Requests 1,

2 and 3, requested documents are not

being included at this time due to the extensive volume of

documents to be reviewed and reproduced.

Regarding Request Number 4, these documents are

being submitted separately pursuant to previous requests.

Regarding Request

Number 5, the requested information

was not compiled as part of COINTELPRO files.

To compile such

a list would require a complete review of all three field

offices' substantive files which have been maintained on all

BPP members and supporters.

In light of the megnitude of such

a review no further effort is being made to respond to this

request.

CP, USA - COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAM °/ 20/00

INTERNAL SECURITY - C

During its investigation of the Communist Party,

USA,

the Bureau has sought to capitalize on incidents

involving the Party and its leaders in order to foster

factionalism, bring the Communist Party (CP) and Its Leaders

into aisrapute before the American public and cause confusion:

and dissatisiaction among rank-and-file members of the CP.

the above action has constituted

harrassment rather than disruption, since, for the most party

the Bureau has set up particular incidents, and the attack has

been from the cutside. At the

present time, nowever, there is

existing within the ce a situation resulting from the develop-

ments at the 20ch congress of the ce of the soviet union and

the Government's attack on the Party principally through

prosecutions under the Smith Act of 1940 and the Internal

Security Act of 1950 which is made to order for an all-out,

disruptive attack against the CP from within. In other words,

the Bureau 1s in a position to initiate,

on a broader scale

set ve to or he the ver one a tong together, but y at on

a counterintelligence program against.

and fostering from within the internal fight currently raging.

We have been considering possible courses to implement

such a program and, at the present time, we are actively working

on the following four:

1) The Socialist Workers Party (SWP) is making an all-

out effort to win over CP members who have become disillusioned

with Stalinist communism.

SWP members are distributing copies

'of "The Militant" (SWP publication) at CP rallies and meetings

and

are contacting individual CP members in an attempt to sell

them the SWP philosophy. This SWP program could very definitely

benefit the Bureau provided we can achieve through our informant

coverage in the SWP some degree of control and direction over it.

The ultimate goal would be to continue and intensify pressure on

the CP from the left. Since the Party is already under pressure

from the right, the combined pressure would contribute materially

AUTION: A memoranaum, together with a letter to the

15 offices naving swe activity in the l. so, is attached, sounding

out these offices through their SWP informants as to the

possibility

of initiating several specific steps aimed at the Bureau's

furthering, assisting and possibly adding te. the current swp

disruptive

program.

2) The CP national convention is scheduled to be held

during February 1957•

At the present time there appear to be 4

separate views within the CP leadership as to the degree of change to

be made in the organization and program of the us,

has publicly announced

that the theory of democratic centralisn

has been modified: and that each CP member has the right to

express his views as to the past mistakes and future path of

communism in the U. S.

resolution for the national convention has been prepared and is

being discussed on a national level prior to being sent to the

various districts for preconvention discussions on a local level.

ACTION: A memorandum, together with a letter to 12 key

offices is being prepared, requesting these offices to submit to

the Bureau the identities

of certain informants who will be

briefed and instructed to embark on a disruptive program within

their own clubs, sections, districts or even on a nationallevel.

These Informants will raise objections and doubts as to the success

of any proposed plan of action by the CP leadership. They will

seize every opportunity to carry out the disruptive activity not

only at meetings, conventions, et vetera, but also during social

and other contacts with CP members and leaders. It is noted that

Memor andum for Mr. Boardman

a letter has been sent to 12 key offices (dated August 2?, 1956)

requesting informati on as to the view points of the national and

district leaders relative to the faction within the CP that each

appears to favor.

This information can be used by the various

offices in briefing the informants who will carry out the

disruptive program.

It is pointed out that the informants chosen

and approved for this program should not be endangerea, since,

as pointed out above, the farty has publicly encouragec

this pro party

• all

members to participate in the current discussions.

a national CP leader

and convicted smith Ac subJecte was assigned by the Party to

a semirerigious stagust padrie orgenization Dimbere

secretary of the Fellowship or Reconciliation,

suggestea that

Muste prepare and distribute a document calling 1or

an exchange of opinions by individuals interested in forming à new

sociaist organization.

This is the first step taken by the CP in

forming a new socialist coalition in which it hopes to participate.

¡Muste has preparea a document which criticizes the absence of

iVil liberties, free trade unions and outlets for dissenting

opinions in the

Soviet Union.

It further urges that European

satellite nations be free from Soviet domination.

The CP hopes

Ito persuade Musterto mollify his criticism of the Soviet Union

before the document is released. At the same time the CP feels

that some mina criticism on the soviet union and the

USA, will

be beneficlal in gaining noncommunist support for mustell proposal.

ACTION: This plan of the CP may create a situation

which would lend itself to a disruptive operation by the Bureau.

It appears that it is too early to actually make a move, but we

are alerting certain offices to this plan of the CP and

Instructing that this operation be closely watched so that if a

situation does present itself we will be in a position to make

any move which appears logical and workable.

Memorandum Lor Mr. Boardman

4) When the CP underground was put in operation on a

large scale in 1951, CP leaders decided after extensive study,

that underground personnel should either disregara their tax

obligations or file under false names.

ACHION: We have optained Irom the lleld,

the names and

current addresses of former underground leaders with a view towaro

furnishing them to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for

appropriate action. A memorandum has gone through (August 28,

1956) recommending that the names and current address of 102

such leaders, all of whom nave smith Act ramilications, De

transmitted to the Department and the Depariment be requested

to advise if there is

any objection to the Bureau furnishing this

material to IRS.

If there is no objection, the Bureau proposes

to transmit the names and addresses to IRS

via Liaison for

appropriate action.

We will then follow IRs very closely since

tos action should: (1) uncover the aliases and moreabouts under

1951 to 1954, of these subjects who actually filed returns

allases and admit such action, or (2) result in possible

prosecution of those subjects

who did not file returns or who

refuse to furnish details if they did file.

It is believed that

action by IRs at this time would deal a further devastating blow

at the cP and would certainly reflect very unfavorably on the

Party leadership for the instructions issued in 1951. .

OBSERVATIONS:

We are going ahead with the 4 courses of action listed

in this memorandun. A detailed memorandum Is attached covering

the SWP angle; a memorandum has gone through separately covering

the first phase of the IRS angle

and a detailed memoranaum

covering the disruptive program by confidential informants is

being prepared as is a memorandum covering the fo

Muster phase.

For the present, our disruptive tactics will, of

necessity, be general in nature, that is, along the line of

Chicago to discuss the formation of this new organization. Speakers

include Mustej and Claude Lightfoot, CP functionary, which evidences the

serious intent the ep has in the possibilities of

The Bureau should (1) attempt to learn the CP plans for this

new organization and (2) attempt to prevent the CP from dominating, or aù

this organization for its own desires. The Bureau does

With the Cp as is, the Bureau is better

equipped to combat it under existing legislation,

With the dissolution of the CP and emergence of a new organization

under a new name it is doubtful if the afore-mentioned existing

legislation would be effective or could be applied against it.

Successful

prosecutions under existing laws have acted as a deterent to the growth

of the CP and have in the past upset its operation.

Memorandum for Mr. L. V. Boardman

Mr. and Mrs. John Baker, Rolling Hills, Thornwood, New York;

a son,

John Martin Muste, who, in 1951, was teaching school in the

State of

Maryland; and a daughter, Constance Hamilton, whose address is unknown

It is believed the Bureau at this time should consider

engaging in an enlarged program of counterintelligence activities in

connection with the formation of this new broad socialist organization

which the CP appears to be attempting to create. It is believed that

i to big and chirape contact ee by is eno de trouse of

"the Bureau's interest. In considering this possibility the Chicago

Office has been instructed to initiate an intense investigation to

determine the extent of CP domination of the 10/5/56 symposium; to

determine whether the Cp is the driving force behind the symposium;

and to afford complete coverage of unis allair. by this coverage

'Muste's attitude and line of thinking regarding this new organization

might be ascertained. Upon receipt of this information the Bureau

would be in a better position to make a definite determination

concerning the feasibility of this plan and the best course to be

followed.

In finding a suitable and reliable third-party contact to

carry out the Bureau's intentions in this matter it is desired that

the New York Office be instructed to thoroughly review its files

concerning Mustejin an effort to locate close contacts of his who

Imight be willing to assist the Bureau; to institute an investigation

Jol Muste Slactivities solely for the purpose of developing such

information; to develop information concerning the present whereabouts

of Muste'son and daughters; and to consider, depending upon the

results of its file review. ur

the desirability of Muste's son and

daughters as possible third-party contacts In order to enlarge on

Muste's background,_ authority should be granted the New York Office

to interview Louis

F. Budenz regarding Budenzis contacts with Muste

as well as the possibility that Budenz might make a good thira-party

contact. Outside of

this contact of Budenz/the New York Orrice will

be instructed not to make any contacts whatsoever until it has

submitted a "plan of attack" together with its comments and

recommendations regarding the reliability of the individuals to be

ReBulet dated August 27, 1956, captioned

"Connunist Party, USA, Factionalian, Internal Security - C,"

requesting information as to the viewpoints of the national

and district leaders relative to the particular faction

within the Communist Party (CP) wnich each leader appears

to faUor.

There is eristing within the CP at the present

time considerable internal friction resulting from the

developments at the 20th Congress of the CP of the soviet

Union and from the Government's attach on the Perty,

principally through prosecutions under the smith Act of

1940 cnd the Internal Security Act of 1950.

This situation

appears mode to order for an all-out disruptive attack

against the Party on a broader scale than heretofore

attempted by the Bureau.

Accordingly, the Bureau is thinking

in terms of a counterintelligence program cined at the CP,

not by harassrent from the outside whion might only serue

tO

bring the various

factions together but by jeeding cha

fostering from within the internal fight currently raging.

Among the several courses of action under

consideration by the Bureau

is one which will involve the

use of certain confidenticl informants tho will be briejed

their own clubs, sections, and districts. It Is contemplated

that these informants will seek to continue and increase

the current confusion eristing within the CP by raising

questions and doubts as to the success of any proposed plan

of action by the CP lecdership. For example, when the

draft resolution for the forthcoming national convencion

comes up for discussion in the various districts throughout

the country, these informants can point up the weaknesses

inherent in the resolution; the weaknesses and mistakes of

the present leadership; the cordutions which existed in

Russia during Staling leadership; Sallure of the CP leadership

labor field; the

Negro question; and many others.

The aim of the informants will be to take advantage

of the CP requests for open discussion by the membership to

force discussion of topios reflecting on the effectiveness of

CP leadership, programs, and philosophy. such discussion is

intended to shake the confidence of CP members In their

movement and render them more susceptible to development as

informants or cause them to abandon the Party or to follou

some other course of action which would interfere with an

effective reorientation of the policies of the CP.

It is not

intended that the informants compromise themselves in zavancing

these topics for discussion. Their approach shouls be overtly

construciive and exploratory rother than critical.

Under no

circumstances will any indication be given to the informants

participating in the program that other informants may be

engaged in similar activit!, and the questions and topics

raised by our informants will be so carejully planned end

introduced at the meetings in such a manner that they will not

attract any more attention than other members who are taking

part in the discussions.

It is contemploted that the informants will seize

every opportunity to carry out this disruptive activity not

only at official Party functions but also during social and

other contacts with CP members and leaders.

It is felt that.

if the informents are properly selected and briefed, there

should be no danger involved in such action on their part

gince all CP members have been encouraged by the naileral

Leadership to participate fully in current and fortioning

discussions.

Memorandum from Mr. J. H. Gale to Fir. Tolson dated 7/30/54

captioned "Investigation of Ku Klux Klan and other Hate Groups" was

approved by the Director authorizing the Domestic Intelligence

Division to give consideration to the application of counterintel-

ligence and disruptive tactics to hate groups and to thereafter

make appropriate recommendations.

It is our recommendation that

we immediately initiate a hard-hitting, closely supervised,

coordinated counterintelligence. program to expose, disrupt and

othervise neutralize the ku klux slan (KKK) and specified other

te groups.

This new counterintelligence effort will take advantage

of our experience with a variety of sophisticated techniques

successfully applied against the Communist Party, USA, and related

organizations since 1956.

Primarily, we intend

to expose to

scrutiny the devious maneuvers and duplicity of the hate

o public

•groups:

te frustrate any efforts or plans they may have to consolidate

their forces; to discourage their recruitment of new or youthful

adherents; and to disrupt or eliminate their efforts to circumvent

or violate the law.

Our counterintelligence efforts against hate

groups will be closely supervised and coordinated to complenent

our expanded intelligence investigations directed at these

organizations.

We are furnishing general instructions to 17 field

offices (14 Southern offices responsible for active investigation

of 17 Klan groups and 6 hate organizations,

and New York, Chicagoy

and Baltimore, who have active investigative responsibilities

for one hate organization each) relating to the administration

Briefly,

these instructions require the 17 participating offices

to submit to the Bureau on or before 10/15/64 an analysis of

forth a summary of current, possible, and successiully achieved

counterintelligence activity during the prior 3-month period.

Each office will be instructed to open and maintain a pending

Investigation relating to this program and to assign a Special

Agent on a part-time basis as the program coordinator responsible

for following and initiating counterintelligence action.

As is the instance in our established counterintelligence

program against the Communist Party, USA, land in our current 90-day

trial counterintelligence program directed against Soviet-Satellite

intelligence Tall recommended counterintelligence action against

Klan-type and hate organizations will be required to be approved

at the seat of Government.

This new counterintelligence program directed at Klan

and hate organizations will

be supervised at the Seat of Government

supervisory personnel responsible for the intelligence investigations

of the Klans and hate organizations and their membership. An annual

memorandum justifying continuance of the program will be submitted •

and the participating field offices will be periodically apprised

of techniques which have been found to be most successful. At

such time as the program is considered to be successfully under

way, a status memorandum will be submitted which will include any

additional recomnendations relating to manpower or other administrative

requirements.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1.

That the Domestic Intelligence Division be authorized

to immediately initiate a coordinated counterintelligence program

directed at exposing, disrupting and otherwise neutralizing the

17. active Klan organizations and 9 active racial hate organizations.

RE: COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAM

BLACK NATIONALIST-HATE GROUPS

BACKGROUND

By letter dated 8/25/87 the following offices

were advised of the beginning of a Counterintelligence

Program against militant Black Nationalist-Hate Groups:

Albany

Memphis

Atlanta

Newark

Baltimore

New Orleans

Boston

New York

Buffalo

Charlotte

Philadelphia

Phoenix

Chicago

Cincinnati

Pittsburgh

Richmond

Cleveland

St. Louis

Detroit

San Francisco

Jackson

Washington Field

Los Angeles

Each of the above offices was: to designate a

Special Agent to coordinate this program. Replies to this

letter indicated an interest in counterintelligence against

militant black nationalist groups that foment violence and

several offices outlined procedures which had been effective

in the past.

For example, Washington Field Office nad

furnished information about a new Nation of Islam (NOI)

grade school to appropriate authorities in the District

of Columbia who investigated to determine if

the school

conformed to District regulations for private schools. In

the process WFO obtained background information on the parents

of each pupil.

The Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM), a pro-

Chinese communist group, was active in Philadelphia, Pa.,

in the summer of 1967.

The Philadelphia Office alerted

local police, who then put RAM leaders under close scrutiny.

They were arrested on every possible charge until they could

no longer make bail. As a result, RAM leaders spent

most of the

summer in jail and no violence traceable to RAM took place.

The Counterintelligence Program is now being

expanded to include 41 offices.

Each of the offices added

to this program should designate an Agent familiar with black

nationalist activity, and interested in counterintelligence,

to coordinate this program.

This Agent will be responsible

for the periodic progress letters being requested, but each

Agent working this type of case should participate in the

formulation of counterintelligence operations.

GOALS

For maximun effectiveness of the Counterintelligence

Program,

and to prevent wasted effort, long-range goals are

being set.

1. Prevent the coalition of militant black

nationalist groups.

In unity there is strength; a truism

that is no less valid for all its triteness.

An effective

coalition of black nationalist groups night be the first

stey

toward a real "Mau lau" in America, the beginning of

a true black revolution.

2. Prevent the rise of a "messiah" who could

inity, and electrify, the militant black nationalist movement.

* Malcolm X might have

been such au

hessiah;he.is the-martya

and Elitan Hunanmed). a11

Muhammed)us tess of a threat because of his age. (king could

be a very

real contender for this position should he abandon

has the necessary charisma to be a real threat in this way.

3. Prevent violence on the part of black

nationalist groups.

This is of primary importance, and is,

. Of course, a goal of our investigative activity; it shouid

also be a

goal of the Counterintelligence Program.

Through

counterintelligence it should be possible to pinpoint potential

troublemakers and neuralize them before they exercise their

potential for violence.

4. Prevent militant black nationalist groups and

leaders from gaining respectability, by discrediting them

to three separate segments ot the community. The goal of

discrediting black nationalistsmust be handled tactically

in three ways.

You must discredit these groups and

individuals to, first, the responsible Negro community.

Second, they must be discredited to the white community,

RE: COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAM

-

both the responsible community and to "liberals" #ho have -

vestiges of sympathy for militant black nationalist simply

because they are Negroes.

Third, these groups must be

discredited in the eyes of Negro radicals, the followers

of the movement. This last area requires

entirely different

tactics from the first two. Publicity about violent tendencies

and radical statements merely enhances black nationalists

to the last group; it adds "respectability" in a different

way.

5. A final goal should be to prevent the long..

range growth of militant black nationalist organizations,

especially among youth. Specific tactics to prevent these

groups from converting

young people must be developed.

Besides these five goals counterintelligence is

a valuable part of our regular investigative program as it

often produces positive information.

TARGETS

Primary targets of the Counterintelligence Program,

Black Nationalist-Hate Groups, should be the most violent

and radical groups and their leaders. We should emphasize

those leaders and organizations that are nationwide in scope

and are most capable of disrupting this country. These

targets should include the radical and violence-prone

leaders, members, and followers of the:

Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) .

Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCIC,:

Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM) :

Nation of Islam. (NOI)

INSTRUCTIONS

Within 30 days of the date of this letter each otice

should:

1. Advise the Bureau of the identity of the Special

Agent assigned to coordinate this program.

Thereafter, on a ninety-day basis, each office

is to submit a progress letter summarizing counterintelligence

operations proposed during the period, operations effected,

and tangible results. Any changes in

RE: COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAM

BLACK NATIONALIST HATE GROUPS

The effectiveness of counterintelligence depends

on the quality and quantity of positive information

available regarding the target and on the imagination and

initiative of Agents working the program. The response of

the field to the Counterintelligence Program against the

Communist Party, USA, indicates that a superb job can be

done by the field on counterintelligence.

counterintelligence operations must be approved

by the Bureal.

Because of the nature of this program each

operation must be designed to protect the Bureau's interest

so that there is no possibility of embarrassment to the

Bureau.

Beyond this the Bureau will give every possible

consideration to your proposals.

PROGRAM

INTERNAL SECURITY

DISRUPTION OF THE NEN LEFT

Our Nation Is undergoing an era of disruption and

violence caused to a large extent by various individuals

generally connected with the New Left.

Some of these activists

urge revolution in America and call for the defeat of the

United™

States in Vietnam.

They continually and falsely allege

police

brutality and do not hesitate to utilize unlawful acts

to further their so-called causes.

The New Left has on many

occasions.

viciously and scurrilously attacked the Director

and the Bureau In an attempt to hamper our investigation of it

and to drive us off the college campuses. With this in mind,

it is our

recommendation that a new Counterintelligence Program

be designed to neutralize the New Left and the Key Activists.

The Key Activists are those individuals who are the moving

forces behind the New Left and on whom we have intensified our

investigations.

The purpose of this program is to expose, disrupt and

otherwise neutralize the activities of this group and persons

connected with it. It is hoped that with this new program

their violent and illegal activities may be reduced if not

curtailed.

General instructions are being furnished to all offices

relating to the purpose and administration of this new program.

Briefly, these instructions require all offices to submit an

analysis of possible counterintelligence operations on the New

Left and on the Key Activists on or before 6/1,68, including

any specific recommendations for action.

Thereafter, all

offices will submit a 90-day status letter setting forth a

SUBJECT

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAM -

INTERNAL SECURITY

(SOVIET-SATELLITE INTELLIGENCE)

Since initiated in 1956, the Counterintelligenceg (C

Program (Cointelpro), directed against the communist farty,

USA (CPUSA) , has had

continuing and cumulative successes in

exposing, disrupting and neutralizing the communists. T host

consideration should be given to applying the Cointelpro against

Soviet and Satellite espionage activities in the United States.

We desire to immediately embark upon a 90-day trial

program which will be participated in by the Chicago, New York

and Washington Field Offices to determine if we can successfully

direct our counterintelligence activities toward Soviet and

Satellite intelligence

activities. At the end of this. 90-day

trial period, we will evaluate our success and thereafter

submit recommendations relating to the feasibility of permanently

establishing this program against Soviet and Satellite intelligence

activities.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the attached airtel be forwarded

the Chicago;

New York and Washington Field Offices setting out instructions

for these offices to immediately devise and submit to the Bureau

theis recommendations for counterintelligence activity to be

directed against Soviet and Satellite intelligence activities

Re: COUNTERINTELLIGENCE - BORDER COVERAGE PROGRAM

Selection of Informants - An analysis of

the

available informants should

be made by each office

with counterintelligence potential in order to

select those informants who could be used for dis

ruptive tacties.

Each informant approved for use

in connection with counterintelligence operation

will, of course, have to be briefed individually on

issues and controversial subjects which are to be

raised.

The informants should not be told that there

is any over-all counterintelligence program or that

disrupcive tactics are being undertaken as a program

but each informant should be given the impression that

he is operating on an individual basis.

Bureau

approval must be obtained for the informants selected

for this operation before the informant is briefed.

In the event a review of the available informants

shows that additional informants with counterintelli

gonco possibilities ara needed. plans should be laid

to develop such informants, bearing in mind that

this is a long-range progran.

The analysis should

also include the adequacy of informants who can keep

the office effectively advised of the internal

operations of the organizations involved so that

disruptive tactics can be undertaken on a sound basis.

Organizational Tactics • consideration should be

given to placing informants in each opposing faction

of an organization to play one group against the

other. Consideration should be given to the possi

bility of having anonymous telephone invitations issued

to one group to attend open meetings of the other group;

possible use of press contacts on a cutout basis to

publicize derogatory remarks made by one group about

the other.

Psychological Tactics - Consideration should be

or magazine articles which could be clippedan

mailed to susceptible communist leaders eithon

in Mexico or in

should be prompt to furnish the bureau sufficient

copies of such articles for forwarding to interested

border offices so that if desirable, arrangements

can be made to have those articles anonymously mailed

to selected communist leaders locally or from some other

area in Mexico.

4. Neutralization of Individuals - Consideration

should be given

to tactics which would bring indi-

vidual communist leaders under suspicion of being

feliow communists.

The Bureau will consider any well-conceived plan

of causing disruption inside ine th or related organizations.

In any counterintelligence operation, however, it is impera-

tive that the office submitting the recommendations make

sure

that it will not jeopardize informant coverage or cause

embarrassment to the Bureau.

Consideration should be given to the possibility

of setting up thoroughly safe cutout arrangenents for con-

tacts with

good newspaper sources through which information

can be fed to the press regarding semipublic procommunist

meetings or communist domination of front groups and through

which information can be fed to the press to produce bad

publicity relative to cl activities. Any proposals to set

up such an arrangement must be submitted to the Bureau for

approval before implementing them.

The Bureau appreciates the fact that Albuquerque,

through absolute lack of communist activity, is not in a

position to implement a counterintelligence program; however,

a copy of this communication is being sent forinformation oi

that office.

State Committee of the CP of Mexico.

this line will be referred by the Bureau to the Legal Attache's

office, Mexico, for comment to insure thai such tactics will

Chihuahua State Committee.

Both El Paso and San Antonio should give con-

sideration to the possibility of using discrediting techniques

in connection with individual communists who, although not

active members of the ce, are a threat to the security of

the United States in order to bring out into the open their

communist sympathies and destroy their potential usefulness

as Soviet intelligence agents or to neutralize their propa

ganda value to the communist movement..

The Phoenix Office should

give consideration to

the possible use of disruptive tactics to further divide the pro-

communist groups in their area and to sharpen antagonisms

without

Consider the use of anonymous letters where

disparaging statements are made by one leader against another.

The Agents concerned with this matter in the Few York:

It appears that in Puerto Rico the most imediate target

of international communist is to influence the Federacion de

San Juan should, therefore,

consider tactics designed to lessen communist influance in the FLI

NOTE ON YELLOW:

There has been an increasing boldness apparent in the

through other than lawful,

peaceful means. Because of their

utter disregard of the will of the majority, the nationalist,

conmunist and/or Soviet desire to embarrass

the United States,

and the courage given to the cause by Castro's Cuba, a more posi-

tive effort must be made, not only to curtail,

but to disrupt, the

activities of those organizations.

Bulet 8-4-60 instructed

San Juan and New York to furnish the Bureau their observations

and suggestions.

San Juan and New York have furnished general

observations and have indicated that such a progran may be

feasible.

This is not a program of harrassment,

PURPOSE:

10

The purpose of this memorandum is to recommend a

long-range counterintelligence program designed to provoke

a1

dispute between the Communist Party, USA, and La Cosa Nostra

under the code name of Hoodwink.

OBJECTIVES:

A dispute between the Communist Party, USA,

and

La Cosa Nostra would cause disruption of both groups

having each expend their energies, time, and money attacking

the other. This would help neutralize

the activities of both

groups which are detrimental to this country.

BACKGROUND:

La Cosa Nostra has no sympathy for the communists.

The Communist Party, USA, and La Cosa Nostra come in contact

I! with each other in the labor field where hoodlums operate

businesses under "sweatshop" conditions. By making it appear

that the Party is attacking hoodlum labor practices, over a

period of time we could provoke a bitter dispute between the

two organizations.

The New York Office has recommended a specific

technique to initiate this program. This technique consists

of anonymously forwarding one leaflet to a local La Cosa Nostra

leader attacking the labor practices of one of his enterprises.

The leaflet would ostensibly be published by a local Party

unit.

A note with the leaflet would give

the impression that

It has received wide circulation REC 10

the above action has constituted

harrassment rather

than aisruption, since, Ior the most part

the Bureau has set up particular incidents, and the attack has

been from the outside.

At the present time, nowever, there is

lexisting within the CP a situation resulting fron the develop

menis ai the 20üh Congress on tho CP ci the Soviet Union and

ine Goverment's attaci un the Party principally thrcuga

prosecutions under the Smith Act of 1940 and

• the internal

Security Act of 1950 which is made to order for an all-out:

them the SWP philosophy.

This SWP program could very definitely

benefit the Bureau provided we can achieve through our informant

coverage in the SWP some degree of control and direction over it.

The ultimate goal would be to continue and intensify pressure on

• the CP fron the left. Since the Party is already under pressure

from the right, tha combined pressure would contribute materially

to distracting

the CP from its primary goas.

ACTION: A memorandum, together with a letter to the

15 offices having SiP activity in the U. S., is attached, sounding

out these offices through their SiP informants as to the

possibility

of Initiating several specific steps aimed at the Bureau's

furthering, assisting and possibly adding to: the current SWP

disruptive

program,

• 2) The CP national convention is scheduled to be held

during February 1957.

At the present time there appear to be 4

separate views within the CP leadership as to the degree of change to

be made in the organization and program of the CP, USA.

The Party

nas publicly announced that the theory of democratic centralism

has been modified and that each CP member has the right to

express his views as to the past mistakes and future path of

communism In the U. So Preliminary material for the draft

resolution for the national convention has been prepared and is

being discussed on a national level prior to being sent to the

varlous districts for preconvention discussions on a local level.

ACTION: A memorandum, together with a letter to 12 key

offices 1s being prepared, requesting these offices to submit to

of certain informants who will be

briefed and instructed to embark on a disruptive program within

their own clubs, sections, districts or even on a nationallevel.

These Informants will raise objections and doubts as to the success

of any proposed plan of action by the CP leadership. They will.

seize every opportunity to carry out the disruptive activity not

aary at meetings, conventions, et vetera, but also during social

ana owner contacts with le members and leaders. It is

requesting intormati on

as to the view points oi the national ana

appears to lavor. This information can be used by the various

It is pointed out that the informants chosen

members to participate in the current discussions.

3) Recently,

a national CP leader

suggested that

iz..

prepare and distribute a document calling for

an exchange of opinions by individuals interested in forming a

This is the first step taken by the CP in

forming a new

¡has prepáred a document which criticizes the absence of

Soviet Union. It further urges that European

satellite nations be free fron Soviet domination. The CP hores

I to mollify his criticism of the Soviet Union

before the document is released. At the same time the CP feels

that some mild criticisn of the Soviet Union and the Cr, Usa, wil

be beneficial in gaining noncommunist support Ior

proposal.

ACTION: This plan of the CP may create a situation

which would lend itself to a disruptive operation by the Bureau.

Memorandum for MI. Boardman

4) When the CP underground was put in operation on a

large scale In 1951, CP leaders decided after extensive study,

that underground personnel should either disregard their tax.

obligations or file under false names.

ACTTON: We have obtained from the field, the names and

current addresses of foruer underground leaders with a view toward

furnishing them to the Internal Revenue Service (TS) POT

appropriate action. A memorandum has gone through (August 28,

1955) recommending that the names and current address of 102:

such leaders, all of whom nave suith Act ramifications, be

transmitted to the Depariment anâ the Department be requested

to advise if there is any objection to the Bureau furnishing this

material to IRS. If there is no objection, the Bureau proposes

to transmit the names and addresses to IRs ria Liaison for

appropriate action.

We will then lollow IRs very closely since

IRS action should: (1) uncover the aliases and nereabouts, iron

1951 to 1954, of these subjects who actually filed returns under

allases and aimit such action, or (2) result in possible

prosecution of those subjects no did

not file returns or who

•Jefuse

to furnish details if they did file. It is believed that

action by IRs at this time would deal

a further devastating blow

at the CP and would certainly reflect very unfavorably on the

Party leadership for the instructions issued in 1951. :

OBSERVATIONS:

We are going ahead with the 4 courses of action listed

pin this memorandum. A detailed memorandum is attached covering

the SWP angle; a memorandum has gone through separately covering

the first phase of the ins

angte, and a detailed memorandum

covering the alsruptive program by contadential informants is

belag prepared as is a memorandum covering the

phase.

For the present, our disruptive tactics will, of

necessity, be general in nature, that is, along the line of

"keeping the pot boiling.". The

time may come, however, wheI

It will be desirable to direct our disruptive

Each of the above offices was: to designate a

Special Agent to coordinate this program. Replies to this

letter indicated

an interest in counterintelligence against

militant black nationalist groups that foment violence and

several offices outlined

procedures which had been effective

in the past.

For example,

Washington Field Office had

furnished information about a new Nation of Islam (NOI)

grade school to appropriate authorities in the District

of Columbia who investigated to determine if the school

conformed to District regulations for private schools. In

the process NFO obtained background information on the parents

of each pupil.

In the summer of 1957. The Philadelphia Office alerted

local police, who then put RAll leaders under close scrutiny.

They were arrested on every possible charge until they could

no longer make bail.

As a result, RAll leaders spent most of the

to coordinate this program.

This Agent will be responsible

for the periodic progress letters being requested, but each

Agent working this type of case should participate in

formulation of counterintelligence operations.

GOALS

For maximum effectiveness of the Counterintelligênce

Program,

and to prevent wasted effort, long-range goals are

being set.

I. Prevent the coalition of militant black

nationalist

groups.

In unity there

is strength; a truism

that is no less valid for all its triteness.

An effective

coalition of black nationalist groups right be the first

step toward a real "lau lau" in America, the beginning of

a true black revolution.

unify, and electrify, the militant black nationalist movement.

(nonviolence) and embrace black nationalism.

has the necessary charisna to be a real, threat in this way.

3. Prevent violence on the part of black

nationalist groups. This is.of primary importance, and is,

of course, a goal of our investigative activity; it should

also be a

goal of the Counterintelligence Program.

Through

counterintellizence it should be possible to pinpoint potential

troublenakers and neuralize them before they exercise their

potential lor violence.

4. Prevent militant black nationalist groups and

leaders fron gaining respectability, by discrediting them

to three separate segments of the community.

The goal of

discrediting black nationalismust be handled tactically

in three ways.

You must discredit these groups and

Individuals to, first, the responsible Negro community.

Second, they must be discredited to the white community,

because they are negroes.

Third, these groups must be

discredited in

the eyes of Negro

radicals, the follovers

of the novement. This last area requires entirely diffcrent

tactics from the first two. Publicity about violent tencencies

and radical statements merely enhances black nationalists

to the last group; it adds "respectability" in a different.

way.

5. A final goal should be to prevent the long-

range growth of militant black nationalist organizations,

especially anong youth. Specific tactics to prevent these.

groups from converting young people must be developed. •

Besides these five goals counterintelligence is

& valuable part of our regular investigative program as it

often produces positive information.

TARGETS

Primary

targets of the Counterintelligence Program,

Black Nationalist-Hate Groups, should be the most violent

and radical groups and their leaders. He should emphasize

those leaders and organizations that are nationwide in scope

and are most capable of disrupting this country. These

targets should include the radical and violence-prone

leaders, members, and followers of the:

Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) .

Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC)

Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM)

Nation of Islam (NOI)

......

should be alert for counterintelligence suggestions.

INSTRUCTIOYS

RE: COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAM

BLACK NATIONALIST-HATE GROUPS

The effectiveness of counterintelligence depends

on the quality and quantity of positive information

available regarding the target and on the imagination and

initiative of Agents working the program. The response of

the field to the Counterintclligence Program against the

Communist Party, USA, indicates that a superb job can be

done by the field on counterintelligence.

Counterintelligence operations must be approved

by the Bureau.

Because of the nature of this program each

operation must be designed to protect the Bureau's interest

so that there is no possibility of embarrassment to the

Bureau.

Beyond this the Bureau will give every possible

consideration to your proposals.

recommendation that a new Counterintelligence Program

be designed

The Key Activists are those individuals who are the moving

forces behind the New Left and on whom we have intensified our

investigations.

The purpose of this program is to expose, disrupt and

otherwise neutralize the activities of this group and persons

connected with it.

It is hoped

that with this new program

their violent and illegal:

activities may be reduced if not

curtailed.

General instructions are being furnished to all offices

relating to the purpose and administration of this new progran.

Briefly, these instructions require all offices to submit an

analysis of possible counterintelligence operations on the New

Leit and on the Key Activists on or before 6/1/68, including

any specific recommendations for action. Thereafter, all

offices will submit a 90-day status letter setting forth a

INTERNAL SECURITY

(SOVIET-SATELLITE INTELLIGENCE)

Since Initiated in 1956, the Counterintelligence

Program (Cointelpro), directed against the Conmunist Party,.

USA (CPUSA), has had continuing and cumulative successes in

exposing, cisrupting and neutralizing the communists.

We now believe

consideration should be given to applying the Cointelpro against

soviet and Satellite espionage activities in the United States.

Te desire to immediately embark upon a 90-day trial

program which will be participated in by the Chicago, New York:

and Washington Field Offices to determine if we can successfully

direct our counterintelligence activities tovard Soviet and

Satellite intelligence activities.

At the end of this 90-day

Exial period, me will evaluate our success and thereafter

submit reconmendations relating to the leasibility of permanently

establishing this program against Soviet and Satellite intelligence

activities.

RECOLLENDATION:

That the attached airtel be

(RESEARCH SECTION)

HEREIN IS DNDSECSTFIEL

DATE LO DHOOBY'S PEZALMiG

The Bureau would like to offer for your consideration

a proposal for a disruntive-disinforration operation targeted

against the national office of the black Panther Party (Lop).

This proposal is not intended to be all inclusive or binding

• In any of its various phases, but only is a guide

for the.

suggested action. You are encouraged to submit recommendations

relating to revisions or innovations of the proposal.

3. The operation would be effected through close

coordination on a high level with the Oakland or San Francisco

Police Desertuent.

2. Xerox copies of true documents, docmonts subtly

incorporating alve inforantion and entiroly inbriertod docuients

would be periodically anonynously nailed to

the residence of

key Panther leader.

These documents would be on the stationcry

and

in the form used by the police copartment or by the rei in

disseninting iniormation to the police. "jI documents, ween:

used, rould contain police routing or date received notations,

(learly indicating they had been pilfered fron police files.

*3.

An attempt would be made to five the Panthor

racipient the inpression the documents were stolen fron police

files by a disgruntled police enployce sympathetic to the

Panthers.

After initiul nailings, brief

notes by the alleged

disgruntled engloyce souid be included with the mailed docuents.

These notes would indicate the notive and sympathy of the police

employee, his bitterness against his departuent, and possibly

& request

for money.

4.

Depending on developments,

ãt a propitious tine,

consideration would be riven to establimity aunt office bos

or othor suitable "drop" address for the use of the alloged

disgruntlou erployce to

receive responomiunus pase/or

specifications rointing to the coctents from the Panthers..

stances might varrant the use of such a source for face-to-lace

acetings with the Panthers.

During carly stages of the operation.

an ellort should be made to locate and brief a suitable police

enployce to play the role of the alleged disgruntled employee.

6.

A wide variety. of alleged authentic police or

of this proposal logically

could not help but disrupt and conjuse, Panther activities.

Even if they vere to suspact iBI or folice involvement, they

attention through this channel. The operation would affoid

us a continuing neans to zurnish the Panüher leadership true

information which is to our interest that they know and

disinformation nich, in their interest, they may not ignore.

Although this proposal is a relatively simple

technique, 1t has been applied with excoptional results in

another area of intciligence intorest whore the targst was ci

far grenter sophistication. The Bureau oclieves with carcill

planning this technique has excellent long-range potential

to disrupt and curiaii Fanthor activity.

DATE 10) 23/00 3/SP2 MITTE

• PURPOSE:

The purpose of this memorandum is to recommend a

long-range counterintelligence program designed to provoke a

dispute between the Communist Party, USA, and La Cosa Nostre

under the code name of Hoodwink.

OBJECTIVES:

A dispute between the Communist Party, USA, and

La Cosa Nostra would cause disruption of both groups by

having

each expend their energies, time, and money attacking

the other. This would help neutralize the activities of both

groups which are detrimental to this country.

BACKGROUND:

La Cosa Nostra has no sympathy for the communists.

The Communist Party, USA, and La Cosa lostra come in contact

I! With each other in the labor field where hoodlums operate

businesses under "sweatshop" conditions. By making it appear

that the Party is attacking hoodlum labor practices, over a

period of time we could provoie a bitter dispute between the

two organizations.

The New York Office has recommended a specific

technique to initiate this program. This technique consists

of anonymously lorwarding one learlet to a local la Coar nostra

leader attacking the labor practices of one of his enterprices.

The leaflet would ostensibly ve published by a local Party

unit.

A note with the leaflet would give the impression that

It has received wide circulation

ReNT}et captioned "Communist Party, USA; Counter-

intelligence Program; IS - C; (La Cosa Nostra)," dated

9/22/65.

Hoodwink is the code word designated

for this

program.

Ney fork is authorized to nail the anonymous letter

and leaflet set out in relet as the beginning of & long-range

program to cause a dispute between la Cosa Nostra (ICN)

and

the Connunist Party, USA (CPUSA). To strengther this alleged

attack, add & last sentence to the leaflet:

"Let's show

the hoodlums and the bosses that the workers are united

against syeatshops."

rake the usual precautions to insure this matling

cannot be associated with the Bureau and advise of tangible

results. New York should also submit lolloy-up recommendations

to continue this program.

The Party has been the subject of recent bonbingo

& typical

hoodlum technique.

Consider a spurious Farty.

'statement blaming the ICh for the bombings because of

"Party efforts on behalf of the workers." This statements

could be ained at specific loN nenbers i appropriate.

MIn developing this program, thought should also be

given to initiating spurious ICN

attacks on the CPUSA, so that

each i

group would think the other vas nounting & canpaign

agalast it.

The Buresu very much appreciates New York's careful

analysis of this program and the initial "lor-key" technique

suggested.
