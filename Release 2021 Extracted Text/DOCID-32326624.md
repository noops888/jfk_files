The enclosed memorandum has been classified$

"SECRET" since the disclosure of the data could result

in serious damage to the United States and could have

a bearing on our National Delense.

In addition, the

unauthorized disclosure of the information contained

in the memorandum may result in the identirication o1

a source who represents good double agent potential

and could possibly compromise his future effectiveness.

The individual who furnished SANCHEZ the

Intormation IS MANUEL PRIETO, known as Manolo Prieto,

and as "Chiquitico", who is the Secretary of the

Triple A in New York. His identity was not set forth

because to do so may possibly result in the identification

long discussion with SANCHEZ.

A new case is being opened on PRIETO and

information concerning him furnished by SANCHEZ, will

be set out in PRIETO's case file.
