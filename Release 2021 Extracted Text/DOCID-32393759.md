3. Duriag saview of GAIN's Security file, I noted a message

regarding him from Mexico City, on 25 April 1962, which mentioned

a "Willard ANDREWS, reputable American businessman in Mexico,"

who obviously had had contact of some kind with GAIN, as woll as with.

a CIA representative in Mesico to whom ANDREWS had commented that

CAIN claims to have been with OSS during W. W. II lAcopy of this memo-

randam is attached). In answer to this message which requested traces

on GAIN, Headquarters, in furnishing limited information obtained regard-

ing him, advised that neither his claimed employment by OSS, sor a claira

he made to have worked with Task Force Vi, could be substantiated. The

Station was advised that he did have (or. had had) a legitimato detective

laboratory in Chicago:

5. The flixtims CAIN came to the attention oi the Security Office

was when the Mexico Station requested traces on him. Their request

stemmed from an naannounced visit he made to the Statios, during which

he stated that he had an investigative agency in Marico with branches in

Chicago and Los Angeles. He had also stated that his agency in Mexico:

was for the purpose of training Mexican Government agents in police

methods, is Investigative techniques, and in the uss of the lie detectori

and had added that he was investigating Communism in a certain unnamed

Central American country.

12. During the time COHEN was a CIA employee (1949-1963), he

was of concera to the Security Office, due priscipally to the activities:

and proclivities of his wife; Rita C. Heller COHEN, #MS-3185, the f0x-

mor wifs of Irving ROTH, #MS-2001 R. COHEN was the subject of an

Employment Raview Board case in 1956; and in 1956 was disqualified .

a3 a member oi the Junior Career Development Program. It was then

dacided to put hira on a job in FBIS in which he would not be exposed to

highly sensitive roatarial. At the time of his resignation, he was an

I. O. Contact; GS-14, in the Chicago Office of the DDI/OQ Contact

Division.

13. Ia January 1965, tha DCS requested approval to contact

COHEN on an ad hoe basis to participate in tho brialing and debriefing

of his employer, Seator PERCI, who planned an extessive tour of the

Far East. In June 1957, MT. George CART, Lagislative Counsel,

requested a check on COHON stating that there may be occasion to brief

him frors time to time. According to Mr. CARY, COHEN would be

briefed generally on the build up in Cuba but would not ba exposed to
