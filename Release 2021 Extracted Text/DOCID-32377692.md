SUBJECT : Flights from Mexico City to Havana on 22 liovember 1953

REFERENCE: 1. What is the total ClA information on the two flights

from Mexico City to Hayana?

2. What was done at the time to develop further information

on this matter?

3. Can further information be acquired on this matter now?

...

FINDINGS:

1. The Mexico Station records confirm only one flight from Mexico City

to Havana on 22 November 1963. This was the regularly scheduled Cubana

Airlines flight.

there were two reports of small aircraft fliants long

1 twin engine flight to Mexico City connecting with Cubana for onwaro

transportation to Havana of a mysterious passenger; and the other a flight

allegedly from Dallas, Tijuana, and lexico City to Havana with two "gang-

landa type passengers.) Beyond the original reports (from sources of

undetermined reliability) there was nothing in the Mexico Station records

to substantiate that these flights occurred.

2. Facts substantiated by Mexico Station records: On 22 Novenber

1963 a Cubana Airlines plane from Havana arrived at the Mexico City Inter-

national airport at 1620 hours - Mexico City time and departed on a return

flight to Havana at 2035 hours - Mexico City time. It was on the ground in

Mexico City for about four hours which would be considered normal for servicing

for a turn-around flight carrying passengers in both directions. This infor-

mation was obtained from sensitive telephone taps in the process of routine

operating procedures on 22 lovember 1953.

3. Report not substantiated by líexico Station records: On 30 November

1963 CIA Headquarters cabled Mexico City that a report had been received

that the 22 November 1963 Cubana departure had been delayed five hours from

1700 to 2200 hours awaiting an important passenger who arrived at the lexico

City airport in a private twin notor aircraft at 2130 hours l'exico tire.

Passenger transferred directly to Cubana plane without going through customs

or inmigration and travelled in pilot's cabin to Havana.

2! This infomation

was passed to the Mexican officials on 2 December 1963 for investigation.

There is no record of a reply.

We know from independent information in

paragraph tio above that some parts of this report are in error.

flight was not delayed for five hours. It had departed for Havana from

Mexico City at 2035 hours which would be at least an hour before the twin

motor aircraft was alleged to have arrived in Mexico City.

name is on the manifest as a passenger from Mexico City to Havana but the

tine supplied by him does not agree sith other information considered reliable.
