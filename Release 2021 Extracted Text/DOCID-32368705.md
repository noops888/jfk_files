SUBJECT: Senate Select Committee Requests for Witnesses

on Operational Substance -- Issues Raised

The Senate Select Committee has not yet actually

scheduled DDO staffers who are now on active duty, but a

specific request has been made to talk with James Kelly

Of EA Division regarding the assassination plot against

Chou en Lai. The SSC has also expressed interest in

several DO staffers, including Robert Owen and Nestor

Sanchez of LA Division, Arnold Silver, currently a Lareer

Associate, and Bronson

Tweedy, who is on short-term contract

in Headquarters.

We have been able to hold off actual

scheduling of substantive operational conversations pending

a resolution on how to handle covert action material.

Division is standing by to appear for a non-operational

briefing covering organization, mission, etc.

2. Attached hereto is a Senate Select Committee

document entitled "Outline for Inquiry Procedures" which

represents the Committee's own ground rules.

3. According to this attachment, witnesses or

interviewees will. fall into two categories:

a. Those discussing information on the structure

and functions of CIA plus substantive work,

including the legal basis of DDO activity and

the approval process; the capacities of CIA

and its responsibility to provide information

for other government entities. In this category,

a CIA representative may be present at the inter-

b.

Those who will be asked questions regarding CIA

or Executive Branch abuses or other controversial,

specific matters where improprieties may have

occurred. In this category, a CIA representative

may not be present unless an exception is negotiated.
