planted in the back of COOK's residence, on his 26-foot cruiser,

which totaly destroyed this craft. Informant advised that "MOONEY"

ordered these last two bombings against COOK and that FRANK

Informant advised that because of dissatisfaction

against COOK involved his holding out on some $300,000 in rare

coins which COOK had taken in a series of burglaries over the

past several months.

Regarding other bombings, the informant stated that
