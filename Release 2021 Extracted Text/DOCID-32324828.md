unless requested by Las Vegas:

Prior investigation regarding WILLIAM "BILLY"

however, their activities will be followed through

Pittsburgh informants and any information developed

will be furnished to Las Vegas and Newark, as well as the

Bureau.

For the information of Las Vegas, PG-696-PC

has stated in the recent past that he desires to obtain

$5,000, which will make it possible for him to accept an

offer made to him by "FOOTS" ARCADIA for the purchase of

a restaurant-gambling casino at Boulder City, Nevada.

Also, for the information of Las Vegas, the

"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette," a Pittsburgh newspaper, dated

8/12/64, contained an article captioned,

"3 Pittsburghers

Seek Nevada Casino Shares."

The article in effect stated

that three Pittsburgh men have applied to the Nevada Gaming

Commission for shares in

a new casino to be opened in Las

Vegas next fall.

These individuals have been identified as

GABRIEL RUBIN,

HERBERT S. COHEN, and Attorney

"DAVID KAUFMAN.

In addition,

the Associated Press reports that three persons

already are

licensed to open the casino next fall.

They

include Mayor A. RIDDLE,

his wife, NORMA, and Attorney LOUIS WEINER, Jr.
