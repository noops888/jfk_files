Mr.

dated 5 September 1976

Action Required:

Mone.

This memorandum is for your information.

We have also

attached at A a suggested draft reply to Mr. de Mohrenschildt's letter.

Action Taken:

We have reviewed DDO and IG files on Mr. de Mohrenschildt:

addition, at our request, the CI Staff has run Agency traces on him and

has been

in touch with the FBI as well.

Findings:

3. There is voluminous material on Mr. de. Mohrenschildt in CIA

files, most of it dating from the post-Kennedy assassination period

when he testified before the Warren Commission on his acquaintance

with Mir. and firs. Lee Harvey Oswald. (A copy of the de Mohrenschildis'

testimony is attached at B.)

The bulk of the material in our files consists. of FBi reports,

the most recent of which is dated 1967.

The FBI has informed CIA that

it has no traces on Mr. de Mohrenschildt beyond that date; our files

contain all of its previous material on him.

history of Mr. Moore's relationship with Mr. de lohrenschildt from 1957

to 1961 is also attached at C.

As a routine matter, Mr. Moore requested

traces on Mir. de Mohrenschildt. The trace results (attached at D)

con-

tained sufficient derogatory information to preclude further extensive

contact with the de Monrenschildts.

(An OS summary on tir. de Mohrenschildt

prepared in response to the current request is also attached at D.)

Our files: show that a mail cover was placed on letters addressed

to. Mr. de Mohrenschildt c/o the U.S. Embassy in Haiti from about 1964 to

1966 (This was probably not uncovered at the time of the external in-

svestigations.) This included opening and photographing the contents of

asked what Mr. Moore knew about. Oswald and what he may have told Mr. de

The most recent information we.have on Mr. de. Mohrenschildt comes

from Mr. J. Walton lioore who was contacted in May and July 1976 by writers

connected with the Reader's Digest, and with the Dial Press and the Dell

Publishing Company.

Both writers questioned Mr. Moore about Oswald and

Mr. de Mohrenschildt. Mir. Moore's reports on these contacts are attached

raised serious questions.

Certainly his relationship with the

Oswalds has caused him considerable trouble and may have caused this

Agency and the FBI to spend more time and energy. on him in the past

than was necessary.

Both the FBI and this Agency, however, had dropped their

interests in Mr..

de Mohrenschildt's activities

We speculate that any attention he is now receiving could

either be from local authorities in Dallas or from media representa-

of President Kennedy.

Mr. Moore's reports attached at F.

What we can say is that we have

no indication that either CIA or the FBI has taken any active

interest in Mr. de liohrenschildt in recent years.
