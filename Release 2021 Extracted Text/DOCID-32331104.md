ADMINISTRATIVE:

The period of this report exceeds 90 days inasmuch

as NYO has been designated as

the Office of Origin by the

Bureau on 12/3/65. 4

The following information is not being included in

instant report inasmuch as it would most likely compromise

the informant: l1

On 12/14/65, NY 3610-C-TE advised SA CHARLES G.

DONNELLY that CHARLIE WHITE entered surgical Hospital at

7oth st. and York Ave. on Sunday, 12/5/65, as a charity

patient.

He stated that CHARLIE

wanted no publicity and he

did not want anybody to know where he was; that is why he went

in as a charity patient. He stated that only he and one NAT

MODELL are the only ones who know where CHARLIE iS. He stated

that since he went in as a charity patient, he is being handled

by doctors of the hospital and not by his own personal physician.

Infomant will see him on 12/15/55, and will advised if any-

body else other than he and NAT know where CHARLIE is.U

On 12/17/65, NY 3610-C-TE advised SAS CHARLES G.

DONNELLY and PAUL G.

DURKIN that CHARLIE WHITE returned home

to his apartment in

NYC from Surgical Hospital on 12/16/65.

while in the hospital, WHItE was brought food by a fellow

named JOE (LNU), who, at one time, was very closely associated

with either FRANK ERICKSON Or JOE

ADONIS.

To date, informant

has determined that the only persons who were aware of wHITe's

presence in Surgical Hospital are himself, TOMMY NELSON and

NAT MODELL.

HAROLD KONIGSBERG, who currently is in US Medical

correctional institute, Danbury, Connecsicut, by sAS JAMes: u.

MC ANDREW and PAUL G. DURKIN on

KONIGSBERG said that even though CHARLIE "The

Blade" TOURINE and GYP DE CARLO are members of the same

"family," years ago DE CARLO wanted "The Russian' killed.

"The Russian" is GEORGE VAINTRAUB, who works with CHARLIE

in bust-out games.

However, KONIGSBERG declined to handle this

contract.

In the event the contract was accepted, DE CARLO

wanted it to appear as if CHARLIE "The Blade"

was

the one

who was responsible for the killing.

Supposedly, "The Russian"

was in a game where AI MONaS was busted out.

KONIGSBERG pointed out that whenever he dealt with

a person he was always attempting to crassify him as weak or

strong.

Based on certain incidents and reputations, he

classified CARMINE TRAMUNTI, aka "Gribbs"; TONY GORALLO, aka

"Tony Ducks"

and CHARLIE TOURINE as strong, and SAM RIZZO

(DE CAVALCANTE) as being very weak.

and

KONIGSBERG on 8/4/65, advised SAS ROBERT V. WALKER

PAUL G. DURKIN that JOE ZICARELLI did not become a "made

guy" in 'La Cosa Nostra" until 1955. He explained that most

likely he would have been "made"

in an earlier year; however,

GYP DE CARLO, CHARLIE WHITE (TOURINE) and LILO GALANTE were

all attempting to get ZICARELLI in their respective crews.

After much haggling, GALANTE finally won out.

KONIGSBERG

added that

ZICARELLI was actually close to all three of these

persons.
