PROJECT LIFEAT

PROJECT REVIEW

JULY 62 tHRU MAY 63

I. Produot of the Project

• A. Soviet Coverage

Prolect IIFEAT has not provided coverage of the entire Soviet officiel

Installation in Mexico City since 22 June 1960 when Proleat TENVOY

assumed this responsibility. This freed LIFEAT to provide, with its

unilateral coverage, home phones of selected Soviet officials which

could better support not only the Station's CE effort but also other

station operations against the Soviet target. In this effort, LIFEAT

covered the homes of four of the more active Soviet Intelligence

Officers stationed in Mexico during the reporting period. Samples

of the operational information provided by LIFEAT follows:

HMM-6479, 15 June 1962 (Mexican Winners of Soviet Scholarships

to Patrice Lamunba University)

HMMA-19826, 21 September 1962 (Transmittal of LIFEAT Report -

Vladilan I. SAMOKHIN)

HMMA -19839, 21 September 1962 (Transmittal of LIFEAT Report -

Aleksandr G. SIDOROV)

HMMA -19879, 28 September 1962 (Aleksandr G. SIDOROV Tatiaya

SOKOLOVSKAYA)

HMMA - 19996, 12 October 1962 (Soviet Personnel Assigned to Mexico

City)

B. LIFEAT has remained a primary source on this target throughout the

past project year.

Further, LIFEAT Information is considered a

fruitful source of operational leads by the responsible Case Officer.

Selected examples of the valuable intelligence product derived from

the Polish coverage are:

HMMA -19500, 3 August 1962 (BECHICK Telecon)

HMMA -20896, 15 March 1963 (BEKNAVE Status Report)

HMMA -19552, 10 August 1962 (BEKNAVE-BECHICK)

HMM-7270, 14 May 1963, (Polish Ambassador to Mexico to Present

credentials to Haitian Government.

C. Yugoslav Coverage

LIFEAT coverage of the Yugoslav official installation in Mexico City

has provided a wealth of information on the contacts, activities, and

travel of members of that mission.

Since the Station's effort against

this target was greatly increased

within the last year, LIFEAT infor-

mation has been used extensively to provide the basic operational and

tion on this target are as follows:

HMMA-19311, 10 July 1962 (Activity of the CP of Yugoslavia in

Mexico City)

HMMA-19344, 13 July 1962 (Yugoslav Embassy Mexico City)

HUMA - 19653, 24 August 1962 (Miodrag RADOVIC)

HMMA -19609, 24 August 1962 (Yugoslav Travel)

HYMA-19973, 9 October 1962 (Djordje VUJIC)

HMMA -20016, 11 October 1962 (Gustav VLAHOV)

HMM-6993, 8 February 1963 (Projected Travel to Yugoslavia of

Emilio Portes Gil)

HMM-7005, 8 February 1963 (Plan of Adolfo Lopez Mateos to Visit

Yugoslavia)

HMM-7011, 12 February 1963 (Possibility of New Mexican-Yugoslav

Commercial Aid Treaty)

HMM-7106, 19 March 1963 (Yugoslav Project to Promote Economic

Relations with Mexico)

HMMA - 21005, 29 March 1963 (Zdenko HAS)

HMM-7310, 24 May 1963. (Plan for Tito to sign. New Mexican-Yugoslav

Cultural Agreement During his visit to Mexico)

D. Cuban Coverage

During the reporting period LIFEAT coverage of the Cuban target was

directed toward the support, of KUBARK operations in this field and was

not designed to provide positive intellirence: LIFEAT covered a total

of 10 lines in direct support of operations in this field. Most of

the product of this area of operation was forwarded by cable to JMWAVE

and Headquarters. Examples of pouch communications in this field are:

HMMA-20032, 16 October 1962 (AMSTRUT/LIFEAT Coverage)

HMMA -20308, 4 December 1962 (AMSTRUT)

HIMMA-20425, 28 December 1962, (Jose ORDOQUI)

E. American, Communist Group in Mexico (ACGM)

As noted in past project reviews, most of the targets in this group

have been covered at the request

of ODENVY, and the raw take has been

processed by them. Luring the period July 1962 through May 1963

approximately 390 reels of take were passed to the local ODENVY for

their processing. On 23 August 1962 the local ODENVY advised, "This

office feels the coverage mentioned is quite valuable and many useful

leads are obtained from this coverage, particularly with regard to

travel in and out of Mexico of American Communists who are in contact

with individuals on whom coverage is maintained". Typical examples

of reporting based on LIFEAT coverage of the ACGM are:

HMMA-19531, 10 August 1962 (Albert MALIZ; Noah SEBORER, Charles

SMALL.)

HMMA -19678, 24 August 1962 (Albert MALTZ-Margaret MALTZ)

HNMA-19771, 7 September 1962 (Albert MALTZ and Charles SMALL)

HMMA-20937, 22 March 1963 (Albert MALTZ, Noah SEBORER, Charles

SMALL

HMMA-21299, 7 May 1963 (Charles SMALL and Noah SEBORER)

F. Exile and Revolutionary Activities

During the past year this area of activity, in addition to the already

noted Cuban coverage, accounted for the greatest percentage of the

LIFEAT effort. Most of the information provided by LIFEAT In 1ts

coverage of targets in this area was not available from other sources.

While Coverage has been provided on Spanish Republican, Guatemalan,

Costa Rican, and Nicaraguan exiles, the bulk of this product has

resulted from the coverage of Juan Jose AREVALO Bermejo and various of

his acquaintances, the "take" being forwarded to Headquarters and Station

Guatemala by either weekly cable summaries or immediate action cables

when warranted. It is noted that the coverage has been most rewarding

in the case of AREVALO and the recent coverage of Judith FERRETO Segura.

Examples of productivity in this area:

HMM-6452, 3 June 1962 (Contacts of Juan Jose AREVALO in Mexico)

HMM-6499, 22 June 1962 (Activities of Juan Jose AREVALO)

HMMA-19499, 11 July 1962 (Mario MONTEFORTE Toledo)

HMM-6565, 13 July 1962 (Meeting Between Fernando Aguero and Juan

Jose AREVALO)

HMMA - 19805, 14 September 1962 (Coverage of Juan Jose AREVALO)

HMM-6780, 9 October 1962 (Arrival in Mexico of Leading Arevalists)

G. Counter-Intelligence Information

Mexico City Station's Related Mission Directive places greatest

emphasis on operations in the CI/CE area. LIFEAT was able to provide

a continuing worthwhile contribution in the attainment of the Station's

objectives in this field. Coverage included that on AEGENERATE, Carlos

Humbert ILLESCAS (who acts in the capacity as covert liaison link

addition to the continuing operational support in the CI/CE field, the

following informational reporting was provided.

¡H. Operational Support and Leads Provided other Station Operations

During the past project year LIFEAT continued actively supporting the

operations of Mexico City Station through the production of leads and

the providing of information on selected targets in the manner available

only through the use of a unilateral telephone tap operation. Indeed,

It is in this area, secure support to the Station's operations, that

LIFEAT is of greatest and unique value to the Station.

The following

Is a list of selected contributions by LIFEAT of operational support

and leads provided to the various Station Case Officers and Station

operations

as a whole:

LIFEAT/Soviet: The valuable assistance which LIFEAT rendered Station

efforts in this area was amply displayed in its support of Station

assets mounting a technical surveillance operation targeted against

the home of a known Soviet intelligence officer stationed in Mexico

•CIty under official cover. LIFEAT information provided vital infor-

mation which enabled the Station to establish a pattern of action

of both the family of the Soviet officer and his maid.

This infor-

mation made possible the setting of a time for the actual entry into

the target, and continuing coverage (including live monitoring of the

target line immediately preceeding the operation) by LIFEAT made

possible a degree of security for this operation which would not have

been possible without the support of a unilateral tap operation.

Further LIFEAT coverage has,

in addition to giving information on

the dally activities and contacts of Soviet officials, provided an ex-

cellent check on the contacts of three KUBARK controlled double agents

with their Soviet Case Officers. This coverage has enabled the respon-

sible Case Officer to guide his operations with increased assurance

that his agents continue to be fully cooperative and under his control.

LIFEAT/Cuban: LIFEAT activities in this area were concerned primarily

with support to the AMSTRUT operation.

Coverage of relatives of

ANSTRUT-2 provided an excellent "window" into the operation which

enabled the responsible Case Officers to move with more certainty

and security in developingthis operation. The Case Officers involved

considered the LIFEAT coverage an essential check on the activities of

the principals in the case which was especially valuable during the

Initial stages of the operation. Travel plans of AMSTRUT-2 provided

by LIFEAT were also essential to the timing of the operation. Also

in the Cuban area LIFEAT coverage of G-2 agent enabled the Station

to gain an insight into his contacts and activities.

initiation of coverage of a Cuban Commercial Official gives evidence

of producing solid information of commercial transactions and Mexican

Commercial contacts

of the Cuban Government.

LIFEAT/Polish: LIFEAT continued Its coverage in the BEKNAVE/BECHICK

operation.

(See previous project renewal for background of this case

and the LIFEAT participation in 1t.) Of great interest to this operation

was LIFEAT information indicating that the wife of BEKNAVE had become

aware of his interest in another woman, and later revelation of reassign-

ment and travel plans of BEKNAVE.

LIFEAT/Yugoslav: In addition to the usual information concerning

the Yugoslav officials and their daily contacts and activities,

LIFEAT provided leads which could pay off in future operations.

One example was a lead which revealed that a diplomatic courier

would be travelling alone and taking a new travel route while

carrying an official pouch. With this early warning, the Station

was able to plan an operation to provide access to this correspon-

dence. Although Headquarters finally vetoed this particular oper-

ation, sufficient early warning was given by LIFEAT so that the

operation could have been carried out. Another example of this

type of lead was the data available from LIFEAT coverage that a

new location was being sought for the Yugoslav Embassy, and which

specific locations were under consideration.

Armed with this informa-

tion the Station has been able to make a technical casing of one of

the prospective sites and obtain information necessary for entry into

the other sites.

LIFEAT/Exile: As noted previously, LIFEAT coverage of the exile

activities was the single major effort by LIFEAT during the project

year•

In particular, LIFEAT coverage of Juan Jose AREVALO Bermejo,

which included lengthy periods of "live-monitoring", on occasion

called for coverage of five lines.

information were provided Headquarters and Station Guatemala.

Is believed that the importance of this LIFEAT coverage can not be

stressed too much. LIFEAT Coverage of a Costa Rican Communist exile

resident in Mexico City has lead to a wealth of operational leads

Including the discovery of this person's envolvement in a Communist

funding mechanism. Also, LIFEAT was active in covering the Spanish

Republican exile community in Mexico City during the GPIDEAL visit

to Mexico. LIFEAT coverage in this case was considered necessary

to reveal immediately any renewal of an earlier planned attempt on

the life of an ODYOKE official by one group of the Republican Exiles.

Ultimately, LIFEAT revealed the departure from Mexico of two of the

ringleaders in the plot.

TFEAT/CI/CE: At Headquarters request LiFEAT faysage was establishe

n a former SMOlH agent whose past actions gave for some suspicion o:

his present activities. Product from this line has revealed an effort

by a group of this individual's friends to discredit the senior ODACID

official in Mexico.

Early warning by LIFEAT has made possible the

preparation of counter action (see HMMA-21364). LIFEAT has also

provided coverage of a suspected RIS support agent.

This coverage

had provided the background material necessary for checking on the

activities of this suspect agent. Continuing LIrEAT reporting on the

American Communist Group In Mexico (ACGM) has provided ODENVY with

great quantities of information on activities of leftist friends of

NW 65990 Docld:32392451 Page 7

of the ACCM Including their travel plans to Mexico and in some cases

Cuba.

Ais noted in paragraph I. E. above, the local office of ODENVY

considers this coverage "quite valuable"

• As also noted in previous

renewals, LIFEAT ability to give the interested case officers a check

on active and former agents increases the security of present opera-

tions and provides greater security for long term assets who may have

•been in contact with now terminated agents.

H. Conclusion

It is the opinion of the Mexico City Station that the support provided

other Station operations, the CI/CE Information and leads, and the

ability of the unilateral LIFEAT operation to cover sensitive targets.

without revealing Station interest to the liaison forces, well Justify

the expenditure of funds, time, personnel and security risk.

As .It has

been noted in the past, that even with the Station's envolvement in the

parallel, but liaison-type LIENVOY operation, a change in attitude by

the present local government administration or a change in government

administrations could end KUBARK participation in that liaison project.

For that reason, LIFEAT, in addition to maintaining its present heavy

coverage, must be available to once again undertake coverage of the

official Soviet and Czech official targets in Mexico City. Therefore,

LIFEAT's present orientation, though toward supporting Station operations

and CI/CE mission rather than toward targets which would provide positive

Intelligence, leaves it readily available for recall into the Soviet-

Czech coverage.

It is the Station's firm opinion that the LIFEAT

project provides a substantial and vital contribution in fulfilment the

several priority objectives of the Station's Related Mission Directive.

I.

There is attached a list of the HMMs produced from LIFEAT provided

material during the period July 1962 through May 1963, as a by-product

of the project's prime responsibility of providing support to Station

operations.

II. Progress of the Operation

The objectives of the LIFEAT Project are of a continuing nature and

are therefore not considered for fulfillment during any given period of

time.

For this reason percentage figures as to completion of project

objectives cannot be drawn. However, an indication of the coverage

tion during the review period with the average number of lines covered

per month being 18, and a high in October 1962 of 25 lines covered.

III. Planning for the Future

As was.indicated at the time of the last project renewal, LIFEAT hopes

to remain uncommitted to coverages that require the expenditures of

a great portion of LIFEAT resources but provide coverage of but one

target...such as Soviet Embassy coverage. It is added emphatically,

however, that should the need arise for LIFEAT to again assume such

responsibilities, it 1s fully able to do so. Until such time LIFEAT

assets, especially in the areas in which the Station does not wish

to reveal its interest or operations to the liaison forces involved

in the LIENVOY operation.

Expenditures

Approval for renewal of Project LIFEAT was granted 8 August 1962 for

FY 1963 in the amount of $99,000.00.

The proposed budget for FY 1964

is broken down in the attached Field Project Outline Renewal Request,

Part II,, and totals$83,808.

Status of Commitments

There are no commitments other than those noted in the project outline

submitted herewith and in the individual contracts and oral agreements

(memoranda of oral agreements were forwarded as necessary) of the

various LIFEAT personnel.
