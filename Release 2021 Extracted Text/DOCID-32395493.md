THIS DOCUMEN WY 19

i 12/15/98.

MEXICAN AUTHORITIES HAVE INFORMED US THAT THE NICARAGUAN,

TALURADO, AFTER A LONG INTERROGATION, HAS CONFESSED IN A SIGNED

¡STATEMENT HE DID NOT SEE OSWALD IN THE CUBAN CONSULATE HERE ON

EN OSHALD IN THE

(SEPTEMBER 18 OR AT ANY OTHER TIME AND THAT KE DID NOT SEE ANYONE

PASS MONEY. TO OSWALD. ALVARADO SAID HIS MOTIVE FOR CLAIMING

THE PASSAGE OF MONEY TO OSWALD WAS TO INVOLVE THE UNITED STATES

IN A WAY WHICH WOULD RESULT IN THE OVERTHROW OF CASTRO.

BOTH THE LEGAL ATTACHE AND THE CAS REPRESENTATIVE BELIEVE THAT

'ALVARADO'S STATEMENT TO THE MEXICANS MUST BE ACCEPTED AS

THIS OBINION IS CONCURRED IN BY NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT

INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL

KNOWS ALVARADO AND WHAT W

* WHO PERSONALLY

WHILE HE DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE

INVESTIGATION,

WHICH WAS CONDUCTED ENTIRELY BY MEXICANS,

WAS STANDING BY ADVISING WITH THE MEXICAN AUTHORITIES DURING

THE LATTER PART OF THE INTERROGATION,

WE ARE THEREFORE PROCEEDING

HERE ON THE THEORY THAT THE ALVARADO

STORY ABOUT HAVING SEEN

¿MONEY PASS MUST BE COMPLETELY DISCOUNTED.

MEXICAN AUTHORITIES ARE OBVIOUSLY RELIEVED AND, WHILE THEY

OFFER COOPERATION,

I DOUBT THEY WILL MAKE ANY INTENSIVE EFFOR

TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER.

NOT CURRENTLY HAVE A GOOD BASIS FOR REQUESTING ADDITIONAL

INVESTIGATION.

AZCUE WOULD BE THE NUMBER ONE SUSPECT IN

CUBAN CONSULATE AND HE DEPARTED MEXICO FOR HAVANA ON NOVEMBER

18 AND HAS NOT RETURNED.

THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDING ESPECIALLY

THE DORTICOS-HERNANDEZ ARMAS TELEPHONE CONVERSATIONS WHICH REMAIN

UNEXPLAINEDO WE SHALL CONTINUE TO LOOK HERE FOR PEOPLE WHO

SAW OSWALD WHILE HE WAS IN MEXICO BUT WE HAVE NO BASIS AT THIS

TIME FOR AN OPTIMISTIC ESTIMATE THAT WE SHALL BE ABLE TO FIND

ANYTHING DEFINATIVE ON THE CENTRAL ISSUE.
