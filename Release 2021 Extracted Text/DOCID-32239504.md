Dear Dick:

This letter is to confirm matters discussed in my note

to you of December 6 and in our conversations yesterday.

I have been offered a position as Assistant Attorney

General - Chief of Investigations in the office of the Attorney

General of the State of Maryland.

The position is an extremely

exciting one, and I have decided to accept it, effective today.

You have been most gracious and understanding in your

willingness

to accommodate my wishes. You have expressed your

or as long as I desire. In fact, the Attorney General has

asked me to assume my new duties immediately,

you have kindly permitted me to do so. This letter will confirm

my resignation effective yesterday, as a salaried member of the

staff.

My professional association with you has been a source of

pride to me.

1

am much more proud and gratified to have consoli-

dated a personal relationship with you which will carry into the

future.

My admiration for you is boundless, and I look forward

to future years of continued friendship.

Hopefully we will work

together again as well.

Sincerely yours,

Bot

p.m.

Dear Dick:

I've been waiting tonight for a chance to talk to you alone for about

ten minutes, but you've been tied up. Therefore I am writing.

The Attorney General for the State of Maryland has asked me to

take a position as chief of investigations in his office. I'm not

sure of the actual title. Aconstitutional amendment which was approved

in Maryland in last month's election has created the office of

permanent State-wide prosecutor, which is viewed as the successor to

the position I have been offered. I have been assured that if I

take the job, my office and I personally will probably become the

State-wide prosecutor next year when the statute becomes effective.

I would like to take the job, effective December20.

I am extremely uncomfortable with the idea of leaving you for two

reasons. First, because I have been with you for only a short time, and

I am generally opposed to job hopping.

More importantly, you had

confidence in me at a time of professional crises, and you are

entitled to loyalty, and more. Lately, however, I have felt that

you are not altogether pleased with my attitude in some respects,

and that my resignation from the staff might be the best way for me to

retain, rather than lose, your respect.

You are, without qualification, the most able, forceful prosecutor-

investigator I

have ever met. Moreover, you are one of the relatively

few

people in this world who have won my admiration. I have been

honored to be part of your staff, and I desperately desire to leave with your reg

respect and regard.

I would like to discuss this with you personally, and I hopeyou will

take a few minutes to talk with me.

Sincerely,

Bo tren

CHAMBERS OF

RALPH B. GUY, JR.

DISTRICT JUDGE

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

EASTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN

DETROIT 48226

October 20, 1976

William H. Morris, Director

National Conference of Bar Examiners

333 North Michigan Avenue, Suite 1025

Chicago, Illinois 60601

Re:

Robert Charles Ozer

Dear Mr. Morris:

I am pleased to be able to give an excellent recom-

mendation to Mr. Robert Ozer. My contact with Mr. Ozer

relates back to his being placed in charge of the Department

of Justice Organized Crime Strike Force located in Detroit,

Michigan.

I was the United States Attorney in Detroit,

Michigan from 1969 until June of 1976, and thus had occasion

to work on a daily basis with Mr. Ozer during his tenure in

Detroit.

Insofar as legal ability is concerned, I found MI. Ozer

to be one of the most capable lawyers with whom I had ever

been associated.

Naturally, his work was primarily in the

area of criminal law, but I

found him to be extremely

knowledgeable in the area of constitutional law as well as

such trial basics as evidence.

Mr. Ozer has tried a number

of difficult cases and is an accomplished trial attorney.

Mr. Ozer occupied an extremely sensitive position while

in Detroit, and in my opinion, his integrity both as to his

professional responsibilities and otherwise is above reproach.

I know of no derogatory information relative to his general

character or fitness.

Under normal circumstances, I would just stop at this

point, however, I am aware of the fact that Mr. Ozer during

the latter days of his tenure in Michigan became somewhat of

a controversial figure, and I feel obliged to comment on

this controversy.

To begin with, as United States Attorney, I probably

had the best vantage point of all the parties concerned in

connection with

whatever controversy enveloped Mr. Ozer.

Re:

Robert Charles Ozer

October 20, 1976

The Organized Crime Strike Forces frequently handle complex

cases that become much publicized due to the defendants

either being organized crime figures with high visibility of

public officials.

The real start of Mr. Ozer's notoriety in

Detroit occurred at or about the time that the Organized

Crime Strike Force indicted a Justice of the Michigan

Supreme Court. Although it is putting the cart before

the

horse, I should comment that the Justice was not only

indicted, but he was ultimately convicted in a trial personally

handled by Mr. Ozer. Although Mr. Ozer was at the epicenter

of the controversy

surrounding the indictment of Justice

Swainson,

much of the criticism and controversy actually

involved institutions of the criminal justice system and not

Mr. Ozer personally.

In order to have a proper frame of reference to evaluate

this matter, it is also necessary to know that Justice

Swainson was

a very popular political figure in the State of

Michigan having previously served as Governor of the State.

He had considerable clout as a result of the public office

he then held and public offices he previously held. Justice

Swainson is, of course, a lawyer himself and was a trial

judge in the State Circuit Court prior to being elected to

the State Supreme Court.

When Mr. Swainson was summoned to

appear before the Strike Force Grand Jury, he elected to

represent himself, and in the process, committed perjury (or

at least a jury was convinced that he did and convicted him

of same). Since Justice Swainson was convicted of events

that occurred within the grand jury, rather than the sub-

stantive offenses which the grand jury was investigating,

there immediately was a great hue and cry about grand juries

in general and about the tactics of organized crime strike

I know of nowhere in which the Organized Crime

Strike Forces maintained by the Department of Justice in

eighteen cities in this country are popular. That is because

they frequently go after targets who have the money and

position to counterattack, both within the framework of the

legal proceedings involved and extra-judicially as well.

After Mr. Swainson was indicted, literally scores of political

figures (at least those of the same party affiliation as MI.

Swainson) flocked to his defense and turned in anger and

outrage against the Organized Crime Strike Force as personified

by Mr. Ozer.

It should also be noted that all of the

"criticisms" of the grand jury and strike force procedures

were formally made in the context of the criminal trial in

which Justice Swainson was a defendant, and were all overruled

Re: Robert Charles Ozer

or ignored by the visiting trial judge who was appointed to

hear this matter.

During the course of the investigation of the Swainson

case, certain other events occurred which caused Mr. Ozer

further difficulties. Again, some background is necessary

for a proper understanding.

I would be the first to concede

notwithstanding any other good comments I have to make about

Mr. Ozer, that he is not the world's greatest diplomat. It

would probably be more accurate to say that particularly

when dealing with the press, Mr. Ozer is not the world's

greatest diplomat. The work of the Organized Crime Strike

Force is highly confidential and secret. Mr. Ozer believed

(and based upon seven years experience as a United States

Attorney I would concur) that there is very little good that

can be accomplished by press coverage of any case in its

investigative stage. This is not to discount the public's

right to know or the very important rights and responsibilities

of the working press. However, in the investigative stages

of a criminal case, there is simply nothing that is properly

before the public. Accordingly, Mr. Ozer adopted a policy

of not talking to members of the press at all. Since all of

his cases involved extremely newsworthy people, this infuriated

the local press.

Ozer would not talk to the press, he did have to go to court

periodically and would occasionally fall into the hands of

the press after a grand jury or court session. On one such

occasion, Mr. Ozer made a comment that was to serve as the

genesis of many of his succeeding problems. Without attempting

to reconstruct the incident, suffice it to

say that he made

a comment that one could interpret as meaning that other

members of the Michigan judiciary were under investigation.

The then president of the State Bar of Michigan felt that:

this was a highly improper statement that cast a cloud on

the entire state judiciary and reacted vocally and violently.

My own view is that it was a tempest in a teapot and was

blown completely out of proportion by the press who were

delighted to take any opportunity to tie a can to Mr. Ozer's

tail for the reasons previously indicated.

Other incidents concerning statements of Mr. Ozer in

non-judicial contexts (for example, he was quoted in a

Newsweek article) also were picked up by those who had an

axe to grind with Mr. Ozer and used against him..: I have

thoroughly reviewed such statements and find them to have

been taken out of context. Nonetheless, there is no denying

Re: Robert Charles Ozer

that as a prosecutor, Mr. Ozer could only be described as a

"hard charger."

I have never known him to strike foul

blows, but he

does strike hard ones. When he is interviewed,

he reflects this hard nose attitude. Again, it must be

remembered that his primary assignment during this period of

time was dealing with individuals who over the years have

eluded ordinary law enforcement efforts to apprehend them.

He was not in a run-of-the-mill criminal prosecution situation,

and he could not use run-of-the-mill tactics or reflect run-

of-the-mill attitudes if he was to be successful, and indeed

he was a successful prosecutor during his tenure in Detroit.

I could go on and detail other incidents and events but

they all are in the same general category as I have indicated

thus far.

One other point of significance.

It is up to the

readers of this letter to discount the information contained

therein as they will based upon my prior position as a

United States Attorney and my association with Mr. Ozer. I

think in fairness, however, there are some additional

relevant facts.

First, during all or most of the time

relevant hereto, I was also an elected commissioner of the

State Bar of Michigan, so I was in a position to view what

was going on from both sides of the tence.: second, 1 am not

wedded to the Organized Crime Strike Force concept of the

Department of Justice.

In fact,

I served as chairman of the

Attorney General's Advisory Committee of United States

Attorneys, and during the time I was on the committee, the

committee recommended the abolition or phasing out of

strike

forces.

Thiraly, although I worked with Mr. Ozer on a

professional basis regularly, I was in no way a social

friend and never even once saw Mr. Ozer or his family in a

social context during all the time that he was here.

I think that it is indeed unfortunate that the circum-

stances that were generated in Detroit ultimately led to Mr.

Ozer's resignation from the Department of Justice. Even

here, however, the story is not that which might be gleaned

by a

casual observer. The president of the State Bar

complained to the Attorney General of the United States

about Mr. Ozer. One of Attorney General Levi's prime

responsibilities when he took over the Department of Justice

was to restore a somewhat tarnished image, and he and the

Re: Robert Charles Ozer

October 20, 1976

Department don't like waves or wave makers. At or about

the time in question, the Department of the Treasury

(specifically the Internal Revenue Service) and the

Department of Justice were locked in a battle before Congress

concerning the Department of Justice's access to individual

tax returns in connection with criminal investigations.

The

director of the Internal Revenue Service was trying

to

limit Department of Justice access to tax returns.

The

question of misuse of such tax returns came before Congress,

and the director of the Internal Revenue Service indicated

to the Congressional committee involved that he felt that

organized crime strike forces were the principal users of

such tax returns and that they were guilty of being over

zealous.

To support such claim he made reference to the

"Ozer incident" which immediately changed Mr. Ozer's profile

within the Department of Justice from low to high. It was

the start of a downhill slide which terminated in his

resignation.

I also know that if Mr. Ozer is admitted to practice

in the State of Michigan he has a solid offer of immediate

employment from a substantial and respected employer who is

fully conversant with all of the facts surrounding Mr. Ozer

and is delighted at the prospect of being able to utilize

Mr. Ozer's abilities.

Although this is not particularly

relevant as such, it is corroborative of the fact that there

are

a considerable number of persons of judgment substance

and importance who have a high regard for Mr. Ozer's legal

abilities as well as his general character.

I am sorry for the length of this letter, but this is

an important matter to you and it is certainly important to

Mr. Ozer,

and I felt that any briefer treatment would not

be compatible with the complexity of what is at issue.

captors were angered over his infor-

local law enforcement agencies.

Whalen had refused to identify his

captors to police because he said they

had

threatened his family,

but a

spokesman for Ozer said Friday that

Whalen did give the FBI enough infor-

mation to lead to Pulvirenti.

Whalen, to "evaluate" Whalen's testi-

Whalen was telling the truth.

Kohl said Pulvirenti was unable to

provide

any useful information, how-

Pulvirenti was on welfare at the

time.

FRIDAY, JANUARY 9.1976

As We See It

Strike Force Tactics Go

Beyond Proper Bounds

ATTORNEY GENERAL Edward Levi

owes the people of Michigan the courtesy of

bringing Robert Ozer, the head of the federal

organized crime strike force in Detroit, to

account for the reckless misuse of his power.

Mr. Ozer's handling of the trial of John

Swainson, former

Michigan governor and

Supreme Court justice, has been irresponsi

ble. Even if Mr.

Swainson's conviction on a

perjury charge stands up. Mr. Ozer has tram-

pled on the rights of people at thrce crucial

points in the proceedings.

The latest episode-his abuse of Mr. Swain-

son's attorney, Konrad Kohl, on the basis of

an unsubstantiated and, as it turns out, un-

true charge--is only the climax of Mr. Ozer's

sorry record

Mr. Swainson siands convicted of perjury,

and on that basis he has resigned from his

scat on the Supreme Couri. As we said at the

time of his conviction, Supreme Court jus-

lices, of all people, are accountable for the

truth or falsity of what they say under oath.

A jury of his peers found Mr. Swainson had

violated his oath. I: was certainly proper that

he resign.

Despite that fact, and even should that con-

viction be upheld. we think Mr. Ozer's tactics

cannes go unchallenged

ive

enormous powers. They have a

mure chaption where they find ir.

women detence to hayone

Her of Tigh posities They are answer-

Marries however.

Mr. Ozer's case that Mr. Swainson had ac-

cepted a bribe turned out, when he got to trial,

to be flimsy and unpersuasive to the jury. His

sweeping insinuations that there is wide-

spread corruption in the Michigan judiciary

stand ihus far unsupported.

And now his charges against Mr. Kohl turn

out to be supported by no evidence, in the

opinion of the grand jury. Mr. Ozer has had to

acknowledge that the grand jury found

"perfectly satisfactory" Mr. Kohl's explana-

tion of the alleged intimidation incident.

We want and support vigorous prosecution

of government wrongdoing. We hope that the

Justice Department will continue to pursue

corruption and try to root it out.

Mr. Ozer's tactics, though, raise the most

serious questions and have to be dealt with

t00. Federal prosecutors have large and dan-

gerous powers. The society cannot tolerate

guilt by announcement.

Mr. Ozer's tactics cannot be condoned, no

matter how nuch we share his zeal for root-

ing out corruption.

Newsweek Magazine in December pub-

lished the transcript of a meeting of prosecu

tors held a year ago in Houston, Texas. Mr.

Ozer was one of the participants. The tran-

script shows him speaking enthusiastically of

"investigation by terrorism."

Mr. Ozer's performance in the Swainson

case has left us with the sickening feeling that

we now know all too well some of what that

means. It is well past time for Mr. Over to be

brought under control by the Department of

Justice, which is not, after all, named the

Department of Terrorism,

U.S. silent on Bushnell plea

to fire Ozer from strike force

By ROBERT ANKENY

News Staif Writer

The U.S. Justice Department has re-

fused to comment on State Bar of Michi-

gan President George E. Bushnell's de-

mand for the removal of Robert C. Ozer,

head of the U.S. Organized Crime Strike

Force in Detroit.

"We have received his (Bushnell's) let-

ter and we have no comment at this

time,"

a spokesman for U.S. Attorney

General Edward Levi said yesterday.

Bushnell's strongly-worded three-page

letter to Levi calling for Ozer's ouster

cited the Strike Force chief for "ruthless

conduct"' in prosecution of former Michi-

gan Supreme Court Justice John B.

sirainson.

Ozer also said he would not comment on

Bushnell's charges or the demand for his

removal.

But: in an interview which will appear

in The Sunday Magazine this weekend the

33-year-old special federal prosecutor said

he wrote to Bushnell, "telling him he was

George Bushnell

complaining about some things I didn't

say. But he still goes on the same way, in

spite of my letter.

Sunday Magazine Writer Al Stark, who

conducted the interview with Ozer weeks

ago, reported that Ozer's initial reaction

to the mention of Bushnell's name was:

"That ass.

"Look; Bushnell is a lawyer, he snould

know to go to the record to see who actu

ally said what."

Bushnell said State Bar criticism of

Ozer began last May after Swainson ap-

when, he said, "Ozer"

the grand jury would indict Swainson.

Bushnell said Stephen C. Bransdorfer,

then State Bar president, on May 23 pro-

tested "the impropriety of that conduct"

to the acting Assistant Atty. Gen. John C.

Keeney. In June, Bushnell said, Keeney

told Bransdorfer that Ozer had been "se-

verely admonished."

After Swainson's trial - in which he

was acquitted of bribe conspiracy but con-

victed on three counts of lying to a federal

§grand jury - Ozer made statements

which Bushnell said equated accusation

with guill." The Ozer post-trial state-

ments ciied by Bushnell as "outrageous

and inexcusable" were:

• That the verdict was "a compromise

verdict"

and that if the jurers thought

Sirainson was really innocent of conspir-

acy they would have acquitted him on all

counts.

• That "an acquittal very frequently ex

Re: Robert C. Ozer

Dear Members of the Board:.

Robert C. Ozer, presently a Departmental Attorney with

the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section, Criminal Division,

United States Department of Justice,

has requested that I

advise you fully. of the facts and circumstances concerning his

impending termination of service with the Department. At his

request, I am pleased to do so.

Mi. Ozer joined the Department in December 1969 and

was initially assigned as an attorney with the Philadelphia

Strike Force. His work was excellent, and in April 1972 ne

was promoted to head the Buffalo, Strike Force. His work there

was also excellent,

and he left the Department in May 1973 to

enter private practice in Philadelphia.

He returned to the

potose tie one:

Department with the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section

in October 1974, and in February 1975 was assigned to head the

The first disciplinary inquiry of any kind conducted

by the Department concerning Mr. Ozer began on December 4, 1975,

when Mr. Ozer was formally requested to explain certain.comments

attributed to him in Newsweek Magazine, December

1, 1975.

NW 66000

Docld:32239504 Page 47

---

## Page 48

Mr. Ozer advises me that he is submitting to you full

documentation concerning that inquiry.

Mr. Ozer submitted

his formal explanation on December 15,

•1975, and on

December 19, 1975, Mr. Ozer was interviewed personally by

Associate Deputy Attorney General Rudolph W. Giuliani and

later that day by the Deputy Attorney General,'

the Honorable

Harold R. Tyler, JI.

The matter was then taken under advise-

ment by the Department.

. During the next several months, the Department

received several complaints concerning Mr. Ozer's conduct

during the investigation, trial, and subsequent investigation

concerning Michigan Supreme Court Justice John B. Swainson.

Most notably these complaints were contained in a letter to

the Attorney General, in January 1976, by George E. Bushnell,

JI., President of the State Bar of Michigan, in which abusive

use of the grand jury, as well as improper public statements,

was alleged.

On April 27, 1976, the Deputy' Attorney General wrote

a letter to Me. Ozer, a

Copy of which, I am advised by Mr. Ozer

is being provided to you.

It is to be noted that the, Deputy Attorney General

found all of the allegations of grand jury abuse and many other

allegations in Mr. Bushnell's letter to be unfounded and

without substance.

As you will note in the letter, Mr. Ozer

was formally admonished for his

Newsweek and for his public statements, post-trial, in which

he commented upon the verdict in the Swainson case.

During the pendency of the inquiry concerning Mr. Ozer,

I had every hope and confidence that he would conduct himsels

with the most meticulous care to avoid any conduct, personal or

professional, which could reflect adversely upon the Department..

In this regard I was disappointed.

In my view, MI. Ozer

exercised poor judgment in his retention of his personal attorney

for his own aivorce proceedings. Mr. Ozer had met his attorney

as opposing counsel in the highly publicized Swainson case

(the attorney represented a co-defendant), and in fact the

Detroit newspapers took note of the attorney's appearance of

record as counsel for MI. Ozer in divorce proceedings.

Mr. Ozer should have known that such an attorney-

client association could reflect adversely upon the Department

- 3-

in the event that his attorney had any further dealings, as

an adversary, with the Detroit Strike Force.. In fact, such

an incident occurred in May 1976.

In May 1976, the attorney was retained by the family

of a federal prisoner for the purpose of efforts to effectuate

a reassignment of that prisoner from the federal penitentiary

at Leavenworth, Kansas, to an institution closer to Michigan.

Mr. Ozer instructed a subordinate to make application to have

the

prisoner brought to Detroit by means of a writ of habeas

corpus ad testificandum.

The subordinate objected to issuance':.

of the writ, but he was overruled by Mr. Ozer.

It is Mr. Ozer's

contention that his subordinate was advised that the purpose

of the writ was to ascertain whether or not the prisoner could

assist federal investigators with their ongoing investigation

and to thereby enable the Department to ascertain whether of not.

the Department should in any way

support a permanent reassignment

to a different prison.: Mr. Ozer's subordinate claims he was

not so advised until he raised the issue of the propriety of the

application for the writ.

The prisoner was in fact brought to

"Detroit where he remained

in Marshal's

custody for several

weeks.

He was interviewed by Mr. Ozer's subordinate and by a

federal investigator, and he was then

returned to Leavenworth.

Under the circumstancés, I consider Mr. Ozer to have exercised

extremely poor judgment in the proceedings involving the issuance

of the writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum, and I feel that

he treated a subordinate inproperly by summarily overruling

the

subordinate's objections to issuance of the writ. Mr. Ozer's

poor judgment as outlined

above caused me to conclude that

Mr. Ozer's resignation

should be requested. I have requested

and received Mr. Ozerls resignation, although the effective date

of that resignation has

not been precisely determined.

I view Mr. Ozeris conduct as outlined above to be

extremely poor judgment

with respect to his responsibilities

as Chief of a Department of Justice Strike Force.

I believe,

however, that he is an excellent lawyer and I believe that he

is professionally and morally qualified for admission to the

Michigan Bar: I do recommend his admission to the Michigan Bar.

FROM: fes Robert C. Ozer

Staff Counsel

SUBJECT: Procedure for Issuance of Subpoenaes

DATE:

October 21, 1976

The House of Representatives, by House Rule 11(m) (2) (a),

a copy of which is attached, provides that subpoenaes, when

authorized by rule (or resolution) may be issued by the

committee,

"only when authorized by a majority of the members

of the committee," and that the chairman, or such member

delegated by him, may perform the ministerial act of issuing

the subpoena.

We are advised by the Office of Legislative Counsel

(Willoughby Sheame) as well as by Staff Director of the

Select Committee on Narcotics that the above procedure is

invariably followed by all House committees and subcommittees.

All of the attorneys who have conferred you this question

feel that our resolution (H. Res. 1540) does not provide for

any different procedure. The resolution at lines 1-10, page

2, refers to the select committee (or any subcommittee

authorized by it

as authorized to issue subpoenaes. At

page 3, lines 4-7, the conventional procedure described

above was provided by authorization to the chairman (or any

member designated by him) to sign subpoenaes.

Finally, even if the resolution (H.Res.1540) had authorized

a unique and different procedure, the committee itself has

limited itself to the conventional procedure described above.

This has been done by the routine adoption by the committee

of the Rules of the House. Thus, even if the House had

expanded the committee's authorized power (which it did not),

the committee has limited itself to the conventional procedure.

I have not yet ascertained, but I will undertake to do

so, whether the phrase in Rule II (m) (2) (a) "when authorized

by a majority of the members of the committee" can mean a

majority of those present and voting - e.g. a quorum of two;

NW 66000

Docld:32239504 Page 50

## Page 51

or the requirement is actually for a majority of the

committee. I am inclined to feel, without benefit of

research or consultation at this time, that just as a

majority of the House (under House Rules) means a majority

of the quorum present and voting, a majority of the

committee would be satisfied by a majority of the quorum

present and voting.

sideration of such measure or matter in the

House. This subparagraph shall not apply to-

(A) any measure for the declaration of war,

or the declaration of a national emergency, by

the Congress; or

(B) any executive decision, determination,

or action which would become or continue to be,

effective unless disapproved or otherwise

invalidated by one or both Houses of Congress.

Paragraph (6) was originally contained in section 108 of the Legis-

Intive Reorganization Act of 1970 (84 Stat. 1140) and was incorporated

into the rules on January 22, 1971 (H. Res. 5, 92nd Congress, p. 141).

The rule was amended on October 13, 1972 (H. Res. 1153, 92nd Con-

gress, pp. 36013-23) to clarify the three-day availability requirement,

and was further amended effective January 3, 1975 (H. Res. 988, 93rd

Congress, D. -) to eliminate the exemptions from the first sentence

of the rule conferred upon the Committees on Appropriations, House

Administration and Standards of Official Conduct, and on January 14,

1975 (H. Res. 5, 94th Congress, D —), to remove some extraneous

lunguage inadvertently inserted in the first sentence by H. Res. 988.

With

respect to the committee expense resolutions reported by

the Committee on House Administration

pursuant to clause 5 of

Rule XI, the one-day availability requirement of that clause, rather

than the three-day requirement of this rule, is applicable, but other

privileged resolutions reported from that committee are now subject

to this clause (Speaker Albert, Mar. 6, 1975, p. —).

(7) If, within seven calendar days after a

measure has, by resolution, been made in order

for consideration by the House, no motion has

been offered that the House consider that meas-

ure, any member of the committee which reported

that measure may be recognized in the discretion

of the Speaker to offer a motion that the House

reported from the Committee on House Administration as required
