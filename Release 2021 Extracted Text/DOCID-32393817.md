This incident is

discussed in the Warren Report, pp. 308, 309, Cable from Mexico

Station to CIA Headquarters, 11/25/63. [Comment: The first cable

Embassy some of our own reporting is in error. e go DIR 85089

House, states

NOn 26 November 1963 Gilberto ALVARADO, a proF

fessed Castroite Nicaraguan

ore came to the American Embassy in

Mexico and made a Statement about Lee OSWALD. According to ALVA:

RADO'S interrogation by Mexican authorities, he called the Ameri

can Embassy on 25 November and-"succeeded in speaking to a high

official with whom he made an appointment for that same day at

5530 pon, nearsthe Hoter Maria Isabel Two individuals appeared

for the appointment." According to a note in the Mexico Station

file, signed by the Embassy Security Officer, A. C. PLAMBECK:

dated 25 November these two men were SNIGHT and PLAMBECK; both

were Embassy security officers] He told Embassy personnel that he

was in the cuban consulate on september 17 and saw Cubans who dis-

cussed assassination pay OSWALD a sum of money? [Comment: During

his first meeting with Embassy officials, ALVARADO claimed he had

been at the Cuban Consulate on the 18th of September, not the 17th

In fact, at no time, did he refer to the date 17 September. Later,

during his interrogation in connection with the polygraph examina

tion on 6 December 1963, ALVARADO revealed he was unsure of the

day of week allegedly saw OSWALD. Thinks that it was on Tuesday"

which would have been 17 September.

(MEXI -7289 (IN 75588), 7 Decem

ber 1963) 1 He later repeated his story to the CIA Mexico Station

officer,

## Page 4

Chief. [Comment: At no time, at least there is no mention in the

files, did ALVARADO repeat his story to the "CIA Mexico Station

Ghief". ALVARADO first told his story, as indicated above, to two

officers from the Embassy Security Office. The next morning, he

met with PLAMBECK from the Embassy Security Office, and a Station

officer. During another meeting that evening (26 November), ALVA

RADO was interrogated by two officers from the Station.

(Note for

the Record, dated 25 November 1963, signed by PLAMBECK; Memorandum

for Clark ANDERSON, Legal Attache, dated 29 November 1963, xom

Winston M. SCOTT.)] The CIA and the warren Commission later con

cluded that the story was a fabrication, but the Agency was clearly

concerned with "p"'s story at the time. 36 (EN."D" later admitted

that the story about OSWALD had been fabricated. Cable from Mexico

City to CIA Readquarters, 11/30/63. It had also been determined

by the FBI, that OSWALD was probably in Neu Orleans on September 17.

Cable from CIA Headquarters to Mexico Station, 21/28/63.1 [Comment

There were actually two cables, DIR 85258, 27 November 1963 and

DIR 85653 28 November 1963, which indicated OSWALD was in New

Orleans on 17 and 19 September 1963.15

Later in that day [26 November 1963], the Merico Station

cabled Headquarters on the details of its interrogation off"D" 3g

[MEXI -7069 (IN 68376)26 November 1963.1 It also reported other

information from a sensitive and reliable source which tended to

confirm "D's story that OSwAlD may have been paid by the Cubans

to assassinate President Kennedy. [Comment: It would appear from

this statement, the authors of the report were referring to MEXI-

7069

7069 (IN 68376) ; however, this cable does not contain any remarks

alluding to information which "tended to confirm D's story"

hasty conclusions, we suggest that DORTICOS! preoccupation with

money angle of interrogation of Silvia DURAN tends to corroborate

to some extent authenticity of the Nicaraguan's statement. Thus,

there appears to be a strong possibility that a down payment was

made to OSWALD in the Cuban Embassy there, presumably with promise

of a subsequent payment after assassination." The Ambassador was

reading somewhat more into the situation than was the case. The

reference to DORTICOS - the Cuban President - relates to two tele-

phone conversation between DORTICOS and HERNANDEZ, the Cuban Amba-

ssador to Mexico, on 26 November 1963. The first conversation,

which took place at 0924, was forwarded, in resume, to Headquarters

on 26 November 1963 (MEXI- 7068 IN 2) the second conversation,

which took place at 1839, was forwarded, in resume, to Headquarters

on 27 November 1963 (MEXI -7097 IN

. In the first conversa-

tion DORTICOS asks (if) the Federals of that country wanted Senora

DURAN to say something, that they had some interest in, and had

offered some money to the American?" To which HERNANDEZ answers

that there was nothing about money

In the second conversation,

DORTICOS is quoted as saying I was referring as to whether they

had threatened her so that she would make a statement that the Con

sulate had given money to the man that American." HERNANDEZ, ans-

wered that "nothing absolutely was given her" [sic] It would not

appear from a close reading of these two conversations that they

contain information which tended to confirm 'D's' story!

M. 1

This report has never been satisfactorily explained, although it

was made available to the Warren Commission Staff In any event,

these reports certainly must have fueled suspicions of Cuban in-

volvement in the assassination. Based on the evidence it reviewed,

the warren Commission later determined that "D''s story was a fabri

cation. [Comment This statement appears to be gratitous the

Warren Commission did not ask about the ALVARADO case until 21

Apri1- 1964

On that date RANKIN addressed a letter to Richard

HELMS in which he stated inter alia "We are aware, of course,

from previous reports that the allegations made by ALVARADO were

thoroughly investigated by Central Intelligence Agency and Federal

Bureau of Investigation representatives in Mexico City in liaison

with the responsible Mexican law-enforcement authorities. Refer

ence is made to the discussion of these allegations in your memo

randum dated January 31, 1964, at pages 11-14.

"Upon review of our complete file on this matter, we

find that we lack full documentation of the investigation conducted

of these allegations. It would be helpful if our records could be

supplemented by a report from your Agency supplying more details

regarding the investigation undertaken by your Agency, and other con

cerned Agencies into this matter and your evaluation as to the truch

of ALVARADO's assertions In particular, it would be helpful if a

report could be submitted by the expert who conducted the polygraph

examination which emphasizes the specific conclusions which he made

based on the responses by ALVARADO in answering key questions on

this matter. (Letter to Richard HELMS, DDP, dated 21 April 1964

from J. Lee RANKIN,, General Counsel.) The Agency responded on 1

June 1964. (Memorandum to J. Lee RANKIN, dated 1 June 1964, from

Richard HELMS, DDP; Subject: Gilberto ALVARADO Ugarte.J1

The American Ambassador in Mexico later sent a cable

[MEXI-7072 (IN 68406) , 26 November 1963] to State Department througl

CIA channels. In that cable he gave his opinion that the Cubans

were involved in the assassination, and recommended certain inves

tigative steps which should be taken in Mexico.

40 (EN. Cable from

Mexico Station to CIA Headquarters, 11/26/63.)

By November 22, the Mexico Station and CIA Headquarters

were also beginning to question the accuracy of "D's stroy.

The

cabtes between the Mexico Station and Headquarters indicate the

possibility that the story was a fabrication.

Nevertheless, on

November 28, Headquarters cabled a reminder to the Mexico Station

to "follow all leads".

The station was instructed to continue in

vestigating the possibility of cuban or soviet involvement, beeause

Headquarters had not excluded the possibility that other persons

were involved with OSwALD.!4 (PN. A cable from CIA Headquarters

to Mexico Station, 11/28/03- [DIR 85655, 28 November 1963)

Later that day (27 November] Headquarters learned that

Mexican authorities-planned to. arrest silvia DURAN again and warned

the station that the Mexicans must take responsibility for the ar

rest..

After learning that the U.S. Ambassador was continuing to

press for a vigorous investigation into cubon involvement, Head-

quarters also warned the station Chief that the Ambassador was

pushing the case too hard and his proposals could lead to a "flap"

with the cubans. 46 (FN. A cable from CIA Headquarters to Mexico

Station, 11/28/63. [DIR 85655, 28 November 1963) Pinally, the

Agency concluded that "D''s story was a fabrication and terminated

its interest in him. 4? (EN. Ibia.)

On November 30, Director MCCONE met with the President

at 11 a.m. op

While there was a discussion of the altegations

made by "'D" the memorandum records no action was required on the

"OSWALD situation" 49

(FN Memo-andum for the Record by Director

McCone,

12/2/63) [Comment: Memorandum not available in the file.l

On December 1, McCONE met with the President and BUNDY:

MCCONE's memorandum of the meeting indicates they again discussed

"D's storya Later that day, Headquarters cabled the Mexico Station

and stated that the White House had been told the story was a fabm

cation.

Later that day (2 Decemberl, the Mexico Sta-

reported it had reason to doubt its earlier conclusion that "D"

was fabricating.

[Comment: The authors of the Report give no

source for this statement. Moreover, they leave the reader in the

air as to what was the outcome of further investigation to deter

mine whether the earlier-conclusion-that ALAVARDO was fabricating

was an accurate conclusion. The facts are as follows:

On 2 December, Captain (WHEELOCK* saw ALAVARDO during the

Captain Franklin Anthony WHEELOCK Garcia, chiet of the Anti-

Communist Section of the Nicaraguan Office of National Security.

On 2 December, Captain/WHEELOCK saw ALVARADO during the

afternoon for the first time. In a brief interview, which lasted

only seven minutes, in the company Of two Mexican officials,

ALVARADO reverted to his previous story. He claimed he did see

OSWALD and that he did call the Embassy to report. (Latter state:

ment not supported by Embassy investigation.) ALVARADO went on to

say that he told the Mexicans he was fabricating because he was

"mentally mistreated", specifically because he was threatened that

he would be hanged by the testicles. Actually he was not physically

mistreated.

AVHEELOCK) said he was unable to come to any definite

conclusion as to ALVARADO'S veracity; however, he would be able to

do so once he returned to Managua and had a chance to complete the

interrogation

(MEXT 7023 IN 71702, 2 December 1963)

On 3 December 1963, Headquarters tells the Mexico Sta

tion that although Headquarters is confident that ALVARADO iS a

fabricator and that his retraction of his confession is false it

has been decided that he should be placed on the polygraph. Head-

quarters asks that the Station arrange to have ALVARADO released

to CIA custody for Several days and ask WHEELOCK to remaing in Mexi

conto assist.

A polygraph operator from the Office of Security will

arrive on 4 December. He will be incharge of the polygraph inter

view, but will berassisted by Clark ANDERSON (Legal Attache who

has been selected as an interpretere The FBI will notify ANDERSON

of this. (DIR 86563 3 December 1963)

Mexico in response to Mexico Station's request for assistance in

interrogating ALVARADO.For further details see accompanying

ECHEVARRIA, the acting minister of gobernacion, agreed

to permit CIA to "borrow ALVARADO. The plan was to pick up

ALVARADO on 5 December and return him that evening. (MEXI 7229

IN 72877, 3 December 1963) ALVARADO was picked up as planned and

underwent preliminary questioning on 5 December. The next day he

underwent a polygraph interview. The results of this interview

indicated that ALVARADO was fabricating his story.-

Interrogation

revealed that he was unsure as to the exact day of the week he alle-

gedly. saw OSWALD:

He thought it was on a Tuesday which would have

been the 17th of September.When ALVARADO was shown a series of

photographs during the testing, deception patterns became evident.

When he was confronted with this he answered that he had the utmost

confidence in the polygraph and that it must be correct. The in-

terrogation was concluded with ALVARADO admitting he must have made

an "honest mistake" in relating the original story in his identifi

cation of OSWALD: (MEXI -7289 IN 75588, 7 December)

Following the receipt of the results of the anove inter

view with ALVARADO, Headquarters disseminated the results to the

Federal Bureau of Investigation.

"The re interrogation of Gilberto ALVARADO,

Nicaraguan informant who claimed to have seen

Lee OSWALD receive money to

assassinate Kennedys

has been concluded.

Our Mexico City Station ad-

vises us that ALVARADO admitted he must have

been mistaken in saying that he saw OSALD in

the Cuban Embassy. Also, he was uncertain of

the date on which he might have seen someone

like OSWALD and thought it must have been on a

Tuesday, which would have made it 17 September

1963. Although the final report of the poly-

graph interview is not yet available

the pre-

liminary finding is that ALVARADO evidenced

deception reactions when talking about OSWALD:

"It is expected that ALVARADO will be dea

ported to Nicaragua on 9 December 1963•

pated in the interrogation of ALVARADO.

The Ambassador's suspicions, cited above, were fueled

two days later, on November 25, when Gilberto Nolesco Alvarado-

telephoned the American Embasssy in Mexico City. He claimed

that on 18 September he saw Lee Oswald receive six thousand
