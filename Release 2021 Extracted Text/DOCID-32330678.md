RICHARD CARL BIGGS aka

Carl Biggs

IGA; ITWI

OO - DALLAS

(Dallas 162-36)

(Bufile 162-515)

BIGGS is well-known bookie around Dallas and

Central Texas. He apparently laid off bookmaking for

several years but became active in about August, 1967,

and was working with GEORGE DAVID CHERRY, a relatively

small-time bookie. BIGGS and CHERRY operated this past

fall at Farmers Branch, Texas, suburb of Dallas, where

they

had connecting apartments, BIGGS being in apartment 311,

located at 12803 Demetra.

Both had Federal Wagering Stamps

for current fiscal year and gave the above address as loca-

tion where they accepted wagers. In about December, 1967.

CHERRY and BIGGS had a falling out over establishing the

line and failure of one bettor, LOUIS SIGEL, to pay about

a $20,000.00 loss. CHERRY left BIGGS and recently advised

he is no longer booking.

Bureau approved obtaining toll

records on BIGGS and these have been obtained and review

shows numerous calls to out-of-state and intrastate sub

scribers, some of which are known to be Texas bookies.

AB

near as can be determined, BIGGS 1s still operating, but

believed possibly from his hone.

Pertinent telephone numbers and locations on

BIGGS are as fOllows:

12803 Demetra, Apartment 311,

Farmers Branch, Texas, phone CH 1-4191

Residence: 4455 Harvest H111

Dallas, Texas, phone AD 9-0608

.CHERRY was previously a PCI of the Dallas Office

and efforts are being made to establish him again as source

on BIGGS' operation.

â€¢He has provided some pertinent

information to date.
