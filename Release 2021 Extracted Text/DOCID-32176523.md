RECENTLY, THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE (SSC) STAFF HAS

INTERVIEWED SEVERAL

FORMER EMPLOYEES AND IT IS ANTICIPATED

THAT MANY MORE SUCH PERSONNEL WILL BE CONTACTED.

THE FBI HAS PLEDGED FULL COPERATION WITH THE COMMITTEE

HAVE ANY QUEST ION REGARDING HIS OBLIGATION NOT TO DIVULGE INFOR-

BE INSTRUCTED TO CONTACI LEGAL COUNSEL, FBIHQ, BY COLLECT CALL.

YOUR CONVERSATIONS WITH FORMER EMPLOYEES MUST BE IN KEEPING WITH

Regulations, Section 16. 22 (copy attached), which reads as follows:

"No employee or former employee of the Department of

Justice shall, in response to a demand of a court or other authority,

produce any material contained in the files of the Department or disclose

any information relating to material contained in the files of the Department,

or disclose any information or produce any material acquired as part of

the performance of his official duties or because of his official status

without prior approval of the appropriate Department official or the

Attorney General in accordance with Section 16. 24."

Also, you are reminded of Department of Justice Order

Number 116-56, dated May 15, 1956, (copy attached) which, among

other things, requires an employee upon the completion of his testimony

to prepare a memorandum outlining his testimony.

Our cooperative efforts, of course, must be consistent

with the above cited authority. Therefore, if you are contacted for

purpose of interview or testimony you are to request approval as

required by the Employment Agreement and await authorization before

furnishing information, testimony, or record material.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

As consideration for employment in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), United

States Department of Justice, and as a condition for continued employment, I hereby declare

that I intend to be governed by and I will comply with the following provisions:

(1) That I am hereby advised and I understand that Federal law such as

Title 18, United States Code, Sections 793, 794, and 798; Order of the

President of the United States (Executive Order 11652); and regulations

issued by the Attorney General of the United States (28 Code of Federal

Regulations, Sections 16.21 through 16.26) prohibit loss, misuse, or un-

authorized disclosure or production of national security information, other

classified information and other nonclassified information in the files of

the FBI;

(2) I understand that unauthorized disclosure of information in the files

of the FBI or information I may acquire as an employee of the FBI could

result in impairment of national security, place human life in jeopardy, or

result in the denial of due process to a person or persons who are subjects

of an FBI investigation, or prevent the FBI from effectively discharging its

responsibilities. I understand the need for this secrecy agreement; there-

fore, as consideration for employment I agree that I will never divulge,

publish, or reveal either by word or conduct, or by other means disclose to

any unauthorized recipient without official written authorization by the

Director of the FBI or his delegate, any information from the investigatory

files of the FBI or any information relating to material contained in the files,

or disclose any information or produce any material acquired as a part of the

performance of my official duties or because of my official status. The burden

is on me to determine, prior to disclosure, whether information may be disclosed

and in this regard I agree to request approval of the Director of the FBI in each

such instance by presenting the full text of my proposed disclosure in writing to

the Director of the FBI at least thirty (30) days prior to disclosure. I understand

that this agreement is not intended to apply to information which has been placed

in the public domain or to prevent me from writing or speaking about the FBI but

it is intended to prevent disclosure of information where disclosure would be

contrary to law, regulation or public policy. I agree the Director of the FBI is

in a better position than I to make that determination;

(3) I agree that all information acquired by me in connection with my official

duties with the FBI and all official material to which I have access remains

the property of the United States of America, and I will surrender upon demand

by the Director of the FBI or his delegate, or upon separation from the FBI, any

material relating to such information or property in my possession;

(4) That I understand unauthorized disclosure may be a violation of Federal

law and prosecuted as a criminal offense and in addition to this agreement may

be enforced by means of an injunction or other civil remedy.

I accept the above provisions as conditions for my employment and continued employment

in the FBI. I agree to comply with these provisions both during my employment in the FBI and

following termination of such employment.

OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

WASHINGTON, D. C.

May 15, 1956

ORDER NO. 116-56

It is the policy of the Department of Justice to extend the fullest

possible cooperation to congressional committees requesting Information from

departmental files, interviews with department employees, testimony of depart-

ment personnel, or testimony of Federal prisoners. The following procedures

are prescribed in order to effectuate this policy on a basis which will be

mutually satislactory to the congressional committees and to the Department.

(This order supersedes the Deputy Attorney General's Memorandum No. 5, datei

March 23, 1953, and his Memorandum No. 97, dated August 5, 1954. It formal-

1zes the Attorney General's press release of November 5, 1953, establishing

procedures to permit cormittees of the Congress and their authorized repre-

sentatives to interview and to take sworn testimony from Federal prisoners.

It supplements Order No. 3229 (Revised) dated January 13, 1953, and Order

ma to tong end date Janary

No. 3464, Supplement No. 4 (Revised) dated January 13,

1953 (with Memorandum

of "Authorization Under Order No. 3464 Supplement No. 4 (Revised)" dated

January 13, 1953), Insofar as said orders have reference to procedures to be

followed in the Department's relations with congressional committees. In

support of this order, reference should be had to the President's letter

dated May 17, 1954, addressed to the Secretary of Defense, and to the Attorney

General's Memorandum which accompanied it.

A. REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM DEPARTMENT FILES

1. Congressional committee requests for the examination of files

or other confidential information should be reduced to writing, signed by

the chairman of the committee, and addressed to the Deputy Attorney General;

who is responsible for the coordination of our liaison with Congress and

congressional committees. The request shall state the specific Information

sought as well as the specific objective for which it is sought. The Deputy

Attorney General will forward the request to the appropriate division where a

reply will be prepared and returned for the Deputy Attorney General's signa-

ture and dispatch to the chairman of the committee.

2.

If the request concerns a closed case, 1. e., one in which

there is no litigation or administrative action pending or contemplated,

the file may be made available for review in the Department, in the presence

of the official or employee having custody thereof. The following procedure

shall be followed in such cases:

a. The reply letter will advise the committee that the

file is available for examination and set forth the

name, telephone extension number, and room number of

the person who will have custody of the file to be

reviewed;

NW 65994 Docld:32176523 Page 28

---

## Page 29

- 2 -

b. Before making the file available to the committee

representative all reports and memoranda from the FBI

as well as investigative reports from any other agency,

will be removed from the file and not be made available

for examination; provided however that if the committee

representative states that it is essential that information

from the FBI reports and memoranda be made available,

he will be advised that the request will be considered

by the Department. Thereafter a summary of the contents

of the fBl reports and memoranda involved will be

prepared which will not disclose Investigative tech-

niques, the identity of confidential informants, or

other matters which might jeopardize the Investigative

operations of the FBI. This summary will be forwarded

by the division to the FBI with a request for advice as

to whether the FBI has any objection to examination of

no the F5

such summary by the committee representative.

The file

will not be physically relinquished from the custody of

the Department. If the committee representative desires

to examine investigative reports from other government

agencies, contained in the files of the Department, he

will be advised to direct his request to the agency whose

reports are concerned.

3. If the request concerns an open case, 1. e., one which liti-

gation or administrative action is pending or contemplated, the file may

not be made available for examination by the committee's representative.

The following procedure shall be followed:

3.

The reply letter should advise the committee that

its request concerns a case in which litigation or

administrative action is pending or contemplated, and

state that the file cannot be made available until the

case is completed; and

b. Should briefly set forth the status of the case in

as much detail as is practicable and prudent without

jeopardizing the pending contemplated litigation or

administrative action.

B. REQUESTS FOR INTERVIES WITH DEPARTMENTAL PERSONNEL

1. Requests for interviews with departmental personnel regarding

ny official matters within the department should be reduced to writing

igned by the chairman of the committee, and addressed to the Deputy Attorne

General. When the approval of the Deputy Attorney General is given, the

employee is expected to discuss such matters freely and cooperatively with

the representative, subject to the limitations prescribed in A respecting

open cases and data in investigative reports;

NW 65994 Docld:32176523 Page 29

---

## Page 30

- 3-

2. Upon the completion of the interview with the committee repre-

sentative the employee will prepare a summary of it for the file, with a

copy routed to his division head and a copy routed to the Deputy Attorney

General.

C. EMPLOYEES TESTIKYING BEFORE CONCRESSIONAL COMMITTEES

1. When an employee is requested to testify before a congressional

committee regarding official matters within the Department the Deputy Attorney

General shall be promptly informed.

Then the Deputy Attorney General's approv-

al is given the employee is expected to testify freely subject to limitations

prescribed in A respecting open cases and data in investigative reports;

2. An employee subpoenaed to testify before a congressional committee

on official matters within the Department shall promptly notify the Deputy

Attorney General.

In general he shall be guided in testifying by Order 3229

(Revised) and the President's letter of May 17, 1954, cited at the beginning

of this Order.

3. Upon the completion of his testimony the employee will prepare

a memorandum outlining his testimony with a copy routed to his division head

and a copy routed to the Deputy Attorney General.

D. REQUESTS OF CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES FOR THE TESTIMONY OF FEDERAL PRISONERS

Because of the custodial hazards involved and the extent to which

their public testimony may affect the discipline and well-being of the institu-

tion, it is the policy of the Department not to deliver Federal prisoners out-

the penal institution in which they are Incarcerated for the purpose of

being intervieved or examined under oath by congressional committees. However,

when it appears that no pending investigation or legal proceeding will be

adversely affected thereby and that the public interest will not be otherwise

adversely affected, Federal prisoners may be interviewed or examined under oath

by congressional committees in the institution in which they are incarcerated

under the following procedures, and with the specific advance approval of the

Deputy Attorney General.

1. Arrangements for interviewing and taking of sworn testimony

from a Federal prisoner by a committee of the Congress or the authorized

representatives of such a committee shall be made in the form of a written

request by the chairman of the cormittee to the Deputy Attorney General.

2. Such written request shall be made at least ten (10) days

prior to the requested date for the interview and the taking of testimony

and shall be accompanied by written evidence that authorization for the

interview or the taking of sworn testimony was approved by vote of the com-

mittee.

Such request shall contain a statement of the purpose and the sub-

jects upon which the prisoner will be interrogated as well as the names of

all persons other than the representatives of the Department of Justice who

will be present.

3. A member of the interested committee of the Congress shall be

present during the entire time of the interrogation.

= 4 =

4.

The warden of the penal institution in which the Federal

prisoner 1s Incarcerated shall, at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to the

time at which the interview takes place, advise the Federal prisoner concerned

of the proposed interview or taling of sior testimony; and shall further

advise that he 1s under the same, but no greater obligation to answer than any

other, witness who is not a prisoner.

5. The warden of the penal institution shall have complete

authority in conformity with the requirements of security and the mainte-

nance of discipline to limit the number of persons who will be present at

the interview and taking of testimony.

6.

The warden or his authorized representative shall be present

at the interview and at the taking of testimony and the Department of Justice

shall have the right to have one of its representatives present throughout

the interview and taking of testimony.

7. The committee shall arrange to have a stenographic transcript

made of the entire proceedings at committee expense and shall furnish a copy

of the transcript to the Department of Justice.

E. OBSERVERS IN ATTENDANCE AT COMMITTEE HEARINGS

In order that the Department may be kept currently advised in

matters within its responsibility, and in order that the Deputy Attorney

General may properly coordinate the Department's liaison with Congress and

'its committees, each division that has an observer in attendance at a

congrssional hearing, will have the observer prepare a written summary of

the proceeding which

should be sent to the division head and a copy routed

to the Deputy Attorney General.

SUPERVISORS CONFERENCE NOTES

#9-75 (5/6/75)

Senstudy 75

Captioned matter pertains to Bureau's handling of

requests from Senate and House Select Committes to study

Governmental operations with respect to intelligence activities.

In connection with work of these committes, staff members may

seek to interview current and former FBI employees.

Recently, the Senate Select Committee (SSC) staff

has interviewed several former employees and it is antici-

pated that many more such personnel will be contacted.

The FBI has pledged full cooperation with the committe

and we wish to assist and facilitate any investigations undertaken

by the committee with respect to the FBI. However, we do have

an obligation to insure that sensitive sources and mehhods and

ongoing sensitive investigations are fully protected. Should

any former employee contact your office and have any question

regarding his obligation not to divulge information obtained by

virtue of his past FBI employment, he should be instructed to

contact Legal Counsel, FBIHQ, by collect call. Your conver-

sations with former employees must be in keeping with our

pledge.

It is believed such a procedure would insure proper

protection and also facilitate the work of the ssc.

The above procedure also applies to current employees

of this office.

However, contact with the Legal Counsel should

be handled through the SAC..

Re:

Interview of SA DOUGLAS MAC DOUGALL.

by, SSC members

On September

1975, SA DOUGLAS MAC DOUGALL WaS

interviewed from 10:00 AM to 11:25 AM by JAMES DICK and

PAUL WALLACH of the

SSC.

WALLACH left the interview at

approximately 10:45 AM.

While walking to, the interview room, laulach asked

"off the record, how do the men in the field feel about the

SSC investigation''. SA MAC DOUGALL tOld WALLACH that on or

off the record the Agents were unaninously afraid of the resuits

of the investigation.

For years we have been successful mainly

because we were trusted.

Information given to us was held in

confidence.

Now that the Senate has access to a great deal of

classified infornation who knows what will happen. WALLACH

was asked if he would like to furnish information

to the FBI

in confidence after he read other classified information,

obviously leaked by someone, printed in the New York Times

for example.

WALLACH did not pursue the discussion.

DICK told SA MAC DOUGALL that he had the right to have

an attorney present; that he can terminate the interview at

will and can decline to answer questions. No form was submitted

fOr SA MAC DOUGALL tO Sign.

DICK asked how long SA MAC DOUGALL had been in the

FBI, when assigned to the NYO, when assigned to espionage

matters and where assigned prior to the NYO. He asked for

SA MAC DOUGALL'S home address and telephone number. All of

these questions were answered.

SA MAC DOUGALL was asked the current organizational

setup of the New York Office of the FBI.

The SSC interyiewers

were told that J.

WALLACE IA PRADE iS the ADIC; the five MYO

divisions were related to then and they were told the names

of three SAC's. Due to interrupting questions they did not

get the names of the sacs of divisions.

DICK asked for the organizational setup: of Division

that there are ten squads and eight handle Sovlet matters while

two handle Sateliite matters.

SA MAC DOUGALL waS asked if he wished to place &

maid cover in & case assigned to hima what steps would be

taken. He was then asked what the follow-up steps would

be taken by FBI personnel and Post Office personnel to put

the maid cover into effect.

SA MAC DOUGALL answered as follows:

He would present the facts of the case to his

Supervisor, ChARLES T. WEIS, who would then present

MAC DOUGALL's written recomendation to SAC ROBERT DaVE.

II Dend thought it had merit, it would be reconnended to

FBIHQ.

If rBild approved the proposal, mail cover would

then

be requested by

FBIHQ through the

Post Office at

Washington, D.C.

When the post Office notified FBIHQ that

the maid cover

would be put into effect, the NYO would be

notiided and SAS of the NYO would work out with Poatal

Inspectors the mechanics of collecting the information

gathered in the nail cover.

DICK aSked 1I SA MAC DOUGALL had ever participated

in & mall

cover.

DICK waS told that SA MAC DOUGALl was Involved

in preliminary discussions with Postal Ispectors, concerning

a mand cover in 19%d.

DICK said he knew of this case and wanted

to know why SA MAC DOUGALL decided at that time to institute

a mail cover when the bureau policy, at that time, and for the

past few years had been to approve no requests for mail or trash

covers.

DICK was told that the idea of instituting a nadl, cover

at that time, had been brought up by FBold who had instructed

the nio to subalt recommendations re a unid cover. SA LAC DoUGaL

had consulted with Postal Inspector JOSIRH BOYLE 10 deteruine 11

& mail cover would be conducted with secirity. DiCK asked why

SA MAC DOUGAL had specifically gone to BOYLE.

DICK was told

that BOYlE was the man in the position ol authority, (Chief

Postal Inspector, Bronx, New York) plus BOYLE was known to

other sAS of the

NYO who had known BOYLE for years and

recommended hin as a highly trustworthy individual.

DICk asked if the mail cover mis subsequently put

into effect.

He was told that it had been after the FBIll!

had requested it fron Post Office Headgurters.

DICK asked how the Information from the mail cover

WBS

furnished to the FBI. He was told that an SA of the FBI

regularly visits the Postal Inspectors and gets this material.

DICK asked how frequently this material is picked up.

MAC DOUGAlL sald he does not know; it may be dally or weekly

or may vary according to other conditions in the case.

DICK asked if SA MAC DOUGALL had ever had in his

possession a "post Office mall box key", SA MAC DOUGALL

answered that for a short time he had such a key. DICK asted

a number of questions concerning this key and SA MAC DOUGALI

related the following:

To the best of SA MAC DOUGALL's recollection, in

the Christmas Season of 1971, the Post Office had to temporarily

suspend the mall cover because of the Christmas mail rush.

SA MAC DOUGALL asked someone in the Postal Inspectors Office

(identity not recalled) if it would be possible for an Inspector

to go to the address where the subject of the mail cover lived

and get the mail out of the box after it was delivered by the

carrier.

This was done, but the Inspectors refused to continue

to do this because they were too busy to devote a man to this

every day. At that time SA MAC DOUGALL asked 1f he could have.

the key and get the mail without the Postal Inspector.

It

was assuned by SA MAC DOUGAlL that this would merely be

implementing the mail cover at a different location.

SA

HAC DOUGALI believes he was given a Post Office key, but after

& short time (a lew minutes or a couple of hours) the Inspector

said that he could not let SA MAC DoUGAll have the key and

retrieved it. It was never used. Neither the Supervisorsor

the SAC were specifically told of the key. The Supervisor was

told that attempts to reinstitute the mil cover during the

Christnas season were unsuccessiul.

SA NAC DOUGALI, was asked if he had been Involved

In any other mail covers.

The answer was no.

DICK asked

1f SA MAC DOUGALL knew of any other mail covers.. DICK was

told that SA MAC DOUGAll is sure there are others, but will not

discuss them.

SA MAC DOUGAlL was asked If the natl cover instituted

in 1971 1s still in operation.

SA MAC DOUGALL said be thinks

so, but is not sure.

DICK asked if nail covers are put on for speciiic

periods of time; how is renewal obtained and who approves the

renewad.

He was told that & mail cover is approved by FBIH@

for & specific period; prior to the expiration of the period

the field office must

present a reasonable argument for extension

of the mail cover.

If the Bureau concurs the mall cover is

then continued for another specific period.

In & question connected with nothing previously mentioned

DICK asked 1£

ED GAMBER had been assigned to Section 37 with

SA MAC DOUGALL.

DICK was told that GAlleR bad at one time

been on the same squad as MAC DOUGAll, but had also worked

on a sumber of other squads.

DICK asked if there is any tine an sA would ask

& Postal Inspoctor for Intornation without going through

He was told that we would, and have in the past,

when following a subject, seeday him man& letter; ve have

had the inspectors retrieve the letter and copled the information

fron the envelope.

At approximately bids An, dill sald he now wanted

to discuss "na1l opening".

He was ToLd That tILS WaS OutSIde

the scope of matters SA unC DoUGAll was authorized to discuss.

DICK said he would call PAUL DALY of the Logal Orfice of tbe

FBI &nd secure permission.

After DICK sade thia caid he said

that DALY wanted MAC DOUCAll to return io FBIld and discuss

this matter. DICK said he would plan to continue the

interview in the afternoon.

At FBIHQ, MAC DOUGALL adviSed DALY that he did not

wish to get into an intervlew concerning "mall opentug" until

he had an opportunity to discuss this with bos attorney.

Since

the attorney was in New York City and this matter could not be

discussed on the phone SA MAC DOUGALL roturned to New York.

SENSTUDY

On the afternoon of 9/26/75, I was in contact with

Bureau supervisor SEYMOR F. PHILLIPS.

Referring to a previous

telephone call on 9/26/75, between SAC DENZ and Mr. PHILLIPS,

Mr. PHILLIPS advised as follows:

SA DANIEL A. FLYNN (NYO) was authorized to proceed

to Washington, DC on Tuesday, 9/30/75, for the purpose of

reviewing the transcript of

his testimony previously given

before the Senate Select Committee (SSC) • Mr. PHILLIPS stated

that SA FLYNN should contact Mr. DICK of the SSC and insured

that Mr. DICK would be available on 9/30/75.

Concerning any corrections which SA FLYNN might

note in his transcript, Mr. PHILLIPS furnished the following

• information:

According to SSC rules, only minor changes in

grammar can be made when reviewing the transcript. SA FLYNN

should review his notes of his earlier testimony and review

the contents of an LHM he has previously furnished to the

Bureau concerning his earlier testimony. If SA FLYNN should

observe any corrections as to substance in the transcript, he

should bring this to Mr. DICK'S attention. LIf: these

corrections of substance are not made by Mr. DICK, SA FLYNN,

when he returns to the NYO, should prepare an LHM for the

Bureau setting forth what he considers to be inaccuracies

in substance •

On the afternoon of 9/26/75, I advised SA FLYNN

of the above.

of an Agent testifying before staff members of the Senate

Select Committee should be prepared carefully. As example,

PHILLIPS advised that we should not use abbreviations such

as ADIC, Division III, Division IV, Division V, etc., of the

NO without explaining what these terms mean.

PHILLIPS

pointed out that these letterheads go to the

to the Department, and recipients are not knowledgeable as to

not the white Hous as to

some Bureau terminology.

In addition, the letterhead should reflect who were

the interviewers.

In most cases, they are staff members and

not Committee members.

Committee members, as we know, are

Senators.

the place and time of interview should be included.

The caption of the cover communication should be "SENSTUDY

1975", with no character.

Any questions asked by the staff

which

are set out in the LHM should include the answer given

to such question.

The cover is not usually classified,

although NY has done so in the past. The LHM, of course,

will be classified in practically every, case.
