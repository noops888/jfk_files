it is obvious they had to liquidate him (OSWALD) so he wouldn't talk.

JARDON agrees and adds that precisely so that he (OSWALD) wouldn't

talk, the job is made more difficult (to find out plot of assassination

of Kennedy). JARDON says the International situation will become

serious. CARAM says what a ridiculous thing to think that a bar man

(cantinero) is able to mix with the police and kill OSWALD; In this mess

Press reported OSWALD entered Mexico 26 Sept with tourist card given him

by Mexican Consul in New Orleans on 17 Sept. Press confirmed that

26 Sept OSWALD crossed border by Mill Nuevo Laredo, Tamps., the following

day to Mexi City by road. On 27 Sept he went to Cuban Consulate General

to request visa to transit Cuba because he was going to to go to Moscow

via Habana. Consul Eusebio AZCUE told OSWALD that he would have to

consult his government, that the paper work required 10 to 12 days.

OSWALD,

because of his irritable character, became annoyed with AZCUE

and left the office slamming the door.

On 28 Sept OSWALD went to the

Consul General of the Sov Union

to request a visa for Russia. He said

in helping his case, that his wife was a Sor citizen; that he was a

militant Communist and had lived three yre in Russia. OSWALD told the

Sor Consul that he could verify

this quiokly by calling his wife who was

at that time in New Orleans In a hotel. The Sov Consul said he would

have to consult with his government and that ordinarily a case like this

would take from three to four months. OSWALD again became annoyed as he

had the day before in the Cuban Embassy and left the office very mad.

OSWALD returned to Texas on 3 Oct via the border of Nuevo Laredo, Tamps.

Investigations so far do not indicate that OSWALD interviewed higher

officials of the Sov and Cuban Embassies.

no this could not be true because one was a Jew, that it is definitely

a group of Fascists, very American, he is owner of & Cabaret of nudists

and belongs to political gangsters. Cecilia says it is absurd that

they let him enter (Ruby entering jail where OSWALD vas). Julieta says

he (Ruby) was there from the first day, that he began to mix with the

police and newspapermen. It was perfectly planned, Indeed some of the

police

probably are of the same organization because Ruby putxthugua

Cecilia agrees, the picture is evidence of that because the police

Cecilia says everything about it is strange as the paper stated

they found this character (Ruby) drinking Coca Cola on the second fluor

everything was absurd, that he was a Communist. Cecilia says this type

(OSWALD) could not be nuts because the whole thing was so perfectly

planned and that is evident since the bullet was aimed at Kennedy.

Juliets believes that this is all done by extreme rightists planned irom

very high up and that 1s why they had to kill OSWALD so he couldn't talk.

Julieta adds that she hopes they will wake up a little with this business

and pay attention to what has happened because it is evident it is ail a

conspiracy of rightist groups and military men.

She adds that in a very.

obvious way this individual' (OSWALD) pretended he was a Communist to!

prepare the groundwork.

Cecilia believes that he even purposely married

the Russian girl.

Julieta comments that all was very well prepared,

step by step to blame the Communists, but that now with this (OSWALD's

death) everything is more complicated and they couldn't continue (the

Investigation) and even the Dallas police said that with the death of

OSWALD the case was closed,.

but the FBI answered immediately that it was

not closed, that on the contrary, they had to open an investigation and

also the Senate will name a commission to Investigate, and Julieta hopes

they won't be alarmed at whatever may be turned up.

She adds that each

time more details a confirm that OSWALD was a Fascist and this business of

trying to Join an anti-Castro organization and later poke his nose into

the Fair Play for Cuba surely all of this was made up by the Dallas police.

Likewise she indicates that all the speeches given try to imply that he

If things come out, that she hopes the public will be shaken up

so that they will stop this tendency toward Fascism. Julieta continues

that at the beginning she thought it was caused by racial trouble but

now she thinks it is something more than that; 1t is a national thing

well planned and that OSWALD was not just acting spontaneously. Cecilia

agrees, indeed it was a perfect shot with exact calculation and could not

have been done spontaneously. Julieta says that his (OSWALD's) death

was evidently to shut him up and they had better not say now that Ruby

was at the moment emotional (when he shot OSWALD) because Ruby is the

type who could never be pictured asa great patriot since he has a

criminal record. Cecilia believes that Johnson (Pres.) and all those

people are paying attention to the strenghth in this. Julieta is sure

of this and adds that the news (press) was rediculous in respect to

OSWALD in that he went to marry a Russian, later was photographed with

Dally Worker; with the Communist newspaper in one hand and a Troskyist

one in the other hand; thus everything was very well prepared to blame

the leftists; Indeed this has always been the way they have done it,

commit the terrorist acts and then try to make it appear that the acts

were done by the Communists; that has always been the

tactic and only.

the paople that have no idea about politics can swallow those things.

She adds that this is very dangerous, indeed when they are able to assassinate

a president Ilke kennedy, imagine how strong they are in the United States.

DIR 84938 - Since U.S. Immigration records next to nothing on travel

of U.s. citizens, pls ask Mexi Immigration to check all their records

since June 62, when OSWALD returned from Sov Union, to see if he entered

or left Mexico at any other time than the 26 Sept to 3 Oot 63. We still

do not know what if anything OSWALD told his Dallas interrogators about

travel to Mexi. We also need info on who traveled with him and what

vehicle he used on his Sept-Oct 63 trip and on any other trips. Does

Next government have any way of tellling what other toursit cards he

might have had? If so, pls ask them.

follows, &)

Contront Silvia with Nic and have Nic inform her of details his statement

to us. : b) Tell Sivlia she only living non-Cuban who knows full story and hence in same

position as OSWALD prior to his assassination, her only chance for survival is to come

clean with whole story and to cooperate completely with Mexi Gov in return for Mexi Gov

protection, c) She will not in any case be allowed to leave Mexi.

/ Given apparent

character of Silvia there would appear to be good chance of her cracking when confronted

with details of deal between OSWALD, AZCUE, MERABAL and Silvia and unknown Cuben negro.

If she did break - and we suggest Mexicans

should be asked to go all out in seeing that

she does we and Mexicans would have needed corroboration of statement of the Nic

Also suggest Moxi Gov identify and arrest unknown negro. Have Mexican rearrest Silvia

so as to eliminate possibility of her being smuggled out of Mexi to Cuba or killed here.

We lack established reliability of Nic, but suggest that DORIICOS' preoccupation with

MEXI 7104 Amb Mann asks that following be passed to sec. Rusk.

He presumes KUBARK and

ODENVY will be advised.

since my cable of yesterday (MaXI 7072 - para 97 above) there have

been three principal developments: 1) Amb HERNANDEZ Armas at 1839 hrs last evening called

DORTICOS of Cuba. In this conversation, which Ilke the first is tared, DORTICOS expressed

continued concern over possibility that Mexi police had Interrogated Silvia about money.

2) ALVARADO, the Nic, was questioned by CAS officer until two a.m. this morning:

This

officer was impressed by ALVARADO who has offered make himself available as a witness and

who is now hiding in place provided by CAs. We cannot guarantee ALVARADO's safety.

wealth

of detail ALVARADO gives about events and personalities Involved with OSWALD 1n Cub Emb

is striking.

3) At 1215 hrs Next time 27 Nov., CAS officer was admised by phone by

ECHEVERRIA that he had rearrested Silvia today because he learned she was attempting to

leave Next for Habana.

However, Echeverria later told LEGAT that be had decided to rearrest

Silvia to avoid any possibility she might escapt to Cuba and later be unavailable as a

witness.

Since we had received no reply to yesterday's telegrem (MEXI 7072 - para 97 above)

we have not requested Mexi gov to takeg any action against Silvia except to maintain

Increased surveillance of her activities. Echeverria later denied to LEGAT that he had any

specifio concrete evidence that she was about to leave for Cuba. We do not now know which

Echeverria statements are accurate. It is quite possible, and even probable, that contra-

dictory statements made by Echeverria are explained by desire of GOM to play down importance

of OSWALD visit here. Mexi line still is that OSWALD visit related solely to visa question.

Consistent with this Echeverria stated to LEGAT that DORIICOS only interested in finding

out whether Mexi authorities tried to pay a story from silvia.:

This is obviously incorrect

Interpretation Neither LOPEZ Mateor nor Echeverria know of ALVARADO's story. Pls note

that according Echeverria Silvia 1s being taken to Attorney General's office to which

Mexi press has easy access.

Possiblity of habeas corpus cannot be discounted.

have as yet found no trace of the red beaded Cub negro described by ALVARADO, but are

continuing our search for him.

5) In addition to questions raised in yesterday's telegram

seing OSWALD take money in Cub Emb, urge you follow up with his locsl NIC case officer and

avail yourself of the help of the Nic service, which & can send ERITYROID 3, a good

KUBARK asset, to help in Interrogation. We find it incredible that the Cubans would

brief and pay an assassin in front of ta Nic interloper. We think it possible or even

likely that be has been in and out of Cub Emb as a Nic agent trying to Infiltrate cuba

and has picked up names and faces there in so doing. All he has suld about OSWALD he could

have gotten from the press, except for certain incorrect items such as his statement that

OSWALD wore glasses. / The fact that ALVARADO 1s a calm, nice and Intelligent young man

does not mean he is not fabricator. Fyi we and other agencies are being flooded by

fabrications on the OSWALD case from several continents some originating with people on the

fringes of the Intelligence business. Such fabrications are not usually done for money,

but out di sickly fancy and a desire to get into the intel game. / We do not think it a

remarkable coincidence that both DORTICOS and ALVARADO talk about money paid to OSWALD.

For one thing, pay for an assassin 1s a factor which immediately rises in the mind of

expert and layman alike.

Secondly, DORICOS may have heard through some Russian of Cuban

source in the Mexi government that DURAN was asked whether the Cubans paid OSWALD for the

alleged assignment.

While we do not insist that ALVARADO's story is beyond all belief

we do urge that Mexi place it and ALVARADO under the most searching scrutiny. His interro-

gators must probe deeply into his make-up and lead him back through the though processes

which may have led him to z make this possible mis-step. In securing confessions of

= fabrication, a sympathetic attitude, stressing awareness of the severe mental strain

the subject must be under, and with generous recognition of his "basically fine mocivation"

coupled with promises of face-saving secrecy, and even specious hopes of "useful" future

cooperation are often effective.

Hanse Hours must be devoted to these tactics.: / Have

Apparently they did react spontaneously, but then you could look at Mexi's vote

have been observed indicate by postmark that ROJAS was in Cozumel, butz at a later period

than he has stated and apparently for at least three to possibly five months, which contra-

diets information received fron Daniel SOLIS, who stated Ylario ROSAS Villanueva was in Cozumel

for about 2 weeks in June 63. ROJAS readily admits that he, ROJAS, is the uncle of SOLIS's

wife. / A verification of his reported travel to the U.S. border, namely, Nuevo Laredo, has

been established, although not on the specific dates furnished by ROJAS.

CMA records reflect

one Hilario ROJAS was on flt from Guadalajara to Nuevo Laredo on 3 Aug 62. i CMA records

further reflect that a telegram dated 31 July 62 at Nuevo Laredo authorized the CMA ticket

office at Guadalajara to issue a ticket to Hilario ROJAS of 665 Chilarde Street, Gundalajara.

It is noted that ROJAS has stated that he formerly resided at Chilarde Street in Guadalajara.)

ROJAS appears to be in normal physical condition and no outward signs observed of any mo...1

deficiency.

He did not reveal any mental quirks.

He tends to be voluble in his conversa-

tions and to wander from specific lines of questioning. / He appears to react mentally in a

manner reflecting innate Intelligence superior to that of his stated sixth grade education. /

He does not volunteer any motive for furnishing info to the U. S.

Gov concerning his alleged

association with unidentified Cubans and with OSWALD, both at U.S. border and at Cozumel.

Other than discrepancies anting noted in various interviews conducted with ROJAS, the only

apparently unusual development concerns a reportedly second letter that he has directed to

U. S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy, wherein he,

according to his own statement, stated

that he had additional info to furnish.

According to ROJAS, this additional info concerned

a so-called camera which he saw in Cozumel in the possession of the unidentified Bubans and

OSWALD, which camera reportedly had adaptations which could be utilized to fire about five

cartridges, which cartridges reportedly have a small gas compartment and that said gas was

for the purpose of cutting down on the noise made in firing said camera.

He also described

a rifle supposedly in the possession of these previously mentioned individuals.

He claims to

have beenxgal told by the Cubans that the "camera" was worth about $50,000 and

invention. / Attitude toward Polygraph Examination:

was a Russian

It was explained to ROJAS that it might

be-necessary in the future to afford him a scientific examination with the use of certaini

instruments. He said he would be agreeable to such an examination. / Attitude of Mexican

Government re Polygraph Examination:

It is assumed that, as in the past case of the Nic,

Echeverria should be su consulted and his authorization obtained to conduct said examination.

At the same time, he can also be told that general results of exam would be

furnished him.

/It is further suggested that the full name of ROJAS should be furnished Echeverria and the

fact that he would be examined either in Guadalajara or Mexi., There does not appear to be

any reason for Echeverria to be furnished the iden of the Polygraph examiner..

numberas available and recording opposite the seat number assigned, the name and destination

of the individual requesting the reservations. That reservation is respected under normal

conditions until two hours before departure time; however, in the event all seats are not

filled, 1t may be held until the actual departure of the bus. Prior to the departure of

the bus, a final check is made of passengers in connection with tickets sold for that

particular trip, and at that time the dispatcher communicates by radio to the company

headquarters in Monterrey the number of "paying" passengers on the bus in relation to the

Monterrey or Laredo destinations for which they purchased tickets. / Francisco ALVARADO,

ticket salesman and dispatcher for Iransportes Frontera, advised that he prepared most of

the handwriting on the 2 Oct 63 manifest on which the name

"OSWLD" and destination "Lared"

appear opposite Seat No. 4.

He stated that he did not write the

"OSWLD" reservation info

and it was his opinion that the reservation had been made and the info recorded by the

baggage handler, Lucio LOPEZ.

ALVARADO is quite certain at the present time that the

Individual designated on the list as "OSWLD" did not purchase a ticket and did not travel

on the trip relating to that manifest. No ticket number was recorded for that person, and

a search of the company's records in Monterrey had failed to locate a ticket stub which

was not otherwise accounted for in connection with that particular trip. / : The notations

by ALVARADO of "9 Laredo, T Monterrey" reflected that he had reported by radio to the

Monterrgy office of the company that the bus had departed with nine "paying" passengers

for Laredo and seven "paying" passengers destined for Monterrey. Listed under "Name of

Passengers" were "OSWID" with no ticket number, indicating he did not travel; "Angel PEREZ"

with no ticket number or destingtion, which confirmed that he had not purchased a ticket

the back of the manifest referred to advances of funds made by ALVARADO to LOZANO from the

cash for repairs, parts or other requirements. They related that the passenger lists

are not kept as a permanent record, and, when the manifest was located in the "trash"

at the request of investigators of the Mexi Presidential Staff, the Blanks at the tope

of the form had not been filled in as to time, destination, trip number, bus number, and

date, but they had completed those blanks from their personal knowledge in order to

make

that data clear to the investigators. They also had listed the names of the drivers on the

formax at that tice. They affirmed that the handwritten "Transportes Frontera" at the top

of the document had been added by some official of the Mexi Government after the document

was borrowed from them. / Both LOZANO and ALVARADO stated that they had no recollection of

OSWALD, etc... they could offer no explanation as to how Mexican authorities had arrived

at the conclusion that OSWALD had travelled on the Transportes Frontera bus of 2 Oct 63,

but pointed out that after the name was located on the manifest, they had not been given

an opportunity of reviewing, analyzing or checking out the data thereon. / Lucio LOPEZ

Medina, baggage and freight handler at Transportes, related that he often assists the

ticket salesman by recording reservations and is quite certain that he wrote the "OSWLD"

and "TARED"

opposite Seat No. 4 on the passenger manifest of 2 Oct 63. He stated that he

MEMO from LEGAT to COS: Lee Harvey OSWALD. Hotel accommodation of OSWALD in Mexi City.

Info verifying OSWALD stayed at Hotel del Comercio, Located at Calle Bernardino de Sahagun

No. 19, in room No. 18. OSWALD registered as "LEE, HARVEY OSWALD, USA, TEXAS, PHOTO, US

citizen". Owner and manager of hotel, Guillermo GARCIA Luna cooperated with LEGAT.

had FBI Laboratory check handwriting of hotel registry of OSWALD with true signature and

was found identical. / List of names and residences, room numbers and dates of occupancy

of those registered at hotel during time OSWALD was there. / GARCIA Luna received

at Hotel del Comercio at between 1000 and 1100; OSWALD's room No. 18 was 16.00 pesos daily

with bath, that the registry book indicates OSWALD stayed at hotel night of 1-2 Oct and

departed during the day of 2 Oct 63.: GARCIA Luna could not recall circumstances of OSWALD'S

departure nor the hour. He believed OSWALD neither spoke nor understood any Spanish. He

had not observed OSWALD in the hotel during the day and he was never accompanied by any

He recalled that OSWALD carried a medium-size, brown handbag, which had

and was either of Naugahyde or canvas material. He did not remembe: that OSWALD had ever

worn a coat and believed he usually appeared in a short sleeved shirt of a knit variety.

Matilde GARNICA, maid lat the hotel del Comercio, recognized photo of OSWALD as being the

young American who had occupied room No. 18 for almost a week during the latter part of

last year. She arrives at work between 0900 and 1000 and leaves at 2100. Clearly recalls

OSWALD, as few Americans stay at the hotel: He had few personal effects, carried in a

"small, brown, zippered handbag" canvas or imitation leather material. She had seen OSWALD

the day of his arrival and the following Saturday as he " still was in his room wher she

checked to determine

which rooms were available for cleaning.

When she saw him in the room

on Saturday he said "good morning" in English, and a short time later left the hotel.

claimed she spoke to OSWALD that Saturday morning

he was in his room.

without wearing a coat???

If OSWALD ate meals at 1400 at restaurant

next door to hotel, why was he never seen at

hotel during the day? Did he never enter his

room during the day, after lunch, to wash his

hands? Why, if he were in area of Cub or Sov

Emb or Colonia Condesa, would he return to the

hotel location to eat, yet not be seen at the

Negro?? Any connection?? Broncht up by GARCIA

Luna because of efforts to locate him so he

could pay the bill??

SECRET

Sebastian PEREZ Hernandez, desk clerk and assistant to the owner of the Hotel del Comercio,

had not conversed with OSWALD but remembered him clearly because few Americans stay at the

hotel. He said OSWALD left the hotel each morning and did not return until evening, possibly

after PEREZ Hernandez had completed his working day and left the hotel. OSWALD was alone

and usually wore a knit, short-sleeved sport shirt and no coat or jacket.

He did not remember

seeing OSWALD depart the hotel on the morning of 2 Oct, but tw It was possible that the

night watchman, who remains at the reception desk during the night might have been aware of

OSWALD's departure from the hotel. Watchman is Pedro RODRIGUEZ who could be located at the

hotel after 2100 or during the early morning hours. / Pedro RODRIGUEZ Ledesma's werking hours

are from 2100 to 09D0, however, he often is able to leave the hotel by 0800 or earlier if

the owner and manager, Guillermo GARCIA Luna, has arrived to relieve him and handle reception

duties. He clearly recalls the young American whom he later identified in his mind as

OSWALD and remembers that on the date of the latter's departure from the hotel and on the

basis of sign language and the word "taxi" which he understood that OSWALD wanted a taxicab,

RODRIGUEZ walked around the corner from the hotel where he obtained a taxicab. He believed

OSWALD left the hotel between 0630 and 0700 since it was getting light when he went in

search of the taxicab. He could not be more precise concerning the time. He believed

OSWALD gave him a small tip of one or two pesos. OSWALD carried his own luggage downstairs

and waited in front of the hotel with the luggage until RODRIGUEZ returned with the taxicab.!

RODRIBUEZ, commented that while he had little difficulty obtaining a taxi at the early hour,

it becomes very difficult to secure taxi transportation between 0730 and 0830 because of the

heavy traffic at that time. RODRIGUEZ related that OSWALD always arrived at the hotel late

at night, "midnight or thereafter", but he never noticed any indication that OSWALD had been

drinking.

/. Guillermo GARCIA Luna said of Pedro RODRIGUEZ Ledesma that RODRIGUEZ is

"humble but very serious, deeply religious, a family man, and highly reliable." / Dolores

RAMIREZ de BARREIRO, owner, manager and sometimes cook at small restaurant immediately

adjacent to Hotel del Comercio, stated that because of proximity of hotel, many hotel guests

eat meals at restaurant.

She remembered OSWALD who had eaten several meals at the restaurant

in the late afternoon over a period of one weak. OSWALD appeared at the restaurant after the

noon rush hour or some time after 1400, always alone, and ordered food by pointing at menu:

Ate soup of day, rice, and either meat or eggs, but rejected dessert and coffee, and was very

money (cost) conscious. Meals cost five to six

basis of a search of abandoned correspondence, review of his records and accounts, and refreshing

his memory through discussions with other personnel at hotel, he had been able to develop

the following data: Antonio OLIVA is a Negro who had been considered. Cuban but had clarified

to GARCIA Luna that he had

grown up on east coast of Mexico where "Cuban Spanish" is spoken.

He registered as "musician" but was known to have been employed as a cook or cook's helper

in an unidentified Mexi City

He had been living at the hotel with a woman to

whom he referred as his "wife" but CARCiA Luna deed that she might have been a monaramour.

They left the hotel without paying a substantial hotel bill, and GARCIA Luna has been attempt-

ing to locate them without success.

saying did not believe OSWALD involved and briefly explained his position by foll: "I met

OSWALD here. He stormed into my office and wanted me to introduce and recommend him to the Cubars.

He told me that he had lived in the USSR.

I told him that I would have to check before I could

recommend him.

He was nervous and his hands trembled, and he stormed out of my office. I don't

believe that a person as nervous as OSWALD, whose hands trembled, could have accurately fired

OSWALD spoke with YATSKOV basis 1 OCt 63 LIENVOY: When OSWALD spoke with OBYEDKOV, OSWALD

talked with a consul on Saturday, did not name KOSTIKOV. It was OBYEDKOV who asked

suggestively if it was K and OSWALD said yes, possibly without thought. Direct HQS attention

this transcript. Note however, KOSTIKOV has dark hair, YAISKOV light brown and very grey at

temples, giving appearance of almost white hair. Could also well be that OSWALD first spoke

with KOSTIKOV who turned OSWALD over to his boss YATSKOV. Also, given the apparent frankness

-of Y's discussions with LIOVAL-l, particularly his views Stalin and Khrushchev, would appear

possible he told I-1 truth re OSWALD, at minimum re meeting OSWALD.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD from Flannery (C/GA) Elena GARRO toid Eunice Oddo (who relayed to

TICHBORN on 9 Oct) that she and her duaghter were invited to a party at the Cuban Emb during

the period she now finds out that OSWALD was here in Mexi prior to the assassination.

was invited by a Mex1 secretary in the Cub Emb whose husband 18 a cousin of the GARRO

family. (Horacio DURAN????); At the party, she saw three Gringos, not drinking, not mixing,

and more or less just standing around together like "three bumps lon a log"

They were so

obviously out of place, she asked someone In the Cub. Emb about them and was told that "they

were just passing thn through". She claims that on account of the way these three gringos

stood out she took a good long look at them as did her daughter. When assassination occurred

and OSWALD's picture was spread into the newspapers, both Elena and her daughter immediately

said that he was one of the three gringos "without a doubt" at the party.

Note covering above memo to COS: Do you want me to send the gist of this to Hqs?

cos wrote:

but we

should follow up first. Flannery then wrote, Nothing further.

DIR 56876 (Ref: MEXI 1191 - para 397 above) Hqs has no evidence that Sovs have advance copy

of photo. Comm sources assure us its copy of photo furnished by the FBI has also been

altered to black out the background. At present the annex is scheduled for release around

mid Nov. / Considered opinion here 1s that Sov action per ref would seem to be a logical CI

the FBI reporting

an incident which might be connected with the assassination..

(attachment is para 409. below)

MEMO TO FBI from WOFACT - An untested source recently furnished us with the foll info he

allegedly received from a well, known Cuban scientist and acquaintance on 23 Nov 63, but which

he had forgotten to report.

The release of the Warren Comm Report reminded him of the inci-

dent. / The scientist said he had been at the Havana airport

on afternoon of 22 Nov 63 when

at 1700 hrs an aircraft with Mexi markings, landed and parked at far side of the field.

Two men, whom he recognized as Cuban & "gangsters"

alighted, entered rear entrance of

administration blag and disappeared without going through normal customs procedures. His

curiosity was aroused, and he was able to learn that the aircraft had just arrived from

Dallas, Texas, via Illuana and Mexi City. The plane had been forced to land at Tijuana due

to engine trouble? By combining the date, the origin of the flight, and the known reputation

of the two men, he theorized that the two men must have been involved in assassination.

He speculated that OSWALD had acted in the pay of Castro, and that the two Cubans had been

In Dallas to organize or oversee the operation. He told

the source that he had been greatly

distressed by what he had seen and heard and had to telll someone about it. He then

caut ioned

source not to tell anyone else about it or they would ham both be shot by the Cuban's. /

The source has passed away since furninhing above info, thus making any follow-up on this

matter impossible.

THE NEWS - Lawyers Plead RUBY's Guilt Based on Perjured Testimony -

Memo of Conversation - Subjects Further on OSWALD and K Assassination - (Ref: Memo

this Subj of 25 be6 65 - pera 427 above)

Participants - Elena and Thomas (Pol Officer) -

Elena described some developments which may have some bearing on her claim that she saw

OSWALD at a party at home of her cousin: Ruben DURAN when OSWALD was in Mexico prior to

assassination. / Elena said Carlos SOLORZANO 1s well acquainted with Cub Amb HERNANDEZ

Armas, and that he was not leftist but his brother, Alfonso, was a Communist.

Amb HERANDDEZ.

told SOLORAAND he wanted to meet Elens, so SOLORZAND arranged a party at his own home on

30 June 66 and invited both of them. Also present were Tito MONIEROSO and his wife;

Elvira VARGAS, leftist journalist with NOVEDADES and personal friend of Pres DIAZ Ordaz;

Emanuel CARBALLO, the pro-Castro writer; Joaquin DIAZ Canedo, head of publishing firm

called Editorial Mortiz; and Juan SORIANO, painter, who was invited to make her feel at

ease, since he is a friend of hers and was the only anti-Communist there besides herself.

/ During evening, Amb HERNANDEZ, whom she described as intelligent and cultured,

trated his attention on her..... and expressed interest in her friend, Carlos MADRAZO.!

He issued a personal invitation to her to attend the annual literary festival of the Casa

de ¡las Americas in Havana.

She said she was not a Fidelista and would not go unless

Juan SORIANO went with her. Amb FERNANDEZ then Invited SORIANO but the latter denounced

the Castro regime over the objections of the others present...../ Later, her friend;

Victor RICO Galan who personally dislikes Amb HERNANDEZ warned her not to go to Cuba alone.

/. On 4 July 66 a driver from the Cub Emb delivered to her home on Calle Alencastre In

Lomas Virreyes an envelope containing two letters and some printed matter from the Casa

de las Americas in Havana. The first letter, written last October (66?) gave her address

as Vermont 38 and the second letter, written in April, gave her address as Vermont 39:

The envelope for the-first letter with the above address, was marked for return to the

sender, which was the Cub Emb here.

The second envelope, which contained the whole pkg,

had no address as it was hand carried to her home - see attachments. / Elena stated the

only reason the letters were addressed to her at Calle. Vermont was because she spent several

days at the Hotel Vermont after the assassination.

The correct address of the hotel 1s

Vermont 29, so she concluded the Cub Gov carried that street and number, with a minor

error, as her regular address. / Since CALVILLO had taken her to the hotel ostensibly to

protect her from the Connunists, this raised the question of how the Cubans obtained that

CALVILLO and two close friends of his,

Ernesto de la Peña and Margarita MICHELENA.

Two

other friends of these three who might have learned of it are Eunice ODIO and June COBB.

She a has always been suspicious of all three because they went out of their way to

cultivate her when she returned from Europe In 63 and made such a point of being outspoken

professional anti-Communists.

Elenna said CALVILLO was & close personal friend of Noe

PALOMARES and Pres. DIAZ, Ordaz, and that guards, presumably from Gobernacion, had been

placed outside her home when she returned from the Hotel Vermonth....../ Elena thought it

possible that the Cub Emb had deliberately given her the letters from the Casa de las

Americas with the Vermont Street address in order to frighten her.

She was already con-

cerned about what appeared to be three gunshots that had been fired through her upstairs

window while she was out of the house three weeks ago.

.. Finally, Elena said she had

recently encountered her cousin, Lydia I DURAN and that the latter had been
