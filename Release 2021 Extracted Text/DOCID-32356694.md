We surmise that the reference in OSWALD'S letter of 9 November to a

days before the assassination. AZCUE had been in Mexico for eighteen

His replacement did arrive in September.

AZCUE was schedu-

Memorandum for Mr. J. Lee RANKIN, General Counsel etc.

Lee Harvey OSWALD.

[DDP 4- 3401]

"1..

The following remarks have been recently attributed to Soviet Consül

Pavel Antonovich YATSKOV in Mexico City regarding the subject.

'I met OSWALD here. He stormed into my office and

wanted me to introduce and recommend him to the Cubans.:

He told me that he had lived in the USSR. I told him that

I would have to check before I could recommend him. He

was nervous and his hands trembled, and he stormed out

of my office.

I don't believe that a person as nervous as

OSWALD,

whose hands trembled could have accurately

fired a rifle.'

Our Mexican Station has checked its records for the period OSWALD

had talked with Valeriy KOSTIKOV when he actually had spoken

to YATSROV; or that he first spoke to KOSTIKOV who turned him over to his

superior YATSKOV.

Investigation."

Statements Reportedly Made by George and Jeanne de MOHRENSCHILDT

Concerning Lee Harvey OSWALD and the Assassination of President Kennedy.

[DDP 4-34791

The information furnished below has been received from usually

The de MOHRENSCHILDTs were asked if there was

substance to the view expressed in certain foreigny

George de

MOHRENSCHILDT said that President Kennedy was hated

by the Dallas elite, and he felt that it was very

likely that certain reactionary elements in Dallas had!

organized a plot to get rid of Kennedy and used a dis-

Subject: Konstantin Petrovich SERGIEVSKY

General Counsel etc.

[DDP 4- 4479]

"1.

The files of this Agency contain no identifiable traces on Konstantin

Petrovich SERGIEVSKY or on his sister.

We have no information which would either confirm or refute allega-

tions that Lee Harvey OSWALD made one or more

visits to the city of Gorky

in April and May 1960 or at any other time.

The tern 'mokrym delam' which appears in the notes which SERGIEVSKY

brought with him to the British Embassy may be translated

'wet affairs' or

'liquid affairs'.

It is an expression or jargon used by the KGB to refer

to activities involving kidnapping or assassination. • ..

RANKIN asked for Agency comments concerning allegations of a Soviet
