Memorandum

TO

: Chief, SRS

Thru : DC/SRS and C/FIOB/SRS

FROM : M. D. Stevens

SUBJECT: CAIN, Richard S.

#272 141

DATE: 9 October 1957

1. Reference is made to the attached 5 June 1967

memo

randum on Subject, which in turn made reference to previous

I memoranda on him on 24 and 25 May 1967 and to an Office of Security

memorandum dated 29 May 1967.

The 5 June 1967 memorandur

enclosed copies of several 1963/1964 documents from the Chicago

Field Öffica's file on CAIN, which.

I forwarded to SRS with

the comment that "It appears

Tis cleaning out their files re Lee

Harvey OSWALD, et al."

Subject, it is obvious, had been a source of information

regarding an alleged discussion of the assassination of President

Kennedy at a secret meeting of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee

held in Chicago in February 1963 under the direction of Richard

GRILEY (*346 116). He also was the source of information regarding

the alleged attempted recruitment into the Communist Party of young

Cubans in the Chicago area by one Guillermo ESCOBAR, who accord-

ing to the Chicago office was "one of Horace SPEED's (SAS) leads

obtained from Ralph PEREZ." (Presumably Ralph PEREZ, 444260)

SPEED is Horace SPEED III, #199499.

The documents also indicated

that in February 1964 CAIN was the subject of a conversation initiated

by Eldon S. COHEN, #38557 o/c, with a representative of the

Chicago office who believed his purpose was to learn whether or not

CAIN was in fact on a two-month's sick leave from the COOK County

Sherit's office,.

cover assignment which COHEN inferred involved tapping the tele-

phones of gubernatorial candidate Charles H, PERCY and other

political figures.

3.. During review of GAIN's Security file, I noted a message

regarding him from Mexico City, on 25 April 1962, which mentioned

a "Willard ANDREWS, reputable American businessman in Mexico,"

who obviously had had contact of some kind with CAIN, as well as with

a CIA representative in Mexico to whom ANDREWS had commented that

CAIN claims to have been with OSS during W. W. Il (Acopy of this memo-

randum is attached). In answer to this message which reguested traces

on CAIN, Headguarters, in furnishing limited information obtained regard-

ing him, advised that neither his claimed employment by OSS, nor a claira

he made to have worked with Task Force W, could be substantiated. The

Station was advised that he did have (or. had had) a legitimate detective

laboratory in Chicago.

5. The firsttime CAIN came to the attention of the Security Office

svas when the Mexico Station requested traces on him. Their request

stemmed from an unannounced visit he made to the Station, during which

he stated that he had an investigative agency in Mesico with branches in

Chicago and Los Angeles.

He had also stated that his agency in Mexico

was for the purpose of training Mexican Government agenis in police

methods, in investigative techniques, and in the use of the lie detector;

and had added that he was investigating. Communism in a certain unnamed

Central American country.

6. In June 1962, the Mexico Station advised that CAIN was being

deported by the Mexican Ministry (of) Gobernacion for these violations:

a. Carrying a loaded revolver and brass knuckles

b. Impersonating a Mexican Governmeni official

(He had identification as an investigator for the

Mexican Treasury Office.)

c. Violating his tourist permit by working at his

detective office and at the Mexican Treasury

Subject was subsequently of interest to the

_in Sepiember

1963 when an ad hoc clearance was requested to permit his being asked

to respond to general requirements regarding his knowledge of certain

Cuban refugees and their potential for foreign positive intelligence. On

10 September 1963, the !

was sent a memorandumn which furnished

nuch of the above information on CAIN.

8.

On 22 May 1967, the Director of Security indicated that he

had received information from the FBI which ties Subject to the Mafia

in Chicago; and he directed that the

be contacted for information

las to whether or not they ever established contact with him and, if so,

for what purpose. The

Iwas also to be advised that, if they were

in contact with him, it was suggested that they break it off. On 25

May.1967, the advised that there had been no contact with CAIN

since 1963, and furnished copies of eight reports for which Subject had

been the source of information. These had to do with anti- Castro Cuban

activities, procurement of arms, etc.

9. On 29 May 1967, Security advised the

that there is a

current FBI investigative interest in Subject and recommended that

there be no further contact with hira at this time.

The 1 September 1967 copy of Life magazine contains an

article titled "Brazen Empire of Organized Crime," in yhich it is

stated that Sam GIANCANA, Head of the Chicago Coga Nostra, is "still

running things by remote control from a hide-out in Mexico.. where

he poses as Ricardo SCALZETII. The real SCALZEtTI, GIANCANA's

erst while chauffeur and courier, is more familiar to Chicagoans as

Richard CAIN, a well known former Chicago policeman and more recently

a private investigator."
