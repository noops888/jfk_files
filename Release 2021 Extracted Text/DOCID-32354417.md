Dear Bob:

Herewith our comments on the reprise (or redoublement d'attaque)

on the "implications" paper on anti-Castro plotting.

We won't

repeat comments on the unchanged errors in the earlier version

(some of which were errors, not contested presentation). Nor

will we address new substantive additions at this time.

are at the end (and from what we have been told, this is the last

end before final submission for the formal security review) our

future comments to you will be limited to security matters.

Table of Contents. C.1(f). Delete Varona's name. Substitute

"Cuban exile leader's".

Page 19. Second line. Delete ""Juan Orta"; substitute "Cuban

official".

Page 19. Paragraph 40. Fourth line Juan Orta's name.

Page 20. Paragraph 41. Lines 8 and 10. Juan Orta's name.

Page 32. Identifying information of item 28. Delete "Evetio Duque

Miyar".

(See item 16, page 31.)

Page 32. Identifying information of item 31. Delete identifying

information.

Page 57. Title in subsection (f); and second line, paragraph 110.

Describe Varona as "Cuban exile leader"

Page 65. Lines 4 and 5. Substitute "Cuban exile leader" for

"Varona" .

Page 72. Paragraph 139. Delete reference to position as "Secretary

in Castro's prime ministry". It is identifying information.

Page 92. Paragraph 187, lines 3, 5, and 6. Delete identifying

information on Cuban official.

Page 97. Handwritten note in left margin. Substitute "AMLASH'S"

for "Cubela's".

Footnotes

#10. O'Connell's name; substitute "Support Chief".

#131, 143, 145. O'Connell's name.

#162, 164. O'Connell's name.

#165. Substitute "Cuban exile leader" for "Antonio Varona".

#180, 183. "Exile leader" for "Varona".

#204. O'Connell's name.

In conclusion, we continue to find security problems in the

footnotes. As you mentioned to us on 20 March that those we had

not seen would not present a problem, I am concerned that your

people may have overlooked things that would strike us differently.

It would be unfortunate if some oversight in processing the

material resulted in unexpected difficulties at the last minute.

You should take steps to avoid such a possibility.

We stand

ready to review these.

Sincerely,

for Principal gordinator, HISCA
