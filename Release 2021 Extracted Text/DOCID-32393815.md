From a review of the Agency's file on Lee Harvey, OSWALD,

it becomes apparent that the Agency and its field stations, parti-

cularly in Mexico City and Miaimi, were not unmindful of the possi

bility that OSWALD did not act alone!

During the first few weeks

after the assassination, Headquarters, upon at least three occa-

Sions, exhorted the Mexico City Station to continue "all your

coverage of the Cuban and Soviet installations

On -28 Novem

ber 1963, the Chief, WH/3, told the Mexico City Station that there

should be no let down in your efforts to follow all/leads and in-

vestigate all facts which bear on this case. We have by no means

excluded the possibility that other as yet unknown persons may have

been involved or even that other powers may have playéd a role."

(Emphasis added:) (DIR 85655, 28 November 1963] On 30 November,

Headquarters asked the Mexico. City Station to follow all leads and

"The question of whether OSWALD acted solely on his own has

still not been finally resolved. (Emphasis added.) DIR 86064

30 November: 1963]

And on the 12th of December 1963, Chief, WH/3÷

again asked the Mexico City Station to continue to watch for

Soviet and Cuban reaction to investigation of assassination, evi-

dence of their complicity, signs they putting out propaganda about

caser"

(Emphasis added.) "FYI only, Soviet intelligence in India

had letters sent to

(us.) leaders demanding full investigation

of case.

FDIR 88680, 12 December 19631/

The Mexico City Station, however, had already initiated a

thorough review of its holdings in an attempt ascertain what infor-

mation was available on Lee Harvey OSWALD, his presence and his

activities in Mexico City. This review Erald p the feet that.

Silvia DURAN, a Mexican national employed by the Cuban Consulate,

had dealt with OSWALD during his known visits to the Consulate on

27 and 28 September. In response to a suggestion from the Station;

the Ministry of Gobernacion arrested Silvia DURAN and her husband,

Horacio, on 23 November 1963. (MEXI-7037 (IN

the Station that Silvia DURAN was completely cooperative and had

given a written statement attesting to two visits by OSWALD to the

Consulate IMEXI-7046 (IN 5, 23 November 1963) Although her

testimony was taken and presented, solely, by the Mexican Govern

ment authorities,

Silvia DURAN,was the only live witness on record

regarding OSWALD'S activities in Mexico City, It is from her state

ments that it was learned that OSWALD became engaged in a personal

altercation on 27 September 1963 with Eusebio AZCUE, the Cuban- Con-

sul and a member of the Cuban intelligence unit in Mexico City. He

she outival of his

MIRABEL Diaz

There is no evidence in the OswALD file that Silvia DURAN

was subjected to a systematic elicitative interrogation that would

have related her dealings with OSWALD, known or confirmed by inter

cept, with the data held on the Cuban DGI (Direccion General de In-

telligercia), its personalities and methods, in Mexico City. Was it

normal for a case like OSWALD's, considering the fuss he allegedly

made with AZCUE, for the applications to be handled solely by a 1o-

cal employee and a lame duck like AZCUE whose slot had been taken

by the doI chief? whatever the answer to these questions, they were

not asked at the time.

And there remains the more fundamental ques

tion accepting the DURAN story as it stands, could it have hap-

pended without the knowledge and participation of DGI personnel in

the Consulate? This seems unlikely especially because Manuel En=

genio VEGA Perez* later cited by a Cuban Del defector as having

stated hé was aware OSWALD had made several visits to the Cuban

Consulate. It is-clear CASTRO's overseas intelligence and security

service could have more in its files than was surfaced in the

DURAN statements:

[CI Staff Review, dated 23 May 1975, pp. 16-19:1

-Manuel Engenio VEGA Perez,

alias Marcos, -and his DGI assistant,

Rogelis RODRIGUEZ Lopez, were positively identified in February 1964

assassinating General Annstasio SOMOZA.

As of September 1964, Silvia DURAN gave up her Cuban

Embassy job.

In the spring of 1967, Silvia DURAN_ was reported by

a reliable and sensitive source to have cut alf relations with

Cubans. Hor account, in 1967, of how she had been taken into

custody and had been interrogated after the

assassination re-

peated what was already known. She added, under circumstances

that did not permit, the source to challenge or elicit corrodorative

detail, that she had gone out with OSWALD during his stay in Mexico

City and claimed she had sexual relations with him, lIbid, pp.

Almost immediately after the President's assassination,

Agency field stations began receiving information from various

sources of undetermined reliability relating to the alleged assas

ssin of President Kennedy:

As the Warren Commission reported on pages 305 and 307

of its report, Literally dozens of allegations of a conspiratorial

contact between OSWALD and agents of the Cuban Government have been

investigated

The authors of the Report go on to state

that

"Among the claims made were allegations that l

OSWALD had made a previous trip

to Mexico

City in early September to receive money

and orders for the assassination l567], that

he had flown

and that OSWALD assassinated the, President at

the direction of a particular Cuban who met

with him in the United States and paid him

$7,000 15701. A letter received from some

one in Cuba alleging the writer had attended

a meeting where the assassination had been

discussed as part of a plan which would soon

include the death of other non-communist

leaders in the Americas-[5711

The charge

was made in a Cuban expatriate

publication

that in a speech he delivered 5 days after

the assassination, while he was under the

influence of liquor, Fidel Castro made a

slip of the tongue and said, "The first

time OSWALD was in Cuba"'

; thereby giving

away the fact that OSWALD had made one or

more surreptitious trips to that country

"Some stories linked the assassination

The Warren Report makes reference (bracketed numbers in

the above text) to Commission Exhibits (see Attachment I for list

Of Commission Exhibits) most of which had been furnished by the

Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Only the first reference = the

ALVARADO interrogation was furnished by the Agency. The Agency

did, however, provide assistance and information to the FBI in the

latter's investigation of three of the allegations (see asterisked

Exhibits) :

The results ot the Agency's investigation of other

rumors and allegations relating to OSWALD and the possible involve-

ment of the Cubans and Soviets in the assassination, were dissemina

ted to the FBI, primarily, and to the Warren Commission (see attach=

Among these cases, which consumed hundreds of man-hours

in Headquarters and abroad and similarly the FBI in the United

States and Mexico City was the Nicaraguan, Gilberto ALVARADO,

who contacted the United States Embassy in Mexico City on 25 Novem-

ber 1963.

The ALVARADO case is taken up in detail by the Warren

Commission, in its report, under- the cryptograph "D as being

illustrative of the attention given to the most serious allegà

tions

On 25 November 1963, a young Nicaraguan, Gilberto Nolasco

telephoned the United States Embassy in Mexico City. Later that

day he met with the Embassy security officer and a Station officer.

at which time he claimed he had been in the Cuban Consulate in

Mexico City on 18 September 1963. While in the Consulate he saw a

man whom he later recognized as Lee Harvey OSWALD receive, $6,500

In cash to kill an important person in the United States.

AL. VARADO described the circumstances as follows: While

standing by a bathroom door about noon he saw a group of three

persons conversing on a patio a few feet away. One was a tall,

thin Negro with reddish hair, obviously dyed, who spoke rapidly in

-both Spanish and English. He had prominent cheek bones and a

noticeable scar on the lower right side of his chin. The second

was a white person whom ALVARADO had seen previously in a waiting

room carrying a Canadian passport.

The white person had green

eyes, blondish hair, with a pompadour hairdo, and dark eyeglasses

The third person allegedly was Lee Harvey OSWALD. ALVARADO was

convinced of this from published photographs of OSWALD following

the assassination. OSWALD was wearing a black sport coat, but-

toned-up white shirt with short collar

tabs, no tie, dark gray

pants, and clear eyeglasses. He had a green passport in his pocket

wore, a wrist watch with a yellow band, and appeared to have a pis-

to1 in a shoulder hoister. A tall Cuban joined the group momen-

tarily and passed American currency to the Negro. The Ngro then

allegedly said to OSWALD in English, "I want to kill the man.

OSWALD replied, You're not man enough, I can do-it."- The Negro

then said in Spanish, "I can't go with you. I have a lot to do:"

OSWALD replied, "The people are waiting for me back there. The

Negro then gave OSWALD $6,500 in large denomination U.S. bills,

saying, "This isn't much.&

After hearing this conversation, ALVA-

rado said that he telephoned the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City:

several times-on 20 September before the assassination innan at-

tempt to report his belief that someone important in the United

States was to be killed, but was finally told by someone at the

Embassy to stop wasting his time.

ALVARADO was known to this Agency as a former informant

of Nicaraguan security service. His reliability was considered

questionable by American authorities although he had not been

wholly discredited. ALVARADO claimed he was in Mexico City working

against the Cuban communists for his service. The service, how-

ever, has denied that he was acting on its behalf. While investiga

tion in the United States showed that OSWALD could not possibly hav

have been' in Mexico City on 18 September Che was knwon to have been

in New Orleans on both 17 and 19 September), intensive interroga*

tion failed. to shake ALVARADO's story

On 28 November 1963, the Mexican police, interviewed him.

At first ALVARADO persisted in his story but on 30. November he ad-

mitted in a signed statement that his whole account about OSWALD

was false. H

He admitted he had not seen Lee OSWALD at all and that

he had not seen anybody paid money in the Cuban Embassy. He also

admitted he had not tried repeatedly to phone a warning to the U.s.

Embassy in Mexico City on 20 September as he had previously claimed

Instead he had first contacted the U. S. Embassy after the assassi-

nation. ALVARADO said that his motive in telling this false story

was to help get himself admitted into the United States so that he

could participate in action against Fidel CASTRO. He said that he

hated CASTRO and thought that his story about OSWALD, if believed,

would help cause the United States to take action against CASTRO.

Following the above interrogation, ALVARADO retracted, the

confession he had made to the Mexican authorities asserting that it

had been extorted from him under pressure. He was then questioned

by u,s, authorities using a polygraph machine.

ALVARADO volunta

rily consented to the use of this equipment. During the quesioning

it was pointed out to him that he was not being truthful, according

to the polygraph, in identifying photographs of OSWAlD as the per

son he saw in the Cuban Consulate.

He replied that he had full

faith in the polygraph, that he would not attempt to refute the re-

sults, and that he "must have been mistaken". In addition, he

he changed his story regarding the day he visited the Cuban Consu-

late, finally deciding it took place on Tuesday, 17 September.

was concluded from the results of the polygraph test that ALVARADO

had fabricated his story from whole cloth

(Memorandu to J. Lee RANKIN, General Counsel, dated 4 June 1964,

from Richard HELMS, Deputy, Director for Plans.1

(Comment

Some Idea of the time and effort expended by the Agency

in breaking ALVARADO'S story may be gained from a review of the

Chronological-Summary of the Gilberto ALVARADO interrogation under

attachment IV.)

Although the Warren Report had used the ALVARADO case to

demonstrate the type of allegation the Agency had had to contend

with, the Schweiker Report took the Agency to task for not having

become more suspicious of possible Cuban involvement in the assassi

nation:

To some extent? the authors of the Schweiker Report are

right. There were other rumors and allegations indicating that

OSWALD may not have acted entirely on his own, however, none of

there rumors and allegations stood up under intensive investigation

Moreover, each rumor or allegation was treated as a separate and

unrelated case - the only common denominator being OSWALD. There

appears to have been no suspicion on the part of the Agency that

these rumors and allegations might have been part of a larger decep-

tion plan orchestrated by a foreign counterintelligence service

only a thorough investigation of all available information including

overt comments by responsible communist officials could have allayed

these suspicions or generated additional requirements to be levied

on Agency assets world wide. Obviously such an investigation would

have required an enormous quantity of patience, time, and personnel:

None of these prerequisites was available, especially in light of

the tremendous political pressures under which the Agency, the FBI,

the Warren Commission, and others were working precluded the initia

tion of such an investigation.

It was not until eleven years later that the Agency was

asked to prepare a review of allegations of Cuban involvement in

the John F. Kennedy assassination. On 15 April 1975, David W.

that the results of its review add nuance, not evidence, to what

the Warren Commission and its staff had laid before them in 1964

in this subject"

AS to CASTRO/s remarks during an informal interview by

the Associated Press correspondent, Daniel HARKER, the Agency com-

mented that "There can be no question from the facts surrounding the

CASTRO appearance, which had not been expected, and his agreement

to the interview, that this event represented a more-than-ordinary

attempt to get a message on the record in the United States "'(Em-

phasis added.) The Agency commented further that "There is no evi

dence in the files on the KENNEDY assassination that this CASTRO

interview was considered in following up leads or in dealings with

the Warren Commission and its staff although Mexico Station

speci

fically directed Headquarters attention to the AP story very shortly

after the Dallas killing. More important, the interview appears to

have been forgotten in the contemporary political consideration of

relations with CASTRO's Cuba. There is no evidence in Agency re-

cords, either,

that the Warren Commission staff itself pursued the

implication of the CASTRO interview in dealing with the conspiracy

hypothesis There is no evidence in the files that anything along

these lines vas stated by any other Cuban leader before the assassi-

nation."'

the purpose

According to the author of the review,was to reconsider

Lee Harvey OSWALD's activity on the assumption that as an avid news

paper reader - which is known from testimony of Marina OSWALD and

others he read the CASTRO warning and threat which appeared New

Orleans principal morning paper, the Times-Picayune, on Monday,

9 September 1963.

The results of the review, admittedly he

fusing 20-20 hindsight, may be set out in summary:

There'is no increment of credible

evidence, applying this phrase strictly,

of Soviet and/or Cuban political, intelli-

gence or security service involvement in

the assassination to what was developed a

considered by the Warren. Commission

it's staff.

The Commission's finding that

Lee Harvey OSWALD was the killer of Presi-

dent KENNEDY and Officer TIPPITT and did

them in alone and-of his own determination

"b.

"Credible

evidence' that would

upset or significantly modify this judge

ment did (and does) not exist in Washing

ton.

But such evidence could exist in

Moscow and/or Havana, whose

voluntary in-

puts to the Warren Commission were minimal

in quantity and quality,

designed to cover

up any admissions of knowledge of, or con-

nection with, OSWALD which might be related

directly or indirectly with the assassina-

tion.:

Therefore, the belief that there

was Soviet and/or Cuban (KGB and/or DGI)

connection with OSWALD will persist and-

grow until there has been a full disclosure

by these governments

of all elements of

OSWALD's handling and stay and in the Soviet

Union and his contacts in Mexico City., The

Warren Commission report

should have left a

wider window!

for this contingency. That,

indeed, was the opinion at the working level;

particularly in the. counterintelligence com

ponent in the CIA in 1964.

As was indicated

by Mr. HELMS in his testimony before the

Warren Commission, CIA would continue to

regard this

aspect of the OSWALD Case as

still open.

states that:

During his speech of November 27,

"It will be recalled in this respect that

PORTELL-VILA advised during his February 17,

1964 interview that he read in a November 29;

1963, publication that in a speech on November

27, 1963; Fidel, CASTRO, whether through a slir

of the tongue or as the result of influence of

liquor, made, a coment which suggested that

He conjectured that this trip

of OSWALD could have taken place while he was

in Mexico last year perhaps while he was in

Russia.

He said at the time he had

no additional

ALVARADO Ugarte, Gilberto Nol'asco

In the following are cited those portions (including

footnotes) of the SCHWEIKER Report pertaining to Gilberto ALVARADO.

Comments relating to these portions are in roman charachters.

At noon on November 25,

'"D", a Latin American, appeared

at the American Embassy in Mexico City. 35. (EN: Ihis incident is

discussed in the Warren Report, pp: 308, 309; Cable from Mexico"

Station to CIA Headquarters, 11/85/63. [Comment:

The first cable

In the file announcing ALVARADO's Claim is MEXI-7067 (IN 68291),

26 November 1963. ALVARADO at no time appeared at the American:

Embassy some of our own reporting is in error, e.g.,. DIR 85089,

26 November 1963, a dissemination to FBI, State, and the White

House, states! "On 26 November 1963, Gilberto ALVARADO, a pro-

-fessed Castroite Nicaraguan :.: came to the Americần Embassy in

Mexico' and made a statement about Lee OSWALD." According to ALVA-

RADO's interrogation by Mexican authorities, he called the Ameri

can Embassy on 25 November and "succeeded in speaking to a high

official with whom he made an appointment for that-same day at

5:30 p.m. near the Hotel Maria Isabel. -Two individuals appeared

for the appointment." According to a

note in. the Mexico Station

file, signed by the Embassy Security Officer, A. C. PLAMBECK--

dated 25 November - these two men were SNIGHT and PLAMBECK; both.

were Embassy security officers. He told Embassy personnel that he

was in the cuban consulate on september 1l and saw cubans who dis

cussed assassination pay OsWAlD a sum of money. [Comment: During

his first meeting with Embassy officials, ALVARADO claimed he had

been at. the Cuban Consulate on the 18th of September, not the 17th.

In fact, at no time,

did he refer to the date 17 September.

Later,

during his interrogation in connection with the,polygraph examina-

tion on 6 December 1963, ALVARADO revealed he was "unsure of the

day of week allegedly saw OSWALD.. Thinks that it was on Tuesday!'

which would have been 17 September:: (MEXI-7289 (IN 75588), 7 Decem

ber 1963).1 He later repeated his story to the CIA Mexico Station

chief. [Comment: At no time, at least there is no mention in the

tiles, did ALVARADO repeat his story to the "CIA Mexico Station

Chief' ALVARADO first told-his-story, as indicated above, to two

officers from the Embassy Security Office. The next morning, he

met with PLAMBECK from the Embassy Security Office, and a Station

Officer. During another meeting that evening (26 November), ALVA-

RADO was interrogated by two officers from the Station. - (Note for

cluded that the story was a fabrication,

Orleans on 17 and I9 September 1963÷1

to some extent authenticity of the Nicaraguan's statement. Thus,

there appears to be a strong possibility that a down payment was

made: to OSWALD in the Guban Embassy there, presumably with promise

of-a subsequent payment after assassination." The Ambassador was

reading somewhat more into the situation than was: the case... The

reference, to DORTICOS = the Cuban President - relates to two tele-

phone conversation between DORTICOS and HERNANDEZ, the Cuban Amba-

ssador to Mexico, on 26 November 1963. The first conversation,

which took place at

tion DORTICOS asks (if) "the Federals of that country wanted Senora

DURAN to say something, that they had some interest in, and had

offered some money to the American?" To which HERNANDEZ answers

that there was nothing about money. In the second conversation,

DORTICOS is quoted as saying:

"I was referring as to whether they

had threatened her so that she would make a statement that the Con:

sulate had given money to the man - that American." HERNANDEZ ars-

wered that

"nothing absolutely was given her" [sic]. "It would not

This report has never been satisfactorily explained, although it

was made available to the warren Commission "Staff'" In any event,

these reports certäinty must have fueled suspicions of cuban in

volvement in the assassination. Based on the evidence it reviewed,

the warren Commission later determined that "D''s story was a fabri

cation. [Comment: This statement appears to be gratitous - the

The American Ambassador in Mexico later sent a cable

[MEXI-7072 (IN- 68406), 26 November 1963] to State Department through

On 2 December, Captain WHEELOCK saw ALVARADO during thé

afternoon for the first time.. In a brief interview, which lasted

only seven minutes, in the company of two Mexican officials;

ALVARADO reverted to his previous story. He claimed he did see:

OSWALD and that he did call the Embassy to report. (Latter state-

ment not supported by Embassy investigation.) ALVARADO went on to

say that he told the Mexicans he was fabricating because he was

"mentally mistreated", specifically because he was threatened that

he would be hanged by the testicles.

Actually he was not physically

mistreated. WHEELOCK said he was unable to come to any definite

conciusion as to ALVARADO's véracity, however, he would be able to

ido so once he returned to Managua and had a chance to complete the

interrogation. (MEXI-7023 IN 71702, 2. December 1963)

ECHEVARRIA, the acting minister of gobernacion, agreed

to permit CIA to "borrow" ALVARADO. - The plan was to pick up

ALVARADO-on 5 December and return him that evening. (MEXI-7229

IN-72877, -3 December 1963) ALVARADO was picked up as planned and-

underwent preliminary questioning on 5 December. The next day-he

underwent a polygraph interview. - The results of this lintervien

indicated. that ALVARADO was fabricating his-story. Interrogation

revealed that he was unsure as to the exact. day of the week he alle

gedly saw OSWALD. He thought it was on a Tuesday which would have

been the 17th of September. When ALVARADO was shown a series of

photographs during the testing, deception patterns became evident.

When he was confronted with this he answered that he had the utmost

confidence in the polygraph and that it must be correct.

The in-

terrogation

was concluded with ALVARADO admitting he must have made

an "honest mistake" in relating the original story in his identifi-

cation of OSWALD.

(MEXI-7289 IN 75588, December)

Following the receipt of the results of the anove inter-

CHRONOLOGICAL SUMMARY: Gilberto Nolasco ALVARADO. Ugarte:

18 September 1963

According to ALVARADO!s statements made during an inter-

view conducted in the morning of 26 November 1963-by an American

Embassy security officer and a member of the Mexico Station in

Mexico City, ALVARADO went at noon on 18 September to the Cuban

Consulate to turn over passport photographs to the Cuban Consul

Eusébio AZCUE." =

While standing by a rest room off a passage-

way leading to a patio, ALVARADO saw a group of three persons con-

versing on the patio a few feet away. One man was a tall, thin

Negro with reddish hair, obviously dyed. He had prominent cheek

bones, and a noticeable scar on the lower right side of his chin.

He spoke radpidly with a Cuban accent and did speak some English.

Another member of the group was a white

person whom ALVARADO Fad

seen previously, in the waiting room, carrying á Canadian passport.

The Canadian had green eyes, blondish hair combed in an existen-

tialist" manner with a pompadour He was wearing dark eyeglasses

of a type with a mirror-like reflection on the outer surface.

The

third member of the group was lee Harvey OSWALD.

He was waering a

black sport coat, a buttoned up white shirt with short collar tabs,

no tie, gray pants, and clear eyeglasses:

ALVARADO saw a tall Cuban join the group momentarily and

pass American currency to the Negro. This unidentified Cuban ap-

parently came out of Acue's office onto the patio. ALVARADO des-

cribed the Cuban as a tall, solidly built mulatto, with curly hair,

who appeared to be about 37 years old. He was wearing a brown suit

and a red-striped tie. ALVARADO never saw this man again after 18

September:

ALVARADO claimed he overheard the following conversation

between the Negro and OSWALD:

Negro (in English)

"I want to kill the man"

OSWALD

'Youre not man enöugh.. I can do

it. "

* NW 65990 Docld:32393815 Page 53

Negro (in Spanish):

"I can't go with you.

I have a lot

to đọ. "

OSWALD

The people are waiting for me back

there.

The Negro gave OSWALD six thousand five hundred dollars

in large denomination US bills saying:

-This isn't much." Of the

sum, one thousand five hundred dollars was for extra expenses.

The

Negro also gave him about 200 Mexican pesos.

Later, ALVARADO saw a pretty girl,whom he believed to be

a Cuban employee of the Consulate, give OSWALD an abrazo embrace

and tell him she was living at Calle Juarez number 407-where he;

could find her. The girl appeared to about 20 years old and had

manners which reminded ALVARADO of a prostitute. OSWALD, the Negro

and the Canadian then went upstairs.

ALVARADO left the building momentarily to buy popsicle

on the corner; he saw the above three

he men leave by the Embassy gate

near the corner of Tacubaya where they entered

a parked black car,

possibly a Chvrolet.

At the end of September, ALVARADO telephoned the American

Embassy several times to report his belief that someone important

in the United States was to be killed.

When ALVARADO saw OSWALD's photograph in the newspaper,

he again contacted the Embassy on 25 November:

IMEXI- 7069 (IN 68376), 26 November 1963]

2.5 November 1963

ALVARADO called the United States Embassy.

That same

evening he met with the Embassy security officer.

IMEXL 7168 (IN 70860), 30 November 1963]

"Commént:

According to the Mexican police report of the interroga-

tion of ALVARADO, the latter called the American Embassy and

"succeeded in speaking to a high official with whom he made an ap-

pointment for that same day at 5:30 p.m. near the Hotel Maria

Isabel.]

## Page 55

Two individuals appeared for the 5:30 p.m. appointment.

They identified themselves and were carrying the credentials of

FBI agents.* ALVARADO told about his seeing OSWALD, etc. Another

appointment was made for 9:15 the next morning at the Jena Restau-

rant.

[HMMA -22561, 5 December 1963; CSCI -3/779,136, 13 December 1963]

*Comment: The tio individuals were SNIGHT, the Embassy, security

officer,- and A. C. PLAMBECK (P), Mexican Station officer.

ALVARADO

may have mistaken Embassy identification documents for FBI creden-

25 November 1963

ALVARADO Claimed inter alla that two persons were in the

Cuban Embassy the morning of 25 November 1963 at 1100 who are in-

volved in the plot to assassinate President Kennedy.

He described

them as one being a white person with a large cleft nose. The

other had closed cropped hair with a copote (sicl.*

ALVARADO claims that on the Isth of September, he was in

the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City and he saw Lee Harvey OSWALD re-

ceive $6,500. OSWALD was speaking with a Begro, about 29 years of

age, who had a scar on his jaw, and had reddish hair which is pro-

bably. tinted. The Negro spoke English well and might be a North

American. OSWALD was speaking of eliminating someone.

The Negro

then said he was sorry that he could accompany OSWALD, saying:

"You understand my situation."

To which OSWALD replied:

"That's

all right, I can do this mysélf."

The "source' (ALVARADO?) was of the opinion that OSWALD

had come from Havana. When OSWALD entered (the Consulate ?) he

was affectionately greeted by a female employee of the Cuban Em-

bassy, who has blue eyés and lives at Calle Juarez 407.

The "source" also stated that OSWALD was given $1,500

for extra expenses.

Source stated that when he went to the bath

room he saw OSWALD counting the money, in American dollars, on the

patio which is adjacent.

Captain WHEELOCK saw ALVARADO during afternoon for first

time. Meeting lasted only seven minutes. In brief interview in

company of two Mexican officials, ALVARADO reverted to his pre-

vious story. He claimed he did see OSWALD, did call the U. s.

Embassy to report. (Embassy investigation does not support latter

statement:. He went to say that he told the Mexicans he was fabri

cating because he was mentally mistreated", 1.e.,,

threatened with

physical harm, although he was not actually physically mistreated.

WHEELOCK said he unable to come to any definite conclusion as to

ALVARADO's veracity; however, -he would be able to

do so once he re-

turned to Managua and had chance to complete the interrogation.

ALVARADO was to be deported to Nicaragua on 4 December.)

ALVARADO submitted to examination by polygraph. The

results of this examination indicated that he was fabricating his

story. Interrogation revealed that ALVARADO was unsure, as to the

day of the week he allegedly saw OSWALD:

He thinks it was on Tues-

day which would have been 17 September.

When ALVARADO was shown

a series of photographs during the testing, deception patterns

became evident. When he was, contrinted with this he answered that

he had the utmost confidence in the polygraph and that it must be

correct.

The interrogation was concluded with ALVARADO admitting

he must have made "honest mistake" in-relating original story in

his identification of OSWALD
