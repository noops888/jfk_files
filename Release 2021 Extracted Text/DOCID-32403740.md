if ;you'd be so good as to appear personally before the Commission

and testify very briefly.

Yes, I'll do that.

Now, all they want to deal with is the question of your knowledge

about Oswald being an agent or informer or anything of that

character. They also would like to deal with your knowledge of

any conspiracy, either domestic or foreign and that kind of thing.

We are going to have Edgar Hoover on Thursday at nine to deal

pretty. much with the same thing. I think we might also ask,

Mr. McCone, a little bit about the question of security precautions

for the President that you might suggest in a very general way,

things that might have occurred to you. I;m sure you know the

President is very sensitive about that area for himself. That is,

he thinks that sometimes it's just an irterference with things he'd

like to do.

Well, all Presidents think that. President Eisenhower used to

complain about that all the time and so did Kennedy.

And since this testimony is all going to be made public, I thought

you might want to keep that in mind. You will have some thoughts

about possibly in the domestic area or in the foreign are a or both,

in that regard, that they would like to have from you.

Alright, I'd be glad to come up.

Would 10:30 or 11:00 on Thursday be at all convenient.

Sure, that's be fine.

Which would you prefer?

Well, I'd prefer 10:30, I have a 12:30 luncheon. You have Mr.

Hoover at 9:00/

I think that we should be well out of the way by then.

Well, suppose I come up at 10:30 and if you run over, well, I can

just wait.

I'll find it.

If you have any questions about anything that occurred to you

beforehand and you want to ask me, don't hesitate to call me.

Should I come alone or do you want me to bring somebody with

me?

Whatever your pleasure.

I see.

It makes no difference as far as the Commission...

I'll tell you what I'll do. I will bring with me the man that's

been principally involved in answering any questions that you've

had.

I know you've had some.

And if something occurs to you why we'll just let ;you go off the

record and ask him if there's something that ;you don't feel that

you could answer yourself and you want to get a little refreshing

from him.

Alright, fine. I'll be there. Tell me, how are you getting along

with this Buchannan matter?

Well, we've been debating that over here and we're quite unhappy

with that fellow. I got a note today saying that in the preface to

his London edition he says that he talked i this over with someone

in the Co mmission and that the entire text of his report ix has

been filed in Washington with the Commission. He's apparently

trying to give some respectability to it in that way. Some of the

* Commission think that we should call him, some think that it

would just advertise him if we do.

DCI:

I realize that, and you're alivays up against that problem of

dignifying a book or report; however, I was rather distrubed at

a discussion 1 had a week ago with Mrs. Fluer Cowles Meyer

lives in London, and; you knew her as Fluer Cowles when she

was married to Mike Cowles and she told me of the extent to

which Buchannan had captured the radio and television audiences

in Great Briton and on the continent and went so far as to say that

unless the Commission's report dealt with his allegations and

charges with a good deal of finality, there would be quite a feeling

that the report itself was a whitewash and that the real facts had

not been developed.

Well, we had in mind to take every point that he raised, and Mark

Lane and every other person that's commented that way in a separate

section and just proceed to knock everyone of them clear out.

That might do it. I spoke to the Chief Justice about it. The fact

is I think he talked to Fluer about it.

He's one of the strongest against calling him. Did he indicate

that to you?

Yes, he indicated that to me, and for the reason that he was itx

afraid that it would just advertise him. I know that, because I

get up against that with every book or article that's written criticizing

the Central Intelligence Agency. I have a certain number of people

who want you to get right on the stump and deny it and when you

analyze it, all you've done is advertise what has been said.

Right.

But nevertheless, I think your position is considerably different

than the one I mentioned.

You think about it, whether you think that if we dress ourselves

directly to it in a

separate section of the report with all of these

claims made by people like that, whether you think that might

be better than to try to call him here and just have him put on

a show. I think they might like an off the record comment from

you if you'd care to make one.

I'll give some thought about it between now and Thursday. Alright

fine.

Thank you.

DCI:

I am calling you because last night we had a guest for dinner,

a mutual friend yours and mine, by the name of Fleur Cowles

Montague- Meyers.

Whom I know very well.

Now, she engaged me in a conversation at dinner concerning

this Buchanan report and she was very disturbed about it because

of the very great impact that she feels it is having in England

and throughout Europe. Buchanan has been on TV and on radio,

both in Britain and on the continent.

And he has got a book coming out on the 8th.

And he has got a book coming out and she feels that essential

in your report that you dispose of his allegations or indiate

the errors on which he draws his conclusions.

She feels so

strongly that she told me that if this were not done, there would

be a very strong feeling among groups in Europe that this whole

investigation was a whitewash and that we didn't get to the bottom

of the thing. Now, strangely enough, there was an article that

appeared in the Washington Post on Saturday, which you undoubtedly

read.

Is that the one by John Henshaw?

No, the one by Chalmers Roberts.

I didn't see the Roberts one, but I have one by Henshaw - I'm

just reading it right now. I have it before me. Ithought that was

probably what you were calling me about. It is from the Inquirer.

Yes, I have seen that, but that is a kind of sensational thing.

Chalmers Roberts, ask your girl to get....

Let's see, that wasn't in the News. That was in the Post.

Yes, it was in the Post.

Yes, I read Roberts. Saturday morning, I read that, saying that

he thought we ought to go into all of these things.

DCI:

Now,

Fleur is in town today. She is leaving this evening. She

would like very much and it might be woith your time if she could

drop in and just give you, herself, what she told me last night.

I don't know whether you would want to do that.

Well, I know Fleur! Would like to talk to her. I usually see

her when she is here. I am a little surprise that she would

doubt that we wouldn't do such a thing.

Well, you know, sometimes these girls get quite steamed up

about things.

We have taken closer to 400 than 300 witnesses' testimony

and we have taken it deliberately so that nobody can say that

we have just been rubber stamped for the Secret Service or

the FBI or anybody else.

Well, I told her in great detail at dinner because you had told

me only a few days ago, the depth and the penetration of your

inquiry.

We haven't yet finished and I would think, John, between you

and me, that we ought to take this book of Buchanan when it

comes out and scrutinize it carefully to see that there is nothing

that we have overlooked.

Because if he has any allegations in

there concerning witnesses who have information we ought to

hear them and we will do that. I don't - I hesitate calling him

to testify because that might be just what he is looking for to

get the sounding board for another book and I don't want to do

that.

Well, you have to be careful about that until you at least see

the book. Now, I thought this Chalmers article was very strange

coming (1) by Chalmers Roberts and (2) in the Washington Post.

It sounded so to me.

However, it is interesting that Buchanan worked for the Washington

Post in 1949.

Wasn't it the Star?

No, I am told he worked for the Post. Now, I may be wrong on that.

Well, I just saw in one of the papers the other day he was originally

a Star reporter here. He could have been eithei.

Could have been either and sometimes those fellows shift from one i

newspaper to the other.

This is utt not the kind of thing Chalmers usually indulges in.

No, it was entirely foreign to his - to areas that are normal

to him.

The thing that I didn't like about it, he rather intimated that

this came from some source within the Commission.

I didn't read that into it. But you would be more alert to that

than I. Well, in any event what shall I do?

Well, I'll be glad to see

Fleuz and talk to her.

I'll have her call you up.

Yes, ybu may tell her. as far as this is concerned, we have no

intention of letting go uninvestigated any phase of it any of these

people have brought up.

Well, it is always pbeasant to see her anyway, you know.

It is always pleasant to see her and I'll be glad to see her.

She is going to call me in a little while and I'll tell her to give

you a ring.

Fine. Say, John, in this one about - of Henshaw's. Let me see

if I can find it quickly here - he alleges that the Central Intelligence

Agency was using Ruby to recruit commandos for raids against

Castro's Cuba.. To prevent this explosive information from being

disclosed, the CIA asked the Justice Dept. to step in and stop the

Dallas police from arresting Ruby as well as Oswald. This was

supposed to be last. April and then it says, a top secret document

a letter signed by a high official of the Justice Dept. was sent in.

April 1963 from the Justice Dept. to the Dallas Chief of Police,

Jesse E. Curry requesting the Dallas police not to arrest Oswald

and Ruby in connection with the attempted slaying of Gen. Walker.

There is no truthin that. Let me get you all the dope on that.

Oh, I'm just positive there is no trugh in it. The only thing is I'm

trying to find

a way where we can counteract any such thing

because that paraded over Europe and around the world is a terrible

thing. Do you know anything about this so-called Inquirer?

No.

It is apparently an insert in some paper he bought on the stands

I don't know from where it came. In fact I didn't see that article

until tast night when Fleur was leaving, I sent out to try to find

the Chalmers article and they came back with this Inquirer article.

But that is the first time I had seen it. I guess it came out in

one of the Sunday papers.

Yes.

We get the Star, Times, Herald-Tribune and the Post, so it was

one of those four.

I am sure that the Roberts one was in the Post.

DCI:

H:

I just want to be sure that you are satisfied that this Agency

is giving you all the help that we possibly can in connection

with your investigation of the situation in Dallas. I know

the importance the President places on this investigation

you are making. He asked me personally whether CIA was

giving you full support. I said that they were, but I just

wanted to be sure from you that you felt so.

We have had the very best support that we could possibly

expect from you.

Good. Well you can call on us for anything we have.

We will feel free to do that

I think it is an exceedingly important investigation and report

and I am delighted that the President has called on you to

make it.

We are trying to do it as fast as we can so we can dispel various

wild rumors that have been circulating as to whether this man

was the right man etc. that fired the gun. But there is no question

that he is the right man. There are a lot of aspects that we have

dug up, for instance, with regards to the matter in Mexico City.

We have now found that the photograph that was taken was not

that of Oswald. We do find from our informant down there that

Oswald did call at the Embassy that day and the informant has

given us the conversation that he had. He wanted to get a permit

to go back to Russia and the Cuban Embassy couldn't give him

the permit. The Soviet Embassy stated that it wald take three

weeks. He had, I think, a visitor's permit for about a week or

ten days so that is why he came back to the United States.

Well, all of that ties in importantly into the story and we have

those operational sources down there. We want to handle ther

very carefully. It involves some very high level people down

there. Sam Papich and I have talked about that a couple of times.

Mr. Katzenbach

Twho is handling it for the Department -

it is our intention when the Bureau finishes the report, he will

of course go over it very carefully because it will be a report

that will be released to the public, probably through the White

NW 65990 Docld:32403740 Page 10

## Page 11

House, but it is the intention after it is in final form to be

checked with each of the Government agencies that are mentioned

in it.

State Department is involved in regard to the issuing of

the passport to the man to come back to this country and that

has got to be explained why it was done, the law requires it, etc.

all of which of course we are gathering. The aspects of the

Mexico City thing. It will have to be mentioned.

It is his

intention to check with the agencies, Secret Service, etc. to be

sure that whatever is said in the report is conferred in and it

is agreed to by the various agencies mentioned. So you will

have that opportunity to go over it and see exactly what is said

and I know he will welcome any suggestion that you care to make.

Well that will be fine. Thank you

Good bye.

TELEPHONE CONVERSATION BETWEEN DCI AND DR. MILTON EISENHOWER

27 November 1963 - 10:25 a.m.

E:

I have a little problem here which I think you can help with. A professor

of Russian history who has spent many years studying the details of

the Rusian Secret Police is convinced in his own mind, based on a

study of their methods and other developments, that the assassination

of President Kennedy was engineered by the Police. Now, he is so

convinced of his being right that if he doesn't do anything else he would

like to give a public lecture on this theory and I am just a little afraid

that in the emotional environment at the moment, that this might be

given more attention by the public than it may deserve. I have persuaded

him at least to wait until the evidence which President Johnson has

insisted be developed and be given to the American public, so at least

he could weigh this against that,

But he wants to get it off his conscience

and what I am wondering is this: Do you have a couple of knowledgeable

subordinates who would be willing to take the time let him come over

and simply state his thesis in order to relieve his conscience and

perhaps in this way he will give up doing anything else. I don't know

how important this is.

DCI: Well, I think it is very important because the unfortunate slaying of

Oswald removes any opportunity to establish from direct testimony

the possibility of any such international plot and I am being beset by

communications from all parts of the world by people feeling they know

of an assassination plot by the KGB or more frequently assassination

plots by Cuba of which Oswald was merely the trigger man.

And of

course investigation of those is a very important part of this study the

FBI is making which we are supporting in every possible way. Now

I think it would be extremely useful to talk to this man. We have men

who are students of this

particular area of activity and if you would

give me his name..

E:

It is Professor Robert Slusser. Professor of Russian history. He is

more than a historian. He worked with Mosley at Columbia for some

years where a deep study of the Russian Secret Police was made. He

has also had foreign experience, but mainly what I want to give him

an opportunity to do is to talk to a couple of knowledgeable peoplesa

in absolute confidence hoping that this will satisfy him and not lead

to his making public statements.

DCI: How do I reach him?

E: I think the best thing to do -- I could give you his telephone number but

I think the best thing to do is if you can set up an appointment with someone

NW 65990 Docld:32403740 Page 12

at a particular time and place is to call me back and I will see to it

that he is there. Wouldn't this be the easiest thing to do?

DCIP Probably would be.

get me on BElmont 5 4088 in Baltimore.

TELEPHONE CONVERSATION BETWEEN DI AND SENATOR RUSSELL

2 December 1963 - 12:30 p.m.

DCI: I called you either on Thursday or Friday to tell you of this matter

that had been developing in Mexico City in connection with a fellow --

Nicaraguan -- presumably had some information and reported to us

he had some information on Oswald having received some money in the

Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. This (fellow) was greatly disturbed, --

we went into it in great detail with the Mexican authorities and with the

Nicaraguan Foreign Intelligence Service. Finally it blew up because

this fellow finally signed a statement on Sunday that everything he said

was a falsehood and he was misrepresenting because he was trying to win favor

in some future assignment foom us. But it was a matter of great concern

for a few days and I knew /Senator Saltonstall's call you were worried

about things like that and I wanted to keep you fully advised.

R: Thank you very much. When did it clear up?

DCI: Cleared up yesterday afternoon -- about noontime -- but it was thoroughly

run down and we think disposed of.

R: But he had been down in the Cuban Embassy hadn't he?

DCI: Yes he had been down in Mexico City seeking a passport and travel papers

to go to Havana and from Havana to Moscow. These were refused but

he spent from September 26th to October 3rd in Mexico City during which

time he had a number of contacts with both the Cuban and Soviet Embassies

but our information which is from extremely sensitive sources indicates

he was there in the interest of getting travel rights. What I think he hoped

was he could escape quickly from Dallas and follow that course.

R:

Wonder where he expected to get the money?

DCI: . I don't know.

We gave him $450 to bring him back from Russia.

R :

And they say he paid that back.

DCI: . That is what I understand.

R:

Well, I have just raised hell about bringing back everyone of these fellows

who went off and renounced their citizenship. I have fought and fought it.

NW 65990 Docld:32403740 Page 15

## Page 16

I have complained to the President, and to the Secretary of State.. I

have done it for the last 4 or 5 years, even while Eisenhower was President.

It is a disgrace to pay their way back here when (.....) on this country.

Let them stew in their own juice as far as I am concerned.

DCI: Well ...

R: Well, thanks for calling.

DCI:

All right, fine, and if anything along this line develops -- delighted you

are serving on that committee.. That will be a very important thing.

R:

I am certainly not delighted. I really think the President took unfair

advantage of me. He called me and talked to me about going on that

committee, who he could get on there and I didn't think any of the

Supreme Court judges would serve and I told him I didn't think they

should, so he said, well, they had to have a judge. I said well get :

Madina (phonetic) or somebody like that and the next thing I knew he

called me and said here is the committee I just announced to the press

and he had me on there and there wasn't anyway in the world I could

get out of it then. I haven't got time to do it in the first place and not of

the disposition and I just don't like Chief Justice Warren either.

DCI: Well, I am afraid you are on the committee anyway.

R: I just can't figure how to get out of it now.

DCI: Well, I'll keep you posted.

TEP SESHEU

2 December 1963

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Meeting with the President, 11:00 a.m., November 30th,

in attendance Mr. Bundy, meeting lasted approximately

1 1/2 hours

1. Reviewed the Checklist. The President immediately .

raised the question of what we were doing about Colonel Chennault.

He expects most serious public reaction and has a feeling that we

are "drifting" on this situation. I assured him we and the Venezuelan

government were doing all that was possible. However, he requested

more positive action on a report on the actions being taken.

NOTE: Wish a full report from the station for Sunday

morning briefing.

2. No other Checklist items raised any serious questions.

3. The President again raised the question of what we were

going to do in Cuba.

Bundy advised that a policy meeting was scheduled

for Monday, time not set, to discuss Cuban policy. I pointed out to

the President the statements of President Kennedy on September 5th,

September 13th, and November 20th, 1962 and then I showed the evidence

that proved absolutely that arms had been imported into Venezuela from

Cuba. I stated that most positive efforts should be made immediately

to secure complete OAS agreement on a course of action which would

involve a series of steps ranging from economic denial through blockade

and even to possible invasion, but that it must be OAS action, otherwise

it would involve confrontation with Khrushchev. I stated that if the

action was a Hemispheric action I didn't see that the USSR could do

much about it. The President agreed but decided to await the policy

meeting on Monday.

NOTE: DD/P and WH should prepare full recommendations

for positive actions which might be taken unilaterally with

the Caribbean states or with the OAS. for my use in the

policy meeting.

NW 65990 Docld:32403740 Page 17

## Page 18

4. I reviewed the report from Mexico City station, 27 November,

advising the nurnber of Soviets in Cuba, indicating that this report which

we thought was quite responsible more or less verified our own current

estimates.

5. Reference the Oswald matter, reviewed with the President

CAS Mexico City 7127 reporting on the interrogation of Alvarado. We

briefly discussed the composition of the Review Board announced by

the President on the 29th. Discussion of the Oswald situation was

inconclusive and no action required.

6. The President then brought up the question of Pakistan

and I reviewed briefly the intelligence community's feeling of concern

and their view that our Pakistan relationship was of the greatest

importance.

Bundy mentioned the forthcoming December meeting

between Ayub and General Taylor. The President made no comment

but seemed to feel that Taylor should remain in the United States

because of serious Defense budget problems. Bundy reviewed the

great number of commitments we have made to Pakistan and that we

would come to their defense if India should use our arms to attack

Pakistan. The President expressed the greatest of confidence in

Ayub and a feeling that we had not been forceful enough with him, had

not given him a feeling of confidence in our motives and that he had

drifted into the thought that we would abandon him in favor of India.

He stated that he wished this corrected in

a most positive manner.

7. I reviewed our Cuban overflight program advising the

President of the USIB criteria and the extent to which flights were

being carried on.

8.

Reviewed briefly the TACKLE China overlight and stated

these had been stood down since the loss of the last plane but we intended

to resume which the President thought was proper.

ACTION: I wish flight plans to meet COMOR priority in

targets for at least two flights for

submission to the

Special Group next Thursday.

9. I advised the President that the ChiCom-India border flights

had been completed and that we now planned to brief the Indians, Thailand

and very possibly Pakistan. I stated the equipment had been withdrawn

from Takhii.

and would be brought down on Monday. Also suggested that at an

early opportunity I brief him on the CORONA program.

Late developments on the Mexico City investigation of

Oswald's activities

3.

Resulte of the first interrogation of Silvia Duran have been received.

Reveals nothing other than confirmation of Oswald's effort to secure

authority to enter USSR via Havana. His requests were refused.

Result of second interrogation of Silvia Duran has not as yet been

received.

FBI dispatched a man from Washington to Mexico City at the request

of Ambassador Mann.

The Nicaraguan, Alvarado, has been turned over to the Mexican

authorities for questioning, by the CIA station at the specific request

of the FBI.

NOTE: ClA Headquarters refused this turn-over until

FBI request received because F Blis in control of the

investigation.

Alvarado's story becoming increagingly questionable because of a

public statement carried by Mexico City radio and press prior to

Alvarado's entering the picture, to the effect that Oswald had

received $5,000 from the Cuban Embassy.

To be used by DCI in meeting with the President at 10:30 on 29 November 1963

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Meeting with The President - 25 November and 26 November

1. On Monday, November 25th, there was no briefing of the President,

although there was a short visit with him at the State reception on Monday

evening. The President then expressed regret that events of the day

prevented a briefing and asked if there was any development requiring his

attention. I replied there was none and would call him if any developments

came to my attention.

2. On Tuesday, the 26th, I briefed the President, reviewing all

items on the Check List and the world reaction summary contained in the

Bulletin. Briefing and discussion on other matters consumed about

15 or 20 minutes.

3. The President asked if our entire applicable resources had been

made available to the FBI in connection with their report, which he had

ordered. I replied affirmatively.

NOTE: I should call J. Edgar Hoover concerning this.

(DCI did this at 1l:20 on 11/26/63)

4. The President asked my appraisal of the situation in Vietnam.

I replied that I was less optimistic than was the report received from

Ambassador Lodge.

5. Mr. Bundy stated the first order of business was to assist

State and assign a Deputy Chief of Mission capable of running the Country

Team and the American official community. Bundy recommended

Mr. Sullivan, Harriman's deputy. The President plans to have a man in

position not later than January first. •

6. McCone stated that there remained a number of individuals in

Saigon who continued to be troublemakers and should be removed.

Bundy confirmed this and stated actions were to be taken. No names

were mentioned.

NOTE: Apparently the President's appointment

secretary will be a Mr. Moyrs. We

should get to know him.

7. The President noted with some considerable contempt the

fact that certain people in the Department of Justice had suggested

to him on Saturday that an independent investigation of the President's

assassination should be conducted by a high level group of attorneys

and jurists, probably headed by Governor Dewey.

President Johnson

rejected this idea, and then heard that the identical plan was to be

advanced in a lead editorial in the Washington Post. The President

felt this was a deliberate plant and he was exceedingly critical. He

personally intervened, but failed with Mr. Al Friendly and finally

"killed" the editorial with Mrs. Graham.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Discussion with President Johnson, November 23rd,

about 9:15 a.m. The conversation lasted approxi-

mately 15 minutes.

1. The President entered Mr. Bundy's office alone and

no one was present during the conversation.

2. The President opened the conversation by recalling a

long background of association and friendship with me personally,

his respect for the Agency, the fact that on a number of issues

that had arisen since I took office as DCI he and I had seen eye

to eye, he had complete confidence in me and expressed the wish

that I continue in the future exactly as I have in the past.

3. I confirmed my confidence in him, my desire to help and

support him in every way and my willingness to continue in the

future as I have in recent months.

4. The President then asked of any world developments. I

reviewed details of the Checklist with him and explained the institution

of the "President's Checklist" with which he was not familiar. I

stated that we would continue the publication of the Checklist in the

future as we had in the past.

5. It was agreed that for the next few days I would brief the

President in the morning personally and that senior staff officers

would brief the President's staff each morning as I have in the past.

The President asked that any matters of urgent importance be brought

to his attention at any time, day or night. He designated no inter-

mediary.

6. At 12:30 I went to the President's office in the Executive

Office Building to tell him of the information received from Mexico

City. In attendance was Mi. Bundy. Following this I had a brief

exchange with President Eisenhower who was visiting with President

Johnson at the time.

7. This evening I called Secretary Rusk and reviewed with

him the information received from Mexico City, most particularly

the holding of a Mexican employee of the Cuban Embassy by

Mexican officials for interrogation concerning Lee Oswald.

explained to Rusk the information that we had transmitted to the

FBI and to the authorities in Dallas. Rusk had not known of these

developments prior to my communication with him.

8. I offered the assistance on the part of Mrs. McCone and

me personally and also the Agency in connection with the appropriate

handling of official visitors arriving from all over the world who

might overwhelm the State Department's capacity. Rusk appreciated

this offer and said he would call on me. He further said that there

may be visitors we would like to meet with and, if so, he would make

appropriate arrangements. He indicated that he intended to avoid

having all incoming visitors appear as guests of the United States.

Each had their own embassy to take care of them, however, he

thought there might be some obligations in which I could be helpful.

He said that following the Arlington service on Monday afternoon

he would hold a reception in the Department which would be in the

form of some kind of a buffet and this would be the extent of any

planned activities. He thought it was quite probable that the President

would meet with several Heads of States at various times on Tuesday

and Wednesday.

Thanks:

Dear Mr. Dulles,

were lef

Herewith some materials in loose sheet form on Trotskyism

and, in particular, Irotskyites in the U.S.

Of particular interest, I think, you will find the paper on

the differences between Trotskyism and the Communist move-

ment headed by the CP of the Soviet Union. This paper makes

eminent and clear the element of organized indiscipline which

has characterized the Trotskyite movement from its origins.

The paper also makes clear that there are two Trotskyite

factions in the U.S. Whereas both hold to the Trotskyite theory

of permanent revolution, they differ in their attitudes toward

the Soviet Union and the ruling group in the Soviet Union. The

larger -- call it the orthodox faction -- is the Socialist Workers!

Party, headed originally by Cannon and now by Dobbs. The

Militant is its weekly organ. It was with this group that

Oswald was in contact. The key element of the Socialist Workers!

Party belief, apart from permanent revolution, is support for

the Soviet Union -- if and when the chips are down.

Information of a summary character on the Socialist

Workers! Party and the Militant is also included in this

collection. For convenience and comparison the material!

bearing on Oswald's correspondence and views has been

reproduced and is included herewith.

crable number of organizations which are under Communist control

TRE YEAR 1001 at control

and which are very obviously promoting Communist objectives,

although they have not been officially cited as Communist fronts.

For obvious rensons, the publications of these groups though they

unquestionably fall

the category of Communist literature—

have not been considered in this tabulation.

Publications of Communist splinter

groups, too, have not been

considered thus far.

Although they have separated themselves from

the main Communist Party and disagree with it on some tretical

points, these groups and their publications must be considered in any

estimate of Communist strength in the United States.

Like the

main Communist Party, they are completely dedicated to the princi-

ples of Marxism-Leninism and, as will be demonstrated later in this

chapter, the main Communist Party, through united-front tactics,

has succeeded in winning the support and cooperation of these smaller

Communist organizations in promoting Soviet objectives in the

United States.

(See section beginniag on p. 40.)

One of these groups, the Socialist Workers (Trotskyist Communist)

Party has been cited as Communist and subversive by the Attomey

General of the United States. Its ofhcial newspaper,

The Militant,

reported an average paid circulation of aimost 5,000 for the 12 montas

preceding October 1961:

The Young Socinlist Alliance, & Trotslyist

youts group, has an official organ, The Young Socialist, also with s

claimed circulation of 5,000

The Marcist-Leninist Vanguard, Workers World, and Lurning fornt

aro some of the other publications which avowedly represent additional

Communist splinter groups in this country.

Though the total circulation of the publications of all these splinter

groups is not great, the fnet remins

that even a small number of

persons who operate on Marxist-Leninist conspiratorial principles are

& very real danger.

There may be only some thousands of people

who rend and agrce with the ollicial publication of the Socialist

Workers Party (which is more openly violent and subversive than

the main Communist Party) yet, allied with the orthodor Commu

nists of this country and their fellow travelers, they obviously intensify

the very real internal danger posed by the latter.

finally, a considerable number of magazines designed primanly for

rendership in academic circles-and with definite Martist and pro-

Communist orientation-have.sprung. up within the last year or so.

No ernet figures on Communist strength can be deduced from the

combined rendership of all these Communist and pro-Communist

publications.

One fact, however, does stand out beyond contradic-

tion when their probable readership figures are totaled.

the Communist movement in the United States must have & following.

revreater than 10,000 people and auchigenter than most ameriewns

CIRCULATION INCREASES

Moreover, there are indications that, at the present time,

the dis-

tribution and readership of the type of Communist literature under

consideration is increasing rather thnn decreasing.

Circulation of theofficinl Communist Party newspaper, The Worker,

has risen steadily since 1957.

A drive was begun in 1961 to increase

its subscribers to 20,000.

Prid circulation of the party's West Coast

newspaper, the People's World, increased by almost 1,000 in 196l:

Just wanted to check. I was down here today and I may have to

come down tomorrow, I don't know yet. I was sorry I wasn't here

when you were taking testimony, but I was down in Dallas. Went

on Don Smith's show and I was going to check around, but you have

a reception this afternoon. The next time I come down I'll check

in with you. I didn't have anything particularly on my mind, but

I wanted to compare a few notes.

Well, I have got some things I want to talk to you about, so will.

• you let me know the next time you come down?

Yes, the next time I come down, I'll give you a little more notice

so we can be sure to get together.

¡We might have lunch or dinner or something like that.

That is what I have in mind.

:O.K. - Have you seen that Buchanan book?

Yes, I have.

I have several copies of it. I sent two or three copies over and then

I got 2 more copies

today and sent sent over there.

Sent over here?

There is a new one out by Gunn.

•Yes, I haven't seen it.

That is in French. Talks about being translated from the English,

but I can't find the English copy of it.

I'll check it out.

Mc.C:

I am told it is more interestedly written than the Buchanan one,

- I talked to this fellow Gen. Staylan. He is a French general

somewhat related to the de Gaulle movement and he is an active

officei

I ran into him somewhere along the line and I got to talking

about the assassination with him and talked about the extent of all

this todo. And one evening he said, well, I'll tell you, you know

I have been associated with de Gaulle's govt, to some degree and

am thought to be in that camp. But he said, this assassination business

and all these articles have now become sort of interwoven into the

anti-American propaganda of France which is quite prevalent. Some

¡of it, he said, is inspired in the sense that the Gaulle's papers

have it, whether it comes from the govt. or not is something

else again.

But in any rate, it is the body of that and had been

incorporated in it in sort of an argument for the instability and

lack of dependability of the United States. Here was this noble

young soul who was very popular in France and elsewhere, and

that he was too good, so to speak, for the United States.

So they just knocked him off.

He came into his own, and his own received him not.

Now, the difficulty is, that this fellow Buchanan is a very articulate

on the radio and on TV. He has made several broadcasts and he

has gotten his story over to the point that if your report doesn't dispose

of it point by point, your report is a whitewash.

That is right.

And that is what my friends tell me. I passed that on to the

Chief Justic e.

Oh, there is no doubt that that is the case. It is not going to be

an easy thing to deal with it all, but we will have to take up his

points to a degree that they don't deserve, I think.

Yes, I am afraid you will. Well, fine, Jack, you let me know.

Yes, I will.

"Is where can I turn? to factional mutants of both systens,

to odü-ball Hegelian idealists out of touch with reality too

religious groups. to revisenist of the absurd anarchists. no!"

"I have lived under both systems, I have sought the answers

and although it would be very easy to dupe msel? into beliveing

one systen is better than the other, I know they are not.

I dispise the represenatives of both systems weather they

be socialist or christan democrates. Weath they be labor of

"Where I first went to Russia in the winter of 1959 my funds

vere very limited, so after a certain time, aiter the Russians had

assured thenselfs that I wes really the naive americen who belived

money every month oh it came technically through the Ped-cross as

fincial help to a poor polical. iminegeare but it was errenged by

the M.V.D..

I tola myseli it was simply because I was broke end

everybody new it. I eccepted the honey because I wes hungry. and

there was several inches of snow on the ground in Moscow at that

time but what it really was was payment for my denuciation of the

U.S. In Moscow in Novenber 1956 and a clear promise that far as

long as I lived in the USSR life would be very good. I didn't

relize all this, of course for alnost two veers.

As soon as I became completely disgrinted with the sovit Union

and started negotitions "ith the American Embassy in Moscow for

my return to the U.S. my "Red Cross" allotment was cut off.

This was not diffical to understand since all correspondence

in and out of the Embassy is censored as is common owlege in the

Embassy itscl

I have never mentioned the tact of these monthly payments

to anyone.

I do so in order to state that I shall aever sell

troats in an endless cold war.

Both our countries have major

short conings and advantages but only in ours is the voice

of dissent allowed opportunity of expression. In returning

to the U.S., I hope I have awaken a few who were sleeping and

others who are indifferent.

I have done a lot of critizing of cur system. I hope

you will take It in the spirit It was given.

In going to Russia

I followed the old principle.'Thou shall seek the truth and the

truth shall make you free.' In returning to the U.S. I have done

nothing more or less than selecting the lesser of two evils."

"The Cornunist Party of the United States has betrayed Itsele!

It has turned itseli into the tradional lever of

a foreig

power to overthrow the Goverment of the United States, not in

the name of freedom or high ideals, but in servile conformity

to the vishes of the Soviet Union and in anticipation of Soviet

Russia's complete domination of the Americen continent.

The Cormunist novement in the U.S., personalized by the

Commnist Party. U.So., has turred itself into 'valuable gola

coin' of the Krealin.

it has failed to denouce any actions of

the soviet Goverment when similar actions on the part of the

U.S: Goverment bring pious protest."

"No man, having known, having lived, under the Russian

Communist and American capitalist system, could possibly

make a choice between them, there is no choice, one offers

oppresstion the other poverty.

Both offer imperilistic

Injustice, tinted with two brands of slavery."
