DETAILS: AT CHICAGO, ILLINOIS

CG T-1 on July 31, 1963, advised

that on the

evening of July 29, 1963, GUS

ZAPAS and a fellow known

to him only as "New York PETE" were drinking at

"Orlando's Hideaway" located on Mannheim Road just north

of the Sahara Motel. Orlando's Hideaway is reportedly owned

by "Syndicate" representatives and is presently believed

managed by a former bartender named BARNEY (LNU) .

With

ZAPAS on the evening of July 29, 1963, was a 60 year old

short, stubby man who was accompanied by a beautiful blonde

about one third his age.

CG T-l stated that ZAPAS reportedly

spends considerable time at Orlando's Hideaway.

By letter dated September 3, 1963, the Royal -

Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Ottawa, Ontario, Canada,

a visit to Toronto by the latter on August 29, 1963,

The RCMP did not have any further particulars regarding

this meeting, however, assumed it was connected with union

activities in view of

the previous STERNMAN - ZAPAS connection.

It should be noted that the RCMP previously advised

that HYMAN STERNMAN is a prominent figure in the gambling

fraternity and was once engaged in "gray" steel marketing

in Chicago where he obtained steel in tight markets.

It should further be noted that numerous telephone

calls have been made from the offices of Local 46 to DAVIS

and CORRIGAN in Canada during the past few years.

CG T-2 advised that "BARNEYYA BAKER

a very good

Iriena of GUS ZAPAS, is selling stegras a side line and

is also working at the Palmer House in a capacity unknown

to him.

BAKER has been exhibiting paintings and telling

people

the paintings are his work, however, he confided to

CG T-I that the paintings were actually the work of a fellow

inmate

at Sandstone Penitentiary who did not want the paintings

and gave

them to BAKER.
