4. REPORT OF FINDINGS

On 5 February 1959, Agency A-M reported that Ingrid B Pulley nee

Katterre, received a letter from her mother on 26 January 1959 stating

substantially the following:

Pulley's mother sent Pulley a birthday package which was opened by

the East German postal authorities.

The package contained a few clothing

items, a piece of sausage and a can of hash.. It is forbidden to send sausage

and hash through the mail, therefore the package was returned to Pulley's

mother. The package was very messed up and returned in bad shape. Pulley's

nother received a notice to report to the police station in Langenstein

(nca), East Germany. She feels that she is to be charged for trying to ship

unauthorized items through the mails.

AGENT'S NOTES. There also exists the possibility that the police

wish to question Pulley's mother about Pulley.

This also indicated that

the police or East German postal authorities are maintaining censorship on

mail coming to Pulley from East Germany. An investigation was conducted

on Ingrid Pulley under dossier number GE-011806.
