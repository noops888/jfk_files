C/S COMMENT: *Reggab has number complex financial, documents and

personal problems which leading him consider return to Moscow for further

study in cinematographic institute. Believe he would definitely return if

encouraged by us and that he susceptible to recruitment as KUBARK agent

during Moscow sojourn and possibly as long range asset in Morpeco.
