MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

FROM:

SUBJECT:

Gerald J. Swift

Gerald Patrick Hemming

#429 229

1. Hal Tittsler, ASAC, MFO called to request

a name check on Hemming and

a Ron Mongul or Mongel:

He new or song or be that y

2. Tittsler was advised that OS had no record

of Mongul or Mongel, but that a file existed on

3. Tittsler explained that the Miami DCD Office

was queried by the Dade County Organized Crime Division

as to whether or not Hemming ever worked for the CIA

in Mexico.

The same inquiry pertained to Mongel

or Mongul.

4. I told Hal that Hemming never worked for

the ClA, and that he has falsely claimed to have

worked for the CIA on several occasions.

said that I thought this should be the limit of his

response other than to refer the Organized Crime

Division to the United States Attorney's Office in

Miami for further information concerning Hemming,

as he was to have been brought to trial there in

August 1977.

5.

I also advised Hal that inquiries of this

nature

should be formalized.
