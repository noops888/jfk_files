On Monday, & May 1972, Mr. Arthup lootey visited

Congressman Richard Ichord to show him

the exhibits he

requested and to answer any questions. Mr. Ichord is

Chairman of the House Committee on Internal Security.

of Oswald when he was in Mexico City. Mr. Ichord ex-

amined the documents and raised a number of points

which were answered candidly and without reservation.

He thanked us for easing his mind and said that we could

consider the macter closed. Mr. Ichord was well-disposed

toward this Agency from the onset and assured us that

anything said

or shown to him would be held in strict

confidence. A more detailed memorandum

is

attached.

SUBJECT: Lee Harvey Oswald Case: Briefing of Congressman

Richard Ichord,

May

1972

1. Mr. Joseph O'Neill, Office of the Legislative

Counsel, presented Mr. Arthugshootey, who furnished the

exhibits requested by

the Congressman, and answered his

questions as follows:

2. Mr. Ichord

said he was concerned over

of the Oswald Investigation from the

standpoint of his

committee. He wanted

to know if "during CIA's investigation

of Oswald when he was

Mexico" we developed any evidence

of a conspiratorial relationship between

the Soviets and

Oswaldeither through our coverage of the Embassy or

outside meetings.

He specifically referred to Soviet

consular officials Pavel Antonovich Yatskov and Valeriy

Vladimirovich Kostikov,

or both of whom Oswald

contacted at the Soviet Embassy. (Both Yatskov and Kostikov

were identified in the Commission's Report as consular

and KGB representatives.) I told him

that CIA

did not have Oswald under investigation when he was in

Mexico City; directed his attention

to the pertinent

exhibit; and explained that the KGB affiliations of

two Soviets were sunplied by CIA experts who were aware

of their activities and not by anything said or indicated

by Oswald in the evidence compiled by us. Mr. Ichord

examined the exhibit, noted that Osvald's short conversitions

only related to securing visas; indicated that he had been

misinformed; and

said that he had no further questions to

on this point.

3. He said that his question was sparked by Bernard

, JI. a former constituent,

knew very little when he requested the documents. Since

then he has learned of Fensterwald's dubious credentials

as an expert

on the assassination and of his association

with Jim Garrisson and others of questionable repute.

I detailed our own

difficulties with Fensterwald, his

insistence that we are hiding something,

and how, as

Executive Director

of the Committee to

Investigate

Assassinations,

he has been pressing us to release our

classified

under threat of invoking the

Freedom of Information Act.

4. At Mr. Ichord's request, I gave him a complete

rundown on how CIA learned of Oswald's presence in

Mexico,

and the circumstances surrounding the photo of the

which was

taken infront.ofthe-Soviet. Embassy

this picture which were generated by Edvard Epstein

nentionad that Fensterwald told us a year ago that he

knew the identity of the unknown man but so far has not

volunteered his name. One of Garrisson's charges as that

Oswald was a CIA agent and that we cut him out of the

picture. I took the occasion to stress that Oswald was

not a CIA agent and that we never had anything to do with

5. I mentioned that when the President's Commission

came into existence Mr. Helms issued specific instructions

to cooperate fully with the Commission and to give it

complete access to any information bearing

on the assassira-

that Commission members, at Mr. Helm's invitation

visited our Mexico Bity stasion for an on-the-scene

briefing and inspection. I told him

that we have not

released exhibits relating to Oswald's visits to the Soviet

and Cuban Embassies, because

sources of the above

information are extremely sensitive and still productive.

Mr. Ichord fully agreed on this score and complimented us

on the extent of our coverage.

6. Mr. Ichord asked what steps CIA was taking to

declassify its other documents. I told him of the required

five year cycle (one coming up shortly), the reviev

and CIA's desire to release

I pointed out that most of our material consists of "nut

complaints", rumors, gossip,

etc; which have no security

significance per se

but could be embarassing to innocent

persons; disclose a productive and friendly

or acknowledge CIA's presence abroad where diplomatically

this would be inadvisable.

I cited our experience with the

"crank call" that originated in Canberra, Australia; how

in 1968 ve tried to declassify this exhibit but Aucteatian

security officials objected on the grounds that it would

publicly acknowledge

CIA presence on their soil and perhaps

stir unwarranted controversy.

I. stated that despite the

above-type problems we gradually have been

declassifying

CIA's material, sanitizing exhibits, as necessary to

protect

our sources and methods.

7. I mentioned in passing, that two other things

our control have contributed to the misconceptions

our exhibits:

A)The inadvertent release

by National

Archives of the master list of numbered exhibits shortly

after the demise of the President's Commission

distinguishing between overt and classified items; and

B). the fact that many exhibits bear different numbers

but are interrelated, thus giving a false impression

there are more exhibits than is the case.

the master list without the accompanying documents

caused much apprehension

and misinterpretation, particularly

among assassination

"buffs" and Agency critics.

and the U-?"'

entry which was widely exploited

until we declassified the document a couple of years ago.

Mr. Ichord asked if any CIA members served

the President's Commission. I said no,

but mentioned that

former DCI Allen Dulles was on the Commission. He then

turned to the makeup of the Commission staff and how it

was chosen. I replied that we were not really competent

to comment on how it was chosen but the staff consisted

largely of attorneys of varied political and ethnical

backgrounds from widely separated parts of the country;

the Commission was impressively

organized and a highly motivated, hard working group.

9. Mr. Ichord stated that he had no further questions

to ask and thanked us for easing his mind. We offered

produce any other documents he might wish to see. Mr. Ichord

replied that this would not be necessary. He returned our

exhibits and told us to consider the matter closed.
