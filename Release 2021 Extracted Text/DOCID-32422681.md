PROJECT LIONION

Identification. This is a technical (primarily photographic) surveillance

operation against the PBRUMEN Embassy in Mexico City.

Objectives. Tue operation 1a designed to (1) furnish photographic coverase

during daylight hours of the entrances of the target installation, (2)

dispatch physical surveillance teams against persons associated with the

tarset, and (3) keep in readiness a listening post for the monitoring and

• recording of eventual technical penetration

The target Installation is the PBRUMEN Embassy compound (Including

Consulate) In Mexico City. The above-listed objectives are accomplished by

two trained, full-time surveillance agents who live across the street fron

the target.

The project 1s 1r. consonance with Pilority A, Objective i, of the

current Related Mission Directive for Mexico.

Background. This project, herewith presented for approval for the first time,

does not represent a new operation.

LIONION activity has been going on since

1962 and costs have heretofore been charged to PBRUMEN FI funds.

The

operation produces photographs of persons associated with the PBRUMAN babassy,

both

staff and visitors.

These photographs are normaily reviewed for identi-

fications by the PBRUMEN section at the Station, then shown separately to

LITAMIL-9 and LITANIL-? wio are penetration agents working Inside the tarset.

They are subsequently forwaried to the CI section of in/SA where they are shown

• to PBRUMEN intelligence detectors AMNIP-1 and ANMUG-1.

Of those assets to whon

they are routinely shown, LITAMIL-9 has to date made the largest number of

identifications.

The photos have proven of great value. Within hours of the

arrival of a new Imbassy staff member his photograph is in the hands oi the

Station,

In addition to the identification of staff and visitors, the photos

(accompanied by a los kept by the LIONION agents) reveal patterns of action

(arrivals and depertures) and details of personal associations (who associates

with

whom) which are of great value to the Station in mounting operations against

the target.

In addition to photography, LIONION-1 and LIONIOH-2 are often called upon

to do visual surveillance of the target installation and LIOIION-1 is essentiel

to the dispatching of the LIMBRACe surveillance team against individuals

associated with the target.

Because of the presence of police patrol cars in

he vicinity, the Station's mobile surveillance assets cannot come close to th

arget, hence the need for LIONION-1's dispatching services.

The presence of LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 also Insures continued occupancy of

a valued piece of real estate which will be used as a listening post when the

Station succeeds in installing additional technical surveillance devices in the

of concealed radio transmitters.

SEBASTIRE:

Do Operatioiral Auseta (Personrei).

LIONION-1 16 a young PRAUMEN laujer a exile. • He left PBRUMEN in 1960,

planning to continue on via Mexico to the Jited Statos where he residel in

his carly jcars.

.His two brockers are Ansrican citizens, one a desk officer

In the Department of Comerce. In lisshingt. the other a police official in

Tampa, Florida:

"While In Mexico LIONIONI was recrulted, an LILILY-1, to

perfora PBruMiN operational suppert serrigas for the station and, once laving

a taste of clandestine activity,, decides i remain in Mexico. LIONION-2, his

mother, was recruited in 1961, as LILlY-z, as a basehouse occupant and

operator in the LIFEAT/LIbFUDE technical peration aimed at the PBRUMEN

Embassy. At this same time LIOOt-I aiso cased into LIFEAT/LIBRODE work and

the two worked together as a tes.

In losE LIONION-1 and LIUNION-2 worked

together in processing the take of the LISE/LILODE/MKTRAP Installation, now

known as LIOMEN.. At this tise their cripwooms wera changed from LILILY-l and

•2 to LIFBUD-22 and 23, respectively.

In ise latter part of 1962 the tro agents

began the present photographic surveillanse operation.

LIONIOWN-1 was granted an DA on 18 MaT ISU2 by IMVii-10664. He was

ICFLUTTERED on 8 October 1903, HMATY-1200÷.

LIONION-2 was granted en dA on 16 Mar Ip62 by IMMN-IOG60.

LIONION-1 1s the mainstay of the operssion. LIONION-2 acts as his assistant

and fill-in at such times as he is absent izum the observation post.

principally as observers anà photographers. LIONIOIl-l also acts as a dispatcher

for the LIFMBRACE surveillance tean from wich he is compartmented. Dispatching

1s done by radio using pre-manged innocuts code terminolory; the tear does not

know LIONIoti-i or ils precise lvation. 2=2101-1 also proccoses on the prenises

all photographic coverago of the main imhessy sate through final printing, cropping

and mounting.

Photographic coveraje of the consulate gate is processed through the

negative development stage.

Control is primarily firancial buttressed by the knowledge, on the part of

the agento, that es PERIMEN refugees thay on milnerable to pressure which night

be brought upon them by KUBARK through the dexican goverment should they get out

of line.

Motivation is a conbination of Marcial necessity and violent aversion

to, and determination to bring about the anufall of, the AMPHUG regime.

additional motivating factor is that both agents actually enjoy what for many would

be monotonous work.

Psychologically, they are ideally suited to this sort of work.

Both agents realize that they ere workerg for PBRIME intelligence; LTONION-1

appears to be avare that he is vorking for INAPK. The cover utilized by LIONION-2

Is thut of dependent mother.

LIONION-1 pesses as a would-be writer who can afford

to dabble without notable publishins success cecause of family landholdings in

Tampa, Florida (Inherited fros his decease: sather), which enable hin to live as

a "rentiste," one who lives an incode fras sources other than saintul employment.

His rentista status is registered with the lexican government.

In October 1964

this cover successfully withstool intensire investigation by Mexican euthorities

checking on persons of questiorable status is tax collection purposes. The

Station plans to bolster the writing cover ith supporting documents from a

literary agent in New York City, these wii: se requested in separate corespondence.

Communication 1o primarily with LIONION-1; with LIOHION-2 only in his

absence.

Meetings, pre-arranged or signalled by innocuous phone calls (calls

Security kualuation. If either of the LIONION agénts ars uncovered by Mexican

authorities no engased in operations against the target, they have been briefed

to indicate that they are working for an exile orranization based in the MAvE

ares on a voluntary, non-pald, patriotic basis and to stick to the story covering

their income.

This would probably hold up unless they were causht in flarmnte

with the KURIM automatic pulse camera on the premises. This camera is of such

refinement and complexity as to be difficult to ascribe to an exile organization.

In any event, LIONION-1 has a close relationship with an official of the Mexican

president's office.

Tils connection, developed by LICHIOll-1 for his own prutection,

enabled him to weathe; the tax investisation and can be used by him to ovarcome any

future difficulties with Mexican authorities.
