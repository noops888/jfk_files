I, _

David Li Christ

_, understand that by virtue of my

duties I have been the recipient of information and intelligence material and

data which concerns the security of the United States. This information and

intelligence, together with the methods of collecting, handling and dissemi-

nation are classified according to security standards set by the United States

Government.. I am aware that the unauthorized disclosure of such information

is prohibited by the Espionage Laws, (18 USC Secs. 793 and 794), and the

National Security Act of 1947 wich specifically requires the protection of

intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure.

I agree that I do not now, nor will l'ever, possess any right, interest,

title or claim whatsoever in or to any of the information or intelligence or the

methods of collecting or handling it which has come to my attention, but shall

always recognize the full and vested property right of the United States in and

to such matters.

I do solemnly swear or affirm that I will never divulge, publish or reveal

by word, conduct or by any other means such information, intelligence or

knowledge except when necessary to do so in the performance of my official

duties and in accordance with the laws of the United States, unless specifically

authorized in writing in each and every case by a duly authorized representative

of the United States Government.

I understand that the provisions of this oath will remain binding upon

me, even though by relationship in being terminated.

I agree that in the event I am ever called upon to testify in a court of

law, administrative proceedings or other tribunal regarding information of

intelligence within the scope of this oath, I will notify a duly authorized

representative of the United States immediately; I will also advise the court

or tribunal of my oath to the United States Government and request that my

need to testify be established before l am required to do so.

I understand that this oath will be retained by the United States Gov-

ernment for its future use in any matter within the scope of this oath. I

take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation of purpose of

evasion and in absence of duress. Projects being terminated EP.

Maurd I Christ
