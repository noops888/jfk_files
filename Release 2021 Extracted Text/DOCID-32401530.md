Shamrock further reported that the Soviets felt

that President Kennedy's death was a great loss, not only

for

he United States and the, Soviet Union, but Io1

the whole

According to Shamrock, the Soviets felt that they

could trust President Kegnedy and could deal with him on a'

cooperative basis. Shamrock further stated that the Soviets

mourned President Kennedy's death,

a situation which Shamrock

• considered very unique inasmuch as

the person being mourned

We feel we should disseminate this data since

we have previously disseminated the information we received

from Yuri Nosenko regarding the assassination even though

we recognized some of the data was not subject to proof,

particularly, that occurring within the soviet Union.

•We feel that by documenting Shamrockas a "confidential

informant, contact with whom has been insufficient to

establish his reliability," we will alert other agencies

that the information has not been established as true.

We have received information from numerous other

sources that the Soviets did mourn the death of President

Kennedy and that Soviet leaders felt they could work with

President Kennedy.
