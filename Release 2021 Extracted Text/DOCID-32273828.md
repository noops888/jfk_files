Date: September 16, 2021

From: National Archives and Records Administration

Subject: Missing JFK Assassination Records Collection Document 181-10002-10216

To: The File

This memorandum briefly summarizes the status of a missing document in the President John

F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection (JFK Collection) and documents the National

Archives and Records Administration's (NARA) efforts to provide representative, but not

identical, information, in lieu of the missing document, from records available at the Lyndon B.

Johnson Presidential Library in Austin, Texas.

While preparing previously-restricted Kennedy Assassination Records Collection documents for

release, the JFK processing team could not locate the document associated with Record

Identification Form (RIF) 181-10002-10216. The unclassified, 15-page document belongs to the

record series "NL Administrative Files [Access and Reference Case Files]" and pertains to

President Lyndon Johnson's Daily Diary Entries, June 6, 1967. According to available

information on the RIF, the Johnson Presidential Library sent the document to the Office of

Presidential Libraries (NL), likely during 1977 or 1978.

An extensive search of records in the JFK Collection, the Office of Presidential Libraries, and

the Johnson Presidential Library, did not locate any possible original administrative

correspondence associated with the Record Identification Form. Knowing that the missing

document contains 15 pages and pertains to the Johnson Daily Diary Entries for June 6, 1967, it

is our best assumption that the document probably consists of brief, if any, administrative

correspondence, and multiple pages from the Daily Diary Entries.

For informational purposes, we are including this memo and a copy of the Johnson Daily Diary

Entries for June 6, 1967, with Record Identification Form 181-10002-10216. This open-in-full

document is also available on the Johnson Presidential Library's website at

http://www.lbjlibrary.net/collections/daily-diary.html.

Mike Manatos memo of gist (sent to DT) indicates the following:

The President began the discussion as we proceeded with breakfast by an in-depth

report on developments on the Middle East confrontation. His report was greeted with enthusiasm by the leadership.

Uppermost in the President's mind and what seemed to concern the Leadership

most was the progress of the Railroad legislation before the Senate and House Committees.

The President urged the

leaders to make certain we did not get involved in a railroad strike which all agreed would be disastrous.

There were

pledges of support from all in attendance, with assurances from Mansfield that the Senate would act on Wednesday.

There followed a short review of other important legislation, but this seemed

anti-climatic.

Statement

The cease-fixe vote of the Security Council opens a hopeful path away from

danger in the Middle East. It reflects responsible concern for peace on the

part of all who voted for it. The United States has warmly supported this

resolution. We hope the parties directly concerned will promptly act upon it.

We believe a cease-fire is the necessary "firbt step', in the words of the resolution

itself -- a first step toward what we all must hope will be a new time of settled

peace and progress for all the peoples of the Middle East.

It is toward this end that we shall now strive.

Sanders: memo of gist of mig w/ judicial nominees: (from page 5)

During the mig, the President stressed his interest in equal justice and ecual

rights for all and told those present that they should always strive not only to be

fair but to be sure that all who appeared before them thought they were being

treated fairly and impartially:

Fle pointed out that Federal judges tend to get arrogant and they should each

engage in a little self-examination now and then to be sure they were not becoming

arrogant.

He urged them not to stay on the Bench past retirement age, but to take adrantage

of retirement eligibility and to stand aside for younger peopie.

He said that he wanted to be proud of them as Johnson nominees and they should

always keep in mind that any unfavorable comments about their personal conduct

or their official actions,

would always mention that they were Johnson nommees.

The President stated that their Senators, Congressmen, the Justice Department,

and he had reviewed their qualifications and that he was personally satisfied that

they were the best men available.

The mig was off the record - pictures were taken of the group.
