SUBJECT:

Review of Mexico City Station Files

at the Warrenton Record's Center

On 2 May 1977 Chris Hopkins and Annie Goodpasture

visited the Warrenton Record's Center to review old Mexico

City files in search of additional photographs of the

"unidentified man". We were unable to locate any such

photographs.

It appears that earlier photographs may have

been destroyed in a purge of Mexico City Station files and

that the folders for the destroyed material were

re-used to

forward more recent photographic material to Headquarters

for retention.

Following are the Job numbers of boxes reviewed

and pertinent notations

re re-use of the old folders:
