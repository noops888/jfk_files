The story provided by Subjoat during our intervien at the United

States Consulato 1n Triesto on 25 Jotober 1905 concerning hia experiendes

while in tho soviet Union 18 essentially the same as that provided by Dr.

George Renninger in raferenoe (a).

Although Subject was reasonably 0o-

operativo, he was not as fully communloativo as we aliht have desired.

In

conaldering the varlous possiblu roasons for his partial hesitando It ap-

pears rather obvious now that our continued interest in what he interproted

to be a very simplo relationshin with a Soulet girl has caused him to sua-

peot that posalbly ve are suspiclous of him.

Ragording to subjeot, the

entiro episode was reported fully whilo in Mosoow and again to KUBARK last

Christmas uhilo he was on a vialt to the United statos.

Subject stated

that he had prepared a roport in writing for Dr. Goldbers at Prinoston

Univereity who dots as a &y tetween for rubark.

It 1s obvlous that he was

probably asked to prepare a genoral report on his experionous while in tho

Soviet Union for KULOOK which we had not been aware of previoualy and. whloh

may not have come to the attention of KUDESK. Unlues Headquarters has some

arrived al the lasturo, subjege and did dotten Dr dear persues

who was at the Insiitute

approached by V1a11.a1r Anatolailan SOKOLAVSKTY uhlie walting la the care-

toria l1ne. SOKCLOVSKIY, who identifled himself as an Anerican, said that

he had heard that way were in the Instliüle and ranted to meet ther. Dur-

ing this first conversation Subjeot clales that SOrOLOVSKIY told them thet

he was in faot W1lllam Hanilion MARTIN and went on to explain some of the

supertsaial decalla surruunadus nis delec:ion to the sovies Union in 1900.

MARTIN told them that 1f they did not consider him 'oo tainted, he would

weloone the opportunity of calking to scra ararioans.

He felt that there

wore many lacers of hla experiances while in the soviet Union shion he

would like to talk about but whlch he could not dissass with his sovlet

that Subjeat would tave wanted to avold ther. They cold MARTIN that it

was perfectly permissible for him to talk to them, but that he should de?-

Initely not reveal his true identity to them nor should he give then his

would avoid talking to subjeat. Based on MARTIN's astlons, Subjoot assumed

this usually depended on who was prosont in the lunon roon.

at this point that their disousslons with MARTIN were always in Engilsh.

4o MARTIN made 1t definitoly clear to Subjoot that he was intorasted

in getting out of the Sovlet Union.

He desoribed life in the USSR as a

constant game with the soviet offloals.

MARTIN felt that he had only been

able to keep his noad above water while there because of his knouledgo of

soviot. lan.

Hu, explained to Subjoet that he had devoted a great deal of

time studying Soviet law and had usad his knowlasgo to protoot himsell.

The Soviets were frequently at a loss when confronted with quotations fron

their own laws in total confliot with aotlons which hey vere trying to

imposs on MARTIN. Subjeat was once asked to write a letter to MARTIN'B

parents asking them to put pressure on the sovieto and the prese to help

in obtaining hia releaso.

Subjeot sald that-a copy of thie letter nuat

be avallable at KUdirK.

So MARTIN also desoribed in great detail to subjeot life 1n genoral

within the Soviet Union and what the average Sovlet citiion must faoe every

day.. It was obvious to Subleat that MARTIN had been greatly diaillusioned

following his arrival in the USSR when he found a society totally different

from what he had antialpated prior to his departure from the United States.

The Sorlets had exerted conalderable pressure on Subjeot to partloipate 1n

vardous antI-US radio prograns or to write anti-US artiales.

disoussion back and forth MARTIN agreed to write something if they would

promise to publish it without editing.

He wrote what he considered a very

. objective comparison of life In the USSR and that in the U.S. After having

submitted this artiole he was never approached again on this toplo.

6. Regular contaots between Subject, RENNINHER and MARTIN continued

In the lunch room with general conversations such as those noted above un-

t1l December or early January, 1964.

At this point MARTIN asked Subjeet

if he or RENNINGER wauld. go to the U.S. Imbesay to ask them if there vere.

any way in which they could assist him in. leaving the Soviet Union legally

or othernise.

Subject risted that' RENNINGER had already contacted the U.S.

Embassy following the first meeting with MARTIN to report on their con

versations with him and the faot that he was in Moscos.

emphasized lhat unis was entiruly casual and that their conversation at this

meeting lasted for only a fen mocenus.. A few days or possioly a week later

MARTIN saw jubjoat in the lwich room and bentioned that "Alla" had found

him quite a handsone individual. MARTIN soationed this oaly in passing and

in no way, as far as Subjeot has concerned, auteupted to force "Alla" on suù-

sonetime during the latter part of January 1964 SUjeot had his

first date with "Alla."

Subjeat couid not recall exsatly how this was ar-

ranged, but belleves that he met her in the lunch room and asked her to go'

on a troika ride with him.

This was followed by five or six other dates

with her ovor the next seven or eight weeko. Trey went to a film

onod, the

Bolstoy onou, the upera onde and restaliants on two or three occasions.

Afler a while Subjeot notloed that she was partioularly interested

in his Soviet friends and other contaots in the Soviut Union.

Por example,

on the evening they attorded the Bolahoy, Subleat notloed hia friend willlam

(8B112) PARRIS, an Anerloan exchango student at the Mosoon State Univeraity.

Subject had known him at Princeton University. Subjeot said,

"What did you say abuut SOKOLOVSKIY?" In other

woris, she knen porfeutly woll that SOKOLOVSKIY and Willias MANTIN here one

Acoording to Subjoot, "Alla" seened to lum to ba suah too friendly,

willo at the sane time not sinourely friendly.

In february, Subjoot's. sus-

ploions had mounted to the poirt whore he deuided to ask. his Soviet 0ol-

league In the Instituto, Ilja ROYZIN (phonetia), 1f he oould check with

some of his contaots to determine if "Alla" vas in faot being usod against

him for sone purpose, Subjeat alained that he already ken at this point

Shortly afterwards, ROYLIN re-

turned to Subjoat with the advise to stop seuing her.

He castioned Sub-

joat that he should not mention to anyone that he had talkal to him and

certainly not to say anything. Subjeat claima that he stooped dating her

after this point, but did oocasionally see her in the lunch room. After

Subjeot stopped seeing her she called him at his hotel every two or three

days.

At no point did MARTIN really push Subjeat on continuing the relation-

8h1p.

Subjeot desoribed their relationship as perfectly natural for tho

young people interested in each other.

They selden discussed anything of

importands and never disoussed his work at the Institute.

him to spend the night with her, but he indicated that he should got back
