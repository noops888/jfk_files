(A170r8 all of then are repetitions of previous

charges al reports, known well to both the Hadrid

rellability, reputationg and good faith are question-

¡reliminary Analyaig: As pointed out in a preliainary

analysis or the AlliAsi complex, made in March 1965 when I. var

preparing for travel to ladrid in connection with the QUHOPS-1

саве:

...There 18 no convincing evidence that the group 18

working either for or agalnat the regire of fidel CAsiro.

Reports

on their contacts with us and their discussions asong

thensolves are at variance.

In 1962 Fidel CASTRO, reportedly

knowing that they were plotting sidinst him, talked to AMLABH-1

and seven sembers of his group to enliat their support agalnst

Anibal ESCALANTE Dellunde and the cosmuniats in Cuba. Possibly

they are playing both ends against the middle.

They certainly

have been and are in contact with the two ends."

The folloning

consents are keyed to matters raised by ESPINOSA:

A. The AMLASH COnspIrACy - As detailed by MADR-3716

(IN 28634) On 6 April 1965, UUSPORT-1

reporting on a meeting

of the AMIASH grOUp, Including AHHHIP-1, mentioned the folleaing

Bigalficant points:

(2) KUBARE HAS CritiCized fOr "fOOlIng arOund sOr

years" without helping and for jeopardizing the operation;

(2) the group was to be prepared to denounce

ODYOKE as responsible 1f the operation tails and belloved that

the resulting scandal rould make the Bay of Piga seen insigni-

ficant; and

(3) AMLASH-3 wag In touch with Cuban Intelligence

as established by coded nessages which he exhibited.

As reported by PARI-153% (IN 82939) on 4 June 1965, baged or

mootings vIth ESPINOSA, the problem seen by Paris is that

CICAET

"the AMlASH circle ls wide and each now friend of whon we learn

geens to have knowledge of the plan."

I believe that the

problen is & more serious and basic one. An indicated in

paragraph 3 of the present senorandum,

Fidel CASTRO himself

reportedly knew as far back as 1962 that the group was plotting

against hin and, knowing it, enlisted its support.

Hence we

cannot rule out the possibility of provocation.

Assassination,

Involvement 18 made known.

In the instant case, the risks of

exposure of the ODYOKE hand would appear high, whether there 18

& provocation or not.

Considering the individuals who are

Involved diroctly, their contacts with KUBARK officers, and their

reported plan to expose olYons, persiating in the plan could

be highly embarrasBing to kuBark.

This is even more the cage

now that ESPINOSA has talked to ODENVY and ODUlGE, although

fortunately the tenor of his complaint was that KUBARK had not

given adequate support to the plan.)

в.

The contacts at Paris and the matters affecting

the Paris Station. - The

"recruitment" of Maureen had been the

subject of an exchange of cables between Paris and Headquarters

and of discussions at Headquariers between MH/C and WE (See

PARI-1071 (IN 66557) and DIR-10955).

The annoying thing in

this connection now is that ESPINOSA has talked about it to

ODENVY and ODURGE and the danger that, 18 he is indiscreet,

bia story about this (and the other satters) could reach some

•curious newspapernan. (In this connection, It appears that the

questionable decision to put laureen in touch with the AMLASH

group was made without the knowledge of STOCElOOD.).

ESPINOSA

did not report any critician of the KUBARkers at Paris but it

is evident that the AMlASH group knows more about then than

we might wlah.

What ig new and of concern from ESPINOSA about

matters in Paris 18 his story of AMWHlP I and UNSNAFU-18

dealings.

The questiong raißed about AWWHIP-l are of nutual

concern Bigo to Headquarters which has been running him and

Hadrid which he has visited often.

(On the occasion of my

previous trip to ladrid on the QUiOPS-1 case, GROMERY had voiced

his doubts about the whole group and specifically about Aswalp-l.

and his connection with UNSNAFU-19.)

At issue are two basic

points, the knowledge

on the part. of UNSNAFU-19 about SUBARK'&

connection with AWHIP-l and the charge that AMWHIP-1 has been

defrauding KUBARK in the jewelry transaction. Also to be kept

In wind 1s the fact that ODENVY has an office in Paris which

well might have been inforned of the allegations and which night

have been agked for comments - although ODENVY policy always

has been to stay away from any investigation of other government

agencies unless specifically directed by the Attorney General

to lavestigate.

AHLASH-2

and -3 were in Madrid and wanted direct contact, but the

Btation hag had segarvationg about seeing then.

The Station has

been involved Indiroctly because of reporting by ite sources

about and involvement of Station targets with both the AllAsh

and AMWORLD operations (both handied

fros Headquarters).

(8e8 MADR-2982 (IN 72258) Rad MIDR-2988 (IN 73094) (both RYBAT).)

MeetIngs among QUBPORT, GUSHIFT-1, AMKHIP-) and AHLASH figures

produced conflicting reports which previougly were diacussed at

Madrid and at Headquarters.

Insofar as GROVERY himself 1a

concerned, it must be kopt in mind that he is a natural target

on whos the AMLaSH sroup wouid be inclined to focus lts com-

plaints.

. With regard to the speciiie complaint about "Tota",

GROMERY has Identified her as GUSHIFT-? and has reported that

no staffer frow the Station ever had contact with her.

1. Further Involvement of ESPINOSA: On 10 JUDe ODENVY

EBPINOSA to ask whether he had succeeded in contacting
