MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Inspector General

FROM

: John S. Hunt

Security Analysis Group

SUBJECT

:

Congressional Investigations of the Agency

1. Per our discussion, I would like to throw out the

following thoughts with relation to establishing a set of

procedures to handle requests from congressional committees

for information, with specific reference to the newly formed

House Committee

to investigate the assassination of President

Kennedy, et al.:

Al1 requests from Congressional committees

should be directed to a given focal point within

the Agency.

Any requests levied directly on any

other component should not be accepted, and the

requester should be referred to the focal point.

b.

The focal point should initially be com-

prised of Agency officers who have the benefit of

previous experience in dealing with congressional

Investigations, and the assignment of these

officers should

remain reasonably stable in order

to capitalize on this experience factor.

This

would, inevitably,

require a rather long overlap

prior

to any reassignments.

C .

An action unit within each directorate

be officially designated

to handle congressional

inquiries of this nature (I believe this has

already been accomplished) and again, where

possible, the experience factor should be taken

into consideration.

d.

All requests received by the focal point

should be directed, in writing, to the appropriate

action

units within

the various directorates.

form similar to that used by the Review Staff

would be appropriate.)

The Review Staff Registry (now under

the control of the Executive

Registry be reacti-

vated and placed under the direct control

of the

focal point.

and slotted to this registry,

regists on ace for stamediate

future it would be preferable if the two officers

formerly assigned to the Review Staff Registry

be utilized.

f.

The newly designated Registry should

then keep complete records on the following:

(1) Copies of all incoming congressional

requests.

(2)

Copies of the focal point's dissemi-

nation of the request to the various

action

units within the Agency.

(3)

Copies of all responses received e from

the action units.

(4)

Copies of the final response to

the

congressional committee.

(5) Records pertaining to any interviews

of current Agency employees by a congressional

committeefore

Memberstaff of that committee.

Records pertaining to any material

reviewed at the Agency by the staff or members

of a congressional committee.

(7)

Maintain an adequate index to the

above materials, which would preferably allow

for retrieval on the basis of date, subject

matter, and/or requesting committee.

As you know, the above suggestions represent my own

personal views, but I feel strongly that we are heading down a

path leading to the total disregard of all knowledge we have

gained during the last two years of extensive outside investi-

gation of the Agency. Since it is clear that these investigations

2

## Page 5

will continue for the foreseeable future, it would seem

that we must fall back to our earlier posture of setting up a

unique and separate organization within the Agency to handle

these inquiries

The Review Staff was formed for this purpose,

and I think a similar staff is required at this time.

Hunt
