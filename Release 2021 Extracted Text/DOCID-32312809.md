The situation which existed at the time of our

exchange of correspondence in October, 1970, appears to have

dissipated in recent weeks.

The /Cuban Mission to

the United

Nations (CHUN) has been quite receptive to visitors In recent

Weeks atthough some restrictions are still being imposed on

distribution of literature by

CHUN personnel to domestie sub-CS

versive groups.

We bellove

it would be appropitate at this time for

your Office to discuss the details of your proposal with our

involved field offices.

covers homestead Air force. Base; our lampa office covers

contact from your office, and they will be in a position to

discuss this matter without restriction and to keep our head-

quarters informed ot alt developnents.

NOTE FOR SACS:

Single copies of referenced Air Force letter are

enclosed for recipients. All offices have had prior experiences

with similar operations

and it is expected that any proposal

by Air Force will be thoroughly analyzed with positive recon-

mendations promptly forwarded to the Bureau.

If Air Force is

able to produce a competent serviceman who is agreeable to

undertaking the assignment,

we should carefully consider the

Air Force proposal and lend our support to the operation wherever

Teasible.

NOTE:

Classified "Secret, Group I" since this involves very

sensitive operation against an enemy diplomatic establishment, s

nauthorized disclosure of which could seriousiv alfect nationa

defense interests.

In past we

have had some limited success /with "walk-in" (5)

operations involving military personnel visiting CHUN fOr

various reasons. In 10/70 Air Force proposed sending Cuban-LS.

born serviceman

into CMUN and offering a document for sale

based on either desire for money or an affinity for the Cuban

regime. At the time we discouraged the plan, as we had just

rranged Ior State Department to declare the two top intelligenceS

•Pficers at the CMUN persona non grata and the entire complement

at the CMUN was very nervous and suspicious. We have noted a S!

mary person an

general relaxation, as indicated, and we feel now would be an

opportune time to try the plan, if it can be made to appear

" logical.

1. (U) Reference is made to our letter of 19 October 1970, file and

subject as above, and to your letter of 27 October 1970, file (NI)

105-99938.

2. (S) The essence of our letter was to suggest for your considera-

tion and analysis an operationi targeting the Cuban Intelligence Service

(CubIs). The basic scenario entailed an Air Force asset, Laf CubanCS_

birth or descent, stationed at /Homestead AFB or McDill AFB, Florida

walking in to the Çuban Mission to the United Nationg and offering alS

document for sale based on either monetary or ideological motivation.

Our stated objectives were: (a) (the acceptance of our controlled asset

by the CubIS as a credible espionage agent, (b) a determination of -

CubIS EEls directed against USAF installations in Florida, (c) a deter-LS_

mination of CubIS MO in handling USAF assetsand, (d) a determinationS

of the degree of cooperation between the CublS and the Soviet Intelligence

Services.J <S]

3. (S) Your Bureau's evaluation of the proposal was that such an opera-

ion possessed minimal chance of success at that time in light of the the

recent persona non grata action taken by the United States Government ES.

against two EMUN officials. It was concluded this action would atiect

CubISioperations for many months to comeJand make the chance for LS

success of any walk-in to the CMUN unlikely. CS

14 (U)D WelWBla appreciate your current analysis of the operational

climate and your views on the scenario outlined above.
