Dear Mr. Hoover:

I sincerely enjoyed my conversation with you on

Wednesday and wish to thank you for so generously

giving me your time.

I have not contacted any of the departments and

agencies whose cooperation we hope to enlist in

connection with the government-wide intelligence

unit other than your Bureau and the Central Intelli-

gence Agency. I think it would be helpful to have

your designee or designees named before making any

further contacts in order to have available your

advice with respect to which departments and agencies

should be included as well as those you deem unneces-

sary to include at this time.

In view of the fact that preliminarily, at least,

all we wish to do is discuss the subject very generally

or the purpose of assessing realistically the nature

and structure of the intelligence unit which we hope

to achieve, I am of the present opinion that the size

of the initial group should be somewhat limited.

would.be.grateful.for.your thoughts.on.this aspect of.

the problem as well as the substantive matters to be

resolved.

Re: Intelligence Evaluation Conmittee

It was indicated that they had been given the

assignment to expeditiously form a committee to have

access to all intelligence in the Government concerning

political terrorists in the United States in order to

render evaluations to Nessrs, Mitchell, Thrlichman, and

Haldeman who in turn would advise the President. These

evaluations would be for the purpose of determining, but

necessarily limited to, such things as the severity of

the problem under study regarding various terroristic

groups and to make recommendations as to various options

wich the President might take as to Federal response

concerning such problems. The responses which were

mentioned as exampies vere legislation, prosecution.

and other measures designed to alert and prevent acts

of terrorism.

It was apparent that both Dean and Mardian

had not given any real thought to mechanics of the

operation of this proposed committee as evidenced by

the fact that during the meeting Mardian called the

Attorney General direct in order to ascertain who would

pay Judge Sharp's salary and what office space he would

temporarily occupy. During the discussion with Attorney

General Mitchell, Mardian was told by the Attorney General

that Sharp would be funded by the Justice Department and

that the committee which was being formed was to be

considered as operating indet the Justice Department's

auspices; howevar, arrangements were being made for space

of possible publicity concerning this it was decided

by Attorney General Mitchell not to have White House

in the title and that it should operate under some

insignificant name as "Intelligence Evaluation

Cormittee" and in the event the press picked up any

thing about its operation the response from Justice

would be that Justice Sharp was working with the

Department's Inter-Division Information Unit.

Mro liardian further informed that he had

purposely kept the initial meeting of the committee

small but felt that it should be enlarged to include

other Government agencies which could make a con-

tribution and would have a definite interest in such

intelligence evaluations. In this regard, he stated

that the Atcorney General was calling Secretary of

Defense Laird, Secretary of the Treasury Kennedy, and Vice

Admisal Noel A. M. Gayler of the National Security Agency

in order for them to have representatives at the next

meeting

lardian stressed that the President wanted

this committee set up as soon as possible in order

to become functional and for that reason

he intended

to call a meeting early next week, at which time other

matters such as staffing and procedural plans would be

fornulated.

"It was observed that Mr. "Mardian as well as

others present will rely largely on the Bureau for the

intelligence product which vill be fumished to this

committee for evaluation.

In this regard, "Doherty of the

Justice Department commented that the FBI has furnished

No mention was made either as to the staffing

In this regard, Mr. Mardian stated that

following the initial meeting of the Committee on 12/3/70 he

reported back to Attorney General Mitchell at which time

MI. Mitchell impressed upon Hardian the keen personal interest

of the President on a top priority basis in having the cap-

tioned Committee established and functioning in very short

order to an extent whereby. the President can be assured of

getting.the.very best.intelligence available.from.alk. sources

within the Government in order to be in the best possible

position to decide action to be initiated and responses to

be made based upon such intelligence. Mardian stated that

either he (Mardian) or Attorney General Mitchell had spoken

personally with heads of the agencies represented on captioned

Committee and had been assured their full cooperation.

Me. Sgit Kugh Liuughu up the securicy factoi involved

and cautioned everyone present that the White House wanted to make

certain that everything is done to prevent any leakage to the

press that this particular Connittee is in existence. It was

reiterated that if any such inquiry is made-by the press,

justice

Sharp or Mr. Mardian would handle such by stating the Conmittee

was operating under the Justice Department in connection with the

operations of

the Inter-Divisional Information Unit (IDIU).

Mardian stated in fact this Committee has nothing whatever to

do wich the IDIU but this response is for security cover purposes

only.

As the first step in carrying out the mission of the

Committee, each agency present was requested to submit a blind

memorandun (classifica "For Eyes-Ontyl.) to Mr. Tardian by the

Potta cal terrorist sour tile ture to be deline d

by the Cormittee in evaluating intelligence coverage of these

groups such ass the extent of foreign influence in each of the

This afternoon Judge Korell Sharp, Chairman of

captioned Committee on which I serve as the Director's

representative, called and stated that he would like to

advise me of a rather small problem which he realizes is

not within the FBI's jurisdiction but wanted to make it a

matter of record in our files.

The Judge stated that his Committee has just moved

into space in Federal Office Building #7 on Jackson Place and

this afternoon, around 1 poM, a stranger very aggressively

came to the door and lurced io way in insisting upur voing

the telephone. He indicated his name was Dr. Sandler (phonetic)

who is interested in nuclear studies and he proceeded to make

about four telephone calls looking for a Colonel John Sheffie

(phonetic) tho was preparing some sort of study in which Sandler

was very much interested.

Judge Sharp's secretary, Mrs. Dohaney, was the only

person in the room when this stranger came in and she stated

that she was very much concerned about the security aspects

of the Committee in view of the fact that this individual.

seemed very inquisitive and nosey in trying to find out the

identity of the group currently occupying the space in that

particular room. It is noted that this space was previously

occupied by an executive study group which went by the name

of Melantic-Pacific Interocean. Study Group which is no longer

in existence. Mrs. Dohaney described Dr. Sandler as approxi-

mately 6'1" tall, age-middle 40's, darl: brom, longs curly

hair, slender build, long fingers, aquiline nose, white race,

and well dressed.

Judge Sharp stated that he realizes that there is

nothing the FBI can do about this and, in fact, the stranger

was probably just seeking the free use of a Goverment tele-

phone by forcing his way

into the office space. Nevertheless,

the Judge is very security conscious and did not want something

like this to pass without the Bureau's knowing about. it.

At the sane White House meeting, 1/21/71, Mardian

advised that Attorney General, Haldeman, and Enrichmai

were briefed concerning developments to date and recommended

that the committee oparate from a problem solving approach

and prepare necessary intelligence evaluation studies as

needed by the White House and operate within the framework

of agencies composing the committee without having an actual

working staff assembled within the committee itself. He said

he was promptly told by his superiors Mitchell, Ehrlichman,

and Haldeman) that the President definitely wanted the

committee physically staffed and operational in short order

so that intelligence evaluations needed by the White House

would be forthcoming.

Both Dean and Mardian stated they were

taken to task for not having the committee physically staffed

land "for taking such a long period of time in making the

committee functional. 940

It was indicated that the first item of importance,

to the White House after appropriate review by heads of

This intelligence evaluation working staff

togother with supporting cietical and stenographic personnel

is to be provided by agencies making up the captioned comnilice

and is to function in a semipermanent capacity.

At this point I was asked by Mr. John Dean as

sto the FBI's position in helping to staff this group at

which time he was informed of our own manpower and

budgetary problems and frankly told that consequently

(In this regard advice of the Director was followed

the Director's attention the most recent concern of the

President and his advisors as to the immediate physical

The purpose of this memorandum is to recommend

that attached letter be sent to Assistant Attorney General

set out Bureau's position relative to staffing captioned

At a meeting of the captioned committee held

ai i poil., 2/1/71, in the oftico of John w. Dean IIi,

Counsel to the President, Mr. Mardian at the outset of the

meeting said he had not yet received a letter from the

Bureau as to the request for assistance in staffing the

committee and desired to know if I had any information to

pass on in that regard.

It was pointed out to Mr. Mardian that I could

not understand why he had not received the letter since

our records indicate it was sent on 1/27/71 and the letter

itself was dated 1/27/71. Upon being asked if I recalled

the letter's contents, I informed him that the Director

had pointed out therein that, because of our own manpower

and budgetary problems, the FBI was unable to provide

personnel to staff the proposed committee and specifically

that the Bureau of the Budget and Management has cut us

100 Agents and: 70 clerks. Attached is a copy of my memo,

randum dated 1/26/71 which shows that the letter to Mardia

was sent on 1/27/71.

Mr. Mardian stated he could not understand why

he had not received the letter but was going to put tradecs 1971

out through the Justice Mail Room

to see if'it was misdelivered.

He stated that in the meantime he would be most appreciative

INTERNAL SECURITY - MISCELLANEOUS

The purpose of this memorandum is to advise of

the receipt of a draft copy of "proposed charter" of

restating Bureau's position that we cannot assist in its

In my memorandum of 2/2/71 you were advised

that a "proposed charter" was being prepared which would

ultimately be submitted to heads of all participating

agencies for approval. We are now in cerribe of a "araft"

of this paper which is attached. Each agency has been

furnished a copy for review and suggested changes

desired

at this point before the final paper is submitted.

An analysis of the draft shows that the "authority"

of the captioned committee is attributed to the Interdepart-

mental Action Plan for Civil Disturbance which was a plan

adopted by Departments of Defense and Justice in April, 1969;

for purpose of coordinating preparationsfor and responses to

serious civil disturbances whichmight thereafter occur within

the United States.

With respect to the stated mission and membership

of the committee, there appears: nothing. which would be

¡objectionable to us.

However;

the remainder of the draft, with exception

of a provision for "office space and facilities" which would

be provided by Justice, deals with "staff" and the staff's

taken in our letter dated 1/27/71 in which we stated that

"May 1971 Demonstrations."

The first estimate

is entitled

"May I9TI Demonstrations" and concludes that-it is

too early to predict the size of the demonstratiors scheduled

for Washington, D. C., the first week in May.

As previously

reported, these demonstrations are being sponsored by the

Peoples

Some Officials

the demonstrations, probably May 5.

The Committee's conclusions

state that the Coalition has publicly announced the intent to

block the flow of traffic into Washington, D. C., the Pentagon,

and the Central Intelligence Agency.

Observations

-T..

We agree that it is too early to predict the size

of the demonstrations scheduled for May 1971. We also agree

that vandalism may take place during the demonstrations.

It

should be noted, however, that during a meeting of the Coalition's

Continuation Committee last January, members of the Committee

voted against disrupting the flow of traffic into Washington, D. C..

to do this anasmuch as Davis has given considerable publicity

to this plan.

Observations

We concur with this conclusion. It should be noted

that antivar demonstrations have increased measurably since

Ithe military action began in Laos.

For example, on 2/10

¡demonstrations were held in over 60 cities throughout the

United States. It should be noted that in its background

intormation on this conclusion, the Committee mentions the

"National Student Movement! in connection with the recent

Student Mobilization Committee antiwar conference at Catholic

University.

The way this is written leaves the impression

that there

is an organized group called the National Student

(Movement which is, of course, inaccurate.

3. "Likelihood of Kidnaping of AnY High U,S. Govern-

ment Official in the inmediate future by Political Terrorists.

This cotirate, captioned as above,

a high government official must be considered a deiinite proba

bility by extremist elements.

Observations

We concur with

this conclusion. It should be noted

that the background material subnitted by the Committee

supporting this conclusion states that violence prone groups

such as the Black Panther Party and the Weatherman have endorsea

political kidnaping.

We do not have information that the

Weatherman has endorsed kidnapings although it has called for

RE: INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

The Committee staff is preparing guidelines which will be

issued to each of the agencies making up the Committee in

order to have individual draft estimates prepared. (Upon

receipt, the request will be analyzed and submitted for

approval prior to our undertaking preparation of estimate).

Mr. Mardian expressed his concern over the fact that

the staff of the Committee is not large enough to prepare the

intelligence estimates needed to carry out the mission of the

Committee.

In this regard he stated he is in receipt of a

letter from the Department of Defense indicating that since the

FBI is not furnishing personnel to the Committee's working

grOUp, Department of Defense also will be unable to furnish

personnel in the future.

Mr. Mardian stated that this leaves

the working staff composed merely of representatives from

the Internal Security Division of the Department, Secret

Service, National Security Agency and the Centrai Intelligence

Agency.

He expressed the hope that something could be done

in the near future to fully staff this group in view of the

obvious increased activity on the part of militant groups and

individuals in the country.

....

SUBJECT: INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

DATE:

3/11/71

By letter dated 3/10/71, attached, the Intelligenco

Evaluation Committee (IEC) furnished two estimates drawn up

by the committee.

The first concerns the demonstrations

scheduled to be held at lashington, D.C, 1/24/71 to 5/5/71.

The second is a Calendar of Events (demonstrations) going

through 5/5/71.

Bureau comments or approval of the estimates is

requested by 3/12/71.

Telephonic approval was requested.

The estimate concerning the pending demonstrations

at washingion concludes that it is ta carla no pecdagi ibe

size of these demonstrations. (This is an accurate conclusion

as planning for these

demonstrations is still taking place.)

It also concludes that the demonstration on 4/24/71 will

probably reduce participation in subsequent demonstrations

as participants will not remain in Vashington until 5/5/71.

(This is also a valid conclusion.

April 24 has been set for

the date of the massive demonstration by both the National

Peace Action Coalition and the People's Coalition for Peace

and Justice, the sponsors of it.)

It is also concluded that

these demonstrations will be similar to past major demon-

strations.

It points out that during the past demonstrations,

a small number of participants have engaged in vandalism and

other destructive acts.

It also points out that the People's

Coalition for Peace and Justice has indicated that nonviolent

civil disobedience will take place. (As of the date of the

estimate, 3/9/71, this: is a valid conclusion.

There Will'

undoubtedly, be civil disobedience and acts. of vandalism

auring these

e demonstrations.

It should be noted that these conclusions are

UBJECT: INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE (IEC)

The Director asked for our views on attached memorandum of

the same caption, 4/12/71, Mr. Cotter to Mr. Brennan, which concluded

that the Bureau should have no objection to "Estimate E-1, Revision 2,

April - May Demonstrations, April 5, 1971, "also attached, prepared by

the Intelligence Evaluation Committee.

I have read the entire estimate and find it a concise and

informative statement of what may be expected both at home and abroad

in connection with the forthcoming April and May demonstrations. The

information appears to be correct insofar as can be judged by that which

has previously come to my attention. It is true, as the Domestic

Intolligenes Divicion chserves, that the number of participants and the

extent of civil disobedience are still tentative, but that seems unavoidable

at this time because the organizing groups are still in the planning stage. .

INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEL

Director has approved assignment of two qualified,

Special Agents and one secretary to the permanent working

staff of the Intelligence Evaluation Committee (IEC) pursuant

to a request from the Attorney General.

Inspector George C. Moore discussed with the Executive

Director of the Committee today methods and standards of the

operation of the Committee staff. The staff reviews a voluminous

amount of intelligence data received from the intelligence

community, does research, and prepares estimates for dissemina-

tion to the White House and other high officials within the

Il Executive Branch. What the Committee needs are Bureau personnel

wino are well livined regarding extremist art paulas cross-the-

board in the domestic field, Bureau coverage and resources

regarding violent demonstrations ard agitation in antiwar and

racial fields, and especially personnel who have expertise in

analysis and

research.

It is felt that the following Agents would be idealy

suited to handle this assignment and would be well qualified not

only for Committee purposes but to protect the Bureau's best

interests: 1) Section Chief Richard D. Cotter of Research Section,

Donestic Intelligence Division; and 2) Supervisor Garnett I. Tunstall,

Racial Intelligence Section, Domestic Intelligence Division.

Memorandum to Mr. C. D. Brennan

RE: STAFF. SUPPORT - INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

a wealth of experience in research matters and his Section has

been coordinating the intelligence gathering functions with

respect to extremist groups. It is noted that staff members

from other agencies represented on the Committee are in grades

GS-15 to GS-17 and it is believed an individual of similar

stature should represent the Bureau. It is noted that Cotter

suffered a heart attack in September, 1970, and is currently

on limited duty. However, he has made a good recovery from

this coronary, is now working on a full-time basis, and there

lis no reason why he cannot handle this Committee.

Also, if the Director so desires, Cotter will be in a

position to assume the increasing administrative liaison fünctions

between the Committee staff and the Bureau, which would relieve

Inspector George C. Moore of these duties currently being

handled by him. Inspector More, of course, would still be the

Director's representative on the IC itself (distinguished from

the working staff).

The IC staff is located in the same building as

Domestic Intelligence Division and accordingly Section Chief

Cotter will be able to stay in close touch with the operations

of his section.

* **

With regard to Supervisor Tunstall, he has been an

Agent for some 24 years, including the last three years at the

Seat of Government in Racial Intelligence Section where he is

presently serving as GS-14.

Tunstall has a wealth of experience

in security and Intelligence work, especially in the all important

field of ractal activities, is extremely capable, and should

make an excellent. Bureau representative.ongthe. IfC staff.,and

Pursuant to the Attorney Gereral's request we will

also provide an experienced secretary to serve with the IEC:

SUBJECT: INTERNAL SECURITY - MISCELLANEOUS

DATE: July 15-1971.

To recommend that the attached letter and enclosures

be furnished to Mr. John F. Doherty, Executive Director of the EC.

As you have been previously advised by memorandum of

R. D. Cotter to C. D. Brennan, 6/24/71, same title, Mr. Doherty

requested information we have on the subject of "The

Interrelationship of Arab Terrorist Groups and U.S. Black

Militants." The IEC with the concurrence of the White House is

scheduling an intelligence estimate on that subject.

American black extremists have established a close

¿elaiionship with Arab terrurisi groups; much anti-Semitic ana

anti-Zionist propaganda has appeared in the black extremist press

and complete support of the Palestinian "liberation struggle" has

been expressed by black extremists in this country.

Two groups containing black extremists and/or subversives

have traveled to the Middle East in the past year. The groups

ostensibly were to observe the situation and return to the U.S.

to propagandize on behalf of the Arabs but both reportedly visited

Arab guerrilla camps and one group was trained in the use of

handguns, rifles, and explosives. One member of this latter group

claimed members of that group were expected to commit acts of

terrorism when they returned to this country. Others of the

group have denied receiving such instruction but members of this

group have engaged in firearms training upon their return to this

country. Both groups have engaged in propaganda efforts.on behalf

cat the Arabs.

No information has been received to date to indicate

that any members of the two groups who visited the Middle East

have engaged in terrorist activities in the U.S.

I represented the Bureau.

Mr. Mardian stated that he had just returned fom

of his visit with Mr. Nixon, he was charging the IC with a

new project; namely.

a comprehensive report on the United

States Government's treatment of classified and sensitive

information along with such corollary problems as how "Top

up our security procedures, and whether there is too much

classification of documents under our current system.

Mardian

noted that this study was triggered by the Ellsberg case but

he was not asking the Committee to review the Ellsberg investi

gation as such.

He said that President Nixon was most concerned

regarding. the Pentagon Papers incident and the serious situation

nated by supreme court decisions relating. to the crisperg.

Re: Intelligence Evaluation Committee (IEC)

Mardian reviewed briefly the various ongoing studies

which are already underway by other agencies relating to this

general matter. These include a study being made by Assistant

Attorney General Rehnquist regarding classification and de-

classification procedures (pursuant to National Security Council

"Directive 117 Of January, 1971); a Department of Detense damage

estimate dealing with the Ellsberg and related disclosures; a

Defense Department study on security management and clearances

at the Rand Corporation;

and a Defense Department review of

the origin anã development of the entire "McNamara Study" on

which the so-called Pentagon Papers were based.

Mardian said

that the result of all these studies would be funneled to the

IE on a continuing basis and that the committée would liave

access to any other information it might need from any component

of the Executive Branch.

Mardian also pointed out that several Congressional

investigations will be conducted concerning the Pentagon

Papers

and related developments. He said that one in particular, by

the House Armed Services Committee, will be a penetrative study

and will have the full cooperation of the Executive Branch.

He asked that this information be clesely held. Mardian said

that an exact definition of the objectives of the IEC in

connection with this study should be worked out by the Committee

Staff in the near future in line with the capabilities of the

Committee. He again stressed that anything the committee needs

from any agency will be made available, if necessary.

Re: Intelligence Evaluation Committee (IEC)

It was agreed that special attention should be

devoted to the possibilities of unauthorized disclosure

lof classified information being made through the dissem-

iination and handling of such data by non-Government

agencies especially private contractors or subcontractors

who are granted access to sensitive data in connection

with Government projects.

The IEC will focus particularly

on such contractors who deal in study projects and policy

matters such as the Rand Corporation and similar "think

tanks." As a matter of fact the starting point for the

IEC will be an examination of the Government's relation-

ship to Rand and a review of policies and practices of

Rand in handling classified information and granting

access to it. (In this connection IEC will obtain copies

of ongoing studies currently being conducted by Defense

Department.) From there the IEC study will branch out

to cover similar private organizations with access to

classified information, with the objective of recommend

ing specific measures to tighten security gaps and fore-

stall a recurrence of the Ellsberg fiasco.

For your information, a meeting of the working staff of the

was drawn up to define the specific areas into which the ICC will inquire.

It was decided that the principal dim of the IDC redori viu be io deveion

recommendations as to (1) whether dissemination of classified information

should be more restrictive than under current practices and (2) whether

additional steps are needed to insure the reliability and trustworthiness of

individuals who hold access.

The IEC study will concentrate on questions involving personnel

security and access rather than with matters relating to physical security

or administrative handling of files, mail, etc. It will show the great

complexity and magnitude of the problem of properly controling classified

information without resorting to undemocratic methods. The study will

focus on the probiems arising from the disclosure of classified data to

individuals and firms outside the Executive Branch under various industrial

and scientific contracts. We will particularly take a close look at the

Rand Corporation and other think! type groups..

The TEc also plans to cover in general terms problems arising

In summary, this report outlines the major problems

Recommendations include a conclusion that all

involving classified data and that such releases should

first be cleared by appropriate intelligence or security

personnel to assure that it is sanitized. Recommendation

was also made that contacts with news media should be

tightly controlled with clearly defined procedures and

In addition, a

recommendation was made that all contacts with news media

Memorandum R. D. Cotter to Mr. E. S. Miller

.Re: Intelligence Evaluation Committee (IEC)

should be undertaken by the agency involved. It has always

been the Bureau's position that the ultimate answer to

leaks lies in tight administrative control and internal

discipline within the various agencies.

The report also calls for improved security

training and orientation programs both within the Government

and private industries handling classified material and

for tougher security inspections. This report specifically

deplores the practices of some Government officials retaining

classified documents as "private papers" and urges that an

executive directive be issued prohibiting this practice.

From the above, it can be seen that in large

measure this report reflects views long held by the

Director and recommends practices which already are fol-

llowed by the FBI.. It is believed this report is. an excellent

• statement of the problem of unauthorized disclosures and

that it contains a number of hard-hitting and effective

recommendations to improve the situation. The IEC staff

is to take up this report at a meeting on 10/26/71. At

that time, member agencies will submit any suggested

corrections or modifications.

If you approve, Bureau representatives will offer

no objection to this report at the 10/26 meeting. You will

_This request was prompted by a news-

letter emphasizing the need for worker-student alliances

which was

prepared by the Revolutionary Marxist Caucus,

an adjunct of the Spartacist League. To a great extent,

of course, this study will depend upon information fur-

nished by the Bureau.

In line with the above: Bureau will furnish

background data regarding attempts of the militant left,

both black and white, to exert influence and draw strength

from the American Labor Movement.

This data, available

in Bureau files, will include a brief history of the

communist movement, both Chinese and Soviet oriented, as

related to the role of labor in the movement with special

emphasis placed upon plans and strategies of New Left and

black extremist groups.

A brief summary will be included regarding the

various splinter groups and their plans to infiltrate and

use the labor movement in furthering their various causes.

The study will be mainlt concerned with current activities.

When competed, the above intormation will be

prepared by the Bureau's representatives.on IEG and sub-

We should also include any

might be information regarding the reliability or capabilities

of friendly foreign intelligence services with which the

Bureau deals.

All sections of the. Domestic Intelligence Division

"INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE (IEC)

INTERNAL SECURITY - MISCELLANEOUS

By memorandum, R. D. Cotter to Mr. E. S. Miller, dated 1l/5/7i, the

Laboratory was requested to submit observations on any national security hazards

posed by "phone phreaking," the use of telephone lines by private individuals who

are familiar with various signalling systems employed by the telephone company.

Reference memorandum was precipitated by an article in the October, 1971, issue

of Esquire magazine by Ron Rosenbaum, captioned "Secrets of the Little Blue Box."

The term 'blue box" is applied to a tone signalling device which

generates tones normally used by toll operators and telephone switching equipment to

initiate and dial long distance calls within the telephone direct distance dialing network

(DDD). The Laboratory has been familiar with "blue boxes" for many years. A

num b maamined is the Laboratory.

"Phone phreaks" are individuals who are either technically competent io build a

"blue box" or have obtained one from some source and who amuse themselves by

using the "blue box"' to make toll-free calls within the DDD network. Some "blue

boxes"' are known to have been used by gamblers to make toll-free calls that

normally produce no record of the call to telephone company billing equipment. In

a recent Title III court-authorized wiretap in Las Vegas, interceptions were made oi

a "blue box"' so used.

The Laboratory is of the opinion that 'blue boxes" do not pose any

substantial national security threat to telephone communications. A "blue box"' could

be used to initiate a single long distance call thereby tying up a single calling path,

but it is not felt likely that a sufficient number of "blue boxes" could be operated

independently to tie up enough single channels to materially effect the toll network.

-.-

The Bell System and most independent telephone companies do not provide

-dial accessible busy verification codes to allow dialing into a call in progress, which

could be a simple method of wiretapping.

Various defense telephone networks which are accessible by DDD have

an operator intercept such calls and handle dialing within the network.

While the Laboratory does not have information on many computer

systems accessible by telephone dialing, such systems as NCIC, which is the center

of a dedicated network, appear to have adequate safe guards to prevent unauthorized

use or manipulation of data stored in; the computer.

While it is felt that the "blue box" and "phone phreaking" do not at this

ime pose any national security treai vasea on availabie iniormation, it wouid Dencove

the major telephone companies to continually review their vast switching systems as to

susceptibility to unauthorized access to insure that new features do not inadvertently

open a door which could effect essential telephone communications.

develop into violence despite announced peaceful intentions.

San Diego has been relatively free of demonstrations in the

past, but the Republican Convention will serve as a magnet,

Bureau representatives, is summitted for you approvai.

The attached draft, which was prepared almost

draft shows that although extensive effort has been made

along this line its effect on the U.S. labor movement is,

of the Communist Party, USA, in the United States showing

the full extent of its infiltration into labor unions

through World War II and then its expulsion from the move-

3-13-72, concerning possible disruptions at the Democratic

National Convention to be held in Miami, Florida, in July,

11972. In summary, this report shows interest in the

Convention by national dissident groups appears to have

increased during the past month. The Youth International

Party is planning various typos of demonstralions and activ-

a culmination in Miami during the Democratic Convention.

The Congress of African Peoples had a meeting in February,

1972, and discussed plans for disruption on the Convention,

National leaders of this organization and those of other

dissident groups have expressed an interest in disrupting

the Convention. Very little planning for such disruptions

by these dissident groups is being done on a local level.

The last paragraphs of this report under the

caption of "Law Enforcement Planning" show that the Bureau

and the United States Secret Service are participating

with state and local agencies in preparations for possible

assist in carrying out our responsibilities.

An example

would be the organization and composition of the Soviet

intelligence services together with information regarding

Soviet intelligence capabilities, overall objectives,

specific targets, modus operandi, communications, security

practices, and similar information which would be of value

in our counterin telligence operations.

We should also

include any items which, although not relating to a hostile

or communist country, could have a bearing on our activities.

An example might be information regarding the reliability

or capabilities of friendly foreign intelligence services

with which the Bureau deals.

All Sections of the Domestic Intelligence Division

are being canvassed, and an overall list of this Division's

requirements will be prepared and submitted for approval.

In addition to the needs

Re: Intelligence Evaluation Committee

On the local scene, the San. Diego Convention

Coalition is beset with serious internal problems, and

the Community Congress of San Diego has announced

estab

lishment of a group to provide for medical, legal, housing

and other aid for the demonstrators. Unsubstantiated

information indicates dissident elements have formed

battle plans for rioting and accelerated violence,

including bombing; however, these reports appear to be

only grandiose schemes of individuals who do not have

sufficient backing to accomplish substantial disturbances.

on the international scene, the San Diego

Convention Coalition has received a letter of support from

the Vietnam Committee for Solidarity with the American

People, a quasi-official organization of the Worth

Vietnamese Government.

General law enforcement task force continues to

hold meetings, but in view of possible change of location,

San Diego Police Department is holding further plans for

• the Convention in abeyance.

Mr. Bernard A. Wells, Executive Director, IEC, has

advised that the White House has expressed an interest in

being advised of the plans and the disturbance potential of

demonstrations scheduled for May 27 for Washington, D. C.

• These demonstrations are in protest to the U. S.

support of European colonialist rule in Southern Africa,

Including present situation in Rhodesia. They are sponsored

composed of pan-African organizations and the Congress of

African Pcoples. Individuals involved in these demonscrations

are expected to range from the most militant to high-level

civil rights leaders. They are expected to draw support from

all levels of the black community and could easily involve

violence.

In view of the violence potential of the above

demonstrations, the IEC, in accordance with the white House

request, is obtaining all available information concerning

the plans for these demonstrations from the member agencies

Of IEC. Information developed by the Bureau will be furnished

to IEC by the Bureau's representatives and will be included in

the overall reports submitted to the White House.

ACTION:

If approved, Bureau representatives will furnish

desired information to IEC as developed.

Attached is a copy of the latest IEC report dated

5-12-72, regarding potential disruptions at the Democratic

National Convention which is scheduled for Miami Beach,

Florida, in July, 1972. This report attempts to show the

disruptive influences that exist, both on à laviorai and

local level, and to predict their influence on the upcoming

Convention.

Potential for disturbances at the Democratic

National Convention have increased with the formation of the

, Antiwar Union (AU) under the leadership of Rennie Davis and

other nationally known protest leaders. The report goes on

to observe that the Miami anti-Castro Cubans present a pos-

sible disruptive influence should participants at the Conven-

tion propose easing of relations with Castro's Cuba. The two

local groups, Florida Peoples Platform Coalition (FPPC) and

the Miami Snowplow Company, continue to plan for services and

activities during the Democratic National Convention.

The White House has requested an evaluation be

prepared by IC setting out the plans and disturbance poten-

tial of the May 27, 1972, African Liberation Day demonstra-

tion in Washington, D. C. By memorandum dated 5-8-72, approval

was received for Bureau representatives on the IEC to furnish

the Committee information concerning this demonstration.

Attached is the initial IFC report in which the

úisiuvace Futontiün ds the demonstration is rated ao high

in view of the extremist individuals and organizations involved

in its planning. The Committee feels that although the

demonstration may not reach the attendance figure of 10,000

as predicted by its leaders, there will be sufficient numbers

to present a potential for violence.

Led by such individuals as Leroi Jones; Howard Fullein

and extremist leaders of the Black Panther Party and the

Republic of New Africa, and focused against such targets as

the South African, Rhodesian and Portuguese Embassies, the

individual participants could easily be incited to commit acts

of destruction, as well as confrontation with law enforcement

officers.

An additional evaluation will be submitted prior

to the demonstration when a check of transportation sources d

will give a more realistic indication as to the number of mine

participants coming from outside the City.

Beach, Florida, in

August, 1972. This report points out that organizations are

beginning to form which are focusing their attention on the

Miami Beach site for the Republican Convention.

Leaders of

groups formerly planning demonstrations at the san Diego

site are now joining with East Coast groups and are in the

process of forming the Miami Conventions Coalition (MCC) to

prepare for protest at both national political conventions.

Attached report observes that a recent meeting in

his militant Anti-war Union to peaceful demonstrations.

The report concludes that it is currently too early to esti-

SUBJECT: STAFF SUPPORT -- INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

During May, 1971, former Attorney General Mitchell requested

that Bureau assign two qualified Agents and one secretary to permanent

working staff of Intelligence Evaluation Committee (IEC). This

Committee is composed of representatives of Justice, Bureau, Central

Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, Secret Service, Defense '

¡ Department and Treasury Department and it prepares reports and

estimates,

primarily regarding possible civil disorders for the

White House and the Attorney General.

Ta rasnonse to Attorney General Mitchell's request, two Agents

were assigned full time to IEC in May, 1971 (Section Chief R. D. Cotter

and Supervisor G. T. Tunstall). Cotter has recently been appointed to

: the newly created post of Bureau's Document Classification Officer to

carry out implementation of the new classification and declassification

procedures.

It is believed SA Tunstall can at this time handle the Bureau's

representation to IEC alone; however, we should advise the Attorney

•' General of our recall of one representative from IEC.

in this connection.

The report concludes that the number of protesters

protest leaders. Massive civil disobedience and disruptions

are not expected at the Democratic National Convention.

Some potential for violence does exist in view of the presence

of violence-prone protesters and local antagonism against the

The attached report concludes that while protest

leaders have predicted vast numbers of protesters, it is

hard to

conceive that more than 10,000 could be assembled

for the Republican National Convention. Without support of

civil rights groups, protesters will have extreme difficulty

obtaining sufficient persons to cause serious disruptions.

Rumors of counterdemonstrations by groups opposing protesters

and the presence of violence-prone leaders, however, precludes

•a prediction of little potentiäl for violence

attract large numbers of participants and will, in all

likelihood, be peaceful and nonviolent.

The greatest

potential for violence lies with the Cuban refugee groups

and their actions against protesters.

This report shows the Miami Conventions

planning for protest activities. The Peoples Coalition for

Peace and Justice leaders have drawn up a schedule for

activities beginning August 18 and continuing through August

23, with the presentation of the "people's demands" to

President Nixon.

The report indicates that the Youth

International Party does not plan activities, but the Zippies

program includes disruptive actions.

The Vietnam Veterans

Republican National Convention to participate in protest

activitjes.

The report concludes that while protest are

that as many as

10,000 individuals can be assembled for pro-

The potential for violence, however. is

rated higher than during the Democratic National Convention

due mainly to the inherent antagonism between the protesters

VICTE INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

INTERNAL SECURITY - MISCELLANEOUS

(IEC

IEC,

formed in late 1970 at the specific instructions

of President Nixon, is composed of representatives of the

various U. S. intelligence agencies.

The Committee, although

housed in the Department of Justice

space under the direction

of an executive director who is a special assistant to the

Attorney General, is directly responsible to The White House.

Its purpose is to review and evaluate all data collected by

the

U. S. intelligence community and to submit results of such

evaluations to The White House.

Participating agencies,

including the Bureau, are represented on the working staff.

On March 21, 1972, the President's Foreign Intelligence

Advisory Board (FIAB), in furtherance of the President's

announced reorganization of U.S. intelligence eltorts requested

IEC to obtain from the various agencies and furnish to FIAB an

overall list of the intelligence requirements of the U. S.

intelligence community which could be collected domestically.

FIAB requested such list in connection with their study of

ways and means to improve the quality of intelligence within

the limitations of recent budgetary and other resource con

straints imposed upnn the nverallU. S. intelligence effort.

V Attached is a rough drait of a proad, comprenensive

list of intelligence requirements compiled by the lEC stait

from contributions of member agencies in accordance with the

FIAB reguest.

## Page 191

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

Re: Intelligence Evaluation Committee (IEC)

This report, which will be disseminated only to The

White House with copies to the IC member agencies, contains

observations which coincide with the already formulated

attitude of the FIAB which is interested in and nurturing

broader across-the-board intelligence collection efforts.

The

thrust being

put forth is human

collection versus mechanical

collection.

In other words it is being realized that the

U.S. has been putting too many eggs in one basket at the

expense of what is thought to be by many in the intelligence

community a better and more economical means of intelligence

The President in his plans for reorganization of

intelligence efforts does not desire a cut in intelligence

gathering but rather the replacement of costly collection

methods with more economical and thorough means.

If this theory is sustained and the President

endorses it, the FBI will be the logical agency to handle the

job because of our present responsibility of intelligence

collecting within the United States.

If this occurs and

since our duties would be substantially broadened, additional

manpower and resources will be needed.

ACTION:

If approved, the bureau's representative on the IEC

staff will concur with these requirements for submission to

the FIAB.

ADDENDUM BY ASSISTANT DIRECTOR E. S. MILLER 10/4/72 ISM:aeb

I can endorse the observations made by Nr. Tunstall in

this memorandum since ve are currently. in the process: of preparing..

answers to 36 questions submitted by the President's foreign

for the use of this organization by terrorists. It is felt

INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

"New York Times'" today carries lead story captioned

White House Ring Reportedly Spied on Radicals in '70."

This article, written by Seymour Hersh, deals chiefly with

history and activities of the Intelligence Evaluation Committee

(IEC), an interagency group which was formed at the direction

of the White House in late 1970 and which has been furnishing

general intelligence reports to the White House since that date.

The Committee is made up of representatives of the FBI, Central

Intelligence Agency (CIA), National Security Agency (NSA), Department

of Defense, Secret Service, Treasury Department and Justice Department.

While the "Times" article contains elements of fact, it presents

a badly distorted version of the objectives and operations of the lEC.

This memorandum summarizes the "Times" allegations and sets

out the actual facts for the information of the Acting Director.

"New York Times" Charges

According to Hersh article, unidentified sources have reported

that the IEC was established by the White House in 1970 to collect

and evaluate information about radical and antiwar groups. The

article claims that the IEC is operated "clandestinely" out of the

Justice Department and has reported directly to John Dean, former

White House Counsel, and John Caulfield, the former White House

staff member who allegedly was involved in White House eltorts to cover

up the Watergate affair. Reportedly, the IC was created on orders

of John Thrlichman and egil Krogh, Ma an ade to Fhrlichman, has

been connected with tec at various limes

Memorandum to Mi. Felt

Re: INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

intelligence operation was needed during the national political

conventions last summer. Supposedly, government investigators

are now seeking to determine whether some of IEC's classified

reports may have been used by Justice Department agencies and

the White House to justify "undercover and double-agent activities"

against groups opposed to the Nixon Administration, including the

Democrats.

The "Times" article referred to testimony by James McCord

to the effect that officials of the Internal Security Division of Justice

Department had supplied the Committee for the Reelection of

the President with intelligence reports on radical activities for

possible political use. McCord claimed to have visited the "analysis

and evaluation section" of Internal Security Division to receive

some material. In reply to a question, Mecard exprassed the

beliet that he had obtained this intormation trom the Intelligence

Evaluation Committee.

The "Times" has identified Bernard Wells, a former FBI Agent,

as head of IEC and claims that IEC members include officials of

FBI, CIA, NSA and "various other police and official units." IEC

was reportedly set up to meet the grave threat posed by radical and

antiwar groups. The article notes that in response to this threat

the FBI and Justice Department had developed an'elaborate system

of undercover agents," although it did not specifically charge that

IEC had engaged in this activity.

Facts Concerning IEC

Our files disclose the following information concerning

formation and activities of IES: On 11/25/70, Assistant Attornay,

General Robert Mardian of the Internal Security Division, personally

visited the Director. "Mardian advised that he had beer commissioned

by president Nixon to estaolish an inter-departmental intelligence

unit for the purpose of pooling intelligence information from various

agencies concerning violent demonstrations or other efforts to overthrow

the government Mardian indicated this group had the support of san

Re: INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

Presidential Assistant Ehrlichman and that it would operate

from the Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House.

He said the Committee would be headed by Morell Sharp, former

judge from the State of Washington, and he expressed the hope

that all member agencies, including the FBI, would appoint top

men to represent them in the group. Mr. Hoover assured

Mardian of the FBI's co-operation in this endeavor. On 12/1/70,

Section Chief G. C. Moore of the Domestic Intelligence Division,

was named as the FBI's representative. In December, 1970, and

during the early months of 1971, several meetings of the group

were held in the office of John Dean.

They were attended by

representatives of Justice, CIA, FBI, NSA, Secret Service,

Defense Department, Treasury Department, Mr. Dean, Mr. Krogh,

Mir. Mardian and Judge Sharp. At the initial meeting, the group

adopted the name intelligence Evaluation Commitice and iviardian

explained that the group had been assigned the mission of pooling

information regarding political terrorism in the U.S. According

to Mardian, the Committee would report to Ehrlichman and H. R.

Haldeman at the White House as well as Attorney General Mitchell

and they, in turn, would advise the President so that he could weigh

what federal action was necessary. During one meeting Krogh

cautioned those present that the White House wanted to make

certain there were no leaks to the press regarding the IC.

As a matter of fact, during late January, 1971, it was announced

that Judge Sharp was dropping out as head of IC in view of the fact

that his presence in the Executive Office Building had caused several

inquiries by newspaper men. At the same time it was decided to

move the headquarters of lEC from the Executive Office Bullding

i baete minter a get direction to Departmen the ta.

John Doherty.

One of the early problems facing the lEc was the question

of staffing. Mr. Hoover initially declined a request from Mardian

to provide staff support but on 5/17/7, Attorney General Mitchelle.

personally requested that the FBi provide two Agents and one secretary

Re: INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

for the permanent working staff of IEC. Mr. Hoover acceded

to this request and two Domestic Intelligence Division Supervisors

R. D. Cotter and G. T. Tunstall) were designated along with

a secretary. FBI staff support for the IEC has continued to the

present time except beginning in July, 1972, only one Agent Supervisor

has been assigned to the Committee.

Other agencies have also supplied staff support for IEC. For

example, for the first year and a half Department of Defense

furnished a professional analyst and during the summer of 1971,

NSA provided a security specialist on a full-time basis. All member

agencies have designated representatives who attend the regular

weekly staff meetings of IEC and who furnish assistance on a part-time

basis.

Organization and Activities of IEC

IEC is headed by an Executive Director, former FBI Agent Wells, and

a Deputy, another former FBI Agent (James McGrath). The IEC has two

full-time secretaries including one from the FBI. During roughly the

first six months of IEC's existence, its efforts were devoted primarily

to preparing periodic intelligence estimates with reference to antiwar

activities, especially the May, 1971, activities at Washington, D. C.

Thereafter, the IEC has given its attention to and prepared reports

concerning a variety of domestic intelligence matters of likely interest

to the President, most of them revolving around possible civil disorders.

For instance, the IEC has prepared several reports dealing with the

potential of racial violence, another dealing with prison riots and

throughout the spring and summer of 1972, the Committee prepared

a series of intelligence summaries dealing with the potentia. for

violence at. the two major political conventions held in Miami Beach.

Memorandum to Mr. Felt

Re: INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

To our knowledge, James McCord has never had any

connection with the IEC. It appears that McCord's reference

to the "analysis and evaluation section"' may have denoted a

unit which did exist in the Internal Security Division of the

Department, namely the Analysis and Evaluation Unit, which was

under Mardian's direction.

At no time has the IEC engaged in any activities of an

operational nature or made any recommendations for operational

activities. It has concerned itself entirely with preparing summary-

type estimates based on the information contributed by member

agencies. While its reports have been classified, they have generally

speaking not involved particularly sensitive information and they

have all related to cubversive or criminal activities of one type

or another of likely interest to the White House. It is hard to visualize

how any political use could have been made of any IEC's reports.

In any case, FBI representatives on the IC have no knowledge

whatever of any political ramifications in the activities of this group.

One particular project undertaken by the IEC should be mentioned.

During July, 1971, Assistant Attorney General Mardian called a

meeting of the IEC and explained that he had just returned from

seeing the President in San Clemente, and that as a result of his

visit with Mr. Nixon, he was charging the IEC with the preparation

of a comprehensive report regarding the handling of classified and

sensitive information. Mardian noted this study had been prompted

by the Ellsberg case but said that the IEC would in no way concern itself

With the Allsberg matter from an investigative or prosecutive stand-

point." 'Mardian said the President wanted the IC to conduct an

overall review of all factors relating to classification and protection.

of national defense information and to make appropriate recommendations

for Mr. Nixon's consideration.

Shortly thereafter, during the last week of July, 1971, IEC's

Executive Director Doherty reported to the IEC staff that a White

House staft member had been appointed: to work with:IEC.in conducting

its inquiries with regard to the handling of classified information.

The latter was identified as Gordon Liddy, who has recently received

considerable notoriety in connection with the Ellsberg case.

5

Memorandum to Mr. Felt

Re: INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

Liddy did meet on one occasion with the IEC staff in

August, 1971, at which time he discussed the project in very

general terms. This was the only contact Liddy had with the

IEC, either personally or in writing, to the knowledge of the

FBI representatives.

The IEC published a special report in

November, 1971, entitled "The Unauthorized Disclosure of

Classified Information" which completed this particular

assignment. This study alluded to the Ellsberg situation, but

only as a case in point. It dealt primarily with existing federal

procedures for the handling of classified data and set out nine

specitied recommendations to tighten these procedures.

House statf member had been appointed to work with ISC In conducting

Its Inquirios with regard to the haudling of classified information.

The latter was identuled as Gorcion Liddy, who has recently received

considerable notoriety in cornection with the Ellsberg case.

Lilday did meet on one occasion with the IEC staff in

August, 1971, at which time he discussed the project in very

general terms. This was the only contact Liddy had with the

IEd, either personally of in writing, to the knowledge of the

FBI representatives.

The IEC published a special report in

November, 19T1, entitled "The Unauthorized Disclosure of

Classifica Information" which completed this particular

assignment. This study alluded to the Elisherg situation, but

only as a case in point. I dealt primarily with existing federal

procedures for the handling of classitied data and set out nine

oM : E. S. Miller

BJECT: INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE (IEC)

An article in today's "Evening Star and Daily News"

under the heading "Senators Seeking Radical Ties Data"

reports information from the Associated Press regarding the

alleged connections of the lEC with political espionage-type

activities. The article presents a totally misleading picture

of the IEC.

Specifically, the "Star" piece claims that unidentified

sources close to the Watergate investigation have reported that the

IEC was established in December, 1970, after FBl Director Hoover

had objecied lo a Toy Secrei While House plan devised Ar improve

U.S. intelligence operations. Reportedly, the IEC was established

ostensibly to improve co-ordination among U.S. intelligence agencies

and prepare estimates of domestic intelligence, however, it soon

became "a cover for a secret police operation. " The article further

charged that the IEC had used its access to government agencies to

intercept mail, tap telephones, review income tax returns and plant

informers. One source was quoted "They (the IEC) were using

the national-security plan that Hoover objected to. That was the

blue print. "

A United Pres International story released early today cites

similar allegations carried by the New York "Daily News. " In addition,

this story charges that a break-in at the Chilean Embassy in May, 1972,

was part of the plan for domestic espionage (apparently referring to

the plan devised by an interdepartmental ad hoc intelligence committee

in June, 1970)s

These news stories are way off base. As reported in my prior

memorandum 5/21/73 entitled "Intelligence Evaluation Committee,"

the IEC has at no time been operational

nor made any recommendations

for operational activity. It has had no connection whatever with any

type of espionage activities or with the mail interception, wire tapping,

informant activities or the monitoring of income tax returns.

It is entirely separate and distinct from the temporary interdepartmental

committee on intelligence (Ad Hoc) which prepared an extensive

report on internal security matters in June, 1970.

The burglary at the Chilean Embassy in May, 1972, had

no connection with any government operations, clandestine

or otherwise, so far as we know. This burglary was reported

to the Metropolitan Police Department which conducted an inquiry

showing that four or five radios and one electric razor were stolen.

No national security angles developed and no FBI investigation was

ever conducted.

nicEtions

The Seattle Office has submitted an airtel

enclosing a letterhead memorandum, both dated 5/30/73 and

attached, setting forth some "concerns" from U. S. District Judge

Morrell E. Sharp, Western District of Washington, Seattle, as

expressed with regard to the captioned Committee, which is now

receiving a substantial amount of publicity in the press.

Judge Sharp is a former Supreme Court Justice of the

State of Washington who originally was to have headed the IEC as :

its operating shairman and did; in fact, attend several of the

early meetings. I attended the meetings of this Committee as the

Bureau's representative.

In the incoming letterhead memorandum Judge Sharp, among

other things, related that "while the initial purposes of the group

appear to be quite legitimate there was some discussion about soine

clandestine operations that may be engaged in and at this point it

became evident to him that he did not want to have any part of it

and furthermore he did not want to operate in Washington without

his real purpose being known to his contacts in the State of

Washington, namely Senator Jackson and Senator Magnuson."

Although Judge Sharp might have been aware of some

"clandestine" operations discussed. in his presence by Mr. Robert..

Mardian of the Department of Justice (prime mover in establishing

the rec)/or on the paxt.of others. that i was, not la party to,.Xam

not aware of any such discussions directly.or indirectly.

Re: Intelligence Evaluation Committee (IEC)

would be as well as the overall purpose of the Committee. (I might

add that very few present seemed to have any conception either as

to what form the Committee should take, including Mardian, who

evidently had been given the assignment to establish a committee

which would coordinate intelligence and furnish evaluations to the

President.)

A considerable amount of concern was voiced by both

Mardian and John W. Dean III (who represented The White House) at

these early meetings as to the necessity for keeping the functions

of this unit away from the press and prevent The White House from

being identified with the group.

Judge Sharp was cautioned during

each meeting very carefully in this regard as to how to handle

this matter in the event of a press inquiry.

In this regard there is attached one copy each of

memoranda dated 12/3/7U and 12i16/7U which set out details relative

to White House concern as to the necessity for providing a

security cover for the IEC. You will note that Page 2 of the

12/3/70 memorandum shows that Mardian was instructed by the

Attorney General to have Judge Sharp's salary paid by the Justice

Department and the Committee would be considered to be operating

under the Justice Department's auspices and arrangements were being

made for space in Federal Office Building Number Seven near The

White House.

It was also indicated that original thinking

was to

have the Committee go by the name of "The White House Intelligence

Evaluation Committee" but because of possible publicity it was

decided by the Attorney General not to have The White House in the

title but have the Committee operate under some insignificant name

such as the "Intelligence Evaluation Committee.!! The purpose of

this would be to respond to the press better in the event of an

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

Re: Intelligence Evaluation Committee (IEC)

the Committee was operating under the Justice Department in

connection with the operation of the Interdivision Information

Unit (IDIU). Mr. Mardian stated, in fact, that the IEC had nothing

whatever to do with the IDIU but

the response would be for security

cover purposes only.

Our files show Judge Sharp attended three meetings of

the IEC all during the initial stages of its development -- first

on 12/3/70 followed by meetings on 12/16/70 and 1/11/71. He did

not attend the fourth scheduled meeting on 1/25/71. At that

meeting Mr. Mardian explained the absence of Judge Sharp by stating

there had been several inquiries made by acquaintances of Judge

Sharp in Congress which caused the Attorney General and White House

concern that it would be difficult to maintain appropriate security

concerning the Committee's work with Judge Sharp as its head and

in an office located so near The White House (Federal Office Building

Number seven). Mardian stated that accordingly, at a meering neid

1/21/71 at The White House, attended by Mardian, John W. Dean III,

the Attorney General, H. R. Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman, it was

decided to have the Committee function in space occupied by the

Internal Security Division of the Department, 315 Ninth Street,

Northwest, and that Judge Sharp should be removed from the Committee

and assigned to other consultant duties with the Justice Department.

A copy of the 1/26/71 memorandum is also attached.

In addition to the above, it is my own personal recollection

that Judge Sharp was very much concerned about the nature of his

assignment in that he frequently made trips to the State of

Washington and friends would ask him what type of work he was doing.

He said that he was never really able to give them a satisfactory

answer and this bothered him-somewhat.

OBSERVATIONS:

Unless Judge Sharp is aware of "clandestine" plans of IEC

that were not. discussed in my présence, it would appear that the

above secrecy set-up involving a "cover" for security purposes

could have been, reason enough tot the Judge to want out

the State of Washington.

SUBJECT

DECLASSIFICATION MATTER

On 2/19/74, Mr. Kevin Maroney, Deputy Assistant Attorney

General of the Criminal Division, contacted me and inquired whether

two prior FBI letters to the Department can now be declassified. The

items in question are our letters-to the Internal Security Division dated

1/27/71 and 2/3/71 both entitled "Intelligence Evaluation Committee,

Internal Security - Miscellaneous. " These letters both deal with the

issue of whether or not the FBI would provide personnel to staff the

Committee. They were classified on the grounds that disclosure of the

existence of the Intelligence Evaluation Committee could damage

national defense.

At the time these communications were prepared (1971) the White

House had indicated a desire to keep the existence of the Intelligence

Evaluation Committee secret. However, during the past year there has

been considerable publicity revealing no only the existence of IC but

details of those operations. Hence, there is no longer any grounds for

retaining the classification of these communications. I advised Mr. Maroney

• that both letters could be declassified and appropriate steps have been

taken to so mark them.

Maroney desired declassification of these items in connection with

certain Departmental communications he is furnishing to the Senate

Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights.

INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

REQUEST OF GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE

ON BEHALF OF CONGRESSMAN ROYBAL

By letter 7/18/74, Mx. Daniel E Stanton, Assistant Director:

General-Accounting Office (GAO), has advised that GAO is conducting

inquiry regarding former Intelligence Evaluation Committee (IEC) on

behalf of Congressman Edward E anybal. Stanton specifically has

requested the following data (I) names of the FBI personnel, including

secretaries, who participated in activities of IEC either as members of

Committee or working staff and periods they served; (2) estimate of

funds expended by FBI in support of IEC and the appropriations from

which such payments were made.

Based on request of former Assistant Attorney General Mardian

we designated a Special Agent to represent Bureau on IEC. on inception

of this group in December, 1970, until it was dissolved in June, 1973.

Other agencies represented on IEC included Justice Department, Central

Intelligence Agency, Defense Department, Secret Service, Treasury

Department and National Security Agency. With regard to members of the

working staff, Mr. Hoover initially resisted a request by Mardian for

us to supply FBI personnel for this purpose. However, in May, 1971,

former Attorney General Mitchell requested in writing that we furnish

two Agents and a secretary as members of the IEC working staff.

Accordingly, beginning 6/1/71, we did staff the IEC working group. Two

SAs were named full time to this assignment initially, however, beginning

6/1/72 this was reduced to one Agent. One secretary was assigned to

the IEC working group continuously from 6/1/71 -. 6/1/73 when IEC was

disbanded:

Based on estimate prepared by the Administrative Division

approximately. $1l6, 900 was required to,cover FBI salary costs. No,

special appropriation was sought to cover this amount and it was handied

out of, the resular Bureau appropriation.

Mr. W. R. Wannall

INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE (IEC)

SUNJECT REQUEST OF GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE ON

BEHALF OF CONGRESSMAN ROYBAL

Reference is made to memorandum from A. B. Fulton to me, 7/26/74,

in captioned matter. You requested a memorandum be prepared outlining the

background and activities of the IEC.

On 11/25/70 Assistant Attorney General Robert Mardian of the Internal

Security Division contacted Director J. Edgar Hoover. He advised that he had

been commissioned by President Nixon to establish an Interdepartmental

Intelligence Unit for the purpose of pooling intelligence information from various

agencies regarding violent demonstrations or other efforts to overthrow the

Government. Mardian said the group had the support of Presidential Assistant

Ehrlichman,

that it would operate from the Executive Office Building, and

would be headed by Morell Sharp, a former judge. Mr. Hoover assured Mardian

of the FBI's cooperation and on 12/1/70 Section Chief G. C. Moore of the

Intelligence Division was named as the FBI representative.

In December, 1970, and during the early months of 197, several

meetings of the group were held in the office of John Dean. They were attended

by representatives of Justice, Central Intelligence Agency, FBI, National

Security Agency (NSA), Secret Service, Defense Department, Treasury

Department, Mr. Dean, Mr. Egil Krogh, Mr. Mardian, and Judge Sharp. At

the initial meeting, the group adopted the name "Intelligence Evaluation

Committee" and Mardian explained that it had been assigned the primary mission

of pooling inforination concerning political terrorism in the U. S. According to

Mardian, the Committee would report to Ehrlichman and H. R. Haldeman at

The White House as well as Attorney General Mitchell, and they, in turn, would

advise the President so that he could weigh what action was necessary. During

one meeting Krogh cautioned that The White House wanted no leaks to the press

regarding the IC.

Memorandum to Mr. J. B. Adams

Re: Intelligence Evaluation Committee (IEC)

Request of General Accounting Office on

Behalf of Congressman Roybal

In late January, 1971, it was announced that Sharp was dropping out as

head of IEC since his presence in the Executive Office Building had prompted press

(inquiries. At the same time, it was decided to move IEC from the Executive Office

Building to the Internal Security Division of the Department and to place it under

the direction of a Departmental official, John Doherty.

One of the early problems facing the IC was the question of staffing.

Mr. Hoover initially declined a request from Mardian to provide staff support.

However, on 5/17/71 Attorney General Mitchell requested in writing that the Bureau

provide two Agents and one secretary for the IC working staff. Mr. Hoover

[acceded to this requesi and two Intelligence Division supervisors (P. D. Cotter and

G. T. Tunstall) were designated with a secretary. FBI staff support continued

until dissolution of IEC on 6/11/73 (although beginning in July, 1972, one Agent was

recalled).

Other agencies also supplied limited support for IEC. During the first

year and one-half, the Defense Department provided a professional analyst and

during Summer of 1971 NSA furnished a full-time security specialist. Other agencies

also designated representatives who attended weekly staff meetings and furnished

assistance on a part-time basis.

Following retirement of Doherty in September, 1971, IC was headed by

a former FBI Agent, Bernard F. Wells, with another ex-Agent, James McGraph,

(serving as his deputy.

During the first part of 1971, IEC efforts were devoted primarily to

preparing periodic intelligence estimates on antiwar activities and demonstrations

and during 1972 a large part of the IC's efforts was directed to preparing summaries

of possible demonstrations at the Democratic and Republican National Conventions.

However,

LEC was preparing a variety of other reports of possible interest to the

"President, most of them revolving around possible civil disturbances. This

included reports dealing with the potential of racial violence and another dealing

with prison disturbances.

One project undertaken by IC deserves special mention. During July, 1971,

Mardian called a special meeting of IEC and explained he had just returned from

meeting the President in San Clemente. He said that the IEC was commissioned to?

prepare a comprehensive report concerning the handling of classified information.

Memorandum to Mr. J. B. Adams

Re: Intelligence Evaluation Committee (IEC)

Request of General Accounting Office on

Behalf of Congressman Roybal

Mardian indicated this had been prompted by the Ellsberg case but said IC would

not concern itself with the Ellsberg matter from an investigative or prosecutive

standpoint. He said the President wanted IEC to conduct an overall review of factors

relating to the protection of national defense information.

Shortly thereafter, Mr. Doherty reported that a White House staft member,

Gordon Liddy, had been named to work with IEC in handling this project.

Liddy

met on one occasion, in August, 1971, with the IC staff, and discussed the project

in general terms. In November, 1971, IC published a special repori entitled "The

Unauthorized Disclosure of Classified Information," which completed this assignment.

Normally, IC projects originated with John Dean, although there were some

exceptions such as a report on terrorist activities requested by the President's

Cabinet Committee on Terrorism. IC estimates were furnished to Dean and the

heads o each member agency, inciuding ine Attorney General.

There has been some speculation that the IC was actually an outgrowth of

the so-called "Huston Plan' which had been briefly approved by President Nixon in

Ithe Summer of 1970. This plan called for the lifting of various investigative

restraints on U. S. intelligence agencies (relating to covert mail coverage, wire-

taps,

surreptitious entry, etc.) and also urged the formation of an interagency

intelligence group to keep The White House advised regarding matters of domestic

intelligence interest. This plan was scotched by The White House based on the

strenuous objections of FBI Director Hoover as well as Attorney General Mitchell.

However, a memorandum prepared by John Dean in September, 1970, revived the

idea of an interagency intelligence group which would not only provide evaluations of

domestic intelligence for the President but which would also be operational in nature.

Circumstances indicate this memorandum was a forerunner to establishment of IEC.

i ast should be stressed, however, that at no time did liC engage in any

activities of an operational nature nor did it make any recommendations Ior

operational activity. It concerned itself wholly with preparing summary-type

estimates based on data contributed by member agencies. FBI representatives on

the IEC have no knowledge whatever of any political ramifications in the activities

'of this group.
