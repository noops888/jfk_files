Mr. Scott Breckinridge

Principal Coordinator/HSCA

Office of Legislative Counsel

Central Intelligence Agency

Washington, D. C. 20505

Dear Mr. Breckinridge:

is PH '78

June 1978 and 8 June 1978 that the Central Intelligence Agency

make available for review by Committee staff members all files

and index references to the following individuals:

Luisa Calderon

AMMUG/ 1

During the week of 2 July 1978, various files concerning

the above-named individuals were made available for review to

Charles Berk of this Committee.

Mr. Berk has now reviewed

Luisa Calderon's 201 file and AMMUG/l's Office of Security file,

Office of Personnel file, and Volumes One and TWo of AMMUG/l's

201 file covering the period 25 April 1964 - October 1965.

After a careful review of these materials, it has been

determined that CIA-originated reports of 5 May 1964, 6 May

1964, 7 May 1964, 8 May 1964, 11 May 1964, and 19 June 1964,

based upon AMMUG/l's knowledge, are absent from the

materials provided to MI. Berk.

Furthermore, neither notes not

memoranda upon which these reports may have been based are

present in the files.

The content of these reports, notes and

memoranda are of substantial interest to the Committee.

also been determined that AMMUG/1 material now stored by the

CIA at its Warrenton, Virginia facility has not been made fully

available to the Committee.

This omission came to Mr. Berk's

attention inadvertently during a conversation that he had with

Chris Hopkins.

Mr. Berk's review of a 1 May 1961 CIA-originated dis-

patch also indicates that at least twenty-two reels of tape

COMMINTRE SEASITIVE

recorded interviews conducted by CIA representatives with

AMMUG/1 are absent from the files provided thus far to the

Committee.

These twenty-two reels of tape recordings were

listed as

attachments to the above-referenced CIA dispatch.

The actual interviews from which the tape recordings were

generated were conducted shortly after AMMUG/l's defection

from the Cuban Intelligence Service. Furthermore, three trans-

scripts of tape recorded CIA interviews with AMMUG/1 are absent

from the files thus far provided to the Committee.

These

transcripts were listed as attachments to a CIA-originated re-

port of

30 April 1964.

The actual interviews upon which the

transcripts are based were also conducted shortly after AMMUG/1's

defection from the Cuban Intelligence Service.

In the case of Luisa Calderon's CIA files, CIA informa-

tional reports, cables, and dispatches referenced to in her 201

a to infer 201

file have been

found to be absent from-that file.

In addition,

a CIA transcript of a telephone conversation in which she par-

ticipated on

the day of President Kennedy's assassination is

absent from her 201 file.

The absence of these reports, notes,

memoranda, and other

material from the AMMUG/1 files and the Luisa Calderon files

reviewed to date may be an indication that other related

materials have not yet been made available to the Committee for,

review.

The Committee therefore reiterates its request that all

files and index

references on Luisa Calderon and AMMUG/1, in-

cluding but not limited to production files, operational files,

soft files and subject files, be made available to the Commit-

tee as soon as

possible.

The Committee further requests that AMMUG/1 CIA case

officers Harold Swenson, and Barney Hidalgo,. FNU Langosch, and

Daniel Flores be made immediately available for personal inter-

views with Committee staff members.

As some of the

matters discussed herein may be of a

sensitive or classified nature, this communication may require

appropriate classification.

Thank you for your continued cooperation.

Sincerely,

Robert

Chief Counsel
