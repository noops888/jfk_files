EDITORIAL COMMENTS

General -- The paper begins by emphasizing that it did

uncover any evidence that the Kennedy

assassination

was the result of a conspiracy, but that they did dis-

cover evidence that various intelligence agencies were

not forthcoming with the Warren Commission.

The paper

then goes on to leave the impression that the JFk assas-

sination was the result of a conspiracy by Castro in re-

taliation for our AMLASH operation.

The entire paper is highly repetitive, and begins

a summary,

followed by a slightly more detailed

version, followed by

a more detailed version,

The paper relies heavily on the testimony of

current/former Agency employees,

with specific emphasis.

on the individual within CI Staff who stäted that he would

have altered the manner in which he conducted the investi-

gation of the Kennedy assassination if he had known of the

AMLASH operation.

The paper hammers away

again and again

that we were meeting with AMLASH when JFK was killed.

As a saving

factor, the paper is far

more derogatory

to the FBI

is to the Agency,

and in short asks why

no one in the Executive branch thought to bring the AMLASH

and other Castro operations to the attention of the Warren

CommissIon,

while admitting that the Agency did an excel-

lent job of reporting and

assembling information on Oswald

and in immediately reporting our information to the FBI and

the Warren Commission.

Throughout Report -- The paper spends a great deal of time re-

hashing the story that Oswald

received money from the Cubans

in Mexico City, while at the same time clearly demonstrating

that this allegation was a fabrication.

Since it was

fabrication,

and this does not seem to be of question

to the SSC, Warren Commission, FBI, or ClA, there seems

either

to

be little justification for such repetitive treatment of

Pages 10ó and 107 -- This section criticizes the Agency for

not having interrogated AMLASH concerning

the Kennedy assas-

ination,

in the context that both we and

the FBI should have

begun extensive interviews with our various Cuban sources to

determine if Castro was

involved.

Pages 113 and 114 -- Deals with a lead developed concerning.

a Cuban/American who mysteriously left Mexico City on a twin

engine aircraft for Havana shortly before (after ?) the

assassination. The paper criticizes us for not thoroughly

tollowing up on this lead, despite the fact that we immediately

turned the lead over to the FBI to investigaie turther.

Pages 126 and 127 -- After having spent some time explaining

the Agency's and the FBI's mistakes

not informing the

Warren Commission about plots

to assassinate Castro, the re-

port finally points out that with respect to the "underworld"

plots, Robert Kennedy, Allen Dulles, and many other senior

officials were already aware of these plots.

then states

"there would have been no clear reason to connect

these underworld plots to the President's assassination"

Page 128 then goes on to explain that the AMLASH

operation

since it was made clear to AMLASH

that the CIA and the U.S. Government approved of his plans

assassinate Castro.

FACTUAL OBJECTIONS

Page 12 -- States that "Hoover

and other senior officials

first learned

of plots

to assassinate Castro in July 1964".

NOTE: While this is clearly incorrect, Mr. Johnston

indicated that the above

sentence should read that

the officials first learned of the "AMLASH" operation

in July 1964.

Page 55 -- paragraph three -- Concerning an Agency cable

outlining

an unknown passenger in the cockpit of an air-

craft to Havana, the following

sentence appears:

"The

cable was received in Mexico

City since it may be fourd

in the station's files".

sentence is apparently in-

complete,

and does

make sense as

it is presently written.

Page 56 and 57 -- Discusses the 8 December 1963 cable to

JMIVAVE to halt all operations pending a high level/Cuban

policy review.

In this regard, the paper flatly states

that one of the operations

to be halted was the delivery

of the rifles and telescopic sites in connection with

I don't believe that

the cable, nor other related

documents, specify which operations were to be halted.

Page 120 -- In discussing the various Cuban exile groups,

and the interest in these groups by

the military, FBI, and

CIA, the paper

does not make it clear that the Agency did not

have any operational interest in either SNFE'or Alpha 66.

"Oswald contacted

a known KGB agent" with the

Soviet Embassy in Mexico.

that Oswald contacted the Vice Consul at the

Soviet Embassy

in Mexico City, to the best of

our knowledge it was for the purpose of

a visa for the Soviet Union.

The fact

Vice Consul happened to be a KGB officer

complicates the matter but

there is no evidence

that Oswald knew this Soviet was KGB.

Therefore,

recommend this sentence be modified accordingly.
