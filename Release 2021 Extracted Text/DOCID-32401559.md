Dear Walt:

This letter will confirm verbal requests made by Mr. Dwyer

of the Senate Select Committee staff to Mr. Dan Nieschur re-

garding materials pertaining to the assassination of President

Kennedy.

1: The Senate Select Committee requests a listing of all Mexico

City Station personnel for the period of September through

MA December 1963.

The Committee requests this list on an access

basis only,.

.to be retained at the CIA for use by the Committee

staff.

2. The Senate Select Committee requests clarification on what

documents were filed in the Oswald 201 as of November 22, 1963.

Both Mx. Hartman and Mr. Wall, CI Staff, have stated there were

five documents in the file:

patches (ES Dispatch #806 dated May 5, 1961 and FS Dispatch #317

dated December 12,

1961); one Office of Naval Intelligence memor-

andum (May 26, 1962 from H. T. Hadenberg) ; and two FBI Reports.

Mx. Hartman stated the FBI Reports were reports of SA John Fain

dated August 30, 1962 and July 3, 1961. Mr. Wall stated the

FBI Reports were an October 31, 1963 Report of SA Milton Kaack

and a May 12, 1960 Report of SA John Fain.

(a) Cable traffic from JMWAVE Station to Headquarters fol-

lowing the President"s assassination reveals that JMVAVE's file

contained information on Lee Harvey Oswald.

For example, WAVE 8049

(IN 66782), November 22, 1963, states that AMSPELL files

(Cub an

LA

Student Directorate) of

JMWAVE have background information on

Oswald. The Senate Select Committee requests access to Cuban

Student Directorate files of JMWAVE that contain information on

Oswald.

(b)

The piesence of information on Oswald in AMSPELL, files

Of IMAVE suggests the possibility that JWAVE files on other

Cuban exile groups might contain information on Oswald.

The

Senate Select Committee would like to determine if JMVAVE Station

was instructed by Headquarters to review its files for informa-

tion on Oswald and if JMIlAVE files on Cuban groups contain any

information about Oswald. The Senate Select Cormittee requests

access to JIVAVE files on Cuban groups that contain such informa-

tion:
