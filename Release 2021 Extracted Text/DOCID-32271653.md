House Select Committee staffers Edwin Juan Lopez

and Harold Leap traveled to Mexico City on August 7, 1978.

The staff members were met by David T. Patton at the Mexican

airport at 10:15 P.M. Mr. Patton then checked the staffers

into room 1754, already chosen, at the Maria Isabel Hotel in

Mexico City. Mr. Patton told Committee staffers that Larry

Steinfield wished to see us at 8:30 A.M. the following morning.

On Tuesday, August 8, 1978, Committee staffers met

with Larry Sternfield, CIA Chief of Station in Mexico City.

He informed the staffers that the two individuals the Committee

wishes to interview, Danny Flores, AKA Luis Aparicio and

Ramon Alvarez Ducant, were ready.

At 9:30 A.M., August 8, 1978, Committee staff members

• interviewed Danny Flores. (See write-up of Danny Flores

interview.) The interview ended at approximately 10:15 A.M.

Committee staff members returned to Mr. Sternfield's

office, MI. Steinfield stated that it appeared that the

Mexicans had only located two witnesses for the Committee,

Oscar Contreras Lartigue and Noe W. Palomares. He asked who

the staff members wished to speak. to. Committee staff members

explained that they would at some time like to interview

Lichant I, Licookie I, LiHuff I, Litamil 7 and Litamil 9. Mr.

mittee on Assassinations had already asked the Mexicans to

locate them.

Mr. Sternfield stated that the HSCA's interview with

Ramon Alvarez Durant was considered "highly sensitive". He

In one room, Ramon Alvarez Durant would sit, Committee staff

members would sit in a second room and two CIA personnel

officers would insure that the equipment worked properly in

a third room. Mr. Steinfield then phoned Mr. Niles Gooding,

who had been sent to the Mexico City Station from Headquarters

to arrange the procedures. Mr. Gooding explained that in

1977 Stansfield Turner had created a new position at Head-

quarters.

He explained that his position, which he never

fully explained though asked, was created to insure that

important sensitive meetings were within the guidelines set.

Mr. Gooding stated that the Central Intelligence Agency had

been under greater Congressional scrutiny the past two years.

Mr. Stansfield Turner, wishing to show the Agency's good

faith, had allow the Army to lend them a retired officer to

act as liaison at sensitive interviews. Mr. Gooding then ex-

plained that we would be escorted by two CIA personnel to

our interview with Ramon Alvarez Durant.

interviewed Ramon Alvarez Durant. (See Ramon Alvarez Durant

Captain Fernandez Ventura Gutierrez. His secretary explained

that Mr. Ventura was not in the office, but that she would

have him call us when he returned. At 6:30 P.M., since Mr.

Ventura had not yet returned the staffers call, they again

called his office. His secretary apologized for Mr. Ventura

and explained that he had not yet returned to the office and

but was rejected every time. In 1972, Ms. Odio married a

Communist painter, Rudolfo Sanabria Gonzalez and moved to Rio

Mexican officials that Mr. Alberue had left town hurriedly

on Monday, August 7, 1978. Mr. Martinez, wishing to know

when he returned, had placed a piece of scotch tape on the

bottom right edge of his door.

Mr. Martinez explained that

he checked it every four hours and would notify us if Alberue

returned before we left.

Manuel Calvillo did not live at Cuanhtemoc 877-5 as

the Committee had stated. Mr. Martinez spoke to the landlady.

met with Dr. Jesus Yanez, Agent Ciprianio Martinez Novoa,

Capitan Florentino Ventura Gutierrez and Attorney General

Licensiado Dr.

Baeza at 11:00 A.M. The same

information listed for the 11:00 A.M., August 9, 1978,

meeting was reviewed. Manuel Calvillo's "pen-name" was given

to the Mexicans who stated that they would check it with the

landlady.

Committee staffers returned to their hotel room with

Agent Ciprianio Martinez Novoa after the meeting. Agent

Martinez attempted in vain to telephone Oscar Contreras

Lartigue to inform him of our visit. At 3:30 P.M., Agent

Martinez finally reached Mr. Contreras' child who informed him

that Mr. Contreras was not in Tampico. He had traveled to

Mexico City for a Paxfido Republicano Institucional convention.

When Agent Martinez asked the child if he knew where his

father was staying in Mexico, he responded that he did not.

Agent Martinez explained to the child that he would call at a

later time to speak to his mother.

Agent Martinez telephoned Noe W. Palomares at 4:00 ₽.M.

staff members interviewed Noe W. Palomares.

(See Noe W.

Palomares interview write-up.)

After the interview Agent Martinez returned to the

Maria Isabel Hotel with Committee staff members. He attempted

to reach Mrs. Contreras at Tampico twice with no luck. At 9:45

P.M., he finally contacted her.

Mrs. Contreras told Agent

Martinez that Mr. Oscar Contreras had told her that he would

try to get a room at either the Hotel Regis or Hotel San

Francisco. Mrs. Contreras explained that since there were a

few conventions scheduled in Mexico City that weekend she

could not assure that he would be at either. Mrs. Contreras

told Agent Martinez that she would notify him if her husband

should call.

Mr. Martinez called both hotels and inquired whether

Oscar Contreras Lartigue was registered. He was not registered

at either; they were completely booked-up.

Mr. Martinez attempted to reach Sylvia

Tirado Bazan

at her home to ask her whether she would be willing to travel

to Washington for a hearing date and to ask whether she knew

where Mr. Ernesto Lehfeld Miller could be located. She was

not in.

Agent Martinez explained that he would go to the hotel

where the Partido Republicano Institucional was holding its

convention early the following morning; after which he would

meet the staff members at 9:30 A.M. at their hotel room.

Committee staffers at their hotel room and explained that he

was unable to locate Mr. Contreras Lartigue at the convention.

Mr. Martinez then left to check on Mr. Alberue Suoto and Sylvia

Tirado Bazan.

At 12:30 P.M., August 11, 1978, Agent Martinez returned

to the Committee staff members' hotel room. He telephoned

Mrs. Contreras

at Tampico who stated that her husband had not

telephoned her since she had last spoken to Agent Martinez.

At 1:50 P.M., another agent, Honorio Escondon telephoned Agent

Martinez at

the Committee staffers' hotel room to inform him

that Luis Alberue Suoto must be back in town because the scotch

tape was no longer in place. At

1:55 P.M., Agent Martinez

telephoned Luis Alberue Suoto. Alberue denied that he had

worked at the Cuban Embassy in the Sixties, stated that he knew

nothing about the assassination and declined the Committee

staff members' request to interview him.

At 2:00 P.M., August 11, 1978, Agent Martinez telephoned

Sylvia Duran. Agent Martinez then gave the telephone to

Committee staffer Lopez. Mr. Lopez asked Mrs. Duran whether

she would be willing to testify sometime in September at the

Committee hearings in Washington; she answered affirmatively.

She stated that September 13th, 14th and 15th would not be

"good days" because the Mexican Revolution celebration would

be taking place and she was a planner and participant. When

Mr. Lopez asked Ms. Tirado if she knew Mr. Ernesto Lehfeld

Miller's phone number, she stated that she did not. She stated

tht if we telephoned her ex-husband Horatio at either 516-0398

or 515-8621, he

would be able to help us.

At 2:15 P.M., Committee staffer Lopez telephoned

Horatio Duran, who gave him Ernesto Lehfeld Miller's office

phone number, 548-4839. At 2:20 P.M., Lopez telephones Mr.

Miller and arranged a meeting for 9:00 P.M. that evening.

At 2:30 P.M., Agent Martinez telephoned Capitan

Ventura to report on his progress. When Martinez told Ventura

that he had located Alberue, Ventura asked him if he was

alone. When Agent Martinez lied and stated that he was alone,

Ventura told him that he should under no circumstances allow

us to interview Alberue. When Agent Martinez completed his

phone call, he said "I don't understand why nobody wants you

to talk to him. "

At 9:-0 P.M., August 11, 1978, Committee staffers

interviewed Ernesto Lehfeld Miller. (See Ernesto Lehfeld

Miller interview write-up.)

At 11:15 A.M., August 12, 1978, Committee staffer

Lopez called Luis Alberue Suoto at his home. When Mr. Lopez

identified himself, Mr. Alberue immediately stated that he

knew nothing. He further stated that he never worked for the

Cuban Embassy. When Lopez explained to him that employees at

the Cuban Embassy had stated that he had been employed there,

Mr. Suoto hung up. Mr. Alberbue's voice quivered throughout

the short talk.

At 11:45 A.M., Sylvia Tirado called Lopez and stated

that she had thought

about traveling to Washington, all night.

She said that she had seen a report in the papers where Azcue

was not Lee Harvey Oswald. She

stated that Azcue had only seen

him once while she had seen him "at least three times"

• When

Lopez said, "At least three times?", Mrs. Duran said, "Three

times, you know?"

She further stated that if she testified

in Washington and the Committee concluded that she was lying

she would be crucified when she returned to Mexico. Mr.

Lopez reassured her and explained that he would send her a

long

letter explaining procedures when he returned to Washington.

At 12:05 P.M., Agent Martinez met the Committee staff

members at the airport. He stated that Contreras

and Calvillo

had not been found. The Committee staffers gave Martinez a

list of questions to ask Oscar Contreras Lartigue. Agent

Martinez stated that he would mail the results of the interview

to Lopez at the Committee offices in Washington.

The Committee staff members left Mexico City at

1:55 P.M. and arrived at Washington's Dulles Airport at 10:35

P. M.
