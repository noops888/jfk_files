MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Frank FIORINI

• 1..

Subject is an American citizen who has been active

in Cuban affairs for many years and who is one of the original

supporters of Castro.

He first came to the attention of the

Agency in October, 1958, when he was arrested by the Batista

Intelligence Service on

suspicion that he was acting as a

courier for the 26th of July Movement between Miami and

Santiago de Cuba.

2. In late 1958, he was active In obtaining supplies

for faber and Castro at which time he was associated with

Pedro DIAZ Lanz in these activities. After Castro came to

power in early 1959, subject was reportedly working with

Raul Castro and engaged in the training of militia in the

Santiago de Cuba area. Later in 1959, subject had a falling

out with the Castro regime and by late 1959 was engaged in

anti-Castzo activities.

During 1960 he was frequently

reported engaged in various anti-Castro activities and once

more was associated with Pedro DIAZ, Lanz in these activities.

3. Subject is a qualified pilot and most of his

activities have revolved around the purchasing of and

planning for the use of various type aircraft in anti-

Castro activities.

He reportedly proposed to anyone who

would listen to him that he had small groups of men who

would follow him and he has proposed many times to land

on Cuban soil with these alleged groups of men.

For the past several years, subject has been

Involved with one Alex RORKE (American freelancer engaged

in anti-Castro activities) in a variety of proposals of

action against the Castro regime.

reported to C.I.A. that RORKE and FIORINI were attempting

to obtain funds for an anti-Castro program involving 5,200

men which would operate fron off-shore islands, possibly

the British Isles.

The progran again Involved aircraft and

PT boats.

During November and December of 1961, Malone

reported that RORKE and FIORINI were working with ex-Ambassador

Sergio ROJAS and had flown two leaflet operations against

Cuba, the last being approximately 12 December 1961.

these flights FIORINI flew one aircraft while RORKE was a

passenger on the other. (On the 12 December flight, one

aircraft crashed at sea and the wife of the American pilot

was causing a fuss due to reported U. S. Government

involvement in the activity.)

6. By late December, 1961, RORKE and FIORINI

appeared to have fallen out with ROJAS and Malone reported

that Pedro DIAZ Lanz (who by this time was also associated

with RORKE/FIORINI/ROJAS combination) appeared to have

become ROJAS' military advisor with FIORINI shunted aside.

About this time, when ROJAS had to withdraw from active

anti-Castro activities due to his funds running out, it

appears that FIORINI, Pedro DIAZ Lanz and RORKE formed

their own group and attempted to obtain funds in a variety

of ways. In May, 1962, Malone reported that FIORINI and

DIAZ Lanz, along with 27 other people had departed Florida

in an unnaned boat around the middle of April. They were

to land on one of the Cuban Cays, return to Florida to

pick up RORKE whereupon all would return to Cuban waters

and commence harassment operations against the Castro

regime.

Intercepted the FIORINI/DIAZ Lanz expedition while

enroute to Cuba and gently "urged" them to return to

Florida, which they did.

Since May this group has been

raising funds for their antí-Castro activities and
