Subject: W.L. OLTHANS (10 June 1925)

On 29 December 1971 OLTHANS invited the Cultural Attache of the

Russian Embassy KUZNETSOV for an evening in his house. The invit

ation was

also for some other members of the Russian Representation.

At the same

time OLTMANS was to invite some six inportant journalists

KUZNETSOV should ask OPALEV and IZWEKOV to come along with him.

The date agreed on originally was 11 January 1972. It then was

changed twice. When 14 January also wasn't suitable, it was agreed

on 7 January to make the date for 18 January 1972 at 20.00 hrs.

From the invitation it could only be infered that OLTMANS wanted

to offer his guests an opportunity for an informal discussion.

About the background of the present good relations of OLTNANS with

the Soviet Representation in The Netherlands, section B is able to

report the following:

(This information comes from vulnerable source - OPPERBA1S.)

1. In September 1970 OLTMANS says with some surprise that he sudden-

ly received an invitation to a party at the Russian Embassy.

He thinks it crazy; he doesn't belong to that club at all. But

1212 90 80

his thinking is along the lines of those people.

2. In October 1970 OLTMANS appears to be interested in an interview

with KOSYGIN's son-in-law GVISHIANI who allegedly was connected

with American-Russian discussions about forming a mutual "think-

ing factory".

Presumably this had some connection with the so called Club of

Rome in which GVISHIANI plays a role.

Remark: GVISHIANI is chairman of the

state committee for science

and technology and is suspected to be a highly placed

Intelligence Officer.

3. Begining March 1970 OLTMANS contacted the Press Attache OPALEV

from the

Russian Embassy; OLTMANS would still like to have an

interview with GVISHIANI.

It would be a filmed interview in which OLTMANS would cooperate

with the NOS. (IV).

In this period OPALEV's cooperation does not yet seem very

extensive.

4. Thanks to the cooperation of Aurelio PECCEI, chairman of the

Club of Rome, OLTMANS at the end of April 1971 succeeded in get-

ting in contact with GVISHIANI in Paris.

Also present at

this discussion was the

former member of the Russi

Embassy FEDEROVSKY, now chief of protocol of the state committee

for science and technology.

2.

At this opportunity GVISHIANI immediately invited OLTMANS for a

visit to. Moscow.

FEDEROVSKY waS

instructed to inform the Russian Embassy in The

jague about it.

GISHIANI who at the same time is chairman of the commission for

environment administration in the Soviet Union, asked OLTHANS to

the stig time

make a film at the same time about the environment administration

in the Soviet Union to support the international environment

conference

to be held this year.

5..

Begining May it becomes clear that since OLTMANS' discussion with

GVISHIANI, OPALEV's attitude towards OLTMANS has greatly changed.

OPALEV is now all willingness.

In May OLTMANS makes his film with GVISHIANI and receives an inv-

itation to come to the Soviet Union for the second half of August

andress Augus

and

the whole of September, where he could filn ten scientific

institutes.

GVISHIANI

told OLTMANS that he had complete trust in him.

6. In June 1971 OLIMANS

again contacted GISHIANI, this time in

Vienna, where there was a meeting of the Club of Rome.

7. Begining October 1971 OLTMANS again saw GISHIANI in Paris, where,

among other things he spoke to him about his visit to The Netherlar

in the second week of October.

OLTMANS did his best to oblige

GVISHIANI while visiting The Neth-

erlands by trying to establish business relations for him (for

instance with Philips).

"recerveil

8. In November 1971 OLIMANS, frOm

the Russian state television an

offer for a five year contract to make exclusive films in the

Soviet Union.

This offer was

scientific institutes in the Soviet Union.

On 17 November OLTMANS allegedly discussed this business further

with GVISHIANI in Geneva.

9. On 23 January 1972 OLTMANS will make another visit to Moscow to

discuss making the above mentioned films without the participation

of the NOS. At this opportunity OLTMANS will leave behind a memo

about LUNS in connection with OLTMINS' present agitation against

the Secretary-General of NATO.

OLTMANS wants to prevent LUNS getting any future opportunity to

visit Moscow.

10: Referring to the meeting in OLTMANS' house on 18 January 1972 it

can be reported that on 17 January 1972 OLIMANS stated that he

is again seeking reaction from the Russians who will visit him on

18 January; their reaction in connection with OLTMANS' request

the general prosecutor of the

High Council to bring action

against LUNS.

3.

In the morning on 18 January OLIMANS also stated that KUZNETSOV

said

that OLTMANS' action against LUNS will not succeed because

the "bosses" stand behind LUNS.

It is not clear when KUZNITSOV said this to OLININS, but it is

known that OLTMANS recently attended a meeting where a number

of Russians vere present.

(Possibly the meeting of the Association "Nederland-USSR"

with

the delegation from

"USSR-Nederland" on 14 January 1972.)

11.

On 19 January 1972 it was reported that HOrLAND lone of the guest

invited 'to the

evening in OLTMANS' house) called before his

arrival and asked whether he could bring a friend.

Afterwards this friend appeared to be Peter ZONNEVELD from De

Telegraaf.

OLTMANS said that

at the press conference which he (OLTMANS)

will give on 20 January 1972 several guests, Milo ANSTADI, Rob

KOPUIT and Jaap JANSEN will defend OLTMANS against the attack on

him in

"De Telegraaf" of this morning.

19 January 1972.
