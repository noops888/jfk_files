Status of Operation Mongoose

Report to Policy Group, 11 April 1962

By Brig. Gen. Lansdale

We are in the fourth week of the Special Group's revised plan

for Operation Mongoose. There are fifteen more weeks of Phase I,

which is essentially intelligence collection with low U.S. visibility.

Intelligence collection is reaching a point where the U.S. is

starting to get a firmer fix in detail on order of battle, the political

structure, the economy, and internal resistan

groups. Our Center

in Miami processed 1, 309 refugees lagin

reek

The refugee debrief-

ing center in Madridis now in operation

Means for debriefing

visitors to Cuba, at a number of freevos

id ports, have been estab-

lished. MI. McCone can provide details.

-

In the more dramatic sector, the infiltration of teams into Cuba,

CIA reports one team in place, a second team on the way, and two

more ready for next week. The pace was adjusted to ensure that

really competent personnel go in. It should be noted that this is

only one sector of the collection effort inside Cuba. Again, I defer

to MI. Mc Cone for details.

The Department of State has no oojecton to the

release or declassification of this document in full

under the provisions of the JFK Assassination Records

Collection Act of 1992 (PL102-526)

CIA has identified seven resistance organizations inside Cuba,

as realistically potential. A hard assessment, up close, is still to

come. Under the revised plan for Operation Mongoose, proposals

for supplying arms and equipment to these groups will be submitted

to the Special Group for decision, ad hoc. No proposals have been

.. rocoived.
