Masferrer claimed that his Haiti invasion

plot was approved by the U. S. Government (varying

agency).

While the CIA approval claim was untrue,

Agency concern, at the time, centered around the

possibility of unfavorable publicity and the

compromise of sources and methods if the Agency

date and place

DI bIrth o October 1933, Santa Clara, Cuba.

Nieves was

on 4 February 1966 in

Florida.

It was developed that he was a Cuban

national who had been arrested, tried, and

sentenced to 20 years in Cuba for allegedly

being involved in an anti-Castio plot. He was

released in March 1965 after serving approxi-

mately. I6 months of his sentence and went to

Spain briefly where he was of interest to the

Madrid Station. In August 1965 he entered the

United States and in November 1965 was contacted

by Directorate of Operations (DDO) representatives.

From November 1965 until approximately January

1966 he was of operational interest to the DDo.

It is noted that the DDO maintains a

201 File (201-788521) regarding Subject and it

is believed that the Office of Security would

have to defer any decision regarding the release

3. During-review of CAIN's Security file, I noted a message

regarding him from Mexico City, on 25 April 1962, which mentioned

"Willard ANDREWS, reputable American businessman in Mexico,"

who obviously had had contact of some kind with CAIN, as well as with

a CLA representative in Mexico to whom ANDREWS had commented that

CAIN claims to have been with OSS during W. W. II (Acopy of this memo.

randum is attached). In answer to this message which requested traces

on CAIN, Headquarters, in furnishing limited information obtained regard-

ing him, advised that neither his claimed employment by OSS, nor a claira

he made to have worked with Task Force W, couid be substantiated. The

Station was advised that he did have (or had had) a legitimate detective

laboratory in Chicago.

4. With reference to Willard ANDREWS, Security indices contain

no recard. I believe the individual referred to is Wyllys ANDREWS,

(Edward) Wyllys ANDREWS IV, 42769, a former OSS/CLA employee who

has lived in Mexico for many years and has continued to have social con-

tacts with representatives of this Agency in Mexico as well as with Agency

employees from fadquarters who visit him from tie to time. ANDREWS,

like CAIN, was born in Chicago of parents who also were born in the general.

area of Chicago.

5. The firstime CAIN came to the attention of the Security Office

was when the Mexico Station requested traces on him. Their request.

stemmed from an unannounced visit he made to the Station, during which

I he stated that he had an investigative agency in Mexico with branches in

Chicago and Los Angeles. He had also stated that his agency in Mexico

was for the purpose of training Mexican Government agents in police

methods, in investigative techniques, and in the use of the lie detector;

and had added that he was investigating Communism in a certain unnamed

Central American country:

6. In June 1962, the Mexico Station advised that CAIN was being

deported by the Mexican Ministry (of) Gobernacion for these violations:

a. Carrying a loaded revolver and brass knuckles

b. Impersonating a Mexican Government official

(He had identification as an investigator for the

Mexican

¡ Treasury Office.)

c. Violating his tourist permit by working at his

detective office and at the Mexican Treasury

7. Subject was subsequently of irterest to the DGS in September

1963 when an ad hoc clearance was requested to permit his being asked

to respond to general requirements regarding his knowledge of certain

Cuban refugees and their potential for foreign positive intelligence.

10 September 1963, the DCS was sent a memorandum which furnished

much of the above information on CAIN.

8. On 22 May 1967, the Director of Security indicated that he

had received information from the FBI which ties Subject to the Mafia

in Chicago; and he directed that the DCS be contacted for information

as to whether or not they ever established contact with him and, if so,

for what purpose. The DCS was also to be advised that, if they were

in contact with him, it was suggested that they break it off. On 25

May 1967, the DCS advised that there had been no contact with CAIN

since 1963, and furnished copies of eight reports for which Subject had

been the source of information. These had to do with anti-Castro Cuban?

activities, procurement of arms, etc.

9. On 29 May 1967, Security advised the DCS that there is a

current FBI investigative interest in Subject and recommended that

there be no further contact with him at this time.

10. The l September 1967 copy of Life magazine çontains an

article titled "Brazen Empire of Organized Crime," in which it is

stated that Sam GIANCANA; Head of the Chicago Coga Nostra, is "still

running things-by remote control from a hide-out in Mexico... where

he poses as Ricardo SCALZETTI. The real SCALZEITI, GIANCANA'S

erst while chauffeur and courier, is more familiar to Chicagoans as

Richard GAIN, a well known former Chicago policeman and more recently

a private investigator.".

11. Eldon S. COHEN who is mentioned in paragraph 2 of this

memorandum as having evidenced an interest in CAIN during the guber-

natorial campaign of the now Senator (from Illinois) Charles fI. PERCE,

1170329 and #EE-21773, is now PERCY's Executive Assistant. COHEN,

who became employed by PERCY in January 1964, following his resigna-

tion from CIA which was effective 31 December 1963, at the time he con-

tacted a representative of the Chicago Office of DCS regarding CAIN on

10 February 1961, did not indicate that ha was employed by PERGY. He

said, rather, that he'd been asked by the "'PERCY for Governor" people

to inquire as to GAIN'S status.
