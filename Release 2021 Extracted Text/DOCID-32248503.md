position and title was " planning and specifications man " which

consisted of maintaining records and ordering materials and re-

cording thier usage. His work was satisfactory and he recieved

pay raises as they came due. He made numerous oral and written

complaints that he was not being promoted to a higher position

because of personality conflicts with his immediate supervisors.

He states in one letter that he has been " victimized " by his

supervisors. He did not recieve any promotions that he requested

in the later years that he worked for Chrysler. However, he was

written an offer of anothes position in 1972 but his letter was

returned to the company for lack of a forwarding address. Maro-

chini's supervisor was Mr. John O'Niel who is now retired and livirg

in Slidell, La.

Marochini lists his previous employment from 1949 thru 1964

when he is hired by Michoud. In his employment he lists Standard

company is a part of William Rielly Coffee Co. where Lee Harvey

Oswald worked from 5-10-63 to 7-19-63.

Marochini also worked at Arnouds Restaurant in the French

Quarter of New Orleans from 6-10-63 to 8-25-63. This restaurant
