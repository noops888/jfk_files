had decided to sell their

rights to this concession. He stated it

appeared this decision was brought about by the edict of the Nevada

State Gambling Board requiring a separation of interests by individuals

owning gambling operations in Cuba and Nevada. LANSKY advised that

while the combination would have to sell their concession rights in

a poor market, nonetheless they had made a substantial profit on

their initial

investment in the casino during the first two years of

operation and they would not suffer any loss.

reputation of the individuals buying the concession will have to meet

or not he would remain in Cuba and operate the casino would depend upon

the identity of the individuals who bought the concession.

LANSKY stated the combination had yet not opened the

Stardust, a new gambling casino in Las Vegas which had been built by

them because of difficulty in obtaining a license for the Stardust

until such time as they have sold their interests in Cuba.

LANSKY stated the edict of the Nevada State Gambling Board

requiring a separation of interests was strictly a political maneuver

directed in the main at CLIFF JONES, former

Lieutenant Governor of

Nevada, and that while the decision would, of course, affect JONES,

who has just recently invested a substantial amount of money in the

Hotel Havana-Hilton, it was also affecting other individuals with

interests in both places who have nothing

to do with Nevada state

politics.

He stated that JONES, prior to buying an interest in the

gambling casino in the Havana-Hilton, had discussed the matter with the

Governor of Nevada to insure there would be no difficulty and had been

assured he would have no problem.

LANSKY stated that subsequently,

however, JONES, a Democrat, had thrown his support behind other

Democrats in the forthcoming Nevada elections in November and as a

result, the present incumbent, a Republican, had sent the word down

to the Nevada State Gambling Board to "put the squeeze", on JONES.

HAV-31 advised on May 28, 1958, that JOETMORISI has been

employed as

a supervisor in the casino at

the

substantial

Hotel Nacional for a Mav" Cuba

period of time.

leaving the casino

June 1, 1958, and intended spending approximately a month seeing

friends and thereafter expected to arrive at Atlantic City, New Jersey.

HAV-31 advised on May 27,

to Havana to discuss the disposal of the casino at the Hotel Nacional.

In this regard, on May 29, 1958, THOMAS KELLEY, resident manager of

the Hotel Nacional, advised that TOM MCGINTY was in Havana for the

purpose of discussing the problems that had arisen in connection with

ownership of the casino because of the recent edict of the Nevada State

Gaming Board. Mr. Kelley indicated that MC GINTY had said that SAM

TUCKER would probably be "transferred."

On May 30, 1958, HAV-31

advised that an individual named "SAMMY" (possibly identical with

SAMUEL LAWRENCE BRATT, a former associate of the LANSKYS in gambling

operations in Broward County Fl

- Florida)

was in Havana to discuss the Cuba

sale of the Nacional gambling casino. Source said he had ascertained

that LOUIS NIER,ementioned above, has a partnership with SAM TUCKER

in an apartment building in Las Vegas and that NIER is reputed to haye

a substantial interest in the W. and S. Horse Breeding Stables in

Lexington, Kentucky.

On June 4, 1958,

HAV-31 advised that GEORGE GORDON had

turned down the offer made to him by the Desert Inn group to be

the front man for the Nacional gambling casino. Source stated that

an individual named MELAGOLDEN is presently in Havana and that GOLDELuba

will be the operator of the Stardust, a

new gambling casino being

constructed by the Desert Inn combination in Las Vegas.

to the casino at the Hotel Nacional and on the second occasion had

been in the back room of the casino counting the house 'receipts, together"

with JACK LANSKY.

On June 5, 1958, JACK LANSKY advised that as yet no buyer

On June 13, 1958, PCI Arthur Newman mentioned

that he

believed the present

interest holders in the Nacional casino would

be given plenty of time by the Nevada Gaming Board to effect the

sale of their interests.

Source said he did not believe JACK LANSKY

would leave the casino unless there was a very radical change in

ownership.

Source believed there would not be any actual change in

ownership but just a change in faces in Havana.

On June 18, 1958, Thomas Kelley, mentioned above, advised

that SAM TUCKER had received permission from the Nevada State Gaming

Board to take whatever time was necessary to dispose of the interest

he had in the casino at the Hotel Nacional. Kelley was of the opinion

that TUCKER might attempt to delay taking action on selling his

interest in the casino until the November elections in Nevada in

order to see whether the present incumbents might lose out thereby

resolving his problem.

HOTEL HAVANA-RIVIERA CASINO Havana, Cuba

On May 21, 1958, HAV-31 advised that JULIUS E.AROSENGARD,

stated that the edict of the Nevada State Gaming Board had been

directed principally at CLIFF JONES, former Lieutenant Governor

of Nevada and an interest holder in the Havana-Hilton casino.

On June 13, 1958, PCI Arthur Newman stated that the edict

of the Nevada State Gaming Board, although directed at CLIFF JONES,

had possibly done less damage to him than to other individuals in

Havana who also had interests in Nevada because JONES has a relatively

small interest in the Havana-Hilton casino.

PCI Newman noted that

'JOE SILESI is employed on a salary basis as manager of the casino

at the Hilton; however, he has some sort of profit arrangements

that allows him to receive an extra bonus if business is good.

Information was previously furnished Legat, Havana, that

an individual known as "JOCKEY" DENNIS, a former con man

had purchased

an interest in the gambling casino at the Jockey Club at

the Oriental

Park Race Track.

On May 29, 1958, HAV-31 advised that this individual

had died on that date of pleurisy.

On June 16, 1958, PCI Pedro P. Tapia (conceal) verified

the fact that "JOCKEY" DENNIS had died.

This source stated that

OU GEORGE LEVINE, FBI NO. 382915, continues to operate the Oriental

Park Race Track as well as the casinos at the track.

Source said

thät the track is losing about $5,000 a week but that LEVINE appears

to have unlimited resources. Source noted that the profit at the

casinos is not sufficient to offset the losses at the track.

GENERAL INFORMATION

Sources have advised that there has been a recent improve-

ment in tourism in Havana with the resultant slight increase in

activity in the casinos. At present, only two casinos are reported

to be breaking even or better.

These are

the casinos at the Hotel

Capri and the Havana-Hilton.

Sources feel, however, if the political

situation remains reasonably quiet that all the casinos will

eventually be showing a profit.

On May 14, 1958, Mr. Thomas Kelley, mentioned previously,

Miami Beach, Forida

Kelley said these two individuals attempted to interest him in

operating a hotel for them in Cienfuegos, Cuba.

Kelley said this

hotel is to be constructed in the near future and will have a gambling

casino. He stated it will ostensibly be financed by Compania Cubana

de Aviacion and that President Fulgencio Batista willhhave an interest

in the operation. Mr. Kelley said that LIPSKY and SCHWARTZ indicated

they will operate the gambling casino and that Senator KENNETH JOHNSON

of Nevada will have an interest in the casino operation.

Mr. Kelley DIC

said that while he had not previously known LIPSKY, he recalled having

met SCHWARTZ on several occasions many years ago in New York City.

Kelley said at that time SCHWARTZ was considered to be a "right-hand

man" for FRANK COSTELLO.
