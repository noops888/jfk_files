It is noted FAUSTO DANIEL VILLAR is mentioned in

this LHM as having knowledge of attempts by HART, ORLANDO

GARCIA, and LUIS POSADA to obtain firearms in the Miami area

for use of the insurgents in Venezuela. VILLAR furnished

this information

purchases.

This information was immediately furnished to

both U. S. Customs and CIA, Miami.

No interview has been conducted with VILLAR by

Miami inasmuch as he is on bond on federal charges and the

information furnished by him concerns arms smuggling which

is under the primary jurisdiction of Customs. Additionally,

address and has been kept apprised of information fur-

nished to the Miami source by VILLAR. Additionally,

SCHACHTER [is aware of POSADA'S CIA connections and indi-

cated he would attempt to determine from CIA the extent

CIA involvement, if any, in this activity.

All information available to Miami has been fur-

nished to U. S. Customs locally.

Since the allegations

principally concern matters within primary jurisdiction of

U.S. Customs, Miami is conducting no additional investiga-

tion, UACB.

It is noted Jacksonville previously requested

Bureau authority to interview STANLEY HARRIS under the

HARRIS caption.

Unless interview of HARRIS developes

information concerning HART contrary to that obtained in

enclosed LHM, it will not be necessary for Jacksonville to

report this information under the HART caption.
