On 28 Sept OSHALD went to the

Consul General of the Sov Union' to request a visa for Russia.

He said

In helping his case, that his wife was a Sov oltizen; that he was a

militant Communist and had lived three yIB In Russia.

OSWALD told the

Sor Consul that he could verify this quickly by calling his wife who was

at that time in New Orleans In a hotel. The Sov Consul said he would

have to consult with his government and that ordinarily a case l1ke this

would take from three to four months.

DORIICOS of Cuba.

In this coversation, which like the firet iis taped,' DORTICOS expressed

continued concern over possibility that Mexi police had Interrogated Silvia about money.

ALVARADO, the No, was questioned by CAs officer until two a I. this morning.

This

who is now hiding in place provided by CAS. We cannot guarantee ALVARADO's safety.

Since we had received no reply to yesterday's telegrem (MEXI 7072 - para 97 above)

we have not roquested Mexi gor to take! g any aotion against Silvia except to maintain

inoreased surveillance of her activities.

Echeverria later denied to LEGAT that he lad any

specifio conorete evidence that she was about to leave for cuba. We do not now know which

Echeverria statements are accurate.

It is quite possible, and even probable, that contre-

diotory statements made by Echeverria are explained by desire of COM to play down importance

of OSWALD visit here.

Mex1 line still is that OSWALD visit related solely to visa question.

Consistent | with this Echeverria stated to LEGAT that DORIICOS only Interested in finding

out whether Mexi authorities tried to pay a story fron Silvia:

This is obviously incrorrect

Interpretation. Neither LOPEZ Mateor nor Echeverria know of ALVARADO's story.

Mexi press has easy access. Possiblity of habess corpus cannot be discounted but are

S.A. de C. V. bus line, which has: 1ts headquarters in Monterrey, N. L. and Its Mexi terninal

at Buenavista Street No. 7. / The passenger list or manifest was clear evidence thet

OSWALD had departed from Mexi on the bus connected therewith which left Mexi at 1:00 p.m.

and scheduled to have arrived

at 5:30 a.m., 3 Oot: 63. I Info on passenger list is handwritten, not complete and not all

legible, etc... (report submitted typed list of passengers, seat number, ticket number and

destination, etc.).:. "Inquiry at Transportes Frontera Bus Terminal" -

•On. 5 March 64,

Gilberto LOZANO Guizar advised that he is the Manager of the Mexi Terminal of Transportes:

Frontera Bus Company, Buenavista #7, which has a franchise for i"through service" between

Mex1, Monterrey, and Laredo,

but is not permitted to sell tickets or pick up passengers at

Intermediate localities.: / LOZANO said that Iransportes Frontera had made a complete study

of its records and procedures and has now arrived at the conclusion that the person designated

as "OSWID"on-the 2 Oct 63 passenger manifeat did not purchase a ticket and could not have

traveled on the

trig to which it relates.

He pointed out that the list of passenger reserva

tions, tickets sold; and passengers actually boarding the bus in Mexi are recorded on the

form which' is provided for that purpose and 1s maintained on a clip board on the counter

from which ticket sales normallly are made by the ticket salesman and dispatcher, Francisco

ALVARADO.

'He admitted that ALVARADO occasionally is assisted during rush hours or a tempor-

ary absence from the counter by the baggage handler,' Lucio LOPEZ Medina, who may receive

and record reservations on the manifest but does not handle the actual receipt of payment:

of the Individual requesting the reservations.

That reservation is respected under normal

conditions until two hours before departure time; however, in the event all seats are not

filled, it may be held until the actual departure of the bus.

Prior to the departure

the bus, & final check 18 made

of passengers in connection with tickets sold for that

partioular trip, and at that time the dispatcher communicates by radio to the company

headquarters in Monterrey the number of "paying" passengers on the bus: in relation to the

Monterrey or Laredo destinations for which they purchased tiokets.

/ Francisco ALVARADO,

tloket salesman and dispatcher for Transportes Frontera, advised that he prepared most of

the handwriting on the 2 Oct 63 manifest on which the name "OSWLD" and destination "Lared"

appear opposite Seat No. 4.

He stated that he did not write the "OSWLD" reservation info

and it was his opinion that the reservation had been made and the info recorded by the

baggage handler, Lucio LOPEZ.

ALVARADO is quite certain at the present time that the

Individual desiated on the list as "OSWLD" did not purchase & ticket and did not travel

on the trip relating to that manifest. No ticket number was recorded for that person, and

a search of the company's records in Monterrey had failed to locate a ticket stub which

was not otherwise accounted for in connection with that particular trip. I. The notations

by ALVARADO of "9 Laredo, T Monterrey" reflected that he had reported by radio to the

Monterrgy office of the company that the bus had departed with nine

"paying" passengers

and seven "paying" passengers destined for Monterrey, Listed under

"Name of

"Angel PEREZ"

with no ticket number or destingtion, which confirmed that he had not purchased a ticket.

listed as having traveled

on a pass to Torreon.

the back of the manifest referred to advances of funds made by ALVARADO to LOZANO from the

cash for repairs, parts or other reguirements.

They related that the passenger lists

are not kept as a permanent record, and, when the manifest was located in the

"trash"

at the request of investigators of the Mexi Presidential' Staff, the Blanks at the tope

of the form had not been filled in as to time, destination, trip number, bus number, and

date, but they had completed those blanks from their personal knowledge in order to make

that dats clear to the investigators. They also had listed the names

of the drivers

on the

formar at that time.

They affirmed that the handwritten

"Transportes

Frontera"

at the top

of the document had' been added by some official of the Mexi Government after the document

was borrowed from them. / Both LOZANO and ALVARADO stated that they had no recollection of

Transportes Frontera bus of 2 Oct 63,

but pointed out that after the name was located on the manifest, they had not been given

opportunity of reviewing,

Sebastian PEREZ Hernandez, desk clerk and assistant to the oner of the Hotel del Comerelo,

had not conversed with OSWALD but remembered him clearly because few Americans stay at the

hotel..

He said OSWALD left the hotel each morning and did not return until evening, possibly

after PEREZ Hernandez had completed his yorking day and left the hotel.

OSWALD was alone

and usually wore a knit, short-sleeved sport shirt and no coat or jacket..

He did not remember

He believed

OSWALD carried his own luggage downstairs

without wearing a coat???

If OSWALD ate meals at 1400 at restaurant
