INE OSWALD IN RUSSIA

(e) On 23 February 1964, as SUBJECI approached the table for

the evening meal, he noted that the Time magazine Iying on the coffee

table in the living room had a picture of Marie OSHALD. As he sat

down he hit the table with his fist and sala, "I feel that I could

have stopred OSVALD", At this point Special Agent Stanley C. LACH

asked him "how?". He proceeded to state that he (SUBJECT) was head

of the KCB fourist and Visitors Section which kept control over the

activities of OSTALD while he was in the Soviet Union. He caid at

the üime, OSWALD was of no special concern or interest to the KGB

because he lacked intelligence background. Thereïore,

then he applied

tos permission to leave fussia, they (KCB) under his (SUBJECT) directior

informed OSWALD that he would have to make his application through the

appropriate channels of the Stete Department, who in lum would request

his relcase from the Russian counterparts in handling of visas.: This

he said ms all done for propaganda ind show purposes. He went on to

state that if they really vonted to release OSWALD, it could have been

done on the spur of the moment, but since OSWALD had noching and was

not worth anything, they decided that this was an opportunity to show

the American State Department that they did not mind releasing individ

uals if they applied for release through the appropriate channels.

Prior to this application for release of OSWALD, the SUBJECT stated

that since he was of no particular interest to them and there was

nothing in Moscow that they could use him for or place him into, they

decided that they would send OSWALD to luck where he would be placed

in a factory working on mdios in the hope that sone raining in the

electrical and elecironic field night result in his development into

an electronics enginees; however, he shoved no capability in this field.

The SUBJECT then siated that it was just at his period, before sending

OSwALD to linsk, that a very sirange thing happened.

OSTALD was supposed to have a meeting vith a travel agent in regard

¿o preparations for his going to Minsk at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.

At 6 o'clock he suill did not report to the travel agent, so the travel

ageni decided to go to the hotel where OSWALD was staying to see if he

could locate him.

was in his roon, the clerk nodded affirmatively, and the travel agent

proceeded to OSWALD's room. He tried the door,

but the door was lored.

He knocked, got no response, and then with the assistance of the clek

they broke

into the room and found OSMAID lying across the bed wich boch

of his wrists slashed.

The travel agent and the clerk responded imnediately

by taking OSWALD to the near-by medical facility where he was given blood

trensfusions and after a period of time regained his strengüh.

During the

investigation the following day the SUBJECI stated chai the doctor indicated

thet had OSVALD not been lound ior approximately ten more minutes, he would

have been dead.

It is here that the SUBJnCT again pounded the table and

said if the travel agent had not broken into the room, but had instead

contacted the KGB office ilke they are instructed to when they do not

get any response fron people with whom they have appointments, that he

(SUBJECT would have most likely directed the travel agent to foiget

about him, and on the following day or later that evening he would have

sent one of the KGB agents to check on OSTALD, at which time he would

Lave been found dead. This, he vent on to state, 1s what hurüs him

when he realizes that he could have been instruental in disposing of

OSWALD without any special inquiry or serious invesbigation, OSUAD

being nothing, and at the same time today the Fresident of the United

States, Presiient Kunnoy, would be alive. The SUBJECT then went. on:

to state that after OSWALD was sent to Minsk it was there that he met

Marie.

Like hinself (OSWALD), Marie was a girl fron a peasen family

wiüh no special background and somewhat illiterate. It was because

of her poor background that she was elven permission to marry OSWALD

and return to the United States as his wife.

The SUBJECT then went on to describe what tooh place on the day

that President INNIUDY was assassinated. le cald that this was actually

on Saturday in Moscoir, the 22nd of November. He was home at he time

and happened to have the radio on, when he heard that the President of

the United States had been assassinaied. Approxinntely one hour later,

the radio informed hin that the assessin vas Lee OSLALD. This announcement,

he said, really stunned hin. he grabbed his coat and dached to his office.

Immediately upon his arrival he searched for the OSWALD file. When he

lound the file he reviered it and found that OSWALD had not been ured

or even approached for use by the Russian Intclligence.

He put in a

long distance call to the Chief of the KGB Section in Minsk and inquirea.

whether they had used, trained of prepared OSWALD in any vay for intell1-

gence aculvity. The Chier informed him that according to what he could

recall, they had not made auy use of OSWALD. Just about this tinie, he

the SUBjECT to get all the inforntion available on OSWALD and prepare

a sunmary to be furnished the top officials of the Communist Farty.

Patroy unil he was 27 years old, and he did this out of respect to nis

rather, who at the ine was on his death bed and asked him (SUBJECT)

whether he would do him one more favor before he died.

That is how

the SUBJEcT stated he joined the Communist Party. Otherwise, he probably

rould not have been a member to this day.

DIPLONATS AND INTELLIGENCE TYPES

(g) The SUBJECT stated that the KCB are able to differentlate

botireen Americans who are assigned to Moscow and are actually the

State Department type, fron those who have an intelligence background,

by the fuct that the intelligence trpe of

people do not associate wich

the Russian girls, that is they will not go out with them alone, whereas

the State Department type. will. Also, over a period of a month

or two,

they invariably are able to find evidence that the Intelligence types

have been masturbating.

This is usually detected through close exam-

ination of the individual's towels and bad sheeus.

SUBJECT'S FATHER

(1) The SUBJECT also made reference to his father ducing this

meal, describing him as a very tall and extremely vell-built individual,

and one who was extremely intelligent and a self-made, self-educated

man. He learned the shipbullding trade mostly through his own research

and study, and also from the SUBJECT's grandfather, who was one of the

first shipbuilders in fussia. The SUBJECT added that his grandfather

died at the age oi 94. He also stated that after the death of his

they all went to this ceremony in honor of his father.

He also

indicated that there vas a periodical which gave a complete run-dom

on his family background, including that of his grandfather and his

father, and it vas well publicized; and this he believes had a lot

to do with his being able to get some special preference and move

along as fast as he did in the KGB orgenization.

KGB PRESSURE ON FAMILY

(3) On 27 Febivary 190! during lunch, the SUBJICT stated that he

has been informed that the KGB is putting pressure on his immediate

family, particularly his mother. However, he said he was not overly

worried about her because she is well-off financially, and being up

In age there is not mich they can do to her.

However, what concerns

him most is the fact that they have already started to play on the

sympathies of his two children and his wife. The SUBJECT stated that

he was anticipating this; nowever, he did not think that they would.

hope he caid was given to him by the Chier of SR Division.

ITBRARY OF CONGRESS PENETRATION

by vehicle, as ve passed the Library of Congress, the sUBJECT pointed

to the bullding and stated that "ve have people vorking In there"

Spocial Agent Stanley C. LACH said,

"who is "re'?" and the SUBJICT

answered,

'KGB". He continued by stating that this was a good place

to place people because they could readily learn by just watching

and thereby get an idea as to what the militasy was planning In the

way of armaments and things of that nature. The SUBJECT also advised

that the responsibility for getting information surrepticiously from

American

Imbassies In foreign countries who employ Indigenous personnei,

falls within the confines of the KGB.

He stated that the way they go

about this is to work though the indigenous personnel and arrange to

enter the embassy at special times during the night. They would first

make a close survey and a photograph of the area in which the embassy

keeps its classified material, then they would subsequently enter this

area and open up the safes.

When he was asked how this was done he

stated, "oh, combinations to safes are not hard to acquire". He said

that the important and difficult part of this activity is taking the

naterial out and photographing it and then placing it exactly as it

was before they touched 1t.
