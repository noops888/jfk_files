days before the assassination. AZCUE had been in Mexico for eighteen

His replacement did arrive in September.

AZCUE was schedu-

We do not know who might have told OSWALD that AZCUE or any other

or some Soviet official might have mentioned it if OSWALD complained about

AZCUE's altercation with him."

I refer again to paragraph two of your memorandum, dated 12 February

1964, relative to disseminations to the Secret Service

made by CIA.

On 24 November 1964, CIA received from the Department of the Navy

copy of a cable from the

Naval Attache in Canberra, Australia IN 67327,

tion the previous day with an anonymous

who had described him-

self as a Polish chauffeur for the Soviet Embassy of that city.

This indi

vidual, while discussing several matters of intelligence interest, touched

on the possibility that the Soviet Government had financed the

assassina-

tion of President Kennedy.

Reference was made in this cable to the

of a similar anonymous telephone call on 15 October 1962.

"3. Upon receipt of this cable from Navy CIA took the following action:

"A. The CIA Station in Canberra arranged for discussion of the calls with

the Australian security service.

In the opinion of the Australian authori-

ties, the caller was a crank. ..:."
