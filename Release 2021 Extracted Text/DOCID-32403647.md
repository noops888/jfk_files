Informal Comments on HSCA. Drafts

Below is a listing of the comments that we submitted to the HSCA on the

draft reports. As you will recall, the agreement for this exercise was that ve

would keep no copies of the draft reports nor of our comments on them.

letters are informal and not for the record. As I told Mr. Blakey when we met

(а т 6, в hen e e

with him the other day, we are awaiting his call to the Agency to witness the

destruction of this paper. The letters are cited below by date and OLC i=

As we are finished with this phase. of the investigation, it would be

appreciated if you would locate and return your copies of these letters

immediately, retaining no copy for your own records.

It is not intended that

we destroy all of these until the final report is published, as we may wish to

draw. on the information in the letters if still relevant, in preparing comments

on the Final Report.
