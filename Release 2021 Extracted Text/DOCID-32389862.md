MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:. Conversation with David W. BELIN, 1 April 1975

A:

:

Q:

A:

What was the line of reporting in GiA during the period I served

as working level point-of-contact with the Warren Commission Staff?

It was a multiple leveled things

(a) from the Commission and AWD

personally via McCone-to Dick"Helmsy (b) from Helms to the two or

three components primarily concerned fSE, then SB, Dave Murphy;

LA, then WH; anchool In practice, the substantive SB input worked

up by one of its

photo for example search components headed by Lee Wigren--Minsk

et a--passed via Cl.

CI had own defector input.

In addition, on sensitive matters of concern to the investigation,

Dick Helms and Murphy diso dealt directly with the Commission. BRAfes

Did you hear:

?? [two crypts, one sounded by "Jackenet" ?].-

I had not.

Belin recalled that Castro had made a speech in which

a495?

he had charged assassination intent by emigres and had promised

retribution in kind if there was official support.

Had any thought been given to the assumption that an anti-Castro

assassination plot might have been underway, and fact it was known

to Helms and to Castro? [Mr. Belin said he now knew that Helms

vas, in fact, aware of something underway regarding Castro.

He

nad no evidence to show that I fRGRkhad been informed about it.i

Would that change any of the thinking re Oswald's Mexican trip and

contacts?

Yes, I said, though I intended to give moke

potential importance

to Oswald's KGB contacts, and related that I

wandathers--though

recognizing the wisdom of the Warren Commission's handling--had

felt there had been pokests the sowet aspect that should haye

been pursued:

a.

Fact that his two Sovtet consular contacts in Mexico City

had been identified as KGB and at least one (both 2L had been

traced-orgamizattoratly to the. 13th Department (assassinations).

SUBJECT: Conversation with David W. BELTN, 1 April 1975

Q:

b.

Our defector information strongly insists that all

Western militar defectors-like Oswald--were screened by the

13th Department.

c. Thinness of file turned over by Soviets in view of b.

I acknowledged in retraspect that Cuban hypothesis was worth recon-

sidering,

though it would appear that period of solid inter-service

RGB-DG1) retations began Jater, (i.e. after 1967-68, Venceremos, etc.).

Why did Oswald's lies include a denial to Dallas police that he ha

lade the Mexican trip unless there was something important to hide

about it?

All his other lies concerned key factual elements of his

cover story.

Why also did Marina deny she knew anything about the

Mexican trip in her first story to the FBE--which she later rectified

before the Warren Commission? Mr. Belin noted that he had left the

hypothesis of castro/cuban vavalvement oper in his book.

He added

that it would have been important to have known the facts about the

anti-Castro plot at the timejef the Warren Commission investigation.

He felt the least he

would have/doneswould have been to have insisted

on the polygraphing of

Marina Oswald regarding her knowledge of

Oswald's Mexican trip.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Plans

SUBJECT:

• AMMUG/1 Information on

Lee Harvey OSWALD

4 itti.

lo This memorandum is for

Information and for action

The proposed lines of action are indicated in paragraph 4.

2. AMMUG/L, the Cüban Intelligence Service defector,

has produced information of interest to the President's

Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy. CI

Staff learned of AMMUGN o

O2'30 April, A questionnaire was

submitted by the Staff on I May (Attachment A). Mr. Swenson,

who is handling the AMMUG/1 debriefing, provided a reply on

5 May (Attachment B). It was clear from Mr. Swenson's

summary that AMMUG/1 had information bearing on the

OSWALD relationship with the Cuban Embassy and Cuban

intelligence personnel in Mexico City, albiet his knowledge

was not that of a direct participant in matters affecting

OSWALD. A follow-up questionnaire was submitted to

AMMUG/1 on 6 May (Attachment C). Mr. Swenson's reply

was dated 8 May (Attachment D). Attention is directed

particularly to the content of paragraph two.of Attachment D.

3. We have the problem of reconciling the operational

exploitation of AMMUG/1 and satisfying the responsibilities

we have undertaken with Mĩ.. Rankin. AMMUG/1 is such an

operational gold mine that Mr. Swenson wants, at a maximum,

two months to work fully. It is palpable, however, that we

must furnish to the Commission the substance of AMMUG/1's

information on OSWALD before that.

On the previous record of

our association with the Commission, particularly with Mr. Rankin,

it seems possible for the Agency to workout an arrangement with

Mr. Rankin personally that would take care of their needs and ours

after a frank discussiom

of the equities.

4. It is recommended that the DDP in person or via a

designee, preferably the former, discuss the AMMUG/1

situation on a very restricted basis with Mr. Rankin at his

earliest convenience either at the Agency or at the Commission

headquarters. Until this takes place, it is not desirable to put

anything in writing.

The Oswald Case

REFERENCE

Blind Memorandum dated 05 May 1964 v

B.

Blind Memorandum dated 07 May 1964

C. Conversations between CI Staff and

C/ WH/SA/CI

1. When the Oswald Case first was discussed with the Source the

specitc questions prepared by Cl. Staff were posed. The answers

given by the Source were reported in Reference A. That memorandum

which I dictated to a CI Staff stenographer appears accurate except for

sentence #9 which should have said that the only possible "fabrication"

known by Source was the specific denial by Fidel CASTRO, on a

television program; of any Cuban knowledge of Oswald.

2. On 07 and 08 May 1964 I further discussed the Oswald Case

with the Source in order to clarify exactly what he knew and what

he had heard. In the light of the explanation given by him, I believe

that a clearer understanding of what he knows can be reached if I

record his knowledge without using the question and answer format.

Accordingly, in the following paragraphs I shall report all the

information given by the Source paraphrasing his explanations and

comments.

" I have no personal knowledge of Lee Harvey OSWALD or his

activities and I do not know that OSWALD was an agent of the

Direccion General de Inteligencia (DCI) or any other directorate

or department of the Cuban Government.

I first heard of OSWALD alter the assassination of President

Kennedy when news media carried the name of OSWALD.

Personnel in the Del first commented about the case, so far as

I can recall, one dayafter lunch when a group of officers, of

whom I was one, were chatting. The officers present were about

ten including Roberto SANTIESTEBAN, Norberto HERNANDEZ

de Curbelo, Andres ARMONA, Pedro FARINAS Diaz and

Manuel VEGA Perez.

Manuel VEGA Perez previously had

been assigned to Mexico in the Cuban Consulate where he

was the principal intelligence atticer of the DGI, VEGA

mentioned that OSWALD had gone to the Cuban Consulate

two or three times in connection with a visa application

during the time that VEGA w as in Mexico. I gathered,

although I do not know that VEGA made any specific

statement to this effect, that VEGA personally had seen

OSWALD. I well could have reached this conclusion

because normally VEGA and his assistant in Mexico for

the DGI, Rogello RODRIGUEZ Lopez, would see persons

applying for a visa to go to Cuba.

This is because DGI

officers are charged with expediting the granting of visas

of agents of the DGI

Such agents on appearing at the

Consulate use a special phrase to indicate their relationship

with the DGI. (I do not know the particular phrase used

in every case. I do know that agents from El Salvador in

requesting visas always made mention of the name "Vauricio" )

The DGI officers at a Consulate interview visa applicants to

find out if they ar@agents. If the visa applicant does not use

one of the indicated! phrases, the DGl officers, Instead of

granting the visa immediately, tell the applicant to return in

a few days.

The officer then notifies Habana and requests

authority for the visa. I cannot recall if VEGA even made the

statement that he had requested permission to issue a visa to

OSWALD, but I feel sure that he would have done so because

VEGA had said that OSWALD had returned several times and

this would be the usual procedure.

I believe that Rogelio RODRIGUEZ Lopez also would have

seen OSWALD because he worked with VEGA and also would

have screened visa applicants.

I thought that Luisa CALDERON might have had contact with

OSWALD because I learned about 17 March 1964, shortly before

I made a trip to Mexico, that she had been involved with an

American in Mexico. The information to which I refer was told

to me by a DGI case officer named Norberto HERNANDEZ de

Curbelo. (I remen

because he gave me $40. Uu to, buy some shoes and

- other items during my trip to viexico.) I had

commented to HERNANDEZ that it seemed strange

that Luisa CALDERON was receiving a salary from

the DGl although ste apparantly did not do any work

for the Service, CHSRNANDEZ told me that bers was

a peculiar case and that he himself believed that she

had been recruited in Mexico by the Central Intelligence

Agency although Manuel PINEIRO, the Head of the DGI,

did not agree. As Krecall, HERNANDEZ had investigated

Luisa CALDERON. This was because, during the time

she was in Mexico, the DGI had intercepted a letter to

her by an American who signed his name as OWER (phonetic)

or something similar.

As you know, the pronunciation

of Anglo-Saxon names is difficult in Spanish so I am not

sure of how the name mentioned by HERNANDEZ should be

spelled. It could have been "Howard" or something different.

As I understood the matter, the letter from the American

was a love letter but indicated that there was a clandestine-

professional relatlonship between the writer and Luisa

CALDERON. Faksa understood from HERNANDEZ that

after the interception of the letter she had been followed

and seen in the company of an American. I do not know if

this could have been OSWALD. I, myself, considered the

case of Luisa CALDERON unusual because I had known her

before she went to Mexico when she worked in the Ministry

of Exterior Commerce in the Empresa Transimport Department

where she was Secretary General of Communist Youth

She

was transferred directly from that position to a post in Mexico

which seemed strange.

The only other person about whom you asked me in connection

with this, wrom I recall, is Sylvia DURAN and I know very

little about her.

What happened was that I was in the Cuban

Embassy in Mexico on 23 March 1964 about 1230 in the afternoon

preparing to return to Habana the same,day. I was talking to

some other Cubans including Rogelio RODRIGUEZ Lopez and

inu BUENAVENTURA of the Cuban Embassy; a courier named

"Enio", a courier named "Tato";, and one other Cuban whom I

cannot recall.

we saw a pretty girl standing at the end of

the reception room and someone asked who she was, and one

ot the group said it was sylvia DURAN

I recall that, after the news of the assassination of

President Kennedy reached the DGif orders were issued

to Bolt at late all doc mend according to the field,

they were "muy gecreto" (very secret), "secreto" (secret),

or "importante" (impontant). The material, once packaged,

was to be held pending further instructions.

All travel by

DGI officers and all DGI pouches were suspended temporarily.

In addition, I recall that DGI Headquarters personnel were

instructed either to remain in the DGI Headquarters offices

or to keep the DCI aware of their whereabouts so that they

could be reached immediately. I do not know the reason for

these measures but I believe it logical that they were issued

because of the possibility that the United State might take

some type of action against Cuba and the DGI offices.

As

nearly as I can recall, we were able to unpackage DGI files

and use them normally about the 3rd of December 1963."*

3. In brief, the Source does not claim to have any significant

information concerning the assassination of President Kennedy or

about the activities of OSWALD. If the paraphrased comments of

the Source are considered to nee further clarification, I suggest that

Mr. Rocca, who is most famtliar with the details of the OSWALD

Case, talk to the Source. This can bevarranged at any time. Mean-

while, I shall have a question asked in a forthcoming LCFLUTTER to

determine whether or not the Source seems to have concealed any

information on this matter.

Subject - General: Debrieting of Cuban Source

Specific:

OswAke: Case

The source does not have di

Ject knowledge of Lee Harvey OSWALI

r his activities but was able to provide items of interest based or

Cuban intelligence officers assigned to the Direccion General De

Inteligencia. The information appearing below was furnished by

the source and is keyed to questions submitted.

1. Prior to Oetober 1963, OSmall Visited the Cuban Embassy

in Mexico City on two or three occasions. Before, during and after

these visits, OSWALD was in contact with the Direccion General De

Inteligencia (DGI), specifically with Luisa CALDERON, Manuel

VEGA Perez and Rogelia RODRIGUEZ Dópez.

VEGA whose Cuban intelligence pseudonym is MARCOS

is the current Cuban IS chefig-Mexico. He recently has had a

tour of duty in Habana, prigr to which he held the same post as

now as Cuban IS chief in Mexico.

RODRIGUEZ is a Cuban IS staff officer in Mexico. He has

three Cuban intelligence pseudonyms, Eduardo, Casimiro and Jose

Antonio.

The precise relationship of Luisa CALDERON to the DGI is

not clear. She spent about six months in Mexico from which she

returned to Cuba early in 1964.

2. The source does not know whether or not the Cuban Services

used OSWALD in any agent capacity or other manner.

3. A. When news of the assassination of President Kennedy

reached the DGI, it caused much comment concerning the fact

OSWALD had been in the Cuban Embassy in Mexico. In addition,

orders were issued for all headquarters and field officers of the

DGl to sort and package all documents according to whether they

were "Muy secreto" (very secret),

"secreto", (secret), and

"importante" (important). The material once packaged was to be

held pending further instructions.

In addition, all travel by DGI

officers and all DGI poudhegurere suspended temporarily.

B. When the news that

SWALD was the assassin reached

the DGI, there was no immediate comment but, when Fidel CASTRO

spoke on television to deny Cuban involvement, there was considerable

comment concerning OSWALD's visit to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico.

At this time VEGA, who has been mentioned previously, was in Cuba

and commented to a group of DGI staff officers that OSWALD had come

to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico to request a visa but had been refused.

VEGA did not give any details and the subject was not pursued.

4. It is not known whether information on OSWALD's visit to

the Cuban Consulate in Mexico in September 1963 was relayed to any

' Cuban service.

It is not known if the Cuban intelligence services had contact

with the New Orleans' Fair Play for Cuba Committee.

6. The only Molina whovis recalled ig "The Hook", the Cuban who

was convicted in New York City for the murder of a young girl during

a clash between two Cuban groups. The DGI staff officer who had been

in the United Nations in New York, SANTIEST ABAN traveled to Cuba

with "The Hook" and with another Cuban named ORIHUELA and upon

arrival in Cuba tried to obtain employment for both individuals. The

names Pedro Charles and Peter have no known significance.

7. The reaction of Soviet officials in contact with the Cuban intelli-

gence services is not known.

8. Nothing is known about Soviet proposals following the news of

President Kennedy's assassination.

9. The only fabrication known is the special matter by Fidel

CASTRO previously mentioned.

10. Nothing is known about Jack RUBENSTEIN aka Jack RUBY.

11. The name Gilberto LOPEZ is not familiar but, if he visited

DGI headquarters, a photograph of him possibly could be identified.

OSWALD's photo was seen in the newspapers but nothing is

known about him other than what appeared in the press.

Dear Mr. Knoche:

As you know, there have been allegations that the CIA was

involved in a plan to assassinate Fidel Castro.

purposes of this letter, we will assume that these allegations

are correct, and based upon this assumption I would like to

know the answers to the following questions:

Did anyone with the CIA tell any member of the Warren

Commission or any lawyer serving on the Warren Commission

staff that such plans had been underway? If the answer is

yes, we would like to know what person or persons with the

Agency delivered said information, to whon it was delivered,

when it was delivered, what specifically was told or' said,

the Warren Commission. If the Commission was not told about

this, why was it not told and who made the decision not to

deliver such information to the Warren Commission?

There is evidence that Castro, prior to Novenber 22, 1963,.

knew about the existencevof such plans and the possible

volvement of the U.S. Government.

Did the CIA at any time prior

o the completion of the Warren Commission investigation have

any docurents or other information indicating that Castro may

have known about, such plans?

It the answer is yes, would you

please furnish us with copies of all such documents and details

of any such information.

Prior to his death Lyndon Johnson supposedly stated that

he believed that although there

no doubt: that Oswald

killed Kennedy and Tippitt, nevertheless Oswald might have

been a part of a conspiracy in retaliation to possible United

us of any information in Agency files

"Internet Memo Regarding Aguncy's Perition

with

Harves Commission

The DDP called me this afternoon, 12 May, to state

that the Directo» has received a telephone call from RANKIN

regarding the Commission's desire to interview him at 1030 AM,

Thursday. Mr. HOOVER is scheduled to appear at 9:00 on that

morning.

Dealing

2.

The DDP wishes to have from you a short but

comprehensive memorandum which highlights the basic issues or

positions entered into by the Agency in its dealings with the

Commission.

For example, RANKIN indicated that the Commission

would wish to hear the Dire ctor's views as to how improvements

might be made in protecting the President's life. Further, they

will probably ask questions regarding the possibilities that a con-

spiracy existed.

Such general questioning certainly necessitates

that the DCI be made aware of the positions taken during previous

interviews.

I raised with Mr. HELMS the nature of the recent

intormation which you are processing which originated with the

• sensitive WH source.

I informed him that in your view this would

raise a number of new factors with the Commission, that it should

not go to the Commission prior to the Director's appearance unless

we have first had some preliminary reaction or made sure that the

Director is fully aware of its implications since it could well serve

as the basis for detailed questioning.

The DDP stated that he would

review this carefully and made a decision as to the question of timing.

3. Given the schedule, you will appreciate that the DDP

will need a paper covering the above points as soon as possible.

Summary Outline

This, brief is concerned with five topics which, it is

anticipated, will arise to the course of the Director's appear -

ance befoxe the london a Commiesion, These are::

2. Formal and sualtied negation by the DCI

of any contact or association, direct or indirect,

between the Central Intelligence Agency and Lee

Harvey Oswald. This should be accompanied by

the tabling of an affidavit signed by the Director

and notarized. (TAB A)

b. A formal assurance by the Director that all

information in the possession of the Agency regarding

Oswald's activities and associations outside of the

United States has been made available to the

Commission through its staff, with which there has

been close and frequent contacts since the inception

of the Commission's activities. (TAB B)

c. An interim pronouncement by the DCI on the

problem of

orial responsibility fer Oswald's

activity. It is suggested that the DCI take the position

that: at this time there is no conclusive evidence of

conspiratorial aponsorship af Oswald; that all Agency

information bearing a this problem has been furnished

to the Commission for evaluation and consideration in the

framework of its total knowledge of the facts. The Agency,

at the present time, is lacking any knowledge of recent

information or documentation furnished by the Soviet

Government to the Commission with respect to Oswald's

activity in the Soviet Union. (TAB C)

d. The DCI's suggestions for improving policy and

organization with respect to the personal security of

the President. Certain steps relating strictly to the

Agency's jurisdiction have already been suggested by

memorandum. It is proposed that the Director now

make specific suggestions involving legislation which

would treat information bearing on the personal security

of the President and, advisedly, other Federal officials

directly related to national security affairs in a manner

similar to what currently exists by statute for special

e. Oswald's activity, in Mexico and his possible

relationship to the Cuban Intelligence Service.

Substantive information of grave concern. to the

security of sources and methods have been developed

on both of these topics. The information and, in certain

instances, knowledge with respect to acquisition has

been made available on a highly restricted basis to

Mr. Rankin and to certain elements of his staff. It is,

recommended that the DCI not respond on the record

to queries on these topics. He should suggest that all

such "technical questions" be worked out in detail through the

channels and procedures that have functioned very well

-- we believe -- between the Commission and particular

CIA components. (TAB E)

Formal Disclaimer of any Relationship with Dee Harvey Oswald

There have been rumore and allegations which began

immediately after the assassination which branded Oswald as a

U.S. Government agent.

In many instances, CIA has been

named as his sponsor.

The autkership, geographical dispersion

throughout the world, the ideasty of theree and the timing lend

strong support to the conclusion that these charges are elements

of a world-wide, Sortet-sponsored propaganda and misinformation

program.

As DCI, Mr. McCose welcomes this appearance before

the Commission to make a categorical and unqualified denial of

these unprincipled distortions of the historical and personal

responsibilities for what was a dastardly and heinous act. In

witness of this, the DCI submits to the Commission an affidavit

which formalizes this statement. The affidavit is attached.

It is recommended that the DCI state concurrently with this

action that he desires to draw the Commission's attention to the

fact that the irresponsible charges that have been made, sponsored

and replayed by Soviet bloc and Communist individuals and

organs since the assascination of the President, recall the

methods and the puxposes of the broader campaign against

American intelligence and security components which has built

up momentum over the past six years. We have traced the

sponsorship of that campaign directly to individuals and com-

ponents within the Soviet police state apparatus. Their un-

scrupulous treatment of the Oswald case was neither new as a

method nor a surprise as an occurrence.

If the DCI is challenged by anyone on the Commission

about the substance or implication of his affidavit, it is recom-

mended that response be along the following lines:

CIA is a democratic institution. The DCI has

incorporated in his affidavit the results of detailed

and painstaking examination. IKany qualification is

raised with respect to the affidavit, he willingly

undertakes the extraordiary step of releasing any

individual in CIA to appear before the Commission

and to tetity wit taspect to ady knowledge beasing

on the Commission's task.

Suggestions for Improving Policy and Organization Regarding

Presidential Security

Mx. Rankin raisod this question directly by letter. Xn

its response, the Agency confined itself to elements relating

to its statutory mission. Specifically, it was suggested that:

a. The Secret Service, or Treasury, record

wita the Office of Central Reference a formal require-

ment for information relating to Presidential security.

b. It was suggested that, if the Secret Service

intended to expand its lifteezence coverage of possible

threats to the President's security, our experience

showed that it would need a specialized organizational

component to handle that task within the Secret Service

itself.

c. The CIA reply also noted that the Agency was

in direct touch with the Secret Service regarding the

possible utilization by that agency of our experience in

machine data processing. On the public record, it is

suggested that the DCI not repeat this detail.

"?.

In his presentation to the Commission after referring

to these earlier suggestion?

the DCI should'state that he desires

to take the opportunity t

go ottera gussestion which he has not

tabled heretofore.

The Commission's major problem has been the

assessment

of personal motive and the relationship of an individual act to

possible conspiratorial guidance.

Because conspiracy is the

core of the problem, the DCI should point out the possibility of

legislative action which might be an assistance in preventing

recurrence of the national calamity it is investigating. There

is an analogy at close hand between the problem of developing in

advance information relating to Presidential security and the

problem faced by the countsy a few years ago regarding the

clandestine introduction or manufacture in the U.S. of special

nuclear material or atomic weapons. The remedy devised at that

time was embodied in the Atomic Weapons Reward Act of 15 July 1955

(29 Stat 365, PL. 165, 84th Congress). In essence, the Act estab-

lished a substantial reward ($500, 000) for information bearing on

the Act provided by any person, and in certain instances privileged

treatment for such persons -- for example, asylum if they were

created to administer the purposes of the Acte

The Del should sugarge that the Commission consider a

recommendation for original legislative action designed to

induce individuals to furnish information bearing on Presidential

security by offering a substantial reward and preferential treatment.

The DCI should assure the Commission that he is convinced that

the substantial award, the special treatment, and the publicity

which would attend the implementing legislation in this matter

could represent a

significant inducement even to staff officers

and personnel of secret associations and state security organs

abroad whose functions include assassination and sabotage. It

is these individuals who would be privy to plans of executive action.

The reward would constitute additional inducement for such

individuals to take the risk of making important disclosures.

calone

The suggestion does not rest on the naterial elements of

reward and special treatment.

The DCI can assure the Com-

mission that we are aware that personnel in police state apparatuses

charged with the assassination and sabotage functions have repeatedly

expressed and, in many cases,

acted upon their repugnance for

There are specifio cases in the past ten years which document

this assertion.

Trusted Dextonnel charged with assassination

missions have abandoned the mission even without the assurance

or the inducement which the DCI is here proposing.

In making this suggestion, the DCI may go one step furtaer

in advising the Commission to suggest that the Commission

examine the advisability of legislation making it a Federal offense

to conspire and to kill the Chief Executive. 3) The DCI could also

indicate that the Commission might desire ta suggest that any

legislation along these lines should be enlarged to include con-

spiracy to kill any Federal official in the President's personal

circle of official associates directly concerned with national

security affairs. (The Agency's Legal Counsel states that

draft bills have been considered on the Hill.).

Mexican and Cuban Phases of Oswald's ?

Activity

Extensive intonation has been made avallable to the

Commission by CIA on ARE

Frozking level regarding Oswald's

activity in Mexico City in September and October 1963. The

Commission Staff has been in detailed communication and

conversation with the Agency working levels both in head-

quarters and in Mexico City. Within the past week,

significant information has been developed by CIA regarding

the relationship with Oswald of certain. Cuban intelligence

personnel in Mexico City and the reaction in Havana within

the Cuban Intelligence Service to the news of the assassination

of President Kenedy. The Commission Staff is in the course

of being briefed on the Cuban aspect.

It is suggested that the DCI handle any question on the

Mexican and Cuban phases of Oswald's actirity as "technical

questions" which members of the Commission can develop

from or through their own staff with the appropriate component

of the Agency. This would be entirely consistent with the DCI's

overall a aurance that be bag lingerited ala personnel to place

their information completely at the Commission's disposition.

(Regarding Public Statement

by CASTRO,

BACKGROUND

1. On Saturday evening, 7 September 1963,

Fidel CASTRO appeared at a Brazilian Embassy reception in

Havana; even more unusual, CASTRO submitted to an informal

interview by the Associated Press correspondent,

Daniel HARKER.

2. HARKER's interview reached New York on Sunday,

8 September, and was in print throughout the country on

Monday, 9 September. There can be no question from the

facts surrounding the CASTRO appearance, which had not been

expected, and his agreement to the interview, that this

event represented a more-than-ordinary attempt to get a

message on the record in the United States.

3. CASTRO's statements to HARKER

covered a range of

topics but dealt principally with American political

leadership, in particular President KENNEDY, whom he ex-

coriated in extraordinasily

provocative fashion

(" ... KENNEDY is cretin,"

>" ... the BATISTA of his

times ... the most opportunistic American President of

all time ...").

4. The interview also contained an uncomplimentary

reference to Senator GOLDWATER and Cuban delay in signing

the limited nuclear test ban. There were differences in

the replay by United States newspapers like the

New York Times and Washington papers, with a result that

CASTRO's "message" was significantly modulated.

5. In New Orleans, where Lee Harvey OSWALD resided

until the middle of September 1963, the HARKER StorY

appeared in the principal morning paper. the Times-Picayune,

on Monday, 9 September, page 7, under a three-column head-

line:

"CASTRO Blasts Raids on Cuba. Says U.S. Leaders

Imperiled by Aid to Rebels." The story

followed under the

HARKER by-line:

"Havana (AP) - Prime Minister

Fidel Castro said Saturday night: 'U.s.

leaders would be in danger if they helped

in any attempt to do away with leaders of

Cuba.'

"Bitterly denouncing what he called

recent U.S. prompted raids on Cuban terri-

tory, Castro said, Wajare prepared to

fight them and answer in kind. U.s. leaders

should think

"Ilbat if they are aiding terror-

ist plans

to eliminate Cuban leaders, they

themselves will not be safe.'

... World affairs ... seemed to be

entering a more peaceful climate a few days

ago, but now this trend has changed with

attacks.

"'The U.S. is always ready to negotiate

and make promises which later it will not honor.

This has happened to promises made during the

October crisis. They have been broken as can

be seen with new attacks.

" 'But I warn this is leading to a very

dangerous situation that could lead to a worse

crisis than October's ...'"

6. The New York Times, in its coverage on 9 September,

used a UPI wire service report which omitted any reference

to the warning and threat which gave the interview its real

significance.

The Washington Post did an abbreviated re-

write (9 September, page A-7) which, similarly, omitted

any reference to the main thrust of CASTRO's remarks.

The Evening Star of Washington, D. C., printed_the HARKER

story nearly in its entirety in the second section of the

paper (9 September I963, page B-4) and reworded the content

of the HARKER interview, placing the emphasis on the po-

- in particular, highlighting the GOLDWATER

elements and burying CASTRO's warning to the United States

leadership in the middle of the piece.

7. There is no evidence in the files on the KENNEDY®

assassination).that this CASTRO interview was considered in

following up leads or in dealings with the Warren Commission

and its staff although Mexico Station specifically directed

Headguarters attention to the AP stary very shortly after

the Dallas killing. More important, the interview appears

to have been forgotten in the contemporary political consid-

eration of relations with CASTRO's Cuba.

There is no evidence

in the Agency records, either, that the Warren Commission

staff itself pursued the implication of the CASTRO interview

in dealing with the conspiracy hypothesis. There is no

evidence in the files that anything along these lines was

stated by any other Cuban leader before the assassination.

8. The purpose of this review, undertaken at Mr. Belin's

reguest, is to reconsider Lee Harvey OSWALD's activity on the

assumption that as an avid newspaper reader - which we know

from testimony of Marina OSWALD and others - he read the

CASTRO warning and threat as reported above. The results

of the review, admittedly heavily using the 20-- 20 quality

of hindsight, may be stipulated in summary:

_There ts no increment of credible

evidence, applying this phrase strictly, of

Soviet andyor Cuban political, intelligence

or security service involvement in the as-

sassination to what was developed and con-

sidered by the Warren Commission and its

staff. The Commission's finding that

Lee Harvey OSWALD was the killer of

President KENNEDY and Officer TIPPIT and did

stands.

b. "Credible evidence" that would

upset or significantly modify this judgement

did (and does) not exist in Washington. But

such evidence could exist in Moscow and/or

lavana, whose voluntary inputs to the Warren

Commission were minimal in quantity and

quality, designed to cover up any admissions

of knowledge of, or connection with, OSWALD

which might be related directly or indirectly

with the assassination. Therefore, the belief

that there was Soviet and/or Cuban (KGB. and/or

DEI) connection with OSWALD will persist and

member to OSWALD during his specialist training period

at El Toro Marine; Corps Base December 1958 - September 1959.

The Warren Commission Report takes note of this:

"OSWALD tOVd DEIGADO that he was

in

touch vitt

th Cuban diplomatic officials in

this country, which DELGADO at first took

to be 'one of his lies, but later

believed. '"2

10. Actually DELGADO's testimony says a lot more of

possible operational significance than is reflected by the

language of the report, and its implications do not appear

to have been run down or developed by investigation. Thus,

the record of the beginning_of_OSWALD's relationship with

the Cubans starts with a question mark.

11. The period was one of transition in U.S. - Cuban

relations after CASTRO's takeover. OSWALD, and DELGADO at

the outset, were CASTRO supporters, OSWALD being particu-

larly keen about how to get to the island. DELGADO testi-

fied:

13. DELGADO'S

testimony has the cast of credibility.

Granting that, it is of basic importance to focus attention

on the male visitor who contacted OSWALD at El Toro Camp

and talked with him for between one and a half. to two hours.

The event was unique in DELGADO's recollections, and actually

there is nothing like it - on the record - in everything else

we know about OSWALD's activity in the United States before

or after his return to the United States. The record reflects

no identification of the El Toro contact. DELGADO's presump-

tion is that he was from the Cuban Consulate in Los Angeles.

Assuming that, the questions are: Who was it, and was

there reporting f$om los Angeles to Washington and Havana

that could, in effect,

represent the opening of a Cuban

ENIGMATIC THREATS BY CUBAN THIRD SECRETARY IN THE HAYU

7 NOVEMBER 1963

16. A sensitive liaison source, reporting after the

KENNEDY assassination, indicated that at the Soviet reception

on 7 November 1963, the Cuban Third Secretary,

Ricardo I. SANTOS Pesa, discussed the recent refugee raids

on Cuba and their implications with a host-country diplomat,

concluding with the admonition: " ... Just wait and you

will see what we can do. It will happen soon." Asked to

be more speckfic, what would happen soon, SANTOS replied:

"Just wait, just wait."

by memorandum, 31 March 1964. SANTOS was reported to have

INTERCEPTED: CONVERSATION OF CUBAN EMBASSY EMPLOYEE,

LUISA CALDERON, AFTERNOON OF 22 NOVEMBER 1963

At 1730 Mexico City time, about five hours after the

KENNEDY assassination, a Cuban Embassy employee named

"Luisa" received a telephone call in Spanish from an uniden-

tified male outside.

19. The caller asked her if she had heard the latest

news. "Iuisa" jokingly replied: "Yes, of course, I knew

it almost before KENNEDY ... Imagine, one, two, three and

now; that makes three [she laughs], what barbarians! ..."

20. Both speakers agreed on the seriousness of the

assassination. "Luisa"

also stated that the party at

Silvia DURAN's had been called off so it would not appear

that they were celebrating the death of KENNEDY, nor would

they have the party coincide with the burial.

Finally she

said she planned to wove that night into the house of a

doctor (a womant Friend.

21. Latin hyperbole? Boastful ex post facto suggestion

of foreknowledge? This is the only item in the intercept

coverage of the Cubans and Soviets after the assassination

that contains the suggestion of foreknowledge or expectation.

22. The tenuous, enigmatic character of the conversation

is sharply highlighted by the following facts:

a. "Luisa" was probably identical with

Luisa CALDERON, a cadre worker of the Cuban

Directorate Geréral of Intelligence (DGI) .

She returned to Cuba in 1964 and was reported

to be working in DGI Headquarters.

b. The DGI element in Mexico City in the

fall of 1963 was headed by Alfredo MIRABEL Diaz

who had arrived on 2 September 1963, formally

as the replacement of the Consul Eusebio AZCUE

(departed 19 November 1963). The deputy DGI

chief (and as of June 1964, MIRABEL'S SUCCESSOr)

was Manuel Engenio VEGA Perez.

c. The "Silvia DURAN" named in Luisa's

conversation was the receptionist, a Mexican

national, who dealt with OSWALD during his known

visits on 27 and 28 September to the Cuban

installations in connection with a Cuban visa

application for stay and/or transit.

Silvia DURAN is the sole live witness on the

record regarding OSWALD's activity in

Mexico City. Her testimony, however, in its

entirety was taken and presented, solely, by the

Mexican Governmental authorities. A direct

confrontation with her was requested by the

Warren Commission staff but rejected by the

Mexican authorities. It is from Silvia

DURAN's

statements that it was learned that OSWALD

becamerengaged in a personal altercation on

27 September with Eusebio AZCUE.

d. Manuel Engenio VEGA Perez,

alias Marcos, and his DGI assistant,

Rogelis RODRIGUEZ Lopez, were positively

identified in February 1964 by two independent

sources as engaged in the active development

and facilitation of the training of Nicaraguan

agents for the purpose of assassinating

General Annstasio SOMOZA. VEGA, it is estab-

lished, was

on post in Mexico City during

OSWALD's stay there 27 September - 2 October

1963.

He left Mexico City on 3 November 1963

for. Havana. It was reliably reported about

VEGA that all individuals going to Cuba, legally

or illegally, had to pass through him first. He

took the biographical data and sent it to Cuba

for name checking, a procedure which normally

took fifteen days. 5

For example, VEGA would have handled the details of the

visa action

and facilitation of the trip to Cuba via

Mexico City from 28 December 1962 - 21 January 1963 that

23. There is no evidence in the OSWALD case file that

Silvia DURÁN was subjected to a systematic elicitative

interrogation that would have related her dealings with

knong ot confirned by intercept, with the data held

on the cuban

DGI, its personalities and methods, in

Mexico City. Was it normal for a case like OSWALD's,

considering the fuss he allegedly made with AZCUE; for

applications to be handled solely by a local employee and

a lame duck like AZCUE whose slot had been taken by the :

DGI chief? Whatever the answer to these questions, they

were not asked at the time. And there remains the more

fundamental question: accepting the DURAN story on its

face, could it have happened without the knowledge and

participation of the DGI personnel above cited? This

seems unlikely especially because VEGA is later fited by

a Cuban DEI defector as having stated he was avare OSWALD

CASTRO's overseas intelligence and security service could

have more in its files than was surfaced in the DURAN

Fair Play Committee for Cuba, with which OSWALD established

relations from Dallas during the period 19 April -

2 November 1963.

There is an overlap between LEE's and

VEGA's travels to Havana during that period:

VEGA

departed Mexico City on 6 January for Havana and returned

on 13 February 1963.

SILVIA DURAN,

SUBSTANTIAL AMPLIFICATION OF ADMISSION OF

ALLEGED PERSONAL RELATIONS WITH LEE HARVEY OSWALD, 1967

24. The defects viewed in hindsight of the Silvia, DURAN

testimony already have been suggested above. (In that

context of criticism it would also be relevant to reconsider

the implications of the two intercepted telephone conversations

on 26 November 1963 between the Cuban President, DORTICOS,

and his Ambassador to Mexico, Joaquim Hernandez ARMAS,

because the thrust of the conversation dealt with the ques-

tion whether Silvia DURAN had been asked about [or been

offered?] money payments by her Mexican interrogators.)

25. As of September 1964 Silvia DURAN gave up her

Cuban Embassy job. In the spring of 1967 Silvia DURAN

was reported by a reliable and sensitive source to have

cut all relations with Cubans. Her account, in 1967, of

how she had been taken into custody and had been interrogated

after the assassination repeated what was already knowit.

Mexico city. ALVARADO's story was ultimately broken by the

use of the polygraphalon which ALVARADO showed evidences of

deception, and by bringing ALVARADO'S former Nicaraguan

security service contral into the case.

28.

The ALVArADa

istory is a particularly acute repre-

sentation of the alificulties that beset the evaluation of

observed evidence: certain elements of the story persist

despite the impeachment of its major premises. ALVARADO,

whose account did not become public until the release of

the Warren Report in October 1964, talked consistently of

the presence in the Cuban Consulate transaction of a Negro

with red-dyed hair.

29. Elena GARRO de Paz is a mecurial.

ticulate and

socially prominent Mexican writer, married, but separated

from a high-ranking Mexican foreign service official. She

is also the cousin of Horacio DURAN. the husband of

Silvia DURAN, cited above. There is a strong personal

antipathy between the two women descending from

Elena GARRO's trenchant anti-Comnunism;

30. From October 1964 until his retirement in the fall

of 1969, a U.S. Embassy officer, Charles THOMAS, persistently

kept up a stream of reports and memoranda reflecting GARRO's

account of what had actually gone on between OSWALD, the

Cubans and in particular Silvia DURAN in September 1963,

including a repeated reference to a Negro with red-dyed hair.

31. The first reference to the GARRO story was noted in

a Mexico Station Memorandum of Record dated 12 October 1964:

"Elena GARRO [saidl that she and her

daughter were invited

to a party at the cuban

Embassy during the period she now finds out

thats ost was here in Mexico prior to the

assassination. She was invited by a Mexican

secretary in the Cuban Embassy whose husband

is a cousin of the GARRO family (Horacio DURAN].

At the party she saw three Gringos, not

drinking, not mixing and more or less just

standing around together like three bumps on a

log. They were so obviously out of place that

she asked someone in the Cuban Embassy about

them and was told that 'they were just passing

through.' She claims that on the way these

three Gringos stood out she took a good look

at them as did her daughter. When the

assassination occurred and OSWALD'S picture was

spread into the newspapers, both Elena and

her daughter immediately said that he was one

of the three Gringos 'without a doubt' at the

party."

32. GARRO repeated her story to Mr. Charles William

THOMAS, an Embassy political officer on 10 December 1965:

In September 1963 after her return from abroad, she went

to a party, accompanied by her daughter, at the home of

Ruben DURAN (emphasis addedl. Ruben is one of the two

brothers of Horacio DURAN, who married her cousin. She

met osward; and two other young Americans. At the party

she was discouraged from talking with him. Other guests

were the Cuban Consul AZCUE, General Clack FLORES,

Silvia DURAN, who she later learned was OSWALD's mistress

while he was here, Emilio CARBALLIDO and a Latin American

Negro man with red hair (emphasis added]. In November 1963

when the identity of the assassin became known, she and

her daughter went to the Cuban Embassy and shouted

"assassins" and other insults at the staff there.?

Shortly

afterward, she and her daughter were visited by a friend,

Manuel CARVILLO (or CAIVILIO], then an official in the

Secretariat of tie Gobernacion and were told he had orders

in certain particulars signiricantly nodified her earlier

account. She also acknowledged that she and her daughter

had been Daterviewed by Embassy officers to whom she claimed

they did not give a very complete story because the

Embassy officees did not appear to give much credence

anything they said.

34. It developed that GARRO and daughter had been

interviewed by the Legal Attache on 12 and 24 Navember 1964.

Her information had been similar to what she claimed in her

account to THOMAS but had not been substantiated by inquiries.

The FBI representative therefore considered the matter closed

and

reaffirmed his disengagement from the matter to the CIA

Chief of Station on 27 December 1964 and to the Ambassador

on 25 February 1965.

35. The Embassy Relitical Officer, however, persisted in

his interviews and reporting. In a memorandum of conversation,

13 July 1966, GARRO identified the place to which she had been

taken by CALVILLO as the Hotel Vermont.

(This detail checked

out affirmatively: CARRO was at the Hotel 23 - 24, 25 - 27

and 28 - 30 Movember 1963. In another, on 7 February 1967,

GARRO's contending

vicissitudes with the Cubans are set out.

upon

THOMAS's retirement from U.S. Government

36. There the matter rests. GARRO's chronology of the

events she described as having occurred in the Mexican capital

in September 1963 never coincided with the confirmed data

Her story, however, had two

oscar CONTRERAS Lartigue, who claimed to have encountered

OSWALD with other pro-CASTRO students at the

University of Mexico campus in September 1963.

38. In June 1969 CONTRERAS was interviewed by a CIA

officer:

associated in protest aotivity for the Student Revolutionary

Bloc (BER) in January 1961. However, the group ceased

functioning as such in the middle of 1962, and

Oscar CONTRERAS was never one of its leaders. No further

work is reflected in the files on the CONTRERAs allegations.

Apart from the unsustained claims made by CONTRERAS about

his own presence at the University, there is an additional

element that undermines the credibility of his account:

OSWALD's Spanish, which was barely adequate to get him meals

near the hotel, seems hardly likely to have permitted him to

carry on for an extended period with a university student

Nr. Dulles did

Although ir. Angleton thought that the letter should

be written only aiter the CIA report and couments have been

complated, in order to mase the letter as effective as possi

ble, i. Dulles felt it should go now, be phrased in generali-

tles and alloy the soviets nore Ilexibility in their handling

of the matter than would a mors pointed letter based on our

concrete findings.

bir. Dulles asked CIA only for the questions

and not for a draft letter.

suicide,

ment, etc. - AIso Oswald's diary noted that his case had passed

to explain to ir. Dulles the direction of our

thinking about these proposals.

(Note: I Instructed dr. Migren to prepare a

drait of suggosted queries, using the

assistance of DORYABIN and

to have this

ready, 11 possible, by the closa oi

businesg today.)

Rankin stated that the Coumission wants to account

1n dotall, minute by minute and hour by hour, for Oswald's

time outside the United States.

Mr. Bagley suggested that

the narrative chronology of Oswald's stay in the Soviat Union

be convarted to a chronology tabulation which would permit us

wore simply to insert added details and dates as we learned

of them in

other docunentation which we can expect to receiva

shortly. This was agreed.

(Nota: I Instructed sir. Wigren to begin re-

casting the narrative Immediately into

this form.)

Mr. Rankin sald that the Comuission has a waist-high

stack of documents and reports received from the FBI and Secret

Service which CIA has not yet received.

These Include Secret

servico Intertlery with Marina Oswald,

letters fron Lee Oswald

in the USSR and other naterial.

He promised to send this

material to Mr. Helms shortly.

Noto: He will pass appropriate parts of this

material

to DERYABIN for furtber analy-

sis along the lines of his earlier wors

CIA would be unable to naks any seri-

ous analysisjor even nypothesis until some of DaRYABIN's

questions lad been answered.

Mr. Rocca suggested that DERYA-

SIN's paper be recast into nore of a questionnaire form and.

ir. Bagley agreed, pointing out that DoRIABIl's comment and

speculation could be put off to the side as expiznatory coul

ment on ezch question, as approprlate..

hurphy thought that it would be destrable to send this paper

to the Warren Commission in advance of other CIA reports with

a menorandum inforning the Connission that we would need

answers to this interim questionnaire in order to reconstruct

a detailed chronology of Oswald's time in the USSR and to

corment on his activity there.

Would the Comission ba prepared to assuno the

radically different hypothesis or interpretation?

The persons present said that the

Commission would.

If a defector who had contributed to the analy-

sis of the documents should be unwilling to appear person-

ally and jormally before the Conmission, would the

Connission exercise its subpoena powers

against hin?

At. Rankin thought that 11 there was

a risk involved for the defector, the

Commission would not do so. However,

Rankin pronised to get a fornal answer
