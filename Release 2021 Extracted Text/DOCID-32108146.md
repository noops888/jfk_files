I proplem exists with the Cubans, that' the problem with him

(the American) 1s that he does not know anyone in Cuba and

therefore if that 1s true it will be diffioult for him to got a

visa for Cuba, because he was thinking of processing his visa

(for Soviet Union), because he knew it would require waiting a

long time for his visa to the Soviet Union while in Cuba and from

there go to the Soviet Union. MI said the thing is that if his

wife right now were in Washington she would receive her visa

right now, or permission, from the Soviet Union, to return to her

country, she is going to receive her visa in Washington but having

this vize, she could communicate to any place this permission,

cor example here or any place she could receive 1t (visa

or permission)

but right now they do not have them. (no las

One important question still punzles

When OSWALD was in Mexico City in late Sept and early Oct to get a

Soy visa and & Cub transit visa, did he want to travel to Cuba right

away, alone, or have his wife join him there and then leave for Cuba,

or did he plan to return to the Statos first and then leave later.

Although it appears that he was then thinking only about & peaceful

change of residence to the Sov Union, 1t is also possiblo that ho was

getting documented to make a quick escape after assassinating President.

Press reported OSWALD entered Mexioo 26 Sept with tourist card given him

by Mexican Consul in New Orleans on 17 Sept. Press confirmed that

26 Sept OSWALD crossed border by fist Nuevo Laredo, Tamps., the following

day to Mexi City by road. On 27 Sept he went to Cuban Consulate General

to request visa to transit Cuba because he was going to ttes go to Moscow

via Habana. Consul Eusebio AZCUE told OSWALD that he would have to

consult his government, that the paper work required 10 to 12 days.

OSWALD, because of his

Irritable charaoter, became annoyed with AZCUE

and left the office slamming the door.

On 28 Sept OSWALD went to the

Consul General of the Sov Union to request a visa for Russia. He said

in helping his case, that his wife was a Sor citizen; that he was a

militant Communist and had lived three yrs in Russia. OSWALD told the

Sor Consul that he could verify this quiokly by calling his wife who was

at that time in New Orleans in a hotel.

The Sor Consul said he would

have to consult with his government and that ordinarily a case like this

would take from three to four months.

OSWALD again became annoyed as he

had the day before In the Cuban Embassy and left the office very mad.

OSWALD returned to Iexas on 3 Oot via the border of Nuevo Laredo, Tamps.

Investigations so far do not indicate that OSWALD interviewed higher

offloials of the Sor and Cuban Embassies.

no this could not be true because one was a Jew, that it is definitaly

a group of Fasoists, very American, he 1s

and belongs to political gangsters.

Ceollia says it is absurd that

they let him enter (Ruby entering jail where OSWALD vas). Juliete elys

he (Ruby) was there fyom the first day, that he began to mix with th:

police and newspapermen.

It was perfectly planned, indeed some of the

police probably are of the same organization because Ruby mutrkhargau

anothere texastax aimed the gun at hiu chest (OSWALD'S).

Cecilia agrees, the pioture is evidence of that becaule the police

did not move to try to get In or anything for

within a question of

seconds there should have been a reaction.

Julieta ropes they will

continue the investigation; et least Kennedy's brother has sent a special

agent.

Cecilia says everything about it is strange is the paper stated

they found this character (Ruby) drinking Coca Cola on the second floor

and they just left him there.

Jullets adds that fron the & very first

everything was absurd, that he was a Communist.

Cecilia says this type

(OSWALD) could not be nuts because the whole thing was so perfectly

planned'and that is evident since the bullet was aimed at Kennedy.

Julieta believes that this: 1s all done by extreme rightists planned rom

very high up and that is why they had to kill OSWALD so he couldn't talk.

Julieta adds that she hopes they will wake up a little with this business

and pay attention to what has happened because it 1s evident it 1s eil a

conspiracy of rightist groups and military men.

She adds that in a sery

obvious way this individual (OSWALD) pretended he was & Communist to

prepare the groundwork. Cecilia believes that he even purposely married

the Russian girl.

Julieta comments that all was very well prepared,

step by step to blame the Communists, but that now with this (OSWALD's

death) everything is more complicated and they couldn't continue (the

Investigation) and even the Dallas police said that with the death oi

OSWALD the case was closed, but the FBI answered immediately that it vas

and, if things come out, that she hopes the publio will be shaken up

so that they will stop this tendency toward Fascism. Julieta continues

that at the beginning she thought it was caused by racial trouble but

now she thinke It is southing more than that, 1t 1s'a national thing

well planned and that OSWALD was not just aoting spontaneously.

Cecilia

agrees, indeed it was a perfect shot with exact calculation and could not

have been done spontaneously. Julieta says that his (OSWALD's) death

was evidently to shut him up and they had botter not say

now that Ruby

was at the moment emotional (when he shot OSWALD) because, Ruby is the

typo who could never be piotured asa great patriot since he has a

criminal record.

Cecilia believes that Johnson (Pres.) and all those

people are paying attention to the strength in this!

Julleta is sure

of this and adds that the news (press) was rediculous in respect to

OSWALD In that he went to marry a Russian, lator was photographed with the

Dally Workers with the Communist newspaper in one hand and a Troskyist

one in the other hand; thus everything was very well|prepared to blame

the leftists, indeed this has always been the way they have done it,

commit the terrorist acts and then try to make it appear that the acts

wore done by the Communists, that has always been the taotic and only

the people that have no ides about politics can swallow those things.

She adds that this 1s very dangerous, indeed when they are able to assassinate

a president like Kennedy, Imagine how strong they are in the United States.

we suggest Mexicans be Informed concerning Ref A and Nic be put at disposition of LOPEZ

Meteos on condition LOPEZ Mateos will agree to order rearrest and interrogate Silvii DURAN a5

follows, a) Confront Silvia with Nic and have Nic inform her of details his

statenent

to us. b) Tell Sivlia she only living non-Cuber who knows full story and hence

position as OSWALD prior; to his assassination, hei only chance for survival is

clean with whole story and to cooperate completely with Mexi Gov ir return for Mexi Gov

protection.

c) She will not in any case be allowed to leave Mexi.

/ Given apparent

charroter of silvia there would appear to be good, chance of her cracking when confronted

with details of deal between OSWALD, AZCUS, MIRABAL and Silvia and unknown Cubun negro.

If she did break - and we suggest Mexicans should be

asked to go all out in seeing that

ahe does'- we and Mexicans would have needed corroboration of statement of the Nic.

Also suggest Mexi Gov identify and arrest unknown negro.

Have Mexicana rearrest Silvia

so as to eliminate possibility of her being smuggled out of Mexi to Cuba or killed here.

We laok established rellability of Nic, but suggest that DORIICOS' preoccupation with

money sagle tends to corroborate authenticity of Nic statement. Thus, there appears

He presumes KUBARK und

ODENVY will be advised. Sinoe my cable of yesterday (MEXI 7072 - para 97 above) there have

been three principal developments: 1) Amb HERNANDEZ Armas at 1839 hrs last evening valled

DORTICOS of Cuba. In this conversation, which llke the first 1s tered, DORTICOS expressed

continued concern over possibility that Mexi police had Interrogated Silvia about money.

ALVARADO, the No, was questioned by CAs officer until two a.m. this morning.

officer was impressed by ALVARADO who has offered make himself available as a witness and

who is now hiding in place provided by CAS. We cannot guarentee ALVARADO's safety.

of detail ALVARADO gives about events and personalities involved with OSWALD in Cub Emb

1s striking. 3). At 1215 hrs Mext time 27 Nov., CAS officer was admised by phone by

ECHEVERRIA that he lad rearrested Silvia today because he learned she was attemptine to

leave Maxi for Habana. However, Echoverria leter told LEGAT that he had decided to rearrest

Silvia to avoid any possibility she might escapt to Cuba and later be unavailable se i

witness. Since we had received no reply to yesterday's telegrem (MEXI 7072 - her:: " above)

we have not requested Mexi gov to take g any action against Silvia except to maintain

Increased surveillance of her activities.

Echeverria later denied to LEGAT that he lad any

specifio concrete evidence that she was

about to leave for Cuba. We do not now know which

Echeverria statements are accurate.

It is quite possible, and even probable, that cuntra-

dictory statements made by Echeverria are explained by desire of GOM to play down importance

of OSWALD visit here. Mexi line still is that OSWALD visit related solely to visa question.

Consistent| with this Echeverria stated to LEGAT that DORIICOS only interested in finding

out whether Mexi authorlties tried to pay a story from Silvia.

This 1s obviously incrorrect

Interpretation. Neither| LOPEZ Mateor nor Echeverria know of ALVARADO's story.

that according Echeverria Silvia is being taken to Attorney General's office to whick

Mexi press has easy access.

Possiblity of habeas corpus cannot be discounted. 4) la

have as yet found no trace of the red headed Cub negro described by ALVARADO, but are

continuing our search for him.

In addition to questions raised in yesterday's telegram

Washington should urgently consider feasibility of requesting Mexi authorities to arrest

consulate here.! In this connection artiole II of Consular Convention between U. S. and Mexi

exempts frow arrest "Consular officers, national of the state by which they are appointed,

and not engaged in any private occupation for gain" except

"when charged with the comnission

of an act designated by local legislation as crime other than misdemeanor and subjecting

the individual guilty thereof to punishment by imprisoment.

all of these individuals are on ourrent consular list.

have gotten from the press, except for certain incorrect items such as his statement that

OSWALD wore glasses. / The fact that ALVARADO 18| a calm, nice and intelligent young man

does not mean he is not fabricator. Fyi we and other agencies are being flooded by

fabrications on the OSWALD case from several continents sone originating with people on the

fringes of the Intelligence business. Such iabrications are not usually done for money,

but out af dickly fancy and a desire to get into the intel game.

IWe do not think it a

remarkable coinoidence that both DORTICOS and ALVARADO talk about noney paid to OSwaLd.

For one thing, pay for an assassin is a laotor which immediately rises in the mind of

expert and layman alike. Secondly, DORIICOS may have heard through some Russian or Cuban

source in the mexi covernment that DURAN was asked whether the Cuban's paid OSWALD for the

alleged assignment. " While we do not insist that ALVARADO's story is beyond all belief

we do urge that Maxi place it and ALVARADO under the most searching scrutiny. His interro-

gators must probe deeply into his make-up and lead him back through the though processes

which may have led him to a make this possible mis-step.

In securing confessions of

1 fabrication, a sympathetic attitude, stressing awareness of the severe mental strain

the subject must be under, and with' generous recognition of his "basically fine mocivation"

coupled with promises of face-saving secrecy, and even specious hopes of "useful" future

also calims a common-law marriage to Alioia GALVEZ and that a child was born in the u.S.

of this marriage.

Alloia still corresponds with him and lives at Celle Republica d.: Salvador

#152, Col. Cuauhtemoc, Mexicall, Mexi. / In about 1954 he returned to the ranch whe - he

continued with his work on the

ranch. ¡ During 1946 or 57 he was employed by a bottly company

at Iljuans, Mexi which bottled 7-Up.

/ In 1960 he returned to Guadalajara. 1= had no

fixed employment since his Tijuana job with the u-Up bottling fim in 57 or 58., ocosuional

temporary jobs since about 50, mostly involving truckloading. / He married his present wife,

Yolanda CORDOBA in 57 and now has five children;

the youngest born 21. Cet 63.

/ Latters which

have been observed indicate by postmark that ROJAS was in Cozumel, buta at a later rica

than he has stated and apparently for at least three to possibly five months, which contra-

dicts Information received fron Daniel SOLIS, who stated Ylario ROSAS Villanueva ha- 1a Cozumel

for about ? weeks in June 63.

ROJAS readily admits that he, ROJAS, 1s the

wife. / Alverification of his reported travel to the U.S, border, namely, Nuevo Laredo, has

been established, although not on the specific dates furnished by

CMA recorus reflect

one Hilario ROJAS was on flt from Guadalajara to Nuevo Laredo on 3 Aug 62.

CHA racinis

further reflect that a telegran dated 31 July 62 at Nuevo Laredo authorized the CHA icket

office at Guadalajara to' issue a ticket to Hilario ROJAS of 665 Chilarde Street, Guidalajara.

(It is noted that RQJAs has stated that he formerly resided at Chilarde Street in Gundalajara.)

/ ROJAS appears to be in normal physical condition and no outward gigns observed of wuy

deficiency,

He did not reveal any mental quirks.

He tends to be voluble in his

conversa-

tions and to wander from specific lines of questioning. / He appears to react mentsily in a

manner reflecting

innate intelligence superior to that of his stated sixth grade eduration. I

He does not volunteer any motive for furtahing into to the U, S. Gov concerntna id elega

association with unidentified Cubans and with OSWALD, both at U.S, border and at Coumel.

Other than discrepancies anting noted in various interviews conducted with ROJAS,

tie only

apparently unusual development concerns a reportedly second letter that he has directed to

U. S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy, wherein he, according to his on statement,

stuted

that he had additional info to furnish..

According to ROJAS, this additional info

concerned

a so-called camera which he saw in Cozumel in the possession of the

unidentified Buians and

OSWALD, which camera

reportedly had adaptations which could be utilized to

fira abort five

cartridges; which cartridges reportedly have a small gas compartment and that said Las was

for the purpose of cutting down on the noise made in firing said camera.

He also described

a rifle supposedly in the possession of these previously mentioned individuals. He claims to

have beenxgal told by the Cubans that the "camera" was worth about $50,000 and was ü Russian

Invention./ Attitude toward Polygraph Examination; It was explained to ROJAS that it might

be negessary in the future to afford him a scientific examination with the use of certain

instruments.

He said he would be agreeable to such an examination. / Attitude of Mexican

Government re Polygraph Examination;

It is assumed that, as in the past case of the Nic,

Echeverria should be so consulted and his authorization obtained to conduct said exumination.

At the same time, he canialso be told that general results of exam would be furnishi him.

It is further suggested that the full name of ROJAS should be furnished Icheverri: and the

fact that he would be examined either in Guadalajara' or Mexi. There does not apper:

to be

any reason for Echaverria to be furnished the iden of the Polygraph examiner..

on Betty MORA to endeavor to find out any additional info which she might have re OSWALD and

his activities on behalf of the Fair Play For Cuba Committee In New Orleans, La, prior to

the assassination. (See para 264 above) In this connection it will be recalled that MORA

Stated after the death of the President that she hoped that the FBI would not look too hard

In New Orleans because It could be very bad"for us". / Source also reported that Reva BERNSTEIN,

former Chairman of the FPFCC In Detroit, Mich., has been In Mexi for more than a month, that

she had been in Puerto Vallarta for a month, that she had wanted to go to Playa Azul but

that she did not do so because "it was not good to do so - so soon after the assassination",

that she was leaving Mexi to go to Zijuatenejo.

Source does not believe she was in Puerto

Vallarta, nor that she is presently in Zijuatenejo. / BERSTEIN also told source that she had

been questioned in Detroit, prior to her departure for Mexi, by the RCMP, but that no inquiry

had been made of her by the FBI or any U.S. police or Investigative agency.

The interroga-

tion had to do with the FPFCC, Its aotivities in the Detroit

area, and the fact that she had

reportedly acted as a mail drop for Canadian communists.

OSWALD had departed from Mexi on the bus connected therewlth which left Mexi at 1:00 p.m.

Mexi, Monterrey and Laredo, but is

not permitted to sell tickets or pick up passenzers at

numberas available and recording opposite the seat number assigned, the name and destination

of the Individual requesting the reservations.

That reservation is respected under normal

conditions until two hours before departure time; however, in the event all seats

"filled, it may be held until the actual departure of the bus.

Prior to the departure of

the bus, a final check 1s made of passengers In connection with tickets sold for that

particular trip, and at that time the dispatcher communicates by radio to the company

headquarters in Monterrey the number of "paying" passengers on the bus: in relation to the

Monterrey or Laredo destinations for which they purchased tickets.

/. Francisco ALVARADO,

tioket salesman and dispatcher for Iransportes Frontera, advised that he prepared most of

the handwriting on the 2 Oct 63 manifest on which the name "OSULD" and destination "Lared"

appear opposite Seat No. 4.

He stated that he did not write the

"OSWLD" reservation info

and it was his opinion that the reservation had been made and the info recorded by the

baggage handler, Lucio LOPEZ.

ALVARADO is quite certain at the present time that the

Individual designated on the list as "OSWLD" did not purchase a ticket and did not travel

on the trip relating to that manifest.

No ticket number was recorded for that person,

a search of the company's records in Monterrey had failed to locate a ticket stub which

was not otherwise accounted for in connection with that particular trip. I The notations

by ALVARADO of "9 Laredo, T Monterrey" reflected that he had reported by radio to the

Monterrgy office of the company that the bus had departed with nine "paying" passengers

for Laredo and seven "paying" passengers destined for Monterrey.

Listed under "Name of

Passengers" were "OSWLD" with no ticket number, indicating he did not travel; "Angel PEREZ"

with no ticket number or destingtion, which confirmed that he had not purchased a ticket

and had not boarded the bus; and "Nicolas GONZAIEZ" Seat No. 10, listed as having traveled

on a pass to Torreon.

/.../ ALVARADO and Gilberto LOZANO stated that the notations on

the back of the manifest referred to advances of funds made by ALVARADO to LOZANO from the

cash for repairs, parts or other requirements. They related that the passenger lists

are not kept as a permanent record, and, when the manifest was located in the "trash"

at the request of investigators of the Mexi Presidential Staff, the Blanks at the tope

of the form had not been filled In as to time, destination, trip number, bus number, and

date, but they had completed those blanks from their personal knowledge

in order to make

that data clear to the Investigators. They also had listed the names of the drivers on the

formax at that tice.

They affirmed that the handwritten "Transportes Frontera" at the top

of the document had been added by some official of the Mexi Government after the document

was borrowed from them. / Both LOZANO and ALVARADO stated that they had no recollection

OSWALD, etc...:.. they could offer no explanation as to how Mexican authorities had arrived

at the conclusion that OSWALD had travelled on the Transportes Frontera bus of 2 Oct 63,

but pointed out that after the name was located on the manifest, they had not been given

an opportunity of reviewing, analyzing or checking out the data thereon. / Lucio LOPEz.

Medina, baggage and freight handler at Transportes, related that ho often assists the

/ The book "The Assassins of President Kennedy" indicates OSWALD was little more thru a

"patsy" in a conspiracy put together by a number of men.

The 24 yr old was used. according

to Buchanan, to (a) acquire the rifle used in K slaying, (b) facilitate the entrance into

the Dallas Book Depository of a marksman and (e) cover up for the rest of the gang by accepting

full guilt for the crime. Buchanan claims that Dallas Policeman Iippit,

who was not down

by OSWALD shortly following the assaspination, had as his "job" the

"silending"' of OSWALD

but thet OSWALD was quioker on the draw. / Buchanan - whose conclusions are also supported

by N.Y. Civil Rights Attorney Mark Lane, appearing before the Warren Com.

"representing"

sloin OSWALD - also claims that there was a sniper it the underpass bridge under

the kennedy motorcade was moving and that this sniper also oyened fire. / He says this

sniper might have been rUBY, who showed up following the killing in the office ji the

Morning News," the only building of quiok, sure access for the sniper on the bridge. His

conclusion is olear - that Ruby gunned down OSWALD in the police station just as it:

feared OSWALD was ready to "spill" the whole story.

basis of sign language and the word "taxi" which he understood that OSWALD wanted a taxicab,

RODRIGUEZ walked around the corner from the hotel where he obtained a taxicab. He believed

OSWALD left the hotel between 0630 and 0700 since it was getting light when he went in

search of the taxicab.

He could not be more precise concerning the time. He believed

OSWALD gave him a small tip of one or twó pesos.

OSWALD carried his own luggage downstairs

and waited in front of the hotel with the luggage until RODRIGUEZ returned with the taxicab.:

RODRIẞUEZ commented that while he had little difficulty obtaining a taxi at the early hour,

It becomes very difficult to secure taxi transportation between 0730 and 0830 because of the

heavy traffic at that time.

RODRIGUEZ related that OSWALD always arrived at the hotel late

without wearing &

coat???

at hight, "midnight or thereafter", but he never noticed any indication that OSWALD hadi been

drinking.

could also well be that OSWALD first spoke

Also; given the apparent frankness

lost trace of OSWALD, although the CIA was prewarned to keep a careful check on OSWALD

because of his connections with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee..... (Note by COS: What a

given a 5,000 ruble lump sun payment prior to going to Minsk. Thereafter, he received 700

-rubles per month as wages and an additional 700 rubles per month from the KGB.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD from Flannery (C/CA) -Elena GARRO told Eunice Odio (who relayed to

TICHBORN on 9 Oot) that she and her duaghter were invited to a party at the Cuban Emb during

the period she now finds out that OSWALD was here in Mext prior to the assassination. She

was invited by a Mexi secretary in the Cub Emb whose husband 18 a cousin of the GARRO

family (Horacio DURAN????)!

At the party, she saw three Gringos, not drihking, not mixing,

and nore or less just standing around together like "three bumps lon a log"i

They were so

obviously out of place, she asked someone in the Cub Emb about them and was told that "they

were just passing shn through". I She claims that on account of the way these three gringos

stood out she took a good long look at them as did her daughter. | When assassination occurred

and OSWALD's picture was spread into the newspapers, both Elena and her daughter Immediately

said that he was one of the three gringos "without a doubt" at the party.

covering: above memo to COS: Do you want me to send the sist of this to Has? dos vrote.

Yes, but we should follow up first. Flannery then wrote, Nothing further.

DIR 56876 (Refs. MAXI 1191 - para 397 above) Has has no evidence that Sovs have advance copy

of photo.

Comm sources assure us 1te

copy of photo furnished by the FBI has also béen

altered to black out the background.

At present the annex is scheduled for release around

mid Nov. / Considered opinion here 1s that Sov action par ref would seem to be a logical CI

step as a precautionary measure on bdais of published.comm roport. That a thorough:

security survey should be done at this time either on Sov Emb's own initiative or on reavest

from Moscow 1s not at all surprising, Independently of any specifice containea in Coum repori.

of a CSCI to the FBI reporting an incident which might be connected with the assassination..

(attachment is para 409 below)

MEMO TO FBI from WOFACT - An untested source recently furnished us with the foll info he

allegedly received fron a well known Cuban solentist and acquaintance on 23 Nov 63, but which

he had forgotten to report. The release of the Warren Comm Report reminded him of the inci-

dent. / The scientist said he had been at the Havaha alrport on afternoon of 2? Nov 63 when

at 1700 hrs an aircraft with Mexi markings landed and parked at far side of the field.

Iwo men, whom he reoognized as Cuban & "gangsters" alighted, entered rear entrance of

administration bldg and disappeared without going through normal customs procedures.

His

curlosity was aroused, and he was able to learn that the aircraft had just arrived from

Dallas, Texas, via IIJuana and Mexi CIty. The plane had been forced to land at lijuana due

to engine trouble.

By combining the date, the origin of the flight, and the known reputation

of the two men, he theorized that the two men must have been involved in assassination..

He speculated that OSWALD had acted in the pay of Castro, and that the two Cubans had been

In Dallas to organize or oversec the operation. He told the source that he had been greatly

distressed by what he had seen and heard and had to telll someonc about it. He then cautioned

source not to tell anyone else

about it or they would ham both be shot by the Cubans. /

During this latter conversation, Elena admitted she had gone to Amenb on an earliar occasion

with her daughter and mother-in-law and talked to two Emb officers (presumably fron. LEGAT) about

this matter.

they did not bother to give a very complete story.

Elena described some developments which may have some bearing on ber claim that she saw

OSWALD at a party at home of her cousin. Ruben DURAN when OSWALD was in Mexico prior to

assassination.

/ Elena said Carlos SOLORZANO 1s well acquainted with Qub Amb HERNANDEZ

Armas, and that he was not leftist but his brother, Alfonso, was a Communist. Amb liRANDDEZ

told SOLORAANO he wanted to meet Elena, so SOLORZANO arranged a party at his oun ene

30 June 66 and Invited both of them.

Also present were Tito MONIEROSO and his wife;

Elvira VARGAS, leftist Journalist with NOVEDADES and personal friend of Pres DIAZ Ordaz;

Emanuel CARBALLO, the pro-Castro writer; Joaquin DIAZ Canedo, head of publishing firin

called Editorial Mortiz; and Juan SORIANO, painter, who was invited to make her feel at

ease, since he is & friend of hers and was the only anti-Communist there besides herself.

/ During evening, Amb HERNANDEZ, whom she described as intelligent and cultured, cucen-

trated his attention on her..... and expressed interest in her friend, Carlos MADRAZO.

He issued a personal invitation to her to attend the annual literary festival of the Casa

de las Americas In Havana, She said she was not a Fidelista and would not go unless.

Juan SORIANO went with her. Amb HERNANDEZ then Invited SORIANO but the latter denounced

the Castro regime over the objections of the others present...../ Later, her friend,

Victor RICO Galan who personally dislikes Amb HERNANDEZ warned her not to go to Cuba alone.

/ On 4 July 66 a driver from the Cub Emb delivered to her home on Calle Alencastre in

Lomas Virreyes an envelope containing two letters and some printed matter from the Casa

de las Americas In Havana.

The first letter, written last October (66?) gave her sadress

as Vermont 38 and the second letter, written in April, gave her address as Vermont 39.

The envelope for the first letter, with the above address, was marked for return to the

which was the Cub Emb here.

The second envelops, which contained the whole pkg,

had no address as it was hand carried to her home - see attachments. / Elena stateú the

only reason the letters were addressed to her at Calle Vermont was

because she spent several

days at the Hotel Vermont after the assassination.

The correct address of the hotel is

Vermont 29, so she concluded the Cub Gov carried that street and number, with a minor

error, as her regular address. / Since CALVILLO had taken her to the hotel ostensilly to

protect her from the Connunists, this raised the question of how the Cubans obtained that

PALOMARES and Pres. DIAZ Ordaz, and that guards, presumably from Gobernacion, had been

placed outside her home when she returned from the Hotel Vermonth....../ Elena thought 1t

possible that the Cub Emb had deliberately given her the letters from the Casa de las

Amaricas with the Vermont Street address in order to frighten her.

She was already con-

cerned about what appeared to be three gunshots that had been fired through her upstairs
