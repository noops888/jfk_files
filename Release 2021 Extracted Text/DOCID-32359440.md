I. ANTI-CASTRO ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES

Efforts of Cuban exiles based in the United States since

the fall of Batista and the assumption of power by the Castro

regime on 1 January 1959 have been characterized by continu-

ally shifting alliances aimed at securing for their leaders

a paramount position in any successor government in their

homeland.

Programs have been enunciated by individual leaders,

organization lists drawn up, and funds solicited. Consider-

able propaganda has been published, and leaflets attacking

Castro have been dropped over Cuba periodically. Some mili-

tary and paramilitary training has been undertaken, particularly

in the Dominican Republic where a force ranging from a claimed

80 men to several thousand has been

training for the past

nine months.

Some exiles claim to have armed followers

in

Cuba as well as a larger number of sympathizers.

There has

been one abortive invasion attempt.

These efforts have been weakened, however, by rivalries

between the more prominent exiles for

leadership of any for-

mal anti-Castro movement established, and their failure to

agree on any program. Their activities also have been affected

by the fact that most of the exiles

were connected either

actively or passively with the Batista regime.

They

recognize,

although they do not always admit this, that Batista's rule

1s still too unpopular with the mass of Cubans for them to

engage in a successful effort to overthrow Castro unless they

are supported by a force far larger than any can command.at

present.

These rivalries plus Castro's followers' long training

in revolutionary methods appear to have enabled Castro to

learn the plans of most of the alliances formed thus

far well

before they are put into action.

Nevertheless there has been, and continues to be, a general

recognition by most of the more prominent exiles that

they

must

unite if they are to succeed in removing the present re-

gime.

The

most important

potential leaders of any such move-

ment to emerge so far are listed below under separate headings.

A. General Jose Eleuterio PEDRAZA Y Cabrera

When mention is made of military measures to eliminate

the Castro regime attention inevitably focuses on General

Jose Eleuterio PEDRAZA y Cabrera.

While opinions differ

as to his

suitability for the role of leader of a military

attack on the Castro forces, he is regarded by the most

prominent and most active exile leaders in the United States

as the only military leader in a position to take effective

action in the field against Castro.

The forces at his disposal

in the Dominican Republic,

the loyalties he can command within Cuba,

and the help he

can

get from exiles in the United States

have been variously

estimated from a mere handful to several thousand. He,

himself, has stated in a memorandum to a prominent American

businessman that he hoped he could count on a force of 2,000,.

led by 100 former Officers and Non-Commissioned officers of

Cuban origin.

The remainder of his force would be made up

of Spaniaras, Yugoslavs, Germans, and perhaps a few Dominicans. (

PEDRAZA has

expressed his willingness to work with General

Martin DIAZ Tamayo and Colonel Ramon BARQUIN and would wel-

come their cooperation but he has never hinted that he would

turn over leadership of his forces to either.

who claims to have been one of the prime organizers of two

The Christian Democratic Action (ADC) has backed PEDRAZA as

the military leader ofzany expedition which should be launched

against Fidel Castro.

Rodriguez claims to have visited the

General late in October 1959 and to have reached an agreement

whereby Pedraza committed himself to clean up his force of

men in the Dominican Republic and put them under the direc-

tion and control of

the ADC.

Rodriguez asserts that the

agreement provides for the elimination of all but Cuban

nationals from the forces in the Dominican Republic under

Pedraza.

Fabio FREYRE, a wealthy young Cuban--who also claims

to be the founder

of the ADC--has made known his connections

vith pedraza and claims to have drawn up points of agreement

N1th him.

Freyre has

He adds that Pedraza was not closely identified with

Batista's

was made head of the army.

DI. Emilio NUNEZ Portuondo, now resident in Washington,

D.C., and one of the more prominent

anti-Castro exiles, has

consistently tried to align the various anti-castro elements

in the United States, Mexico, and Cuba behind General Pedraza. (J)

Carlos MARQUEZ Sterling, who at the moment appears to be

Pedraza's choice for provisional president, if efforts to

unseat Castro succeed has

supported the military role of the

General. (6)

General Pedraza's service under Fulgencio Batista has

left a bad taste in the mouths of many Cubans who hated the

Batista dictatorship as vehemently as they now detest the

Castro regime.

There seems to be reasonable doubt that Dr.

CUERVO-RUBIO,

whom RODRIGUEZ Couceiro has claimed CRAC sup-

ports as a presidential candidate, would support Pedraza.

CUERVO-Rubio is reported to have stated that responsible

opposition to Castro inside Cuba would be reluctant to asso-

ciate with Pedraza and might join in the fight against him

should he attempt an invasion.

Some of these people have

repeatedly expressed the fear that Castro might use such

an invasion as a pretext to suppress all opposition. (7)

Prom-

inent Orthodox Party leader Antonio VARONA also is

reported

to be worried about the possibility of an invasion of Cuba.

to whom he is bitterly opposed and has sworn

that he and

a distinct possibility that a Pedraza led invasion would play

Recent evi-

dence, however,

indicates that there is a possibility that

the former Chief of the Revolutionary Air Force may be

reconsidering his previously inflexible attitude towards

Pedraza.

B. Emilio NUNEZ Portuondo

NUNEZ Portuondo, now residing in Washington, D.C., was

one of the first to declare his candidacy for

the leadership

anti-Castro movement.

A tormer politician,

and diplomat Nunez was Cuba's delegate to the United Nations

from 1952 until 1958.

During this period he cooperated with

the US delegation and was outspokenly critical of the USSR.

Most Cubans in the United States, and in those Latin American

countries where he and his followers have solicited support

for their anti-Castro activities

are under the impression that

he has some type of commitment with the US Government. Al-

though he continues to be mentioned, along with carlos

MARQUEL Sterling, as the most likely candidate for provisional

president of a successor government to castro, some sources

have alleged that he would not make an effective president. (1)

Nunez' announced aim is the overthrow of the Castro re-

gime and its replacement by a civil government friendly to

the US and excluding individuals associated with Batista.

To this end he and his immediate followers have published

newsletter and periodically dropped leaflets over Cuba at-

tacking Castro.

They also have directed the paramilitary.

In addition Nunez and his followers have been

in close contact with other leading exiles in the US. Dur-

ing the fall of 1959 he and his adherents travelled to Mexico,

Guatemala, Panama, Argentina and Peru to solicit support for

anti-Castro movement. They also have attempted to organize

units

in Venezuela. (3)

There is no firm evidence that these efforts have suc-

ceeded.

Another possible adherent of Nunez is Pedro DIAZ-Lanz,

who is reported to have declared that he, and other with

whom he is working, would consider Nunez acceptable if he

should divorce himself from Trujillo.

A step in this direc-

tion was taken by Nunez at the end of December when,

irritated by Trujillo's reluctance to permit a Pedraza

invasion of Cuba from the Dominican Republic, he told

Trujillo that he would take matters in his own hands

C. Carlos MARQUEZ Sterling

Carlos MARQUEZ Sterling comes from a family with a dis-

tinguished record in Cuban History.

He was born in 1899 in

Camaguay and received his education in Cuba, graduating

from the University of Havana with a law degree in 1920.

Three years later he became a professor at the University.

Washington while his father was Ambassador.

Later he re-

sentatives. He had a hand in the establishment of the

Ortodoxo Party in 1946.

Previously Marquez had presided

over the drafting of the Constitution of 1940.

D. Pedro Luis DIAZ-Lanz

Major DIAZ-Lanz has gained considerable publicity for his

break with Castro, his appearance before the Eastland Com-

mittee and his spectacular leaflet dropping over Havana on

21 October 1959.

His brother Marcos, who was Inspector General

of the Revolutionary Air Force (FAR)

joined him in Miami in

July and the two were until December closely associated with

Ricardo LORIE Valls, a former underground leader of the

26 July Movement.

These three and a few other associates

have professed to have vigorous plans to overthrow Castro

out aside from the leaflet drop have noy performed any par-

ticular actions ot special importance.

The Diaz-Lanz brothers

broke with Lorie, who appeared to have been the most mature

member of the group, for reasons which are not al all clear. (2)

The small group about Diaz-Lanz in conversation with U.S.

officials and private

citizens has steadfastly refused to

have anything to do with former Batista officials while they

have stated their intention to take any measures to insure

the downtall of Castro.

In July 1959 Pedro DIAZ-Lanz stated that there is no

connection whatsoever between the anti-Castro forces in Cuba

and those in the United States.

He regarded the tollowers

roguld not be acceptable to the Counter.

At the end of the year, however, Pedro

DIAZ-Lanz was reported as being willing to support Nunez

Portuondo if the latter would break with Trujillo. At the

same time Diaz-Lanz is reported

to have artempted

to obtain

$50,000 from agents

of Pedraza in Miami.

If this attempt

actually was made, it seems to indicate at last a willingness

on the part of Diaz-Lanz to work with Pedraza,

something he

had hitherto steadfastly refused to consider.

in September 1959 Jose SUAREZ Nunez, a Cuban exile arrived

in Miami to deliver instructions from Batista to Piedra to

attempt to immediately consolidate the anti-Castro forces

into a viable movement to overthrow the Castro government.

Batista reminded Piedra that there should be no involvement

with the Dominican Government and advised him that to the

greatest extent possible groups should be cultivated which

are now or might be expested to be looked upon with favor

by the U.S. Government:

Enrique FERNANDEZ Parajon, former

Chief of the Secret Police under Batista was reported

January 1960 as endeavoring to merge a group under the

leadership of Orlando PIEDRA with the ADC.

He added that

the PIEDRA group has three planes which they would like to

use during the next 60 days to set fire to sugar cane

fields by dropping incendiaries.

However, FERNANDEZ bemoaned

the fact that tight United States controls in Florida were

hampering

their activities.

Fernandez said that he is in
