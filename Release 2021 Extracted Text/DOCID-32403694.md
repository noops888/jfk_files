MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT : Meeting with HSCA Staff Representatives

1.

Last night at 2000 hours Messrs. Hawkins, Sturbitts,

Sednauoui, Shepanek, Holmes, Joannides and the undersigned

met with Messrs. Blakey and Goldsmith of the HSCA staff.

The purpose was

to consider the declassification of cer-

tain materials for use in Mr. Helms' testimony in public

hearings on Friday, 22 September.

2. A number of questions were resolved at the time

with a few remaining to be left over for today. One of the

unresolved issues was declassification of certain sections

of the 1967 IG report on plotting against Castro.

extensive deletions.

I pointed out that when the question

arose with the Church Committee it did not do so in the

context of public hearings.

Instead, the Committee wrote

addressed those issues on a point-by-point basis. We

asked that they tell us what specific things they would

like declassified, which we could address more easily,

noting that much

of the substantive content of the IG

report had found its way into the Church Committee Report.

Mr. Goldsmith said that he could narrow this down to some

ten or so pages, and we postponed further discussion until

today.

Mr. Blakey said that Mr. Helms' attorney wanted

to be advised by the Agency of those sections of his

(EXECUTIVE REBISTRY PILE Spec InT."

testimony, including the related documents,

and transmit it to
