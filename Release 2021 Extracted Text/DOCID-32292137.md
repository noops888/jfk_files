RE: DOMINIC MOIO (deceased) Suspect and

Girlfriend ANGELINE CONSTANTINO

PAUL CLAUTTI, PCI, advised ANGELINE CONSTANTINO, former

gIrlfriend of MOIO, had visited him recently at the store

on two

occasions. On one of these occasions, she was about to tell him

something regarding BILLY NAPLES, but she was interrupted by a

customer and never completed what she was to say.

advised that CONSTANTINO had told him that she believed the

NAPLES brothers were responsible for MOIO's death, and she

warned Molo prior to his death to stay away from the NAPLES.

stated she never explained to him why she was so afraid of the

NAPLES.

As to how he

met MOIO, PCI stated he had first met

MOIO at the Gaytimes Tavern operated by CONSTANTINO.

After seeing

him several times there, he struck up a conversation with him and

learned he was from Canton and was in Youngstown doing plaster

work.

He then introduced MOIO to CONSTANTINO and he feels

certain they had not known each other previously.

He said within

a few days MOIO was behind the bard the Gaytimes.

PCI stated later he learned MOIO was very friendly

with NAPLES (BILLY), but never learned the circumstances under

which they met or why they became so friendly.

PCI advised he recently met LOU TORMA (ph) real name

LOUDS, LAPORIS, who is employed by the NAPLes brothers in the

United Music Company, who came to his store to buy electronics

parts. He stated he was accompanied by a man believed to be

PAUL HOLOVATICH, a chief suspect in the CAVBOMB case. He asked

LAPORIS how the business was coming, and he replied that they were

being bothered by the local police and the "Federals". At this

point, the man believed to be HOLOVATICH stated "Those S.O.B.s".

on 7/14/64, CV 421-C-TE advised that he had been

taken to MIKE ROMEO of Youngstown,

brother of PAUL ROMEO, whom

source described as a 'Mafia member". Source stated that MIKE

had told him that Mrs DE NIRO, mother of slain Youngstown racketeer,

VINCE DE NIRO (bombed to death 7/17/61) had paid a sum of money

to DOMINIC MOIO (deceased) to avenge the death of her son.

Source

stated that MIKE told him that MOIO came to Mrs DE NIRO with the

proposition. Source stated that in this particular instance, in

his opinion

MOIO was

simply being an opportunist since he had

probably already received the contract from the "Cleveland

syndicate"

•to avenge DE NIRO's death. Source stated that

subsequently MOIO did actively participate in the bombing-death

Of BILLY NAPLES (7/1/62), whom the syndicate felt was responsible

for the bombing death of VINCE DE NIRO.

Source reiterated the fact that subsequently MOIO

was responsible for ánd

actively participated in the bombing-death

of CHARLES CAVALLARO and His son (ai/23/62)s and, föthe HAPLiS.,

brothers, JOEY and JIMMY, and that MOIO was subsequently eliminated

by the

"Cleveland syndicate" for his participation in the

CAVALLARO bombing.

RE: CHARLES CAVALLARO

In about 1955. He said for about three or four months in 1957,

trucks which they used to haul gravel from Pennsylvania to Liberty

Township, north of Youngstown, where

a sewer line was being installed.

The business was not successful and folded up after about four months.

PCI stated he had never gone into business with CAVALLARO

after that time and although they continued to be friendly, they

were never close. He stated he would see him occasionally

at NICK

BARONE's wine shop, Watt Street, Youngstown.

He stated he never knew

CAVALLARO was involved in gambling or bookmaking.
