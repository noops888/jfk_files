SUPERVISORS CONFERENCE NOTES

#9-75 (5/6/75)

Senstudy 75

Captioned matter pertains to Bureau's handling of

requests from Senate and House Select Comnittes to study

Governmental operations with respect to intelligence activitles.

In connection with work of these committes, staff members may

seek to interview current and former FBI employees.

Recently, the Senate Select Committee (SSC) staff

has interviewed several former employees and it is antici-

pated that many more such personnel will be contacted.

The FBI has pledged full cooperation with the committe

and we wish to assist and facilitate any investigations undertaken

by the committee with respect to the FBI. However, we do have

an obligation to insure that sensitive sources and methods and

ongoing sensitive investigations are fully protected. Should

any former employee contact your office and have any question

regarding his obligation not to divulge information obtained by

virtue of his past FBI employment, he should be instructed to

contact Legal Counsel, FBIHQ, by collect call.

Yous conver-

sations with former employees must be in keeping with our

pledge. It is believed such a procedure would insure proper

protection and also facilitate the work of the SSc.

The above procedure also applies to current employees

of this office. However, contact with the Legal counsel should

be handled through the SAC.
