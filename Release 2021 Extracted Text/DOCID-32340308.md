ACTIVITIES AND AFFILIATIONS

Publication of "The

Yugoslav Herald®®

CG T-3 on November 12, 1963, furnished the following

information:

It was stated that it had been learned that

subject as Editor

and Chief under the name ANDREW L. KONDICH.

The publisher and managing editor was listed as DUIS KUTNER.

The first and only issue of this publication was dated

October 1, 1963, and was printed in the Serbo-Croatian

language•

It consisted of eight pages. It was stated

that this paper was reportedly printed

at 448 West Barry

Avenue, Chicago, the headquarters of the Dusan Silni

Club, which was stated to also print a newspaper called

"Serbian Struggle" It was explained that Mr. KUTNER iS

a prominent Chicago attorney who has been active in

such organizations as B'nal B'rith and the Anti-Defamation

League of Chicago. It was stated, however, that subsequent

to the publication of this paper, KUTNER and KONDICH

had had a violent disagreement.

As a result of this

difficulty, KUTNER will now have nothing to do with

KONDICH and no additional issues of the paper are to be

printed. The opinion was expressed by CG T-3 that KUTNER

probably financed the paper under the belief that it could

be profitable.

It was stated that a copy of this publication

had been made available to the owner of "Abendpost" in

which location subject was employed as editor.

pay the subject to the termination of his agreement but

his presence at the newspaper will no longer be tolerated.

The opinion was

expressed that this would take place

within a week.

It was pointed out that subject as editor of

"Abendpost" had continued to take every means to prevent

articles from appearing in "Abendpost" which would reflect

unfavorably on Communist issues.

An actual example was

described in which an article from another German newspaper

was furnished to KONDICH to be printed in the "Abendpost".

This article gave factual data concerning incidents

involving TITO's Partisan Army which fought in Yugoslavia

and which forces killed American airmen who were forced

down in Yugoslavia.

After this article was given to KONDICH and it

was noted that it was not printed, a thorough search of

the printing room was made by the printer and a member

of "Abendpost" in an effort to determine where this

article had been placed.

When the article could not be

found, subject was confronted and after a little search,

made the article available.

On another occasion a letter

was received from a customer of "Abendpost" setting

forth extensive information taken from the Congressional

record of October 14,

1963, indicating opposition to

the visit of President TITO of Yugoslavia.

After complaints

were received pertaining to the final printing of this

article, it was determined that subject had deleted

everything from the original article which opposed Communism

or denounced the visit of TITO to the United States. In

respect to the visit of TITO to the United States, subject

was heard to express pleasure over the fact that TITO

had been invited to visit the United States and expressed

hope that he would have a pleasant stay while here.

In

the course of conversations with subject concerning TITO

and Communism, he again pointed out that it was foolish

to oppose Communism since it was bound to come into force

anyway and cited the fact that even the president of the

United States welcomed TITO, a Communist, to this country.

It was learned that subject

had been made a member of the Sudaton American-German organization,

described as a social group, and CG I-4 made the comment that this

was most unusual because membership required German ancestry, and

furthermore to be a member one should have been active for many

This

organization was described as athletic in its general background

but extremely nationalistic and anti-German.

this organization that when the communists took over Czechoslovakia

the communists alsc took over this Sokol and permitted it to exist.

It. was further learned that subject, during the course of conversatio

Czechoslovakia.

in Prague but he did not explain how or why.

occasions exhibited & violent hate toward rEIChEL, made threatening

remarks and made the comment that REIChel would regret his actions.

On several occasions richel was actually afraid that subject would

take physical violence against him.

It was further pointed out that

subject had used the nane of rEICHel in articles printed in'Abendpost'

pertaining to German organizations without the permission of REICHEL

financial ability to afford
