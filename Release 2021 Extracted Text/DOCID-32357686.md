"I. A CIA report of 1961 lists him as a UN correspondent

then planning an unsponsored trip to East Germany, Poland,

Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. Dutch corespondents said that they

had yet to see a story written by him. When he applied for

membership in the UN correspondents' association, he was unable

to produce a single clipping in support of the application. He

travels extensively. He has excellent contacts in all Communist

countries including Cuba.

"g. The Hague Post of 15 April1951, with a nationwide

readership, characterized OLIMANS as an intimate friend of the

then President of Indonesia, SUKARNO, and as having tried for

five years to arrange contacts for SUKARNO in Holland.

"h.. An FBI report of 24 November 1961 restates the above

and adds that he had been separated or divorced from his American

wife 18 months earlier because "he is not a man'. He was living

with a male at the time of the report.

She said

that ten minutes after her wedding ceremony with OLIMANS was over,

she

was alone.

Her father, she said, learned that OLIMANS had

police record for molesting young boys in Amsterdam. She obtained a

Mexican divorce in 1960. She®

said that OLIMANS is at least

intellectually a Communist and believes that Communism is the

economic system of the future.

"j. HAGU-1365, 24 October 1966, says OLIMANS wrote pro-

LUMUMBA articles in 1960, visited Cuba in 1962 and perhaps 1963,

developed friendly relations with Chicoms at The Hague and may

have visited China in 1964. In August 1966 he applied for a Chicom
