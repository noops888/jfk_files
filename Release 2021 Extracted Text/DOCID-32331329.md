to kill them, except for informant's intercession. Informant

commented that he, JOE CASEY and CHARLIE THE BLADE were then

staying at the Regent Hotel in Newark, New Jersey, on the lam

in quarters provided by the "BOOT".

Informant

said that he has no particular knowledge

of CASEY's killer but would be alert for any information

he

might receive concerning this matter.

He commented that he

feels it would not be logical that RICHIE BOIARDO would have

anything to do with it because if he were so inclined,

he would have had CASEY killed at the time CASEY leftelim on

the street following an unsucessful effort to kill RICHIE

BOIARDO many years

ago.

Periodic spot checks conducted at subject's residence

and know hangouts in the New York City area were conducted
