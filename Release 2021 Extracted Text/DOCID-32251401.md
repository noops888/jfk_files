Answer:

Lee Harvey Oswald had to enter his work

schedule into a spiral notebook called "An Oiler's Log."

Mr. Barbe stated that this 1og

was written different from

the other oilers. Oswald, in Barbe's opinion, was either

trying to determine if anyone read the log or was trying

to glorify his job. The notebook contained entries such as

"changed master tapes," "checked millimeters of machine,"

or words to that effect. These books were given to the FBI
