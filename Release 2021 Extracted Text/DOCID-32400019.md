MESKIC, dated circa April 1975 and 13 June 1976, specifying

that one Marie LORENZ was involved with Frank STURGIS and Alex

Furthermore, the

articles again allege that STURGIS and RORKE were acting on

behalf of this Agency.

The 13 June 1976 article further alleges

Marie LORENZ has *claimed that

at the direction of STURGIS and

RORKE

(and the Agency and the FBI) in 1960 she went to Cuba to

poison CASTRO.. The poison was given to her by STURGIS. In the

first article Marie LORENZ alleges that E. Howard HUNT, known

to her as "Eduardo" was the paymaster for STURGIS and RORKE.

HUNT has publicly claimed not knowing STURGIS until at least

the late 1960's.
