MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

oscar CONCEPC I ON MENDOZA (SICAPRICE- (SLCAPRICE-1)

The following information was uncovered during a review

of Cuban operational files. It should be brought to the attention

of C/LA/COG, and made a part of SLCAPRICE-l's official 201 file:

a .

A conversation from a telephone tap of the Cuban

Embassy in Mexico City, 22 November 1963: Marta, Oscar's wife,

tells LLAGOSTERA (Jose LLAGOSTERA Garcia, gardner at the Cuban

Embassy in Mexico City and reportedly G-2) to tell Oscar that

he forgot some of the candy. LLAGOSTERA says that their plane

will not arrive until 1615 hours.

Marta is sending the candy

to someone in Cuba and she doesn't want Oscar to forget it.

LLAGOSTERA tells Marta that a good man died today. Marta replied

really, who? KENNEDY, says LLAGOSTERA. Marta laughs,. tells

LLAGOSTERA not to forget to tell Oscar about the candy. (Copy

of tape is attached.)

b. From SLCAPRICE-l's 201 file: In 1964 AMNIP-1

(Miguel ROCHE Monroy - DGI defector) suggested to SLCAPRICE-1

that the latter meet with CIA to talk about ridding Cuba of

Communism.

S=] was

non-committal. S-l met with Bob Shaw_in

1964. S-1 was recruited by CIA in 1975. During a debriefing

at that time, S-l said that he reported to the DGI in 1964

AMNIP-1's recruitment pitch to him, but said that he did

mention Bob Shaw's name.
