Michoud

P. A.

On March 1, 1957, I contacted ir. Delaha and reiayed the following

information to him:

We have Mir. Marochini's updated PiR. If anything comes up that

fir. Larochini's capable of performing, we will be glad to consider

him for it.

Since he has been over here numerous times recently

and there has been no significant change in employment requirements

that would benefit Mir. Marochini, I advised Mr. Delaha that I did

not feel that an interview was warranted at this time.

I advised him that we would continue to review Mr. liarochini's

qualifications against any future requirements, however, our non-

skilled employment requirements were becoming very infrequent

because of the status of the program.

I asked ir. Delaha if he

would please talk to Mr. Marochini and acknowledge our receipt oi

his letter requesting an interview and to relay the information

that he (lir. Delaha) and I had discussed over the phone.

I understand that my application is for employment by Chrysler Corp-

oration, Space Division, and that proper clearance for purposes of

security for the national defense of the United States is required

in connection with such employment.

Therefore, I voluntarily consent-

to a thorough investigation of my past employment and other activities.

I understand further that the failure of any United States Government"

Agency to clear me will be sufficient grounds for immediate discharge

from Chrysler Corporation Space Division.
