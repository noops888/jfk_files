MENORANDUN FOR: Mr. Charles Anderson

SUBJECT:

Manolo RAY

l. Mr. John Crimmins called Mr. Samuel Halpern o

9 January and said that RAY is complicating the matte

of the export permit for his guns by raising the issue

of traisshipment to Venezuela via the Dominican Republic.

The ultimate consignee must show on all arms export

licenses.

It will appear strange indeed if a license 1s

issued which shows the Dominican Government acting as

intermediary for the Venezuelan Government, since there

are no relations between

the

two countrles.

2.

the

RAY should be apprised of this complication at

first opportunity.
