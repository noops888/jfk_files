Jared in Havana and sent outside for broadcasts back into the country..

It was

felt that this tochrique, nould porait timely oxploitation of developments inaldo

by caroful editing, to emphaalzing gestures and facial expressiona to produco à

zood satirical fila.

tritution Insido the country or in ochor cargot areas.
