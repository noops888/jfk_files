versations with members of the gambling element in Havana, this

drop for communications of importance among members of the

gambling element:

NORMAN ROTHMAN, who is operating slot machines in the

interior of Cuba, advised on 5/7/58 that because of recent

revolutionary activities, the slot machine trade had been very

slow and he was having difficulty retaining trained repair
