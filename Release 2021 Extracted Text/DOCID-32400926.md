MEMORANDUM- FOR:

RECORD

Mike Sindaoui Ã¶f CI Staff provided a copy of

GSCI-3/780,996 to attach to the answer to question

#24 of the HSCA interrogatories of 28 August.

The copy I got was a xarox copy which he had

told me (in advance) would show the FOIA deletions.

The xerox copy was not clear and I phoned to verify

the deletions: all classification marks, the OSCI

number on page 3, and the distribution on page Li

Mike said I was supposed to have received a

copy marked in yellow for the deletions. As I did

not I simply covered the sections noted above, as

agreed by him over the phone, and used that as the

attachment,
