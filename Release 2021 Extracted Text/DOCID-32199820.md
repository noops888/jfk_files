Date: August 2, 2021

From: National Archives and Records Administration

Subject: Reconstructed FBI File MI 62-1717, Serials 1-5

To: The File

This memorandum briefly summarizes the status of missing original Federal Bureau of

Investigation (FBI) case files or portions of case files in the President John F. Kennedy

Assassination Records Collection (JFK Collection) and documents the National Archives and

Records Administration's (NARA) efforts to reconstruct these records, where possible, from

duplicate copies of documents located in other FBI files.

As the JFK Collection was first compiled and reviewed in the 1990s, the Assassination Records

Review Board and the FBI designated some records as "not believed relevant" (NBR) or "not

assassination related" (NAR). The FBI retained custody of the NBR/NAR records and

postponed their transfer to NARA until a later date. Every document or group of documents

("serials"), however, received an indexed Record Identification Form (RIF) and FBI inventory

sheet for insertion into the JFK Collection.

Several years prior to the 2017 re-review and transfer of the NBR/NAR material to the National

Archives, the FBI destroyed a few files with NAR designations according to an authorized

records disposition schedule in effect at the time.

This compilation represents NARA's efforts to reconstruct the original file or portions of the file,

as completely as possible, with duplicate copies of documents located in the FBI field office and

headquarters files within the JFK Collection. Each reconstructed file or compilation contains a

Record Identification Form, an explanatory cover memo, existing administrative documents

available within the JFK Collection, and copies of identified duplicate documents. The table

below summarizes the status of FBI file MI 62-1717, Serials 1 through 5.

OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

WASHINGTON, D. C.

May 15, 1956

ORDER NO. 116-56

It 1s the policy of the Department of Justice to extend the fullest

possible cooperation to congressional committees requesting Information from

departmental files, Interviews with department employees, testimony of depart-

ment personnel, or

testimony of Federal prisoners. The following procedures

are prescribed in order to effectuate this policy on a basis which will be

mutually satisfactory to the congressional committees and to the Department.

(Ints order supersedes the Deputy Attorney General's Memorandum No. 5, dated

March 23, 1953, and bis Memorandum No. 97, dated August 5, 1954.

It formal-

Izes the Attorney General's press release of November 5, 1953, establishing

procedures to permit committees of the Congress and their authorized repre-

It supplements Order No. 3229 (Revised) dated January 13, 1953, and Order

of "Authorization Under Order No. 3464 Supplement No. 4 (Revised)" dated

January 13, 1953), Insofar

as said orders have reference to procedures to be

followed in the Department's relations with congressional committees. In

support of this order, reference should be had to the President's letter

dated May 17; 1954, addressed to the Secretary of Defense, and to the Attorney

General's Memorandum which accompanied it.!

A. REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM DEPARTMENT FILES

1. Congressional committee requests for the examination of files

or other confidential information should be reduced to writing, signed by

the chairman of the committee, and addressed to the Deputy Attorney General,

Who is responsible for the coordination of our liaison with Congress and

congressional committees. The request shall state the specific Information

sought as well as the specific objective for which It is sought.

The Deputy

Attorney General will forward the request to the appropriate division where a

reply wild be prepared and returned for the Deputy Attorney General's signa-

ture and dispatch to the chairman of the committee.

2. If the request concerns a closed case, 1. e., one in which

there 1s no litigation or administrative action pending or contemplated,

the file may be made available for review in the Department, in the presence

of the official or employee having custody thereof. The following procedure

shall be followed in such cases:

The reply letter will advise the committee that the

file is available for examination and set forth the

name, telephone extension number, and room number of

the person who will have custody of the file to be

reviewed;

NW: 65994-Docld:32199820-Page-12

+i--

## Page 13

- 2 -

b. Before making the file available to the committee

representative all reports and memoranda from the FBI

as well as investigative reports from any other agency,

will be removed from the file and not be made available

for examination; provided however that if the committee

representative states that it is essential that information

from the FBI reports and memoranda be made available,

he will be advised that the request will be considered

by the Department. Thereafter a summary of the contents

of the FBI reports and memoranda Involved will be

prepared which will not disclose investigative tech-

niques, the identity of confidential Informants, or

other matters which might jeopardize the investigative

operations of the FBI.

This summary will be forwarded

by the division to the FBI with a request for advice as

to whether the FBI has any objection to examination of

such summary by the committee representative.

The file

will not be physically relinquished from the custody of

the Department.

If the committee representative desires

to examine investigative reports from otber government

agencies, contained in the files of the Department, he

will be

advised to direct his request to the agency whose

reports are concerned.

3. If the request concerns an open case, 1. e., one which Ilti-

sation or administrative action 1s pending or contemplated, the file may

not be made avallable for examination by the committee's representative.

The following procedure shall be folloved:

a.. The reply letter should advise the committee that

its request concerns a case in which litigation or

administrative action is pending or contemplated, and

state that the file cannot be made available until the

case is completed; and

b. Should briefly set forth the status of the case in

as much detail as is practicable and prudent without

jeopardizing the pending contemplated litigation or

administrative action.

B. REQUESTS FOR INTURVIEVS WITH DEPARTMENIAL PERSONNEL

I. Requests for interviews with departmental personnel regarding

any official matters within the Department should be reduced to writing,

signed by the chairman of the comittee, and addressed to the Deputy Attorney

General. Then the approval of the Deputy Attorney General is given, the

employee is expected to discuss such matters freely and cooperatively with

the representative, subject to the limitations prescribed in A respecting

open cases and data in investigative reports;

D. REQUESTS OF CONGRESSIONAI COMMITTEES FOR THE TESTIMONY OF FEDERAI PRISONERS

Because of the custodial hazards involved and the extent to which

their public testimony may affect the discipline and well-being of the institu-

tion, It Is the rolley of the Department not to deliver Federal prisoners out-

the penal institution in which they are Incarcerated for the purpose of

being intervieved or examined under oath by congressional committees.

However,

when it appears that no pending investigation or legal proceeding will be

adversely affected thereby and that the public interest will not be otherwise

adversely affected, Federal prisoners may be interviewed or examined under oath

by congressional committees in the institution in which they are incarcerated

under the following procedures, and with the specific advance approval of the

in co the 800201

Deputy Attorney General.

1. Arrangements for intervieving and taking of sworn testimony

from a Federal prisoner by a committee of the Congress or the authorized

representatives of such a committee shall be made in the form of a written

request by the chairman of the committee to the Deputy Attorney General.

2. Such written request shall be made at least ten (10) days

prior to the requested date for the interview and the taking of testimony

and shall be accompanied by written evidence that authorization for the

interview or the taking of sworn testimony was approved by vote of the com-

mittee. Such request shall contain a statement of the purpose and the sub-

jects upon which the prisoner will be interrogated as well as the names of

all persons other than the representatives of the Department of Justice who

will be present.

3. A member of the interested committee of the Congress shall be

present during the entire time of the interrogation:

NW 65994-Docld:32199820-Page 14

## Page 15

- 4.

4o the varden of the penal institution in which the Federal

prisoner is Incarcerated shall, at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to the

time at which the interview takes place, advise the federal prisoner concerned

of the proposed interview or taling of suorn testimony; and shall further

advise that he is under the same, but no greater obligation to answer than any

other witness who is not a prisoner.

The warden of the penal institution shall have complete.

authority in conformity with the requirements of security and the mainte-

nance of discipline to limit the number of persons who will be present at

the interview and taking of testimony.

The warden or his authorized representative shall be present

at the intervier and at the taking of testimony and the Department of Justice

shall have the right to have one of its representatives present throughout

the interview and taking of testimony.

To The committee shall arrange to have a stenographic transcript

made of the entire proceedings at committee expense and shall furnish a copy

of the transcript to the Department of Justice.

E. OBSERVERS IN ATTENDANCE AT COMMINTED HEARINGS

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

As consideration for employment in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), United

States Department of Justice, and as a condition for continued employment, I hereby declare

that 1 intend to be governed by and I will comply with the following provisions:

(1) That I am hereby advised and I understand that Federal law such as

Title 18, United States Code, Sections 793, 794, and 798; Order of the

President of the United States (Executive Order 11652); and regulations

issued by the Attorney General of the United States (28 Code of Federal

Regulations, Sections 16.21 through 16.26) prohibit loss, misuse, or un-

authorized disclosure or production of national security information, other

classified information and other nonclassified information in the files of

the FBI;

(2) I understand that unauthorized disclosure of information in the files

of the FBI or information I may acquire as an employee of the FBI could

result in impairment of national security, place human life in jeopardy, or

result in the denial of due process to a person or persons who are subjects

of an FBI investigation, or prevent the FBI from effectively discharging its

responsibilities. I understand the need for this secrecy agreement; there-.

fore, as consideration for employment I agree that I will never divulge,

publish, or reveal either by word or conduct, or by other means disclose to

any unauthorized recipient without official written authorization by the

Director of the FBI or his delegate, any information from the investigatory

files of the FBI or any information relating to material contained in the files,

or disclose any information or produce any material acquired as a part of the

performance of my official duties or because of my official status. The burden

is on me to determine, prior to disclosure, whether information may be disclosed

and in this regard I agree to request approval of the Director of the FBI in each

such instance by presenting the full text of my proposed disclosure in writing to

the Director of the FBI at least thirty (30) days prior to disclosure. I understand

that this agreement is not intended to apply to information which has been placed

in the public domain or to prevent me from writing of speaking about the FBI but

it is intended to prevent disclosure of information where disclosure would be

contrary to law, regulation or public policy. I agree the Director of the FBI is

in a better position than I to make that determination;

(3) I agree that all information acquired by me in connection with my official

duties with the FBI and all official material to which I have access remains

the property of the United States of America, and I will surrender upon demand

by the Director of the FBI or his delegate, or upon separation from the F'BI, any

material relating to such information or property in my possession;

(4) That I understand unauthorized disclosure may be a violation of Federal

law and prosecuted as a criminal offense and in addition to this agreement may

be enforced by means of an injunction or other civil remedy.

I accept the above provisions as conditions for my employment and continued employment

in the FBI. I agree to comply with these provisions both during my employment in the FBI and

following termination of such employment.
