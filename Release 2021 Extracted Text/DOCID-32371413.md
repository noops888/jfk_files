MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director, Office of Security

FROM

SUBJECT

:

Raymond A.

Warren

Chief, Latin America Division

: Vladimir Rodriguez Lahera

1.

The House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA)

has requested that we arrange an interview for them with

Subject (former AMMUG/1) who defected from the Cuban Intelli-

gence Service in 1964.

Subject is now a U.S. citizen and

entered the U.S. under PL I10.

Miami,

2. Subject's last known address was 2931 SW 19th Terrace (p),

telephone (305) 443-3027. Henry S. PACHANKIS

a career associate assigned to LA/Miami Station was Subject's

contact

in

the Miami area.

PACHANKIS attempted to locate

subject; however, the telephone had been disconnected and a

visit to Subiect's residence revealed that he had moved

and

left no

forwarding address.

The post office box established

for subject's use was serviced and there was no communication

from Subject notifying us of his change of address and/or phone

number.

3. The HSCA considers their interview with Subject to be

extremely important and your assistance in locating the where-

abouts of Subject through your Miami office on a priority basis

would be most appreciated.

It is requested that no contact be

made with Subject when his whereabouts is ascertained since we

prefer to have someone whose bona fides

is established contact

him and arrange for the HSCA interview.
