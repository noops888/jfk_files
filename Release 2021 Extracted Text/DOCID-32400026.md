MEMORANDUM FOR:

SUBJECT

Director of Security

Senate Select Committee Staff Request

(Roselli/Maheu/Giancana Matter)

1.

Reference is made to the undersigned's assistance

provided to Mr. Andrew D. Postal and Mr. Gordon C. Rhea of

the Senate Select Committee Staff during their interview

on 19 August 1975 of Mr. Howard Osborn.

Primary emphasis during the interview of Mr. Osborn

seemed to center on the Roselli/Maheu/Giancana matter, and

the undersigned served to answer specific questions of the

Senate Staff members and Mr. Osborn concerning the Office

of Security files relating to Roselli/Maheu/Giancana.

Specifically, the Senate Staff members were most interested

in why the Office of Security's pertinent files do not

contain more documents dated during the 1960 through 1963

period relating to the Castro assassination attempt.

3. The undersigned was able to answer some innocuous

questions posed by the Senate Staff members, such as the

number of documents in the Roselli/Maheu/Giancana files

which are dated prior to 1963, or attempting to locate a

specific document such as one written by Colonel Edwards

describing a 7 February 1962 briefing of the FBI. (such a

document was not located).

4. However, at the termination of Mr. Osborn's inter-

members would put any remaining questions in writing and

formally request that the Agency respond to these questions.

In addition, it was agreed that although research into the

unanswered questions would begin immediately, any response

would be provided formally in writing upon receipt of the

The remaining unanswered questions of concern to

the Senate Committee Staff members are as follows:

Does the Inspector General have files

relating to the Roselli Maheu/Giancana matter,

and, if so, do their files contain any documents

dated during the 1960-1963 period?

b.

Does the Deputy Director for Operations

have files pertaining to the Roselli/Maheu/:

Giancana matter,

and if so, do their files con-

tain any documents dated during the 1960-1963

period?

C.

' Do Colonel Edwards' chrono files contain

any information relating to the Roselli/Maheu/

Giancana matter, with specific attention to:

meeting with FBI on 7 February 1962; meeting

with FBI on 3 May 1961; any other meetings with

FBI, Attorney General, of Department of Justice

during the 1960-1963 period; and any meetings

with Sam Papich of the FBI during 1960-1963?

6.,

Based on verbal discussions with Mr. Gambino

and Mr.

Dempsey, the undersigned will review the Inspector

General's files

relating to this matter in an attempt to

determine if their files contain any Office of Security

documents which are not contained in our files, with

specific attention to the 1960-1963 period.

The under

signed will also review the chrono files of Colonel

Edwards as requested by the Senate Staff members.

7. With regard to the question pertaining to the

tho, Mr. Dempsey recommended that this item be raised at

Task Force meeting scheduled for 1600 hours, 20 August

1975. Mr. Dempsey stated that he agreed that the Review

Staff should pass any such request to the DDO, but felt that

it should first be discussed at the Task Force meeting in

view of the fact that the questions posed by the Senate

Staff members have not been received via normal and estab-

lished procedures.
