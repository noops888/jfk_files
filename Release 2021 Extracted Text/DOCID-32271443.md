Biography

The stay was bonted

Elena Garro de Paz was born of Spanish parents in

retion culled

repared b

Puebla, Mexico on December 11, 1917.

Elanetas

Thomas

the National Autonomous University of Mexico and later

did graduate work at Berkley in California and at the

University of Paris. In 1963, Elena had long been married

to Octavio Paz, a career diplomat who is also one of

Mexico's finest poets and leading intellectuals. When

Octavio

named Mexican Ambassador to India, the couple

separated

by mutual consent. Elena's daughter, also

named

Elena, has always resided with her mother.

Since Elena spent

seventeen years of her early

life in Europe she had a rather un-Mexican objectivity

about her native land and had a reputation for being one

if its more articulate detractors. At the same time, Elena

was considered emotionally committed to many aspects of

Mexican life and made an important contribution to its

artistic development.

In the 1960's Elena became a significant writer.

Hogar Solido, El Rey Mago, La Senora en su Balcon, Ventura

Allende, Andaise por las Ramas, Parada Empresa, and El Viaje

are plays that

have had appreciative audiences in Europe,

where they

were translated into German, as well as in Mexico.

Ms. Garro's short stories are collected

in a volume called

La Semana de Colores.

The Literacy Supplement of the London

Times has called her novel, Los Recuerdos de Porvenir, "a

splendid success." Critics have said of her: "For

Elena Garro, there is no frontier between reality and

fantasy; in any case, the latter is a second reality--

perhaps more intense-- to which one may penetrate without

passport or forewarning, thanks to the effectiveness of

a literature fired with passion, flavor and life." &

Many

people who knew Elena have asserted that the frontier

between reality and fantasy is also difficult for her to

distinguish in real life. [Biography Data Form pilentasy an

pespared by Charles Thomas ]

Ms. Garro, for many years, was an active worker in

the Confederacion Nacional Campesina (CNC), the agrarian

arm of the Partido Reformista (PRI). Because Ms. Garro

was a tireless propagandist and agitator on behalf of the

poorer Mexican peasants, she was on close personal terms

with and enjoyed the respect of peasant leaders from all

over the country. (ibid)

Elena was considered a witty, urbane and opinionated

woman with an unflagging sense of humor. Her forthright

opinions and sharp wit tended on occasion to ruffle feathers

in Mexico, but her important social, literacy, and political

connections rendered her fairly immune from serious counter-

attack until 1968. Then, Ms. Garro was forced to flee the

country with her daughter, Elenita and her sister, Deba

Guerrero de Galvan, in the midst of the student strikes.

The House Select Committee On. Assassinations has been unable to

determine the exact reason MisiGarro had In fleeing Mexico.

Before her disappearance from Mexico, Elena was

well disposed toward the United States and had been

friendly with Embassy officers. Her broad range of signifi-

cant personal friends, the views of many important to the

American Embassy, made her a useful Embassy target. Through-

out the early 1960's she was carried as a target in the

Embassy's Youth Program.

American Embassy employees dealing with Elena

believed that despite her access to the underground happenings

Elena was questioned regarding the identity of other

persons attending the party at the Ruben Duran home who

might have been in a position to observe the three Americans.

Elena stated that in the course of the party her daughter

met a sount peg maned "alejandro" at the party and danced

with him.

He was apparently quite smitten with the

daughter and tried to call her on several occasions after

the party.

The daughter did not take the calls and as

a result "Alejandro" wrote several letters to the daughter.

Ms. Garro exhibited two of the letters, as well as a

business card which identified the young man as Ario Alejandro

Lavagnini Stenius. (IBIDP3)

He recalled having met a Mexican girl

who had recently returned from living in France. He was

unable to fix the date of the party, but felt it was

probably early in September because of a heavy rain which

occurred as they were leaving the party about 2:00 a.m.

no pictures is reasonable since Elena claimed that the

House Select Committee on Assassination

Investigation of Elena Garro's Allegations

The House Select Committee on

Assassinations

investigated Elena Garro's story both through file reviews

and

personal interviews. The Committee requested and

reviewed the CIA's, FBI's and State Departments Files, when

available

they existed, on Elena Garro de Paz, Elenita Garro de Paz,

Manuel Calvillo, Noe W. Palomares, June Cobb Sharp,

Victor Rico Galan, Eunice Odio, Sylvia Duran, Lydia Duran,

Ruben Duran, Betty Serratos, Horatio Duran, Eusebio Azcue,

and Emilio Carballido. Only the Elena Garro de Paz file

contained information on her allegations. Though all the

names listed above played a role in Elena Garro de Paz'

story, not one of their files included

a reference to

Elena Garro de Paz.

Furthermore, the House Select Committee on Assassina-

tions requested and reviewed the Central Intelligence

Agency's LICOOKIE I, LICHANT I, LIRING 3, LIHUFF I and

TICHBORN files.

Once again not one of the files

^ included

amention of Elena Garro's allegations. The House Select

Committee on Assassinations learned that LICOOKIE I was

June Cobb Sharp who first reported Elena's allegation. (Supra

p. 4)

The Committee also learned that LICHANT I was Manuel Calvillo

who hid Elena Garro and her daughter in a hotel the day
