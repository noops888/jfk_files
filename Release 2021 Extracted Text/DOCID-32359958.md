Name Unkaown,

Reference I, p. ?.

Remarks: Sam DeFINO told Carlos BRINGUIER that it is possible

that Garrison will try to connect an es-Nazi, name unknows, to the

assassination of President Kennedy.

The ex-Nazi was said to have

been "big in propaganda", to be living in Mexico City, and to be one

of the heads (sic) of CIA in Mexico.

This latter comment could mean a principal agent rather than

a staff employee. One possibility is Masinillian Egon HOHENLCHE.
