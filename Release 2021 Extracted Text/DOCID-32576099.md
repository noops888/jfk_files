On March 23, 1964, EDWARD PERRONE was interviewed

by SAs OSEPH E. RILEY and EDWARD M. NALLY, JI., inasmuch as

it had previously been determined during the investigation

Of ROSARIO MANCUSO that MANCUSO had been in touch with PER-

RONE.

PERRONE advised approximately one week prior to

the Apalachin meeting in 1957, ROSARIO MANCUSO and TONY.

FALANGE of Utica, had visited him at his real estate office

in connection with insurance he had written on MANCUSO''s:

automobile. He said after handling this business, MANCUSO

invited him to have dinner with him at the Larkin Restaurant.

When they arrived at the Larkin, they were joined by JOSEPH

FALCONE, SALVATORE FALCONE, SYLVESTER BATTAGLIA of Albany,

GUS BATTAGLIA, brother of SYLVESTER, formerly of Albany, now

of Tucson, Arizona, and JOSEPH LEONE, who he advised operates

a tinsmith shop on

Delaware Avenue, Albany. PERRONE said

through conversation, he had determined that the FALCONES and

MANCUSO had apparently come to Albany to say goodbye to GUS

BATTAGLIA, as GUS BATTAGLIA was supposed to be returning to

his residence in Tucson, Arizona.

PERRONE stated at the time,

he was a little disgusted with them, as both the FALCONES

embraced the BATTAGLIAs and kissed each of them on each cheek.

He further advised during dinner,

the FALCONES and BATTAGLIAS

conversed in Sicilian, but he could not understand what was

said, as he (PERRONE) was a Neopolitan.

PERRONE further advised that he had been introduced

to SAM GRIO of Utica, New York, by MANCUSO and from time to

time when in Utica, would stop

in to see GRIO. He stated

during the Spring of 1963, while in Utica, he was at a store

then operated by GRIO, located on the corner of Third Avenue-

and Bleecker Street.

PERRONE said while in this store talk-

ing to GRIO, FALCONE came in and FALCONE and GRIO went to the

rear: of the store and conversed in Italian and English. He

said he heard FALCONE and GRIO mention the name JOHNNY GEORGE

and further indicated he had heard FALCONE tell GRIO to go to

Buffalo and straighten "them"' out as GEORGE was "okay". PER-

RONE said he heard GRIO indicate he did not want to go to

-12-

AL 92-535

Niagara Falls and then heard FALCONE tell GRIO he would not

have to go to Niagara Falls; that he could handle the matter

by going to the Peace Bridge Motel. In connection with the

Peace Bridge Motel, the New York State Police were conduct-

ing an extensive investigation of a state-wide lottery opera-

tion during this period of time that involved certain members

of the MAGADDINO family, and the Peace Bridge Motel was deter-

mined by the New York State Police to have been utilized by

some of those involved in the lottery as a place to meet.

PERRONE further advised he heard FALCONE tell GRIO to see

"SAMMA MAG''. When asked whether or not he heard the name

MAGADDINO mentioned, PERRONE

stated he was not certain as

FALCONE had spoken in broken English and it sounded like

"SAMMA MAG" to him. PERRONE further advised he heard FALCONE

tell GRIO to also contact CARLO.

PERRONE further advised on one occasion when talking

to ROSARIO MANCUSO, MANCUSO told him GRIO was the boss in

Utica, New York, indicating to him that GRIO was over FALCONE,

meaning JOSEPH FALCONE.

On June 16, 1964, information was received reflect-

ing that a going-away party was to be held at Grimaldi's

Restaurant, Utica, New York, for SALVATORE FALCONE, who was

expected to depart from Utica on June 17, 1964, enroute to

Miami, Florida, his home.

This party was observed by SAS

ANTHONY R. VILLANO and THOMAS H. GEORGE, at which time it

was noted the party was attended by the FALCONE family,

including wives and children. Other Utica hoodlums were not

observed in attendance at this function. SALVATORE and

JOSEPH FALCONE were observed in attendance at this party.

On June 16, 1964, Confidential Informant AL T-17

advised that all local bookmakers who desired recognition by

JOSEPH FALCONE in their illegal activities were required to

pay 30 per cent of their net proceeds to FALCONE.

AL I-17 advised a Cuban Lottery was once again

flourishing in Utica and that the source of the lottery tic-

kets was believed to be in Syracuse, New York.

On March 24, 1964, during interview with EDWARD

PERRONE at Albany, New York, PERRONE advised SAs EDWARD M.

NALLY, Jr. and JOSEPH E. RILEY that in November, 1963,

ROSARIO MANCUSO approached him and asked him if he, PERRONE,

could intercede with CHARLIE RYAN and DAN O'CONNELL Of

Albany in order to have them intercede with Judge FRANCIS

BERGAN of the Circuit Court of Appeals, New York State, rela-

tive to an appeal of SAM FARRAR on a bookmaking conviction in

Syracuse, New York. PERRONE refused to do this.

It should be noted DAN O'CONNELL is well-known and

best described as the political boxx of Albany County and

CHARLIE RYAN is alleged to be one of his chief lieutenants.

From all information to date, it now appears

FARRAR is in all probability a button man or soldier in the

MAGADDINO family, which is best illustrated by information

furnished by AL T-4 on April 22, 1964.

Set forth elsewhere in this report is information.

furnished by AL I-4 concerning a meeting apparently held

with STEVE MAGADDINO, SAM FARAR and ROSARIO MANCUSO pertain-.

ing to the extortion of the Jewish attorney, BURTON LOWITZ,

of Syracuse, New York....

As previously indicated, SAM FARRAR was in business

with MANCUSO at the A-1 Home Improvement Company, 607 Butternut

Street, Syracuse, New York. As indicated elsewhere in this

report, this was determined through information previously

furnished by AL I-4, ALT-5, AL I-7, AL I-8, AL I-10, AL I-11

and AL T-15.

As

indicated under MANCUSO's caption, this business

is no longer being run by FARRAR and MANCUSO due to a falling

out which they had with the Manager, NORMAN JOHNSON. As a

result of this trouble with JOHNSON, MANCUSO and FARRAR are

now operating arew siding company called Aluminum Specialties

of America, which is located on North Main Street, Syracuse,

New York.

information from the NYSP, a check of the Albany Telephone

Directories reflected that there is a Seaman Real Estate

Agency in Albay which is operated by a MAURICE SEAMAN.

On June 19, 1964, AL T-6 was contacted under cover

of a routine contact.

It should be noted that at no time

during this contact with him was any mention made to him of

the information.heretofore set forth concerning the alleged

meeting of June 14, 1964. During this contact with him, as on

every contact with him, he was asked if FALCONE, MANCUSO or

SAM GRIO had been in contact with him or if he had seen them.

He stated

that they have not been in contact with him and that

he had not seen them for at least two months. At this time,

informant was queried about any gambling interests that FALCONE,

MANCUSO and GRIO might have in the Saratoga Springs, New York,

area. He stated that back in the 1940's, when he operated the

Brook Club in Saratoga, MANCUSO, FALCONE and several others whom

informant could not recall had

attempted to "muscle in" on DOC

FARONE's gambling interests in Saratoga Springs and had been

literally thrown out of Saratoga by FARONE. Informant further

volunteered that FARONE detests MANCUSO and probably would have

nothing to do with MANCUSO, therefore, would not become involved

with him in gambling. It should be noted that informant advised

that DOC FARONE was a very good friend of his, stating that

FARONE backed him financially when informant operated a restau-

rant and bar equipment supply business in Albany, New York.

During the contact with informant, he was also asked

what the feeling around town was as a result of the IRS gambl-

ing raids. He said it was common knowledge around Albany that

an elderly man driving an old car was believed responsible by

local gamblers for furnishing information to IRS that led to

their arrest.

He said he had learned this from JOSEPH MOSHER,

an employee at the State Campus Site, who resides at 35 Holmes

Court and is employed by the Basic Construction Company as a

truck driver, that "SCOTCHY" MORRISON was the source of this

information, and it was indicated by MORRISON that the local

gamblers are out to "rough up" this elderly man. He knows

nothing about this elderly man and could furnish no information

concerning his identity. The above information was volunteered

and at no time had Agents mentioned MOSHER's name nor the alleged

MORRISON, several other gamblers, and with JOSEPH MOSHER.

HARTNETT said the IRS Agent had used the alias of BILL SEAMAN

and became acquainted with MOSHER as a fellow bettor. HARTNETT

advised that SEAMAN had utilized an old car, participated in

the raids, was observed by several of the arrested gamblers at

IRS Headquarters during booking and arraignment procedures, and

could very possibly have been recognized as the undercover

at this time.

Agent

On June 22, 1964, Chief of Police JOHN TUFFEY, Albany,

advised JOSEPH MOSHER had been known to him for years as a long-

time resident of the Greater Albany area, except for a short

period when he resided in New York City.

Chief TUFFEY described

MOSHER as a "punk". He stated he did not believe MOSHER had the

courage to commit a murder. Chief TUFFEY described PERRONE as

a "blow-hard with political connections in Albany". TUFFEY said

PERRONE "could not even fix a parking ticket". Chief TUFFEY

further advised no information was brought to his attention con-

cerning the Club 21 being up for sale, indicating that this is

most unlikely, as if such was the case, he would have heard of

it.

On June 23, 1964, Lieutenant ROBERT CRYAN advised

the NYSP informant had been recontacted and advised definitely

the meeting had taken place, and same had taken place at the

residence of EDWARD PERRONE in Albany, New York.

Relative to JOSEPH MOSHER, it should be noted that

according to Lieutenant CRYAN, MOSHER has an extensive crimi-

nal record, including arrests at New York City.

Records of the New York State Department of Criminal

Identification reflect an arrest record for one JOSEPH MOSHER,

born May 19, 1911 at Albany, New York, DCI # 124045X, FBI #

955256, reflecting New York

City arrests for violation of the

Sullivan Law in 1933; robbery second in 1935; vagrancy in 1937;

petty larceny in 1945; and grand larceny in 1953. His New York

City Police Department number, according to THOMAS WELCH,

Director, NYS DCI, is 326658. This individual's' Albany Police

Department number

is 6131A.
