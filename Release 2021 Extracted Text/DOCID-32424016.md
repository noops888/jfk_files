NOTE FOR MR. VANCE

Attached is copy of Second Progress Report of the Sub-

committee on Cuban Subversion. The Services and ASD/ISA have

concurred in this report with a few minor nonsubstantive sugges.-

tions (these are noted in ink).

• CIA and USIA have concurred. State, however, has objected

on the grounds that certain actions have been taken with respect to

the Alerting System without sufficient authority.

Another meeting of the Subcommittee has been scheduled for

Friday afternoon in order to resolve this difference. I plan to attend

and will report any substantive actions.

PROGRESS ACHIEVED DURING APRIL IN IMPEDING TRAVEL TO CUBA

1. The Department of State has:

a. Participäted in the drafting of a resolution passed at

the 3-4 April Managua Meeting respecting discouragement of

travel of Latin Americans to Cuba for training in subversion.

The text of the resolution is appended hereto.

b. Headed an interdepartmental team currently visiting the

Isthmian capitals whith the objective of securing the fullest

and quickest implementation of all the recommendations agreed

on at Managua.

Prior to the departure of the team, Department

of state posts were instructed to inform the host governments

of the trip and to encourage them to identify the kinds and

extent of technical assistance It would be most useful for the

United States to furnish.

c. Caused to be noted in U.S. passports since 1 April

that they are

not valid for travel to Cuba.

d. Following an indication that

the Bolivian Government

might be willing to increase efforts to impede travel of its

nationals to Cuba, instructed the U.S. Embassy

to recommend

that the GOB:

1) Ban travel to Cuba by Bolivian nationals except

for official or special purposes approved by the GOB,

and establish legal penalties for violations;

2) Require Bolivian citizens to have a passport or

other GOB document to travel abroad;

3) Make such document invalid for travel to Cuba unless

specially endorsed;

4) Seek arrangements with third countries which are

and will help identify violators.

e) Drawing on the recommendation in the paper on "The

Movement of Subversives and Subversive Trainees" and other

sources, instructed the non-isthmian posts to encourage host

governments to take additional counter-subversion steps.

Each instruction was tailored to the local situation in

the recipient country and included appropriate suggestions

as to strategy which might be used in securing implementation

of the desired actions.

P)e Requested posts In Latin America to encourage host

governments to take appropriate measures to discourage

participation of their nationals in Cuba's May Day cele-

bration and to prevent charter flights from their country

to Cuba for the celebration.

g) Through efforts with varlous Latin American and other

governments, discouraged participation in the Cuban solid-

arity Congress. U.S, efforts contributed to limiting the

success of the Congress from the Castro-Communist point of

view

2. The Department of Defense has:

a. Continued

the US sea and air surveillance of the

area surrounding Cuba until 25 April 1963, at the same

rate and with the same emphasis as existed prior to that

date. Since 25 April 1963 additional sea surveillance

has been realized between Cuba and. Haiti, due to the

stationing of the Caribbean Ready Amphibious Squadron at

the entrance of the Gulf of Gonaives occasioned by the

deterioration of internal conditions within Haiti.

Reports of subversive movement, or suspected subversive

movement, obtained by US surveillance are available for

Immediate transmittal through the US military alerting

system.

b. Continued action, at high priority, on the install-

ation of military communications facilities in Latin America.

As Of 1 April, a commercial submarine cable from Florida

to Panama became operational. This cable gives reliable

voice and teletype communications to CINCARIB including

both classified teletype and voice. Negotiations are

continuing in Honduras, Colombia and Ecuador for the

installation of military radio facilities.

Installation

of a multi-channel radio station has been completed in

Costa Rica. A similar facility in Nicaragua is scheduled

for completion by. I July 1963.

c. Established an Intelligence Center at CARIBCOM Head-

quarters, in connection with the program of surface

surveillance of the Caribbean, for rapid processing and

dissemination to countries concerned, via the American

Ambassadors, of intelligence on the movement of subversives:

Study of the establishment of intelligence centers in the

Caribbean revealed that the Intelligence Center should be

established at Caribbean Command Headquarters and that a

center need not be established at Headquarters, Caribbean

Sea Frontier.

d. Established on 11 April a U.S, military alerting

system operated by CINCARIB and CINCLANT. Pursuant to the

request of the Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee on

Cuban Affairs the Department of Defense has suspended the use

of the Military Groups in the alerting system and is working

with CIA to reduce duplication of effort to a minimum.

e. Alerted U.S, forces, for the most part within the

Atlantic Command, to be prepared to provide U.S, assistance

in the final interception of shipping in territorial waters

are assigned by the unified commander involved, to meet the

singular problem encountered. Preparations have been made

to respond to a possible requirement in the case of the

Venezuelan ship FERRYMAR III. USS PURDY CURRENTLY

UNDER SURVEILLANCE.

f. Ordered to the Canal Zone a Coast Guard Mobile

Training Team for a period of six months, beginning

15 May 1963, to provide training, in Spanish, in boat

handling and maintenance together with surveillance

techniques

to those Central American countries having 40

foot Coast Guard Utility Boats.

In addition, the Mobile

Training Team will assist as required in establishing a

permanent Small Craft Training and Inspection Facility in

the Canal Zone.

One 40 foot utility boat has been permanently

assigned to the U.S. Naval Station, Rodman, Canal Zone for

use by the MIT and will be delivered there about 20 June.

3. The Central Intelligence Agency has:

a. Completed its efforts to improve U.S. government

communications in Latin America by the installation of

the remaining.two. commercial leased circuits.into

Guatemala City and Managua, and the stationing on a

permanent basis of 35 CIA radio operators in Latin

America in replacement of temporary duty personnel. In

November 1962, CIA's active radio facilities in 20 Latin

American capitals were augmented with on-line crypto-

graphic facilities and temporary personnel to handle the

bulk of all .U.S. government communications in the area.

b. Increased its efforts designed to control the move-

ment of persons, arms and propaganda materials to and

from Cuba.

A summary of actions by country

is provided

below:

1) Argentina - Station, in conjunction with the

Embassy, has continued to press the Argentine govern-

ment to enact effective travel control legislation

and to adopt measures recommended by the Special CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE

ON.Security. Co

mittee of the OAS. Information on

Argentines travelling to Cuba is being furnished to

the Argentine government by the station.

Several

potential travellers to Cuba have been spotted and

are being assessed by the station. Information from

three recent returnees from Cuba is being obtained

through debriefings. Station reports that because of

Increased Mexican controls, all truly clandestine

travel to Cuba from Argentina is now via Prague.

Che

Guevara's mother was arrested on 23 April upon her

return to Argentina for importing Castro propaganda.

2) Bolivia - Station and Embassy have been urging.

Names of travellers

known to have returned from Cuba are being furnidhed

to the Bolivian government.

Thus far, no action is

known to have been taken by the Bolivian government on

the strength of such information. Station comments

that

problem with Bolivia is not in lack of information

available to government on Cuban subversion, but in

getting Bollvia to do something about it.

3) Brazil - Information on Brazilians who have

received subversive training in Cuba has been made

available

to the Brazilian Foreign Office, through the

American Ambassador, and to the National Security

Council through CIA liaison with the NSC's Security

Service.

An asset of the CIA station in Rio is in a position

travellers to and from Cuba.

passport applicants

to state destination, and passports

must be turned in after travel. The Foreign Minister

has stated much progress is being made, with cooperation

of the Mexican government, and that travel of Chileans to

Cuba has been dramatically reduced in recent weeks.

Station and Embassy are continuing pressure on Cuban

government in this regard. Names of travellers to Cuba
