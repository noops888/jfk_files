Preliminary Analysis: As pointed out in a preliminars

analysis of the MALASH complex, made in larch 1985 when

preparing for travel to Maurid in connection with the (QuHops-1

...There is no convincing evidence that the group is

working either for or against the regive of Fidel CASrRo.

Reports on thair contacts with us and their discussions among

themselves are at variance.

knowing that they were plotting against hin, talked to AHLASI)

and seven members of his group to enlist their support against:

Anibal SSCALANTI Dellunde and the conmunists in Cuba.

Possibly

they are playing both ends against the middle.

They certainly

have been and are in contact with the two ends."

The following

connents are keyed to matters raised by ESPINOSA:

A. The AMLASA conspiracy - As detailed by NADE-3716

(IN 28634)

on 6 April 1965,

QUSPORT-1 reporting on a meeting

of the AMLASH group, including AWHIP-I nentioned the fullowing

"the ANLASH circle is wide and each new

friend of vhon we learn

seens to have knowledge of the plan."

I believe that the

problem is a nore serious and basic one.

Assassination,

not merely to the plotters in

a phygical sense, but to a sponsoring government which

suffer severs political repercussiong

at home and abroad it its

involvement is made known.

In the instant case, the risks of

exposure of the ODYOKS hand would appear high, whether there is

a provocation or not.

Considering the individuals who are

involved directly, their contacts with KUBARk officers, and their

eported plan to exposer nee

Iortunately the tenor of his complaint was

that KUBARk had not

The contacts

1e Macters allecting

the Paris Station: - The

"recruitment" of Maureen bad been the

subject of an exchange of cables between (Paria) and Headquarters

and 0f discussions at Headquarters between WH/C and WE (See

[PARIL1071 (IN 66557) and DIR-10955).

The annoying thing in

this connection now is that ESPINOSA bas talked about it to

ODINVY and CDURGS and the danger that, 1l he is indiscreet,

his story about this (and the other matters) could reach some

curIOuS newSpaperman.

(In this connection, it appears that the

questionable decision to put Maureen in touch with

AMLASH

group was made without the kaowledge of STCCKICOD.)

ESPINOSA

did not report any criticism of the KusArkers at Paris but it

is evideat that the AMLASH grOUp knows nore about them

we might wish.

What is new and of concern from SSPINOSA about

matters in Paris is his story of AWHIP 1 and UNSNAFU-19

dealings.

The questiong raised about AMWHIP-l are of mutual

concern also to Headquarters which has been running him and

Nadrid which he has visited often

(On the occasion of my

previous trio to Madrid on the Quiops-l case, GROYERY had voiced

his doubts about the whole group and specifically aboit ANHIP-]

connection with (UNSNArY-19.›

At issue are tro

the knowledge on the part of UNSNAFJ-19 aboat RUBARK'S

connection with AUNHIP-l and

the charge that AWWHIPl has been

defrauding KUBARk in the jewelry transaction.

Also to be kept

in mind is the fact that ODENVY has an

office in Paris which

well might have been informed of the allegations

and which might

have been asked for comments - although ODSNVY policy always

bas been to stay away from asy investigation of other government

agencies unless specifically directed by the Attorney General

to investigate.
