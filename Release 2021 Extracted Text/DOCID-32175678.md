DIVISION III

SUBJECT: SENSTUDY 1975

MI. WILLIAM CREGAR, FBIHQ, telephoned me this date

to advise that former coordinating Supervisor ARNOLD BRANDT,

NYO, and former SAC JOSEPH SCHMIT, NYO, testified before

staff personnel of the Senate Select Committee on 9/15/75

and 9/16/75 respectively.

Both advised Mr. CREGAR that

they will send down to FBIHQ, by way of the NYO, a written

version of their testimony.

They will probably send these

in care of the NYO and

we should forward intact to the

Bureau.

Mr. CREGAR requested the following:

We should contact both Mr. BRANDT and Mr. SCHMIT

to determine their knowledge of any briefing afforded the

Attorney General, the late ROBERT KENNEDY, while visiting

the NYO in approximately 1962, relating to our operations

concerning mail programs. Mr. CREGAR desires that I talk

to some of the older Supervisors or Agents, who might recall

the visit of the Attorney General and what briefings took

If any memoranda were written on such briefings,

he would like a copy of same.

Mr. CREGAR believes, although

not certain, that Mr. SCHMIT

indicated such a memorandum

existed.

In addition, we should ask Mr. SCHMIT whether he

was put under oath by Mr. JIM DICK, and if so, he should

include this in his written memorandum which he is going

to forward to FBIHQ.

In addition, Mr. SCHMIT should be

asked about a statement he made to Mr. CREGAR regarding

the reading of the transcript of the

staff members for

accuracy. Mr. CREGAR believes Mr. SCHMIT Stated that he

was able to read the transcript.

If this occurred, please

I advised Mr. CREGAR that I will immediately

converse with the appropriate older Agents in NYO and

initiate action to run down answers to the above, and hope

to have same before close of business today.

Above brought to attention of Supervisor CHARLES

WEIS, who in turn furnished names of SAs possibly familiar

with above, and we have initiated action to try to locate

Mr. BRANDT and Mr. SCHMIT to get above answers.

Supervisor

LOU BARRA, who has SENSTUDY assigned to his squad, should

assist Supervisor WEIS in running this matter down.

he, too, was

questioned relative to.tne same matters, but

nat the questions asked were generally of a higher level

with regard

to authorization,

had been put

under oath by a

female who also operated a

stenotype machine and recorded the proceedings.

He had

been advised

that he had a right to

read the transcript of

the proceedings and they would notify him when the transcript

was completed.

SCHMIT advised he intended to exercise this

privilege.

with regard to this interview, SCHMIT advised he

was interviewed

in the Everette Dirksen Sanate Building from

10:05 AM until 12:15 PM on 9/16/75. At the time he was put

under oath by the female who operated the stenotype machine.

He did not know the name of this woman, but did notice that

she was unknown to

the

two. attornies who were conducting the

interview

as they had to introduce

themselves to her. The

attornies' names were JIM DICK and TOM DAWSON.

Regarding his conference with former Attorney General

ROBERT F. KENNEDY, SCHMIT stated

that at the time of this con-

ference there was

a general criminal intelligence conference

being. held in the NO and that at one point in this conference

he was asked to brief the Attorney General on the espionage

situation.

SCHMIT advised that at this time he arrived at the

conference with three members of his staff, former Supervisors

ARNOLD BRANDT, JOHN DANAHY and JOHN MABEY.

SCHMIT stated that

in addition to these people the individuals who were already

present at the conference were all the SACs and JOHN F. MALONE,

the ADIC.

In addition to the Attorney General, there was a

public relations man who accompanied him whose name was not

recalled by SCHMIT, and former Assistant Director COURTNEY EVANS.

SCHMIT did not recall ever reducing this conference to writing,

but stated that if it was, and it may well have been, it would

been done somewnere

in the criminal intelligence files that

were reporting the general criminal intelligence conference.

With regard to who might recall specifics of this file,

SCHMIT suggested contacting former NYO Supervisors JOHN DANAHY

or JOHN JOYCE, or former SAC WILLIAM ALEXANDER, whom he thinks

might have been the SAC of the Criminal Division at the time.

SECREI

Regarding what he discussed with the Attorney

General, SCHMIT stated that he could not really recall the

specifies, but probably discussed the programs we were

conducting

such as SAM, SUN, GUS and Z, because in effect

we were telling the Attorney General what accomplishments

we were making, so SCHMIT felt that these would have

been

mentioned.

However, he could not specifically recall the

details.

In addition, SCHMIT felt that he probably dis-

cussed contemporary espionage cases at the time.

In addition to this conference, SCHMIT advised

that KENNEDY received a second briefing

which he, SCHMIT,

did

not recall.

However, when he was discussing

his testi

mony with former NYO Supervisor FRANCIS GALLANT, GALLANT

told

SCHMIT that KENNEDY came back a second time at a later

date

and that he, GALLANT, brought KENNEDY up to date in

what

was being done in the espionage field.

SCHMIT stated,

however,

he did not even recall this happening after GALLANT

had told him on a previous occasion.

SCHMIT stated that all of this information,

including

the fact that

he had a right to review the

trans-

cript, would be placed in his memo and he would furnish this

memo to the NYO, to be forwarded to the Bureau.

Review of the

pertinent files in Division III failed

to reflect any record of former SAC JOSEPH SCHMIT*s discussion

with the then Attorney General ROBERT F. KENNEDY.

Supervisors and Agents with extensive experience in

the field of espionage were contacted and did recall that former

Attorney General KENNEDY visited the NO during early 1960s, but

these individuals

were not aware of the details of the discussions.

which took place in the NYO between the then Attorney General

KENNEDY and the executives of the wyo.

It is brought to the attention of the Bureau that the

NYO did not attempt to review, the criminal intelligence files

and will take no action in this area unless advised by the

Bureau:

SUPVR. LOUIS BARRA #34

SENSTUDY

The following information should be brought to the

attention of Agents who may be

testifying before the Senate

Select Committee (SSC) pertaining to Bureau matters.

After an Agent has testified, he should carefully

prepare an LHi captioned "SENSTUDY". The abbreviations ADIC,

Division III, Division IV, Division V, etc. should not be used

in the LHM as the LHM is

forwarded to

the White House and the

Department and these recipients are not knowledgeable as to

some Bureau terminology. Therefore, these terms should be

completely identified.

In addition, the LHM should reflect who the inter-

viewers were, it being noted that Committee members are Senators

whereas Staff members are attornies or other individuals acting

for the committee Senators.

The

time and place of the interviews

should also be reflected in the LHM.

Moreover, any question

asked an Agent by

a member of the SSe should be set out in the:

LHM and the Agent's answer should follow.

The cover letter is not usually classified; however, !

the LHM should

be classified with the appropriate classification

of "Confidential"

"Secret" or "Top Secret", according

to the

information contained in the LM.

The LHM

should bear the

caption "SENSTUDY", with no character.

SENSTUDY is assigned to Section 34 and

all

communi-

cations must be processed through the supervisor of Section

34

so their contents can be properly coordinated.

BuNitel dated 9/19/75 advised that Supervisor

SULLIVAN and SAC DENZ have been requested to be available

in Washington for Senate Select Committee interview.

On

9/22/75 I telephoned Legal Counsel and spoke to SA PAUL DALY

to firm up my receipt of this request.

I asked SA DALY

status of the Department's review of items of interest to

the Senate Select Committee and the status of the Bureau's

request to hold up any further testimony by Agents until

the Department comes out with a judgment.

SA DALY advised

that no response in writing has been received but that the

Department indicated we should continue to honor requests

from the Committee.

I asked. SA DALY status of the Depart-

ment's program relating to making available legal counsel

for those Agents appearing before the Committee or Committee

staff.

SA DALY advised that they have met on this matter

but no decision has been made, and in the meantime we are

continuing to honor requests for appearances.

I advised SA DALY that it is my opinion that

appearances should be held up until the above two items

have been adjudicated.

He advised that this was the Bureau's

stand, but in the meantime we have been advised orally by

the Attorney General's office to continue to honor requests.

SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE

INTERVIEW OF

SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE ROBERT C. DENZ

NEW YORK OFFICE, SEPTEMBER 24,

1975,

BY MICHAEL EPSTEIN AND MARY DE OREO

The interview took place in Room G-308, Everette M.

Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, D. C., from

approximately 11:10 a.m. to 11:45 a.m. on September 24, 1975.

Mr. Epstein presented a one-page typewritten form, pertaining

to

"Advice of Rights" and "Waiver of Rights",

stating that he

hoped Mr. Denz would sign it.

It

was read, signed and dated.

A copy was obtained by SAC Denz.

In response to cáreer-type questions, SAC Denz

advised the interviewers of his current position in the New

YorK OrIce, which he assumed reoruary, tyle, his position as

Assistant Special Agent in Charge, Portland, Oregon, Office

from April, 1974, to January, 1975, and his position of

Assistant Special Agent in Charge in the New York Office from

Maich, 1973 to April, 1974.

Mr. Denz noted that prior to this

he was assigned to Headguarters.

It was mentioned by Mr. Denz

that the New York Office has five Special

Agents in Charge and

one Assistant Director in Charge.

Mr. Epstein stated that he

is primarily interested in that point of Mr. Denz's career

which took place at Headquarters.

Mr. Denz advised that he

was transferred from the Detroit Office to Headguarters in

approximately March of 1963 and was

assigned to a unit which

had some of the supervisory responsibilities pertaining

to

the Communist Party, USA.: After serving several monchs,

possibly six to eight, Mr.. Denz was assigned to a unit handling

extremist matters, such as the Ku Klux Klan. As to the first

unit mentioned, it was explained that there were various

investigations and various subfiles concerning the Communist

Party, such as Communist Party membership, and Communist Party

youth.

Mr. Epstein asked the identities of the other individuals

serving in that specific unit.

Mr. Denz replied that he recalls

Special Agents Larry Gurley, Seymor Phillips, and William Shaw.

In response to Mr. Epstein's question, Mr. Denz

advised that, in view of the lapse of time and the fact that

his service in that particular unit was only a matter of months,

all of his assignments could not 'be recalled. To the best of

memory, Mx. Denz advised that he coordinated Communist Party

membership figures as furnished by certain field offices and

believed that at one time he had assigned

the subfile on negro

matters.

Mr. Epstein inquired whether this meant "Cominfil"

or Communist Party infiltration of negro groups:

Mx. Denz

advised that he could not recall specifically the lineup in

Division 5, Headquarters, of Communist infiltration cases, but

the Communist Party, USA, negro matters would probably touch

on Communist infiltration as well as negro members in the Com-

munist Party itself.

Mr. Epstein inquired as to the "March

on Washington" of 1963 and specifically, the identity of the

Special Agent handling same,

and who would an official of the

Division, as example, an Assistant Director, refer to if he had

a question regarding

the March.

Mr. Denz advised that the

official would, no doubt, go down the line of command to the

Section Chief, and then to the Unit Chief, and then to the

Special Agent handling subject matter.

Mr. Epstein was aware

that a Mr. Baumgartner was the Section Chief at that time.

to whether the Assistant Director would go directly to the

Special Agent handling the matter, Mr. Denz advised that he

doubted such would be the normal procedure, but indicated that

an official could well have done so on occasion.

anding Ehe normal procedure

Mr. Epstein furnished for review Xerox copies of

Communist influence in racial matters and the March on Washing-

that the memoranda indicate that Mr. Denz had the responsibility

of coordinating field information regarding the March on Wash-

ington and the responsibility of keeping Bureau officials

currently advised. Both memoranda were of an informative

nature.

In reply to Mr. Epstein's questions regarding a review

ot files at headquarters, Mr. Denz explained that probably the

memoranda were based on information furnished by several field

offices, but no doubt files at Headquarters could also have

been reviewed.

Mr. Epstein inquired as to Mr. Denz's opinion

of the extent of Communist Party influence on the March on

Washington.

Mr. Denz noted that Mr. Hoover had commented on

one of the

memoranda to the effect that it was an infinitesimal

amount.

Mr. Denz stated that he, himself, might not put it in

exactly that manner but agreed, while it was no doubt a logical

target for the Communist Party,

there was not that much in-

fluence. At least one of the memoranda supported this comment.

As to Mr. Epstein's question concerning Special Agent Forsythe's

assignments, he was advised by Mr. Denz that to the best of.

memory Special Agent Forsythe handled assignments pertaining

to individual subjects but no specifics were known.

Epstein inquired as to Mr. Denz's knowledge of "taps" on

of sane while at Headquarters but cannot recall as to exact

time, place, or any other specific details.

Mx. Epstein concluded the interview, stating his

appreciation for the appearance.

Re

Interview of Special Agent JOHN C. SULLIVAN

September 24, 1975

Washington, D. C.

Mr. EPSTEIN then asked that if SA SULLIVAN investigated

Racial Matters, why he was not investigating CP-USA Negro Matters.

He was told that one squad usually handled all matters dealing

with the CP, and that CP-Negro Matters and Racial Matters

investigations were not the same, and were handled by different

squads.

Mr. EPSTEIN then asked how the NYO was set up,

such as divisions, etc... He was told that the NYO had divisions

that were then broken down into squads.

Each squad was responsible

for investigating specific classifications.

Mr. EPSTEIN then produced other documents as follows:

Xerox copy of a document captioned, "CP-USA Negro Question-

Communist Infiltration; Racial Matter; IS-C", dated May 21, 1964,

NY file number 100-151649; Xerox copy of Bureau airtelto

New York dated April 13, 1964, captioned, "CP-USA; COINTELPRO;

IS-C; NEGRO QUESTION", Bureau file number 100-3-104-34; Xerox

copy of Bureau letter to NY captioned, "CP-USA; NEGRO QUESTION",

Bureau file number 100-3-110.

Mr. EPSTEIN asked SA SULLIVAN if he was familiar with

any of the above-mentioned documents. SA SULLIVAN stated that

he was not familiar with the above documents.

Mr. EPSTEIN then

asked if SA SULLIVAN conducted any investigation pertaining to the

CP and Mr. STANLEY LEVISON.

SA SULLIVAN stated that the only

investigation he can recall is when he received some documents

and was told to read the documents and disseminate the information

from these documents into the specific file having an interest

in the subject matter, and did not participate in any active

investigation of the CP in New York.

Mr. EPSTEIN asked who was the supervisor of the squad

investigating CP matters in 1964, and who was SA SULLIVAN'S

supervisor in 1964.

SA SULLIVAN

stated that JOHN KEARNEY

was the supervisor of the squad handling the investigation of

the CP, and RAYMOND RUCKEL was his supervisor in 1964.

Mr. EPSTEIN asked what agents handled the investigation

of the CP-USA; COINTELPRO-CP; and CP-Negro Question.

SA SULLIVAN

stated that he did not know, and would only be guessing if

he began to name persons.

Interview of Special Agent JOHN C. SULLIVAN

September 24, 1975

Washington, D. C.

Mr. EPSTEIN then asked who had the initials, "JJK" and

"JMK" .

SA SULLIVAN said that "JJK" is probably JOHN

KEARNEY,

but did not know who was

"JMK".

Mr. EPSTEIN said, could it be

JAMES KIRBY. SA SULLIVAN said it could be, but he did not

know KIRBY's middle initial.

Mr. EPSTEIN asked who was "JFO",

and SA SULLIVAN said he could not recall who had the initials,

"JEO".

Mr. EPSTEIN asked what stenographers had the initials,

"RMV" and "TNS". SA SULLIVAN said he did not know since the

documents on which these initials appear were typed in 1964.

Mr. EPSTEIN asked if SA SULLIVAN knew ALEXANDER

BURLINSON and where he is at the present time. SA SULLIVAN

stated that he knew Mr. BURLINSON and was last known to be living

in Scarsdale, NY.

Miss DeOREO mentioned Civil Rights violations.

SA SULLIVAN stated that Civil Rights is a separate matter and

has nothing to do with the topics being discussed.

Mr. EPSTEIN then wanted to know if SA SULLIVAN

conducted his investigation under Section 87 or Section 122 (of the

Manual of Instructions).

He was advised that cases were handled

under Section 122.

He also expressed an interest as to whether

or not the FBI investigated persons, such as 10 persons conducting a

peaceful picket demonstration.

SA SULLIVAN stated that the FBI

does not investigate peaceful picketing demonstrations, stating that

New York City averages about one strike a day and sometimes there

may be 5 to 10 demonstrations going on at once.

The interview began at 10:20 a.m. and ended at

11:04 a.m.

into

On 9/25/75, Mr. GENE DEAN, FBIHQ (black phone

extension 4587) called on the black phone.

He referred to

a NYO letter and LHM dated 5/6/66, captioned "JEREMY J.

STONE; IS-R", which was forwarded to the Bureau under New

York file number 105-OR. Mr. DEAN stated that he desired

to know the identity of the confidential source mentioned

in the IHM, which was described on page 1 of the cover letter

as "documentation anonymous". Mr. DEAN stated that he needed

this information to respond to a request from the Senate Select

Committee on Intelligence.

I located the letter and LHM as serials 47 and 48

in New York file 100-144383.

The New York yellow did indicate

that the original communication had been forwarded to the

• Bureau under file number 105-OR, but had been subsequently

placed into the preceeding 100 case.

I reviewed the 100 case

file and could find no further identification of the confidential

source mentioned in the LHM referred to by Mr. DEAN.

However,

after reviewing pages two and three of the New York letter dated

5/6/66, there was a strong indication that the confidential source

covered in the letter with the phrase "documentation anonymous"

was in fact our "z" coverage on the SMUN.

On the afternoon of 9/25/75, I contacted Mi. WILLIAM

CREGOR on the green phone and advised him of the above.

I told

him thatide could not be positive that the source was "z!" coverage,

but having read pages 2 and 3 of the pertinent New York cover

letter, there was a strong indication that the source was "z"

coverage:

SUBJECT: SENSTUDY, 1975

On 9/23/75 Bureau Supervisor JOHN THOMAS called

on the green phone and referred to our airtel under above

caption dated 9/19/75.

Mr. THOMAS stated that the closing

paragraph of our airtel stated that the NYo would not review

criminal intelligence files unless so advised by the Bureau.

(This relates to efforts being taken to locate in NYO files

information relating to a conference held in the NYO in 1962

or 1963, at which conference former SAC SCHMIT recalls brief-

ing Attorney General ROBERT KENNEDY on our mail intercept

program.)

criminal intelligence files in an effort to locate any record

of the 1962 or 1963 conference mentioned above, and specifically

any record of the fact that AG KENNEDY may have been briefed

on our mail intercept program.

I discussed

this matter with SAC EMERY and Super-

visors ROBERT G. SWEENEY and JAMES T. MULROY of Division V.

They advised that the pertinent file would be NY file 92-632,

which is titled "Criminal Intelligence Program."

On 9/24/75 sections of this file covering the period

1962-1965 were reviewed. No specific record was located as

to the topics discussed at the conference. There is a file

record that AG KENNEDY was in the NYO for a conference con-

cerning criminal intelligence matters in March of 1963.

' An

Agent currently assigned to Division V also recalls that

Mr. KENNEDY was in the NYO for another such conference in

November of 1963 although reference to the second conference

could not be located in the file.

On 9/24/75 I contacted Supervisor THOMAS and fur-

nished him the above information. Mr. THOMAS stated that

the NYO need not submit a communication on this matter.

The Bureau desires that every effort should

be

made to prevent any further use or dissemination of the

information developed by the Bureau in connection with

the mail intercept programs operated in the offices set

forth, the last of which was halted in 1966. To accomplish

this every office should take administrative steps to make

certain that any intormation which originated from the Sam

Survey, Gus Survey, Sun Survey, Joe Survey, CHIPROP,

CHICLET, CHICAN or Z Coverage is not included in any LHMS

or reports prepared for dissemination or is not furnished

to any Government agency in response to a name check request.

No attempt need be made to retriève information

which any office receiving this letter furnished to other

offices for lead purposes.

The main purpose for these

instructions is to make certain that the Bureau is not

involved in any further dissemination of any of this infor-

mation which was obtained from these surveys.
