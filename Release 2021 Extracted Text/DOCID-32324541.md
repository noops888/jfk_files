PAGI, a rifleman, MOS 1745, in

Company C, 38th Regiment,

?d Infantry

Division, was surrounded by an unknown Chinese unit and captured at Mug-gol,

22 May 1951. After his capture, PAGI was interned in Camp #1 from October

1951 until hio release at Panmunjon, Korea, 17 August 1953.

Prisoners were organized into units at the "Mining Camp" on the day of

PAGI's arrival.

Unit leaders were chosen by the Chinese Communist Forces (CCF),

apparently without regard to qualifications, and were retained until replaced

by the Chinese for failure to perform their duties, or for infraction of camp

rules or other reasons. PAGE performed duties in the Company Club for eight

months, and was in a study group from 1952 to 1953 (dates not given).

Initially, roll was called by the CCF; but later the platoon sergeant

took a head count and reported his findings

to the Chinese platoon leaders.

Armed guards were the only means of physical security employed by the CCF.

Chinese seemed to know what was going on in camp, but PAGE has no knowledge of

any counterintelligence system being employed.

Upon arrival at Camp #1, PACt was photographed by the CCF and was required

to hold a plaque bearing his name and serial number, but he was never finger-

In November 1951, prisoners in the camp werè forced to participate in

a propaganda movie:

They were completely equipped with United States equipment

and simulated the storming of a hill. The prisoners were told they would not

eat if they refused to participate in making this movie.

In November 1951, the

CCF asked for volunteers to make a movie in Pyoktong, North Korea. Frank Noel

took nunerous photographs of the men and camp life, they were propaganda pic-

tures and were supervised by the CUF.

PAGE was interrogated approximately fifteen (15) times by the CCF. Normal

interrogation lasted approximately two (2) hours.

PAGE filled out a general

questionnaire of approximately twenty-five (25) questions concerning PAGE's

unit, parents, financial status, etc.: The CCF were interested in artillery

personnel, reason unknown, and were always attempting to detect CID and CIC

Agents among the prisoners, results unknown.

prisoners and sponsored by the CCF.

This club took care of all con

bany matters concerning sports, mess, study groups, sanitation and

the library.

PAGi did not observe a ungazine called the "New Life;" however, "New Chiad,"

"Soviet Union," "National Guardian," "New York Dally Worker," "London Daily

Worker," and the "shanghai News," were all available to the prisoners.

No newspapers were printed in Camp #1; however, the paper "Towards Truth

and. Peace" was distributed in Camp #1.

PAGE voluntarily wrote approximately

hree articlos for this

Thomas Peasner, Bobby Detraw, John ford andratkins (fnu) also wrote articles.

Generally these articles concerned the Korean War, the cessation of hostilities

and prisoner exchange. Usually no retribution was given for the writing of

these articles; however, PAGI, on one occasion, received a half-carton of cig

Radio Moscow and Radio Peking were heard over

the camp public address

system.

These consisted of news broadcasts and music. No US broadcasts were

heard by anyone in the camp.

In 1951 and 1952; all prisoners were required to attend indoctrination

lectures, movies, broadcasts and company neetings.

These were compulsory poli-

tical discussions as low as squad level and periodically nonitored by the CCr.

In the summer of 1952, this program was greatly curtailed, with only occasional

compulsory group study. Books, magazines, movies, pictures, charts and personal.

contacts were used by camp authorities in

conducting indoctrination. Books, maga-

zines and movies were the most effective methods employed. Books and magazines

were of CCt choice and all contained propagunda material.

Prior to 1952, voluntary study groups were formed by the progressive ele

ments in Camp #1.

lach company had a voluntary study group that met at regi-

mental headquarters for neetings.

The Ces set aside a room in which the study

group would meet during the evenings.

When studying,

the prisoners would re-

ceive

tea and cigarettes.from

the CCE. The composition, as known to PAGI, was

as follows:

marijuana was punishable by a jail sentence of fifteen days; hovever, pro-

gressives were cautioned against this practice but it was condoned.. If these

progressives got into trouble, the punishment would not be as harsh as that

experienced by the "reactionaries."

Tenneson particularly collaborated with

camp authorities.

For infractions, of camp regulations

or the creation of disturbances, pris-

oners were required to sign a confession of the crime or infraction..

At times,

prisoners were required to read these confessions over the public address system,

usually dependent upon the gravity of the offense. Prisoners were jailed until

they agreed to sign confessions.

"Peace" letters were on the

basis of volun-

tary signatures with the document being placed where everyone in the company

could read it. This was usually in the library.

The following persons were imprisoned for alleged crimes, sentences and

charges as indicated. PAGE believes the following will be returned either on

or before the sixty day deadline imposed by the terms of the current truce.

Raymond L. Frazier - sentenced to two or three years for being drunk,

escaping camp, and attempting to rape a Korean.

Thompson Llvely - sentenced to two or three years for administering a

beating to Vernon s. Rea, a prisoner. a. P. Miller was named by the

Chinese as having informed that Lively had threatened Miller and sub-

sequently lead to Lively! imprisonment. This was told to PAGE by Lively.

Harry W. Fulks - same as for Lively.

the Chinese.

Carter (fnu) and Wilred J. Ruff - transferred during early months of 1952

allegedly for being the leaders of a Ku Klux Klan (KKK) organisation in

Camp 71.

according to a confession made by Flowers (fnu), the following prisoners

had conspired to beat up Miller, PAGE, Morris, Vaughn, Adelmann and Tenneson:

Flowers (fnu), Albert Coccia, Richard K. Makua, Andrew Mendoza and

Beaver (fnu) •

PAGH believed that the other prisoners in the company thought that PAGE

was responsible for turning these men in to the camp officials.

PAGE claims

that he does not recall what actually happened on the night these prisoners

were apprehended as he was "out of his head."

PAGI further claims that Vaughn

cold other prisoners that PAGI had informed on the reactionary group in order

to bring the alleged plot into the open and that Vaughn later admitted to

Beavers, Mendoza and Brooks, that PAGi was not guilty of informing to the

Chinese.

Jinny south was mistreated by the Chinese. In early 1953, the CCI selected

men in the company for interrogation in order to determine the names of prisoners

who smoked marijuana.

South told PAGI that he was taken from the company area

vived each time,

and was forced to resume

the position of attention.

South was

exceptionally weak when returned to the company but apparently did not suffer

any 11l effects.

Marijuana was available from Korean civilians but the Chinese

constantly tried to stamp out this practica.

Adelnann, William Warden, Noble

and Peasner were heavy snokers.

Collins (fnu), an airman and acquaintance of PAGH in 1952, stated that he

(Collins) was frequently interrogated on all Air force activities.

Of major

Interest to the Chinese, at that time, was the radio code used by aircraft.

Collins did not inform PAGE of the infornation or if any information had been

divulged to the CCI.

Some prisoners kept diaries for the purpose of keeping records of pris-

oners who died in the fl camp.

PAt does not know if these diaries were con-

fiscated by. the CCI.

PAGi, Tenneson and Miller circulated petitions in the camp.

PAGE believes

that the circulation of petitions helped to accomplish a cease fire. PAG™ be-

Iloves that Conmunism has some good points, namely collective farming.

would feed all persons, not a few." PAGE says he does not know if Comnunism

would work in the United States and "would not advocate a change in the Untted

States until he knew it was correct."

PAGE made a recording in January 1953 requesting UN forces to refrain

from bombing the PW camp.

PAGE was aided by Tenneson in the preparation of

the

text. PAGI made another recording in March 1953 concerning the cease fire,

the text of which was prepared by PAGE.

The CCF asked him. to.do it - no threats

were used. PAGE made the recordings voluntarily and they were transmitted over

Radio Peking.

In 1952, PAGE observed six uniformed Russians passing the camp in a truck.

There were no Russians stationed at Camp #1.

PAGE does not know of any prisoners who were not repatriated from Camp #l.

No American prisoners were encouraged by the Communists to remain in North Korea

or to go to Red China or the Soviet Union.

PAGi did not personally attend any lectures by USAF personnel concerning

bacteriological warfare; however, PAGa heard recordings and stated that "if an

American officer made recordings and speeches on germ warfare, on his own accord,

it might be true."

PAGE spent his off-duty time studying, playing chess, checkers, swimming,

walking and reading.

Camp officials who had daily contact with the prisoners were:

TShin (nu) - interpreter for the Regimental Commander.

Mong (fnu) - in charge of sports activities..

ATin (nu) - in charge of study groups, 4th Company.

Agent's Notes:

PAGE was inclined to contradict himself on several occasions.

At one time, PACE stated that Tenneson, Wills and DeGraw expressed desires to

be placed in neutral hands and not to be returned to the US. PAGE later stated

that he was unaware of anyone not repatriated from Camp i1.

PAGE also stated

that Tenneson, Wills and DeGraw were in good health when he last saw them in
