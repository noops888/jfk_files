On April 5, 1961, I-T advised SA'S VINCENT H. LAMMERS

and CLARK S. MILLER

that he is not aware of the source

information concerning the receipt of race results coming into

Little Rock.

SLOAN BENNETT, who gave T-7 $175.00 for use of

a room at I-7's residence during the 1901 Hot Springs, Arkansas,

(Oaklawn Race Track) racing season, advised I-7's wife that they

had a man at the track in Hot Springs who obtains the odds just

before post time, then leaves the track and calls Little Rock.

BENNETT did not advise T-7's wife the identity of the man at

the track or who he contacted in Little Rock with the information.

It has been I-l's experience that odds in Little Rock are okained

up to as late as two or three minutes before post time.

Results

of the race are obtained in Little Rock within seven to ten

minutes after the race is completed.

BENNETT stated on this

occasion to T-I's wife that the man at the track was reportedly

paid $15.00 a day for his work during previous years.

T-? advised he does not know for sure who is receiving

payoffs in connection with book operations in Little Rock.

one occasion I-7's wife received a call during the Hot Springs

meet from an individual who identified himself as HAYNIE,

I-? assumed was Captain ALBERT M. HAYNIE, Chief of Detectives,

Little Rock Police Department.

On this occasion the person

identifying himself only as HAYNIE instructed the wife of I-7

to have BENNETT (SLOAN) meet him at Granoff's Restaurant,

10th and Main Streets, Little Rock. Later T-7 overheard

BENNETT state he had to "Take care of that man at Granoff's."

T-7 advised that as far as can be determined DUNAWAY

"bookies"

Streets, Little Rock, by DUNAWAY or his representay fl; ll

On April 20, 1961, I'-8 advised GILVERT W

STRICKLAND that partnerhsip in the wire service in Little

Rock consists of HAROLD DUNAWAY, JUNE LYTLE and CECIE HILL.

additional customers during the Oaklawn race meet at Hot

Springs,

accoraing to I-o, among those customers

Rock receiving race wire service

from JOSEPH PORETTA, New Orleans, Louisiana, which is furnished

by telephone, services

four year-round customers in Little

Rock and four additional customers during the Oaklawn race

meet at Hot Springs, Arkansas. SLOAN BENNETT is one of the

customers serviced during the

Oaklawn race meet at Hot Springs,

Arkansas.

On January 25, 1961, T-10 advised SA JOHN H. LUPTON

there were two crap games being operated in downtown Little

Rock, one of which was being operated by JUNE LYTLE and

SLOAN BENNETT located upstairs at 908z Main Street, Little

Rock, Arkansas.

On April 25, 1961, I-ll advised SA EDWIN BROWN that

information gathered by a national business status reporting

agency compileddinformation on October 14, 1953, concerning

SLOAN BENNETT, owner of National Billiards Parlor, 910 Main

Street, Little Rock, Arkansas, and the information so compiled

was verified and brought up-to-date as of January 10, 1961.

The summary of this information so compiled indicates that

SLOAN BENNETT started the business of the National Billiards

at 910 Main Street, Little Rock, on September 21, 1953,

and at that time his net worth was estimated to be $6,100.00.

He made all payments in connection with this business in

cash and sales at the business amounted to approximately

$1,500.00 per month. He started out the business with a

heavy debt; however, the payment schedule probably was not too

heavy.

on September 7, 1961, I-T advised SAS JOHN J. JUREY

AND VINCENT H. LAMMERS as follows:

SLOAN BENNETT, known local Little Rock bookie,

continues

to operate his horse race booking business out of

the residence of I-7 on the Pine Bluff highway.

Informant estimated BENNETT nets between $200.00 and $300.00

per day.

Race results are being received from Hawthorne Race

rrack, Chicago, Illinois, within 20 minutes after race time.

It is T-7's information that the results are receivec

from Chicago directly to BENNETT's place of business, Ninth

and Main Streets, Little Rock.

T-? advised that he

understands the major bookmakers in Little Rock and vicinity

pay $900.00 a week for this service.

This amount is divided

betweelsil2. 0o per week.

a known local Little Rock gambler, has withdrawn himself from

actively participating on the local gambling scene.

HAROLD

DUNAWAY and C. J. LYTLE continue to operate out of 6112 East

Washington, North Little Rock.

On September 21, 1961, T-7 advised SA VINCENT H.

LAMMERS that ED HERNER

and BILLY McKIM were booking horses but

that according to a listing of gambling stamp holders set out

in a local Little Rock newspaper in August, 1961, HERNER and

McKIM do not have a stamp.

In addition to the above, T-? advised that horse

race booking operations in the Little Rock area ceased on

Friday, September 8, 1961, So far as T-7 is aware no one

is presently booking horses. He stated the word came

from BARNETT, who has been disseminating results of races

locally for

sometime.

In accordance with BARNETT's advice, SLOAN BENNETT

discontinued his operations in I-7's house on

September

8, 1961.

BENNETT iS

presently said to be playing dice and

cards in North Little Rock, exact location unknown.

SLOAN BENNETT has leased his business on Main Street,

Little Rock, to ARCHIE SASABEE (phonetic). T-7 is not

aware of the

length of the lease but was sure that BENNETT has

no active part in the operations.

visitéd SASABEE's place of business on a number of occasions

but observed no gambling machines or games of any kind in

operation.

Informant advised that he has concluded from

bits of information coming to his attention over the past

two weeks to a month that the bookmakers are making some

type of plans for circumventing the recent laws passed by

Congress as they relate to interstate transmission of gambling

information. One plan is to use companies

stock market.

For an example, I-? stated the horses

will be given the names of firms listed on the stock market.

They will then identify the position of the three lead horses

by the price of the stock, such as 285, meaning

• that horse #2

came in last, #8 came in second, and #5 came in third.
