20 January 1977 Column

Titled "CIA Tied to False Oswald Story.

B. Identification of the Mr. X in the

Anderson Column

1.

The attached column, citing the testimony of a Mr. X,

alleges that a CIA agent

tried to link Oswald

to Cuban intelli-

gence officers in Mexico.

There is, of course, no substance to

the column's allegations. The

column identifies the source as

Mr. X because of

enough information on Mr. X to

a tempes on bestaffish his identity.

subsequently gives

2.

According to the Anderson column, Mr. X was first met

by his

CIA contact in Havana before

relations with U.S., Cuba were

severed.

Mr. X had helped to organize bank accountants to em-

bezzle Cuban government funds to

finance anti-Castro causes.

Mr. X was reportedly recruited by a Morris Bishop (CIA contact),

to "plan an attempt on Castro's life.

The plan was to fire a

bazooka

from

a nearby apartment building while Castro was deliver-

ing one

of his marathon speeches. According to the Anderson

the plot was discovered by Castro's police and Mr. *

escaped to Miami. Mr. X also reportedly tried to assassinate

Castro in Chile in 1971 in league with the Venezuelan Luis Posada

Carriles, who is now being detained in Caracas for the 6 October

Cubana airline bombing.

The Anderson column ends with

the report

that

Mr. X worked for CIA until.

1975 for expenses,

but was

pilld

$253,000 in cash by Morris Bishop when he was terminated.

From the

above description of Mr. X, it is, reasonably

clear that Mr. X is Antonio Carlos VECIANA Blanch (201-312966).

VECIANA, an

assistant bank manager and past president of a public

accountants

issociation in Havana, first contacted CIA in

Havana

in December 1960 when he asked the COS, at that time James A. Nock,

to help in an assassination plot against Castro. VECIANA asked

for visas for ten relatives of the four men

assigned to kill Castro,

and also

requested four MI

rifles with adapters for grenades plus

eight grenades.

The COS did not encourage VECIAN and subsequently

checked. with

an Embassy officer who reported that VECIANA had made

similar "wild-eyed" proposals to him..

On 23 November 1961 the

Miami News published a report of

an unsuccessful attempt by Antonio

VECIANA to kill Castro:

VECIANA reportedly had arranged to

assassinate Castro and. Cuban President Osvaldo Dorticos on 5 October

in Havana, but the bazooka he

was using failed to fire.

4.

. There has been no Agency relationship with VECIANA. A

POA, which was granted for his use in

para-military affairs in

January 1962, expired in November 1962.

VECIANA was born

4 October 1935 in Havana.

He ivas a member of the People's Revo-

lutionary Movement,

an anti-Castro group in Cuba during 1960-61, and

was one

of the founders of Alpha-66.

A certified public accountant

by trade, VECIANA was with A.I.D: in La Paz in 1908-72. VECIANA

was registered in ISR to the U.S. Army in November 1962 and he

was terminated without prejudice in July 1966.

On 23 July 1962

VECIANA was interviewed, at his request, by Mr. Harry Real from

the DCD New York office. VECIANA asked Real to arrange a meeting

with a senior CIA officer to discuss

Alpha-66's plans to assassinate

Castro and to

request CIA's assistance (U.S. $100,000; 10,000 Cuban

pesos; 48 hand grenades). There is no indication that this request.

was ever acted

upon by CIA.

"5.

In April

1966 a LA Division officer, John R. Lucy, using

the alias John Livingston, met VECIANA in New York City.

The

meeting was

arranged by a retired naval officer, James Cogswell,

who had informed Chief, Wil Division that he had information of valuc

concerning Cuba.

When Lucy arrived in New York City for the meeting;

he was introduced by Cogswell to VECIANA.

imnediately launched

a discussion of the Cuban political situation

noted

his

strong

feeling that the only solution was

the assassination of Castro.

Lucy advised VECIANA that

he was in no position to provide him

assistance or encourage him in an assassination attempt and was only

interested

in gathering information which he thought was the fellose

of the meeting.

VECIANA subsequently said that his

roommate

ZABALA, a Cuban refugee, had excellent contacts in Havana. It was

clear to Lucy, however, VECIANA was attempting to use ZABALA poten-

tially to get

Agency financial support for his organization.

VECTANA suggesied that 550,000 would be needed to get his

activities off the ground.

Lucy indicated to VECIANA that he

would look into the

"ZABALA matter and would probably arrange for

ZABALA to be "contacted in Puerto Rico.

6.

There is no indication in the file that any Agency officei

in contact with VECIANA ever used an alias Morris Bishop.

There

is

no Morris Bishop listed in

true name

in the DDO rolls.

There was

never any contractual relationship with VECIANA and he was. not

paid CIA funds.

?. On I'1 January 1977 a sanitized copy of VECIANA's 201 file

was made available to staffers from the Senate Select Committee on

Intelligence.
