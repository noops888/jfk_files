This report is a chronological

compilation of debriefings prepared following the daily meetings

of liardy with the FBI Agents assigned as his contacts.

The

report is attached. The refutations of Mr. Hardy's testimony

Hardy Allegation

"On June 24, 1971, a long-time friend of

mine was having dinner at my home.

He was

upset. He had been active in the anti-war

movement in our area.

He related to me that

a plan to enter the Camden Draft Board hac

been discovered by the FBI and had fallen

through. "

Response

Page 2, Paragraph 2

He was coming to the FBI becausé he was

troubled by something that a good friend of his

(MIKE GIOCONDO) was trying to get him involved

in. GIOCONDO had approached him concerning a

"draft board demonstration

like the one the

BERRIGANS were involved in."

Paragraph 3

GIOCONDO wanted his assistance in finding places

for large groups of people to stay overnight,

in finding a meeting hall, and the use of his

truck. (he assumed that the truck would be

used to move groups of people. His truck could

transport up to 20 people at one time.

G.TOCONDO

mentioned that there are about 25 people in the

area who are working on the matter and that

there are about 200 more who will be coming

to

the area from New York State and Pennsylvania

to provide assistance.

The planning has been

going on for about 6 to 8 weeks, and GIOCONDO

has told him that many of the "ex-religious"

people involved in the movement are people who

have been known to both GIOCONDO and him for

quite some

time...

Paragraph 4

GIOCONDO has mentioned that the target site has

been photographed and has been under extended

surveillance by members of the group.. the group

meets nightly.

Paragraph 6

GIOCONDO wants him to meet the leader of the

movement in this area who is a white male with

the editorial staff of "Jubilee Magazine."

Page 3, Paragraph 2

GIOCONDO has indicated to him that the "hit"

would take place within 2 or 3 weeks.

(From

first conversation with HARDY of June 25, 1971.)

Page 6, Paragraphs 3 & 4

HARDY asked GIOCONDO if they were still going to

go through with the "draft thing in Canden."

this GIOCONDO replied "definitely."

GIOCONDO

said, "We're going to make a hit there."

(HARDY's

report to the FBI of his conversation with MIKE

GIOCONDO on the afternoon of June 25; 1971.)

Page: 11, Paragraphs. 4 & 5

HARDY advised that GRADY and his group are doing

a considerable amount of surveillance on the

Camden Post Office for the particular purpose of

watching the night watchman make his rounds inside

the Post Office.

HARDY felt that the break-in

will occur

some time between I a.nn. and 4 a.m.

on a Monday morning.

HARDY advised that the break-in will occur within

the next couple of weeks and that GRADY and his

group are surveiling the Camden Post Office

from the rooftop of the Town House Apartments on

meeting with the group on June 29, 1971.)

• Page Paragraphs Paragraphs: 2 & 3

HARDY advised that ANTOINETTE has been able to

get inside the Post Office on one occasion and

from her observations got a rough floor plan

of the 4th floor.

This floor plan does not go

into too nuch detail. He stated that when they

apparently worried about the 4th floor for some

reason or reasons unknown to him. He advised

he did not know the exact details of hor

HARDY advised that he has been given an assign-

ment to go into the Post Officeland get a detailec

floor plan of the uth and 5th floors, specifically.

looking. for any electrical tape alarm systems

on the windows. HARDY made the

observation that

they are going to come into the Post Office

through a window on the 5th floor. GRADY and

his group are concerned about the key system as

far as security measures are concerned.

They

want to know exactly where alarm systens are located

They also want to know how many windows and how

many windows line up with other offices on the

4th floor in order that they can check the guard's

movements when they have the Post Office under

surveillance.

"The following day, I went to the FBI Office in

Camden and asked them for advice.

I told them I

did not want my friends to go to jail. They told

me at the time, just to keep them posted on

developments.

I then went to the group of people

I had just

mentioned, and in a short time they had

taken me into their confidence as a member and

Page 57, Paragraph 3

HARDY advised that last night, July 6, 1971, he

received a telephone call from MIKE GIOCONDO.

JOHN GRADY had called him and asked him to come

out a little bit earlier than

when the group

normally meets. GRADY stated to MIKE that he

wanted to go over some slides and plans and to

prepare GENE DIXON and HARDY for their entrance

into the draft board this afternoon for

the purpose

of gathering more information.

GENE DIXON engaged him in a conversation relating

to the proposed visit by DIXON and HARDY to the

draft board and that tentative arrangements were mad.

to meet at the White lower at 3 p.m., this afternoon

The plan was then to go to the Post Office and

visit the draft board. HARDY advised that one

of the things that they were instructed to find.

out while in the draft board is. the physical

eography of the front as far as the alarm systen

and fire escape is concerned. He noted GRADY's grOup

tab-asses

is only interested in the lA classifications.

One of the other things that they are to

definitely observe is the location of the

watchman's key.

HARDY again related that they

were instrueted to check and see if there were

any alarns on the doors and windows and to

check the name on the filing, cabinets so that

GRADY could know the type of lock on the cabinets.

He noted that there is a possibility that GRADY's

could obtain a master key from KIRK, a fellow

in Philadelphia.

They were also instructed to

look for power sources in case the group that

goes into the draft board decides to take electric

drills.

HARDY advised that his second main objective along

with DIXON is to check the

second and

third

floors on the 5th Street wing.

GRADY wanted to

know the

exact location

and what offices are

located where.

CHARDY's report to the FBI of

a meeting with GRADY's group on July 6, 1971.)

Page 59, Paragraphs 1 & 5

HARDY related that the third objective is to

get down into the mail room and see if there is

an alarm panel box for the fire escape and to see

if it is clearly marked.

HARDY made the observation

that there is the possibility that someone from

GRADY's group could get down into the mail room

and turn off the alarm.

HARDY related that while he was with GIOCONDO en

route to the own House Apartments, he had learned

from GIOCONDO that GIOCONDO had met two of GRADY'S

people from the Philadelphia group, but that he

only met then by their first names.

HARDY Learned

that these two people are an ANNE (LNU) and a

BETH (LNU).

He explained that both are white

girls about 22 years old and that they work at the

bookstore in the vicinity of Temple University.

He explained that the reason

the Philadelphia group

has not been brought into this action is that they

are more radical than GRADY and they dress in a

more hippie type style, and that they play around

with the drug scene a little bit.

He explained

that GRADY has a low opinion of them.

HARDY explained that another topic of conversation.

with MIKE GIOCONDO was the East Coast Conspiracy

to Save Lives.

He advised that he pressed

GIOCONDO for more information about this group

and the 200 people that were mentioned

earlier.

GIOCONDO

answered the question by stating that

he had pressed GRADY in the early stages of this

thing but that GRADY had always pushed it aside

and pushed. GIOCONDO very hard to recruit people

for this particular action. HARDY advised that

at the meeting GRADY had stated to him that he

was involved in the Dow Chemical action in Michigan.

GRADY did not say what the names were of-those

involved but stated that it was a simple operation.

(HARDY's report to the FBI of a meeting with

GRADY'S

group on July 6; 1971.)

Page 65, Paragraph 4

HARDY mentioned that GRADY had decided that one

of the things that he would like to have checked

would be to see whether or not the employees of

the Post Office actually sign out when they léave

the Post Office for the day.

GRADY had mentioned

to him that it might be possible for several

people to go into the Post Office together during

the day and for all of them, except one, to hide

in the Post Office while one of the group would

leave and sign the entire group out at the register.

GRADY's group on July 7, 1971.)

Page 67, Paragraphs 2, 3, & 4

GRADY mentioned POPPI SHARPE during the meeting

last night, and it was apparent to HARDY that

GRADY has been talking extensively with POPPI

SHARPE

from time to time. GRADY mentioned that POPPI

SHARPE's favorite thought was

that "you have

to

put the

fear back into the man" (meaning the

establishment). GRADY has mentioned how POPPI

SHARPE feels

that only when the authorities fear

the people will they respect them.

HARDY mentioned that GRADY desires that he and

DIXON go into the FBI office in Canden under suitabl

pretext so that they might learn of information

relating to the alarm and security systems of the

with some of the Philadelphia group.

They have

started calling them (the Philadelphia group)

at certain times.

After the evening meal was finished, he went into

the living room area with GRADY, ANITA and COOKIE

and they talked at length about the proposed

breakin and the problems they have come up against

Page: 72; Paragraph 3:

GRADY related this story with first-hand knowledge:

GRADY again emphasized that he has been the key

man in 14. out of 18 draft board hits within the

last 2-1/2 years. GRADY said that he was the one

who developed the style for the break-ins.

GRADY

said he is now developing the style for outside

break-ins.

meeting with GRADY's group on July 8; 1971.)

Page 72, Paragraph 5

JOHN GRADY mentioned that this was the first time

they tried to hit a draft board from the outside

## Page 17

that in the past they have gone into a

community where there

was some indication that

there were sympathizers in the area.

The sympa-

thizers would then set up observations

for three

to four weeks. GRADY

and his assistants would

come into the area and spend another week doing

detail work.

The "old actors" would then come

an and spend two or three days assembling, con-

ducting dry runs, and getting the general

of the area.. After this the hit would be made

and they would then disperse, leaving three or

four local people behind.

GraDy thought that the group was being watched.

GIOCONDO related to him that Mrs. GRADY was

sitting on the front porch of the ANDERSON residence

and noticed a Volkswagen bus which was parked in

front of the residence.

The man sitting in this

bus was staring at the house.

This took place

in front of the house for a few minutes.

HARDY mentioned that earlier in the day of July 9,

they had been talking with some of the

"old

actors" from North Jersey. They, COOKIE and

ANITA, mentioned that some of these "old actors"

would be coming down fron North Jersey on Sunday

He further advised that as requested to

do so

by GRADY, he had at 5 o'clock on July 9, 1971;

observed

the Postal employees as they left the

Post Office building.

GRADY's interest in the

departure of the Postal employees was to

determine if every individual was required to

sign out before leaving. On that same afternoon,

he saw COOKIE and ANITA downtown:

(HARDY'S

report to the FBI Of a meeting with GRADy'S

It was also mentioned that a girl named ANN

(last name unknown) from Philadelphia and the ANN

for whom there is a warrant in Delaware both worked

at

the Temple Book Store with COOKIE and ANITA.

From what GRADY said on Friday night, it appeared

as if there was a draft board hit planned for the

Irenton area that never came off as yet.

It was

mentioned by the group that they had already

done the preparations for a hit in Irenton, but

for some reason

the hit was not made.

They have

talked of going

back to Trenton after the Camden

hit to make the hit at Trenton which had previously

been worked

out.

GRADY is planning to run a surveillance with his

people tonight. GRADY intends to surveil the

Post Office Building from the churchyard. As he

has done in the past, GRADY will play the xole

of the "drunken Irishman" if any passersby or

police wander into the area. Plans call for

the entire group to be on the scene at the .

surveillance.

on July il, 1971.)

Page 81, Paragraphs 3,4, 5, & 6!

HARDY advised that POPPI SHARPE had been contacted.

apparently by GRADY during the past week and that

he has committed eight people for the exterior

defense on the night of the action. SHARPE'S

people are to create some kind of

a problem if

It is needed. HARDY explained this would be some

sort of a diversionary

away fron the post office tic to call attention

Nothing more was

said about the napalming of the army tank in

front of the Reserve Center in Camden, although

it had been referred to during the course of the

discussion some half a dozen times:

HARDY advised anöther name was brought up. This

person might possibly become involved in the action

and from GRADY's comment this person has experience

and has

participated in past actions. GRADY

mentioned the name BUSBUY or BUZZARD. HARDY

advised GRADY did not go into detail regarding

BUSBUY.

• HARDY advised next Sunday, July 18, 1971, at 6 p.m.,

MEL MADDEN and TERRY, along with those people they

will be able to bring, will report to the ANDERSON's

home for a briefing and will then be paired off

with

some of the people who are already involved

in the Camden action.

The tentative

"hit time"

is going to be between 11:30 p.M., and 12:30 a.m.

As yet GRADY and his group have not set the time

for sure.

He explained the surveillance workings as follows:

surveillance comnenced at 11:30

.am. with every-

one in the pre-arranged checkpoints.

Observations

were made for a full ten minutes

and then at 11:40 p.

observations were again made as if 11:30 did not

happen. These are carried out every ten minutes

until approximately 12:20 a.m.

This information

which

is compiled by each member of the surveillance

is then discussed the next evening and each person

at the prescribed times states what was seen. For

example, there was a patrol

car on Market Street

at 11:30 p.m., so that would knock out the 11:30 to

11:40 time frame: Another example given by HARDY

was that at 11:50 p.m., the watchman looked out.

the bathroom window.

FBId a meetin; with GRADY's group on July 11, 1971.

Page 88, Paragraph. 4

HARDY stated.that GRADY mentioned the Wilmington,

Del., draft board break-in in the context that

he was showing MEL MADDEN and TERRY that he and

his group had gone to some extremes to make this

action successful. GRADY related in the men's.

room in the building where the draft board is

located

there is a suspended ceiling. GRADY related

some of his group lifted the panels out and slung

hammocks in the ceiling. On the night of the action

four men went into the men's room and hung in the

hammocks for about six hours.

Then, after closing

hours, it was just a matter of dropping through.

the ceiling and then proceeding to the draft board.

GRADY related that TONY SCOBLICK was. the person

who actually picked up the people who were inside

the building in a van.

4:45 in the morning to do their job on the draft

board because from previous surveillances GRADY

knew that the State Police only checked the building

at 4:35 a.m. GRADY went on to say that the group

inside the draft board was originally supposed

to come out the front door and that they put ply-

wood panels against the glass in the front door

so no one could see in the draft board offices.

He went on to say after closing hours one of the

persons

inside had a power drill and was attempting

to drill the lock out but that he had a bad bit,

so this person went to the back door and just popped

it open and then the van pulled up from around

back and everyone who was in the draft. board got

into the van and drove away.

GRADY mentioned

a participant in the Wilmington;

Plans for the hit at the drait board in Camden,

N. J..,

as discussed by JOHN GRADY, call for

team would

then use a ladier as

a brace against the fire escape. Members of

the team would then enter the fire escape and

go up the fire escape to the point where the

fixe escape leads to the window of the local

draft board.

Plans call for one walkie-talkie

to be with the people who are on the roof of

the Townhouse Apartments and for one walkie-

talkie to be with the group that goes into the

draft board.

HARDY mentioned that the idea of hitting the Army

Intelligence Office was brought forth by COOKIE

Upon this being mentioned, GRADY made some mention

that it would be important to figure out how

JOHN GRADY questioned GOOD as to what the Defense

committee would do with regard to the proposec

hit in Camden.

GOOD told GRADY that the Defense

Committee was totally uninterested in anything

that JOHN GRADY is doing at the moment.

It was

brought out during the conversation that a

man

named PAUL, whose last name begins with "M"

(HARDY could not

recall the

last name), is on

the Defense Committee

GOOD mentioned

that there was at least.$100,000 in the war

changed. Upon greeting GRADY, PAUL related

that the FBI had been to see him (PAUL) on Tuesday

wanting to know the whereabouts of JOHN GRADY,

and also wanting information regarding a car

bought by GRADY from him about a year and a half

ago.

It

was PAUL's impression that the FBI has

this vehicle in their possession at this moment

in the Philadelphia area

and that this car came

to the FBI's attention with regard to the Phila-

delphia draft board actions.

PAUL also believes

that

: he (PAUL) is under surveillance due to the

fact that he has been a financial supporter of

various draft board actions. PAUL indicated that

he had provided financial

support and also trans-

portation in connection with previous draft board

hits. After leaving "Paul's Motors" which is a

Volvo dealership, they went to East Orange

to MEL MADDEN's apartment. GRADY had considered

going into

New York City instead of East Orange

because he desired to confront some of the people

He also observed that

GRADY is very tired due to the fact that he has

said to COOKIE that he was tired of being the

MADDEN stated that after the draft board hit

was completed, the group should sit down and

discuss what further activities would be under-

taken by this particular segment of the East

"At first, the FBI instructed me not to present

any new thoughts or ideas to the group.

However, after a while they encouraged me to

suggest to the group the exact illegal

activities about which I had originally come to

them.

evidence of a conspiracy to raid the draft

board. They told me that this would be a lot

better than if some of my friends were chargec

with the actual crime itself. I was greatly

confused at this time, but I trusted the FBI,

and eventually I carried out their wishes.

provocateur. They told me to continue.

feels that this is due to GRADY's magnetism and

that it is of an intense quality so as to overcome

the average person who is not ready to cope with it.

HARDY again

questioned GRADY as to whether he would

the Media files have been released.

draft board and that tentative arrangements were ma

to meet at the white Tower at 3 p.m., this afternoo

The plan was then to go to the Post Office and

visit the draft board. HARDY advised that one

of the things that they were instructed to find

out while in the draft board is the physical

geography of the front as far as the alarm system

and fire escape is concerned. He noted GRADY's grou

is only interested in the lA classifications.

One of the other things that they are to

definitely observe is the location of the

watchman's key. HARDY again related that they.

were inscructed to check and see if there were

any alarms on the doors and windows and to

check the name on the filing cabinets so that

GRADY could know the type of

lock on the cabinets.

He noted that there is a possibility thai GRADY's

group could catain a master key from KIrk, a fellow

in Philadelphia.

They were also instructed to

look for power sources in case the group that

goes. into the draft board decides to take electric

drills.

HARDY advised that his second main objective along

with DIXON is to check the second and third

floors on the 5th Street wing.

GRADY wanted to

know the exact location and what offices are

located where.

a meeting with GRADY's group on July 6, 1971.

HARDY related. that the third objective is to

get down into the mail room and see if there is

an alarm panel box for the fire escape and to see

if it is clearly marked.

HARDY made the observation

that there is the possibility

that someone from

GRADY's group could get down into the mail room

and turn off the alarm.

HARDY related that while he was with GIOCONDO en

route to the Town House Apartments, he had learned

From GIOCONDO that GIOCONDO had met two of GRADY'S

people from the Philadelphia group, but that he

only met them by their first names.

HARDY learned

that these two people are an ANNE (LNU) and a

BETH (LNU). He explained that both are white

girls about 22 years old and that they work at the

bookstore in the vicinity of Temple University.

He explained that the reason the Philadelphia group

has not been brought into this action is that they

are more radical than GRADY and they dress in a

more hippie type style, and that they play around

with the drus scene a little bit. He explained

that GRADY has a low opinion of them.

that the pressed

GIOCONDO for more information about this group

and the 200 people that were meritioned earlier.

GIOCONDO answered the question by stating that

he had pressed GRADY in the early stages of this

thing but that GRADY had always pushed it aside

and pushed GIOCONDO very hard to recruit people

for this particular action.

HARDY advised that

at the meeting GRADY had stated to him that he

was involved in the Dow Chemical action in Michigan

GRADY did not say what the names were of those

involved but stated that it was a simple operation.

HARDY mentioned that GRADY had decided that one

of the things that he would like to have checked

would be to see whether or not the employees of

the Post Office actually sign out when they leave

the Post Office for the day.

GRADY had mentioned

to him that it might be possible for several

people to go into the Post Office together during

leave and sign the entire group out at the register.

GRADY has been talking extensively with POPPI SHARPE

from time to time. GRADY mentioned that POPPI.

SHARPE's favorite

thought was that "you have to

put the fear back into the man" (meaning the

establishment). GRADY has mentioned how POPPI

SHARPE feels

that only when the authorities fear

the people will they respect them.

HARDY mentioned that GRADY desires that he and

the pretext of trying to learn from the FBI the

procedure used in investigating an ex-convict

who applies for a job with the Post Office.

MARTHA

SHEMLEY and GENE DIXON also mentioned the pros-

pects of going into the FBI Office. As the plans

stand now, the draft board is target #1. Army

• Intelligence is possibly a

second target and, if

it is feasible, the FBI Office would be the third

target.

From conversations with the group, HARDY has

Trenton area that never came off as yet. It was

mentioned by the group chat they had

already

done the preparations

For a hit in Trenton,

for some reason the hit was not made. They have

talked of going back to Trenton after the Camden

HARDY advised that POPPI SHARPE had been contacted

apparently by GRADY during the past week and that

he has committed eight people for the exterior

defense on the night of the action. SHARPE's

people are to create some kind of

a problem if

It is needed. HARDY explained this

would be

some

sort of a diversionary tactic to call attention

away from the post office.

Nothing more was

said about the napalming of the army tank in

front of the Reserve Center in Camden, although

it had been referred to during the course of the

discussion some half a dozen times.

HARDY advised another name was brought up.

This

person might possibly become involved in the action

and from GRADY's comment this person has experience

and

has participated in past actions. GRADY

mentioned the name BUSBUY or BUZZARD. HARDY

advised GRADY did not go into detail regarding

BUSBUY.

HARDY advised next Sunday, July 18, 1971, at 6 p.m.,

## Page 69

NW 65994 Docld:32989694 Page 69

The surveillance commenced at 11:30 a.m. with

every

one in the pre-arranged checkpoints..

Observations

were made for a full ten minutes and then at 11:40

observations were again made as if 11:30 did not

happen.

These are carried out every ten minutes

until approximately 12:20 a.m. This information

which is compiled by each member of the surveillance

is then discussed the next evening and each person

at the prescribed times states what was seen.

FOr

example, there was a patrol car on Market Street

at 11:30 p.m., so that would knock out the 11:30 to

•111:40 time frame. Another example given Dy HARDY

was that at 11:s0 p.m., the watchman looked out

the bathroom window.

action successful.

GRADY related in

the men's

room in the building where the draft board is locat

there is a suspended ceiling. GRADY related

some of his group lifted the panels out and slung

hammocks in the ceiling. On the night of the actio

four men went into the men's room and hung. in the

hammocks for about six hours.

Then,

after closing

hours, it was just a matter of aropping. through

the ceiling and then proceeding to the draft board.

GRADY related that TONY SCOBLICK was the person

who actually picked up the people who were inside

the building in a van. The people knew they had un

4:45 in the morning to do their job on the draft

board because from previous surveillances GRADY

Knew that the State Police only checked the buildin

at 4:35 a.m.

GRADY went on to say that the group

inside the draft board was originally supposed

to come out the front door and

that they put ply-

wood panels against the glass in the front door

so no öne could see in the draft board offices.

He went on to

say after closing hours one of the

persons inside had a power drill and was attempting

to drill the lock out but that he had a bad bit,

so this person went to the back door and just poppe

it open and then the van pulled up iron around

back and everyone who was in the draft. board rot

into the van and drove away. GRADY mentioned

JOHN GRADY questioned GOOD as to what the Defense

Committee would do with regard to the proposed

hit in Canden. GOOD told GRADY that the Defense

Committee was totally uninterested in anything

that JOHN GRADY is doing at the noment.

It was

brought out during the conversation that a

man

named PAUL, whose last name begins with

"M"

(HARDY could not recall the lasy name), is on

the Defense Committee in New York.

GOOD mentioned

that there was at least $100,000 in the war

chest.of the Defense Committee in New York City

the FBI had been to see him. (PAUL) on Tuesday

wanting to know the whereabouts of JOHN GRADY,

and also wanting information regarding a car

Dought by GRADy from him about a year and a hal

ago.

It was

PAUL's impression that the FBI has

this vehicle in their possession at this moment

in the Philadelphia

area

and that this car came

to the FBI's attention with regard to the Phila-

delphia draft board actions:

PAUL also believes

that he (PAUL.) is under surveillance due to the

fact that he has been a financial supporter of

JERRY MESHNICK in his World Federalist group and

also due to the fact that for the last couple of

supporter of the East Coast

Conspiracy to Save Lives and also a supporter of

various draft board actions.

PAUL indicated that

he had provided financial

support and also trans-

portation in connection with

previous draft board

hits.

After leaving "Paul's Motors" which is a

Volvo dealership, they went to bast orange,

N.J.,

to MEL MADDEN'S

apartment. GRADY had considered

going into

New York City instead of East Orange

because he desired to confront some of the people

on the Defense Conmittee who were in his (GRADY'S)

it would be unwise to go to New York

City and decided instead to go to East Orange.:

They were careful in driving to MADDEN's, packing

approximately a block away from MADDEN's

apartment.

As he (HARDY) came out of the apart

ment, Mrs: ELIZABETH MADDEN was driving up in her

vehicle.

When GRADY saw her he got out of the

car and called her and they all went into

MADDEN's apartment.

ELIZABETH MADDEN is an Irish

girl with dark black hair.

She has a small daughte

about eight months old named COLLEEN. ELIZABETH

MADDEN will be going to Ireland for four weeks

this coming Friday.

She appeared to be knowledgeas

as to her husband's involvement with the group.

MEL MADDEN and MIKE GIOCONDO and BUSBY arrived

shortly thereafter. A man by the name of STEVE,

who lives in the same apartment house on the first

floor and who works in the drug progran with

MADDEN, also came to the apartment.

(HARDY' S

When MEL MADDEN questioned

GRADY

with regard to the definite time and

date of the hit, GRADY replied that the hit

would take place within the next ten to four-

GRADY also mentioned that if the

hit was not made within the next fourteen days,

then it would have to be cancelled. ANITA

mentioned that a prime consideration

within

It was nentioned that if the group is able

to determine a stable pattern,

that they

possibly will be able to get six or seven

people on to the rooi, and that perhaps one

on two of them could

"take a shot' at the

Army Intelligence Office or even the FBI

Office.

The group is now considering a Saturday

night as well as sunday night as the possible

night fox the hit. The reason for this is

that from their surveillance, they have found

that the various patterns on

Saturdays rould

possibly be more conducive for a successfu)

hit than those on sundays.

It was mentioned

that DIXON's apartment would be used

as-sleeping

quarters for some of the "old actors" who would

be coming in for the hit.. Dr. ANDERSON's flat

on Broadway and Royden; above his office, and

MIKE GIOCONDO's apartnent would

also be used

as sleeding quarters

for those "old actors"

who would be coming in for the hit.

Those members of the group who conduct

surveillances

from the Rutgers Law School

are able to gain entry through the door on

the 5th Street side.. This is a door with

a plywood panel which is wired. They have

snapped the wires and re-wrapped them with

their fingers, making it possible with very

little effort for then to lift the panel and

thereby gain entry. Surveillances fron the Law

School are conducted either from the fifth

1100r, south side offices, or. from the roottop

itself.

ANITA mentioned that

fron the Law School,

that she could

see his, HARDY's, van, which

was located in the alley behind

the Post Office.

She also mentioned that she had a very good view

of the Post Office building.

GOOD had mentioned that he was able to recruit

four or

five people fron New York for this

operation.

GRADY still plans to be on the rooftop of the

Town House

Apartments at the time of the hit.

The members of the groun feel that the

critical corners are the 4th and Markct

Streets corner and the lth and Cooper

Streets corners. They feel that if these

corners remain open for about 90 seconds,

that they will be successful in setting

all then peonle trom the van onto the rooi

of the Post Office building. Plans call for

two cars to be used to block those inter-

sections, in the

event of the approach of

a police car, while people are gaining entry

to the Post Office building:

Plans

would

call for one car to begin a turn while the

other: car would start to signal. for another

turn, which would result in blocking the

street. The driver of one of the cars would

then get out of his autonobile and so to

the police car, and. ask directions for Fair-

that he has been working in the peace movement.

MURPHY explained that

the church has given him

and three other Jesuit Priests a leave of absence,

whereby they retain their priestly status but

do not get paid by the church.

MURPHY said that the charges against the BERRIGANS

GRADY feels that the police

activity at this time would be the minimum, due

GRADY has said that if the action does not

take place within ten days, that he would

• leave the area.

GRADY indicated that he has a problem with

the Defense Committee in that they (the

Defense Committee) want to work only with

the defense of the people who have been arrested

in connection with various actions, whereas

GRADY wants them to provide money for offense,

that is the actual performing.of actions.

GRADY has indicated that the Defense Comnittee

is more interested in coming in after the action

is over and helming the people who have been

charged: and arrested.

GRADY has said that he was one of the main organ

of "this thing," two and one-half years ago,

but that new people have come into the onganization

and taken over.

GRADY said that these people

do not have the same feeling in respect for GRADi'

thoughts as he would prefer them to have.

GRADY indicated that he made a break with the

group several months ago, and that now

he is

attempting to retain his position within the

group.

GRADY indicated that he is doing this

because he feels that he needs the group.

COOKIE said that she has never seen GRADY

was due to the heavy effects of the surveil

lances, or casings; the fact that he has had

to spend much time

away from his family; and

other factors. COOKIE felt that another reason

GRADY related this story with first hand knowledge.

GRADY again emphasized that he has been the key

man in l4 out of the l8 draft board hits within

the last 22 years

(HARDy's report to the FBI. of

his meeting with GRADY's grOUp On July 8, 1971).

GRADY said he is

On Wodnesday afternoon, while in GENE DIXON's

apartment

was the first time tha cooKtE had mentioned

the "old actors," referring to those who had:

been involved in drait board break-ins before.

Last night, the issue came up again and COOKIE

said she had to call ANN (last name unknown)

in Philadelphia, last night after midnight.

After midnight,

she did

go to the public

tolephone booth in front of the Camden County

Police Office and made several phone calls.

procedure in making the calls is for COOKIE to

call one number

where ANN will answer. ANN will

then hang up and go to another phone booth,

which has been predetermined, and COOKiE will call

her there.

They do this to insure that ANN is

not being followed. ANN and another girl, whose

name was

not mentioned, weres

according to COOKIE

and ANITA, to pick them (COOKTE and ANITA) up

and take them to trenton, or somewhere in North

New Jersey today for the lecture in connection

with the MEL MADDEN dug progran.

JOHN

GRADY mentioned that this was the first

time they tried to hit a drait board from the

outside and that it was the firsi time they had

triod to got community involvement. GRADY related

to him that in the past they have

gone

into &

community where there was some indication that

there were sympathizers in the area.

The sympathizers

would then set up observations for three to four

weeks. GRADY and his assistants would come into

the area and spend another week doing detail work.

The "old

actors" would then come in and spend two

or three days assembling, conducting dry-runs and

getting the general feel of the area.

After this,

the hit

would be made and they would

then disperse,

leaving three or four local people bohira.

With regard to KIRK,

the locksmith in Philadelphia,

HARDY has learned that he, KIRK, is undor 30 years

of age.

He has also learned that Father MICHAEL

DOXLE has, through KIRK's instructions, become

very proficient in lock picking.

(HARDY's report

to the FBI of his meeting wiüh GRADY's group on

• July 8, 1971).

Page 74e paragraph }

HARDY explained the procedure by which the group

gains entry to the roof of the townbouse Apartnonüs.

They use a credit card, which has been cut in half

lengthwise, and slip it behind the bolt or tumbler

to the door which loads into the lobby of the

Townhouse Apartments.

They then apply pressure

to the left with the credit card, while pulling

out the handle of the door with their free hand.

This causes the door to oyen. Alter doing this,

they walk through the lobby

and take the elevator

to the 5th floor. Upon leaving the elevator, most

of the people in the group take of their shoes.

They then take the stairwell up to the 6th i1o0r

onto the roof. It has been agreed upon within the

group that the first person to arrive on the roof

on any particular night will prop the door open by

means of a bar. (HARDY's report to the FBI of his

meeting with GRADY's group on July 8, 1971).

Page 80, paragraph 1 .

COOKIE and ANITA mentioned a small, thin man from

Philadelphia, who has the background and makeup

to go into the draft board. They did not mention

him by name but did mention that he had gone into

draft boards in the past.

(HARDY's report to the FBI

of his meeting with GRADY's group on July 9, 1971).

Page 83, paragraphs 1 and 2

It was also mentioned that a girl named ANN (last

From what GRADY said on Friday night,

it ap vared as if there was a draft board hit

planned for the

Trenton area that never came

off as yet. It was mentioned by the group that

thoy had already done the preparations for a

hit In trenton, bui for some reason the hit

was not made.

They have talked of going back

to trenton after the Camden hit to make the hit

at Trenton, which had previously been worked out.

Fron the conversations, it was HARDY's under-

standing there were possibly two draft boards

boing surveilled in

the Trenton area but only

one of them was hit. It was mentioned

that

COOKIE and ANITA should go back to trenton for

th. second hit.

(HARDY's roport-to the FBI of his

meeting with GRADY's group on JuLy 10, 19(1

Page 86, Paragraph 4

HARDY advised in the course of the conversation,

MEL MADDEN stated be would provide a van and

some people and would try to get some money from

the Defense Committee.

MADDEN brought up that

there is always the possibility of one of the

group "participating in the action" could

possibly be picked up and that bail money would

be necessary.

At this time, TERRY interrupted

and

said that someone by the name of YEAGER would

be a financial touch for this thing.

YEAGER

is a member of the Scranton Defense Committee.

From the gist of the conversation, HARDY assumed

there are several Defense Committees. (HARDY'S

report to the FBI of his neeting with GRADY'S

group on July 11,. 1971).

The plan is to attach an

experienced person to one of the newconors

and familiarize the newcomer with the area

in and around the Camden Post Office,

and

will be assigned

to that person for the

evening of the hit.

The consensus of opinion

is that 18 people will be needed to

the action successfully.

HARDY advised that POPPI SHARPE had been contacted,

apparently by Grady, during the past week and

that he has committed eight people for the

exterior defense on the night of the action.

SHARPE's peoplo are to croato some kind oi a

problem if its needed.

HARDY explained this would

be some sort of diversionary tactic to call

attention away from the post office.

Nothing

more was said about he napalming of the irmy

tank in front of the Reserve Conter in Candon,

tioned by members of the group that they did

not want anyone outside of those in attendance

on that night to know any further details re-

garding the hit.

When MEL MADDEN questioned

GRADY with regard to the definite time and

date of the hit, GRADY replied that the hit

would take place within the next ten to four

teen days.

GRADY also mentioned that it the

hit was not made within the next fourteen days,

then it vould have to lic cancelled. ANITA

mentioned that a prime consideration within

the underground movement is that individuals

must be patient, especially with regard to the

"casing"

of a draft board.

MADDEN stated that after the draft board hit

was completed, the group

should sit down and

discuss what further activities would be under-

taken by this particular segment of the East

Coast Conspiracy grouD.

MADDIN indicated to

the group that he felt that the time fon draft

board hits was over.

From what MADDEN said, it

was his, HARDY's, impression that the drait

board

• "Did not come

off" or that it was unsuccessful.

A slide projector was then brought forth and

slides were shown.

These slides were slides of

the Post Office which MIKE GIOCOlDO had taken.

The nenbers of the group then discussed the

different ways by which they could gain access

to the draft board window.

While this was being

done, COOKIE and ANIlA were setting up the chart

which dealt with the commitments

for the surveil

lance for that night. A new surveillance point

is now being used by the group.

It was mentioned that if the group is able

to determine a stable pattern,

that they

possibly will be able to get sin 'or sevon

on two of then could "take a shotl at the

Army Intelligence Office or even the FBI

Office.

The group is now considering a Saturday

night as well

as sunday night as the possible

night for the hit. The reason for this is

that from their surveillance, they have found

that the various patterns on Saturdays would

possibly be more conducive for a successful

hit than those on Sundays.

It was mentioned

that DIXON's apartment would be used as sleeping

quarters for sone of the "old actors" who would

be coming in for the hit. Dr. ANDERSON's flat

on Broadway and Royden, above his office, and

MIKE GIOÇONDO's apartment. would also be used

as sleeping. quarters for those "old actors"

who would be coming in for the hit.

Those members

of the group who conduct

surveillances

fron the Rutgers Law School

are ale to gain entry through the door on

the 5th Street side.

This is a door with

a plywood panel which is wired. They have

snappedthe wires and re-wranped them with

their fingers, making it possible with very

little effort for them to lift the panel and

thereby sain entry. Surveillances from the Law

School are conducted either from the fifth

from the law school,

that she could see his, HARDY's, van, which

was

located in the alley behind

Last night the group started dry runs with

The pro

cedure is for the person who is on foot at

determination as to whether or not Market Street

is clear of police patrol cars.

At the same time those on the

A third point which the

group will have to

insure is clear is Fourth

Street.

They will have someone located at

Fourth

who will be able to give a signal.

The radio

transmissions should not take more than five

seconds.

Once the signal is "go" the man or

woman on the roof (who is in charge of communi

for the team to come out of the van.

The group

feels that they would need a full minute of

protection in order

to insure safe passage from

the alleyway to the roof of the Post Office

building.

Plans call for a sufficient number

of cars to be on the street in order to block

the intersections at Fifth and Market Street,

Fourth and Cooper Streets,

The individuals who are in

Hardy would dresent the present plans for the

Camden

"Draft Board action" as told to hin

on July 19, 1971, at Doctor ANDERSON's resi-

dence, Collingswood, N.J., by JOHN GRADY,

ANITA, and COOKIE.

The plan involves about 22

people, approxi

mately 10 automobiles, and 4 walkie-talkies

(which are referred to as "headsets" by

members of the group. The plan is initially

concentrated on three points.

The first key

point is the "number two position" on the

Townhouse Apartment roof.

There will be four

people on the roof of the Townhouse Apartments.

One will' be at the rear of the building looking

toward the alley behind the Post office building.

"number two position" is the key position

of the entire operation.

The person in the

number two position will be the individual

who gives the signal to start or

stop the

operation dedending on the situation as seen

by the lookout.

The "nunber three" and

"number

four" positions are "lookouts"

who will be on

the Townhouse Anartment roof looking

east and

west on Cooper Street.

These individuals wil

be within walking distance of the number two

position.

Plans call for JOHN GRADY to have•

the number two or key position.

A second key position is an automobile which

will be darked by the

Ben

Franklin Bridge on

Fifth Street in the vicinity of Fifth and Penn

Streets.

The individual in this

vehicle will

have a direct view of the third key position

which will be a person standing on the southwest

corner of Fifth and Market Streets, dircetly

opposite the hite Tower Restaurant.

There will be two cars on Market Street at

Fifth.

There will be two cars on Fifth Street

at Market.

When the individual located on the

street to the White Tower Restaurant

he can be seen by the man in the vehicle

who is in the

vicinity of Fifth and Penn

Streets.

The man on Fifth and Market

Streets will cross the

street to the white

Tower as so indicated when he has determined

that Market Street and Fifth Street are clear

of any police cars.

There will be two individuals in the car

located at Fifth and Penn Streets. When the

individuals in the car observe the man to

cross the street, they will say "go" over

the walkie-talkie.

This will be received

by JOHN GRADY, the "Key man" on the roof of the

Townhouse Apartments.

When GRADY hears the

word "go" as transmitted from the car at Fifth

and Penn Streets he (GRADY) will look to the

people at the number three and number four

positions.

If they indicate to him that Market

Street is clear he (GRADY) will then say "go"

into

the walkie-talkie.

These are the only

walkie-talkie transmissions which will take

place on the night of the action.

One of the individuals in the van which will be

parked in the alley behind the Post Office

building will

also have a walkie-talkie.

This

individual will be able to hear the signals of.

both the lookout at Fifth and Penn Streets and

GRADY.

When the man in the van with the walkie-

talkie hears the second "go" the back doors of

the van will oden up and those in the van will

exit from it carrying with them a nine foot

ladder.

This ladder will be viaced against

the overhanging roof on the platform behind

the Post Office.

The "hit team" will then go

on to the roof of the platform from the side.

position.

They will be entering the roof from

the Fifth Street side of the roof.

There will

be six Deodle who will be

going into the building.

These individuals will go uD the ladder and the

will turn around and pull

additional nine foot ladder which he will place

against the wall from the platforn roof to the

second floor roof. He will proceed to go up the

ladder followed by the others.

He will then either lock the

will

At this point it

would appear most likely that he

would lock

the van and walk away from it.

As the last man goes over the second floor

n0of he will

pull the ladder up behind hin

so that it will not be visible. They have

determined that they need about sixty seconds

to get the people from the van onto the roof.

While members of the "hit team" are going up

the ladder the cars, if need be, will start

moving down Market Street, down Fifth Street,

across from Fourth and Cooper Streets, across

from Fourth and Market Streets so that

they

will effectively block off all entrances so

that no one can see the van.

Two cars will be parked by the white lower

Restaurant, Fifth and Market Streets, vaiting

for the light on Market Street.

cars will

be parked

either side of the street on Fifth

Street pulling out after the man (Fifth and

Market Streets) gets halfway across the street.

In other words this gives the man at the key

position located at Fifth and Penn Streets clear

vision of the man crossing the street.

The two cars on Fifth Street will then pull out

so as to effectively cut off Fifth Street from

any Market Street approach.

The traffic Light

signal will dictate which of the two cars will

start down Market Street first.

At the same time a car will be on Fourth Street

waiting for the light at Fourth and Market Streets

This vehicle will be on the southeast corner of

that intersection. There will also be another

car between "arket Street and Markley Alley.

Another car will

be at Fourth and Cooper Strcets

on the southeast

corner of that intersection.

Another car will be at Fourth and Cooper Streets

or the northwest corner facing south.

## Page 208

If the need arises those individuals in

these cars will drive around the block in

order to give the hit team the necessary

protection in order to get into the building.

If necessary these vehicles. will block the

corners of Fourth and Cooper Streets, Markley

Alley, the corner of Fourth and Market Streets,

and-If necessary the corner of Fifth and Market

Streets. All of this will

take place within

a time span of sixty seconds.

There will also be a group of "out riders,"

that is other cars which will be in the area

at a distance further away from the Post

Urface building.

At this point there has only

been one

"out rider" that has been designated

and that is one that will be at Third and

Federal Streets facing east. It has not as

yet been determined what the function of this

individual in this car will be..

The general thought of the group with regard

to the plans would be that if something happens

after the second "go" the cars will return to

their original positions.

The group has been operating on ten-minute

intervals whit? "casing" the Post Office. During

the surveillances the group makes notations for

each ten-minute interval; for instance, fron

11:50 to 12 o'clock midnight. They are attempting

to learn of a thirty-minute time frame wherein

the traffic and police patterns would be suitable

for their gaining entry to the building.

They

then plan to take the ten minutes from the middle

of this thirty-minute frame and use this ten-

minute frame for the hit.

The driver of the van after locking the van

lafter the hit team has

entered the building)

would walk away to a predetermined position

which would most likely be the churchyard behind

the church located at Fifth and Cooper Streets.

In order for the operation to be initiated, the

conditions at the three key points have to

be

met.

That is, the man at Fifth and Market

Streets after observing

that all was clear

the car at Fifth and Penn Streets'

would have

to note this and signal the first' "go". GRADY

on the rooftop of the Townhouse Apartments then

would check out number three and number four

positions visually to see if he

had the all

clear signal from them. If he does he would

then give the second. "go. - The two

• "go"

signals should be heard within a five to ten

second interval.

If a second "go" signal is

not given the vehicles will return to their

original positions and wait another ten minutes

in order

to get everything up again.

For

instance, if it is originally planned to

initiate the action at 11:50 but the second

"go" signal is not received, everyone will

return to their original positions and wait

until 12 o'clock. midnight.. At 12 o'clock

midnight then the man on Fifth and Market

Streets would make his determination as to

whether the area is clear or not clear and he

would again stey off and cross the street and

The critical man is the man at the corner of

Fifth and Market Streets.

If he does not step

off from the corner nothing is initiated:

Other than GRADY, it has not been firmly set

up as to what individuals will be in what

position.

He believes, however, that COOKIE

and ANITA will be part of the team that goes

up on the roof.

The procedure for coming out of the building

will be the same as the procedure followed when

going into the building.

The cars will line. up

in their original positions and the "go" signal

will have to be given so that the man on the

roof on the man in the van has some way of knowin

that all is clear. The

cars will again block

the intersection. It is anticinated that since

the hit team will be carrying bags or back packs

with possibly forty to fifty pounds of files that

it will take longer for them to exit than it did

for them to enter.

At this point it is anticipatc

that the hit team will use back packs since this

an incident in filmington,

outside the draft board waiting for the "inside

team" to drill a hold in the door or to drill

the lock out of the door in order to gain exit

through the front door. When they were not

able to do this the idea was passed between

GRADY and those on the inside by walkie-talkie

that they should go around the rear exit of

the building.

GRADY mentioned that he listened

over the walkie-talkie as they went through

the building and that: he heard a loud. sound.

that sounded much like a

shot. On hearing this

GRADY assumed that the "inside team" had kicked

the glass out of

go to the rear of the building in

In their haste to do

this SCOBLICK broke off the antenna without

foot walls. He explained that they want the

open-bed truck because they want to be able

to just flip the ladders onto the roof and

in that way the entrance team will not have

to get out of the truck to get up the ladders.

he was there yesterday during the light hours

seemed to

think that the alarm was a fire-type

Agenoy of che FBI and advised as follows:

He was coming to the

by something that a good friend of his (MIKE GIOCONDO) wes

trying to get him involved in.

GIOCONDO had

approached hin

concerning a

"draft board demonstration like the one the

BERRIGANs were involved in."

GIOCONDO wanted his assistance in finding places

for large groups of people to stay overnight, in finding

meeting hall, and the use of his truch.

assuned that

the truck would be used to move groups of people.

His touck

could transport up to 20 people at one

tioned that there are about 25 people in the area who are

working on the matter and that there are

about 200 more who

wiIl be

coming to the area fron New York State and Pennsylvanis

to provide assistance.

The plannina has been going on for

about six to eight weeks, and GIOCONDO has told him that many

of the "ex-religious" people involved in the movement are

people who have been known to both GIOCONdo and him for quite

some time. GIOCONDO did not identify these people by nano

at that time to him.

GIOCONDO has mentioned that the target site has

been photographed and has been under extended surveillance by.

members of the group. The group meets nightly.

GIOCONDO has mentioned that on Wednesday night he

HARDY advised that ATPOINETTE does all the

actually runs

the operation.

COKTE, HARDY obseryed,

is

a supplement to the team.

HARDY made the observation

that

MIKE GIOCONDO is a more or less overpowered by GRADY's

personality

haldy feels that this is due to GRADY's

magnetism and that it is of an intense quality so as to

overcome the average person who is not ready to cope with

it.

HARDY edvised that the two girls are fcom Phila

delphia and that

they went to a Catholic high school. They

are

very good friends with a nur (notlmown) who is now

invoivad in this underground thine. GRIDY, he related,

GEADy further related that this thing wes just too big for

the enthorities and that could not catch up with all of the

little people involved. HARDY made the observation that

CRADY appears very sincere in what he is doing.

HARDY again questioned. GRADY as to whether he would

need slueping querters and places where meetings could be

held for people conine into the Cauden ares.

by stating that he was not totally sure about it and that

would confide

in HARDy at a later date.

CLOCONDO g

esports to trenton every day.

HARDY then related that the 200 people figure

that was mentionea was perhaps a little bit misleading in

that this is a political ploy.

He explained that CRADY was

trying to present a picture of greater strength than he

actually has.

This is something that is developed from

the votes.

ROBERT WILLIAN HARDY, 65 South 29ch Street, Cander,

N.do, was

interviered and advised as follows:

of Doctor ANDERSON, Harding Avenue and Coopex Drive, Collings

GRADY, COOKIE and ANTOINeTTe, who is also know as ANITA.

He questioned them as to how they were obtaining the food which

they had avery night.

They eat at approvinately 9:00 p.s. every

evening, having a community meal. Apparently until last week

when they were under sunveillance by the FBi, fifteen or twenty

prople vers meting every night for the community meal. He learned

fom COOKiE and ANITA that they go out and steal food

from & local

supermarket so that they do not have to spend money for the food

They also told him that they go to local liquor fairs and steal

the whiskey and wine which they have with their meals.

Their group at the meeting, was very well pleased with

the f100r plan that he was able to produce for the Selective

Service office.

The group plans that when they make the hit,

they will go up the outside fire escape and through the window inco

the Drift Board office, thereby eliminating the need for keys on

the need for anyone hiding wichin

the bullding.

The group desires

chac HARDY

go back to the Selective Service office and attcup.

to deternine where the files are kept for those

registrants who

are classified i-A,

The group has indicated. that when hitting the

Draft Board they will be concerned only with the l-A classification

files. At this time they are unsure as to whether or not they

will carry the files from the office or whether they will destroy

them on the spot.

The group's second target, if possibie, is

to hit the Arny Intelligence Office located on the fourch

floor

of the U.S. Post Office Building.

They are interested in taking

files such

as the files that were taken from the FBI Office in

Media, Pa.

It was HARDY's

impression fron discussions with the

group

that the theft of the fBi files in ledia, was looked upon as

a great act at couruge by. the "underground"

, and that other groups

are now trying to duplicate their efforts and release

the files as

the Media files have been released.

Most of those involved are either ca-religious people cr

priests or nuns or welfare workers.

HARDY

was able to see on' the list the nanc SILLMAN.

He was unsure as to whether this nanc

represchted

i man or 3

woman and he had never heard the name belore,

Another name on the list was WEBER. He believes

that this name represents BOB WEBER, who is the Ronan Catholic

Chaplin at Rutgers University, Canden, N.J.

Canden last Spring.

Another name on the list was

that of JOE MADEN (phonetic)

who is a priest at Saints Peter

better known as El Centro, HARDY balieves that MADEN was questioned

by the

FBI about two months ago with regard to the surveillance

of the FBI Headquarters at the Post Office Building, Camden, N.J.

This questioning "shook up" MADEN to the point

where he dropped

out of anything connected with the Draft Board hit.

Another person known by HARDY to be involved is a

girl named NORMA, whose last name he was unable to recall at that

time.. NORMA is the editor for a suburban newspaper within the

eacht at thei

Cherry Hill, N.J. Area.

She lives in Canden, N.J. He

said she

HARDY

described NORMA as being about 28 years old,

with a

thin build.

She has recently had all of her top teeth

removed.

She is not a very attractive girl. She is about 115

pounss in weight, about 5'6" with short

"scraggly" lair. She

often dresses in

"hippie-type" outfits.

During the meeting, nost of the conversation centered

around the knowledge that HARDY was

able to obtain while at the

doors on the alley

see if he could gain entrance to any of these rooms.

He was

unable to gain entry to any of chese rooms.

At this point in the

discussion at the meeting, GRADY said that when

they made the

Draft Board hits in Philadelphia,

one of the hits was on South

Broad Street.

In referring to this hit, GRADY mentioned to the

group that there was an alarm system on

the door at this draft

board and that because of this they proceeded to take an electric

saber saw, with which they cut the door in half,

theraly going

through the bottom half of the door and not setting off the alarm.

obtain a ten foot ladder so

that they could use a boarded up building on the Fifth Screat

that one of the windows on the second floor of this bandoned

They feel that if they had a

ladder that they could gain entry to this building and sur

veill the post office from there, thereby being able to lean

specifics of the guard's routine. HARDY agreed to so

obtain a ladder.

HARDY observed that the group appaared to be very

thonough and was willing to wait as long as nood be to get all

the necessary inforation, before actually going through with

the plan.

he questioned the group as to whether or not they

were concerned about the possibilities of an informant due to

the size of the group.

They commented that they felt that

there was. an informer within

the group, due to the fact that

the FBI surveilled them in Hi-Nella,

N.J. last week.

Hower

rather than liniting the size of their group because of the

fear for an informer, they desire to expand the group so that

it would include more community leaders.

They had also requested he determine if there was a

telephone on the fourth floor of the Post Office and if so

what the number of the telephone was. He related to them that

he had learned that there was not a public telephone on the

fourth floor, nor was there ore on the fifth floor.

HARDY was given instructions by the members of the

group to see if he could obtain three walkie-talkies, as they

desire to have one walkie-talkie in operation inside

the Draft

Board office, one on the roof top of the Town House Apartments,

and one with

the people on the street, so that they would at

all times be ready to run and avoid detection.

JOHN GRADY mentioned that he was the one who helped

engineer the four hits on Draft Boards in Piladelphia, Pa.

GRADY mentioned that there would be outside help coming to

Condon to assist in the hit.

He did not mention any banes

of these people, however.

GRADY did say that the people would

He was instructed to be

check the civilian cars, bleck and white patrol cors, and

unmarked police cars that are parked in the city lot.

He

in view of the fact that he did not now

how many were broken down and inoperable.

walked down the alley,

cut to the left into a little alley

which is located behind the Brass Rail Restauzant,

which is

next to the Post Office building.

They paused for a llutte

while in this alley and observed

the fire escape which is

attached to the

Post Office building.

CRADY discussed with

him how his group was going to bypass the alaim syston on

the fire escape,

GRADY related to HARDY that he was there

yesterday during the light

hours and that he noticed that

a wire runs along the vall to the fire escape.

Grabi, at

chis time, seemed to think that the alarm was a fire type

•arm and

not a burglar alarm, assuming that when it is

pulled down, the alarm will go ofi.

HARDY and GRADY then left the alley behind the

Brass Rail Restaurant and proceeded back torards the alley

behind the Post Office where there is another little alley

which goes behind an abandoned building that is closed up.

This building is located on 5th Street.

explained that this is the spot that GRADY and

his group will droy a 12-loot or 14-foot ladder a couple

days before the hit in case

they have to work their way

around using the fire escape.

He explainea the original

intention was to broce the

fire escave steps. They. then

intend to put a ladder against it and the huilding so that

they can

just walk across it rather than pull the fire

escape down and seu oil the earn.

HARDY advised that a little later it was suggested

by someone

whom he does not recall that the

bastetball in the churchyned across the street unabla

throw a

basketball on the roof

They

then intend to go inside the

building and ask the guard if he could somehow get up on

the root so that they con retrieve their basketball.

HARDE stoted the reasoning behind this plan is that the

guard will have to turn off the alarm before

the fire escape

steps can be pulica down.

It was therefore accided thei this

coming Sunday night there with be a basketbat. game at about

8 o'clock.

The participants will be GENE DIXON, JOHN CRADI,

HARDY further relaced that after checking out the

alleys. he and chabi went back to the station wagon, crossed

the driveway behind the Post Office, drove through the

basketball courts behind the Methodist church on cooper

and then proceeded around to check out where GRADY

wants his security cars nuried so that they can watch cooper

Street and 5th Street for the approach of police patrols.

HARDY advised that there will probably be someone

in a car sitting on 5th and Cooper Streets on the norch

side of Cooper facing down 5th,

He explained that th this

way the person can watch Cooper Street both ways and 10ol

straight down 5th. GRADY is also thinking about putting

HARDY Chen related that he and GRADY then went up

to the root oi che townhouse Apartments.

le explained that

there is a lock on the door but that it can be opened with

nothing more than a plastic chargeplate or credit card.

By using the card it simply pops the lock.

HARDy noted that

security is very poor in the apartment building.

He and

GRADY then took the elevator to the 5th floor and stated

that one cannot ride the elevator to the oüh floor. In order

get to the roof, one must get off at the 5th floor and

then walk upstairs

to the rool.

HARDY then advised. that a person he previously

mentioned by the neme of KEN

was at one time a resident of

the Townhouse hpartments.

Kel, at one time, was approached

by MIKE GIOCONDO to use his epartment on the 5th floor. KON

apparently let GRADY and his group use his apartment on one

occasion; but, later when asked to

At approximately 1:10 a.M., MICHAEL DOXLL Came Up

At this point GRADY took HARDY around to the Cooper

Street side of the elevator shaft and started to explain

the pattern that this night watchmon follows in order to

familiarize HARDY with the whole situation.

In passing the time away, HARDY and GRADY spend

about a half hour of heavy conversation regarding GRADY'S

activities over the past couple of years.

GRADY advised

that he was involved in the Chicago draft board thing.

He was involved in. the New York draft board action of

approximately a few years ago. GRADY stated that one of

the New York actions was successful and that the other one

was not. GRADY stated that he went from New York City to

that the

He

impiled thut it was very simple.

GRADY did not mention eny

nomes involved in the Hedia IBI office burglary.

HARDY made the observation that because GRADY

seemed to have so much detailed Inowledre of the Neäia

burglary,

he thought GRaDy was involved in the liedia action.

GRADY went on in his conversation to take crodit for organirina

these draft board hits which have occurred in the last three

years.

GRADY stated that he took the last Coast Conspiracy

to save Lives and turned it from the jali sentence martyr

action into a positive strike fosce.

HARDY made the observation.from talking with GRADY

that the East Coast Conspiracy to Save

• Lives is not a very

tight group but is loosely organized and that the members

of the group feel a very close loyalty to each other.

GRADY mentioned the BERRIGAN brothers and said

something about some letters that PulL BERRIGAN had written

a nun who supposedly is very close to this group.

said something about the letters being relecsed and

that

the letters were really not very important, stating that

they were very mild.

GrADY implied that the effect: of

the letters was a big hot sensational thing, the kind of

thing that appears in the dirty writings such as found in

The National Enquirer.

GRADY characterized this as the big

observed that from the way GRADY talked he has been

GRADY then changed the tople of conversation to

GRADY seemed porticularly interested in Inoring

HARDY stated that he then tried to question CRADY

as to his thinking about wo is slated to go into the draft

HARDY connonted that it used to be

thought that the

Indians are expendable but that the

chiefs have to be saved.

GRady ansuored this by saying that he does not buy that

cheory, but hardt imediately got the impression. that when

the ecuad breakin decurs,

CRADY will be far from the Post

ofrice in a vantage point were he can succossfully get away.

GRADY then acked HARDY what his foelings were on going into

che orart boara himselt

to wnich HARDY replied that he told

GRADY to drop dead, that he was not en Indian but a chiet.

GRADY answered by saying, "I understand what you're saying".

HARDY advised that one of their main problems that

he has been able to ascertain from the grouy is that they

do not know of the exact location of the lA classification

files and how many files there are. The present plan is to

carcy out all the let files they can and, through some sort

OI SymbOLIC geSture,

destroy the remaining files. HARDY

advised that from all indications the hit

will occur on a

Sunday night and that it is several weeks away. He stated

chat it will most likely occur between the hours of 12 midnight•

and approximately 4 a.M.

HARDi then explained that the pay telephone that

he previously reported as being used by GRADY's Eroup

ANDERSON's neighborhood sits on the corner of Harding Avenue

between Harding and Gilfoil Avenues.

At this point HARDY commented on ANTOINETIE. He

advised that ANTOINDIIE is also cajled "ANTI"" and that

both ANTOINEITE and COOKIE ere from South Philadelphia.

He related an incident wich occurred last night, at vhich

time he asked ANTOINETTE for a glass of cold water.

She was

at that time in the kitchen doing dishes. He jokingly said

that this was great because he is lost in the kitchen and

that his wife usually does everything for him. ANCOINETTE

where they wore staying up until a month ago:

While conversing with GIOCONDO, JORN GRADY, COOKIE,

and ANTOINEITE, also known as inite, returned fron shopping.

As they were unloading the groceries he asked CooKIs if they

were concerned about the possibility of getting caught doing

their shoplifting.

COOKIE told him that she. and ANIOINBVIE

had gotten caught the other day but there were no problems

since they do not prosecute shoplifters any more. : COOKIE

their way out of the situation:

Shortly thereafter Father MICHAEL DOYLE Came to

in Philadelphia doing observation work and were asked if

they would consider Camden

Shortly thereafter

they went to Camden and did some observation work for a faw

days and decided that it would be an easy hit. He explained

that it was his impression that this is how the group first

became acquainted with JOHN GRADY..

It was around that time

that GRADY came into the Camden area and was put into touch

with MIKE GIOCONDO and MEL MADDEN, who is the brother of

Father JOE MADDEN, who is a parish priest at Saint Peter

and Paul's Church

also call for a person to be located on the roof of the

Parkade Building, observing the traffic and police pat

terns in the vicinity of City Mall and along Market Street.

At this point it is not determined as to how many people

GRADY mentioned that his family would be coming

in on that day by car and that they would got off at

Exit Four on the New Jersey Tumpike and at that point

run a pattern to see if Mrs. GRADY had been followed from

the Bronx-

A car driven by GIOCONDO or DIXON will be

watching Mrs. GRADY to see if she has been followed.

GRADY said that he had a good friend in Rochester,

GRADY's wife has a couple of phony credit cards that she

uses in making these telephone calls.

The group is beginning

to feel more secure, however, and they have started calling

in on the doctor's phone.

It was

HARDY's impression that MICHAEL DOYLE,

JOHN GRADY and most of the people in the group have been

involved in similar activities throughout

the state.

In referring to slides HARDY mentioned that

GIOCONDO has not been able to locate these slides as yet

but that MARTHA SHIMLEY and GENE DIXON have them somewhere

and that they will soon bring them to Doctor ANDERSON's

GRADE desires that about five poople go into the draft

board and that each will have a shoulder type tote bag

which they could use to carry out files.

Pians call for HARDY to drive his van truck up

to drill. through the glass windows of the draft board.

The group left the residence of Dr. ANDERSoN at

COOKIE wherein she had written that on July 2nd three

white males were observed in a green car which passed Dr.

ANDERSON's residence

and that the car bore Pennsylvania

license with the first three numbers being "926". At this

point HARDY pointed out that he has learned that COOKIE

sits on the front porch of DE. ANDERSON's residence during

the day and jots down license numbers of any cars which pass

by and appear suspicious to her.

• The surveillances which they conducted in the area

of the Camden Post Office were terminated at approximately

Father MICHAEL DOYLE to be on the street as lookouts and

for HARDY to be in his truck as a lookout.

While on the roof of the Townhouse Apartments

conducting his surveillances with ANTOINEITE, she related

to him that she had gotten involved in this sort of thing

through a friend of hers who was involved in it. She

mentioned that she and her friend (whom she did not identify)

had done observation work in connection with prior hits.

ANTOINETTE montioned that this friend of hers was involved

In the East Coast Conspiracy to Save Lives.

She rantioned

that she first became involved becuse of her friendship with

this person; but, after three or four months of involvement,

she began feeling a need to go further.

She mentioned that

it necessary she would go to jail for this cause,

surveillances, which are conducted fron the rooftop, are

conducted every night until 3:00 a.n. and the purpose of

these surveillances is to determine the patterns of vehicles

and the positions of people.

They make note of the routine

of the guard at the Post Office Building and also of the

police patrol cars.

group sat down with a map and started initiating a detailed

plan as to the various positions, the lookouts,

the number

of wakie-talkies, and the number of vehicles, etc.

GENE DIXON and MARTHA SHEMLEY were in the alley

behind the Post Office Building, behind the boarded-up

apartment house (located on 5th

The plans called for Father MICHAEL DOYLE, COOKIE

and JOHN GRADY to be on the roof of the Townhouse Apartments.

GRADY will run the communications of the operation from that

point.

GRADY's wife and five children are now staying

with him at the residence of Dr. ANDErSON, CoLlingswood, Nee.

GRADY's son is about 10 years of age and is named JOHN.

He has three younger girls, ages approximately o, 6 and 5 years.

GRADY mentioned that plans callefor the possibiiity

Of POPPI SHARPE, leader of the Black Peoples Unity hovement,

to have one of his blacks throw a firebomb at the tank

located in front of the Army Reserve Center, Camden, N.J.

This would, according to GRADY,

serve as a good diversionary

tactic drawing police departnent and fire department units

away from downtown Camden and to the area of the Army Reserve

Center.

The group has expressed concern as to how the FBI

located them in H1-Nella.

They feel, however, that KEN MISNER,

is probably the person who tipped off the authorities as to

the meetings in Hi-Nella.

GRADY had mentioned that Dr.. MC VEY from Rochester,

is a supplier of money and a contact for the Rochester,

related that the third objective is to get

down into the mail room

box for the fire escate

and

see if there is an alarm panel

and

to see if it is clearly markod.

HARDY

made the observation that there is the posstbility

that someone from GRADY's group could get down into the

mall. roon and turn off the elarn.

HARDY advised that he then left with MIlE GICCONDO

to go to the roof of the Town House Apartments. lie explained

that GICCONDO was sunposed to take photogranhs fron aton the

Town House Apartments in order to get shots of various angles

explained that GIOCONDO is very

adant at using a camera and that he had previously taken shots

of the Camden Post Office from atop the new Rutger's law school

bullding. HARDY went on to say that prior to arriving at

house Apartments, he stomped off with MIXE GIOCONDO

at

Shorty's Newsstand on Collings Road and it. Enhraim evenme

in Canden toolck up some film for GICCONDO's camera.

They

then proceeded to the Town House Apartments.

GJOCONDS WaS

supposed to take his photogranhs at about 5:30 in the

morning.

HARDY advised that while he was on the roof of

the Town House Apartments, ANTOINETTE was subposed to be on

the northwest corner of Market and 4th Straets observing

the traffic patterns.

Her exact location was in front of the

little camera shop below 4th on Market.

HARDY

advised that when he arrived at the Town

House Avartments, GRADY and COCKIE were already there and he

noted that GRADY

and COOLIE were having an argument, GRADY

doing all the arguing and COOKIE doing all the listening.

He noted that she was

crying a bit and GIOCONDO went to more

or less interfere.

At this time GRADY told GICCOND? that

it was not his nroblem and that she could handle her own

problems.

not to interfere.

HARDY related that while he was with GIOCONDO

en route to the Town House Apartments, he had Learned from

GIOCONDO that GIOCONDO had met two of GRADY's peonle from

the Philadelnhia group, but that he only met them by their

first names.

HARDY learned that these twi people are an

white glils about 22 years old and that

they work: at the

bool-store in the vicinity of tennle University.

He expleined

that the reason the Philadelphia group has not been brooght

into this action is that they are more radical than GRADY ana

and that they mlay

around with the drug

that

GRADY has a low. oninion of them.

HARDY

explained that another tonic of conversa

tion with MIKE GIOCONDO was the Last Coast Conspiracy to

Save Lives:

He advised that he pressed GIOCONDO for more

information about this group and the 200 peonle that were

mentioned earlier. GICCONDO answered the question by

stating that he had pressed CRADY in the early stages of

thing but that GRADY had always pushed it aside and

pushed CIOCONDO very hard to recruit neocle for this particu-

lar action. HARDY

advised that at the meeting GRADY had

stated to him that he was involved in the Dow Chemical

action in Kichigan.

GRADY did not say what the names were

those involved but stated that it was a sinple operation.

GRADY stated that the physical plant consisted of

six or

seven buildings and that the entrances were covered

by closedcircuit tV.

GRADI stated that it was guared by just

one old man who was a watchman and that he had learned that

the closed circuit TV cameras were ineffective within 100

feet of the buildings.

GRADY then stated

that it was a

simple matter of conducting their surveillances in broad

daylight next to the buildings. He noted that they just

walked around like they owned the place. GRADY then related

that there were only two men actually involved in eresing

the computer tapes.

GRADY implied that he had inside in-

formation from one of the engineers or scientists who worked

at Dow Chemical because GRADY gave the impression that the

people that actually went in to erase the tapes knew exactly

where the tames were and what the content was on the tares..

HARDY advised that another toric of conversation

with GRADY was that the Philadelnhia group is summorted by

Quakers.

GRAdY did not say specifically which Quaker groun

it was

but that the Philadelphia neople were sunported by

Quakers.

HARDY further advised that GRADY related the

circunstancos of the Bridgeton, Hl.J., draft board action

which never really got off the ground. GRADY told HARDY

that he came into

the thing in the last day or two and that

he didn't like it at all.

GRADY apparently had a personality

bust with a person naned KELLY and GRADY walked away from it.

Consequently, the action fell arart ana GRADY never took it

seriously. HARDY made the observation that CoIl uns very

unset and disaprointed with the Bridgeton action.

met GENE DIXON at the White Tower Kestawant Locaged

5th and Market streets, Cancen,

He and Dixoil then

proceeded to the Camden Post Office where

they signed in

DIXON also used his correct name since he introduced DIXON

by his correct name to various people whom they met in the

building on that day. After signing in they went to the

office.of

the dratc board for the purpose o1 maline rurches

surveillances of the floor plan filing cabinets, whooks;

alarn system, ete.

They spent approximately 15 to 20

minutes in the draft board office.

They entered there

under the pretext of talking about the "ex-convict program"

which HARDY is working on:

He asked questions of the draft

board personnel dealing with the procedure for ex-convicts

prisoner ing with the draft board upon their release from

In order

to gain some extra time while in the

draft board office,

HARDY asked for a key to the men's room

which was supplied to him. He then left the office going

to the men's room, leaving GENE DIXON in the draft board

office. He spent about five minutes in the mon's room

checking the lock system, the physical makeup of the windows,

and noting what could be seen from the men's room window.

When he came back into the hallway, he noted that the

General Services Administration (GSA) guard was getting

ready to make his rounds. He stopped the guard, who remembered

him from his visit of the week before, and talked with the

guard for about five minutes. He obtained quite a bit of

information from the guard during this talk concerning the

physical makeup of the building, the rounds which are made

by the guards,

etc. He then waiked with the guard to the

Once inside the draft board office, the guard

went to the 5th and Market Streets corner of

where there is a key

station, which is more or lero hiaden

by a cabinet.

This key station is one of the stations

which the guard is required to check while moking

his rounds.

While inside the draft board

office, he noted that some of

the handles on the windows are broken, marine it impossible

to lock these windows. He later related this information

members

of the group.

The croup was very elated by this

information.

After leaving the draft boaid offica, he and Dixor

went down to the 3rd floor in the arca of the U.s. httorney!s

Oftice.

There they checked the physical layout of the floor

in relation to the fire escape outside the windows.

They

then stopped in the courtroon and lonked out the windows to

see the makeup of the east wing of the Post Office building.

They also checked the telephone number of the public telephone

located in the hallway.

They then went down to the first

floor and talked to the ts guara about the sign-in system

and now ertective this sign-in system was.

The guard mentioned

to him that very often people walk out without signing out.

The guard said that at about Il poll. they lock the doors to

the Post Office and at that time check over their list to

see who has not signed.out and that if they recognize the

name, they generally just ligure that the people had lorgotten

co sign out.: The guard mentioned that they might make a

light

check of the building at this time to insure that no one has

stayed in the building.

It was HARDY'S impression fron

talking to the guard that'this would not be a very thorough

check of the building.

HARDY and DIXON then went into the personnel office

of the Post Office and spoke with the personnel manager

concerning the possibility of ex-convicts being hired by

the Post Office. The personnel manager was very helpful,

taking them on a tour of the mail room and pointing out the

security system and how postal. personnel would be able to

keep an eye on any ex-convicts who might be hired.

The

personnel manager took DIXON and hin out onto the platform

arrived there. Upon the girls' arrival on the roof. DIXOn•

came down from the roof and picked up MARTHA SHEMLEY at the

White Iower and then took her home to fidella.

HARDY mentioned that GRADY had decided that one

of the things that he would like to have checked would be

to see whether or not the employees of the Post Office

actually sign out when they leave the

Post Office for

the

day. GRADY had mentioned to him that it might be possible

for several

people to go into the Post Office together during

the day and for all. of them, except one, to hide in the Post

Office while one of the group would leave and sign the entire

the meeting last night of the "old actors". It was JOHN

GRADY who mentioned the BACONs and their involvement.

HARDY has learned that the roof at Rutgers is no longer.

available to the

group because it is completely under lock

and key.

He has also learned that the group has discontinued

using the roof of the Parcal Bullding for surveillance

because they have found it to be an ineffective surveillance

point. They have noted that only the front of the Post Office

can be seen from the roof of the Parcal Building, and they

have also noted that once a person is on the roof at night,

he cannot get down from the roof until 8:00 a.m. when the

Parcai garage opens.

GRADY related to him that he had been involved in

many drait board break-ins

and because of this he felt

that he would get sentenced to 20 years in jail if he were

ever caught.

The target date is still set for a week from Sunday.

It will take place on a sunday night after midnight.

Members

of the group have noted e minor problem in that some Puerto

Ricans generally sit on the front step of a building on 4th

Street until about 12:30 a.m. or 1:00 ain.

From the steps

where they are sitting, they are able to look right down

HARDY mentioned that GRADY desires that he and

DIXON: go into the FBI Office in Canden under suitable pretext

so that they might learn of information relating to the alarm

and security systems of the FBI Office.

He explained that

they would use

the pretext of trying to learn from the FEI

the procedure used in investigating an ex-convict who applies

job with the

MARTHA SHEMLEY and GENE

also mentioned the prospects of going into the FBI

Office.

As the plans stand now, the draft board is target fl.

Army Intelligence is possibly a second target and, if it is

feasible, the FBI Office would be the third

target.

From conversations with the group, HARDY has

learned that COOKIE, ANITA and JOHN GRADY have been in other

draft boards before when records were destroyed.

He mentioned

that GRADY related to him that he was involved in draft board

for the coming weekend so that they could make à

They intended to park this truck in the parking lot across

the street from the rear of the Post Office so they can

observe movements within the first floor receiving room

of the Post Office.

GRADY mentioned he and his wife had a taik about

this situation yesterday and

that she, hrs. GRADY, now

understands "what's going on" and that she "will not be a

hindrance" ANITA and COOKIE, in order to earn money, have

today gone someplace outside of Trenton, l. i., to rive

lectures concerning drugs. This lecture is something that

was set up by MEL MADDEN.. MEL MADDEN is well aware of what

the group 1s doing. GRADY will also be going up to give a

lecture at this same group of meetings on Tuesday and

Wednesday. Apparently, GRADY has given sevaral lactures

for MEL MADDEN in this

area and is paid for those lectures.

The lectures given by GRADY and the girls serve the purpose

of adding funds to their operation. HARDY mentioned that the

group does not really need that much money to live since they

steal most of their food, liquor, milk, bread and clothing.

GRADY has mentioned that previous hits have always

been "inside jobs", meaning, that they have been able in one

way or another get members of the group inside the target

area and hide themselves until the time of the hit This

had actually entered the target area from the outside.

GRADY mentioned, would be the first time they

GRADY feels that entering from the outside increases the

, element of risk but that if it could be "pulled off"

, it

would be a morale boost for the East Coast Conspiracy FrOUD.

It was mentioned that ANN (last name unknown) from

Philadelphia is picking up COOKIE and ANITA this morning to

take them to North Jersey where they will deliver the

lectures in connection with the drug program. It was

mentioned

that it is about a four hour drive from Canden and that

therefore, It would be an all-day affair. It was HARDY's

understanding that the group would be able, if necessary, to

obtain large sums of money through the East Orange group.

In referring to previous operations,

COOKIE, and

ANITA have taken great pride in the fact that they have

always been on the inside, picking up the draft records.

They mentioned that they were involved in the Philadelphia

hits

and the Trenton hit. COOKIE and ANITA both said they

were on the inside of the

Philadelphia draft, board

breek.jn

and that they have helped carry the records from the building

they (CoOke and ANITA) mentioned that chey carried the araft

board records around in the trunk of their car for about a

month before they actuelly destroyed them. Some of the

records mentioned were-ledger books that were used for

cross reference within the draft board system.

GRADY mentioned that he helped set up a talk by

PHIL Or DAN BERFIGAN at a Germantown (section of Philadelphia)

church last year. GRADY mentioned that one of the BERRIGANs

came to the church service on a Sunday morning. HARDY

believed that it was DAN BERRIGAN he was referring to, but

he was not certain.

GRADY mentioned that about three years

ago he was at a cocktail party with PHIL or DAN BERHIGAN.

HARDY believed that in this instance GRADY was referring

tO

PHIL BERRIGAN. At this cocktail party PHIL said to him

(GRADY) and another friend (whose name he did not mention)

that his brother DAN was going to pour blood on some araft

minded do something tie thous

GRADY mentioned later a

nurse came out and extracted blood from the arms of the men

who were going to pour the blood on the records but that the

nurse could not get enough blood out of their arms. Because

of this they went to a butcher shop and bought some duck's

blood and mixed their blood with the duck's blood.

It came

out in the newspapers that it was duck's blood that was

poured over the draft records and that there was no trace

of human blood. When they learned of this, they were very

let down due to the fact that the newspaper account made no

mention of human blood.

GRADY related this story with first-hand knowledge.

CR/DY again emphasized that he has been the key nan in 14

GRADY said that he was the one who developed the style

for the break-ins.

GRADY Said he is now developing the

style for outside break-ins.

Both GRADY and COOKTE again mentioned the idea

of someone going into the F5I

Office at Candon in order to

goin infornation with regard to the security and alarm syabems.

As the plans now stand, the draft boord is the first tarrot,

Army Intelligence is the second target,

and the FBI Office,

HARDY advised that the plans are kept in a four-inch

by 30-inch by 30-inch box, unich is generally located in

the playroom or

children's TV room.

Also kept in this box

are slides and a little cardboard filing box in which three-

inch by five-inch cards are kept.

On Wednesday afternoon while in GENE DIXON' s

apartment, after returning from the Post Office, was the

first time that COOKIE had mentioned the "old actors",

referring to those who had been involved in draft board

break-ins before.

Last night the issue came up again and

COOKIE said she had to call ANN (last name unknown) in

Philadelphia last night after midnight.

After midnight she

did go to the public phone booth in front of the Canden County

Police Office and made several phone calls. The procedure

in making the calls is for COOKiE to call one number, where

ANN will answer.

ANN will then hang up and go to another

phone booth, which has been predetermined, and COOKIE will

call her there.

They do this to insure that ANN is not

being folloved. WN and another girl, whose name was not.

mentioned, were, according to COOKIE and ANITA, to pick them

(COOKTE and ANITA) up and take them to Trenton

or somewhere

in North Jersey today for the lectures in connection with

MEL MADDEN's drug program.

JOHN GRADY mentioned that this was the first tine

they tried to hit a drait board from the outside and that.

It was the first time they had tried to fet community

involvement.

GRADY related to him that in the past

they

have cone into a community where there was some indication

that there were sympathizers in the area.

then she and. Mrs. GRADY sat on the porch, continuing treir

Nes: O'DELL left the front porch and took

Mrs. CRADY and Mrs.. O'DEub walking around the block was

"to check things out."

During the meeting, GENS DIXON was askod to rolate

excoptionally well.

COOKIS and ANITA had montioned that

while thoy were in Worth Jersey, kEL MADDEN had told them

that he would come down on sunday night at six o'clock,

possibly with one or two of his people, to sit in on a

planning session, and to possibly take a ride through camden

to get the feel of the situation.

GRADY mentioned that MADDEN's apartment in Bast

The target date was set for July 18;

1971 but it was indicated by GRADY that the date might have

to be moved

time to set his schedule. GRADY stated that keL MADDEd would

be bringing down seven people in cars, to take part in the

A new lookout position has been esteblished by

The group has established that the General Service

Administration (CSA) guard never comes into the Post Office

Having noted this; GRADY and members of the group feel that

it 1s quite

safe to sit on the steps. of the playground and

to conduct surveillances of the Post Office building from

to different positions in the church yard and then to go

to the rooftop of the Town House Apartments. He did this.

It was about 12 a.m. when they got to their positions.

JOHN GRADY's position was to be in the playground aroa by the

House Apartments at about 1 a.i. At approximately 1:10 a.M.,

HARD'Y was to come down from the rooftop and walk through the

Post office alley to note the reaction of any passersby.

As he did this, DIXON and SHENLEY were supposed to leave their

positions.

When he came down from the Cooper Street side of

the playground, GRaDy made a whistle, calling him over.

GRADY

then engaged him in conversation until about 2:30 a.m.

They

As they were taling. a car pulled into

the alley.

Members of tho gyoun were very suspicious of this

car and felt that it was possibly the authorities surveilling

then.

There were two men in the car.

At about 2:30 a.n., he, HARDY, went to his truck

and thon picked up DIXOl and saaLar, baling then to sumber's

Delaware draft board break-in.

He did not rocall her name

but did recall that it appeared in yesterday's

odition or

"The Philadelohia Inquirer."

This girl, ANN, was brought into the conversation

by GENE DIXON, who mentioned to ANITA and COoKie that

"one

of their girl friends made the papers this morning."

COOKIE

initially ignored this commont and ANIlA stated that nobody

knows where she, ANN, 19.

MARNIS O'DELL replied that she

felt sure that the girls, ANITA and 6O0K1B,

know where ANN

is. He, HARDY, overheard COOKIE and ANITA in a conversation

in which they stated that they had better talk to ANN

again.

From the conversation he overheard, it was his understanding

that neither ANITA nor COOKI3 Knew about the arrest warrant

until it was mentioned in the norning papar.

In the conversation which he overheard, CoOKIe

and ANITA montioned that they had better find a better place

for her, ANil. It was his impression from these conversations

that ANN was getting ready to leave the area.

HARDY noted that Mrs. O'DELL had driven down fron

New York in a borrowed car. This

car was doscribed by him

as an "old junker," possibly a Plymouth. Me also noted that

MARNIE O'DELL often has the use of MINE GIOCONDO's car for

Before being brought to Dr. ANDERSON's, part

of the tools were at GINE DIXON's apartment and part of the

ROBERT WILLIAM HANDY furniched the following

information:

HARDY adviced that at approxinately & p.m., on

July 11, 1071, MINS

GIOCONDO stopped at his residence, picked

hiin up and took him to Dr. WILLIAM ANDERSON's houde in Collings-

wood; N. J.

HARDY stated that prion to leaving for Dr. ANDERSON's

house

he talked with MIKE GIOCONDO for approximately one-half

hour.

The topic of conversation was the forthcoting action at

the Canden Draft Board.

GIOCONDO then advised HARDi, which was

a revelacion to him,

that GIOCONDO, after leaving the hospital

with a previous heart condition, started to see. a psychiatrist

"on a regular basis.

GIOCONDO stated to HARDI

that again he was

not at all sure that he should be in this "thing," bụt thạt

he is now in it and will continue through.

HARDY advised when he arrived at Dr. ANDERSON'S

house there were two new people present. These two new people

were MEL MADDEN,

the brother of the priest at SS. Feter and Paul,

Canden, N. J. MADDEN is the hoad of the state drug program for.

the State of New Jersey and MIKE GIOCONDO works for him. The

other individual was a white male named TERRY (last name unknown).

He described TERRY as 5'6", 160 pounds, age about 28, medium build,

with a vandyke type beard,

black bush hair--alnost afro-style.

up that there is always the possibility of one of the group

"participating in the action" could possibly be picked up and

that bail noney would be necessary.

and said that someone by the name of YEAGER would be a financial

touch for this thing. YEAGER is a member of the Scranton Defense

The conclusion was reached that YEAGER, TERRY;

and

TERRY's brothor, name unknown, and MEL MADDEN would provide

another ven, some people, and some noney for the forthconing

Canden action.

HARDY advised next Sunday night, July 18, 1971,

the group will have a dey-run so there will be trucks in the

area and people participating in this dry-run.

The plan is

attach an experienced person to one of the newconers and

familiarize the newconers with the area in and around the

Canden Post Office, which will be assigned to that person for

the evening of the

hit. The consersus of opinion is that 18

people will be needed to carry out the action successfully.

HARDY advised that POPPI SHARPE had been contacted

apparently by GRADY during the past week and that he has committed

eight people for the exterior defense on the night of the action.

SHARPa"s phille are to create

sche kind of a problem if it is

needed.

tactic to call attention away from the post office.. Nothing

more was said about the napalming of the army tank in front

of the Reserve Center in Canden, although it had been referred

to during the course of the discussion some half a dozen times.

HARDY advised another name was brought up. This

person might possibly becone involved in the action and from

GRADY's comment this person has experience and has participated

in past actions. GRADY mentioned the name BUSBUY or BUZZARD.

HARDY advised GRADY did not go into detail regarding BUSBUY.

HARDY advised next Sunday: July 19, 1971, at 6 p.m.,

MEL MADDEN and TaRRy, along with those people they will be able

to bring, will report to the ANDERSONs' home for a briefing and

will

then be paired off with sone of the people who are

already

involved in the Canden action.

The tentative "hit time" is going

to be between 11:30 p.m., and 12:30 a.m.

As yet GRADY and his

group have not set the time for sure.

HARDY: advised while

participating with the group in the surveillance last night the

group could have gone in at 11:30 p.n., and 12:30 a.m. He

explained the surveillance workings as follows:

The surveillance commenced at 11:30 p.m., with everyone

in the pre-arranged checkpoints.

Observations were made for a

NW 65994 Docld:32989694 Page 337

## Page 338

PH

52-7165 SUB S

full ten minutes and then at 11:40 p.n., observations were again

Inade as

iF 11:30 did not happen.

These

are carried out every

ton minutes until approximately 12:20 a.n.

This infornation which

1s compzled by each nomber of the surveillance is then discussed

the next evening and each person at the prescribad times states

what was seen

for example, there was a patrol car on Market

Street at 11:30 p.m., so that would knock out the 11:30 to

11:40 timc frame.

Another example given by HARDY

was that at

11:50 p.m., the watchman looked out the bathroom window.

HARDY explained these observations had been gone over

in great detail;

the general consensus for last night was that

the group could have gone in at three different times without

any problems.

HARDY made the observation that it is no wonder these

people have been very successful in their attempts to hit draft

boards. He observed that the more experienced they get the more

proficient they

become and

is not umsual since

the rolice incroose their nimbers on the streets during

the Surmer months.

At anacoximately 11 pores MARTHA SHOELEY and

GRITE DIXON went home and were not able to do observation

work. Last night.

HARDY related that at noproximately 12:00, he,

ANITA and COOKIE left

the ANDERSON house with two walkie-

talkies which had proviously heen obtained. The man for

last night was for ANITA and cockte to go to the roofton

of the. Town House Anartments and test the walkie-talkies.

HARDY noted that after testing the walkie-talries the

general concensus was that, they were satisiactory:

HARDY

related that it was further noted by the

groun that in order to successfully hit the drait board,

control of Market, Cooner and th Streets must he covered and

in'a sense controlled, He noted that the groun feels that

Il they can cover or control those streets for two minutes

that would be enough time for the group actually going into

the drift board to get un the ladder onto the ton of the

roni and into the Post eifice. it is generally felt by

the gron that the two minute control is necessary to set the

people into the building without any prohlens.

HARDY went on to explain that each night checks

are run at ten-ninute intervals.

He stated for example

that the grour would start at 11:40 p.m. and if all points

check out this is noted, then the grown will start over

again at 11:50, and then 12, 12:10, and 12:20 down to about

1•30 p.M. He advised these checks

are run in ten-minute

natterns and that dirferent things or nrocedures are tried

out as far as control and tests are concerned.

HARDY advised that GRADY's position is now in

the churchyard next to the Methodist Church, 15th and

• Cooper.

HARDY explained that GRADY, from the churchyard,.

can observe the platform of the Post office.

In regard to the Wilmington draft board action,

HARDY advised that GRADY told him that the action did not

come off as planned.

The original plan it seems was that

GRADY was a couple of blocks away. from the draft board and

was supposed to pick un the rest of the team and then proceed

to the draft board to pick up

those who went in. In the

meantime, TONY SCOBLICK had already picked up the group who

had gone

inside the draft board.

He related that the situa

tion was sort of funny in view of the fact that some of the.

participants were drinking coffee at a Dunkin' Donuts Shop

conversation. GRADY went on to relate. that some of the

people who had gone into the Shop were very up-tight about

the policeman.

HARDY advised that GRADY related this story in a

The incident that caused GRADY to "blow up" was

A new surveillance point is now being used by the group.

This point is a small parking lot on Lith Street, between

DIXON and SHiMLEY drove their car to this parking lot on

the night of July 1o, 1971, parked it there,

and from there

wore able to observe a portion of the Post Oftice mailing

platform.

During their nightly surveillance, nombers of the

group make note of license numbars of vehicles which thay

believe to bo

unmarked police cars, carrying plainsclothes

detectives.

It has been his, HARD!'s, observation during re

cent mostings, that GRADY is pushing some of the responsibility

for the action on COOKIe and ANITA.

in the night of July 18, 1971, ho, HARDy, took his

van to the area behind the Post uffice building and parked

it in the united States Attorney's (USA) parking space.

It hed been determined by the group that they would leave the

vehicle parked in the alley to see if anyone would have any

objection to having it parked there for the night. It was

docided that on reveral nights, he would leave the

vehicle

parked there until 6 o'clock in the morning, at which time

he would pick it up.

building, one on

5th Streot and. one on 4th streat.

MIKS GIOCONDO surveilled from the steps of the

church, near 5th and Cooper Streats. The membors of

the

group have decided that if they are questioned by a police

man with regard to their activities on the strest, at any

time during the surveillances, they will say they are waiting

for the number 53 bus to Clementon (which only runs every:

two or three hours).

A radio chock was conducted at 1 a.in. by ANITA

(Who was on either the fifth floor or the roof of Hutgers

Law School) and two individuals on the roof of the Town

House Apartments.

Another radio check was to have boon

conducted at 2 'a.m.; however, since he, LARDY, left at

ANDERSON, Harding Avenue and South Park Drive, Collingswood,

noted that those present at the ANDERSON residence were MARTHA

SHEMELEY, GENE DIXON, COOKIE, ANITA, JOHN GRADY, GRADY's family,

and BOB GOOD.

All members of the group were in good spirits

due to the fact that they felt that the Sunday night surveil-

lance had gone exceptionally well.

At abotit 9:30 p.M. to 9:45 p.m. all members of the

group went into the basement of the residence where the maps

It was at about

that time that Doctor ANDERSON came to the residence.. He had

something to eat and after that joined the rest of the group

in the basement.

JOHN GRADY has devised a plan that calls for several

cars to block key intersections at the time of the hit to

insure that the hit team has sufficient time to go unnoticed

from the alley to the roof of the Post Office Building.

BOB GOOD mentioned that RO RO. is. ROSEMARIE RILEY

(phonetic). GOOD also mentioned that he is leaving for New

York on Tuesday morning and will spent a couple of days there

contacting others who are experienced in actions of this type.

GOOD mentioned that he did not feel that it would be any trouble

to get additional "old actors" to come down for the hit.

who is on

or not Market Street is clear of police patrol cars. When he

has determined that Market Street is clear he will walk caddy-

HARDY stayed at the meeting until about 11:15 p.m.

at which time he left.

Plans currently call for a walkie-talkie to be with

someone in the alley.

GRADY has mentioned that he wants two

more walkie-talkies which would be of a better quality than

those which they have already obtained.

He desines this so

that the person on the roof of the lowne House Apartments

can

receive the transmissions from the person at the Fifth and Penn

Streets corner.

During the radio check it had been determined

that there was quite a bit of interference due to the buildings

which came between the rooftop and the person on the street.

GRADY mentioned again last night that the hit would

have to take place before August Ist since Doctor ANDERSON'S

family was returning

to the residence on that date.

GRADY also

mentioned that the hit would take place well in advance of

August Ist, and

that August lst was the "outside date.".

It it is determined that a person will be sent inside

the building on the day before the hit, it will be necessary

for the hit to take place on Saturday night.

This is due to the

Fact that it is

not possible to gain entry to the second floor

of the Post Office Building on any day other than a weekday.

It a member of the team does go into the Post Office Building

on the day prior to the hit this person would so to the fifth

floor and step out the hallway window and go around to the

Fourth Street side of the Fifth street roof. There is a six

loot wall which goes all the way around the top of the

floor.

There are no windows on that side. It

is his

impression

that either COOKTl: or ANITA would be the individual who would so

all unnecessary chatter should be eliminated while they were

ROBERT WILLIAM HARDY was interviewed and advised

as follows:

He would present the present plans for the Canden

"Draft board action" as told to him on July 19, 1971, at

Doctor ANDERSON's residence, Collingswood, l. J., by JOHN

GRADY, ANITA, arid COOKIE.

The plan involves about 22 people, approximately 10

automobiles, and " walkie-talkies (which are referred to as

"headsets" by members of the group). The plan is initially

concentrated on three points:

The

first key point is the

"number two position" on the l'ownhouse Apartment roof.

There

will be four people on theroof of the l'ownhouse Apartments.

One will be at the rear of the building looking toward the

alley behind the Post Office Building. The "number two posi

tion" is the key position of the entire operation.

In the number two position will be the individual who & verson

signal to start or stop the operation depending on the situation

as seen by the lookout.

The "number three" and "number four"

positions are "lookouts" who will be on the Townhouse Apartment

roof looking east and west on. Cooper Street. These individuals

will be within walking distance of the number two position.

•Plans call for JOHN GRADY to have the number two or key posi

tion.

A second key position is an automobile which will be

parked by the Ben Franklin Bridge on Fifth Street in the vici

nity of Fifth and Penn Streets.

The individual in this vehicle

will have a direct view of the third key position which will be

a person standing on the southwest corner of Fifth and Market

Streets, directly opposite the White lower Restaurant.

which he will place against the wall from the platform roof

When the last individual goes up the

Ladder onto the platiorn roof the individual who remains with

the van will take the ladder down and put in in the van. He

will

then either lock the van and walk away from the area or

he will drive away in the van.

At this point it would appear

most

likely that he would lock the van and walk away from it.

As the last man goes over the second floor roof le

will pull

the ladder up behind him so that it will not le

visible. They have determined

that they need about sixty

seconds to get the people from

the van onto the roof.

While menberd of the "hit team" are going up the

Ladder the cars if need be, will

start moving down Market

Street, down Fifth Street, across from Fourth and Cooper Streets,

across

from Fourth and Market Streets so that they will effectively

block off all entrances so that no one can see the

Two cars will be parked by the White Tower Restaurant,

Fifth and Market Streets, waiting for the light on Market Street:

Two cars will be parked on either side of the street on Fifth

Street pulling out after the man (Fifth and Market

Streets)

gets halfway across the street.

In other words this gives the

man at the key position located at Fifth and Penn Streets clear

vision of the man crossing the street.

The two cars on Fifth. Street will then pull out so

Mas to effectively cut off Fifth Street from any Macket Street

approach.

The traffic light signal will dictate which of the

two cars will start down Market Street first.

At the same time a car will be on Fourth Street waiting.

for the light at Fourth and Markol Streets.

This vehicle

will

be on the southeast corner of that intersection.

There will

also be another car between Market

Street and Markley Alley.

Another car will be at lourth and Cooper Streets on

the southeast corner of that intersection.

Another

car will be

at fourth and Cooper Streets on the northwest corner facing south:

It the need

arises those individuals in these cars

will drive around the block in order to give the hit team the

necessary protection in order to get into the building.

If

necessary these vehicles will block the corners of Fourth and

Cooper Streets,

Markley Alley, the corner of Fourth and Market

Streets, and if necessary the

corner of Fifth and Market Streets.

All of this will take place within a time span of sixty seconds.

There will also be a group of "out riders," that is

other cars which will be in the area at a distance further away

fron the

Post Office Building. At this point there has

only

been one "out rider" that has

been designated and that is one

that will be at Third and Federal Streets facing east.

It has

not as yet been determined what the function of this individual

in this car will be.

The general thought of the group with regard to the

plans would be that if something happens after the second "go"

the cars will return to their original positions.

while "casing" group has been operating on ten-minute intervals

During the surveillances the

group makes notations for each ten-minute interval; for instance,

From 11:50 to 12 o'clock midnight.

They are attempting to learn

of a thirty-minute time frame

wherein the traffic and police

patterns would be suitable for their gaining entry to the building.

They then plan to take the ten minutes fron the middle of this

thirty-minute frame and use this ten-minute frame for the hit..

The driver of the van after locking the van (after the

hit team has entered the building would walk away to a pre-

determined position which would most likely be the churchyard

behind the church located at Fiith and Cooper Streets.

In order for the operation to be initiated, the con-

ditions at the three key points have to be met.

That is, the

man at Fifth and Market Streets

after observing that all

was

clear must step off the curb and walk directly across the street

to the White Tower.

The man in the car at Fifth and Penn Streets

would have to note this and signal the first "go."

exit uf the building.

GRADY mentioned. that he listened over the

walkie-talkie as they went through the building and that he

heard a loud sound that sounded much like a shot. On hearing

this GRADY assumed that the "inside team" had kicked the glass

out of the back

door because they were unable to get it unlocked.

He broke the antenna either when he wound up the window or when

he pulled it in.

They were then puzzled as to why they could

tion reparding the security of the office..

IF DIXON were to do

so he would

use the pretext of working with the ex-convict

COOKIE and ANITA also wanted to know more about the

FBI Office

because they feel that if they can be successful in

hitting the draft board they can also be successful in hitting

the Army Intellipence Office on the fourth floor of the Post

Office Building and the FBI Office on the second floor..

They

feel that they could enter the fbl Office by sawinp, the door

in half or by cuttinp a panel out of the door which is what

they had done in the

draft board action at Broad Street in

Philadelphia.

HARDY.

related that at one time in the past he had

mentioned that GENE DIXON had talked to someone whom he had met

in Harrisburg.

He has recently learned that this individual

was PAUL, COUMING. DIXON in relating the story to him said that

he was in Harrisburg for some reason and that while there he ran

into COUMING on the Post Office uteps.

COUMING asked' DIXON if

he knew anyone who was

"not so non-violent." It was DIXON's"

impression in other words that COUMING was looking for someone

who would be capable of performing violent acts.

DIXON had

suggested to him (HARDY) that COUMING could possibly use some-

one

like him.

GRADY had received money over the weekend from whoever it

is that reprasenta DAN and PHILIP BERRIGAN. She recieved

$500 from this source, which was to sarve as expense money

Ior the needs of the GRADY family.

monay to come from the defense Committee in the New York City

area.

GRADY and ANITA went into the new Rutgers Law School

Building and were to be followed by cookIe, BOB GOOd, and HARdY.

HARDY parked his truck behind the Post Office and then joined

GOOD and COOKIE. As they approached the Law School Building

and ware about to entar through the predesignated door, a police

car, which appeared to come out of nowhera, came into the vicinity:

COOKIE and BARDY were able to get into the door and

BOB GOOD ran wast passed the Law School Building, through the

open construction area.

Once inside the building they encountered

GRADY, who was very upset. GRADY had feared that they had been.

apprehended by the police.

GRADY admonished them for not doing

careful. observation work before entering the building.

After a bit of maneuvering, GOOD was able to get back

to the building and entar it.

They then went to the fifth floor.

to the cornex office, which is located on the Fifth Street side.

They did observation

work from there. GRADY attempted to convey to

GOOD and HARDY what had been seen the night before from the law

School Building.

At this point, HARDY pointed out that GOOD did not

go to New York on Tuesday noming as he was supposed to.

GOOD

is, however; planning to leave this morning (July 22, 1971) and

he has packed his bags and made up a sign for hitchhiking to

Nas York City.

Ha supposadly will leave GIOCONDO's at 11:00

a.m. on July 22, 1971.

It was mentioned by GRADY that they had used headsets

(walkie-talkies) before in the Wilmingion, Del., and Bridgeton

actions.

GRADY nantioned that COOKIE used a headset in the

Bridgeton action.

GRADY also mentioned that they had used the

"Flashlight signal system" in the Bridgeton action.

This is

the method by which they tape the facd of a flashlight leaving

only a quartor inch hole so that they can gat a hign intensity

beam of light from one point to another wathout actually showing

the full ray of light from the flashlight.

It was discussed

that DIXON had not performed his duties with regard to the

purchasing of headsats (walkie-talkiés).

GRADY gave him (HARDY) $150 and told him to buy

some walkie-talkies.

After the discussion concerning DIXON, JOHN GRADY

mentioned that this would no longer be a "Canden action"

because he (HARDY) was the last person from Camden who was

accually physically involved, GRADY said that they would

definitely have to bring in outsiders to perform the hit.

said that he would be going to the Law. School Building to do

some observation work by himself.

GRADY walked with him about

The surveillance plan as of last night was

for

rather MICHAEL DOYLE, MIKE GIOCONDO, JOHN GRADY, and ANITA,

to go to the roof of

the new Rutgers Law School

Building

with one "headset."

The plans called for COOKIE to go to

and for MARDY

checks from various points so that the group could determine

the range of the walkie-talkies and also what type of incei

ference would be encountered.

During the discussions, a talephone call was received

from BOB GOOD, who was in New York City.

GRADY explained the

procedure by which GOOD makes his telephone calls.

GRADY ex-

plained that GOOD will call GRADY using a fictitious name.

This alerts GRADY to the fact that the call is from BOB GOOD.

GRADY will then reply to the operator that the person who has

been asked for is not there.

GRADY will then go to the pay

phone, locatad in front of the Camden County Pack Police

Headquarters: and make a station-to-station call to BOB GOOD.

GRADY told the group that the message from GOOD

was that ANNE and MURpH would be down tonight to look over

the scene and to see what they could add to the plan.

GRADY

also mentioned that GOOD had advised him that ED MC GOWAN

was in Toronto, Canada, and was not available at the moment:

It was also mentioned that ROSEMARI REILLY, also known as

RU KO, was in Burtalo, N.Y., at the time and that they were

not sure as to her availability for the action.

During the surveillance, the group spent their

time in going over the four check

points and the positions

varlous paople would be and what the

jobs of the people

would be.

He (HARDY)

started at Fifth and Pearl Streets

(by the bridge) and conducted a radio check with the people

on the roof of the law school and those on the roof of the

Townhouse Apartments.

He then went to Broadway and Market

and parked on the corner by hit Brothers to conduct a visual

contact.

He explained that this position is one of the key

points at the moment.

and Federal Streets, where he parked on the corner and checked

transmission over the "headsets." The fourth check point was

NW 65994 Docld:32989694 Page 391

on Fourth Street, north of the underpass. Good radio reception

was received at three of the check points. At the fourth check

point there was a little bit of static. Members of the group

compiled notes as to the

radio reception received from the various

check points.

During discussions last night, GRADY said that the

group was not ready for tha action as yet. ANITA concurred

in this opinion. GRADY said that things were "just not tight

enough."

During the middle of next week, GRADY's family is

leaving the ANDERSON home and going to a camping site in the

Wildwood Crest or the Cape May Courthouse area (New Jersey).

Doctor ANDERSON's family will be coming back into town next

Saturday.

He- (HARDY) left the surveillance area at approximately

4:00 a.m,, after completing the last radio check.

COOKIE,

Father MICHAEL DOYLE, MIKE GIOCONDO and JOHN GRADY intended

to stay on the Law School Building until at least 6:00 a.m.

At about that time they walked the streets and tried to determine

ways of going in and out of the building.

GRADY has mentioned that when the

action takes placa

it will be on a Saturday or Sunday night. Last night GRADY

said that they will need twelve cars, six with drivers and

six parked.

GRADY told

members of the group last night that

they should start thinking about where they could get extra

cars.

GRADY indicated that these cars would be used to

effectively block off different area, if need be.

The group has a list of unmarked cars that have been

in the area during their nightly surveillances.

ing to determine who the regular occupants of these

by "just driving around" and looking into the White Tower Rest-

aurant and the various other spots where plain-clothed detectives

would normally make their stops.

HARDY then advised that the following vehicles have

been used by members of the group in connection with the operation:

DOCtOr ANDERSON's car has

been used exclusively by

GRADY.

GIOCONDO 's Renault has been used by GRADY, COOKIE,

Father MICHAEL DOYLE's car has been used by GRADY

and ANITA.

Mxs, GRADY's Comet, which bears New York license

plate, has been used by GRADY and COOKIE, for transportatior

into North Canden.

They do not use this car on surveillances

because they are concerned that it will draw suspicion due to

having a New York license plate.

GENE DIXON'S Ford has been used by DIXON, MARTHA

SHEMELEY, and ANITA.

He (HARDY) does not believe that they have used

MARNIE O'DELL's car as yet; however, GRADY has mentioned

that they would be able to use this car if they so desire.

GRADY also mentioned that they were going to ask

GEORGE and LOUISE SLATER if they could use their car on the

night of the action.. GRADY also mentioned that they would

ask the SLAtERs if they would drive the car on the night of

the action.

ANITA has started making up a list of names of

people that she would be able to contact concerning the

use of the cars on the night of the

action.

four inches by seven inches.

He saw this notebook but was

unable to retain the

names of the people on the list.

ANITA also has a list containing names of twelve

different people who she will contact outside the city.

(HARDY was unable to furnish any of these

names.)

NW 65994 Docld:32989694 Page 393

It was HARDY's opinion GRADY is "dragging this

thing out" because he has nothing to do after this action.

He has also observed that GRADY is very security conscious

at this point.

GRADY has indicated that he will stay in the area

after his family goes camping at the shore.

ANDERSON and GRADY both have indicated that they

feel that plans are

"almost down pat" and that they will

have to wait a little longer before actually conducting the

action.

When everything is clear, the signal will come

down from the roof of the Townhouse Apartments to the man

driving the van, indicating that all is clear.

Also, a

Meanwhile, if there is some problem, they will

still have paople in cars who can block Markley Street,

Fourth Street; and Cooper Street.

Plans now call for the action to take place on

a Saturday night between 11:30 p.m.

and 12:15 a.m., (Sunday

morning).

GRADY feels chat the police activity at this time

would be the minimum, due to the changing of the shifts.

During last night's surveillance, they went through

four different times, starting at 12:15; 12:20, 12:25, and

12:30.

They noted that at each time they would have had the

necessary two minutes to get the group into the building.

They noted, in fact, that they would have had a complete

those y

twenty minutes, if necessary.

BOB GOOD mentioned last night that he would be

going to New York City on Tuesday or Wednesday to talk to

some more people.

Apparently, CookiE has been contacting some more

people in Philadelphia.

GRADY now feels

that he has better control of the

situation from the roof of the new Rutgers Law School Building.

GRaDy has noted that from that position, he can see Broadway

and Market Streets, the Post Office alley, the van, the Town-.

house Apartments, and the Fourth Street underpass.

NED MURPHY and ANN DUNHAM will be going back to

New York tonight.

It was HARDY's imprassion that MURPHY and DUNHAM

were very impressed and that they would probably be bringing

sompone back with them when they would return from New York.

MURPHY mentioned the name of JOE O'ROURKE from the

New York area. MURPHY mentioned that, either in the context,.

O'ROURKE was involved in the "New York Hight" action or the

"Harrisburg Conspiracy" trial action...

HARDY left the surveillance at approximately 1:15

a.M.

It was his understanding that the rest of the group would

remain until six in the morning.

MURPHY also mentioned that if the group was inside

the building long enough that it would be no trouble to take

a look

at the Army Intelligence Office and the FBI Office.

MURPHY mentioned that it was very unusual for an Army Intelligence

Office to be in an area of this type, and that because of this,

he felt that there must be some important records in that office.

HARDY

went over the positions of various members

of the group during the surveillance of last night. COOKIE

and ANN DUNHAM were on the Townhouse Apartment roof; GIOCONDO

was in a vehicle on Fourth Street at the underpass on the

North Canden side of the bridge; ANITA and GRADY were on the

Law School roof; BOB GOOD was at Fourth Street and Marklay

Alley; MIKE DOYLE was at Fourth. and Macket, parked on the

corner so that he had a good view of Market Street and Fourth

Street.

MURPHY was in the telephone booth directly across

from City Hall. 'He (HARDY)

was at Broadway and Market Streets

by the corner of Lit Brothers. He stayed there for twenty

minutes and at every five minute intervalhe would open his

trunk for a few minutes.

It was mentioned last night that a woman who was

the head of the Illinois Nursing Association, who was the

person who ran the Dow Chemical action.

It was mentioned

that she was the key person in this action.

It was also

indicated that she is unmarried and about 45 years old.

All members of the group spoke of her with admiration.

Upon arrival,

he noted that those present were BOB GOOD, ANITA, and

BOB GOOD, during the meeting, mentioned that he

would spend another month in Camden because "things that

he had going for him in New York City are still in che

talk stage.

GOOD offered to take him (HARDY) to New York

City fox a couple of days the next. time that he went

there.

COOKIE commented that during the two years that

she has known GRADY, that this is the most "string-out,"

tired, Irritable, and short tempered, that she has ever

seen him. COOKIE said that she has never seen GRADY at

such a low point. COOKIE felt that this was due to the

neavy errects of the survelllances, or casings; the lact

that he has had to spend much time

away from his family;

and other factors.

COOKIE felt that another reason for

GRADY's low morale was the fact that he has not been getting

GRADY was going to the shore yesterday with his

wife because he had to go to Capa May, N.J., for a lecture

which he would deliver in connection with MEL MADDEN'S Drug

Program.

GRADY and his wife intended to look at the camp

sites, after GRADY's lecture, and then go to Doctor ANDERSON's

sunmer home in Sea Isle City, where they

would have dinner

and drinks with Doator and Mrs. ANDERSON.

That night,

upon leaving for the surveillance in

Landen ,

the group left BOB GOOD at the ANDERSON residence

so that he could take care of the GRADY children, who were

there, and also so that GOlD could get a good night's sleep

since

he was leaving early in the morning for New York City.

He (HARDY!, ANITA, and COOKIE left in his truck.

They stopped by the new Rutgers Law School Building where

ANITA axited the truck in. order to enter the Law School Build-

ing. After ANITA was safely inside of

the Law School Build

2ng, Cookis and he went to the South side of Market Street,

in front of the little Bazaar, located across from the Post

Office Building in Camden. COOKIE remained in the truck to

do her observation work from the front

• Of the Post Office

Building,

(referred

by the group as the "lawn side" of

the building).

He then walked to the white lower, picked up a cup

coffee, and

then proceeded to walk down Fifth Street, north

of Cooper Street to Fourth Streat and back down Fourt Street,

Street 3 north,

where be sat on a step opposite Fourth Street and Markley

Ayahue. • He observed the Post ofiice Iron that point.

He stayed

there until 12:40 a.m.,. at which time he returnedto his truck,

where COOKIE had been sitting.

The two of them drove around in his truck, checking

out the police garage behind sears, and counting the black an.

white cars, as well as the unmarked cars. They then retumoc

to the area of the Post Office and went to the City Hall Parking

Lot, which is referred to by the group as "garden").

While by the City Hall Parking Lot, thay counted

the rest oi the

pacrol cars

(black and white cars). After

counting the marked cars at the two locations, they were

able to account for all of the patrol cars, except for

three, during the evening.

They felt that they knew where

twenty-two of the police cars where.

They then went to the gasoline station located

at Seventh and Cooper Streets, where COOKIE picked up some

cigarettes:

They then went to Friends Avenue, where he

dropped off COOKIE so that she could go to the roof of the

Townhouse Apartments, (referred to by the group as filmore).

COOKIE went to the rooftop at approximately 1:30

a.m,, at which time he left the area. The plan was for

COOKIE, and ANITA to stay on the rooftops, making radio

con-

tacks with each other and observing the buildings until

4:00 a.M., at which time they would both leave the ared.

HARDY mentioned that ANITA now returns home many

nights during

the week, while COOKIE spends the night either

at GENE DIXON's apartment (517 Penn Street, Camden, N.J.) or

at MIKE GIOCONDO's apartment (Third and Cooper Streets,

Canden,

N.J.). Sometimes COOKIE spends the night in Philadelphia, at

a place unknown to him. COOKIE has said to him that she does

not go home at night.

During the course of the surveillance last night,

it was mentioned that ANN DUNHAM would be coming back from

New Yorks City today, and that NED MURPHY would also possibly

be maturning.

In the past, GRADY and MURPHY have both mentioned

that JoE O'RoUrke would be involved in some way in this action..:

MURPHY had indicated that he would possibly be

bringing someone backwith him when he returned to Canden.

MURPHY also indicated that ANN was going to New York City

in order to get some commitments from some other people

who would be involved in the action. BOB GOOD, who left

for New York: City this morning, is due to be back in Camden

on Thursday.

Last Monday, GRADY said if the action doas not

"come off" within

the next ten days or so, that he would

get away for a while, COOKIE and ANITA have voiced the

same sentiment.

GRADY said that he was not sure what they would

do with the material which they obtain from the draft board.

GRADY did say, however, that they normally bum the material,

and that they often find an abandoned farm some place and

make a big. fire with the material.

During discussions of the action, GRADY and NED

Murphy mentioned the possibility of going Into the Army

Intelligence Office.

COOKIE, ANITA, BOB GOOD, and in this

instance, MURPHY, have at times interjected the thought as

to hitting the Army Intelligence Office.

MURPHY said that

there is no reason for having an Army Intelligence Office

in the Camden Post Office Building, and that "they must have

something very good in thare that would be helpful to the

group..

It was mentioned that they would probably destroy

those records that they were not able to carry away from the

draft board.

It was mentioned that they would probably "rip

що!"

those files.

It was also mentioned that at a previous

action they had taken a paper cutter into the draft board for

the purpose of destroying the files, but that someone left

the paper cutter and fingerprints were found on it.

BOB GOOD mentioned that over eight hundred files

filken during the recent Massachusetts Draft Board action.

noob also mantioned that these files sere mailed to the

registrants. COOKIE said that they had done the same thing

once before, mailing a couple of hundred files to the respective

registrants.

GOOD did not relate subsequently as to how he

acquired the knowledge regarding the Massachusetts action,

but he (GOOD) indicated that information concerning that action

is now common-knowledge within the underground movement.

It was mentioned by members of the group last night

that during the surveillances prior to the Trenion Draft Board

action, that the group used a code when talking over the radios.

HARDY advised that upon arriving at the roof of the

"Fillinore" he met GENE DIXON and then

came.

This was approximately 1:30 andshortly thereafter GRADY

at this time the

following people had congregated on the roof: JOHN GRADY,

ANITA, COOKIE, GENE DIXON, and NED MURPHY. The group then

had a

15-minute conference talking over

what all they had seen

in the surveillance.

At this time it was decided that since

GRADY was taking his family down to the campsite NED MURPHY,

ANN DUNHAM, and ANITA would stay at the ANDERSON home and that

COOKIE WOuld go tO GENE DIXON's apartment.

It was further

decided that the group would meet

at Dr. ANDERSON's home that

night at I p.m.; that they would start out early in the evening

to go over the plans in order to prepare for a full dry run

Saturday night.

HARDY explained that the group was planning to estab

lish surveillances at 10 o'clock Friday night rather than 11

becausa there had been changes in the shifts of the people

working inside the Post Office and they wanted to gather more

information regarding people going in and out of the Post Office.

HARDY explained that the group expected BOB GOOD to

be back along with MIKE DOYLE, MIKE GIOCONDO, and possibly MEI.

MADDEN.

HARDY further explained that the group

did. not go

to the Rutgers Law School Building last night because ine building

is now pretty well lighted and that it is impractical to do any

surveillance work there.

GRADY said that he did not feel that

"GRADY explained that he was doing a

little riding around and parking in his car and said that he

got down to Third and.

a contre one has par

Market and was able to get a pretty good

shot at the Fourth and

Market Street sides of the Post Office.

GRADY felt that this was sufficient for the group's needs.

In regard to the early surveillance

time, the group is

concerned about

the fact that there are cleaning: people in the

building past midnight.

He explained that these people are

there sometimes until 2 or 3 in the norning so apparently they

are coning in at 9 or 10 and the group is not observing them when

they go in.

HARDY advised that the papers and plans are still

in the crib in the ANDERSON home with the exception of the

slide projector which is located in the room; however, the

slides

are in the crib..

HARDY briefly described the collec-

tion of documents and plans as being ten large 24 by 36 sheets

of poster board containing street maps with plastic overlays

on them so that the group can write down their observations

and then as developments arise they can later erase them.

There are: e half. dozen assorted notebooks and a small filing

DOSX-.

HARDY stated that a full dress rehersal will be con-

ducted Saturday night.

'He described this as cars moving in the

area with the ideal thing being that people will actually fill

the observation and surveillance spots that will be occupied

• during the actual hit.

HARDY noted that GRADY seems to be well rested now

and is thinking clearly.

He is not drinking as much as he has

in the past and is his normal self:

HARDY explained he is much

the same person he had met

the fixst time.

HARDY advised that when COOKIE and ANITA were arrested

the other night for shoplifting, he believes the place to be

Wanamaker's Department Store at the Moorestown Mall.

• He further

advised that at the time that they were picked up at Wanamaker's

they were photographed and then let go.

ROBERT WILLIAM HARDY telephonically contacted Special

Agent TERRENCE P. NEIST and advised as follows:

On July 30, 1971, he went to the residence of Doctor

WILLIAM A. ANDERSON, Collingswood, N. J.

Upon his arrival

he noted that Doctor ANDERSON's family had returned from their

summer home in Sea Isle City, N. J., and that the GRADY family

was in the process of moving out of the ANDERSON residence and

05 c

getting ready to leave for their campsite at the shore.

As he drove up to the residence, JOHN GRADY called

and

signalled for him to back his truck up to the. ANDERSON

residence..

GRADY then told him to put GRADY's personal effects,

as well as the plans, documents, and slides relating to the pro-

posed Camden Draft Board hit, into his truck and to, sometime

during the next day, take these materials to the apartment of

EUGENE DIXON, 517 Penn Street; Camden, N. J., where they would

be sorted out at a later date.

GRADY said that he would probably be staying at

DIXON's apartment for the next week and that they would have

plenty of time to sort out the various documents and put them

in their proper places.

HARDY did as he was

instructed by GRADY and loaded

the various materials into his truck. GRADY told HARDY to take

at Rot ron, for lie triday nich observation or ine.

At approximately 8 p.m. on that night JOHN GRADY,

the night at the shore and set up the campsite the next

morning and then return to the Camden area around lunchtime.

Before

the GRADY family had left; COOKIE, ANITA, ANN

DUNHAM, and MIKE GIOCONDO took Mrs: GRADY's brother, Father MIKE

SHAUGHNESSY, to the Philadelphia Airport where he would take a

flight to Washington, D. Ci, enroute to Detroit, Mich.

HARDY and NED MURPHY left together and met with MIKE

GIOCONDO at GIOCONDO's apartment, Third and Cooper Streets,

Camden, N. J.

While enroute to GIOCONDO's apartment, HARDY asked

if any other people would be coming down for the action. MURPHY

replied that there would be nothing to worry about because plenty

of people would be coming here for the action when the time came.

MURPHY indicated

that the only thing that was necessary was for

GRADY to set the

time and that once the time was set the people

would respond to GRADY's call.

Before ANN DUNHAM left, she asked HARDY to leave his

phone number with Doctor ANDERSON so that when her boyfriend

FRANK (last name unknown) arrived in the Canden area on Saturday

he would be able to get in touch with him.

Last night GIOCONDO said that GRADY had told him

(GIOCONDO) that he (GRADY) would be sleeping at Doctor ANDERSON'S

"Flat" and would more than likely hold the group neetings there

rather than at GENE DIXON'S apartment.

Last night he went to GIOCONDO's apartment at approxi-

mately 9:45.

When he arrived MURPHY and GIOCONDO were there.

They decided upon three observation positions to be used on

that night. One position was in his ( HARDY) van, which will

be parked in front of the little bazaar which is located between

Fourth and Fifth Streets on Market Street directly across from

the United States Post Office Building: It was determined that

HARDY would make observations as to when the night watchman

arrived and if and when he came out of the building. GIOCONDO.

was to be in GRADY's Comet (with New York license tags) parked

at Fourth Street and Markley Avenue (alley). GIOCONDO was to

observe the night watchman with regard to his entering the mail

platform in the rear of the Post Office building.. NED MURPHY

NW 65994 Docld:32989694 Page 428

## Page 429

PH 52-7165 SUB

was to be on the roof of the lownhouse Apartments where he

would observe any movement on the wings of the Post Office

building on the third, fourth, and fifth floors.

At 12:30 a.n. it was planned for HARDY to start his

truck and travel on Fourth Street toward Cooper Street. MURPHY

would see the

truck coming and would then come around the corter.

GIOCONDO would also see the truck and the three of them would

then rendezvous at GIOCONDO's apartment.

They performed their observations that night

according to the above-mentioned plans.

During the observations they learned that at 10 p.m.

when HARDY drove to the front of the Post Office building the

guard was standing by the doorway.

HARDY went over to the

guard and talked to him on the pretext of buying some stamps

from the stamp machine.

He found out from the guard that he

is relieved at 11:45 to 12 midnight.

After this, the group

performed two and one half hours of observations.

At approximately 12:30 a.m. HARDY made the righi

hand turn onto Fourth Street, according to the plans, and

subsequent to that met GIOCONDO and MURPHY at GIOCONDO's apart-

men't.

When they met they discussed what had been. seen by the

their observations. It was agreed upon

thre whichever or them first heard from GRADY during the day of

Jaturday, July 31, 1971, would contact

the others.

HARDY advised that during previous talks with MURPHY,

ANITA, and COOKIE, it was mentioned that the group would con-

duct a

dry run on Saturday night (July. 31, 1971) on a large-

as-possible scale with as many people as possible involved.

When HARDY left the meeting he took NED MURPHY tO

GENE DIXON'S

apartment located at Fifth and Penn Streets, Camden,

N. J.

Before leaving last night GRADY told him that he

had gotten a letter from DAN and PHIL BERRIGAN and

said that

the letter was very encouraging and that money was

received

with the letter.

It was mentioned that the person from North Jersey who

would be bringing down the camping equipment for the Grady.

Family would be Father JOE SHUSTER. From the conversation it

was apparent that SHUSTER is a friend of the GRADYs from either

East Orange, N. j., Union, N. J., or one of the northern New

Jersey cities.

It was also apparent from the conversation that:

he is a priest.

HARDY recalled that Mrs. GRADY said that

"Father JOE is bringing our camping equipment down."

HARDY

then inquired of Mrs. GRADY as to the identity of Father JOE.

Mrs, GRADY replied that he was Father JoE SHUSTER.

On a recent night, MIKE GIOCONDO and BOB GOOD

were talking

about surveillances they were conducting in

connaction with the Trenton, N.J., Draft Board break-in.

During this conversation, GIOCONDO related the following

information, which had been told to him by JOHN GRADY:

In the spring of 1971, while conducting a surveillance

in connection with the Irenton Draft Board break-in, JOHN

GRADY was sitting on the passenger side, front seat, of a

vehicle driven by GENE DIXON.

Two girls (not named) were

in the back seat.

A police officer approached the vehicle

and asked for identification of DIXON, which was furnished

the officer.

When the officer asked for identification

Ixom GRADY; GRADY raplied,"What for?" The police officer

explained that it was gerputine inquiry, but GRADY still

refused to furnish

ris!

any taentification.

-The potice officer then took GRADY to the polica

station

and" "booked him" on some charge, deriving fron the

Gaot that GRADY would not identify himself. (It was HARDY's

Impression that the charge was something along the line of

disorderly :conduct.)

One of the members of the group posted $25 bail

fOr GRADY on that night and GRADY was subsequently released

pending a hearing.

The members of the group spent the next couple of

nights at El Centero, (Canden, N.J.) determining as to what

"story" they would give at

the forthcoming hearing.

Father MICHAEL DOYLE arranged for JOE RODRIGUEZ,

a Camden, N.J., attorney, to represent GRADY at the hearing.

While the members of the group were practicing

The purpose in observing from the

GRADY is due back from the shore tonight.

The code words GINO and OLIVER are now used when

Last night the code word PEARCE was used in referring

to MICHAEL DOYLE. •

The group used "z Square" to refer to the lour streets

surrounding the Post Office building

In other words, "2

Square" would refer to the area which is bounded by Cooper,

4th, Market and 5th Streets.

The group is only concerned with

any car that touches two of these streets.

In other words

if an unmarked or police car comes down 5th Street and makes

e right onto Market, the group would mention that there was

a car in the "z Square.

They would send out a radio

transmission such as "we are at the card game, somebody is in

As the girls were Leaving,

a friendof MIKE GIOCONDO'S

named MILO BILLMAN stopped by GIOCONDO's apartment. BILLMAN

lives on Fourth Street, between Cooper and Arch Streets. From

the conversation, it was apparent that BILLMAN is well

aware of

the plans with regard to the proposed hir.

BILLMAN is a white male, approximately 34 years of age.

He has a very bushy beard, a very full head of hair, and "looks

like Moses."

He is a Presbyterian Minister and works for the

Camden Metropolitan Ministry. He works with another minister

named SAM. APPLE (ph).

BILLMAN left at approximately 10:15 p.m: "At that time

NED MURPHY and ED MC GOWAN arrived at GIOCONDO's apartment. They

said that they would be in the area until Sunday night.

MC GOWAN expressed his disappointment when he learned

that GRADY was down at the shore and indicated that he desired

to talk to GRADY, It was mentioned that he (MC GOWAN) would

possibly ride down to the shore to see GRADY and GRADY's family.

It was apparent from the conversation that MC GOWAN is an old

friend of the GRADY family.

It was decided that he (HARDY) would take NED MURPHY

and ED MC GOWAN to Doctor ANDERSON's apartment, so that MC GOWAN.

could "get the feeling of what is going on here."

At that point BOB GOOD was on the roof of the Townhouse

Apartments, having come there at approximately 10:00 p.m.

COOKIE

was

supposed to be picking up Father MICHAEL DOYLE at 10:45 p.m.,

and was to leave hin and ANN DUNHAM in the church yard across

the street trom the tront of the Post Office Building.'

"During the conversations last night, it was mentioned pir

that MURPHY and MC GOWAN had been involved in several actions

in the past. As MURPHY introduced MC GOWAN he said,

"ED has

been around for quite a while.

He has been involved in several

actions with us, and we would like him to see what's going on

so. that he can get the feel of it."

MC GOWAN is a white male, 5'10" in height, 155 pounds

in weight, with a "heavy head of hair," well groomed. His hair

extends over his ears, but not down to the collar.of his shirt.

He has brown hair and sideburns to the mid ear. He wears

horn-rimmed glasses with dark frames.

(The new style with

large glass in them.)

Last night he wore a pair of Levis,

a sport shirt, and loafers without socks. He seemed to be

quiet and observant.

For instance, when

he entered his

(HARDY'S) truck; he imnediately noticed the type of work

that HARDY does.

He (HARDY) left GIOCONDO's apartment in his truck

wIth MC GOWAN and MURPHY.

They went to Doctor ANDERSON'S

apartment so that MC GOWAN could see "what was going on.".

Upon arriving at ANDERSON's apartment, however,

they were

unable to gain entrance to the building.

This was due to

the fact that no one answered the telephone or door bell

when they called.

After that, they went to the roof of the Townhouse

apartments, arriving

at approximately 11:30 p.m. Also present

on the root at that time were BoB GOOd and MIKE Giocondo.

After a period of time on the roof HARdy left the roof and

got back into his truck.

Last night a new name was mentioned. HARDY

was

unable to recall exactly the name of this person but believed

it was something like "LENA MOSER or MUSHER."

It was mentioned

that this girl was due in today. According to the conversation,

she is from New York.

It was mentioned that REILLY had been in Buffalo prion

to coming to the Camden action. It was indicated that she was

in Buffalo to work in connection. with the "action," which GOOD enc

these lines unless he is on an "acid trip." It was at this

point that REILLY nentioned that she and WILLIAMSON had had

DIXON's apartment is being used as sleeping quarters

GRADY normally stays at ANDERSON's apartment, Broad-

Yesterday GRADY drove Father DOYLE's car to the shore

and returned from the shore in this vehicle, taking it to

ANDERSON's apartment.

When he arrived at ANDERSON's apartment

ANN DUNHAM, REILLY, and GIOCONDO were still there and had the

keys for the Renault (GIOCONDO's car). At this point GRADY told

DUNHAM and REILLY tO USE DOYLE's car to go to downtown Canden

so that it would be returned to DOYLE. GRADY then would use

GIOCONDO's vehicle.

About two or three nights ago members of the group

started using GIOCONDO's tape recorder to record the results

their surveillances.

It is a portable tape recorder and nembers

of the group use it on the rooftop and in the churchyard of the

Episcopal Church rather than writing notes. They speak into the

recorder giving the infornation learned from their surveillances ...i

MIKE GIOCONDO purchased a second tape recorder, a snall Japanese por

tape recorder, for approximately $l6 yesterday.

These tape

recorders are

used every night and are supposed

to be returned

to ANDERSON's apartment after the surveillance.

The materials kept in ANDERSON's apartment are kept in

the small closet in the living room. The radios, binoculars,

there.

The only thing which ordinarily would not be at that

Location would be equipment which was used by menders of the

BUCKALEW mentioned that they had come to the meeting

in his pickup truck.

Later in the evening, he (HARDY> drove around the

area trying to spot a pickup truck that generally fit the

description of BUCKALEW 's truck.

He noted a blus Chevrolet

pickup truck, either a 1964 or 1965 model, bearing Ohio 1971

license plate 412610. This truck generally met the description

of BUCKAL00's truck.

This truck had a wooden banper built on

the back of it.

Although he felt that the truck with the Ohio license

plate might be BUCKALEW's truck, he noted another truck chat

came close to meeting the description.

This truck was a blue

Chevrolet van-type pickup, which. bore license CW-31004.

During the conversation, WILLIAMSON asked GIOCONDO

how RO RO REILLY had been doing with regard to making the con-

tacks with people outside the area..

GIOCONDO said that RO RO

REILLY had contacted PAUL. COUMING and that PAUL COUMING would

definitely be coming down this weekend. GIOCONDO also said that

ANN DUNHAM had called from New York and said that she and FRANK

GIOCONDO

said that the contact from Buffalo, N.Y., had not as

yet given

an answer as to whether or not anyone from Buffalo would be

coming to the area.

They then left and want to Doctor ANDERSON's apartment,

Broadway

and Royden Streets, Canden, N.J.When theyarrived, they

noted that BOB GOOD and RO RO REILLY were at the apartment working

on the charts.

WILLIAMSON, BUCKALEW, and KIRK remäined at ANDERSON'S

apartment with GOOD and REILLY, while GIOCONDO and HARDY

went

back to the area of the United States Post Office Building so

that they could watch the front of the building.

They (HARDY

and GIOCONDO stayed in front of the Post Office Building until

about 10:45 p.m., at which time thay went back to ANDERSON's

apartment and picked up everyone and brought them all to GENE

DIXON's apartment.

RO RO REILLY had left her binoculars and

radio at DIXON's apartment the night before when she slept there.

It was at approximately 11:00 p.m. when they leit

ANDERSON's apartment for DIXON'S

apartment.

They picked up

some equipment at DIXON's and then went to GIOCONDO's apartment,

arriving at approximately 11:05 p.m.

He (HARDY)

dropped off everyone there and it was

planned that TERRY and KIRK would go to the rooftop with either

GIOCONDO Or REILLY, in order to observe from there.

He (HARDY) then drove around Market Street to the

front of the Post Office Building to do surveillance work. He

later learned

that none of the new people (BUCKALEW, KIRK; and

WILLIAMSON) went to the roof on that night since they had to get

back to Philadelphia, Pa. It was mentioned that BUCKALEW and KIRK

had been up to the roof

somatime approximately three of four months

ago.

It was mentioned by GOOD that BUCKALEW and KIRK had

been to the rooftop of the Townhouse Apartments in the past.

GOOD.

said that about a year ago while thay were planning the Broad

Street Draft Board Action (Philadelphia, Pa.) that on a couple

of nights they came oves to Camden to look around. GOOD mentioned

at that time they were surveilling from the playground at Fifth

and Cooper Streets, and that one night ANITA, GRADY, and a third

person, on Sunday, want to church service at the Methodist Church

behind

the Post Office Building and after church, they hid in the

back of the church and stayed there all night observing the Post.

Office Building. Apparently BUCKALEW, was part of the group that

did this.

It was mentioned by GOOD that KIRK was in the past

over here giving "lockpicking" instructions ai ANDERSON's residence,

at which time he spent one night on the rooftop of the Townhouse

Apartments with a couple members of the group.

He (HARDY)

stayed in front of the Post Office Building

until approximately 12:05

so that he might observe the changing of

the guard. BOB GOOD was supposed to relieve him at that time by

going into the church yard of the Episcopal Church, which is across

from the front of the Post Office Building. GOOD did not show up

at the church yard.

He (HARDY) then drove around the area and went

to GIOCONDO's apartmant. Upon arriving at the apartment, he

learned from RO RO that JOHN GRADY has

just called in by

tele-.

phone and said that there was a torreritial downpour at the shore,

which had almost washed away GRADY's tent. RO RO explained that

GRADy told her that he could not lave that night, but would be

leaving early this morning (August 12; 1971).

RO RO said that GRADY told her to tell HARDY

they would need the truck for this weekend, whether it was a dry

run or the actual hit.

GRADY mentioned to

RO RO that they would

need the truck on Saturday night, and possibly on Sunday night,

if the action did not take place on Saturday.

RO RO REILLY asked GRADY if MC GOWAN was still with

him. GRADY, according to REILLY, said that MC GOWAN had left

for

New York City yesterday, and

that he would return to the

Camden

area this weekend.

REILLY tOld GRADY that NED MURPHY was not in the

Camden area, and that he (MURPHY) had said that he was going

to Rochester for the weekend, but that he (MURPHY) would come

to Camden, if the hit is going to take place this weekend.

REILLY also told GRADY she had contacted others as

GRADY had instructed her to do.

She told GRADY that she received

positive responses from most of those whom she had contacted.

After REILLY finished talking with GRADY, he (HARDY)

took GOOD in his truck and dropped him off at his (GOOD's)

surveillance point. After doing this, HARDY left the area.

During the afternoon, while at Doctor ANDERSON'S

apartment, he(HARDY) noticed a file card which was lying on the

floor.

He picked up this card and has retained it.

Written on

the card is

"Me Hugh, Lansdale,, Pa."

It would appear that the

writing on this card

was done by COOKIE.

Last night, while talking with GIOCONDO in front of

the Post Office Building, GIOCONDO said that he saw MEL MADDEN

yesterday, and that MADDEN said that he would probably come down

Saturday

if the "real thing" was going to take place.

GIOCONDO also said that MADDEN had related to him

Mass., Draft board action, that they mailed out 700 to 800

pieces of communication, which contained literature and excerpts

from the stolen Selective Service files.

SWINGLISH said that he has been involved in mailing

out communications, which contain excerpts

from the stolen files

•in past draft board actions. SWINGLISH said that after one

action he went from Boston to Washington, D.C., mailing these

letters in every maior city between the two points.

He mentioned

that the newspapers had mentioned that these letters contained

had learned that the guard is blind in one eye and 68 years old.

Because of this, GRADY feels that it would be feasible for

He learned that the girls were able to find out

where at least half the files are kept and that they will also

go back into the draft board again today at about 3:30.

HARDY advised that TERRY BUCKALEW worked on the

personnel problems as far as where people would be sleeping and

also on the entrance into the draft board.

He stated that a

little later in the evening RORO helped him with chis task.

HARDY advised that he ascertained the following

operational procedure from TERRY BUCKALEW for the

actual

"entrance team":

There will be

a tean of eight people with TERRY

BUCKALEW acting as the driver of the truck.

Those people com

prising the entrance tean are MIKE GIOCONDO, MIKE DOYLE, BOB

They will handle Draft Board

Number 8 which is in the Markley Avenue

and Fifth Streat

corner of the draft board room.

The third team will be ANN

DUNHAM and PAUL COUMING.

COUMING's main job is to handle the

radio contact with the outside.

While they were going over the entrance team's duty

it was brought up that there is a conference roon off of the

draft board area which

is part of the draft board and has a set

of windows.

The draft board employees use

this for their con-

terences.

It came out in the meting that it might be easiex

to make

entry into the

draft board through the conference room

windows rather than waiting around for about twenty minutes

to drill the glass windows

in the draft board itself.

It was

the consensus of the group

that this should be explored and

checked out.

handY explained that the group 15 interested

in

the deit board conference

room because they are worzzed that

At approximately 7:30 p.a, BOB MILLIAMSON cume in.

At about 8:30, HARDY advised, the groud finished

eating some sandwiches

and shortly thereafter JOHN SWINGLISH

that the members of the entrance team should go and practice

on the

• Ladders at PHIL MURRAY's, located at 312 Friends Avenua,

Camden, N. 3.

The group did go to MURRAY's and practiced on the

At approximately 9:15 MIKE DOYLE came in for about

an hour or so.

When he arrived GRADY asked DOYLE if some of

his priestly friends who said that the group could use sone of

their cars were still up to it. DoYLE said

no, and that they

alt backed out.

At approximately 10:00 p.n. the group went to the

front room of Doctor ANDERSON's apartment facing Broadway

whereupon COOKIE started to explain what the team action would

be once

they ware inside the draft board.

While COOKIE was

explaining the entrance team's duties, RORO REILLY and TERRY

BUCKALEW were sitting up a "card systen" that would indicate

who would be staying whare.

The idea was to

just get the physical lay-out of the room.

GRADY would like

everyone who is going

into the building on the actual sight

of the action to get in there at least once before the action

so that they will be a little bit faniliar wich the floorplan.

At this point PAUL COUMING said that on the after

noon of the night of the "Boston Eight" action he vent into

the draft board and talked to the lady there abour his draft

records,

That night the group went in and destroyed his drai.

recorde and a

week later he surfaced and clained the responsi

bility for this thing.

riaky to go into the drait board; howevar, COUMIGN said that

he was never questioned about it.
