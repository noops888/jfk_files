Regarding telegram alledged sent to Cuba in 1962.

I checked with post-office here and learned that there are

six Cubas in the U.S. and now I'm sure that the telegram

in question was sent to a Cuba here in the U.S. and not to

Havana Cuba or any other place in Cuba.

I therefore must go on record as stating that at no.

time did I ever send a telegram to Havana Cuba or any place

in Cuba.

There is a Cuba in each

of the following states: Alabama

Suhacribson vere identified and in some instancea the cocupation and/or tire

or ousiness

was determined.

Inx raturns of seventy-five of the oue hundred and tuenty Hichigan persons

called wore checked. Corporate returns were not included. Thay failed to

disclose any parsonal trangactions with Earl Ruby. However, some of the

returns disclosed deductions for intercat payments to v. Li. Hudson Company

on charge accounts. Some showed employment by Hudson's; by Farl Ruby and

George Marcus, d/b/a Cobo Clenners; or by firns handling cleaners supplies

or equipment.

The balance primarily disclosed various professional or

skilled oscupations.

Internal Ravenue Agent R. Anstett determined that Cobo Closners has an ex-

clusive contract with..

2. Fudson Cospany, Datroit, Nichigan,

to furnish

custon cloaning services for thair custonars. Hudson's, being one of the

largest department stores in the midwest, furnishes this sorvice to nearly

all of the areas called by Cobo Cleaners.

In view of the Cobo - Hudson business relationship, coupled with the infor-

nation reported on the availebla tak raturns, it appears that the Michigan

calls originating froz Cobo Cleaners were in connection with that business..

In my last report, dated Dacember ll, 1963, I indieated that I would attempt

to detersine the following individuals background and/or rolationship with

Pith the exception of checking the tax filing record of Oscar h. Ruby in

the Detroit district whare no record sas disclosed; I node no request for

any collateral Investigations in this matter.

It is my understanding that

I am rut to initiate any third party Inquiries relutive to this case.

The Hovenber 1963 billing from Cobo Cleaners (UN, 3-0400), discloses that

four telephone calls were made to Dallas, Texas.

The calls originated in

Chicago and were charged to the Cobo Cleaners nuabar.

investigative approach taken

by this special unit and

did it have sufficient leeway

to make a thorough

investigation?

2: Prior to the shooting of

Oswald, Jack Ruby had sent

a money order from the western

Union office only minutes

before. Did the special unit

consider the possibility that

Jack Ruby had utilized the

sending of this money order

to make his entrance to the

shooting of Oswald seem a

fluke coincidence of timing?

Q: (To the extent applicable)

Did the special unit assume

that

for Jack Ruby to have had

assistance in gaining access

to the basement,

someone would

have had to have told him

the exact timing of the transfer,

so that he could send the

money order and still get

into the basement in time to

shoot Oswald?

2: (To the extent applicable)

Did the special unit consider

the possibility that Jack Ruby

received word of the general

timing of the transfer and had

devised a scheme whereby

his arrival at the basement

would result in a message being

sent upstairs to begin the

transfer?

(Focus here is on whether the

special unit considered the

possibility that Ruby's arrival

was the trigger for the transfer

rather than that he only could

Q: If Jack Ruby entered by another

route, what significance, if

any, would you place on the

fact that he said he entered

Dallas Police Headquarte

DeSoto, Texas

Interview: Detective Cody was interviewed in his office (Room

212) at Police Headquarters. He was questioned relative

his friendship with Jack Ruby and he stated that he first met

Ruby in 1951 while a patrolman working on South Ervay Street

in downtown Dallas.

Ruby was the owner of the Silver Spur

and there were numerous altercations on the premises which

called for police action of some type, and during this time

Cody became friendly with Ruby. Cody left the Police Depart-

ment and entered the U.S. Army,

serving in Korea and is south

Texas and Mexico, in Army Intelligence. He returned to the

D.P.D. in 1954 and was assigned to the Detective Division, Nar-

cotics squad. Ruby was very cooperative with the squad, giving

information that resulted in arrests. He continued the friend-

ship with ruby through the years and used to go ice-skating

with him. He used to play hockey too and Ruby was a hocky fan.

Ruby mentioned that he was having trouble with the

Union (AGVA), but he didn't elaborate. Detective Cody stated

that during this period of time he was sure that Ruby did not

have any organized cline

connections

years that he knew Jack, he had had some hard times. The

Club (Silver Slipper) was doing badly and Ruby slept in the

back and cooked there too.

On the day of the assassination (11-22-63) Cody stated

that he was off work, but when he heard about it an the radio

he called in and was directed to the I.S.B.D., and arrived

there about ten or fifteen minutes later, and was present down-

stairs when the rifle was found. He later went to Police Head-

quarters and was there when Lho was brought in for killing

Police Officer Tippett. The officers were bringing him down

the hall (third floor) when he asked LHO his name. When LHO

gave him his name and where he worked, he grabbed him and took

him into Captain Fritz's office and told him that he was

from the TSBD and the one wanted in connection with President

Kennedy's death.

Questioned relative to Ruby's presence on the third

floor, Cody stated that he didn't see Ruby on the third floor

at any time, that he (cody) was there, but that evening at

the first show-up, which was in reality à press conference,

he was one of the Police Officers who brought Iho down to the

basement. When he looked around, Jack Ruby was standing on a

table. Cody asked him what he was doing there and ruby replied

that he was covering the event for the Jewish

Press. All

during the press conference, LiO was denying that he shot any-

one. After 11:00 p.m. that night,. Detective Cody stated that

he was off duty and had flown his plane to Amarillo, Texas

for a scuba-diving contest: that Sunday (11-24-78) when he

heard on the radio that. Jack Ruby had shot LHO. A short time

after Ruby was incarcerated at the Dallas County Jail, Cody

stated that he went to visit Jack and asked him, "why did you

do it, Jack?" He said Ruby replied, "I did it for you guys.

He was a punk (LHO) and wouldn't have served any time in jail

for it."

Questioned further relative to information received

from Ruby, Detective Cody did elaborate on several cases where:

he was called at Headquarters and given information by Ruby,

and he acted on this information, which resulted in arrests.

Ruby was not registered with the D.P.D. as an informant as

far as Detective Cody knew. He just passed information (of a

criminal nature to members of the DPD that he knew.

The investizative teau which you appointed on November 29, 1963,

Security was set up in the basement parking area of the City Hall

at approximately 9 aul. on Sunday, November 24, 1963- (See

attachments)

The basement was searched and guards placed at all entrances.

All unauthorized personnal were removed from the area.

security

personnel and news nedia were then allowed to enter tha basement.

An armored truck was ordered and arrived at the Commerce Street

ranp at approximately 11:00 a.ml. It was backed onto the ramp.

The truck did not hava sufficient clearance to be taken to the

botton of the ramp.

The driver believed the truck might stall

due to the weight if it was placed on the incline. It was then

decided to leava the truck at the top of the Commerce Street

ramp with the rear sheels on the Incline and the front wheels

on the sidewalk of the Commarca Street side of the City Hall.

The Jail Office corridor outside the Jail Office and the ramp

area South of the Southeast comer of the Jail Office was

cleared of everyone except security officers.

Plans wera changed and Lieutenant R. S. Pierce drove a squad

car out of the basemant area and out the Hain Streat ramp. He

was accompanied by Sergeants j. A. Putnam and B. J. Maxey. They

nade a left turn on Main Street, a left turn on Harrood Street

and a left turn on formarce Street.

They here intending to lead

the arnored trick to the County Jail. The armored truck was to

be a decoy and the prisoner was to be transferred in a plain car.

Detective Charles Brown drove a plain car on the Commerce Street

rany toward the arnored truck. Detective C. N. Dhority then drove

another plain car on the ranp behind Detective Charles Brown's car.

Detective C. N. Dhority was in the process of backing the car he

was driving Into position adjacent to the Jail Office entrance,

when the prisoner was brought out of the Jail Office by Detectives

Jo R. Leavelle and I. C. Graves, preceded by Captain J. W. Fritz

and Lieutenant R. E. Swain. They were followed by Detective La Do

Montgonery. The prisoner had taken a few steps toward the car.

Jack Ruby apparently was standing about 10 or 12 feet fron the

Southeast corner of the Jail Office, at the bottom of the Main

Street Pamp near the pipe railing

Ruby lunged forward from a

position between acting Detective W. J. Harrison and Robert S.

Huflakes, Jr., a newnan for KRID-TV. Ruby approached Lee Harvey

Oswald with a revolver extended and fired one shot into Oswald

below the rib cage on the left side.

The shot was fired at approximately 11:20 ali. Ruby was inmed1-

ately arrested. Lee Harvey Oswald expired at Parkland Hospital

at 1:07 p.I..

This grous interrogated 123 persons during the course of this

investigation.

This included 20 patrolmen, 21 reserves, 30

detectives, 19 supervisors, 13 reporters, Il cameramen and 9

civilians.:

Most of the officers were assigned to provide

security and the reporters and cameramen were in the basement

at the time of the transfer.

Only one of the civilians inter-

rogated was in the basement at the time and this was Jack Ruby.

• We have obtained the names. of 10 newsmen that were in the base

ment that we have not been able to interview. We were abls to

deterina there were approximately 10 members of the news media

in the basezens whose identity we have not been able to deter

mine. It is believed these are newspaper corraspondents repro

senting publications from other araas of tha country and even

other countries.

Time and money made the running down of these

people Inadvisable at this tira, particularly since it is not ben

Lieved that any of them could throw additional light on this matter..

Numerous side investigations which grew out of this Investigation

were also nada.

A separate report covering these incidents will

be submitted.

Ruby replied, 'You guys'll never believe this,

but a little girl who works for me had called and

asked that I send her some money to Ft. Worth.

I had left my apartment, gone to Western Union

at liain and the Expressway, and wired her $25.00.

I laft there and noticed the crowd around the

City Hall. I walked up that way, thinking I

might get a chance to see Oswald. As I reached

the ramp that leads to the basement, I noticed

San Pierce pull up from the ramp in a black car.

The officer standing there turned to either

answer a question or say something to Sam. -I

don't know. As he did this, I walked down the

ramp'."

Mr. Forrest Sorrells of the U. S. Secret Service

nas believed to be present at the time this statement

was made to Sergeant Dean.

of Mr. Sorrells that he had entered the base-

Do An introductory card was found in Rubj's auto-

bearer. (In Property Room)

XVIII. Conclusion:

A. This investigative team beljeves that Jack Ruby

entered the Main Street ramp as the car driven by

Lieutenant Rio Pierce was leaving the basement.

Patrolman f. E. Vaughn was the only officer

guarding the Main Street ramp at this time, and he

had stepped into Main Street to halt traffic in

order that Lieutenant Pierca could make a left

turn onto Main Street.

C.

We also feel it should be noted that no officer

interviewed knew the time that Oswald was to be

brought to the basement. The car that was to be

used for the transfer was still in process of

basking into position when Oswald was led from

the Jail Office (Attachments 37 and 77)

in the downtown section on this sunday morning and he knows beyond

any doubt in his mind, that Jack ruby, whom he had known many years

did not walk down Main Street anywhere near that ramp.

Asked why he hasn't mentioned this before, he ad-

vised he did as soon as he found out what had happened. He im-

mediately notified his superior, Lt. Knox. He didn't hear any

more about it until yesterday talking with vaughn who asked him

to mention it to me.

Captain Jack Revill was present during this interview.

I accompanied the Captain and Vaughn to the basement

of this building where the LHO/Ruby scene is located and we

examined the scene carefully.

Close inspection reveals an alley separating the

Police Headquarters building and the next building and the ad-

joining building which ends the block. This last of third building

also houses (and did in 1963) the Western Union office used by

Ruby that Sunday morning. It is quite plausible that ruby - or

anyone else - could walk from the corner building (Western Union)

past the second building, turn left into the alley alongside the

Police Headquarters and enter the Dallas Police Department by

way of a side door, which leads to a stairway directly to the base-

ment area where the shooting took place.

While this possibility doesn't alter any facts, it's

an alternate route which could have been utilized by Ruby. and

would have made a much less conspicuous entry possible.

Interview: Captain Jack Revill was interviewed this date in

his office at Police Headquarters. Captain Revill is in charge

of the of the Internal Affairs Division of the Dallas Police

Department. In 1963 he was a lieutenant and was

assigned to

the Criminal Intelligence Section of the Special Service Bureau

under Captain Gannaway. On November 24, 1963 he was off duty

when Ruby shot Oswald but he was later assigned as part of the

team that investigated the killing of Oswald and how ruby had

gained entrance into the basement. He questioned Roy Vaughn

who was assigned to the ramp entrance and Blackie Harrison.

Both men took polygraph tests and passed. He. comments on Napolian

Daniels, who also took a polygraph but failed it. He believed

Roy Vaughn, who stated he didn't see Ruby enter the basement.

The possibility of Ruby having used the alley entrance to the

building was raised. Captain Revill stated

that he had covered

the ground with Jack Moriarty, and it is possible that Ruby

could have entered through the alleyway door. He further stated

that the door should have been locked but he wasn't aware if

it was or not. But the timing of the walk from the Western

the same. He also mentioned that a friend of Vaughn's,

a Sergeant Flusche, was on Main Street observing the area

and that he knew Jack Ruby and did not see Ruby enter the

basement via the ramp.

Captain Revill was questioned about JURE and at first

he could not recall the name. However, when Sylvia odio's

name was mentioned, he recalled that at

the time (1963) he

was getting information relative to Cuban activities in Dal-

las

from Nestor Castellanos, who was employed at the Hilton

Hotel. The

names of the JURE members were read to Captain

Revill

and he didn't recall having heard of them, but referred

me to Captain Tomlinson, the present head of the Dallas Po-

lice Department Intelligence Unit. He said that the files

from 1963 may have

been purged.

Questioned about Reverend Roy. Rushing, Captain Revill

recalled his name immediately but wasn't too familiar with

what was said in 1963 to the Warren Commission about Reverend

Rushing.

Revill was given a xeroxed copy of his statement, read

it and stated that

to the best of his recollection, the in-

formation is the same. He then gave me a business card which

was

given to him a couple of months ago by Reverend Rushing.

Captain Revill believes that Reverend Rushing is a con man.

Austin, Texas

Interview: MI. Gannaway was interviewed by Staff Investigator

Joseph J. Basteri in his office at 411 West 13th Street, Austin,

Texas.

Mr. Gannaway is presently employed by the State of

Texas as the Planning Commissioner for their Criminal Justice

System.

He has been employed in this capacity since his retire-

ment from the Dallas Police Department on July 1, 1971. He en-

tered the department on June 10, 1937 as a police officer and

rose to the rank of Captain.

Gannaway very willingly discussed the conditions that

existed in Dallas during the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's. He

stated that in the early 40's a group from Chicago attempted to

penetrate the criminal scene in Dallas but they failed. Of this

group, he could only recall the names of Paul Labriolla, Mark

Lipsky, Marty ochs and Weinberg. This group, according to Mr.

Gannaway, were big time hoods with good connections. In short

time the District Attorney's office and the police department

began to arrest many of them. Sheriff Decker had rounded up a

group and drove them to the edge of town jith instructions for

them not to return. These criminals soon got the message

and they all fled Dallas.

About the time that this group at-

tempted to move into Dallas, Herbert Nolan was killed by a

planted bomb and Benny Binion fled Dallas. MI. Gannaway re-

marked that rumors around town were that Binion had put out

the contract and then fled. Mr. Gannaway stated that this was

not so, the reason Binion left Dallas was that this mob moved

in and Binion did not wish to oppose them. Although Ruby was:

in Dallas during this period, he was in no way attached to

this group. In fact, Gannaway stated that they would not even

speak to him.

After this group was chased out of Dallas, Paul Roland

Jones entered änd amateurly attempted to bribe Sheriff Guthrie

GANAWAY

in a vain effort to take over Dallas. Sawyer said that Jones

was in no way connected with this former group and definitely did

not put Jones in the same league. He classified Paul Roland

Jones and his associates as small time opportunists that had

no mob connections.

Gannaway stated that he could speak very knowledgeably

of events during this period as he was, as the Captain, in charge

of the Special Service Bureau which included the Vice Squad,

Narcotics Bureau, and the Intelligence, which supervised the

subversive

and radical groups. Gannaway stated that although

Dallas was a clean city he did not wish to imply that dallas

was completely free of any criminal activity. Gannaway explained

NW 66000 Docld:32267370 Page 65

---

## Page 66

Interview with w. P. Gannaway

Page 3.

that Dallas did have its share of gambling and bookmaking

action, and as such there had to be some sort of organiza-

tion. This organization was in no way similar to the family

type organization that exists in the east. In bookmaking, ex-

plained Gannaway, there would have to be some sort of national

syndicate influence to set the morning line and the spread

on any sportsaction. This was controlled by their own home-

grown criminals. Gannaway attributed the control of this gam-

bling operation to Joe Civello. Gannaway emphasized that there

was no question that Civello was the Don in Dallas as these

gamblers all bowed to him. Gannaway pointed out a man named

Joe Ianni as heading Civello's gambling operation. Carlos

T.

Marcello had on occasion visited with Joe Civello in Dallas.

Gannaway recalls that after the Appalacian Meeting, which Joe

Civello attended, upon his return to Dallas, Chief Hanson called

Civello into his office to explain his presence at that meeting.

Civello denied all knowledge of this affair. Chief Hanson dis-

missed the matter with a stern warning to Civello that the City

of Dallas did not appreciate this kind of element.

Gannaway places. Joe Campisi in the Civello camp.

He

termed Campisi as a small-time operator with only enough courage

to do small-time bookmaking. Gannaway terms Campisi as a per-

son who is afraid to be caught so consequently takes very little

risks in his gambling operation. Gannaway recollects a man

named Bosco had been arrested in a $500,000 bookmaking opera-

NW 66000 Docld:32267370 Page 66

tion. This was a lay-off parlor for all the bookies in the

Dallas area. During the surveillance of these premises, it

was noted that Joe lanni would pay frequent visits and that

Joe Campisi would visit it on occasions.

Gannaway pointed out that Joe Campisi had purchased

the Egyptian Lounge from John Brazil Grissaffi. He describes

Grissaffi as having the reputation of being

a very tough indi-

vidual and a "hit man.". He puts Grissaffi as a running mate of

Lois Green, who ran a loose-knit gang of criminals whose

main

objectives were burglaries of wholesale drug companies in order

to steal drugs. Gannaway states that this period was during

the war years where all shipping lanes were closed

to the drug

traffic. Consequently to fill up this void, Green and his mem-

bers would either hijack or burglarize these drug companies in

order to replenish the much-needed drugs. Eventually Dallas be-

came to be known as the hub of the drug traffic. The Green gang

was not as refined or organized as the Mafia

gang: Green would

supply needed money to a certain group in order that they could

engage in this sort of activity: In return, Lois Green would

receive a considerable share of their proceeds.

Within the

Green gang, he would have his own selected men to carry out any

necessary enforcement. Lois Green was later killed as he came

out of a nightclub with Jack Todd. Gannaway stated that al-

though Todd and Green were close friends, he always suspected

Todd of setting up Green. Gannaway mentioned that Jack Toda

was a known safe cracker and he once locked him up for carry-

ing explosives as he was boarding a plane for New York. He

believes the type of explosives was nitro and the purpose was

either to blow up a safe in New York or to wire the explosives

to. an auto. Gannaway received this information through an in-

formant. To his knowledge, Gannaway does not believe Ruby and

Green were associated in any way. In fact,

eiTe

As the Commander of the Special Service Bureau, Gann-

away had first-hand information on all subversive and radical

individuals in the area. Intelligence reports would daily cross

his desk concerning these persons and he would always assign

men to check out these leads. Gannaway recalls that Agent

3I-DPD

Hosty of the FBI would make daily visits to his office and Gann-

I away would supply him with all this information. Gannaway ex-

plained that Hosty's assignment with the FBI was to supervise

subversive activities. Gannaway was. very proud of how his unit

had penetrated most of these groups. In fact, when he heard of

the President's visit he had dispatched men to Denton, Denis,

Waco and other areas to keep a closer watch of

radicals in

these towns. Gannaway, informed me that he was never told about

Lee. Harvey Oswald and was not aware of his existence prior to

the assassination. Gannaway stressed that more than certain

he would have had one of his men cover Lee Harvey Oswald had he

known of his presence in Dallas.

Date 5-26-78

Time 1: 30 p.

Address 4018 Ridglea Country Club Drivelace Office - Benbrook Police

Department

Fort Worth, Texas

Interview: Staff Investigator Joseph J. Basteri interviewed Mr.

Gilmore, who is now Chief of Police for the Benbrook Police Depart-

ment since his retirement from the Dallas Police Department. Ben-

brook is a town of approximately 15,000 residents and is located

just outside Fort Worth.

Chief Gilmore said that he knew Ruby quite well because

from the years 1954 to 1960 he was with the Vice Squad and as

such his duties were to pay frequent visits to dance halls and

- night clubs.. Gilmore entered the Vice Squad when he was promoted

to Lieutenant. Gilmore was familar with all of Ruby's clubs

and never knew.

them to be a hangout for hoods. Gilmore credited

Ruby with running a fairly legitimate night spot, abiding by all

the police department regulations. If any violations were ob-

served,

Ruby would be issued a summons like anyone else commit-

ting a violation.

These places were visited at least once a

night to make certain that there were no violations of the rules.

One point that Chief Gilmore wanted to emphasize

was that Ruby was not a constant visitor to police headquarters

as the papers had reported. Chief Gilmore stated Ruby only

visited headquarters in order to take care of business matters

and for no other reasons.

Chief Gilmore did state that Ruby had once told him

that he was run out of Chicago because he had crossed

someone

up and had

twenty-four hours to leave town. Ruby did not ela-

borate on too many details but Gilmore surmised that he may

have been in some kind of bar business and he had done some-

thing wrong.. Gilmore did not believe that Ruby was connected

with any mob characters in the Dallas area. According to Gil-

more, the only gang members were Dallas-bred and no one from

the outside ever penetrated this group. Gilmore agrees that

the most notorious group was the Lois Green gang and Ruby

had positively no connection with them.

On November 24, 1963 Gilmore stated he was not on

duty but home watching the television and saw. Ruby shoot Os-

wald. Gilmore remarked that earlier he had seen Ruby in the

station house and when asked what he was doing there, Ruby Ie-

plied that he was going to see if the homicide detectives wanted

any sandwiches. Gilmore declared that he had nothing to do

with the transfer of Oswald. but heard that Captain Fritz wanted

the move to be made in the middle of the night but was opposed

by Mayor Cabell who wanted the transfer to take place in the

morning hours to please the press corps. Also, Captain Fritz

had once told Gilmore that if he did not have so many interrup-

tions he may have been more

successful in the interrogation of

LHO.

When

asked about the rumors that Ruby was afraid

of him, Gilmore replied that most of the night club owners.

did not care how strict he was in his inspection of their pre-

mises. Chief Gilmore explained that when he paid these es-

tablishments a visit, it was not a social call but to care-

fully examine their premises

for any violation. At times,

these owners objected, as they did not want him to pay too much

attention to their operation. He is also certain that several

arrests were made in Ruby's clubs and clearly remembers as a

police officer he had given Ruby

a ticket for a traffic in-

fraction. Gilmore remarked that even Joe Campisi complained

that he was too strict.

The interview ended with Chief Gilmore promising to

contact me if he can recall any incident that may be useful in

this investigation.

S. Pierce who entered the

Dallas Police Department in 1946 and re-

tired January 8, 1974. He is now employed part-time with the De-

partment of Agriculture.

MI. Pierce was a member of the Uniform Patrol Division

and on Sunday, November 24, 1963 was working from 7AM to 3PM. He

held the rank of Lieutenant and on that day supervised 8 to 10 men

and: 2 sergeants detailed to the basement and adjoining rooms. Mr.

Pierce then stated that he was then assigned the responsibility to

escort the armored truck out of the basement., Pierce explained that

there were two ramps in and out of the basement. The wain ramo was

the exit. The armored truck, which was going to be used as a decoy,

backed into Commerce Street, but because of its height could not

back completely into the basement causing the ramp to be blocked.

Pierce stated that he then decided to exit the Main Street ramp so

that he could get out and then back his car into the Commerce Street

ramp and place it in position in front of the armored truck. He

then proceeded to exit the Main Street ramp and in doing so he

notieed. O. vaughn, whe was stationed at this ramp, taking

one of two steps off the sidewalk

and into the street to safely

direct him out into the traffic. Pierce, who was with two other

members of the force did notice several persons standing

at the

entrance of the ramp, but did not know if they werenaiting

there or just walking by and waiting for his car to pass them

so that they could continue to walk. Pierce stated he knew Ruby

and Napoleon Daniels, but did not see them. In fact, Pierce

remarked that he was not aware of who was standing at the

entrance because his concentration was to maneuver his vehicle

in front of the armored truck:

Pierce does recall Vaughn being

in the gutter and he was either motioning his hands of blowing

his whistle to stop the traffic in order for him to get out of

the ramp. After leaving the ramp, he drove to Harwood Street and

made a left to Commerce Street where he made another left turn.

Pierce then said that as he arrived at Commerce Street ramp, he

does not recall whether he parked the vehicle at the curb of backe

it into the Commerce Street ramp, but at about this time, they

were aware that something had happened inside the basement. They

immediately ran into

the basement. and leared what had happened.

After LHO had been taken to Parkland Hospital, Pierce decided

also to go there as a precaution for security

reasons. He was

not ordered to go there, but took the action as a supervisor.

He does not recall entering the hospital.

Pierce admits knowing Ruby from the late forties or

early fifties as the Silver Spur was on his post.

He described

Ruby as wanting to know people of influence, even if it was.

only a casual meeting. Pierce said that he would never be

afraid to go into any one of Ruby's places without a nightstick

or gun as ruby ran a place where one could not get hurt.

Pierce

did say that he would not trust ruby and always had the feeling

that he had something. to do with mob people, but could not prove

it. Pierce said he had the feeling that. Ruby did something wrong

to some Chicago bad guys and had to flee to Dallas. He denied that

Ruby had told him this, merely stating he just had that feeling.

Pierce believes that Dallas had no organized crime that had

eastern and northern influence. Pierce did state that Dallas did

have a criminal element, but he was never in a position to deter-

mine how organized they were. He stated that he was always as-

signed to the Uniform Patrol Division which made it very difficult

for him to make his own observations concerning the organization

of these groups. Pierce did say that from his own knowledge, he

did not believe Ruby was linked with these criminal elements.

Dallas, Texas

Interview: Mr. Sawyer was interviewed by Staff Investigator

Joseph J. Basteri at his

restaurant, Jan's Coffee Shop, located

at 3254 Irving Boulevard, Dallas, Texas. He has owned and operated

this restaurant since his retirement from the Dallas Police Depart-

ment in 1967. Sawyer recalls that on November 22, 1963, he was

assigned to be in charge of a detail of men on the upper portion

of the Presidential Motorcade. A few minutes after the President

had passed him, he heard over the radio that shots were fired from

the Texas School Book Depository. Sawyer, who held the rank of

Inspector, immediately rushed to this building and had it secured.

He then organized a group of law-enforcement officers from the

Dallas Police Department, FBI, Secret Service and the Sheriff's

Office instructing them to find witnesses and possible suspects.

These witnesses were brought to the Sheriff's office where affi-

davits were taken: Sawyer had also sent a team to search the rail-

road yards as there were reports that shots may have come from

that direction and also it was good investigative procedure to

cover all surrounding areas. He recalls his men finding the three

in a box car. Sawyer did not personally interrogate these

men, but said that they did look. like hobos. Sawyer did remark

that a few years ago a writer had called him challenging several

details of a photo he saw of the police officer escorting the

three hobos. The writer was puzzled as to the type of shoes, gun

and a hearing device the police

officer had. Sawyer's answer to

the writer was that the hearing device was in fact cotton for an

ear infection the police officer had. This fact was documented

by. Staff Investigator Harold Rose. The only requirement the DPD

makes as to shoes is that they must be black and this officer was

wearing black shoes. Lastly, DPD requires only that officers must

be armed with a 38 calibre or more gun. This officer was armed.

with a 45 automatic which is not an uncommon weapon for Dallas

police officers. This police officer was later identified

i as

Marvin Wise.

Although Sawyer was picked to head the unit investi-

gating the operational security

involving the transfer of Lee

Harvey Oswald, he had very little to do with it as he was hospi-

talized a week after it was formed. Sawyer did state that he was

kept well apprised of the progress of the investigation and did

assist Captain Baker who prepared the final report on the conclusion

of the investigation. Sawyer had received periodic information

from his men and after reading all reports submitted concerning

the investigation, he was positive that the shooting of Lee Harvey

oswald by Jack ruby was not planned because of the following

reasons:

against traffic, causing Police Officer Roy Vaughn to

leave his post momentarily enabling Ruby to enter the

basement through the unguarded ramp.

Ruby had entered the basement at almost the precise

moment that Oswald was brought down. According to

Sawyer, there was no way that Ruby could have timed

this so perfectly: as no one knew the exact time Oswald

would be brought down. Sawyer stated that to his

knowledge no one had objected to this unit being

formed and it was terminated only after the investiga-

tion had been fully completed.

As a Lieutenant, Sawyer was in charge of the Vice

squad and as such came to know Ruby quite well. He had heard

rumors that Ruby was connected with mob figures while in Chicago,

but nothing has ever come to his attention to prove this runor-

Sawyer had, also heard that Ruby had to leave Chicago because of a

dispute he had with the Chicago mob. Sawyer further stated that.

he was not aware that any organized criminal element exerted any

strong influence in the city of dallas. The only group, to his

knowledge, that could be loosely classified as organized crime

was. the Lois Green outfit. Dallas, continued Sawyer, was rela-

tively a clean town with the minimum of crime or corruption.

Sawyer admits that in the late thirties and in the early forties

Dallas had more than its share of slot machines, bookie parlors,

gambling establishments and a certain part of the city was desig-

nated as the "red light district."

With the advent of World War Iwo, Dallas was deemed

off limits by the armed services until the city fathers could

clean up the city. Carl Hanson was appointed Chief of Police

and he formed a Special Service Bureau to clean up the vice,

narcotics

and gambling that was flourishing in the city. George

Lumpkin was the captain in charge of this unit. Sawyer was a

lieutenant in heading the vice squad under Lumpkin. During this

clean-up campaign, which took several years to fully clean up

Dallas, Sawyer stated that in no way was. Ruby's name ever linked

with this criminal element. Sawyer attributed the control of

gambling, in the forties, in the control of Benny Binion, Harry

Urban and Lloyd Sinclair.. Lois Green and his group were known

to concentrate mostly on

safe jobs, narcotics and prostitution.

They would frequently meet in the office of Harry Hoxsey, and Sawyer

always suspected that these meetings were to discuss

narcotics

and fencing stolen property.

Sawyer had informed me that he had set up the In-

telligence Unit for the Dallas Police Department and also insti-

tuted a filing system to properly record all pertinent facts.

One of the

functions of this office was to arrange a system where

police officers would not list their informants by name, but

numbers would be assigned to the informant....It was against a

police officer's principle to reveal the name of his informant as

such. Sawyer stated that it would be difficult to say if Ruby had

been an informant as there would be no official record of it.

Sawyer said he had heard that Ruby had passed on information to var-

ious police officers, but the information received was of little

importance.

Sawyer remarked that Ruby had come to Dallas in

the late forties and during this period the clean-up of dallas was

almost complete. Ruby's name never came up at any time with regard

to Ruby's having ever been connected or associated with these crim-

inal figures. Sawyer always considered Ruby as a small time night

club operator who would have loved to have persons think he was more

important than he was. Ruby's places, as well as other night spots,

were well supervised by the vice-squad, and it never came to his

attention that Ruby had made bribe payments to any Dallas police

officer.

LHO was escorted off the elevator at the basement level and

inner doorway. He watched IHO proceed into the strong array of

lights and saw a man emerge from the line of detectives on LHO's

"Oh, no!" -- and the shot was fired as LHO

looked directly at the assailant who he (Archer) thought must have

been a plainclothes policeman. ("We all wore hats in those days.")

MITMORANDLEA

1O:

Ht. Howard P, Millens

FROM:

Mr. Leon D. Hubert

Mr. Burt ". GrIffin

SUBJECT: Author Telephone Records to be Obtained for the commission.

In furtherance of your conversation with ir. Griffin on February

20th and our joint memorandun of February 19, the followirg steps are

suggested to be taben as soon as possible for obtaining and preserving

telephone reoords which nay be pertinent to the work of this Countssion.

Some of the suggestions nay Imposa burdens upon private parties

which are not justified by the possible results to be obtained. If so,

they should be rejected and the reason for such rejection recorded in

order to assure future critios that such efforts vere carefully can-

sidered.

Paragraphs one, tro and three seek telephone numbers of phones

"reasonably available" to Ruby plus records of calls placed fron phones

under Ruby's direct control.

Paragraph four seels telephone numbers of all phonea reasonably

available to certain persons.

Paragraph five neels only phones. listed to of under the control

of certain people.

Paragraph six to ten are designed to lay a basis for further

Investigation.

1. The FBI should irmediately obtain the telephone numbers, names

o1 subscriber, location and type of service of all phones reasonably

avallable to Jack Faby. "Reasonably available" should include, but not

be linited to, aubscriber and pay telephones at the 1l1 fight Parking

Gurage,

Adolphus Hotel, the Esptian Lounge, Phil's Delicatessen,

Cabana biotel, Sol's Turf Bar, Dallas City Hall and Jail, Dallas Morning

News, Radio Station KLIF, together with ary pay phones within reasorable

walking distance of said places or any other places which ruby frequented.

Nunvers and infornation concerning phones "reasonably available" to faily

In Dallas may be obtained by personal contact with subscribers ur the

telephone company... Information as to phones avallable outside Dallas

should not involve contact with non-residents of Dallas.

2. The FBI should immediately obtain with respect to Jack Ruby,

for the period lugust 1 to November 25, 1963, coples at all original

telephone company records bearing upon the dates, time, length of call,

calling number, billing number, person calling and number called with

respect to all telephone callo (including local calls) utilizing any

telephone listed to Jack Ruby or any of his Clubs, Including pay phones

on or near the premises. If the telephone company has no records which

sould provide Information concerning local calls, the FBI should so

state.

It 19 unnecessary at thia point to obtain call racorde fron all

phones

"reasonably available to Bulby" sinoe analysis of calls fron such

phones would be impossiblo without further Infornation. However, we

contemplate that: 1f we establish a list of suspected intermediaries

betreen Puby and Oswald, It sould be valuable to cheel: telephones

"avallable" to Ruby against calls to the "Intermodiaries".

In addition,

it may be valusble to exanine recordo of telephones llated to or used

regularly by suspected "intermediaries" for calls to phones "available"

to ruby.

3.

With respect to all records requested in paragraph tro, the

FBI should indicate in 1t8 report what telephone company personnel vere

questioned, the questions asked and the answers received, In all investi-

Eations which vere conducted, so that It may be determined that the

recorda obtained are camplete and accurate.

We believe that the method

of searching for records must be detailed since telephone Information

forwarded so far has been spotty and inaccurate.

hi, To the extent not already provided, the FBI should be requested

to obtain for the Commisaion a l1st of all telephones (but sot call

records) reasonably available to the fallowing persons since March 1, 1263:

ceivable, for cramlo, that connecting or trunk-line telephone sorriers

aay be that most telephona companies la largo cities are not so fully

autonated that mich Information 1s contalned on their Ild cards and tbese

Ill carde could be run through a computer or otber derice for every

telephose subscriber la the aroa so that such information could bo derived

mechanically ultut undue expense or personal effort. Infomation as to

conceivably be veningi in light of other data which fe nave.

•7. The FBI should cosier with telephone compary afficials ai eech

company surving Juak Ruby and the persons listod In paragraph four and

fivo. to asoertain li that compary has any means of providing inioration,

concerning local calls to or froz the phones of those persons.. Even ir

no rocords are maintained by such compandes in the ardinary course of

visiness, 1t may be that cortain electronis, nachanical or other entries

are routinely inde either by talephone tronamitting equiment or in

connection with business records ordinarily maintained by the telephone

company ao that by careful examination of such dada information con-

ceming local telephone actirity on a particular telaptone could be

obtained. To thaterer extont Information can be obtained concerning

local telephone acuivity, the Agent should report to the Camission the

nature of the infamation thich can be obtained and the means by shiah

1t. would be ostained.

This date should be accured without mentioning

purticular nares or telephone mmbers.

Connecticut and New Jersay

Mlami, Florida

Washington, D. C. and adjacent suburbs

Mr. Bunkin should sadress s letter to the Giller Executive ef

each of the telephone scupanies mentioned in paragraph eight requesting

that such companies not destroy until June 1, 1904 ay records they

may have with respect to telephone service of all subscribers. The

lotter should request that the source of this policy not be disclosed.

Retention of records on a blanket basis would proserve security as to

the thinking of the Coumlasion and will afford the maxirm ascurance that

telephone records will be preserved with respeat to persons not yet suspect.

We realize that blanket retention may be so burdensome on expensive as to

make our request seen unressonable, I there is any suggestion along these

Ines, a confarence to fork out a reasonable system should da suggested.

10. As soon as possible arter the Ruby trial and after consultotion

with the Commission, the FBI should obtain coples of original telephone

records uncovered as a result of the Investigations requested in paragraphs

four and five. These recorde should be analyzed to determine possible

links to ruby or Osmala.

Tereafter, if deoned advisable, records of

phones "r'easonably available" to Ruby would be analyzed for possible

calls to phones "reasonably available to suspected Intermediaries between

Ruby ard Oswald.

Adequacy of Ruby Investigation

F-541

1.

Past Recommendations.

In memoranda data February 19,

February 24, Fabruary 2l, and narch 11, we made various

susgestions for extending the Investigation Iniularea by the

FBI In connection ulth the Oswald homicide. Shortly arter

March 11, 1964, ve began preparation for the nearly 60.

depositions taken in Dallas during the perlod March 21-April 2;

after ve retumed from Dallas ne took the deposition of C. L.

Oraiard (two days) and George Senator (tro days), woriced on.

editing the depositions taken In Dallas, and prepared for

another series of 30 other depositions taken 111 Dallas during

the period April 13-17. On our retum from Dallas ve con-

tinued the editing of tha Dallas depositions, prepared the

Dallis deposition

exhibits for publication,

and began worlding

on a drait of the report 1n Arca V. As a conseguence of all of

this activity during the period March 1l-May 13, ve did not

press for the conferences and discussions referred to in the

attached memoranda.

The following represents

jur vicw at this

time with respect to appropriate further investigation.

2.

General Statement si Areas Not Acequately Investigated.

In reporting on the murder of lee oswald by Jack huby, we

must unster of it least advert to these questions:

a) Why did fuby k1l1 Oswala;

b) Was Ruby associated with the assassin of

President Kennedy;

c) Did Ruby have any confederates In the murder

of Oswald?

It 1s our belicf that, although the evidence gathered so far

does not show a conspiratorial link between Ruby and Oswald,

or between ruby and others, nevertheless evidence should be

secured, 1f possible, to sillimatively exclude that:

NW 66000 Docld:32267370 Page 106

## Page 107

loit

2:

a)

ruby was Indirectly linked through others

to Oswald;

b) Fuby killed Oswald, because of fear; or.

c) Ruby killed Oswald at the suggestion of others.

3. Summary of Evidence suggesting further Investigation..

The following facts suggest the necessity of further investi-

gation:

Ruby had time to engage in substantial activitles

Fuby's night club

business usually occupied no more than five hours of a normal

working day which began at about 10:00 all. and ended at

2:00 a I. It was his practice to spend an average of only

one hour a day at his Clubs between 10:00 a.m. and 9:00 p..

Our depositions were confined primarily to persons familiar

with Ruby's Club activities.

The FBI has thoroughly Investl-

gated Ruby's night clus operations but does not seem to have

pinned down his other business or social activities.

basic materials do make reference to such other activities

(see p. 27 of our report of february 18), but these are casual

and collateral and were not explored to determine whether they

involved any underlying sinister purpose. Nor were they probed.

In such a menner as to permit a determination as to how much of

Ruby's time they occupied.

b. Ruby has always been a person who looked for

money-mating "sidelines.

In the two months prior to

Novenber 22, Ruby supposedly spent considerable time promoting

an exercise device known as a

"twist board."

The "twist

board" was purportedly manufactured by Plastellite Ingineering,.

a Fort Horth manufacturer of oil field equipment which has

poor credit references and was the subject of an FBI investi-

gation in 1952.

we know of no sales of this item by ruby;

nor do ve inow

1f any "trist boards" were manufactured for

sale.

The possibility remains that the "twist board" was a

front for some other illegal enterprise..

c. Ruby has long been close to persons pursuina

port

11lezal activities.

Al though Ruby had no lanown ideological or #2

political interests (see p. 35 of our report of February 18),

there is nuch evidence that he was interested In Cuben matters.

In early 1959, Ruby Inquired conceming the smuggling of

persons out of Cuba. He has admitted that, at that time, he

negotiated for the sale of jeeps to Castro.

In September 1959,

Ruby visited Havana at the Invitation of Las Vegas racketeer,

Iouls J. Mciallie, who pald Ruby's expenses for the trip and

uno was later expelled from Cuba by Castro....

described by Ralph Paul, Ruby's business partner.

as one of

nor's closest friends.

Ruby mailed a gun to Mcwillle in early.

1963.

In 1951, 1t 1s reported that Ruby attended three meetings

In Dallas in connection with the sale of arms to Cubans and

the sauggling out of refugees.

The Informant Identifies an

Ed Srunner as Ruby's assoclate in this endeavor. Shortly after.

his arrest on November 24, Ruby named Fred Bruner as one of

his expected aitomeys. Brunner did not represent Ruby,

however. Insufficient Investigation has been conducied

confim or deny the report about Icetings in 1961.

When Henry

Hade announced to the Press on November 22, 1953 that Oswald

was a nenber of the Free Cuba Committee, Ruby corrected Wade

by stating "Not the free cuba Comittee; The falt Play for

Cuba Committee.

there is a difference.

The Free Cuba Com-

nittee 1s an existing anti-Castro organization. Earl ruby,

brother of Jack Ruby, sent an inezplained telegram to Havana

1n April 1962. We belleve that a reasonable possibility exists

that ruby has maintained a close interest In Guban affcirs to

the extent necessam to participate in gun sales or smuggling

d.

Bits oi evidence link Ruby to others who may have

been interested in Cuban affairs. When Ruby's car was seized

on November 24, It contained various sight-uing radie scripts

issued by te I. Funt and a cory of the Wall Street Journal

bearing the malling address of a man who has not yet been

identified. In May 1963, Earl Ruby, operator of a dry cleaning

business, is known to have telephoned the Welch Candy Company

(owned by the founder of John Birch Society). The purpose of

the call 1s unimown. Jack Ruby's personal notebook contained

the Massachusetts telephone number and address of Thomas H111,

former Dallas resident, worldng at the Boston headquarters of

the juhn Birch Society. Although 1t 1s most Ilkely that all of

those bits of circunstanttal evidence have innocent explana.

tions, none has jet been explained.

Although Ruby did not witness the motorcade through

Dallas, he may have had a prior interest in the President's

visit.

A November 20 edition of the Fort Worth Telegram showing

the President's proposed route through fort Worth, and the

November 20 edition of the Dallas Morning News showing the

President's route through Dallas, were found in Ruby's car on

November 24.

£. On November 15 Jack Ruby met at the Carousel Club

with Bertha Cheek, sister of Hrs. Earlene Roberts, manager of

Lee oswald's rooming house. Hrs. Cheek said that she and Ruby

discussed her lending Ruby money to open a new night cluò..

Ruby was not questioned about this natter.

in San Antonio has not been cheated out..

In addition,

the

Iink formed by firs. Roberts between Oswald and Ruby 13

buttressed in some measure by the fact that one of Ruby's

strippers dated a tenant of the Beckley Street rooming house

during the tenancy of Lee Oswald.

the theory that Ruby and airs. Cheek could have been Involved

in Cuban arms sales of which Oswald gained Inowledge through

his efforts to Intiltrate the anti-Castro Cubans.

Our doubts

concerning the real Interest of Mrs. Cheek in Jack Ruby stem

from the fact that one of her four husbands was a convicted

felon and one of her friends was a police officer who married

one of Ruby's strip-tease dancers.

We have suggested that

Fuby sight have killed Oswald out of fear that Oswald might

implicate Ruby and his friends falsely or not in an effort topolls y

Ruby was visited in Dallas from

Novenber 21 to November 24, 1903 by Lawrence Meyers of Chicago.

Meyers had visited Ruby tro reeks previously.

Ruby aiso made

a long distance call shortly after the President's death to

Alex Gruber in los Angeles. uruber had visited Ruby about

the same time as Meyers in early November. Eoth Gruber and

Heyers give innocent explanations.

Meyers claims he was 1n

Dallas enjoying life with a "aunb but accommodating broad."

Gruber clains Ruby called to say he would not nall a dog that

day, as he had promised to do. Finally between 11:35 p.m.

and 12 uldnight, Saturday, November 23, Ruby nade a series

of brief long distance phone calls culminating with a call to

we suggest that these matters cannot be left

"hanging in the air.

They must either be explored further

or a firm decision must be made not to do so supported by

stated reasons for the decision. As a general matter, ye

think the investigation deficient in these respects:

(1) Substantial tine-segments In Fuby's daily

routine from September 25 to November 22 have

not been accounted for.

(2) About 45 persons who saw Ruby from November 22

to November 24 have not been questioned by staff

members, although there are FBI reports of

Interviews with all these people.

(3) Persons who have been interviewed because pi

lown associations with Ruby generally have

not been investigated themselves so that their

truthiulness can be evaluated.

The FBI reports

speciflcally do not attemot evaluation. The

exception has been that there the FBI has been

given incriminating evidence against Ruby, 1t

has made further investigation to determine

whether others might also be Implicated with

Fuby. In every case where there was some

evidence implicating others, those other persons.

were interviewed and denied

the incriminating

allegations. Further Investigation has not been

uncertaken to resolve the conflicts.

(4)

much of our mowledge of Ruby comes from his

friends Andrew Armstrong, Ralph Paul, George

and Larry Craiard. Investigations

have not been undertaken to conreborate ther

claims..

4. Specific Investigative Recommendations

We should obtain photos of all property found on

Ruby's person, in his car, or at his home or clubs, now in.

possession of the Dallas District Attorney. We already have

photos of Ruby's address books, but no other ltes have been

photographed or delivered to the Commission. These items Include-

the H. I. Hunt literature and newspapers nontioned in para-

graphs 3d and 3e.

and managed the Vegas Club for Jack in Dallas from 1959 50

1963. Earl was a travelling salesman with Jack from 1941-1943;

a business partner 1940-1947, and made phone calls before

Io obtain personal history to

Crafard to be a homoseXual, claims not to have

SUBJBCT: Adequacy of Ruby Investigation:

As we'all know, your senorandur dated May I, 195,

bearing the above title has been the subject of considerable

discussion anon the tiro of you, fir. Bankin, kir. Redlich and

me.

As a rceult of those discussions steps have bean taken

to implement nost oi the specific investigative recommendations

set forth in rection 4 beginning on page 4. In fact, It eppears

to me thai all of these requests are in the process of being

implenented througn subsection y vi entitled Breck Wall, with

the exception that no background Investigation has been requested

regarding tir. Hall. As to the recommendation in subsection & vil

that background investigation be conducted regarding the six nuned

persons, it has been decided that no such general. Investigation is

werranted. It was agreed, however, that any luvestigative requerts

submitted by you regarding specific testimony of these persons, in

order to test veraclty, ulght be approprlate.

On Hey 27, 1964 I alscussed vith Me. Griffin the status

of the investigation in Area 5. Inis discussion was prompted not

only by your memorandur dated May It, but aloo the discussion held

in tir. Rankin's office on the prior day, May 20, dealing with the

initial drait subaltted by you relating to Ruby's background.

I requested Mr. Griffin to stop his current work on the first draft

and subalt to me within the next few business days every single

Investigative raquest which he believes is necessary to complate

the investigation in his arca. Mr. Griffin ogreen to this and I

have today received approxinately 10 such Investigative requests,

which have elüber been sent forward to Mr. Runkin for approval. and

signature or, atter discussion with Mr. Griffin, are being revised.

If any additlonal requests are contemalated, I would like to be
