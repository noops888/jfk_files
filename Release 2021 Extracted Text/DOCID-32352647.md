•THE DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE

WASHINGTON, D. C. 20505

Office of Legislative Counsel

19 March 1979

Mr. G. Robert Blakey

Chief Counsel and Director

Select Committee on Assassinations

House of Representatives

Washington, D.C.

Dear Bob:

Herewith are comments on the Nosenko draft.

In commencing, it should be noted that Tennent Bagley remains

under cover, retired abroad. We are obliged to honor that cover,

which he has not moved to have modified.

To expose his true

status as a former CIA employee could have repercussions in his

present situation that we must accept as significant. When he

was here in November 1978, he was advised of steps necessary

to remove his cover, in the event he decided to go overt in this

matter; he took no steps to alter his cover status. It remains

classified. We therefore request that the example set in the

Hart testimony, of referring to Mr. Bagley by the title of Deputy

Chief, SB Division, be followed in this draft.

Following are detailed comments:

NOSENKO

Testimony of Nosenko

Circled Page 3, lines 14 and 17, depending on how one counts.

KGB agents should read KGB officers.

Circled Page 4, lines 3 through 20. Suggest the following

rewrite:

NW 65924 Docld:32352647 Page 2

information about the KGB that was outdated.

Circled Page 6. Nosenko's actual testimony, last response. Suggest

changing word "defectionist" to "defector."

Page 6, line 6. Delete "woman in Utah" and insert "individual."

Page 6, lines 20 and 21. Delete "and even was a co-op from CIA." C

I understand from your conversation with Rodger that you would

welcome a letter from the Agency, on this section of the report,

for inclusion with it in the final report. Could we have more

details?

It is understood that this is the last paper we will see that has

not already been reviewed. As you know, we are ready to follow up

in a meeting with you on the substantive comments already provided

you.

Very truly yours,
