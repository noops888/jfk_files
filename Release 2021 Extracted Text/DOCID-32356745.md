Subject: W.L. OLTHANS (10 June 1925)

On 29 December 1371 OLMINS invited the Cultural Attache of the

Russian Embassy KUZNETSOV for an

ation was also for some other members of the Russian

Representation.

At the same time OLTMANS was to invite some six important journalist

KUZNETSOV should ask OPALEV and IZWEKOV to come along with him.

The date agreed on originally was 11 January 1972. It then was

changed twice. When 14 January also wasn't suitable, it was agreed

on 7 January

â€¢ to make

the date for 18 January 1972 at 20.00 hrs.

From

the

invitation it could only be infered that OLTMANS wanted

to offer his guests an opportunity for an informal discussion.

About the background of the present good relations of OLTMANS with

the Soviet Representation in The Netherlands, section I is able to

report the following:

This

information comes from vulnerable source - OPPERBA1S.)

1. In September 1970 OLTMANS says with some surprise that he sudden-

ly received an invitation to

a party at the Russian Embassy.

He thinks it crazy; he doesn't belong to that club at all. But

his thinking is along the lines of those people.

2. In October 1970 OLTMANS appears

to be interested in an interview

with KOSYGIN's son-in-law GVISHANI who

with American-Russian discussions about forming a nutual "think-

ing factory".

Presumably this had some connection with the so called Club of

Rome in which GVISHIANI plays a role.

Remark: GVISHINI is chairman of the

state committee for science

and technology and is

suspected to be a highly placed

Intelligence Officer.

3. Begining March 1970 OLTMANS contacted the Press Attache OPALEV

from the Russian Embassy; OLTMANS would still like to have an

interview with GVISHIANI.

It would be a filmed interview in which OLTMANS would cooperate

with the NOS. (IV).

In this period OPALEV's cooperation does not yet

seem very

extensive.

4. Thanks to the cooperation of jurelio PECCEI, chairman

of the

Club of Rome,

OLTMANS at the end of April 1971 succeeded in get-

ting in contact with GVISHIANI in Paris.

Also present at this discussion was

the

former mentor of the Russ

Embassy FEDEROVSKY, now chief of protocol of the state committee

for science and technology:

2.

It this opportunity GVISIIAVI immediately invited OLTMANS for a

visit to Moscow.

FEDEROVSKY was instructed to inform the Russian Embassy in The

bague about it.

GVISHIANI who

at the same time is chairman of the commission for

environment administration in the Soviet Union, asked OLTMANS to

make a film at

the same time about the environment administration

in the Soviet Union to

support the international environment

conference to be held this year.

5. Begining May it becomes clear that since OLTMANS' discussion with

GVISHIANI, OPALEV's attitude towards OLTMANS has greatly changed.

OPALEV is now all willingness.

In May OLTMINS makes his film

with GVISHIANI and receives an inv-

itation to come to the Soviet Union for the second half of August

and the whole of September, where he could filn ten scientific

institutes.

GVISHIANI told OLTMANS that he had complete trust in hin.

6. In June 1971 OLTMANS again contacted GVISHINI,

this time in

Vienna, where there was

a meeting of the Club

of Rome.

7. Begining October 1971 OLIMANS again saw GVISHIANI in Paris,

where,

among other things he spoke to him about his visit to The Netherla:

in the second week of October.

OLTMANS did his best to oblige GVISHIANI while visiting The Neth-

erlands by trying

establish business relations for him (for

instance with Philips).

rece.uee

8. In November 1971 OLINANS, from the Russian

state television an

offer for a five year contract to make exclusive films in the

Soviet Union.

This offer was made to OLIMINS during

his visit to the Soviet

Union. It is concretization of the earlier offer by GVISHIANI to

film a number of scientific institutes in the Soviet Union.

On 17 November OLTMANS allegedly discussed this business further

with GVISHIINI in Geneva.

9. On 23 January 1972 OLTMANS will make another visit to Mosco to

discuss making the above mentioned films without

the participation

of the NOS. At this opportunity OLTMANS will leave behind a nemo

about LUNS in connection with OLIMINS' present agitation against

the Secretary-General of NATO.

OLTMINS wants to prevent LUNS getting any future opportunity to

visit Moscow.

to the meeting in OLTNINS' house on 18 January 1972 it

reported that

on 17 January 1972 OLTMANS stated that he

is again seeking reaction from the Russians who will visit him

18 January; their reaction in connection with OLTMANS' request

to the general prosecutor of the High Council to bring action

against LUNS.

3.

In the morning on 18 January OLINANS also stated that KUZNETSOV

said that OLTMANS'

action against LUNS will

not

succeed because

the "bosses" stand behind LuNs.

It is not clear when KUZNETSOV

said this to OLMINS, but it is

known that OLTMANS recently attended a meeting where a nunber

of Russians were present.

(Possibly the meeting of

the Association "Nederland-USSR" with

the delegation from "USSR-Nederland" on 14 January 1072.)

11. On 19: January 1972 it was

nvited to the evening in OLTMANS'

arrival and asked whether he could bring a friend.

Afterwards this friend appeared to be Peter ZONNEVELD from De

Telegraaf.

OLIMANS said that at the press conference which he (OLTMANS)

will give on 20 January 1972 several guests, Milo INSTADT, Rob :

KOPUIT and Jaap JANSEN will defend OLTNINS against the attack on

him in "De Telegraaf" of this morning.

19 January 1972.
