The 1961 Tampa City Directory and the November,

The Miami Office advised by communication

dated February 9, 1962, that JUDITH SALVAT had two

collect telephone calls on December 31, 196I, from

LEWIS FERNANDEZ, Orlando, Florida phone CH 1-2310.

AT ORLANDO, FLORIDA

The following investigation was conducted and

reported by Special Agent JAMES B. HAFLEY:

Current Orlando telephone and city directories

not include any listing on a LEWIS or LOUIS FERNANDeZ.

unlisted

The Orlando telephone number CH 1-2310 is the

I telephone number to Mrs. JEANNETTE CORBIN,

1843 Oak Lane, Orlando, who is employed as office

secretary by THOMPSON & BRETT, Attorneys, 25 S. Magnolia

Street, Orlando, Florida.

JAMES BRETT is a former

United

States Commissioner at Orlando and currently

represents numbers operators around Orlando whenever

they are arrested.

JEANNETTE CORBIN is a niece of NORMA MAE

BRIDGES,

a former girlfriend and numbers associate

Of HARLAN ALEXANDER BLACKBURN.. NORMA MAE BRIDGES, her

son and JEANNETTE CORBIN all reside at 1843 Oak Street,

Orlando.

On February 13, 1962, TP T-1 advised Special

Agent HAFLEY the NORMA MAE BRIDGES, several years prior

to the CASTRO regime in Havana, had been visiting in

Havana and happened to meet a Cuban woman named JUDY

mona bana Soror

FERNANDEZ, who had a young son in his early teens about

the same age at such time

as NORMA MAE BRIDGES' son.

Source said NORMA BRIDGES then suggested to JUDY FER

NANDEZ that she allow her son to visit NORMA MAE BRIDGES

and her son in Orlando,

Florida.

Source said NORMA

even further had suggested to JUDY FERnANdEz that her

son could possibly go to school in Orlando. JudY

FERNANDEZ and her son, LEWIS FERNANDEZ, accepted the

invitation and several months later, LEWIS FERNANDEZ

came to Orlando, Florida, and resides with NORMA MAE

BRIDGES and her

son at 1843 Oak Lane, Orlando. LEWIS

FERNANDEZ attended the 8th and 9th grades in Orlando

and returned to Havana, Cuba, only for summer vacations.

Source related that LEWIS FERNANDEZ, who is now

sixteen years of age, was last at the BRIDGES home in

Orlando

during a weekend "several weeks ago" when LEWIS

visited NORMA and her son for two or three days.

Source related that LEWIS FERNANDEZ has no

close friends in Orlando other than NORMA BRIDGES and her.

son, but said it was possible that LEWIS may have a few

friends in the Miami area; however, source stated the

identities of the persons

were not known.

Source stated

that NORMA BRIDGES positively did not know LEWIS

FERNANDEZ's whereabouts now, however the United States

Immigration authorities at Miami would probably have a

record of his location at this time.

III. LEGITIMATE ENTERPRISE

Re: Miami Pest Control

Miami, Florida

TP T-2 on February 8, 1962, indicated that

ANGELO BRUNO and his brother-in-law,

RALPH MARANCA,

in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, had discussed SANTO,

who was in Miami, Florida, that BRUNO Knew SANTO had

no legitimate means of support, and that they, BRUNO

and SANTO, considered getting many customers on Miami

+.

Beach and

in Miami, for an extermination business. The

business would be Miami Pest Control, registered in

Miami; and BRUNO was desirous of getting a man with a

college degree in business administration to head the company,

having complete control of the company.

Source indicated,

however, that BRUNO had difficulties in placing his plans.

into operation in Miami as apparently the man with the

college degree did not want any part of any illegitimate

deal and had to be assured by BRUNO that they, BRUNo and

SANTO, were more interested in running the business

legitimately than even the college degree man, noting

the college man need only hire men to do the

work and

that BRUNO and SANTO could get all the customers.

Sub-

sequently, the college man apparently saw SANTO's, VITO's

and ALBERT's pictures in a newspaper; and when BRUNO

contacted the college man on a trip

to Miami, the

college man indicated his family did not want any deal

with BRUNO and SANTO.
