ADMINISTRATIVE:

Tanpa has assumea origin in this matter under the

caption of ANTI- CASTRO CROUP, ORLANDO, PLORIDA, aS It has not

been clearly established that this

group officially represents

the Second National Front of Escambray (SNFE) (Operation Alpha 66)

on which Miami is origin...

The latter designation is added to

the title in this report for the sake of clarification, as

nost of the information developed on the Orlando, Fla., group

appears to pertair to SNFE, Operation Alpha 66.

CIA advised the Bureau on 9/17/63 it had no

operational interest in the project mentioned

at Orlando,

concoming tha X6 military type aircratt purchased by hipha st

and its plans to ready this aircraft for possible raids against

FIOME CASTRO.

By airtel dated 10/1/63, the Miami Division advised

the Bureau that fAA, Custons, and

the Coast Guard were contacted

relative to the above-mentioned aircrait, the key allegedly being

used as a base which has an airstrip, and the two Americans who

offered their services, all of which

was with negative results.

All sources at Miami. were alerted to immediately

furnish any information bearing on possible neutrality natters,

Including air raids of attacks by boat.

In connection with the particular allogation that

the group has a key on which they have stored arns and ammunition,

as well as an airstrip, the following is noted.

in connection with this plan.

There is

the tro"Anericans' as DONALD SELIGMAN, of the Selignan Insurance

Agency, Orlando, Fla., and an Individual who uses the alias

Of HANK JACKSON,

but who has a completely different true name

which is unknown to the informat.

Informant fearsd some type

of reprisal. if it vere revealed that he had identified these

two individuals.

For this reason, Tampa did not deen it

appropriate to disseninate the identity of the "Americans" st

this time, nor is it deemed advisable to approach or interview

either one.

Case lad been opened to obtain background through

usual sources.

According to [REPEDINO] CUBELA (ENU)

desires some sort of compact equipment with which he can

possibly eliminate CASTRO; however, CIA keeps offering

him only large, bulky, unserviceable material.

According to TEPEDINO, there is now under discussior

some plan to kill FIDEL CASTRO, in which CUBELA will figure.

CIA allegedly was formerly in favor of such a plan; however,

inasmuch as Attorney General ROBERT KENNEDY would have no

part of it, it was shelved. Now the plan has allegedly been

brought up

again for consideration.

President JOHNSON

allegedly is aware of it, and has not ruled against it.

If set in motion, it will be scheduled to occur sometime

CUBELA is supposed to participate, that it is to be

informant presumed from his manner of speaking that he had

obtained it from CUBELA.

The above is for the information of the Bureau,

and is not being submitted in form suitable for dissemination
