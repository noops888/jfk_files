From a review of the Agency's file on Lee Harvey OSWALD,

it becomes apparent that the Agency and its field stations, Parti

cularly in Mexico City and Miaimi, were, not unmindful of the possi

bility that OSWALD did not act alone. During the first few weeks

after the assassination, Headquarters, upon at least three occas

sions, exhorted the Mexico City Station to continue all your

coverage of the Cuban and Soviet installations •

zOn 28: Novem

ber 1963, the Chief, WH/3, told the Mexico CIty Station that there

should be no let down in your efforts to follow all leads and im

vestigate all facts which bear on this case. We have by no means

excluded the possibility that other as yet unknown persons may have

been involved or even that other powers nay have played a role.t

Emphasis added DIR 85655, 28 November 19631 On 30 November,

Headquarters asked the Mexico City Station to follow. all leads and

tips."The question of whether OSWALD acted solely on his own has

still not been finally resolved. (Emphasis added. (DIR 860643

30 November 19631 And on the 12th of December 1963, Chief, WH/3,

again asked the Mexico City Station to continue to watch for

Soviet and Cuban reaction to investigation of assassination, evi-

dence of their complicity, signs they putting out propaganda about

case. (Emphasis added.) "FYI only, Soviet intelligence in India

had letters sent to

(US) leaders demanding full investigation

of case. [DIR 88680, 12 December 1963]

the mexico city Station, however, had already initiated a

thorough review of its holdings in an attempt ascertain what infor-

mation was available on Lee Harvey OSWALD, his presence, and his

activities in mexteo City..

This review turned up the fact that

Silvia DURAN a Mexican national employed by the Cuban Consulate,

had dealt with OSWALD during his known visits to the Consulate on

27 and 28 September In response to a suggestion from the Station,

the Ministry of Gobernacion arrested Silvia DURAN and her husband,

Horacio, on 23 November 1963. [MEXI - 7037 (IN aS

) 23 November

1963] Later the same day, an official of the Ministry informed

## Page 4

the Station that Silvia DURAN was completely cooperative and had

given a written statement attesting to two visits by OSWALD to the

Consulate. [MEXI-7046 (IN , 23 November 1963] Although her

testimony was taken and presented, solely, by the Mexican Govern-

ment authorities, Silvia DURAN was the only live witness on record

regarding OSWALD's activities in Mexico City. It is from her state

ments that it was learned that OSWALD became engaged jir a personat

altercation on 27 September 1963 with Eusebio AZCUE, the Cuban Con

sut and a member of the Cuban intelligence unit in Mexico Gity.

He

Left Mexico on 12 November 1963 after being repiced by Alfredo

MIRABEL Diaz

There is no evidence in the OSWALD file that Silvia DURAN

was subjected toxa systematic elicitative interrogation that would

have related her dealings with OSWALD, known or confirmed by inter-

cept, with the data held on the Cuban DGI (Direccion General de In-

telligencia) its personalities and methods, in Mexico City Was it

normal for a case like OSWALD's, considering the fuss he allegedly

made with AZCUE, for the applications to be handled solely by a lo

cal employee and a lame duck like AZCUE whose slot had been taken

by the DGI chief? Whatever the answer to these questions, they were

not asked at the time. And there remains the more fundamental ques:

tion: accepting the DURAN story as it stands, could it have hap-

pended without the knowledge and participation of DGI personnel in

the Consulate? This seems untikely especially because Manuel En-

genio VEGA Perez. later cited by a Cuban DGI defector as having

stated he was aware OSWALD had made several visits to the Cuban

Consulate It is clear CASTRO's overseas intelligence and security

service could have more in its files than was surfaced in the

DURAN statements.

As of September 1964, Silvia DURAN gave up her, Cuban

Embassy job. In the spring of 1967, Silvia DURAN was reported by

a reliable and sensitive source to have cut all relations with

Cubans. Her account, in 1967, of how she had been taken into

custody and had been interrogated after the assassination re-

peated what was already known. She added, under circumstances

that did not permit the source to challenge or elicit corrodorative

detail, that she had gone out with OSWALD during his stay in Mexico

City and claimed she had sexual relations with him. libid, prole

Almost immediately after the President's assassination,

Agency field stations began receiving information from various

sources of undetermined reliability relating to the alleged assa.

ssin of President Kennedy.

AS the harren Commission reported on pages sus and 50%

of its report, "Literally, dozens of altegations of a conspiratorial

contact between OSWALD and agents of the Cuban Government have been

investigated

The authors of the Report go on to state

that

Among the claims made were allegations that

OSWALD had made a previous trip to Mexico

City in early September to receive money

and orders for the assassination [567], that

he had flown to a secret airfield some-

where in or near the Yucatan Peninsula

[568l, that he might have made contacts in

Mexico City with a communist from the United

States shortly before the assassination [569E

with him in the United States and paid him

one in Cuba alleging the writer had attended

a meeting where the assassination had been

discussed as part of a plan which would soon

include the death of other non-communist

that in a speech he delivered 5 days after

the assassination, while he was under the

influence of liquor,

Fidel Castro made a

Ship of the tongue and said, "The first

way the fact that OSWALD had made one or

more surreptitious trips to that country

"Some stories linked the assassination

to anti-Castro groups who allegedly were

engaged in obtaining illicit firearms in

the United States, one such claim being

that these groups killed the President as

part of a bargain with some illicit orga-

nizations who would then supply them with

firearms as payment: (573 Other rumors

times, allegedly in pro-Cuban activities

talk [576]. Castro himself, it was alle-

ged, I days after the assassination called

for the files relating to Oswald's dealings

with two members of the Cuban diplomatic

mission in the Soviet Union; the inference

drawn was that the 'dealings' had occurred

and had established a secret subversive re-

lationship which continued through OSWALD's

life: L5771.

Without exception, the rumors

and allegations of a conspiratorial con-

tact were shown to be without any factual

basis win some cases the product of mis-

taken identtfication.

The Warren Report makes reference (bracketed numbers in

the above text) to Commission Exhibits (see Attachment I for list

of Commission Exhibits) most of which had been furnished by the

Federal Bureau of Investigation. Only the first reference the

ALVARADO interrogation was furnished by the Agency. The Agency

did, however, provide assistance and information to the FBI in the

latter'S investigation of three of the allegations (see asterisked

Exhibits). The results pf the Agency's investigation of other

rumors and allegations relating to OSWALD and the possible involve-

ment of the Cubans and Soviets in the assassination, were dissemina-

ted to the FBI, primarily, and to the Warren Commission (see attach-

ment i for a lost of disseminations to the FBT, and attachment iTi

for a list of memoranda to the Warren Commission) •

Among these cases, which consumed hundreds of man-hours

in Headquarters and abroad

and similarly the FBI in the United

States and Mexico City was the Nicaraguan, Gilberto ALVARADO,

who contacted the United States Embassy in Mexico City on 25 Novem-

ber 1963.

The ALVARADO case is taken up in detail by the Warren

Commission, in its report, under the cryptograph D'as being

illustrative of the attention given to the most serious allega-

tions.

On 25 November 1963, a young Nicaraguan, Gilberto Notasc

ALVARADO Ugarte

## Page 8

telephoned the United States Embassy in Mexico City Later, that

day he met with the Embassy security officer and a Station officer

at which time he claimed he had been in the Cuban Consulate in

Mexico City on 18 September 1963. While in the Consulate he saw a

man whom he later recognized as Lee Harvey OSWALD receive $6,500

in cash to kill an important person in the United States.

ALVARADO described the circumstances as follows While

standing by a bathroom door about noon he saw a group of three

persons conversing on a patio a few feet away. One was a tall,

thin Negro with reddish hair, obviously dyed, who spoke rapidly in

both Spanish and English. He had prominent cheek bones and a

noticeable scar on the lower right side of his chin. The second

was a white person whom ALVARADO had seen previously in a waiting

room carrying a Canadian passport. The white person had green

eyes, blondish hair, with a pompadour hairdo, and dark eyeglasses.

The third person allegedly was Lee Harvey OSWALD. ALVARADO waS

convinced of this from published photographs of OSWALD foldowing

the assassination. OSWALD was wearing a black sport coat, but=

toned-up white shirt with short collar tabs, no tie, dark gray

pants, and clear eyeglasses. He had a green passport in his pocket

wore a wrist watch with a yellow band, and appeared to have a pis-

tol in a shoulder holster. A tall Cuban joined the group momen-

tarily and passed American currency to the Negro. The Neto then

allegedly said to OSWALD in English, "I want to kill the man."

OSWALD replied, You're not man enough, I can do it. The Negro

then said in Spanish, Il can't go with you

I have a lot to do.

OSWALD replied

"The people are waiting for me back there." The

Negro then gave OSWALD $6,500 in large denomination U.S. bills,

saying, "This isn't much." After hearing this conversation ALVA-

rado said that he telephoned the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City

several times on 20 September before the assassination innan at-

tempt to report his belief that someone important in the United

States was to be killed, but was finally told by someone at the

Embassy to stop wasting his time.

ALVARADO was known to this Agency as a former informant

of Nicaraguan security service. His reliability was considered

questionable by American authorities although he had, not been

wholly discredited. ALVARADO claimed he was in Mexico City working

against the Cuban communists for his service. The service how

ever, has denied that he was acting on its behalf. While investiga

tion in the United States showed that OSWALD could not possibly hav

have been in Mexico City on 18 September (he was knwon to have been

in New Orleans on both 17 and 19 September), intensive interrogat

tion failed to shake ALVARADO's story.

On 28 November 1963, the Mexican police interviewed him.

At first ALVARADO persisted in hisestory but on 30 November head-

mitted inva signed statement that his whole account about OSWALD

was false. He admitted he had not. seen Lee OSWALD at all and. that

he had not seen anybody paid money in the Cuban Embassy He also

admitted he had not tried repeatedly to phone a warning to the U.S

Embassy in Mexico City on 20 September as he had previously claimed

Instead he had first contacted the U.S. Embassy after the assassi

nation.

ALVARADO said that his motive in telling this false story

was to help get himself admitted into the United States so that he

could participate in action against Fidel CASTRO. He said that he

hated CASTRO and thought that his story about OSWALD, if believed,

would help cause the United States to take action against CASTRO.

Following the above interrogation, ALVARADO retracted the

confession he had made to the Mexican authorities asserting that it

had been extorted from him under pressure. He was then questtoned

by US authorities using a polygraph machine. ALVARADO volunta

rily consented to the use of this equipment. During the quesioning

it was pointed out to him that he was not being truthful, according

to the polygraph, in identifying photographs of OSWALD as the per-

son he saw in the Cuban Consulate. He replied that he had fun

faith in the polygraph, that he would not attempt to refute the re.

sults, and that he "must have been mistaken" In addition, he

he changed his story regarding the day he visited the Cuban Consu-

late, finally deciding it took place on Tuesday, 17 September.

was concluded from the results of the polygraph test that ALVARADO

had fabricated his story from whole cloth.

[Memorandum to J. Lee RANKIN, General Counsel, dated 4 June 19645

from Richard HELMS, Deputy Director for Plans.]

(Comment: Some idea of the time and effort expended by the Agency

in breaking ALVARADO'S story may be gained from a review of the

Chronological Summary of the Gilberto ALVARADO Interrogation under

attachment IV.

Although the Warren Report had used the ALVARADO case-to

demonstrate the type of allegation the Agency had had to contend

with, the Schweiker Report took the Agency to task for not having

become more suspicious of possible Cuban involvement in the assassi

nation. To some extent, the authors of the Schweiker Report are

right.

There were other rumors and allegations indicating that

OSWALD may not have acted entirely on his own; however, none of

there rumors and allegations stood up under intensive investigation

Moreover, each rumor or allegation was treated as a separate and

unrelated case the only common denominator being OSWALD. There

appears to have been no suspicion on the part of the Agency that

these rumors and allegations might have been part of a larger decep

tion plan orchestrated by a foreign counterintelligence service.

Only a thorough investigation of all available information including

overt comments by responsible communist officials could have allayed

these suspicions or generated additional requirements to be levied

on Agency assets world wide.: Obviously such an investigation would

have required an enormous quantity of patience, time, and personnel

None of these prerequisites was available, especially in light of

the tremendous political pressures under which the Agency, the FBI

the Warren Commission, and others were working precluded the initia

tion of such an investigation.

It was not until eleven years later that the Agency was

asked to prepare a review of allegations of Cuban involvement in

the John F. Kennedy assassination. On. 15 April 1975, David W.

BELIN, Executive Director of the Rockefeller Commission, addressed

a letter to the Agency in which he stated

"As you know, there have been allegations

Intelligence Agency, dated 15 April 1975, from David W. BELIN

Executive Director Commission on GIA Aetivities within the United

States l

Insits response to the above letter, the Agency noted

that the results of its review "add nuance, not evidence, to what

the Warren Commission and its staff had laid before them in 1964

in this subject"

As to CASTRO'S remarks during an informal interview by

the Associated Press correspondent, Daniel HARKER, the Agency com-

mented that There can be no question from the facts surrounding the

CASTRO appearance, which had not been expected, and his agreement

to the interview, that this event represented a more-than-ordinary

attempt to get a message on the record in the United States (Em=

phasis added. The Agency commented further that "There is no evi

dence in the files on the KENNEDY assassination that this CASTRO

interview was considered in following up leads or in dealings with

the Warren Commission and its staff although Mexico Station speci

fically directed Headquarters attention to the AP story very shortly

after the Dallas killing

More important, the interview appears to

have been forgotten in the contemporary political consideration ofa

relations with CASTRO's Cuba.

There is no evidence in Agency re-

cords, either, that the Warren Commission staff itself pursued the

implication of the CASTRO interview in dealing with the conspiracy

hypothesis. There is no evidence in the files that anything along

these lines was stated by any other Cuban leader before the assassi

nation."

the purpose

According to the author of the review was to reconsider

Lee Harvey OSWALD's activity on the assumption that as an avid news

paper reader which is known from testimony of Marina OSWALD and

others -he read the CASTRO

warning and threat which appeared New

Orleans' principal morning paper, the Times-Picayune, on Monday,

9 September 1963. The results of the review, admittedly heavi

using 20-20 hindsight, may be set out in summary:

a. There is no increment of credible

evidence, applying this phrase strictly,

of Soviet and/or Cuban political, intelli

gence

or security service involvement in

the assassination to what was developed

and considered by the Warren Commission and

its staffe

The Commission's finding that

Lee Harvey OSWALD was the killer of Presi

dent KENNEDY and-Officer TIPPITT and did

them in alone and-of his own determination

stands

Credible evidence' that would

upset or significantly modify this judge-

ment did (and does) not exist in Washing-

ton. But such evidence could exist in

Moscow and/or Havana, whose voluntary in-

putse to the Warren Commission were minimal

in quantity and quality, designed to cover

up any admissions of knowledge of, or con-

nection with, OSWALD which might be related

directly or indirectly with the assassina-

tion.

Therefore, the belief that there

was Soviet and/or Cuban (KGB and/or DGI)

connection with OSWALD will persist and

grow until there has been a full disclosure

by these governments of all elements of

OSWALD'S handling and stay and in the Soviet

Union and his contacts in Mexico City.. The

Warren Commission report should have left a

wider window'

for this contingency.

That ,

indeed, was the opinion at the working level,

particularly in the counterintelligence com=

ponent in the CIA in 1964. As was indicated

by Mr. HELMS in his testimony before the

Warren Commission, CIA would continue to

regard this aspect of the OSWALD case as

still open.

"c. In the absence of additional or new

elements of credible evidence', there are

nuances' in the record that emerge as note-

worthy, in the light of other conclusions.

RADO's interrogation by Mexican authorities, he called the Ameri

official with whom he made an appointment for that same day at

5:30 p.m. near the Hotel Maria Isabel. Two individuals appeared

for the appointment. According to a note in the Mexico Station

file, signed by the Embassy Security Officer, A. C. PLAMBECK -

dated 25 November these two men were SNIGHT and PLAMBECK; both

were Embassy security officers. He told Embassy personnel that he

was in the Cuban consulate on September 17 and saw Cubans who dis-

cussed assassination pay OSWALD a sum of money. [Comment: During

his first meeting with Embassy officials, ALVARADO claimed he had

been at the Cuban Consulate on the l8th of September, not the 17th.

In fact, at no time, did he refer to the date 17 September.

during his interrogation in connection with the polygraph examina-

7069 (IN 68376); however, this cable does not contain any remarks

alluding to information which "tended to confirm 'D's story".

This information appears in MEXI-7072 (IN 68406), 26 November 1963

which contains Ambassador MANN's message to RUSK, MCCONE, and

HOOVER. MANN's statement reads as foltows:

"While we recognize

lack of established reliability of Nicaraguan and danger of reaching

hasty conclusions, we suggest that DORTICOS preoccupation with

money angle of interrogation of Silvia DURAN tends to corroborate

to some extent authenticity of the Nicaraguan's statement. Thus,

there appears to be a strong possibitity that a cown payment was

made to OSWALD in the Cuban Embassy there, presumably with promise

of a subsequent payment after assassination." The Ambassador was

reading somewhat more Into the situation than was the case. The

reference to DORTICOS - the Cuban President - relates to two tele-

phone conversation between DORTICOS and HERNANDEZ, the Cuban Amba-

ssador to Mexico, on 26 November 1963.

The first conversation,

which took place at 0924, was forwarded, in resume, to Headquarters

, the second conversation

which took place at 1839, was forwarded, in resume, to Headquarters

on 27 November 1963 (MEXI -7097 IN

aIn the first conversa-

tion DORTICOS asks (if) "the Federals of that country wanted Senora

DURAN to say something, that they had some interest in, and had.

offered some money to the American?" To which HERNANDEZ answers

that there was nothing about money. In the second conversation,

DORTICOS is quoted as saying:"I was referring as to whether they

had threatened her so that she would make a statement that the Con-

sulate had given money to the man - that American." HERNANDEZ ans-

wered that "nothing absolutely was given her" [sic]. It would not

appear from a close reading of these two conversations that they

contain information "which tended to confirm D's! story

This report has never been satisfactorily explained, although it

was made available to the Warren Commission Staff In any event,

these reports certainly must have fueled suspicions of Cuban in-

volvement in the assassination..

Based on the evidence it reviewed,

the warren Commission later determined that "D"'s story was a fabri

cation. [Comment: This statement appears to be gratitous the

Warren Commission did not ask about the ALVARADO case until 21

April 1964. On that date RANKIN addressed a letter to Richard

report could be submitted by the expert who conducted the polygraph

examination which emphasizes the specific conclusions which he made

based on the responses by ALVARADO in answering key questions on

this matter. (Letter to Richard HELMS, DDP, dated 21 April 1964

June 1964. (Memorandum to J. Lee RANKIN, dated 1 June 1964, from

The American Ambassador in Mexico later sent a cable

[MEXI-7072 (IN 68406), 26 November 19631 to State Department through

CIA channels. In that cable he gave his opinion that the Cubans

were involved in the assassination, and recommended certain inves-

tigative steps which should be taken in Mexico.

40 (EN: Cable from

Mexico Station to CIA Headquarters, 11/26/63.)

By November 27, the Mexico Station and CIA Headquarters

were also beginning to question the accuracy of "D"'s stroy. The

cables between the Mexico Station and Headquarters indicate the

possibility that the story was a fabrication. Nevertheless, on

November 28, Headquarters cabled a reminder to the Mexico Station

to "follow all leads". The Station was instructed to continue in-

vestigating the possibility of cuban or soviet involvement, because

Headquarters had not excluded the possibility that other persons

were involved with OSwArD. 11 (PN: A cable from CIA Headquarters

to Mexico Station, 11/28/03-1 [DIR 85655, 28 November 1963)

Later that day (27 November Headquarters leared that

Mexican authorities planned to arrest Silvia DUrAN again and warned

the Station that the Mexicans must take responsibility fon the an

rest. After learning that the u.S. Ambassador was continuing to

press for a vigorous investigation into Cuban involvement, Head-

quarters also warned the Station Chief that the Ambassador was

pushing the case too hard and his proposals could lead to a "flap"

with the Cubans. 46 (FN. A cable from CIA Headquarters to Mexico

Station, 11/28/63. [DIR 85655, 28 November 1963] Finally, the

Agency concluded that "D"'s story was a fabrication and terminated

its interest in him.

47 (EN: Ibid.)

On November 30, Director McCONE met with the President

at 11.a.m.

While there was a discussion of the allegations

made by "D" the memorandum records no action was required on the

"OSWALD situation". 49 (EN: Memo-andum for the Record by Director

McCone, 12/2/63) [Comment: Memorandum not available in the file.]

On December 1, McCONE met with the President and BUNDY?

MCCONE's memorandum of the meeting indicates they again discussed

"D''s story. Later that day, Headquarters cabled the Mexico Station

and stated that the white House had been told the story was a fabri

cation.

Later that day (2 December], the Mexico Sta-

reported it had reason to doubt its earlier conclusion that "D"

was fabricating.

[Comment: The authors of the Report give no

source for this statement.. Moreover, they leave the reader in the

air as to what was the outcome of further investigation to deter:

-mine whether the earlier-conclusion-that ALAVARDO was fabricating

was an accurate conclusion. The facts are as follows:

On 2 December, Captain WHEELOCK saw ALVARADO during the

afternoon for the first time. In a brief interview, which lasted

only seven minutes, in the company of two Mexican officials,

ALVARADO reverted to his previous story. He claimed he did seo

OSWALD and that he did call the Embassy to report. (Latter state-

ment not supported by Embassy investigation.) ALVARADO went on to

say that he told the Mexicans he was fabricating because he was

"mentally mistreated", specifically because he was threatened that

he would be hanged by the testicles. Actually he was not physically

mistreated. WHEELOCK said he was unable to come to any definite

conclusion as to ALVARADO'S veracity; however, he would be able to

do so once he returned to Managua and had a chance to complete the

interrogation. (MEXI-7023 IN 71702, 2 December: 1963)

On 3 December 1963, Headquarters tells the Mexico Sta-

tion that although Headquarters is confident that ALVARADO is a

fabricator and that his retraction of his confession is false, it

has been decided that he should be placed on the polygraph. Head-

quarters asks that the Station arrange to have ALVARADO released

to CIA custody for several days and ask WHEELOCK to remain in Mexi

co to assist.

A polygraph operator from the Office of Security will

arrive on 4 December. He will be incharge of the polygraph inter-

view, but will be assisted by Clark ANDERSON (Legal, Attache) , who

has been selected as an interpreter. The FBI will notify ANDERSON

of this. (DIR 86563, 3 December 1963)

* Captain Franklin Anthony WHEELOCK Garcia, Chief of the Anti-

Communist Section of the Nicaraguan Office of National Security,

arrived in Mexico City on 29 November 1963. WHEELOCK went to

Mexico in response to Mexico Station's request for assistance in

interrogating ALVARADO. For further details see accompanying

chronological summary on Gilberto ALVARADO.

ECHEVARRIA, the Acting Minister of Gobernacion, agreed

to permit CIA to "borrow" ALVARADO: The plan was to pick up

ALVARADO on 5 December and return him that evening. (MEXI-7229

IN 72877, 3 December 1963) ALVARADO was picked up as planned and-

underwent preliminary questioning on 5 December. The next day he-

underwent a, polygraph interview. The results of this interview

indicated that ALVARADO was fabricating his story.

Interrogation

revealed that he was unsure as to the exact day of the week he alle

gedly saw OSWALD. He thought it was on a Tuesday which would have

been the 17th of September. When ALVARADO was shown a series of

photographs during the testing, deception patterns became evident.

When he was confronted with this he answered that he had the utmost

confidence in the polygraph and that it must be correct. The in

terrogation was concluded with ALVARADO admitting he must have made

an honest mistake" in relating the original story in his identifi

cation of OSWALD. (MEXI-7289 IN 75588, 7 December)

Following the receipt of the results of the above inter

view with ALVARADO, Headquarters disseminated the results to the

Federal Bureau of Investigation.

CHRONOLOGICAL SUMMARY: Gilberto Nolasco ALVARADO Ugarte

18 September 1963

According to ALVARADO's statements made during an inter

view conducted in the morning of 26 November 1963 by an American

Embassy security officer and a member of the Mexico Station in

Mexico City, ALVARADO went at noon on 18 September to the Cuban

Consulate to turn over passport photographs to the Cuban Consul

Eusebio AZCUE.

While standing by a rest room off a passage

way leading to a patio, ALVARADO saw a group of three persons. con-

versing on the patio a few feet away. One man was a tall, thin

Negro with reddish hair, obviously dyed. He had prominent cheek

bones, and a noticeable scar on the lower right side of his chin.

He spoke radpidly with a Cuban accent and did speak some English

Another member of the group was a white person whom ALVARADO had

seen Previous Yoin the waiting room, carrying a Canadian passport.

The Canadian had green eyes, blondish hair combed in an "existen-

tralist manner with a pompadour He was wearing dark eyeglasses

of a type with a mirror like reflection on the outer surface. The

third member of the group was Lee Harvey OSWALD.

He was waering a

black sport coat, a buttoned up white shirt with short collar tabs

no tie, gray pants and clear eyeglasses.

ALVARADO saw a tall Cuban join the group momentarily and

pass American currency to the Negro. This unidentified Cuban ap-

parently came out of AZCUE's office onto the patio.

• ALVARADO des -

cribed the Cuban as a tall, solidly built mulatto, with curly hair,

who appeared to be about 37 years old.

He was wearing a brown suit

and a red-striped tie.

ALVARADO never saw this man again after 18

September.

ALVARADO claimed he overheard the following conversation

between the Negro and OSWALD:

Negro (in English) :

"I want to kill the man".

OSWALD

You re not man enough.I can do

OSWALD

The people are waiting for me back

there."

The Negro gave OSWALD six thousand five hundred dollars

in large denomination US bills saying? This isn't much "Of the

sum, one thousand live hundred dollars was for extra expenses The

Negro atso gave him about 200 Mexican pesos.

Later, ALVARADO saw a pretty girl, whom he believed to ber

a Cuban employee of the Consulate, give OSWALD an abrazo embrace

and tell him she was living at Callo Juarez number 107 where he-

could find her the girl peared to about 20 yours old and had

manners which reminded ALVARADO of a prostitute. OSWALD, the Negr

and the Canadian then went upstairs.

ALVARADO left the building momentarily to buy popsicle

on the corners he saw the above three men leave by the Embassy gate

near the corner of Tacubaya where they entered a parked black car,

possibly a Chvrolet.

At the end of September, ALVARADO telephoned the American

Embassy several times to report his belief that someone important

in the United States was to be killed.

When ALVARADO saw OSWALD's photograph in the newspaper,

he again contacted the Embassy on 25 November.

then said he was sorry that he could accompany OSWALD, saying:

"You understand my situation." To which OSWALD replied: "Thats

had come from Havana. When OSWALD entered (the Consulate? he

was affectionately greeted by a female employee of the Cuban Em=

"The "source" also stated that OSWALD was given $1,500

for extra expenses. Source stated that when he went to the bather

room he saw OSWALD counting the money, in American dollars, on the

patio which is adjacent.

We find it incredible

that the Cubans would brief and pay an assassin

in front of a NIC interloper. We think it pos-

sible or even likely that he has been in and.out

of the Cuban Embassy as a NIC agent trying to

infiltrate Cuba and has picked up the names and

faces there in so doing. All he has said about

OSWALD he could have gotten from the newspapers

except for certain incorrect items such as his

FBI says their follow-up investigation of OSWALD'S acti

that he was in New Orleans applying for unemployment insurance on

17 September 1963, means OSWALD would have had to fly to Mexico and

back between 17 and 19 September in order to be at the Cuban Embassy

getting his pay=off, as ALVARADO Claims, on 18 September. With

the latter saletter of 13 October 1964.

The Commission's Report (pages 307-308)

contains information furnished by this Agency

In memoranda dated 31 January and I June 1964

Since both include information relative torin-

telligence methods and operations which should

not be placed in the public domain

I suggest

the use of the revised and consolidated ver-

sious dated June 1964 which is forwarded as

an attachment. Me
