LA COSA NOSTRA

ANTI-RACKETEERING - CONSPIRACY

Enter on guis,

When New York's latest national summary report'

was received

at the Bureau and careful review commenced during mid-July, 1963, we

were aware that the Department had released voluminous data to the

"Saturday Evening Post" for preparation of a feature article on cap-

tioned organization.

Utmost caution was, therefore, necessary in

this material to guard against compromising our top sources

Te the criminal Intelligence field. When an adranced draft of the

"Saturday Evening Post" article was received shortly thereafter, it

became increasingly apparent that the Department was making full dis-

closure of our information on this organization and that special pre

cautions would be necessary to protect our most sensitive sources

from being pinpointed by Department release.

We had only to reflect on the fact that one of our top

member-sources, Alfredo Sanantonio, had been murdered in gang style

in New York on

July 11, 1963, a week or so before, to realize the

necessity of utmost caution.

Inasmuch as New York's report contained specific data which

we had received in the immediate past from a newly developed member-

source in Los Angeles, Salvatore Piscopo, who is our most valuable

source in southern California, Wait. was

necessary to delete certain

of his information and to reword other data furnished by him which,

II released, would tend to pinpoint him as the source.

detail regarding the Las Vegas skimming operation which, if released

by the Department, would seriously endanger our key sources covering

this operation. On this point we, of course, had to take into consid-

eration that sensitive data on the skimming operation had previously

been leaked to the underworld shortly following dissemination of such

material to the Department.

Thererore, It was necessary that consid-

erable material in this report concerning skimming be amended and

expressed in more general terms to avoid pinpointing our key sources.

The necessary changes have now,

been genei?ed19biom New York

and amended pages have been inserted in our copies of this report.
