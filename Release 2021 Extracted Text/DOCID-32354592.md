Identification of the Mr. X in the

Anderson Column

2129

1. The attached column, citing the testimony of a Mr. X

alleges that a ClA agent

tried to

link Oswald

to Cuban intelli

gence officers in Mexico.

There

is, of course, no substance to

the column's allegations. The

column identifies the source as

Mr. X because of attempts on his life, but subsequently gives

enough information on Mr. X to establish his identity.

2.: According to the Anderson column, Mr. & was tirst met

oy his ClA concace in havana betore relations with U.s. cuba were

severed. Mr. X had helped to organize bank accountants to em-

bezzle Cuban government funds to finance

anti-Castro.causes.

Mr. X was reportedly recruited by a Morris Bishop (CIA contact),

to plan an attempt on Castro's life.

The plan was to fire a

bazooka from a nearby apartment buiiding while Castro was deliver-

ing one of his marathon speeches.

According to the Anderson

column, the plot was discovered by Castro's police and Mr. X

to Miami

Ar. X also reportedly tried to assassinate

Castro in Chile in 1971 in league with the Venezuelan Luis Posada

Carrales, who is now being detained in Caracas for the 6 October

Cubana airline bombing.

The Anderson column ends

with the

теросі

that Mr.

X worked for CIA until 1973 for expenses,

but was paid

5253, 000 in cash by Morris Bishop when le

was terminated.

Frow the above description of Mr. A, 1c 1s reasonably

clear that Mr. X is Antonio Carlos VECIANA Blanch (201-312966):

VECIANA, an assistant bank manager and past president of a public

accountants association

in Havana, first contacted CIA in Mavana

in December 1960 when he asked the COS, at that timerones i. Nort

to help

in an assassination plot against Castro.

VICIANA asked

for visas for ten relatives of the four men assigned to kill Castro,

and also requested four MI

rifles with adapters for grenades plus

eight grenades.

The COS did not encourage VEGIANA and subsequently

checked with an Embassy officer who reported that VECIANA bad made

similar

"wild-eyed" proposals to him.

On 23 November 1961 the

Miami News published a report of an unsuccessful attempt by Antonio

VECIANA to kill Castro.

VECIANA reportedly had arranged to

assassinate Castro and. Cuban President Osvaldo Dorticos on 5 October

in Havana, but the bazooka he was using failed to fire.

4.

There has been no Agency relationship with VECIANA. A

POA, which was granted for his use

in para-military affairs in

January 1902, expired in November 1962.

VECIANA was born on

4 October 1935 in Havana.

He was a member of the People's Revo-

lutionary Movement, an anti-Castro group in Cuba during 1960-01, and

was one of the founders of Alpha-66.

A certified public accountant

by trade, VECIANA was with A.1.D: in la Paz in 1968-72. VECIANA

was registered

in ISR to the U.S. Army in November 1962 and he

was terminated without prejudice, in July 1966. On 23 July 1962

VECIANA WaS

interviewed, at his request, by Mr. Harry. Real from

the DCD New. York office.

VECIANA asked Real to arrange a meeting

with a senior ClA officer to discuss Alpha-66's plans to assassinate

Castro and to request CIA's assistance (U.S.$100,000; $100,000; 10,000. Cuban

pesos; 48 hand grenades). There is

no indication that. this request

was ever acted upon by CiA.

In April 1966 a LA Division officer,

John R. Mocy,

the alias John Livingston, met VECIANA in New

York City.

meeting was arranged by a retired naval officer, James Cogswell,

who had informed Chief, Wil Division that he had information of valuc

concerning Cuba. When lucy arrived in New. York City For the meeting,

he was introduced by Cogswell

to. VECIANA.

He immediately launchod

a discussion of the Cuban political situation

and noted his

strong

feeling that the only solution'

was the assassination of Castro.

Lucy advised VECTANA

that he was in no position to provide him with

assistance or encourago him in an assassination attempt and was onty

interested in gathering information which he thought was the purpose

of

the mocting.

VECIANA subsequently said that his roommate lelix

ZABALA,

& Cuban refugee, had excollent contacts in Havana.

It was

clear to lucy,

howcver,

VECIANA WaS

attempting to use ZABALA poten-

tially to get

Agency tinancial support for nis organization.

MANANA

suggested that $50,000 would be needed to get his

activities off the ground.

Lucy indicated to VECTAN that he

could look into the cABALA matter and

would probably arrange for

ZABALA t0 be contacted

in Puerto Rico.

6.

There is no indication in the file that any Agency officer

in contact with VECIANA ever used an alias Morris Bishop.

There is

no Morris Bishop listed in true name in the Do rolls.

There was

never any contractual relationship with VECTANA and be was not

paid CIA funds.

?: On 11 January 1977 a sanitized copy of VECIANA's 201 file

was made available to staffers from the Senate Select Committee on

Intelligence.
