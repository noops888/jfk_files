HSCA Conclusions

The record reviewed by this Committee, as set forth

above, supports the following conclusions:

1) Immediately following President Kennedy's assassina-

tion the possibility of Cuban involvement was given

serious consideration by United States government re-

presentatives in Mexico City. Cuban complicity was

of particular concern to the American Ambassador,

Thomas Mann. His suspicions were based upon Oswald's

past contacts with both the Cuban and Soviet Consulates

in Mexico City, the allegations of Gilberto Alvarado

Ugarte, and suspect conversations between the Cuban

President Dorticos and the Cuban Ambassador to

sought

himself

Mexico Armas.

Because of Mann's immediate posture

he intervened himself into the United States' in-

vestigation of Oswald's activities in Mexico City.

Both CIA and FBI representatives in Mexico City had

to contend with the Ambassador and probably felt

that his efforts only further complicated an already

complex situation. Therefore, CIA and FBI representa-

tives in Washington, D.C. were able to impress upon

the State Department, particularly Alexis Johnson,

that Mann was not in charge of the investigation

and should be so informed. It is most likely, as

a result, that Mann's statement to this Committee

that his efforts to investigate the possibility of

a Cuban assassination conspiracy were prematurely

cut off reflect the instructions he received from

the

his superiors that the FBI was in charge of Mexico

City investigation necessarily implying to Mann that

he was not. However, the Committee has found no

evidence to support Mann's contention that CIA and

FBI representatives in Mexico City received instruc-

tions to cut off investigations of possible Cuban in-

volvement in the assassination. But it is the Com-

mittee's fontention that both the CIA and FBI were

subject to political considerations created by the

extraordinary circumstances surrounding the assassina-

tion. In particular,

Mann's request that Cuban

plomatic personnel be arrested created an issue

2) The record does reflect that both CIA and FBI re-

presentatives in Mexico City fully cooperated dur-

ing the course of the investigation of Alvarado's

allegation. Nevertheless, the Committee review of

FBI and CIA files tendsto show that by November 27,

1963, prior to Alvarado's interrogation by Mexican

authorities, FBI and CIA doubted Alvarado's vera-

city. As a result, the subsequent investigation of

Alvarado was colored by the CIA and FBI position

that Alvardo was a fabricator. Whether this

stance ultimately affected the resolution of Al-

varado's allegation cannot today be determined.

a) The record further reflects that Ambassador Mann,

following Alvarado's polygraphying by CiA and EBly

reports on December 6 agreeing with the FBI and

CIA position that Alvarado was a fabricator. How-

over, Ambassador Mann persistedein his belief,

though not supported by the evidence, that the Cuban

government was in some manner connected to the

assassination of President Kennedy.

A) From FBI and CIA files reviewed, the record tends

to show that the FBI and CIA investigation in

Mexico City was subject to some jurisdictional

uncertainty. Whereas, with regard to the Alvardo

investigation, it was the FBI's initial stance

that this was a DIA matter, the CIA did not become

actively involved in resolution of the issue until

it had received authorization to do so from the

FBI. However, this concern of proper jurisdictional

authority does not now appear to have impeded in

any manner the substance of the investigation

undertaken by both the FBI and CIA.

It-would have better served the expedition's resolu-

tion: of Alvarado's allegation had-Alvarado been sub-

ject to a polygraph examination prior to December 6,

1963. Such an examination might well have helped to

resolve Alvarado's: contention that Oswald was in Mexico

on September 18, 1963. As the record indicates, Os-

wald's presence in New Orleans on September 18 has

never been definitely established. However, based
