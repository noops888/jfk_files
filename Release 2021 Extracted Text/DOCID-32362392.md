SUBJECT: LEE HARVEY OSWALD CASE

(Address Book)

1.

Reference is made to names in OSWALD's address bool:

which are furnished in an FBI memorandum of 31 December 1963,

which lists portions of the address book found among OSWALD's per-

sonal effects at the time of his arrest in Dallas.

2. On page 45 of OSWALD's address book: (pages 16 and

17 of the FBI's report of 31 December 1963), there appears the notation:

"20575 Sharapov

Minek

Fiouse No. 4, Apt.

UL. KALININA":

247

Tower, Sen - Mind, 1742

This name appears also as: "Comrade Sharapov 20525" on a strip of

paper found in OSWALD's wallet at the time he was interviewed by Lt.

Francis 1. MARTELLO of the New Orleans police.

3. SHARAPOV could conceivably refer to one of several

persons by that name who are referred to in Security Indices:

(1) Lt. Col. Nikolai Georgiyevich SHARAPOV

who is an RIS career officer described as an old-time

Chekist with interrogation experience, who in 1942

was chief of a small counter-espionage section in the

Second Directorate of the NKVD. In 1942 he held the

rank of Captain and as of some time after February

1954 was chief of a section in the Seventh Chief

Directorate, MVD. He is said to have participated

in the arrest of BErIA. SHARAPOV was born about

1909, was married, and as of 1953/54 had a 13 year

old son. He also had daughters aged 7 and 3 by a mistress.

Olga KHOKHLOVA. It should be noted that this SHARAPOV

has a

son about OSWALD's age. In a CIA Information

Report of 24 February 1955 titled, "Organization, Functione

and Personalities of the NKGB, " Nikolay SHARAPOV was

listed as the "Sub Section Chief" of the Surveillance Section

(NN) of the "Independent Sections of the NKGB".

(7 Directorate ?)

(2) According to the 1930 testimony of E. Y.

BELITSKIY aka Yefim BELITSKIY, the father of Boris

Yefimovich BELITSKIY, #175069-SSD, one P. I. SHARAPOV

was at one time a Director of the All-Russian Textile

Syndicate in New York City, as he (E. Y. BELITSKIY)

also had been.

The Syndicate, he said, was actually part

of the Soviet Government and was controlled as such.

See attachment re Boris Y. BELITSKIY.

(3) According to information furnished to the FBI

in 1948 by Mikhail Ivanovich SAMARIN (aka MI. GREGORY),

*Al 116, one Lt. General Andrei Rodionovich SHARAPOY.

of the Soviet Military Staff Committee at the United Nations

(as well as Lt. General Alexander Filippovich VASILIEV)

was involved in Soviet espionage. According to SAMARIN,

he obtained this information during a discussion he had

with Eugene Vasilievich GALAKHOV of the Soviet U. N.

delegation in about June 1948.. According to SAMARIN,

General SHARAPOV took over all the duties of General

VASILIEV. Head of the First Department of Soviet Intelli-

gence in the United States, when the latter departed-

apparently shortly before June 1948.

ATTACTMENE

SUBTECT :

BELITSKIY, Boris Yefimovich 1175059 - SSD

MOSBY, Aline

#172252

According to several sounces Boris Y. Belitskiy is an associate of

Aline Mosby, whose name appeared in Oswald's address book. (Page 61 of

the address bool, which is on page 22 of the FBI memorandum of 31

December 1963. She 1s mentioned also In CI/SIG's cover memorandum

dated 10 January 1964.)

According to Joseph Doyle, SR/2/CE, #56940 SD & SSD, 1n September

1958, Aline Mosby was in direct contact with Boris Y. Belitskiy, a

Russian official at the Brussels World Fair, and "was the center of a

great deal of activity for (hin)"

• Dojile stated that Belitskly, who was

the Head of the British Division of Radio Moscow, had been an interpreter

for the Russians at the Brussels World Fair.

He previously had been in

the United States with his father, who was with AMTORG in the late 1920's/

early 1930's. Doyle said that Belitskiy attended school in New York City

and that the family returned to Russia in 1936 or 1937.

With further reference to Mosby, Doyle noted that there was a direct

relationship between Mosby, Koch (Carl Henry Koch,

#50001) and Volkoff

(George Volkoft,

1152385 - SSD) - all of whom had been of interest with

reference to Belitskly.

Others whom Mosby knew included Alexander Dolberg, 165651 - SSD,

to whom she was introduced by McKinney H. Russell/ 283853 - SSD, still

another who was of interest in connection with Belitskiy.

CI/SIG was advised in late 1958 regaräing the above individuals and

informed that CI/OA was also interested in them.

According to information furnished by Fitzgerald Curtis Smith,

#176178 - SSD, during a debriefing in June 1959, Boris Y. Belltskly, whom

Smith knew in Moscow,

was in great fear of being purged,

father, & Russian Jew, who had once lived in New York."

and trusted no U.S. citizens in Moscow other than

himself (Smith) and Aline Mosby, UPI correspondent in Moscow. Smith aaid

Belitskly met Aline Mosby at the Brussels World Fair in the summer of 1958,

at the same time he met Smith. Smith said he subsequently contacted

Beltskly in Moscow in December 1958, through NBC Correspondent Irvine R.

Levine.

Another who knows, or has linown, Aline losby 1s former Agency employee

George Winters, 155769.

winters stated auring an interview in November/

December 1960, when discussing Americans in Moscow who lived beyond their

means, that newspaperman Harry Schapiro-was a very heavy loser at poker -

to the extent that "one got the impression he was on the Soviet buäget."

Schapiro, he said, had & Russian wife who was more aggressive than he.

Winters added that newspaperwoman Aline Mosby was in Schapiro's office;

and cormented that she "stuch mostly to the Foreign circult rather than

the Embassy circuit.!

He said that she had been in the hospital on several

ocassions during the previous year, so that "one didn't see too much of her"!

and added that according to gossip

one hospitalization was ocassioned by an

abortion.

Another newspaperwoman in Moscow, whom Winters mentioned, was Priscilla

Johnson, #71589-DL.

She has been mentioned in newspaper articles as one who

recalled having come in contact with Lee Harvey Oswald in Moscow, where she

interviewed (or talked) with him. Her name, like Mosby's, was listed in his

address book under her last name only.

Mosby was born on 27 July 1922 in Missoula, Montana; and graduated

from the University of Montana in 1943•

She was employed by United Press

In Seattle, Washington,

from 1943 to 1945, and was Hollywood Correspondent

for UP from 1945 to 1957. According to the UP Bureau Manager at Los Angeles,

she resigned voluntarily in 195T and her employment was satisfactory. Ac-

cording to Confidential informant R-1, during an Agency investigation in the

fall of 1958, she was dropped by UP when she was subpoeaned in connection

with legal suits against Confidential Magazine, for which she had done re-

write work without the knowledge of UP. She went to the Brussels World Fair

as a stringer for the North American Newspaper Alliance. She was considered

Loyal by her associates during the above period; but was described as "the

co-existence type who associates with Russians"

("plays footsie with the

Russians"). No informant questioned her loyalty.

In January 1960, Mosby reportedly was introduced on the Dave Garroway

show, "Today", as NBC News' Correspondent; but in a State Department dis-

patch of 12 December 1960, which listed "Western Correspondents in Moscow"

she was named as representing UPI.

According to HUA records, Mosby dia a motion picture critic type

article for the Daily Worker in 1947; wrote an article for the Daily Worker

at Laguna Beach, California, in 1949; and contributed a column to the daily

Worker on 23 November 1956. According to records of the Civil Service Con-

mission, the Daily Worker of 26 July 1957 and 29 August 1957 carried infor-

mation regarding her.
