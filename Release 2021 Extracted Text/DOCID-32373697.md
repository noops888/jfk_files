DO NOT USE WITHOUT PERMISSION OF LAD/COG.

HANDLE WITH UTMOST CARE.

2. Findings:

a. TDCSDB 3/651,885 dated 25 Oct 1962 filed 68-6-147/4

Minister MOLYAKOV told a Bloc diplomat that he thought

the U.S. action /missile crisis? was an "election affair";

that

President Kennedy discovered that his popularity had dropped and

undertook the Cuban measure to "become the leader again.

b.

GNVA 4357 (OUT 53779) 25 Oct 1962 filed 68-6-147/4

MOLYAKOV commented that the USSR would not let the

American move go without retaliation.

That with this measure he

/President Kennedy? had become the "man of the nation" again, and

the nation was in a state of hysteria behind him.

GIVA 4376 (OUT 53800) 27 Oct 62 filed 201-9239)

At a dinner party on 25 Oct 62 in Geneva attended by

orbit officials, MOLYAKOV reportedly stated that KHRUSHCHEV was

aware that Kennedy was mad, an adventurer, and must not be

allowed to pull strings, meaning, to retain initiative or control

pace in the current international situation.

GNIVA 4470 (OUT 53909) 19 Nov 62 (TDCSDB 2/652,244)

Filed 68-6-14774

SLSTEEL-1 reported the following on the probable

reaction of Fidel CASTRO and his principal associates to the

Soviet withdrawal of offensive missiles from Cuba and to U.S.

demands re the withdrawal of Soviet IL-28 aircraft and on-spot

Source said that CASTRO's vanity was immense and no

matter how it had been explained to him by MIKOYAN or other Soviet

officials, hemust have been furious at the fact that the Soviet

Union had

"backed down" before the U.S, and was negotiating with

the U.S. on an independent basis.

CASTRO must have considered

himself as being in a desperate situation. Source said that

CASTRO was dominated by vanity, had megalomaniacal tendencies, and

possessed a compulsion for revenge which was notorious; on occasion

his compulsion caused him to reach back as far as twenty years to

revenge actions taken against him at that time.

Source added that

in the current situation CASTRO was fully capable of undertaking

an act of desperation, for example the aerial bombardment of the

U.S. or some gross act against the Soviet Ambassador in Cuba.

GNVA: 5006 (OUT 54584) 28 Mar 63 (TDCSDB 3/653,939)

Files 68-6-14774

At the height of the October 62 Cuban crisis, CASTRO

haranged a Soviet commander about the "impossibility" of permitting

U.S. planes to photograph Cuba.

The Soviet succumbed to CASTRO's

persuasiveness and took action which resulted in shooting down a

U-z plane. The Soviet command was furious and the Soviet officer

was teturned to the USSR under arrest.

GWVA 6022 (IN 79271) 12 Dec 63 Filed 68-6-147/3

Report that there was no speculation among orbit

or Soviet officials re implications of Johnson's accession.

There was a special alert status ordered for Cuban Missions

as a result of the assassination of President Kennedy. The alert

was still in effect 9 December 1963-

GIVA: 6029 (OUT 65853) 12 Dec 63 (TDCSDB 3/658,469)

Filed 68-6-147/4

Report that circa 2 days after the assassination

of President Kennedy, Cuban dip missions abroad began to receive

a series of messages placing them on a special alert status.

These messages were obviously due to apprehension by the Cuban

Government that the circumstances surrounding the assassination

of President Kennedy might lead to hostile activity directed

against the missions. They were instructed among other things, to

be certain that there were "no compromising documents on the

premises."

h. GWVA 6313 (IN 30483) 2 March 1964 Filed 201-9239)

INDEVOUT-3 reported at 29 February meeting that

CASTRO was concerned that Johnson would not follow Kennedy's course

which might have lead to negotiations.

KHRUSHCHEV was convinced

that CASTRO's Caribbean P-ace must be strengthened.

/COMMENT: Ref. IG Memo dated 25 April 1967 SECRET

EYES ONLY, Page 112 - Discussion of Assassination at High-Level

Government Meetings. HURWITCH of State, and McGeorge BUNDY, White

House, among others, attended 10 Aug 62 Special Group (Augmented)

meeting at Dept. of State. Bill Harvey attended with McCone for

CIA. Remember Harvey's Mafia contacts.

Also, keep in mind that

Tad SZULC allegedly had access to Hurwitch, both President and

Attorney General Kennedy, and McGeorge Bundy. Could he have

learned or heard of the plot and let the word out? McCone recalled

that liquidation of CASTRO, and other regime officials, was

mentioned at JCS op room meeting 8 or 9 August 1962.

It was

later determined that McCone's recollection was probably faulty,

that assassination came up for discussion at the 10 August State

meeting.7
