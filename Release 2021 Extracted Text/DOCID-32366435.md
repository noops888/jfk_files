9 October 1967

1. Reference is made to the attached 5 June 1967 DCS mao-

randum on Subject, which in ture made reference to previous DCS

memoranda on him on 24 and 25 May 1967 and to an Office of Security

memorandum dated 29 May 1967. The 5 June 1967 memorandum

enclosed copies of several 1963/1964 documents from the Chicago

Field Office's file on CAIN, which ADC/PSD forwarded to SRS with

the comment that 'It appears DCS is cleaning out their files se Lee

Harvey OSWALD, et al."

2. Subject, it is obvious, bad been a source of information

regarding as alleged discussion of the assassination of President

Kennedy at a secret meeting of the Fair Piay for Cuba Committee

held in Chicago in Febraary 1963 under the direction of Richard

CRILEY (#346 116). He also was the source of information regarding

the alleged attempted recruitment into the Communist Party of young

Cubans in the Chicago area by one Guillermo ESCOBAR, who accord-

ing to the Chicago office was "one of Horace SPEED's (SAS) leads ..

obtained from Ralph PEREZ." (Presumably Ralph PEREZ, 4444260)

SPEED is Horace SPEED III, $19949%

The documents also indicated

that in Febraary 1964 CAIN was the subject of a conversation initiated

by Eldon 5. COHEN, $38557 o/c, with a representative of the DCS

Chicago office who believed his purpose was to learn whether or, not

CAIN was in fact on a two-month's sick leave from the COOK County

Sherilf'e office, as he was said to be, or was on a political under

> a phongs of gubernatorial candidate Charles H. PERCY and othe

cover assigiment which CHHEN inferred involved tapping the tele-

3. During review of CAIN's Security file, I noted a message

regarding him from Mexico City, on 25 April 1962, which mentioned

a "Willard ANDREWS, reputable American businessman in Mexico,"

who obviously had had contact of some kind with CAIN, as well as with

a ClA representative in Mexico to whom ANDREWS had commented that

GAIN claims to have been with OSS during W. W. Il (A copy of this memo-

randum is attached); In answer to this message which requested traces

on CAIN, Headquarters, in furnishing limited information obtained regard-

ing him, advised that neither his claimed employment by OSS, sor a claim

he made to have worked with Task Force W, could be substantiated. The

Station was advised that he did have (or had had) a legitimate detective

laboratory in Chicago.

4. With reference to Willard ANDREWS, Security indices contain

no record. I belleve the individual referred to is Wyllye ANDREWS,

(Edward) Wyllys ANDREWS IV, $2769, a fosmes OSS/CIA employee who

has lived in Mexieo for many years and has continued to have social con-

tacts with representatives of this Agency in Mexico as well as with Agency

employees from Headquarters who visit him from time to time. ANDREWS,

like CAIN, was bore in Chicago of parents who also were born in the general

area of Chicago.

5. The firs time CAIN came to the attention of the Security Office

was when the Mexico Station requested traces on him. Their request

stemmed from an unannounced visit he made to the Station, during which

he stated that he had an investigative agency in Mexico with branches in

Chicago and Los Angeles. He had also stated that his agency in Mexico

was for the purpose of training Mexican Government agents in police

methods, in investigative techniques, and in the use of the lie detector;

and had added that he was investigating Communism in a certain unnamed

Central American country.

6. In June 1962, the Mexico Station advised that CAIN was being

deported by the Mexican Ministry (of) Gobernacion for these violations:

a. Carrylag a loaded revolver and brass knuckles

b. Impersonating a Mexican Government official

(He had identification as an investigator for the

Mexican Treasury Office.)

c. Violating his tourist permit by working at his

detective office and at the Mexican Treasury

7. Subject tas subsequently of intarest to the DCS in September

1963 when an ad hos ciearance was requested to permit his being asked

to respond to general requirements regarding his knowledge of certain

Suban refugees and their potential for foreign positive intelligence. On

10 September 1963, the DCS was sent a memorandum which furnished

much of the above information on CAIN.

8. On 22 May 1967, the Director of Security indicated that he

had received information from the FBI which ties Subject to the Maia

in Chicago; and he directed that the DCS be contacted for information

as to whether or not they ever established contact with him and, li so,

May 1967, the DCS advised that theze had been no contact with GAIN

since 1963, and furnished copies of eight reports for which Subject had

been the source of information. These had to do with anti-Castro Cuban

activities, procurement of arms, etc.

9. On 29 May 1967, Security advised the DCS that there is a

current FBI investigative interest in Subject and recommended that

there be no further contact with him at this time.

10. The l September 1967 copy of Life magazine contains an

article titled Brazen Empire of Organized Crime," in which it is

stated that Sam GIANCANA, Head of the Chicago Cosa Nostra, is ''still

running things by remote control from a hide-out in Mexico... where

he poses as Ricardo SCALZETTI. The seal SCALZETTI, GIANCANA'S

erst while chauffeur and courier, is more familiar to Chicagoans as

Richard CAIN, a well known former Chicago policeman and more recently

& private investigator."

11. Eidon S. COHEN who de mentioned in paragraph 2 of this

memorandum as having evidenced an interest in CAIN during the guber-

natorial campaiga of the now Senator ({rom Illinois) Charles H. PERCY,

$178329 and #EE-21773, is now PERCY's Executive Assistant. COHEN,

who became employed by PERCY is January 1964, following his resigna-

tion from CIA which was effective 31 December 1963, at the time he con-

tacted a representative of the Chicago Office of DCS regarding CAIN on

10 February 1964, did not indicate that he was employed by PERCY. He

said, rather, that he'd been asked by the "PERCY for Governor" people

to inquire as to CAIN's status.

12. During the timo COHEN was a CIA employee (1949-1963), he

was of concern to the security Oifice, due principally to the activitias

and proclivities of hia wife, Rita G. Heller COHEN, #MS-3185, the for-

mer wiie of Irving ROTH, EMS-2001 R. COHEN was the subject of ar

Employment Review Board case in 1956; and in 1956 was disqualifled

a9 a memper of the Junior Career Development Programa. It was then

decided to put him on a job in FBIS in which he would not be exposed to

higbly sensitive material. At the time of his resizuation, he was an

I. O. Contact, GS-14, in the Chicago Office of the DDI/00 Contact

Division.

13. In January 1965, the ICS requested approval to contact

COHEN on an ad hoc basis to participate in the briefing and debriating

of his employer, Senator PERCY, who planned an extensive tour of the

Far East. In June 1967, Ms. Georzo CARY, Legislative Counsel,

requested a check on COHEN stating that there may be occasion to brief

hira from tima to tima. According to Mr. CARY, COHEN would bu

briefed generally on the build up in Cuba but would not be exposed to

operational information or exotic material.

15. There is attachad a copy of the abova referred to September

articies in Life magazine, in one of which CAIN is described as the erat-

while chauffeur and courier of Sam GIANCANA. The second of these

articles makes reference to alleged iriendly contasts of Jim GARRISCN.

of the OSWALD Case, with henchmen of the Coga Nostra in the Lcuisiana

area.
