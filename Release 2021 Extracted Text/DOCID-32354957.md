Raymond A. Warren

Chief, Latin America Division

SLHORIZON-1 Report Mentioning Cuban

Minister-Counsellor Statement on the

Assassination of President Kennedy

1A/ C0/235-77 Dated 30 September 1977

1. The referent memorandum reported information from

a ZRWAHOO intelligence report of a statement made by the

Minister-Counsellor (MC) of the Cuban Embassy

in kingston,

Jamaica, on 24 September 1977, that

"Cuban exiles such as

DIAZ Lan (fnu) (sic) and others had been' involved in the

assassination of President John

F. Kennedy."

We believe

that this could refer either to

Pedro DIAZ Lanz, or his

brother Marcos DIAZ Lanz, formerly Chief and Deputy Chief,

respectively, of the Cuban Revolutionary Air Force.

Both

entered the U.S. from Cuba as exiles in mid-1959.

Since

that time the DIAZ Lanz brothers

reportedly have been

closely associated with, and involved in numerous activities

with, Frank STURGIS (aka FIORINI) of Watergate fame.

The

Agency assisted in the evacuation of Marcos, and Pedro

entered the U.S. on his own.

Although both were debriefed

by the Agency, there

indication that they were ever

considered Agency assets.
