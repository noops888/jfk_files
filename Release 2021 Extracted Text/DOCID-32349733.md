While

Juan MIGUEL de MORA has been consistently pro-leit, and anti-Mexican

Government, and has had contact with Soviet Embassy officials in

Mexico Clty, there has been no indication that he has any good

high-level government connections (other than what might be routine

press access).

There was one meeting (reported in HMMA-13323,

17 July 1959)

among HAGUEL de MORA, Pavel YATSKOV (201-120123), then

stationed with the Soviet Eubassy in mexico.

The following points,

which in the Station's opinion make Dolores

offered for Headquarters consideration:

director and owner of 'Nueva Provincia,
