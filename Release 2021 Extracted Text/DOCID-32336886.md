of information obtained during initial interview conducted

on 2/14/61, were contained in referenced San Antonio airtel

to Bureau,

2/17/61.

All interviews of the subject were

conducted by SAS CLAY ZACHRY, JR. and JESSE R. HAGY.

SA T-I, mentioned in the enclosed letterhead

memorandum, is CAMILO PADREDA VASQUEZ, former member

of the Cuban Bureau for the Repression of Communist

Activities, who furnished the information to the Legal

Attache, Madrid, per letter 7/29/60, from

Service, who furnished the information on 12/28/60,

to the Legal Attache, Paris. (See Legal Attache, Paris,

letter to Director,

1/11/61, captioned, "ELOY GUTIERREZ

MENOYO, aka, IS - CUBA")

The subject appeared completely cooperative

during the interviews and at no time refused to answer

questions.

It was the opinion of interviewing agents

that GUTIERREZ probably told the truth with regard to

the bulk of the information furnished by him, and that

if he did distort any information, or lie about any

and his alleged connections with anti-FRANCO and anti-

SALAZAR activities. It was noted that GUTIERREZ corroborated

almost in full information which was developed by the Bureau

at the time he visited the United States in the fall of

1959, and that numerous other items of information fur-

nished by him appeared to corroborate information de-

veloped concerning him by the Miami Office.
