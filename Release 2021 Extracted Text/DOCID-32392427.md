On 7 August 1963 the Station EE case officer requested LIENVOY coverage of

the Yugoslav lines: Arrangements are being made to put these lines in within

the near future.

3. Processing of LIENVOY Information.

The Station continues to receive full transcripts in Spanish from ten

lines (five Cuban Embassy and five Soviet Embassy). DIR-60764 dated

13 August 1963 asked the Station to send to Headquarters one copy of the full

transcripts from the Cuban Embassy lines. These are being forwarded on a

weekly basis. The first group is being forwarded as an attachment to HMMA-22000

dated 21 August 1963. If they do not please Headquarters officers who desire

them, it is requested that the Mexico Station be promptly advised with any

suggestions for changes.

On 6 August 1963 Orville HORSFALL, staff agent, arrived, in Mexico

to work presently as a unilateral monitor but eventually as the supervisor of

a tap center either under LIENVOY or LITEMPO. He has established himself

outside and is presently at work eliminating the backlog of Soviet tapes.

Douglas J. FEINGLASS continues to do the Russian from LIENVOY,

the Russian from two LIFEAT lines on Soviet targets, and the Russian from

the LIPAWN audio operation. In addition, FEINGLASS sends clipped transcripts

to the Station ready for 201 files.

4. Exploitation of LIENVOY Information.

HMMW -11831 dated 6 August 1963 indicated that Headquarters was

not well informed on the way the Mexico Station exploits operational leads from

LIENVOY. The outside staff agent, Arnold AREHART has instructions to alert

the Station immediately if a U.S. citizen or English speaking person tries to

contact any of the target installations. This is done by a telephone call from

outside the tap center at a pay phone to Robert B. RIGGS inside the Station..

Emergency meetings are arranged in double talk (meeting for coffee or lunch).

RIGGS meets AREHART within fifteen minutes at a pre-arranged downtown

location and receives the reel with an extract of the pertinent conversation.

The reel is then taken to the Station and given to the case officer responsible

for the target the person was trying to contact. Headquarters is notified by

cable of the action taken. Only in rare cases is information on a U.S. citizen

passed without prior Headquarters approval.

Other leads appear in the full transcripts or daily resumen. They

also are exploited by the Station' case officer responsible for the target where

the lead appears. For example, on 12 August 1963 Boris KAZANTSEV,

recently arrived Counselor of the Soviet Embassy and former defection target

in Mexico, called his wife at their residence. The number was not listed but

was immediately checked by Raymond GERENDE who determined that the

number was the switchboard of theapartment house where KAZANTSEV and

several other families live. The reason the Station checked out this number

was to put unilateral coverage on it if possible; however, the switchboard was

beyond the Station's capability tohandle.

Maryknoll priest Felix McGOWAN contacted the Cuban Embassy on

31 July 1963. MEXI-5565 reported details of this contact. This cable was sent

to Headquarters for dissemination and action by ODENVY.

Professor WEBB (fnu) of the University of' Louisiana contacted Mexican

Communist Jorge L. TAMAYO Castillejos, prominent Mexican Marxist intel-

lectual and professor at the University of Mexico, and arranged to meet with

him on 31 July 1963. MEXI-5568 reported this contact to Headquarters for

dissemination and action by ODENVY.

Bartolo (fnu) contacted former Governor of Baja California, Braulio

MALDONADO Sandez on 16 July 1963 regarding the sale of Cuban pesos. MEXI-5569

reported this contact to Headquarters for dissemination and action by ODENVY.

5. Liaison

On 15 August 1963 Willard C. CURTIS met with LITENSOR to arrange

for a sensitive PBRUMEN case (MEXI-5789 reported the details of this meeting).

6. Security

There were no security incidents within the project during this month.

7: Technical

There were no technical problems during this period.

8. Personnel

Orville HORSFALL's arrival is the only change in personnel since the

last report and he is handled as an independent agent by the Station, with no

LIENVOY personnel aware of his presence in Mexico. Robert B. RIGGS sees

HORSFALL daily to deliver and pick up tapes.

9. Production

There is attached a list of reports, cables and dispatches forwarded

to Headquarters during this month.
