FROM

Deputy Director for Plans

SUBJECT: MUSGROVE, Joe Bailey

I.

The following paragraphs summarize informa-

tion relayed telepaonically to the Bureau, and are

forwarded to you for confirmation and for your files.

On 28 April 1968, our representative in

Addis Ababa reported that Doctor Klaus Steer, a

West German citizen and Director of the African

Scientific Department,

E. Merck Aktiengesellschaft,

Karmstady, Germany, visited the American Embassy,

at the request of the local German Ambassador, and

reported that he had seen a man in Lagos, Nigeria

on 23 April 1968 who strongly resembled newspaper

photographs of Eric Stavro Galt, who is currently

wanted in connection with the assassination of

Dr. Martin Luther King.

Dr. Steer said that he saw

the Subject at the desk of

the Bristol Hotel on the

afternoon of 23 April when both were checking out

of the hotel.

Dr. Steer was accidentally given the

hotel accounting receipt for the Subject, on which

he noted "Name: Joe dusgaque,.

Room No:

403, Receipt

No: D 52138,

Account No:

08325.

" In a short con-

versation with Subject, Dr. Steer learned that Subject

was employed by the "Wilder Oil Company" and was en-

route to Warri, Nigeria on an 18 month contract.

Subject told Dr. Steer that he had recently arrived

in Lagos from Las Palmas via Accra on Nigerian Airlines.

The above information as relayed to the

Bureau upon receipt by our duty officer on 29 April

1968.
