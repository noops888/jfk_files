Date: August 2, 2021

From: National Archives and Records Administration

Subject: Reconstructed FBI File SF 62-6887, Serials 1-51

To: The File

This memorandum briefly summarizes the status of missing original Federal Bureau of

Investigation (FBI) case files or portions of case files in the President John F. Kennedy

Assassination Records Collection (JFK Collection) and documents the National Archives and

Records Administration's (NARA) efforts to reconstruct these records, where possible, from

duplicate copies of documents located in other FBI files.

As the JFK Collection was first compiled and reviewed in the 1990s, the Assassination Records

Review Board and the FBI designated some records as "not believed relevant" (NBR) or "not

assassination related" (NAR). The FBI retained custody of the NBR/NAR records and

postponed their transfer to NARA until a later date. Every document or group of documents

("serials"), however, received an indexed Record Identification Form (RIF) and FBI inventory

sheet for insertion into the JFK Collection.

In September 2011, several years prior to the 2017 re-review and transfer of the NBR/NAR

material to the National Archives, a flood severely damaged thousands of feet of records at the

FBI's Alexandria Records Center in Alexandria, Virginia. In June 2012, NARA approved the

FBI's request for emergency destruction of 10,000 cubic feet of records that posed significant

airborne health hazards. Among the damaged records were FBI field office files that contained

postponed JFK Collection material designated as "pertaining to a matter unrelated to the JFK

Assassination Investigation" or "not assassination related.":

This compilation represents NARA's efforts to reconstruct the original file or portions of the file,

as completely as possible, with duplicate copies of documents located in the FBI field office and

headquarters files within the JFK Collection. Each reconstructed file or compilation contains a

Record Identification Form, an explanatory cover memo, existing administrative documents

available within the JFK Collection, and copies of identified duplicate documents. The table

below summarizes the status of FBI file SF 62-6887, Serials 1 through 51.

to do with the Black Panthers.

You inguired if I recalled a

the Director, FBI, to the SAC, San Francisco, which suggested

aisruptive techniques against

the Black Panthers and which

mentioned spurious police or FBI reports.

I advised you I

had no first hand recollection of having seen such a document

at that time, but that I had read a recent neus iten describ

ing such a document.

You also indicated an interest in the theoretical question as

to whothor intolligence functions should be divorced from

enforcoment functions in order to avoid the dilemma of dis

closure versus dismissal, and you suggested that my views on

this might be helpful in educating the Committee.

1971.

I sarved as supervisor of a squad of agents which investigated,

among other matters, violations and alleged violations of law

by the Black Panthers.

The only information I have concerning

the Black Panthers was learned as a direct result of my official

duties. I have made no independent study of them, nor do I

have any personal files or written material, either official

or othorwise, relating to them.

Since speaking with you, I have reviewed Ixecutive Order #501-73

(28 C.F.R.$S 16.21, 16.22 and 16.23) which specifies that no

employee or former employee of the Department of Justice shall

Berkeley, California 94704

Dear Mr. Jones:

As you

are aware, I have been concerned for some time about the nature of the

Bureau's involvement in local law enforcement affairs.

This concern has been

heightened by my appointment to the House Select Committee to Investigate the

U. S. Intelligence Community. In this light, I am requesting answers to the

following questions concerning FBI activity in Berkeley:

1. What is the size of the contingent of agents in the Berkeley field office?

2. What are the functional responsibilities in the field office, and what are

the percentages of agents involved in each, i.e., political, drug abuse,.

criminal, etc.?

3.

What are the titles of the agents, and how do these relate to their

involvement

in category two?

4. What is the ethnic and sexual breakdown of the staff and agents in the

Berkeley field office?,

What are the interactions and working relationships between the field

office, the Berkeley Police Department, the University of California

Police Department, private security agencies and informers? How many

informers are utilized by the field office?

6.

Recent disclosures have raised serious questions regarding the Bureau's

involvement in political surveillance activities of organizations and

individuals over the past several years. What actions has the local

field office taken to correct the abuses of these actions, and what

political surveillance is being undertaken?

DATE

MI. Clarence M. Kelley

Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation

Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Kelley:

On this date Supervisor Berryman of the San Fran-

cisco Office read to me a teletype to the effect the Bureau

approved a

secrecy release for me to respond to questions

Senate Investigator Lester B. Seidel in connection with

& Senate Select Committee on Internal Security Investigation

of the CoIntelpro as it related to the Black Panther Party.

¿ copy of a letter from me to Mr. Seidel has been furnished

to the Bureau previously.

At the time I was designated supervisor of the squad

handling internal security investigations of the Black Panther

Party (BPP), the BPP was international In scope; Eldridge

Cleaver and

others had been granted asylum in Algeria; the

BPP had support and/or branches in France, Germany, Scandinavia

Aspects of the counter intelligence program

approved by the Bureau of which I am aware were directed against

Bone BPP foreign operations.

thus, interrogation by the Senate

investigator may Involve Information disseminated to other

government agencies

under security classification and may

touch on foreign policy as well.

Therefore, prior to furnishing information obtained

In an official capacity to Mr. Seidel, who according to the

Bureau's teletype will be in San Francisco In about two weeks,

I would like written confirmation of the release which was

furnished me orally, preferably an official document covering

any secrecy agreement made with the Bureau as well as releasing

me fron the provisions of any applicable executive orders which

oreclude disclosure of official information without approval of

the Attorney General or an authorized Departmental officer.

I would also appreciate being advised 1f there 1s any limitation

on the scope of the material which I may release.

Since the Bureau's teletype also approved a secrecy

release for current SAC Charles Bates,

this presupposes he

authorized to furnich Mr. Seidel with the contents of

files 1f Mr. Seidel so requests.

Therefore, I would also

appreciate advice as to whether I will be permitted to refresh

my recollection by reviewing official files prior to or during

the Interview with Mr. Seidel.

Sincerely yours,

FOR THE INFORMATION OF FBI HEADQUARTERS IT HAS NOT BEEN THE

PRACTICE TO UTILIZE A CONIROL FILE FOR

ARE WORKED FROM THE SUBSTANTIVE FILE. THEREFORE, THERE IS NO

PRACTICAL METHOD TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF MAIL COVERS THAT MAY

HAVE BEEN PLACED IN YEARS PAST. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT

AVAILABLE AS AN INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUE BETWEEN 1964 AND 1973, THE

JOTAL NUMBER SINCE 1960 WOULD NOT BE LARGE. THERE FOLLOWS SPECIFIC

RESPONSE FROM SAN FRANCISCO FILES TO REQUESTS IN REFERENCED

THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE GUS SURVEY WAS TO ATTEMPT TO

LOCATE AND UNCOVER SOVIET ILLEGAL AGENTS. THE SURVEY INVOLVED

THE EXAMINATION OF ALL FIRSI CLASS MAIL ENVELOPES ARRIVING AT THE

RINCON ANNEX POST OFFICE WHICH ORIGINATED FROM WASHINGTON, D.C.,

OR NEW YORK CITY. THE ENVELOPES ONLY WERE SCANNED FOR CHARACTER-

ISTICS WHICH WOULD INDICATE THAT THEY COULD HAVE ORIGINATED FROM A

SUVIET ILLEGAL SUPPORI AGENT AND POSSIBLY BE DIRECTED TO AN ILLEGAL

SOVIET AGENT IN THE SAN FRANCISCO AREA.

THE SURVEY WAS BASED ON INFORMATION DEVELOPED CONCERNING

COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTED FROM KNOWN ILLEGAL SUPPORT AGENTS ATTACHED

TO SOVIET ESTABLISHMENTS IN NEW YORK AND WASHINGION, D.G., TO

SOVIET ILLEGAL AGENTS RESIDING IN THE UNITED STATES. PREVIOUS

ANALYSIS OF MAIL COMMUNICATIONS FROM SOVIET ILLEGAL SUPPORT AGENTS

TO SOVIET ILLEGALS OPERATIONG IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE 1960°S

REVEALED THAT PRIMARY CHARACTERISTICS ON SUSPECT ENVELOPES WERE:

1. LACK OF RETURN ADDRESS.

2• TYPEWRITTEN ADDRESS IN BLOCK FORM.

3. USE OF LINCOLN S. D4 STAMPS.

4. USE OF "BUSINESS SIZE" WHITE OR BROWN ENVELOPES.

DURING THE SURVEY PERIOD, MORE THAN 1,101,88D ENVELOPES WERE

SCANNED AND 83 INVESTIGATIONS WERE INITIATED. / ALL 83 INVESTIGATIONS

11:15 A.M. by lester B. Seidel, Investigator for sso..

Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activites

The interview took place at the Holiday Inn on Van Ness

Avenue, San Francisco.

Mr. Seidel mentioned that he was serving as a

counsel for the SSC, investigating

• all phases of the United

States

intelligence

community, and he had chosen the Black

Panther Party and the Counterintelligence Program (COINTEL)

as his field. He stated that he was hoping for full

cooperation on the part of the former Special Agent.

He was advised, that former Special Agent Conendet

was willing to cooperate

with the committee and he trusted

that something constructive would come out of the effort

being put forward.

Former Special Agent Cohendet also

pointed out that in his opinion the Black Panther Party (BPP)

nad. been a group devoted to violence, thievery, and fraud,

and the committee should realize the type of Subjects with

whom they are dealing in order to place the investigation

In Its proper framework.

The first

question concerned the former Special

Agent's background and Bureau service. This was

briefly

furnished.

Seidel then asked when and how the technical

surveillances had been installed, who initiated them, and

who approved them.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA WILLIAM A. COHENDET BY

SSC STAFF MEMBER

The former Special Agent replied that he was

not party to any of these arrangements and did not know

any of the details.

Seidel then asked if former Special Agent

Cohendet knew the origin and purposes of the COINTEL

Program. He was informed that the former Agent did not

know the origin of the program, and said he believed its

purposes were those as set forth in the instructions which

Seidel had and which spoke for themselves.

Agent admitted that said program at one time had been

assigned to him but due to the press of other functions,

he had been unable to give it a great deal of time and

felt that during the period that it had been assigned to

him, it

had been largely ineffective.

Seidel then asked if there was any connection

between

ELSUR and COINTEL and the reply was given that

obviously there would be if the ELSUR material being

reviewed could be considered as having any

pertinence to

a COINTEL operation.

However, former Special Agent Cohendet

could not recall having used this material while the case

was assigned to him, at least to any significant degree.

Not having the files available made it impossible to

state positively if there had been any specific instance of use

of this material.

Seidel asked as to the possible effectiveness of

anonymous letters and he was informed that in the opinion

of the former Agent,

such letters, particularly having to

do with personal infidelity or thievery, which were the

usual

suggested avenues, would have little effect on the

recipients who were active in such fields themselves much

of the time.

In the more serious areas of perhaps trying

to falsely show that an individual was

an FBI or police

informant,

the former Special Agent said that the use of

this technique would not be used for fear of causing bodily

harm or death to an innocent person due to the well-known

propensity of the BPP of dealing harshly with any suspected

deviator let alone informant.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA WILLIAM A. COHENDET BY

SSC STAFF MEMBER

Seidel then asked as to the value of ELSUR to

the BPP investigation and the former Special Agent stated

that in his belief it was extremely valuable in many ways.

For instance, it assisted and gauged the true Huey Newton,

his plans, and weaknesses. It was also valuable in esti-

mating the possible effect of a certain COINTEL program

as possibly suggested by some other office.

As a result:

of their information,

the San Francisco Office usually

rejected most

suggestions as being unlikely to be successful.

Seidel wondered if ELSUR was not the most

valuable, single investigative aid that the Bureau had had

in this investigation, and the former Special Agent agreed

that he was probably correct.

Seidel then wondered if the COINTEL proposalsi

should be part of some legislation proposed by Congress

and the former Special Agent replied that the Bureau

officials, in his opinion, should be allowed to comment

on this because the fact that the program would be ineffective

against the BPP might not be a valid argument that it would

not work to better advantage in other circumstances.

Former Special Agent Cohendet declined to

comment on the effectiveness of COINTEL as used against

the Socialist Workers Party, not having had any experience

with its use in that field.

Seidel then asked about informants and asked if

there had been any pressure from the Bureau in the develop-

ment of such sources.

Former Special Agent Cohendet

acknowledged that there certainly had been great pressure

in this direction,

as it was well known that informants were

a necessary part of any investigation and a police organi-

zation

can never give up on this phase of its work no matter

how difficult the circumstances were in their development.

In the case of the BPP, the development of informants was

particularly difficult because of the fear that many persons

in the black community felt concerning the BPP as well as

the lack of desire to cooperate against another black

person.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA WILLIAM A. COHENDET BY

Seidel asked about foreign funds being raised

and given to the BPP, and former Special Agent Cohendet

recalled that "Masai" Hewitt and others went to Sweden

and other countries where the BPP raised money on speech

making tours.

Seidel then asked about any investigation

BPP funds and former Special Agent Cohendet said that it

was his recollection that investigation of BPP funds had

been undertaken through legal channels but he had no

personal knowledge of the investigation and declined to

go further into this field.

Seidel asked about referrals of Bureau information

to the Internal Revenue Service and former Special Agent

Cohendet said that he had no personal knowledge of what

had been done in this direction.

Seidel then asked about the affair between

Actress Jean Seberg and "Masai" Hewitt, which had appeared

in a Hollywood gossip column and had alleged that Seberg

had become pregnant by Hewitt.

Seidel said that the Los

Angeles Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation had

admitted leaking this information to someone in the press.

Former Special Agent Cohendet knew that this

couple had been lovers. for a brief period but denied any

knowledge of any leak to the press by either San Francisco

or Los Angeles.

Seidel asked if the former Agent thought that

leaking this type of information was appropriate. No

comment was offered as to this question.

Seidel, at the conclusion of the interview, said

that he had noted that the "faking" of police records as

suggested had never been undertaken and he observed that he

believed the COINTEL abuses were being overplayed by the

From what he

learned in interviews in San Francisco,

it seemed to him that the program had been mostly played

down and indeed, an independent judgment had been exercised

in the implementation of the program.

A general discussion of the BPP ensued in which

former Special Agent Cohendet reiterated the criminal

background and threatening attitude of many of the BPP

members, their mendacious ways, and their lack of credi-

bility in their public statements.

The former Special

Agent credited the news media with helping to build up

the BPP beyond its actual strength and influence.

Seidel asked about the former Agent's knowledge of

for the removai of former SAC Harry Morgan

"from San-

Francisco. He said the only reason he was asking

this

question was in order to avoid embarrassing former SAC

Morgan when he interviews him concerning his possible.

knowledge of Bpp activities sometime in the future.

Former

Special Agent Cohendet had no knowledge as to why

Mr. Morgan was transferred.

In summation, Seidel ventured the opinion that he

thought the ELSUR technique was far more valuable in the

carrying out of the investigation of the BPP than the

COINTEL. Former Special Agent Cohendet had to agree

to the

above observation.

Former Special Agent Cohendet was not advised

of any rights that he might have in declining to answer

any questions and Seidel said he was actually seeking

witnesses for

a possible hearing in Washington, D.C.

He

stated that no names would be mentioned in any write-up

he would make concerning his interviews.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA ALBERT P. CLARK

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

On August 13, 1975, former Special Agent Albert P.

Clark, who was a supervisor in the San Francisco FBI Office

and who retired in December of 1969, advised as follows:

He was interviewed in his home at 66 Elm,

Larkspur, California, by SSC Member Lester B. Seidel from

5:40 P.M. to 6:55 P.M., August 12, 1975.

Clark was not placed under oath and no mention

was made of his rights. However, Seidel was pleasant and

in no way antagonistic. The interview was general, not

penetrative, not in depth, and very few specific questions were

asked.

There appeared to

be no discernible criticism of

either the Counterintelligence Program (COINTEL) or the

Bureau's investigation of

the Black Panther Party (BPP) by

Seidel.

Seidel was compelled on more than one occasion

to declare that he was pro-FBI, that the object of his

inquiries was to assist the United States Senate in under-

standing the problem in order that

they could consider

possible legislation that may eliminate any abuses in the

Future.

Seidel did mention the fact several times that

information had been leaked to the press that Jane Seberg,

the movie actress, had become pregnant by a BPP official.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA ALBERT P. CLARK

Seidel finally asked Clark if he would have okayed

a COINTEL proposal like this and he answered that he would

have if he felt that it would have sufficiently hindered

the BPP, stating that possibly in some of these occasions

someone might get hurt but on the other hand, investigation

of the BPP by the FBI might be made easier and it might

also cut down on the number of BpP supporters.

Clark was asked to whom the main BPP case was

assigned and to whom COINTEL had been assigned in the San

Francisco Division. Clark replied that he did not remember

but possibly during the time of his supervision, more than

one Agent. had handled the matters.

Seidel asked how many BPP informants the San

Francisco Division had.

Clark replied he did not recall

because he did not believe that Seidel had a right to know.

am

Seidel inquired about the BPP wire tap, asking

who had requested the tap, the Bureau or the San

Francisco

Division.

Again, Clark replied that he did not recall but

the San

Francisco Division would not have necessarily

waited for the Bureau to initiate the matter but might have

requested the Bureau rather than the Bureau having initiated

the matter:

Seidel wanted to have an example of a COINTEL

proposal.

He was not given a specific example but general

conversation was had to the effect that any move that might

be suggested

that would aid the San Francisco Division

in

their investigation of the BPP in determining their

supporters and financiers and possibly disenchanting those

individuals might be an example.

Seidel did not ask Clark whether he had done a

particular

thing.

Questioned concerning whether he felt COINTEL had

been effective, Clark replied he did not believe the matter

was susceptible to proof but the BPP had sure gone into a

steep decline.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA ALBERT P. CLARK

SSC STAFF MEMBER

Seidel again brought up the Seberg matter and

asked if it had done any good. Clark stated he replied,

"Maybe."

During this conversation, Clark got the general

impression that perhaps Seidel did not feel that COINTEL

had been necessary but Clark had argued that it had made

the BPP more difficult to operate and possibly easier

for the FBI to investigate.

Seidel then

wanted to know what there was about

the BPP that caused such a concentration of FBI investi-

gative attention.

Clark pointed out that this woûld have

to be answered in the context of time, that at the time the

program was initiated, there was no doubt that the BPP

a violent, racist organization opposing all law enforce-

ment, attacking officers and generally disturbing the

tranquility of the community.

Seidel then went on to discuss the business of

pressure.

Had Special Agent in Charge Charles W. Bates

and the Bureau put too much pressure on the matter? Clark

stated there was undoubtedly pressure because everyone

was interested in doing the best type job possible and

finding out everything possible concerning the BPP. There

Bureau, in a case like this, could never be satisfied.

Clark stated that he related that perhaps too much

pressure had come from the Bureau because he had felt at

the time he was a supervisor that San Francisco Division

knew more about the BPP than the Bureau.

On the other

hand, he related that Bureau officials were probably

under pressure because of the national interest and the

demands on them in Washington.

Seidel related that he was interested in ascer-

taining what Agent would make the best witness to appear

in Washington to explain and testify concerning COINTEL.

He specifically requested Clark's recommendation and mentioned

the names of Special Agents Leo S. Brenneisen of San

Francisco and Bob Baker of Los Angeles.

Clark stated that

he had countered by suggesting that somebody in Washington

who directed the program and approved all proposals might

be a better witness.

Clark

recalled that near the first of the inter

view, Seidel probably, more to make conversation than to

obtain information, asked a few questions concerning US

and the Republic of North Africa (RNA) .

He was advised

that US had not been active in this division and there

had

been no pertinent RNA activity brought to his attention.

attentionisco

Seidel asked if Ron Karenga of US had visited San Francisco

and Clark replied he had no exact recollection of this.

Seidel talked and asked Clark's opinion on the

separation into different agencies of the Bureau's criminal

and security investigations.

Clark stated that he told

Seidel that in the past he had considered this and felt that

frankly it might have advantages, and at the same time,

might have disadvantages.

He pointed out that the

disadvantages were that you could not be sure that it, in

fact, would work and that if you remove the security

investigations from the Bureau, you would undoubtedly

lose a

great deal, including public support.

seidel asked if Clark had worked under former

SAC Harry- Morgan.

He advised that he had retired prior to - -

the time Morgan was assigned tö the San Erancisco Division...

Clark pointed out that during the interview, a

recorder appeared prominently on his desk, and Seidel.

coula, of course, not be sure that it was not in operation,

although as the duration of the interview lengthened, it

must have been obvious to Seidel that it was not operating.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

SA DAVID E. TODD

On August 12l 1975 retired former SA David E. Todd

was interviewed from 1:00 p.m. to 2:30 p.M. by Lester B. Seidel,

Investigator for the SSC.

The interview took place at the

Holiday Inn,

San Francisco.

By way of background,

in'all contacts with Seidel

previously, former SA Todd has indicated to him great reluctance

to discuss

these matters without clearance from the Bureau,

and pointed out to Seidel that the Bureau had released former

SA Todd from the Employment Secrecy Agreement for the purpose

of a staff interview, but Seidel was told that former sA Toda

did not think it was either his

responsibility or his prerogative

to provide information or make information public; that while

employed he was acting as an Agent of the Federal Government

and felt it was the responsibility of the Federal Government to

provide the information, and that if the Senate Committee

desired information from former SA Todd, the questions should

have been submitted to him in writing, and his answers should

have been made in writing and first forwarded to the FBI, and

then after the FBI determined it advisable to make these answers

available to the Committee, that would have been the proper

channel.

Seidel pointed out the Committee and the Bureau had

made an agreement whereby the Bureau would make Agents available

to the Committee for interview. Former SA Todd pointed out to

Seidel that he is not in the category of an Agent, being a

retired Agent, and at this point there was no additional discussion

on this matter.

Seidel was also told that nothing that was said by

former SA Todd should be interpreted as being critical of

the Counterintelligence Program' (COINTEL) itself, and that if

the Bureau felt that such a Program was necessary in the interest

of national defense, he had carried it out in the best way he

saw fit, and that in recommending against specific proposals

as being impractical or inadvisable, these recommendations were

against the specific incidents recommended and not against the

Program as a whole.

Seidel's first questions dealt with former SA Todd's

background and the extent of his Bureau service, and whether

he had worked security or criminal matters.

Former SA Todd

gave him chronologically the offices in which he had served

in the Bureau, and stated he had been

associated from 1952 to

1956 with the

• Domestic Intelligence Division, Washington, D.C.,

and had become Supervisor in San Francisco in December, 1969,

of the Black Panther Party (BPP), and that during his Bureau

he had

worked both criminal and security matters.

Seidel asked the name of the squad which was originally

the Racial Squad, and subsequently changed to Extremist Matters,

and he asked whether the work was strictly intelligence, or

whether it combined

intelligence or criminal work.

It was

pointed

out Bombing Matters were originally being handled on

this squad for a period of time, and that both the criminal

activities of the Panthers, as well as intelligence activities,

were combined

ed in the thatement.

Seidel then asked when the technical surveillances on

the Panthers were installed. Former SA Todd replied that they

were functioning at the time he was appointed Supervisor.

Seidel

then asked how was

the technical surveillance

related to the

COINTEL, if at all, and specifically whether information coming

from the technical

surveillance was used in carrying. out the

COINTEL. Former SA Todd advised that he could not recall

specifically what was done in either Program without reviewing

the files and comparing the information therein with the source.

Seidel seemed very interested in this, but actually the question

could not be answered on the basis of

recollection alone, and

was

not.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER

SA DAVID E. TODD BY

SSC STAFF MEMBER

Seidel then asked how would the Panther COINTEL

be defined with regard to aims, techniques and results.

The

answer to this was that the aims were to counter generally the

revolutionary objectives and activities of the Panthers.

The

question concerning techniques was left unanswered, and as

far as results go, former SA Todd told Seidel that he did not

reed there had been any great results from the Program as it was

pursued in the San Francisco Office, but he could not speak

for the rest of the Program as far as the Bureau is concerned.

Seidel asked whether the Agents working the criminal

aspects of the BPP received information that was received from

a technical

source, and he was told procedures by which

information had been routed to them in their cases, and that at

the time we operated these technical surveillances, we felt they

had been installed lawfully, and that the information received

could be used.

Seidel asked whether there was a great deal of pressure

put on the San Francisco Office for the development of informants.

He was told yes, that informants were the backbone

of good law

enforcement

the Bureau constantly urged better informant

coverage.

Seidel asked if there had been similar pressure placed

on the office in the COINTEL, and former SA Todd replied that

. he did not feel that any great pressure had been put on the

office to carry out this Program, but that the Bureau had recom-

mended the Program, however, had left it up to the office

pretty much as to how it should be carried out.

Seidel asked whether the Program had been successful

in causing dissention within the Party. Former SA Todd told

him that he did not feel this had been particularly effective

way, and that causing dissention had not been a primary

objective of the Program in the San Francisco Office, and that

the policy had been to use the Program for primarily two

purposes:

1) for the purpose of developing informants by

attempting to dissuade them from their loyalties to the Party;

and 2) to make representations to Panthers for whom outstanding

arrest warrants had been issued in order to flush them out so

they could be apprehended.

SA DAVID E. TODD BY

Seidel asked specifically about the COINTEL involving

the Breakfast Program, and was told a recommendation had been

made for putting some

kind of contamination in the Breakfast

Program food, and that this office had felt this extremely

inadvisable and recommended against it, and it was not carried

out here.

Former SA Todd was also asked about a COINTEL

proposal relating to "The Black Panther" newspapers, and was

told that such a proposal had been made involving saturating

the papers with a foul smelling fish oil or some substance,

however, we recommended against this as it would serve no purpose.

Seidel was advised that the San Francisco policy had

been to recommend against harassment, per se, and also recommended

against leaking information to the press. Seidel then raised

the question about the incident where Huey P. Newton's high

standard of living was given to the press, and he was told

that this fell into the category of informant development on.

the basis it was felt that if those Panthers who

were living

practically in poverty could realize what Newton's standards

of living were, it might change their allegience to him and

they could be contacted for informant purposes.

Seidel was also told that in this phase of the

COINTEL, it was former SA Todd's recollection that this infor-

mation

regarding Newton's high standard of living had been

disseminated by informants, and that the press was well aware

of Newton's standards of living without having to make this

information available to them.

Seidel asked what the instructions had been from the

Bureau in carring out the COINTEL. Former SA Todd told Seidel

that he had reviewed this file after being appointed supervisor,

but could not recall specifically what the Bureau instructions

were.

The only other instructions received were at a two day

conference in Washington,

D.C., on BPP matters conducted by

former Assistant to the Director William Sullivan, and Section

Chief George Moore, at which time it was pointed out that the

Bureau desired the

COINTEL to be coordinated with the Bureau,

but that former SA todd did not recall any firm prohibition against

taking certain actions without Bureau authority, and that the

field had some leeway in what they did, but, in general, offices

made proposals to the Bureau with copies to San Francisco

prior to taking any action. Seidel asked why San Francisco

got copies of all proposals, and was told this was because

San Francisco was office of origin in the BPP case and other

offices were required to furnish a copy of all correspondence.

Seidel then asked to what extent Special Agent in

Charge Charles W. Bates had knowledge of the COINTEL as it

related to the

BPP, and he was told that former SA Todd could

not speak for Bates

and his knowledge would be dependent upon

how carefully he read incoming mail and reviewed files, and

former SA Todd had no knowledge as to

what extent Bates did this.

Seidel was told that under the

supervisory setup in the

office at the time, former SA Todd felt it was his responsibility

to direct this Program in San Francisco and not Bates.

Seidel indicated that out of his investigation in the

hearings, undoubtedly there would be some legislation coming

out of congress that would either enable or prohibit such

things as the COINTEL,

and he stated that was one reason he

was asking concerning its effectiveness, and wondered what former

SA Todd would recommend.

Seidel was told that

former SA Todd

felt it essential that the Government should have the right to

defend itself against individuals and groups who advocate

violent revolution or who are aligned with foreign powers,

and that there was a need for some sort of legislation within

the framework of constitutional government which would enable

the Sovernment to do this; but, of course, it should be done

under. proper control.

sort of control, and was told that this was a matter for

Congress to decide, but perhaps Congress should look. into some

legislation similar to wiretap legislation, where the responsi-

bility is upon a Federal judge to issue a warrant.

Former SA Todd had prepared a brief summary of what

he recalled of the activities of the BPP, and he made a copy of

this available to Seidel.

Former SA Todd also had made a

chronology to assist him in answering questions, together with

5

some notes concerning COINTEL policy, former SA Todd's general

recollection of

matters, questions of law regarding agent -

principle, privileged information problems, ongoing litigation

and national defense, and informants and sources.

Seidel asked

for a copy of this chronology and this, too, was given to him.

Seidel expressed great interest in receiving the one

page summary of the Panthers' activities, and stated that he

had chosen the Panthers, for a case study, and he seemed more

interested in this than in the COINTEL.

He also indicated that

there might be future interviews and that former SA Todd might

be called as a witness before the Committee at a later date.

At the outset of the interview, Seidel

asked whether

former SA Todd desired his rights be read to him. Former

SA Todd told him that since he did not interpret this as a

custodial interview, and it was his understanding Seidel had no

police power, that he could forego reading the rights.

Former SA Toda did not feel it was necessary to

consult with a Bureau representative at this time.

The above information was furnished by former SA lodd

voluntarily and was not solicited.

on the same date, the following answers were receivea?

Is it permissible for agent to give general

answers

concerning the Black Panther Party (BPP) as to

membership numoer and Chapter numbers at various dates?

Answer: Yes.

Local media has previously set forth a memorandum

consideration should be

given to furnishing fabricated

documents originating with the Oakland Police Department

and the FBI, San Francisco, when, in fact, the memorandum

came from the Bureau.

'I questioned concerning this memorandum,

may agent point out that this document originated with the

Bureau rather than

San Francisco?

Answer: Yes.

In contemplation of possible questioning concerning

false correspondence directed to ELDRIDGE CLEAVER and others

abroad, can agent refer SSC Staff to Bureau when questioned

concerning identity of agents preparing correspondence?

U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) ;

INTERVIEW OF SA LEO S. BRENNEISEN

Is it necessary for agent to express an opinion

as to morality, regality of said Counterintelligence

Program (COINTEL) ?

Answer: You are not obliged to answer those

questions you do not desire to answer, but if you wish you

may comment on the legality or morality of the plan.

SA DENNIS MILLER related that he desired that it

be borne

in mind that the Bureau in no way wished to impede

the SSC investigation.

LESTER B. SEIDEL, SSC Staff Member, appeared at the

Sari Francisco Office of the FBI On August 11, 1975, and

interviewed :SA LEO BRENNEISEN from 1:03 PM to 2:30

SEIDEL prefaced the interview by explaining that he had

been advised that BRENNEISEN was the Coordinator for the

COINTEL in San Francisco from May 16, 1969 to May 1, 1970.

It was pointed out to him that the case was assigned to

agent from May 16, 1969 to May 1, 1971.

SEIDEL asked if agent had, in fact, approved all

proposals coming from the San Francisco Office. He was

advised that not necessarily because if another agent made

a proposal the person approving it in San Francisco would

be the person signing the outgoing mail, namely, the Supervisor

or

Relief

Supervasor.

SEIDEL asked what Squad agent had been assigned

to during this Program, and he was advised s-6.

He inquired

if there was any COINTEL in San Francisco against US; he

was advised to the contrary.

He inquired as to the usual

number of cases assigned agent, and was advised that to

agent's best recollection probably 30 at any one time. He

asked if agent's work was exclusively security during the

handling of the COINTEL Program and he was advised agent

did have some criminal assignments.

He inquired if there

any relationship between COINTEL and criminal assignments,

and he was

advised no and that agent desired to limit the

scope of his questioning to the COINTEL Program.

SEIDEL then asked how many suggestions the agent

had submitted in COINTEL. . He was advised that an estimate

would be difficult but probably the nearest figure would be

some two suggestions a month with possibly six months in

two years when no suggestions were made.

He inquired as

to agent's knowledge of what percentage of total proposals

from all sources submitted to the Bureau had been approved,

and he was advised only a small percentage.

U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) ;

INTERVIEW OF SA LEO S. BRENNEISEN

At this point, SEIDEL requested agent to outline the

types of COINTEL proposals submitted by San Francisco.

He

was

answered that anonymous letters, letters with pseudonyms,

and letters signed with the name of an existing person had

been used.

It was pointed out that the program had included

the use of anonymous letters, including those directed to

landlords advising that the Black Panther Party was occupying

their property; letters to people supporting Bel programs,

including the Breakfast Program and enclosing copies of the

BPP color book for children encouraging the shooting of

police officers and/or articles from the

"Black Panther

Party", the official BPP newspaper, showing their propensity

advocacy of violence; letters

to organizations containing

articles that showed the

BPP in

direct opposition to their

aims, such as a letter to a Jewish organization showing BPP

support of Palestine guerrillas.

It was pointed out that letters had been directed

to ELDRIDGE CLEAVER in Algeria in the names of BPP members.

At this point, SEIDEL interrupted to explain that he was

enlisting

the

complete cooperation of the interviewee, that

there had been some Congressional criticism of the COINTEL,

that there were some segments of the population that were

anti-FBI and that he desired to present the FBI in a proper

light, and that he

had good friends in the Bureau.

SEIDEL asked, was it necessary to have utilized

COINTEL. Agent advised that it was difficult to correctly.

judge the effect of the program but it was felt it was not

without some effect because the Black Panther Party had not'

only awindled from a membership of approximately 1,000 in

1969 to perhaps 200 in 1973, but that the organization became

split with dissension and had dropped much of its former

advocacy for violence.

SEIDEL then requested that the agent give his

recommendation on what COINTEL in the future should be;

whether there should be a division between

security and

criminal investigations to different agencies in order that

a possible intrusion on the rights

of an individual in

intelligence matters might not necessarily preclude his

being prosecuted by the Bureau, in a criminal matter. Agent

refused to furnish his "off-thacuff" opinion, pointing

out that he felt that it was without the scope of his

release.

Without further questioning agent concerning the

types of COINTEL proposals, SEIDEL next asked if the

Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) on the BPP was in operation

at the time COINTEL was initiated, and what proposals were

submitted in COINTEL based on information from ELSUR.

SEIDEL was advised agent's release would not allow

him to discuss ELSUR.

SEIDEL asked if the San Francisco Division had made

any

"snitch" proposals. When asked to clarify

the question,

he stated that this was a suggestion to the effect that

Black Panther Party member be accused of being an FBI

Agent replied that to the best of his recollection

no such recommendations had been made to the Bureau by San

Francisco, and on the contrary, agent knew that it had been

that any such allegation. should

be most carefully considered inasmuch as BPP history has

indicated that they had dealt severely with suspected infor-

mants, even to the

point of killing them.

SEIDEL then asked if the San Francisco Division

had received a great deal of "flak" from the Bureau on this

program.

He was advised that the Bureau operates a "tickler

system"

for following investigations and that the program

had received some priority from the FBI but agent had never

considered correspondence from the Bureau as being "flak".

SEIDEL at this point instead of questioning made

the statement that the Bureau gave this matter "high priority"

No comment was made to this statement.

SEIDEL next questioned agent if he had read any

publicity concerning a May 11, 1970 letter from the Bureau

- to San Francisco entitled, "Special Operations Research", in

which it was suggested that some consideration be given to

furnishing the BPP spurious documents that supposedly

originated with the Oakland Police Department and the FBI.

He explained

that some newspaper had received a copy of the

document under the Freedom of Information Act and thereafter

published it. He inquired if a response to the letter

had been made by San

Francisco.

Agent

advised that it was

his recollection that San Francisco had responded recommending

against both proposals, pointing out that the Bep had in the

short past published contingency plans of the Berkeley Police

Department for a said on National Headquarters to the

embarrassment of that agency.

San Francisco was of the

opinion that if spurious documents were furnished to the

BPp they would innediately publish them, rather than attempt

to develop an informant and the operation presented a great

deal of possible embarrassment and publicity for the Bureau.

SEIDEL asked for agent's knowledge of why the letter

had been captioned as previously described

rather than

Counterintelligence Program, Black Panther Party. Agent

stated he had no recollection of exact caption of the letter.

SEIDEL then went on to explain that he had been advised

that

the Bureau

had several

COINTELS and the one covering Special

Operations Research was a COINTEL COvering foreign operations.

Agent made no comment.

SEIDEL requested what proposals had been made to

disrupt the BPP newspaper; how did the proposals originate,

and what offices

submitted them. He was advised that it was

agent's

recollection that the Bureau may have requested

suggestions from several offices but that to agent's knowledge

When SEIDEL continued to questionthe

specific proposals and why their approval

was not recommended by San Francisco, he was advised that one

proposal was the use of a foul-smelling chemical to put on

the paper. San Francisco was of the opinion it would not

be practical inasmuch as it would contaminate an airplane

and would subject the airline of the printing company to

damages. SEIDEL was further advised that it was believed

the suggestion may have been made for the changing of a first

page of an issue at the printing company to embarrass the BPP,

but it was

pointed out that this would also merely result in

a claim being filed against the printer.

SEIDEL was advised that there may have been a

suggestion that some thought should be given to the possible

delay of the plates for the paper,

that suggestion coming

at the time when the paper was being printed in New York

with the master copy being filmed. in San Francisco.

Francisco did not suggest approval because a mere delay would

have been of little benefit because the paper was not timely.

INTERVIEW OF SA LEO S. BRENNEISEN

SEIDEL asked about the disruption of the BPP

Breakfast Program.

The answer was given that agent had

no recollection of this, and SEIDEL was asked did he have

any information from the Bureau that we had attempted a

aisruption of the program in San Francisco.

He related

that he believed not and that it probably happened in

San Diego.

SEIDEL asked about a suggestion that informants

set up a possible confrontation between the BPP 'and the

Republic of New Africa (RNA): Agent stated he had no

recollection of such a proposal and dia not believe it had

been submitted by San Francisco because the membership and

activity in RNA had been minimal in this area.

SEIDEL then asked

if we had suggested that landlords

in the San Francisco area be encouraged

to insist on their

rent from the BPP. Agent advised he had no recollection

of this, but could see nothing wrong in

it.

He was advised that agent had no information, that he, himself,

MORGAN had been ill during the time ne was assignea to san

Francisco-and-the reason-for his transfer.

Agent replied

he"had noinformation-concerning-this-matter.

SEIDEL was asked if he felt that anyof the actions

agent described as being taken by the San Francisco Division

were illegal. SEIDEL stated that he did not believe that

these were matters that were in violation of any existing

criminal statutes, but there might be some question as

to

whether the FBI had the specific authority to do these things.

SEIDEL ended the interview by again reiterating

that he was a friend of the Bureau, that he was making an

inquiry and desired to obtain the opinions of both Headquarters

and agents in the field, and that he may make a request to the

Bureau to widen the scope of agent's release.

and Mr. Log Johnson, Staff Members of the Senate Select

„the evening of August 11, 1975, Mr. Lester Seidel

Committee, met with Special Agent in Charge Charles W. Bates

of the San Francisco Office.

This meeting occurred over dinner.

No statements were made by either of these individuals as to

any rights that SAC Bates might have in connection with the

interview.

During the dinner, MI. Seidel referred to COINTELPRO

involving the FBI's investigation of the Black Panther Party

in San Francisco. Bates advised him that he was in charge of

the San Francisco Office from July, 1967 until the end of

April, 1970, when he was transferred to Chicago. Bates stated

that he was

aware of the investigation being conducted on the

Black Panther Party but was not personally conversant with

all the details of this investigation as such details were

all contained in the FBI's file.

On at least two occasions

MI. Seidel referred to specific facts occurring in other parts

of the country involving anonymous letters sent to individuals

under COINTELPRO. He asked if Bates agreed that these actions

were proper.

Mr. Seidel was told that Bates had no way of

knowing the facts as he related were true or any other of

the circumstances

involved and that, therefore, he was unable

to comment at all.

Seidel asked if Bates had any recommendations

for legislatión

which the Committee could propose that would

assist the FBI in the domestic counterintelligence field.

Bates informed

him that he was not fully conversant with this

entire tlela and that it was the perogative of FBI officials

•at Washington and Department of Justice officials

to recommend

such legislation.

Mr. Seidel also inquired as to whether Bates felt

that an extension of electronic surveillances into the domestic

intelligence field would be of assistance. Bates informed

him that the fßl was operating according to current court

decisions as involve electronic surveillances and that the

courts had recently precluded this action in strictly domestic

intelligence matters.

Mr. Seidel was informed that this was

a decision for FBI officials in Washington.

asked Bates if he was aware of the

occasion Bates informed him that he was

not aware of the

"Houston Plan" and his only knowledge of it is what he has

seen in the public press.

At one time Mr. Johnson asked if

Bates thought that Mr.

Hoover had turned down the "Houston

Plan" because he was afraid for his job. Bates again replied

that he had no firsthand knowledge having anything to do with

the

"Houston Plan" but he was certainly aware that Mr. Hoover

was not afraid of anything or anyone.

' Both Mr. Johnson and Mr. Seidel asked if Bates felt

that the use of "black bag jobs" would be of advantage in

conducting domestic counterintelligence operations.

Bates

replied

that he had no personal direct knowledge of such matters

and had never been involved in such matters.

OVERSIGHT

During the evening, Mr. Seidel asked if Bates felt

that a congressional oversite committee of the FBI was sound

and proper.

and not destructive.

Mr. Seidel

asked if Bates felt that the

FBI's security operation should be completely divorced from

its criminal responsibilities and handled as a separate agency

or a separate part of the FBI. Bates informed him that it

appeared that the FBI's efforts in both the criminal and the

security field had been effective and appeared to be proper

in its present context.

Mr. Seidel inquired if Bates was

personally acquainted

with Mr. William C. Sullivan, former

FBI official.

Mr. Seidel was informed that Bates worked in

the same division

with Mr. Sullivan in the 1950's and knew

another supervisor at FBI Headquarters.

Seidel then asked if Bates was aware of the dis-

agreements that Mr. Sullivan had had with Mr. Hoover and he

was informed that

he had no details concerning this matter.

had anything to do with a drinking problem.

Bates said again

that he was not aware of the speci

On the afternoon of August 13, 1975, Mr. Lock Johnson

came into the San Francisco FBI Office saying

he had just a

few more questions he wanted to ask Bates.

He then asked if

the San Francisco Office was involved in foreighncounter-

intelligence work, and he was informed that we were as were

many other FBI offices.

He then asked if we surveilled every-

one who went into or came out of the soviet Consulate in San

Francisco.

He was informed that Bates did not intend to dis-

cuss with him any investigative techniques or anything having

to do with pending investigations.

Mr. Johnson said he was

attempting to find some individual who was an expert in foreign

counterintelligence, particularly the Soviet threat to the

United States. Bates informed him that there were probably

robably n

a number of people in the United States who would qualify in

this category but Bates did not consider himself as an expert

On the morning of 9/2/75, Mr. AL BELMONT,

former+

Assistant to the Director of FBI, called SAC, San Francisco.

SHe said that early last week Mr. MIKE EPSTEIN from the Staff ^

of the Church Committee called him and said he wanted to come

to California and talk with Mr. BELMONT on Saturday, 8/30/75.

ANY. BETYONT Said that EPSTEIN appeared and talked to him for

about 30 minutes.

His main topic of discussion was the MARTIN

LUTHER KING case.

EPSTEIN told BELMONT that he was attempting

• to tie the FBI investigation of the KING case into the "March

Ion Washington." BELMONT told him that the TBI's investigation-

whad nothing to do with the March on Washington. He further

• told EPSTEIN that the KING case was open because of information

of definite efforts by the Communist Party to influence KING.

EPSTEIN referred to some monograph and then to some

memorandum with BELMONT's initials on it concerning the KING

case and BELMONT told him he had no personal knowledge of that.

MY. BELMONT stated he merely wantato i make this known to the

- 8460

For the Bureau's information,

condition

Mr. BELMONT'S

physical

few

months and

Senator Tower. What criteria do you use in the selection

of informants?

Mr. Wannall. Well, the criteria vary with the needs. In

oux cases relating to extremist matters, surely in order to get

an informant who can meld into

a group which is engaged in a

criminal type activity, you're going tò have a different set

of criteria. If you're talking about our internal security

matters, I think we set rather high standards. We do require

that a preliminary inquiry be conducted which would consist

principally of checks of our headquarters indices, our field

office indices, checks with other informants who are operating

in the same area, and in various established sources such

as

local police departments.

Following this, if it appears that the person is the type

who has credibility, can be depended upon to be reliable, we

would interview the individual in order to make a determination

as to whether or not he will be willing to assist the FBI

in discharging its responsibilities in that. field.

Following that, assuming that the. answer is positive, we

would conduct a rather in depth investigation for the purpose

of. further attempting to establish credibility and. reliability.

Senator. Tower. .How. does the. Bureau. distinguish between

the use of informants for law enforcement as opposed to

intelligence. collection?

Is the guidance different, or is it the same, or what?

Mr. Wannall. Well, Mr. Adams can probably best address

the use of informants on criminal matters since he is over

the operational division on that.

MI. Adams. You do have somewhat of a difference in the fact

that a criminal informant in a law enforcement function, you

are trying to develop evidence which will be admissible in

court for prosecution, whereas with intelligence, the informant

alone, your purpose could either be prosecution or it coula be

just for purposes of pure intelligence.

The difficulty in both is retaining the confidentiality

of the individual and protecting the individual, and trying to,

through use of the informant, obtain evidence which could be

used independently of the testimony of the informant so that

he

can continue operating as a criminal informant.

Senator Tower. Are these informants ever authorized to

function as provocateurs?

MT. Adams :

No, sir,, they're not. We have strict regula-

tions against using informants as provocateurs. This gets

into that delicate area of entrapment which has been addressed

by the courts on many occasions and

has been concluded by the

courts that providing an individual has a willingness to engage

in an activity, the government has the right to provide him the

opportunity. This does not mean, of course: that mistakes don't

occur in this area, but we take whatever steps we can.to

avoid this. Even the law has recognized that informants

can

engage in criminal activity, and the courts have held that,

especially the Supreme Court in the Newark County Case, that

the very difficulty of penetrating an ongoing operation, that

an informant himself can engage in criminal activity, but

because there is lacking this criminal intent to violate a

law, we stay away from that. Our regulations fall short of that.

If we

have a situation where we felt that an informant

has to become involved in some activity in order to protect

or conceal his use as an informant, we go right to the United

States Attorney or to the Attorney

General to try to make sure

we are not stepping out of bounds insofar as the use of our

informants.

Senator Tower. But you do use these informants and do

instruct them to spread dissension among certain groups that

they are informing on, do you not?

MI. Adams. We did when we had the COINTELPRO programs,

which were discontinued in 1971, and I think the klan is probably

one of the best examples of a situation where the law was

in effect at the time. We heard the term States Rights used

much more then than we hear it today. We saw in the Little

Rock situation the President of the United States, in sending

in the troops, pointing out the necessity to use local law

enforcement. We must have local law enforcement, to use the

troops only as a last resort.

And then you have a situation like this where you do try

to preserve the respective roles in law enforcement. You have

historical problems with the klan coming along.

We had

situations where the FBI and the Federal Government was almost

powerless to act. We had local law enforcement officers in

some areas participating in Klan violence.

The instances mentioned by MI. Rowe, every one of those,

he saw them from the lowest level of the informant. He didn't

see what action was taken with that information, as he pointed

out in his testimony. Our files show that this information was

reported to the police departments in every instance. We

also

knew that in certain instances the information, upon being

received, was not being acted upon. We also disseminated

simultaneously through letterhead memoranda to the Department

of Justice the problem, and here, here we were, the FBI, in a

position where we had no authority in the absence of instruction

from the Department of Justice, to make an arrest.

Sections 241 and 242 don't cover it because you don't have

evidence of a conspiracy, and it ultimately resulted in

situation where the Department called in United States

Marshals who do have authority similar to local law enforcement

officials.

•So, historically, in those days, we were just as frus-

trated as anyone else was, and when we got information from

24

someone like Mr. Rowe, good information, reliable information,

25

and it was passed on to those who had the responsibility to

Congress

recognized this, and it wasn't until 1968

that they came along and added Section 245 to the civil rights

statute, which added punitive measures against an individual

that didn't have to be a conspiracy. But this was a problem

that the whole country was grappling with: the President of

the United States, Attorney General. We were in a situation

where we had rank lawlessness taking place, as you know from

a memorandum we sent you that we sent to the Attorney General.

Veterans Against the War?

Was there a legitimate law enforcement purpose, or was the

intent to halter political expression?

Mr. Adams. We had information on the Vietnam Veterans

Against the War that indicated that there were subversive

groups involved.

They were going to North Vietnam and meeting.

with the Communist forces. They were going to Paris, attending

meetings paid for and sponsored by the

Communist Party, the

International Comnunist Party. We feel that we had a very valid

basis to direct our attention to the VAW.

It started out, of course, with Gus Hall in 1967, who was

head of the Communist Party, USA, and the conments he made,

and what it finally boiled down to was a situation where it

split off into the Revolutionary Union, which was a Maost

group, and the hard-line Communist group, and at that point

factionalism developed in many of the chapters, and they closed

those chapters because there was no longer any intent to follow

the national organization.

But we had a valid basis for investigating it,

and we

investigated chapters to determine if there was affiliation

and subserviance to the national office.

Senator Tower. Mr. Hart?

Senator llart of Michigan. But in the process of chasing

after the Veterans Against the War, you got a lot of information

Mr. Adams.

I agree, Senator.

Senator Hart of Michigan. Why don't you try to shut that

stuff

off by simply telling the agent, or your informant?

MI. Adams. Here is the problem that you have with that.

When you're looking at an organization, do you report only the

violent statements made by the group or do you also show that

you may have one or two violent individuals, but you have

some of these church groups that were mentioned, and others,

that the whole intent of the group is not in violation of the

statutes.

you have to report the good, the favorable along

with the

unfavorable, and this is a problem. We wind up with

information in our files. We are

accused of being vacuum

cleaners, and you are a vacuum cleaner. If you want to know the

real purpose of an organization, do you only report the

violent statements made and the fact that it is by a small

minority, or do you also show the broad base of the organization

and what it really is?

And within that is where we have to have the guidelines

we have talked about before.

We have to narrow down, because

we recognize that we do wind up with too much information in

our files.

you are feeding into. Departmental files the names of people

exercises, and this is what hangs some of us up.

Mr. Adams. It hangs me up. But in the same files I

imagine every one of you has been interviewed by the FBI, either

asking you about the qualifications of some other Senator

being considered for a Presidential appointment, being inter-

vieved concerning some friend who is applying for a job.

Were you embarrassed to have that in the files of the

ГВІ?

Now, someone can say, as reported at our last session, that

this is an indication, the mere fact that we have a name in our

files has an onerous impression, a chilling effect.. I agree.

It can have, if someone wants to distort what we have in our

files, but if they recognize that we interviewed you because

of considering a man for the Supreme Court of the United

States,

and that isn't distorted or improperly used, I don't

see. where any harm is served by having that in our

files.

Senator lart of Michigan. This is what should require

us to rethink this whole business.

Mr. Adams. Absolutely.

And this is what I hope the guidelines committees as well

as the Congressional input are going to address themselves to.

Senator Hart of Michigan. We've talked about a wide range

of groups which the Bureau can and has had informant penetration

and report on. Your manual, the Bureau manual's definition

of when an extremist or security investigation may be under-

taken refers to groups whose activity either involves violation

of certain specified laws, or which may result in the violation

of such

law, and when such an investigation is opened, then

informants may be used.

Another guideline says that domestic intelligence

investigations now must be predicated on criminal violations.

The agent need only cite a statute suggesting an investigation

relevant to a potential violation. Even now, with an improved,

upgraded effort to avoid some of these problems, we are back

again in a world of possible violations or activities which

may result in illegal acts.

Now, any constitutionally protected exercise of the

right to demonstrate, to assemble, to protest, to petition,

conceivably may rasult in violence or disruption of a local

town meeting, when a controversial social issue might result

in disruption. It might be by hecklers rather than those holding

the meeting.

Does this mean that the Bureau should investigate all

groups organizing or participating in such a meeting because

they may result in violence, disruption?:.

Mr. Adams.

No, sir.

Senator Hart of Michigan. Isn't that how you justify

spying on almost every aspect of the peace movement?

Mr. Adams.

No, sir. When we monitor demonstrations,

monitor demonstrations where we have an indication that the

we

demonstration itself is sponsored by a group that we have an

investigative interest in, a valid investigative interest in,

of where members of one of these groups are participating where

there is a potential that they might change the peaceful

nature of the demonstration.

But this is oux closest question of trying to draw

guidelines to avoid getting into an area of infringing on the

First Amendment rights of people, yet at the same time being

aware of groups such as we have had in greater numbers in the

past than we do at the present time, But we have had periods

where the demonstrations have been rather severe, and the

courts have said that the FBI has a right, and indeed a duty,

to keep itself informed with respect to the possible commission

of crime. It is not obliged to wear blinders until it may be

too late for prevention.

And that's a good statement if applied in a clearcut

case. Our problem is where we have à demonstration and we have

to make a judgment call as to whether it is one that clearly

fits the criteria of enabling us to monitor the activities, and

that's where I think most of our disagreements fail.

Sonator Hart of Michigan. Let's assume that the rule

for opening an investigation on a group is narrowly drawn. The

Bureau manual states that 'informants investigating a subversive

organization should not only report on what that group is

doing but should look at and report on activities in which

the group is participating.

There is a Section 87B3 dealing with reporting. on

connections with other groups. That section says that the

field office shall "determine and report on any significant

connection or cooperation with non-subversive groups." Any

significant connection or cooperation with non-subversive

groups.

Now let's look at this in practice. In the spring of

1969 there was a rather heated national debate over the

installation of the anti-ballistic missile system. Some of us

remember that. An I'BI informant and to FBI confidential

sources reported on the plan's participants and activities

of the Washington Area Citizens Coalition Against the ABM,

particularly in open public debate in a high school auditorium,

which included speakers from the Defense Department for the

ABM

and a scientist and defense analyst against the ABM.

The informants reported on the planning fox the meeting,

the distribution of materials to churches and schools,

participation by local.

clergy, plans to seek resolution on i:

ABM from nearby town councils. There was also informat:.

plans for a

subseuucht town meeting in Washington with the

names of local political leaders who vould attend.

Now the information, the informant information came as

part of an investigation of an allegedly subversive group:

participating in that coalition. Yet the infornation dealt

with all aspects and all participants. The reports on the

plans for the meeting and on the meeting itself were disseminatca

to the Statc Department, to military intelligence, and to. the

White llouse.

Ilow do we get into all of that?

Mr. Adams. Well -

Senator Hart, of Michigan. Or if you were to rerun it,

would you do it again?

Mr. Adams.

Well, not in 1975, compared to what 1969

was.

The problem we had at the time was where we had an

informant who had reported that this group, this meeting was

going to take place and it was going to bethe Daily World,

which was the east coast communist newspaper that made comments

about it. They formed an organizational meeting. We took

a quick look at it. The cage apparently was opened in May .28,

1969 and closed June 5 saying there was no problem with this

organization.

Now the problem we get into is if ve take a quick look

and get out, fine. We've had

cases, though, where we have

stayed in too long.

When you're dealing with security i is li!

and they supported him with total resources: of the Soviet

So someone reports something to you which you feel; you take

and there's nothing to it, and I think that's

what they did.

Senator: Hart of Michigan. You said that was '69. Let

me bring you up to date, closer. to current, a current place

on the calendar.

This one is the fall of last year, 1975. President •

Ford announced his new program with respect to amnesty, as

he described it, for draft resistors. Following that there

were several national conferences involving all the groups

and individuals interested in unconditional amnesty.

Now parenthetically, while unconditional amnesty is

not against -- while unconditional amnesty is not yet the law,

we afreed that advocating it is not against the law either.

the conference. The Bureau's own reports described the

participants as having represented diverse peispectives on

the issue of amnesty, including civil liberties and human

rights groups, G.I. rights spokesmen, parents of men killed

in Vietnam, wives of ex-patriates in Canada, experts on draft

counselling, religious groups interested in peace issues,

delegates from student organizations, and aides of House

and

Senate members, drafting legislation on amnesty.

The informant apparently was attending in his role

a member of a group under investigation as allegedly subversive

and it described the topics of the workshop.

Ironically, the Bureau office report before

them noted

that in view of the location of the conference at a theological

seminary, the FBí would use restraint and limit its coverage.

amnesty, the better for the soul of the country:

Is this what we want?

Mr. Adams. I'll let Mr. Wannall address himself to this.

He is particular knowledgeable as to this operation.

Mr. Wannall. Senator llart, that was a case that was

opened on Novenber 14 and closed November 20, and the information

which caused us to be interested in it were really two particular

items. One was that a member of the steering committee there,

was a three man stecring committee, and oné of

those members

of the national conference was in fact a national officer

of the VAl in whom we had suggested bafore we did have a

legitimate investigative interest.

Senator lart of Michigan. Nell, I would almost say so what

at that point.

Mr. Hannall. The second report ve had was that the

VAW would actively participate in an attempt to pack the

conference to take it over. And the third report we had -

Senator. Hart of Michigan. And incidentally, all of the

information that your Buffalo informant had given you with

respect to the goals and aims of the VAW gave you a list of

goals which were completely within Constitutionally protected

objectives.

There wasn't a single

item out of that VAN that

jeopardizes the security of this country at all.

Mr. Wannall. Well, of course, ve did not rely entirely

On

the Buffalo informant, but even there ve did

from that informant information which I considered to be

significant.

The Buffalo chapter of the WAw was the regional office.

covering New York and northern New Jersey. It was one of the

five most active VAlY chapters in the country and at a

national conference, or at the regional conference, this

informant reported information back to us that an attendee

at the conference announced that he had run guns into Cuba

prior to the Castro take-over. He himself said that he during

the Cuban crisis had been inder 24 hour suveillance. There

was

also discussion at the conference of subjugating the

VAW to the revolutionary union. There vere some individuals

in the chapter or the regional conference who were not in

agreenent with us, but Mr. Adams has addressed himself to the

interest of the revolutionary union.

So all of the infornation that we had on the VA dia

not come froin that source but even that particular source did

givé us

infornation which we considered to be of some

significance in our appraisal of the need for continuing the

investigation of that particular chapter of the VAW.

Senator Hart of Michigan. But does it give you the

right or does it create the need to go to a conference, even

if it is a conference that night be taken over by the VAW

when the subject matter is how and by what means shall we

seek to achieve unconditional amnesty? What threat?

discontinued any further interest.

Senator Hart of Michigan. Heli, my time has expired

but even this brief exchange, I think, indicates that if we

really want to control the dangers to our society of using

informants to gather domestic political intelligence, we have

to restrict sharply domestic

intelligence investigations. And

that gets us into what I would like to raise with you when

my turn comes around again, and that's the use of warrants,

obliging the Bureau to obtain a warrant before a full-fledged

informant can be directed by the Bureau against a group or

individuals.

I know you have objections to. that and I would like to

review that with you.

Sénator Mondale, Pursue that question.

Senator Hart of Michigan. I am talking now about an

obligation to obtain a warrant before you turn joose a full-

fledged informant. I'm not talking about tipsters that run

into you or you run into, or who walk in as information sources,

The Bureau has raised some objections in this memorandum to the

Committee. The Bureau argues that such a warrant requirement

might be unconstitutional because it would violate the First

Amendment rights of fBI informants to communicate with their

government.

Now that's a concern for first Amendment rights that

ought to

• hearten all the civil libertarians.

But why would that vary, why would a warrant requirement

raise a

serious constitutional question?

MI. Adams: Well, for one thing it's the practicability

it or the impacticability of'getting a warrant which;

ordinarily involves probable cause to show that a crime has

been or is about to be committed.

In the intelligence field we are not dealing necessarily

with an imminent criminal action. We're dealing with activities

such as with the Socialist Workers Party, which we have

discussed before, where they say publicly we're not. to engage

in any violent activity today, but we guarantee you we still

subscribe to the tenets of communism and that when the time

is ripe, we're going to rise up and help overthrow the United

States.

Well, now, you can't show probable cause if they're about

to do it because they're telling you they're not

going to do it

and you know they're not going to do it at this particular

moment.

It's just the mixture somewhat of trying to mix in a

criminal procedure with an intelligence gathering function,

and

we can't find any practical way of doing it. He have a particulat

organization.

We may have an informant that not only belongs

to the conmunist party, but belongs to several other organization

and as part of his function he may be sent out by the Communist

Party to try to infiltrate one of these clean organizations.

We don't have probable cause for him to target against

that organization, but yet we should be able to receive informa-

tion from him that he as

a Communist Party member, even

though in an informant status, is going to that organization:

and don't worry about it. We're making no headway on it.

It's just from our standpoint the possibility of informants,

the Supreme Court has held that informants per se do not

violate the First, Fourth, or Fifth Amendments. They have

recognized the necessity that the government has to have

individuals who will assist them in carrying out their

governmental duties.

Senator Hart of Michigan. I'm not sure I've heard anything

yet in response to the constitutional question, the very

practical question that you addressed.

Quickly, you are right that the court has said that the

use of the informant per se is not a violation of constitutional

rights of the subject under investigation. But Congress

can prescribe sone safeguards, some rules and some standards,

just as we have with respect to your use of electronic

surveillance, and could do it with respect to informants.

That's quite different from saying that the warrant

procedure itself would be unconstitutional.

But with respect to the fact that you couldn't show

probable cause,

and therefore; you couldn't get a warrant,

therefore you oppose the proposal to require you to get a

warrant.

It seems to beg the question.

Assuming that you say that since we use informants and

investigate groups which may only engage in lawful activities

but which might engage in activities that can result in

violence of illegal acts, and you can't use the warrant, but

Congress could say that the use of informants is subject to

such abuse and poses such a threat to legitimate activity,

including the willingness of people to assemble and discuss

the anti-ballistic missilé system; and we don't want you to

use them unless you have indication of criminal activity or

unless you present your request to a magistrate, in the same.

fashion as you are required to do with respect to, in most

cases, to wiretap.

This is an option available to Congress.

Senator Tower.

Senator Schweiker.

Senator Schweiker. Thank you very much.

Mr. Wannall, what's the difference between a potential

security informant and a security informant?

Mr. Wannall. I mentioned earlier, Senator Schweiker,

that in developing an informant we do a preliminary check on

him before talking with him and then we do a further in-depth

background check.

A potential security informant is someone who is under

consideration before

he is approved by headquärters for use as

an informant. He is someone who is under current consideration.

On some occasions that person will have been developed to a

point where he is in fact furnishing information and we are

engaged in checking upon his reliability.

In some instances he may be paid for information furnished,

but it has not gotten to the point yet where we have satisfied

ourselves that he meets all of our criteria. When he does,

the field must submit its recommendations to headquarters, and

headquarters will pass upon whether that individual is an

approved FBI informant.

Senator Schweiker. So it's really the first step of

being an informant, I guess.

Mr. Wannall. It is a preliminary step, one of the

preliminary steps.

Senator Schweiker. In the Rowe case, in :the Rowe

testimony that we just heard, what was the rationale again

for not intervening when violence was known?

I know we asked you several times but I'm still having

trouble understanding what the rationale, Mr. Wannall, was

in not intervening in

the Rove situation when violence was

known.

Mr. Wannall.

Senator Schiveiker, Mr. Adams did address

himself to that. If you have no objection, I'll ask him to

answer that.

Senator Schweiker. All. right.

problem today.

we are an investigative agency. We do not

have police powers like the United States marshalls do.

About 1795, I guess, or some period like that, marshalls have

had the authority that almost, borders on what a sheriff. has

We are the invéstigative agency of the Department of Justice

and during these times the Department of Justice had us maintair

the role of an investigative agency. We were to report on

activities to furnish the information to the local police,

who had an obligation to act. We furnished it to the Department

of Justice.

In those areas where the local police did not act, it

resulted finally in the Attorney General sending 500

United

States

marshalls down to guarantee the safety of people who

were trying to march in protest of their civil rights.

This was an extraordinary measure because it came at a

time of civil righs versus federal rights, and yet there was

a breakdown in law enforcement in certain areas of the country.

, This doesn't mean to indict all law enforcement agencies

in itself at the time either because many of them did act

upon the information that was furnished to them. But we

have no authority to make an arrest on the spot because we

would not have had evidence that there was a.conspiracy

available.

We can do absolutely nothing in that regara.

In Little Rock, the decision was made, for instance, that

if any arrests need to be made, the Army should make them and

next to the Army, "the United

States marshalls should make them,

not the FBI, even though we developed the violations.

And over the years, as you know, at, the time there were many

questions raised." Why doesn't the FBI stop this? Why don't

you do something about it?.

Well, we took the other route and effectively destroyed

the klan as far as committing acts of violence, and of course

we exceeded statutory guidelines in that area.

Senator Schweiker. What would be wrong, just following

up your poiht there, Mr. Adams, with setting up a program

sincé it's obvious to me that a lot of informers are going to:

have pre-knowledge of violence of using U.S. marshalls on some

kind of a long-range basis to prevent violence?

Mx. Adams. We do. We have them in Boston in connection

with the busing incident. We are investigating the violations

under the Civil Rights Act. But the marshalls are in Boston,

they are in Louisville, I believe at the same time, and this

is the approach, that the rederal government finally recognized,

was the solution to the problem where you had to have added

Federal import.

Senator Schweiker. But instead of waiting until it

gets to a Boston state, which is obviously a pretty advanced

confrontation, shouldn't we have some

ere a coordinated program

that when you go up the ladder of co wand in the FBI, that

help can be sought instantly as opposed to waiting until it

I realize it's a departture from the past. I'm not .

saying it isn't. But it seems to me we need a better remedy

than we have.

Mr. Adams.

Well, fortunatelyr.we're at a time where

conditions have subsided in the country, even from the '60s

and the '70s and periods - or '50s and '60s.. We report to the

Department of Justice on potential troublespots around the

country as we learn of them

so that the Department will be

aware of them. The planning for Boston, for instance, took

place

a year in advance with state officials, city officials,

the Department of Justice and the FBI sitting down together!

saying, how are we going to protect the situation in Boston?

I think we've learned a lot from the days back in the

early '60s. But the government had no mechanics which protected

people at that time.

Senator Schweiker. I'd like to go, if I may, to the

Robert Hardy case. I know he

is not a witness, but he

was

a witness before the llouse. But since this affects my

state, I'd like to ask M. Wannall. Mr. Hardy, of course, was

the FBI informer who ultimately led and planned and organized

a raid on the Camden draft board. An according to Mr. Hardy's

testimony before our Committee, he sa.: that in advance of the

raid someone in the Department had cron acknowledged the fact

that they had all the information they needed to clamp down

on the conspiracy and could arrest people at that point in time,

and yet no arrests were made.

Why, Mr.

Wannall, was

this true?

Mr. Wannall. Well, I can answer that based only on the

material that I have reviewed, Senator Schweiker. It was not

a case handled in my division but I think I can answer your.

question.

There was, in fact, a representative of the Department

of Justice on the spot counselling and advising continuously

as that case progressed as to what point the arrest should be

made and we were being guided by those to our mentors, the

ones who are responsible for making decisions of that sort.

So I. think that Mr. Hardy's statement to the effect that

there was someone in the Department there is perfectly true.

Senator Schweiker. That responsibility rests with whio

under your procedures?

I1x. Wannall. We investigate decisions on making arrests,

when they should be made, and decisions with regard to

prosecutions are inade either. by the United States attorneys

or by Federals in the Department.

Mr. Adams. At this time that particular case did have

someone in the commission of the crime as further proof,

rather than relying on. one informant and some circumstantial

evidence to prove the violation.

Senator Schweiker. Well, in this case, though, they

even had a dry run.: They could have arrested them on the

dry run.

That's getting pretty close to conspiracy, it seems to

me.

They had a dry run and they could have arrested them on

the dry run.

I'd like to know why they didn't arrest them on the dry

run. Who was this Department of Justice official who made

that decision?

Mx. Adams. Guy Goodwin was the Department official.

Senator Schweiker. Next I'd like to ask back in 1965,

during the height of the effort to destroy the Klan, as you

put it a few moments ago, I believe the FBí has released

figures that we had something like 2,000 informers of some

kind or another infiltrating the Klan out of roughly 10, 000

estimated membership.

I believe these are either FBI figures or estimates.

That would nean that one out of every five members of the Klan

at that point was

an informant paid by the government.

And I believe the figure goes or

so indicate that 70

percent of the new members of the Kla: that year were FBI

informants.

Isn't this an awfully overwhelming quantity of people

to put in an effort such as that? I'm not criticizing that

you shouldn't have informants in the klan and know what's

going on for violence, but it seems to me that this is the

tail wagging the dog.

For example, today we supposedly have only 1594 total

informants for both domestic informants and potential informants

and that here we had 2,000 just in the klan alone.

Mr. Adams. Well, this number 2,000 did include all

racial matters, informants at that particular time, and I

think the figures we tried to reconstruct as to the actual

number of Klan informants in relation to klan members was around

6 percent, I think, after we had read

some of the testimony.

Now the problem we had on the Klan is the Klan had a

group called the Action Group. This was the group that you

remember from Mr. Rowe's testimony, that he was left af-

ter the meeting.

He attended the open meetings and heard

all of the hurrahs and this type of thing from information,

but he never knew what was going on because each one had an

action group that went out and considered themselves in the

missionary field.

Theirs was the

violence.

In order to penetrate those, it takes, you have to direct

as many informants as you possibly can against it. Bear in

mind that I think the newspapers, the President and Congress

and

everyone is concerned about the murder of the civil rights

workers, the Linio Kent sase, the Viola Liuzzo case, the

bombings of the church in Birmingham. We were faced with one,

tremendous problem at that time.

Senator Schweiker. I acknowledge that.

Mr. Adams. Our only approach was through informants

and through the use of informants we solved these cases, the

ones that were solved. Some of the bombing cases we have

never solved. They are extremely difficult.

These informants, as we told the Attorney General, and

as we told the President, that we had moved informants like

MI. Rove up to the top leadership. He was the bodyguard to the

head

man. He was in a position where he could forewarn

us

of violence, could help us on cases that had transpired, and

yet we knew and conceived that this could continue forever

unless we can create enough disruption that these members will

realize that if I go out and murder three civil rights workers,

even though the sheriff and other law enforcement officers are

in on it, if that were

the case and with some of them it was

the case, that I would be caught. And that's what we did and

that's why violence stopped, was because the Klan was insecure

and just like you say, 20

percent, they thought 50 percent of

their menbers ultimately were Klan members and they didn't

dare engaje in these acts of violence because they knew they

couldn't control the conspiracy any longer.

Senator Schweiker. My time is expired. I just have

one quick question.

Is it correct that in 1971 we're using around 6500

informers for black ghetto situations?

Mr. Adams. I'm not sure if that's the year. We did

have one year where we had a number like that which probably

had been around 6000, and that was the time when the cities

were being burned, Detroit, Washington, areas like this.. We

were given a mandate to know what the situation is, where is

violence going to break out, what next?

They weren't informants like an individual penctrating

an organization. They were listening posts in the comnunity

that would help tell us that we have a group here that's getting

ready to start another fire-fight or something.

Senator Tower. At this point, there are three more

Senators remaining for questioning. If we can try to get

everything in in the first round, we will not have a second

round

and I think we can finish around 1:00, and we can. go

on and terminate the proceedings.

However, If anyone feels that they have another question

that they want

to return to, we can come back here by 2:00.

Senator Mondale?

Senator Mondale. Mr. Adams, it seems to me that the

record is now fairly clear that when the fBI operates in the

organization of its kind in the world.

And when the FBI acts

in the field of political ideas, it has bungled its job, it

has interfered with the civil liberties, and finally, in the

last month or two, through its public disclosures, heaped

shame upon itself and really led toward an undermining of

the crucial public confidence in an essential. law enforcement

agency of this country.

In a real sense, history has repeated itself because it

was precisely that problem that led to the creation of the FBI

in 19.21.

In World war I, the Bureau of Investigation strayed from

its law enforcement functions and became an arbiter and

protector of political ideas. And through the interference

of civil liberties and Palmer Raids and the rest, the public

became so offended that later through Mi. Justice Stone and •

Mr. Hoover, the FBI was created.. And the first statement

by Mr. Stone was that never again will this Justice Department

get involved in political ideas.

And yet here we are again looking at a record where with

Martin Luther king, with anti-war resistors, with - we even

had testimony this morning of meetings with the Council of

Churches.

secretly we are investigating this vague, ill-defined

impossible to define idea of investigating dangerous ideas.

It seems to be the basis of the strategy that people

can't protect themselves, that you somehow need to use the

I for one feel that we should investigate the Nazi Party.

I feel that our investigation of the Nazi Party resulted in

the fact that in World War II, as contrasted with World War I,

there wasn't one single incident of foreign directed sabotage

which took place in the United States.

Senator Monclale. And under the criminal law you could

have investigated these issues of sabotage.

Isn't sabotage a crime?•

sabotage is a crime.

Senator Mondale. Could you have investigated that?

Mr. Adams. After it happened.

Senator Mondale. You see, every, time we get involved

crimes. that could have been comnitted. It's very interesting.

In my opinion, you have to stand here if you're going to

still insist that you did the right thing with the Vietnam

Veterans Against the War, and investigating the Council of

justify on the grounds of your law enforcement activitics

law again. You're trying to defend apples with oranges.

That,' s

the law.

You can do that.

Mr. Adams. That's right, but how do you find out which

of the 20,000 Bund members might have been a saboteur. You

don't have probable cause to investigate anyone, but you can

direct an intelligence operation against the German-American

Bund, the same thing we did after Congress said -

Senator Mondale. Couldn't you get a warrant for that?

Why did you object to going to court for authority for that?

Mr. Adams. Because we don't have probable cause to

go against an individual and the law doesn't provide for

probable cause to investigate an organization.

There were activities which did take place, like one time

they outlined the Communist Party -

Senator Mondale. What I don't understand is why it

wouldn't be better for the FBI for us to define authority

that you could use in the kind of Bonn situation where under

court authority you can investigate where there is probable

cause or reasonable cause to suspect sabotage and the rest.

Wouldn't that make a lot more sense than just naking these

decisions on your own?

that. We feel that we're going to giljeat to death in the

in this area. But I won't agree with you, Senator, that we

have bungled

the intelligence operations in the United States.

I agree with you that we have made

some mistakes. Mr. Kelley-

has set a pattern of being as forthright as any Director of the

FBI in acknowledging mistakes that. had been made, but I think

that as you said, and I believe Senator Tower said, and

Senator Church, that we have to watch these hearings because

of the necessity that we

must

concentrate on these areas of

abuse.

We must not lose sight of the

overall law enforcement and intelligence community, and I

still foel that this is the freest country in the world.

I've travelled much, as I'm sure you have, and I know we have

made some mistakes, but I feel that the people in the United

States are less chilled by the mistakes we have made than they

are'by the fact that there are 20,000 murders a year in the

United States and they can't walk out of their

houses at night

and feel safe.

Senator Mondale. That's correct, and isn't that an

argument then, Mr. Adams, for strengthening our powers to go

after those who commit crimes rather than strengthening or

continuing a policy which we now see undermines the public

confidence you need to do your job.

what have brought on this embarrassment to us.

Senator Mondale. I don't want to argue over terms, but

I think I sense an agreement that the FBI has gotten into trouble

over it in the political idea

trouble, and that that's where we

need to have new legal standards.

Mr. Adams. Yes, I agree with that.

Senator Tower. Senator Huddleston.

Senator Huddleston. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Mr. Adams, these two instances we have studied at: some

length seems to have been an inclination on the part of

the Bureau to establish, a notion about an individual or a group

which seems to be very hard to ever change or dislodge. In

the case of Di. King, where the supposition was that he was

being influenced by Communist individuals, extensive investi-

gation was made, surveillance, reports came back indicating that

this in fact was untrue, and directions continued to go out

to intensify the investigation. There never seemed to be a

willingness on the part of the Bureau to accept its own facts.

Ms. Cook testified this morning that something similar

to that happened with the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, that

every piece of information that she supplied to the Bureau

seemed to indicate that the Bureau was, not correct in its

assumption that this organization planned to commit violence,

of that it was being manipulated, and yet you seemed to insist

that this investigation go on, and ti-s information was

used

against the individuals.

Now, are there instances where the Bureau has admitted that

its first assumptions were wrong and they have changed their

course?

MI. Adams. We have admitted that. We have also shown

from one of the cases that Senator Hart brought up, that after

five days we closed the case.

We were told something by an

individual that there was a concern of an adverse influence

in it, and we looked into it. On the Martin Luther King

situation there was no testimony to the effect that we just

dragged on and on, or admitted that we dragged on and on and

on, ad infinitum. The wiretaps on Martin Luther King were

all approved by the Attorney General. Microphones on Martin

Luther king were approved by another Attorney General. This

wasn't the FBI, and the reason they were approved was that

there was a basis to continue the investigation up to a point.

What I testified to was that we were improper in discreditir

DI. King, but it's just like --

Senator Huddleston. The Committee has before it memoranda

written by high officials of the Bureau indicating that the

information they were receiving from the field, from these

surveillance methods, did not confirm what their supposition

was.

Mr. Adams.

That memorandum was rot on Dr. King.

That

was on another

individual that I thi:. somehow got mixed up

in the discussion, one where the isows was can we make people

But the young lady appearing this morning making the:

comment that she never knew of anything she told us that

she considers herself a true member of the VVAW-WSO inasmuch

she feels in general agreement of the principles of it, and

agreed to cooperate with the FBI in providing information regard-

ing the organization to aid in preventing violent individuals

from associating themselves with the VAW-WSO. She is most

concerned

about efforts.by the Revolutionary Union to take over

the VVAW-wsO, and she is working actively to prevent this..

I think that we have a basis for investigating the VAW~

WSO in certain areas today. In other areas we have stopped

the investigation. They don't agree with these principles

laid down by the --

Senator Huddleston. That report was the basis of your

continuing to pay informants and continuing to utilize that

information against members who certainly had not been involved

in violence, and apparently to get them fired from their job

or whatever?

Mr. Adams. It all gets back to the fact that even in the

criminal law field, you have to detect crime, and you have to

prevent crime, and you can't wait unt:!

something happens.. The

Attorney General has clearly spoken

i that area, and even out

statutory jurisdiction provides that we don't --

Senator Huddleston.. Well, of course

we've had considerable

evidence this morning where no attempt was made to prevent

crime, when you had information that it was going to occur.

But I'm sure there are instances where you have.

Mr. Adams. We disseminated every single item which he

reported to us.

Senator Huddleston.

To a police department which you

knew was an accomplice to the crime.

Mr. Adams. Not necessarily.

Senator Huddleston. Your informant had told you that,

hadn't he?

Mr. Adams. Well, the informant is on one level.. We have

other informants, and we have other information.

Senator Huddleston. Yes, but you were aware that he

had worked with certain members of the Birmingham police in

order to -

Mr. Adams. Yes. He furnished many other instances also.

Senator Huddleston. So you weren't really doing a whole

lot to prevent that incident by telling the people who were

already part of it.

MI. Adams. We were doing everything we could lawfully

do at the time, and finally the situation was corrected,

so that

when the department, agreeing that we had no further juris-

diction, could sent the United States Marshal down to perform.

certain law enforcement functions.

Senator Huddleston. Now,

the Committee has received

documents which indicated that in one situation the FBI assisted

an informant who had been established in a white hate group

to establish a rival white hate group, and that the Bureau paid

his expenses in setting uf this rival organization.

Now, does this not put the Bureau in a position of being

responsible for what actions the rival white hate group might

have undertaken?

Mr. Adams. I'd like to see if one of the other gentlemen

knows that specific case,

because I don't think we set up a

specific group.

This is Joe Deegan.

MI. Deegan.

Senator, it's my understanding that the

informant we're talking about decided to break off from the

group he was with. He was with the Macon Klan group of

the United Klans of America, and he decided to break off.

This

was in compliance with our regulations.

His breaking off,

we did not pay him to set up the organization. He did it

on his own.. We paid him for the information he furnished

us concerning the operation.

We did not sponsor the organiza-

tion.

Senator Huddleston:

The new organization that he formed,

did it operate in a very similar manner to the previous one?

Mr. Deegan. No, it did not, and it did not last that

1ong..

Senator Huddleston. ' There's also evidence of an FBI

informant in the Black Panther

Party who had a position of

responsibility within the Party with the knowledge of his

FBI contact of supplying members with weapons and instructing

them in how to use those weapons. Presumably this was in the

knowledge of the Bureau, and

he later became - came in contact

with the group that was contracting for murder, and hè partici-

pated in this group with the knowledge of the FBI agent, and

this group did in fact stalk a victim who was later killed with

the weapon supplied by this individual, presumably all in the

knowledge of the FBI.

How does this square with your enforcement and crime

prevention responsibilities.

MI. Deegan.. Senator, I'm not familiar with that particular

case.. It does not square with our policy in all respects, and

I would have to look at that particular case you're

talking

about to give you an answer.

Senator Huddleston, I don't have the documentation on that

particular case, but it brings up the point as to what kind of

control you exercised over this kind of informant in this kind

of an organization and to what extent an effort is made to

prevent these informants from engaging in the kind of thing

that you are supposedly trying to prevent.

Mr. Adams. A good example of this was Mr. Rowe, who became

active in an action group, and we told him to get out or

we would no longer use him as an informant, in spite of the.

information he had furnished in the past.

We have had cases, Senator, where we have had --

Senator Hudaleston. But you also tola him to participaté

in violent activities.

MI. Adams. We, did not tell him to participate in violent

activities.

lawsuits are. all about, is that there. are. two sides to the

issue, and our agents. handling. this have. advised. us, and I

believe have advised. your staff, that at no time

did they

advise him to engage. in violence.

Senator. Huddleston. Just to do what was. necessary to

get the information, I believe maybe might have been his

instructions.

Mr. Adams. I don't think they made any such statement

to him along that line, and we have informants, we have

informants who have gotten involved in the violation of the law,

and we have immediately converted their status from an informant

to the subject, and have prosecuted I would say, offhand, I

can think of around 20 informants that we have prosecuted for

violating the laws, once it came to our attention, and even

to show you our policy of disseminating information on violence

in this case, during the review of the matter, the agents told

me that they found one case where their agent had been working

24 hours a day, and he was a little late in disseminating the

information to the police department. No violence. occurred,..

but it showed up in a file review, and he was censured for

his delay in properly notifying local authorities.

So we not only have a policy, I feel that we do follow

reasonable

safeguards..In order to carry it out, including periodis

review of all informant. files.

Senator Huddleston. Well, Mr. Rowe's statement is

substantiated to some extent with the acknowledgement by the

agent in charge that if you're going to be a Klansman and you

happen to be with someone

and they decide to do something, that

he couldn't be an angel. These were the words of the agent,.

and be a good informant.. He wouldn't take the lead; but the

implication is that he would have to go along and would have

to be involved if he was going to maintain his credibility.

Mr. Adams.. There's no question but that an informant at

times. will have to be present. during demonstrations, riots,

fistfights that take place, but I believe his statement was

to the effect that - and I was sitting in the back of the

someone with a chain or not, but I rather doubt that he did

How does the gathering of information -

we probably should recess a few minutes.

Could we have Senator Mathias' questions and then should

question.

Senator Tower. Go ahead.

Senator Huddleston, I wanted to ask how the selection of

information about an individual's personal life, social, sex

life and becoming involved in that sex life or social life

is a requirement for law enforcement or crime prevention.

Mr. Adams. Our agent handlers have advised us on Mr.

Rowe, that they gave him no such instriction, they had no

such knowledge concerning it, and I can't see where it would

be.of any value whatsoever.

these instructions were given to an agent or an informant?

Mr. Adams. To get involved in sexual activity? No, sir.

Senator Huddleston. Thank you, Mr. Chairman:

Senator Tower. Senator Mathias.

Senator Mathias. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I would like to come back very briefly to the Fourth

Amendment considerations in connection with the use of informants

and in posing these questions we're not thinking of the one

time volunteer who walks in to an FBI office and says I have

story I want to tell you and that's the only time that you

may see him. I'm thinking of the kind of situations in which

there is a more extended relationship which could be of varying

degrees. It might be in one case that the same individual.

will' have some usefulness in a number of situations. But when

the FBI orders a regular agent to engage in a search, the

first

test is a judicial warrant, and what I would like

to explore

with you is the difference between a one time search which

requires a warrant, and which you get when you make that

search, and a continuous search which uses an informant, or

the case of a continuous search which uses a regular undercover

agent,

someone who is totally under your control; and is in a

slightly different category than an informant.

Mr. Adams. Well, we get there into the fact that

the

Supreme Court has still held that the use of informants does

not invade any of these constitutionally protected areas, ,and

if a person wants

to tell an informant something. that isn't

protected by the Supreme Court.

An actual search for legal evidence, that is a protected

item, but information and the use of informants have been

consistently held as not posing any constitutional problems.

Senator Mathias.

I would agree, if you're talking about

the fellow who walks in off the street, as I said earlier,

but is it true that under existing procedures informants are

given background checks?

MI. Adams. Yes, sir.

Senator Mathias. And they are subject to a testing period

Mr. Adams. That's right, to verify and make sure they

are providing to us reliable information.

Senator Mathias. And during the period that the relation-

ship continues, they are rather closely controlled by the

handling agents.

• Mr. Adams. That's true.

Senator Mathias. So in effect they can come in a very

practical way agents themselves to the FBI.•

MI. Adams.. They can do nothing --

Senator Mathias. Certainly agents in the common law

of the word:

MI. Adams.

That's right, they can do nothing, and we

instruct our agents that an informant can do nothing that the

agent himself cannot do, and if the agent can work himself into

an organization in an undercover capacity, he can sit there and

glean all the information that he wants, and that is not in the

Constitution as a protected area. But we do have this problem.

Senator Mathias. But if a regular agent who is a inember

of the FBI attempted to enter these premises, he would require

a warrant?

Mr. Adams.

No, sir, if a regular. -- it depends on the

purpose for which he is entering. If a regular agent by

concealing his identity, by - was admitted as a member of the

Communist Party, he can attend Communist Party meetings, and he

can enter the premises,

he can enter the building, and there's

no constitutionally invaded area there.

Senator Mathias. And so you feel that anyone who has

a less formal relationship with the Bureau than a regular

agent, who can undertake a continuous surveillance operation

as an undercover.agent.or as an informant.-

Mr. Adams.

As long as he commits no illegal acts.

Senator Mathias.

Let me ask you why you feel that it is

impractical to require a warrant since,.as I understand it,

headquarters must approve the use of an informant. Is that

degree of formal action required?

Mr. Adams. The main difficulty is the particularity

which has to be shown in obtaining a search warrant. You

have to go after particular evidence.

You have to specify

what you're going after, and an informant operates in an •

area that you just cannot specify. He doesn't know what's

going, to be discussed at that meeting. It may be a plot to

blow up the capitol again or it may be a plot to blow up the

State Department building.:

you would have little difficulty with probable cause, wouldn't

you?

Mx. Adams. We would have difficulty in a warrant to

use someone as an informant in that area because the same

afficulty of particularity exists. We can't specify.

Senator Mathias. I understand the problem because it's

very similar to one that we

discussed earlier in connection

say wiretaps on a national security problem.

Mr. Adams. That's it, and there we face the problem of

where the Soviet, an individual identified as a Soviet spy

in a friendly country and they tell us he's been a Soviet spy

there and now he's coming to the United States, and if we can't

show under a probable cause warrant, if we couldn't show that

he was actually engaging in espionage in the United States,

we couldn't get a wiretap under the probable cause requirements

which have been discussed. If the good fairy didn't arop the

evidence in our hands that this individual is here conducting

espionage, we again would fall short of this, and that's

why we're still groping with it:

Senator Mathias. When you say fall short, you really,

you would be falling short of the requirements of the Fourth

Amendment.

Mr. Adams.

That's right, except. for the fact that the

• President, under this Constitutional powers, to protect this

nation and make sure that it survives first, first of all

national survival, and these are the areas that not only the

President but the Attorney General are concerned in and we're

all hoping that somehow we can reach a legislative middle

ground in here.

and the fBI and everyone concerning the need to get these

areas resolved.

Senator Mathias.

And you believe that the Department,

if we could come together, would support, would agree to that

kind of a warrant requirement if we could agree on the language?

MI. Adams. If we can work out problems and the Attorney

General is personally interested in that also.

Senator Mathias. Do you think that this agreement night

extend to some of those other areas. that we talked about?

Mr. Adams. I think that that would be a nuch greater

difficulty in an area of domestic intelligence informant who

reports on many different operations and different types of

activities that might come up rather than say in a Soviet

espionage or a foreign espionage case where you do have a little

more degree of specificity to

deal with.

Senator Mathias. I suggest that we arrange to get

tosether and try out some drafts with each other, but in the

meantime, of course, there's another alternative and that

would be the use of wiretap procedure by which the Attorney

General must approve a wiretap before it is placed, and the

same general process could be used for informants, since

you come to headquarters any way. :

Mr. Adams. That could be an alte sitive. I think it

24

would be a very burdensome alternative id I think at some

25

point after we attack the major abuses, or what are considered

major abuses of Congress and get over this hurdle, I think

we're still going to have to recognize that heads of agencies

have to accept the responsibility for managing that agency

and we can't just keep pushing every operational problem up

to the top because there just aren't enough hours in the day.

Senator Mathias. But the reason that parallel suggests

itself is of course the fact that the wiretap deals generally

with one level of information in one sense of gathering

information.

You hear what you hear from the tap.

Mr. Adams. But you're dealing in a much smaller number

also.

• .

Senator Mathias. Smaller nunber, but that's all the

more reaSon.

When an informant goes in, he has all of his

senses.

He's gathering

all of the information a human being

can

acquire from a situation and has access to more information

than the average wiretap.

And it would seem to me that for that reason a parallel

process might be useful

and in order.

Mr. Adams. Mr. Mintz pointed out one other main

distinction. to me which I had overlooked fron our prior

discussions, which is the fact that with an informant he is

more in the position of being a concentral monitor in that one

of the two parties to the conversation agrees, such as like

concentral monitoring of telephones and microphones and

anything else versus the wiretap itself where the individual

If I'm the third party overhearing a conversation that is taking

place in a room where I am, and my true character isn't perceived

by the two people who are talking, in effect they haven't

consented to my overhearing my conversation. Then they consent

if they believe that I am their friend or their, a partisan

of theirs.

But if they knew in fact that I was an informant for

someone else,

they wouldn't be consenting.

MI. Adams. Well, that's like I believe Senator llart

raised earlier, that the courts thus far have made this.

distinction with no difficulty. but that doesn't mean that

there may not be some legislative compromise which might be

addressed.

Senator Mathias. Well, I particularly appreciate your

attitude in being willing to work on these problems because

I think that's the most important thing that can evolve from

these hearings, so that we can actually look at the lourth

Amendment as the standard that we have to achieve. But the

way we get there is obviously going to i"

can work toward them together.

I just have one final question, 'is. Chairman, and that

deals with whether we shouldn't impose a standard of probable

cause that a crime has been committed as a means of controlling

the use of informants and the kind of information that they

collect.

Do you feel that this would be too restrictive?

MI. Adans. Yes, sir, I do.

When I look at informants and I see that each year

informants provide us, locate 5000 dangerous fugitives, they

provide subjects in 2000 more cases, they recover $86 million

in stolen property and contraband, and that's irrespective

of what we give the local law enforcement and other rederal

agencies, which is almost a comparable figure, we have almost

reached a point in the criminal law where we don't have much

left. And in the intelligence field we still, I think when

we carve all of the problems away, we still have to make sure

that we have the means to gather information which will permit

us to be aware of the identity of individuals and organizations

that are acting to overthrow the government of the United

States. And I think we still have some areas to look hard

at as we have discussed, but I think informants are here to.

am I carrying out this?

It's here to say. It's been

here throughout history

and there will always be informants. And the thing we want to

avoid is abuses. like provocateurs, criminal activities, and

to ensure that we have safeguards that will prevent that.

But we do need informants.

Senator l'ower.

Senator Hart, do you have any further

questions?

Senator llart of Michigan. Yes. I ask unanimous request

perhaps with a view to giving balance to the record, the

groups that we have discussed this morning into which the

Bureau has put informants, in popular language, our liberal

groups -- I would ask unanimous consent that. be printed in

that he was organizing a group to counter the American Civil

Liberties Union and other "liberal and comnunist groups,"

Senator Tower. Without objection, so ordered.

said FRIEDMAN indicated that the FBI had given MONTGOMERY

MONTGOMERY tOld FRIEDMAN that this was not true, that he

received his information from the Sheriff's Office in Alameda

County.

FRIEDMAN also indicated that MONTGOMERY had received

information concerning ANGELA DAVIS and the guns used in

the Marin County shootout in which several people were :

killed. MONTGOMERY told FRIEDMAN that this was not true,

that he had received this information from the Marin County

Sheriff's Office and

that the FBI was not involved in this

case at that point but did later have an unlawful flight

warrant on DAVIS, which resulted in her eventual arrest in

New York!

MONTGOMERY again told FRIEDMAN that he had many,

many sources and that he was not the recipient of information

volunteered to him by the FBI.

MONTGOMERY commented that

FRIEDMAN obviously did not want to believe this.

MONTGOMERY furnished this for information.
