CIA HISTORICAL-REVIEW PROGRAM.

APPROVED FOR REL SEE 1553

CUMST OREAL REVIEW PROGRAM

Masferrer claimed that his Haiti invasion

plot was approved by the U. S. Government (varying

between the ClA and the FBI as the approving

agency). While the CIA approval Claim was untrue,

Agency concern, at the time, centered around the

possibility of

compromise of sources and methods if the Agency

was forced to disprove Masferrer's charges in

court.

A handwritten note in Masferrer's file

revealed that he died in 1975 when his car was

blown apart by a bomb in Florida. No further

details regarding his death were

contained in

his subject files.

Since Masferrer has never

been affiliated with the Agency, despite his

claims, it is believed that Dade County officials

should be referred to the FBI for information

regarding Masferrer.

C.

Luciano Nieves--Office of Security files

contain only polygraph (IRD #72675) infornation

regarding Luciano Nieves Mestre, date and place

of birth 6 October 1933, Santa Clara, Cuba.

Nieves was, polygraphed on 4 February 1966 in

Florida. It was developed that he was a Cuban

national who had been arrested, tried, and

sentenced to 20 years in

Cuba for allegedly

being involved in an anti-Castro plot. He was

released in March-1965 after serving approxi-

mately lo months of his sentence and went to

Spain briefly where he was of interest to the

Madrid Station.

In August 1965he entered the

United States and in November 1965 was contacted

by Directorate of Operations (DIO) representatives.

From November 1965 until approximately January

1966 he was of operational interest to the DDO.

It is noted that the DDO maintains

201 file (201-788521) regarding Subject and it

is believed that the Office of Security would

have to defer any decision regarding

the release

of information concerning Nieves to the DDO.
