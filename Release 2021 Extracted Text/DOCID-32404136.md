MEMORANDUM FOR:

FROM:

SUBJECT:

REFERENCE: -

J. Kenneth McDonald

Chief, CIA History Staff

E. Page Moffett

Deputy Director of Congressional Affairs

Request for Access to HSCA Records

-

Your Memorandum dtd 13 April 1992:

Same

Subject (CSI 92-0201)

1. In the reference, you requested approval for all

members of CSI to have access to all records that CIA holds

relevant to the HSCA investigation into President Kennedy's

assassination.. Upon receiving this approval, CSI would

request affected components to transfer custody of the 64

boxes of material in question to CSI.

2. Today, I called Michael O'Neil, Special Assistant

to the Speaker of the House of Representatives.

Mr. O'Neil

serves as the focal point for questions arising with respect

to the segregated HSCA collection.

I informed Mr. O'Neil of

'your request, noted that the DCI had promised an expeditious

review of these documents, and requested his concurrence to

proceed with the transfer of custody. Initially, Mr. O'Neil)

wondered whether this action would frustrate the purposes of,

the Joint Resolution currently being considered by the

Congress. Specifically, since the documents would be

provided to a Review Board pursuant to the resolution, would

transfer at this time to the CSI hinder that purpose?

told Mr. O'Neil that if the Joint Resolution passed in its

current form, we would instruct the CSI to transfer the .

holdings to the Board. If the Joint Resolution did not

pass, we would have a

head start on reviewing the documents.

3. I then informed Mr. O'Neil that the new historical

review group would have at least fifteen officers and that

this group would likely review the material. Mr. O'Neil

then stated that he concurred in the transfer of custody and

in the request for access by CSI personnel.

4. Based on this conversation, I have signed the '

reference indicating my approval of your request. During

the course of your review, you should continue to coordinate

closely with Litigation Division, OGC, and this Office to

ensure that decisions to release are consistent with

litigation and other requirements.

4.

Please call me on x35467 if I may be of any further

assistance.
