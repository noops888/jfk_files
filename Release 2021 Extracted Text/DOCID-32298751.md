Re SAC Letter 53-58 dated 8/25/53, and Pittsburgh letter to the Bureau dated

9/28/56.

On November 21, 1956, PG 545-0, who in the past has supplied reliable

information, advised SA JOHN S. PORTELLA that about one month ago he was

talking with "Hog" WILSON, Merwin, Pennsylvania, regarding an option on

640 acres of land, and after talking to WILSON he learned that • S. MRAN,

a real estate agent in New Kensington, was also interested in the land.

Informant said he had heard that both

the Aluninum Company of America and

Westinghouse had this land site in mind for a research center and informant

could not understand MRAN's interest in the property.

Informant said he

went to MORAN and talked to him about the property and MORAN denied that

he was interested in it in any sense. Informant said that on the same date

he went to SAM MANNARIN 's office at the Nu-Ken Iron and Steel Company and

saw on SAMes desk a note from MORAN, who wanted SAM to call him back imme-

diately about the WILSON property.

Informant said he never connected MORAN

with the MANNARINOs until this incident. Informant said that since this

incident he has talked to MANNARINO, who has indicated that he does now

have an interest in the WILSON property. Informant described WILSON as an

old millionaire farmer who owns thousands of acres in the New Kensington

area and who also owns a large part of the Kiski Bank. Informant advised

that SAM MANNARINO is very interested in buying up large tracts of land for

cash. Informant said that MANNARINO recently purchased 300 acres at $100

an acre near Weinels Crossing and MANNARINO has told informant that he has

the inside track on the proposed New Kensington Airport site. SAM MANNARINO

also told informant that he has been getting most of his cash fron his

brother KELLY MANNARINO and informant has no idea where KELLY is getting it.

Lar at to the 1o

Informant stated that gambling in New Kensington and surrounding area is

completely dominated by KELLY MANNARINO, brother of SAM, and this control

could account for KELLYis possession of large amounts of cash.

Informant suggested that the MANNARINOS! contact in the New Kensington

Telephone Company may be the sister of GENEVIEVE MORENO, who has a sister:

Brush Manufacturing Company

and what a lucrative business

it was.

several jears ago, and at that time they were being

We wishes he had

saved his money like his brother, GABRIEL

LANNARINO, aka. "KELLY!"

The informant stated that it is

his guess

that SAM MANNERINO is handling most of the

legitimate enterprises for the MANNARINOS while GABRIEL

controls: the gambling and other illicit enterprises.

It is to be noted that the above information referring

to the true and false set of books has been made available

to the Internal Revenue Service by appropriate letter by

the Pittsburgh Office.

On 5/11/56, PG 545-C advised SA PORTELLA that SAM MANNARINO

had been recently making trips to Chicago for an unknown

purpose. Informant claimed that MANNARINO, for the past

two months, has been paying him $200 a week for his work

in locating property which MANNARIN has been purchasing•

Practically all of the property purchased by MANNARINO

is done so in the name of a relative or an employee of

the Nu-Ken Iron and Steel Company of New Kensington.

MANNARINOS continue to maintain an interest in the

furnished reliable information in the past, advised

SA PORIELLA that the bookmaking operations, recently

disturbed by the Federal Internal Revenue Service, have

moved to the Laetus Club, located on Fifth Avenue near

the Kenmawr Hotel and that the operation is strictly

MANNARINO controlled. ZERVIS stated that telephone bets

are channeled to the

following numbers: Edison 9-9209 and

Edison 5-7871.

He stated that a young New Kensington man

named DE PHILLIPS, nicknamed "ATI," handles the telephone

business for the MANNARINOS. ZERVIS further stated that

the MANNERINOS control the numbers racket in New Kensington. i

ZERVIS further advised that FRINKID PHILLIPS, father of

young FRANKIE PHILLIPS, is hated by SAM MANNARINO but

respected by GABRIEL MANNARINO because GABRIEL realizes

that FRINKIE PHILLIPS remains very close to BILLYNOWE

ind Judge BAUER, both of New kensington, who have a

solitical control of all rackets and gambling i

Westmoreland County. According to ZERVIS, GABRIEL

MANNARINO continues to operate his gambling establishments

and rackets and, therefore, must show FRINKIE PHILLIPS
