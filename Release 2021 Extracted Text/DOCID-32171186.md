MEXICAN AUTHORITIES HAVE INFORMED US THAT THE NICARAGUANg

ALRADO, AFTER A LONG INTERROGATION, HAS CONFESSED IN A SIGNED.

STATEMENT HE DID NOT SEE OSWALD IN THE CUBAN CONSULATE HERE ON

SEPTEMBER 18 OR AT ANY OTHER TIME AND THAT HE DID NOT SEE ANYONE

PASS MONEY TO OSWALD. ALVARADO SAID HIS MOTIVE FOR CLAIMING

THE PASSAGE OF MONEY

TO OSWALD WAS TO INVOLVE THE UNITED STATES

IN A WAY WHICH WOULD RESULT IN THE OVERTHROW OF CASTRO:

Exte

BOTH THE LEGAL ATTACHE AND THE&CAS

REPRESENTATIVE BELIEVE THAT

ALVARADO'S STATEMENT TO THE MEXICANS MUST BE ACCEPTED AS

FACT THIS OBINION IS CONCURRED IN BY NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT

INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL FRANKLIN WHEELOCK GARCIA WHO PERSONALLY(S)

KNOWS ALVARADO AND WHO,

WHILE HE DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE

INVESTIGATION, WHICH WAS CONDUCTED ENTIRELY BY MEXICANS,

WAS STANDING BY ADVISING WITH THE MEXICAN AUTHORITIES DURING

THE LATTER PART OF THE INTERROGATION WE ARE THEREFORE PROCEEDING

HERE ON THE THEORY THAT THE ALVARADO STORY ABOUT HAVING SEEN

MONEY PASS MUST BE COMPLETELY DISCOUNTED.

INOT CURRENTLY HAVE A GOOD BASIS FOR REQUESTING ADDITIONAL

INVESTIGATION•

AZCUE WOULD BE THE NUMBER ONE SUSPECT IN

CUBAN CONSULATE AND HE DEPARTED

MEXICO FOR HAVANA ON NOVeMBER

18 AND HAS NOT RETURNED.

THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDING ESPECIAKLY

THE DORTICOS-HERNANDEZ ARMAS TELEPHONE CONVERSATIONS WHICH REMAIN

UNEXPLAINED• WE SHALL CONTINUE TO LOOK HERE FOR PEOPLE WHO

SAW OSWALD WHILE HE WAS IN MEXICO BUT WE HAVE NO BASIS AT THIS

TIME FORTAN OPTIMISTIC ESTIMATE THAT WE SHALL BE ABLE TO FIND

ANYTHING DEFINETIVE ON THE CENTRAL ISSUEd
