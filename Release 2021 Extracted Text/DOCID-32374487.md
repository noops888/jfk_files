C. Advleed that NSA "shall act for the Executive Agent in all

CO:SEC matters set forth below" - primarily responsibilities for estab-

116h108 adequate standards;

Defined CONSEC as

be derived from the poscession and study of telecamunications, or to

mislead unauthorized persons In their Interpretation of the results of

suda a study";

e. Defined telecommunications as "any transulscions, emicsion or

reception of 51g0,

signals, writing, 1mages and soundo or intelligence

of any nature by wire, radio, visual or other electromagnetic system".

NSA prescribes Governuent-wide standards for the means of encryption -

equipments, codes or other techaiques - and only those approved by NSA

may be used for the encryption of cinosified Information. NSA also

develops equipsents where required. CONSEC equipments are available

today to encrypt all standard communications rethods - telephones

veletypewriter, high-speed data, television (black and walte only), even

computer-to-computer transmissions•

However, NSA has no authority to require encryption; the requirement for

encryption is left to the agency head under the EO 10501.

Moreover, they

are positively pronibited iron monitoring telecomunications to determine

wnetber classified Information 16 being revealed unless the agency bead

concerned approves in advance.

To dute, there are no known telecomunications techniques which would

peralt uncrcarted (clear) information to be transmitted sare iron inter-

ception and frat being read by unauthorized fersons. As a result, the

• S. CONSEC Board and NSA make the assumotion that all unencrupted tele

ormunications are being nonitored and that the information being trans

mitted is comprosised.

Waile this 1s a physical Inpossibility, there can

be no assurance that any particular tronsalssion is not being intercepted

and read.

Therefore, lisA will assure no responsibility for the security

of cormunications which are not encrypted in an antroved cryptosyster.

The Walte House Co-munications Agency (WICA) 16 responsible for, providing

all telecommunications for the President und iu the inite louse, except

for carmunications to and fros the President's aircrait (Air Force I),

which are the responsibility, of the Mr Force. Wich 16 Orgnnizationalls

under the Defense Communications Ageacy (DÇA). Tie NiCA program has not

been reviewed by the Bureau. Kenneth O'Donnell provides policy guidance

to the WiCA and has Informed the DCA that no Inio mation on the size,

program, or budget of the WHiCA 1s to be revealed without his authority.
