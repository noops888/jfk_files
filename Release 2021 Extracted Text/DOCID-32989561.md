DOMINICAN LOBBYING ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES

INTERNAL SECURITY - DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

On lebruary 16, 1961, a confidential informant, who

has furnished reliable information in the past, advised that

Walter Surrey, a Washington, D. Co, attorney, formerly registered

with the Department of Justice

as & Dominican agent regarding

sugar matters, contacted Christine s. Gallagher, Clerks, House

01 Representatives Comnittee on Agriculture, and told her that

he was in Washington, D.C., for a short period of time, having

returned from New York City on that evening.. He indicated

that he was returning to New York City on the midnight plane

and would meet with Representative Harold D. Cooley, North,

Carolina, at 9:30 a.ño, lebruary 17, 1961.

Surrey stated that

he had decided not to

atiend "the meeting" because "the tyo

there would be less

likely to talk in his presence. It is

noted. that & meeting is scheduled at the Hotel Madison, New

JOrE CITy, between 11:00 and 11:30 a.ñ., February 17, 1961,

between (Cooley) and Dominican ofiicials Jesus Maria VIonCOSo

and Oscar Guaron, GinebIa.

Surrey indicated that Troncoso was

in Washington, D.C., on the night of February 16, 1961, and he

planned to confer with Troncoso prior to departing for

New York

City.

The informant related that Surrey reported to

Gallagher what transpired at the meeting Surrey had with Adolf:

Berle, of the United States Department. of Stute, on the night

of February 16, 1961. According to surrey, he was with berle

for approximately one hour and a hurt.

doing.

When questioned by. Berle regarding the chances of

success, Surrey had stated that they were very slim?

Gallagher was interested to know whether berle

agreed with what Cooley contemplated since she felt that Cooley

could get into trouble.

Surrey felt that Berle believed that

the odds are one in a million

for success and had asked' Surrey

to suggest someone to "handle this." In reply, Surrey had

stated that he would like to hear some suggestions from Berle

rogarding this.

According to Surray, Berle had no suggestions

to make.

It was pointed out by surrey that both he and Berle

agreed that the matter obviously could be handled by no one

in the present administration.

RS: DOMINICAN LOBBYING ACTIVITIDS

• IN THE UNITED STATES

In reply to a question from Berle, Surrey had stated

that he personally had informed (Cooley) that

the odds were

against success in the matter but Surrey saw "no risk" in an

attempt in the matter. Berle had agreed that there was probably

no risk it the matter was handled properly.

With regard to Surrey's appointment with(Cooley at

9:50 aomo, february la, 1901,

In new York City, Surrey stated

that he had notified (Cooley.)of this through Bob Shields,

• Surrey stated that with regara to shielas.

he wished that Cooley was not staying with Shields. Surrey

was oi the opinion that Cooley had made an error "in attempting

this" but since Cooley has commenced action in this regard,

Surrey felt that "we" must help him "through it." In reply to

a query from Gallagher, Surrey stated that he did not believe

there would be any later repercussions.

It was the opinion of

Surrey that the matter would have succeeded a year ago.

Gallagher was in agreenent with this but stated that "we" could

not do anything with the state Department a year ago..

According to Surrey, Berle felt that he had inherited

the problem at which time Surrey told Berle that he could not

rus from the problem.

Surrey had

pointed out to Berle that the

people who are presently advising Berle on matters are the ones

who had prevented "it" a year ago. Berle had requested that

Surrey specifically identify whom

he had in mind at which time

Surrey had stated that the individual responsible was "Vro Manz."

When Berle had asked Surrey's opinion of Mann, Surrey had

indicated that lann was a close friend of his; however, Surrey

felt that Mann should be sent "to the lield.". At this point

Gallagher pointed out that Mann would be leaving as Ambassador

to Mexico but lamented the fact that Mann would not depart for

the new post for six more months. She felt that Mann was going

to walt until he was successful in getting "this thing through

Congress and

all fouled up."

Surrey concluded by reporting that he would return

to Washington, D.C., on the afternoon of February 17, 1961.

With regard to Bob Shields, mentioned above, It is

noted that on day 6, 1960, another confidential informant, who

has furnished reliable information in the past; advised that..

Robert H. Shields, who identified hinself as the President of

the United States Beet Sugar Association, was giving a luncheon

Ior Troncoso and Ginebra at the Carlton Hotel, Washington, D.C.,

on that date. According to the informant, Shields desired that

the then Dominican Ambassador, Luis F. Thomen, be present at the

It was poinica out that Ironcoso would join with

and

Iô, 1901, in Washingion,

Dominican otiicials wore io again meet with representative

Cooley at 4:00 p.n., February 20,1901, in washington, D. C.

Eckert commonted thai Ironcoso was very downnearted

when informed by sciert of the meeting in New Iork City with

¡epresentative Cooley. She stated that ironcoso waitad at th

Dominican Sugar Office until he heard from De Moya and Cinebra.

Both Gallagher and Eckert expressed sympathy and liking for

Troncoso. Gallagher felt that it was good that Ironcoso vould

join in the meeting on February 18: 1961, at which time Eciert

comnented that Ironcoso would likewise join in the meeting with

Representative (Cooley) on February 20, 1961.

In view of Ironcoso's mood on February 17, 1901, because

of the above, Eckert stated that she had not mentioned anything

to ironcoso regarding what had taken place in a previous meeting

eckert had with Representative Cooley. Her reason for not

mentioning this was the fact that she did not desire to make

Ironcoso feel worse.

It was pointed out by Gallagher that

Representative Cooley had not indicated to de Moya or GIrobia

Gallagher indicated that she also would be in attendaace

accepted

a luncheon engagement at Deane's residence for

February 18, 1961. The invitation included De Moya and Ginebra

that the individuals involved could talk privately."

WF I-3 subsequently advised on february 18, 1961, that

Deane was in contact with Walter Surey (fornerly registered with

the Department of justice as au agent of the josinican Republic)

and advised Surrey that De Moya, Ironcoso and Ginebra would be

at his residence that date for lunch. In answer to

a question

from Deane,

Surrey stated that Representative(Cooley)had apparently

told De Moya and Ginebra that it was getting increasingiy difficult

to hold to his present position.

Representative Cooley) had asked

the Dominicans

Surrey

stated that representative Cooley believes that the best he can

do is maintain the present basic quota. Ihe Dominicans and

Representative Cooley discussed the "election laws" and the

Dominicans told Representative (Cooley) that the recent elections

in the Dominican Republic were orderly and well run.

Deane asked why Representative Cooley) wanted the

vominicans to confer with Representatives Poage and Thompson.

Surrey said that Representative Poage) is the person who has

supported Representative Cooley, and Representativs Thompson is

interested in the problem. With regard to this, Deane commented

that the Dominicans did not desire Deane's presence at the meeting

with Representatives (Poage )and Thompson which he felt was "just

as well."

Deane wondered whether in the meeting of February 17,

1961, "the other subject" was discussed. Surrey stated that as

far as he knew it had not been discussed.

Attached is a memorandum which contains additional

details concerning developments in this situation.

You will

note that the Dominicans:

although not optimistic, continue

to make every effort to line up support for their position.

In this regard, one of the sources in the enclosure

(WF I-1) advised on February 19, 1961, that Marco de Peña,

Dominican Consul General, Washington, D. Co,

was in contact:

with Ambassador Virgilio Diaz-Ordonez, Dominican Delegate

to the Organization of American States (OAS).

Diaz-Ordlonez

felt the Dominican Republic needed a "point of support" in the

United States Department of State since the Dominican position

is completely dependent upon the attitude adopted by the

United States in the OAS.

Diaz-Ordonez felt that what

sgally is needed is the active friendship of some official

in the Department of State who can act to "moderate or

Blunti the present United States attitude.

He mentioned that

"Billy!"' (last name not given) used to be in a position to

racomplish this but has now lost out "almost completely"

Ginebra apparently agreed with Diaz-Ordonez that

the place for Dominican action was within the O4S. Diaz-

Ordonez flatly stated that the OiS is nothing more or less

than a branch of the United States Department of State.

Diaz-Ordonez ielt that the Dominican Republic needed a "point

to give some' support toward the withdrawal of AS sanctions

against the Dominican Republic.

It was ielt by Diaz-Ordonez that what really is

needed is the active friendship of some official in the

United States Department of State who can act to "moderate

or blunt" the present United States attitude. In this

regard he commented that Billy, mentioned above, used to be

in a position to accomplish this; however, Billy has now

lost out "almost completely" as a result of the defeat of

Richard M. Nixon.

Diaz-Ordonez commented that Billy now

has his hands full trying to recuperate from his loss and

regain esteem in the eyes of the new Administration. It

was the opinion of Diaz-Ordonez that Billy will leave no

stone unturned in order to accomplish this. Due to this,

Diaz-Ordonez felt that Billy is untrustworthy.

Informant stated that Diaz-Ordonez said that the

Dominican Republic has some friends in the OAS but these

friends withdraw when approached for aid at the present time

with the observation that this is a gigantic task and in

effect amounts to an attempt to manipulate the United States

Government itself. The informant stated that in conclusion

both Diaz-Ordonez and De Pena agreed that the "question of

the hour' would be resolved one way or another on February 20,

1961.

^ On February 19, 1961, VF I-2, who has furnished

reliable information in the past, advised that an individual

known only to the informant as Arthur was in contact with

Asuncion Ickert, Administrator, Dominican Sugar

Office,

The informant stated that ickert asked

srthur whether he was cognizant of what had been happening

with respect to the meeting in New York City on February 17,

1961, between Representative Harold D Cooley, North Carolina,)

and Dominican officials. Arthur stated that he was aware of

developments up to that

point and in his opinion "the die is

cast."

He did not feel that anything would be accomplished.

Ickert felt that "the bill" would be introduced on

Honday, February 20, 1961. Arthur disagreed by stating that

it was

his understanding that Representative Cooley) was

awaiting a communication fron the Administration.

He clarified

this by revealing that he had attended the "Sugar Club"

Luncheon in New York City on February 16, 1961, at which

Representative (Cooley) introduced the speaker and made statements

concerning "which way

the wind was bloving."

Based on these

statenents, arthur ielt that Representative (Cooley)was avaiting

"some sort oi conmunication from the Department which puts iI

writing what they said to him at the conierence."

ackert stated that she had seen lepresentative Cooley

alone "the other day" and Representative Cooley had explained

the "whole thing to her."

Eckert had explained

(Cooley)

to Representative

that she did not feel that she should take the full

responsibility and had therefore taken De Pena with hes to meet

with representative Cooley the following day.

according to

Ickert, De Pena also had reservations and because of this

and due to Representative (Cooley's suggestion that he must

meet someone with whom he could "talk turkey," the "three

men" came from the Dominican Republic to neet with Representative

Cooley.

arthur was oi the opinion that the Dominican Republic

would get only its regular sugar quota.

Eckert desired to

know Arthur's opinion as to who the recipients of the non-

quota allotments would be. Arthur indicated that "Lariy"

desired the sugar but anyone who knows what has been going

on and under the present circumstances would not get mixed

up in the matter.

arthur indicated that due to this, he would

not become involved and he thought it was foolish that

D.C, Michael B.YDeane (who is registered with the Department of

man, Justice as

an agent oi the Dominican republic, would sign a

contract with the Dominican Republic under the present

circumstances. Irthur indicated that he could not consci

entiously do what Deane has done and it was Arthur's opinion

that the Dominicans were crazy to "throw money away like

that."

De Pena could not "stand him." It was obvious to the informant

that Eckert was not aware of the fact that Deane is registered

with the Department of Justice inasmuch as she commented that

Deane should register because he

"goes around as our representative

and counselor."

At this point, Arthur stated that "the cards have

been stacked against Trujillo."

It was the opinion of Ickert

that it was Trujillo's "own fault."

Arthur agreed and lamented

the fact that the Dominican Republic wastes money by hiring

"these disreputable individuals."

Arthur compared this with

the "waste of money" involving Alexander I. Guterma and the

Mutual Broadcasting System wherein Trujillo paid Guterma

$750,000 to transmit favorable information regarding the

Dominican Republic over the Mutual Broadcasting System

Arthur indicated that the situation as it presently stanetwork.

With regard to Deane, Eckert expressed the opinion

-that Waltery Surrey (a Washington attorney formerly registered

'Of the Dominican Republic) vas the individual

responsible for putting Deane in" the picture." Eckert doubted

¿hat Deane possessed the "pull in Congress" he is reputed to

have.

Arthur agreed and

stated that representative (Cooley

"doesn't even know him."

Arthur was of the opinion that the ansver to the

problem of the Dominican Republic was in the United States

Department of State. According to arthur, even Lawrence

Myers, Director, Sugar Division, Connodity Stabilization

Service, United

States Department of Agriculture) does not

know how the problem will be resolved.

When Ickert expressed

surprise at this statement, Arthur stated that he felt the

Department of Agriculture was "not in on it yet."

Arthur

further indicated that Adoll Berle of the United States

Department of state was "the guy" and at the moment is "Mr.

Sugar."

he stated that hepresentative cooley has agreed

with this observation.

At this point Arthur stated that he felt

that

Representative Cooley had thrown

"some darts at Mr. Mann

when he was talking to Dean Pusk" (Secretary Of State).

arthur stated that it was his opinion that when conterring

with hir. husk, Representative Cooley had let it be known

that he did not want policy in this matter set by Mr. lann.

Arthur stated that he was presently handling

affairs for the Puerto Rican-American Refineries and indicated

that this organization vanted to "get started in Florida."

Arthur vent on to say

"that fool should be dumping some of

his money in Florida." Arthur opined that if Trujillo had

any capital he wanted. to invest in the United States he

could not do better than invest it in Flocida with regard

to sugar. Eckert commented that she understood that the

Cubans were doing this.

On February 19, 1961, VF I-3, who has furnished

in the past,

reliable information in the past, advised that Deane was

in contact with Ginebra. Informant advised that Deane

inquired whether Ginebra had been able to see "some of the

Ambassadors today and some of the other people."

Ginebra

commented that this had been impossible but stated that on

Tuesday, February 21, 1961, "we have a meeting with some

people in the evening." Ginebra indicated that they did

not know where the meeting would take place or even the

Identitles of the people they would see; however, he did

state that Deane would attend the meeting.

The informant

stated that Deane was pleased to learn that he would also

attend the meeting.

Subsequently, on February 19, 1961, VP I-1

advised that Ginebra was in contact with an oificial of

• the Dominican Republic identified to the informant only

as Virgilio.

Ginebra reported that he was in lashington,

D. C., and had talked with Generalissimo Rafael L. Trujillo

on the morning of february 19, 1961. Ginebra stated that

Whether they should leave Thursday or stay a while longer.

Ginebra stated that it would depend on how the negotiations

Ginebra commented that there was pressure prejudicial

Dominicans would "come out all right."

they could wind up things in Washington. When instructed

not to fail to see Kaplan, Ginebra stated that as soon as

With apparent reference to his meeting with

Mr. /Cooley on March 3,

1961, referred to in my letter

dated March 6, 1961) Ginebra stated he had determined there

are some "filibusterers" who want to "torpedo" the basic

quota.

On March 3, 1961, you were furnished the results of

our review of income

tax returns of Lawrence Myers, William

Case and Tom O, Murphy, all employees of the Sugar

Division

of the Department of Agriculture.

Murphy's returns for the

years 1955 through 1957, which were not previously available,

have now been reviewed

and have been noted to contain no

indication he has received any income from Dominican sources.

These income tax returns were made available for review on

a very confidential basis.

Also of possible interest is the following

• information received by our San Juan Office on March

1, 1961,

from a source who has been contacted an insufficient number

of times to determine his reliability, but who formerly

was a member of the Dominican armed forces

for 13 years

and

was well acquainted with General Rafael L Irujillo, Jro, also

known as Ramfis Irujillo.

trouble with the American Government since he had paid

off many influential Americans

both in the Government and

in private business who,

because of their influence, would

be able to watch out for Dominican interests.

In this regard, the sourc. stated that in

approximately 1958. Senator George Ar:

Smathers of Florida,

during a visit to me cominican nepuviie, had receivea a

check in the approximate anuine vi

wour,000 from the Dominican

Government, The source said he did not see the check in

question,

but was told of its existence by a friend in the

Dominican Republic who held and may continue to hold a

position in the Dominican Budget Bureau,

This money

reportedly was paid to senator smathers

to secure from him

a Laudatory speech on behalf of Generalissimo Irujillo

which was given by senator Smathers

at an assembly of the

Dominican Congresse

This same source advised it is assumed to be a

fact in the Dominican Republic that MI, William Pawley of

Florida, who has oil concessions in the Dominican Republic.

also sepresents both the interests of Generalissimo Trujillo

and MI. Pawley's personal friend, Senator (Smathers"

source, therefore, assumes Mx. Pawley uses his influence in

American Government circles to advance Trujillo's interests.

This data apparently refers to William D. Pawley, former

United States Ambassador to Brazil, whose

name has previously

come up in this situation

In addition, the source commented it is rumored that

a brother of Mrse Dwight D. Eisenhower, wife of the former

President, owns

considerable stock in the Dominican sugar

industry, which is owned by Irujillo. The source, therefore,

suspected this individual, whose name was not known to the

source, possibly had some

part in securing the extension of

the purchase of sugar from the Dominican Republic after

sanctions by the Organization of American States were placed

in effect against the Dominican

• Republic.

The above possibly refers to hirs. Eisenhower's

brother-in-law, Colonel Gordon Moore, who was mentioned

py brew tearsong the columnist,

in his daily article

which appeared in the March 6, 1961, issue of the "Washington

Post and lines Herald."

Pearson stated Colonel Moore had

put across some

sugar deals with Trujillo as his partner.

take away from the Dominican Republie sugar profits which would

subsequently, on larch 10, 1901, Diaz Ordonez discussed

this action by the House Committee on Agriculture with Marco de

Pena, Minister Counselox, Dominican Delegation to the OAS,

Washington, D. C. Both agreed this was a serious matter for

the dominican Republic.

Also, on March 10, 1961, Cinabra reported to Generalissim

Trujillo in the Dominican Republic that the sugar matter had been

resolved that morning and he (Ginebra) had been successful in

keeping the basic sugar quota for the Dominican Republic.

Ginebra

explained the Committee gave the President power to dispose of

the extra quota as he saw fit.

Ginebra claimed he had been

successiul in arranging for the Dominican Republic not to be

specifically mentioned in the legislation and noted this had

been achieved through his conversations wich the Depariment oi

Agriculture.

Trujillo was also informed that the Dominican Republic

would be able to re-enter the United States sugar narket at any

appropriate future time.

Ginebra stated the "law" indicates

the quota is not to be awarded to nations which have to rolations

with the United States. Ginebra felt the Dominican Republic may

be able to make

some progress in the future, especially since its

Dasze quota was no aropped.

In this same connection, we learned that Deane

on March 24, 1961, contacted Ody Lamborn, mentioned above,

who stated he had

attended a conference on the night of

March 23, 1901, with some unnamed individuals at which the

Dominican Republic was discussed Lamborn felt the only

solution is to have Generalissimo Rafael Lo Trujillo of

the Dominican Republic retire. Deane felt the basic

problem is to change the policy of the United States and

the Dominicans should project their thinking toward

assuring themselves a place in the long-term sugar legis

lation

, which

will be enacted at a later date.

Deane

stated he had told Ginebra that a program must be devised

which Deane can sell to the Administration.

In addition to the above, our coverage of this

situation has developed the following data of possible

interest concerning the efforts of James Edward Powell,

a confidence man, to fleece the Dominicans of $15,000:

Commencing on March 22, 1961, Powell, using

the name of Mr. Cartwright, has been in contact with

officials of the Dominican Consulate and the Dominican

Mission to the Organization of American States (OAS),

Washington, D. C.,

on a number of occasions.

During

conversations with these officials, he has stated in

upstance that he is the nephew and Legal advisor o

senator Allen Jo Ellender, Louisiana,, and that the

Senator desired

him (Cartwright) to contact the Dominicans

in order to have an important message transmitted to

Generalissimo Trujillo pertaining to the current sugar

legislation.

On March 23, 1961, Michael Deane,

at the

cequest of bominican consul General Ginebra, contacte

the office of Senator Ellender/and was told that no one

by the

name of Cartwright is on the Senator's staff and

the Senator was not known to have a nephew working in

Washington, Do C.

It was further learned that Powell, posing as

cartwright, went to the Dominican vonsulate at lu:ou a mo,

March 24, 1961, after having first made an appointment.

He spoke

with liario Rodriguez, Consul, and stated the

Venezuelans were conducting a

According to our source, Ginebra laughingly stated that

Ar. Cooley definitely had been in the Dominican Republic

but he did not elaborate further. Deane also revealed

another mistake was in the article in that it indicated

$94,549.20 had been paid to him for a six-month period.

According to Deane, the sun was correct; however, it vas

to be paid over an eighteen-month period ending in

December, 1961.

In addition to the above, on April 6, 1961, we

received the following information which may possibly have

some relation to Dominican lobbying activities in this country:

A source who is in a position to furnish infor-

mation concerning certain Dominican activities in the

United States advised that Ginebra had received authorization.

to spend $50,000 to redecorate the residence of the

Dominican Consul General. The source advised that no one

connected with the Dominican Consulate could understand the

reason for such expensive renovations. However, the informant

speculated that Generalissimo Rafael u. Trujillo, as the

Dominican Representative to the United Nations, might come

to the United States in that capacity and the above residence

is being renovated in the event Trujillo visits

while in the United States.

This same source learned, during the past week, 'that

Ginebra, had made an inquiry relative to obtaining a quantity

of United States currency in denoninations of one thousand

and five hundred dollar bills. Ginebra indicated he wanted

more than an amount of $10,000 or $15,000.

The source

speculated that the money being sought by Ginebra may be

personal funds which he possibly has brought to the United States

in the event he desires to seek asylum in this country in

the future.

The source has recently heard from a third party

that Ginebra has made the statement he would seek asylum

in the United States if recalled to the Dominican Republic.

situation:

You have previously been advised of the reaction of

the Dominicans to a letter received from the Department indicating

that the Dominican Sugar Office and its personnel are required

to register under the provisions of the Foreign Agents

Registration Act of 1938, as amended.

In that regard, we have

learned that Mrs, Asuncion Eckert of

the Dominican Sugar Office

on April 5, 1961, made arrangements to confer with Arthur L.

Quinn; a Washington, Do Cos attorney, regarding her naving to

register with the Department as an agent of the

Dominican Republic.

She indicated this request for her

registration had

been made by the Department because someone

had "denounced" here

In this same regard, Quinn contacted Mrse

Eckert

on April 6, 1961,

and informed her that he had received

Later

that day Deane informed his wife that, since he (Deane) was

mentioned in the article, he felt he

should "retire from the

public scene for a while,"

His wife disagreed and stated

that he should not feel guilty.

It was also learned on April 6, 1961, that Deane while

discussing the article with Ody H. Lamborn of Lamborn and

Company, Incorporated, New York City, remarked that the

article was "pretty factual." Deane felt there was so much

activity by the Dominicans on Capitol Hill that the newspapermen

could see what was going on and this resulted in the story.

Deane said he had warned Ginebra regarding his traveling to

Capitol Hill too frequently and in doing so pointed out that

in the Summer of 1960 "they" had been effective and no one had

1960 "they nac

known "they were operating.!'

Deane further remarked that the story in "The

Reporter" pinpointed

their activities and contained some

"unfortunate quotes."

•In reply to a question from Berle, Suricy had stated

that he personally had informed exes that the odds were

against success in the matter but Surrey saw "no risk" in un

attempt in the matter.

Berle had agreed that there was probably

no risk 11 the matter was handled properly.

With regard to Surrey's appointment with ensuit at

9:30 a.M., lebruary 17.

1961, In New York City, Surrey stated

that he had notificdesuns of this through Bob Shields,

mentioned below.

Surrey stated that with regard to Shields,

he wished that aside was not staying with Shields.

Surrey

was of the opinion

that each had made an error "in attempting

this" but since d

• has commenced action in this regara,

Surrey felt that "we"

must help him "through it."

In reply to

a query from Gallagher, Surrey stated that he did not believe

there would be any later repercussions.

It was the opinion of

Surrey that the matter would have succeeded a year ago.

Gallagher was in greenent with this but stated that "re" could

not do anything with the State Department a year ago..

According to Surrey, Berle felt that he had inherited

the problem at which time surrey told Berle that he could not

run from the problem.

Surrey had pointed out to Berle that the

people who are presently advising Berle on matters are the ones

who had prevented "it" a year ago. Berle had requested that

Surrey specifically identify whom

ad to heave dia 20:

he had in mind at which time

Surcey had stated that the individual responsible was "jire llann."

When Berle had asled Surrey's opinion of Mann,

Surrey had

indicated that hann was a close friend of his; however, surrey

folt that Mann should be sent "to the field."

At this point

Gallagher pointed out that Mann would be leaving as Imbassador

to Mexico but lamented the fact that liann would not depart for

the new post for six more months.

She felt that lann was going

to wait until he was successful in getting "this thing through

Congress and all louled up."

Surrey concluded by reporting that he vould return

to Washington, D.C., on the afternoon of february 17, 1961.

With regard to Bob Shields, mentioned above, it is

noted that on day 6, 1960, another confidential informant, who

Representative

She stated thai izoacoso waitod at the

Dominican Sugar Office until he heard for du lova and Canebra.

Doin Gallagion and ückert expressed sympathy and liking for

Troncoso: Gallagher felt that it was good that Ironcoso rould

join in the meetingson Feiruary 18, 1961, at which time Eciert

commented that Ironcoso would likevise join in the meeting with

Representative 1

on February 20, 1961.

In, view of Ironcoso's mood on zebauary 17, 1901, because

of the above, Eckeri stated that she had not mentioned anything

to Ironcoso regarding what had taken place in a previous meeting

Eckert had with Representative

Far reason for not

mentioning this was the fact that she did not desire to make

Ironcoso feel worse.

It was pointed out by Gaülagher that

Representative Anal had not indicated to do joya or Gincora

.-thai he was aware ui the presence of Ironcoso in Washingion, D.C.

Gallagher indicatedthat she also rould be in attendunca

at the meeting between Representative Assass and the Dominicans

on February 20, 1961, and stated that She planned to greet

Troncoso cordially "in front of them." She desired to do this

in order to show these individuals how nuch respect Ironcoso

conmands in this country. Eckert felt that this would give

IIONCOSO

""a big lift's since she felt badly when Ironcoso was so

discouragic.

Ca February 18, 1901, WI I-3, who has furnished reliable

informataun in the past, advised that Ironcoso contacted Michael

Informant suated that Ironcoso

accepted a luncheon engagement at Deanc's residence for

February 18, 1901. Ine invitation included de Moya and Ginebra

engageant

and it was suaied thai the purpose of the invitation was so

that the individuals involved could stall privately."

WF I-3 subsequently auvised on february 18, 1961, that

Deane was in contact withwaiter Swrey (formerly registered vien

the dopartient of justice as in agenú of the corinican repubLic)

and advised Surrey that de Moya, Ironcoso and Ginabra vould be

at his residence that date for lunch. In answer to a question

from Deane, Surrey Stated that Representativedstly had apparently

told De Moyá and Gineira that it was getting increasingly difficult

to hold to his present position.

Representative &

a had asked

the Dominicans what they could do to

"improve things."

Surrey

stated that representativaesarah believes that the best he can

do is mairtain the present basic quota.

The Dominicans and

Representative e

way discussed the selection laws" and the

Dominicans told Representative e

*that the recent elections

in the Doninican Republic, were orderly and well run.

Deane asked why Representative

wanted the

Dominicans to confer with Representatives &

and Sites

Surrey said that representative exis is the person who has

supported rogresentative

ard Representativse

is

interested in the problen.

With regard to this, Deane conmented

that the Dominicans did not desire Deane's presence at the meeting

with Representatives

and sat which he felt was "just

•as well."

.

Deane wondered whether in the neeting of February 17,

1901, "the other subject" was discussed. Surrey stated that as

far as he knew it had not been discussed.

Diaz-Ordonez

felt the Dominican Republic needed a "point of support" in the

is completely dependent upon the attitude adopted by the

Diaz-Ordonez felt that what

sgally is needed is the active friendship of some official

contact with Ambassador VirgiliorDiaz Ordonez, Dominican

Delegate to the Organization of American States (OAS).

Diaz-Ordonez was questioned regarding his conference with

Oscar Guaros Ginebra, Dominican secretary Of state without

Portiolio.

According to Diaz-Ordonez, it appears that

Ginebra and "the others" are approaching the point of view

adopted by Diaz-Ordonez with respect to the Dominican

Republic's position in the osS.

In this connection, it was

stated that an individual by the name of Billy (last name

not given) had been consulted; however, Diaz-Ordonez felt

that this person was completely untrustworthy and an

opportunist.

/..

Ginebra apparently agreed with Diaz-Ordonez that

the place for Dominican action was within the O4S. Diaz-

Ordonez flatly stated that the O'S is nothing nore or less

than a branch of the United States Department of State.

Diaz-Ordonez felt that the Dominican Republic needed a

"point

of support" in the State Department since the Dominican

position is completely dependent uoon the attitude adopted

by the United States in the oAS

He felt that the main

trouble was the fact that the United States presently is the

most aggressively anti-Dominican member of the OAS.

added that the recent statement by United States Ambassador

Philip Bonsal epitomizes the whole problem since it sets

the entire "OAS mood."

Informant stated that Diaz-Ordonez enumerated with

qualifications and

reservations Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina

as najor ONS members favorably disposed toward the Dominican

Republic.

he lisied Haiti, Guatenala and Paraguay as being

inclined

to support the Dominican Republic provided that the

aggressive attitude of the United States is moderated.

to give some support

toward the

agaidst the Dominican Republic.

It was ielt by Diaz-Ordonez that what really is

needed is the active friendship of some official in the

United States Department of State who can act to "moderate

or blunt" the present United States attitude.

In this

regard he commented that Billy, mentioned above, used to be

in a position to accomplish this; however, Billy has now

was the opinion of Diaz-Ordonez that Billy will leave no

stone unturned in order to accomplish this.

Due to this,

Diaz-Ordonez felt that Billy is untrustworthy.

Informant stated that Diaz-Ordonez said that the

Doninican Republic has some friends in the OiS but these

friends withdraw when approached for aid at the present time

with the observation that this is a gigantic task and in

effect amounts to an attempt to manipulate the United States

Government itself.

The informant stated that in conclusion

both Diaz-Ordonez and De Pena agreed that the "question of

the hour" mould be resolved one way or another on February 20,

1961.

reliable information in the past, advised thai an individual

Honday, February 20, 1961. Arthur disagreed by stating that

it was

his understahding that representative end was

alaiting a communication fron the Administration.

Fe clarified

this by revealing that he had attended the "Sugar Club"

luncheon in New York City on February 16, 1961, at vhich

Representative set

introduced the speaker and made statements

concerning "which way the wind was blowing."

Based on these

statenents, Arthur felt that Representative Servas avaiting

"some sort of communication from the Department which puts in

writing what they said to him at the conierence."

Eckert stated that she häd seen Representative

alone "the other day" and Representative @ing had explained

the "whole thing to wér."

Eckert had explained to Repsesentative

Subathly that she did not feel that she should take the full

responsibility and had thereîore taken De Pena with hes to meet

with Representative Canalthe following day. according to

Eckert, De Pena also had reservations and because of this

and due to Representative ar

sin suggestion that he must

meet someone with whom he could "talk turkey," the "thrae

men" came from the Dominican Republic to meet with Representative

Arthur vas of thé opinion that the Dominican Republic

would get only its regular sugar quota.

Eckert desired to

know Arthur's opinion as to who the recipients of the non-

quota allotments would be. Arthur indicated that "Lariy"

desired the sugar but anyone who knows what has been going

"on and under the present circumstances would not get mized

up in the matter.

arthur indicated that due to this, he would

not become involved and he thought it was foolish that

Michael B. Deane who is registered with the Department of

Justice as an agent of the Dominican Republic, would sign a

contract with the Doninican Republic under the present

circumstances. Arthur indicated that he could not consci-

entiously do what Daane has done and it was Arthur's opinion

that the Dominicans were crazy to "throw money away like

that."

The informant stated that both Arthur and tokert

were unfavorably impiessed with Deane and Ickeri stated that

De Pena could not "stand ain." It was obvious to the informant

that ickert was not aware of the fact that Deane is registered

with the Department of Justice inasmuch as she commented that

Deane Should register because he "goes around as our representative

and counselor."

At this point, Arthur stated that "the cards have

been stacked against Trujillo." It was the opinion of Ickert

that it was Trujillo's "ova-fault." Arthur agreed and lamented

the fact that the dominican Republic wastes money by hiring

"these disreputable indivicuals." Arthur compared this with

the "waste of money" involving Alexander I. Guterna and the

Mutual Broadcasting System wherein Trujillo paid Cuterna

$750,000 to transnit favorable information regarding the

Dominican Republic over the llutual Broadcasting System network.

Arthur indicated that the situation as it presently stands

angers him.

D.6

With regard to Deane, Ickert expressed the opinion

mthat Malter Surrey (a Washington attorney fornerly registered

as an agent or the Dominican Republic) was the

indivicual

responsible for putting Deane "in the picture."

Eckert doubted

that Deane possessed the "pull in Congress" he is reputed to

have.

Arthur agreed and

siated that Representative

"doesn't even know hin."

Arthur was of the opinion that the

ansver to the

with ir. Rusk, Représentative Casadhad let it be known

that he did not want policy in this matter set by li. Mann.

Arthur stated that he was presently handling

affairs for the Querto Rican-American Refineries and indicated

arthur opined that if Trujillo had

any capital he wanted. to invest in the United States he

could not do better than invest it in Florida with regard

to sugar.

Eckert commented that she understood that the

Cubans were doing this.

On February 19, 1961, WF T-?, who has furnished

reliable information in the past, advised that Deane was

in contact with Ginebra. Informant advised that Deane

inquired whether Ginebra had been able to see "some of the

Ambassadors today and sone of the other people." Ginebra

commented that this had been impossible but stated that on

out in this regard, noting

he does not think it is a good idea for Ginobra

"running around talking to all these people."

On March 4, 1961, Deane was again in contact with

Surrey at which time

expressed concern

over the

manner

in which Ginebra is operating on his own without consulting

with Deane and Surrey.

Jeane exoressed his feeling thai

trouble with the American rovernment since he had paid

off many influential Americans both in the Government and

in private business who,

because of their influence, would

be able to waich out for Dominican interests.

In this regard, the

sourc?

stated that in

during a visit, to we womaican hers

Government,

The source said he did not see the check in

question,

but was told of its existence by a friend in the

Dominican Republic who held and may continue to hold a

position in the Dominican Budget Bureau,

This money

reportedly was paid to Senator

Smathers to secure from him

a laudatory speech on behalf of Generalissimo Irujillo

which was given by Senator

seat an assembly of the

Dominican CongIesse:

This

same source advised it'is assumed to be a

fact in the Dominican Republic that Mr. William Pawley of

rlorida, who has oil concessions in the Dominican RepuoLIC,

repzesents both the interests of Generalissimo Irujillo

and tro

Pawley's personal friend, Senators The

source,

therefore,

assumes tir. Pawley uses his influence in

American Government circles to acvance Irujillo's interests.

This data apparently refers to William D. Pawley, former

United States

Ambassador to Brazil, whose

come up in this situation.

In addition, the source commented it is rumored that

a brother of hirs, Dwight D. Eisenhower, wife of the former

President, owns considerable stock in the Dominican sugar

industry,

which is owned by Trujillo. The source, therefore,

suspected this individual, whose name was not known

to the

source, possibly had some part in socuring the extension of

the purchase of sugar from the Dominican Republic after

sanctions by the Organization of American States were placed

in effect against the Dominican Republic.

The above possibly refers to lirs, Biserhower's

brother-in-law, colonel Gordon moore, who was mentionea

that the Dominicans "still have hopes in the Senate,"

On March 24, 1961, it was learned that Walter

surrey, formerly registered

with the Department as an

agent of the Dominican Republic, discussed the sugar

situation with Michael B. Deane,

a registered agent of

the Dominican Republic.

Deane stated that the visits-made

by Ginebra to various Senators and Congressmen were to'no

avail and he (Deane) felt a program must be formulated:

by the Dominican Republic to change the attitude of the

United States toward that country.

In this regard, Deane

mentioned that Ody Lamborn, Lamborn and Company, sugar

brokers,

• New York City, is preparing a list of things

which can be done by the Dominican

In this same connection, we learned that Deane

attended a conference on the night of

liarch 23, l9ul, with some unnamed indiviauals at which the

Dominican

Republic was discussed.

Lamborn felt the only

solution is to have Generalissimo Rafael L Irujillo of

the Dominican Republic retire.

Deane felt the basic

problem is to change the policy of the United States and

the Dominicans should project their thinking toward

assuring themselves a place in the long-term sugar legis

lation which will be enacted at a later date. Deane

stated he had told Ginebra that a program must be devised

which Deane can sell to the Administration.

In addition to the above, our coverage of this

situation has developed the following data of possible

interest concerning the efforts of James Edward Powell,

a confidence man, to fleece the Dominicans of $15,000:

Commencing on March 22, 1961, Powell, using

the name of ike cartwright, has been in contact with

officials of the Dominican Consulate and the Dominican

Mission to the Organization of American States (DAS),

Washington, D. Cos on a number of occasions.

During

conversations with

these officials,.

he has stated

in

substance that he is the nephew and legal advisor of

Senator sales

matter mander, and that the

Senator desired him (Cartwright) to contact the Dominicans

in order to have an important message transmitted to

• Generalissimo Trujillo pertaining to the current sugar

legislation.

On March 23, 1961, Michael Deane, at the

request of Dominican Consul General Ginebra, contacted

the office of Senator annese and was told

that no one

by the name of Cartwright is on the Senator's staff and

the Senator was not known to have a nephew working in

Washington, Do Co

It was further learned that Powell, posing as

CartwIIght,

wint to the Dominican Consulatr at 10:30 ario,

March 24, 1901, after having first made an appointment.

He spoke with liario Rociriguez, Consul, and stated the

Venezuelans

were conducting a

campaign in Congress to

clininato the Dorinicans frou the sugar quota.

Venezuclan campaign in this regard.

When Powell was

told that Rodriguez would first have to check with

Ginebra, Powell indicated if he was not paid on March 24,

1961, the Dominicans could forget the whole thing.

A short time after his departure from the

Consulate, Powell again contacted the Consulate and

identified himseli as Senator da

He expressed

displeasure with the answer which Rodriguez had given

his "nephew."

With regard to the above, it was also learned

that Mario Roariguez,

mentioned above,. on march 24,

1961,

contacted an unidentified secretary al Senator surre

office and explained this situation.

When told by

Rodriguez that the above person was

using Senator s

name, the secretary stated she would certainly tell the

Senator about this matters

concerning lames Edward Powell, our files disclose

that he has

a long arrest record dating back to January 5,

1940, which includes arrests on a variety of charges

including orgery, Larceny after trust, and impersonation

As a matter of interest, Powell was arrested on July 16,

1958, in Washington, D. Co, after having represented himself

to be Robert lurphy,

former Deputy Under Secretary of State,

as part of a scheme whereby Perez Jimenez, former President

of Venezuela, was defrauded of $700.

On October 29, 1958,

he entered a plea of guilty to this

impersonation charge

and on December 5, 1958, he was sentenced to a term of

another mistake was in the article in that it indicated

According to Deane, the sun was correct; however, It was

to be paid over an eighteen-month period ending in

December, 1961.

In addition to the above, on April 6, 1961, we

A source who is in a position to furnish infor-

mation concerning certain Dominican activities in the

United States advised that Ginebra had received authorization.

to spend $50,000 to redecorate the residence of the

Dominican Consul General.

The source advised that no one

connected with the Dominican Consulate could understand the

reason for such expensive

renovations. However, the informant

speculated that Generalissimo Rafael L. Trujilio, as the

Dominican Representative to the United Nations,

might come

to the United states in that capacity and the above residence

This same source learned, during the past week, that

Ginebra had made an inguiry relative to obtaining a quantity

of United States currency in denominations of one thousand

and five hundred dollar bills. Ginebia indicated he wanted

more than an amount of $10,000 or $15,000. The source

speculated that the money being sought by Ginebra may be

personal funds which he possibly has brought to the United States

in the event he desires to seek asylum in this country in

the future.

The following data of possible interest has been

situation:

You have previously been advised of the reaction of

the Dominicans tu a letter received from the Department indicating

that the Dominican Sugar Office and its personnel are required

to register under the provisions of the Foreign Agents

Registration Act of 1938, as amended.

In that

Also, with respect to the above article, it was

that day Deane informed his wife that, since he (Deane) was

mentioned in the article, he felt he should "retire from the

public scene for a while."

His wife disagreed and stated

that he should not feel guilty.

It was also learned on April 6, 1961, that Deane while

discussing the article with Ody H, Lanborn of Lamborn and

Company, Incorporatad, New York City, remarked that the

article was "pretty factual." Deane felt there was so much

activity by the Dominicans on Capitol Hill that the newspapermen

could see what was going on and this resulted in the story.

Deane said he had warned Ginebra regarding his traveling to

Capitol Hill too frequently and in doing so pointed out that

in the Summer of 1960 "they" had been effective and no one had

known "they were operating."

-Deane further remarked that the story in *The

Reporter" pinpointed their activities and contained some

"unfortunate quotes."

Ginebra stated he wanted the registration papers completed

as soon as possible in order that they might be sent to the

In addition to the above, it was learned on

that Brazil,

Miranda then offered to contact

at which time he would furnish

Ginebra not attend. Ginebra

requested Miranda and Lamborn not to send information concerning

INTERNAL SECURITY - DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

We continue to receive information regarding contacts

on the part of Dominicons with officials of the United States

Government. In this regard, the following data of possible

interest has come to our attention:

You have previously been informed that Oscar Guaroa

Ginebra, Dominican Consul General, Washington,

D. Co, had

advised ambassador Virgilio Diaz Ordonez, Dominican Delegate

to the organization of American states (OAS), that he has

hopes of obtaining an additional sugar allotment for the

Dominican Republic.

It was indicated that possibly some of

the countries receiving sugar allotments would be unable to

fill their quotas and, in that event, he might be able to

obtain an increase in the Dominicon allotment. In this

regard, we learned that on July 3, 1961, Er.

Laurence lyers,

Director of the sugar Division of the Department of Agriculture,

was unable to keep his appointment with Ginebra on that daze.

later on the same day, however, hir. dyers was in contact with

Ginebra. At that time Ginebra reportedly mentioned. that he had

According to our source, Hir. Myers indicated that

there is c possibility that 10, 000, 000 tons of sugar could be

shipped to the United states if all of the allocations were

fulfilled. Ir. Myers added that in the event that should
