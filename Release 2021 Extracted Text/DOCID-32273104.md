Did see Shaw socially on chance occasions

in the downtown New Orelans area during which tme thre was little

conversation other than "how are you, "etc. Did not see Shaw at all

after 1965, presumably because Shaw had retired from Trade Mart

and may not have been frequenting downtown restaurants.

- Memo N0-98-76 6/3/76 Internal from J. Walton Moore

Indicates concern for response re: Shaw's connection with

CIA.

Can reconstruct contact by Leake, but "since we

cannot determine the nature of DCD's relationship with

Shaw from our files, we ouwld wppreciate your summarizing

it for us. "

Synopsis:

File contains reports made by Clay Shaw pursuant to contacts by

CIA between 1949-1956; memoranda which followed the course of the

Shaw trial and investigation because of alleged CIA involvement.

CIA tried to determine relationship between Shaw and Permindex or

World Trade Center. There appears to be none.
