DRAFT

Cuban-American

In Book V of the final report of the Senate Select

Committee to Study Governmental Operations on the performance

of the intelligence agencies in the investigation of the

assassination, the FBI and CIA are criticized for their

apparent failure to fully pursue leads surrounding the

assassination of President Kennedy and then to fully report

to the Warren Comnission the results of the investigations

they did undertake.

One such lead concerned the travel

from Texas

to Mexico City of ap unidentified Cuban-

American on November 23, 1963, and then his flight to Havana on

November 27. 1/ The lead was made more "interesting" by

the fact that the Cuban-American reportedly attended a

meeting of the Tampa chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba

Committee on November 17, 1963. 2/ The House Select

Committee on Assassinations examined the documents connected

to that lead to determine: (a) whether the facts which were

known by the FBI and CIA about that individual warranted

further investigation and what investigation was undertaken;

(b) whether any of that information was reported to the Warren

Commission; and (c) whether the known facts suggest any

involvement in the assassination of President Kennedy.

his passport number was 310162.

The message stated that Lopez

left Mexico for Havana on November 27 via Cubana (Airlines) .

Lopes was involved in the Kennedy assassination. 16/ The message

which had been carried out in Key West, Florida. The report

stated that Lopez's counsin, Guillermo Serpa Rodriguez, told the

FBI that Lopez came to the United Stated for the first time some

time after Castro first came to power. 27/ He stayed approximately

one year and then returned to Cuba. 28/ Rodriguez stated that

Lopez returned to Cuba because he was homesick and missed

his family; he had parents and four brothers who still resided

in Cuba.

•29/

Rodriguez stated also that Lopez's brother Selito was

a member of the Cuban militia at that time. 30/: Another

brother, Raimundo Policarpo Lopez, had reportedly been

sent to the Soviet Union to study by the Cuban government,

according to Rodriguez. 31/

Rodriguez told the FBI that Lopez returned to the United

States in 1960 or 1961 because he was afraid he would be drafted

into the Cuban militia if he remained in Cuba. 32/

The FBI learned that Lopez married an American woman in Key

West in August, 1962. 33/ According to Lopez's wife, he worked

for a time with the Pepsi Cola Co. in 1962 and at the Molina

and Murgia Bakery in Key West, which was owned by cousins. 34/

She said that he also worked for a construction company in

Tampa in June, 1963: 35/

Lopez's wife told the FBI that Lopez began suffering from

recurrent attacks of epilepsy and had to be confined at Jackson

State

Hospital in-Key-West in early 1963. 36/ She stated that

he was treated by doctors from Coral Gables and Key West for the

epilepsy. 37/ She stated that she did not believe he had a

history of epilepsy before coming to the United States.. 38/

She believed his convulsions were brought on by nervous

tension

and worry over his family in Cuba and may have been a reason

for his return to Cuba in 1963. 39/

The wife said that in approximately November, 1963,

she received a letter from Lopez saying he had returned to

= Cuba. 40/. The wife stated that she was surprised he had returned

but that he had mentioned he was going back to Cuba when he

left for Tampa in November, 1963. 41/ The wife gave her opinion

that he returned because of his close relationship with his

parents. 42/ The wife stated that she received another letter

from him later from Cuba. 43/ According to the letter, he was

working as an elevator operator in Havana.: 44/ In that letter

Lopez said he had received some kind of financial assistance

for the trip from an organization in Tampa. 45/ According to the

wife, Lopez did not have sufficient personal funds to pay the

expenses to Mexico and Cuba. 46/ She said that he had never had

contact with Cuban refugee organizations to her knowledge. 47/

Rodriguez told the FBI that Lopez left Key west

in late 1963 to go to Tampa

with the hope of being able

to return to cuba. 48/ Rodriguez said he believed Lopez wanted

to return to Cuba because he was afraid of being drafted into

the U.S. military. 49/ Rodriguez said Lopez was not involved

in any pro-Castro activity while living in Key West, but that

Lopez was "definitely" pro-Castro. 50/ Rodriguez recounted. that

in one instance he and Lopez actually had a fist-fight over

Lopez's pro-Castro sympathies. 51/

In a report in March 196d, the rBI reported that Lopez

had attended a meeting of the Tampa Fair Play for Cuba Committee

on November 20, 19t

52/ The report also stated that at a

meeting of the group on November 17, 1963, Lopez stated that he

had been refused travel back to. Cuba..

He said at that time

that he was waiting for a phone call from Cuva to get word on

his departure to Cuba. 53/

According to that report in March, 1964, a member of the

Tampa FPCC stated that she called a friend in Cuba on December ?

1963 and was told that Lopez had arrived safely. 54/ The member

had attempted to locate Lopez in Cuba through friends there because

Lopez had not delivered gifts to persons in Cuba from people

in Florida as he had promised to do. 55/ The member stated

also that the Tampa chapter of the FPCC had given Lopez

approximately $190 for the return trip to Cuba. 56/ The memoer

said that Lopez had gone to Cuba by way of Mexico because he did

not have a passport. 57/

The March 1964 FBI report listed Lopez's passport as

#310162, which had been issued in January, 1960, and his

Mexican tourist card as

"M8-24553, issued November 20, 1963.

in Tampa. 58/ It

stated that Lopez entered Mexico by private

auto at Nuevo Laredo on November 23, 1963 and departed for

Havana on November 27 as the only passenger on a Cubana flight,.

carrying a Cuban courtesy visa. 59/

According to the FBI file, Lopez's mother, Esperanza

Rodriguez, was born in Key West, Florida. 60/ The file

listed three cousins and four uncles who resided and worked in

the Key

West area with their families. 61/

Lopez's FBI file contains a memo from the Tampa office

dated October 26, 1964 which states:

It is felt that information developed

regarding the subject is not sufficient

to merit consideration for the Security

Index. 62/

The only information transmitted by the FBI to the Warren

"Commission on Lopez concerned a check at the Passport Office: 63/

The information the Bureau did send to the Commission a bout the

Tampa chapter of the FPCC did not include any information on

Lopez's activities. 64/ The CIA apparently did not provide

any information on Lopez to the Warren Commission. As pointed

out in the Senate report, this omission is made more egregious

NW 66000 Docld:32273519 Page 12

## Page 13

Cuban- American...page 11

by the fact that sources had reported within a few days of

Lopez's departure for Havana and of the assassination that the

circumstances

surrounding his travel seemed "suspicious" and

that in March, 1964, while the Warren Commission was well

underway into its work into the investigation of the

assassination, Lopez had reportedly been involved in the

Kennedy

assassination.

CIA TARFoiCe Report

In the 1977, report of the Inspeate General on the

ClAy the Agency attempted to refute several "inaccuracies"

in the Senate report regarding the reporting on Lopez's

travel. That is apparently the only follow-up by the

Agency on the lead after the Senate report appeared.

In the first place, The Inspector dener la repest

corrected the statement in the Senate report that sources

reported that Lopez appeared "suspicious" when he was

JFR

surveilled in Mexico. 65/ The It repext explained that the

eArh,

internal CIA document of December E

1963 which characterized

the man as suspicious was merely "cryptic and impressionistic

rather than constituting a tangible basis for dramatic

activity or final conclusions." 66/

The report stated additionally that the March

1964 cable from the Monterrey base which recounted the

information on Lopez (from the contact of the Mexican police

and claimed Lopez was involved in the assassination was

NW 66000 Docld:32273519 Page 13

---

## Page 14

Cuban-American... page 12

incorrect on several points: Lopez's name was misspelled

"Lopes"; it stated that Lopez entered Mexico on foot when

the CIA repeated the FBI's conclusion that he had traveled

by auto; it gave incorrect digits in Lopez's passport

number; it stated that the Mexican tourist visa was issued

in Nuevo Laredo and not Tampa; and it reported that he

stayed at the Cuban Embassy. 67/

Based on these inaccuracies,

the inspector Pueral concluded that "the source patentzy

was extensively misinformed." 68/ Based on that observation,

the trope to enemal completely discounted the cable

by the Deputy Chief of Station in Mexico

City-on March 20

1964)that the Mexican police source information "jibed"

with what had earlier been reported by the CIA's source. 69/

Presumably the discrepancies pointed out by the

Inspecter General are meant to explain the fact chat the:

CIA did not take more aggressive investigative steps to

ascertain whether there might have been some connection

between Lopez and the assassination. In that regard, the

1977 mI

mel report explains that the Agency

had no other means of investigating Lopez at his disposal

and had carried the lead as

far as it was able by

questioning a Cuban defector about Lopez.

While the fact

of the CIA's lack of access to further information about

NW 66000 Docld:32273519 Page 14

---

## Page 15

Cuban-American... page 13

Lopez may well be the case, that fact does not explain either

the failure of the CIA to take more seriously the suspicions

of the sources, or most importantly, to report whatever

information it had to

the Warren Commission. In that

TFR

regard, the attempts of the Inspector General to denigrate

the value of the information provided on Lopez do not

explitin.

tintine

diminich the apparent negligonce of the Agency in seriously

pursulag the information as it was received.

The Agency is

not to be faulted for the strength of its intelligence

gathering, but rather for the judgment which kept that

intelligence from the governmental body, the Warren

Commission, which was mandated to pass on the strength of

exactly that kind of information.

From the information collected by the FBI, there

Plausible

appear to be welt explained reasons both for Lopez's

desire to return to Cuba and his solicitation of the help of a

local FPCC chapter for that travel. His contacts in Florida

appear on their face to be innocent and nengulitions and not

in any way connected with the assassination. Despite the

suggestion by the senate report of suspicion in the fact

that Oswald "may" have been in touch with that same FPCC

the ASCA fund

chapter, no evidence appears to suggest that Oswald was

actually in touch with the Tampa FPCC, or that Lopez was

connected in any way with Oswald or Dallas.

NW 66000 Docld:32273519 Page 15

## Page 16

Cuban-American..• page 14•

Despite what is now known about Lopez, the warren

Commission may well have wanted to lay to rest

suspicions which would remain about Lopez, and satisfy

itself that these circumstances in no way indicate foreign

involvement in the assassination.

The CIA has contributed

to those suspicions by not airing the matter and explaining

circumstances which could shed light on otherwise sinister

appearing events.

The Committee has documented instances where the CIA.

decided to forego passing information to the Warren Commission

out of a desire to not lay bare extremely sensitive sources

and methods of intelligence.

The LIFIRE operation

certainly falls within that category and as soon as the CIA

began receiving information that LIFIRE was the source of

the irformation about Lopez's travel, the cables and

messages reflected the desire to not reveal that method.

It also

seems plausible that the FBI likewise chose not to

divulge what it had learned about Lopez because in doing

so, it would have had to reveal the sensitive CIA operation

which generated the initial information on Lopez's travel to Cuba

on November 27:
