with the agreement

that no

mention would be made about where it had been taken.

As far as can be determined, the Agency has never

admitted publicly that the

photo was

taken in Mexico,

great deal of speculation

to that effect by several authors and journalists.

the Agency has not revealed the actual location, only

saying it was taken somewhere outside the U.s.

All

mention of the photo has therefore been marked to be

withheld, because of sensitive sources and
