CURRENT RESULTS OF CAS PROGRAM TO SAMPLE PEASANT ATTITUDES

AND OPINIONS

The following is a summation of the results of the first

five months of a program designed to sanple peasant attitudes

and opinions in South Vietnan:

The Government of Vietnam (GVI) The peasants attitude

towards the GVN vartes considerably fron village to village,

depending on the amount of control exercised by the

govern-

ment and/or the Viet Cong. Sven in those areas under complete

ovi domination, however, there is feeling that the GV lacks

a loyal, honest cadre capable of helping and leading the

people at the local level. The OVN has failed to eliminate

corrupt elements in the middle and lower echelons of the

- 3

Goverment, despite the faet that there is still indication

respect for President Dien's motives and honesty.

Strategic Hamlots Certain resentment has artsen over the

construction of strategic hamlets particularly those to which

villagers are moved forcibly. There has been evidence of

official corruption in the execution of the Strategic Haalets

program and much resentment exists toward forced labor and

forced financial contribution to the program.

The basic peasant

desire is security

Next is to be left alone by both the GVN

and the VC. In cases where the GVN has been able to provide

security the peasant has tended

to be pro goverment.

Americans On the positave side, Americans are generally

well regarded by the Vietnamese armed forces for their contri-

butions in the form of military aid, road construction etc.

Some Vietnamese peasants; on the other hand, are inclined to

believe the Americans have come to replace the French. This

is perhaps a manatestation of the fact that the Vietnamese,

by nature, are often deeply prejudiced against foreigners.

Very little evidence of American aid has as yet reached some

peasants who are exposed to communist propaganda and control.

Armed Forces

Morale has much Improved in the Vietnamese

army over the past six months, as increased Anertean nilitary

aid has begun to convince the army that it can vin. Peasant

opposition to the Self-Defense Corps (SDC) runs high due to

the fact that the SDC is poorly paid and has a tendency to "live

off the land", stealing food and wonen fron the villagers.:

In addition, training and morale in the DC remain low. The

Civil Guard stands somewhere between the army and the SDC in

norale with a proportionate decrease in peasant resentment

of the Civil Guard. Those opinions are in direct proportion

to the equipment, pay scales and degree of discipline of the

three services.

Viet Cong

The strength of the Viet Cong can bost be

explained by the lackadaisical attitude of the peasants

toward both the VC and the GVN. In areas where both sides

exercise control over a village (the VC at night and the GVN

during the day) there 1s a tendency to fear the VC, pay their

taxes, and do their chores, but to havo more respect for the

GVi program which is nore often constructive rather than de-

structive.

Montagnards

The tendency has been for the Montagnard

tribesmen to swing toward opposition to the VC and attempt to

accept arms to detend themselves against them. Omithe other

hand the Mentagnards do not care for the Vietnese ethnic

group as a whole, be they connunist or otherwise.
