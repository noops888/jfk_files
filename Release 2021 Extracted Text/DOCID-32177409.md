Date: August 2, 2021

From: National Archives and Records Administration

Subject: Reconstructed FBI File Sl 62-2567, Serials 25-30

To: The File

This memorandum briefly summarizes the status of missing original Federal Bureau of

Investigation (FBI) case files or portions of case files in the President John F. Kennedy

Assassination Records Collection (JFK Collection) and documents the National Archives and

Records Administration's (NARA) efforts to reconstruct these records, where possible, from

duplicate copies of documents located in other FBI files.

As the JFK Collection was first compiled and reviewed in the 1990s, the Assassination Records

Review Board and the FBI designated some records as "not believed relevant" (NBR) or "not

assassination related" (NAR). The FBI retained custody of the NBR/NAR records and

postponed their transfer to NARA until a later date. Every document or group of documents

("seriais"), however, received an indexed Record Identification Form (RIF) and FBI inventory

sheet for insertion into the JFK Collection.

In September 2011, several years prior to the 2017 re-review and transfer of the NBR/NAR

material to the National Archives, a flood severely damaged thousands of feet of records at the

FBl's Alexandria Records Center in Alexandria, Virginia. In June 2012, NARA approved the

FBI's request for emergency destruction of 10,000 cubic feet of records that posed significant

airborne health hazards. Among the damaged records were FBI field office files that contained

postponed JFK Collection material designated as "pertaining to a matter unrelated to the JFK

Assassination Investigation" or "not assassination related."

This compilation represents NARA's efforts to reconstruct the original file or portions of the file,

as completely as possible, with duplicate copies of documents located in the FBI field office and

headquarters files within the JFK Collection. Each reconstructed file or compilation contains a

Record Identification Form, an explanatory cover memo, existing administrative documents

available within the JFK Collection, and copies of identified duplicate documents. The table

below summarizes the status of FBI file Sl 62-2567, Serials 25 through 30.

ST 18, 1978

TESTIGATIVE. DIVISION

The Bank of Alton, Alton, Illinois, was robbed

by two

white males wearing stocking masks on 7/13/67. The unknown

subjects were armed with a sawed off shotgun and an

automatic pistol.

They escaped with $27,230.00.. No one was

James Earl Ray, were developed. No one was ever identified

as the robber and the case remains unsolved.

James Eugene

Gawron, known to have been an associate of Ray, advised that

he and Ray cased the Bank of Alton, in 1959, but did not rob

it as planned. Extensive investigation by the Springfield

Division, including showing of Ray's photographs, failed io

identify Ray as one of the robbers. The bulk of the Alton

investigation pertaining to Ray's involvement_ was reported

in the Murkin file and not the 91 file.
