118 March' 1968

SUBJECT: COBB, LlOyd J.

Lloyd J. COBB; born 19. July 1904, New Orleans, Louisiana, senior

member of the law firm, COBB and WRIGHT; New Orleans, Louisiana, was

gr√§nted: a Provisional Security Approval on 19 June 1967 to permit

contact and assessment of. COBB in connection with his use on

a Cleared

Attorneys! Panel for the Office of General Counsel.

COBB had been granted a Covert Security Clearance on 3 October 1953

for use on a private attorneys'panel for the OGC: A security investigation

in 1953 was generally favorable. Noteworthy information regarding-

Subject at the time was a report that in 1949 while he was serving as

President of the International House in New Orleans, he and one Rudolph

HECHT were alone in favoring a Czech exhibit at the International Trade

Mart. HECT, President of the Hibernian Bank of New Orleans at the time

was reportedly the power behind the International House and Trade Mart.

and COBB was said to be his protege. Both COBB and HECHT took the stand

that trade with a Russian satellite was desirable as long as it was not

prohibited by law and was profitable, regardless of other considerations.

Rudolph HECHT was approved for limited contact use in 1950 and

1951. An informant in 1947 characterized HECHT as a very "sharp trader"

in New Orleans who had been under suspicion during World War I.

HECHT', born

1885 in Ansbach, Germany, emigrated to the U.S. in 1903, was naturalized

"in February 1912 and died on 19 January 1956.

COBB's law firm's main client in 1953 was the HELIS' corporation.

William George HELIS, Jr. was President of the HELIS Petroleum

Corporation, New Orleans, Louisiana.

Lous ran

He was considered for an Operational

Clearance in 1953 but the case was cancelled 28 January 1954. HELIS

was granted a Covert Security Approval on 31 August 1955 for the purpose

of providing financial cover for an Agency project and this clearance

was amended on

I 4 November 1955 to include his use on another Agency project.

HELIS, Sr. amassed a fortune in the oil industry and allegedly had.

ousiness dealings with the notorious Frank, COSTELLO, racketeer; Huey

LONG, controversial governor of Louisiana; and John MARAGON who was

involved in the "five percenter"

scandals during the TRUMAN administration.

HELIS was considered

for a CSA in 1967 but the request was withdrawn

31 August 1967. Investigation had developed information that he had a loose

attitude towards morals and his sister, Virginia, was reported to be grossly

Immoral.

SECRET O

Of interest in connection with the Clay L. SHAW case is a rumor

that was current in New Orleans and reported on during the time of

HELIs' 1967 security Investigation. The reliability of the informant was

unknown.

"The essence of the rumor was to the effect that Clay SHAW

has been closely linked as an associate of one of the wealthy and,

socially prominent 'HElIS' girls as well as one of the MONTHlEONE

girls of the family who founded the hotel of the same name. Persons

mentioned, namely SHAW, nee HELIS and nee MONTELEONE were referred

to in terms indicating gross immorality with overtones suggesting

sexual deviation.

The rumor appeared to be to the effect that they

were among the prominent members of a cult whose immorality was

generally known but

to some extent at least, tacitly accepted by

New Orleans society."
