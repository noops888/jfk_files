are 2 or 3 things he wanted to take a minute or two to

talk about.

TOM then says he opened a telegram today

that came to MARTIN

to "our office" from JACK LYNN (ph), who 1s the Vice-Presi-

dent of programing at Metropolitan Broadcasting.

TOM says

1t has to be about LYNN having approached MARTIN about a

tape after the march next Wednesday. MARTIN confirms that

he has a recollection of the matter and tells TOM that LYNN

had talked with MARTIN's secretary in Atlanta. MARTIN asks

1f the telegram 1s about giving "the details of the time and

TOM confirms that it is and MARTIN then says that

$1,000. He indicates

that the other organizations involved would be SNICK (ph),

MARTIN says that it seems to

him that "the Equality button", which 1s already being dis-

tributed pretty widely, is the one that's getting the great-

ost attention now.

They mention that it is selling for $1.00

and MARTIN says it has

real symbolic value.

MARTIN mentions

that "we" have "this United Rights Leadership Council", which

was trying to raise a million and a half dollars to be dis--

tributed between

the organizations and he says it's really

this council that's taking over the buttons..

They agree that

in view of this "we" shouldn't bother with any other buttons.

MARTIN says he thinks they ought to concentrate on the

Equallty button and tells TOM that the arrangement "we" made

then

the organization that's pushing it like NAACP will keep 25¢

and that "the branch" gets 25% so that TOM says this means

that "we" profit 2 ways.

MARTIN confirms that he means that

scLo would get 25e plus their share their share of the 50%

to forget all the other buttons and really concentrate on the

MARTIN speaks of 5,000,000 people wearing

the button and TOM comments that "this thing could underwrite

our budget amost (ph)". MARTIN agrees."

MARTIN then tells

TOM that a lot of the church groups are taking the button

and they speak about it with TOM Indicating that he is hon-

orary State Chairman In the American Baptist organization.

TOM indicates he will take up with them their buying the

buttons.

TOM then tells MARTIN about meeting he and other preachers

attended in washington last Monday and reports to MARTIN that

Washington is going to produce between 35,000 and 40,000

people (for the march).

Te also says that "we" als

"some good powerful men"" like GEORGE E. C. HAYES (ph)" and

good community men with a good financial setup "there" that

HAYES, himself, is heading up and he tells MARTIN that "they"

are

going to help "us" to raise some money to pay the cost

of "this thing".
