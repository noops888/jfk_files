DURING EVENING DECEMBER 2 NICARAGUAN OFFICIAL WEELOCKWAS

PERMITTED BY MEXICAN

AUTHORITIES TO SEE AND TALK WITH'

ALVARADO

FOR THE FIRST TIMES C ON TOOK PLACE IN PRESENCE OF TWO

MEXICAN POICE OFFICERS.

WEELOCK SAYS THAT ALVARADO WENT BACKS

TO HIS ORIGINAL STORY OF HAVING WITNESSED PAY-OFF TO OSWALD

ALVARADO CLAIMS HIS STATEMENT TO

MEXICAN AUTHORITIES WAS

IN CUBAN CONSULATE HERE MADE UNDER DURESS AT TER FORTY-EIGHT FIGURSE

ALTHOUGH MEXICANS CLAIM THAT ALVARADO WAS TREATED 'GENTLY," SINCE

NOUS @FICIAL WAS PRESENT WE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING WHETHER THERE

IS BASIS FOR ALVARADO'S CLAIM

OF DURESS.

LAS REPORTED EARLIER ALVARADO'S STORY IMPRESSED US HERE BECAUSE OF

WEALTH OF DETAIL. I DID NOT IN

THE BEGINNING KNOW THAT ALVARADO

HAD DEFINITELY FIXED DATE OF PASSAGE OF MONEY. TO OSWALD AS

SEPTEMBER 18 AND WAS ASSUMING THAT ALVARADO'S STORY WAS C ONSI STENT

WITH OUR DATA ON OSWALD'S ENTRY IN AND EXIT FROM MEXICO. AFTER

VE LEARNED ALVARADO. HAD PINPOINTED SEPTEMBER

18 WE AT FIRST ONLY

KNEW THAT THE FBI HAD DEFINITELY PLACED OSWALD IN NEW ORLEANS

-2- 1226, DECEMBER 3, NOON FROM MEXICO CITY.

LIBRARY ON 'SEPTEMBER 19. SINCE ALVARADO ALLEGEDLY STUCK TO THE

SEPTEMBER

18 DATE DURING MEXICAN INTERROGATI ON UP TO THE TIME HE

CHANGED HIS STORY AND SINCE WE CANNOT PLACE OSWALD ON EASTERN

AIRLINES FLIGHT FROM AND TO NEW ORLEANS BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 17 AND

19 THERE IS ONE APPARENT FLAW IN ALVARADO'S STORY.

A SECOND APPARENT FLAW, ALREADY MENTIONED, IS ALVARADO'S INSISTENCE

THAT HE TELEPHONED AMERICAN EMBASSY FOUR TIMES ON SEPTEMBER 2D.

AND DAYS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING.

CURARILY CLAIMS HE MADE FOUR TELEPHONE CALLS: TO EMBASSY EXTENSION

EE BUT SEE NAME ORATORGE MYSUS PHONETIC), AND WAS EACH TIEM

OF THE EMBASSY SECURITY

OFICER TO WHICH ALVARADO VAS REFERRED WHEN HE TELEPHONED THE

EMBASSY

ON NOVEMBER 25.

HE COULD HAVE GOTTEN THE TEXTENSIO

NUMBER FROM THE NOVEMBER 25 CALL. WE ARE CONTINUING TO INVESTIGATE

THIS FACET BUT EARLIER, MORE GENERAL INQUIRY PRODUCED NEGATIVE

RESULTS.

NEVERTHELESS THERE IS POSSI BILITY OF TRUTH TN THE PART

OF ALVARADO'S STORY ABOUT HAVING SEEN MONEY PASSED TO OSWALD TOE

WARRANT CONTINUED INVESTIGATION OF ALVARADO EITHER IN THE US

IN: NICA RAGUAG

WHEEL OCK SAYS THAT NECARAGUAN GOVERNMENT ISAD

ACTREABLE TO ALVARADOIS INTERROCATION IN NICARAGUA BY US OFFICIALSTE

I THEREFORE SUGGEST THAT FBI AND CIA CONSIDER SENDING REPRESENTATIVES

TO MANAGUA FOR INTERROGATION PRUPOSES. PERHAPS A POLYGRAPH

EXPERT SHOULD ALSO BE SENT.
