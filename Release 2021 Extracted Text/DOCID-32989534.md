ALL INFORVATION CONTAINED

Dear John:

DATE 1-4-0

MDR-16

It is two wocks today that I was Interviewed by Mr. Elliff of the Senate

Committee, in the Senate Office Bullding, pursuant to arrangaments which you

made at his request. Knowing that you and the Bureau might be interested in

recelving a synopsis of that interviaw,

I admit that I

an delinquant in my

reporting. Man

The interview began at 10:00 a,m. and lasted for two and ona-half hours. It

was pleasant enough in all respects, conducted in good humor througnout. m

Elll&e's stated purpose in interviewing me was to leam the origins and fune-

tions

of the Bureau's Office of Legal Counsal. So, during much of the inserview

I talked and he vote furiously. Synopsizad, of coursa, I went throught the his

tory as follows.

In the beginning dating averything (as in Christianity) from the time that

a cartain noted

figure took over-there was no in-house counsel.:thera sam to

be two reasons. Flrst, the vast majority of the Agents were law trained. I think

the figure for 1940, when I entered, as 90 per cent. Thus the Agants were equippo

ed by training to provide their own legal guicelines. Second, the criminal lax

was at that time very simple. Far of the FBI arrosts, searches, and interroge

tions were challenged in the courts.

During this perlod the unoîficial in-housa counsel was Judge lioltzoft, than

a proninent lawyer in the Department of Justici, When Hoover had a legal ques-

tion of significance he consulted Holtzoff; the old files so show.

somewhore in the madle 1940's (I quass at thla fron Inadacuato daca) tha

¡il decided for sona roason not inown to ma to set u the legal

research Dis'

in the then Tralaing and Inspection Divlalon. I suppose that as the jurisdic

tion and the stafe of the iBI grow swiftly so also did the number of legal

giations calori, to the polnt where the intormal Hoover Holtsoft syston proied

inadequate. it was a ona man desk, occupied by, dia anong others,

Inspecior 14.33

James Carlson, Chestor jontz (now daceased), Frans Scrong, Maco Scovell, and

others unknown to me. I toux over in 1955.

Beginning thortly after my arrival, the volume of logal questions began to

siell, This development followed on the new activist" approach of the Supreme

Court under liarren which brought the landmark decisions of Mallory, Napp, Nli-

anda, and so many others, all of which complicated the crininal law enormously

for both FBI Agents and for the officers of other jurisdictions to whon the FBI

taught criminal law in the FBI National Academy and elsewhere. More than that,

these dacisions came at a time when the percentage of lawyers in the agent force

had greatly daclined. It thus was obvious that both the supervision me lezal

catters and the tralning zivan to Agents and othar officars must de graily inn

creased. This brought you and Join ilotis and others into tha function, for

Donelan

and I could no longer carry the load.

The final step was the establishnent of the Office of Legal Counsel as a sab

arate division oi tbe FBi. This happened without advance notice to ne. It was

in January or Fsbruary of 1971 (memory fades) when Hoover called me to. his off-

ice. He opened by naming about fiva Faderal law enforcement agencias such as the

Secret Service, the jarcotics Bureau, and others, that had their own consal

and concludad by

saying that the FBI had greater need of in house counsel than

any of these. He made me Inspector in Charga, and 17 days later made me Assis-

tant Director.

• Ellif was interested in knowing why hoover chose that moment to create the

new division. I told him, and quite truthfully, that i did not know-loover dia

not say, at least not to ma. Elliff pressed the matter, lo and I pointed out

thai I could only spaculate. The best spaculation in my opinion, is that the

nove was related to the

extreme embarassment which came to hoover because of

his public stacement, prior to any grand jury action, concerning the evidence

against those two priests and

their followers who were alleged to be planning

to blow up the District sewer system. That statement, I pointed out, was never

brought to my attention until after it had been

made. Had I known of it in ado

Vance, I would have strongly counseled

against it. Somewhere in this time area,

I speculated, Hoover must have decided that he badly needed a closer legal mon

itoring of everything that went on in the F3j.

This brought up the anamôlous position so lung occupied by the Legal Research

Desk which had so troubled me. I was absolutely and totaily responsible for an

sering any legal quastion raised to my by anyone in tha FBI, but I had no au-

thority whatsoever to inquira into legal problems not raised to me: Inis liaris

situation changed complately when the new division was established. Cur first

orders from livover ware to "see everything" going out of the FBI that might.

embody or affact a legal quastion. He strove manfully to do so for a while, but

the volume of pover coming across the desk was simply too large. So, with doover*:

permission and

over his signature, I put out a motice to all headquarters pers-

onnel which made each

supervisor, division, cic., Initially responsible los

recognizing the actual or possible existenca of a logal problem and which dir-

ected them to bring all such problems to our attention. and so it went untii i

retlied.

Elliff was Interested in knoring why I was so zulcily raised from Inspactor-

in-Charge to Assistant Director. Again, Hoover never told me, but if one must

speculate I would suggest

that it was because I handled to his satisfaction two

sorious legal matters which came up in the first few days. One was a proposal

NW 65994 Docld:32989534 Page 5

from the General Intelligence Division that a file do estabilshad

on each Son-

ator and U.S. Representative and that:into that file be thrown all miscellaneous

Information concerning the person that came to our attention without investiga

tion. The purpose was entirely innocent,.

and of some efficiency, viewed solely

from

an investigative standpoint. The fBI had lately become responsible for in-

vestigating attacks against thase people, and it is sansible to bellove that the

more the Agent knows abouc the victim the better tha chance he has of solving the

crime. dut, I countered, the fact that the f3l kept such files would filter out

to public knowladge and inmediatoly be misinterpreted to mean that the FBi as

actively surveilling and monitoring the activities of the legislators. This would

not do, Hoover agraed. About the same time there came fron the Domestic Intelli

genice Division a proposal that an informant be seni co Canada to gather infor

ation there on certain tos. citizens in whom the fui had a logitimate interest.

Canada was not to be infonned. I countered that this was unwise; something of

the same kind had happened a few years earlier, had been discovered, and had ic

sulted in quite a stink being raised in the Canadian Parliament. I

suggested that

the FBI work tus this informant through the RO, Hoover agreed,

and it was so

done to the benefit of both this country and Canada and without'an unfortunate

incident.

Both these matters, it might ba pointed out, were not strictly legal. But the

effective lawyer remembers

that just as no man is an island neither is

a legal

quastion. The question exists always in some politica:, economie, sociological,:

philosophicai context, and

these may aiter or even change what would other.

wise be the narrow legal answer to a problem

He next discussed, at Bllifê's request, the functions of ths Office of Lagai

Counsel. Hore pointedly, why could not thase functions be performed by the U.s.

Attorney and the Department of Justice? For many reasons, I said. Flrst, and in

general, it defies all comnon sense and

the laws of human nature to believe that

the Director of the FBI and his people can get adequate counsal from any lawyer

over rhom they have no control whatsoever, whom they do not pay, promote or der

mote. The FBI must necessarily be in a position to demand a quick answer from

counsel. The SAC in Butte, for example, may call at 10:00 agn, or 10:00 Dolle,

as the situation raquires. He has located a luzitive, and sees a potential searci

problem. We mignt get a good ansger from the Department if wa write them a nemo

and walt three weeks land again we might not, depending on who answers the ques.

tion over there). But the SAC cannot freeze the situation for thece weaks. Second,

the SAC needs a positive answer-a "do this" and "don't do that" answer, specific,

to the point, and

susceptible of being transiated into imediate action. done of

this "on the one hand but however on the other" type of answer that bureaucrats

so often give. the fBi can comnand such an anster of lts own counsel, and oi no

other. Nor can the U.S. Attorney he ralied upon for such answers, for several

rcasons. lany of the assistants are recently graduated schoolboys whose know-.

ledge of the criminal law is "hornbook" variety. Some U.S. Attorneys are overly

cautious, reluctant. to take a stand, with the result that the fBI would underuse

it's authority, to the public detriment. Some are aggressiva prosecutors out to

malle a name for themsalves and not a bit rciuctant to authorize an arrest or

search on dubious grounds, secure in the knowledge that if the action fails the

newspaper inadlines will trampet the fact that it was the "ril search or arrogt

that

was Illegal, making no mention of the "authority" on which the action was

takon. Thus it is that the FBI desire to keep its legal actions cican as a

round's tooth may conflict with the ambition of the prosecutor. I still remember

an Assistant. U.S. Attorney who spent half an hour on the tolephone trying to

harangue, badger and bluff me into sending agents out to arrost a Secret Serv

Ice fugltive when both he and I knew that we had no jurisdiction to male such

an arrest. ind then some ü.s. Attorneys simply went hayalre in thair interprat-

ation of the law. If I comeber correctly, it was the U.S. Attorneys in the cast

en District of Illinois and one the the districts of Mississippl tho onca took

the position that a person arrested by the FBI must be brought bafoze the then

Commissioner by the arrestedg agent and by no other. & had to fight them both

dorin on that one and it took a vit of doing. So, näre again the fBi needed its

cAn counsel.

Functions of FBI in house counsei break down into a faw obvious catagorles,

I told Ellifi. Counsel must to some reasobable extent rove through currant FBI

50tk iooking for problens, Present and potential. Some can be solvad on the 3p0z,

so to spear. Others must be taken to the Dapartment, such as those which necess-

arlly Involve Depariment or administration policy, or which are of such poüntiai

able to it. It is a matter or considerable discretion to decide which questions

can and should ba answered

in-house, in order to not be badgaring the Departuet

• every other minute, and which must de raised to che Department. This can be ¿one

by an experienced

FBI Agent-Lawyer, and by no other. And then there is the

con-

stant need for FSI legal Instruction, which I dascrlbed but on which I diá not

dwell, believing the reed to de obvious and; in genaral, for the same reasons

as those discussed above.

In response to EllifE's questions I admitted that the great bulk of the work

of the Office of Legal Counsel cane from the criminal side of FBI jurisdiction

And quite naturally so. It was (I speak of my time only)in the criminal area

that most of the Agents were employed. And it was with some historical justi

fication that those doing intelligence work trought themsalves not responsible

to the criminal law, although we did all possifle to inoci that ercor out of

their heads. They thought thenselves only inteligence gatherers, and so they

It was then that we got such flascoes as that "high Sierras" case, which Hoover

angrily labeled the worst search he had ever seal. the agenis took everything-

we lost the search in the Suprene Court. They never asked

for advice of counsel. without the effective presence of in-house counsel how•

This discussion 1ed to tali of the slondar legal jurisdiction for the work

of the Domestic Intelligenco Division. I told Elliff that some in the Fil had

long been dissatisfled with the matter, that I wis among them, and that when id

Miller became Assistant Diroctor ha had labored mightily for a chango. Here I

warned Elilff that it. would be casy to so circunscribe FBI jurisdiction in this

our citizans expect the FBI

to perforn, and well. The law must always leave, as Justice holmes once said,

• "some play in the joints," some room for judgent and, decision of those who

are responsible for the work.

In answer to Ellife's questions, I disclaimed all responsibility of she Offica

of Legal Counsel and the Legal Rosearch Desk for all "dirty triois," burglarles"

and so on. The great bull of these occurred during my "ananalous simation"

described earliar; I was naver consulted or advised in advance. for jas

of Logal Counsel. I said baat I had early nade it clear that I stood for legal.

ity in all maiters, being of the opinion that legallty, like honasty, is the best

policy in the long run no matter in of onerous it may seem in some indivijual

case. My lodestar Was Eound very early in a note that Hoover lad penned to a memo

foom the General Investigative decision complaining of the difficulties thrown

in our

path by the Mallozy decision. Hoover wrot, "It is the law and he vill

obey it." That became the

philosophy of the Legal hasearch Desk and of the Offies

of Legal Counsel.

A few very low-names came up, EllifE seemed to think that loover might have -

• counseled with me on the "lociout" of i.C. Sullivan, lie did not, and I made that

clear. I refused to enter into any discussion of the hoover-Sullivan relations,

pointing out that I had hearsay only, except to confirm that it appeared to be

the foreign llaison matter which generated the fraças.

Felt's name came up but it was inconsequential-i now forget how. I did point

out that oring to directions is which Hoover gave to me, and in his usually

"powar" in the bureau had some difficulty, for a while, in grasping thai fact.

But so Hoover told sen me and since I was eligible to retire anyway I actal acc

ordingly.

Director Kelley was not mentioned at all, nor was Pat Gray so fas as I cin

FROM : Togo D. West, JI.

Associate Deputy Attorney General

SUBJECT: Legal Expenses of FBI Agent Kehoe

DATE: October 20, 1975

Consistent with the new policy we are adopting on

representation of government employees, the Deputy has

decided that the Department should reimburse Special

Agent Kehoe fox legal expenses incurred by him in

connection with his recent appearance before the Church

Committee.

It is our understanding that Mr. Kehoe will

continue to need legal advice in connection with the

Church Committee investigation.

Since we would benefit

from his knowledge of the case, and in the interest of

continuity, the lawyer already retained by Mr. Kehoe

should, if possible, now be hired by the Department.

This is to inform you that on 11/7/75 Defense

Department will release to the Senate Select Committee (SSC),

the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Practices

and Procedures (Senator Edward M.

Kennedy's committee), and

to the press, information concerning Navy projects from

1947 to

1954

involving drug experimentation; a Navy file

indicates FBI was aware of programs but Laboratory has no

knowledge of any active participation by Bureau personnel.

On 11/4/75, Clark McGruder, Assistant to Admiral

Bobby R. Inman, Director of Naval Intelligence, informed me

that on 11/7/75 the Navy was going to release to aforementioned

committees and the press information on drug experimentation

and that the FBI was mentioned in the pertinent files.

Those files were reviewed at the Pentagon on 11/6/75 by

Supervisor J. P. Thomas of INTD. They had been classified

"Secret" and "Top Secret" but now have been completely

declassified. FBI was mentioned in connection with three -

projects. There are no FBI documents in the files.

A memorandum dated 9/21/50 from Mr. Alberti to

Mr. C. D. Deloach was a receipt signed by Mr. Deloach for

one copy of "Drugs Stated To Have Been Used By Russians And

Germans In Interrogation Techniques." Alberti is identified

elsewhere in the file as Jack H. Alberti, Office of Naval

Intelligence (ONI), who apparently coordinated the projects

mentioned in the file.

The purpose of one project was to

develop a speech-inducing drug to obtain intelligence fron

interrogees and the project began in 1947.

Re: Senstudy 75

62-116395

A memorandum dated 8/15/75 on letterhead of

Office of Chief of Naval Operations concerned "Top Secret

Naval Medical Research Institute (NMRI) Project on Speech-

Inducing Drugs," reported a meeting on 8/11/50 attended by

personnel of NMRI, CIA, Office of Naval Research (ONR), a

drug company representative and Mr. Deloach and MI. D. J.

Parsons of the FBI Laboratory. The purpose of the meeting

was to brief the FBI on a CIA project on narco-hypnosis and

on the NRI project. Parsons reportedly said the FBI had

no such project, but had information on the experiences of

Various police

departments in the United States with speech-

inducing drugs. He agreed to make the FBI information

available to NMRI and CIA. ONR agreed to give FBI, NMRI

and CIA a study by ONR on projected research to improve

polygraph reliability. Recipients were to give their comments

and recommendations on the study to ONR. At the meeting

NMRI gave DeLoach an 8/11/50 NMRI progress report on its

project.

Parsons agreed to look into the possibility of

getting volunteers from prisoners in Federal institutions

and to supply NMRI with canabis (marijuana) and heroin to

the extent they might be available to the FBI. It is noted

that no IBI representatives were listed in the memorandum

reporting a 9/27/50 meeting of this group and there is no

further record in the file of FBI participation. Neither is

there any record that the FBI supplied any drugs for the

project.

• Material regarding project "CHATTER" included a

carbon copy of a rough draft memorandum (no letterhead)

bearing the penciled date "11/50?" which contained the

following, "Since 1947 the Department of the Navy has

carried on a project in coordination with the Departments

this project did go forward and involve human experimentation.

MATI, OPENINGS

Q. What are the standards governing issuance of a warrant to

open mail?

RESPONSE: The standards governing issuance of a warrant to open

mail are set forth in Rule 41 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure

for the United States District Courts and cases such as Giordenello

315 0544 105 1903 373 4.5 15, 403

(1964),

U.S. 573 (1971), which interpret the warrant clause of the Fourth

Amendment.

Briefly stated, a Federal law enforcement officer or an

attorney for the government must submit a sworn affidavit to a

neutral and detached magistrate.

The affidavit must set forth

sufficient facts to support a

finding by the magistrate of prob-

able cause to believe a crime has been committed and the letter,

described with particularity, is or contains evidence of a crime.

In U.S. V. Van Leeuwen, 397 U.S. 249 (1970) : Law en-

forcenent officers reasonably suspected

a piece of mail contained

evidence of a crime.

They seized the package and held it overnight

while the investigation continued.

Additional facts were obtained

and a search warrant was issued authorizing the opening of the mail.

The Suprene Court held the police conduct was reasonable under the

Fourth Amenament.

What are the procedures within the I'2I for seeking authorization

to employ electronic surveillance without a warrant?

Response:

An investigative Agent, who feels that justification exists for

use of an electronic surveillance, will address a communication to the

Federal Eureau of Investigation (FCI) Headquarters setting forth the

nature of the case and the necessary facts to support his belief that this

technique is deeiced necessary. This comunication containing the

Agent's recommendation is reviewed by the Agent's iramediate

Supervisor.

Should the Supervisor agree with the Agent, he will submit

the communication bearing his approval to the Special Agent in Charge

of the field otfice who will carciully scrutinize the facts set forth and

it he agrecs he will indicate his approval and send the communication to

I'Ll Headquarters. Upon receipt at I'CI Headquarters, a Headguarters

Supervisor drafts a memoranduma to the Attorney Ceneral (AG) setting

forth all pertinent facts by which the request is believed justified

according to the language of 18 US Code 2511 (g).

The request is then presented for review and justification through

channels, 1.c., Headquarters Unit Chiet, Section Chiel, Eranch Chict,

Assistant Director of the Intelligence Vivision, Deputy Associate Director,

Associate Director, and with the final personal approval of the Director,

TEl, the request is forwarded to the Attorney Ceneral, noting that if the

request is not felt to be completely justified at any level, it is disapproved

or returned for further clarification or justification.

For your further edification, I have prepared a memorantun

to you dated Octover 31, 1075, and captioned "National Security Electronic

Surveillances (NSES)," wherein I furnish detailed information regarding

our procedures, steps, and criteria for requesting and approving Nees.

Does the FBI disseminate information it has obtained

by the use of a search including electronic

surveillance to other Federal agencies?

If so, what agencies and under what standards are

decisions made as to what information should be

disseminated?

RESPONSE. YeS.

Information which has been obtained by

use of a

search, both those based on a warrant and those

not based on warrant including electronic surveillance

is disseminated to other Federal agencies.

The Manual of Rules and Regulations (MRR) and the

Manual of Instructions (MOI,) are the source of FBI policy

instructions relative to the dissemination of information

which comes into the possession ot the ii..

The MRR Part II,

Section 5, states that "Dissemination is ordinarily restricted

to Federal agencies in the Executive Branch."

In fact dis

semination to such agencies comprises the vast majority of

information disseminated.

Dependent however on the exigencies

of the situation information in certain instances may be dis-

seminated beyond Executive Branch agencies.

Thus the MRR

requires that where there is a threat to life, interested law

enforcement agencies with jurisdiction concerning the threat

must be advised as well as the intended victim.

So also the

MOI Part, Section 23, contains instructions which require

that the

FBI immediately notify local law enforcement con-

cerning bomb threats.

With regard to the standards employed in determining

which information merits dissemination the MRR Part II,

Section 5, establishes a backdrop against which and within

which dissemination is made.

This section notes that "the

proper utilization of information received by the Bureau,

whether through investigation or otherwise is foremost among

our responsibilities.

Such information may be of vital in

terest to another Government agency and/or local law enforce-

mento,** In ail matters relating to dissemination, good

judgement and common sense should prevail.

It is not the

Bureau policy to withhold from dissemination vital and impor

Dear Mr. Shaheen:

In connection with the King matter and our

forthcoming hearings next week, we need to have a

complete understanding

of all actions, decisions,

proposals, recommendations and operations of FBI

personnel

with respect to Dr. King during the months

of November and December 1964. Accordingly, I would

appreciate your asking the Bureau to designate a

representative who can go through the FBI files for

those months relating to King with Mr. Epstein of our

staff sometime this week.

In the event that the

November-December 1964 portions of the files contain

materials pertinent to our inquiry, but which we have

not yet requested, I trust that it will be acceptable

to you for such materials to be designated by Mr.

Epstein at the time of the review for delivery to

the Committee.

I would also appreciate your making available

this week all memoranda and other materials reflecting

proposals made or actions taken which pertain to the

handwritten note which appears on the bottom of the

4/23/64 memorandum from Mr. sullivan to Mr. Belmont

captioned

• "Martin Luther King" (serial #352), to wit:

"4/23 DA 6 pm I told. him we are working up materials

as to what action should be

taken and what reply

should be made.

He agreed."

Your continued cooperation is appreciated.

SUBJECT: 'Letter Providing SSC Access to DOJ/FBI Materials

Attached is the original of my letter of today to Mr. Elliff

which is self-explanatory, and, I think, meets the issues raised in

the attachment to the July 9, letter from Senator Church and in our

conference with the Attorney General. :

I believe the letter accurately states the Attorney General's

position on SSC access to the information requested. The General

Counsel's office of FBI has advised me that Mr. Kelley may wish to

speak to the Attorney General before the letter is sent, because

of the broad policy problems pertaining to FBI files.

advised Mr. Mintz that this letter fairly and accurately reflects

both my understanding of the AG's policy, and my recent conversation

with the SSC staff in the implementation of that policy. Mr. Mintz

has asked that the letter be delayed until Mr. Kelley has an oppor-

tunity to consider it; I have delayed sending the letter for that

reason, but feel it should go out today, since it simply confirms

a prior position.

I would hope that this letter and the access it authorizes

would facilitate the SSC Executive Session before which I under-

stand the Attorney General is to appear on Wednesday, July 10,

at 2:30.

I am providing a copy of this memo, my memo to Mr. Mintz,

and the attached letter to Doug Marvin so that he may advise the

Attorney General of it. I understand from Elliff that the Committee

experts to and the Attorne to bout him news on te meerence

and the "agreement" to be forthcoming which is referenced

in the June 24, letter.

a casualty of the war as if he had been struck by a bullet.

•Knowing of his problems, the FBI tracked him down, set him up to be

busted and then turned him against his brothers.

The FBI skillfully

played on his paranoia and nightmares to turn him into both an informer

and a provacateur.

Most of the violence mentioned in the indictments

was proposed by Lemmer and rejected by the defendants.

FACT- Pablo

Manuel Fernandez, an associate of two of the Watergate

criminals, approached some of the Gainseville vets and offered

to sell

them weapons.

At the time, he was on

the FBI.

Fernandez was

the payroll of the Miami police

told that the vets would be used for the

purpose of "embarrassing the Democrats."

One of the heaviest counts

the Gainesville brothers face is a charge of attempting to acquire

weapons based on

this incident.

FACT- The federal prosecution team in the

trial is led by Guy Goodwin.

He personally handled the Chicago and Harrisburg conspiracy cases.

works in

the Justice Department's Internal Security Division- the heart

of Nixon's dirty tricks activity.

When the indictments

were prepared,

his: boss was Asst. Attorney General. Robert Mardian, a right-wing fanatic

who, even J. Edgar Hoover distrusted.

Shortly after that, Mardian took

a position on the Committee to Re-elect

the President under his friend.

John Mitchell.

FACT-

The government deliberately tried to push VVAW/Winter Soldier

In to

violence during the conventions.

Yet, oux

demonstrations there-

as all of our activities were marked by a spirit of discipline and

unity. We stand on our record as a non-violent anti-war group.

FACT-

Pexhaps the most outrageous aspect of the government's Gaines-

Ville case is the attempt to make the public believe that a small group

of anti-war veterans would attack the Miami police, the Florida State

Highway Patrol, the National Guard, the 82nd Airborne Division and the

Maxines with slingshots, crossbows

and fried marbles.

Rarely has the

government's contempt for the intelligence of the American people been

so clearly shown.

In order for the government to effectively disrupt the anti-war

movement, it was not essential for them to win in court. The conspiracy

laws make it possible for them to charge people when no crimes have

actually been

committed.

The government has cynically used these laws

to discredit their political opposition, to tie them up in lengthy and

complex court proceedings, and to create. an atmosphere of paranoia in

the country.

Even when acquitted, defendants are kept from doing more

important work and their supporters are tied up in fund-raising

defense work.

Whatever the verdict, the government has already accom-

plished this with the Gainesville 8. This case is different, however.

Since the Watergate disclosures, Nixon's cronies will fight like cor-

nered rats to get a conviction in order to vindicate

themselves and

to justify their subversion and distortion of justice. They

cannot be

allowed to continue their lies and deceptions.

What

can be done? A local defense effort is underway.

In addition,

•there will be a week of nationally-aimed demonstrations in

Gainesville

the week the trial starts.

Funds and assistance are needed. If you

can help, contact the VVAW/Winter Soldier storefront at 363 Connecticut

St., or send donations to P.O. Box 902 Ellicott Station, Buffalo 14205.

NoW

is not the time for cynicism or apathy.

Gainesville may well be

the most important conspiracy case yet to

be tried.

Join the people's

conspiracy for the Gainesville 8 and commit the crime of spreading the

truth

a greater sense of unity and direction.

A productive discussion was held concerning ail delegates" lack of

responsibility towards meeting schedules, host institutions, and

portions of the 10 objectives of VVAW/WSO.

Mike Mazetti and Bob leser were complimented for providing us with

SAILOR ACQUITTED IN SABOTAGE OF CARRIER:

San Francisco, June 12 - Pat Chenoweth, acqused by the Navy of com-

mitting $980, 000 of damage to the Ranger and delaying its departure

to Vietnam by three and a half months, was acquitted after a six

day court martial.

The evidence against Pat was hearsay and the

Navy had tried to hold the court martial in the Philipines to insure

a conviction.

Besides the incident Pat was charged with, the pro-

ceedings revealed that two dozen other acts of sabotage took place

on the Ranger in a five month period of 1972. He was refused bail

from the beginning and spent ten and a half months in the brig.

ADDITIONS TO GAINESVIDLE FACT SHEET:

Fact - John Mitchell, when called upon to testify in pre-trial

hearings by the Gainesville defense, claimed he had no "recol-

lection" of ever ordering wiretaps on the 8 defendants and

other VVAW/WSO members,

The judge would not allow the defense

to question him on any. other topic. Mitchell's supporters now

state that he's suffered two minor strokes recently and is

having a little trouble with his memory.

John's the one who

told reporters, after Nixon first took office, to "watch what

"ref

we do, not what we say."

We're watching.

Fact - The office of a Gainesville defense attorney was broken ..

into last year.. as were

the ollaces of lawyers for the harris

burg defendants.

the Chicago Weatherman,:- the Black Panthers, the

"plumbers' and others, apparently by members of the White House!s

• In another incident, a Gainesville defense lawyer,

flying to Florida, had his briefcase

"misplaced' after airline

officials refused to allow him to take it aboard the plane as

carry-on baggage.

A few days later, it was returned with its

contents in a different order.

Sounds like a conspiracy.

The next general meeting of VVAWWSO is Saturday,

It's

We need any feedback we can get

as to whether or not you've been

getting these mailings on time for meetings and events.

We had the

picnic last month, and a general meeting right after that, and we

found that 9 out of 10 members we talked to didn't get their mailing

until after at least the picnic. We got the mailing out on Tuesday A.M.

prior to the picnic on Sunday.

This has bèen happening more and more.

Either the post office

is totally breaking down or our mail is being

singled out and delayed. Let us know how often, you get mailings,

when and whether you think yours might have been tampered with.

A lot of members have stated that they want to become more active

but can't always make the general meetings. Under the nore or less

autonomous committee structure we have now, you can work on a committee

Committees in need of people

Affairs; Community Action, Political Educa-

tion; and Amnesty/Anti-militarism. We also need people willing to sell

"Winter Soldier" downtown in the mornings.

And we also need people to

pitch in with some of the shitwork like mailings and correcting

addresses, etc. If you can work in any of these areas, contact s

and we'll put the right people in touch.

Gainesville

About the biggest thing VAWWSO faced since the signing of the peace

accords last January has been the Gainesville 8 conspiracy trial.

Almost every mailing this year has said something about it. To many of

us, though, they may still seem kind of remote.

Nine members from

this chapter were in Gainesville from July 30 to August 5 for the

national VVAW/WSO demonstrations and three of us got to spend a day in

court and hear the opening statements.

The demos were a little smaller than we'd hoped for, but we were all

impressed by the high degree of solidarity showed there and the unity

of purpose. uS, as recently as a year ago, wasn't much more

than a name a lot of vets adhered to.. It described a condition.

Now

it's really an organization.

Sometimes we feel a little isolated and

wonder what's coming down in this country and it would be good to re-

member this.

We mentioned

"Winter Soldier" carlier in this newsletter.

That's new this year.

Another project is Operation County Fair.

WAW/WSO members are helping to build a community medical clinic-

and to train

people to

staff it- in an extreme poverty area. of Alabama.

The idea came out of some contacts made last year at the demos around

the Republican convention.

In fact, food and medical supplies left

over from the Gainesville demo went to county Fair. Another project is

the NOSCAM project out of the Ohio region. It's directed at active duty

GI's and publishes

"Camp News."

Another is the PVS Clearing House in

Milwaukee for the dissemination of PVS info to chapters.

Also the VA

• Clearing House in: Chicago. VVAW/WSO is also in the forefront öf the

amnesty movement.

We could go on, but the point is we're no longer a loose handful of

people - we're. an organization: that's growing and that's starting to

get into some serious activity.

often brothers and sisters aren't

aware of what's going on in the rest of the country.

In future news-

•letters, we'll try to include information äbout some of these projects.

of my rough handwritten notes.

Those notes were prepared by

me approximately a year ago, when I was given access to the

underlying documents by the

Watergate Special Prosecution Force

in the course of pretrial discovery in United States v..Ehxlich-

man, et. al.

The documents are as follows:

1.

Several FBI memos and reports concerning Leonard

Boudin.

The text of the first report (dated July 6,

1971) indicates that derogatory information about Mx.

Boudin had been furnished by the FBI to Ray McHugh

of the Copley News Service.

Although I do not have a

copy, there exists in Mr. Colson's White House files

•a memorandum from John Dean to Charles Colson, dated

July 20, 1971, transmitting to Colson a copy of Mcllugh's

article. As you know, fit. Colson served

seven months

In prison for furnishing to Jerry teriorst a report on

Mr.

Boudin prepaxed by Howard Hunt from these FBI

materials.

request and I told him that I would waive the secrecy agreement in regard

to the limited subject of the deposition. Mr. Mohr said that he was to

await a further call from Mr. Boshong making final arrangements.

At 3:42 p.m. on November 10, 1975, Miss Helen W. Gandy

formerly the Secretary to the Director, telephonically advised me that she

had been called by Mary DeOreo who requested an interview at 3:00 p.m.

on Tuesday, November 11, 1975, at Miss Gandy's apartment. Miss DeOreo

said that she would be accompanied by Mark Gitenstein and a court reporter.

She said that Miss DeOreo indicated that representatives of the FBI would not

be permitted to be present during the interview, however, she was not

concerned about that because she felt that she did not feel the need to have

anyone present and she did not desire to have counsel.

I advised Miss Gandy that she could consider the employment

Mr. Robert Wick, Vice President, Audits and Security,

Pan American World Airways, telephone number 212-973-6139, whose

office is located at Room 4512 in the Pan Am Building in New York City,

called at 3:19 p.m. on November 5, 1975. Mr. Wick said that he had been

called at 11:35 a.m. on October 31, 1975, by an individual identifying

himself as Mike Epstein representing the Senate Select Committee.

Epstein requested him to come to Washington for a two to three hour

interview concerning a matter relating to his "employment. " Epstein

did not further describe the subject matter of the interview. An appoint-

ment was arranged for 10:00 a.m. on November 7, 1975.

Mr. Wick said that he was uncertain as to the probable subject

matter of the interview because other matters coming within his responsibilities

at Pan Am which were unrelated to the FBI have been of recent interest to the

Committee. He asked that he be furnished with advice concerning this matter.

D 18/2-14-06

At my request, A Daly telephonically contacted Epstein and

determined that the subject matter of the interview of Mr. Wick would be

"Martin Luther King, Jr."

I called Mr. Wick at 5:00 p.m. on November 5, 1975, and advised

him that we learned that the subject matter of the requested interview would

be "Martin Luther King, Jr." I told Mr. Wick that under the arrangements

existing with the Senate Select Committee, it would be appropriate for me

to release him from his secrecy agreement with the FBI for the interview

requested by Epstein. I further advised him of the need to avoid discussion

of matters that may pertain to pending investigations, information derived

This is to advise of the results of our meeting on this date

with Senator Frank Church, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee

(SSC), members of the Committee's staff, and Department represen-

tatives, wherein these individuals were afforded a complete briefing

on our sensitive Solo intelligence operation and specifically as it

relates to our investigation of the late Martin Luther King, Jr.

Present at the meeting, in addition to Senätor Church,

were William G. Miller, Staff Director of the SSC, and SSC staff

members John Elliff, Michael Epstein, and Mark Gitenstein.

Senator John Tower,

Vice-chairman of the SSC, was unable to attend

and John Bayly of his staff was designated by him as his representative

at the briefing. Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., Special Counsel for Intelli-

gence Coordination at the Department, and his deputy, Steven

Blackhurst, attended. In addition to myself, Inspector-Deputy

Assistant Director T. W. Leavitt and Supervisors Seymor.: F.

Phillips, Michael J. Steinbeck, and David Ryan of the Intelligence

Division attended. The meeting was held in Room S201 of the Capitol

which had previously been swept to counter possible elsur coverage.

The briefing commenced at 9:45 a.m. and although Senator Church

departed at 11:30 a.m. informal discussion continued for another

half-hour.

I commenced the briefing by furnishing the Senator and

SSC representatives a general overview of our Solo intelligence opera-

tion. I emphasized the extreme sensitivity and pointed out the

continuing value of these, 1orces to our intelligence responsibilities

and the national security interests. I summarized the highly-

valuable positive counterintelligence obtained through the operation

relating to the Soviet Union and other hostile communist countries

indicating the importance attached by the State Department and the

intelligence community to the information obtained through this

operation. A photograph depicting one of these sources in conference

with Soviet Communist Party Chairman Brezhnev was exhibited only

to the Senator. Although the names of the sources were not men-

tioned, I clearly pointed out that the information being disclosed

through this briefing could pinpoint the identity of the informants and,

if compromised, could be disastrous to our intelligence interests and

possibly result in personal jeopardy to the sources.

Inspector Leavitt briefly mentioned his recent meeting

with the sources and their concern for the security of their operations.

Supervisor Ryan furnished a general overview of the financial apparatus

of the Communist Party, USA, including its secret character, cover

company operations, and control by the Soviets, tying this informa-

tion into the relationship of the sensitive sources with Stanley David

Levison, the advisor to the late Martin Luther King, Jr.

Supervisor Phillips set forth in detail the relationship of Levison

and King, emphasizing our first-hand information received either

directly by the sources or through Lem Harris indicating King was

under the influence if not the control of secret Communist Party

member Levison. Supervisor Steinbeck advised of the continuing

liaison function of these sources between the Soviets and the Communist

Party, USA, Soviet funding of the Party through the informants and

also highlighted the sensitive nature of the operation. Many questions

of the SSC staff members were candidly answered.

Re: Senstudy 75

Senator Church expressed appreciation for the thorough

briefing and stated he believed there was adequate basis for the FBI

to reasonably conclude certain advisors and close associates of King

were affiliated with the Communist Party and undoubtedly influencing

King. He expressed his belief it was the responsibility of the FBI to

determine the extent of communist or Soviet control or influence of

King, but that he was disturbed that in the course of this coverage an

attempt was made to publicly discredit King. He said he questioned

whether the FBI as a law enforcement agency was acting within its

proper scope in publicly discrediting King. He said it was his view

and concern that such activities placed the Bureau directly involved-

in' the political process where it does not belong.

Senator Church stated he had viewed one FBI document

which indicated an effort within the FBI to cultivate a new responsible

leader of the black movement and he characterized this as political

involvement which he considered highly improper.

Senator Church stated he wished it was possible for the

American people to be aware of the extent to which the Soviets were

runding the Communist Party, UsA. He said this is something the

people should know and he regretted this could not be done under

circumstances which would not undermine the Bureau's work and

responsibilities. He promised his Committee would be as protective

as possible regarding the sensitive information provided and that he

would insure that there would be no public hearings which would

betray the identities of the sources.

Re: Senstudy 75

I reiterated the Director's concern regarding the security

of the sources and the operation and pointed out the extreme need-to-

know basis which this information is held within FBI. I advised

Senator Church that we had requested the meeting with him since

the Committee had raised questions as to the basis for an FBI inves-

tigation of King and from his comments it was felt we had accomplished

the purpose of the meeting--to show there were firm grounds for

opening the case. It was acknowledged that the Committee was con-

cerned with other issues relating to what was done during the

investigation and I was not prepared to address such issues at this

time. However, he could be assured of FBI cooperation in responding

to any questions to the best of our ability.

• This meeting was held pursuant to a request

I am sure you have learned from Messrs. Adams and Daly, former

Attorney General Katzenbach testified before the Church Committee

recently and was shown copies of FBI memos, three in number,

in the months of May, October and December, 1965, regarding

it should be noted that Mr. Katzenbach was shown a xerox copy of

a hand-written-note by him to former Director Hoover bearing

date of December 10, 1965.

Although Mr. Katzenbach does not question the validity of

his hand-written note

dated December 10, 1965, he has informed

the Attorney General and me that he questions his initials on

the three Bureau memoranda described above. Moreover, he asserts

that his recollection of his activities on the dates in question

indicate to him that he never saw these memoranda nor did he

It is respectfully requested that representatives of the

Bureau talk to Mr. Katzenbach about this matter. When he is

interviewed, I would particularly suggest that Mr. Katzenbàch

be shown a copy of a memorandum apparently signed by Mr.

Katzenbach and addressed to Mr. Hoover in March, 1965.

latter memorandum cannot be described by me in any greater detail

because I do not have a copy.

Nonetheless, I can describe it

At his request Deputy Associate Director: James B. Adams

and SA Paul V. Daly of this Division met with Deputy Attorney Gen-

ral harola&. Tyler, Ji., on October 3,

1975. Mr. Tyler advised

nat he had shown former Attorney General. Nicholas deb. Katzenbach

the original Bureau memoranda captioned "Martin Luther King" dated

5/17/65, 10/19/65 and 12/12/65 pertaining to authorization for

microphone surveilance on Martin Luther King.

He was also shown a

note dated 12/10/65 directed from him to Mr. Hoover with his initials

affixed at the bottom thereof. Mr. Tyler related that Katzenbach,

after reviewing the aforementioned documents, stated that it was

doubtful that he had approved the microphone surveillances contained

in the memoranda, although he admitted the initials looked like his

own.

Katzenbach

advanced two arguments as to why he did not believe

he had approved the electronic surveillance requests.

(1) He stated the Martin Luther King investigation was a

very. controversial topic and he was very concerned about it.

Accord-

ing to Mr. Tyler, Katzenbach stated he was so concerned about this

natter that he had discussed it with the President.. In view of his

concern, Katzenbach

stated that if he had approved such requests for

electionic surveillance he would have certainly have recalled doing

so and he had no such recollection.

(2) Katzenbach stated it was not his policy to give

after-the-fact approval to electronic surveillance requests. (The

aforementioned memoranda were all requests for electronic surveil-

lance dated after the surveillance was utilized.) Katzenbach-in-

Formed Mx.. Tyler that he had reviewed his diary and on at least one •

of the occasions when electronic surveillance was used, he was avail-

able to ayprove prior to the use of the device and, therefore,

there

would have been no need for after-the-fact ratification of the

electronic surveillance.

RE:

SENSTUDY. 75

Katzenbach, according to Mr. Tyler, was shown the

Xeroxes of the aforementioned documents by the Senate Select

Committee during interview by that Committee apparently per-

taining to his authorization of electronic surveillance.on

Martin Luther King.

It was pointed out by Mr. Adams that forner Attorney

General Katzenbach in a memorandum dated 9/27/65 captioned-

"Special Investigative Techniques" that he stated, in pari,

concerning wiretaps and microphones "It is my understanding

that such devices will not be used without my authorization,

- although in emergency circumstances they may be used subject

to my later ratification."

Mr. Tyler stated that Katzenbach had. not mentioned this

particular communication and that he, Tyler, did not know that such

à communication existed. Mr. Tyler stated that he and the Attorney

General had indicated to Katzenbach that in order to clear up this

i Katzenback

question it would probably be necessary that he submit to interview

and that certain investigations be conducted: Mr. Tyler mentioned

particularly that handwriting examinations might be necessary to

verify the authenticity of the initials affixed to the documents

in question. Mr. Tyler stated he would send the Bureau a memorandum

requesting a certain investigation to clarily this question.

RIGHTS SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE COMMITTEE

ON GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS, REQUEST FOR

TESTIMONY OF JOER

CRAIG

Senstikaly-75

During the course of a contact on another matter with

Congressman Jack Brooks, Chairman of the Government Operations

Committee, he advised that he had seen Mr. Kelley's letter to

Chairwoman Abzug regarding the proposed testimony of Joe R. Craig

in which the Director indicated he could not grant the request for testimony.

Congressman Brooks described this as nonsense and said that the Director

is treading on dangerous grounds because he in effect is defying a Committee

of Congress. He said it would be different if the FBi was investigating

Craig on a criminal matter because in that case the Congress would

back off. He said that if he had received such a letter, he would likely

call the Director to testify.

When I learned of this contact, I made arrangements to speals

with Congressman Brooks and he returned my call at 5:00 p.m. on

October 23, 1975. I told Congressman Brooks that I wanted to be sure

he understood the true circumstances and I explained to him that the

Criminal Division of the Department of Justice was conducting an inquiry

concerning the matters about which Mr. Craig was called to testify and

that the FBi was not conducting the inquiry. I further explained that

because of the Criminal Division inquiry, the Bureau had been advised by the

Department that the Attorney General's policy was that where the subject matter

of the testimony pertains to a matter under active investigation by the Criminal

Division of the Department, requests for testimony should be declined.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams

Re: Government Information and Individual Rights

?:. i. Subcommittee, etc.

-:

Congressman Brooks said that he misunderstood the

circumstances when he saw the letter addressed to Mrs. Abzug. He

said he did not have a copy of the letter, but had only read it. He said

ithat the Department should assume the responsibility for declining to

provide witnesses called by Committees of Congress if the declination

is based on Department policy. He said that the Committee would then

deal directly with the Attorney General.

Congressman Brooks said that even should the Attorney

General instruct witnesses specifically not to appear, the Committee would

still insist on their appearance unless the individual was under indictment

or unless a criminal case was actually pending.

(""

Congressman Brooks asked me if we had explained to

Mrs: Abzug the circumstances of the Criminal Division inquiry and the

consequent restrictions on the FBI que to Department policy. I told him

that we had called Mrs. Abzug last evening, October 22, 1975, and explained

the circumstances to her. Congressman Brooks said that he would discuss

this matter with Mrs. Abzug but he felt that the subpoenas requested by her

subcommittee would be approved and issued for the appearance of Mr. Craig.

Mr. William Schwartzer

Commission on CIA Activities

Within the United States

Washington, D.C. 20500

Dear Bill:

Enclosed are several documents referred to by Mr. 'Colson

and myself in the courseof his recent sworn deposition at your

office.

In each case, what is provided is a typed version

of my rough handwritten notes.

Those notes were prepared by

in the cy our piotra

me approximately a year ago, when I was given access to the

underlying documents by the Watergate Special Prosecution Force

in the course of pretrial discovery in United States v. Ehrlich-

man, et. aL

The documents are as follows:

Several FBI memos and reports concerning Leonard

Boudin.

The text of the first report (dated July 6,

1971) indicates that derogatory information about Mr.

Boudin had been furnished by the FBI to Ray McHugh

of the Copley News

Service.

Although I do not have

copy, there exists in Mr. Colson's White House files

a memorandum from John Dean to Charles Colson, dated

July 20, 1971, transmitting to Colson a copy of McHugh's

article.

As you know, Mr. Colson served seven months

In prison for turnishing to Jerry textorst a report on

Mx. Boudin prepared by Howard Hunt from these FBI

materials.

Attached letter to the Attorney General responds

to request received from Department, dated 10/17/75, with

reference to a letter from Senator Frank Church, Chairman,

Senate Select Committee (SSC), to the Attorney General,

dated 10/15/75 (copy also attached). Senator Church's

letter, in summary, proposes that SSC Staff conduct interviews

with nine FBI confidential sources in connection with

activities of the sources on behalf of the FBI in our

COINTELPRO operations. The Senator indicated to the Attorney

General that he hoped there would be no objection to such

interviews but if objections were evident he desired to be

contacted by Tuesday, 10/21/75.

This is not a new issue. During August, 1975,

SSC Staff Member John I. Elliff proposed interviews of this

type which were objected to on the principle of the FBI's

obligation to protect the confidentiality of our relationship

with any source whether that confidentiality be implied or

expressed. The Director, at that time, strongly supported

this principle of confidentiality and the issue was taken lo

the Attorney General. At a conference between the Attorney

General and Senator Church on the evening of 8/14/75, it was

agreed that the Committee would attempt a limited number of

interviews of individuals whose identities and/or relationship

with the FBI had been protected. However, as a condition

precedent to such interviews, the fBl was to be allowed to

contact such individuals to intorm them of the proposed

arrangement; however,

subsequently on 8/18/75, Ellift advised

that Senator Church had,reconsidered his agreement with

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re: Senstudy 75

62-116395

Attorney General to the aforementioned procedures as a result

of persuasion by SSC Staff.

Ellift, at that time, indicated

a letter recording Senator Church's change of attitude had

been drafted. To date, no such formal acknowledgement has

been received and no interviews have been attempted in the

interim.

By his most recent communication, 10/15/75, Senator

Church again raises this issue. Although he does note that

the matter was originally discussed with the Attorney General

"some weeks ago," he makes no mention of the agreement with

the Attorney General at that time. Apparently, as some sort

of precedent, he does cite the fact that the FBI did make

available for use and interview the names of Internal Revenue

Service (IRS) personnel who coopénated with the FBI in

Certain COINTELPRO activities. We do not consider this action

on our part to be a concession with respect to confidentiality

of sources since we specifically stipulated that we considered

IRS personnel to be U. S. Government officials acting in their

capacity as such.,

OBSERVATIONS :

Obviously, the SSC has not given up on this issue.

It is just as obvious that no valid issues have arisen which

should cause us to modify the position taken by the Director

and the Attorney General concerning the confidentiality,

implied or expressed, of our relationships with sources

cooperating with the FBI.

OFFICE OF THE

ATTORNEY GENERAL

The Honorable Edward H. Levi

Attorney General

U.S. Department of Justice

ALI INFORICATION CONTAINED

Washington, D.C. 20530

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

The Select Committee is presently investigating the

activities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation carried

on as part of the COINTELPRO program.

We appreciate the

cooperation of the FBI and the Justice Department in

making materials available to us in this area.

however,

one problem remains to be resolved. The Committee believes

its staff must contact and interview certain persons who

received information from the FBI in the course: of:

The FBI has withheld the names of

such persons from the Committee's use on the grounds that.

they were FBI "sources"

The Committee wishes to stress that it is not inter-

ested in questioning these persons about any role as a

, but rather as a recipient of information from

Indeed, in many instances we would not have been

aware that the individual was a "source" had not the FRI

excised the name from the materials delivered to us.

Nevertheless, to minimize any incidental, deleterious effects

on legitimate FBI operations, the Committee has selected a

very limited number of persons whon we desire to contact

and interview. (See attached list and materials.)

As you will recall, we originally discussed this

matter with you some weeks age.

Since then the Committee

has had an opportunity to consider the issue more fully in

the light of our experience with other investigations. For

example, our inquiry into the relationships between the

FBI and the Internal Revenue Service clearly showed the

need to use the names of IPS personnel who cooperated with

the FBI in certain COINTELPRO activities.

Those names

were made available to us for our use.

As I am sure you can appreciate, what is at stake

here is the investigation of serious breaches of the

security and confidentiality of information obtained by

the FBI.

Such information was apparently disclosed or

"leaked" for the purpose of disruption.

The full extent

of such disclosures in many of the cases, such as the

etiorts to discredit Di. Martin Luther King, JI., Is still

unknown.

Surely, it would be incongruous for an inquiry

into these matters to be impaired on the grounds of the

FBI's interest in preserving confidentiality.

The Conmittee has a clear mandate and a firm commit-

ment to investigate allegations that the FBI attempted to

harass and discredit individuals.

The integrity of this

investigation depends upon our ability to conduct inter-

views without the appearance of outside interference.

Therefore, we hope you have no objection to our conducting

the interviews of the persons on the attached list, but if

you do, please contact me by Tuesday, October 21.

S

ncerely.,

At 5:10 p.m. on Odober 28, 1975, Paul E. Ertzinger, of the

Society of Former Special Agents of the FBi, telephonically advised

me that he is working with a group designated by the current President

of the Society to provide cooperation with the Bureau in cases in which

former employees require legal representation in matters rising out

of their former employment in the Bureau. He requested, and I explained

to him, the interim procedures now being followed in the Department

concerning requests for counsel by employees or former employees. In

short, I told him that should a former employee desire the appointment

of counsel he should communicate that request to me and the matter would

be referred to the Department following a review at FBI Headquarters.

He was told that referral to the Department would be given in-

cases in which it appeared that the subject matter pertained to an activity

of the former employee that was within the scope of his employment in the

FBI. I advised Mr. Ertzinger of the need for a list of the names of those

attorneys known to the Society who would be willing to serve as counsel

if requested and appointed, and he agreed to furnish me with such names.

Mr. Ertzinger said that he would be attending the annual

convention of the Society in Houston and that he would discuss these

matters with the President and other officers and make known to them

the interim procedures being followed.

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

I would like to bring to your personal attention

a situation which has severely restricted our efforts to

establish the relevant facts with respect to one of

areas of alleged abuse which is the subject of inquiry.

pursuant to S. Res. 21.

materials

I have been informed by the staff that numerous

which have been requested during the past several

weeks which pertain to the. Ebi's activities witn respect to

DI. Martin Luther King, JI., have been withheld from the.

Committee by the Department because of concern expressed

by Mir. Harry Wachtel, the attorney for the king family and

estate,

as to the appropriateness of the Department's

"disseminating" to the Committee contents of conversations

«monitored during electronic surveillances of Dr. King.

Upon reviewing the lists of materials

requested,

I am at a loss to understand how most of those items could

conceivably be encompassed by the issues raised by Mr. Wachtel,

especially in view of the fact that our letters of request

have specifically pointed out that tape recordings and trans-

cripts should not be supplied.

Accordingly, I want to take this opportunity to

place the Committee formally on record as reaffirming all.of

the outstanding requests for materials relating to the King

Democratic National Convention, and (2) those cortions of any

other requested materials which actually summarize or quote

from conversations monitored during any electronic surveill

ance of Dr. KIng.

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW: OF FORMER FBI SA BY SSC

Senate: Select Committee on Intelligence;

Interview Former Agent William J. McDonnell

September 19, 1975, Washington, D. C.

Mr. James V. Dick, Counsel, captioned Comnittee, on

September 16, 1975, telephonically requested me, W1ll1am J.

McDonnell, to appear for interview at the Dirksen Office

Building, Washington, D. C.

Such interview was accomplished

September. 19, 1975, following a briefing and clearances by the

Bureau on that date. No oath

was administered, nor was a

reporter present.

At the outset, Mr. Dick traced my career in the

Bureau, January, 1941

"January, 1915, offices of assignment,

and dates thereof with, seemingly, emphasis on specific duties

while assigned the New York Office (NYO), October, 1946

July, 1960.

Mail Intercepts

Dick asked a serles of questions regarding my

knowledge of mail intercept operations while assigned the

NYO

I responded that I was in no wey involved with any such

operations and had no personal knowledge regarding such

jactivity while so assigned. Following background inquiries

regarding Joseph Schmit as head of the NYO intelligence

Division and SA John Donahy's assignment as supervisor of a

Soviet section, he asked if I had been present or participated

in a briefing of then Attorney General Robert Kennedy at the

No with regerd to the interception of mail. I pointed out

that I was not assigned the NYO during Kennedy's tern as

Attorney General, having been assigned Bureau Headquarters

in July, 1960; that therefore I was not present or knowledgeable

concerning such briefing. I explained that I had met Robert

Kennedy, briefly and socially, in a reception line at

Washington, D. C., in 1962, and on no other occasion.

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER FBI SA BY SSC

Dick asked if during the time I was supervising

Intelligence Sections in the VYO were such sections engaged

in mail intercepts. I responded that they were not.

Dick asked if at any time from 1960 on was I aware

of mail intercepts on the pert of the NYO or elsewhere.

He was advised that I became aware of such activity indirectly

through a Bureau memorandum and a specific sensitive

investigative matter. Dick did not further pursue this matter:

Watch Lists/NSAJ

In response to questions, Dick was advised that I

was unable to state when the practice of Watch Lists, or

name checks at the NSA originated; that the names were

determined by the supervisory case Agent on a selective basis,

that is whether or not the individual traveled or had contacts

abroad of, in fact, resided abroad and was of interest from

a foreign or counterintelligence standpoint.

Such requests for

a check could be made by periodically submitting a list,

supplemental individual requests, or by telephone if time

was

_ a consideration. Lists or requests could be transmitted

toNSA by courier, liaison, telephone, and teletype. iNSA

did not mount any overt action or progtams responsive to such

lists or checks, but provided data on hand or as it became

aveilable] Meetings were held on occasions between FBI and

NSA personnel for the purpose of acquainting such personnel as

to the Bureau's desires and NSA capabilities.

Dick asked if the Bureau was in a position to provide

a Watch List that was in effect at a given time and was

advised that from experience this would not be possible, nor

would a review of case files

supply such information since

the procedure was not formalized to that extent.

be of FBI interest rather than in response to a specific

FBI request; that NSA was selective concerning the deta

provided, realizing the FBI

was not equipped, manpower-wise,

or in communications areas to absorb the voluminous distribution

by NSA to other agencies: Central Intelligence Agency,

Defense Intelligence Agency, etc., and was primarily responsible

and interested only in deta of security or counterintelligence

value.

Dick was advised that data received from NSA of

a communications intelligence nature and so classified

would not appear in an investigative case file, but received

special handling. Much of such data was destroyed following

an evaluation by the desk supervisor, and if retained, was

maintained in a special file room under stringent access

controls.

Regarding the Watch Lists, Dick asked if the Bureau

submitted any lists to NSA or made any requests subsequent

to Attorney General Fichardson's letter instructing that no

such requests be made of NSA without Department approval.

He was advised that I knaw of no such requests and that NSA

had been advised by the Bureau regarding Richerdson's letter.

Dick asked if I knew of any instance where U. S.

citizens may have appeared on such lists. I advised that I

could not recall, but speculated that it would be logical

for Black Panthers headquertered in Algeria to be on the list

or known terrorists traveling or residing abroad since the

FBI did have the responsibility for determining any foreign

direction, control or financing of domestic individuals or

organizations.

Dear Mr. Shaheen:

I want you to know how much I appreciated the '

opportunity to meet with you and your associates the other

day about the Martin Luther King, Jr. case.

It was most

helpful to have the benefit of the Bureau's knowledge con-

cerning the background of

the case, and I can assure you

that we will do everything possible to avoid joepardizing

any sensitive FBI sources or ongoing operations.

I do want to reiterate our need for the specific

items set forth in earlier document requests which would

presumably establish the factual basis for your conclusion

as of

various

dates in 1962, 1963 and 1964 that Stanley

Levison was a "secret member of the Communist Party, USA.".

Of course in the event that there is no particular document

in any of those years wherein Levison was so-identified to

the FBI, I think it would be helpful for you to let us know

so that we may consider our outstanding requests in that !..

New York which appear to have been the articulated predicates

for the "cominfil" case.

Once

again, I want to thank you for your time and

I look forward

to hearing from you further on this subject.

singerely,

informant and source program that could be inserted in

the record of the testimony of Bureau representatives at

the hearing.

This memorandum would enable the Bureau to

present to the Select Committee a complete description

of its program and to discuss the issues of particular

interest to the Committee members. These include, for

example, 1) the size, scope and purpose of the program,

the some, see

including an assessment of the program's cost and effective-

ness, and the distinctions and relationships between the

intelligence informant program and the Bureau's criminal

informant activity; 2) the criteria that determine when

an informant may be used in an organization or group; and

3) the program's command and control system, including the

limits that are placed on the activities of informants

and the type of information an informant of source is per-

mitted to report to his handling agent and the Bureau.

DATE

Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B. Adams memorandum,

11/5/75, advised that Wick, a vice president of Pan American

World Airways in New York City, was in telephonic touch

with Mr. Mintz concerning a telephone call Wick had received

from Senate Select Committee (SSC) Staff Member Michael

Epstein at which time Epstein requested Wick's presence

in Washington, D. C., for a Staff interview. The memorandum

relates that Epstein told Wick the interview concerned a

matter relating to Wick's employment and that Epstein did

not further describe the subject matter of the interview.

Wick was uncertain as to the possible subject matter and

asked Mr. Mintz's advice. It was then determined by

Supervisor P. V. Daly of Mr. Mintz's office that the subject

matter was Martin luther King, JI. Daly determined this

by telephoning Epstein.

Wick telephoned Phillips 11/6/75 seeking information

relating to the procedures for the interview, Wick indicating

that he was planning to come to Washington, D. C., for

interview by Epstein

Re: Senstudy 75

questions outside the scope of the indicated subject matter

because the subject matter was all he was cleared from

is confidentiality agreement with the FBI for discussion.

le was also told of the four general privileged areas

concerning which he did not have to answer questions, such

as information relating to sensitive investigative techniques,

information which might identify confidential sources, etc.

Wick offered to mail to the Bureau a statement concerning

the interview and he was thanked by Phillips for this.

Wick made it a point to advise Phillips that he

was rather annoyed at Epstein's approach to him, particularly

that Wick had tried on more than one occasion during

• the

telephone conversation with Epstein to pry from Epstein the

subject matter of the interview but Epstein persisted in not

advising him.

Daly has advised that, when he called Epstein at

Mr. Mintz's behest, he asked Epstein why he did not tell

Wick the subject matter of the interview and Epstein's reply

was that Wick had not asked him. (It should be noted that,

when Daly had the conversation with Epstein, it was before

Wick's call to Phillips.)

OBSERVATIONS:

The foregoing represents two improprieties on the

part of Epstein. The first concerns the fact that, contrary

concerns divergent reports to us on the Wick-Epstein conver-

sation. Wick made it absolutely clear that he pressed

Epstein for specificity as to the subject matter of the

of Phillips that, if he had to choose who to believe, there

is no doubt but that it is Wick.

Senator Church:

Senatuly -75

I feel it my duty as a citizen of this country to express my

feelings to you about your Senate Intelligence Operations Committee.pg

I firmly believe in the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. and think that they

should do whatever they think nessasary to stop the spread of

crime and subversion by outside powers.

If they think that I'm a part of something that is against the

United

States then

I want them to open my mail or tap my phones

until they're convinced one way or the other about my activitys.

These two organizations, F.B.I. and C:I.A.,.

were not formed to

deal with ANGELS so they shouldn't be expected to act like INGeLs.

I strongly believe that you and your conmittce are wrong and hurting i

the fight that is so important to our country.

I urge you to read Ronald Reagans "Viewpoint" October 22, 1975

"The Communist Conspiracy Parts 1 and 2".

This I feel will give

you a better idea about how your committee is hurting our country.

In closing let me say that I do not like form letters....they just

waste goverument money.

During the morning of October 29

received

a telephone call from an individual who reported himself

as John Lofton, a syndicated writer. Mr. Lofton also

stated he was a friend öf Assistant Director Donald Moore

and I could check his, Mr. Lofton's, credentials with

Mr. Moore.

Mr. Lofton stated that he had been provided a

memorandum which had been prepared for Senator Church

apparently by Mr. William Miller, Staff Director of the

senate select committee. According to Mr. Lotton, this

memorandum reported the details of a briefing by Mr. Wannall

Select Committee Staff concerning Soviet and Soviet-bloc

activities on Capitol Hill. Mr. Lofton stated that the

memorandum did not back up the statements made by Senator

Goldwater that the Soviets had infiltrated seven to nine

Senate staffs. According

to Mr. Lofton he had first

reported Senator Goldwater's statements.

stated that he was aware that Senator Churchi Lofton

s committee

did not favor the FBI and he was therefore seeking my

comment on what was said during the briefing with the

inference that he, Mr. Lofton,

intended to balance the

scale.

I advised Mr.

discuss with him any details of the briefing provided

details

Lofton that I did not desire to

the Staff members of the Select Committee.

Mr. Lofton then referred to statements which

he attributed to Alsop that the FBI was not permitted

to go on Capitol Hill and that Capitol Hill was there-

fore a safe haven for espionage agents.

'I referred

Mr. Lofton to statements made by Director Kelley and

Assistant Director Wannall before the seminar of the

Mr. Lofton requested that I expand

on this position and I suggested that he might desire to

contact Assistant Director Moore for any further contact.

Mr. Lofton subsequently did contact Assistant

Director Moore at which time he again explained that he

ACTION:

If you agree, there is an attached memorandum

to the Deputy Attorney

General concerning the contact

made by John Lofton and his statements that he had access

to a memorandum prepared for Senator Church by members of

his staff concerning a briefing which had been given by

representatives of the FBI.

It is noted that portions of

this briefing were classified. It is not known whether

the memorandum prepared for Senator Church contained this

classified information.

We should advise the Deputy Attorney

General that we are furnishing this for his information and

unless requested by him, we will make no further inquiries

concerning the memorandum of Senate Select Committee

Dear Mr. Baise:

I am writing to request from the Department all files within the

possession of the Federal Bureau of Investigation which relate

in any way to A.J| Woolston-Smith. As I mentioned in our recent

conversation, it is of vital importance that we obtain this information

as soon as possible because of our pending interview with Mr. Smith.

As you may recall from our previous discussions, I indicated two

specific time sequences wherein it has been established that the

Bureau received reports regarding Mr. Smith. The first of these

is in December 1954 when Smith's name came up in a CIA related

matter in Boston, Massachusetts. The second is on October 6, 1972

when a representative of a foreign nation's intelligence service

provided the FBI with a report on certain activities of Smith.. In

addition to these two specific dates and reports, however, we are

requesting the entire file or files possessed by the FBI on MI. Smith.

Thanks again for your continied assistance and cooperation.

He stated his son contacted Mr. Lanowet and in turn

was told to

get In touch with a Mr. A. J. Wooten-Smith, Science

Securities, 6th Avenue, New York City, New York.

He stated

his son then telephonically contacted Smith, who Dr. Casolaro

stated, was expecting his call and that Smith revealed to his

son that he had an interest in the possibility that the

Democrats had prior knowledge about the break-in and that

he would -be willing to assist j. Daniel in doing research in

the matter. DI. Casolaro stated that from subsequent telephonic

contacts his son had with Saith he learned that

approximately one month prior to the break-in Smith met with

John Stewart, Democratic National Committee Communications

Director in the Office of Milliam Haddad, New York City, New

York, and

at this time they discussed the possibility that

there would be surveillances on the Democratic National

Headquarters: DI. Casolazo stated his son also determined that.

the Democratic National Committee had been sent a letter by

Smith in this regard, whereby he requested the meeting and

though smith promised to furish his son with a copy of the

letter, it has not been forthconing.

Dr. Casolaro stated that in addition to the above

meeting, Smith also advised his son that he had met a

MI. Regan, who he stated was an ex-FBI Agent who was a

wire tap expert. He stated that when he met Regan, he (Regan) was

Committee io Re-elect the President, and

though Smith did not admit io this; he (DI. Casolaro)

deducted from his knowledge of the above meeting

and the fact that Regan mas employed by the Committee to

Re-elect the President the Democrats must have known something

was up. Dr. Casolaro stated that Smith additionally indicated

to his son that the word was out prior to the break-in on

James Mc Cord's attempts to purchase bugging equipment

that the p cosoats.

had no further information to offer.

Dr. Casolaro advised that his son has not personally

He stated though that his son

is excellent at obtaining information and did not consider

it unusual that he could develop this information without ever

meeting A. J. Wooten-Smith. He further stated that Smith

continues

to contact his son for progress reports and that

Smith neither appears to want credit nor is looking for...

financial gain from his assistance.

DI. Casolaro advised that previous to his attempt

to furnish his information to the Arlington County, Virginia,

Police Department, he had also been in contact with Senator

Baker's Office, (first nane unknown) Shapiro, who he

identified as a law partner of Charles Colson, and numerous

individuals on Capital Hill whom he did

to MI. Lobe, who is the owner of a Manchester, New Hampshire,

newspaper, but was turned down by both for lack of sufficient

information.

DI. Casolaro made it a point to state that he is in.

no way suffering from any mental disorder nor that he is playing

STATEMENT OF SPECIAL AGENT WILLIAM A. BRANIGAN,

REGARDING INTERVITY WITH A STAFF MEMBER OF THE

U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

On October 9, 1975, Special Agent HilllamA. Branigar

was interviewed by Mr. James

Dick, stail Member of the U.s.

Senate Select Committee on Intellige.ce Activities.

The

interview, which took place in the office space of

U.S. Senate, was fully recorded and lasted from approximately

2:15 p.m. until. 5:15 p.M.

At the outset of the interview, Mr. Dick advised

that it was his intention to have an oath administered by

a United States Senator but none such was available.

He advised that SA Branigan would be given the opportunity

to review the record of the interview, and he requested that

SA. Branigan at that time swear an oath before a United States

Senator who would then be available. SA Branigan agreed to

do this.

Also at the outset of the

hearing, Mix. Dick advised

SA Branigan that it was his right to refuse to answer any

question, that he had the right to counsel, and that at any

time could interrupt the interview for the

purpose of consulting

counsel.

Mr'. Dick furnished SA Branigan with Xerox copies

of approximately eleven intra-Bureau documents which Mi. Dick

said had been made available to the Committee through the

Departnent of Justice.

During the interview a number of these

documents vere made a

part of the record.

Mr'. Dick requested

that SA Branigan identify and

briefly explain the Bureau's various mail intercept surveys.

When this was accomplished, Mr. Dick directed specific questions

at our survey known as 7 Coverage.

In answer to his specific

question, Nr. Dick was advised Z Coverage was instituted in

Washington,

D. C., prior to the United States entry into

World War II. Mr. Dick exhibited

a memorandum which had been

prepared by former Special Agent E. T. Turner in the mid-1950s

which dealt with a request by the Washington Field Office to

• renew the Z Coverage mail program. Mr. Dick was advised that

this memorandum obviously reflected that Z Coverage had been

discontinued at a date sometime before the date of the

memorandum and the program was reinstituted sometime after the

memorandum.

Mx. Dick was advised that SA Branigan had no

present recollection as to the specific dates involved.

uT. Dick was also advised that sometime during the 1950s the

program had been extended to New York and that mail directed

to the Soviet Mission to the United Nations was the object of

of the 7 coverage Branian any.

ur. Dick inquired it at any time during the operation

of the ! Coverage there was any thought given to legalizing

the coverage.

Mr. Branigan advised that he had no recollection

of any such effort in this respect.

Mr. Dick also inquired

as to the criteria which were used by the Agents who worked

the Z Coverage in selecting mail for special attention.

He was advised that there were no written criteria, and it was

the recollection of SA Branigan that the Agents who worked the

Z Coverage used their own judgment based upon past experience

developed over an extended period of time im selecting mail

for special attention.

With respect to the Sam Survey, Mir. Dick was advised

that operations under

the Sam Survey were umdertaken to locate

and identify Soviet illegals operating in the United States.

These operations were begun based on solid knowledge as to how

Soviet illegals were instructed to prepare their correspondence

"for transmittal to mail-drop locations in Western Europe.

Communications of illegal agents had telltale indicators,

both

in the envelopes and the letters themselves, and these indicators

were believed to be still valid and in use by Soviet illegals

at the present time.

Mr. Dick was also informed that mail

selected for special attention would have more than one

indicator unless, of course, It was addressed to a known

mail-drop address in murope.

Nr. Dick had available a letter

from our New York Office which set forth the results and the

accomplishments of the Sam Survey for a particular period.

Mr. Dick referred specifically to information set forth in the

letter concerning the activities of some New Left groups.

and he was advised that this Survey was considered highly

productive in that it put the Bureau in a position of identifying

Soviet illegals in the United States without reference to any

other agency or any other source both within and without the

Soviet intelligence services.

Mr. Dick inquired concerning the Sun Survey which

' involved the screening of mail directed to known Soviet intelli-

gence agents who were employed by the United Nations Secretariat.

Mr. Dick was advised that this program was again directed at

the detection of illegal agents who might be operating in the

The program was based on indicators which would

that we had not detected any illegals by this program and it

was of limited duration.

During the interview, Mr. Dick asked a number of

questions concerning the level

of authority for approval of

mail intercept surveys.

He inquired if Mr. Hoover had approved

the original memorandum in the Sam Survey.

Mr. Dick was advised

that based upon W. A. Branigan's review of the file, it did not

appear that this original memorandum had gone to the Director but

certainly subsequent mail that periodically evaluated the program

had been seen and approved by Mr. Hoover.

Nr. Dick was also

advised that it was Mr. Branigan's understanding that if a field

office desired to engage in a mail intercept survey, Bureau

Headquarters approval would be necessary.

Mr. Dick had available

a communication from our San Francisco Office which indicated that

office had developed a source who had access to mail coming from

Communist China through Canada. It was pointed out to Mr. Dick

that while this source may have been developed by the San Francisco

Office on their own initiative, Bureau Headquarters was consulted

and had issued guidelines concerning material reported by the

source.

Nx. Dick asked a number of questions concerning mail

programs directed against mail coming from and going to Communist

China. For the most part, SA Branigan was not familiar with

these programs and was unable to provide positive answers to

the questions posed.

With respect to Bureau Source 200, also known as

the CIA's Hunter Project, Mr. Dick inquired

why the Bureau's

participation in. this was not terminated at the time

Mr. Hoover terminated our other mail intercept surveys.

In this regard, SA Branigan advised him that obviously

the

Bureau Source 200 Program was not considered in the same

light as the Sam Survey and the other programs.

With respect

to Bureau Source 200, the Bureau was merely a recipient of

information provided by another agency, namely, the CIA.

It• Dick exhibited a memorandum prepared by SA Branigan

advise then Acting Director Gray that the CIA was proposing

that the Bureau take over the Hunter Project. In answer to

Mr. Dick's question, he was advised that the Bureau certainly

never seriously considered taking, over the Project because

of its magnitude, the number of personnel that would be

required to operate the program, and because the CIA themselves

had indicated that the Postal Service feared that there was

a serious threat to the security of the program. Mr. Dick

inquired as to whether the Bureau considered the product from

the Hunter Project as valuable as our Sam Survey.

He was

advised that certainly there was no comparison between the

results of the Hunter Project and the results that came from

the Sam Survey.

entitled to be represented by counsel, could refuse to ba

interviewed and could refuse to answer any questions.

SA Lee

was placed under oath by the stenographer who is a Notary Public

in the District of Columbia since no senator was present.

Mir. Dick advised that when the testimony was transcribed, it

could be reviewed by SA Lee and minor changes made but any major

changes would have to be approved by a senator. Also at that

time, Il the Bureau so desired, SA lee could be sworn in by a

senator.

The questions covered a discussion of the SAM and

GUS Survey programs operated by the FBI (Burean) between 1958

and 1966; the Hunter Project (Sureau Informant 200), which was

a CIA program operated until May, 1973; and Z Coverage operated

by the Bureau between 1940 and 1966+

With regard to the SAM Survey, Dick asked when it was

initiated and when it was stopped.

He was furnished with these

dates; 1958 through July, 1966-

He noted that one of the items

in his possession, a New York letter dated April 8, 1966,

asked if we developed information on domestic organizations

such as these within the framework of the SAM Survey which was

aimed at detecting illegals.

SA Lee pointed out the reason

probably was to determine if there was any Soviet-type influence

in these organizations.

Mr. Dick asked about the Washington Field Office

obtaining letters in another case being directed to a known

mail drop

in France from an illegal in the United States.

(The word "France" was excised from the copy in the possession

of Mr. Dick.) Mr. Dick was told that this was a separate case

received from a foreign intelligence source but it was handled

within the framework of the SAM survey. (This relates to an-

other case which was based on information furnished to the

Bureau by French intelligence.)

Mr. Dick also asked if FBIHQ exercised control other

than the annual review.

He was told that FBIHQ did exercise

control and it was pointed out to him that the Los Angeles

Office had been instructed to discontinue the program due to

unproductivity and to concentrate on other areas of investigative

work to detect illegals.

Mr. Dick asked what action would be taken if the SAM

survey developed information showing a violation of criminal

Law within our jurisdictIon.

He was told it probably would have

to be referred to the Division in the FBI handling the criminal

violation involved with all the safeguards against disclosure

of the source and limitation on the use of material explained.

He was told that in the recollection of SA Lee, no such informa-

tion was ever developed.

Mr. Dick asked if justification of the programs was

ever done on a basis less than annual review. He was told on

certain occasions we did if Mr. Hoover or another Bureau

official asked for such a review on a shorter basis..

Mr. Dick made inquiry concerning the origin of the

SAM Survey program and asked if Mr. Hoover was aware ot it.

He

was told that the program originated in a conference held with

personnel from some of our field offices, including the

New York Office, and FBIHQ personnel. During this conference,

This memorandum was

Mr. Dick asked the reasons for the discontinuance of the program

In July, 1966, particularly since Mr. Hoover had approved the

continuation of the program for a year in the New York Office

and Washington Field Office in April, 1966. Mr. Dick was told

that the reason Mr. Hoover made this decision was not known.

Mr. Dick asked about the GUS Survey and he was told

it involved a review of mail destined for certain postal zones

in New York, Detroit and San Francisco.

He was told it was

based on knowledge gained from our work that we could identify

mail directed to

illegals through indicators we knew were used

by Soviet intelligence officers in commmicating with illegals.

He was told we were looking for mail posted in the United States

usually,

in the New York ox Washington, D. C.,

area, and directed

to an illegal.

The reason for the selection ot certain postal

zones was based on the fact that the areas were the type in which

an illegal may Live; that is,

a transient-type population with

hotels, boarding and rooming

houses which attract someone

trying to establish himself in the United States.

Mr. Dick was

told in response to a question concerning the indicators that

they were still considered to be valid.

Concerning Z Goverage, Mr. Dick pointed out a memorandum

had been prepared in September, 1951, discussing the possibilities

of opening the mail legally.

Mr. Dick asked SA Lee whether

any further action had been taken on this matter and he was told

SA Lee had no such knowledge.

Mr. Dick asked for the criteria

used in Z Coverage and he was told this was something which

was left to the judgment of the individual Agent who reviewed

Concerning the Hunter Project, Mr. Dick asked how

Intormation concerning American citizens traveling in Russia

or studying in Russia would be of assistance in locating illegals.

It was pointed out that such individuals could have possibly

been engaged in activities in the Soviet Union which caused

them to be compromised and might have been recruited on the

basis of such compromise. In additión, American students

studying at schools such as Patrice Lumumba University may well

have

been recruited by Soviet intelligence.

were included

Mx. Dick asked why the names of certain individuals

were included on the Hunter Watch List, He specifically

referred to the name Leonard Bernstein.

SA Lee informed him

he had no information concerning Bernstein or why his name

was included on the Watch List.

Mr. Dick asked about the details of the offer made

by CIA I'He was told that a appointment was made for a CIA

1973, to turn the Hunter Project over to the

official to see Mr. L. Patrick Gray III concerning this but no

infornation was received that the meeting had taken place and,

if so, what transpired.

He asked what the teeling of

SA lee was concerning this offer and it was pointed out that

CIA had informed us there were security problems involved and

for this reason the opinion of SA Lee was that it might not

be wise to take over the project. He asked if SA Lee thought

the programs should be reinstituted and he was told that in

light of its questionable legality, reinstitution would be

questionable.

He then asked if the answer would be the same if

the Attorney General approved the reinstitution ot the programs

and SA Lee stated that he would favor reinstitution of the

programs under those circumstances since it was believed they

were still valid investigative techniques.
