This Individuai

had given his name as HARVEY LOWMEYER and stated

that he resided at 1907 South 11th Street,

Irom the bill of sale that was prepared by

Mr. BAKER.

"Following the sale this individual left

the store carrying the gun in & cardboard box

utilized by the Bronning Manufacturing Company.

This box was used because with the scope mounted

the rifle mould not fit in the normal Remington ber.

He also took the empty Remington manufacturer's

carton with him when he loft.

"It was, as best I recall, either later

that alternoon or early the following Saturday

purchased was not the gun he wanted and he requistri

Morris Cunningham, Washington representative of the

Tetaphono Ra. -

Dinarton Sar'y —

Memphis Commercial Appeal, called Inspector Bowers during the

alternoon of 10-30-64 from Memphis, where he is covering the James Earl

Ray hearing in Federal District Court. Cunningham said Ray had testried

to having sent a letter to Senator James O. Eastland (D-Miss.) shortly after

he had been sentenced to prison for the King slaying. Ray allegedly said

that he told Senator Eastland in the letter that he personally did not shoot

King, but was partially responsible for his death. (News reports, 10-30-74,

on the hearing corroborate this and indicated that Ray's letter to Senator

Eastland was read into the record.)

Cunningham said he called Senator Eastland at his residence in

Mississippi and asked him about this matter. Eastland recalled the letter

and said he advised Cunningham about it when it was received, however,

Cunningham does not recall this. He said Eastland had told him he had

forwarded the letter to the FBI as he does many similar letters he receives

Ifrom prisoners. Cunningham said Eastland suggested he call Bowers to

determine if the FBI could locate the letter and to tell Bowers that he,

Eastland, approves furnishing contents of the letter to Cunningham.

Bowers pointed out to Cunningham that we were precluded from

-5.

doing so under Department regulations. It was pointed out to him, however,

that should Senator Eastland desire, a copy of the letter, if located, could

be made available to the Senator's office and the Senator could release the

letter if he wishes. Cunningham said that should be satisfactory with him.

He was told he would be advised as soon as this matter could be checked out. He

can be reached through the news room of the Memphis Commercial Appeal,

84

area code 901 526-8811 in Memphis.

REC 544-38861-596%

This matter was checked with Courtney Pace, Administrative

Assistant to Senator Eastland, who indicated he was aware of Cunningham's request.

McDermott to Jenkins Memo

Re: MURKIN

He said that should we find the letter in question and furnish a copy to

him, he would be glad to handle the matter with Cunningham for the Senator.

Bufiles reflect that Senator Eastland made a copy of Ray's letter

available to Inspector Bowers on 3-17-69. Accordingly, a copy of Ray's

letter, see attached, has been made available to Courtney Pace on 10-31-74

so that he can handle the matter with Cunningham.

ME. CHARLIE QUITMAN STEPHENS

Lleutenant J. D. HAMBY, Homicide Bureau, Memphis Police

Department, and SA FRANKLIN L. JOHNSON:

Mr. STEPHENS, who stated he 1s 46 years of age,"

and his wife occupy 2 rooms in thr north wing of a rooming

house, the address of which 1s 422} S. Main Street. This

rooming house actually covera the second floor of 2

separate buildings, Mr. STEPHENS' room being located in the

north building in the southeast corner of the north building.

Sometime in the late afternoon of April 4, 1968,

he and his wife were in their roon. His wife, who has

recently been in the hospital for an extended period of

time, was in bed in their combination of living-bedroom.

He was in the kitchen, which is east of the living-bedroon.

He was repairing a radio on a table located at the north

wall of the kitchen.

Inmediately north of him 18 & common

bathroon which is located at the east end of an east-west

hallway in the north building.

Mhile he was repairing the

radio, he heard what he is certain was a shot, and he is

certain that shot came from the bathroom from a point

within just a few feet of where he mas sitting. He has so

way of knowing the time but can only estimate it was sometime

between 5:00 and 6:00 PM.

Upon hearing this shot, he walked out of the kitchen

through his l1ving-bedroon and opened the door leading onto

the hallway and observed a man running west dom this hallway

and this man was carrying a large bundle of some kind.

would estimate that this bundle or package was at least

3 or 4 feet long and 6 to 8 inches thick.

Although he saw the

man and the bundle only momentarily, he grinnd the impression

tbat the bundle was wrapped in sonothing, possibly a newspaper.

This man continued running to the end of

the hallway turning

deft (south) and apparently thereafter ran down the stairways

onto the street, although he could not actually see the man

going down the starvate

He pointed out that

which must be used by a number of different tenants.

He

also specifically recalled that only on one occasion did

CARPENTER recalls that he wrote on the box in which he

placed the binoculars the price $39.95 and the amount of

tax which was $1.60 and

added the two figures for a total

of $41.55. He placed the sales slip and the box with the

binoculars in it in a gray paper bag which bears the name

of York Arms on Its side. The binoculars were in a leather

or similar type carrying case. The store does not record

or maintain serial numbers for these binoculars and it is

not known what, it any, serial number was on this particular

Mr.

CARPENTER recalls that the individual reached

Into his right front pants pocket to get the

. money with which

to pay for the binoculars.

The money was not in a billfold

or a money clip.

The customer withdrew two $20 bills from

a roll which contained several other bills, at least two of

which Mr. CARPENTER believes were $20 bills.

The customer

also took a $1.00 bill from this roll and then reached into

his other front pockot with his left hand and secured tho

quarters and a'nickel, making a total of $41.55 for the

payment. After purchasing the binoculars, the customer

walked from the store and Mr. CARPENTER told him to "hurry

reply is not recalled, if any was made. Mr. CARPENTER does

not know which direction the customer took after leaving the

store:

Mr. CARPENTER does not recall ever having seen

this individual before in the store or elsewhere, but feels

relatively certain that 11 he sees him again he would be

able to recognize him.

The customer, while in the store, did not ask to

see any other merchandise such as rifles or guns or '

ammunition of any kind, and made no inquiry at all concerning

any other merchandise.

Mr. CARPENTER stated that when the customer entered

the store CARPENTER was near the front of the store talking

to Mr. VERNON YORK. Further back in the storê"he believes".

CHARLES GIBSON was near the cash register, and Mr. HUGH

BADDLEY, & clerk, was also somewhere in the store. He believes

also that possibly Mr. CORDRA YORK, JR., may have been in

the store, but he does not know whether

or not any of these

individuals took notice of the customer.

furnished the following informatior

to

Homicide Bureau, _Memphis Police

Department, and SA

Mr. SEPHENS, who stated he is 46 years of age,

and his wife occupy 2 rooms in the north' wing of a rooming

house, the address of which is 4225 S. Main Street. This

rooming house actually covers the second floor of 2:

Separate buildings, Mr. STEPHENS' room being located in the

north building in the southeast corner of the north building.

Sometime in the late afternoon of April 4, 1968,.

he and his wifewere in their room. His wife, who has

recently been in the hospital for an extended

period of

time, was in bed in their combination of living-bedroom.

He was in

the kitchen, which is east of the living-bedroom.

He was repairing a radio on a, table located at the north

wall of the kitchen.

Immediately north of him is a common

bathroom which is located at the east end of an east-west

hallway in the north building.. While he was repairing the

radio, he neard what he is certain was a shot, and he 18

certain that shot came from the bathroom from

a point

within just a few feet of where he was sitting.

He has no

way of knowing the time but can only estimate it was sometime

between

5:00 and 6:00 PM..

Upon hearing this shot, he walked out of the kitchen

through his living-bedroom and opened the door leading onto

the hallway and observed a man running west down this hallway

and this man was carrying a large bundle of some kind.

He

would estimate that this bundle or package was at least

3 or 4 feet long and 6 to 8 inches thick.

Although he saw the

man and the bundle only momentarily, he gained the impression

that the bundle was wrapped in something, possibly a newspaper.

This man continued running to the end of

the hallway turning

left (south) and apparently thereafter ran down the stairways

onto the street, although he could not actually see the man

going down the stairway.

It immediately occurred to Mr. STEPHENS that

this was the same man he had seen earlier in the afternoon,

possibly around mid-afternoon, standing at the door to

room 5-B which is located innediately west of Mr.

STEPHENS 3 living-bedroom.

He'stated that around' iid-

. r;

afternoon he had seen a man with Mrs. BREWER standing in the

hallway at the entrance to roon 5-B lolling into room 5-B.

He saw the man's left side.

The man had nothing in his hands

at the time. He assumed this was some new guest looking

at a room.

MI. STEPHENS stated that he and his wife remained

in their room the rest

of the afternoon. He pointed out that

he, Mr. STEPHENS, is a disabled veteran who has been treated

for tuberculosis,

and he spends most of his time in his rooms

with his wife who'is also 111 and who at present is a bed

patient.

Sometime after seeing thisman with Mrs. BREWER, he.

heard someone in room 5-B and assumed the man hehad seen

had rented the room next door. He stated that he recalls

on several different occasions hearing footsteps in this room

and also leaving fron this room past his (Mr. STEPHENS'S)

room and into the connon bathroom at the east end of the

hall. He was also very much aware that when the person went

from room 5-B to the bathroom, that person remained in the bath-

room for a considerable period of time. He pointed out that

this is particularly noticeable since this is a coumon bathroom

which must be used by a number of different tenants.

also specifically recalled that only on one occasion did

he hear the commode being flushed and he was therefore curious

as to why this person was spending so much time in the bathroom.

He stated that on the last occasion that someone'..

went fron number 5-B to the bathroom prior to the time he

heard the shot, he would estimate that that person remained

in the bathroon for at least 20 to 30 minutes. During

this period he heard no noises coming from the bathroom.

He also specifically recalls that during this same period,

Mr. WILLIS ANCHUN (phonetic), who occupies room 4-B, immedt-

ately west of 5-B where the new tenant apparently was located,.

had knocked on Mr. STEPHENS'S door and somewhat Li angrily

inquired as to who was staying in the bathroom so long.

it was at the end of this latter period of time

that Mr. STEPHENS heard the above described shot which he

was certain came fron the bathroon. He stated that immediately

after the shot was fired he heard some people located across

the street, east of the building where he lives, screaming..

que to the excitement of the moment, the fact that people

across the street in the vicinity of the Lorraine Motel

were screaming, and the fact that his hearing is not the

best, he did rit hear any additional noises coming from the

bathroom. He pointed out that he would expect to hear a

"scuffle" coming from the bathroom if the man in the bathroom

had fired

, the shot that killed MARTIN LUTHER KING, but he

cannot recall hearing such a."scuffle." He stated that he

simply has no way of knowing whether the man came out of the

bathroom, went into room 5-B and then ran out of 5-B down

the hall toward the front of the building, or whether the man

* in the bathroom ran directly from the bathroon down the

hallway toward the front of the building. He stated he did

hesitate a few mosents after hearing the shot and hearing the

screaming outside before he went to the door and looked down

the hall to see the man running carrying something in his hand.

Mr. STEPHENS advised that the only people in the

north building of this rooming house at the time of this

incident were (1) Mr. STEPHENS, (2) Hr. STEPHENS's wife,

who was in bed and who was never in a position to observe

anything, (3) Mr. WILLIS ANCHUIZ (phonetic), above, in room

4-B, who came out of his room and was seen by Mr. STEPHENS

at the same time Mr. STEPHENS saw the man running down the

hall, (4) Mrs. JESSIE LET:ETTER, a deaf and dumb lady who re-

sides'in room 1-B toward the front (west) of the north ming

or north building, and (5) the unknown man who had occupied

room 5-B who was running down the hall as previously stated

Mr. STEPHENS stated that Mr. ANCHULz made some remark

to the unknown man who was running down the hallway and the

unknown man apparently made some kind of reply.

ME 44-1987

Mr. STEPHENS advised that whereas he could hear

footsteps in S-B and could hear footstep. between 5-B and the

bathroom,

he at no time heard any conversation in 5-B;

and he is certain that there was no conversation in 5-B

from the time the new tenant checked in until the time

he heard the shot. He stated he never heard any noise or

footsteps which would indicate to him there was ever more

than one person in room 5-B. He pointed out that whereas

his hearing is not too good, it is very easy to hear noises

be the

in the adjoining rooms of this rooming house and he definitely

can hear normal conversation coming from that room. Mr.

STEPHENS stated that when he saw the new tenant with Mrs.

BREWER standing in front of 5-B, he only saw the left side

of the new tenant, and when he saw what he believes to be the

same man running down the hallway carrying something, he only

saw this person from the rear..

He pointed out he never saw

him directly in front, but based upon his observations he

would describe this person as follows:

apartment to him, Apartment 5B, leave his room several times

as sounding like a gunshot come from the bathroom. Upon hearing

this noise, Mr. STEPHENS ran from the kitchen where he was repairing

his radio to his door that led to the hallway. He stated this is

only a distance of about 10 to 12 feet.

Upon opening the door

he saw a man leave the bathroom carrying a package of about three

feet long and wrapped in what appeared to be newspaper. He saw

the man run down the hall and then turn left as if he were trying

to leave the apartment building. As this was happening WILLIE.

and went

to the bathroom. ANSCHUTZ then told STEPHENS to look out

of his window.

policemen scurrying about and people running screaming in the

vicinity of the hotel.

tenants in this rooming house. She pointed out that this

rooming house is located in a

poorer section of town

where most of the tenants are older people or others

with limited income, a number of whon are alcoholics,

and this man was clean and neatly dressed, giving the

Impression that he could obtain lodging in nicer

surroundings.

Mrs. BREWER at this time attempted to recall

the words used by this person.

As she recalls, when she

went to the door and cracked open the door, leaving the

chain fastened, the man's first words were, "Do you have

a room for rent?" She answered in the affirmative and

asked him whether he wanted a room by the week of by the

month.

He replied, as nearly as she can recall, by

stating simply, "By the week." At this point she

unfastened the

chain

which secured the,partially opened

door and walked directly to Room 8 located in the south

wing of this rooming house.

She stated that the man

followed her to the room and looked inside the room but

never actually entered the room, at which time his words,

: 14

## Page 128

ME 44-1987

3

as nearly as she can recall, were, "Well, I don't need the

Stove and refrigerator since I won't be

doing any cooking.

I was thinking more of a sleeping room."

At this point Miss. BREWER explained that the

only vacant "sleeping room" (or room with no stove and

refrigerator) which she had in either wing of the

rooming house was Room 5-B in the north wing. She

therefore innediately walked from Room 8 in the south

wing across the enclosed walkway which connects the

south wing to the north wing.of the rooming house,

and thereafter to Room 5-B. Again she walked in front

of the man.

the man imnediately stated that he would take that room.

She then walkers, to her room in the south wing of the

building, followed by the unknown man, who paid her

$8.50, as

outlined previously by her, for the rent of

Room 5-B for one week in advance.

Mrs. BREWER stated that most of the rooms in

this rooming house can be secured only with the use of a

padlock, and after showing this individual Room 5-B, she

removed

the padlock from the door and took the padlock

with her to her room.

She stated it is necessary that

tenants put up a deposit if they secure the padlock, but

this tenant did not inguire as to how he could lock the

door and did not request the padlock and a key.

She also

added that she did not explain to him the method of

locking the door or that it was necessary that he put up

a deposit in order to obtain the padlock.

She stated at this point that she had been

somewhat unnerved when she first looked at this man, at

which time he had the unusual snile on his face, or

appeared to be "sneering" at her, and thereafter she made

a point of having as little to do with him as possible,

always. walking in front of hin and avoiding all

unnecessary conversation or dealings with him.

Mrs. BREWER was asked whether she now feels

that she could identify this man if she sees him again.

She stated that she thought she might be able to identify

this man if she sees him again. She stated the man used

no slang or unusual expressions and she could not associate

his accent with any particular area, adding he had no

particular accent.

she also stated that she is positive she has

never seen this man bafore.

She pointed out that she has

only been handling the rental of the rooms at this

rooming house since March 12, 1968, horever, and she

would have no way of knowing whather he stayed at this

rooming house prior to that time.

She®

stated that at the time she became the

landlady at this rooming house, Roon 5 '8 was occupied

by an olderly man by the name of COMMODORE STEWART.

This man was ill as of March 12, 1968, and she believed

that it was on march 12, 1968,

Mempais nospital. A couple of days later, probably on

either March 13 or 14, 1968, this man died. The room

had not been rented fron that time until the time the

stranger using the name of JOHN WILLARD rented this room.

, She, understands that a number of different

persons have acted in the capacity of rental agent for

this rooming house in recent nonths, including Mr.

• :

WYATT MADDOX, who is now a clerk at

the Tri-State Hotel

located nearby, Mr. MADDOX never having lived in this

rooming house, however, and apparently having acted as

rental agent for only a short period of time. Another

Individual who handled the rental of rooms in this

rooming house was H. R. THOMPSOY, COMMINEN

My who never lived in the rooming house.

One other rental agent at this rooning house prior to

the time Mrs. BREWER assured these duties was w. V.

SAMiONS, who she understands is nos at the madison hotel

in Memphis., She 1s sure that Mr. Salyons was the rental

agent in January 1968, based on copies of receipts in

her receipt book. She recalled that Mr. SAMHONS stabbed .

his wife while he was rental agent at this rooming house

and the matter received publicity.

Mrs. BREHER advised that most of the occupants

of rooms in this rooming house are more or less permanent

tenants, although she does occasionally rent a vacant'

room to

transients for only one night...

MrS. BREWER advised that there are 10 separate

apartments or rooms in the south wing of this "rooming

house and six separate apartments or roons in the north

wing.

The six rooms in the north wing are referred to as

I-B, 2-B, otc., whereas the rooms in the south wing have

Sometime in December, 1966,

SPAIN returned it to his residence in Birmingham, Alabama.

In the Spring of 1967, SPAIN gave the gun to his

father in partial payment of a debt he owed to his father.

SPAIN was later told by his father that he had sold the

gun after placing a want ad for it in a Birmingham newspaper.

SPAIN was not present when his father sold the gun and

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Date

WALTER LEON SPAIN,

Birminghaw,

Alabama, furnished the following:

In the Spring of 1967, SPAll's son, WALTER E. SPAIN;

gave st: SPAIN a .38 caliber Liberty snub-nose revolver,

which his son had purchased in late 1966 or early 1967 from

a gun dealer near Atlanta, Georgia.

His son owed hir. SPAIN

some money and the gun was a partial payment of this debt.

In the fall of 1967, after having been hospitalized

in August, 1967, at Huntsville, Alabama, for an illness and

being in

need of money to pay bills, ur. SPAIN sold many

personal items by means of placing want ads for these items

in the "Birmingham News."

Among the items sold was the .38

caliber Liberty snub-nose revolver.

ME. SPAIN recalled he

placed an ad for this gun in a sunday paper, and that same

Sunday he received a call from a man who asked about the gun,

the price, and the directions to get to SPAIN's residence.

The caller said he was in the western section of Birmingham.

About an hour after this call, and while SPAIN's wife and

daughter were at church, & man came to the front door and

said he had called about the gun. He looked at the gun,

stated he had been looking for a gun of the same type,

and

when told again that the price was $65.00, he gave SPAIN

two twenty dollar bills, two ten dollar bills, and a five

dollar bill, after saying he would take it.

SPAIN did not

give the man a receipt for the money, nor did he record his

nane or see any identification of the man, and he did not

obtain any information as to his rame.

The man left carry.ag

the gun in his hand. SPAIN furnished neither ammunition nor

any papers for the gun.

When the man first arrived, SPAIN observed he had

any further attention to the car.

SPAIN did recall the

buyer saying he lived in the western section of Birmingham,

The tuyer said he wanted the

gun to keep around his house.

Mr. SPAIN described the buyer as a whito male, about forty

to forty-five years of age, 5'8" or 5'9" tall, 170 to 175

pounds, dark dair slightly graying at the temples, with

local

Alabama,

accent.

The man was wearing a sport shirt

and slacks, colors unrecalled, and he did not have glasses.

Mr. SPAIN was shown five different photographs

Of JANES EARL RAY, and he chose one which had been taken in

California during January or February, 1968, as "resembling

the man" who bought the revolver; however, Mr. SPAIN would

not make a definite identification of the

photograph of RAY

as the buyer.

Mr. SPAIN recalled he was contacted by FBI Agents

• on April ?, 1968, and shown an artist's conception of an

individual

the FBI was attempting to locate.

At that time,

he advised Agents the drawing reminded him of someone he may

have seen previously, but was unable to furnish any other

identifying information. After viewing the photographs of

JAIS EARL RAY and being questioned about the sale of the

revolver, SPAIN said he was now able to connect the sale

of the revolver with the drawing in that the person depicted *

in the drawing reminded SPAIN of the person to whom he had

sold the revolver.

Dear Senator Eastland;

I read in the local newspaper where your committee is considering

investagating the Dr. King case. I would like to inform you and the

committed that I would cooperate in any such hearing. However, at

the time I am going to attempt to get the guilty plea set aside, I know

that the odds against having this done are greatly against me. But I

think due to the unusual circumstances in the guilty plea it mite be

possible. I personaly did not shoot Dr. King but I believe I am partly

responsible for his death. I will briefly attempt to explain why I

entered the guilty plea. At the time Mr. Pery Foreman aggred to

take over the defense from Mr. Arthur Hanes we had a verbal

agreement that their would be no guilty plea, as I wanted to try the

case in court. I had every reason to believe during the first two

months Mr. Foreman was on the case their would be a trial, during

that period Mr. Foreman had me sign a new contract with him and .

Mr. Huie giving Mr. Foreman all the money from any of Mr. Huie's

money making ventures. ( had sign another contract with Mr. Huie

and Mr. Hanes) Shortly after this Mr. Foreman came to visit me

and he had a picture for me to look at.

This picture was about

.8 x 10 in. Ms. Foreman said Mr. Huie had given him the picture

and that Mr. Hule had got the picture from someone in the federal

government.

• The picture contain 2 or & men followed by two or

policemen. Mr. Foreman described on of the men in the picture -

as an 'anti cornmunist cuban refugee who was arrested at the time

president Kennedy was shot. The arrest took place in Dallas I was

told" I was asked il I would identify the man if he was brought to

Memphis. I said no, althoe he did look similar to the person I was .:

• Involved with. Alter I wouldn't identify this man, about all I was told

was that I would go to the electric chair iT I went to trial. I was even

told my family wanted me to plead guilty, but I found out this was not

50.

But I did not plead guilty for the above reasons. I did so because

I did not want to go to trial with a lawyer who thought he was going to

lose. I believe if you think you will lose you proably will. On the day

before I plead guilty I signed another contract with Mr. Foreman. In

this one I agreed to give him $165, 000, he agreed to give my brother

=$500. 00 in the event I wanted to hire another lawyer to reopen the

case. Mr. Foreman wrote into the contract that if I embarres him

(disagreed) in the court room he could withdraw, the old contract •

'would go into effect and I would be without funds to hire another

Sic-78 -

attorney. Getting back to Mr. Huie for a minute, while Mr. Hanes

was my attorney Mr. Huie asked me through him about public figures

and various organizations. I got the impression that he thought their

was a conspiracy but he wanted to name the conspirators. And

sometime

felt that my attorneys were working for him instead of

for me. In closing I would like to say if I can't get the case reopen,

their should be an invegestion, as I have signed over $200, 000 to

attorneys and not 1/20 of the witnesses have been interview. No one

went to los Angeles of New Orleans where I think much of the

evidence lies. Mr. Foreman said in open court that he didn't

trust investigators, and the one Mr. Hanes hired never left Memphis.

I would also like to say that despite what the papers and book writer's

quote me as saying, I have no intention of discussing this case with

anyone 'verbaly' until it is closed. Il I have anything to say I will

say it in court or to lawyers, or in letter form like this letter.

Sincerely, James E. Ray.
