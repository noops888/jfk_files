It should be noted that

Mr. Fensterwald in 1971 - 1912 was actually shown, by,

Mr. Houston during a visit to the Agency, two of the

twelve photographs, other than the one already published

in the warren Commissior report.

(It is these two that

he has published in

which Mr. Belin attaches to his memorandum.)

It.seems to.me that whoever makes a decision on

also be made,

i.e., whether to crop

that there are still sensitive aspects deriving from the

fact that the operation which produced

the photographs

was jointly fin with Mexican liaison

and as a consequence

publication at this time would create additional problems

at that level in Mexico. Also, it should be noted that

the Ambassador,

according to Win Scott's memorandum to

J.C. King on 22. November 1963 (see Item 8 in the bäckup

documentation)", allegedly played a direct role in the

decision to put the photographs into the hands of the FBI

in Dallas laterally from the Field.

As far as I know,

there has not been anything published about this aspect

at any time in the past nor have we had any discussions

with the State Department about that aspect of the matter.

CIA and Mexican security authorities against the Soviet and Cuban

3. Under the extraordinary press of effort to develop infonnation

i on the assassin and the assassination, copies of the photograph were

made avallable by ClA's Mexico Station Chief on the afternoon of

22 November to the local

FBI representative, and later that day,

assertedly on the decision. of the Ambassador, copies were conveyed by

an FBI representative by a special flight. carried out by the U.S. Naval

Attaché to the Dallas office of the FBI for possible use in the ongoing

Investigation.. One photograph, cropped by the fBI, was shown to

Mrs. Marguérite OSWALD (Lee Harvey OSWALD's mother) in Dallas on the

evening of 23 November 1963 by FBI Agent Bardwell D. ODUM.

• 4. The Warren Commission's report describes the sequence of events

at pp. 364-365 and 667 (Attachment B) which ultimately resulted in

Mrs. Marguerite OSWALD's allegation that she had been shown a cropped

photo of Jack RUBY the day before he murdered her son. (A further

complication

compounding this erroneous conclusion was the fact that

when she had been shown a copy of the same photograph in her appearance

before the Conmission, it had been cropped by the FBI in Washington in

a slightly different manner.)

Lee Harvey OSWALD - Reporting on Mexico City Stay

6. Although in no way related to Lee Marvey Oskilo or his stay in

Mexico City from the morning of 27 September 1963 to the mörning of

2 October 1963, at least one set of photographs of the unidentified man

criginated during OSWALD's stuy there. It is importana, therefore, to

an understanding of the acquisition and handling of the photographs by

the Mexico Station to review what the Station ascertained and did with

the information it developed about OSWALO in Mexico City, together with

Headquarters action on that information.

7. From all credible evidence known to this time (none, incidentally,

added since the exhaustively unique work of the Warren (ormission),

Lee Harvey OSWALD spent four (4) full days and tiro (21 partial days--

about 116 hours in all--in Mexico City from about 10:00 a.m. 27 September

small cormercial traveler hotel, not frequented by "gringos"--the

Hotel Commercia-where he was registered under allas. Exhaustive and

détailed interviens and interrajition by the Mexican authorities and-

the Fbi, after the assassination, established that in the recollection of

all hotel personnel he left early and returned late each day of his stay.

8. Assuming, and allowing for the fact of late arrival and early

departure, that he slept one-third of the time of his stay (38 or 39

hours), there remain some 78 hours of activity to be accounted for.

Overall, ClA's inforimation.can account solely for very brief periods

during 27, 23 September and 1 October. All coverage by CIA during the

entire period was technical.. The Station had no live source (living

agent) coverage either unilateral or from Mexican liaison..

9. It should be noted that OSWALD was in no sense "under investi-

gation." lone of the facts. of his defection and stay in the USSR and

return to the U.S., 1959 - 1962, were known to Mexico Station files.

§ October which had forwarded, on a routine basts, what appeared to be

a contact by an American for a visa to Cuba in transit to the USSR. This

was indicated and deduced from technically acquired information on

I October, which was the first and only occasion in which OSWALD

identified himself (partially) by true name.

10. At no time during his stay in Murico City did the ClA acquire

a photo of Osbaca. A careful revier at all coverage, voice intercept,

as well as photoraphic, of both the seviet and Cuban Embassles was

conducted by che Station on 22 and 23 November 1963 after the assassina-

tion, going back to materials from August 1963. It is, therefore, firm

that there was no ClA photo coverage of OSWALD at any time during

his.

Mexico trip or stay in Mexico City. Moreover, although it had made a

cabled request on 15 October, the Mexico Station had no photo of OSWALD

in its records, nor did it receive one from Headquarters--which did not

have one either--before 22 lovember 1963.

cept--which had been reported to Headquarters and disseminated to the

interested members of the intelligence community (as an ex-Marine OSWALD

was a Navy and F8l case under the Delimitations Agreement, and potentially

of interest to the Department of State)--turned up matches based on

content with materials intercepted on 27 and 28 Septenber 1963. These

matches were reported to Headquarters on 23 November 1963. Analysis

básed on voice comparison. (except for what could be recalled by the

monitor--and this was not an insignificant element because of the

memorably poor Russian spoke by OSWALD) could not be made because the

tapes, in accordance with the normal practice, had been erased and re-used.

coverage was nut (and normally le not) processed in "real time." The

means of acquisition and the volune of the Information precludes anything

but the spot reporting of Item, judged by the monitor to be of more than

ordinary interest and, therefore, noted in surmary logs. Full texis of

selected items require consultation of the tape and either a full tran-

scription or full translation ur both.

Photo.coverage tends to become

available in quantity lots whitch requires scanning and selection on a

rapid and accelerated basis in four or five day "peaks." One of the

"triggers" that normally operates to focus and accelerate more speedy

review and reporting of this kind of raw intelligence is the mention of

a name. This wäs precisely what occurred in the second of two conversa-

tions on l October with the Surfet Embassy, during which the speaker said

he was "Lee OSWALD." It was this information reported by the Station to

Headquarter's in its first indication on OSWALD on 8 October 1963.

13. The Mexico Station did one more thing In its 8 October report

on Lee OSWALD based on it's 1 October voice intercepts: it coupled the

data with descriptive information it had acquired from a sensitive

• collateral source--a photograph of a male individual, apparently an

American, who was observed entering the Soviet Embassy on 1 October.

The Station reported this detail on the 8th as a matter of coincident

fact. The Station did not assert or suggest that the data deduced from

the photo was in fact OSWALD, or indeed, was in any way related to OSWALD.

Lee Harvey OSWALD - CIA Coverage of His Mexico City Stay

14. One additional element of background must be stipulated now as

the final precondition to understanding the relevance (or irrelevance)

of the photo of the unknoum individual placed in the chain of evidence

on 23 November in Dallas by FBI Ayent Bardwell OOUM: what was the

totality of ClA Mexico's coverage of OSWALD's activity as of the after-

noon of the 23rd when all available coverage had been checked?

15. The totality of Mexico Station coverage on, or reasonably

inferable to be OSWALD, consisted of five (5) voice intercepts as follows:

the Cubans (Embassy) would also give him a visa without further

paper work, only advising Immigration in Cuba. The American, she

says, wants to know with whom he had talked there because he says

he was told there would be no problem. The man in the Soviet

the Sovtet Entessy received many calls pertaining to visa matters:

On the 27th at 1037 tours the Soviet Embassy received a call from

He was told the consul was not in and to call back at 1130.

OSWALD is known to have arrived at the Flecha Roja bus terminal on bus

#516 at circa 1000 hours on the 27th.

It was, therefore, possible for

him to have made this call.

Soviet gives him the number and tells him to ask for the Consul of the

Soviet Embassy in Mexico.

The relevance of this intercept to OSWALD is excludable on three

grounds:

The use of broken Spanish.

OSWALD throughout used broken

Russian or English.

-He had no competance in Spanish to handle a

conversation of this kind.

The substance of the request indicates a visa request in

the first stages of initiation.

OSWALD had developed his matter

with the cubans and the Soviets the previous Saturday to a point

well beyond the stage indicated by the substance of this call.

(It 1s known that OSWALD reserved space this date on a Mexico City-

Loredo bus, departing 2 October 1963 at 0830 hours.)

c. 1 October 1963 (Tuesday). OSHALD made at least two calls,

at 1031 and 1045. hours, to the Soviet Embassy. He identified himself

twice during the second call when he talked with OBYEDKOV--a guard-..

and referred to his talk on Saturday, probably with KOSTIKOV. There

was no photographic coverage of OSWALD on 1 October; if the follow-

ing reasoning is correct, that was as it should be. From the context

of the two calls, there would have been no. reason

for him to go to

the Embassy, His case had clearly been placed at the sufferance of

the USSR Embassy in Washington. His two calls on 1 October were

concerned with whether any reply had been received from Washington.

Under. those circumstances, it is unreasonable to believe OSWALD

would have gone to-the Sovtet Embassy or that date.

18. The camera at about mid-day registered the entry into the

Sovtet Embassy of a white-shirted individual who, in the opinion of the

c. OSWALD had left Mexico City, based on all the credible

evidence, the early morning of the previous day, 2 October, and

could not have made this local call.

only person--a ren-latin. and possibly in American--who entered the Soviet

installation. Un the chance there could do an association between the

identification daia derived fron the voice intercept und the descriptive

It is believed that OSkiLD may be identical

a. OSWALD':, middle name was misgiven: "Herry" for Haryey.

The reason for

this mistake is simplicity itself. The sheer openiny

the file on OSWALD on 9 Decender 1960 had been erroneously inscrited

"CSWALD, Lee Henry." That sheet--unchanged except for the notation of

the error--is still the first sheet in the OSWALD file.

b. His wife's maiden name was misspelled: "PUSAKOVA" for INSAKOVA.

Neither of these errors are significant (though they persist in the

Headquarters communications throughout the month). More important was:

c. Paragraph (2) of the Mexico Station's: report, which dealt with

a concurrent, but separate, pheriomenon, the description

of an individual

observed going into and out of the Soviet Embassy, had been locked on to

Lee OSWALD as an alleged descriptive fact. The Station's qualification,

"appeared to be an American," was transformed in the flat designation of

the unidentified individual as "The American."

There can be no question that this misreading of the Mexico Station report

was an

analyst's error

which escaped detection in the coordination before

release:

the descriptive details attributed to OSWALD were so far off the

mark as to be inmediately recognizable as such by the recipients in Head-

quarters, among whom both the Navy and FBI had

photos of OSWALD. (In partial

explanation, if not exculpation, be it recalled that as of that moment CIA

had no photograph of OSWALD in Headquarters or in Mexico City to refer to.)

23. Confirmation of this judgment is provided by the contents of

the cable composed

by the same analyst and sent as of 2209Z time (two

hours later) to Mexico Station, referencing its & October cable:

possibly in connection with the assassination, and referenced its

earlier messages of 8-9 and 15 October and Headquarters' reply of

10 October. The Station requested by:

"priority pouch a photo of OSWALD so that Station

can check all recent coverage for OSWALD. Forward-

•ing soonest coptes of only visitor tö Sortet Embassy

on 1 October who could be identical with OSWALD."

28.

It is clear that Mexico Station had forgotten that according

to it's own communication the unidentified male in the photo was of

"apparent age 35" and that the accurate description of OSWALD forwarded

by Headquarters on 10 October precluded the identity with OSWALD of the

person whom they regarded as the "only visitor to the soviet Embassy on

l October who could be identical."

29. The Station meanwhile had begun an exhaustive and accelerated

review of all its technical and photographic intelligence, A dispatch.

was prepared in accordance with the indication given

In the cable of

22 November, cited in paragraph 25 above. The dispatch noted that

photo coverage of the unidentified individual had turned up on 4 and

15 October at the Sortet and Cuban Embassies, respectively. The text

of the 22 November 1963 pouched dispatch read:

as a postscript. That fact was reported simultaneously by cable to

31. Headquarters, at 0136Z time, 23 November 1963, asked Mexico

telephone with the Western Hemisphere Chief of Division, Mr. J. C. KING,

and secured fermission to give copies of the photographs of the uniden-

Chief of. Station to the WHi Division Chief, mailed to the latter from

Dallas, together with copies of the photographs, by the Legal Attaches

representative who delivered then to the FBI in that city.

The decision to remit the phutographs to the Fel in Dallas

had been made by the Ambassador, according to the Chief of Station, who

simultaneously: with the FBI agent's departure reported to redquarters

by cable (0244Z time, 23 November):

"FBI agent left here 2000 local time with two copies

each of six photos of a person suspected to be

35. Headquarters responded two hours later, 04227 time,

23 November 1963, cancelling its request:

"I. No need send staffer with photos. We have

asked Navy for photos again, but Mexico can see

OSWALD's picture soonest on

36. On the 23rd at 1729Z time, Headquarters advised Mexico City:

"The FBI says that the photos of the man

entering the Soviet Embassy which Mexico

Station,sent to Dallas were not of Lee OSWALD.

Presúme Mexico Station has double-checked

ubriated--in a aux the more possession of a correct physical description

Mexico City as an impressionistic selection of the photograph on

there been a cause celebre with less intrinsic merit. It Is equally

clear fron the forts themselves that there was nothing contrived or

conspired in what happened, unless we have now descended to that point

The Genes is and Bevelgent of Odum Exhibit No. i and

1963 showed one of the six photos flown up

• from Mexico City the previous

day to OSWALD's sother, Marguerite OSWALD. ODUM himself had trimmed off

the background by straight cuts. Mrs. OSWALD had no recognition of the

image in the photograph. ODUM's own detailed account may be found in

Hearings, op cit. Vor. XX, p. 268.

43. At this point, for the record, the total available photo

coverage of the unidentified individual numbers twelve (12) photographs:

a. Five (5) taken en 1 October 1963, entering and exiting the

Soviet Embassy. "He is garter

in a white shirt and

light-colored

(khaki-?) trousers.

•b. Five (5) taken on 1 October 1963 in front of the Sortet

c. Two (2) taken on 15 October 1963 in front of the Cuban

Embassy. He is wearing a dark, collarless T-shirt or light sweater.

The negatives.of all of these are extent and are now held in Headquarters

as integral parts of. the OSWALD and related file holdings.

44. The result of ODUM's display of the photograph--to repeat, à

cropped version of one of those noted under paragraph 43b, above--was

Mrs. Marguerite OSWALD's allegation that she had been shown a picture of

her son's killer, Jack RUBY, a day before he perpetuated the deed! Again

the Warren Conmission Report (pp. 364-365, 367) exhaustively disposes

of this erroneous charge and requires no repetition here. A complica-

ting fact developed along the may was Mrs. OSWALD's (correct) observation,

when she firally admitted before the cormission that the ODUM photograph

was not RUBY, was that the photo had been cropped differently from the

one she had been stion in Dallas, Inspector MALLEY's cropped verston of

the ODUM photograph'became Conmission Exhibtt 237 (see Hearings,

Vol. XVI, р. 638)..

45. The net effect of the develements in the hearings of the

Commission was to require the admissior. of the cropped photograph into

evidence In a chain of depositions beginning with ODuM, including the

FBI Inspector, James R. MALLEY (who had trimmed the photograph used by

the Commission in Washington), and Richard HELMS, who deposed for the.

originator. These docunients speak for themselves and will be found in

the Hearings, Vol. XI, pp. 468-470.

46. Mexico Station and other senior Agency officers strongly.

advised against the publication of the photograph in any form on the

grounds that the Soviets would be imediately alerted to the existence

of a useful and continuing U.S, intelligence operation, and the opera-

tion would go down the drain. There were repeated cables exchanged on

this point between Headquarters and Mexico Station during

the summer

of 1964, in particular fran 23 Septerber to 15 October 1964 when the

Station had plans underway to abandon the operation.

47. In acceding to the Commission's request for a deposition,

Mr. RANKIN by memorandum of 23 June 1964 which included

additional observation:

the follaring

"The Central Intelligence Agency recommends that

this photograph not de reproduced in the Commis -

-ston's report because it would jeopardize a most

confidential and productive operation. In

addition, it could be erbarrassing to the indivi

dual Involved who as far as the Agency is aware

had no connection with Lee Harvey OSWALD or the

assassination of President KENNEDY." •

48. In this instance the needs of the Commission prevailed over

the DCI's statutory obligation to protect sources and methods. The

"Unidentified Individual" remains to this day untdentified and there is

no credible evidence up to this time to rebut the assertion made by

Mr. HELMS in the concluding senterce-of his memorandura. to RANKIN RANKIN on

23 June 1964. And

the operation did, as predicted, go down the drain.

Within a week of the public appearance of the Odum Exhibit No. I and

Commission Exhibit 237, members of the Soviet Embassy began systematic

efforts

to survey the surrcunding buildings, ostensibly for rental

space, but clearly their inquiries were directed to spotting possible

camera sites. The operation was continued in any case. Within a year

it had become almost totally unproductive in coverage on Americans in

contact with the Embassy--a clear sign that this category of visitor

was being warned

away by the Soriets themselves.

considerable correspondence has accumulated since the end of 1964 1n

which the Agency has

attempted to be responsive to these requests and.

simultaneously, has tried to satisfy what has been its sole interest

from the inception of the matter: to protect the method of acquisition

of the photograph and the foreign liaison relationship which made the

acquisition possible.

50. Following are highlights from the correspondence during the

current phase.

a. On 16 May 1967, over the signature of the General Counsel

of the Agency, Lawrence R. HOUSTON, CIA voluntarily submitted a

statement about the photograph to Judge. BAGERT of the Criminal

District Court for the Parish of Orleans, State of Louistana.

The response dealt affirmatively with the contents of the subpoena

that nad, been delivered to the United States Marshall in the District

of Columbia, despite the fact that the subpoena could not be

executed because of the lack of jurisdiction.

Mr. HOUSTON proferred on Agency behalf categoric assur-

ances

to the court regarding the inaccuracy of statements and

inferences made by Mr. escrisai in New Orleans about the photograph

of the unidentified incittlesi. The following is extracted from

Mr. HOUSTON's memorandu. .

"Because of the publicity which has

surrounded the

Orleans Parish Grand Jury proceedings, he have ..

récently carried it an exhaustive search of the

files of the Central Intelligence Agency for any

picture of Lee harver USWALD taken in Mexico. As

a result of this search, I can state categorically

that the files of this Agency do not contain, and

never have contained, any such picture of

Lee Harvey OSWALD taien in Mexico and that we have

no information whatscever that any such photograph

ever existed.. To the best of our knowledge änd

information, therefore, there is no such photograph.

Furthermore, the pesograph which is printed in the

Warren Carmission dezert, Exhibit No. 237 in Volume

XVI, never

containel more than one figure, and the

figure in the photagraph depicts an individual who,

to our knowledge, bas not been identified. The

circumstances of tha filing of this photograph with

the Warren Commission are set forth in affidavits

on pages 468 and zer of Volume XI, Hearings Before

the President's immission on the Assassination of

President Kennedy. Consequently, we have no record

of any photograph that answers

in any way the

description of the one we understand was requested

in the

subpoena.

"I hope you will accept this information in this

form in the spirit of cooperation in which

it is

proferred."

The Agency has repeatedly serviced requests about the

identify of the unknown individual fran Mr. Emory L. BROWN, Jr.,

Route #4, Box :82, Squankum Road, Farmingdale, New Jersey. The last

exchange of correspondence in our record covered the period

4 - 17 April 1970.

c. Detailed inquiries on the unidentified individual were

received on 1 and 24 November 1971, to which the Agency responded

on. 15_November and 14 December, respectively, from

Mr. Paul L. HOCH, 1735 Highland Place #2, Berkeley, California.

d. The most extensive effort to pursue the unidentified

individual was and is being made by Bernard FENSTERWALD, Jr., who

is now Executive Director of a Conmittee to Investigate Assassina-

tions, 927 55th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C., beginning on

22 March 1971, shortly after the Ayency declassified Commission

FBI's declussification of Commission Docurent No. 556. On & April

1971. Mr. FENSTERWALO was invited do the Agency for a discussion

with the General Counsel, Mr. HOUSTON, of his question about the

photograph of the

unknown individual. Tro other photographs of

the unidentified individual, in adition to the photograph

depicted in the two Carmission exhibits, were shown to him"at that

tine. It is a matter of more than ordinary interest to note that

on this occasion Mr: FENSTERWALD, who was accompanied by his

partner, Mr. William OHLHAUSEN, told Mr. HOUSTON and another

representative of the Agency in attendance that he knew who the.

unidentified man was. The folling is extracted from MF.. HOUSTON'S

Memorandum of Record, 8 April 1971:

"3. Mr.. FENSTERWALD came to my office this

morning with his partner, William G. OHHAUSEN,

looked at the other photographs, and told us he

did know who the man was. He said he is presently

serving a prison term somewhere in the United

States and admitted that he had knehn OSWALD, but

Mr. FENSTERWALD said there was nothing to indicate

any connection between the man in the photographs

and the assassination of President KENNEDY.

Mr. FENSTERWALD did not give us the man's name at

this time, as he said enough people had suffered

unnecessarily from allegations that they were

associated with the assassination, but he did

say he was sure we had a file

on the man. He

asked if he could have the photographs, and l

asked how he could use them. He said he did

not know and finally agreed

that for the time

being he would not press his request. :..

The whole meeting was extremely friendly and

they thanked. us for our response."

The following is extracted from the Memorandum of Record

by the other CIA man present, Mr. Arthur E. DOOLEY.

"Mr. tENSTERWALD sald he knew who the person

was

and had spoken to him; that the man was too.

nervous to come forth on his own. FENSTERWALD

would not give the man's name but said he is an

American, serving a prison term in this country

on

a criminal charge, and that he had met OSWALD

in Mexico.

I asked whether the prisoner had any

conspiratortal relationship with OSWALD.

FENSTERWALD

replied he did not know the answer

as he had not interrtewed the man as yet. We

reiterated that we did not know who the man

was, and said that we would like to know his

Identity: FENSTERWALD replied that ClA has a

the unknown man. and that we will

."

Me. FENSTERWALD made no reference in his subsequent

conversations and correspondence to this allegation about the identity

of the "Unidentified Individual," though the claim, if true, would

be of direct evidential Interest and possibly permit us to assert

with finality what we belleve has been the fact from the beginning:

the "Unidentified Man" has nothing

to do wich the OSWALD case at all.

Deit Mr. Knoche:

As YOu know, Led Harvey Oswald was in Mexico City in

into Septenbae and early October, 1963.

Shortly after

he left Mexico City a photograph vas taken of an American

male and a question was raised whether or not this

male was

Ice Harvey Oswald. The CIA and the Warren Cornission both

determined that the picturo was not of lee Harvey Oswald

aud that the picturo was takon after Oswald left Mexico

City.

Although portions of this rocord have boen rolessed to the

other portions have romalned classified because

oi conccins by

the CIA it tho time that a rolcase of the

full picture might disclose sources and methods which the

C'IN felt were not in the national interest to disclose at

that time.

In light of the false allegations about the

assassination of President konnady and the false allogations

of CIA involvement, I feel that it would be appropriate to

reconsider whether or not the ortire matter can be fully

disclosed at this tino.

I rould like to recoiva by April 22 a full toport from

the Cil on this

entird matter.

sincerely yours,
