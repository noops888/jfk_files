Dear Mr. Bensinger:

This letter serves to confirm the understanding

reached during our telephone conversation of June 22,

1978 regarding the utilization of Staff Investigator

Harold Leap with respect to a matter of concern to the

investigation by this Committee into the assassination

of DI. Martin Luther King, Jr.

Specifically, it is the

present intention of the Committee to assign Mr. Leap

to matters relating to the 1967 federal narcotic inves-

tigation of John Kauffmann and others.

In so doing, the

Committee intends to draw upon his expertise as an agent

who worked on that investigation which in fact led to

the conviction of John Kauffman and several others.

The matter of current concern to the Committee relating

to Kauffmann and his

associates does not represent in

any way a Committee inquiry into DEA, its predecessor

federal narcotic agency (BNDD), or any of its past or

present agents or employees.

Reference is made to our initial agreement captioned

the "Interagency Agreement Between the Drug Enforcement

Administration (DEA) and the Select Committee on Assassi-

nations, U.S. House of Representatives" as well as to the

October

31, 1978 amendment of that Agreement.

It is re-

quested that the understanding reflected by this letter

be incorporated into the original Agreement. If you so

approve, please indicate by signing below and returning

the original of this letter to us.
