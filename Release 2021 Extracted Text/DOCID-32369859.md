MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT : Willard Galbraith

1. Barney Hidalgo, when interviewed yesterday,

raised the possibility that the composite sketch shown

him by HSCA representatives as "Maurice Bishop" may have

looked somewhat like a tormer chief of his,

Willard

Galbraith. Hidalgo believes that Galbraith is now

deceased.

2. The Office of Personnel file on Galbraith shows

his date of birth as 1906.

He was an FSO from 1929

until he joined CIA in 1952. He retired from CIA in

February 1962.

3. During the period that Galbraith might have

been involved in anything--if he was--associated with

Cuban operations, etc., his assignments show as having

been in Nicaragua from

1957 to 1959, and Puerto Rico

from 1959 until he retired in February 1962. He appears

to have retired to Los Angeles, the address from which

his early retirement letters originated.

4. While the OPF did not contain a photograph of

Mr. Galbraith he is not likely to have been engaged in

whatever activities

a man using the name of Maurice Bishop

is alleged to have been in during 1963.
