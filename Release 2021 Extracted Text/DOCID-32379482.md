about the organization, to dissuade persons iron coming to

Miami, Florida, to join the organization, and to eliminate

persons who did not have specialized training or background

for this type of activity.

HEMMING said that this form

letter sets up a nunber of conditions that most people

making inquiry would not be able to meet and, therefore,

tended to stop people from coming to Florida to join his

organization.

HEMMING said that if a person met all these

requirements, he would then write to HEMMING again and in

reply HEMMING would invite the individual to cose to Florida

on vacation and if he had the talent and ability, he would

be invited to stay in Miani sni participate in survival

training in the Florida Evergiades.

HEMMING clained he did not consider the above

letter in any way an instrument of recruiting or any

attempt to defraud or use the mails for defraud.
