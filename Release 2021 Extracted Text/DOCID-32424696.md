PROGRESS ACHIEVED DURING APRIL. IN IMPEDING TRAVEL TO CUBA

1. The Department of State has:

a. Participäted in the drafting of a resolution passed at

the 3-4 April Managua Meeting respecting discouragement of

travel of Latin Americans to Cuba for training in subversion.

The text of the resolution is appended hereto.

b. Headed an Interdepartmental team currently visiting

the

Isthmian capitals whith the objective of securing the fullest

and quickest implementation of all the recommendations agreed

on at Managua.

Prior to the departure of the team, Department

of State posts were instructed to inform the host governments

of the trip and to encourage them to identify the kinds and

extent of technical assistance it would be most useful for the

United States to furnish.

c. Caused to be noted In U.S. passports since 1 April

that they are not valid for travel to Cuba.

d. Following an indication that the Bolivian Goverrment

might be willing to increase efforts to impede travel of 1ts

nationals to Cuba, Instructed the U.S. Embassy to recommend

that the GOB:

1) Ban travel to Cuba by Bolivian nationals except.

for official or special purposes approved by the GOB;

and establish legal penalties for violations;

2) Require Bollvian citizens to have a passport or

other GOB document to travel abroad;

3) Make such document invalid for travel to Cuba unless

specially endorsed;

4) Seek arrangements with third countries which are

important transit points under which third countries w1ll

assist the GOB In preventing unauthorized travel by Bolivians

and will help identify violators.

5) Drawing on the recommendation in the paper on "The

Movement of Subversives and Subversive Trainees' and other

sources, instructed the non-isthman posts to encourage host

governments to take additional counter-subversion steps.

Each instruction was tailored to the local situation 1n

the recipient country and Included appropriate suggestions

as to strategy which might be used in securing implementation

of the desired actions.

6) Requested posts in Latin America to encourage host

governments to take appropriate measures to discourage

participation of their nationals In Cuba's May Day cele-

bration and to prevent charter flights from their country

to Cuba for the celebration.

7) Through efforts with various Latin American and other

governments, discouraged participation in the Cuban solld-

arity Congress. U.S. efforts contributed to limiting the

success of the Congress from the Castro-Communist point of

view.

2. The Department of Defense has:

a. Continued the US sea and air surveillance of the

area surrounding Cuba unt1l 25 April 1963, at the same

rate and with the same emphasis as existed prior to that

date. Since 25 April 1963 additional sea surveillance

has been realized between Cuba and Haiti, due to the

stationing.of the Caribbean Ready Amphibious Squadron at

the entrance. of the Gulf of Gonaives occasioned by the

deterioration of internal conditions within Halt1.

Reports of

subversive movement, or suspected subversive

movement, obtained by US surveillance are available for

Immediate transmittal through the US military alerting

system.

b. Continued action, at high priority, on the Install-

ation of military communications facilities in Latin America.

As of 1 April, a commercial submarine cable from Florida

to Panama became operational. This cable gives reliable

voice and teletype communications to CINCARIB Including

both classified teletype and voice. Negotiations are

continuing in Honduras, Colombia and Ecuador for the

installation of military radio facilities. Installation

of a multi-channel radio station has been completed in

Costa Rica. A similar facility in Nicaragua 1s scheduled

for completion by 1 July 1963.

c. Established an Intelligence Center at CARIBCOM Head-

quarters, in connection with the program of surface

surveillance of the Caribbean, for rapid processing and

dissemination to countries concerned, via the American

Ambassadors, of intelligence on the movement of subversives.

Study of

the establishment of intelligence centers in the

Caribbean revealed that the Intelligence Center should be

established at Caribbean Command Headquarters and that a

center need not be established at Headquarters, Caribbean

Sea Frontier.

d. Established on 11 April a U.S. military alerting

system operated by CINCARIB and CINCLANT. Pursuant to the

request of the Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee on

Cuban Affairs the Department of Defense has suspended the use

of the Military Groups in the alerting system and 1s working

with CIA to reduce duplication of effort to à minimum:

e. Alerted U.S. forces, for the most part within the

Atlantic Command, to be prepared to provide U.S. assistance

upon request by the country concerned.

Currently, forces

arei assigned by the unified commander involved, to meet the

singular problem encountered. Preparations have been made

to respond to a possible requirement in the case of the

Venezuelan ship FERRYMAR III.

f. Ordered to the Canal Zone a Coast Guard Mobile

Training Team for a period of six months, beginning

15 May 1963, to provide training, In Spanish, In boat

handling and maintenance together with surveillance

techniques to those Central American countries having 40

foot Coast Guard Utility Boats. In addition, the Mobile

Training Team will assist as required in establishing a

permanent Small Craft Training and Inspection Facillty In

the Canal Zone. One 40 foot utility boat has been permanently

assigned to the U.S. Naval Station, Rodman, Canal Zone for

use by

the MTT and will be delivered there about 20 June.

3. The Central Intelligence Agency has:

a. Completed its efforts to Improve U.S. government

communications in Latin America by the installation of

the remainingütwo commercial leased circuits into

Guatemala City and Managua, and the stationing on a

permanent basis of 35 CIA radio operators in Latin

America in replacement of temporary duty personnel.

In

November 1962, CIA's active radio facilities 1n 20 Latin

American capitals were augmented with on-line crypto-

graphic facilities and temporary personnel to handle the

bulk of all U.s. government communications in the area

These facilities, known as Joint Communications Centers,

are now being operated by CIA on a 24-hour basis, as a

service to all U.S. government agencies. Latin American

1n October 1962 to 15,000,000 groups handled In March

1963.

b. Increased its efforts designed to control the move-

ment of persons; arms and propaganda materials to and

from Cuba.

A summary of actions by country is provided

below:

1) Argentina - Station, In conjunction with the

Embassy, has continued to press the Argentine govern-

ment to enact effective travel control legislation

and to adopt measures recommended by the Special

Security. Committee of the OAS. Information on

Argentines travelling to Cuba 1s being furnished to

the Argentine government by. the station. Several

potential travellers to Cuba have been spotted and

are being assessed by the station. Information from

three recent returnees from Cuba is being obtained

through debriefings. Station reports that because of

Increased Mexican controls, all truly clandestine

travel to Cuba from Argentina is now via Prague. Che

Guevara's mother was arrested on 23 April upon her

return to Argentina for importing Castro propaganda.

2) Bolivia - Station and Embassy have been urging

Bolivian government to adopt stricter travel controls,

without apparent results so far. Names of travellers

known

to have returned from Cuba are being furnidhed

to the Bolivian government. Thus far, no action 1s

known to have been taken by the Bolivian government on

the strength of such information. Station comments that

problem with Bolivia 1s not in lack of Information

available to government on Cuban subversion, but in

getting Bollula to do something about it.

3) Braz1l - Information on Brazilians who have

received subversive training in Cuba has been made

avallable to the Brazilian Foreign Office, through the

American Ambassador, and to the National SecurIty

Council through CIA liaison with the NSC's Security

Service.

An asset of the CIA station in Rio is in a position

to harass and delay Cuba-bound travellers in those

Instances where the Station is able to tip him off

regarding their destination. He can also harass

returnees when informed in advance.

The Station 1s

taking steps to get appropriate information to him

promptly.

4) Chile - Chilean Internal security authorities,

at urging of station, are trying to Impede and harass

travellers to and from Cuba. Government is now requiring

passport applicants to state destination, and passports

must be turned in after travel. The Foreign Minister

has stated much progress is being made, with cooperation

of the Mexican government, and that travel of Chileans to

Cuba has been dramatically reduced in recent weeks:

Station and Embassy are continuing pressure on Cuban

government in this regard. Names of travellers to Cuba

are being passed to the Ambassador, who furnishes them

to President Alessandri (who has asked that this collab-

oration be: kept secret), Information from CIA unilateral

operations against Cuban Embassy 1s being used by a newly

created Chilean surveillance team In checking out purpose

of travel projected and in following up on returnees from

Cuba.

leaders of the extreme militant left and is exploring

the possibilities of sending three station assets to

Cuba for training and intelligence missions. A Cuban

First Secretary was declared personal non grata during

April for using false identity documents, and the Cuban

charge d'affaires was subsequently recalled by his own

government.

5) Colombia - Chief of Customs has indicated to station

his willingness to institute an improved travel control

system.. One station asset expects to travel to Cuba

in the near future. Station believes it has identified

a courier operating between Colombia and Cuba and has

mounted an operation to uncover his Colombian contacts.

6) Costa Rica - Station reports little pro-Castro

activity during April. No recorded travel to or from

Cuba has taken place. Local authorities appear inclined

to cooperate in control program.

7) Dominican Republic - Efforts to get Juan Bosch to

take active steps against Communists and travellers

and from Cuba have been fruitless to date, as have been

efforts to establish a new and effective internal security

organization in the Dominican Republic, Bosch appears

to have lost his previously stated enthusiasm for such

subversive purposes, but present laws do not permit him

to impede travel via third countries.

He is exploring

possibilities of reprisals against citizens who return

from Cuba. He has checked a list of names and passport

numbers obtained by CIA from airline manifests in Mexico,

and reports that not one name or passport number corres

ponds with official Eucadoran records, indicating

the

possibillty of fabrication of passports by Cuba.

A recent Ecuadoran returnee from Cuba, recruited by

the station, lost his hand in testing a homemade bomb

made in accordance with instructions received in Cuba.

He made a public statement and wide publicity

was

arranged by the station and USIS. Plans are to keep

this

incident alive as proof of revolutionary training given

in Cuba for terrorist activity in Ecuador.

The station chief has accompanied the American

Ambassador on visits to the Ecuadoran Ministers of Defense

and Government to stress the threat. of Cuban backed

subversion.

Approximately 7,000 pounds of Communist propaganda

are being destroyed monthly as a result of

a unilateral

operation of the CIA Base in Guayaquil.

9) Halti - Station reports that several assets have

travelled to points outside Port-au-Prince in an effort

to learn of possible travel to and from Cuba.

Reports

from areas of Capt

Haltien, Port de Palx, and La Gonave

and

La Tortue Islands, were negative.

10) Honduras - The government has shown Ittle inclination

to tighten up on travel control.

known Honduran Communists have recently travelled to

Cuba. Information as to their identities is being fur-

nished to President Villeda through the U.s. Ambassador.

• 11) Mexico - A CIA source states the Cuban Embassy has

issued 10-15 visas during April on pieces of paper

separate from the passport, but the government's practice

of stamping all passports. to show travel to or from Cuba

has largely nullified this effort by travellers to avoid

the stigma of travel to Cuba. All Cubans arriving in

Mexico, whether in transit or otherwise must have Mexican

visas. This is not true of other nationalities, who need

no. Visa 1f In transit. The government continues

to

confiscate propaganda material from Cuba sporadically at

the airport. The government recently refused

visas to

five Cuban doctors who wished to attend a Urology Congress

In Mexico. Several station assets have recently travelled

to Cuba for intelligence purposes.

12) Panama = At the urging of station, the quardia

Nacional has been ordered to increase 1ts vigilance concern-

ing returnees from Cuba and to prevent them from establish-

Ing an effective organization. Several recent returnees

from Cuba are being debriefed regarding their training and

travelling to Cuba. Pertinent information from CIA

unilateral operations is being passed regularly to

cooperating Uruguayan officials. Station has a further

station. On the basis of information furnished to him,

he held up visa applications of Uruguayan Communist

travellers to abandon the Mexican route to Cuba and turn

to the longer and far more expensive route via Prague:

Information on past travel to Cuba by Uruguayans, furnished

by the station, was included in a study of Cuban sub-

version prepated by Uruguayan Military Intelligence

Service for the National Council of Government.

4. The U.S. Information Agency has:

a. Sent circular instructions to all USIS field posts

in Latin America advising each to stimulate publicity

in the local press and radio, to encourage identification

of Cuban trainees through personal-contact work with

students and labor, to

report promptly evidence of Cuban-
