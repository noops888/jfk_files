Philadelphia airtel 5/20/64 recommended that results

of interview with SUE NICHOLS be furnished to INS. At the

time recommendation was made the subject's paramour, JANE

SCHIANO has told her that

she cooperates he would limit the questions asked of hen

Pand

would ask only those questions approved by her attorney.

In general, the questions asked would concern her

relationship with subject but no specific questions would be

asked by INS concerning the exact nature of the intimacy

COLLINS fears widespread publicity if she invokes

the 5th Amendment at INS hearing and is willing to cooperate

with INS if the questions asked of her are restricted.

COLLINS does not want it known that she has

been an informant

â€¢for the FBI.

INS

expected to lay groundwork

spent by subject at COLLINS home at Lake Ariel, Pa.

It is not recommended that INS be furnished the

details of the interviews conducted with SUENICHOLS,
