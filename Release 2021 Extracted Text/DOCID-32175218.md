Date: August 2, 2021

From: National Archives and Records Administration

Subject: Reconstructed FBI File PD 62-3144, Serials 15-16

To: The File

This memorandum briefly summarizes the status of missing original Federal Bureau of

Investigation (FBI) case files in the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records

Collection (JFK Collection) and documents the National Archives and Records Administration's

(NARA) efforts to reconstruct these records, where possible, from duplicate copies of

documents located in other FBI files.

As the JFK Collection was first compiled and reviewed in the 1990s, the Assassination Records

Review Board and the FBI designated some records as "not believed relevant" (NBR) or "not

assassination related" (NAR). The FBI retained custody of the NBR/NAR records and

postponed their transfer to NARA until a later date. Every document or group of documents

("serials"), however, received an indexed Record Identification Form (RIF) and FBI inventory

sheet for insertion into the JFK Collection.

In September 2011, several years prior to the 2017 re-review and transfer of the NBR/NAR

material to the National Archives, a flood severely damaged thousands of feet of records at the

FBl's Alexandria Records Center in Alexandria, Virginia. In June 2012, NARA approved the

FBl's request for emergency destruction of 10,000 cubic feet of records that posed significant

airborne health hazards. Among the damaged records were FBI field office files that contained

postponed JFK Collection material designated as "pertaining to a matter unrelated to the JFK

Assassination Investigation" or "not assassination related."

This compilation represents NARA's efforts to reconstruct the original file, as completely as

possible, with duplicate copies of documents located in the FBI field office and headquarters

files within the JFK Collection. Each reconstructed file or compilation contains a Record

Identification Form, an explanatory cover memo, existing administrative documents available

within the JFK Collection, and copies of identified duplicate documents. The table below

summarizes the status of FBI file PD 62-3144, Serials 15 through 16.
