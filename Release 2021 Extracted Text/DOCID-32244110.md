The Honorable

Thomas N. Downing

Dear Tom:

Attached is the resume ofMr. Kevin walsh who is interested

in employment with the Select Committee.

I should stress, as strongly as possible, that this is not

a routinecreferral. Kevin is the person who first got me interested

in re-opening the investigation.

To the extent that my efforts may have been of value, Kevin

deserves most of the credit.

As you will note from the attached resume, Kevin has oriented

his entire life in recent years around this subject and offers the

unique combination of a thorough grasp of the subject matter and

a. good level-headed approach.

I think he would be an enormous asset to the Committee and

offer my highest personal and professional recommendation.

With warmest personal regards,

Je miles

and Sociology with 32 credit hours in related concentrations.

Background:

In research I co-authored a study of biological rhythms in criminal

and normal behavior along with the Assistant Director of Computer

Facilities at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. We performed

a statistical analysis of computer programed

data from the Massachu-

setts Department of Vital Statistics. The study awaits publication.

As a criminal investigator for Monroe County. Florida in 1973 I

had occasion to apprentice under Mr. John Hunter with the Public

Defenders Office.

Mr. Hunter has been a private investigator for

over twenty years and guided me on field investigations of criminal

cases ranging from petty misdemeanors to homicide.

My background

in law proved useful in report writing and case analysis.

participated in courtroom preparations.

As an incidental, working in the Southern Florida area I developed

several contacts with exile Cubans who have later provided infor-

mation relevant to the J.F.K. case and anti-Castro intelligence

operations. These sources are ongoing.
