in the enclosure to SAs HOWARD P. WINTER and HARVEY E. WILKINSON.

SARRAIN requested that his identity as the source of this

further pertinent information concerning captioned organization.

might be able to secure.

In this connection, SARRAIN stated

that he disapproves of hit-and-run operations but indicated

that, given the opportunity, he might personally engage in a

he declined the offer. He advised, however, that he would be

willing to penetrate the organization as an FBI informant if

this were desired and if suitable terms could be agreed upon.

not be accepted.

in Cuba admitted to the United States.
