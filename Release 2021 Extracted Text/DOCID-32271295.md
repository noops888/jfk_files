of anyone in the CIA who used the name a Maurice Bishop.

the

the second time that very morning of his hearing before the

Committee when Veciana, who had testified earlier, emerged

184

from the hearing room while he, Phillips, was in the hallway.

Phillips

said the first time he met Veciana was at a meeting

185

of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers in Reston.

He said that Veciana was brought to that meeting by an

investigator from Senator Schweiker's office, but; said

Phillips, Veciana

was not introduced to him by name but

only as "the driver."

He said Veciana asked him some

questions in Spanish but at the time, alad

he didn't

sent him to the meeting.

Phillips also testified that he had never used the

On August 10, 1978, B.H. (Balmes Nives Hidalgo Jr.),

a former covert operative of the CIA, was interviewed by the

(194)

Committee in a special closed session.

Secret

B.H. was a CIA agent

(195)

from 1952 to 1970.

Between

1960 and

(196)

1964 he was assigned to Cuban operations.

As such, he testified, he was involved in "day-to-day"

operations

with David Atlee Phillips. He characterized

Phillips as "an excellent intelligence officer" and "a

(197)

personal friend."

When asked if he knew an individual named Maurice

Bishop, B.H. said:

"Again, Mr. Bishop was in the organization but I had

no personal day-to-day open

relationship with him. phillips,

yes; Bishop, no. I knew them both...

Although he couldn't describe Bishop's physical

characteristics,

(199)

Bolt, said he had seen him "two of thige

times" (

in the "hallways or cafeteria"

at CIA headquarters in Langley. B.H. said he thought

(201)

Bishop worked in the Western Hemisphere Division -

(202)

and that he had a position "higher than me."

He could not be more specific. The two or three times he

saw Bishop, he said, was between 1960 and 1964 when he himself

was in Cuban operations, although, he said, he didn't know

(203)

if Bishop worked in that area also.

Asked how, if he didn't personally know Bishop, he

knew the person he saw at CIA headquarters was Maurice

Bishop, B.H. said: "Someone might have said, 'That is

Maurice Bishop,' and it was different from Dave Phillips

or Hal Swenson, guys that I know."

However

When shown the sketch of Maurice Bishop,

B.H. could not identify it as anyone he recognized.
