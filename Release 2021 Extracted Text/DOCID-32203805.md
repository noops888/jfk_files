Cooilla agrees, the ploture 1s evidence of that became the police

they found this charapter (Ruby,) drinking Coca Cole on the second fluor

Juliqta odds that from the I very firit

everything was absurd, that he was a Communist.

Cecilia says this type

(OSWALD) could not be nuts because the whole thing ves so perfectly

and pay attention to what has happened because it 13 evident it Is uii

conspiracy of rightist groups and military men.

She adds that in a Very

obvious way this indiyidual (OSWALD) pretended he wre a Communiss to

Cecilia belleves that he even purposely morried

the Russian girl.: Julieta' comments that all was very vell preparei,

step by, step to blam the Communists, but that now with this (OSWAID's

OSWALD in that ho went to marry a Russian, lator was photographed with the

Dally Workers with the Communist newspapor in one hand and a Troskylot
