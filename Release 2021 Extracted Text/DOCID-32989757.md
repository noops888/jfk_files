On rebruary 29, 1968, a confidential source advised

he had learned that WILLIAM A. PUmErO D(SCuC), during the

Executive Director,

Southean Christian Leadership

• Conference

latter part of Februazy 1963 mentioned to several officers of

SCLC that he had recently discussad SCLC's Washingion Spring

Project (WSP) with Stanley Levison and Harry Wachtel.

According

to Rutherford during this discussion consideration was given to:

should endeavor to discuss

problems of Ghetto people; two, the advisability of reverend

King addressing a joint session

• of Congress

as to problems

and complaints of Ghetto people; and three, whether SCLe should

consider legal action against the United States Government for

financial redress to Negroes

based upon the many years the

American Negro has been held in "slavery". Rutherford offered

no further details regarding these points.

It was source's understanding that Rutherford would

discuss these matters subsequently with Andrew J. Young,

Executive Vice President, SCLC; Hosea Willians, Director

of Voter Pegistration am

Political Education,

SCLC; and

Bernard Lafayetie, Program Administrator, SCIC.

Concerning the possibility of him

meeting wich

President Johnson, Reverend King merely conmented he felt

that at the present time the President would

realize a greater

Andrew J. Young, Executive Vice President,

SCIC, commented he had not

been in favor from the

beginning of including minority groups in the PPC.

Young obsorved thai SCLC would not be able to "dictate"

to these people as it has in the past with nost Negro

groups with which it has deali. Young said Tijerina

is a very orratic person, extronely strong villed, and

would be expocted to remove his people from the PPC

for the slightest provocation.

William A. Rutherford, Executive Dirocor, 'SCiC,

pointed out that Tijerina already had demanded irom

SCLC approxinatoly $2000 exponse money in order to handle

what he clained were anticipated expenses of his own

people. In addition he has denanded other money Irom

SCLC with which to pay financial obligations of his

organization, the Alianza federal De Hercedes.

that those demands of Tijerina have not

been met by SCLC and so far as he was aware Tijerina

An article in the May 26, 1967, issus of the "Aibuquerque

Journal," a daily newspaper published at Albuguerque, New Mexico, quotes

REIES LOPEZ TIJERINA as stating that his entire staff of AFDM nad

resigned as of April 29, 1967, indicating the AFDN would be replaced

by a

JAMES EVANS, Criminal Investigator, U.S. Forest Service,

Albuquerque, New Mexico, on October 22, 1966, advised that he had

individuals who had identified themselves as members of the

FAFCS seize two Forest Service employees and two Forest Service pickup

trucks.

The records of the U.S. District Coust, Albuquerque, New

TIJERINA were arrested on October 26, 1966, charged with assaulting

a Federal officer and conversion of Government propeity. On November 11,

concerning the WSP.

Reverend King commented to several SCIC officials

that in anticipation of SNCC creating problems (not explained)

for SCLC in implementing the WSP it might be

very practical

for SCLC to organize "local groups" in Washington, D. C., and

other communities concerned with the ist.. The function.of

these groups, he said, would be to oppose any undesirable activity

on the part of SNCC rather than

require sCLC personnel to divert

their energies from the WSP:

ALIANZA FEDERAL DE MERCEDES

(Federal Alliance of Spanish Land

Grant Heirs), (AFDM), also known as Federal

Alliance of Free City States (Alianza

Federal de Pueblos Libres) (FAFCS)

On October 8, 1963, the Alianza Federal de Mercedes (Federal

Alliance of Spanish Land Grant Heirs) (AFDM) filed Articles of Incor-

poration in New Mexico. Its stated purpose was to organize and acquaint

the heirs of all the Spanish Land Grants covered by the Treaty of

Guadalupe - Hidalgo.

REIES LOPEZ TIJERINA, 1010 Third Street, N.W.,

Albuguerque, New Mexico, was shown as the president of this organization

An article in the May 26, 1967, issue of the "Albuquerque

Journal," a daily newspaper published at Albuquerque, New Mexico, quoted

REIES LOPEZ TIJERINA as stating that his entire staff of AFDM had

resigned as of April 29, 1967, indicating the AFDM would be replaced

by a "Political Confederation of Free

City States,"

The "Albuguerque Journal" August 20, 1967, issue on page

one carried an article stating that at.

a meeting of

the AFDM at

Albuguerque on August 19, 1967, the name of the organization was changed

to "Federal Alliance of Free City States," (FAFCS), (Alianza Federal de

Pueblos Libres).

The "Albuguerque Journal" on October 17, 1966, in an article

datelined at Abiquiu, New Mexico, related that a group

called the

Federal Alliance of Land Grant (Heirs) had staked out a new "republic"

of the Pueblo San Joaguin del Rio de Chama in Northern New Mexico,

elected a town marshal, mayor, and sheriff and fifty armed men were

deputized and dared authorities to move them out.

JAMES EVANS, Criminal Investigator, U. S. Forest Service,

Albuquerque, New Mexico, on October 22, 1966, advised that he had

observed individuals who

had identified themselves as members of the

FAFCS seize two Forest Service employees and two Forest Service pickup

trucks.

The records of the U. S. District Court, Albuguerque, New

Mexico, reflect that five of

these individuals including REIES

LOPEZ

TIJERINA were arrested on October 26, 1966, charged with assaulting•

a Federal officer and conversion of Government property. On November 11,

1967, REIES LOPEZ TIJERINA and other defendants were found guilty.

The June 6, 1967, issue

of the "Albuguerque Journal"

datelined at Tierra Amarilla, New Mexico, stated that on June 5, 1967,

APPENDIX

members of the AFDM had "blasted" their way into the Tierra Amarilla

• Courthouse where members of AFDM were being arraigned on state charges!

wounding a State Policeman and the jailer by gunfire and taking a

deputy sheriff and a news reporter as hostages.

On October 18, 1967, ROBERT GILLILAND, Criminal Investigator,

New Mexico State Police, Albuquerque, New Mexico, advised that REIES

LOPEZ TIJERINA 'and some

members of the FAFCS met at Canjilon, New Mexico

on June 5, 1967. On that same date, this group went to Rio Arriba

County Courthouse at Tierra Amarilla, New. Mexico, for the

purpose of

taking the members of FAFCS who had been arrested on June 2, 1967, on

charges of assembling

to do an unlawful act with force and violence,

away from the New Mexico State officials and the taking of New Mexico

State District Attorney as a prisoner, At Tierra Amarilla they forcibly

held individuals as hostages, shot and wounded a New Mexico State Police

man, and a Deputy Sheriff of Rio Arriba County and kianapped another

Deputy Sheriff and one LARRY CALLOWAY, a news reporter.

Records of the First Judicial District, State of New Mexico,

• at Santa Fe, New Mexico, as of January 4, 1968, reflect that 20 individ-

uals, including REIES LOPEZ TIJERINA, have been charged in State Court on

various counts of kidnapping and assault with intent to comnit felonies.

On October 18, 1967,

source advised that PAT BLAU BLAWIS

Santa Fe, New Mexico, claims she has been assisting REIES TIJERINA and

the Federal Alliance of Fiee City States, formerly known as Alianza

Federal de Mercedes, in their activities. BLAWIS states

she is acting

as an aâvisor to TIJERINA and claims him as her protege. PAT BLAU BLANI

and REIES TIJERINA are described as individualists and

opportunists. and

they are both trying to use the other one to further their own objective:

TIJERINA undoubtedly would accept assistance and counsel from PAT BLAWIS

but TIJERINA is not controlled by BLAWIS and/or any other individual.

On June 28, 1966, a second source advised that PAT BLAU

BLAWIS had been elected to the National Committee, Communist Party (CP),

USA, at the 18th National Convention of the CP, USA, held in New York

City June 22-26, 1966.

A thira source on October 17, 1967, and a fourth source on

December 5, 1967, individually advised that REIES LOPEZ TIJERINA fOI •

all intents and purposes is the FAFCS. No one tells REIES LOPEZ

TIJERINA what to do: He will listen to other persons but makes his

own decisions.

for

the purpose of setting in

motion

Approxinately 500 delegates from throughout the United States

attended this convention.

The second source advised in September, 1966, that MIRE

ZAGARELL, CPUSA Youth Director,

stated that in Negro communities

the Party still supported the plan to build "left" socialist

centers and to solidify the Party base through the da.

This

source also advised in September, 1966, that DANIEL RUBIN, CPUSA

National Organizational Secretary, stated the Party believes the

DCA should have a working-class outlook and be a mass organization

favorabie to socialism, socialist countries and Marxism, and

in

April, 1967, advised that GUS HALi, CPUSA General Secretary,

indicated the DCA primary emphasis should be on developing mass

resistance to the draft.

A third source advised in september, 1957, that JARVIS

TYNER was elected

chairman of the scA on september 10, 1967, at

the Third national Convention of the DeA held in New York, New

the CPUSA.

A fifth source advised on Septenber 21, 1967, that the

headquarters of the DCA is located at 34 West 17th Street, New

INTERNAL SECURITY - C

On April 22, 1968,

a confidential source advised

Martin Luther King, Jr.,

Southern

Christian Leadership Conference (SCLO) has gradually pulled

itself together from its initial state of confusion.

As of

present time the staff appears to have

that the

, "dreamer"

we diple at the emot be continued.

Reverend Ralph D. Abernathy, President, SCLC,

most

reluctant to assume the leadership of this organization because

of a lack of self confidence.

Abernathy,

however, 'is determined

to perform his best in this position until the SCLC annual

convention is held duringthe summer of 1968,

at which time

feels the organization will replace him if his performance is

not adequate.

As of the present time, the SCLC Executive

Staff

1s reasonably united in its desire and effort to continue

with the plans of Reverend King.

A number of the staff have

developed a recent lack of respect and distrust for Jesse

Jackson, Northern Director, Operation Breadbasket, SCLC,

located in Chicago, Illinois. This attitude is based upon

Jackson's actions immediately following the shooting of Reverend

King on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee.

Immediately

Executive Staff members who

were in Memphis with Reverend King immediately entered into

a gentleman's agreement that they would return to SCLC National

Headquarters in Atlanta for such discussion and action as might

be necessary.

COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF SOUTHERN

CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE

Jackson instead of traveling to Atlanta returned

to Chicago where It is felt he engaged in discussions with

his own Breadbasket staff as to how he might improve his own

organizational position during the dilemma which immediately

plagued the organization following the sudden death of Reverend

King. One of Jackson's maneuvers was to have a Chicago insurance

broker, Cirilo A. McSween, named as Treasurer of SCLC, which

is the position previously held by Abernathy.

Jackson has also offended a number of SCLC Executive

Officers

because of statements made by him to the news media

Immediately following 'the

shooting of Reverend King.

Jackson

is accused of seeing publicity as being the closest

SCIC

official to Reverend King at the moment when he was shot. These

SCLC officials are

mutually agreed that Abernathy was the closest.

to Reverend King at that time.

Abernathy has indicated to a number of his staff he

is quite aware of Jackson's political maneuvers and he is willing

to have MeSween occupy the position of Treasurer, SCLC, until

the SCLC annual convention is held auring the summer of 1968

at which time he said it might be desirable to replace McSween.

to LENIN in Moscow, Russia.

SHOENBRUN's talk stayed with speci-

fics and facts, never deviating until the end when he labeled

General WESTMORELAND as

"incompetent and

should be removed from

his commana"

SHOENBRUN declared that we "will not send 200,000 more troops

Into Vietnam"

He stated that

"on the record, we are wrong.:. we

SHOENBRUN added, "but if she is

lush, he would dry her out."

SHOENBRUN asked that the meeting be dedicated... and indeed,

future action dedicated to

"if our country right, OK, if our

country worng, put it right."

He asked for the support of Senator EUGEN

_ NC CARTHY 's candidacy

for President of the United States.

During the question and answer period, time allowed for only one

question to SHOENBRUN.

The question asked was

"How the hell do

we get out"

. SHOENBRUNs answer was as follows: 1. Stop bombing

North Vietnam... since bombing

hasn"t stopped infiltration which

has risen from four-hundred infiltrators three years ago to

seventy-thousand infiltrators today... 2. Affirming the fact that

they will talk... 3. If Saigon doesn't want to talk, tell them

either to fight or else we'll pull out... 4. Reconstruet the

principles of the Geneva Conferance with all involved parties

present. Hold a two year moratorium and then hold free elections.

5. Build up the South Vietnamese army and then phase out.

ANDREW YOUNG spoke on the upcoming Poor Peoples Campaign to

eradicate poverty in America, a campaign sponsored by the

Southern Christian Leadership Conference under the direction of

the Rev. MARTIN LUTHER KING.

YOUNG noted that this was the second time within a three day

period that he had shared the same rostrum with DAVID SHOENBRUN.

YOUNG also noted that it was specifically because of a single

article written by SHOENBRUN some three years ago which caused

the Rev. MARTIN LUTHER KING and the Southern Christian Leader-

ship Conference to pitch their tents in the peace camp.

In reference to the Poor Peoples Campaign, YOUNG stated

simply

that SCLC is merely trying to raise. the issues and confront

America with its hypocrisy... that the SCLC is dealing with

problems of a changing social order... that whites are blinded

to the fact by the racial issue... that even if there were no

blacks, there are still openings for economic revolution.

YOUNG stated that the poverty striken are locked out of the

political structure and have neither the money nor the time to

get in... and that hitting the streets is America's greatest

educational weapon.

YOUNG stated that when problems are taken to the steets on a

consistant, steady basis, it works.

YOUNG stressed that the poor have to disassociate themselves from

administrative policies and live according to their principles...

willing to live or die for

education, housing, employment, etc.

YOUNG noted that poor people from 53 organizations met in Atlanta,

Georgia last Thursday from

every race and culture to plan the

Poor Peoples Campaign.

On the 22nd of April, YOUNG stated that the Rev. KING and aides

will meet with members of Congress and the poor people will be

able to tell about the lives they lead... and how one-quarter of

Americas people are locked out of economy and the decisison

making process.

YOUNG expects 3000 people to converge on Washington about May Ist.

YOUNG stated that he doesn't believe in violence...

that the

black nationalists haven't hurt or killed anybody yet but them~

selves.

YoUNG did not express any worry over the possibility of violence.

Nor did he express any fear. of President JOHNSON possibly panicking

and going right wing.

Shacks will be erected before the Halls of Congress, HUD, and the

White House to portray living conditions of the poverty striken.

The poor will pray at the nations capitol. The poor will march

and

pitch tents where-ever they want to.

A young man by the last name of MESSINGER was introduced to

the assemblage with the announcement that he was going to refuse

induction on the following morning. A plea was sounded for

people to appear at 45 Grace Avenue, Great Neck at 6:15 on the

following morning in order to demonstrate in support of the young

man's stand. MESSINGER was given a round of applause.

A smattering of people left the meeting flowing SHOENBRUNS

talk.

Following the meeting (also preceeding the meeting) there was

in evidence ample supllies of fliers, circulars, petitions, etc.

all concerned with ending the war in Vietnam. Included on the

tables displaying the literature were numerous paper-back copies

of books dealing specifically with the Vietnamese War (14

different titles in all).

They wanted transportation to Atlanta. I told hin that

I would be more than glad to give then a lift since I

Taking then to town was a break for

me because they were invited to attend the private norning

Do her, Celinic

Gail 29,

on Sunday, April 28,1968, at two o'clock pm., the writer attended a

meeting of the Black United Front, at the First Christian Church at 520

Bissell street in Richmond, California.

When the writer arrived there were only two other persons connected

with the B.U.F. there but others began to arrive shortly thereafter.

Before the meeting got underway armed guards were stationed at strategic

places along the walls and at the doors inside the building, and one was

locked in the balcony. These guards had their weapons concealed inside

of attache cases that they carried. (This information was told to the

writer in confidence, and the writer saw the weapon of the guard in the

balcony, -it was a .38 rovolver with a two inch barrel). After about

thirty people had arrived the chairman of the meeting Mamadou Lummumba

(Kenny Freeman) began

the meeting with a short speech. In his speech he

mentioned that this was the second meeting of the B.U.f. and that it was

fIrst formed by Stokley Carmichael in February of 1968, with the purpose

of being a centralized united organization from which all of the varied

black groups or parties will branch. He stressed. the point that unity

must be achieved and that in order to make this possible there must be

communication between all of the organizations. He mentioned the deaths

of Dr. Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, and Bobby Hutton, and the imprison-

ment of Huey Newton, Rap Brown, and

Eldridge cleaver, as examples of how

the "devils" are trying to exterminate our black leaders to keep us fron

achieving any type of unity because they know that once we àre unified

they can no longer push us around, and. that they are afraid that we might

retaliate for the wrongs that have been perpetrated against us.

After'he had spoken for about fifteen minutes he introduced a speaker

from a black citizens council in Pittsburgh, California who spoke of a

racial incident that took place at Pittsburgh Senior High School sometime

earlier this year. He spoke of a planned boycott and à show of force

that is to be carried out on Tuesday, April 30, 1968 when the sixteen stud-

ents that were expelled from school are to have a hearing at that school.

He requested that a delegation from all of the organizations represented

be present for that hearing. Then he introduced an ex-student of that

school, Jerald Wright, to testify to the climate of racism that exists at

that school between black students and white students, and between black

students and the all shite faculty with particular emphasis on the school

principal. A large number of the organizations represented pledged to

send a delegation on Tuesday.

The next speaker was Rev. Andrew Young Jx, of the Southern Christian

Leadershio Council, who talked about the role of non-violence in the

black liberation struggle. He talked about Dr. King's ideas and methods

of fighting the racism that has plagued the Negro not only in the south

but in all parts of America. He commended the B.U.F. on its purpose of

unification of black organizations and the Black Panther Party for its

stand against police brutality in the black community. Immediately

after his speoch he and his traveling companion Rev. Anderson left the

meeting.

After this chairman Lummumba gave another short speech in which he

stressed the view that the B.U.F. was not formed to dictate to Its men

bers any special technique regarding methods of fighting racism, but that

each member should do whatever their individual "thing" is whether it

, is

a violent or a non-violent method.

Then the chairman began to explain the bylaws of the B.U.r. by sayine

that they were forned by a steering committee of six people besides hir-

(Last name not mentioned), and Bro. Hank Jones. But since only a few of

the members had copies of the bylaws he had to stop and wait until Sr..

Ruther i.

Barbara Arthur and another brother handed them out. They were passed out

to the representatives of organizations only (which totaled twenty-three).

Authin f.A.

Sr. Arthur

took the name of the organization and of the representative and

the brother would hand them the copy of the bylaws. (The writer should

mention here that the writer had noticed beforehand the absence of the

Black Panther Party. The guards mentioned at the beginning of this report

were not members of the Black Panther Party. The Black Panther Party made

its first appearance at the meeting during chairman Lummumba's speech

alter the exit of Rev. Young. About twenty of them had filed in the front

door with Bobby Seale and had stood along the wall for about two minutes

and had filed back out by the front door). At this point in the meeting

while the brother and Sr. Arthur were passing out the bylaws, the Black

Panther Party made another entrance this time through one of the rear

doors and walked over and surrounded the brother and Sr.

Seale told sr. Arthur in a loud voice that he vanted to speal to her.

Then he began to swear at her and told her that she had better keep her

nose out of places where it didn't belong or else something was going to

be done. He told her that he didn't have time to play her type of games

when there were lives at stake. He said that brothers are dying, and that

he had brothers in jail and brothers on death rove, and that he just didn't

have time for her "jive"games. Neanwhile she kept saying that she didn't

know what he was talking about. He told her not to stand there and play

like she didn't know what he was talking about because she knew "damed.

good and well" what he was talking about. (It seems that she had made a

public statement threatening Berkeley city councilman Ron Dollums with

some sort of retaliation by the Black Panther Party if he didn't do them

some kind of favor, what the favor was it is not clear). At this time

Authla's husband came up and tried to tell Bobby Seale to leave his viro

alone and that she didn't have to listen to that stuff, when he was immead-

lately seized by three Panthers but was immediately released when Bobby

Seale commanded them to and reminded them that he had told them not to

move until he moved. Then he told Mrs. Arthur that he had told her before.

and he was telling her now to mind her own business and keep her nose out

Of Party business and not to come around the Panther office again, and

this was the last time that he was going to tel? her. He said that her big

mouth was the reason that she was kicked out of the Black Panther Party by

Newton, Cleaver, and himself. Then he whirled and walked out sith his Pan-

thers following him.

When order was finally restored, a notion was made that the B.U.F. re-litc

cognize the Black Panther Party as a political party, and it was passed

with no opposition. The flor was then opened to ideas concerning amend-

ments and additions to the bylaws. and purposes of the B.U.F. Among the

suggestions was one by a sister representing an organization in San Jose

that we form some type of training class to teach our black women how to

shoot weapons and how to protect thomselves and defend their homes "like

these white women are doing". There was a lot of head nodding and individ-

ual verbal exclamations of affirmation but no formal action was proposed

or taken by the B.U.F. There were suggestions of setting up classrooms in

churches to tutor black children in all points of formal education. A law-

yer that was present said that he would solieit 1,000.00 dollars from his

associates to be turned over to the B.U.F. for whatever necessary expenses

they had.

The last spoaker was Bro. Larry Thomas Co-ordinator of High School

Black Student Unions.

Bro. Thomas told of a planned boycott of Housewives

Market In Oakland beginning Hay 1,1968, and of a immediate boycott of all

Ingram Food Company facilities and products, and also the immediate boy-

cott of Red's Tomales.

Following Bro. Thomas' talk a motion for adjournment was entertained ans

passed, and the meeting was adjourned until May 12,1968 at the same place.

There were about 65 persons present at the end of the meeting. The

writer recognized the presence of Ernie Allen who goes by the name of

Mwananchi ilkalimoto, beside those already mentioned in the text of this re-

port.. While speaking, chairman Lunnumba often used the pronoun "we" and a

soy times he mentioned the Brothors of Umoja. mio Allons Younger brother

Doug was there.
