On Nov. 22, 1963 Mrs. Shields was employed by Ed wells

fashions, which was located at 501 Elm St. 5th floor (corner

of Elm and Houstons Sts.) At approx. 12 noon Mrs. Shields

and several co workers came down stairs for lunch and to watch

the Presidential motorcade. Prior to the arrival of the motor-

cade Mrs. Shields stated that she saw an auto driving around

the Plaza with writing on the body, advertising "Honest Joe's

Pawn Shop".

The auto left before the arrival.of the motorcade

When the motorcade arrived, the President was waving and had

just passed when

she heard what sounded like a fire cracker

coming from the direction of the railroad crossing, the

President's hand went up towards his head and the car made

a little pause and then took off. We all ran to the rail-

road tressell and looked in the boxcars. There was a lot

of people looking in the boxcars, also police were there.

We returned to work and were told to go home.
