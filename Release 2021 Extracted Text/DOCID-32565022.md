Re: RUSSELL, A. BUFALINO

NOTE:

Bufalino is presently subject of an INS deportation hearing

in Philadelphia.

Sue Nichols testified as a Government witness

5/13/64 at this hearing at which time she admitted being previously

interviewed by FBI Agents in 1959 or 1960 re subject.

Defense Counsel

has requested copies of all information furnished to the FBI by

Nichols concerning subject.

This procedure was followed by Defense

Counsel with an earlier witness, J. R. Troup, who had furnished Bureau

Agents a signed statement concerning Troup's association with subject.

Philadelphia was authorized in that instance to provice a copy of the

signed statement to INS with the understanding it need not be introduced

by Bureau personnel.

Witness Nichols information furnished Philadelphia Agents on

6/7/61 concerned Jane Collins being a friend of Bufalino and that she

had observed Butalino at Club 82 at Pittston, Pennsylvania, which she

believed he owned along with some dress factories.

No other pertinent

information was furnished. Collins, Bufalino's paramour, is identical

to PH 665-C-TE.

She has advised Philadelphia Agents she

will not

testify at Bufalino's hearing by invoking the Fifth Amendment. This

action by Collins should result in her informant status remaining in-

tact and eliminate an opportunity for Defense Counsel to inject the

Jencks Law.

Regarding witness Robert Karbowsky, we must first establish

if he plans to testify.

If he invokes the Fifth Amendment, there is no

apparent problem.

However, if he does not, we must be prepared to

meet Defense Counsel's usual request for information furnished by

Karbowsky to the FBI bykaving the pertinent files identified and

reviewed.

content and did

I&NS be furnished the exact two paragraphs from SA HOULIHAN'S

report.

In regard to the possibility that JANE C. COLLINS O

will be a witness at the hearing of BUFALINO's deportation

BUFALINO's paramour, JANE COLLINS, 1S PH 665-C-TE.

In this capacity she was originally contacted 9/20/63 and

has continued to furnish information primarily in regard to

BUFALINO since that time.
