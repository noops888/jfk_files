Campaign Activities, to Mr. Lyle 1. Miller, Deputy Legis-

lative Counsel.

a 14 May 1962, Agency

memorandum which refers to contact between Mr. Lawrence

Houston, then General Counsel,

and the then Attorney

General, Mr. Robert Kennedy,

with the intention of "quashing

of a Grand Jury organized

indictment against Sam

Gianconni (sic) (Salvatore Giancana)." Mi. Lenzner is under-

stood to believe this reported contact and the circumstances

surrounding

the intended Agency utilization of Mr. Giancana

during President John F. Kennedy's Administration were being

surfaced in 1971 as part of

an

effort to obtain blackmail-

type information on certain principals in the Denocratic

Party. Mr. Lenzner specifically requested information on

Agency contacts

with the Administration during 1971

relating

to this matter.

2. The files and records of all individuals identified

with the planned utilization of Mi. Giancana were searched.
