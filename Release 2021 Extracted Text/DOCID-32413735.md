Jack Anderson 20 January 1977 Column

Titled "CIA Tied to False Oswald Story"

B. Identification of the Mr. X in the

Anderson Column

The attached column, citing the testimony of a Mr. X,

alleges that a ClA agent tried to link Oswald to Cuban intelli-

gence officers in Mexico.

There is, of course, no substance to

the column's allegations.

The column identifies the source as

Mr. X because of attempts on his life, but

subsequently gives

chough information on Mr. X to establish his identity.

According to the Anderson column, Mr. X was first met

by his ClA contact in Havana before

relations with U.S./Cuha were

severed.

Mr. X had helped to organize bank accountants to cm-

bezzle Cuban government funds to finance anti-Castro causes.

Mr. X was reportedly recruited by a Morris Bishop (ClA contact),

to plan an

attempt on Castro's life. The plan has to fire a

bazooka from

a nearby apartment building while Castro vas deliver-

ing one

of his marathon specches.

According to the Anderson

column,

the plot was discovered by Castro's police and Mr.

escaped

to Miami.

Nr. X also reportedly tried

Castro in Chile in 1971 in league with the l'enezuelan Luis Posada

Carriles,

for visas for con relativos of the four men assigned to kill lastro,

and also requested four Ml rifles with adapters

for grenades plus

grenades.

The cos did not encourage VECIll and subsequently

checked with an Embassy officer who reported that VECIANA had made

similar "wild-eyed" proposals to him.

On 23 Novenher 1901 the

Miami News published a report of an unsuccessful attempt by Antonio

VECTANA to kill Castro.

VECIANA reportedly had arranged to

assassinate Castro and Cuban President Osvaldo Dorricos on 5 October

in Havana, but the bazooka he was using failed to fire.

There has been no Agency relationship with VECIANA. A

POA, which

was granted for his use in para-military affairs in

January 1962,
