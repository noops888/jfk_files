SAMUEL M.

GIANCANA, aka

(00: CHICAGO)

-'"TRINED

Re Bureau airtol dated 1/30/70, instructing

Chicago to advise of information developed concerning

the recont alleged visit of GIANCANA to the Chicago

area. U

No Chicago informant or source was able to

provide any information indicating the possibility that

GIANCANA visited the Chicago area during December of

1969 or January of 1970. U

Former PCI MARY KAY MC ALLISTER, a neighborhood

source in the vicinity of the residence of GIANCANA,

which continues to be occupied by his relatives, at

1147 South Wenonah in Oak Park, Illinois, was contacted

on several occasions during December and January and

advised that she is quite certain that GIANCANA did not

visit his residence during this period. U

CG 7016-PC and CG 6687-PC, both of whom were

closely associated with GIANCANA, in the leadership of

organized crime, advised that they received no indica-

tion whatsoever

that GIANCANA visited Chicago recently.

Both advised that they felt that they would be knowledgeble

being current leaders of organized crime here should

GIANCANA return to the Chicago area even for a brief

visit. Although neither of these PCs has been developed

to the point where total reliability is evident, their

apparent sincerity in furnishing the above information

nade it appear that they were sincore in this recard.
