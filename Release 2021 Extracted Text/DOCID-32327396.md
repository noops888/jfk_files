Synopsis:

MANUEL RAY RIVERO, head of Junta Revolucionaria

Cubana (JURE), publicly promised to be in Cuba by 5/20/64.

As May, 1964, approached, JURE issued more press releases.

U. S. press and wire services watched for military action

against Cuba.

Cuban armed forces were alerted.

On 6/1/64,

RAY and 7 others were captured by a British destroyer

at Anguila Key, Bahamas.

These 8 persons were fined

$14.00 each and released by the British.

RAY's group

included one girl and two American newsmen.

On 5/13/64,

Movimiento Recuperacion Revolucionario (MRR) made a naval

attack against a sugar mill at Puerto Pilon, Oriente

Province, Cuba.

MRR claimed to have destroyed 70,000

bags

of sugar.

In 4/64, the military Plan Omega of Second

National Front of the Escambray group (SNFE),

was to be

implemented and coordinated with JURE.

In 5/64,

there

was no indication Plan Omega would be put into effect in

immediate future.

Comandos L (C-L) organization is inactive

in the New York City area.

On 5/12/64, a 25' C-I boat

containing arms and ammunition exploded in the Florida

Keys. (On 6/3/64, C-I leader told an NBC newsman that in

about two months a mission would be made against Cuba.

C-L offered to sell NBC the moving pictures to be taken.

was a great amount of expectation and speculation by Cuban

against Cuba.

On May 20, 1964, CISNEROS issued a press release

stating that a new offensive was beginning on Cuban soil,

JURE was satisfied with the progress, and everything was

going fine.

On May 31, 1964, CISNEROS admitted to the press he

did not know the whereabouts of RAY, and that things were

not going well.

MM T-l advised there was considerable speculation

as to the whereabouts of RAY.

The majority of Cuban exiles

felt let down and said that RAY had failed. Many exiles

speculated RAY was in Cuba reorganizing the Cuban underground.

Other exiles guessed that RAY was somewhere in the Caribbean

or Central America.

in Miami.

MM T-1 said that ANDREM/STURE headquarter

On June 7, 1964, MIRIA BORRAS, in a press interview,

stated she graduated

Miami Senior High School, Miami,

florida, and is the foster daughter of ROGELIO CISNEROS.

She stated she was in the Caribbean as a radio operator

with RAY.

She claimed that RAY's attempt to enter Cuba

by May 20th was foiled by a Cuban patrol boat.

Later, RAY

and the group put into Anguila Key to repair a faulty

boat

engine.

When RAY and his group spotted the British

destroyer "Decoy," they dumped some of the equipment on

the key.

RAY and two others stayed on this key to hide

the equipment. The others left in the small boat to avoid

capture.

Later, they were all captured and taken to Nassau

aboard the British destroyer.

They were each fined $14.00
