WASHINGTON, D.C. 20515

October 20, 1978

Mr. John Lawler

Chief of Finance

U.S. House of Representatives

263 Cannon House Office Building

Washington, D.C. 20515

Attention: Mr. Walter Warley

Dear Mr. Lawler:

I am writing in regard to Mrs. Marion Wills,

formerly employed as Deputy Chief Clerk with the

Select Committee on Assassinations.

Mrs. Wills' position with the Select Committee

was abolished in August of this year.

Unfortunately,

several months following Mrs. Wills' departure, the

Committee realized it had been a mistake to terminate

this position, in light of the work associated with

public hearings, and it decided to refill the position

with someone already on the staff, rather than to re-

hire Mrs. Wills as an economy measure.

I hope this letter will clear up any misunder-

standing concerning Mrs. Wills' particular situation.

Sincerely,

S Roht Blaby

G. Robert Blakey
