I mentioned to McConnell my discussions with Charles Snodgrass,

Defense Subcommittee staff, House Appropriations Committee, about what

the Senate is doing on the authorization bill.

I told him we had received a cable from the field concerning Bill

Jordan's, also of the Committee staff, interest in a sensitive project at

that station. I told McConnell that we would be prepared to give Jordan a

limited briefing on this matter when he returns from his trip.

I also told McConnell that we had another Presidential finding and

that Tom White would be by to give him the details.
