and advised

whom he knew as SCALZETTI,

that the only relation he had with the subjesy

Neither he nor the

It is noted that subject's attorney, JORGE

CASTILLO Z., has petitioned the Mexican Government to

review their decision not to grant subject immigrant status

in Mexico.

He denies that subject has any relation with

the underworld and claims that, although he formerly was

a part-owner of gambling casinos, he has been retired since

1950.

He claimed

that since that time subject has been

persecuted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and

contended that subject could not be a criminal because

he has been residing in the United States and has not

been arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for uf

any crimes.

He claimed that subject had not returned to

Mexico since he was requested to leave in October of 1966.

Apparently, based on the inquirdes being made

in Cuernavaca, CASTILLO contacted inspectors of Mexicar

Immigration to inquire the basis for these inquiries.

He was asked subject's whereabouts, and claimed he did not

know •

He at first indicated that he believed subject was

traveling at unknown localities

in Europe,

but subsequently

hinted that subject was in Miami, Florida.

It is noted that most Mexico City

- Miami flights

go through Mexican Customs and Immigration Inspection at

Merida, Yucatan, Mexico, and that information previously

reported indicated that subject had been seen in Merida.

Sources have indicated that Merida is notorious for the

(corruption in its Immigration and Customs inspections.
