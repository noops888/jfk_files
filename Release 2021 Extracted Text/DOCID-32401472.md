MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: SSC Contact

Jim Johnston and Dan Dwyer of the SSC staff raised

the following questions during the course of a discussion

with the Review Staff on 19 February 1976.

1. They are most anxious to know the

identify of the initials G. N. N. which

appear on several AMLASH papers.

They

would like our firm assurance that we are

not able to identify this person.

2. They would like to know if John

Whitten is available for a possible interview.

3. They reviewed the 201 file on

Gilberto Lopez and ask if there would be any

other files such as Security or a file main-

tained by LA Division or by CI Staff.

They

noted particularly that there is a cable

dated March 1964 which is not included in

the 201 file.

4. They would still like to have this

file sent to them and would like a statement

in writing as to why we object.

They note that the only photograph

shows him wearing sunglasses and

ask if there

is a better likeness available.

6.

LITEMPO.

They ask for a identification of

They request a letter in writing

about the present unavailability of the Mannells.
