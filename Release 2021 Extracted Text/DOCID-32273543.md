COMPILATION OF CONCLUSIONS AND OTHER RHETORIC FROM

Note:

MEXICO CITY REPORT (Lopez)

I thought that: the following excerpts would

be useful for the reviewers.

I have attempted

to organize the excerpts by subject.

Rodger S. Gabrielson

Ext. 1385 (R)

CIA as "Investigative Agency"

Whe Presd St John Ve Kennedy as assassinat, DA, overbE 22, 10,5.

-were asked to investigate the assassination.

Silvia Duran

The Central Intelligence Agency had relied on Duran's statements

but had deleted Duran's description of Oswald as blonde and short. 706/

It had also excised Duran's statement=="The only aid she could give

Oswald was advising that he

see the Soviet Consul, and calling the

person in charge of that office" which alluded to

Oswald asking for

some type of aid at the Cuban Consulate. 707! In addition, Ms. Duran's

strong statement "He never called her back" 707a/ was changed to

"she does not recall whether or not Oswald later telephoned her

at the Consulate number that she gave him. 707b/ Had the statements

been included, the Warren Commission's conclusions would not have

seemed as strong.

357

The Committee found no evidence in this file review that Silvia

Duran was either an American or Mexican intelligence agent.)

....the Committee has interviewed most of the Mexico City Station

employees about the possibility. Only David Phillips, Chief of

Covert Action and the Cuban Section in the Mexico City Station in

1963, a position which made him very knowledgeable, considered that

Duran

was possibly an agent or source.

Another CIA employee, Dan Neiscuir, who worked on

an.."Oswald

Task Force" in late September or early October of 1975 dealing

with Freedon of Information Act law suits brought against the

Agency concerning

believed that Ms.

- either the CIA or the Mexicans. 771/

rins DuraMexicans:

stated that he

the an ay on bee larvey scald sette that her

Mr. Hidalgo, professing not to remember all the details, stated

that he thought that Duran was a Cuban intelligence agent.)

With no corroborating evidence for Mr. Hidalgo's memory, the

Committee must conclude that Silvia Duran was probably never

employed by Cuban Intelligence.

369

Visit to Cuban Consulate

Lee Harvey Oswald visited the Cuban Consulate three times on

September 27, 1963, not twice as the Warren Commission previously

reported.. 712/ Oswald first visited the Cuban Consulate at approxi-

mately 11:00

a.m., requesting an intransit visa to Cuba with russia

as the final destination. 713/ He showed her some documents, then

left to obtain photographs needed for his application. 714/

Oswald returned at approx. 1:00 p.m. with four photographs. 715/359

Oswald returned to the Cuban Consulate between 5:00 p.m. and

Spanish was at the gate

called Tirado inquiring about a visa.) 724/

CIA Declined To Aid

The Committee next asked the Central Intelligence Agency to

arrange interviews with LICHANT/1 (Manuel Calvillo), LICOOKIE/1

June Cobb, who may have had intormation related to Lee harvey

swald's trip to Mexico City. 990/ The Central Intelligence Agency

declined to aid the Committee in this aspect of the investigation. 991/

Committee returned to Mexico City on August 7, 1978 and

attempted to locate June Cobb Sharp and Manuel Calvillo on its

own.

992/

393-394

U.S. Interference

The Committee believes that there is a possibility that a

U.S. Government agency requested the Mexican government to refrain

from aiding the Committee with this aspect of its work.

Oswald's Spanish

The reporter described Oswald as a strange and introverted

individual who spoke very little Spanish. 1030/

399

Oswald Imposter

lhe Committee notes the possibility, but does not conclude;

that

the missino production from the pulse camera and the LILYRIC

base has something to do with the possibility that someone imper-

sonated Oswald in Mexico.

AMLASH

Professor Blakey stated that the Committee was no longer

interested in interviewing Rolando Cubella

Captain Felipe Villa stated that the Cuban government,

relying on the seriousness and honesty of the Committee's

thought that the Comnittee should have knowledge of

Cuebela's statements.
