Congressman ROBERT EDGAR (D-Pa.) , HSCA member,

travelled to Ottawa, Ontario, with three staff members and on

4/14/78 met with Deputy Solicitor General P.A. BISSONNETTE and

later met with RCMP officers, including the Officer in Charge

th Bone or tore, 10c

of Federal Policing Branch.

The purpose of Congressman EDGAR's trip was, according

to sources,

to obtain a promise of cooperation from the Canadian

Government in the HSCA investigation relating tó JAMES EARL

RAY while he was in Canada.

Congressman EDGAR advised

MT. BISSONNETTE that some investigative activity would be

directed toward determining if there had been any connection

between RAY and J.B. STONER and others of the National States

Rights Party.

Congressman EDGAR was received cordially by Mr.

BISSONNETTE but no definite commitments were made by the latter

beyond the desire of the Canadian Government to cooperate with

the U.S. Government whenever it is possible to do so.

Congressman EDGAR got off to a bad start at RCMP

Headquarters with an initial remark that one of the purposes

the prior investigation to be adequate in every degree and

Congressman EDGAR made repeated efforts to explain away the

remark.

RCMP agreed to assist the HSCA by making available

any of its members for interview; attempting to locate persons

previously interviewed by RCMP and determine if the person was

agreeable to interview by HSCA investigators, in the presence of

and doing name checks on any new names

surfaced in the

HSCA investigation.

RCMP did not agree to allowing HSCA to review

its files, to conduct any new investigation for the HSCA or to

allow the

committee to conduct any investigation in Canada.

Congressman EDGAR was told that any requests for investigation in

Canada must be presented to the RCMP through the FBI or through

diplomatic channels.

Letter. #2

The Honorable Griffin B. Bell

• Attorney General of the United States

Department of Justice

Washington, D.C.

Attention: Mr. Robert I. Keuch

Deputy Assistant Attorney General

Criminal Division, Room 2113

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

This letter serves to confirm the understanding reached •

between this Committee

and the FBI on April 12, 1978, concerning

1) the roles the FBI informants within the Invader organization

relative to the activities of DI. Martin Luther King, JI., and

2) the possible cooperative postures of the informants who have

provided information concerning

the relationship between Klan

members and Arthur Hanes, Sr., in the course of the latter's

representation of James BRiSt REC-72 6 2-117 290 - 633

As to the Invader situation, it is understood that the

FBI will locate and sanitize the informant files of all informants

within the Invaders during 1968 and provide the Committee with

access to these files. The sanitizing process will be undertaken

only to the extent necessary to protect the identity of the in-

formants.

The FBI will also provide the Committee, for interview

purposes, with the control agent or agents for these Invader

informants.

This Committee, however, reserves the right to

request production of the identity of all Invader informants

during 1968 should the sanitized files and agent interviews.be.

inconclusive on the issues to be resolved by the Committee.

2 APR 19 1978

As to the informants who have provided information

relative to the klan relationship with Arthur Hanes, SfT during

the course of Hanes' representation of James Earl Ray, it is

understood that the FBI will contact the informants listed in

he serials listed below: to determine if an interview with this

March 13, 1978

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA)

In the couse of a file review in an unrelated

matter, SL 3167-C, St. Louis File 137-16185, Bureau File

137-36945, was reviewed.

This file contained a contact

memorandum dated March 19, 1974, which contained information

relating to several criminal matters and also contained the

following paragraph:

"During the Fall of 1973, five or six months ago,

date not recalled, Beyers came to the shop inquiring as

to whether they could get together to talk, and they later

did so at Pizza and Cream, Clayton, Mo., in the area of a

Broad-Dugan Paint Store, where informant had traveled on

business.

Beyers talked freely about himself and his

business, and they later went to informant's house where

Beyers told a story about visiting a lawyer in St. Louis

County, now deceased, not further identified, who had

offered to give him a contract to kill Martin Luther King.

He said that also present was a short, stocky man, who

walked with a limp. (Later, with regard to the latter

individual, Beyers

commented that this man was actually

the individual who made the payoff of James Earl Ray after

the killing.) Beyers said he had declined to accept this

He did remark that this lawyer had confederate

flags and other items about the house that might indicate

that he was 'a real rebel'. Beyers also commented that

he had been offered either $10,000 or $20,000 to kill King."

Extensive further research in the St. Louis indices

and files failed to reveal this information was if any way

disseminated and the information simply reposes in the informant

file.

March 28, 1978

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE

ON ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA)

On March 16, 1978, from 2:12 p.m., to

3:54 p.m., SA James W. Sammon, assigned Jackson,

Mississippi, FBI Division, appeared before representatives

of the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA)

at Washington, D.C.

SA Sammon was questioned by Mark A. Speiser,

Peter G. Beeson, and Wendy s. Collins, all of whom

identified themselves through the use of credentials,

as being associated with aforementioned committee.

At the outset, SA Sammon was asked to furnish

background information concerning his career with the

FBI,

the number of offices and dates assigned and

classifications worked.

SA Sammon was asked to identify Special

Agents in Charge (SACs) and Assistant Special Agents

in Charge (ASAcs) assigned to the Miami, Florida,

EBl Office during the period of 1961-1964, when

SA Sammon was so assigned to that office.

The identity

of these

SAcs was furnished as Wesley G. Grapp and

Fred A. Frobrose (phonetic). It was explained that

former SAC Frobrose is now

deceased.

SA Sammon was asked to identify members of

his squad while he was assigned to the Miami Office.

SA Sammon advised that he would be unable to identify

each and every Agent assigned to the Number 5 squad

during the years of 1961 and 1904 inclusive, due to the

length of time that had transpired since that period.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions

of the iBl. It is the property of the Bl and is loaned

to your agency; it and its contents are not to be distributed

any information furnished by Somerset was disseminated

to that intelligence unit during the period of

America (UKA), White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan

(WKKKK); and the "Silver Dollar Group"

that immediately after the shooting death of Dr. Martin

Luther King, SA Sammon was assigned the responsibility

of traveling through North Mississippi with photographs

of the evidence left by King's assailant, exhibiting

those photographs at motels, service stations, in

North Mississippi to determine if any of the photographs

could be identified.

SA Sammon was asked if he was aware of Somerset's

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE

ON ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA)

SA Sammon was then questioned regarding the

Bureau policy in discontinuing informants and if the

informants are advised that they are being so discontinued.

SA Sammon advised that the informant is so advised wher

he is discontinued, usually determined when the intormant

has furnished a lack of positive information, or when

exposed himself as an informant, and of course

upon his death.

SA Samnon was then questioned regarding

Somerset's personal involvement in violence; Somerset's

personal bigotry toward minority races; his bigotry

regarding,

union membership; his carrying or weapons;

and Somerset's knowledge of explosive devices; and

information furnished by Somerset regarding Thomas

Albert "Tommy"" Tarrants.

To these questions, SA Sammon advised that he

did not have any personal information of acts of violence

performed by Somerset; and that the only personal bigotry

exhibited by Somerset was Somerset's apparent dislike

for SA Sammon, as Somerset felt that SA Sammon was

of Jewish descent. SA Sammon advised that he had no

knowledge of any acts of bigotry in union membership as

indicated by Somerset, nor was SA Sammon aware of Somerset

ever carrying

a weapon or Somerset's knowledge of any

explosive devices.

SA Sammon advised the committee that

he did not recall

Somerset ever furnishing any information

regarding Thomas Albert "Tommy" Tarrants; however, SA Sammor

was acquainted with larrants, having been involved in a

firearms

shootout confrontation with Tarrants in 1969.

The committee pressed for further details concerning

this shootout and the committee was advised that in

august, 1y0y, larrants and two other inmates of the

Mississippi State Penitentiary (MSP), Parchman, Mississippi,

escaped from that penitentiary and were thereafter subjects

of an unlawful flight to avoid confinement investigation,

and were considered by the FBl to be Federal fugitives.

The committee was advised that in August, 1969, information

was received by the Jackson, Mississippi, Office that the

chree escapees were hiding in a heavily wooded dense area

near Jackson, Mississippi.

Thereafter, SA Sammon and

many other Jackson, Mississippi, Agents attempted to

locate and apprehend Tarrants and the two other inmates,

which attempts resulted in a gun battle, causing.

one of the inmates, name unrecalled, to

be killed by

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE

ON ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA)

The committee was advised that this was SA Sammon's

rirst and last contact with larrants.

SA Sammon

in answer to specific questions, advised that he hac

no personal knowledge of the acts of Tarrants performed

on a residence of a Jewish businessman in Meridian,

SA Sammon was then questioned regarding the

availability of FBI informants to other Federal or

local law

enforcement agencies, and the Bureau policy

as pertaining to that availability. SA Sammon advised

the committee that it is the practice of the FBI,

as well as. other law enforcement agencies, not to

reveal the identity of Bureau informants to those

agencies, even though the information furnished by

those informants may be disseminated to those agencies.

The committee at this point took exception with

SA Sammon indicating it was their feeling that the FBI

"receives all information but does not share information"

with other law enforcement agencies, Federal,

local.

and

The committee at this point was unequivocally

advised that this has not and is not the case of the FBI,

and that information obtained by the FBI which is of an

interest to those agencies, is disseminated to them,

even though the identity of the informant furnishing

such information is not revealed to those agencies.

SA Sammon was again asked for his knowledge

as to the availability of Bill Somerset to the Intelligence

Unit of the Miami, Florida, Police Department, to which

SA Sammon again advised that he was not aware of such

availability during the years of 1961-1964, the only

period that SA Sammon was acquainted with Somerset.

SA Sammon was asked as to the degree of

2153

confidence and reliability regarding the information

furnished by Somerset while an FBI informant.

SA Sammon

advised from 1961-1964, it was his opinion that the

information furnished by Somerset was reliable, and that

SA Sammon had confidence in that information.

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE

ON ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA)

At one point during the questioning, when

SA Sammon was being questioned as to squad assignment

classifications,

and identities of Agents of the Miami,

Florida, FBI Office from 1961-1964, SA Sammon advised

the committee that as that period of time was from

14-17 years in the past, SA Sammon would try to be as

accurate as possible as

recollection of the events may be six months to perhaps

a year off. Mark Speiser advised SA Sammon that the

committee would only allow a four month leeway. This

comment may have been misunderstood by SA Sammon and

may have been in jest by speiser; however, in any regard,

Speiser was advised that SA Sammon stood on his previous

statement that events occurring 14-17 years ago would be

timed as accurately as SA Sammon possibly could; however,

there

would be no

'four month allowance"

imposed

on SA Sammon, unless the committee intended to furnish

him documentary verification.

There was no such

documentary verification furnished SA Sammon during

his interrogation, with the exception of SA Sammon

being furnished a

The Honorable Griffin B. Bell

Attorney General of the United States

Department of Justice

Washington, D. C.

Attention: Mr. Robert L. Keuch

Deputy Assistant Attorney General.

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

336356

By letter dated December 13, 1977, this Committee re-

quested that the Department of Justice and the Federal

of Investigation, respectively, provide the Committee with docu-

ments and lists of attorneys and agents relative to a) the FBI,

COINTELPRO program directed against DI. Martin Luther King,

and b) the MURKIN investigation.

By January 25, 1978, the FBI had complied with that

portion of the request which pertained to its files and its

agents.

However,

the Department of Justice has yet to supply

the similar materials requested of it. Any further delay in com-

pliance

will begin to interfere substantially with the efforts

of this Committee to resolve in a professional and thorough

enforcement and activities in the conduct.of the MURKIN Invest-

gation. Therefore, in order to avoid a delay with such effects,

it is necessary that the Department of Justice comply with this.-

Committee's request of December 13, 1977 by no later than April

10, 1978.

BY letter dated 2/6/78, it was requested that the FBI

provide this Committee copies of all bank records secured in

the investigation of certain members of the Ray family.

In

FBI memorandum dated March 1, 1978, reference was made

to the

Bureau having included John Raynes

(father) in the bank records

search. It has come to our attention, subsequently, that spe-.

cific records of John Raynes were secured by the St. Louis

Field Office in connection with their investigation;

oddly

those bank records do not appear in the materials furnished

3/1/78. In view of these facts, it is hereby requested that

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE

ON ASSASSINATIONS

(HSCA)

Special Agent (SA) Richard D. Rackleff,

Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Atlanta

Division, was contacted telephonically on

March 17, 1978 by Robert Walker who identified

himself as a Staff Investigator for the House Select

Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) • Walker made

arrangements to meet with SA Rackleft at the

intersection of North Avenue and Spring Street, Atlanta,

Georgia, at 11:00 AM on Monday, March 20, 1978.

Walker stated he would be in the

Staff Investigator whom he identified as Mr. Reeves,

a black male.

At 11:00 AM on March 20, 1978, SA Rackleff

met with Robert Walker and Floyd Reeves, both of

whom displayed credentials identifying themselves

• to be members of the Investigative Staff of the U. S.

Congress.

Reeves conducted the questioning and requested

the information relating to the neighborhood canvassing

conducted by SA Rackleff in the vicinity of North

Highland Street and Ponce de Leon Avenue in April,

1968.

Reeves inquired as to the person or persons

coordinating the investigation conducted in the Atlanta

Division and specifically asked whether other areas

of Atlanta were canvassed in addition to this one

particular area.

Reeves specifically asked if other

areas which were identified by markings on a map

recovered from the apartment of James Earl Ray were

canvassed in addition to this one area near North

Highland Avenue and Ponce de Leon.

SA Rackleff explained he could not recall •

specifically how many markings were on the map, but

believed there were basically four areas marked.

He stated three of these markings were identifiable

as being significant to the approximate location

of the home and church of Doctor Martin Luther King,

JI. and the apartment of James Earl Ray. The fourth

marking on the map as recalled by SA Rackleff was

not significant or identifiable with any known activity

of either James Earl Ray or Dr. King, and therefore

an extremely thorough, door-to-door survey was conducted

in an area well beyond the boundaries of the fourth

marking on the map. Each and every adult member

of each household was contacted and interviewed concerning

any knowledge or association with James Earl Ray

or Dr. Martin Luther King. Photographs of Ray were

displayed

and

as best as could be recalled, there

was no pertinent information developed specifically

identifying any associates of either James Earl Ray

or DI. King.

The Special Agent in Charge of the Atlanta

Division was identified as Frank Hitt, and the Assistant

Special Agent in Charge at that time was identified

as Jack

• Keith, JI.

Mr. Reeves requested an additional interview.

'of SA Rackleff in the Conference Room at the Headquarters

of the Atlanta Police Department at 3:00 PM on that

same date for the purpose of displaying a replica

of the map recovered from Ray's apartment. At 3:00

PM, a second interview was conducted. by Mr.. Reeves

and Mr. Walker.

Mr. Reeves displayed what he

identified to be a replica of the map recovered from

Pay's apartment in April, 1968 and also displayed

a legal sized handwritten paper showing separate

investigations conducted by. SA Harry Lee, SA James

Riordan, and SA Rackleff in 1968.

The investigation

by SA Rackleff identified the streets and addresses

canvassed during the neighborhood investigation.

SA Rackleff explained that he reported to the Atlanta

Office in about January 1968, and at the time of

the investigation of the King

assassination, he was

not familiar with

the streets and locations. SA

Rackleff was unable to recall specifically observing

the map displayed by Mr. Reeves, however, did

identify three of the general areas marked as being

the approximate location of the home and church of

Dr. King and the apartment of James Earl Ray near

14th Street and Peachtree Street, N.E.

The fourth

marking on the map was identified as the area in

which SA Rackleff conducted

the above described

neighborhood

investigation.

SA Rackleff expressed his full and complete

cooperation with the investigation of Mr. Walker

and Mr. Reeves and Mr. Reeves stated they were very

much appreciative and might request additional

interviews at a later date.

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE

ON ASSASSINATIONS

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SPECIAL

AGENT LEONARD C. PETERSON

On March 24, 1978, I, Leonard C. Peterson, former

Special Agent of the Miami Office of the Federal Bureau of

Investigation, was interviewed by Peter G. Beeson, Staff

Counsel, Richard C. Wrose and Mark Speiser, investigators

for the House Select Committee on Assassinations at the

Airways Motel, Miami, Florida.

I furnished general information about my Bureau

career, offices of assignment and arrival in Miami, Florida,

office in April, 1960.

in Miami, I

a highly placed extremist source,

in the Miami Division, and

continued in this assignment until the Fall of 1961: I

related the following information to the investigators to

the best of my recollection.

Sommersett was discontinued in late 1961 for his

personal safety and possible embarrassment to the Federal

Bureau of Investigation.

Sommersett was characterized as a

source who had furnished reliable information in the past

and, in addition, had furnished information which could not

be verified or corroborated.

Sommersett's work for the

Federal

Bureau of Investigation covered a span of twelve to

•police corruption. He later worked out of the Charlotte

Division furnishing information on criminal matters and

Klan activities in the eastern part of the North and South

Carolinas. Following his work in the Charlotte Division,

Sommersett came to the Miami Division where he furnished

some criminal information, possible violations of labor

matters and principally worked during the last two. or

three years as a source on extremist matters covering

the southeastern section of the United States.

Sommersett

made some fourteen or more trips out of the Miami Division

to various states in the southeast including Georgia,

Louisiana, Tennessee, Mississippi and North Carolina,

reporting on Klan organizations and leaders of white Hate

Groups.

• After Sommersett was discontinued, he continued

to furnish information that he felt was of interest to

the Federal Bureau of Investigation even though he was

never reimbursed for this information.

Contact with the Federal Bureau of Investigation

was initiated by sommersett and as time passed he initiated

Iewer and fewer contacts. After Sommersett had been dis-

continued he notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation

about a group responsible for the bombing at the home of

Donald Shoemaker, Editor of the "Miami Herald". This

information was furnisned to the Miami Police Department

and Sommersett was placed in contact with the Intelligence

Unit of the Miami Police Department who continued the

bombing investigation, utilizing Sommersett and other

sources.

This later resulted in the prosecution and

conviction of two individuals involved in the bombing.

The Miami Police Department continued to use

sommersett on extremist matters, including trips they sent

him on to other states.

The extent of the information

developed by Sommersett and subsequently furnished to

the Miami Division is not clear.

Some information was

furnished; however, there was a feeling that the Miami

Police Department was reluctant to furnish information

developed by Sommersett since they were utilizing him

outside of their jurisdiction.

The investigators were primarily interested in

information developed by Sommersett on or about April 5,

1908, in Washington, D.C., to the effect that Martin Luther

King was to be assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee.

not recall having received this information from the

Miami Police Department or Sommersett. I vaguely recall

that something to this effect did come up later, but I

am unable to put it in any time frame and why I only

vaguely recall such a development. The investigators

exhibitea to me a memorandum, dated April 25, 1968, from

Sergeant Sapp of the Miami Police Department to Chief

Headley of the Miami Police Department. This memorandum

related a call from Sommersett to Sergeant Sapp on or

about April 4, 1968, reporting on Sommersett's trip to

Washington, D.C., where he learned of a plot to assassinate

Martin Luther King. The memorandum goes on to state that

the Miami Police Department sent Sommersett to Atlanta,

Georgia, to make contact with White. Hate Groups in an

effort to develop additional information on the assassination

of Martin Luther King. I do not recall having previously

seen this memorandum or if a copy was furnished to the

Miami Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Following the interview, I was advised that I

would be notified in the event I am needed to testify at

an open hearing in Washington, D.C., before the House

Select Committee on Assassinations:*

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

U. S, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (HSCA) /

On March 17, 1978, Special Agent Jim Haggerty,

St. Louls Fleld Supervisor, was contacted regarding additional

information concerning this matter:

St. Louis informant had spoken with russell George Beyers

poken at russele

Haggerty advised that

who is a lence in the st. Louis area: Beyers was opened

as a source (SL 137-16541; Bufile unknown) on occodel. J,

1975, and closed November, 1976. A copy of the original

source contact memorandum was placed in Beyers' Informant.

file and an 87-file, however, there is no evidence that Beyers

was ever questioned

about the meeting with the deceased

St. Louls attorney. Additionally, there 1s no evidence that

this Information was éver acted on or disseminated outside the

St. Louls Office.

Beyers was arrested approximately two

weeks ago by the

St. Louis Police Department as suspect in

a st. Louis museum burglary and this precipitated the

file review which surfaced the information in question.

Haggerty stated that both the Agent and Supervisor who handled

original contact memorandum with St. Louis Informant have

retired.

The original St. Louis Informant (SL 3167-C; Bufile

137-36945) to whom Beyers spoke has been closed as an informant

and is residing in Chicago, Illinois.

Response regarding Beyers' Informant status was

coordinated with Special Agent Jeff Jamar, Criminal Informant

Unit, DivisIon Six.

A search was made of the central records index for

Russell George Beyers.

The only reference to Beyers was in

Buffle 07-129497-11, which concerned Beyers' possible

Involvement in fencing the proceeds from a st. Louis museum

theft. No Bureau informant file was located.

Original St. Louis letterhead memorandum dated

March 13, 1978, contained informant symbol number,

and

St. Louis and Bureau Informant file numbers, and was, therefore,

retyped with this information deleted,

As the HSCA is expected to have an Intense Interest

In this information, It 1s being furnished in memorandum form

through the Department to the Committee.
