1. In discussing the paragraph 3 requirement in

reference A for names of the Chiefs and Deputy Chiefs of

the 6 Research Section in 1960-62 with one of the former

Deputy Branch Chiefs of SR-6, we were made aware of the fact

that SR-6 had

a Section called the Research Section which

later was called the Operational Support Section. We had been

under the impression that the HSCA was interested in the

identities of the Chiefs and Députy Chiefs of SR-6, which was

provided under reference C.

2. As nearly as we can determine at this time, the

Research Section of SR-6 had no Chief or Deputy in 1960.

Mr. Rudolph Balaban

was made

Section Chief from September

1961-62. Mr. Balaban resigned in 1970 and

we have no

address. He had been assigned to the Section from August

1960 to April 1964.

3. One of the ranking officers in the Section and an.

Acting

Hayes,

Chief was Mr. Donald E. Poole, retired, c/o Marvin

3006 Scotty Drive, Jacksonville, Florida 32216,

(904) 731-3967.

In June 1962, the Research Section became

Operational Support Section.

Assigned to the Section was

Mr. Richard L. Winch, retired, 11707 Tifton Drive, Potomac,

Maryland 20854, 299-3530. He was assigned from October 1960

5. Other member of the Section included:

January 1964)

April 1964 or December 1966)

Section or in any of the personnel mentioned.
