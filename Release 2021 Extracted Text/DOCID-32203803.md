had indicated in writing to Chief, CIOPS, that he has no

objection for Mr. Belin to do whatever is desired with

these photographs at this time. It should be noted that

Mr. Fensterwald in 1971 - 1972 was actually shown, by

Mr. Houston during a visit to the Agency, two of the

twelve photographs, other than the one already published

in the Warren Commission report.

(It is these two.that

he has published in The New York Review of Books acticle

which Mr. Belin attaches to his memorandum.)

â€¢It seems to me that whoever makes a decision on

whether the entire matter can be fully disclosed at this

time should bear in mind that a subsidiary decision must

also be made, i.e., whether to crop or otherwise fuzz up

the background of the photographs or, alternatively, to

publish the entire run of. the photographs for the first

alternat trel tiest

time without taking out the background. Obviously, none

of these questions apply to the passage of this material

to Mr. Belin and the Rockefeller Commission itself:

think they should see the entire documentation as it

stands.

Perhaps after that, the question of what could

be discussed and the question of "how?" and "how much?"

could be taken up with Mr. Belin himself.

My personal

recommendation is that the more we can say about this

matter in a fully open and final manner, the better off

we will be as an Agency. But it is my understanding

that there are still sensitive

aspects deriving from the

fact that the operation which produced the photographs

was jointly'en with mextcan liaison

nand as a consequence

publication

at this time would create additional problems

at that level in Mexico. Also, it should be noted that

the Ambassador, according to Win Scott's memorandum to

J.C. King on 22 November 1963 (see Item 8 in the backup

documentation), allegedly played a direct role in the

decision to put the photographs into the hands of the FBI

at any time in the past nor have we had any discussions

with the State Department about that aspect of the matter.
