ARE DEFINITIVE, APPRAISAL OF CONTENT IS ICN

1. AS OF 38 NOVEMBER 1963, ERNESTO "CHE" (GUEVARA) SERNA WAS

ALLEGED TO BE UNDER HOUSE ARREST BECAUSE OF POSSIBLE INVOLVEMENT IN

AN ANTI-CASTRO PLOT IN WHICH OMAR (FERNANDEZ) CAIZARES WAS

ALSO SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED. FERNANDEZ IS SAID TO HAVE

BEEN REMOVED FROM THE MINISTERSHIP OF TRANSPORTATION BECAUSE OF

THIS INVOLVEMENT.

2. FIDEL CASTRO RUZ MAY BE ATTEMPTING TO EJECT GUEVARA FROM

CUBA UNDER SOME SUITABLE PRETEXT; ONCE THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED CASTRO

INTENDS TO CHARGE GUEVARA AND FERNANDEZ, AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE

GOVERNMENT OF CUBA WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CUBAN ECONOMIC

3. FIELD CONMENT: BECAUSE OF THE CLOSE PERSONAL RELATTONSHIP

BETWEEN THE SOURCE OF THE INFORMATION IN PARAGRAPH 1 AND THE SOURCE

OF THE INFORMATION IN PARAS 2 AND 4, THIS INFORMATION CANNOT BE

CONSIDERED CONFIRMATORY. THERE HAVE BEEN VARIOUS SCATERED REPORTS

FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES WHICH HAVE INDICATED DISAGREEMENTS AMONG

THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT HIERARCHY. THERE SCEMS TO BE SOME SUPPORT FOR

A THEORY THAT FIDEL CASTRO IS ONCE AGAIN TRYING TO PURGE THE

HIERARCHY OF OLD LINE COMMUNISTS. THE EXPULSION OF JUAN (MARINELLO)

VIQAURETTA FROM HIS POSITION AS RECTOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF HABANA:

IS VIEWED IN SOME QUARTERS AS AN INDICATION OF SUCH A PURGE. 17 HAS

ALSO BEEN INTIMATED THAT FIDEL CASTRO WILL TRY TO GET RID OF SUCH PARTY

STALWARTS AS BLAS ROCA AND LAZARO PENA IN ACTIONS SIMILAR TO THE

ANIBAL ESCALANTE AFFAIR. THERE WAS ONE RUMOR TO THE EFFECT

THAT FIUEL CASIRO HIMSELF HAD REGENILY VISITCO INE SUVILT UNION,

THIS RUMOR WAS STRENGHTENED BY THE FACT THAT NEITHER FIDEL NOR RAUL

ATTENDED THE SOVIET EMBASSY PARTY FOR THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE GREAT.

OCTODER REVOLUTION, AND THAT FIDEL HAS NOT BEEN MAKING AEPEARANCES OR

MELTING PEOPLE, WHERE NORMALLY HE WOULD DE THE GREETER. ONE REPORTING

BOURGE FROM CUBA ALSO INDICATCO THAT HAD TIDEL SEEN IN CUBA HE, RATHER

INFORMATION IS RECEIVED IT WOULD BE WELL TO TREAT THE INFORMAT

ON THE POSSIDLE HOUSE ARREST OF GUEVARA AS A MERE RUMOR.

4. THE SPJUP OF PERSONAL TIES IN THE GOVERNMENT OF CUBA WHO AR

PLANNING THE OVERTHROW OF CASTRO ARE KNOWN AS "LOS JURAMENTADOS".

5. FIELD COMMENT: LOS "URAMENTADOS IS BELIEVED TO BE AN

ORGANIZATION WHICH NUMBERS AMONG ITS MEMBERS FORMER MEMBERS OF

26 JULY MOVEMENT. SOME FORMER CUBAN MILITARY OFFICERS WHO ARE

NOW IN EXILE, CLAIM MEMBERSHIP IN THIS ORGANZATION. THERE IS NO

INFORMATION RELATIVE TO THE EXISTENCE OF A LOS JURAMENTADOS

ORGANIZATION WITHIN CUBA.

6. FIELD DISSEM, NONE.
