Testing of Subject's skill as a pilot revealed, however,

that he was not quallfied for the intended assignment.

He was returned to the U.S. on ll February 1966

without baving been used operationally.

profitoaring in narcotics and gun-ruming was implicated

In the BBBASsinatlOn." The close GArTiBON-TurNer

association and Garlaon's vouching for the accuracy

of the Ramparts account suggest that GarIlsON may

make similaI assertions when his case comas to trial.

Leraville, Louisiana, to the Cuban Ambassador la

Mesico.. He offered information about the "Cuban Raider

Command" and the "People'& Revolutionary Movernent"

in exchange for help in defecting to Cuba. He said that

GlA did not have the same information. Arrested on

16 May 1966 for investigation af auto theft. ASHWORTH

told an fBi special agent that he had participated in

several raíds on Cuba, that he ras a pilot and an expert

lo explosives, and that ClA was aware of his activities

sad could provide information about them. Arrested

again on 26 April 1967 for possession of a stolen

autorobile, ASHWORTH was sent to the jail in Lake

Charles, Louisiana. A fellow inmate, one Richard

PHILLIPS, wrote the FBI to say that ASHWORTH clalmed

to have shared an apartment in Ohio with Lee Harrey

Oswald, that Oswald and he belonged to & group of

New Orleans Cubans who lilled President Kennedy and

"Were supposed to kill Castro at the same time", that

Ramparts of January 1968, p. 47, states that a former

records, Maurice Brooke GATLIN SI. (see below) was

this national group. An FBI report of 14 February 1961

quoted BANISTER as saying that he had never been an

officer or member of the "group", GATLIN's clairas to

the contrary notwithstanding.

Dominican Republic in New Orleans, out of relatively

large sume in the late 19501ª. Morales seeras to have

considered him an agent representing the interests of

I'rajillo, although GATLIN was not so reglatered with

the Department of Justice, GATLIN usad the allanes

Edward FAIRCHILD, JaDies COCHRANE, Robert WATSON,

and Charles EVERETT. A typical eplaode occurred la

Novembes-December 1957, when GATLIN went to Eugene,

Oregon, because he had a theoty that Jesse De Galindes

(commonly belleved to have been kidnapped in New York

by Trujillo henchmen) was hiding out among Banque

sheep-herders there. On 2 December 1957 GAILIN

presented himself to an FBI special agent in Eugene and

said that "If he was found dead in Eugene it was murdes,

named his Agency contacts and the box number at the

Lafayette Street station they assigned him. He averred
