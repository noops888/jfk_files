UNE]

MARTTO and Nathaniel, spoke of a trip that MARTINO had made

to Cuba with an American nevapaper voman, one LAPIN and two CIA agents.

Nathaniel did not accompany them. It is PRISBECK'e opinion that Natheniel,

who is a covard, just welshed on the trip, but thet he did finance it.

The purpose of the triy was to contact a Cuban who was serving as liaisco

for the four Russian Generals in charge of training and organizing the

Cuban miltary. The Cuban, who net the grown in the water at the edge of

a beach in Cuba, told then that the four Generala wanted to escape and

seek asylum in the Untted States.

MARTINO 13 going ahead with a follow un plan whereby on a given

signal, he and a group will sall to Cuoz to pick up the Generald. Nathaniel

is going on s, long lecture tour and vill not be able to accompany the pick

up team to Cuba.

OSWALD coutacted the Cuban MI-6 by telephone fron a private bone in liani.

They alao know the man who furnished the information on OSWALD to the FBI.

Iron the reports given by the Cubans to this unknown indivlaus,

it seems very definite that RUBY went to Habana to make a shady deal with

e creature by the name of PRASKIN; who works tith the Cuban Commists and

who 1e also tied up with call girls In Cuba

A friend of Nathaniel WeXt, the ran for the presidency of Cuba

has no doubts about her being politically involved and also he thiaks that

Nathaniel knows that aiter OSWALD was refused s visa to the Soviet

Union, he made a quick trip inch Miseissippi to Cuba.

OSWALD returned from
