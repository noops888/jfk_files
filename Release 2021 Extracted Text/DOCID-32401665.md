(1) Mr. Willard Robertson. (Comment:

Robertson is a Volkswagen distributor for the

New Orleans area and a member of Truth and

Consequences Inc., a private association of

Garrison supporters who have donated funds to

Garrison's office. An FBI report of 10 October

1967 stated that Robertson wanted another

busineesman to file charges of theft or fraud

against Novel in connection with a $2, 700 diamond

ring in order to get Novel in jail and "under the

floor". )

(2) Mi. Elmer Gertz. (Comment: No prior

record in Garrison case.

Traces to be run.)

(3) Mr. Phillip Gabriel. (Comment: As above.)

(4) Mr. Walter Sheildan. (Comment: Has

appeared in prior reports on this subject. He is

an NBC investigator who was associated earlier

with the deceased Senator Robert Kennedy. Sheridan

NBC's anti-Garrison TV show of 19 June 1967, after

which Garrison charged Sherican with bribery.)

16r9,

Mrs. Abby Novel, 226 E. Oakland St., Columbus, Ohio.

5. Novel told Miss Marilley that he had been associated in

some way with Senator Robert Kennedy, (Comment: The reierence

may have been to Walter Sheridan, who served as an investigator

for Robert Kennedy when the latter was Attorney Gencral.)

7. Novel asked Miss Marilley whether she could nake

arrangemente for party or conference calls to pase from the

caller through the rented number in Waghington to Novel's actual

location and then to record the calls in Washington. She said no.

8. Novel listed his own current address as 566 E. Main St..

Suite A, Columbus, Ohio.

9. In mid-September 1968 Novel mentioned to Miss Marilley

that District Attorney Garrioon is associated with a finu Burnham

(no prior record in this context, although Richard V. Burnes is an

assistant DA for Garriaon), a fnu Roper (no prior record in this

context), and William Turner (a staff wilter for Ramparts who has

been closely associated with Garrison and his Investigation). Novel

also told Miss Marilley that he has a penetration of Garrison's

office. (Comment: He haa made thie claim earller.) Through the

penetration he learned that he was to appear prominently in a

Ramparts article which would liat him as a client of Courtesy

Associate and would also list Courtesy Associates as a cover or

front for CLA operations dealing with internal (i.e., domestic)

affairs. Novel told Miss Marilley not to be concerned because he

had sent word back to Garrison that if such an article appeared,

Courtesy Associates would sue. He later learned that the idea of

publishing such an article had been dropped. Ho told this story to

Miss Marilley with the air of ond who had done her a favor. Mise

Marilley had the Impression, however, that Novel himself did not

bellove the allegation about her firm and CLA.

10. Novel told Mies Marilley that he le working on a real estate

deal involving a planned report area in Michigan. It is noted that

two of tho telephone calls liated below were from a fnu Cork of Corke

in the Bureau of Indian Affalrs.

12. Miss Marilley said that she believed that she could obtain

additional information about Novel by writing to a triend of reis,

NI. Aaron M. Kohn, who is the managing director of the

Metropolitan Crine Commission in New Orleans. She asked whethe:

there was any objection to her doing so. She was told that there

was no objection as long as her inquiry was couched within the

frame of reference of her own business and had nothing to co with

CIA. She then penned a note to Mr. Kohn, inquiring about Novel

as a custorner of her service and read it aloud. She was assured

that there was no objection. She added that Mr. Kohn had done fine

jobs of cleaning up first Denver, then New Orleans. (Comment:

Kohn is a firm antagonist of Garrison.) Miss Marilley cautioned

that she may not get a reply for several weeks. She will give CLA

any information about Novel that Kohn may provide.

13. Novel's motives remain obscure.

As was reported earlier.

there is a clear possibility that he rerained an ally of Garrison

after their seeming antagonism developed. If 80, his efforts to link

himself publicly with ClA could be part of Garrison's attack upon

the Agency, This theory would also explain Novel'e relationship to a

Garrison crony like Willard Robertson. Another poscibility is that

the feud do genuine. (Novel has made very strong accusations against

Garrison in major radio broadcasts; these include charges of

occasional homosexuality and possible direct involvement in the

alleged murder of David Ferrie.) Miss Marilley formed a clear

impression that Novel's dislike of Garrison is genuine. If so, his

persistent attempts to link himself to ClA may be part of a campaign

to creato for International Dynamica Corporation an aura of prestige

as a result of supposed ties to the federal government.

He listed the

U.S. government with Courtesy Associates as one of his cliente. His

relationship to Willard Robertson might then be explained by hie

repeatod assertion that he has a penctration in Garrison's entourage.
