SUMMARY

PCI FRANK COLLINS advised SA JOHN W. REINHARD

that he received information from a source he considers

reliable and

who would be in a position to obtain informa-

cion concerning subject, to the

effect that the subjec

during 1961 was

Instrumental in bringing GEORGI LANZEITA.

a gambler from Massachusetts into the Scranton,

Pa., area.

This was done because BUFALINO at the time was in need of

LANZETTA, using information from track areas and

sure bets, hit the bookies in the Scranton area very badly.

Finally the bookies refused to accept any bets from LANZETTA.

LANZETTA left area at end of 1961 and reportedly has returned

to Massachusetts.

The activities of LANZETTA, according to

the informant, were with and on behalf of the subject.
