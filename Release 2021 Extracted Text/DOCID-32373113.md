primary elections.

This past Thursday night a Mrs. Sherwood

telephoned

indicating she was one of the Delegates

on the Republican ballot and was supporting Senator Barry

Goldwater.

told Mrs. Sherwood that she had not

decided which candidate to support, and that although she had

registered Republican she held a deep respect for the late

President Kennedy.

Mrs. Sherwood then made some disparaging

remarks about the

late President Kennedy.

She also furnished

specific information regarding what she described as a

reliable prediction,

made prior to November 1963, that

President Kennedy would be assassinated.

3.

Mrs. Sherwood indicated that an acquaintance in West

Virginia, who said he was a former CIA courier, had told her

prior to

the assassination of President Kennedy that President

Kennedy would be assassinated and that the assassin in turn

would also be killed.

Mrs. Sherwood further advised, according

,that her attempts to locate this person in

West Virginia, after the assassination, were not successful.

Apparently, in Mrs.

Sherwood's words, this person "just dis-

appeared from sight", following the assassination of President

Kennedy.
