Dear Bob:

Herewith are comments on the Nosenko draft.

In conmencing, it should be noted that Tennent Bagley remains

under cover, retired abroad. We are obliged to honor that cover,

which he has not moved to have modified. To expose his true

status as a former CIA employee could have reparcussions in his

present situation that we must accept as significant. When he

was here in November 1978, he was advised of steps necessary

to remove his cover, in the everit he decided to go overt in this

matter; he took no steps to alter his cover status.

It remains

classified. We therefore request that the example set in the

Hart testimony, of referring to Mr. Bagley by the title of Deputy

Chief, SB Division, be followed in this draft.

Following are detailed comments:

NOSENKO

Testimony of Nosenko

s".

Circled Page 3, lines 14 ard 17, depending on how one counts.

KGB agents should read KGB officers.

Circled Page 4, lines 3 through 20. Suggest the following

rewrite:

There were two factors, however, that limited the value

of the information supplied to the Committee by these

ex-KGB officers: 1) neither had been assigned to the

same KGB Directorate as Nosenko, and 2) one of them had

information about the KGB that was outdated.

Circled Page 6. Nosenko's actual testimony, last response. Suggest

changing word "defectionist" to "defector.

Page 6, line 6. Delete "woman in Utah" and insert "individual."

Page 6, lines 20 and 21. Delete "and even was a co-op from CIA."
