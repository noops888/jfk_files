Approximately two months ago, subject was offered the

position of Security Investigator by Mr. SIDNEY T. TELFORD, Regional

Security Officer (RSO), American Embassy, Caracas,

Venezuela.

posion involves conducting background investigations of local-hire

employees for the U. S. Embassy and other duties.

Subject currently resides in Curacao, Netherlands Antilles,

where he is under contract with the Netherlands Antilles Government

as Director of Training for the Netherlands Antilles Police Force

(NAPF), which position he has held for the past two years.

job with the American Embassy, Caracas, was to begin at the termina-

tion of his current contract with NAPF.

-When personally contacted by Mr. TELFORD in Curacao

approximately three weeks ago, subject stated he was looking forward

to his job at the American Embassy, and would report for duty in a

few days.

all efforts. by the RSO and others

to contact him have been futile.

It should be noted that attempts

. to contact his wife have also met with negative results.

- Mr. RICHARD MARTINEZ, Narcotics Coordinator, Agency for

International Development (AID), American Embassy, Caracas, who has

known and worked with subject for eleven years, states the

apparent

disappearance, to be completely out of character for CASTILLEJO, and

strongly suspects the possiblity of foul play. Both MARTINEZ and

TELFORD point out that in Curacao subject was

in contact with top-

Level government officials, including the Minister of Interior and

the Minister of Justice,

and could have become privy to information

concerning illicit activities by these individuals, noting that

their approval is needed to establish gambling casinos, obtain

licenses to manage casinos, and

to own orioperate hotels in the

Netherlands Antilles.

schemes to launder LCN money through the

Netherlands Antilles.

On the last attempt to contact subject and his wife, RSO

and MARTINEZ were told by NAPF authorities that the minister of

justice considered subject's contract to be indefinite, and further,

that no attempt to contact

subject should be made in the future,

and refused to state where subject was currently located. Attempts

to contact subject through his family in Caracas have been negative.

It appears unlikely that Netherlands Antilles authorities

would have placed subject in isolation merely in order to prevent

him from accepting a position with the U. S. Embassy in Caracas.

However, because of subject's high-level contacts in government

circles in the Netherlands Antilles, he could possibly have come

into possession of information concerning corruption or political

intrigue that would make it advisable forthem to keep him in

Curacao if at all possible.

Both RSO and Mr. MARTINEZ strongly feel that subject's

disappearance is directly connected with his intention to take a

position with the U. S. Embassy at Caracas.
