who operates the casino during the continued absence of his brother,

MEYER LANSKY. On August 20, 1959, HAV-33 observed SANTO TRAFFICANTE

and HENRY SAAVEDRA with JACK LANSKY and numerous other gamblers

drinking a toast, apparently celebrating the release of TRAFFICANTE

and HENRY SAAVEDRA from jail..

On August 28, 1959, Lt. GEORGE NOBREGAS, in representa-

tion of the Department of Public Order, Ministry of Gobernacion,

inquired as to whether or not SANTO TRAFFICANTE was wanted by the

Federal Bureau of Investigation or other competent police au-

thority in the United States:

still had TRAFFICANTE under technical arrest considering his de-

portation but a prerequisite to deportation was that there be

a warrant outstanding for the arrest of the subject in the country

to which he was to be deported. By letter dated August 31, 1959, /

the Department of Public Order was advised that there was no

record in the Identification Division or Bureau Fugitive Indices

of any outstanding want or arrest order for subject. Lt. NOBREGAS

reported on September 2, 1959, that subject was at complete liberty

and his department contemplated no further action in the case of

SANTO TRAFFICANTE.

PCI ALBERTO SUAREZ ALEMAN advised Legal Attache JAMES T

HAVERTY on

August 29, 1959, that TRAFFICANTE is again residing

at Calle 12 No. 20, Apartment 20, where he has very few visitors

and very seldom

leaves his apartment.

Re: Havana 92-1

10/20/59

Hav-33 reported that on August 21, 1959, at the Casino

Capri HENRY SAAVEDRA, SANTO TRAFFICANTE, JOHN WILLIAMS (Boston Top

to the Havana Airport of Rancho Boyeros. HAV-33 also reported

there was some discussion regarding the possibility of TRAFFICANTE's

opening the Oriental Park Race Track in Marianao; however, the

"Havana Post", and several other public sources, announced on

September 23, 1959, that DAN CHAPPELL, described

as a former

President of

the Florida State Breeders Association and one-time

candidate for Florida State Governorship, planned to invest

$1,500,000 in Oriental Park, and newspapers officially announced

on October 7, 1959, that DAN CHAPPELL signed a 15-year contract

on the previous day for the operation of Oriental Park. There

has been no indication that TRAFFICANTE is in any way connected

with the same, and HAV-33 has been unable to develop any informa-

tion indicating any interest of TRAFFICANTE in the race track.

On September 5, 1959, HAV-33 reported SANTO TRAFFICANTE

was in the casino of the Hotel Comodoro talking with his manager,

BENNY FERNANDEZ, and SAMMY MONDELO.

These two individuals are

described by informant as being from Tampa, Florida, and are

very much in the confidence of subject.

On September 15, 1959, informant reported that at the

casino of the Hotel Capri

TRAFFICANTE was present with HENRY

SAAVEDRA, MARVIN KRAUSE, ANGELO DE CRISTOFARO, and numerous other

gamblers, including JOHN WILLIAMS. Informant

mentioned that one

of the important American gamblers who left Cuba because he was

afraid of deportation was CHARLES WHITE, aka Charles Tourine.

A Cuban friend advised informant he had heard from TOURINE in

Europe, at which time TOURINE was inquiring regarding the gam-

bling

situation in Cuba and the possibilities of returning.

Through October 5, 1959, nothing of any significance

regarding activities or movements

of SANTO TRAFFICANTE was reported,

although his presence in Havana continued to be noted. It has

continued to be uniformly reported by HAV-33 and various other

sources, and it has been noted by personal observation, that the

gambling business is very poor at this time and almost

no American

tourists are observed in the various gambling casinos in Havana.

Sufficient copies of this letter are furnished for the

information of Albany, Miami, and New York.
