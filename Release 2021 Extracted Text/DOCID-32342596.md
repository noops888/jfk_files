•are copies of two articles from the New York Daily News by Paul

NESKIC, dated circa April 1975 and 13 June 1976,

specifying

that one Marie LORENZ was involved with Frank STURGIS and Alex

RORKE in 1959/1960 in anti-CASTRO activities.: Furthermore, the

articles again allege that STURGIS and RORKE were acting on

behalf of this Agency. The 13 June 1976 article further alleges

Marie LORENZ has claimed that at the direction of STURGIS and

RORKE (and the Agency and the FBI) in 1960 she went to Cuba to

poison CASTRO.

first article Marie LORENZ alleges that E. Howard HUNT,

to her as "Eduardo" was the paymaster for STURGIS and RORKE.

HUNT has publicly claimed not knowing STURGIS until at least

the late 1960's.

There is no evidence in this file that RORKE

was ever affiliated with this Agency.
