SAMUEL M. GIANCANA

ANTI-RACKETEERING

criminal informant, James Batmore,

The Chicago Office-has learned from a

potential

, that Patmore was visited

at his home on the evening of August 10, 1966, by Giancana

and Fiore Bucciert another notorious Chicago hoodlum.

According to the informant, they solicited his assistance

in killing another unidentified Chicago hoodlum, who was

reportedly in New York.

Patmore agreed to undertake,

this assignment, which

time in the future. (L"as to take place at an unspecified

On the night of August 11, 1966, Patmore met with

Buccieri and another unknown individual introduced as Tony.

"The Bull" At that meeting, Patmore was told by Buccieri

that Tony, "The Bull" would accompany him to New York for

the?killing, which was to take place within two weeks; and

forgwhich Patmore would be paid $2,600. (U)

On the morning of August 15, 1966, SAC Marlin

Johnson of Chicago called to advise that Patmore-had again

been contacted by Buccieri and Tony "The Bull" on the night

of august 14, 1966, at which time they told him the person

to be killed was Butch, Blasi, a notorious Chicago hoodlum

Jand heretofore a

- assoclate of Giancana. According

to the intormant, Blasi has been stealing funds from the

Chicago organization while Giancana was in jail and,

therefore, his execution has been ordered.

At the same

time, the

informat was told that the

killing of Blasi is

¡to take place tonight in Chicago.(U/

Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach

Re:

Samuel M. Giancana

of a gangland slaying. Nevertheless, we have a responsi-

bility to alert local

authorities to an impending gangland

murder. (C)

The informant, Patmore, has advised our Chicago

office that he has no intention of going through with any

gangland slaying and he intends to become "ill" so as to

avoid any involvement in this slaying. An illness on the

part of the informant could delay the plans to kill Blasi,

but would not eliminate him entirely from any future

Accordingly, it is believed that

if Patmore's parole board called him in and questioned him

concerning his activities and associates with the idea of

revocation of parole, if necessary, that his involvement

in this matter would

be voluntarily terminated by Giancana

and Buccieri. (V)

SAC Johnson believes that he can disseminate

this information concerning the planned murder to State's Ill!

Attorney Daup accon a confidential basis, thus accomplishing I

notification to authorities and at the same time arranging

for parole board action against Patmore which should serve

to eliminate him from involvement in this planned killing.(U)

ACTION:

SAC Marlin Johnson is being instructed to furnish

the foregoing to the State's Attorney Dan Ward, Cook County,

on a confidential basis and arrange, if possible, for Patmore

to be called in by his parole board with the idea of

revocation of parole today. Patmore, the informant, is

presently on parole on local bad check charges.

He has

previously been

involved in a killing while incarcerated

in Tennessee. (U)
