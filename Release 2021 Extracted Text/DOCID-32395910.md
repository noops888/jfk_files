I. Operational

There was no substantive change in Subject's modus

operandi or in his relations with JMHAvE.

Development of Jesus "PACHECO Gonzales as a possible'

infil candidate was suspended when PM Branch indicated that he

lacked the prerequisite technical knowledge and experience.

to full ternination, Subject will arrange for PACHECO's turnover

to a PM case officer for an interview which will determine whether

PACHECO might manifest certain qualities which were not evident

in his dossier but which night be accepted as equivalent to the

usual recruitment prerequisites.

If the results of this inter-

view are negative, contact with PACHECO will be dropped.

3.

Pedro MARTINEZ Fraga, who had indicated in May that

he would be a penetration of the

residual CRC, had second thoughts

in June, and told Subject that he would prefer to retain discre-

tion on

the anount and type of information he would pass.

there had been no binding commitments made to MARTINEZ by Subject,

it was decided to revert to the previous relationship in which

the former occasionally supplied information on a voluntary basis.

Subject assumes that his recruitment pitch was accepted for lack

of any real reason on the part of MARTINEZ to refuse, but that':

after mulling the whole thing over MARTINEZ decided that he did

not want to be bound by such an agreement, and was honest enough

to cancel it in a straightforward manner.

II. Production

during June:

UFG-3006 (cable) frow Frank Fiorini, "Planned

Raid on Cuba by DIAZ Lanz brothers"

UFG-3089 (cable) from Jose ARIOLA, "Connando

Invasion of Cuba a Hoax".

UFG-3108 (cable) from Frank Fiorini, "Current

'Activities of Frank Fiorini".

5. In addition to the above, Subject conducted lengthy

debriefings of several UR executives who cane out of asylum in

These were very valuable as operational data for the handl.

ing of JMWAVE relations with that organization.

been of considerable assistance in general legwork among the

various Cuban exile individuals and groups who are not otherwise

easily accessible to JwAVE.

June ($500 minus withholding for income tax):

IV. Future Plans

Subject has shown

a flair for intensive debriefing of

operational prospects in addition to his demonstrated ability in

extensive sampling of opinion and intention in the Cuban exile

comnunity.

It is planned to assign him a nunber of operational
