FROM : Chief, Houston Office

HOU-251-67

DATE: 27 December 1967

SUBJECT: James Garrison/George

Brown--Possible Attempt

to Embarrass Agency

1. This confirms Haynes/Grant telecon of 27 December 1967.

2. Herbert Frensley, President

of Brown and Root, Inc., reported

to Haynes on 26 December that Mr. George Brown had received a disturbing

telephone call on Friday, 22 December 1967 from Hugh Aynesworth, Houston

Bureau reporter for Newsweek Magazine. Aynesworth told Brown that he had

received information from Bill Gervage (spelling?), former assistant to

New Orleans District Attorney James Garrison, that

Garrison might try to

implicate Brown in the "Kennedy assassination plot".

3. The allegation is that in some unspecified manner, Brown was

involved with the CIA in its objective of "covering up" the "conspiracy"

for President Johnson. Aynesworth said Gervage has documents, including

at least one in Garrison's own handwriting, which presumably have been

extracted from Garrison's files. Aynesworth indicated that, if desired,

he could secure these documents

from Gervage for review by Brown.

4. In view of Brown's close cooperation with the Agency in its

funding operations, Brown asked Frensley to communicate this information

to Haynes.

It is reported to Headquarters only as a matter of informa-

tion. Neither Brown nor Frensley expect any response.

5. Haynes asked Frensley to keep him informed of any future

developments in this matter.
