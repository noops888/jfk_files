claim to fame is his resemblance to JACKIE GLEASON and

that therefore he may need a sharper front man to run

the lounge - a

man who could meet executives on a little

higher level.

The aforementioned iformant advised that FEO hinted that

he could use

a waitress of the calibre of FRANCES PRIAM,

Longtime head waitress at the Genovese Cocktail Lounge,

412 Larimer Avenue, which he now operates as the Red

Eagle Club. He also stated that unescorted girls visiting

the lounge would be given drinks at no cost so that they could

stay on the premises and attract male patrons. He emphasized

that he had no wish to operate an escort service but that

high-class prostitutes would certainly

"add flavor" to the

establishment.

The informant explained that FELIX. "PHIL"

GENOVESE and MIKE. GENOVESE have often stated that they do

not want FEO in any of the rackets and wish to keep his

name "clean" as far as police records are concerned.

She :

said he was not allowed to attend any of the

"top-level"

administrative sessions which were held at the Genovese

Cocktail Lounge prior to the Apalachin meeting and believes

this was as much

the wish of JOHN LA ROCCA as it was of his

older brothers.

The informant advised that the aforementioned. FEO used to

date a small blonde prostitute named BARBARA GARRETT, and.

that when word got around that she was connected with the

GENOVESE brothers in some way her business was curtailed by

cautious prospects.

She said BARBARA will marry one AUGIE

(INU), an Italian boy about twenty-five years of age shortly.

She does not think AUGIE is in the rackets but has the

potential, inasmuch as he is a good-looking Italian boy now

employed as a waiter at "Club 30," notorious gambling

establishment at Chester, w. Va.

She believes that he was

screened

for this position by JO-JO" PECORA, GENOVESE'S

organizational lieutenant. She said BARBARA is known to the

FBI, having been unfortunate enough to be picked-up in several

police raids,

and that she once roomed with NORMA GRILLO,

well-known Pittsburgh prostitute.

She stated that BARBARA is

a small, twenty-four year old blonde who has not been

prostituting for about three or four months and is determined

to stay out of the racket for the sake of her fiance: She

does not believe BARBARA would know very much about anything

than prostitution, despite her once close assodation with

FEO GENOVESE because FEO was and is very close-mouted

with the little information his brothers allow him to know.

She said BARBARA is living with her boyfriend, AUGIE, on

the corner of Fifth and Shady Avenues and was

given a

bridal shower by her friends in the prostitution racket

recently.

The informant advised that "Young Johnnie" LA ROCCA has not

been in the Pittsburgh area for at least four months, to

her knowledge, but had a date with a prostitute on Centre

Avenue when last in the city. She said he was accompanied

by a businessman from Johnstown, Pa., from whom he was

seeking backing for some venture and that the man was

being entertained by "Young Johnnie" during the visit.

She

stated that the businessman was "goofy-looking" and not

interested in securing a date for himself.

The informant advised that MIKE GENOVESE is still in the

Pittsburgh area, to her knowledge, although he has not

lived at his farm in Gibsonia since early October, 1959.

She believes his wife is having trouble with her health,

but states that most of this trouble is in her mind and

that she worries about her husband a great deal.

advised that the Red Eagle Club is quiet and still caters

to a neighborhood clientele preferring pizza and beer.

She

said JOHN LA ROCCA does not visit here any longer and that

most of Pittsburgh's racketeers who once made the Genovese

Cocktail Lounge their hangout prefer not to even be observed

in its vicinity.

She stated that she had heard from

"Young

Johnnie" LA ROCCA that his older brother,

"Big John," might

nave to appear with MIne GENOVESE at a trial in New York. City

but that "things will eventually all clear up."

The informant advised that she or any other close-mouthed

established prostitute could contact GABRIEL "KELLY"

MANNARINO and be placed for expensive dates either in New

Kensington, Pa. a city controlled by the MANNARINO top

noodlum combination, or at the Town House Motel in

Monroeville, Pa.

She explained that' "SONNY" CIANCUTTI,

procurer for the organization, would make

necessary arrangements.

She advised that she has personally

observed LOUIs vOLPE former Pittsburgh top hoodlum who

controls the wilmerding, Pa., area, at the Town House or

at least two, occasions between May-October, 1959, and said

that VOLPE is always good for a "touch" if the prostitute.
