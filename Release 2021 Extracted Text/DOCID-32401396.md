PROGRESS ACHIEVED DURING APRIL IN IMPEDING TRAVEL TO CUBA

1. The Department of State has:

a. Participated in the drafting of a resolution passed at

the 3-4 April Managua meeting respecting discouragement of

travel of Latin Americans to Cuba for training in subversion.

The text of the resolution is appended hereto.

b. Headed

Prior to the depar-

ture of the team,

Department of State posts were instructed

to inform the host governments of the trip and to encourage

them to identify the kinds and extent of technical assistance

It would be most useful for the United States to furnish.

c. Caused to be noted in U.S. passports since 1 April that

they

are not valid for travel to Cuba.

a. Following an indication that the Bolivian Government

might be willing to increase efforts to impede travel of its

nationals to Cuba, Instructed the J.S. Embassy to recommend

that the GOB:

(1) Ban travel to Cuba by Bolivian nationals except

for official or special purposes approved by the GOB, and

establish legal penalties for violations;

(2) Require Bolivian citizens to have a passport or

other

GOB document to travel abroad;

(3) Make such document invalid for travel to Cuba

unless

specially endorsed;

(4) Seek arrangements with third countries which are

important transit points under which third countries

will assist the GOB in preventing unauthorized traver

by Bolivians and will help identify violators.

e. Drawing on the recommendation in the paper on liThe Move-

ment of subversives and subversive Irainees

and other sources,

prepared telegrams to the non-Isthmian posts, instructing them

to encourage host governments to take additional counter-

subversion steps.

Each

instruction was tailored to the local

situation in the recipient country and included appropriate

suggestions as to strategy which might be used in securing

implementation

of the desired actions.

f. Requested posts in Latin America to encourage host

governments to take appropriate measures

to discourage

participation of their nationals in Cuba's May Day cele-

bration,

and to prevent charter flights from their country

to Cuba

for the

celebration.

2. The Department of Defense has:

a. Continued the U.S. sea and air surveillance of the

area

surrounding Cuba until 25 April 1963, at the same rate

and with the same emphasis

as existed prior to that date.

Since 25 April 1963, additional sea surveillance has been

realized

between Cuba and Haiti, due to the stationing of

the Caribbean Ready Amphibious Squadron at the entrance of

the Gulf of Gonaives occasioned by the deterioration of

Internal conditions within Haiti. Reports of subversive

novement, or suspected subversive movement, obtained by

U,S. surveillance are available for immediate transmittal

through the U.S. milltary alerting system.

b. Flowing from recommendations by the committee,

greatly accelerated current programs for the installation

of military communications

facilities in Latin America.

As of 1 April, a commercial

submarine cable from Florida

to Panama became operational. This cable gives reliable

voice and

teletype communications to CINCARIB including

both classified teletype and voice. Negotiations are con-

tinuing in Honduras, Colombia and Ecuador for the instal-

lation of military

radio facilities. Installation of a

multi-channel radio station has been completed in Costa

Rica.

A similar facility in Nicaragua is scheduled for

completion by 1 July 1963.

c. Established an Intelligence Center at CARIBCOM

Headquarters, in connection with the program of surface

surveillance

of the Caribbean, for rapid processing and

dissemination to countries concerned, via the American Am-

bassadors, of intelligence on the movement of subversives.

d. Established on 11 April a U.S. military alerting

system operated by CINCARIB and CINCLANT.

Pursuant to the

request of the Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee on

â€¢ Cuban

Affairs the Department of Defense has suspended the

use of the Military Groups in the alerting system and is

working with CIA to reduce duplication of effort to a mini-

mum.

e. Alerting U.S. forces; for the most part within the

Atlantic Command, to be prepared to provide U.S. assistance

in the final interception of shipping in territorial waters

upon request by the country concerned. Currently, forces

are assigned by the unified commander

Involved, to meet the

singular problem encountered.

f. Ordered to the Canal Zone a Coast Guard Mobile

Training Team for a period of six months, beginning 15 May

1963, to provide training, in Spanish, in boat handling

and maintenance together with surveillance techniques to

those Central American countries having 40 foot Coast Guard

Utility Boats.

In addition, the Mobile Training Team will

assist as required in establishing a permanent Small Craft

Training and Inspection Facility in the Canal Zone.

40 foot utility boat has been permanently assigned to the

U.S. Naval Station, Rodman, Canal Zone for use by the MIT and

will be delivered there about 20 June.

3. The Central Intelligence Agency has :

a: Completed its efforts to improve U.S. government

communications in Latin America by the installation of the

remaining two commercial leased circuits into Guatemala

City and Managua, and the stationing on a permanent basis

of 35 CIA radio operators in Latin America

in replacement

of temporary duty personnel. In November 1962, CIA's active

radio facilities in 20 Latin American capitals were augmented

with on-line cryptographic facilities and temporary personnel

to handle the bulk of all U.S. government communications in

These facilities, know as Joint Communications

1) Argentina - Station, In conjunction with the

Embassy, has continued to

press the Argentine govern-

ment to enact effective travel control legislation and

to adopt measures recommended by the Special Consultative

Committee on Security of the oAs.

Information on Argentines

travelling to Cuba is being furnished to the Argentine

government by the station.

Several potential travellers

to Cuba have been spotted

and are being assessed by the

station.

Information from three recent returnees from

Cuba is being obtained through debriefings.

Station re-

oorts that because of increased Mexican controls, at.

ruly clandestine travel to cuba Irom Argentina is now via

Prague. Che Guevara's mother was arrested on 23 April

upon her return to Argentina for importing Castro propa-

ganda.

2) Bolivia - Station and Embassy have been urging

Bolivian government to adopt stricter travel controls,

without apparent results so far. Names of travellers

known to have returned from Cuba are being furnished to

the Bolivian government.

Thus far, no action is known

to have been taken by the Bolivian

government on the

strength of such information.

Station comments that prob-

lem with Bolivia 1s not in lack of information available

to government on Cuban subversion, but in getting Bolivia

to do something about 1t.

3) Brazil - Information on Brazilians who have received

subversive training in Cuba has been made available to

the Brazilian Foreign Office, through the American Ambassa-

dor, and to the National Security Council through CIA

liaisor with the NSC's Security Service.

An asset of the CIA station in Rio 1s in a position

to harass and delay Cuba-bound travellers in those

instances

where the station is able to tip him off re-

i him one stion

garding their destination.

He can also harass returnees

when informed in advance.

The station is taking steps to

get appropriate information to him promptly.

4) Chile - Chilean internal security authorities,

at urging of station, are trying to impede and harass

travellers to and from Cuba.

Government is now requiring

passport applicants to state destination, and passports

must be turned in after travel. The Foreign Minister

has stated much progress is being made, with cooperation

of the Mexican government, and that travel of Chileans to

Cuba has been dramatically reduced in recent weeks.

Station and Embassy are continuing pressure on Cuban

government in this regard.

Names of travellers to Cuba

are being passed to the Ambassador, who furnishes them

to President Alessandri who has asked that this collab-

oration be kept secret). Information from CIA unilateral

operations against Cuban Embassy is being used by a newly

ore arave prosected

created Chilean surveillance team in checking out purpose

of travel projected and in following up on returnees from

cuba.

The station has an agent in daily contact with

leaders of the extreme militant left and 1s exploring the

possibilities of sending three station assets to Cuba

for':training and intelligence missions. A Cuban First

Secretary was declared persona non grata during April for

using false identity documents, and the Cuban charge

d'affaires

was

subsequently recalled by his own government.

5) Colombia - Chief of Customs has indicated to station

his willingness to institute an improved travel control

system. One station asset expects to travel to Cuba

in the near future.

Station believes it has identified

a courier operating between Colombia and Cuba and has

mounted an operation to uncover his Colombian contacts.

6) Costa Rica - Station reports little pro-Castro

activity during April.

No recorded travel to or from

Cuba has taken place.

Local authorities appear inclined

to cooperate in control program.

7) Dominican Republic - Efforts to get Juan Bosch to

take active steps against Communists and travellers to

and from Cuba have been fruitless to date, as have been

efforts to establish a new and effective internal security

organization in the Dominican Republic.

Bosch appears

to have lost his previously stated enthusiasm for such

a service, but efforts to persuade him to approve :

roposed budget for the service are continuing.

8) Ecuador - Station reports that, largely as a result

of both overt and covert propaganda activities of U.s.

agencies in Ecuador,

the public awareness of Cuban

sub-

version has

changed from apathy to genuine concern.

The

government, however, is no more inclined to take action

than before.

The National Director of Immigration has

stated that

he personally would like to do whatever he

can to stop travel to Cuba, which he realizes is for.

subversive purposes, but present laws do not pemmit him

to impede travel via third countries.

He is exploring

possibilities of reprisals against citizens who return

from Cuba.

He has checked a list of names and passport

numbers obtained by CIA from airline manifests in Mexico,

and reports that not one name or passport number corres-

ponds with official Ecuadoran records, indicating the

possibility of fabrication of passports by Cuba.

A recent Ecuadoran returnee from Cuba, recruited by

the station, lost his hand in testing a homemade bomb

made in accordance with instructions received in Cuba.

He made a public statement and wide publicity was

arranged-by the station and USIS.

Plans are to keep this

Incident alive as proof of revolutionary training given

In Cuba for terrorist activity in Ecuador.

The station chief has accompanied the American

Ambassador on visits to the Ecuadoran Ministers of Defense

and Government to stress the threat of Cuban backed

subversion.

Approximately 7,000 pounds of Communist propaganda

are being destroyed monthly as a result of a unilateral

operation of the CIA Base in Guayaquil.

9) Haiti - Station reports that several assets have

travelled to points outside Port-au-Prince in an effort

to learn of possible travel to and from Cuba.

Reports

from areas of Cape Haitien, Port de Paix, and La Gonave

and La Tortue Islands, were negative.

10) Honduras - The government has shown little inclina-

tion to tighten up on travel control. A travel control

system presented to the Minister of Government has been

fully approved by him, but not yet put into effect.

Several known Honduran Communists have recently travelled

to Cuba.

Information as to their identities is being

furnished to President Villeda through the U.S. Ambassador.

11) Mexico - A CIA source states the Cuban Embassy has

Issued 10-15 visas during April on pieces of paper

separate from the passport, but the government's practice

of stamping all passports to show travel to or from Cuba

has largely nullified this effort by travellers to avoid

the stigma of travel to Cuba. All

Cubans arriving in

Mexico, whether in transit or otherwise must have Mexican

visas.

This is not true of other nationalities, who need

no visa if in transit.

The government continues to

confiscate propaganda

material from Cuba sporadically at

the airport.

Several station assets have recently

12) Panama - At the urging of statior, the Guardia

Nacional has been ordered to increase 1ts vigilance

concerning returnees from Cuba and to prevent them from

establishing an effective organization.

Several recent

returnees from Cuba are being debriefed regarding their

training and contacts, and several CIA assets are

expecting to leave for Cuba in the near future for

training.

CIA has increased its personnel assigned to

travel control functions at the Panama City airport,

now permitting a three-man detail for each eight-hour

shift.

Station is continuing its pressure on Panamanian

officials to tighten travel controls.

13) Uruguay - Station has made arrangements with local

service to pigeonhole or "lose" applications for good

conduct certificates - which are needed to secure pass-

ports, and must be renewed every six months - in cases

Where

information from the CIA station or from the

Uruguayans' own sources indicated intention of travell-

ing to Cuba.

Pertinent information from CIA unilateral

operations is being passed regularly to cooperating

Station has a further check in that

the Mexican Ambassador to Uruguay is now checking all

applicants for Mexican visas with the station.

On the

basis of information furnished to him, he held up visa

applications of Uruguayan Communist Labor delegates who

planned to attend May Day celebrations in Havana.

Creation of this bottleneck may force some travellers

to abandon the Mexican route to Cuba and turn to the

longer and far more expensive route via Prague.

Info-

mation on past travel to cuba by Uruguayans, furnished

by the station, was included in a study of Cuban sub-

version prepared by Uruguayan Military Intelligence

Service for the National Council of Government.

4. The U. S. Information Agency has:

a. Sent circular instructions to all USIS field posts

in Latin America advising each to stimulate publicity in

the local press and radio, to encourage identification of

Cuban trainees through personal-contact work with students

and labor, to report promptly evidence of Cuban-aided

subversion in each country, to report statements by local

leaders and editorial comment, and to publicize economic

conditions in Cuba as means of discrediting travellers to

in

Cuba who was wounded by his

own explosives, Assistant

Secretary Martin's Pan

American Day speech,

and several
