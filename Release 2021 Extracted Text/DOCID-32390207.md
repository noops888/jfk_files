ISS/DDA

FROM

: Rodger S. Gabrielson

Office of Legislative Counsel

SUBJECT

: HSCA Records

1. During the course of the HSCA investigations, much classified

information was assembled in response to HSCA requests. Three categories

of. information must now be disposed of under terms of the HSCA/DCI

Memorandum of Understanding.

Category la: Classified material from Agency

holdings, requested by the HSCA, which HSCA staff

members reviewed.

Category lb: Classified material from Ayency

holdings, requested by the HSCA, but which HSCA

staff members did not review.

Category 2: Material generated by the HSCA from

Agency classified holdings made available to the

ISCA in response to the latter's request. Note:

This HSCA material is considered by the HSCA as its

property and, therefore, not releasable to the

public under

the Freedom of Information Act. An

inventory of this material received from HSCA has

been completed.)

Category 3: Classified correspondence and certain

unclassified correspondence exchanged between this

Agency and the HSCA.

2.

The HSCA has indicated its desire that copies of these three

categories of material be held in sealed and segregated storage to

ensure the preservation of all relevant records pertaining to the

phase of the investigation involving this Agency. In order to accom-

modate the HSCA, but also leave our own records accessible for routine

purposes, a photographic copy should be nade of each official Agency

document made available in response to a specific request by the HSCA

(Category la and 1b).
