3.

Michell Livingston VERBELL III, the principal

owner of the arms manufacturing firm befense Systems

International

and an international arms dealer, has been

encouraging a group of Bahanian citizens on the island

of Abaco who seel to secede from the Bahamian Commonwealth.

In this affair WERBELL has been collaborating with

group based in Miami called the "Friends of Abaco."

Active in the Friends of Abaco is Michael OLIVER, a wealthy

land developer residing at 2089 El Rancho Drive, Carson City,

Nevada.

OLIVER, a naturalized U.S. Citizen, was born

Moses OLITSKI on 11 Decenber 1928 in Lithuania.

4.

in encouraging persons in Abaco to seel:

independence of Nassau, OLIVER's apparent motive is to

establish a prototype government based on principles of

tree enterprise expounded in a paperback book which he

has authored

called "A New Constitution for a New Country"

(Fine Arts Press, Reno, Nev. = 1968) .

WERBELL, on the

other hand, has privately expressed a desire to establish

a tourist mecca on Abaco to include hotels, recreation

facilities and gambling casinos. Officials of Holiday

International, a Baltimore firm specialized in recreation

and health spas, have been briefed by WERBELL and OLIVER

recently on the Abaco movement. Robert A. C. HAMILTON,

13th Lord of Belhaven and Stenton and a nomber of the

ASTER/SENSITIVE

Friends of Abaco, on 10 June 1974 sponsored a resolution

in behalf of the Abaco Independence Movement on the floor

of the British House of Lords,

following conversations

with WERBELL in Washington in

late May.

5.

Despite the seeming innocence of the enterprise,

however, we have observed that WERBELL, in particular, '

has made a concerted effort to involve

persons formerly

affiliated with this Agency in

the activities of the

Friends of Abaco in support of Abaco's independence.

occasions, involving at least two forner

officers of this organization, MULDOON and ROUSSOS cited

above, WERBELL has introduced

them as presumably active

Agency officials in such a fashion as to imply, according

to the persons involved, that either this Agency or the

United States Government supports the ains of the

Friends of Abaco.

6. Most recently, WERBELL has proposed to both

economic terns.

The study would include interviews with

citizens on Abaco prior to

an alleged plebiscite"

independence to take place

in Abaco on 28 June 1974.

To be included in the investigation is research on the

probable reaction in the United Nations Organization to

a petition fron political groups

in Abaco for support on

independence, notably any parallels to be found in

precedents such as the Biafra

secession from Nigeria.

7. Andrew SI. GEORGE, a nationally known frce-lance

writer, has becone

active in WERBELL's organization and

claims to be preparing an

article on WERBELL and the

Abaco movement tor publication in True Magazine.

SI. GEORGE has participated in the several meetings that

VERBELL, OLIVER and their associates have had with the

two retired Agency officers, Mr. John MuLdood anu

Mr. Ted ROUSSOS.
