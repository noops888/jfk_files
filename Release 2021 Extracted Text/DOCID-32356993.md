lost with the action groups of OA. Efren was completely out of money.. Brand gave

him $130.00 and instructed him to establish contact with On's action

groups, bfr

agreed to do this.

Brand had to renain in his safe house for the next ten days,

because no glue

Meanwhile, Plinio had arrived to Havana, and had established contact with Efren

and other members of the underground.

Emilio Rodriguez gave Brand a man

This man is named Montes. After receiving the disguise materials, Brand establis

contact with Jesus Iglesias, former member of Triplo A, and Brand's fellow consp

for many years, Iglesias owned a 50 ft. yacht. Brand asked Iglesials help to use

his yacht to smuggle weapons into Cuba. Iglesias was in very low spirits. He sai

that it was useless for the cubans to fight Fidel, since Fidel. had a powerful ba

from the Soviet Union, and that unless the U.S, decided to do something about it

our efforts were doomed to failure. In short, Iglesias refused to help.

Next, Brand established contact wiüh Cesar Lancis Bravo. Cesar agreed to help

Brand instructed Cesar to start looking for D.Z3. and L.Zs, Besides, Cesar was t

start organizing laborers in the different Unions, and to try to gather informat

from all of them. Cesar also voluntered to make contacts with policemen in the

patrol cars, in order to find out the codes they were using in their radio

conmunications. He also promised to start a search for safe houses and store hou

and to start checking Fidel through the members of the Sindicato Gastronomico. I

that first meeting, Brand gave Cesar one thousand pesos,, to be used for expenses

for the renting of houses.

Next, Brand mad contact with Benito Fernardez. Benito said that he was

that he had a friond who had been a

lieutenent in the rebel army, and who had qu

connections with MAR. He said he was going to talk things over with his friends

pesos to be used in the renting of safe houses. Brand also asked about the possi

of creating some disturbances at liavana University on the 30th of Septembar,

Ground the Filtenth of September, Brand thought he had noticed certain unu

things around Potin's building, where Brand's safehouse was located. One day, a

when Brand was entering the building, he heard a man asking about the people wh

living at the penthouse of the building. This confirmed Brand's suspicions than

something wrong was going on. Brand left the building and never came back. It w

until three weeks later that Brand found out, through Augusto Casamayor,, the m

who had provided the safe house, that a tennant of the penthouse, who lived in f

of Brand's apartment, had been the victin of extortion. This had been the unu

atmosphere that Brand had noticed around the building, because that tennant had:

under surveillance by the people who submitted him to extortion.

Brand went to live for some days at Juan Mendez's place. At this safchouse,

a well known Cuban dontist. This dentist lont his house many times so that it. cc

be used for Brand's meetings with Benito Fernandez. Brand also used Honriquez as

treasurer, Whenever Brand received money from the Company, he took it to Henriqu

A few days later brand met jus Alvarez, a former bus citet, eleakororea a

became Brand's driver. This Luis Alvarez had been recommended by

be a courageous, dedicated and faithful companion.

In a new meeting with Jose Fernandez Planas, Brand met a young physician know

Anselso. In this meeting they said they had found a Doz. and that they ware goin

give Brand a may pointing out the exact location of the place, They askod which

weapons could Brand provide. Brand mentioned all the weapons he hechad been prom

and commited himself to deliver certain amount of those weapons fifteen days aft

the map had reached his hands. The boys promised to give the map in short notice

These boys also wanted to establish contact with Brand's people in Pinar del Rio

Some days later Brand received a very detailed nap of a l.z. in the southern

coast of the Province of Pinar del Rio, It was sent to the Company right away.

By this time Robaynas had sent Brand the location of another D.z. By then , R

kept asking about the weapons, and he kept saying that his men were anxious to r

the equipment and start fighting.

Through Emilio Rodriguez Brand inet an American known as Willian Webster. This

was to put Brand in contact with a group of a friend of Brand who had gone to Mi

named Mario Massip. Through Webster, Brand met a man already known to him for man

years. This man's nane is Simon labre, Simon Yabre was to put Brand in contact w

Mario Massip's group. By this time Brand had become a little bit uneasy about th

lack of news fron Jin Bowdin, and kept asking Enilio Rodriguez about the deliver

of weapons. Emilio Rodriguez always answered that he knew nothing about it, that

always delivered my reports but could not tell me what the policies of the Compa:

were in that respect.

Through webster, Brand made contact with a wealthy and very well known cuban

Silvio de Cardenas. Silvio da Cardenas said that he was one of the leaders of a i

headed by Jose Ignacio Rivero and Antonio Rubio Padilla. He said, and Brand beli:

to be the exact truth, that they had connections along the whole island with wel

known and respected people. That they could provida fincas and transportation. A

they wanted was weapons and guidance. Brand promised both. Through the Coupany,

By this time, Brand had met a man known as Roberto Alvarez, who had a red je

who said he

for

had been trained in intelligence work, and that he had been in

several years. This man was introduced to Brand by Emilio Rodriguez. Robert

was to help Brand in anything Brand would require of him. Erand found that Robe

was available only after 5 p.n. and on Saturdays and Sundays. Brand found thia

Alvarez to be a sensible, educated and calmed individual. Brand told this can t

ho would find something for him to do.

Cabañas had given by now four saichouses. These safehouses were already inha

but the families living there were to receive anyone in nseddof a safehouse, Ir

of those houses Brand livod for two weeks, Another of those houses was used as

safehouse for meetings.

Through Cabanas and

• Benito Fernandez, Brand not a man named Oscar Rodriguez.

This man claimed to be one of the leaders of an organizations in the Province e

Oriente. They were willing to work provided they were supplied with weapons. Br

found the man to be honest, but dumb and unexperienced. Nevertheless, Brand ins

- this man to keep in touch with Cabañas.

By this time, Brand had become a little bit uneasy

about his disguise. During

perambulations around town, Brand had met by chance with many old friends. Nong

then recognized brand. One day, however, a boy named Nodal, member of Triple,

saw Brand in a drugstoro and recognized him. When Branu. went out, Brand noticed

that two men in a car were watching him. The car went around the block and star

the car approached Brand saw Nodal and Silvie Martinez, a

momber of Triple A. Silvio called Brand and insisted on haring a meeting with h

Brand was mad to see how irresponsible and indiscreet these fellowa were. Brand

them

an appointment, but Brand didn't attend to it, Brand had become uneasy abo

the disguise because, although Bavas using a second hairpiece, lt looked awfull

bad, and many friends had warned

Brand that the hairpiece looked. a falo from a m

afar. They also said that the moustache looked too dark. Brand's conclusion abo

this is what follows:l The disguise was very good, but hairpieces: don't last lon

in Cuba's clinate, If one wears them daily, as Brand did,

they ars not good for

more than twelve or fifteen days. 2) The disguise was good as long as it made E

a differont man, but it was bad because 1t had too distinctivo foaturos, that i

that if the volice radioad a description of a man with very dark hair, very dar

moustache, and a pair of sonehor unusual glasses, it is surg. onougn that Brand

roine to be caught, It is Brand's opinion that if a man is to wear a disguise 1

a long period of time, this disguise should not have distinetive features. It s

be difficuli to describe the man in disguise, This is why from the very first d

in September Brand kept asking Jim to send Karl to Cuba, Brand wanted to be dis

in a different way. Another thing about disguises: the verson in disguise shoul

always have enough materials at hand. In many occasionasthe replacements for mou

took too long to arrive to Cuba. The last ten moustaches were received in very

shape and were so bad that Brand thought they had not been made by Karl, or tha

Karl had made them in a hurry.

By this time Brand had already met Mario Escoto a known conspirator and old

friond of Brand. Escoto was Aureliano's representative in Cuba, and the nan in

charge of triple a, grand offered weapons to Escoto, provided Escoto gave D.2s,

escoto said. he had to consult this with Aurcliano, but nevertheless, he said th

was going to send Brand a may with the exact location of a D.2. Brand also offe

Eacoto any money he night need, but locoto said he didn't need money. He implis

that he had been provided with all the money he needed for his activities.

By this time, Brand had notified the Company that all his men were to work i

the name of "Cuba Libre"

Through Vidal Morales, Brand met a run named Jaime Comila Perez. Gomila was one

ot the leaders at the Union Vinatera Nacional, an association of wine industrialis

Brand saw Gonila three times. Comila offored to get the defection of the Under Sec

of the Ireasury (Subsecretario de Hacienda), Dr. Israel Rodriguez. He also said th

he could get the defection of one of the members of the Suprene Court, whose name

Brand doos not remember now. Gomila also said. Gomila had also made contacts with

Captain of the Army, stationed in Santiago, named Quintana Mena. This captain had

a member of the i-2 and he wanted to cooperate with the forces fighting Castro, Bi

instructed Gonila to get intelligence reports from this Captain,

and also from the

Subsecretario de Hacienda and from the Member of the Supreme Court. Gomila went to

Santiago de Cuba to see the Captain, but Brand does not know the oucome of their

meeting, because Brand didn't see Gomila

again.

One day Brand went to Fernandez Plana's house to have a meting with the milita

chief of the Frontin the Province of Pinar del Rio. Brand felt he had noticed some

surveillance around the place. When Brand told this to Fernandez Plana and his fri

they adopted a somewhat we-don't-believe-in-ghosts attitude. They told Brand that

vere going to see the man from Pinar del Rio in a different place. They offered

transportation fop Brand. Brand went with Anselmo, whose car was parked in front o

Fernandez Plana's house. After Anselmo had been driving for a while, Brand asked h

in he was looking through the rear mirror, to see if they had been followed. A few

seconds after this remark, inselmo said that a car was alter them. Brardtherdinstr

Anselmo not to go to the meeting place. They began driving around town, and the ca

kept after them. Finally they went to Calixto Garcia's Hospital. Brand went into a

building, took off his moustache and glasses and went out by the same door he had

to come in. The men who had been following them were there, but it seems they didn

recognized Brand, who walked away.

around these days, while Brand was going to a meeting, he saw in the streets

friend of his, Pancho Varona, a fellow conspirator against Batista. Brand invitad

to come into the car. They talked for a few minutes and set a date and place for a

meeting. Three daya after that, Varona net Brand. Varona informed Brand that a few

days before an airplane had dropped equipment at bl Escambray, and that the equipm

had been caught by Fidel's forcas. Brand asked some D.zs. from Varona. Varone prom

na be caught by able fore?

to get then, but he looked quite skeptical about many things. Brand told him.

The next time

Brand saw Benito Fersandoz, he said that Plinio's mother had visi

him, quite nervous, saying that his son had been captured at 3l Escambray.

Benito

her that that was not true.

Prior to this meeting, Benito Fernandez had introduced to Brand

Two triends of

named Enrique Barroso, and another young man by the name of Cruz.

othey identifiod

themselves as friends of Nino Diaz, Brand offered them helo, and asked them to coo

their offorts with Brand in the province of Pinar del Rio. They said that they ha

talk those things with Nino Diaz before making any definite arrangement. They sai

Cruz was going to hiami to see Nino Dias. They wanted Brand to establish bona

Nino Diaz

so her- night trust Brand. Brand sent a flash to Jim Bowdin, asking him

establish Brand's bona fide with Nino Diaz. Many days passed by, and Brand was no

able to continue negotiations, because no answer ever came from Jim Bondin or

nember of the Company. Prior to this meeting with Barroso and Cruz, Brand had had

a first meeting with Barroso. Benito Fernandez, knew that, Barroso and Cruz had man;

hidden weapons in Havana.

Through Losada, Brand met a man named Juan Tabranes. This man Tabranes vas

the leaders of'Resistencia Agranonte". Losada had informed him of his dealings vi.

Brand. He said that in order to get a final agreement with "Cuba Libre"

By this time,

Brand has received infornation through Cabanas of the frequent c

of Raul faul Castro to the Embassy of Checoeslovaguia. We tried but could not ren

house acroos the street. Brand had instructed Roberto Alvarez to make a plan for

casing of the place and also for the killing. The hands of the professional coul

seen in the instructions given by: Roberto Alvarez. At last,

we got word that Rau

Castro was going to live in Oriente, and since we were not alle to rent the house

the plan was dropped.

In his last meeting with Brand, Cesar Lancis had informed him of the possibili

o1 killing Fidel at the National Hotel, where he used to go to have dinner with t

employees. This was also told to Roberto Alvarez, who began thinking about plans:

regarding

the National Hotel and Pekin Restaurant.

Rumors began to:spread around town that Plinio had been captured somewhere nea:

El Escambray mountains.

Meanwhile, Cabanas had seen Brand several times, and had informed him ot the

recruitings he had made for Cuba Libre among the drivers and conductors of Coopera

de Omnibus Aliados•

Finally, the newspapers in town puolished some pictures of Plinio Prieto after i

capture near El Escambray. The summary trials began. The day beforo the execution,

is, the 1lth of October, Emilio Rodriguez came to see Brand. He informed Brand that

Juan Mendez'and some other groups were going to start shooting around town in order

prove the Government that the Cuban People was against the executions, and on the i
