ADMINISTRATIVE CONTINUED:

LOUIS SANGARI, Newark, NJ, is also involved and in

fact for the past ten days U.s.

Customs has maintained a

surveillance on him.

During this period he was not observed

meeting the subject at any time.

U.S. Customs will keep the NYO advised of develop-

ments. In addition the NYo is supplying background infor-

nation and photographs to U.s. Customs in order to facilitate

their investigation. SA WALSH also confidentially advisec

that there is a good possibility that a U.S. Customs Examiner

could be involved in the case since there

is little likelihood

such large shipments could enter the port without inside

help.
