William Douglas Pawley

SF#078 435

In 1959 Subject again became of operational interest to the

Western Hemisphere Division

activities directed against Cuba. :

At that time Subject was

an executive with a private corporation in Miami, Florida.

Subject was

granted a Covert Security Approval in connection

with WH Division's interest circa

December 1959.

On 7 October 1959 the Chief, WH Division requested

the Office of Security to install an

audio mike and wire

device in Subject's Miami office for the purpose of "making

available to WH Division representatives in Miami

detailed

reports of conversations held by (Subject) with his numerous

contacts among Caribbean revolutionary groups, especially

anti-Castro Cuban exile leaders."

Cited request from the

Chief, WH Division indicated that Subject is a personal

friend of the then DCI and that he had cooperated with the

Agency in the past. Subject's file also indicates that the

then DCI was made aware of the planned audio installation.

3.

Subject's file specifically states that the audio

mike and wire was to be installed in Subject's office desk

in such a manner that Subject could activate the recording

device while talking to foreign nationals.

The file reflects

that subject was not only witting of the mike and wire instal-

lation but was in complete control of the audio equipment.

4.. Cited mike and wire installation was made on 15 Octo-

ber 1959 by employees of an Office of Security field office.

Subject's file does not reflect when, of if, the audio equip-

ment was

removed from Subject's office.

dated January 1961 indicates that the equipnent was in

operation as of that time as two Office of Security employees

were dispatched to Miami, Florida, to repaii certain audio

equipment which was malfunctioning.

5. Subject's files do not reflect the results of any

tape recordings made through the above installation although

the file does indicate that any such product would have been

given to WH Division representatives.

Subject appears to have

remained of interest to the WH Division and to the DCI until

as late as 1964.
