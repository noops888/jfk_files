as redacted

As a visual aid to the analysis of the materials

contained in the four compilations discussed above.. a

chart has been prepared which illustrates the flow of

written information from the CIA to the Warren Commission

and the U.S. Intelligence Community concerning President

Kennedy's assassination. This chart sets forth the C IA's

designation for each document listed and lists the subject

matter of each document and the date of each

document's

dissemination. The chart also indicates whether the document

was made available to the Warren Commission, the U.s.

Intelligence community

or both. A secondary purpose of

, this chart is to indicate for selected subjects the volume

of information provided to the U.S. Intelligence Community

as opposed to the Warren Commission.

During the course of this study, additional Agency

files have been reviewed. These files have been examined

in an effort to resolve certain issues created by the re-

view of the Agency's compilations discussed herein. Where

apparent gaps existed in the written record, files have

been requested and reviewed in an effort to resolve these

gaps.

Where significant substantive

issues have arisen

related to the kind and quality of information provided

the Warren Commission,

files have also been requested and

Mr. Rocca added that, to his knowledge, Mr. Helms'

orders were followed to the letter by all CIA employees.

(Ibid. p. 24.) Mr. Rocca concluded that on this basis:

"the CIA was to turn over and to develop any information

bearing on the assassination that could be of assistance

to the Warren Commission." (Ibid., p. 26.)

A different view of the CIA's role regarding the

supply of CIA's information to the Warren Commission was

propounded by Richard Helms. Mr. Helms, who served as

the CIA's Deputy Director for Plans during the Warren

Commission investigation was directly responsible for the

CIA's investigation of President Kennedy's assassination

(Ibia. p. 23.) He testified to the Committee that the

CIA made every effort to be as responsive as possible to

Warren Commission requests. (Exec. Sess. Text. of Richard

Helms, 8/9/78, p. 10.) Mr. Helms added further testimony

regarding the manner in which the CIA provided its infor-

mation to the Warren Commission. He stated:

An inquiry would come over (from the Warren

Commission). We would attempt to respond

to it. But

these inquiries came in indivi-

dual items...Each individual item that came

along we took care of as best we could.

(Ibid., pp. 10-11.)

However, it was Mr. Helms' recollection that the

CIA provided information to the Warren Commission primarily

on the basis of the Commission's specific requests. Under

effect.

The following exchange between Committee Counsel

and Mr. Helms illustrates the acutedlaxity the Agency's

compromise:

Mr. Goldsmith:

Mr. Haems, I take it from your testi-

mony that your position is that the

anti-Castro plots, in fact, were rele-

vant to the Warren Commission's work;

and, in light of that, the Committee

would like to be informed as to why

the Warren Commission was not told by

you of the anti-Castro assassination

plots.

Mr. Helms:

I have never been asked to testify before

the Warren Commission about our operations.

Mr. Goldsmith:

If the Warren Commission did not know

of the operation, it certainly was not

in a position to ask you about it.

Is that not true?

Mr. Helms:

Yes, but how do you know they did not know

about it? How do you know Mr. Dulles had

not told them? How was I to know that?

And besides, I was not the Director of

the. Agency and in the CIA, you did not go

traipsing around. to the Warren Commission

or to Congressional Committees to to any-

place else without the Director's permis-

sion.

Mr. Goldsmith: Did you ever discuss with the Director whe-

ther the Warren Commission should be in-

formed of the anti-Castro assassination

plots?

Mr. Helms:

I did not, as far as I recall.

Mr. McCone testified that he first

became aware of the CIA's anti-Castro assassination plots

involving CIA-Mafia ties during August 1963. He stated

that upon learning of these plots, he directed that the

Agency cease all such activities. (McCone deposition, p.13)

noneves, then asked

whether

the CIA desired to withhold information from the Warren

Commission about the Agency anti-Castro assassination plots

to avoid

embarassing the Agency or causing an international

crises he responded:

"I cannot answer that. since they (CIA employees

knowledgeable of the continuance of such plots)

withheld the information from me.

I cannot an-

swer that question. I have never been satisfied

as to why they withheld the information from me.

3.174)

Mr. Rocca testified that had he known of the anti-

Castro assassination plots, his efforts to explore the pos-

sibility of a retaliatory assassination against President

Kennedy by Castro would have been intensified. He stated:

...in light of what has happened a completely

different procedural approach probably would

and should have been taken.

the light of history.

What I can't

accept is that leads were

deliberately or otherwise ignored. (Rocca dep.,

p.45)

John Scelso, the above-cited CIA desk officer

who ran the CIA's

initial investigation of President Ken-

nedy's assassination until that responsibility was given

to the CIA's counterintelligence staff, offered a highly

critical appraisal of Helms' non-disclosure to the Warren

Commission:

Mr. Goldsmith: Do you think Mr. Helms was acting properly

when

he failed

to tell the Warren Commission

about the assassination plots?

Mr.

Scelso:

No, I think that was a morally highly re-

prehensible act, which he cannot possibly

justify under his oath of office, or any

other standard of professional public service.

(Scelso dep., p.153)

III. Introductory Section/SS+M

The length of time required by the CIA to respond

to the Warren Commission's requests for information has

been shown to have been dependent upon I) the availability

of information, and 2) the complexity of the issues pre-

sented by the request. On this point, Mr. Helms testified

that when CIA had been able to satisfy a Commission re-

quest, the CIA would then send a reply back:

"and some of these inquiries obviously took

longer than others.

For example, some might involve

checking a file which was in Washington.

Other inquiries might involve trying to see

if we could locate somebody in some overseas

country.

Obviously, one takes longer to per-

form than the other. (Helms Exec. Session

hearing, p.25)

Scelso commented that "we were not authorized at first

On February 1, 1964 Helms appeared before the

mission's representatives had visited the CIA's headquar-

ters in Langley, Virginia and had been shown various trans-

cripts resulting from the CIA

Mexico City. (Rocca dep. p.89) However,

Mr. Rocca did not personally make this material available

to Commission representatives and was not able to state

under oath precisely the point in time at which the Warren

Commission learned of these operations.

On February 19, 1964 the CIA responded to Rankin's

inquiry of February 10. The Agency response did indi-

cate that Oswald had phoned the Soviet Consulate and was

also interviewed at the Consulate. However, the Agency did

not reveal

the source of this information in its response

to the connission or indicate that it would be revealed

by other means (e.g. by oral briefing).

During the period of March - April 1964, David

Slawson drafted a series of memoranda which among other

issues concerned Warren Commission knowledge of and access

to the production material derived from the CIn

Mexico City. A review of

these memoranda tends to support the Committee's belief

that the Warren Commission, through Mssrs. Slawson, Coleman,

and Willens did not obtain access to CI

terials until April 9, 1964. At that time, Coleman,

Sfalwson and Willens met with win scott, the CIA's Chief

Another Slawson memorandum, dated March 25, 1964

concerned Oswald's trip to Mexico. Slawson therein stated

that the tentative conclusions concerous oswald's

Mexico trip,

that he had reacher

were derived from CIA

memorandad of January 31, 1964 and February 19, 1964,

and in addition a Mexican federal police summary

*of

interrogations conducted shortly after the assassination

with certain Cuban Embassy employees. Slawson wrote:

A large part of it (the summary report) is

simply a summation of what the Mexican police

rate as Mrs. Duran's testimony to the police.

These comments indicate that salison placed limited

reliance upon the Mexican police summary. Moreover, there

is no indication that salwson had been provided the Duran

•transeripts. In fact, by virtue of

Slawson's comments

conerning the Mejican police report,

it would appear that the Warren Commission as of March 251

had been provided little substantive information pertaining

to Sylvia Duran.

Insert P 28

The Committee's belief that Slawson had not been

given access to the Duran transcripts is further supported

by reference to his memorandum of March 27, 1964 (Cite)

wherein he states his conclusion that Oswald had visited

the Cuban Embassy on three occasions. This conclusion

relevant to Oswald's Mexico City trip. They wrote:

The most probable final result of the entire

a conclusion that he went there for the purpose

of trying to reach Cuba and that no bribes, con-

Upon the group's arrival in Mexico City, they were met

by U.S. Ambassador Freeman, Claire Boonstra of the State

the CIA.

That same day during a meeting between the Commission

representatives and Win Scott, Scott made available to the

he provided the group with reels of photographs for the

"Scott's narrative plus the material we were shown dis-

closed immediately how incorrect our previous

information had been in Oswald's contacts with the

Soviet and Mexican Embassies.

Apparently the

distortions and omissions to which our information had

been subjected had entered some place in Washington,

because the CIA information that we were shown by Scott

was unambiguous on almost all the crucial points. We

had previously planned to show Scott, Slawson's

reconstruction of Oswald's probable activities at the

embassies to get scott's opinion, but once we saw how

badly distorted our information was

On March 12, 1964, representatives of the Warren

Commission and the CIA confered regarding the February 12

request for the materials forwarded to the Secret Service by

the Agency. (See Rankin letter of March 16, 1964 and Slawson

memo, March 12, 1964)

The record indicates that the Commission at the March 12

meeting pressed for access to the Secret Service materials.

Rankin wrote to Helms on March 16 that it was

his understanding

that the CIA would supply the Commission with a paraphrase of

each report or communication pertaining to the Secret Service

materials "with all indications of your confidential communica-

tions techniques and confidential sources deleted. You will

also afford members of our staff working in this area an

opportunity to review the actual file so that they may give

assurance that the paraphrase are complete." (Rankin letter of

March 16, 1964, #2)

Helms responded to Rankin's March 16 letter on March 24

(DDP4-1554, CD631 and DDP4-1555, CD 674) by two separate

communications. CD631 provided the Commission with a copy of

the October 10, 1963 CIA dissemination to FBI, State Dept.,

INS and Navy Dept. (SS on 22 Nov.) regarding Lee Harvey Oswald

and his presence at the Soviet Consulate in Mexico City. The

NW 66000

further revealed that on October 23, 1964, CIA had

requested two copies of the most recent photograph of Oswald in

order to check the identity of the person believed to be

Oswald in Mexico City. Furthermore, the CIA stated that it

had determined that the photograph shown to Marguerite

oswald on November 22, 1963 did not refer to Lee Harvey Oswald, This

was dow by checking the photograph against the press photographs of

Oswald generally available on November 23, 1963.

CD 674 reveals that on November 22, 1963, immediately

following the assassination, and on November 23, 1963, three

cabled reports were received at CIA headquarters from the CIA

Mexico City Station regarding photographs of an unidentified man

who had visited the Cuban and Soviet Embassies during October

and November 1963.

Paraphrases of these cables, not revealing

sensitive sources and methods, were attached to CD 674. The

Agency further stated that the subject of the photo referenced

in these cables was not Oswald. It

further stated that:

"In response to our meeting of 12 March and your memo

of 16 March, Stern and Willens will review at Langley

the regional copies of these 3 disseminations to the

Secret Service and the cables on which they were based, as

well as the photos of the unidentified man." (CIA,

p. 116444 of notes)

On March 26, William Coleman wrote in a memorandum for

the record:

"The CIA directed a memorandum to J. Lee Rankin on March 24,1964

(Commission Document No. 631) in which it set forth the

dissemination of the information on Lee Harvey Oswald.

I realize that this memorandum is only a partial answer

to our inquiry to the CIA dated March 16, 1964 and I hope

that the complete answers will give us the additional

information we requested."

NW 66000

Coleman went on to state:

"As you know, we are still trying to get an

Marguerite Oswald soon after the assassination. I

hope that paragraph 4 of the memorandum of March 24,

1964

(CD 631) sent Mr. Rankin by the CIA is not the

answer which the CIA intends to give us as to this

inquiry."

The following day, as agreed by Warren Commission and

Agency: representatives, Samuel Stern of the Commission visited

CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.

¡terns' memorandum reveals that he reviewed Oswald'.

file with Raymond Rocca. Stern indicated that Oswald's file

contained those materials furnished previously to the Warren

Commission by the CIA. The file also contained:

Cable reports of November 22 and November 23 from

the CIA's Mexico City Station relating to the photo-

graph of the unidentified individual mistakenly

believed to be Lee Harvey Oswald and the reports on

those cables furnished on November 23, 1963 to

the Secret Service by the CIA.

Stern noted that these messages were accurately para-

phrased in the attachments to CD 674 provided the Warren

Commission on March 24, 1964.

Stern also reviewed

the October 10, 1963 cable from

CIA's Mexico City Station to the CIA headquarters

reporting Oswald's contact with the Soviet Embassy

in Mexico City. He also reviewed the October 10,

1963 cable from CIA headquarters. to the Mexico City

Station reporting background information on Oswald.

Stern noted: that these messages were also paraphrased

Warren Commission reporting Oswald's Mexico City trip.

Lastly, Stern noted that Rocca provided him for his

review a computer printout of the references to Oswaldrelated

documents located in the Agency's electronic data storage

system. He stated "there is no item listed on the printout

which the Warren Commission has not been given either in full

text or paraphrased."

Thus, by the 27th of March, a Warren Commission representa-

tive had been apprised of the circumstances surrounding the

mysterious photograph.

VII.

Allan Dulles' Role vis-a-vis the CIA-Warren Commission

Relationship

It has been alleged that Allan Dulles, former Director

of Central Intelligence, and one of the seven members of the

Warren Commission, concealed crucial information from the Warren

Commission. Specifically, the Senate Select Committee

concluded:

"With the exception of Allan Dulles, it is unlikely

that anyone on the Warren Commission knew of CIA

assassination efforts...Allan Dulles, who had been

Director of Central Intelligence until November 1961,

was a member of the Warren Commission and knew of the

CIA plots with underworld figures which had taken place

during his tenure at the Agency." (SSC, Book V, pp. 67-68)

However, the SSC did not explore further the relationship and

allegiancesof Dulles as a Warren Commission member and Dulles

as a former DCI of the CIA.. The Committee has consequently

sessior's interrogation.

David Murphy's memorandum of July 8, 1964 concerned

about

his discussions with Allan Dulles I

gNosenko's knowledge

of Oswald. This memorandum was prepared for DDP Helms.

Murphy wrote:

"Mr. Dulles, with whom I spoke today recalled his

earlier conversation with you on this subject and

said

that there were still some members of the Commission who

were concerned lest they suppress the Nosenko information

now only to have it surface at a future date.

They

expressed concern that this could possibly prejudice

the entire Warren Commission Report."

Murphy responded to Dulles' statement by stating that

the Commission's concern was understandable but that the Agency

felt the Commission's final report should make no mention of

Nosenko's information. Murphy indicated that a possible

alternative would be to use language "which would allude to

the existence of other, unverified information on the Oswald

case." This language, Murphy contended, would permit the

Warren Commission to state, if challenged on this point at a

future time, that it had given consideration to the Nosenko

NW 66000

Murphy continued:

"It was agreed an effort would be made to find such

language if Mr. Dulles is again unsuccessful in

persuading his colleagues to eliminate any reference

to the Nosenko information from the report.

To attempt

this, however, we would have to know precisely in what

context the Warren Commission intended to make use of

the Nosenko information. This, Mr. Dulles will have to

determine from Mr. Rankin. He will do this as soon as

possible. He knows that I am leaving this week and

therefore, will contact you as

soon as he has the informa-

tion he needs from Mr. Rankin."

Whether by design or as an unintended result, the

quoted language indicates that Mr. Dulles, as a member of the

Warren Commission, was prepared to compromise his position

with the Commission in order to supply the CIA, specifically

about

Murphy and Richard Helms, with sensitive information

the Commission's attitudes towards the Nosenko case. It also

appears that the AGency had communicated te Pilles the information

it desired regarding t

Commission position on Nosenko, and

that Dulle

and very well placed informant for the CIA.

Murphy prepared a second memorandum dated 28. July 1964.

information in the Warren Commission's report. Participants

in the discussion upon which the memorandum was based included

Allan Dulles,

Luisa Calderon

Approximately five hours after President Kennedy's

assassination, a Cuban government employee in Mexico City named

"Luisa" received a telephone call from an unidentified man

speaking Spanish.

oy the CIA's

Mexico City Station as the result of its

operation. (op cit) The Mexico City Station identified the

Luisa of the conversation as Luisa Calderon, who was then

employed in the Commercial Attache's office at the Cuban

Consulate.

During the course of the conversation, the unidentified

caller asked Luisa if she had heard the latest news. Luisa

replied in a joking tone:

"Yes, of course, I knew almost before Kennedy."

The callerwent on to tell Luisa that the person

apprehended for Kennedy's slaying was the "President of one of

the Committees of the Fair Play for Cuba." Luisa replied that

she knew this also.

Luisa inquired whether the person being

held for the killing was a gringo.

The unidentified caller

replied, "yes."

Luisa told her caller that she had learned

nothing else about the assassination that she had learned

about the assassination only a little while ago.

The

unidentified caller commented:

Nevertheless, as will be discussed herein, the

However, Calderon's comments were not reported

detained for questioning by the Mexican federal police.

However, Silvia Duran, a friend and associate of Calderon's

and the one person believed to have had repeated contact

with Oswald while he was in Mexico City; was arrested and

questioned by the Mexican police on two separate occasions

(Cites). During her reinterrogation, Duran was questioned

regarding masset his interthy calderon.

No abasision is

given in this report for the questions concerning Calderon

(Cites). The information regarding Duran's interrogation

was passed to the Warren Commission on February 21, 1964

(DDP4-0940), more than two months after Calderon had re-

turned to Cuba.

Calderon's 201 file reveals that she arrived in

Mexico City from Havana on January 16, 1964, carrying

Cuban Passport E/63/7. Her date of birth was believed

to be 1940 (Dispatch,

21612) Calderon's presence in

Mexico City was first reported by the CIA on July 15,

1963 in a dispatch from the CIA's Miami field office to

the CIA's Mexico City station and to the Chief of the CIA's

Special Affairs Staff (for Cuban operations). That dis-

patch had attached to it a report containg biographic data

on personnel then assigned to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico

City. At page three of the attached report Luisa Calderon

was listed as Secretary of the Cuban Embassy's Commercial

office.

The notation indicated that a report was pending

on Calderon. The Agency has attempted, without success,

to locate the report.

On September 1, 1963, a dispatch was sent

from

knowledge of Calderon as follows:

I thought that Luisa Calderon might have

had contact with Oswald because I learned about

17 March 1964, shortly before I made a trip to

Mexico, that she had been involved with an

American in

Mexico. The information to which

I refer was told to me by a DGI case officer...

I had commented to (him) that it seemed strange

that Luisa Calderon was receiving a salary from

the DGI althought she apparently did not do any

work for the Service.

(The case officer) told

me that hers was a peculiar case and that he

himself believed that

she had been recruited

in

Mexico by the Central Intelligence Agency al-

though Manuel Pineiro,

the Head of the DGI, did

not agree.

As I recall, (the case officer) had

investigated Luisa Calderon.

This was because,

during the time she was in Mexico, the DGI had

intercepted

a letter to her by an American who

signed his name OWER (phonetic) or something

similar.

As you know,

the pronunciation of

Anglo-Saxon names is

difficult in Spanish so

I am not sure of how the name mentioned by Hernan-

dez should be spelled.

It could have been "Howard"

or something different.

As I understand the matter,

the letter from the American was a love letter

but indicated that there was a clandestine-

professional relationship between the writer

and

Luisa Calderon.

also understand from (the

case officer) that after the interception of

the letter she had been followed and seen in the

company of an American.. I do not know if this

could have been Oswald...

As cited with regard

to Luisa Calderon, a detec-

tor from the Cuban Intelligence Services provided the

CIA with significant information about Lee Harvey Oswald's -

contacts with the DGI in Mexico City. This defector

was assigned the CIA cryptonym AMMUG-1 (A-1 hereinafter).*

CIA files reveal that A-l defected from the DGI

on April 21, 1964

• when

he defected, A-l possessed a number of DGI documents which

were subsequently turned over to the CIA

IN 68894.

CIA officer,

Joseph H. Langosch, went

/ to meet A-1, debrief

him, and arrange for A-l's

"into the United States.

OSC

(See supra cite.) On May 1, 1964, 22 reels of Langzash's

debriefing of A-l were forwarded to the Chief of the CIA's

special Affairs Stars from the chief of station in

Effective on May 1, A-1 was under contract with

the CIA for operational purposes. (Contract Approving Of-

ficer memo, 6 May 64) By June 23, 1964, Langosch was

convinced that A-l would be of great value to the Agency.

He stated:

There is no question in my mind that AMMUG-1

*It is now known that A-l did provide significant leads to

the CIA regarding Luisa Calderon.

It is further apparent

that little of this information was made available by the

CIA to the Warren Commission.

Therefore, the possibility

exists that A-l had provided

other information to the CIA

that was relevant to the Warren Commission's work but that which

was not properly reported to the Commission.

but found he was inclined to indiscretion because of

a "belligerent" pro-Americanism.

Another CIA officer, David Morales, did not put

it so delicately. He described

Barker as a "loudmouth"

who Morales recommended terminating in 1962. Morales

was concerned that as a result of Barker's Watergate

involvement, he would "tell the authorities everything

he knows. "

Indeed, Barker tended to broadcast his affiliation

with the CIA to the members of the Cuban exile community.

While this was tolerable prior to the Bay of Pigs when

his assignment as liaison between the FRD and the CIA

was overt, post-Bay of Pugs activites required a more

covert approach, according to CIA documentation.

Barker was told to strengthen his cover as a prize

fight manager and use "cut-outs" in his attempts.to

gather information about the activities of the exile

groups. Gradually, he was to cease all direct contact

with the exiles. For a man who had a "love of the

game," and an even greater affinity for the more overt

techniques of investigation and interview, it became

increasingly difficult for Barker to find a niche

in Miami CIA activities.

By the time he was terminated from CIA employment

in 1966, Barker had been involved less and less with
