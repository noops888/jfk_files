ACTION REQUIRED. RIFERENCES

• Action: See below.

1. The purpose of this dispatch is to request Headquarters' assistance

In a problem involving elandestine markings for terminals in a telephone cable

cross box.

2. Specifically, It is desired to have the capabilly of recoguizing whleh

cable corminals in a box are being used for telephone tapplug without having any

niarkings apparent io unauthorized persons.

This system is needed for use in

the event that taps must be disconneciod quickly under the threat of a possible

security problem.

3.

The tap comections are made by LIFEAT telephone company per-

sonnel and the terminals could be marked by them at the time the tap is mude.

The comections sometimes have to be removed by another person wino is not

famillar with the connections.

4. It is felt that i quick deying, transparent glue or lacquer that would

fluoresce brightly under UV Illumination would be uppropriate. A material that

could be removed later by wiping or chipping it away would be desirable bur this

churacteristic is not vital.

5. The system must be usabie in open shade, although some additional

shade might be had by partially closing the doors of the box, and the ligin source

must be portable and it possible have the appearance of an ordinary flashlight.

The light source can be brought within two inches of the terminals.

1. The following report is submitted in accordance with CSFHB-R

A. EXPLOITATION OF LEADS

FI-

(1) LIFEAT/Soviet During the reporting perlod, LIFEAT coverage

of Svyatoslav F. KUZNETSOV provided an important and valuable check con-

firming the reporting of a number of KUBARK controlled double agents targeted

ag inst this Soviet officer. Also, coverage of the Soviet Buller in Office, al-

though nor considered vital, dees complete Station coverage of the Soviet

target and does provide daily inforniation on the activities and contacts of the

Bulletin Office personnel.

(2) LIFEAT/ Polish

LIFEAT continued to provide vital Information

concerning the BEKNAVE/BECHICK operation with coverage of both Individuals

and their daily activities.

(3) LIFEAT/Yugoslav Besides the usual coverage uf day-to-day

activities of the official installation, LIFEAT leads have Indicated the possi-

bility of a suecessful recruitment of a Mexican employee of that installation.

LIFEAT information will become even more valuable for continuing assess-

ment of the potential agent and forming of a plan for approach to the Mexican

In question.

(*) LIFEAT/Communis: Party Coverage In this area gave Statlon

its first informatton concerning the secund arrest of LINLUCK, as well as

providing sonie information on important persons in the Mexican Communist

: (5) LIFEAT/Exile

LIFEAT provides.continuing coverage of the

dally activities and contaers of juan Jose AREVALO Bermejo. Although most

of the loads gathered will depend on. future exploitation, one contact with an

ODYOKE official was noted by LIPEAT (see reference b).

(6). LIFENT/Cuban :

•Of late, much of the cmplials of the LIFEAT

operation has been directed toward support of Station operations in this arca.

COME ONE AN ASTE OLDE

Coverage included monitoring of the actlvities of AMSTET-I for the interested

Case Officer. Tlit information provided daily leads for the Case Ufticer in

his contacts with AMSTET-I. LIFEAT also covered three lines in support

of the AMSTRUT operation.

Of this support the interested Case Officer has

nored LIFEAT provided very valuable coverage of the important AMSTRUT

opcration during October.

The coverage gave valuable operational leads

and resolved wat would otherwise have been arcas of uncertainty or

groundleas suspicion.. This allowed the case officers to move with müre

certainty in developing the opcration than would otherwise have been prudently

possibic. It la noted that LIFEAT's continuing coverage is proving to be most

helpful.

(7) LIFEAT/American Communists LIFEAT cominued to provlde

information of interest to ODENVY. Travel and contacts of the ACGM arc

particularly worthwhile.

(8) LIFEAT/Miscellaneous

LIFEAT continucd it coverage of

former Station asset LIVESTOCK-2. This was in keeping with Station's

policy of making perlodic checks of the activitles of former, potentially

dangerous agents.

It should he nored that It Is the Station's opinion that LIFEAT'S

excellent ovcrall service, plus its ability to provide unilateral coverage of

targets of opportunity on short notice (sometimes on as little as two hours

Statio) make On EAT a dependable dally contributor to the fulfilling of the

B.

PROCESSING OF TAKE

No change from previous report.

C. LIAISON

During the month of October the two playback recorders used by

the ODENVY processor broke down.

These were repaired by the LIFEAT

technician, David M. WILSTED. ODENVY continued to process take from

the LIFEAT/AmerIcan Communists in Mexico lines.

D. SECURITY

There have been no known adverse securiry incidents effecting the

LIFEAT operation during the reporting period. LIFENT meeting sites con-

tinue to be changed periodically. The fourteen regular and six alternate

sites used for daily contact between the Station Case Officer and WILSTED

and Wayne C. DRABAND are considered adequate. Numerous meeting sites

are used for contacts between WILSTED/DRABAND and the basehouse keepers.

E. TECHNICAL.

Audio and dial tape recorders ordered by the Station in support of the

LIFEAT operation began te arrive at the end of October.

These were placed

in immediate service. It is noted that the automatic tape stop on the new

model Revere audio recorder has thus far proven to be of no use to the operation

This coverage providad valuable coerational

support during the period leading up to the recruitment of AMSTRUT-2 giving

¿imely advance information of AMSTRUT-2's arrival in Mexico, as well as

his day to day activities and contacts. Following AMSTRUT-2's recruitment,

LIFEAT gave an excellent account uf AMSTRUT-2's activities for those periods

he was not under the control of his case ufficers. This was invaluable proof

of his full cooperation with KUBARK and added a safety factor for the case

officers making the recruitment and initial handling which would not have been

otherwise available.

(3) LIFEAT/Polish and LIFEAT Yugoslav

These coverages con-

tinue to provide excellent information of the daily activities of the Satellite

officials assigned to Mexico. The LIFEAT support of the BEKNAVE/BECHICK

operation continues as noted in reference.

(4) LIFEAT/Exile

1. The following report is submitted in accordance with CSHB-F 52-6-1;

Section V, paragraph 2 (a) (1).

A. Exploitation of Leads

(1) LIFEAT/SOVIET

With the departure of Vladimir G.

NOVIKOV during the month of August 1962, it was decided that LIFEAT should

pick up coverage of his replacement Svyatoslav F. KUZNETSOV. The contin-

ued coverage of aleksandr G. SIDOROV, which includes extensive periods of

live-monitoring and special processing of the take, is considered essential to

those Station assets involved in the attempt to place the technical surveillanca

noted in last month's report (see reference A). Coverage of the Soviet Bullet in

Office continues to provide interesting personality data on Soviet officials

assigned to Mexico.

(2) LIFEAT/POLISH

LIFEAT coverage in support of the

BEKNAVE/BECHICK operation continues to be vital to that operation. Addi-

tional coverage for this operation has becn undertaken, leads from which will

probably determine future direction of the operation as well as aid KUBARK in

controlling the operation.

(3) LIFEAT/YUGOSLAV

In this area LIFEAT provided the infor-

mation that a cousin of a recently assigned KUBARK deep cover agent, Vicior

W. OBOLD (ps) will be travelling to Mexico inte near tuture. This cousin is

a long-time Communist Party official and a chance meeting with him could

have destroyed OBOLD's carefully prepared cover. Due io LIFEAT advanced

warning, proper security safeguards have been arranged. LIFEAT has also

provided travel information on Yugoslav officials from the United States inich

was of great interest Le ODENVY.

(;) LIFENT/EXILE

LIFEAT coverage in this area has been

midsi rewarüing in providing leads i tire conoels of Juat jose Arovalo Bermejo,

former Guaidmalan President. Spanish Ropublican Exiles were covered for

approviniately one-nald month in August, at which tinie it was decided that the

coverage no longer provided jufficient leads and information in justify con-

tinued LIFEAT effort.

19) LIFEAT/Anerie: Communis: Gioup in Mexico (ACCia)

This coverage is at the request of the local office of ODENVY and the processing

of take in this arca is done by that office.

One of the most interesting items

provide from this coverage was the fact that the American Communists Albert

MALTZ and Margaret Latin MALTZ had separaied and that Albert MALTZ

would probably reside in the U.S. with Margaret renining in Mexico. Con-

cemüg the LIFEAT coverage of the ACGM, ihe local office of ODENVY wrote

on 23 August 1962: "This office feels thai the coverage mentioned is quite

valuable and many useful louds are brained from this coverage, particularly

with regard to iravel in and out

uf Mexico of American Conimunists who are

in contaer with individuals on whom coverage is maintained"

B. Processing of Take

No change from that noted in reference A.

C. Liaison

No change from that noted in reference A.

D. Security

During the early part of August 1962 a group of "coyotes" was uncovered

In the telephone company in Mexico. City and a number of arresis were made.

This group had organized a unir including linemen, ceniralmen, installation

crew, warehousemen, and workers in ihe office responsible for providing ser-

vice to new clients.

It was the purpose of the "coyote": group to provide service.

for a price, to those individuals whose requests for installations had been turned

down by the celephone company due to limited availability of cables and contacts.

(Note: The company generally keops a certain number of "spare pairs" in each

cable for its own use in providing special service, company phones, and for re-

routing during repairs i other cables. It was these spare pairs and contacts

whicl the "coyotes" used to provide illegal phone service.) This lelephone com-

pany within the telephone company would also collect monthly fees from their

"subscribers".

When the story came out, the telephone company had special

police siationed in caci central and spot checks made of linemen and crews to

preven: recurrence.

It was therefore necessary for the LIFEAT linemen to

refrain from any clandestine activity for a period of almost four weeks so as

not l0 be accidentally picked up as a member of the "coyote"

group.

LIFEUD-1

has reported ihut ihe situation is now buck to normal with the special police

details and special checkups terminated. No compromise of ihe LIFEAT oper-

ation resuited.from the above incident.

E. Tecinical

In idlition :o re-supplying LIFEAT with audio recorders (as reported in

reference d), the Station has ordered ren new dial tape recorders for the projeci

Funds for this purpose were included in ihe laiesi Projeci Renewal Requesi

(forwarded dy reference B).

The basenouse opcrators for LIFEAT Annex VI, LIFEUD-5 and LIFEUD- 14,

after a long period uf family disagreements, have mutually decided on a

divorce. Both are being terminated by KUBARK since their userulness as

basehouse deepers for the project will enu with their divorce. The agents have

agreed to the terminat lon and it will be accomplished on a friendly basis.

(Agent Service Records will be forwarded).

Therefore, it has been necessary

to close Annex VI and terminate coverage of the lines provided by that base-

house.

LIFEUD-24 and LIFEUD-26 have been recruited to r'oplace the ter-

minated. couple and are presently looking for a suitable basehouse which could

fully replace ihe uld Annex Vl. (Note: POA was granted fur LIFEUD-24 on 28

June 1962 and OA was requesica. Also, OA was requesied for LIFEUD-26

o11 30 August 1962.)

During the absence uf Woodrow B. CABBOT (ps), the processor of the

Polish language portions of the Polish Embassy take, a replacement in the person

of contact agent BE TUMBLE was provided by Headquarters. He performed well

with no inown security hazard co himself or LIFEAT. BETUMBLE departed

Mexico City on 17 September 1902.

Until CABBOT's return Polish portions of

this take are being translated by ihe Siation Satellite Case Officer.

2. л.

During the month of August 1962, the LIFEAT operation provided

a total of 45 reels of raw take from the ACGM lines to the local ODENVY office

for their processing. In addition, a number of memos were prepared by the

Station for passing to local ODACID and ODENVY based in whole or in part on

LIFEAT provided material.

1. The following report is submitted in accordance with CSHB-F•

52-6-1, Section V. paragraph 2 (u) (1): 1

A. Exploitation of Leuds

(1) LIFEAT/SOVIET

LIFEAT coverage in this area was concentrateu

on known RIS officers: Vladimir G. NOVIKOV and Aleksandr G. SIDOROV.

The most rewarding lead from this coverage during July was chat SIDOROV

would be absent with his entre family from his apartment for nearly two

months, and more importantly, that no one would be concinuously watching

the apartment during that tune.. Based of this intormation, the Siation has

been able to iske the necessary preparations for establishing recinical

surveillance of this apartment. LIFEAT coverage of the Sovie. Bulletl

Office, in addition io the above coverages, has provided information on the

dally acrivities of Individual Sovlet officlals assigned io Mexico, including

collection of travel and blographical data.

(2) LIFEAT/POLISH LIFEAT coverage has been vital to the

BEKNAVE/BECHICK operation. LIFEAT has even provided live-monitoring

of an international call to BECHICK from & former admirer. Also in the

Pollsh ares, LIFEAT provided names of Polish Embassy contacts who vere

Invited to Polish national holiday celebrations at the Polish Embussy, as

well as information concerning the impending arrival of the new Polish Im-

(3) LIFEAT/YUGOSLAV In the Siation's increased operations

against this target, basic biographical, personnel assignment, and personnel

dally activity information is essential.

LIFEAT has been providing jus:

this type information since coverage commenced in May.

(!) LIFEAT/EXILE LIFENT coverage of exile and revolutionary

groups ias been concentrated on coverage of Contral American and.

Spanish Republican groups and Individuals. Coverage of Juan Jose

AREVALO Bermojo, former Prestost of Guatemala, has provided the

Station with valuable Informatlon concerning his contacts and future

plans.

Furdier. LIFEAT COvered LIGIRD-I's contaci.wil AREVALO

and later revealed AREVALO's convicton that the Station asset, LIGIRD-I,

is invoired in i plot to assasstate AREVALO.

Coverage of Spanish

Republicans displayed the Internal dissentions aroused sy the plans

of a small group of the Moxico-based exiles to assassinate certain

promient persons with plastle bombs. and ultmately cold of the departure

from Mexleo :o Cuba of two Individuals Implicated in the plot.

(5) LIFEAT/American Communist Group in Mexico (ACGM)

Targers covered in this category ure in answer to a long standing require-

ment lald on by ODENVY and approved by Headquarters.

In the past

ODENVY has noted the coverage is valuable and worthwhile to them. As

in the pis: rellable Information was provided on the activitles, travel, and

coiltacts of the ACGM.

B. Processing of the Take

• LIFEAT processors continue to process ill take for the LIFEAT

operation except for the three ACGM ines which are processed by the

local ODENVY office.

C. Liaison

No change.

D. Security

No security Incidents directly affecting the operation or future of

LIFEAT were noted during July 1962. The assignment of special telephone

company crews to make a survey of spire telephone lines avallable for

use of new subseribers may cause problems when these crews uncover a

"spare" line used in i LIFEAT coverage. However, since these crews

have no au:hority (or destre) to trace down the lines to their ultimate

destination, normal LIFEAT security pracilces should negate this danger.

A secund development which could cause future problems is the possible

assignment of a LIENVOY technician to check telephone centrals to see

exactly who else may be carrying.on LlENVOY type work. As of this date

LIFEAT personel, wno have been provided with the true name of this

individual, have never heard of him working in any central in Mexico City.

As of this moment it appears

this will not develop into a threat co

LIFEAT operaclons..

E. Tecinical

New recorders provided in May to LIFEAT are now in operation and

appear superior to previous models used.

It is planned, with the approval

of Project LIFEAT for BY 1963, to completely re-equip LIFEAT with new

recorders and possibly dial tape recorders.

F. Coverage

During the month of July 1962. LIFEAT covered a local of 16 carget

lines. Specifically, the coverage by urger was as follows:

recelve emphasis from the LIFEAT operation during the reporting period.

The approprlaie Casc Officer considers the check of penetration agents

LITAMIL-3, LITAINT-7, and LITALUS-3 through LIFEAT to be of

utmost value In controlling these agents and checking their activitles.

In additlon, LIPEAT provided extremely valuable information in the

defection of Jose PARDO Llada, giving leads for both Fl and PP

exploitation. Ald was also given in providing a check of the AMIRON

AWOLS in Mexico, In a related occurance, LIFEAT provided informa-

tion that Indicates the Cuban Embassy in Mexico is being used as a

Guatemalan Communist communication channel to exiles in Cuba.

LIFEAT also provided daily information on travellers to Cuba.

(2) LIFEAT/LITMUS provided information for use in

the BECORN operation. It is also of continuing importance as a daily

check on the activities of the LITMUS personnel in Mexico.

(3) During the recent Latin American "Peace Confer

ence", LIFEN'T provided information on the delegates to the Conference,

especially the U.S. de'egates, as well as the activities of the Confer-

ence.

LIFENT/LIERODE continued is provide excellent amerage

of the activities of the Cuban Embassy staff, particularly provlling expioisable

coverage of Cuban Arelligence avilvities. Of major importance during tie

month of June was the acquisition of leads on the activities uf Cuban "tourist"

Francisco DELGADO Garcia. As a result of these leads, passed to the

Mexican goveramen: in disguised form, DELGADO as arrested on the night

of 7 July and thereader deporied. LIFEAT information also enabled the

responsible Case Officer to alert agent LIMASK to threats made by DELGADO

to have LIMASK arrested,

The LIERODE related awerage of the telepione of

LIFEAT/LITMUS provided information on the activities of

the Pollsh Legarion during June, particularly notig the travel plais of Poiish

LIFEAT coverage uf a member of the Mexican Communist

Party (PCM) is used in checking the veracity of Jua:: Luis CAMPUS Villalsbos

who is of interest to the Station's Communist Pary Penetration Program.

LIFEAT also agreed to suppor: Project LIENVOY in the

processing of the Salet take when LIENVOY picked up coverage of the Sorter

This is exacily the work previously done by

ZINSMEISTER and the only difference is that tapes are made at 1 different

location.

Herever, this dues roquire close coordination within the Station of

these die operations.

Sovier corerage.from LIFENT responsibility (sec SECURITY below) and the

"outage" experienced earlier in June on iwo of the most protuctive Sovlet

lines, is the esirene drop in the priluction of positive inielligence from

LIFEAT codiage. It is hoped that with more lintensive exploitation of the

coverage still available, plus expluitation of new lives being installed by LIFEAT,

that the production of positive huelligence will again measure up io that previously

provided by LIFEAT.

c. Llaison

No chalge other than the closer inter-office liaison with

Project LIENVOY due to the above noted LIFEAT processing of LIENVOY take

and the increased reel and finished product exchange this entalls.

d. Security

On 21 June 1960 LITENSOR suggested to OOS thar LIENVOY

begin operations ag:inst the Sovler and Satellite targets in Mexico City. In

order not to indicare thar the unilateral LIFEAT operation was providing this

coverage, it was necessary for COS to agree to this suggestion. So as not to

jeapordize LIFEAT operatlons and personnel, LIFEAT corerage was suspended

on the Soviet Embassy and Polish Legation, and the applicable

"crossea" were

pulled and cleaned, This was accomplished by 1030 on 22 June 1960. Coverage

continued on the home of Aleksandr BEKIER, Pollsh Conselor of Legation, since

no security problem seemed to be raised by continued coverage of this line.

REF: HARMA -15170, RYRAT-1402

On the evening of ls June COS met with LITENSOR al the home of LIELEGANT

(8e0 MEXI-5761). Among other subjeces discussed, LITENSOR urgently

suggestod thas OUS arrange coverage of tne Sovlet/arellio Inatallatlons.

Since this coverage ly obvlously one of great laterest to KUBARK, COS was

left with no alternative bur to euthuskistically accept LITENSOil's suggestion.

LIELEGINT was equally enchus lastle abour the suggestion and requeriod COS

to furalad a list of target lines as soon as possible. On 2l June Malcolm Q.

EDELAND passed to LIENVOY/2 a lLit of + Sovlet, 2 Poltsii, 2 Czech and 2 Yugo-

slay lines. The Polish, the Czech, Yugoslav and I Sorle lue were placed ivitin

two days.

Maanwhlle all LIFEAT Sovic/ Suiellite Ilizo were removed. Alter

due conjidoration ll was decided to advise LILNVOY /2 tat we would prefer lo

drop the 2 Pollan lines and st leser one Yugoslay lie and bas all remainlig

avallable lines (LIENVOY can handle a maximurn di 30 laid, always keeping

two spares) so cover & rotal of five Sorlet Itnus and keeplag the two Czech nea

already la operarion. Thts wis agreeu to but the lour additional Sovler lines

could uns be placed immedlitaly due to tha remporary abuence froin tire cily of

LIENVOY/3 whose ald was needed to fulfull tils assignorent.

The evenrually of a request from ilgh Mexican officlals for LIENVOY coverage

of Sorles/Sarellute wlth lla attcduns uffect upon LIFEAT bad been foresten by

Or us least two previous occastons when a hint was

made to COS by lesser officlal: than LITENSOR, COS vas able to disguide

these afficlale on the busly of lack of quallfled personnel for processing, trang-

erlbing, and exploliing the take this would come from lags agallis linvler,..

Sarelite installattone. However, on the above occasion shes LITENSOR crea

went so far as to suggear that the trauilicons could be handlud by language

experts 8t Headquartera COS wa:; In so positlon to argue chlu point with

LITENSOR. The actual Impiementarton of the change over of Sorkr/Satellio

coxcrage from LIFEAT LO LIENVOY (LINEN'T went back on Pollsh Legation In

late lune) was accomplished smoothly, with no flape and the Starian does nor en-

visten any probiema, certainly, In the Immedlate laure.

The processlag and trunnerlbing is being handled la crucily tis same fashlon as

before d.e., LIENVOY lo doing the taps only, LiFENT personnel are processlng

the tapes from LIENVOY. As far as tie Mexicans are concerned, tie tapes aro

belng forwardid to ileadquarters for proceastag with the transcriptions belag

sent back to the Station for our Information.. The Station has promised

a. Expiviration of Leads

Lace

During the month of May 1960, Project LIFEAT continuel to provide

excellent coverage of the activities of the ufficial Soviet and Cuban installations

in Mexico City, the Station's top priority targets. The following are specific,

though necessarily selective, contributions made by LIFEAT through provision of

exploitable leads and suppori to Mexico City Station.

1) The most outstanding single contribution of the LIMERICK

phase of Project LIFEAT during the period of this monthly review was the

providing of information to the responsible Case Ofticer which confirmed the

validity of agent LITARDY-1. This double agent turned himself into ODENVY,

and thus to KUBARK, during the latter par. of the review period. LIFEAT/

LIMERICK provided dara on the acilvittes and Sovter contacts of LITARDY-1,

thus enabling the case oficer to adequately plan productive use of this neir asset.

2) LIMERICK continued lo provide Project LIMESA with suppori

in the form of information on goods and services provided to the Soviets from

the local economy. Of special interest was information on specific aparments

which the Soviets were considering renting. LIMERICK also continued to provide

valuable information on Soviet commercial activities which has been repuried

separitely.

3) Also provide ivas Information of a CE nature concerning

specific assiguments of personel withui the Soviet Embassy, advance travel

plans of Soviet ofitcials, and arrivals, departures, and addresses of Embassy

staff members. The following are examples of this category of information:

a) Vitaliy Borisovich SHUBIN arrived ll May 1950 and

is probably the Intelligece Officer replacement for Yevgenly LAPSHEV. The

address of SHUBIN was also provided by LIFEAT.

b) Aleksandr BROVKIN was assigned dutles as Assistant

Cultural Officer io replace Vladimir NOVIKOV during the latter's home leave.

c) Valentin BAKULIN was appointed Soriet Film Ofticer

in charge of distribution of Soviat films, including propaganda films.

d) Advance notice was given of the 20 May arrivai of the

Soviet delegation to the International Cotton Conference held in Mexico City,

and nored that the delegation sould be composed of Dmitriy MAITOV, Boris

FIRSOV, Abdull SULTANAHODZKAYEV, and Vladilyena TERESHCHINA.

9). Aurice aforination was provided on the following

rrivei: Soviet Ambassidor 3NZNKIN to leave 21 june 1960 for home leave in

the USSR; plined departure of Vladimir NOVIKOV, Cultural Officer, for home

leave in the USSK and returi to Mexien; departure for home leave 31 May 1960

vi kno..n RIS officer Colone! Dinitriy KUZNETSOV; that thirtecy Soviat ofticlals

are returning to the USSR durlig the months of july and Augurt 1900 with no

indicirion that these are to he replaced (Five of these are known RIS officers;

Yuriy CHELPANOV, Pavel KOVALEV, Yevgenly LAPSHEV, Vladinir M.KOVKIN,

and Grigeri YEFREMOV).

4). Due to advance information provide through LIFEAT/LITMUS,

the Station was able to cover a clandestine inecting of Alexindr BEKIER, Polish

Counselor of Legation in Mexico, and provide identification of BEKIER's contact.

•Through corduation with MKCHARITY and the Staton's KURIOT representative,

both radio and photo surveillance of the meeting vere arranged.

5) LIFEAT/LIERODE sigulficantly supported the Station's

efforts in the Cuban operations field by providing leads that lead to and assisted

in the recruitment of agent LITALUS-3, a penetration of the Cuban Embassy who

Is to be handled by LITALUS-I. LIERODE is also utilized ag. 1 contInuing check

on the activities of the newly recruited agent.

6) 'The Station's CE priority has been supported through coverage

of the phone used by PCM neinbers juani Luis CAMPOS Villalobos and Marlo PEREZ

Marlil. This coverage has provided information of value concerning addresses,

phone numbers, and contacis of other PCM members. It has also beca employed

as i cross-check of statements made by CAMPOS to Howard O. MOSCHIANO.

7) LIFEAT provided information on travel planned and

accoinplished by associates of the Americin Communist Group i. Mexicn (ACUM)

particularly that of Maria WICHER to Moscow, the return of Alber: MALTZ to

Mexico, and the planned travel of Noah SEBORER to Moscor In Augusi.

b. Processing of Matertal

During the month of May 1960, the quanticy of raw information

processed was noticeably reduced, and thus the amount of postrive intelligence

derived was also reduced, due to the "outage"' On certain of the most producilve

LIFEAT Ines. Prircipally Involved were the Soviet lies, including one week

break on a. Embassy line, three weeks On the Soviet Motion Picture Office line,

and one reek on the Soviet Commercial Office line.

These "outages" were

primarily due to the telephole company pulling the LIFEAT crosses, or the

targei telephone beig out of order.

c. Llaison

As in the past, the only liaison connected with Project LIFEAT Is

in passing reels from coverage of the American Communists. in Mexico to

ODENVY for their processing. Nu other laison is considered necessary or

desireable.

d. Security.

No security problems arose that were not readily solved by the

persomal concerned, nor dil these jeopardize the operation.

SUBJECT?

LIFEAT

1.

During uy recent visit to Moxico I had a good charco to go

over many of the ins-and-outs nê this projoct with the Case Officer

and with other officers in the station.

At Station staff neoting I

stated that reporting on CI naterial dorived from thu project vas

Inadoquate and COS appeared to so along with this view.

The concensus

I got. fron the Carn Officers was that the SP. Case Officer is not

sufflelently alert to the need tur reportine or tho Cl aspects of

thn matter and is liniting hinself to strictly servicing Si. Division

mattors.

Various Case Officers eited Instances to me of convorsations

pointing to new clandestine relarionships or containing previoualy

known clandestine relationships in the soviet field which have not

been reportod.

Owing to a laci of time, I was unablo to oxamine the

records myself, but I an inclinei lo accept those statements as true.

2.

The Caso Officer gave se a general run-down of tho situation

of tho agents on this projoct and it appears that everything is running

very well.

Ho told se that in l's new project outline, which will

be up in a weel: or two, ho is including some raises to some of the

agents.

He told re that on his last round of pay raises ho had some

difficulty hero at hcadquarters.

If any difficulty scams forthconing

this time, I should liho to have the matter brought to my attention

V

because,

as you know, I feel very strongly on

this matter and fought

tho sano battlos. with headquarters for at least five years.

3.

In speaking with the case Officers or. the Cuban side,

as well

as on

the CI, it was apparent thai LIFFAT remains probably the biggest

single source nf information availablo to the lexico City Station

and that every effort should he rade to continue its srooth functioning.

If this means a couple of hundred pesos increase to each agent semi-annually

or annually, it does not seem to lie too much of a strain and I do not

see why we should have any troukle. When I corpare the salaries of

the base operatorg and processors on this project, especially consicering

the illegal position they are in, with those of relatively unproductive

agents elsewhere in Vexdeo and in. zany other Stations, I cannot help

but feei that we are bujing a nest deal for our money in this project.

MEMOPAY DUM FOR THIS RECURD

SUBJECT& DEBRIEFING OP LAVID M. WILSTED (ps)

On 1 June 1960 Mr. John ü. Heyn ard Mr. Jolin Kennedy of WiD,

Mr. Robert, Brown of CI/OPS,

'4r. Robert Bryant of PI/OPS and Mr. Charles

Bray of FI/D not with lard M. WILSTED (Es).

WILSTSD ampharizes that the whole telephone system in Mexdco

City is undergoing a reforzation.

The company Telofonos da Meráco, S.A.,

has sub-contractod this work of cleaning up and reorganizing the phone

system to the independent fira, Intel.

They are cleaning up unused and

old Ilnes, putting in ney a spare lines, redefining exchange areas,

laying underground cables, etc.

Eventially we should be batter off ba-

cause there should be, more surplus lines.

The renovation work has

hampered much of the LIzaT work, principally because many of the lines

now. are underground and ve camot get access to them beforo they enter

tho central.

This is particularly trus with respect to the Crech En-

bassy, to whose telephone lies we cannot obtain access from the vantage

point we now occupy.

WILSTED sald that so try to keep track of the activitios of

"Intel" but since they see= to attack "Colonias" at random, we have no

prior waming of their presence in a cortain area.

In the recent far, "axico hes been using houses for listing

for security reasons. de have more control over the access of

phone company inspectors nir repairman to houses. However, under new

regulations, all neu aparteer: buildings must have telephono lines 1r-

stalled in the building by ise phone comoany during the construction

This means that the lines and their destination are concealed.

phastED proposed that thia vill man we can again uso apartments since

we can siphon off a line lastined for use by another tenant in such a

way that the phone company careot trace its destination without tearing

the building apart and me can then fistall a soparate line to the build-

ing and hook up the subscriber to this line which, if chocked, will

belong to a legitimato subscriber.:

•One system which has been used effectively is to take 0n9-balf

of tho separate pairs which hars one faulty line each. These two half

pairs then form one good pair shich wa

WILSTED explained that it cost about 3000 pesos to get &

This antilla the purchase of a telephone company

1. The following report is submitted In accordance with CSHB-F 52-6-1,

section V, paragraph 2 (d) (1):

a.

Exploitation of Leads

The LIMERICK phase of the LIFEAT operation Is able

continuously to provide the interested case officers with background personalicy

information on the members of the Soviet Embassy staff, as well as travel infor-

mation on Soviet officials and diplomatic courters.

During the month of April

1960, this type of Information was exploited for the following:

a) Viktor Nikolayevich GLOTOV, First Secrotary,

will be the replacement for Vladimtr Georgiyevich NOVIKOV

as Cultural Officer when the latter leaves for the USSR on

29 May 1960. He will also act as the Sovier Ambassador's

executive secretary during the home leave of Vladimir Ivan-

ovich CHERNYSHEV. CHERNYSHEV departed for leave Of aN sus

17 April:

b) Nikolai ZHOUGANOV was the replacement fox

Anatolly Konstantinovich YEMELYANOV, Commercial

Office employee who works "upstairs" In the Chancellery.

rather than in the Commercial Office. This Indicated

that ZHOUGANOV may be a code clerk.

Pt

c) Confirmation that four allens are employed in the

Chancery as reachers, one of whom teaches English.

d) Indications uf Increased contact benseen the Sovlet

and Cuban officials as noted in the travel of Soviet officers

to Havana and conversations berween the Cuban Embassy

and the Soviet Ambassador indicating an announcement of

importance was to be made on 8 May, possibly concerning

the establishment of diplomatic relations berween Cuba

aiid the USSR.

e) Through the review of past LIFEAT traffic and

the direct statements of the Soviet Embassy personnel in

discussions of "duty rosters",

, it has been deterinined that

a reduction in the Embassy staff is in progress.

Future

LIFEAT information should disclose whether this reduction

is of a permanent or temporary nature.

1) Advance travel notice on Sovlers, such as CHERNYSHEV,

NOVIKOV, Sencon FEDOROV, ind couriers Vladimir BYKOV

and Valent in KUZNETSOV.

LIFEAT/LIMERICK also revealed a serious rift which has

developed between the Soviet Commercial Office and one of its primary commercial

contacts, Mony DESWAAN, over the latter's fallure to pay the Soviets for two

shipments of Russtan form tractors for which DESWAAN has received plyment

from the Mexican Government, the ultimate purchaser. LIFEAT indicates

DESWAAN has made himself unavallable to the Soviets since no of his chocks

have "bounced" for lacks of funds. LIFEAT further noted that the Soviets are

concerned over reports that DESWAAN is planning an carly summer trip to

Europe with his entire family.

LIMERICK provided valuable support to the Station's A IMPULSE

operation by furntshing detailed Information on the DuSwuan and Esteve Brothers

commercial dealings with the Sovlets.

It was also employed as a security device

after the conclusion of the above operation.

Leads were provided on two properties of Interest to the Soviets,

Calle Mazatlan #208 and Calle Chilpancingo #13, which were a valuable contribution

to the LIMESA Project.

Il)

LIFEAT/LITMUS was the source uf Information on the arrival in

and departure from Mexico City of Polish officials Jozef WINEWICZ, former

Pollsh Ambassador to Washington, and Boleslaw JELEN.

IID LIFEAT/LIERODE continued to provide excellent operational

leads concerning Cuban and exile operations. Of particular note was the ability

of Station Mexico to warn an ODACID officer of a possible "walk-in"' provocation

attempt by an agent of the Cuban Embassy. LIERODE also provided information

on four American cittzens who entered Mexico on their way to Honduras to join

an antl-Somoza revolutionary attempt.

b. Processing uf Material

Although the LIFEAT project must be considered primartly a

Station support project, an effort to further exploit LIFEAT for positive

intelligence has been made by assigning the assistant case officer the task of

coordinating the efforts of the appropriate area case officers and the Station

reports officer in matters concerning LIFENT produced Information. Although

this system has been tested only during the month of Apru, it is hoped that it

will prove of value in increasing the positive Intelligence take from LIFEAT

provided material.

No change was made in the manner of processing the raw LIFEAT

recis during the month of April.

c.. Liaison

As in the past, the only liaison connected with Project LIFEAT

is in passing reels from coverage of the American Communists in Mexico to

ODENVY for their processing. No other liaison is considered necessary or

desireable.

d. Security

LIFEAT/LIVERY continued to remain out of operation due to the

extensive telephone company installation and renovation work being carried on

in the vicinity of the LIVERY basehouse. No definite date can be given for the

completion of the telephone company work.
