I Backroun
:
:
TS. Le travelled to the dile and Far cast via the Train-african
ferry route, visiting Dưng, Insta, as the file East. She had extensive epror
tunities for Coral and informal conversation with the major military and
political figures, as well as various operating atzen, soldiers, and
correspondents. She carefully distinguished the quality of her sources,
indicating where her views were based on observed fects, official statements,
or gossip.
II Burma and China
irs. Luce arrived at Lashio at the time of the visit of Chlang and
Indanh: Chiang. Their intervention ation was requi mited not only to facilitate
cooperation between the British and Genere rad Stillwell's Chinese forces,
but also to enforce discipline on the Chiese generals noal nominally inder
Stillwell. It was rumored that a major coortunity to cefoot the Japanese
was lost at Tongou due to the unwillingness of the Chinese generals to obey
Stillwell and attack. The arrival ival of the Chian Chuangs was la as immediately known to
the Japanese who bombed the headquarters area for the first time in force.
Harrislay, which is. Luce s Lice saw immediately after the main bombing attack
carly in April, was leveled and deserted, with two to ive thousand dead
left in the ruins.
In a a Jont-conversation with Madame Chieng great bitterness was expressed
against the British. Madame Chiang went back to Hong Kong, the Treaty Forts,
and the Chiumar, ending up with avell's Faliro to accept Chineso assist-
ance in Durni. Hadame Chiang indicated, however, that she would not accept
a negotiaten peace under any circumstances with the Japanese, recalling the
Japanese occupation of. Ranking. Undor questioning irs. Luce stated that.
nhe did not believe the nenese would nove in force against China. All
Intelligence sources in Chuking believe that the Japanese will move against
Russia before June of this year. as for india lars. Luce stated that a full-
fledged invasion by land forces seemed likely in the immediate future,
but that bombing attacks on the Calcutta arda were very likely - these
designed to exploit the political instability there and the concentration
of Indian industrial strength.
In general irs. Luce believes that the British in Burma fought as well.
as their resources permitted. The R.A.F. was bonbed out of agur early,
leaving the main operations without air protection. The British claim that
their radio directional finders were sabotaged by the Burmese Fifth Column;
olsewhere gossip stated that the fincers had been thờram prior to the
Japanese attack. The one huntred British tanks proved ineffective as the
main higmay, on which they could operate, was flanked by forests through
which the Japanese filtered. The presence of American technicians in the
Burma oil fields probably guaranteed thorough destruction. Elsewhere there
was "no, carth worth scorching". The British General Alexander expressed
the general belief that the failure in curan was, in the long run, un-
important; that after the defeat of fer the Japanese could easily be
driven out. This blandness seened to characterize-the view of almost
all Britishers in the Far East, although the vicercy of India expressed
regret that, for the sake of the Indians, British control in India would
"not survive another fifty years".
lirs. Luce visited the headquarters of the ... She expressed the
hope that they would not be kept alive as a unit, but that their experience
in fighting Japanese planes would be transferred to American pilots in
training, especially at Karachi. She felt that neither the A.V.G. nor General
Stillwell should return to China, despite their obvious value in maintaining
and merican link and American prestige. General Stillwell has apparently
cist nguished himself, under host trying circinsta.ces, by his comradeship
with the Chinese and his willingness to share front-line cancers and hard-
shins. At a time when the Chinese are extremely sensitive, General Still-
well's attitude and action were of great importance.
III India
Indian morale is extremely low, lover in fact than before the Cripps
Mission. The net result of the Mission appears nerely to have strengthened
Gandhi and the policy of passive resistance. Mrs. Luce believes, however,
that, in a short run at least, there is nothing wrong with the morale of
the Indians and the Chinese that could not be corrected by a couple of
substantial victories. Tavell, in a letter to rs. Lucé éxpressed himself
as more concerned about I dian norele and possible military consequences
of that situation, than with the strictly military aspects of defense.
rs. Luce spoke very highly of General Brereton as a member "of that new
race, the air man". It is Brereton's view that no important action should
be taken by the air force under his command until they are in a position
of local superiority; he did, however, "lear a little", by bombing the Andaman
Islands and Kangoon. irs. Luce believes that a first-line air force main-
tained at 300 planes in India could defeat the Japanese in any move in thet
direction.
IV Middle Fast
:
General axwell is reported to be extremely popular in the Middle
East; while General Adler was unpopular, possibly cue to his forthrightness
in criticising the British methods. ars. Luce visited the most advanced
tank station in the British controlled desert area. She found numerous
complaints, not specified, about American equipment. In general, however,
she holds that the British have cone a good job in the desert.
The British in, Cairo have had extensive and chronic difficulties with
: their various allies. A Jugoslav revolution alnost took place in Cairo
while she was there. The Poles, Jugoslavs and French appear unwilling to
enter British air units but hold out for independent air squadrons. The
one hundred thousand Foles, "dunged across the border by Russia" were
reported by gossip to have been turned down by wavell and Auchinlech,
successively, and then shipped to Britain. Mirs. Luce stated that the
British have been steadily making trouble on behalf of their
minor allies; and that the allies now overestimate their contribution
to the waveffort and steadily nake trouble.
The biggest problem, however, throughout Africa and the Middle East,
is that of inducing a shorter turn around for shipping, at every port the
complaint is the sare, to blaze bein distributed between British administra-
tors and the American Maritime Unions. The flow of planes over the Trans-
African route was, at the time of irs. Luce's passage, very thin. She
reported, heavy fighter plane losses by crack-up; and a total lack of
preparedness against air attack (in Liberia, Takorodi, Lagos, Fort Lazy,
etc.).
:
Kurs, Luce passen along a statement from a Free French Administrator
in Lagos that extensive air preparations are under way in morocco; and she
quoted Perry Jester, American Consul at Lagos, now in the United States, ag
believing that it would still be possible to win over various Vichy agents
and territories in Fest Africa.

Report by Mr. Jester, Consul at Lacos
May 5, 1942
In the early part of April the attached
abstract of file 1896 (accessioned about April 1)
was prepared at the request of Wr. Shapiro. There
subsequently came to the attention of the African
Section the attached memorandum to Colonel Donovan
from 4. Mabel on the sare subject. It could appear
that (1) Colonel Donovan must have seen ir label's
memorandum of warch 12 already and (2) that the
present abstract of file 1896 13 now possibly in-
appropriate.
Lest this very important matter may have
become sidetracked or aislaid through some accident
of routine, I send you herewith all the pertinent
data of which I have knowledge,

ABSTRACT OF FILE 1896
Subjects Report of Perry N. Jester re Organization of Consular
Service in West Africa
Τοι
Prank Vauran
1. Mr. Kauran believes that "American activities (To
sumably all activities besides shipping) must be coordinated."
2. Mr. Jester believes his reports and recommendations
to the State Department are filed without adecuate tudy.
3. Hr. Jestor remarks that "one of our most important
and urgent needs....is a better set up of our consular repre-
sentation (in host Africa)". He is "firaly conviced" thets
a. The Lagos office should be a Consulate-General.
b. That other consular representatives in British
West Aprica should report through and coordinate with the
Lagos office.
c. That independently reporting consuls at other
posts in British hest Africa should not be appointed.
d. That the Consul General should be a ranking
Foreign Service Officer (of Class 4) middle-aged and experienced.
e. That the U. 5. Consular organization in dest
Africa should be set up in accord with the controlling economic
and political factors on the coast.
our
f. That the best organization would be as follows:
Laos Consul General (to be concerned with
"larger issues of our over-all policy, our trade policy,
relations with west Aerican governments, the effect of British
Colonial policy on our interests and the relations (in cooperation
#ith an independent American Consul atar) of British and
Prench colonies and policies.
2.
Two Consular officers (to de cencemed with
Nigerian problems alone.)
:
Accra Cne Consul (to be congerded with
Gold Ceest problems, Accra being the military center of P.8.A.
and of importance principally for the shipment of bauxite,
mahogany and can anese).
Freetown One Consular rent (because of the
Naval importance of Freetown).
Kathunst- one Consuing Agent (because of the
Importance of this point to air communications). This would
be welcomed by the Governor of Cambia.
Mese recommendations and opinions and the irregular
method used of bringing them to to attention are arrived at from
a consideretion of the following points:
a.
Hr. Jester has no personal interest since his
tour of West Africa is alsost finished.
;
b.
Lagos is the political and economic center of
British west Africa with a larger territsay, larger population,
and larger commerce then any other colony.
c.
Lacos is the seat of the British West African
Governor's Conference and this arrangement after the war is
believed certain to continte anddto develop into a Governor
Generalship of British Wos: Africa.
٦٠٠
d. The headquarters of the principal oil, shipping
and trading companies is it Lagos.
Lagos was the site of heademasters of the Franck
e.
Economic. Mission.
f. Hot only nor but after the wastest Africaill be
of increasing importance to the U.S. since Fritish discrimination
against U.S. trade will nevitably decline and develorment of our
Opportunities could now de faplemented by strong and efficient
consular representation.
4. "The official Ul. activities in the Cola Const are in an
uncoordinated mess", as a result overlapping of whetion and ac-
tivities and division of authority of the
