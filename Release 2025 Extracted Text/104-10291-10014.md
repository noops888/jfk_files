My request, through the support officor of the Staff to

tand Disability System

I.. As you may know, we are in the: proced

reviewing the employment

history and

current carcer field of all emplogees in the Agency to identify

those who are eligible for designation as a participant in the new ClA

Retirement and Disability Sisten.

In this process, che initial revlew of

each case 1s made by the indiridual's Career Service, If. the Head of his

Career Service nominates him dur participation in the System, this nomina-

tion la reviewed by the ClA frairement Board ahich recommends final action

to me. However, If the lead ol the Career Service aduises that the employee

does not meet the basic requiraents of HR 30-50 fur participation, I have

accepted this finding without further reviou by the flA Retirement Board.

This practice has been adopted in the interest of expediting this screening

procens so that those employces sno are eligible do participate in the sys-

tem may be designated participants as soon as possible.

2. In your case, the Hea' of your Career Service has advised me that

you do not meet the requiremenis of HR 20-50 for designation as a partici-

pant and I have accordingly mair the formal determination required by the

regulation that you are not elijible for designation.

From a revlew of your

record it appeara that the decision of your tareer Service was based upon

che fact that you have 15 years or more of Agency service, but have not as

yet performed 60 months of qualifying service as required by regulation. My

determination that you are not eligible at this time for designation in no

way affects your current status under the Ciril Service Retirement System,

nor does lt preclude reconsideration of your cligibility

to participate in

the ClA System 1f you should art the requirements for designation in the

future.

Should you desire

furcher information concerning the requirements

for designation

as a participert in the CIA Retirement System, I suggest that

you read paragraph. e of HR 20-50 and paragraph s of the Employee Bulletin

dated 30 July 1965, entitled "Public

Law 88-643. The Central Intelllgence

Agency Retirement Act of 1904 for Certain Employees."

It is always possible that the records upon which the determination

made in your case may have born incomplete or inaccurate regarding your actual

employment history with the dorrcy.

If, after studying the materials cited

you have questions regarding the determination chat you are not elagi-

ble to participate in the Cla irtirement System, please feel free to contact

officials of your Career Service.

They are familiar with the detaila of your

case and will gladly discuss then with you.

In addition, you may wish to dis

cuss your case with

the ClA friirement Stai: located in Room 205, Magazine

Building (extension 2847).

li such discussions do not resolve any questions

your elicitility, you may

considered by

the ClA Retirenero Board.

in 30 days of the date

O'NEAL, Birch D.

Reference to your memorandum concerning return to duty of Subject

sometime prior to l December 1951, this office will endeavor to comply

with your proposals. I might say that Mr. O'Neal has done a sujerlor job

as Alien Alfairs Officer fur the Agency, There has been some thought

given to transferring the Alien Affairs Branch from I&S to the immediate

office of Mi. Dulles, and it is impossible to give a positive guarantee of

his availability, which in that case would be dependent upon Mr. Dulles'

decision.

fleel, however, that OSO could at least tentatively plan along the

line of your proposal.

The cooperation of the ADSO and Chief, FDI, ir

making Mr. O'Neal available has been sincerely appreciated.
