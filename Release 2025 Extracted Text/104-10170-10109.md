Division dierined afier review that thore vore

Specifically the report

describes in a critical and subjective may various

French govermental entities and French personalities

living and dead.

The knowledge by the current

Fronch government that this particular information,

or general information of this

same type, had been

circulated at high levels of the u.s.

government

would be detrimental to curront U.S./ French foreign

relations.

Further, one of the individuals

and cabinet officer. Relations with the French

former French intelligence operative

liaison servicts

are presently reasonably good,

and disclosure of informition of this sort would

undoubtedly have a detrimental effect on future U.S.

probable spill-over effect on U.S./French foreign

relations.

(U) Background:

a .

Subject submitted a request under FOlA, on

22 March 1976, for any and all information the

held on "A Quaker Action Group" also known as "AOAG."

In the 20 July 1976 initial response, 24 newspaper

"clippings

and one leaflet were released to him; two

ducuments were denied.

On 23 August 1976 Subject appealed,

requesting

that further information be relcased to him on

the group.

c. During

the appeals review ll additional documents

were located and are included in the recommendations

below. These documents were not considered during the initial

they were not considered to meet the criteria

"records" extant at that time and they contained only

incidental references to the subject of the request.

d.

During the appeals review we were unable to

identify any Air Force documents concerning the subject

of this request.

The requester should be told that this

was apparently an error.

c.

During the appeals review we were unable to

identify any Department

of State documents concerning

A Quaker Action Group.

The requestor should be

informed that this was also apparently an error.

3. (C) Recommendations:

My specific recommendations are shown on the

Appeals Reviow Form attached to each document.

classification review has been conducted and all documents

are considered properly classified and marked in accordance

with E. 0. 11652, as amended.

b. I recommend that the two documents denied in toto

under the initial review continue to be denied.

One of

them (Tab

3) could identify a still active and sensitive

source.

The other (Tab 4) was obtained

through a sensitive

operation conducted jointly by. American

Dear It. Wilson,

On August 7, 1975, I mede a request to the CIA under the

Freedan on Information Act for Intormation

and doctinents pertaining to

the Africam Research Group and Nancy (San) Farnes. By letter date

April 6, 1976, the agency agmed to release a newspaper clipping

and three censored documents. The remainder of the reguested documerta

were witheld.

I hereby appeal the agency's denial of my request for

documents on the grounds that the exemptions relied upon do not

apply to the requested docurents.

In reviewing whetlier classified Information pertaining the

to tha Africa Rescarch Group 1s Ull properly classified and therefore

exchipted from disclosure under subsection (b) (1) , you should be

ware that the ARG fomally disbanded thee years ano.

In audtion, I have renson to believe that the agency's Initial

Icply 1s incomplete.

In particwar, the documents released ky the agency c

contain only one publication of the NG. Thie docurents already releases

Indicate that the agency was at least aware of other ARO publications.

I hereby request a copy of any catalogue, list or Index of these publications.

As to any documents or portion of documents which are witheld

after this appeal,

I hereby request:

(a) specification as to whether the material pertains to Nancy (Sam)

Barnes

or to the AFrica Research Group

(b) as to material withled on the basis of exemption (b) (5),

names of any other agency which initiated or received coples of

Inter-agency memoranda; and

(c) as to the material witheld on the basis of exemption (b) (7)
