Assassination Records Review Board

Final Determination Notification

AGENCY

: HSCA

RECORD NUMBER

: 180-10068-10352

RECORD SERIES : STAFF PAYROLL RECORDS

AGENCY FILE NUMBER

:

December 8, 1995

Status of Document:

Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 13

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors

including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United

States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 7

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could

reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of

privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

Substitute Language: SSN

Date of Next Review: 2017

Board Review Completed: 10/24/95

Heleased under the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 199.

Dear Mr. Sprague:

When we talked the other week, you asked that I write

to you to state formally my interest in working on the

staff of the House Select Committee on Assassinations,

and to tell

you when I would be ready to go to work.

As I told you during the interview, I am extremely

interested in working as a member of the committee's

staff. I look forward with enthusiasm to such an

opportunity.

and it appears

special master will be essentially over within the next

two weeks.

I have also inquired about living arrangements

in Washington, D.C.

While nothing is definite yet, I

am confident that I can find a room in one of the Jesuit

communities there--most probably at Georgetown University--

within the next two weeks as well. As a result, I can

assure you that I will be ready to go to work in

Washington, D.C., on Monday, December 13, 1976.

One last item--in accordance with your suggestion, I

have been doing some background reading on the scope of

the investigatory powers of Congressional committees.

Thanks again for taking time out of your busy schedule

to see me.

With every best wish, I am

Sincerely yours,

Tom

pounds.
