Action Required:
FYI
1. Transmitted herewith are one copy each for C/WH/COG and COS/WH/
MIAMI of the April 1970 Cuban Official Presence Listing as prepared
by the local, LNERCO Cuban Squad. The under-signed has added on the
201 numbers, indicated CUIS affiliation, added two names, and deleted
one. The departure dates för several CMUN personnel also are noted,
The listing, thus, is valid as of 10 April.
2. According to LNERGO, only two CMUN working wives are officially
Carried on LNERGO records, Maria BERMUDEZ Garela, wife of Jose Raul)
VIERA Linares (201-328953), and Consuelo HORTA Larrinaga, wife f
Pablo DRAKE Capiro (201-815821). BERMUDEZ, because of the impending
departure of the VIERAs on 14 April, can be deleted from the listing.
Additionally, other CMUN wives work or have worked in the past on a
sporadic basis (such as Teresita FERNANDEZ Arango, wife of NGI Center
Chief Orlando PRENDES Gutierrez (201-330002). However, only BERMUDEZ
and HORTA of late have been regular local employees.
3. Addressces will note the preponderance of DGI personnel on
the CMUN roster. Of the 18 (excluding Rolando PEREZ Alfonso) personnel
on board as of 10 April, 12 are DGI. Interestingly enough, 6 non-DGI
personnel is a higher number than has been the rule over the past
several years; at one point there were only 3 non-DGI personnel,
including the Ambassador/Permanent Representative. Of these, 12, two
(DRAKE and CADALSO) are code clerks detailed to the DGI Center from the
DSE. Two others (REYES Goicochea and SANTIAGO) are the "architect"

4. As will be noted, the departure of Jorge REYES Vega (in March)
and the impending departures of VIERA and PINERO will change the
complexion of the DGI Center considerably. If they are not replaced
for one reason or another (per other reporting), the DGI Center
will have but four experienced and competent Case Officers at its
disposal. Of these, PRENDES spends by far the bulk of his time inside
the office pursuing his role of supervisor/manager. RODRIGUEZ is a
handler: GELABERT and SANTANA are mainly concerned with operational
Support tasks -- CELABERT is the Center's best counter-surveillant,
and SANTANA is the technical "expert" of the Center. PEREIRA is a
handler, but his abilities are rather limited in this regard, per
Base and LNERGO information and observations. Should the departees
not be replaced, the Center may be forced de facto into a cutback of
operational activity.
5. We shall watch with interest the behavior patterns of the
DGI Center in the near future, in light of the above and in light of
other recent reporting re the status of the DGI abroad.

1. VICTOR MANUEL GUTIERREZ, HEAD OF THE PARTIDO GUATEMALTE-CO
DEL TRABAJO (PGT/GUATEMALAN COMMUNIST PARTY) AN MEXICO, SAID ON
24 MARCH THAT THE POT IN GUATEMALA REGRETS THE WAY IN WHICH THE
GUERRILLA FIGHT HAS DEVELOPED THERE. ACCORDING TO THE PGT, THE
RESULTS OF THE GUERRILLA FIGHTING HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE
THE 13 NOVEMBER GROUP (MEMBER OF THE 13 NOVEMBER 1960. ATTEMPT TO
OVERTHROW THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT) HEADED BY MARCO ANTONIO
YON SOSA, IS NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLITICAL CONCEPTS OF THE
COMMUNIST STRUGGLE. THE POT ALSO REGRETS THAT THE COMMUNISTS AND
MEMBERS OF THE PARTIDO DE UNIDAD REVOLUCIONARIO (PUR-EXTREME

FORCED TO FIGHT WHEN CONDITIONS WERE NOT ADVANTAGEOUS FOR THEM.
ACCORDING TO THE PGT THE RESULTS WERE DISASTROUS, WITH THE LOSS
OF "MIDDLE RANK COMMUNIST PARTY MEMBERS AND NATIONAL LEADERS."
THE PGT CONSIDERS IT A "MIRACLE" THAT PAZ TEJADA WAS ABLE TO ESCAPE.
HOWEVER, THE PGT STILL BELIEVES THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF MIGUEL
YDIGORAS FUENTES, PRESIDENT. OF GUATEMALA, WILL SOON FALL.
2. THE MAIN HOPE OF THE PGT NOW HINGES ON THE ACTIONS OF THE
GUERRILLA GROUP ORGANIZED AND ARMED IN MEXICO. (FIELD COMMENT:
IT HAS BEEN REPORTED PREVIOUSLY THAT THE 13 NOVEMBER GROUP IN MEXICO
HAD CROSSED THE MEXICAN/GUATEMALAN BORDER SUCCESSFULLY AND HAD
ESTABLISHED A SECOND GUERRILLA FRONT.) THE PGT BELIEVES THAT IT
SHOULD CONCERN ITSELF WITH THE SURVIVAL OF THIS GROUP "EVEN IF THE
POLITICAL CRISIS SHOULD ELIMINATE YDIGORAS". IT BELIEVES THAT THIS
GROUP SHOULD CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN THE MOUNTAINS IN ORDER TO
ESTABLISH AND STABILIZE ANY DEMOCRATIC REGIME.
