Headguarters, U. S. European Command

(U. S. representative)

Deputy Director: Task Force W

chief of stationa souen Africa, 12-12

Retired from Agency

Deputy Chief, Special Operations

Branch (developing paramilitary

capabilities for Agency)

Apparently selected for Task Force W because

of extensive paramilitary background. Not sure

whether slotted by Harvey or Helms.

Prior to his Task Force Wassignment, Harvey

was known to Cheever by reputation only.

He des

cribed Harvey as one of the finest operatives the

Agency ever had, citing

Harvey's Berlin tunnel.

Cheever understood that Task Force W was

Mongoose's instrument to get rid of the Castro

regime; that the Cuban operations had White House

backing; and that the Agency had been given an

operational carte blanche, with the caveat that

each operation had to receive explicit SGA approval

prior to getting off the drawing board.

Cheever told us:

"You don't pull in fast-rising

men like [Ted] Schakley unless you have solid back-

ing."

Cheever

believes that Lansdale was REK's

representative and that Task Force W would not

suggest aggressive covert action to the SGA with-

out Lansdale's approval.

INTERVIEW AND MEETING SUMMARY

TOD

Cheever confirmed what we'knew about Harvey.

Although Cheever worked closely with Harvey, he

told us that Harvey was a loner and most surely

would not inform him of operations unless he had

a "must need to know". In Cheever's opinion,

Harvey was one of the great believers in compart-

mentalization; Cheever "complained that Harvey

turned him into his staff man" (as compared to an

operational extension).

Cheever also told us that

Harvey was a two martini man at lunch with thyroid

problems; this often "led to problems for Harvey

at early afternoon meetings".

Cheever believes he attended at least ten SGA

meetings.

However the does not recall RFK, only

recalls briefing Bundy.

(Maybe Cheever attended

other than SGA meetings - the minutes do not re-

flect his attendance.)

Cheever met weekly with designees of the SGA

principals in Lansdale's office (Messrs. Califano,

Haig, Hurwitch, Craig, and Johnson). Cheever woul

brief these designees

on proposed operational

plans; discussion of the details would ensue.

Subsequent to the staff meetings, the principals

would meet

and decide

not the particular

plan would be approved. Cheever did state that the

Group often rejected proposals.

In one instance,

Max Taylor vetoed the maritime

infiltration of a

small team. Taylor felt that the chances of success

were small and attributability great. (Cheever

agreed with Taylor -- "but it was one of Lansdale's

brain childs.")

Cheever told us that "around the Task Force W

it was known that the Kennedys wanted to get

rid of the Castro regime.

In order to get this

"the Kennedys built a fire under the Agency's

and installed Lansdale as Chief of Operations"

According to Cheever, Lansdale and the SGA were

"geared to keeping the Kennedys informed as to what

was happening".

However, after the Cuban missile crisis, Cuban

operations were not pursued with the same sense of

urgency.
