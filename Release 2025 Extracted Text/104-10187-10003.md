The Rapacki Plan

1.

The Polish proposal for a Central European

nuclear-free zone was introduced at the 2 October 1957

session of the UN General Assembly

by the Polish Foreign

Minister, Adam

rapackl.

Acting as spokesman for the

Polish Government

both east endent derman ate to no the poo

Poland

storage of nuclear weapons on their territories,

Bould

simultaneously introduce an identical ban on

her territory.

Rapacki did not mention Czechoslovakia,

but the head

of the Czechoslovak UN delegation, speaking

after Rapacki, supported his proposal, declaring that his

country would Join the agreement,

extending the

ban over

her

territors,

too.

The East Germans subsequently warols

endorsed the

proposal.

Rapacki's proposal

had obviously been cleared and

coordinated with Soviet leaders prior to its introduction.

Noscow promptly reported the proposal approvingly and the

Soviet press stressed that such an agreement would he wel-

comed by the peoples of Europe,

would facilitate agreement

on disarmament and cessation of nuclear tests, and

"help improve relations and bring closer together" the two

German states.

The proposal was fornalized in a 9 December 1957

government memorandum, which was presented by Rapacki

to the US,

British, and French ambassadors in Yarsaw.

then Soviet Premier,

Bulganin, promptly endorsed the pro-

out the world.

it more palatable to the lestern powers.

eliminated as a part of a general disarmament agreement

for the four-nation area.

The revised version of the

plan also called for "alr and ground control' with NATO

and Warsaw

Pact countries participating in the control

system.

Polish leaders have since 1957 pressed for a formal

agreement on the Rapacki plan.

Shortly alter the opening

of the Geneva disarmament conference in March 1962, the

Polish delegation submitted a memorandum urging creation

of a nuclenr-free zone in Central Europe.

The memorandum

basically follows the lines of the former proposals of the

Rapacki plan.

The Soviet delegation is currently urging

that the Geneva disarmament conference take up the question

of nuclear-free zones in various areas of the world.

6. Since the Rapacki plan

was introduced, it has had

support from Moscow.

The Soviets have

even urged

extending the zone to include Baltic and Balkan countries.

Soviet leaders undoubtedly view the proposal as a means of

elimtnating German power in Central Europe--one of lioscow's

major foreign policy objectives.

The US strongly opposes the Rapacki plan, viewing

it as a Bloc device to

neutralize Germany, to deepen

even perpetuate the division of Germany implementation of the

de facto recognition of East Germany.

such proposals as sinister and subtly intimidatory to the

West Germans, who do not choose to be dealt with as if they

: DIRECTOR-65355, 12 January 1969

1.

As indicated in Reference and other communications, a

training request was made by the Station and approved by Headquarters,

to train a group under the LIENVOY

Project to follow up on leads

produced by the joint LIENVOY operation and presumably other

Mexican Government unilateral sources.

Lee R. MYLECHRAINE, HOMOLD

instructor who was assigned to the Mexico City Station until

8 July 1968,

was selected as the instructor.

MYLECHRAINE arrived

in Mexico City on 9 Janüary 1969:

the training began on 13 January

and ended on

10 February 1969.

The training was conducted at a

training site, Calle Tabasco #228, Colonia Roma, Postal Zone 1,

Mexico City, provided by LIENYOY-2 and LIELEGANT; the building

which the training site apartment is located is owned by LIELEGANT,

and the latter and LIENVOY-2 have their offices there.

upon completion of the training,

will use the apartment in which

the training was conducted for

their offices.

this lead, but even this was of value to the trainees.

One trainee

was required to mako a pretext tolephone call, another team of two

made a noighborhood chock, and the remainder were divided into teams

to check with Transito, the Ministry of Defense, the Social Security

Institute and tho Metropolitan Police. Except for the last team,

all picked up some information of value, and the information and

its

significance in torms of the projected investigation of PEREZ

waS

The performance of the class as a whole was remarkably

good.

S'tho three D'S men, because of their previous training and

experience, were ablo to absorb and understand the lectures and

reading material much

more quickly than the others. None of the

others had any provious training or experience in intelligence or

security work..

However, they were keenly interested, actively

participated in classroom discussions and field exercises, and all

prepared their witten work in an

The instructor

reviewed all written work with them, as woll as plans fur meetings,

etc.,

and this proved most helpful.

Somewhat unusual for Latins,

all

students were punctual; there were some very small and unimpor-

tant dolays, but for the most part these were due to the exceedingly

difficult traffic situation

in Mexico City or to other roasons

apparently beyond

their control.

No student was absent from classes

during

the entire training period, and no student was Inte for

more than 45 minutes or an hour.

6.

In summary; the instructor and the Station feel that the

training objoctive

was

accomplished, and that, the triinees,

although

not yot experlenced

operators; have a sufficient enough understanding

of the bisic

tradecraft principles and techniques to permit them to

begin operations.

They are all intelligent

concerned about the possibility of flaps and corpromises.

He gets

and undoubtedly has real

Icadership qualities.

TREJO is somewhat talkative,

opinionated and

argumentative, and may have trouble supervising others, but he,

too,

demonstrated considerablo imagination and icsourcefulness.

GARZA, the youngest of thu Army group, appeared to be the most pro-

American, is vory

imaginative, and possesses considerable drive and

energy.

On

one occasion he had the instructor out to lunch at his

home,

where he lives with his wife (they have no children).

GARZA, It 15 bolieved,

The instructor has prepared

his

observations and opinions,

as well as any information he was

8. MYLECHRAINE used the name

"Sr. Tomas" with the trainees;

they did not learn his true name, nor were they

aware where he was living in Mexico City.

Likewise, they are not

aware that he has served previously in Mexico.

There were no

incidents involving security during the training period, and no

incidents or events that should be reported.
