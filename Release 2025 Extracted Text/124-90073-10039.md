MM 92-1047

MM To1 advised in August, 1967, that DAVID YARAS

maintains a good deal of control over the activities of

certain Miami and Miami Beach bookmakers and gamblers as

part of the over-all plan to integrate the Miami area

bookmakers into the Chicago organization. A certain amount

of the action received by YARAS is turned over to PASQUALE

ERRA, described by the informant as being the strongest

Ia Cosa Nostra (ICN) figure in Miami. The informant states.

that YARAS' main interests, however, lie in Chicago,

where

he continues to maintain bookmaking, shylocking and "scam"

businesses.

ALFRED MARI, also known as ALFIE MART, reSides

at 1211 100th Street,

Bay Harbor Island. He was inter

viewed at 1245-Michigan Avenue, MART volunteered the

following information:

He stated that he first came to Miami Beach,

Florida, in 1946 after his discharge from the U. S. Army.

MART first started to work as a clerk in a horse room and

shortly thereafter was given his own horse room.

According

tO MART, all bookmaking and gambling was controlled by the

§ & G Syndicate. He reflected that before the influence of

the nob, everyone connected with the syndicate was trust-

worthy and honest.

MART indicated that for a short period of time

during 1964, he was associated as

a part-owner in the Derby

Sports Book

Located in Las Vegas, Nevada. One of his

partners: in this legal bookmaking operation was GEORGE ABDO

who is now deceased. In order to financially back this

book, MART stated that he mortgaged his home and also se-

cured a personal loan in New York City. He said that during

the first six months of 1964, he spent most of his time in

Las Vegas in'order to secure

his interests at the business.

In his opinion, he was swirdled in the operation and finan-

cial backing of this bookmaking establishment and further

contends that there are several falsehoods in the indictment

presently pending against him in the district court in

• Las Vegas, Nevada.

MART stated that during the past several years,

he has operated Alfie's Sundries which is located at 1664

Alton Road, Miami Beach, Florida.

He also admits that

during the

past years he has conducted a small intrastate

bookmaking operation. Most of the business is conducted

by a paid clerk who has operated either at the sundries

score or in another location. He reflected that due to his

money interests, he does not manage the day to day operation

of his bookmaking business although he is the financial

backer of same.

MARI stated that sometime during the spring of

1963,

a line service came to the Miami area under the name

of Multiple Sports News Service (MSNS). This outfit was

headed by FRANK "LEFTY"' ROSENTHAL. He was assisted in

this venture by STANLEY GREEN, who acted as a clerk and

pick-up man

He indicated that MSNS disseminated line

information on collegiate and professional football, pro-

fessional baseball and collegiate and professional basket-

ball. In addition, they would supply player information and

up-to date scores.

The latter was possible in view of a

Western Union sports sticker which was installed in the

offices of MSNS. MART stated that he was assigned a code

number in which he or his clerk could use in obtaining

average price he paid per week.

MART said that in addition to the line service,

MSNS also published a weekly sports journal. This joural

was put out on a weekly basis and consisted of the schedule

for the coming week of sports activity whether it be foot-

ball, baseball or basketball. As a service to MSNS, Alfies

Sundries would sell the sheets on their stand for 35 cents

although they paid 23 cents a copy from the publisher.

Normally they would get 70 to 100 sheets a week for local

dissemination.

In MART's opinion, MSNS did have mob or syndicate

backing at the time they started in 1963. He indicated that

• 4c

## Page 23

•... MM 92-1047

no force was used in obtaining subscribers to their service

but the word was out among the bookmaking fratemity that

it was the thing to do. He feels that during the past year

MSNS has lost their affiliation with the syndicate and

now

is operating independent of any organized authority.

MART said that during the current 1967 major

league baseball season, he paid $50 a week for the line

service.

Normally the $50 would be paid in cash by one of

his employees working at Alfies Sundries to STANLEY GREEN.

GREEN's normal pick-up day was either Monday or Tuesday.

MART said that the baseball line during the current

season was norwally disseminated the first time around 11:30

a.mo to noon.

ming the week of May to, 196e the tine

was coming out around 1 P.m.

MARI" stated that

he personally

complained to GREEN about this late dissemination and GREEN

told him that the delay was necessary in view of the fact

that there were fewer customers taking the service. MART

MSNS

over the weekend for their line information.

On May 23 or May 24, 1967, STANLEY GREEN came to

Alfies Sundries and demanded all the weekly sports journals

that were in the rack. GREEN indicated that MSNS was going

out of business as to both the dissemination of the line

and the publication of their sports joumals.

Several days after GREEN's visit to Alfies Sun-

dries, FRANK ROSENTHAL Came into the sundries and spoke

personally with MART. In their conversation, MART told

ROSENTHAL that he did not think it

was right

for MSNS to

all of a sudden pull out their publications or in fact

stop disseminating the line.

MART also told ROSENTHAL that

he was due a refund for services that had not been rendered.

ROSENTHAL seemingly agreed and said he would consult SIANLEY

GREEN as to the amount of the refund.

MART stated that during the late evening hours

of May 31, 196%, an explosion occurred at the back end of

the American Epicure Market which is situated next door

to Alfies Sundries. He stated that he was in the area

at the time of the explosion and had seen no one in the

area whom he considered a suspect.

He did receive some

information shortly after the explosion that one of the

employees of the market considered himself to be an expert

in the field of demolition. He was also aware of the fact

that ED THAL, had fired on May 29, 1967, a Negro employee

who was very irate at THAL for this action.

MART stated that his bookmaking operation con

tinued after the first bombing at the American Epicure

Market.

He further related that after MSNS had with

drawn their sheets from Alfies Sundries, he started to

print his own schedules. The first sheet was a xeroxed

copy of that put out by MSNS although he deleted the name

of this service from the publication. He said that the

first sheet was printed in a volume of 70 sheets. He

stated that ROSENTHAI came into the store after his sheet

came on the market, and he told him what he had done.

MARI said that he told ROSENTHAL that he was

sure that his

small publication of sheets would not in any way hinder

the business of MSNS. MART stated

the next two publica-

tions were similar in format to the sheet put out in Fort

Worth, Texas.

At the time of his first interest in pub

lishing a sheet, he contacted ANGEL-KAPLAN for five of their

sheets although his money was returned with a note in-

dicating the impossibility of shipping sheets to the Miami,

Florida area®

MART stated

that on June 16, 1967, a severe ex-

plosion took place in Alfies Sundries.

The

main blast

from the explosion occurred in the area of the telephone

booths on the south side of the store.

He indicated that

he was not at the store at the

time of the explosion al-

though he appeared on the scene shortly after the occurrence.

MM 92-1047

MART

said it was obvious at this time that the previous

bombing at the American Epicure Market was a mistake and

was really meant for Alfies Sundries.

MARI stated that he considers the prime suspect

in the two bombings to be FRANK ROSENTHAL. He character-

ized this individual as a man with an uncontrollable temper

and further, an individual that was very unpredictable and

at times, irrational in his behavior. He reflected that

ROSENTHAL might have thought he was putting out either a

line of his

own or in fact disseminating to potential

customers of MSNS the line that had been given him.

According to MART, If the latter were true, MSNS would of

course lose a sizeable amount of money per week.. He em-

phatically denied that he was either putting out a line or

giving the line put out by MSNS to othertbookmakers whether

It be in the Miami, Florida area or out of state.

MART readily admitted friendship with one MICKEY

ZION and stated that it was common knowledge that ZION was

a prominent bookmaking figure in the Miami, Florida area.

He said that he was personally aware of the fact that ZION

and FRANK ROSENTHAL have had many arguments over the opera

tion of MSNS.

These arguments would stem from accusations

by ZION that ROSENIHAL was in fact putting out a false line

and also to the fact that ZION was being charged too much

money for the service rendered by MSNS.

He said that

during the fall and winter 1966-1967, ZION was paying $150

A short time ago ZION was requested

to pay $200 a week by ROSENTHAL for service. ZION re-

fused to pay this amount of money. He further related that

on one occasion ZION approached him to work out a deal for

both of them obtaining line service from MSNS under one

account number. MART refused to enter into such an agree-

ment with ZION.

MART said that between the time of the first

bombing and before the second bombing, ROSENTHAL called

Alfies Sundries on several occasions late at night while

he was in the store. He said ROSENTHAL attempted to dis-

guise his voice although it was apparent to him that it

WaS ROSENTHAL. ROSENTHAL on these occasions stated that

he was desirous of obtaining certain baseball scores and

was told by MICKEY ZION to call this number for results.

MART politely told ROSENTHAL that he did not have the

results desired but possibly he could call back in several

hours for the information.

"It was MART's opinion that

these calls were aimed at attempts to establish a working

relationship between ZION and himself by ROSENTHAL.

In conclusion, MART stated that he was sure that

if MIKE COPPOLA was alive there would have been no violence

in the area. He related that COPPOLA had silent but firm

control over gambling matters, and he did not believe in

rough stuff. It was MART's opinion that a new young group

of individuals are attemting a takeover in the area and

are resorting to any means available to prove their posi-

tion. He indicated that FRANK ROSENTHAL, DAVE YARAS aId

BENNY HUSICK would certainly fall under the category he

had just mentioned.
