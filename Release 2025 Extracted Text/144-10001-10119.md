Routine

During our talks, McCLOY, on his own initiative, brought up the subject

of criticism of the European

press, especially the French, of the activity

Of WARREN's commission.

In a lengthy monologue he condemned accusations that the commission

intends, in the name of public interest, to gloss over the evidence of the

assassination and with its authority support the conclusions reached by

the FBI.

He wants to assure us that he will not permit any distortion or conceal-

ment of the facts; however, from materials at his disposal, he is more and

more convinced that OSWALD committed the crime by himself.

I acknowledged

his information with the statement that interest in the commission's report

is great everywhere because of the shock of KENNEDY's assassination and of

the world position of the USA.

McCLOY's statements confirm the opinion circulating here that the

commission is mainly interested in proving that the assassination was not

linked with any foreign centers. At the same time, public statements made

by MARK LANE, hired by OSWAlD's mother to defend her son before the commis-

sion, must be treated very carefully even in our press. Our friends consider

him an unscrupulous politician interested only in his career. He is

financed by groups which lean toward the Chinese viewpoint.
