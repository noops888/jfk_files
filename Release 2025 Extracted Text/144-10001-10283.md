UNITED STATES REPORTED WILLING TO FORGET CAMBODIAN INCIDENT

TO Phnom Penh: [M]

Msg NI: 1/ DGP/X

I was received this morning, Friday 3 January at 1100 hours

by Philippine Foreign Minister LOPEZ. He told me that America

is ready to forget entirely the incident with Cambodia since

Cambodia has already denied having manifested any rejoicing over

the death of [President] KENNEDY. President MACAPAGAL had

an interview yesterday with Mr. LOPEZ and American Ambassador

STEVENSON. The Philippine [Government] thinks that Cambodia

and America will be willing to forget any past incident and

so will accept the formula of a joint statement.

President MACAPAGAL and Mr. LOPEZ wish sincerely to

receive a trusted representative of His Royal Highness in an

interview in Manila. But if, on the contrary, His Royal

Highness wishes for President MACAPAGAL to send a Philippine

representative to Phnom Penh, the President will conform with

the desire of His Royal Highness. Meanwhile, the Philippine

Foreign Minister is ordering Ambassador FAROLAN to return from

Saigon. Unfortunately FAROLAN's son just died in an accident

in Hong Kong.
