NOTE OF CONDOLENCE ON DEATH OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY

[TELEX CONVERSATION BETWEEN: ]

Santiago: Foreign Minister ORTUZAR

22 Nov 63

Washington: Ambassador GUTIERREZ OLIVOS

Msg Nr: 423

[wol In the first place, I would like to receive the instructions

requested in my telex of 1500 hours. Then, according to

what you say, permit me to make some suggestions regarding

the statement which

the President of the Republic will

surely make.

[s.]

Chilean

First, let me say that as soon as we learned the tragic news,

the

President of the Republic, accompanied by the Foreign

Minister and the Minister of the Interior, visited the

United States Ambassador to express the grief and sorrow

of the government and people of Chile. The President has

sent a cablegram to Mrs. KENNEDY and to the new President

of the United States, expressing his condolences. Also,

the Foreign Minister

has sent a similar cablegram to the

Secretary of State.

National mourning has been decreed

for three days. The President has already made a statement

which in a few moments will be given to the press and which

I shall send to you. Likewise, the Foreign Minister will

make a statement. As far as instructions, while they are

being prepared, it seems necessary and indispensable that

you proceed to

express to the United States Government the

condolences of our government and our people, in the fol®

lowing manner: Real consternation reigns here, because

President KENNEDY was loved and admired by the people of

Chile, who knew that he always understood our problems.

The text of the President's statement reads as follows:

"In the face of the unexpected and tragic news of the •

death of the President of the United States of America,

also

speaks for the sentiments of all Chileans.

"President KENNEDY gave the world a new corcept of peace,

of justice, of liberty and of democracy. His idealistic

and constructive concepts were, in the field of action,

becoming realities which have come to signify for the

people the hope of a more just and more free tomorrow.

"His tragic death is not only mourned by the sister

republic of the United States of America. It is the

whole world, which in these hours feels the sorrow of

an irreparable loss. Chile shares, fully, this grief

because she found in him profound comprehension of her

problems and a spirit always determined to help us.

"Santiago, 22 November 1963."

Please make the suggestions you feel

advisable as you

announced above.

Because of the present situation in Washington and the

prevalent atmosphere in Congress in respect to the

foreign aid program, particularly in respect to the

Alliance for Frogress, to which I have referred at length

in previous cablegrams and notes, I think that the tragic

death of President KENNEDY should not pass without very

explicit reference to said program, of which he was the

creator and the most ardent defender, even to the point

that there were times when the maintenance of the

Alliance in American circles was entrusted almost exo

clusively to the personal battle that he maintained on

all opposing fronts. For this reason, I am suggesting,

knowing that it would be very well received in circles

of the Administration of the United States, that in

President ALESSANDRI's statement a very special refo

erence be made to the President as author and struggling

defender of the Alliance, pointing out the urgent neces-

sity for the United States and all the Latin American

peoples to make of the Alliance, that is of its realities,

a "living monument" to the life

and concepts of this great

man.

This is my suggestion.

At this moment, we are seeing whether or not the President's

statement has already been released to the press, in order

to be able to make an addition.

The statement has already been released to the press as we

have transcribed it to you. However, we will make use of

any further declaration to take your suggestion into

account.

The declaration that will be reproduced by all the news-

papers of the [XG] since probably later declarations will

be confused under the deluge of important reactions from

many sources. I ask, finally, if it would still not be

possible to send the newspapers an additional paragraph to

erence

to the texts sent to the wire services.

Unfortunately, the statement previously mentioned has already

been transmitted by radio; therefore, it is impossible to

make any changes.
