As indicated, PACHANKIS broke the bad news

contained in Reference B on AMMUG-l's citizenship.

AMMUG-1 apparently. took the news

as tell as could

be expected.

Nevertheless, the Station would appreciate

periodic notice on the status of AMMUG-l's case so

we may keep hin informed on any progress.

In regard to Reference C, PACHANKIS probed in

area of "ife problems and never really resolved

PACHANKIS seemed to think, however,

d. During the siddle and late 1950s, Roberto

had been a salesnan for the Burroughs flour company

and had stayed clear of the poiltical picture in Ciba.

=.

During the sane period, Hector had been a

student in the University of lavana,

under Raul ROs,

and had taken part in some ravolutionary activitles.

le had been arrested and beaten by the Batista polico

for his anti-governaent actions and his father had

sent hia into exile in the us.

When

Castro came into pover,

the father vas

a potential "var crininal" for hig illicit dealings.

AMMUG-], DhO 8aS

In tho police force in the initial

stages of the revolution,.

states that he deleted an

incriminating page fron

the father's dossier (showing

he paid off the police to run his bolita operation)

and thus saved hia fron prosecution.

AMMUG-l continued to be close to the family,

especially

vith

Roberto,

"Thon I gav every day and

ran around vith."

Roberto nover entertained the

revolution.

As late as 1962-63, "He used to talk

quite openly and frankly.

He was always against the

revolution and

the communists.

Ile worked in the

Ministry of Industry because his brother got hia the

job,

but he had only one

1dea in his head:

to get out

of Cuba and come lo the Us.

He was even plotting to

get out by boat.

He had a US visa for many years and

had visited here pany tines."

When AlBNG-1 defecied, he lost contact with

ago a neighbor fron

'siant on the Freedon Flights. (COMMENT:

This undoubtedly referg to Cuban refuges Segundo

Reference forwarded the AMOT

debriefing of CASCUDO on Roberto.)

When AMNUG-1

the neighbor said that he under-

stood that Robarto,

about Roberto, gas assigned in a forelgn

Embassy. "

The refugee could not say what country

This news

proupts AlMUG-1 to comment:

"This

would be a most interesting person to talk

to.

he found he could no longer submit to having

his thoughts

deprived him of liberty and self respect nor continue to

support the cuban

Government or be a part of its intelligence

activities; he therefore planned to defect as soon as

opportunity arose.

After deciding to leave Cuba permanently,

he began a systematic collection of documents at the General

Directorate of Intelligence Headquarters.

He brought these

documents with him to the United States as proof of Fidel

CASTRO's subversive activities in Latin America.

DETAILED JUSTIFICATION AND ASSESSHENT

1.

Agency

Vladimir RODRIGUEZ Lalera has cooperated with this

since his defection on 21 April 1964

at which time he

turned over to CIA documents from the Gencral Directorate of

Intelligence he had collected during the preceeding several

months.

In addition, he has provided voluminous, accurate

and valuable information on

the organization of the Cuban

intelligence services, their operations,

staff members and

agents.

These documents and information have given us the

potential and opportunity to

take effective measures to

safeguard United States Government interosts.

Subject has

been of gicat value in the past, and will continue

to bo in

the future,

in the CIA recruitment/dercetion program.

His

wide acquaintance

among and knowledge concerning high level

Cuban diplomats

and Cuban intelligence personnel provides

the Agency with the necessary background in planning operations

against them and

makes Subject ideal

for use in carrying out

the operations.

His talents

and contacts can be used not only

in lurthering

the detector

program,

but in other types of

political action and

psychological warfare operations.

As a result of technical interrogations of RODRIGUEZ

on 11 May 1964 and again on 15 July 1966, his hona tides have

been established not only for intelligence exploitation

purposes but also for the purpose of resettlement in the

United States.

There is no reason to believe that RODRIGUEZ
