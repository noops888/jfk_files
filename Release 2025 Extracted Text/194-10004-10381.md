733 Third Avenue, New York,

New York 10017, who resides at 47-19 216th

Street, Bayside, New York 11361, a former supervisor of Manuel MARTI,

was interviewed

at his place of

employment concerning SUBJECT. Ferraro

stated substantially as follows:

Source first met SUBJECT on 5 April 1965 when MARTI started to

work under Source's supervision at MIAA, and he had daily business contact

with SUBJECT until MARTI left MIAA to enter the United States Army on or

about 20 May 1968.

Source had no social contact with SUBJECT during the

period of association.

MARTI was originally employed as a Utility Clerk

in Source's department, and because of HIS keen intelligence and willing-

ness to resume responsibility the position of Utility Clerk Supervisor was

created for HIM.

HE was subsequently trained within the section and

promoted to Tabulating Machine Operator, the position which HE held at the

time of HIS departure.

SUBJECT was well liked and respected by HIS co-

workers, and Source considered HIM to be the best employee in his section.

would be happy to have SUBJECT return to work under his supervision.

SUBJECT is of Puerto Rican decent, and was single and resided

with HIS parents in Bronx, New York, exact address unknown. SUBJECT'S

mother was ailing for some time after HIS employment at MIAA and she died

on or about 9 January 1967. SUBJECT has a younger sister, name unknown,..

and a brother, name unknown, who is also in the United States military

service. While at MIAA SUBJECT was given a deferment by HIS draft board because

HIS brother was in the military service and HE was the sole support of HIS

parents. SUBJECT is a high school graduate, and is believed to have attended

college at night, further details unknown.

Source had no knowledge concerning

SUBJECT'S employment prior to MIAA.

39

MARTI is a dependable, industrious, cooperative, and aggressive

individual who exercises considerable initiative in HIS work.

HIS moral

character and discretion are above reproach, and HE manifested no undesir-

able personal habits during the period of association. SUBJECT is honest,

trustworthy, mature and emotionally stable, and HE has had no known difficulty

with creditors or law enforcement agencies.

Source had no knowledge concern-

ing the degree of influence exercised over SUBJECT by HIS father.

firmly believes in the principles of a free democratic society, and Source

considers HIM loyal to the United States.
