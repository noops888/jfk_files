Interview: Robert Genzman and Harold Leap interviewed Dennis Flynn

at his home on June 16, 1978. The interview yielded the following

information.

Flynn worked for the FBI from 1934 to 1946, and for

the Department of State from 1947 to 1967. From 1953 to 1956 he

was Director of Security at the State Department.

Flynn recalls the following procedures for State De-

partment cover for CIA employees. The State Department's Personnel

Office would request clearances from the Security Office. The

Security

Office would contact the CIA liaison

officer, who would

certify clearance. The Security Office would then grant clearance.

A record of CIA certification of clearance would probably be placed

in the individual's State Department security file.

Flynn believed that the State Department at no time

kept a listing of CIA employees under State Department cover..

He

said that the Security Officer and the head of the Bureau of Intel-

ligence Research generally knew about these cover arrangements.

Flynn stated that at no time from 1959 to 1963 did the

CIA use consular cover.

Flynn said that he remembers the CIA

officers who had State Department cover in Moscow during this

period.

He is sure that Richard E. Snyder and Jack F. Matlock

were not CIA employees, and he is fairly certain that John A.

McVickar, Joseph Norbury, and Alexis Davison were not CIA em-

ployees.
