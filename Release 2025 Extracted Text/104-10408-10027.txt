RELATED MISSION DIRECTIVE FOR MEXICO
1. GENERAL PROVISIONS
A. National Policy. The long-range national policy objec-
tives of the U.S. Government toward Mexico are to reduce
to an ineffectual level the influence of international
Communiam, to encourage democratic government, and to
keep the Mexican government friendly and favorably in-
clined toward U. 8. policies. Purther guidance is given
in the current OCB Regional Operations Plan for Latin
America.
B. Operational Emphasis. The Station's primary emphasis
will continue to be placed on clandestine Jcollection 24
24 Operations and covert action operations against the
Sino-Soviet bloc, Cuban, and Communist elements in Mexico.
C. Changes in the RMD. This basic policy instruction for
activities in Mexico has been revised in light of the
Station's last Annual Assessment of Progress Report and
to reflect more accurately operational conditions, capa-
bilities and direction. In view of the importance and
threat presented by Communist Cuba to U. S. interests in
Latin America, coverage of Cuban revolutionary activities
in Mexico has been made a specific requirement under
Priority A. Priority B objectives and tasks include
refinements of desired efforts and also provide for overt
action operations against Cuban targets in Mexico. The
former task for production of motion pitures and their
distribution has been deleted, as it is no longer a valid
requirement; two former tasks pertaining to the possible
use of foreign diplomats have been combined, a task to
develop young potential political leaders (ZREAGER) has
been added. Two previous Priority C objectives have been
eliminated, as there is no established Mexican intelli-,29
gence service, and the Station regularly reports on
activities of the security services, 24Coverage of Chinese
Communists has been raised to Priority B coincident with
the elimination of the former Pricrity C section.
D. Contingency Reporting. In addition to the specific
objectives set forth in Section II, the Station will from
time to time be called on to attempt to satisfy Intelligence
TRY
13-00000
Guides and Intelligence Directives, but it is expected
that these requirements be satisfied attilaing existing
assets. of particular interest on a continuing basis
is information on: (a) any indications that Mexico may
be used as a base for clandestine activity directed
against the U. 8. (CI Book Messages 88 and 115); (১)
activities of non-bloc intelligence services, especially
those that are potentially harmful to U. 3. interests;
(o) the plotting of revolutionary groups according to
their current importance in attempts to overthrow the
regines of their respective Latin American countries;
(d) the current alignment and activities of political 24
forces with the potential for assuming control of the
Mexican Government; (e) U. S. Communists residing in
Mexico; and (f) the Spanish Communist group.
०५
It will be noted that certain previous contingency
reporting requirements have been, amended as follows:
The former levy for reporting on the stability of the
Mexican Government has been changed to a more realistic
and meaningful statement as reflected by (d) above.
This modification is appropriate, as political changes
in Mexico are most likely to occur within the framework
of constitutionality. The previous charge for reporting
on secret shipments of strategic materials from Mexico 24
to bloe countries is no longer specifically required and
has been deleted.
