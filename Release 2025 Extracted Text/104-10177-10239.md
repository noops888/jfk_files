attention of DEA either as potential informants or as

liaison contacts: According to preliminary checks

conducted by DEA, there were indication's that these

individuals had past records of "political and revolú-

tionary intrigue."

DEA, concerned that it may be the

target of a provocation operation by another govern-

ment, requested this Agency's assessment of the

It is believed that GARCIA's

earlier service to Accion Democratica (AD) exiles in

Costa Rica,

where he revortedly eliminated several

Manuel De ARMAS. DPOB:

06 November 1947;

Havana, Cuba, naturalized U.S. citizen living in Miami.

On 17 October 1975 one Manuel De ARMAS contacted our

overt Domestic Contact Division

(DCD) office in Miami

offering his services as a doubic agent.

Following are

excerpts from two DCD Reports dated 20 October 1975 and

19 january 1976 based on debriefings of De ARIAS: While

in Cuba De ARVAS claimed to have been the neighbor of.

Raul BETANCOURT, the brother of the former Venczuelan

President Romulo

BETANCCURT, and his two daughters:

Antonieta and Mariela, who was De ARMAS' girl friend:

De ARMAS' mother decided in 1962 that Subject should

leave Cuba, which he did.

In 1975, De ARMAS found out

that his two joung cousins had been placed in an orphan-

age in Cuba.

He made contact with Mariela BETANCOURT,

telling her

that he was fed

un with the U.S. system of

government in order to gain her attention on the matter

of taking his cousins out of Cuba.

Mariela asked him

if he would be willing to work for the Cuban Government

and he replied he rould if it would help the youngsters.

Mariela then told De ARMAS to go to Caracas and meet

with her sister Antonieta.

De ARMAS went to Caracas on

02 October 1975 and met with Antonieta,

but no proposals

were made on the possibility of his working for the

Cuban Government.

On 17 October 1975 De ARMAS again

called Mariela and was told that he should return to

Venezuela to hold more talks with Antonieta and

"other

people." After talking with Mariela on 17 October 1975,

Three of the five aforementioned individuals

and SUMENEZ-Rojo were both

former members of the UIR

in Cuba

at one time and MORALES Navarette, a former

Although there have been

them

of being Cuban
