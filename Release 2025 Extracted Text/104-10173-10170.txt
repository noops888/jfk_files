Subject is Max LESNICK y Menendez, non-immigrant visa applicant born 8
September 1930 in Vueltas, Las Villas, Cuba. Profession, salesman.
President of Juventud Ortodoxa and Orthodoxo party leader in opposition
to BATISTA. He is currently in hiding from police until the heat is
off. In 1954, he signed the Comite Cubano declaration in favor of
Guatemala. He was referred to as a Communist sympathizer through
collaboration between Ortodoxos and Communists and friendship well-
known Cuban Communists possibly embracing Section 212 (a) (27) and (28).
Security checks show no indications of collaboration with Communists.
Latter at times tried to get on the bandwagon of all opposition groups
including the Ortodoxo. Specific information from. Cuban Government
sources regarding Ortodoxo-Communist pacts were later, admitted to the
local CAS as fabrications. LESNICK states that he signed the Pro-
Guateriala declaration against big foreign business domination of Latin
American affairs as did many other Cubans. He states that he is only
acquainted with student Communist leaders at the University of Habana.
He denies that he collaborated with the Communists during the past or
present and brings published articles dating back to 1950 which indicate
his anti-Communist stand. His name appears in the Soundex for
questioning.
The local CAS is especially interested in the case. A favorable
decision is recommended by the visa officers.
LESNICK plans attend Inter-American Press Association meeting to be
held 12 October in Washington, entering New York 12 October at 1:35
p.m. via Cubana airline.
