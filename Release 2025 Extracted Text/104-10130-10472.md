MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

SUBJECT: The Wackenhut Corporation

3280 Ponce de Leon Boulevard

Coral Gables, Florida

1. Mr. Bannerman, Security Office, arranged through Chief,

cos for the writer to meet Mr. George, jackenhut, President of

subject, to explore its potential for cover support. At 10:30

a.I., on 14 Narch 1953, Mr. Wackenhut, Mr. Wes Reysolds, and I

met at lix. Reynold's home, 3809 37th Street, North, Arlington.

•ut. Reynolds apparently represents Wackenhut in the Washington

ares, although I did not gather that the firm is actually

operating here at present. Mr. Wackenbut and Mr. Reynolds, both,

are ex-fBI agents.

2. Wackenhut started his firm in 1954. In 1961 1t was

reported to have 1100 employees and anticipated 1961 sales 1n

excess of $5 million. At present 1t has offices In Miami,

sorel Gables, tamps, dacksonville, Philadelphia, lew fork tity,

BOStOs, inffalo, Denver, los Angeles, Sen Jose (Cal1f.), Honolulu,

San Juan and Ponce, Puerto Rico. Wackenhut freely states that

he trades on the reputation of the fil by publlelzing widely the

21 ex-FBI agents, Including two former Assistant Directors of the

FBI, In his management.

3. The Operating Divisions of the company and their services

are described In & Wackenhut brochure as follows:

Investigative Division.

Performs all types of Investigations for attorneys, Insurance

companies, banks and other businesses; sets up internel audit

systems to prevent embezzlements, and Investigates personel back-

grounds of prospective executives, business partners and associates.

fic lie detector examinations for business and Industry; speciel

Internal Intelligence Division

Specializes In exposing and controlling inside thefts that may

range from emuloyee pilferage, through embezzlement of thousands of

dollars, to highly valuable industrial secrets.

Central ClearIng Division

he backgrounds of present end potential employees through th

essive files of The Wackenhut "orporation

ne control of internal end external Losses with security programe

esigned to meet the client's specific needs.

Training Services Division

righting, investigative and other personnel of business organiza-

tlons and professional groups.

Industrial Security Division

Provides the essential security services that are required by

all companies seelong or handling goverment classified contracts;

assists management in disaster and emergency planning.

Fire and Safety Division

supplies ambulence services, first ald crevs, lackenbut fire-

men sully trained in the technical fleld of Industrial and mmi-

cipal fire fighting and equipment, and safety surveys, systems,

and eduestional programs.

Guard Forces Division

selects, investigates, traing and supervises the uniformed

and plain clothes guards who protect your operations; also provides

uniformed receptionists and guardettes; makes physical property

surveys to determine security requirements and establishes security

systems and controls.

4. Ms. Wackenhut wants to expand abroad, in view of his

successiul venture into ruerto Rico. iowever, he has no deiinite

plans as of the present and seemed to be seeking from CIA covert 2?

sponsorship for entry Into areas of interest to us. He is pre-

pared to furnish personnel himself or to permit integration of 24

Agency nominees.

5. It 1s not epparent to me that there 1s any significant

market for Wackenhut's services In foreign countries, except

possibly among American businesses with physical plants overseas.

the nature of these services, I vould presume, would make rather

a1ff1cult acquisition of the necessary occupational pernits 1n

many countries.. The potential for clandestine intelligence acti;

vitles would be too obvious to bost goveraments, and the emphases

particularly In Latin Anerica where

since its Wl II activitles there.

6. CCS/IC on occasion receives requests for advice to bust-

ness ortenizations as to setting up security systems at overseas

Installations.

We recently referred a request of this type,

Involving a major oil company, to the Physical Security element of

the Security Office.

Conceivably, the Agency might make some

arrangement to advise wactenhut of such requests, providing que own

Security Office 1s satisfied es to Heckenhut's competence. We 24

could then place an Agency represestative, 1f desired, En the tean2y

aispatched overseas by Wackenhit sbould his compeny successfully

secure the contract.

T. Wackenhut said be would be willing to dispatch teams to

set up personal security systems for foreign chiefs of state

won the Ageney wants protected. He 1s amenable, in fact, to any

reasonable application of his capabilities to Agency problems.

He would be willing to negotiate financing in equitable propor-

tions in the event an overt operation, set up at Agency bebest,

were not financially self-susteining.

8. Hackenhut impressed me as & clean-cut, energetie, ambitious

young business man who 1s obviously proud of what appears to be

a superior organization of 1ts type. He 18 Interestin profits,

but 1t 1s my impression he is sincerely eager to do what he can to

assist the government and feels that CIA offers one possible oppor-

-tunfty. Incidentally, he eppears somewhat younger in person then

In the pictures appearing in the promotional material given the

writer.

9. Copies of this menorandun are being furnished those Agency

components which night have an interest in utilizing subject con-

pany. Inguiries may be directed to the uriter.
