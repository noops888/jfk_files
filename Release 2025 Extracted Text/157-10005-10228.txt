I was told that somewhere within the overall political
and psychological staff there was located a man with a small
office.
This man's name was Pash, Colonel Boris Pash, and
my understanding was that Colonel Pash had been doing business,
let us say, with the Agency in West Germany for quite a while.
I sought out Colonel Pash. I was directed to his office
and found sitting with him another Agency officer named Artie
Lazarus I'm not sure whether it is Arthur, Lazarus.
Mr. Baron. It's a Greek name. Aristides is his correct
first name, but he goes by Atilo.
Mr. Hunt. Very good. But in any case, he was known
throughout my career as stie Lazarus. And I was at that
point on, let's say, a search mission to determine whether the
alleged capability of Colonel Pash in wet affairs, which is
how it was referred to, that is liquidations, would have any
relevance to our particular problem of the Albanian dis-
appointments.
Mr. Baron. By liquidations, you mean assassinations?
Mr. Hunt. Assassinations. Assassinations, kidnappings,
removals, let's say.
This had been alleged to me. So I spoke to Colonel Pash
in Mr.Lazaruses presence. I explained the problem to him,
although at that juncture I'm quite sure that we had not
identified the Albanian suspect. So we were talking hypothetically

was a rather jesting one, and the impression I gained was
here were a couple of men who were drawing salaries and doing
very little.
And so when Colonel Pash seemed reluctant to become
involved in responding affirmatively to my questions, my
inference was that Colonel Pash and Lazarus could well not
have such a capability but for purposes of employment and
status, this was the job they had. But they didn't want
anyone to call upon them to activate their particular
abilities.
Now that was my impression, and I was a little disgusted
by it. I think I talked to the Chief of the PP staff later,
who was of course well aware of the Albanian problem and I
said I didn't get any satisfaction from Pash, but it doesn't
really make any difference because we don't have the name
of the suspected individual.

21
Mr. Baron. Just to stop here for a second and clear up
some of these details, were you under the impression that what
you called wet affairs, assassinations, kidnappings, or other
removals from the scene of troublesome individuals was the
22
23
primary function of this unit that Pash and Lazarus were
running?
24
Mr. Hunt. Yes.
In fact the only. As far as I knew, they

years until I began reading a book called "Lawrence and Oppen-

had known previously that he had been associated during the
war with the Manhattan Project and that he had a security
background. And as I believe I touched on briefly before, it
11
WARD & PAUL
12
13
14
was my impression that Pash had been active a couple of years
at least before I knew him in West Germany with the sort of
thing that we had been discussing so far today.
15
Mr. Baron. What kinds of stories had you heard about
Pash's previous activities?
16
Mr. Hunt.
Kidnappings mostly.
17
Mr. Baron.
And where were those?
18

Mr. Hunt.
West Germany and West Berlin.

Mr. Baron.
Do you know the names of any of the victims
20
of the kidnapping or any of the people involved other than
21
Pash and Lazarus?
22
Mr. Hunt. I do not.

Mr. Baron. And are you aware from whatever source of
24
any assassination planning or attempts that Pash was involved

Mr. Hunt. I am not.
5
Mr. Baron.
Does your answer include not only the period
4
of time before you talked with Colonel Pash but after you
talked with Colonel Pash?
5
6
Mr. Hunt. Yes, sir.
7
I might add that I was rather briefly at CIA headquarters
8
at that time and within a very short period of time after I
9
10
had had my interview with Colonel Pash, I was transferred to the
Guatemala project, the overthrow of Guatemala.
11
WARD & PAUL
12
Mr. Baron. Is that the reason why you did not follow up
on the problem with this particular suspected double agent
13
after not receiving satisfaction from Colonel Pash?
14
Mr. Hunt. That certainly could have been one reason.

On the other hand, I was chief of, I can see I'm really going

The late King Zog was avelient of mine sin the sense that

in Egypt. I had made a trip at one time over to Egypt to
20
try to intercede indirectly with Colonel Nasser for King Zog
21
who was very upset about the disappearance and loss of all
22
of his partisans in the operations that the Agency was conducting.
23
24
And he was my concern much less the the counter-
intelligence or espionage aspect, which is not my function, but

14
I had a client-King to worry about. And also, we were trying
to bring Zog into this country. So I became interested as
3
4

5
a matter of King Zog's disaffection in what was happening tor
his rotainers Why were they being parachuted to their
deaths in Albania? And that was my introduction to the whole
6

8
scene in West Germany, where the balance of his retainers were
being held by the CIA. Well, not being held, but where they
were being housed and trained for Albanian operations.
Mr. Baron.
9
Can you explain the term "retainer"?
10
11
12
13
Mr. Hunt. Well, I understood that when he finally got
out of Albania, that he brought with him what I can best
describe as retainers. That is bodyguards, members of his
personal staff, probably some relatives. I think he had
four or five sisters with him. But the able-bodied portion
14
15
16
17
of those loyalists who came out with him we had largely taken
over thanks to Zog, who, in offect, ordered them to cooperate
with us. And then he never saw them again. He naturally
became apprehensive.
18
19
20
So that was my interest in what was happening to the
Albanians that we parachuted in through King Zog. I had no
functional counter-espionage interest in the affair. This

Mr. Baron. Who would that have been at the time?

But that would be the person primarily

suspected double agent?
5

10
Mr. Hunt. I have no idea because, as I may have indicated
previously off the record, it became apparent some years later
that the unfortunate fate of our Albanian agents was linked
far more closely to the revelations of Kim Philby, the
Soviet agent who was in direct liaison with us in Washington
11
12
and in Great Britain, rather than any penetration, although
the possibility of a penetration was of course always there.
But I don't think that anybody was ever focused.

Again, I left for Latin American affairs. I left the
Division about that time and I really never heard about it
again. Dong Blaufarb, the Albanian chief, departed for
Southeast Asia, and the whole sort of complex of knowledgeable
people was broken up through normal transfers and special
activities like the Guatemala project.
Mr. Baron. Was Doug Blaufarb, knowledeable about your
approach to Colonel Pash?

Mr. Hunt. The then Chief of Foreign Intelligence and
Counter-Intelligence for the Division.
And I think now that that
was Charley English, Charles English. I think he wore both
hats. He had both foreign intelligence responsibility and
the counter-intelligence responsibility. And I might have told
the division chief about it, although it was not, it had not
achieved such stature at that point that I would have
necessarily talked to the Division Chief, who I believe at
that time was John Richardson of later Vietnam fame.
It's also possible that the Division Chief in that era
was John Baker, now deceased, who left that division to
become Chief of the PP staff, and that would have been a
normal follow through for me if I had discussed it with John
Baker, my direct Chief, and then to have discussed it with
him when he was my staff chief in the overall political and
psychological staff.
Mr. Baron. Anyone else who would have known about your
approach to Colonel Pash or about
Mr. Hunt. Or his function.
Mr. Baron. Yes, that Colonel Pash was considered to have
assassinations as one of his functions.
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003

Mr. Hunt. We had a Colonel Buffington who at that time
was a member of the PP staff, the overall PP staff, and I think

Tracy Barnes, Mr. John Baker, who I've already mentioned, and Mr
Lewis W. Thompson. These men were all at one time or another
chiefs of the Agency's PP staff.
Another man now living to the best of my knowledge who
might well have had knowledge of Pash's function was the
then-chief of the Economic Warfare staff of the PP staff and his

There's a man named Harold Burris Meyer who was in the
Psychological Warfare Branch of the PP staff. I believe at
that time there was an International Organizations Branch
which later became the International Organizations Division,
then headed by Cord Myer, Jr., and his Deputy at that time was
Tom Braden, the now-columnist whose wife has just ascended to
the Executive Office Building. There were members of the
Labor Branch, and I'm trying to think of that branch of office
that was down the hall.

There was a labor branch. The people in there might know.
There was a lady lawyer named Carol somebody who was very
knowledgeable about what was going on in that area.
Mr. Baron. Knowledeable about Pash's activities?
Mr. Hunt. Well, in the sense that when you have an
adjoining office, you usually pretty much know what the other
fellow is doing. Just in that sense, because her function
in the labor branch had nothing to do with Pash, to my
knowledge.
What I'm trying to do here is to give you sort of a
congeries of people alive and dead who would have had contact
knowledge, at the very least, of what Pash's function was.
Mr. Baron. Were each of these units referred to as

1 Operations and OPC, the staff structure emerged as follows:
2
Reporting to the Deputy Director for Plans, i.e. Frank
Wisner, whose Chief of Operations then was Richard Helms, this
is the Clandestine Services Organization. There was our
support staff, the PP staff, the Foreign Intelligence staff,
the Counter-Intelligence, Counter-Espionage staff, and of
course the famous staff "D".
Also reporting to the Deputy Director for Plans were all
of the geographical divisions, such as Western Europe, Southeast
Europe, Asia, Near East, and so forth.
Mr. Baron. Now at this point Frank Wisner was DDP,
Richard Helms was his deputy.
Mr. Hunt.
Richard Helms was his Chief of Operations.
Mr. Baron.
All right. The Chief of the PP staff was
Mr. Hunt. Either Tracy Barnes or John Baker or Louis.
Thompson. E
Mr. Baron.
And you were located on the South European
Mr. Hunt.
Southern Europe Division.
Mr. Baron.
Who headed that division at that point?
Mr. Hunt. Either John Baker or John Richardson.
So as you see, I had a line responsibility to the Chief
of the Southeast Europe Division, as indicated in Exhibit 3.
At the same time I had a functional responsibility to the
Chief of the PP staff, who was Mr. Barnes or Mr. Baker or
Mr. Thompson, just as the Chief of FI for the Southeast Europe

17
Of all of the individuals that you have just mentioned,
which ones do you know to your own certainty were clearly
knowledgeable of Boris Pash's activities?
Mr. Hunt. Artie Lazaruss would be the first one, and
after that I can only speculate. I would have to assume that
Doug Blaufarb acquired knowledge of it, but perhaps he acquired
knowledge through me. I'm not sure. I have made a list of
other people whom I have not mentioned who conceivably, by
virtue of personal contact or functional responsibility, might
well have been aware of Pash's true functional responsibility
within the Agency.
Mr. Baron. Before I ask you to tick off that list, let's
make it clear that all of the names, in addition to Artie
Lazanış, are names that you have given as people who are
likely to have been knowledgeable of Pash's activities because
of their place in the organization structure at that time.

410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003

Mr. Hunt. That's correct, or as I have indicated in some
cases, as with the PP labor branch by virtue of physical
proximity to that office.
21
22
Mr. Baron. Okay. Why don't you now just run very briefly
through the names of other people who you think could conceivably
23
have been knowledgeable of Pash's function?
24
Mr. Hunt. In some cases I'm going to have to give you their

title designation rather than the name of the individual because
2
5
so much time has passed, I have simply forgotten who it was
in that particular era.
4
Peter Sichel, who at that time was a member of the German
5
branch of the Western Europe Division, he has since retired
6
and is running his family's wine business in New York. Certainly
7
the then Chief of Western Europe Division, of which Germany
8
9
was a functional part and the Chief of Operations of Western
Europe should know.
10
I would think that Jim Angleton, who would have had
11
12
13
direct knowledge and always was the Chief of the CI/CE staff.
The Chief of base in Berlin, if in fact Pash conducted any
activities in that area, certainly the Chief of base in
Berlin would have been knowledgeable about it.

Also, the Chief of base at Pollack, which was where we
had the cellen Operation going on. I don't know whether
Bill Harvy, that is William Harvy, at that time was Chief of
Operations for Berlin for whether he was simply running the
tunnel, but Harvy might well have some knowledge of Pash.
I would certainly assume that when we're talking about
liquidations and that sort of thing that the Agency's overall
Office of Security somewhere within it must have been involved,
such German Division personnel as might be available today,
23
West German, and I would also suggest that General Cushman might
24
be knowledgeable for this reason.

It was about that time that General Cushman was still
assigned to the CIA. I could be wrong about that but I seem

15

to have a memory of Cushman being around in those days. He
4
5
6

was then a Colonel. I had associated with him. In fact, we
had shared an office at one time, but that was several years
earlier. I would place it about early 1949. But I'm quite
sure that Cushman was around in that period of time and
involved with the PP staff, though what his function was I

don't know.

19
Mr. Hunt. I never had any, no. In fact, I've only seen
20
him once in my life, to the best of my recollection.
21
Mr. Baron. As you may know, William Harvey was tasked
22
in 1961 with setting up an executive action capability at
23
24
the CIA, tasked originally by Richard Bissell to carry out
assassinations if required.

that for this one question, which is are you aware of any

with assassination planning. And specifically, for that
reason, I'm not aware of any involvement that Dr. Gunn might

that led up to it.
Who were your supervisors that gave you the impression
that Colonel Pash was prepared to carry out assassinations?

Mr. Hunt. I wish I could give you a distinct name.
think I covered that in an impressionistic way by saying that
Tracy Barnes and John Baker, who were at different times
sequentially chiefs of the PP staff, it seems to me that Barnes
was probably the one who indicated that Pash had such a
capability.
I know that I did not get it from Blaufar and I'm
quite sure that my information did not come from within the
Southeast Europe Division. It must have come accordingly
from the Political and Psychological staff, the contacts there,
24
25
and I would have to say Tracy Barnes or John Baker are the

most likely.
Mr. Baron. And neither of those two men are alive today?
Mr. Hunt.
That's right.
Mr. Baron. Did whoever gave you the information about
5 Boris Pash indicate to you that there were any other units
in the CIA that could take care of such problems by means of
assassination?
6

8
Mr. Hunt. No. My distinct impression and recollection is
9
the function, if indeed it existed, and I believed it then
10
11
to have existed as I do today, was centralized or focused in
Colonel Pash and tile Lazarus.

Mr. Baron. Now what would have been the formal title
of the unit that Colonel Pash and Artie Lazarus were running?
Mr. Hunt. If it had one, I never knew it.
15
Mr. Baron. Can you add any other detail to the record
16
17
18
on your talk with Colonel Pash and his reaction to your
request that he consider on a general level the planning of
an assassination of a suspected double agent?

19
Mr. Hunt. Well, as I recall it, my conversation with him
20
was a relatively brief one. I stepped in the door, met him,
21
22
23
saw Aable Lazarus, who I knew briefly, or at least knew him
by sight, and I sat down and I said, we have this problem in
the Albanian branch. We may need somebody liquidated in
24
Western Germany.
Can you handle it if that day comes, or if
25
it comes to that?

And he seemed a little startled. I have already indicated
that. What I'm trying to do now is to refine my thoughts more
than I did previously when we were taking sort of a wide
swipe at the canvas.
Colonel Pash indicated or said to me that it was a matter
6
7
that would have to be approved by higher authority and as
a relatively low ranking officer in those days, I thought he
1
8
9
was probably referring to Frank Wisner. And indeed, he may
have. It never got pushed up to Frank Wisner's level because
10
11
there
no direct approach or a request for such approval
was ever made.
I left with the impression that Colonel Pash was glad
12
13
that he wasn't going to have any business for me or that he
14
15
16
had successfully deflected whatever approach I might be making
to him because it would give him and Artle Lazarus an
opportunity to drink more coffee and to draw their salaries
17
18
from the Agency while affecting to do a job that they were
perhaps not equipped to do.
19
20
Now again, that impression I had when I left him was at
variance with what I had heard before I came in, where I heard
21
he and Astle or he at least had been active in West Germany
22
in wet affairs, particularly kidnappings and that sort of
23
thing.
24
Mr. Baron.
And you carried into his office the impression
25
that Colonel Pash was a man who could carry off an assassination

Mr. Hunt. No.
2
Mr. Baron. Did you ever discuss this matter with anyone

other than Colonel Pash?
4
Mr. Hunt.
In that context?
5
Mr. Baron.
In the context of assassinations or kidnapping.
6
Mr. Hunt.
Well, I wasn't involved in plotting or planning

any kidnappings. Again, I would suggest that I might very
well have gone back to Blaufarb, who was the most interested
individual, because he was responsible at the branch level

10 for King Zog as an operational tool, whereas, I had an overall
political responsibility for King 20g. And I have described
the background of that, the rubric under which I became
interested in the Albanian problem in the first place, and
then having talked to Pash, it would have been only natural

for me to have
