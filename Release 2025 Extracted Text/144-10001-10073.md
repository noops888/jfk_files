--

The tragic death of the President of the United States

has caused great shock and uneasiness.

The first reaction from political and official circles shows

concern over an event which they feel will considerably weaken

in the next few months the international policy of the West

particularly with regard to the USSR.

I shall continue to report via air mail.
