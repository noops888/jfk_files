Meeting of SGA On Operation MONGOOSE, 6 September 1962. Discussion of LANSDALE'S

suggestion #32 (agricultural sabotage). GENERAL CARTER emphasized the extreme

sensitivity of any such operation and the disasterous results that would flow

from something going wrong particularly if there were obvious attribution to

-the-U.S. He went on to say, however, that it would be possible to accomplish

this purpose by methods more subtle than those indicated in the paper. He men-

tioned specifically the possibility of producing crop failures by che in roduction

of piological agene which would appear to be of natural origin. BUNDY said that

he had no worries about any such sabotage which could clearly be made to appear

as a result of local Cuban disaffection or a natural disaster, but that we must

avoid external activities such as release of chemicals, etc. unless they could

Helms detailed his conversation

with the young Cuban fron the failu(?) who pointed out that they were willing to

people only on operations which they regarded as sensible. Helms defines

sensible in Cuban terminology as meaning an action which would contribute to the liberatic

of their country, another way of saying that the United States, perhaps in conjunction

with other Latin American countries, would bail them out militarily. Helms' point

was specially echoed by Huston and Ryan.
