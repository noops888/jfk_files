the first man contacted by MI. Maheu, worked through a

Cuban exile leader. And he offered -- and he said that he

could do something of this nature provided he got some funds

and the assistance. And he was supported in this regard.

And I think again we have some doubts as to the accuracy of

his reporting..

Mr. Schwarz.

In November 1961 did MI. Bissell inästruct

a William Harvey to take charge of the gambling syndicate

operation designed to kill Fidel Castro? Page 3 of Mr. Greer's

report, which is at the beginning of your report.

Mr. Colby. I believe so, yes.

Yes. That is what our evidence says, the summary

sais, "of the evidence available". And this is the evidence

available in 1963. And there

have been some minor changes in

some of the details of this summary, very minor changes.

But the essence of this report is still roughly accurate, I

believe.

Mr. Schwarz.

Mr. Harvey -- was Mr. Harvey the man that

had hired an agent in order to kill Imumba?

Mr. Colby. Mr. Harvey was the head of Staff D, Staff D

and in the process, you obviously work up

some people who are able to do this kind of work, which is

quite different from the normal life style of most of us.

Mr. Harvey had been a very venturesome officer in the

past. He was responsible for the Berlin tunnel.. And he was

sent down, to take this job. And he assumed as part of it the

capability of -- he was given by Mi. Bissel this chore of

carrying

on this particular operation as well.

Mr.

Schwarz. Had he been the person who had, in

connection with the abortive effort to kill Mr. Lmumba,

hired

an agent for that purpose?

MI. Colby. I have forgotten whether hehired him. He

• And there are some very obscure

references that an additional assignment was to look into the

possible assassination of MI. Lmumba.

The evidence is

that he went down to what is now Kinshasa, Elizabethville in

1960, stayed there a few weeks, and left in October, I

believe. And then Mr. Lmumba was killed thereafter in a totally

separate set of circumstances in which we had nothing to do.

There is some indication that a CIA officer who was asked

to have something to do with this particular job said he did

not want to do it.

Chairman Church. What was the name of the CIA agent who

MI. Colby. To my knowledge it is Mr. Raymond Rocca.

Chairman Church. Where is it now?

Mr. Colby. He retired at the end of December of last year.

He remained working for us for a few months. I think he is

retired. I think he is retired. I believe he is still in

the Washington area.

Mr. Knoche. Yes, he is still working with us.

Mr. Colby. Still working with us to help on the transi-

Chairman Church. Why did he retire?

Also, I believed that there was a undue degree of compart-

We debated this and discussed it and I

set as my time limit for this discussion the end of December:

because there were some very substantial retirement benefits

that people would loose if they stayed after that point. Then

unfortunately the Seymour Hirsh article of December 22nd came

Chinese Communists subsequently blamed the Chinssa Nationalists

and the US for sabotaging the aircraft. The aircraft employee

had fled to Taiwan.

We had nothing to do with that incident

and frankly heard about it after it occurred. '

In the fall of 1956, a

senior Chinese Nationalist official

informed an officer of CIA that a Chinese National planned to

assassinate Chou En Lai during his visit to Cambodia in

November '56 and had been thwarted by the Cambodian arrest of

the Chinese Nationalist officer sent to Phnom Penh to supervise

them.

Me. Harvey was given the resporsibility of this by Mr:

Bissel and originally it continued as a separate action from

the Castro operation, but Mr. Harvey was also given that

responsibility, and for all interts and purposas they became

wedded.

Mr. Helms was the person who formally approved 7R Rifle

as a project.

ZR Rifle had a dual purpose that has not been

clarified by our inquiry. It apparently was in fact

used for

the stated purposes, as far as organizational activities went

along, which

was

to steal

codes

and Mr. Helms, when he

approved

the project, authorized accountirg

on certification,

which meant that rather than the usual vouchers supporting

expenditures, that the officer involved would simply certify

that the money had been spent and this would be accepted.

It had a project amount of some dollars, 57500 - 510,009-

some of it to include the salary of an agent, some to inclus

operating expenses.

So Mr. Helms' main appearance in the approval of ZR Pifla

doas not necessarily equate with the date when he became

faniliar with the Castro operation.

Me. Schwarz. Because of the dual purpose of Rifle, Riêle

means both, rifle files and used iifles?

Mr. Sreckirridge.

It may mean either or boch.

Mr. Schwarz. November 1961?

Mr. Breckinridge.

I think that is probably correct.

It

was in the fall of 1961 that Mr. Harvey was given this assignment

by MI. Eissel. I think MI. Bisse- left in 1962. I am avi sure

of the dates, So MI. Bissel would have known at that time.

But I am not sure after that.

Chairman Church. Helms succeeded Mr. Bissel as chief

of operations?

Mr. Colby. Deputy Director of Plans.

Chairman Church. Deputy Director for Plans.

Your record shows that Helms had knowledge of the ZR Rifle

operation, which, among other things, was to develop an executive

capability - whatever that means. Presumably that means a

capability to conduct an assassination if and when authorized

by proper authority?

Mr. Breckinridge. That is my understanding.

Chairman Church. Is that your understanding?

Mr. Breckinridge. Yes, sir.

Chairman Church. Do your records show that, or is that

based upon what has been revealed through your interrogation?

MI. Breckinridge. First, let me go back and clarify, then

I will answer this question, if I may.

would be mounted under the direction of a man

about whom all I know is that Mr. Harvey has a background of

something like a soldier of fortune, and funded at the level,

I should say, of $7500 to $10,000?

Does

it not suggest to you that stealing codes was in

1(BJ

fact an internal cover for what was explicitly an assassination

operation with unlimited, non-voucher financial capability?

Mr. Colby. No, not that it is purely a cover.

In the first place, Mr. Harvey had a very successful tour

in Berlin where he ran the Berlin tunnel operation, which was

one of our major successful intelligence operations.

Mr. Harvey was a

very colorful figure who had his lifestyle.!

as well as this other activity.

Now, in the lifestyle at the time, not mentioning the second

one, this gets back into the recordkeeping that we have been

discussing. It was not to be put on the record although to be

done. That is a perfectly proper hypothesis, it seems to me,

but to say that

the code stealing was only a cover I think is

1

probably an unwarranted conclusion.

Senator Hart of Colorado. What about the level of funding

of $7,500 to $10,000?

Mr. Colby. That is not

very much money for that kind of

an operation.

Senator Hart of Colorado. Precisely. I think it is too

little.

Mr. Colby. No. For a capability of that nature, it is

largely a staff operation. In other words, you use your own

staff officers. You may hire an agent of something, but I don't

think you can draw much conclusion from the actual number on

the figure one way or the other.

This might not have been the only such project. You know,

assassination project would cost you more money than that,

too.

Senator Hart of Colorado.

Absolutely.

Mr. Colby. I find it hard to say that that is the only

amount of money involved. I think you get into a situation

where additional money would be out into either of those kinds

MI. Breckinridge. Robert Maheu used to work for tbe

Mr. Sreckinridge. In the early days -- and this becomes

ambarrassment. As nearly as I can reconstruct, the people

who knew him decided to put him on a rotainer in the Office

of Security, which they did for awhile, until he was so

successful he said he no longer added the retainer, which he

didn'‡ do much to earn. He later got involved zapsesasting

one of the Greek shipping interests and we were given the

results of some of the information that he obtained from thas

MI. Schwarz. In the discussion we had on the use of

criminal elements, we have dealt with the Castro operation.

In the middle of the book sipplied to us by Mr. Breckinridge

earlier this week, there is a discussion about the Lumumba

operation, and the Agent l. J. Win.

Now, is it a fact that l. j. Win was the agent, or asset,

however you would refer to him, who apparently was considered

for the effort to assassinate Lumumba, which never took place;

is that right?

Mr. Colby. Yes, sir.

Mr. Schwarz. Now, is it accurate that l. J. Win operated
