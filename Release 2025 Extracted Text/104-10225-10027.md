EFFECTIVE EXPLOITATION OF GENERAL PINOCHET'S OFFER TO EXCHANGE A

NUMBER OF POLITICAL PRISONERS FOR AN EQUAL NUMBER OF SOVIET AND/OR

CUBAN PRISONERS IS OPPORTUNITY TO BLUNT HOSTILE PROPAGANDA. IF THE

USSR AND CHILE CAN BE LUMPED TOGETHER IN POPULAR MIND AS EACH HAVING

FOLITICAL PRISO:ERS, THE SITUATION CAN BE EXPLOITED TO DIVERT SOME OF

ATTENTION FROM JUNTA'S SUPPOSED MISDEEDS TO SOVIET HANDLING OF

POLITICAL PRISONERS. A REPORT FROM A SENSITIVE SOURCE INDICATES THAT

THE SOVIETS AND CUBANS ARE CONCERNED OVER THE PRESSURES THAT COUBLD

DEVELOP FROM THE OFFER. Y

2. THE EXCHANGE OFFER HAS ASPECTS THAT WOULD BE ATTRACTIVE TO.

NUMEROUS GROUPS IN EUROPE BUT THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE REACTION,

PROBABLY SECAUSE OF CHILE'S EXTREME UNPOPULARITY AND THE LACK OF BOTH

A NEUTRAL SPONSOR AND SUFFICIENT PUBLICITY. EUROPEAN COMMUNISTS

PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS FOR THE COMMUNICATIONS Fur

MEDIA I:' ALLENDE'S CHILE

HIGHLIGHTS

Psych far

.. Since President Allende's electoral victory in 1970, the Government

propiganda apparalas has sounted a coordinated campign againas

the opposition communications media focusing on the prestigious

El Mercurio newspaper chain and key opposition radios. The long..

range goal is to create conditions that will ingure Government

control over the media so that an emasculated opposition vill operate

intuitively and through self-condorship within in approved framework.

• The opposition radio stations bear the brunt of an array of legal

and illegal devices designed to intimidate them.

These devices

include the threat of violence, favoritism in the distribution of

essential Government advertiting revenue, temporary closures,

and Government-fomented etrikes.

-- Chile's national television -- the only country-vide channel -- has

become an important propaganda instrument for the Government.

But it is being challenged by a Catholic University channel which is

attempting to expand its service beyond the Santiago arca.

-- A major confrontation between the Government and the opposition,

lasting more than a year, has taken place at the Papelera, Chile's

only important private neusprint producer, with the company

supported by the opposition redia stymying repeated Government

efforts to take over the firm.

The paper company claims that

Government price policies have brought it close to bankruptcy.

- Despite officially-sanctioned harassment, the opposition media

have continued to function, taking advantage of the fluid political

aituation currently prevailing in Chile, and have become increasingly

effective in exploiting the Government's economic failures and the

growing dissensión within the ruling Marxist coalition.

-- Nevertheless, the opposition's economic base that sustains its media

is being slowly undermined as the Government expands its control

over the Chilean economy.

slany opposition media are reportedly

already in difficult financial straits.

The Chilean Communist Party,

seeking to strengthen its voice in the March 1973 Congressional

elections, has alrcady purchased five beleaguered radio stations

(one a former opposition station) in southern Chile.

"Allende'e treatment of the opposition media and his utilization of

the pro-Government media offer revealing insight: into the unique

claim that Chile will carry out i Socialict revolution within the frane-

work of traditional bourgcois and democratic instilutions without

social cost.

Any Chilean government possesger wide powers thet can be employed

'to control and intimidate media opponerts given sufficient will power and

•cyniciom to do so, despite the fact thai media frocdoms in Chile are

twice-guaranteed, both in the 1925 constitution and in a statute of

constitutional guarantees agreed to by Alleride's Popular Unity coalition

and the Christian Democrats. (PDC) as a condition for PDC support for

Allende in the congressional run-off held cubsequent lo the Presidential

election in September 1970.

What are some of these powers? An; Chilean executive under

•provisions of the State Internal Securit; Lay may establish emergency

zones by decrec hended by military comtanders coyowering the State

to enforce news censorship and to restrict access to newsprint supplies.

A law on publicity abuses empowers the government to petition the

courts to suspend access to news and information. (laws on the books

that pose potential threats to freedom of radio information are more

severe and more frequently utilized. See Section Ill. B. Radio.)

Furthermore, through the judicious parceling out of advertising fror.

State and autonomous State firms any government can discrininate

against opposition media by denying or restricting this key source uf

revenue.

Unlike predecessor governments vitich utilized rxisting laws and

accepted practices to reward political associates and benefit business

partners, the Allende Government has consistently and frequently

applied these measures to harass, to intimidate, and to undermine the

morale of political and class opponents in the media. These tactics

are applied throughout the country.

-A badic organizational rechnique for the Up coalition has been the

•"establishment of UP cominittees (CUP -- Comilé de Unidad Popular) --

composed of newsmen who are militant meintere of parties belonging

to the Government coalition or independent supporters of UP policies --

in newspapere, radios, magazines, and in journalistic bodies.

The:

CUt''s have been most active at the union level: demanding exorbilant

wage incrcades, insisting that UP employece be given the right t

express their opinion on cditorial pages, disrupting legitimate union

meetings, forming rump unions, and leaking internal company dali to

the leftiat press and to the Government.

The goal of certain Unidad Popular militants regarding freccom of

the press was most explicitly and rovealingly atated by the organizing

committee for a conference of leftist journalintg which was held in

Santiago in April 1971.

The committee issued the following statement

prior to the conference:

•.. we believe that we must fight for true freedom of

the press, which will only be posoible when there is

true economic independence. We maintain that Chile

will have true freedom of the press only when the means

of mass communication are part of the area of encial

property, that is, (when they) belong to all Chileans.

The press, radio, television, and the theater must be

tools at the service of liberation and culture of our

people and not a private business, an ideological

battering ram of the national and foreign minority

(the capitalists) as is presently the case.? (under.

lining added)

Another statement said "the mission of journalists" is to support and

defend the People's Government (the UP) together with all the workers."

The declaration also underlined the support of UP newsmen lor

"Viet-Nam, Cuba, and all the people that are building Socialism, "

and threw a bouquet at Cuba's Prensa Latina agency for its "objective"'

reporting of the Chilean phenomenon.

Allende himsel lent legitimacy

to the mission of UP journalists in a speech kicking off the conterence

when he stated that "committed" newsmen must act as the "ranguurd"

of the revolution by "elevating the political level of the people."

Reiterating a theme expressed on many other occasions, Allende

aGgerted that his Government would respect freedom oi information

while at the same time he lamented his Government's "excessive

tolerance" for the opposition media.

by Allende himself at public rallies. Allende, too, periodically reicts

radio station

which over the yeard had carned a reputation for objec-

radio field. It has suffered more temporary closures than any radio

facility.

The station was shut down, for example, 17 hours in

June 1971 for broadcasting an alleged "alarmist" report during the

State of Emergency decreed after the assassination o! Perez Lujovic,

a former interior minister in the

Frei Government. At the same

time a UP station, Portales, received nothing more than an admoni-

cion for transmitting "alarmist" news more acceptable to UP

propagandists: During the August-September 1971 period Radio

Balmaceda was shut down on three separate occasions under

the Up'a principal propaganda arm in the film field. Rival Chilcan

private producers went out oi business, squeezed by rising production

coote and discriminatory lad and exchange rate treatment that denied

them needed equipment and spare parts irom ab road. Chile Films

signed a comprehensive exchange accord in March 1971 with the Cuban

Cinematographic Institute (iC.AIC) (Sce Section V. C. Exchange of

Viaitors, and Exchange Agreements).

institute (leitist) at the University of Chile, the film institute at the

ment information office,

the film departmeat oi the Communist-

dominated CUT (Central U'nica de Trajahadores -- the major labor

organization), the national television network, and the University of

Chile televigion station.

The stated purpose of the accords was to

"develop the new Chilean silra industry."

Its products are intended to glorify the roles of workers, peasants,

and students in the march to Chilean-style Socialism, romanticize the

proletarian role vi the Chilear Communist ard Socialist Parties, and

attack the "bourgeoisie" ard their "imperialist" allies. Despite an

intense publicity buildup, however, few films actually appeared in

the 1970-72 period. Most oi the films thai were produced appeared to

be pieced together from newsreel film taken during the Allende

presidential campaign or from post-eleciion political rallies.

The Papolora Confröntation

The Compañla "lanufacturera de Papeles Y Cartones (known as

the Papelera), Chile's major private producer cé

arusprint, became

another propagarde balleground cast by the opposition in terms of

"freedom versus Marxist totalitarianism.".

In October 1971, the Government, carrying out a long-standing

pledge, announced that CORFO (the Government Derelopment

Corporation) had opened negotiations to buy out the Papolera through

the purchase of its stock.

The opposition media iminediately launched

a campaign to warn the public that the free press sould be crippled

if newsprint distribution were placed at the merc; of Government

suppliers. At the same time, the opposition media pleaded with

private shareholders to refuse to sell lo the Goveranent. In addition,

a "frecdom fund" was created chabling private persons to buy up

Papelera shares to prevent the company from felting into Government

hands.

For several months pro- and anti-Governmer: media carried out

daily an in:ensive propaganda battle in advertisemerts, news stories,

and editorials.

Botn sides resorted to the familiar numbers game:

the pro-Allende media claimed that the Government was besieged by

willing shareholders eager to sell out; the opposition asserted that

shareholders were resisting temptation. Goverr=en propagandists

argued that neusprint production vas essential to tze State and must

be controlled by the Siate; the opposition said Pacelera must remain

in private hands as á patriotic duty.

Thwarted to date in its attempt to buy out Pagelera shareholders,

the Government has not hesitated to use other mrezzares -- price

controls, labor-induced production shortages, and strong-arm tactics --

to prevent the delivery of raw material to the plane.

Growing opposition confidence fed by an election victory at the

University of Chile in April 1972 and 3y stitiening opposition

attitudes at Santiago's Catholic University had important spill-over

effects in television programming al a channels run by Catholic

University. Increasing opposition elicitiveness even raised the

their opponenes. Opposition authorities who now control the channel

are proceeding cautiously egsinet them.

A snore significant indication of UP long-range attitudes toward

television freedoms has licen the Government's persistent refusil lo

permit university television stations to extend their networks

throughout Chile. In Septernier 1972, President Allende blocked the

opposition's most recent attempt to obtain legislative sanction fur

such an extension by vetoing elected ileins in a PDC-introduced bill.

The Government claimed trat its own bill -- pending before Congress

and allowing universities to establish stitions only within the

territory in which the seat of each university is located -- would

create a national netword. for all recognized universities on an

"equal and non-discriminatory" basis.

What the Government did

not say was that the bill if passed would preserve the State dework's

position as the only single channel that can be viewed by a national

television audience.

Presumably the Governinent bill also would

permit the Communist-dominated State Technical University lo

operate a television station in Santiago in competition with Santiago's

in his coalition were in a distinct minority in the

Congress, and although there was no doubt about the

legitimacy of his election by that body, his victory

had only been possible because of the conditional

support of the Christian Democrats.

The PDC, it

should be noted, included both Radomiro Tornic.

crats on the points in his program with which they

were In agreement. This might have prövoked the

secession of some of the rightist members of the

PDC, but it an accord had been reached with the

party's leaders, it would likely have given Allende

a majority in the Congress for at least part of his

program.

Flushed with victory and unwilling to come to

terms with the party which he had termed "the new

face of reaction" during the campaign, Allende chose

an alternative strategy. The next congressional elec-

tions were not scheduled to take place until March

1973, but the Chilean Constitution provided that in

the event of a conflict with the Congress over the

text of a constitutional amendment, the President

could call a national plebiscite. The strategic course.

adopted by Allende was to attempt to expand popu.

lar support for his coalition and then propose a

constitutional amendment which, in accordance with

the. Popular Unity electoral program, would replace

the existing bicameral legislature with a unicameral

Allende's strategy for the expansion of electoral

support was an economic one which drew as much

from John Maynard Keynes as it did from Karl Mark.

The Chilean econony, already operating belon

capacity, had gone into a prolound recession as a

government also had a cushion of nearly $400

million in foreign reserves left lo it by the Frei

government as a result of high international prices

for copper, Chile's principal export.)

The strategy also contained a Marxist element-

lower-class Chileans, there was also 1o be an elfort

Expressing the diametric opposit of a claim often

voiced by his predecessor, Eduardo Frei, Allende

eaid in a press conference just after his installation,

"I am nol president of all Chileans." And in his first

"Slute of the Nation" message lo the Congress he

asserted:

•'.. the People's Government (Gobierno Popular) is

inspired in ils policy dy a premise that le artificially

denied by some-the cristence of classes and social

secrors with antagonistic and opposing intereses.'

Allende's economic advisers anticipated an addi:

tional source of revenue for the government from

the "exploitative" profits of the industries that were

to be nationalized by the new government. The par.

tially American-owned copper mines were lo be

laken over by a constitutional amendment-toth lo

the Frei Chileanization agreements of 1967 and

1969, and because a general consensus, in Chile

through the purchase of shares on the open market

by the government development agency. The latter

course seemed facilitated by the fact that the price

of shares had been depressed since the elections,

and further economic pressures could be crested

by allowing wage increases but forbidding any rise

in prices. The legal adviser to the zovernment,

Eduardo Novoa, also outlined other "legal loopholes"

in existing Chilean las which could be used for

"pemporary" takeovers

of companies,

including

"intervention" because of labor disputes and "requi-

sition" because of a "breakdown in supply of an

article of prime necessity.".

A month later in a by-election in Valparalso, the

victorious Christian Democratic candidate received

the support of the Right. The tacit alliance with the

Right led to the secession from the PDC of eight

deputies and a number of other party leaders to form

the pro-Allende liquierda Cristiana (Christian Left).

This was counterbalanced however, by a split in the

other direction within the Allende coalition. Five of

the seven Radical senators (including two former

presidential candidates) and 7 of the 19 deputies

The opposition controlled the legislature, and in

October 1971. the Christian Democrats and the

rightist parties attempted to assert legislative con-

in favor of a constitutional amendment limiting the

use of the intervention and requisition procedures

Allende's overthrow in September 1973.

Allende's refusal to accept the amendment or to

call a plebiscite to resolve his differences with the

to be a decisive indication of his determination to

bypass the legislature in carrying out the Popular

Two days before the September coup, Altamirano

admitted that he had encouraged navymen do resist

was joined by two oiher generals who, with Prais,

The resignation of what appeared to be the last

all three services were opposed to the President. it

coincided with the adoption on the same day of a

"sense of the house" (acuerdo) resolution by the

Chamber of Deputies directed at the President and

the military ministers, drawing their atrention to

"the serious breakuown of the constitutional and

government for repestedly bypassing the legislature

to promulgate the constitutional reforms voed by

During the same weekend, Allende met with the

leaders of his Popular Unity coalition and railed for

the holding of a plebiscite on his conduer ei ofice.

Although this step was reportedly opposed by the

Socialists,

that

September 7, the military commanders proceeded on

To justify their action, the military. commanders

broadcast a communiqué to the

nation. While ad.

mitting that the Allende government had initially

come to power by legal means, they announced that

it had "fallen into flagrant illegitimacy" by violating

fundamental rights, by "artificially fomenting the

class struggle," by refusing to implement the de

cisions of the Congress.

the judiciary

and the

Controller-General, by causing a critical decline in

agricultural, commercial and industrial activity in

the country, and by bringing about a state of in-

flation and anarchy which "threaten the internal and

external security of the country." The coup leaders

concluded:

These reasons are sufficient in the light of classical

doctrine ... to justity our inierention to depuse a

government which is illegitimate. immoral, and un

representative of the overwheiming sentiment of the

nation."

used was a gift from Fidel Castro."

(The argument that Allende's economic probiems

were the result of a shortage of foreign credit does

nor really hold water, since they were caused by

policies initiated before the foreign squeeze and

since, in any event, Allende's regime managed to

secure enough foreign credits from Latin American,

European, Soviet and Chinese sources to increase

the Chilcan foreign debt from $2.6 billion to $3.4

billion in less than three years. Much of the new

indebtedness was to Western Europe and other Latin

American countries. Surprisingly, Chile's debt to the

USSR, China and Eastern Europe increased only.from

and

C'onclusions

Since the coup, comments in the world

press

representing widely divergent political postures have

cored the Chilean case as

proof that the hope of

schieving Marxist socialism

through democratic

means is a vain one. Yet most people have failed to

note two fundamental errors of the Allende policy,

mither of which was essentially related to the

attempt to establish democratic socialism:

because of Chile's deeply-rooted commitment to the

democratic system and because she Marxist parries

were able to mobilize a part of the proletariat and

the peasantry, and he had at his disposal many

instruments for state control of the economy which

had been developed by previous administrations

since the 1930's. However, he was required to

operate within an institutional system which included

frequent and staggered elections, proportional rep.

resentation, and a multiparly system which made

had been characterized for nearly a century by a

chronic tendency to inflation, and successive govern.

interest of securing urban electoral support. The

most important systemic constraint of all, of course,

was the existence of a prolessionalized and insti.

rutionally-loyal military which was unresponsive lo

the ideological blandishments of the Lelt."

The immediate causes of the military intervention

are apparent from the preceding account. In the last

part of 1972, the military were drawn into Chilean

politics by both sides and became as polarized as

the rest of Chilean society-with the overwhelming

majority joining the opposition to Allende. The con-

Then the expansion of arms

Chile was becoming an armed camp on the verge

of civil war. Finally, the efforts to subvert the existing

NETHERLINDS

CHILEAN REFUGEES IN NETHERLANDS POINTED OUT AS FUGITIVES

Lutstorial by M van lifeuwenhuysens Reformatorisch Dasblad,

butch, 19 April 1974, P 5

The Chilean refugees in the Netherlands seem to be

having adjustment problems.

These rather prolonged

symptoms

seem to be caused among other things by the fact that they

still find it hard to accept that the socialist dream of

their karxist president. is

definitely over and that their

country is now being ruled by a small

group of reactionaries

who are trying to keep the

people under control through

terrorism, repression, and torture.

Such problens will take

you quite a ways

in the letherlands and those idealists were

quick to take advantage of it.

"elfare

What is the situation? Most of the approximately

250 refugees with a high school or university education do

not work.

About half of them have been housed at the

"Huis

ter Schie" in Overschie, where they enjoy the sunshine on

the terrace or play volleyball in

the yard.

Board and

lodging are free and at the end

of the week they pick up

another 25 guilders pocket money.

In addition they receive

free language instruction, commuter tickets for the bus, and

compensation for each

trip they have to take.

idea that they are better off than

many. old people

in the letherlands?

You are probably right,

because the Chilean exiles do not have to live on welfare,

are being paid from the frozen funds which had been

allocated for development aid

to their fatherland, Chile.

So you can see how well our tax money is being spent.

Considering that this small proup of pampered exiles

is preaching revolution even here

and with a full stomach,

It may be. useful to point out a few facts.

These are facts

which are well known

in the Ministry in The lague but for

some reason never made it to the Netherlands press.

They are natives of

They came to Chile as a result of illegal and

revolutionary activities in which they had been involved in

these south and Middle American countries, the ultimate

congequences of which they did not wish to suffer.

They felt at home in Allende's Chile because Allende

His first action ag

president, after his inauguration in November 1970, was to

declare amnesty for all those who "were members of

terrorist

underground organizations," those who during the last months

of. his predecessor's regime had been charged with bank

the armed robbery of self-service stores,

the theft

of weapons from military arsenals, kidnapping, and

attempted

murder.

The fact that some of those revolutionaries received

Chilean diplomatic status was due to Allende's policy of

granting residence permits to this type of revolutionaries.

These refugees with a high

school or higher level education

seemed

to have no adjustment problems in Chile.

Ag a result

they soon found their way to important key positiong in the

government.

The fugitives didn't suffer any sleepless nights in

Chile either, because they

felt protected by a militant

This is the traditional, humanitarian dofini-

for the most part they are people who,

in their own country, could be lerally charged with crimes

which are punishable under any Judicini system.

These rofugees carried out activities in Chilo which

were againat the constitution.

As a matter of fact, they are

specialists in violence.

This in why they sought asylum

the foreign embassies

in Santlago and why there are so many

foreignors among them."

THIS PROGRAM CALLS FOR TIGHTER FEDERAL SPENDING AND FOR LIMITING

BE SOMEWHAT OVER-OPTIMISTIC, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE WORLD-WIDE ENERGY

CRISIS WILL SOON FORCE CHILE TO RAISE FUEL PRICES, THUS EXACCER-

BATING THE PROBLEM OF COMTROLLING INFLATIO!. ADHERENCE TO THE IMF

PROPOSAL HAS, HOWEVER, IMPROVEI CHILE'S CEREDIT RATING, AS HAS THE

SIGNING OF A BILATERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE WHITED STATES ON CHILE'S

1971-1972 DEBT. CHILE IS THUS IN A RELATIYELY GOOD POSITION FOR

THE OPENING OF THE PARIS CLUB TALKS IN FEBRUARY. THE MASSIVE $4

BILLION DOLLAR FOREIGN DEBT. HOWEVER, WILL CAUSE CHILE BALANCE OF

BALANCE-OF-PAYMENTS PROBLEMS FOR SOME TIME.

CIVILIAN ADVISERS TO ASSIST THE GOVERUMENT MINISTRIES.

THIS

PHENOMENON IS MOST APPARENT IN THE AREAS OF ECONOMIC POLICY AND IN

SUCH TECHNICAL FIELDS AS PUBLIC HEALTH AND HOUSING. THE ITPORTANICE

OF THE GROUP OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS HEADED BY RAUL SAEZ, FOR EXAMPLE

IS WELL KNOWN. THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH HAS AN ADVISORY BOARD

DOMINATED BY THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, WHILE THE MINISTRY OF

HOUSING'S BOARD IS LARGELY CONTROLLED BY THE ORGANIZATION REPRESENT-

ING PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION FIRIS. SIMILARLY, ALMOST EVERY MINISTRY.

AND MANY AUTONOMOUS AGENCIES HAVE PERMANENT CIVILIAN ADVISORY

BOARDS COMPOSED OF REPRESENTATIVES OF GROUPS WHOSE WELFARE IS

AFFECTED BY

THE AGENCY'S ACTIVITIES.

L2. IN ADDITION TO THESE CIVILIAN ADVISORY BOARDS, THERE ARE A

LARGE NUMBER OF "STUDY COMMISSIONS" THROUGH WHICH CIVILIANS CAN

EXERT THEIR INFLUENCE. BEST KAOUN OF THESE IS THE GROUP IN INTER-

NATIONAL LAWYERS WHICH IS DRAFTING A NEW CONSTITUTION, BUT THERE

ARE OTHER GROUPS WORKING ON A NEW MINING CODE, STUDYING THE EDUCA-

TIONAL SEYSTEM, COLLECTING INFORMATION ON UNCHAMPLOYMENT, URITING A

STATUTE FOR WORKER PARTICIPATION IN BUSINESS ENTERPRISES, AND

12: ALTHOUGH SOME CHRISTIAN DEHOCRATS HOLD INFLUENTIAL GOVERN-

MENT POSITIONS, MOST CIVILIAN ADVISERS ARE EITHER CONSERVATIVE OR

APOLITICAL. LACK OF MORE WIDESPREAD PARTICIPATION BY CHRISTIAN

LEMOCRATS MAY CREATE PROGLEMS FOR THE GOVERIMENT IN THE FUTURE.

ESFECIALLY SINCE ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTIUG WORKERS, CAMPESINOS

AND POBLADORES WHICH FORMERLY SUPPORTED EITHER THE CHRISTIAN

DEMOCRATIC PARTY (PDCS OR THE ALLENDE GOVERIMENTE ARE SO FAR

INADEQUATELY REPRESENTED ON ADVISORY COUNCILS. THE GOVERNMENT HAS

ESTABLISHED UNITS ADDRESSED TO YOUTH, WOMEN, GUILDS AND NEIGHBOR-

HOOD CIVIC GROUPS IN THE SECRETARIAT GENERAL OF GOVERNMENT, AND

HOPES THAT THESE WILL SERVE AS VEHICLES FOR GOVERNMENT-TO-PEOPLE

COMMUNICATION.

13. THE JUNTA LEADERS VIEW WITH DISTRUST ALL PDE EFFORTS TO

WIN NEU POLITICAL ADHERENTS FROM THE WORKING CLASSES WHICH FORMERLY

SUPPORTED ALLENDE'S UP COALITION AND REPORTEGLY BELIEVE THAT THE

DUCIONES DEL PODER JUDICIAL, CONTANDO CON LA ASESORIA DE LA

CONTRALORIA GENERAL DE LA REPUBLICA Y DISPONIENDO EL RECESO DEL

ADECUADO PARA

INSTAURAR LA INSTITUCIONALiDAD QUE SE REQUIERE,

LAS RESERVAS QUE ESTA POSICION DE LA JUNTA PUEDAN INSPIRAR

A CIERTOS SECTORES POLITICOS NO PUEDEN SER TAN ABSOLUTAS QUE

LLEGUEN HASTA NEGAR EL CONCURSO DE TODOS LOS CHILENOS AL ESFUERZO

DE RECONSTRUCCION DE SU PATRIA. POR EL CONTRARIO, A TRAVES

DE LA ¿UNTA, ES CHILE MISMO EL QUE JUEGA LA CARTA DEFINITIVA

PARA TRIUNFAR DEL ODIO, DE LA DESUNION, DEL DESALIENTO Y DE LA

DECADENCIA. LA LABOR IMPONE LA ACCIÓN DE TODAS LAS CAPACIDADES

Y LA COLADORACION DE TODA LA CUIDADANIA, ESPECIALMENTE DE

AGUELLOS CHILENOS QUE POR SU INDIFERENTISMO, SU INDECISION,

SU EGOISMO O SU PEREZA HAN GENERADO LAS CONDICIONES QUE PER-
