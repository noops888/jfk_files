1.

In vier of the fact that Subject dispatch presented a

possible lead to an RIS agent, it was

decided to do a unilateral

check on ISDIDCHI rather than refer the matter to liaison.

As a

result of investigations undertaken by-BIPAlà-1, the Station learned

that:

lAiS EDEnCHI

IS Listed in the Zuenos Aires police files as

Living at El Donacer 3150, kath telepnone number

5ü-31-7, and has no record o: police offences.

this individual tas born on 2 February 1918.

2.

I possible, it is resuested that Headquarters attempt to

contirm the above date of birth with the source of reference.

The

Station plans to institute a unilateral surveillance on Subject, anc

11l keep Headquarters inforced of pertinent developmants.
