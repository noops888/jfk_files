Referenca Message Number 53/BAN/CTS ((1)) of 15 November 1953.

I have the honor to report the situation (1 grUj:

A. (C val The attacks) of the Viet Cong according to

12 grU] to subply, then the Viet Cong will propagandiza by

misrepresenting the various (1 g= U] of President KENNEDY EOI

the following reasons:

[they will propagandize against]

President KENNEDY because he decided to send nore than 4000

American troops to Viet Nam, bringing the [totall number to

more than 16,000. This number of troops in combat could not

be borne further [1 g= G] because the struggle in Viet Nam

was unjustified, and it was for that reason that President

KENNEDY NaS (3 val assassinated).

Relying on this explanation, they maintain that they

are cartain to be victorious in the struggle in Viet Nam because

it is the American troops who have been fighting the war.

present my offica is studying a plan to countaract this propa-

ganda,

Vietnamesa
