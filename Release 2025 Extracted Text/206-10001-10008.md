The Eoard convened at 9:00 a.m. on December 27. * Those

Dr. Killian

suggested that Board members read the draft

report which had been furnisned to the Board on the preceding

day by Mr. McCone, the Director of Central Intelligonce, setting

of the all-source review which the Board had

requested concerning U.S. intelligence conmunity activities with

respect to the soviet military buildup in Cuba during the 6-months

preceding October 22, 1962.

The Chairman asked that Board members

make note of any comments and questions

they might wish to raise

Ior discussion during this two-day meeting.

DI. Killian saia

he ivas not sure the DCI's report had the approval of the intelli

gerice community at this point, for he understood that Mr. McCone

was at that moment reviewing

the uraft report in seattle, and 1t

was possible that some of the conclusions and ractual details

might not have yet received final approval by the agencies which

contributed to the preparation of the report (CIA, DIA, State ano

According..y,

the Chairnan noted the Importance of the

discussions which

the Board would have on the following day with

heads of the intelligence agencies.:

The Chairnan also thought

that the Board should aim for the preparation of

to the President at the close of hi's 2-day meeting.

r. Killian said that he had very recently talked to Mr.

McGeorge Bundy who hopes that the Board will take the time it need

to produce a solid report on the handling given by U.S. Intelli-

i gence agencies to the soviet military bullaup in cuna.

Mr. Bundy

assured that the President will undersiand that the Board is going

Into the subject deeply and objectively. About 10 days ago, the

Chairman related, he had received a telephone call from Mi. Bundy

who said that he had seen

an early draft of the Dol's report (from

a confidential source) and was concerned because the report ald not

get to the basic. Issues, and Mr. Bundy expressed an

taik to Mr. Mccone about this.' Dr. Killian stated that he had an

appointment to see Mr. Bundy later in the morning at which time ne

would ask Mr. Bundy to meet with the Board during the course of

Board members Baker and Land were unable to attend.

ligence on: Cuba/Communist China discussions. Mr. Murphy reiterated

his concern that our lack of information on such matters as theser

indicates the absence of an adequate intelligence capability to

keep our Government informed about developments in Cuba at the pre-

sent time and in the future.

Dr. Killian at this point reported to the Board on the con-

versation which he had just had with Mr. Bundy

According to

The President wants

an objective report from a group of citizens who have no axe to

grind,

and he is placing great store on this effort of the Board.

The Chairman said

that Mr. Bundy was obviously concerned about

the prospect that the Congress mill make inquiries into the cuba

matter. Hovever, Mr. Bundy reels there is a bare possibility that

Congressional investigators will be more hesitant to

raise hypo

hotical questions if they learn of the existence of astudy having

been made by a group such as the Board. It is Mr. Bundy's hope

that the Board will coefully consider the preparation of a sant-

tined version of the report,

but if the Board and the President feel

that this cannot be done then the Board should try to prepane a

report which could be used in executive session of a Committee of

the Congress.

Dr. Killian went on to report other matters which had been

covered in hig discussion with tr. Bundy.

He said that Mr. Bundy

had expressed concern over the failure of the DoI to accept the

suggestion that there be submitted a more adequate report than the

DOI forwarded to the Board on December 26. Mr. Bundy

noted in this connection that the doIls report assigns to policy.

The kind of concerted intelligence action which

(3) the continuation of efforts

Mr. McCone said

that he had not made such a study..

He added that in August the
