ANOTHER REASON FOR NOT DISCLOSING MY NAME HAS ARISEN. IN THE
SECOND HALF OF THE 1950'S, I WAS FOR SEVERAL YEARS THE CASE OFFICER
FOR OUR OPERATION INVOLVING FRANZ ((OLAH)), CHIEF OF THE LABOR UNION
IN AUSTRIA. AFTER HE AND THE WOODWORKERS' UNION HAD GONE INTO THE
STREETS IN 1950, ARMED WITH CLUBS, AND BEATEN BACK A RUSSIAN-LED
COMMUNIST WORKERS PUTSCH TO OVERTHROW THE AUSTRIAN GOVERNMENT, THE
VIENNA STATION TOOK UP CONTACT WITH OLAH, A FEARLESS ANTI-NAZI AND
ANTI-COMMUNIST, AND GOT HIM TO ORGANIZE PARAMILITARY GROUPS TO
HARASS THE SOVIET ARMY IF IT SHOULD ATTACK THE WESTERN (BRITISH,
FRENCH, AND USA) OCCUPATION ZONES IN AUSTRIA. HIS MEN WERE TRAINED

BY US IN OUR ZONE OF AUSTRIA AND THE NEW ORGANIZATION WAS GIVEN
RADIOS SO THEY COULD KEEP IN TOUCH WITH US AND EACH OTHER.
OUR PARAMILITARY PEOPLE PUT CACHES OF WEAPONS, AMMUNITION,
FOOD, AND UNIFORMS INTO THE GROUND IN OVER 70 PLACES IN THE U.S.
ZONE AND ELSEWHERE. OLAH'S GROUP WAS TO BE GIVEN THE LOCATION OF
THE CACHES WHEN THE RED ARMY MOVED.
RECENTLY THE US GOVERNMENT REVEALED TO THE AUSTRIAN GOVERNMENT
THE EXISTENCE OF THESE CACHES AND THE EMBASSY GAVE AUSTRIAN
OFFICIALS THE LOCATIONS OF THESE CACHES. AUSTRIAN PRESS, RADIO, AND
TV COVERAGE OF ALL THIS HAS BEEN GENERALLY FAVORABLE AND EVEN
GRATEFUL. OLAH'S INVOLVEMENT IS KNOWN FROM HIS MEMOIRS AND FROM
STATEMENTS HE MADE DURING HIS TRIAL IN THE 1960'S (HE WAS TRIED,
CONVICTED, AND SERVED ONE YEAR FOR USING A LABOR UNION SAVINGS
ACCOUNT AS SECURITY FOR A LOAN TO BUY THE KRONEN ZEITUNG, A TABLOID
WHICH NOW HAS THE LARGEST CIRCULATION IN AUSTRIA. THE TWO ΜΕΝ,
((DICHAND)) AND ((FALK)), HE CHOSE TO RUN THE PAPER, THEN TOOK IT
OVER AS THEIR PERSONAL PROPERTY, BECOMING ALMOST THE RICHEST MEN IN
AUSTRIA.
DICHAND LATER SOLD OUT TO FALK AND FOUNDED ANOTHER TABLOID.
IN ALL OUR CLANDESTINE MEETINGS WITH OLAH, HE WAS ACCOMPANIED
BY HIS TWO "SECRETARIES," JOSEF ((LAS)) AND HEINRICH ((DAURER)).
LAS WENT TO JAIL FOR THE SAME OFFENSE AS OLAH AND DAURER MAY HAVE,
TOO.
AT NO TIME WERE OUR NAMES (I WAS SUCCEEDED AS CASE OFFICER BY
PAUL VON MARX, THEN UNDER STATE COVER IN VIENNA AND NOW RETIRED IN
BERN, SWITZERLAND). I DON'T THINK OLAH KNEW OUR TRUE NAMES, BUT HE
KNEW I WAS IN THE EMBASSY.
FROM A TV SHOW THE NIGHT OF FEBRUARY 26, 1996, I LEARNED THERE
ARE AT LEAST TWO EAGER YOUNG AUSTRIAN HISTORIANS WORKING TO LEARN
ALL THE FACTS ABOUT THIS CASE. ONE HAD SHEAVES OF TOP SECRET
DOCUMENTS FROM THE STATE AND DEFENSE DEPTS. BEARING ON U.S. SCHEMES
TO RE-ARM AUSTRIA.
IF MY NAME IS REVEALED, IT WILL BE RECOGNIZED BY SEVERAL
AUSTRIAN OFFICERS I HAVE KNOWN FOR YEARS. AUSTRIAN TELEVISION CAN
SHOW SEVERAL LENGTHY INTERVIEWS WITH ME ON THE 1993 OCCASION OF THE
150TH JUBILEE OF THE VIENNA MEN'S SINGING SOCIETY, WHICH I HAVE
BELONGED TO SINCE 1972. OLAH, LAS, AND DAURER CAN ALL RECOGNIZE ME.
