with ACSI representatives the following topics worthy of recording

were discussed.

Opa Locka Refugee Referral Procedures.

Naj.

Vatlington made the point that in accordance with the

agreetents which had been reached between ACSI and

KURAl, local procedures were to be agreed upon in

order that ACSI might obtain refugee referrals frou

Opa Locka which could be used as a basis upon which to

count OB collection operations.

Maj. Watlington under-

scored the point that ACSI had no interest or charter

to run other than OB collection operations.

could minimizo the poseibilities for duplication

of offort and/or wiro crossing.

This concept was readily

accoptod by Maj. Watlington.

It did not, however,

strike

a totally responsive chord in Lt. Col. Causoß.

This was

noted but in order to proceed with preliminary arrange-

monts, REUTENAN put forth the proposal that ACSI register

a, list of tront requirements with Opa Locia and that this

•list could then be used as a basis upon which refugee

screenings could be conducted.

It was suggested that Col.

Kail would be the logical

point of reference in Opa Locka

through which the referral system could be managed. In

"this connection it was pointed out that once Col. Kail

identified an individual whom he considered to be pri-

marily. of ACSI interest, he could arrange for this indi-

vidual to be roferred to Lt. Col. Causes' covert unit.

At the same time Col. Kail would make arrangements to pass

to KUBARK representatives at Opa Locka and to Station

JMWAVE a copy of the Opa Locka debriefing of the individual

who had been referred to ACSI.

Upon receipt of this in-

formation KUBARK representatives at Opa Locka and at

Station JIWAVE would review the referral.

If this review

revealed that the individual was not of

operational

interest to JIWAVE and his primary access was not in fields

whether we would reconmend the reuse of Cuesta by ACSI.

It. Col. Causes stared that he felt that he had

ostabliched his equity in Ordonez through the name

trace procoduro.

Despite this,

he had found that

Ordonez had disappeared from circulation; and, there-

fore, he assuned that we were debriefing this man.

Third Country Diplomats.

REUTENAN asked the

ACSI representatives whether they were currently in

couch with any third country diplonats.

Liaj• Watlington

otated thatlACSI had previously tried to harness the24

capabilities of the Spanish, Uruguayan and Canadian

diplomatic pouches. Coordination of these activities

WIth KUBARK had resulted in ACSI's being denied the use

of these facilities.

a result Maj. Watlington stated

that at the present time ACsi was not in touch with any

third country, dipionats.

On the other hand, ACSI was

interested in pursuing the third country diplomatic

channel is a means of

establishing communications with

inside assets.

At this point It. Col. Causes stated

that he was very disappointed at KUBARK'S refusal to

allow him to use the facilities of the Spanish,

Uruguayan 24

or Canadian pouches!

It was indicated that KUBARK under-

stood I: Col. Causes' reaction; however, the KUBARK

positio was based on gound security principles and

could not be altered.

The additional explanations which

were made relative to the security implications which

were inherent in the use of third country diplomats and

how misuse could affect long standing government to

government or service to service agreements between

ODYOKE and free world countries did not make any impact

on Lt. Col. Causes. This gentlenan was predisposed to

Interpret KUBARK's refusal to allow him to use certain

24 diplomatie pouch channels as a clear indication that

one-or KUER-s prinary responsibilities in the lian

orea was to restrict and inhibit ACSI operational activity.

Once this attitude was identified no further attempts

made to persuade it. Col. Causes that our actions had

been taken in the best interests of the intelligenco

community.

Hardtime infiltration of ACSI Arents. A dis-

cuscion of those support

services which Kellar might

render to ACY operations revealed that It. Col. Causes

was stil interested in having JIWAVE infiltrato two of

his agChtS intO PBRUMEN.

In this connection the point

was nado by AC3I that under optinum circumstances they

would profer that JIWAVE assume responsibility for the

agents in the lioni area and then deliver then through

secure mechanism to Mavana.

if this were not possible

ACSi would reluciantly accept infiltration of their agents

into any point in PBRUMEN.

Li. Col.

Causes was toid in

very precice terng that JuWAVE would not undertale to

infiltrate any of his agents into Ravana.

On the other

hand,

ve rould consider any proposal for the infiltration

of selected agents to a beach area in PBRULEN.

The point

was made thai in this connection It. Col. Causes had to

understand that our maritime capabilities were liaitod

and ve were currently committed to the full esploitation

of these assets for at least six weeks in advance.

AB a

rosult any operational plan which he might subait to us

should be loyed to the assumption that approximately 51g

to eight veeks would pass before we could realistically

consider the corvicing of his request.

Lt. Col. Causes

agreed to project his operational plans within this frame

..of reference.

h. " Coordination Forms.

The discussion of opora-

tional coordination revealed that ACSI was willing for

JLWAVE to coordinate locally those operational proposals

which might be received from ht. Col. Causes.

coordination vas effected and if there were disagreoment,

then the operation could be referred to the Washington

headquarters of both ACSI and JuVAVE.

Maj. Hatlington

stated that the forms for effecting coordination 1p ac-

cordance with procedures which had been agreed upon at

Washington would be sent to both JMWAVE and the ACSI unit

in Miami in the near future. In view of this Maj.

Watlington suggested that we not initiate the coordination

mechanism until these forms were on hand circa l July 1962.

W/T Assets.

The discussion of the use of W/T

factlities in terms

of PBRUMEN operations revealed that

the Miami ACSI unit

did not have any "/T assets in

PERUMEN at this time.

On the other hand, Lt. Col. Causes

was interested in establishing W/i assets in PBRUMEN.

view of This he asked if JMWAVE would continue to assess,

polygraph and train those individuals that ACSI thought

wore suitable W/T candidates.

It was indicated that we

were cortainly prepared to review all appropriate cases

and would render whatever support was required.

This then

resulted in a discussion of whether JuwAVE would be willing

to monitor ACSI V/T transmissions from PBRUKEN In those

instances where the W/T operator had not been assessed,

polygraphed or trainod by KUBARk.

We indicated that we

would be clad to moniter such transmissions if we were

told in advance of the date, time

and frequencies on which

the broadcasts were to be nade.

This then led to a dis-

cussion of whether JwAVE would be willing to tranonit

noggages for ACsi agonts.

Here again, we stated that

we would lavorably congider any requests for C/ trans-

missions providing that we knew the content of the nessage,

the identity of the agent who was to receive it, and the

agent's location and equipment which he might be using.

Lt. Col. Causes siatod that in view of this discussion

could anticipato

that he would be levying requirenents on

us in the near future for support in the W/T field.

JIWAVE would then issue the

At the conclusion of the above discussion arrange-

nonts wore made for lunch, but Lt.

Col. Causes chose not to partici-

nate in the luncheon session.

During the luncheon conversation

BaJ. Watlington indicated that he did not believe that It. Col.

Causes would cooperate within the spirit of the dcId'e.

As a result

he colod that JIVAVE be extremely patient with ACSI until such time

as Lt. Col. Causes retired and could be replaced. Maj. Watlington

indicatod that the retironent was scheduled to take place. at the

end of Soptember 1962.

At the end of the luncheon session ar-

rangomonts were made for VENTONS to take MaJ. Watlington on a -

tous of Opa Locka.

Based on this tour additional discussions

toro to be hold with Maj. Watlingion particularly in regard to

tho development of procedures for referral of agents to ACSI

from the Opa Locka flow.

OPA LOCKA.

Maj. Watlington and JENTONS subsequently

went out to the Interrogation center at Opa Locka.

Here they

had an interview with Col. Kail, the tenor of which was, on the

part of Maj. Watlington,

to assure himself that the ACSI repre-

sentative, Francast, vas having adequate access to operational

Col. Kail said that operational leads were shared ac-

cording to their abilities between the KUBARK representative and

the, ACSI man.

However, there were occasional difficulties in

that the men best qualified received the body in question.

In addition, he said KUBARK occasionally pulled a man out of the

Center without his completing

the full treatment which precluded

the ACSI representative's getting his hands on someone who might

be well qualified for their operations.

Maj. Watlington believed

that assurance that the ACSI representative

got a fair deal

night be achieved

through a more complete briefing of Col.

Trudencio Ulibarr't, who is in charge of the preliminary screening

so that he would more fully understand what was needed.

said that this would be a very good idea, but that it would be

1f it vere a dual briefing with a

KUBARK representative

being present as well.

Maj. Watlington said that he would ask

his headquarters for permission to have such a briefing given.

Col. Kail expressed his opinion that the assignment of JENIONS

to formal liaison with the ACSI representatives would do nuch to

elininate present difficulties and all present echoed this pious

AGREEMENT.

When JENTONS turned Maj. Watlington over to

the two ACSI

Li. Col. Causes after the meeting at Opa Lockafor the tine being,

representatives said that they believed that,

ic would be better to

continue the system as at present, pending

JENTONS permanent arrival at the beginning of July 1962.

Col. Causos is obviously skeptical about the outcome, this was

agreed to as a stopgap measure.
