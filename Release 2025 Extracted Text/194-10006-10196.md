Vietnam Day Committee (VDC).

The VDC solicited and received

financial support and/or assistance from the Communist Party (CP), Socialist Workers

Party (SWP), Progressive Labor Party (PLP), and the Berkeley Chapter of the W.E.B.

DuBois Clubs of America (DCA). The CP and the SWP have been cited by the Attorney

General of the United States; the PLP is organized, controlled, and dominated by a

factionalist group of dissident Communists who broke away from the CP because they

did not believe it was moving fast enough in accomplishing its revolutionary goals;

and the DCA is supported, controlled and dominated by the CP. (Tabs B, pp3, 4 and 5;

b. In 1966 HE was associated with the United Committee Against the War

which is dominated by the SWP and the Young Socialist Alliance, the youth group of

the SWP. (Tabs Q; R and S)

In 1964 HE was an associate and instructor of the San Francisco New

School (SFNS). The SFNS was formulated by a radical group to criticize existing

structures and policies and was the forerunner in the west coast area of the

Students for a Democratic Society, a militant youth

group that has received support

from the CP. (Tabs A; C, pp 21 and 22; L; M; N)
