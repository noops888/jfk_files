"THAT HE HAD CONFESSED TO SOME DIFFICULTY IN CONTAINING HIMSELF.

IN THIS MATTER, COS REPLIED THAT AS A PERSONAL OPINION HE SOMEWHAT

REGRETTED

THAT MR, WONPAT. DID NOT EXPRESS HIMSELF ON THIS ISSUE

SINCE WE HAD TAKEN SOME PAINS TU LET OUR INDONESIAN COUNTERPARTS

KNOW THAT WE WERE NOT HAPPY AT THIS GRATUITOUS REBUFF. IT WAS

ALSO PUINTED OUT THAT STATION HAD MADE SURE THIS ISSUE WAS BROUGHT

BEFORE ACTING ON ANY SUCH ISSUE AGAIN. WE ALSO NOTED THAT

PRESIDENT SUHARTO HAD BEEN DEEPLY UPSET AT THE INDONESIAN UN

DELEGATION VUTE ON THIS ISSUE AND HAD MADE HIS DISPLEASURE KNOWN

TO THE FOREIGN OFFICE.

3, DURING THE COURSE OF THE YOGA BRIEFING, SEVERAL OF THE

CONGRESSMEN HAD RAISED THE ISSUE OF PUBLIC STUTEMENTS OF PRESIDENT

MARCOS AND "THE KING OF THAILAND" DEMANDING THE REMOVAL OF U.S.

MILITARY BASES FROM THEIR COUNTRIES. YOGA HAD RESPONDED THAT

THESE STATEMENTS

WERE FOR DOMESTIC POLITICAL CONSUMPTION AND DID

NOT REPRESENT THE TRUE POLITICAL BELIEFS OF THE THAI AND PHILIPPINE

LEADERSHIP, AS YOGA PUT IT, THESE WERE POLITICAL STATEMENTS AND

NOT STATEMENTS OF POLICY, BOTH CONGRESSMEN FELT THAT THIS ANSWER

REPRESENTED HIGH DEGREE OF POLITICAL NAIVETE SINCE SUCH PUBLIC

STATEMENTS WERE HEADLINED IN THE U.S, AND NATURALLY AFFECTED

CONGRESS, CONGRESSMAN WILSON COMMENTED THAT IT WAS EXTREMELY

DIFFICULT TU FIGHT FOR MILITARY ASSISTANCE FOR THESE COUNTRIES

WHEN THEY WERE TELLING THE WORLD THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT IT. HE

ADDED THAT THAT GOES FOR THE GUAM RESOLUTION ALSO, HE ASKED FOR

COS'S RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHETHER TO KEEP QUIET ON THIS OR LET

HIS FEELINGS BE KNOWN.. COS SUGGESTED THAT HE MIGHT WISH TO.

CONGRESSMEN TO LET THEIR FEELINGS BE KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT.

COS ADDED THAT HE HAD FREQUENTLY TOLD HIS INDONESIAN COUNTERPARTS

THAT IT DID NO GOOD FOR ASIAN LEADERS TO SAY PRIVATELY: THAT THEY

DIDN'T REALLY MEAN WHAT THEY DID SAY PUBLICLY SINCE THE PUBLIC

STATEMENTS WERE ON THE RECORD AND THE PRIVATE ONES WERE NOT.

4, THESE GENTLEMEN ARE HARD BITTEN, PROFESSIONAL POLITICIANS.

GENERALLY THEY APPEARED TO FAVOR A CONTINUING ROLE FUR THE U.S.

IN ASIAN AFFAIRS, INCLUDING CONTINUING MILITARY ASSISTANCE • THEY

ARE, HOWEVER, DEEPLY SUSPICIOUS OF ASIAN LEADERS, THEIR WILL AND

ABILITY TO SURVIVE AGAINST DETERMINED COMMUNIST SUBVERSION, AND

THEIR PERSONAL INTEGRITY, CONGRESSMAN WILSON RECOUNTED THAT HE

HAD BEEN PRESENT WHEN SUKARNO ADDRESSED A JOINT SESSION OF THE

CONGRESS AND WAS HAILED AS A GREAT NATIONALIST LEADER. HE ADDED.

"LOOK AT WHAT THAT (EXPLETIVE DELETED) DID TO USI". THEY EXPRESSED

VERY LITTLE UF THEIR UPINIONS CUNCERNING THE AGENCY, ALTHOUGH

BOTH SEEMED TO ATTEMPT TO ELICIT STATEMENTS FROM COS CRITICAL

EXCELLENT TECHNICAL COLLECTION PROGRAMS IN PHOTOGRAPHY AND ELECTRONIC

UNFORTUNATELY, INTELLIGENCE ON WHAT HE IS THINKING AND PLANNING

WOULD COME LARGELY FROM HUMAN SOURCES, AND GIVEN THE CLOSED

NATURE OF HIS SOCIETY AND HIS STRICT AND EFFECTIVE SECURITY

MEASURES, IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO COLLECT THIS KIND OF

INFORMATION.

THE PREPONDERANCE OF REQUIREMENTS FOR HUMAN SOURCE CLANDESTINE

INTELLIGENCE FALL WITHIN THE PROPER PURVIEW OF THE CENTRAL

INTELLIGENCE AGENCY: AND THAT AGENCY IS UNIQUELY QUALIFIED

TO PERFORM THIS VITAL FUNCTION. AT THE SAME TIME, THERE IS A NEED

FOR A CAREFULLY MANAGED. LIMITED MILITARY EFFORT TO FOCUS ON

STRICTLY MILITARY REQUIREMENTS. A PRIMARY MILITARY TARGET OF THIS

IN THE AREA OF ELECTRONIC INTELLIGENCE WE HAVE REQUESTED A HIGH:

ALTITUDE PLATFORM TO BE OPERATED OVER THE SOUTH KOREAN LAND MASS

TO GIVE US A DEEPER AND MORE EFFECTIVE LOOK INTO THE ENEMY'S

ELECTRONIC ENVIRONMENT. THE REQUESTEN SYSTEM INCLUDES A DOWN LINK

CAPABILITY WHICH WOULD GIVE US A NEAR REAL TIME READ OUT OF DATA

COLLECTED. OUR PROPUSAL HAS RECEIVED STRONG SUPPORT FROM DIA AND

NSA. WE ALSO HAVE HIGH INTEREST IN INSURING THAT WE WILL HAVE DOWN

LINK ACCESS TO NATIONALLY MANAGED OVERHEAD PHOTOGRAPHY SYSTEMS,

WHICH ARE NOT YET OPERATIONAL.

WE ARE AWARE OF THE COSTS INVOLVED IN FIELDING MODERN COLLECTION

SYSTEMS AND THE UPGRADING OF CURRENT ONES, NONETHELESS, GENERAL

HOLLINGSWORTH AND I SHARE THE VIEW THAT, GIVEN OUR MISSION AND OUR

PROXIMITY TO POTENTIAL BELLIGERENT, WE MUST HAVE THE BEST

INTELLIGENCE AVAILABLE. I AM SURE THAT YOUR TRIP TO KOREA GAVE

YOU A FEEL FOR THE SENSE OF URGENCY THAT WE LIVE WITH HERE.

AND WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE YOUR COLLEAGUES.

AND WE WILL REPORT ANY PLAYBACK WE GET. HE ASKED WHETHER

IN COS'S JUDGMENT IT WOULD DE AN IMPROVEMENT ON PRESENT

WITH OUR AMBASSADORS OF ALL INTELLIGENCE AND ACTION OPERATIONS.

COS REPLIED THAT IF ALL THE AMBASSADORS WERE AS ABLE AND AS

BASIS FOR MAKING INFORMED JUDGMENTS, AND THE RESULT, THEREFORE.

OF SUCH A RULE MIGHT BE TO SERIOUSLY INHIBIT AND PREVENT MANY

OPERATIONS THAT SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN.

SUBJECT: Guidelines for Members of the Select Committee and

Their Staffs While Traveling Abroad

There have been already and there will continue to be members

of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) who wish to travel abroad and

talk to U.S. embassy and intelligence personnel. It is essential

that we agree on guidelines to avoid serious diplomatic and security

problems. The following specific guidelines are applicable.

I. : MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE SSC SHOULD NOT PUBLICLY APPEAR TO BE

ABROAD. FOR THE PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATING U.S. INTELLIGENCE

INSTALLATIONS•

Most of these installations, including all CIA stations abroad,

for example, are under some form of cover, or are maintaining a low

profile. Certainly all have and need varying degrees of protection

from exposure. At one extreme are U.S. intelligence activities

behind the iron curtain. These clearly need maximum protection.

•The mere visit of SSC representatives could be noted as evidence

of U.S, intelligence presence within the country. Even in those

countries where U.S. intelligence efforts enjoy the shielding and

other benefits flowing from close liaison with the host government,

care is required to avoid the potentially grave political repercussions

4/25/95

---

## Page 167

13-00000

2

that could result to U.S. and host country activities from exposure

of such liaison. Many countries that wish to cooperate with the

United States in intelligence endeavors simply cannot afford public:

exposure of such relationships. To help maintain the discreet

nature of the visit, it would be preferable if some reason

other

than SSC business could be given to explain any visits by SSC members

and staff. No deliberate contact should be made with the local press,

nor should comments on SSC matters be supplied if Investigating

officers are contacted by the press. Local press publicity pertaining

to an SSC investigation abroad would in almost all cases

be

distasteful to the host government.

In sum, except in the case of especially sensitive areas, discreet

arrangements can be made for SSC visits to certain U-S. intelligence

activitiès overseas on a case by case basis, and with senior officers

within the covering embassies. Such visits are contingent upon the

SSC member not publicly declaring himself to be on SSC business

at the time of the visit or upon his return, and his proceeding

on a basis satisfactory to the Ambassador.

II. THE AMBASSADOR AT THE EMBASSY VISITED WILL BE IN CHARGE OF THE

VISIT.

All arrangenents. and contacts will be made by hiw, and because of his

knowledge of local situations, his advice will be binding.

---

## Page 168

13-00000

III. FIELD DISCUSSIONS WITH U.S. INTELLIGENCE PERSONNEL SHOULD BE

CONDUCTED ONLY IN GENERAL TERMS.

It is more fitting that Washington be the place where operational

details are conveyed to the SSC. Field intelligence elements will

only discuss operations in general terms--operational priorities,

the kinds of operations conducted, the operational environment,

relationships with the Embassy and defense attaches, etc. In all

cases, such discussions will only be conducted in physical

surroundings which meet appropriate security standards.

Members and staff of the SSC should refrain from asking to

see texts of or general notes on intelligence agreements between

the U.S. and the host government. These are usually considered

by the host government as extremely sensitive, politically and

operationally,. and cannot be divulged without the consent of the

host government.

IV:

MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE SSC WILL NOT INTERVIEW AGENT

• PERSONNEL.

Foreign agent personnel frequently are under hostile or local service

scrutiny. For them to be placed in touch with SSC members would be

to run an unacceptable risk. Moreover, serious damage would be

done to agent morale and motivation if their identity were to be .

revealed to Members or staff of the SSC.

---

## Page 169

13-00000

V.

MEMBERS OF HOST COUNTRY INTELLIGENCE OR SECURITY SERVICES

WILL: BE CONTACTED ONLY IN EXCEPTIONAL CASES.

Many foreign intelligence services will find contact with the SSC

politically difficult and will avoid it. They further regard that

their relationships with U.S. intelligence activities, the

Information they pass, and the cooperation extended are all most

sensitive matters. Regardless what assurances are given them,

they would find it difficult and awkward to discuss these matters

with menbers or staff of the SSC. The very fact that such matters

were under investigation could well cause the host service to

reassess the desirability of a relationship with U.S. Intelligence

activities.

VI. MEMBERS AND STAFE OF THE SSC SHOULD NOT VISIT FOREIGN

TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE INSTALLATIONS.

In those countries in which we operate joint technical collection

sites, the host would be firmly opposed to access by U.S.

Congressional representatives, especially where there is public

knowledge of the Congressional Investigating interests. 'If such

a visit is considered essential, a special request must be

negotiated with the host country in advance.

---

## Page 170

VII. AN ORIENTATION BRIEFING WILL BE PROVIDED ALL MEMBERS AND

STAFF, PRIOR TO DEPARTURE.

This briefing will be conducted. by the DCI and other representatives

of the Intelligence Community (CIA, NSA, DIA, State, etc.), as

appropriate. The purpose of this briefing is to familiarize the

visitor with the types of activities conducted at each location,

the restraints which are imposed upon U.S. activities in each case

and the considerations which preclude the discussion of

operational details, names and terms in an overseas environment;

Members and staff of the SSC should bear in mind at all times that

they and their activities are matters of great interest to opposition

Intelligence services, as well as to the press. Comnittee and staff

members, particularly those who are publicly prominent, can hardly

travel inconspiciously and will be easily recognized.

Dear Mr. Bolten:

This letter is to confirm an oral request by Comnittee staff

for an orientation briefing for a visit to South America which two

members of the staff, David Aaron and William Trueheart, have been

asked to make next month.

Although plans are not yet firn, it is expected that they will

be free to travel during the second and third weeks of September.

It is proposed that they visit Brasilia, Rio de Janeiro, and

Montevideo. If time permits; they might also visit another con-

sular post in Brazil and/or Buenos Aires.

The primary purpose of this travel is to discuss State-CIA

relations in the field with Embassy and Station officers. As ap-.

propriate, past Agency programs may also be reviewed.

Messrs. Aaron and Trueheart are not expected to consult with

officials of the host government and, so far as the Committee is

concerned, the latter need not be informed of the visit.

Sincerely yours,

Bell

Summary of Covert Action Operations Targeted at

1. Pursuant to your request, forwarded as attachment A 1s a paper

providing examples of covert action operations targeted at right-wing

governments, which is responsive to a question from the Senate Select

Committee.

2. All of the cases in the attached sunmary are considered sensitive

by the area divisions and some are considered extremely sensitive up to

today. In many ways public disclosure of some of these operations could

impact more severely on our foreign policy interest than the other dis-

closures on our foreign involvements.

For example, a disclosure of our

past operations in Spain could possibly adversely affect the military

base negotiations now underway.

With this problem in mind, we have

broken the operations into two categories:

Category I are those oper-

ations about which full committee could be briefed, if necessary, and

Category Il are those operations considered extremely sensitive about

which the committee Chairman and Co-Chairman might be briefed, if abso-

lutely necessary.

3. In addition to the attachment A summary, we also approve the use

(with the full committee) of the case summary on our operations to assist

operations

the survival of the Betancourt government in Venezuela, which was pro-

vided to you directly by LA Division.

4. Obviously, we would prefer to forego providing this information

to the committee.

However, should it be necessary to do so, we would

appreciate being advised promptly regarding the time and circumstances

of any use of this material outside of the Agency.

movement was first approved for FY 1965. The purpose of the support

was to encourage the development of the labor movement as a democratic

force and as one of the few mass representative organizations in Ethiopia.

to the government succeeded in dissuading the President from military

action against Belize.

HAITI: As early as 1963, the Special Group discussed ways and

means of influencing the Duvalier dictatorship. In 1967, a modest pro-

ject was approved for the support of Haitian exile radio broadcasts for

the purpose of offsetting "the inflammatory propaganda broadcasts to

DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: In 1963, CIA was directly involved in the

successful efforts to prevent the return to the Dominican Republic of

General Elias Wessin y Wessin and forestall his leadership of a right-

6. GERMANY: From 1948 to 1960, CIA exploited an asset in a neo-

Nazi political movement both as a source of intelligence concerning its

plans and actions and as a means of covertly sabotaging the movement

and its European counterparts.

1. SOUTH AFRICA: In 1959, after consultation with the Special

Group, the DCI approved an overall expenditure of $165,000 to a leading

South African political figure designed to encourage the creation of a

new political party. This party was established in 1960. The objective

was to influence the liberalization of the South African Government by

having a legally constituted party in opposition to apartheid. The

activity was terminated in 1962.

2. SOUTH AFRICA: A project was initiated in 1962 to encourage

the development of a multiracial trade union organization which opposed

apartheid. It was funded through a European philanthropic organization.

State Department approval was received in June 1963. A total of $311,705

was spent on this activity. The project was terminated in 1968.

3. KOREA: In 1963, the Special Group approved a covert action

project designed to encourage "emerging civilian government"' vis-a-vis

the military leadership following President Rhee's resignation and in

anticipation of forthcoming elections; it proposed to support a group.

of National Assembly members.

• 4. KOREA: The Special Group approved in 1967 a project designed

to support a private, rural self-help organization to encourage more

participation by rural farmers in local and national politics to increase

their influence on the Government of the Republic of Korea; it involved

the creation of agricultural training centers in rural villages, a news-

letter and student rural services. It was terminated in 1970 as a project,

but the movement has been continued under the auspices of the government.

5. ARGENTINA: Between 1950 and 1955, efforts of the CIA were

directed at countering Peron's program to obtain wide support in Latin

America for his Movement of Latin American Trade Unionists (ATLAS) which

was designed as one element of his campaign to expand his influence in

the area. Partially as the result of CIA's efforts, the movement never

caught on and it was abandoned with Peron's ouster from power.

6. BRAZIL: From the early 1960's through the ouster of Goulart

and the assumption of power by the conservative Brazilian military, to

1972, ClA supported a rural cooperative movement in the impoverished

Northeast.

This support was provided in spite of strong opposition to

the movement first by the Goulart government and then by Brazilian.

after 1974 on liaison and diplomatic relations if this support by the USG

were discovered. The project was terminated in 1972.

SPAIN: In 1963, the Special Group approved a program to train

15-20 Spanish democratic labor leaders a year outside of Spain to build

an effective cadre of Spanish labor leadership. In 1966, the Special

Group approved a modest program designed to strengthen the Christian

Democratic movement in Spain through supportive efforts with youth,

Director should be informed of the potentially embarrassing

procedural errors in the presentation and review of this

project before the 303 Committee, and the risks of exposure

to two former assets who have been jailed by the new Ethiopian

regime.

3.

The Ethiopian labor program was undertaken

without 303 Committee knowledge or approval.

Subsequently,

196 Project was presented to the 303 Committee on 22 August

and Mr. Walt Rostow, then Chairman of the Security Council,

asked why it had not been brought before the Committee before.

le was told that for projects costing $20,000 or less, it had

been the DCI's discretion to determine if a given project was

sufficiently politically sensitive to warrant bringing it

before the committee.

Mr. Rostow directed

that the 303

Committee should examine all political action projects.

Nevertheless, the project was not submitted to the Committee

for review in 1968, 1969 or 1973.

4.

In addition to these procedural errors, the arrest

in 1974 and continued detention of two Ethiopian labor leaders

An admission now of CIA support to Ethiopian labor or to the

two Ethiopian labor leaders in jail could be a sentence of

death for them.

In the case of South Africa, CIA support to a leading

South African political figure to encourage the creation of a

The South African labor officials and

organizations which received funds from FES were not aware

that the actual origin of the funds was the United States

Government and presumably do not now know of U.S. Government

Aside from exposing a U.S. Government

involvement where none is known to have existed, FES was used

to support a number of other covert action operations in Africa

and elsewhere and exposure of the foundation would have

ramifications other than in south Africa.

The Director should

be briefed on FES and its range of activities on behalf of CIA

REFERENCE

: Covert Action Operations Against

Right Wing Governments

: Chief, SS/CAG Memorandum, dated

18 July 1975

Subject: "Summary of Covert Action

Operations Against Right Wing Governments"

1. DA Division is concerned about Reference and its possible

use in briefing the Senate Select Committee. Specifically, our concern

centers on describing the EA operations contained in the attachment to

Reference as "were mounted against" "right wing governments"..

None of the EA operations -- DNSCOOP, DNSPROUT (both of which

took place in Korea) and TUMIX (which took place in Vietnam) -:

were or should be so described as being mounted against the government

then in power. In fact, just the opposite is true.

All of these

operations, while covert in the sense that the U.S. Government hand

was never disclosed, were primarily designed to broaden the base of

the governments in power and enhance its stayability by providing

advice and support to "grass root elements" in an attempt to get these

elements to function as a more cohesive organization in seeking

participation in the governmental process.

2. While all of the operations have been terminated, the

INSCOOP operation is perhaps the most sensitive of the three, in that

it represented an initial effort by the Agency to establish contact with

opposition elements in South Korea. As noted above, the purpose of

this contact was not to overthrow the ruling government but rather to

assist the opposition in establishing itself as a more viable force in its

effort to establish a two-party system in South Korea. The Agency today

maintains contact with the major opposition leaders in South Korea

and this contact is well known to and approved by the U.S. Ambassador

in Korea as well as the Assistant Secretary for East Asia and Pacific

Affairs, Department of State.

3. We see no real value to be gained if any of these operations

were to be raised with the Senate Select Committee.

SUBJECT:

Guidelines for Members of the Select

Committee and Their Staffs While

Traveling Abroad

There have been already and there will continue to

be members of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) who

wish to travel abroad and be in conversation with our

Stations.

It is important that we agree on guidelines

to avoid serious security problems from arising.

The

following specific guidelines are considered important:

Members of the SSC and members of its staff

should not publicly appear to be abroad for

purposes of investigating ClA installations.

CIA Stations abroad,

all of which are under

one extreme are Stations behind the iron

curtain or in other particularly sensitive

areas which need maximum protection. At

the other extreme are Stations which enjoy

close liaison with the host government and

are thus less sensitive.

In the first case,

strict cover conditions

in sensitive environments, the very presence of

SSC members could be highly provocative by

flaunting the fact of CIA's presence. But

even in countries in which we enjoy a good

liaison with the host country's security

service, there remains a need to be discreet.

Many countries whose services want to be

cooperative with CIA cannot afford public or

parliamentary exposure of the relationship.

Local press publicity pertaining to an SSC

investigation abroad would in almost all

cases be distastefull to a host government.

- 2 -

In sum, except in the case of very sensitive

areas,

discreet arrangements can be arranged

for SSC visits

to CIA's overseas stations and

with senior officers within the covering Embassy

provided the SSC member does not publicly declare

himself to be on SSC business and maintains his

Station

contacts on a discreet basis.

Members of the SSC and their staff should not

question Station personnel on specaste operational

It is more fitting that Washington be the

place where operational details are conveyed to

the SSC.

It is at Headquarters where the guide-

lines are best understood, where the most complete

and authentic records are

kept (many Stations

finding themselves in dangerous crisis situations,

have periodically destroyed their files).

There

is no reason, however, that Station Chiefs should

not discuss

operations in general terms -- opera-

tional

priorities, the kinds of operations, the

operational environment, relationships with the

Embassy, the service attaches, etc.

Members of the SSC and their staff should not

interview agent personnel.

Foreign agent

personnel frequently are under hostile or

local service scrutiny.

For them to be placed

in touch with SSC members would be to run an

unacceptable risk.

Moreover, serious damage

could be done to agent morale and motivation

if they were to think their role had been

revealed to members of Congress.

Members of the SSC and their staff should not

in most cases be in contact with members of

lost country's intelligence or security services

Many services will find contact with the SSC

politically difficult and will avoid it.

They

further regard that their relationships with ClA,

the information they pass us and the sort of

cooperation extended as a most sensitive matter.

No matter what

assurances are given them,

they would find it difficult and awkward

to

discuss these matters with the SSC or its

staft, and the very tact that such matters

were under investigation could well cause

them

to reassess the desirability of a

relationship with CIA or other U.S.

intelligence agencies.

Exceptions

can

perhaps be made in special cases.

Members of the SSC and their staff should

not visit foreign technical intelligence

installations.

Again there may be exceptions

to this which can be arranged, but in most

countries in which we operate joint technical

opposed to access

the host service would be

opposed to access by Congressional representatives.

MEMORANDUM FOR:

SUBJECT

Director of Central Intelligence

Senator Gary Hart's Request to Talk

to QJWIN While Traveling in Europe

This is for your information concerning Senator Gary

Hart's request to talk to a former agent while the senator

is traveling in Europe..

The agent is QJWIN.. He was first approached in 1958

through the head of the Luxembourg intelligence service.

At first he was used mainly to spot potential agents in

various European countries.

Later he became the major

asset under ZRRIFLE:

In this capacity he made a brief

visit to the Congo, but took no actions.

On the weekend of 7 June 1975, members of the Senate

Select Committee staff spent many hours at Headquarters

reading files, including QJWIN and ZRRIFLE, among others.

QJWIN's true name contract is in the file which they read.

So is a street and post office address as of 1964, the

time when we ended our contract with this agent.

We have

not contacted him since.

We have heard that David Aaron of the Senate Select

Committee staff telephoned QJWIN.

This report remains

unconfirmed.

We have protested to Bill Miller.

It is difficult to imagine how a U.S. senator could

talk to a former agent without arousing the interest of

the local intelligence service (probably Luxembourg) and

of the host government who might wonder about the propriety

of investigations being conducted on their territory and

involving one of their citizens.

In any event, an approach of this nature would be

of interest to the Department of State, and the senator

might wish to consult with the Department before proceeding.

Talking Points For Use With Senator Gary Hart On His Proposed

Contact With QJWYN

1..

Senatorial contact with a former CIA agent would run the

risk of his exposure to his local government and the press.

Because of his former activities and relationships he

might be subjected to reprisals from abroad, possible

prosecution for espionage at home from his local govern-

ment and harassment from the media.

2.

Active as well as former CIA agents abroad would have

further cause to believe that the American intelligence

service is incapable of protecting its informants from dis-

closure. Contacting an agent under the insecure conditions

involved would violate the Agency's promise to this former

informant to protect the confidentiality of the relationship.

3.

Foreign intelligence services with which the CIA is in

liaison would find this approach highly unprofessional

and risky. It is bound to raise further questions about

the dangers of continued confidential cooperation with

the CIA.

4.

It is possible that the local government involved might

lodge a formal protest to the US mission protesting the

unusual procedure of a Senate investigating committee

interrogating its nationals in violation of its sovereignty

without requesting formal permission.

HEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

This is for your information concerning Senator Gary

Hart's request to talk to a former agent of ours while

traveling in Europe.

You should know that we have been told that tha

Senate Select Committee staff has airsady been in touch

with this agent by telaphone.

We do not know hon they

learned his true name or his whereabouts.

We have already

advised Davia Aaron of the Senate Select Cormittee staff

of a potential problen area in connection with such a

proposed neeting.

The agent in question is, of course,

a subject of interast to the local intelligence service

and we doubt that the host government or the intelligence

service would agree that a United States senator, especially

a member of the Senate Select Committee, may appropriately

conduct such investigations within its territory without

clearance to do so.

In any event, an approach of this nature would ba

of interest and indeed of concern to the Department of

State and the senator might be well advised to consult

with them before proceeding.

For your information, the agant referred to is

QJwIN and we have not been in touch with hin since about

1951.

SUBJECT:

GUIDELINES FOR MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE AND

THEIR STAFFS WHILE TRAVELING ABROAD

There have been already and there will continue to be members

of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) who wish to travel abroad and

talk to U.S. embassy and intelligence personnel. It is essential

that we agree on guidelines to avoid serious diplomatic and security

problems. The following specific guidelines are applicable.

I. MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE SSC SHOULD NOT PUBLICLY APPEAR TO BE

ABROAD FOR THE PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATING U.S. INTELLIGENCE

INSTALLATIONS.

Most of these installations, including all CIA stations

abroad,

for example, are under some form of cover, or are maintaining

a low profile. Certainly all have and need varying degrees of

protection from exposure. At one extreme are U.S. intelligence

activities behind the iron curtain. These clearly need maximum

protection. Ther mere visit of SSC representatives could be

noted as evidence of U.S. intelligence presence within the

country. Even in those countries where U.S. intelligence

efforts enjoy the shielding and other benefits flowing from

close liaison with the host government, care is required to

avoid the potentially grave political repercussions that

25. June- latest version, incorporating

proposed changes by DoD.

---

## Page 204

13-00000

2

could result to U.S. and host country activities from exposure

of such liaison.

Several foreign governments or entities thereof

now willing to cooperate privately with the U.S. in intelligence

agreements-exchanges maintain strong neutral or anti-U.S. foreign

policies; continuation of such agreements-exchanges is therefore

dependent upon avoidance of their public disclosure. In many

cases termination of such agreements would result in the loss

of unique strategic intelligence, and alternate collection

methods are either not available or are prohibitively expensive.

To help maintain the discreet nature of the visit, it would be

preferable if some reason other than SSC business could be

given to explain any visits by SSC members and staff. No

deliberate contact should be made with the local press, nor

should comments on SSC matters be supplied if investigating

officers are contacted by the press. Local press publicity

pertaining to an SSC investigation abroad would in almost all

cases be distasteful to the host government.

In sum, except in the case of especially sensitive areas,.

discreet arrangements

; can be made for SSC visits to certain U.S.

intelligence activities overseas on a case by case basis, and with

senior officers within the covering embassies. Such visits are

contingent upon the SSC member not publicly declaring himself

to be on SSC business at the time of the visit or upon his

return, and his proceeding on a basis satisfactory to the Ambassador.

---

## Page 205

13-00000

II.

THE AMBASSADOR AT THE EMBASSY VISITED WILL BE IN CHARGE

OF THE VISIT.

All arrangements and contacts will be made by him, and because

of his knowledge of local situations, his advice will be binding.

TA 22.

HII. FIELD DISCUSSIONS WITH U.S. INTELLIGENCE PERSONNEL SHOULD BE

CONDUCTED ONLY IN GENERAL TERMS.

It is more fitting that Washington be the place where operational

details are conveyed to the SSC. Field intelligence elements

will only discuss operations in general terms--operational

priorities, the kinds of operations conducted, the operational

enviromment, relationships with the Embassy and defense attaches,

etc. In all cases, such discussions will only be conducted in

physical surroundings which meet appropriate security standards.

Members and staff of the SSC should refrain from asking to

see texts of or general notes on intelligence agreements between

the U.S. and the host government. These are usually considered

by the host government as extremely sensitive, politically and

operationally, and cannot be divulged without the consent of

the host government.

IV.

MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE SSC WILL NOT INTERVIEW AGENT PERSONNEL.

Foreign agent personnel frequently are under hostile or local

service scrutiny. For them to be placed in touch with SSC members

would be to run an unacceptable risk. Moreover, serious

damage would be done to agent morale and motivation if their

identity were to be revealed to Members or staff of the SSC.

MEMBERS OF HOST COUNTRY INTELLIGENCE OR SECURITY SERVICES

WILL, BE CONTACTED ONLY IN EXCEPTIONAL. CASES.

Many foreign intelligence services will find contact with the

SSC politically difficult and will avoid it. They further regard

that their relationships with U.S. intelligence activities, the

information they pass, and

the cooperation extended are all most

sensitive matters. Regardless what assurances are given them,

they would find it difficult and awkward to discuss these matters

with members or staff of the SSC. The very fact that such matters

were under investigation could well cause the host service to

reassess the desirability of a relationship with U.S. intelligence

activities.

MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE SSC SHOULD NOT VISIT FOREIGN TECHNICAL

INTELLIGENCE INSTALLATIONS.

In those countries in which we operate joint technical collection

sites, the host would be firmly opposed to access by U.S.

Congressional representatives, especially where there is public

knowledge of the Congressional investigating interests. If such

---

## Page 207

13-00000

a visit is considered essential, a special request must be

negotiated with the host country in advance.

Senate Select. Committee principals and staff should

understand the distinction between U.S. intelligence

installations abroad and joint U.S.-foreign intelligence

installations or foreign intelligence installations supported

by the U.S. intelligence community. Access to the former

is at the discretion of the U.S. Ambassador; access to the

latter two

is at the discretion of the foreign government

involved.

VII. AN ORIENTATION BRIEFING WILL BE PROVIDED ALL MEMBERS AND STAFF,

PRIOR TO DEPARTURE.

This briefing will be conducted by the DCI and other representa..

tives of the Intelligence Comnunity (CIA, NSA, DIA, State, etc.),

as appropriate.

The purpose of this briefing is to familiarize

the visitor with the types of activities conducted at each

location, the restraints which are imposed upon U.s. activities

in each case and the considerations which preclude the discussion

of

operational details, names and terms in an overseas environment.

- Members

and staff of the SSC should bear in mind at all times that

they and their activities are matters of great interest to öpposition

intelligence services, as well as to the press. Committee and staff

members, particularly those who are publicly prominent, can hardly

travel inconspiciously and will be easily recognized.

DATE AND PLACE:

17 June 1975 1000 - 1100

Room 2E-45

SUBJECT:

Conversation by Mr. John waller, SA/Do with

Mr. David Aaron, member of Senator Mondale's

staff, with Regard to the Senator's Proposed

Trip to Europe

1.

According to Mr. Aaron the Senator and Mr. Aaron's itinerary,

while not yet fixed, will be along the following lines:

a. 30 June - 1 July: London

b. Monday, 7 June: Vienna, for one day

c. Paris and Bonn. Although the order has not yet been

determined, the Bonn stop would be two days and the

Paris stop, one day.

In the period between London and Vienna, the party intends to visit

Oslo and Helsinki. The purpose of this part of the trip, however,

has nothing to do

with the SSC and the party does not want or need

Station contact.

2. Mr. Aaron agrees that in discussions with Stations, the

party should not get into specific operational cases.

They want to

discuss "more generic" subjects: operational priorities, relations

with the imbassy robest scene dated is commend and controions,

command and control"

It had occurred to Aaron that Vienna would be a good example of a

Station which concentrates on "East - West" operations (read third

country, Sov and Sov Bloc operations).

He recognized London was a

liaison

station.

Mondale, however, was anxious to talk to Cord Meyer..

- 2 -

Paris, he felt, would provide some understanding of "third world"

operations.

Bonn, he felt, would be a good example of the inter-

relations of a CIA Station with the Military and the Foreign Service.

3.

Mr. Aaron stated that he had already sought out Mr. Simon

of the British Embassy, requesting that contacts be arranged in

London with the appropriate Foreign Office or Intelligence Offices

in order to discuss the British experiences in "command and control".

Aaron is also interested in how the British Official Secrets Act

works.

He had heard that it was proving inadequate.

Mr. Aaron

stated that Simon had not been enthusiastic about the idea but

promised to look into it. Aaron felt that it had been better to

work directly with Simon, whom he claimed to know, than to involve

the Agency's go-between.

4. Mr. Aaron intended to make a similar approach to the German

Embassy.

S. Mr. waller commented that such approaches to foreigr

governments would make our liaison services uneasy and could

adversely affect their willingness to cooperate.

To this reason,

we did not favor involving foreign governments -- at whatever

level or wherever in the bureaucracy.

Moreover, contacts with

foreign governments increased the likelihood that the true purpose

of the Senator's trip could leak to the press.

Mr. Waller mentioned

that he would want to bring this to the attention of others.

6. Mr. Aaron agreed that the Senator, through press conferences

or otherwise, would not make public the fact that his trip was

connected with Select Committee investigations.

7. Mr. Aaron said that he and the Senator were in touch with

Mr. Hyland of the State Department with regard to this trip.

He

also suggested that they might get in touch with military intelligence

He made specific reference

to "Naval Intelligence"

8.

Mr. Aaron stressed the fact that the itinerary was still

tentative and subject to change.

9. At one point, Mr. Aaron asked if CIA had any aircraft

in Europe which

could be put at Senator Mondale's disposal.

Mr. Waller replied negatively.

Mr. Aaron felt that it was unlikely that Mr. Bader

would be a member of the Senator's party.

In sum, except in the case of very sensitive

areas,

discreet arrangements can be arranged

for SSC visits to CIA's overseas stations and

with senior officers within the covering Embassy

provided the SSC member does not publicly declare

himself to be on SSC business and maintains his

Station

contacts on a discreet basis.

Members of the SSC and their staff should not

question Station personnel on specific operational

detail. It is more fitting that Washington be the

place where operational details are conveyed to

the SSC.

It is at Headquarters where the guide-

lines are best understood, where the most complete

and authentic records are

kept (many Stations

finding themselves in dangerous crisis situations,

have periodically destroyed their files).

There

is no reason, however, that Station Chiefs should

not discuss

operations in general terms -- opera-

tional priorities, the kinds of operations, the

operational environment, relationships with the

Embassy, the service attaches, etc.

Members of the SSC and their staff should not

interview agent personnel.

Foreign agent

personnel frequently are under hostile or

local service scrutiny. For them to be placed

in touch with SSC members would be to run an

unacceptable risk.

Moreover, serious

CIA Stations abroad,

all of which are under

some form of cover, have and need varying

degrees of protection from exposure.

At

are Stations behind the iron

curtain or in other particularly sensitive

areas which need maximum protection. At

the other extreme are Stations which enjoy

close liaison with the host government and

are thus less sensitive.

In the first case,

Stations existing under strict cover conditions

in sensitive environments, the very presence oI

SoC members could be highly provocative by

flaunting the fact of CIA's presence. But

even in countries in which we enjoy a good

liaison with the host country's security

service, there remains a need to be discreet.

Many countries whose services want to be

cooperative with ClA cannot afford public or

parliamentary exposure of the relationship.

Local press publicity pertaining to an SSC

investigation abroad would in almost all

cases be distastefull to a host government.

SUBJECT:

Guidelines for Members of the Select Committee and

Their Staffs While Traveling Abroad

There have been already and there will continue to be members

of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) who wish to travel abroad and

talk to U.S. embassy and intelligence personnel. It is essential that

we agree on guidelines to avoid serious diplomatic and security problems.

The following specific guidelines are applicable.

I.

MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE SSC SHOULD PUBLICLY APPEAR

TO BE ABROAD FOR SOME PURPOSE OTHER THAN THE

INVESTIGATION OF U.S. INTELLIGENCE INSTALLATIONS.

Most of these installations, including all CIA stations abroad, for

example; are under some form of cover, or are maintaining a low

profile. Certainly all have and need varying degrees of protection

from exposure. At one extreme are U.S. intelligence activities

behind the iron curtain.

These clearly need maximum protection.

The mere visit of SSC representatives could be noted as evidence

, of U.S. intelligence presence within the country.

Even in those

countries where U.S. intelligence efforts enjoy the shielding and

other benefits flowing from close liaison with the host government,

care is required to avoid the potentially grave political repercussions

---

## Page 225

13-00000

that could result to U.S. and host country activities from exposure

of such liaison. Many countries that wish to cooperate with the

United States in intelligence endeavors simply cannot afford pablic

exposure of such relationships. Some reason other than SSC business

should be given to explain any visits by SSC members and staff to

help maintain the discreet nature of the visit. No deliberate contact

should be made with the local press, nor should comments on SSC

matters be supplied if investigating officers are contacted by the

press. Local press publicity pertaining to an SSC investigation abroad

would in almost all cases be distasteful to the host government.

In sum, except in the case of especially sensitive areas, discreet

arrangements can be made for SSC visits to certain U.S. intelligence

activities overseas on a case by case basis, and with senior officers

within the covering embassies. Such visits are contingent upon the

SSC member not publicly declaring himself to be on SSC business.

at the time of the visit or upon his return, and his proceeding on a

basis satisfactory to the Ambassador.

II. THE AMBASSADOR AT THE EMBASSY VISITED WILL BE IN CHARGE

OF THE VISIT.

All arrangements and contacts will be made by him, and because

• of his

knowledge of local situations, his advice will be binding.

I. FIELD DISCUSSIONS WITH U.S. INTELLIGENCE PERSONNEL

SHOULD BE CONDUCTED ONLY IN GENERAL TERMS.

It is more fitting that Washington be the place where operational

details are conveyed to the SSC. Field intelligence elements will

only discuss operations in general terms -- operational priorities;

the kinds of operations conducted, the operational environment,

relationships with the Embassy and defense attaches, etc. In all

cases, such discussions will only be conducted in physical surroundings

which meet appropriate security standards.

Members and staff of the SSC should refrain from asking to

see texts of, or general notes on intelligence agreements between the

U.S. and the host government. These are usually considered by the

host government as extremely sensitive, politically and operationally,

and cannot be divulged without the consent of the host government.

::=..

IV. MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE SSC WILL NOT INTERVIEW AGENT

PERSONNEL.

Foreign agent personnel frequently are under hostile or local service

scrutiny. For them to be placed in touch with SSC members would be

to run an unacceptable risk. Moreover,

serious damage would be

done to agent morale and motivation if their identity were to be

revealed to Members or staff of the SSC.

V .

MEMBERS OF HOST COUNTRY INTELLIGENCE OR SECURITY

SERVICES WILL BE CONTACIED ONLY IN EXCEPTIONAI CASES.

Many foreign intelligence services will find contact with the SSC

politically difficult and will avoid it. They further regard that their

relationships with U.S. intelligence activities, the information they

pass, and the cooperation extended are all most sensitive matters.

Regardless what assurances are given them, they would find it

difficult and awkward to discuss these matters with members or

staff of the SSC. The very fact that such matters were under investigation

*.*.

could well cause the host service to reassess the desirability of a

relationship with U.S. intelligence activities.

VI, MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE SSC SHOULD NOT VISIT FOREIGN

TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE INSTALLATIONS.

In those countries in which we operate joint technical collection sites,

the host would be firmly opposed to access by U.S. Congressional

representatives, especially where there is public knowledge of the

Congressional investigating interests. If such a visit is considered

---

## Page 228

13-00000

essential, a special request must be negotiated with the host country

in advance.

VII. AN ORIENTATION BRIEFING WILL BE PROVIDED ALL MEMBERS

AND STAFE, PRIOR TO DEPARTURE.

This briefing will be conducted by the DCI and other representatives

of the Intelligence Community (CIA, NSA, DIA, State, etc.), as

appropriate. The purpose of this briefing is to familiarize the

visitor with the types of activities conducted at each location, the

restraints which are imposed upon U.S. activities in each case and

the considerations which preclude the discussion of operational details,

names and terms in an overseas environment.

Members and staff of the SSC should bear in mind at all times that

they and their activities are matters of great interest to opposition

intelligence services, as well as to the press. Committee and staff

members, particularly those who are publicly prominent, can hardly

travel inconspiciously and will be easily recognized.
