38.

The incident of the killing of the United States President

KENNEDY caused great indignation and grief in Finland.

A sort

of period of national mourning was established in Helsinki with

flags lowered to half-mast everywhere. On the 25th of the

month in the city of 13 gr G/Ml, a Mass was arranged in which the

President of the Republic will aiso participate.

All means of

publication are discussing the exceptional personality of KENNEDY

and his service to humanity and peace.

The press, taking up the personality of i. JOHNSCN who

ascended to the presidency unexpectedly, wrote that the afore-

mentioned in his yourh was a proteg√© of

ROCSEVELT and went so

Auscralia and New Zealand as his special representative during.

the war; that he was one of those who defended the (1 grU] at

the time. The press added that, although he has great influence

especially in internal politics and in the party, his

experience in the matter of foreign policy expanded by his trips

after 1961; that following the Moscow agreement, he made a

statement to the effect that he saw the possibility of nuclear-free

zones [1 gr Mj created; that, however, he supported the idea

that the cold war will continue; and that in 1959 KHRUSHCHEV

As was submitted during his visit to Helsinki several months

ago, the impression which he

left as a statesman [1 gr G] is

negative.

Some of the opinions expressed in official and political

circles are as follows: the incident of the death of the presi-

dent is of a nature to alter conditions of domestic policy;

in spite of the certainty of KENNEDY's Democratic Party candidacy

in the future elections, now the party will be the scene of a

great dispute; however, from the

struggle between the [1 gr U]

and liberal wings of the [1 gr G] party, it can be expected that

NIXON will be the victor.

The primary point which these circles (1 gr Ul upon is

that the incident of the sudden withdrawal from the scene of

KENNEDY whose perscnality was forcefully felt on east-west

(B val relations) which are taking a favorable dizection despite

the (1 gr G] deviations racently, (1 g= G; destructive reactions

on these relations.
