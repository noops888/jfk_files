For WINIEWICZ

Our Nr. 482ª point 3. Everything points to the continuation of the internal

struggle lB val based on the political interpretation of KENNEDY's assassi-

nation.

Immediately after the attempt, the initial commentaries linked it

with the racist movement, which assumed the offensive by rallying themselves

around the efforts of the Texas police in order to saddle OSWALD, a reputed pro

CASTRO activist who two years ago wanted to remain in the USSR, with the

responsibility for the attempt.

The arrest of Cubans was begun in Dallas.

GOLDWATER, who yesterday refused to comment on the assassination, joined the

campaign.

Radio and television suspended all their programs and -- with minor

exceptions which included ABC directed among others by the former EISENHOWER

press agent HAGHERTY - taking advantage of this background to bring about anti-

communist hysteria.

The fact that Saturday through Monday are days free of

work facilitates reaching the community.

Today's declaration by JOHNSON and the Department of State denying the

existence of reputed facts of a conspiracy against KENNEDY's life involving

the USSR and Cuba has as its aim the restraint of the campaign of extreme

racists, which can create difficulty in overcoming the internal situation and

could paralyze the foreign policy of Washington.

Probably in reply to these declarations circulated among the American

press (among others in the UN) is the theme that the KENNEDY murder could have

been inspired by those centers in the USSR which do not want a detente. This

theme is also being linked with the attempt to arrest BARGHOORN, the downing

of the Iranian aircraft, and Berlin access roads.

It is anticipated that immediately after the funeral personal intrigue will

begin. Speculation of RUSK's resignation are being repeated (possible succes-

sors, FULBRIGHT or HARRIMAN If JOHNSON is determined to continue the present

relations with the USSR and BUNDY or perhaps someone comparable but thus far

an unknown politician if he decides to lead the Democratic party to the

elections on a wave of hardfast foreign policy).
