1. Pursuant tò the verbal statonents of Donnis K.. COPELAND at the Lima Confor-

the followlag suggestions are advanced for Hoadquartors! consideration.

a) Covor for Chile, Offlolal:

The dir Attache, Col. William ROSS, talked at length with General ACKERMAN,

Assistant A-2, AFGS, while attending the Panama servico Attache Conference,

on tha question of providing a replacement for the Air Officor sho bad

originally been scheduled for Santiago Air Attache Office to handlo ZACACTUS.

ROSS, who 1s a vory intolligent, capable officer, with oxcellent intolli-

conco experionce, told ACKARMAN that ho would appreciato boing considered

for this assignment in addition to his regular duties, as he was leanly

Interested in this typo of endeavor. He was of the opinion that no could

datoto as largo a sharo of his time to this work as would any other officer

so assigned to his offico.

Furthermore, due to the sire of his staff,

threo officors, he felt he could assigo the bulk of his Air dutioa to his

assistants and concentrate his offorts on ZACACTUS matters,

which he thought

vero of gréater importanco in Chile.- General ACKERMAN, socording to ROSS;

was not adrerse to this proposal but stated he would await contaot from

ZACACTUS Headjuarters before considering the nattor further.

This Station has high ragerd for ROSS and is of the opinion that ho rould

apply himsolf in a very diligent and intelligent minner to the duties of

handling ZACACTUS in Chilo. Ho 1s fully aware of the necessity for discre

tion, as he had been briöfed on thie at the time the former ZACACTUS candl-

date had beèn considered for the Air Attache Offico.

Tho Communist influonce In Chile is' unquestionably a serious politioal factor,.

and their propaganda is growing steadily throughout the country with extremoly

Isttlo if any opposition. The present Communist drive torards nationalization

of the copper induatry is gaining adherents daily and should be considered a

potentially serious matter from the standpoint of our reliance on Chilean.

Thus,

it is the riow of this Station that PW work is important 1n

Chilo and that its initiation on a larger sonle should. not ba unduly delayod.

It 1s

also belloved that considerable time, offort and money would be saved by

utilizing tho talent now 1a chile, such as ROSS and FULMINATER-I, who already

If Hoadquarters Is interested, it should approach General

ACKERMAN direct in A=2. Regarding FULMINATER-1, a

vory tentative approach

has been made to sound him out, and he reacted very favorably although no
