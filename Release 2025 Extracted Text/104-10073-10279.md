leadership superstructure lies a paltry base of only several

hundred BEREIREN "rank-and-file" supporters, nostly young

Organizationally, BOLLIREN has no formal

precisely sensurzble... However, the base support for EEHEIREN

operate with certain front activities in Japan controlled by

the JCP, most notably the Japan Committee to Investigate War

Crimes in Vietnam activitles, which culminated in

Court of last August, but has been soundly and rudely rebuffed

by the JCh. In spite of this, BEHEIREN has churned along at

1ts own pace, with & continuing sertes of anti-Vietnan var

actions, most of then related in some way to the American

pacifist novement.

In this regard, BEFIREN has succeeded in

cornering a virtual monopoly on Japanese contacts with the J.S.

pecifist movements, and has effectually capitalized on this to

promote its own action program.. The case of the four deserting

sailors, while an apparent lucky windfall for BelsIREN, only

points up the fact that BELCIREN, through past organizational

work and promotional activities, was "johnny-on-the-spot",

ready and capable (unique in Japan in this regard) to take

the ball and

run with 1t. BELEIREN Ian all the way in this

case and scored its most notable success since lt was organized.

B. The Case of the Four Sailor Deserters and BEHEIREN.

1. How It Started: The consensus of all avallable overt

medis material,

with

no recorded dissent, indicates that the

four sailors voluntarily left their ship, went AlOl, and ended

up wallowing around Tokyo's hippio-land. Precisely what personal

grievances prompted the four to embark on this mis-raventure is

not yet known.

But, up to this polat, the four could fairly be

categorized as misguided joungsters, gone astray in i foreign

land, and due to get slapped back in line with traditional

Navy justica when they finally decided to stop the fan and go

back to the ship... So far, this made their cases lar frou

unique.:

Turo - What were the motives for these four seanen's desertion?

Professor; The desertion was completely the decision of these four

persons. It seems that the four seamen decided not to return to the ship,

when the Intrepid entered Yokosuka Port on October. 17', and they were per-

au mitted to go ashore for rest for

one week. My impression.on meeting these

ct.self-advertisement.or that they were giving false reasons.

Ij: four seamen was that they were definitely not deserting fo"I am convinced

that they deserted really. out of doubt about the Vietnam war.

What were the movements of the four, after they deserted?

Professor;: On the night of the 23rd, two days before the Intrepid

was due

to sail, the four went to shinjuku, and told the people whom they

net at ä bar they happened to visit, that "we are fed up with wai."

The

Japanese who heard them sympathized with them, and.at one time, the four

lived with sone hippies (according 'to this paper's investigations; they

include Mr. K., a student of Tokyo University's Liberal Arts Department,

and vanguard artist A., who gather at Fugetsudo in Shinjuku.) Finally,

they were taken to Beheiren by a student who spoke English (according to

this paper's investigation, this was Mr. S" cannot say where they were

a Waseda University student).

After that, they were hidden by Beheiren.

- Were the four firmly determined to desert? read

Professor:: My purpose in visiting Japan was to dissuade the: four.

I explained to. them

what the results of their desertion would be.

I even

c told them that they would never again be permitted to stand on American soil;

win their fatherland. At the time I met them, it was still at a stage where

aris they would only receive light punishment, if they reported back immediately,

In saying that they "had missed their ship."

However, their determination was

Wfirm, and my persuasion had no effects.

i: Bicast:

- The four seamen's desertion was announced in the form of a press;

interview given by Beheiren, Here there no facts of their having been

forced to desert, during that period? purs si

Professor; I ascertained that point, too. However, they firnly denied

many fact of their having. been forced, saying that they had voluntarily

Falconsulted Beheiren as to whether they should publicly announce the Press

intention to desert, and if so, in what form this should be made.

- Where are the four sealen. now, and where are they planning to go?

Professor: I am certain that the four of them were still in Japan,

up until the lith, the day I left for home.. However, they already knew

fully well that it was not possible for them to obtain asylum in Japan.

They even said that "we will probably have to go to sone third nation,

which is neutral." (The public security authorities judge that the four

seamen left Japan immediately after Mr. YOUNG's persuasion, and consider that

toi. they probadly were smuggled out of japan after the loth, and before the

bec evening of the 13th, when

Beheiren announced their desertion at a press

conference, However, Mr. YOUNG says that the four seamen were in Japan up

Tos until the sight of the llth. Therefore, the possibility is strong that they

Sawere smuggled out of Japan by ship, between the night of the lith and the

Don evening. of the 13th.)..:

-The films showing the four beanen were shown publicly in the u.s.,

-bra:too.: What, were the reactions in the U.s.?:

Pasti

professor: When the films were publicly shown, theze was big: excitement,

with rows and rows of television and press cameramen. I thought I wowld be

exposed to persistent questioning by the FBI and the CIA, after I returned

tyr home, but so far, I have only baen, questioned buce by the Navy's Intelligence

Section, about the circumstances._ It, seems that American authorities con-

wur cerned do not want to make too big a fuss over the matter.
