LEAST AS FAR AS GOV IS CONCERNED, CAP AND GOVERNMENT SPOKESMEN

HAVE ALL STATED THAT INCIDENT HAS ENDED AND ARE NOW TRYING TO

DIVERT ATTENTION TO OTHER SUBJECTS. MEDIA COVERAGE

IS RETURNING

TO NORMAL WITH STORIES OUT OF HEADLINES AND BACK ON PAGE SIX OR

EIGHT, SUPERSEDED BY NIEHOUS CASE, UGANDAN SITUATION, OPEC PRICE

HIKE, ETC, UNFORTUNATELY, EVERY. VENEZUELAN WEEKLY MAGAZINE HAS

• LONG ARTICLE (S) ON CIA WHICH ARE, OF COURSE, DEFAMATORY, AND

TEND TO WHIP UP PUBLIC ANTIPATHY TOWARDS AGENCY, THEN TOO, THERE

IS STILL MATTER OF DEMONSTRATION AGAINST CIA WHICH TWO DAYS AGO

CAP SEEMED TO BE INSTIGATING IN TWO MEETINGS WITH JOSE VICENTE

RANGEL AND POMPEYO MARQUEZ OF MAS AND JESUS

IN LAST COUPLE OF DAYS STATION CASE OFFICERS HAVE ENCOUNTERED

WHAT CERTAINLY APPEARED TO BE SURVEILLANCES. WKIDET-3 REPORTS

THAT LAST WEEK CUBAN AMBASSADOR HERNANDEZ VISITED CAP AND PROVIDED

HIM. A LIST OF ALL CIA PERSONNEL AND AGENTS THE CUBANS KNOW TO

BE OPERATING IN VENEZUELA, SO, AS CAN BE SEEN BY ALL OF THIS,

THE RELATIVELY EASY OPERATING CONDITIONS OF THE RECENT PAST NO

LONGER PERTAIN- PERHAPS THEY NEVER WILL AGAIN- ÄND WHILE WE ARE

NOT BECOMING PARANOID NOR WILL WE BE UNDULY SPOOKED, WE HAVE

ADJUSTED TO THE NEW AMBIENTE AND ARE NOW BEING MUCH MORE

•CONSERVATIVE AND CAUTIOUS IN OUR ACTIVITIES THAN BEFORE.
