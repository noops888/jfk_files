Mr. Halley.

Yes, I am.

Mr. Baron. Are you appearing here, voluntarily here today

without coungel?

MI. Malley. Yes, I am.

MI. Baron. Are you also aware that at any point you are

entitled to cuase answering any questions and consult with

MI. Baron. Finally, are you aware that all your constitu-

tional rights are intact before the Committee here today,

•including your Fifth Amendment

rights to remain silent?

MI. Halley. Yes, I am.

Mr. Baron. I think we should put into the record the

arrangement that we made before we began, and correct me if this

your transcript is true to the best of your knowledge at some

point as soon as

session.

MI. Halley.

Yes. The statement that you have just made

is my understanding of the agreement that we entered into prior

to this conversation going on the record.

MI. Baron. Thank you.

Let us: begin then with some veryibroad questiong. •...

about your background in the Agency. Can you tell me what you

were doing in the Agency prior to your involvement with tha

IMWAVE station?

Mr. Halley. I became involved with the Cuban affair in

approximately February of 1962. At that time, I was in Head-

quarters. I was Chief of Foreign Intelligence Activities for the

Eastern European Division. I was asked to be released from those

duties to conduct a survey of the opportunitles for running

intelligence operations against Cuba.

I was released from those

duties; I did engage in

a survey of the possibilities for runnin

intelligence, counterintelligence, paramilitary operations

against Cuba.

MI. Baron. Your position as Chief of Foreign Intelligence

for Eastern Europe did not involve Cuba in any way? That was

your last position before you became involved in Cuban affairs,

is that correct?

MI. Halley. That is correct.

I want to qualify that. Undoubtadly, there were some

actions that were being

conducted in the Fastern European area

that reflected on Cuba, but I was not Involved in the Bay of Pigs

operation. I was not fully focused on Cuban operations until

approximately February of 1962.

MI. Baron. At what point. did you join the Agency?

Mr. Hallay. I joined the Agency originally in 1951.

MI. Baron. In a very general way, can you describe the

nature of your activities at the Agency prior to February of '62?

Mr. Halley. When I was first assigned to the Agency, I was

an Army officer on active duty. I went through the usual Agency

training program. I was assigned to Eastern European activities

where I originally was focused on Polish and German operations.

I subsequently served from 1952 to 1959 in Germany.:. In the

course of that service, I spent most of my time working on the

Eastern European satellites, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary,

Romania, Bulgaria. In addition, I was involved on occasion in

Soviet operations

and East German operations.

Mr. Baron. Did you have any involvement in Latin American

affairs prior to February of '62?

MI. Halley. Yes. In the period 1960-62; I. was responsible

for setting up operational activity in Latin America that

was targetted more axplicitly on the Fastern European gatellitesi

to some extent on the Soviet Union. This was in a perlod of time

where the Eastern European satellites were expanding their

presence in Latin America. In My duties in the Eastern European

nivision, I was responsible for gettino this ningram voing in

Latin America, so I did have an extensive axposure to Latin

America: in the period '60 to '62, as I recall those dates.

The accuracy of those dates can he checked from my official

travel records, and so on.

MI. Baron. During that period of time you were actually

in Latin America helping to set up this program?

MI. Halley. No, I was stationed in Washington, but I

travelled to Latin America during this particular period of

time.

MI. Baron. Did you travel to Cuba at any point during the

course of that operation?

Mr. Halley.

Not specifically. I think I transitted Cuba

on air stops being routed to various countries. I think I was

at one or two Cuban airfields, but simply in transit.

MI. Baron.

Not long enough even to talk to the people at

• the Station in Cuba?

Mr. Halley. No, I had no contact at any time with the

Havana Station.

Mr. Baron. Did you pick up, during this period of time,

a general sense of the attitude of Latin American governments

toward the Castro government? Could you characterize that

attitudu, if you dia?

MI. Halley. I certainly was aware, I think, of the broad

political trend in the Hemisphere at that time, my interest was

much more narrowly focused at that time on the Eastern European

targets, and on the Soviet target, and I was not certainly

specializing In Cuban affairs at that juncture.

Mr. Baron. Cuba was not viewed at that juncture as part of

the Soviet target, as a Soviet satellite?

Mr. Halley. No, it was not.

MI. Baron. Coming

then to February of '62, ls that the

point at which you joined the JMWAVE Station in Miami?

Mr. Halley. No. When I first entered into this survey,

It was to do this on a TDY basis, temporary duty assignment;

to complete a report on my findings, to report those at that

particular juncture to Mr. Harvey who was the head of the Task

Force that was

attempting to expand intelligence coverage of

Cuba and I was not assigned to the station at that particular

point in time.

MI. Baron. At what point did you join the JMWAVE Station?

Mr. Halley. Shortly after having completed this survey.

These dates are blurred now because the survey soon turned into

a permanent assignment.

I would have to check the exact dates

from my service records, but after having completed the survey

report, shortly thereafter I was

asked to go to Miami to become

permanently assigned to the station in Miami. I do not recall

the exact date at which that parmanent change of station took

place.

Mr. Baron. Would you assume that that was sometime before

the end of May of '62?

Mr. Halley. Yes. It was probably before that, but as I

say, thare are a couple of weeks gap that we would have to 100k

at my service record to get the exact dates, but certainly it

could have been March, it could have been April: But I reserve,

you know, the right to check my record if that is a critical

point in terms of what you are trying to astablish.

Mr. Baron. Certainly.

I should

say generally at this point, if anything we cover

today gives you that kind of problem it would be immensely

helpful to us if you would check your answers against documents

that might be available in the CIA.

MI. Hallay. Yes, all right.

MI. Baron. In fact, let me ask you if you would check that

one out, because it would be useful to know exactly when you

joined the JMWAVE station.

During the period

of time before you joined IMWAVE, while

you were conducting the survey, did you report to anyone other

than William Harvey?

Mr. Halley. In a formal sense, this TDY was conducted on

behalf of the task force commander, who was Mr. Harvey. While

I was in Miami conducting the survey, I obviously discussed

matters pertaining to that survey to the toam who was then in

charge of the operational activity in Miami. That team was

essentially headed by Mr. Al Cox,. who has since died.

MI. Baron. Was that team the equivalent of IMWAVE station?

MI. Halley. Yes. Mr. Cox was the head, then, of what would

be the equivalent of the IMWAVE station.

• Mr. Baron.

Was he the head of JMwAVE until the point when

you replaced him, or until the point. you became Chief of the

JMWAVE Station?

Mr. Halley. That is correct.. He was the head of that

unit until such time as I replaced him.

Mr. Baron. Were you aware during this survey that you

were conducting of any link between Task Force W and the so-called

Special Group in the White House which was part of the National

Security Council

structure and used the project namer! MONGOOSE

for anti-Cuban operations?

MI. Halley. My understanding at the time that I conducted

this survey was that there was a three-man group in existence

which was headed by Mr. Robert Kennedy that was conducting a

survey to see what kind of activities could be conducted

against

Cuba. The other members of that particular group were General

Lansdale and Mr. Helms.

This three-man group had subordinate to it for all practical

purposes the task force

unit which was managed by Mr. Harvey.

I am not familiar, however, with the other terminology that you

used, that is Project MONGOOSE, or whatever you said. I do not

know the exact words you usad. I am not familiar with that

terminology.

Mr Baron... During the whole period of your involvement

with JMWAVE, you were not made aware of Project MONGOOSE as

such?

MI. Halley. I am not aware of Project MONGOSE. I do not

recall it as an acronym, cryptonym or anything else that was in

common usage in my conversations.

Also, you have to understand that during that particular

time, Mr. Harvey was subordinate to the normal Agency chain of

command. In other words, he had parallel lines, if you will.

There was this three-man Task Force to whom he was reporting

regularly. At the same time, as the Task Force Commander, he

was reporting to the then-DDP who was Mr. Helms.

Mr Baron. You began your survey just about the time that

Mr. Helms replaced Mr. Bissell as DDP?

Mr. Halley. That is right.

MI. Baron. Were you aware of the command relationship

between the three-man

group that you have mentioned and william

Harvey as head of Task Force l?

Did that group task Harvey

directly, or did Harvey's assignments have to come through Helms

and through the DCI as opposed to this group that did not include

the DCI?

Mr. Halley. My understanding of it at the time was we were

really talking about parallel lines. In other words, this

three-man group was meeting. Mr. Helms was both a member of

that particular group and the DDP. Therefore, when he came back

one of these meetings and issued instructions to Mr. Harvey,

it was, you know, tantamount to these things coming through two

channels simultaneously, one coming from this three-man task

force and the other instruction simultaneously coming from Mr.

Helms who was the DoP.

Mr. Baron. As far as Mi. Harvey was concerned, an assign-

ment or order from Richard Helms :was an order to be taken' at

face value? Harvey did not have to question whether it had the

stamp of approval from the DCI or not? Would that have been

your operating understanding?

Mr. Halley. That would have been my understanding, yes.

Certainly an instruction received from Mr. Helms was a valid

Agency instruction.

Mr. Baron. The DCI at this point was John McCone.

Mr. Hallay. That is correct.

MI. Baron. Do you have any knowledge of the relationship

• batween this three-man group and John McCone at that point?

MI. Halley. Not on a day to day basis. Once I went to

Miami, I came back on a regular basis to review operational

plans and programs. On ore occasion I accompanied Mr. McCone

to the white louse to give a presentation or sit in while the

presentation was being made.

Mr. Baron. Where was this? What was the forum in which

the presentation was made.

Mr. Halley.

This was a meeting with President Kennedy and

other members of the then-Cabinet were present at that particular

meating.

Mr. Baron. Was that a Cabinet meeting or was it a Special

Group meeting as a sub-unit of the National Security Council?

Mr. Halley. You know, that happened in 1962. This 1s

1975. I do not recall then with precision as to whether it was

a meeting of the Cabinet or whether:it was a meeting of the

National Security Council, or whether it was a meeting of the

Special Group.

MI. Baron. That: is perfectly understandable. Do you recall

which Cabinet members were present at that meeting?

Mr. Halley. Yes.. My recollection of that was that Mr.

McNamara was present, Mr. Rusk was present, MI. Kennedy, the

Attorney General, was present. You know, I am just vague now

at this particular point. Those are the ones that stick out in

my memory as being present.

Mr. Baron. Was the DCI present?

Mr. Halley. Yes, the DCI was present, and he gave a

portion of the presentation. As I recall, Mr. FitzGerald gave

the other portion of the prasentation.

Mr. Baron. Who

at that foint replaced William Harvey as

Chief of Task Force W?

then Screber, after that, Hart. I served with all four of those

This was a very active period, you know, with precision, I cannot

outline for you today the dates when Harvey left and FitzGerald

took over, you know, when FitzGerald left and Screber took over

and so forth. This is something that I would have to regearch

to give you the precise dates.

Mr. Baron. What was the substance of this meeting that

they had in which the President was present?

MI. Halley. This was a general review of activities that

were being conducted against Cuba.

MI. Baron.

Was there any mention of any assassination

effort at that meeting?

Mr. Halley.

No; there was not.

Mr. Baron. You were attending at that point in connection

with the survey you conducted?

Mr. Halley. No. I was attending at that point as the

Station Chief from Miami in order to make a contribution to the

issues that were being discussed, to the fact that detailed,

substantive back-up for whatever questions might be put to the

Agency spokesmen. I made reference to that because you asked

me if I knew the relationship between MI. McCone and this

know the relationship, but that there were meetings that ware

like MI. Kennedy, the Attorney General, who was a member of that

group.

Mr. Baron. Were you aware that that group might have gone

by any particular name or designation?

Mr. Halley. No, I am not.

Mr. Baron. You are not familiar with the term Special

Group?

Mr. Halley. Yes, I am. aware of the term Special Group.

I am aware that the chronology of the 303 Committee, Special

Group, 40. Committee and so forth, but as I mentioned to you

carlier, that particular time, I cannot distinguish between

whether this was an ad hoc meeting or this was a Special Group

mesting, or what it was.

MI. Baron. Did you assume at that time that the three-man

group that you referred to, including- the Attorney 'General,

General Lansdale and Richard Helms, had a formal relationship

to this larger Special Group? In other words, was that three-

man group a kind of decision-making sub-unit of the Special

Group, or do you think it operated entirely independent from

the National Security Council structure.

Mr. llalley. I do not think I can give you an authoritative

answer to that. I would go back to what I previously told

you. When I entered into this project in February of '62, the

chain of command that. I was familiar with was this three-man

group in constant contact with Mr. Harvey. The second chain

of command, paralleling that, was Mi. Harvey reporting to the

DDP and the DDP subsequently reporting through his chain of

command to the Director, and that would be the only way that

I could characterize that with any accuracy.

Mi. Baron. Did those two chains of command continue"..

as the channals of decision-making and tasking when you were ..

or during your tenure as Chief of Station,at JMWAVE?"

MI. Halley. That relationship changed, and again I do

not have the date at my fingertips at what time that changed.

I know that shortly thereafter I was in Miami, General

Lansdale came down to visit me, to talk with me, about the

progress that was being made in the operational program. At

some point after that, this three-man group for all Intents

and purposes disappeared. General Lansdale was reassigned;

the group broke up; subsequent reviews of the program were made

at the Special Group level. As an example, we would have to

submit every month the number of operations that we were going

to run, such as infiltrations into Cuba through what would be

paramilitary means, and these were approved by the Special

Group. There was an approval procedure for setting those up.

so subsequently the three-man group disappeared and the regular

mechanism of the Special Group cama into play.

I am sorry, I cannot give you a precise date for that

change, but I am sure it is in the record and I am sure you even

Mr. Baron.

We can do that.

would you say that every major operation that you undertook

at JMWAVe would have been approved by the Special Group or at

least they would have been put on notice of the nature of any

major operation that you were planning?

MI. Halley. Why do you not define for me what you consider

to be a major operation so we do not get into, you know, a

problem? If'you feel that you cannot.do 'that it?..

Mr. Baron. Perhaps we can turn it around and say, could

Group later, for their approval, or at least to put them on

notice,:. the kinds that you might not refer and instead proceed

unilaterally?

Mr. Halley. Initially, the three-man group was seized

with the problem of conducting the survey of what could be

done against Cuba. As soon as that was more or less agreed

upon, my understanding of this, as I told you, the three-man

group was disbanded or atrophied or went on to other things

and then the formal mechanism came in for approval, that is,

the Special Group. As procedures. became more formalized, we

had to submit a monthly schedule of the kind of operations that

would ba conducted against Cuba in the paramilitary

slaldo.

In other words, if we were going to run an operation that

was 90lng to be a cacho replacement in the Cuban mainland, that

had to be put in, say in our October schedule, that october

schedule had to be submitted to the Washington Headquarters so

they could make it available to the Speciali Group sometime in

September. So I would regard a cache, say the lowest

kind

operation in terms of sensitivity, and then you could move up

from team infiltrations that had to be approved in advance,

resupply missions, paramiltary operations against fixed instal-

lations would all be approved.

Mr. Baron. If there had been any operation with the

assassination of Fidel Castro, or other high Cuban government

leaders as its objective, would such an operation have been

referred to either the three-man group or later the Special

Group.

Mr. Malley. If such an operation had been proposed. from

Miami; it would have had to have gone through that particular

process.

Mr. Baron. Your answer seems to indicate that only

operations that originated at the JMVAVE Station would be

referred up for approval. Is that correct?

Mr. Halley. That is the kind of activity that I have

FIrsthand knowledge of. Ihen I became the Station Chief, I told

you my time at this was essentially February of 1962 through

That was

During that particular period of time, my firsthand knowledge

forward it would have had to go through this approval mechanism,

it would have had to have been some formal action taken. If it

were something that certainly would -- for some reason might not

to whomever was the head of the Task force In Washington, or

later, when the Task Force became reintegrated Into the Western

Hemisphere Division, I would have had to talk to the Chief of

the Western Hemisphere Division, who at one time was fitzGerald.

Mr: Baron. But a plan that originated at the CIA above

the level of the Chief of Station at JMWAVE would not necessarily

have been referred to Special Group for approval, 1s

that

correct?

Mr. Halley. I have no firsthand knowledge of that, there-

fore I am.trying to restrict myself to those things that I have

personal knowledge of. In other words, that is the kid of

thing that I think you should talk to, you know, those

who were

involved directly, because I think you can talk to Mr. Harvey

perception of that.

my associates. Therefore, I was not aware of the firsthand

on items that did not immediately impact on Miami.

Mr. Baron. Do you have any personal knowledge of any

operation run out of the JMWAVE Station that could

MI. Halley. No, I do not.

Mr. Baron. Do you have firsthand knowledge of any operation

run out of Florida with CIA involvement that could

be construed

as an assassination effort?

• Mr. Halley. No, I do not have any firsthand knowledge.

You also have to put this in a historical perspective. In

other words, from what I have read in the Press since then,

obviously I could put certain things together. You are asking

me in this timeframe, 1962 to 1965, did I have any Élrsthand

Mr. Baron. Exactly.

Mr. Halley. The answer to that is no, I did not.

You also have to put yourself in the historical context of

Keys. There was a regular mechanism to screen these people.

Any number of these people had plans or ideas for changing the

in Cuba were plans to assassinate any number of people in Cuba.

This was something that was talked about, you could go down to

any coffee house in downtown Miami and Cubans would be talking

that kind of language..

So I do not want to leave you with the impression that the

word assassination never came across my radar screen, but we

are talking about, and my answer was geared to a planned opera-..

tion by CIA.

of the Latin American revolutionary where a coup, you know, is

of Fidel Castro, Raul Castro, or Che Guevara, Which was run with

CIA involvement?

Mx. Hallay.

I would like to phrase that question slightly

differently, because I think, you know, you have several things

tied together. I would like to answer your question this way.

During my tenure in Miami, I did not put forth any proposals

to mount an assassination operation. In other words, there

was no formal plan, I did not put forth any operational proposals

along this line.

Secondly, I am not aware of any assassination plans being

put forth, you know, by Mi. Harvey or by anyone else at that

particular time. That is the way I would prefer to answer that.

MI. Baron. What. kind of problem did you have with the

question as it was •asked?

Mr. Halley. Well, you lumped a number of things together.

•I am trying to separate these out. In other words, you put in

there a secondary or tertiary consideration.

Mr. Baron. Right, I am interested in that.

Mr. Halley. That is what bothers me, because I did not

put forth any plans. On the other hand, I do not want to be

held responsible for such things as CIA being in touch with a

paramilitary group in Cuba whose primary mission was the

collection of intelligence, whose secondary mission might ba to

organize a resistance and, unbeknownst to me, might have had

their own ideas which were never consulted with us, you know,

never discussed with us, through the communications channels

that we had, who may have been thinking, may have planned, and

may have attempted, to implement assassination operations.

I do not feel under the command and control mechanism that

existed that I could exercise through the station over such a

situation that I could be held responsible for that. Therefore,

I cannot accept your question on the secondary or tertiary

situation because I have no knowledge of those. You may have

some knowledge and you can confront me with some statement by

some Cuban who said that this was part of his mission. I have

to look at that at the time.

Mr. Baron.

We will go

over some statements, but in trying

to recover this ground one more time, I think it is important

to distinguish an attempt to pin the responsibility on you,

which I am not trying to do by my questioning -

Mr. Malley.. That is a complicated question.

Mr. Baron. The attempt to simply -- undoubtedly, the

attempt to simply bring out your knowledge and any awareness

that you may have had of any kind of operation that had assassina-

tion as one of its objectives, and also involved the CIA to

any extent. That is what I am asking you for.

Mr. Hallay. Right, and I will stand by my answer; that 1s,

I put forth no plans, I know of no plans put forth, you know,

during my tenure in Miami in which assassination was part of

the operational rationale. You know, the only way we can clarify

this perhaps to your satisfaction is to discuss some specifics.

If you are prepared to talk about specifies, maybe I can deal

with those within the framework of that general statement that

I made, you know. I know how Cubans talk. I know the rumors

that have existed over the years. I simply do not want to be

identified with any action conducted by some group over which

I had no knowledge or control. That is my key point.

Mr. Baron. I think that answers it for now, and we will

cover some specifics later.

One more question on this dual chain of command: on the

one hand, the Agency chain of command from the DDP to Harvey

to you at JMVAVE, and on the other hand, the three-man decision

making group consisting of the Attorney General, Lansdale and

Helms. Would you say in the early days that this three-man

group appeared to you to be in control of the decision making

before the Special Group stepped in, that decisions were made

in a less formal way than they were later under the Special

Group?

Mr. Halley. I really could not address myself to that.

In other words, I never sat in on a meeting of the three-man

group. In other words --

Mr. Baron. What about the kind of Isporting that was

required of you by the three-man group as opposed to the Special

Group?

MI. Halley. My requirements for reporting really stemmed

In the early days from Harvey. If there were any special

requirements, he was taking them from the three-man group and

translating them and, in fact, much of the system of reporting

in those early days was generated by me.and' what:I'thought.".

was required to keep Mr. Harvey as a Task Force Commander

fully informed. I think that you undoubtedly know from the

record that I worked for Mr. Harvey prior to 1962 and therefore

I was familiar, you know, with his style of operation and thought

I had a clear understanding of what he needed in an informational

sense. So when I went to Miami, I organized much of the

reporting flow upward, if you will, from the field unit to

Headquarters.

MI. Baron. Had you worked for Mr. Harvey in Germany?

Mr. Halley. Yes, I had.

Mr. Baron. In Berlin?

Mr. Halley. Yes, sir:

Mr. Baron. This was on the famous and successful tunnel

operation?

Mr. Halley. No, I do not deserve any credit for the tunnel

operation. That is Mr. Harvey's activity. He kept that very

tightly compartmented and in the days when that was going on. I

was involved primarily with Eastarn European activities.

MI. Baron. You were aware of Mi. Harvey's style of

operating?

MI. Halley. Yes.

I worked with him-- I think the date is

somewhere in June or July of 154 to somewhere in '59. I woula

have to look that up in the record, the exact date.

MI. Baron. But you say you not only had a close working

relationship with Mr. Harvey, but you came to be a personal

friend of his?

Mr. Halley. Yes, I would like to say I am a personal friend

of MI. Harvey.

MI. Baron. Returning to your statements about the chain

of command, you seem to be saying that Mr. Harvey served as the

funnel for both of these chains of command; as far as you were

concerned, you received directives from him, whatever the source

may have been originally, is that correct?

Mr. Halley. Correct.

I want to make a point. Insofar as the three-man group was

concerned, I would see Helms in his role as the DDP in the three-

•man group. I would see Lansdale -- as I told you, Lansdale cama

down to visit me in Miami on one occasion. He came as part of

that. three-man group.

But my chain of command, during my

visit was still from me to Harvey. Lansdale was down there,

I was to be, you know, straightforward, candid, discuss plans,

programs, problems. But I received my orders and instructions

the control of money and so forth was vested in the Task Force

Commander, Mr. Harvey.

Therefore, I never

dealt with this three-man group as a

body. I dealt with the individuals, you know, and various

mutations.

MI. Baron. Would you say that the

three-man group had

less formal, more free-wheeling style of decision making, id

there was a real change in the rigor with which you were reguired

to report after the Special Group took over?

Mr. Halley. I would have to say that the total reporting

became more formalized the longer we stayed in business. I

cannot ascribe this to the difference of style of the three-man

group as opposed to the Agency chain of command or subsequent

with the requirements of the Special Group. This evolved from

a body of experience that was gained as the operation was

established and got some experience.

So I would not want to characterize that as being a result

of the groups.

MI. Baron. You did not have any problem with the proprlety

'of the three-man group in the early stages?

Mt. Halley. No, I had no reason to believe that it was

not a duly constituted body. In other words, their officers that

I reported to in that particular case, Mr. Harvey, Mr. Helms,

were my chain of command at that particular point, were the

ones who briefed me on the existence

of this three-man body

Mr. Baron.

Mr. Halley.

My recollection of the initial briefing

was

from Mr. Harvey.

MI. Baron.

Do you recall how he described that three-man

group and the responsibilitles?

MI. Halley. No. This was 1962, and this is 1975. As

you know from my records, these intervening years have been

very active for me, therefore, I do not remember with precision

that conversation in all of its details. I do recall my first

briefing on the existence of this three-man group being from

Harvey.

MI. Baron. You mentioned that General Lansdale might

occasionally meet with you personally. This is in Miami, at

JMWAVE Station?

Mr. Halley. I can only recall at this point one specific

meeting where he came down to Florida in Miami to visit.

Mr. Baron. What was the substance of that meeting?

Mr. Halley. He was given some briefings by my staft on

their areas of specialization, whether it was foreign intelli-

gence collection, whether it was maritime activities, or whether

it was paramilitary activities.

I spent a lot of time with him.

It was a substantive management operation,

Mr. Baronv.. What perlod of time would you place this in?

Mr. Malley. Probably sometime: In the surimer of '62,

bacause my family was already in Miami at that point, and when

I fixst went to Miami my family was not with me. I think my

wife joined me in Miami sometime in the summer of '62, you know,

I would have to research that. It is obviously available from

the records as to when my family moved and a permanent change

of station.

Mr. Baron: Was there any discussion whether direct or

Indirect of assassination of Cuban leaders during your meetings

with General Lansdale?

Mr. Halley. I do not recall any such conversations. You

know, I think that from my point of view, we are off a little

bit on this perspective a I would like to try to focus on the

perspective for you in the historical setting.

Mr. Baron. Please do.

you are narrowly focused on this assassination thing, but let

that I went to with Director McCone, the Attorney General, Mr.

Robert Kennedy, was present at that white House briefing. He

did ask some questions, which I do not remember what the

questions were at this particular point in time. I answered

some of those questions that were put during the course of that

particular presentation. Throughout that whole period of time,

that was the only, if you will, direct contact with him that

I can remember. You know, unless you can show me something.

Mr. Halley. That is right.

MI. Baron.. At that meeting -- again, I realiza what we

are doing 1s an isolation out of context -- at that meeting that

you attanded, with the Cabinet members and the President, was

there any discussion either directly or indiractly or by means

of any circumlocutions:.. of the subject of assassination?

Mr. Halley. Not that I can recall.

You know, my recollection of that meeting is, we went to it

en masse, the first --you know, Director McCone, myself,

Bruce Shiever, several other people who went. We went in

several cars. We went to the meeting, the Cuban issue was the

first item on the agenda. As I recall the thing, the Cuban

thing was over after this period of time. We, the technocrats

left, the Director John McCone stayed on. You know, during my

presence at the meeting there was nothing discussed about

assassinations.

Mr. Baron. Was there any such discussion between yourself

and John McCone or Richard

Helms at any point?

Mr. llalley. I never recall discussing assassinations with

John McCone. Now, in terms of discussions with Richard Helms,

these were conversations in which atmospherics in Miami and

problems: Ilke that would be discussed, 'and I am sure somewhere

in some of these conversations the mood of the community, the

subject of assassinations undoubtedly came un. This was part

of the life of that particular period.

wa flesh out the historical context, do you have any recollection

of the manner in which assassination might have come up between

yourself and Helms?

Mr. Halley.

Again, I put it in this overall context of

the times. We.were.runnindForeign.Intelllgelce.coll@otfon..r:

•collection against Cuba through paramilitary teams. We were

involved in paramilitary operations that could be described as

commando raids. Those were the kinds of activities.

We were dealing with exile groups, we were debriefing

refugees and in all of this conversations of assassination,

the Cuban penchant for it had to come up: I cannot pinpoint --

Mr. Baron. You do not recall any reference of means to

be used or people to be involved?

Mr. Hallay. No. Even such things as discussions of

various kinds of weapons, you know, people, as you probably

know from this experience, every individual who deals with

weapons has a different view on what is the ideal weapon. If

you took a squad of ten men and gave them the

free choice, I

am sure all ten of them would come up with a different weapon.

Therefore, when we were standardizing weapons to our

of the weapon for the Cuban to carry, because many of them were

quite small. In this context, people would discuss what is

the range, can a guy use it to shoot somebody at a particular

range? Is this an assassination weapon? Is this a good weapon

for close combat?

Therefore the term assassination was just a part of the life,

of the fabric at that time. That is what I am trying to get

across.. I just cannot articulate any more eloquently than

that.

Mr. Baron. I think you are being quite eloquent and

extremely informative. You mentioned that the phrase assassina-

tion would be used in the discussions about the kinds of weapons

that would be used for commando raids or equipping your

operatives.

Mr. Halley. Paramilitary teams, right.

MI. Baron. Was the capacity of a weapon to be used as

• an assassination weapon among other uses a desirable capacity?

In other words, was that phrase

used positively?

Mr. Halley. No, it was not. It is the kind of thing

that weaves itself into, you know, a conversation.

For instance, if you are planning a commando raid against

something like an oil refinery, you have to think about how are

discussing

assassination, was the kind that would have to be

done from a long range.

You know, I think that it is generally an accepted thesis

can in time assassinate almost anybody. Now, the Cuban was not

that kind of a person. That was:not his psychological make-up.

He tends to want to live, to enjoy life, to talk about his

accomplishment. Therefore, while they wary brave and dedicated,

they were the kind of people who would probably engage in

something like this in the context of using the sniper weapon

as a vehicle for assassination, long distance.

Therefore, in this context you are talking about range, you

know, one of the key factors becomes what is the accurate range

of a weapon if fired by an expert marksman. Therefore, that is

the kind of thing that would go into, you know, discussions of

weapons.

MI. Baron. When you were discussing weapons with high

range and low muzzle velocity, was this ever discussed in the

context of shooting Fidel Castro or other key Cuban leaders

as

opposed to targetted shooting on a commando raid.

MI. Halley. I can recall, you know, no conversation in

which it was narrowly focused on the question of Fidel Castro.

MI. Baron. Let us go back, then, to putting this all

into historical context. I am going to ask you if you can

explain more about the structure of the IMWAVE Station, both

the channels supward.': from you to the Agency and the Special

Group and the channels downward from you to your operatives,

appreciated.

MI. Halley. I think what I would like to do is to try to.

put this into some perspective.

The perspective really starts with the failure of the Bay

of Pigs Operation. After the failure of the Bay of Pigs, the

Kennedy Administration wanted another look taken at the problem

of Cuba. In order to get that other look started, the Kennedy

Administration created this three-man task force or this three-

man group and wanted to see what else could be done against

Cuba, and that is when I came into this problem in February of

' 62.

Mr. Baron. Is it possible that the three-man group that

you are referring to is actually the Robert Kennedy-Maxwell

Taylor Board of Inquiry into the reasons for the failure of the

Bay of Pigs operation?

MI. Halley. This three-man group stemmed out of that

inquiry. What its relationship was to the inquiry, I do not know,

because I was not involved and I never had an opportunity once

I plunged into this job, to go back and read those historical

documents. You know, I am sure there is a Maxwell Taylor Report,

and so forth; but I have never read it.

All right.

Therefore, my first task when I became involved in this

was the task of coming up with an operational plan to see what

kinds of intelligence could be collected in Cuba, so that by

collecting this intelligence, an assessment could be made based

on hard facts as to what could be done against Castro. In other

words; the difference here was that people thought that the Bay

of Pigs operation was not soundly grounded in intelligence.

Therefore, this was an attempt to start the collection of

intelligence to see what could be done.

In order to collect intelligence at that particular time,

it was beliaved that all avenues of approach should be used,

so that meant classical foreign intelligence operations,

counterintelligence operations, the debriefing of refugees, and

the use of paramilitary means to put teams

into Cuba to collect

intelligence on that part of the island that could not be

covered by what you would call the more classical means of

foreign intelligence collection.

As the program was started

essentially by me or accelerated

by me, we in fact got caught up with the cuban Missile Crisis --

that is, the advent of the Soviet intervention into Cuba -- and

our whole effort shifted to covering that Soviet build-up in

Cuba, and this was an integral part to our having detected the

Soviet build-up and the United States government taking the

actions which they did, that is, to verify this.

• There was a great problem for a while when we were all

talking about hard intelligence, the President, John Kennudy,

was telling us, give us hard intelligence. We thought we were

giving him hard intelligence.

of hard intelligence, as 1t turned out to ba, was a U-2

:Then we got caught up into the ayaball to eyeball confron-

tation of the Cuban Missile Crisis. When that was over, we

got caught up with the problem of monitoring the disengagement

of the Soviet presence in Cuba. That took us up through sometime

into early '63.

Then we took a look again, because we knew an awful lot

more about them than we had when we started in February of '62,

to see what could be done agáinst Cuba, and it was clear at

that

point that no external Invasion was going to be possible,

because that was something that was excluded by the Khruschev-

Kennedy agreement and then it was not feasible. In any event,

therefore it was a question of what could be done.

So we were

collecting intelligence to continue to stay on top of the

situation. We were attempting to establish contacts with the

military establishment in Cuba to see if there was any force

that was opposed to Castro within the military establishment

that would be used to alter the situation and continue

to see

whether there were any economic pressures that could be brought

on. Cuba that would accelerate the whole problem of creating

an environment in which

resistance could be created on an

island.

when the United States and Russia reached an agreement that no

axternal invasion of Cuba would take place, did you turn

primarily to the ways and means of finding a dissident group

within Cuba that might be capable of overthrowing Castro,

number ons, and number two, of finding means of undermining

the economic strength of the Castro government.

MI. Halley. In addition, we were continuing to support

certain elements of resistance, you know, that were still there

that were not in the Army.

Mr. Baron. What kinds of elements were those?

Mr. Halley. These were paramilitary forces that were in

Cuba, that we had put in or established contact with, or people

who were already in the bush who we had already established

contact with or they had established contact with us, and we

were providing

them with food, weapons ind so forth so that they

could survive. So that it was a multifaceted approach at that

particular time.

That went on from the middle of '63 until the middle of

'65, and these are two distinct phases of this operation.

In

affect, one, a survey, and two, the Missile Crisis and its

post-mortem, and then the next phase was the continuation of

intelligence collection, the working or taking the sounding with

military dissidents, economic pressure, and working with

natural dissident elements that were still on the island.

Into these various timeframes. When you talk

about, was there

ever a discussion of assassination, you know, when people

were coming out and being interviewed, yes, some Cuban refugee

would say, by God, I would like to go back and shoot, you know,

X, Y or z. It might have been some commandante in his particu-

lar area; it could have been

Fidel Castro. This was just part

of the fabric of the times.

MI. Baron. Can we turn now to the structure of the JMWAVE

Station and explain that a bit? low large was the Station?

What was the command structure within the Station?

Mr. Halley. The Station started expanding in whatever

timeframa it was, somewhere after the survey was completed. It

must have started expanding sometime in March of 1962. You

know, by the time that it was at its peak, which was probably

somewhere just before the Cuban Missile Crisis, July, August

of 1962, it was either the largest or the second largest -- my

recollection was that it was the second largest station in

existence at that time. I would not want to be pinned down on

a particular number of people on any particular day.

Mr. Baron.. Could you give some

idea as to the number of

employees at the Station during its peak?

you know,

Mr. Halley.. I would say somewhere in the neighbordhood of,

three hundred®

You know, again, this means staff and

contract employees.

that they could manage a series of vessels for us, but they

were not longterm staff employees. These would be people who

Mr. Baron.

Did you have other agents or operatives among

the Cuban community or outside the Cuban community that were

affillated with the Station although not employed by it

directly?

Mr. Halley. I think we are going to have to define some

terms.

Mr. Baron. What I am trying to do now is simply get a

picture of the scope of the Station's strength and be its

activities, how many people the Station had to call upon for

its activities.

MI. Halley. Well, let me try to give you an answer, because

I think we are going to get into

a semantic problem here.

When I talk about the Station, as such, I would say that.

people who ware not knowledgeable necessarily of whom they

Let us say, in the maritime part of the operation we might have

had at any one point in time, you know, up to five hundred

people involved in maritime activities, you know?

Again, if you pick a date, I am sure we can research it.

The records are still available and you know how many people

we had, but let us take these five hundred. What am I talking

about? These would be essentially Cubans who were the captains

of the vessles that were used in infiltration operations to

put people on the shore of Cuba, and there were a variety of

techrigues. In other words, you might start on with the mother

ship, which would be an LCI --I am not sure how familiar you

are with various kinds of vessels.

MI. Baron. What is an LCI?

Mr.. Halley. Landing craft kind of vessle, or a patrol

craft, a PC, 110-foot vessle, that would be a mother ship.

This is the kind of ship that would

take fuel supplies and

water, so that other smaller vessels could be serviced by it.

So you might start with an operation of a mother ship towing a

smaller boat, or having

it on its decks and going down to

fifteen or twenty miles from Cuha, putting the smaller boat

over the side, which was a faster boat, lower silhouette, less

likely to be picked

up by Cuban coastal radar, and then that

would take the team in close to the shore where we might finally

put them into rubber rafts, where they would paddle in or use

a silent outboard motor if the surf was high.

Mr. Baron. The

people involved in manning those crafts

would not necessarily be employees of the Station directly?

They might be agents, aven non-paid agents?

MI. Halley. No, they

were not paid.

For instance, they

might work for a particular cover company. In other words, I

am only using this as an example. Let us say we had the ABC

Shipping Company. That shipping company was a subsidiary of

the Station, if you will,and the ABC Shipping Company ran :

maybe ond LCI and maybe two or three smaller boats which it

could deck load and that company might have fifty or seventy-

five employees, as an example, all Cubans, maybe some of them

was Nicaraguans or Costa Ricans as most of these vessels -- I

would have to go and 100k

at each vessel.

Does that give you

a feel

for the size of the problem?

Mr. Baron. How many such companies would have been in

existence at that time, companies operating as CIA proprietaries

or companies in cover and supplying the JMVAVE Station with

• personnel or with equipment?

Mr. Halley. He are talking

about all of these companies.

they probably went up

into the hundreds. I distinguish between

companies that were set up simply to provide cover as opposed

to companies that were proprietaries. You know, these terms

mean different things to me.

Mr. Baron. Could you explain what different categories of

companios you were receiving halp from at that point, and about

how many of each there might have been?

MI. Halley.. I do not think I could do that.

We are

talking about hundreds of companies that we used during that

period of time.

Some of them might simply have been a company

set up and registered and run out of some attorney's

office. It simply provided back stopping for the ownership of

the small boat.

Everything has to be owned by somebody, it has to have a

Coast Guard registration, you know, things like that. Even

if

I had access to the files to answer your question, it would

take me weeks to pull all that together to give you an answer.

I don't think there is an overview statement.

would it be fair to say that you had coopera-

tion on a grand

scale from

all kinds of people in private

Mr. Halley. I think it would be fair to say that we had

we had

extensive cooperation from the civilian sector in

Florida, in the state of florida, to facilitate the conduct of

this clandestine mission.

bean armed or violating local law in some othur way, who were

held immune by arrangements that you had with law enforcement

agencies?

Mr. Halley. You have asked me, in essence, three

questions.

MI. Baron.

Right:

MI. Halley. Let me try to divide that and deal with each

question separately.

Let ma first

deal with the vessels. Every vessel that we

had

was appropriately registered. There were no short-cuts:

insofar as the U.S. Coast Guard was concerned. That is, any

vessel that was registered in the United States met appropriate

safety standards and so forth, so we were not putting any

vessels into the water that any citizen could not have put into

the water. That is we are talking about ten, fifteen, twenty

foot boats, thirty foot boats, thirty-five foot boats, things

like that. These boats were owned in elther a corporato name

or by a private individual who had to register them with the

Coast Guard and pass

normal Coast Guard regulations.

(Discussion off the record.)

Mr. Baron. To continue with this, I understand that

safety regulations would have been complied with, but was there

some sort of immunity from inspection, say inspection for

carrying armaments aboard a vessel that the CIA had arranged

with maritime authorities, or local law enforcement authorities?

Mr. Halley. When we had operations going, these were

coordinated with the Coast Guard in terms of their knowing that,

you know, at a particular date, time group, that there would be

a rendezvous between two vessels which were our vessels, and

this was coordinated with the Coast Guard.

Mr. Baron. Would you return to the second part of that

large question? Without reference to vessels, were CIA

employees or agents on the streets of cities in Southern

Florida immune from search

or arrest by local law enforcement

authorities?

Mr. Halley. They were not immune.

Let me ask to dispel one myth that I think has developed

which is reflected in your question. We were meticulous to

insure that no weapons were issued to anybody until the men

were on the vessel outside of

the immediate waters of

south

Florida, and we were meticulous to insure that when they came

back from a mission that they were met at sea and all the

weapons were taken away from then.

So, when you talk about a group moving around in Florida,

our control in the state of Florida, is just not correct.

This was all carefully controlled and they did not have their

weapons when they came back, we.took them before they landed,

so they were not immune.

Mr. Baron. You did have general arrangements or agreements

with law enforcement agencies throughout Florida for the

treatment of CIA operatives who were affillated with the JMNAVE

Station?

MI. Halley. We did have, through our office of Security,

a continuing dialogue with a number of law enforcement agencies

in Florida. If a problem developed, we would then contact them

and look at the issue

within the context of what had transpired.

Certainly there was no immunity. In other words, this has to be

looked at on a case by case basis.

For instance, you know, we had a training site in north

Florida, as an example. If somebody came off of that site that

was drunk and disorderly in town and could not speak English,

the local authorities did have a number to call to raise this

with us to see whether this was somebody that was of interest

to us, and then we would have to go and settle that particular

case.

MI. Baron. Back to the structure of the relationships

between yourself as Chief of Station at JMWAVE and any operatives

or employees who worked underneath you at that Station, would

it be fair to say that any activities run out of the Station

ultimately were channeled out through you?

MI. Halley. They should have been, and they were -- you

know this Station went through several mutations in organization.

during its existence. I guess the organizational structure that

existed for the longest period of time was something like I

am

going to describe to you.

There was a Chief of Station, which was myself. I had a

Deputy Chiaf of Station for operations. That is the gentleman

who is now setired, I think he is still alive, by the name of

Moore, Robert Moore. I had

a second Deputy Chief of Station and

he was for support Patterns. That is a gentleman who is

also

retired, a MI. Corris.

Then

the rest

of the station was organized into a number of

branches. Each branch was organized along functional lines.

Let me give you an example.

There was a Foreign Intelligence

Branch. These were

people in, what in my terminology would be

classical foreign intelligence operations. That is, trying to

Itcruit a . Cuban diplomat abroad, as

an example, dealing with,

you know, a Uruguayan diplomat in the Uruguayan Embassy in

Havana. They are working with resident agents in Cuba who might

live in some city like llavana and have a legal job as a baker or

butcher or something but had a radio set in which they could •

communicate with us, through which they could communicate to us.

Then there was the Paramilitary Branch. This was the

group that ran the commando operations. This was the group that

ran, and put people back into Cuba, into rssistance groups, or

established contact with resistance groups. This was a group

that also worked in putting in caches that would supply people,

sither paramilitary forces in Cuba or agents that were being

run by the Foreign Intelligence Group.

All right. Then there was a Covert Action, people who

dealt with exiled refugee groups that were involved in radio

activities, publications, that kind of thing.

Then there

is a

whole panoply of -- then there was Maritime, in terms of

finance, and so on.

Security was a branch. Obviously, under

that kind of system, no executive, whether he is president of

a corporation or a Station Chief, can

see every single piece of

paper that comes in or

out, but clearly there was a review

procedure whereby program reviews were conducted, individual

operational reviews were conducted.

Mr. Baron. By yourself?

Mr. Halley. By myself. I do not want to leave you with

the impression that I knew every single thing that was going

on evary minute and could account for the activities of three

hundred employees on a daily basis.

with the station a moment ago, I think we may have created a::

misimpression that the only people involved in CIA operations

were people who were paid by the Agency. Isn't it also true

that thera were many members of Cuban exile groups in Florida

who participated voluntarily from time to time in CIA sponsored

operations?

Mr. Halley. I think that you may have to sharpen that up

for me. I am not sure what you really maan.

If you are talking about foreign intelligence collections,

you know, the people who were producing --

Ms. Baron. I am talking now about the paramilitary

operations.

Mr. Halley. No. I do not know of any people that were

involved in paramilitary operations that ware not in some way

Let me make sure that we understand each other, because

during this period of time there were a lot of independent

Cuban groups who claimed that they had sponsorship from the

Agency but did not, and were operating, and there was a period

in time when these groups could not run their operations from

Florida without running the risk of being picked up by Customs,

Immigration, Coast Guard, the FBI, or if we had information on

it, you know, we might pass the information to the Coast Guard

so that they could keep them from going.

If that is what you are referring to, somebody like Alpha 66

or commando I or somebody like that, they were not a part of

the CIA apparatus.

Mr. Baron. Although you might be aware of their activities?

Mr. Halley. We would be aware of their activities,

certainly.

Mr.. Baron. Can you explain if there is anything to add

to what we have already said? The chain of command, apart from

yourself as Chief of Station, to Task Force W and to the

Directorate of Plans within the Agency?

You would report directly to William Harvey?

Mr. Halley. William Harvey was Chief of Task Force W.

later FitzGerald. My chain of command was from me to them.

You know, they had a subordinate staff who helped them monitor

the Station's activity, so that it just was not the fact, you

know, that Mr. Harvey and Mr. FitzGerald were totally dependent

on what I told them. To have an appreciation of what was going

on in Miami they had their own staff that was following

• individual operations.

For instance, they had a paramilitary staff that would

review our proposals for a paramilitary operation and i might

say we think that the Station has overextended itself this

month, they want

to run twenty-five operations given the

weather during this particular month of October. We do not

think they could do it. We think they should be guided to run

totally dependent on me.

MI. Baron.

What was the nature of the split of responsi-

bility between Task Forca W and JMWAVE Station?

In other words, were there certain operations that were

run directly out of Task Force W?

Mr. Halley. Also, you have to put this into a historical

time. What period are you talking about.?

Mr. Baron. During the period of your tenure. If there

were changes during your tenure at JMWAVE, why do you not

explain those?

Mr. Hallay. There were.

Each one is different. Let me

give you a couple of examples.

Washington, Task Force W, essentially did not run

any paramilitary operations where they took command and control

for sending people to Cuba. For instance, if Task Force W in

Washington wanted to plant a radio in Cuba which was to be pickod

up by foreign intelligence agents who could report, they would

task us to implant that radio in a cache in a particular area

in Cuba, for instance, Oriente province. We would know simply

that it was a radio perhaps: Wy would then put it into

Oriente province, write up the site, give them the rip cord.

They would communicate to the agents' in Cuba who would go

recover the cache.

So they had agents in Cuba that were reporting foreign

intelligence to them so they had collection assets that were

reporting to them along the same lines that we did. They:did

work at a downstream point when FitzGerald came in with a

couple of groups -- in other words, they had contact with

Artime. I had no contact with the Artime group as a general

rule. They also had contact with Manolo Ray which I did not

have contact with. So they were working with these kinds of

larger exile groups.

The Task Force also specialized in much more economic

activity than I did. That is a question of looking at such

things as

Mr. Baron. In terms of paramilitary operations, if an

assassination operation had been run by Task Force w, would

you have assumed as Chief of Station in Miami you would have

been aware of such an operation?

Mr. Halley. No, I do not assume that.

Mr. Baron. Would it not have been sound managerial

practice to let you know that there was an operation that might

'have been run through Florida into Cuba?

Mr. Malley. No.

You know, the Agency is a highly compartmented mechanism.

You know, let us dispel one thing very promptly here. If you

are asking me was I aware of all these contacts, you know, with

the Mafia -- and I think I can tell you frankly at that tima I

was not -- Harvey would come, you know, to Miami, to visit me

to review the activities of the station, and while there would

go off on his own and make his contact with whomever he was

meeting. I knew he was meeting somebody, but it was not up to

me to find out with whom he was meating or why he was meeting

them or what he was doing with them.

MI. Baron. My question really was, I think more innocent

than that.

Jas ft strictly one of involving what correct management

techniques would be, or what kind of knowledge the Chief of

Station of JMWAVE would have to have in order to do an effective

job in dealing with the Cuban community and running operations

into Cuba? You seem to be saying that it would not be ...

necessary to run an effective job to have knowledge of every

other operation that the CIA is running against Castro?

MI. Halley. I think what I am saying during that particu-

lar time-- I do not want you to come to the conclusion that

I was knowledgeable of everything that ran in from or through

the state of Florida, because during that period of time, for

• instance, Mr. Harvey in particular was a very compartmented

gentlaman, and it would be keeping with his style to run an

operation in which the locus of the operation might be Florida

and I would not know about it.

Now, that would be an unusual thing, but it is not precluded.

MI. Baron. Let us turn for a moment to following i

nature of your contacts with Willlan Harvey in raference to any

operations he may have in running unilaterally against Castro.

Do you recall aiding Harvey in an operation that he was in charge

of and that was not affiliated: with JMWAVE?

MI. Halley. I do not recall anything, I do not recall

anything specific. In other words, the pattern was in terms of

command and control, I would come to Washington on a regular

basis to review activity with Harvey after we submitted our

paperwork. Harvey was also a frequent visitor to Florida.

We would have operational discussions. He would talk to the

Branch Chiefs, he talked to people.

He also went out on his

own, and he was meeting somebody, it was clear to me that he

was meeting people. But it was frankly in the way that the

Agency is run and managed, it was not a concern to me whom he

was meeting.

MI. Baron. Would it have been proper of you to inquire

of him whom he was meeting?

Mr. Halley. No, it would not have been.

Mr. Baron. Did you have suspicions or speculation about

whom he might have been meeting or for what purpose that ha

was having thesa meetings?

Mr. Halley. No, not for what purpose. There

is a whole,

you know, panoply of things going on at that time. You know,

frankly I was a very busy guy, when Harvey was there, it occupied

one hunk of a lot of my time. If he wantad to go off, you know,

MI. Baron. Let me strike the reference to a Cuban exile.

Do you recall a time when Harvey asked your aid in procur-

ing arms ard aquipment to be given to a man named Tony Varona

who was a contact of Harvay's?

Mr. Halley. I know Tony Varona. He was in the period --

prior to the Bay

of Pigs, he was part of the consejo.

Frankly, if you've got something that you can sharpen that

up, I think you need

some basis, that. I think that can trigger

my memory here. I do not remember frankly Tony varona being

in Harvey's --

Mr. Baron. In contact with Harvey?

Harvey, some kind of equipment or done some kind of operational

support task.

about $5,000 worth of arms and equipment to be left in a parking

lot and picked up there by a contact of Harvey's?

And this

would be in approximately April of 1962.

Mr. Halley. I do vaguely remember something about a rented

truck. Quite frankly, I do not really recall all the details

of this at this particular time. I do not remember, you know,

personally procuring any material, but it is conceivable that

I did get a request from Harvey, that I did go to the logistics

apparatus, and whatever he had requested from official stocks

he was provided.

MI. Baron. During that same period of time --

Mr. Halley. I do recall something about a truck. I do

not recall anything about a trailer. My recollection of this

truck incident seems to be --I do not remember what it was.

We did do something for him logistically, I do remember a truck

being involved with some logistic material in terms of a

parking lot.

But frankly that is about all I can recall of it

at this particular time.

MI. Baron. Do you have any recollection of hearing of

poison pills In any connection during your tenure at JMWAVE?

Mr. Halley. No, I do not recall -- poison pills?

Poison

pills, the only kind of thing I can recall occasionally when

people were talking about being on mother ships, you know, what

would happen if they were captured. This was a discussion

occasionally of whether any kind of drugs should be issued to

the people who were manning these vassals so they could do

but we never issued any such pills but there were discussions

of that kind of a problem. I do recall specific agents who

were sent back to Cuba to run a collection or to go back into

the bush and so forth who asked for some sort of pills which

they could kill themselves with if they were captured.

But other than that - if that is what you were referring

to, I think they are called I pills, or something, as they

were referred to in those days.

in assassination

operations against Fidel Castro or other

Cuban leaders?

Is that referencing to this material that I might have

that quickly, because I would not have had access to them.

is.why --

Mr. Baron. They would have had to come directly from

Mr. Halley. That is what I'm trying to clarify what it is

that you are trying to establish from me.

In other words, if you are saying --

spacific now.

We have a document that. I am about to show you. I just

wanted to clear up. the background of it before we discussed

the document.

Mr. Halley. Let me just make this point. If you are

if that is the nature of your question, I can say I had nothing

to do with that. If you are talking about, you know --

ammunition, plastics, that kind of thing I could have had

access to, yes. That is why I am trying to sort out really

where the thrust of your questioning is.

have picked both of

them up. One is whether you had ever heard

of poison pills in connection with an assassination operation

against Fidel Castro, and your testimony would be that you had

not, is that correct?

That is right: I would not have had access

to those pills myself, nor did the Station. In other words, if

I had wanted something like that, I would have had to corres-

ponded with Washington in order to have had access to it, if

in fact it existed.

equipment to which you already replied.

given to Varona through

Roselli, Varona requested arms and equipment needed for the

support of his end of the operation. Rosalli passed the request

to Harvey. Harvey, with the help of (Mr. Halleyl, the chief

of the JMVAVE Station, procured"

Continuing.--And then it continues to say a large shopping

list of arms and equipment, which cost about $5,000 and were

supplied in

a parking lot of a drive-in restaurant in a rented

U-Haul truck.

Would the cost of $5,000 have been an unusual expenditure

at that time at JMVAVE

Station

for

arms and equipment?

MI. Halley. No, $5, 000 would not have been an unusual

expenditure.

Mr. Baron. Not unusual enouth, in fact, for you to have

a particular memory of thu event?

Mr. Hallay. No.

Now that I read over this thing, I do recall, as I told

you earlior before

you showed me this document something about

a ranted truck and being involved with Harvey in providing him

some logistical support for an activity. I do not recall this

specific list of equipment being involved, you know, soilewhere

you got this and if I could check it against the files, if there

are any files available, I could verify whether this is correct

or not.

Mr. Baron. Whether or not the particular list is correct,

you would say that these couple of passages from the IG Report

generally characterize your involvement with Harvey in this

one incident correctly?

MI. Halley. I would want to sharpen this up, because you

have one, two, two paragraphs here. In the first paragraph

there is a reference to some pills. I had nothing to do with

any pills. I have no recollection of any pills.

Mr. Baron. Let us jump then to the very last statement and

let me ask you if this confirms your own sense of your knowledge.

The report says: "Harvey says that (Halley)" -- here I

am using your alias = "never knew to whom delivery was made nor

for what purpose.

(Halley] was merely called upon to furnish

support for a headquarters operation from which he was otherwise

excluded."

Dors that generally characterize correctly your point of

Involvement with this activity?

Mr. Halley. I would say that is correct.

I want to go back to these other points, though, because

I want to be meticulously correct here. I do not recall the

specifics of this inventory of equipment. I do not recall,

you know, sitting in a parking lot, surveilling any kind of a

vehicle. On the other hand, I do recall having been involved

with Harvey in some sort of an effort with a U-Haul truck.

Now therefore that last sentence you have read is correct, • :.

I knew nothing about any of this delivery.and Iwag called upon

to furnish support for a headquarters operation from which

was otherwise excluded.

MI. Baron.. You are not denying, are you, that you may have

sat near the parking lot and surveilled the truck until it was

picked up?

Mr. Halley. I have no recollection --

Mr. Baron. One way or

the other?

Mr. Halley. No, I would say that my sitting in a parked

car with Harvey surveilling a parking lot is the kind of thing

• that would have

stuck in my mind.

I do not recall ever doing.

that and that is the thing that has me a little perplexed here

and I am having trouble matching this thing up with my own

mamory. It would have been

damned unusual for Harvey and I to

have sat in a parking lot, and I just do not recall that.

I do have a vagua

recollection of being involved with him

in some sort of caper involving a U-Raul truck.

Mr. Baron. At that time, if Harvey had made a request of

you to supply $5,000 worth of equipment like explosives,

detonators, •30 caliber rifles, .45 callber handguns, radios

and boat radar, would you have supplied that equipment to Harvey

or to anyone he designated without asking him what the purpose

of the operation was?

Mr. Halley. Yes, I would have supplied it to Harvey or

to his designated representative, depending on how that person

identified himself to me with the equipment that he requested.

That was my chain of command and, if he had told me that he

had wanted this material for any operational activity, I would

have seen to it that it was issued to him. That is the way the

Agency functions.

Mr. Baron.

Would it have been standard

procedure in a

paramilitary operation to procure equipment that would not have

been traceable to the United States as the In Report indicates

was done in this case?

MI. Halley. It depends. It depends on what was the

• sponsorship that was trying to be conveyed to tha paramilitary

group.

In other words, let us say there was a Venezuelan busiress-

man who may have been giving some assistance to a Cuban exile

group. If somebody had gotten in touch with that Venezuelan

businessman and he was saying I brought weapons into Florida

who have been characterized as members of the Mafia, of the

the passage of poison pills to people inside Cuba purportedly

for use against Castro in the restaurant that he frequented.

And this plot by William Harvey's own admission was directed

by Harvey during llarvey's tenure as the Chief of Task Force W.

Mx. Halley. I take due note of what you are saying. I

have no knowledge of that. I will be glad to comment on any

of the names. My commenting on names is in no way to reflect

I have no knowledge of it.

knowledge of

any assassination effort involving poison pills?

Mr. Halley. - Yes.

Mr. Baron. Did you ever hear of any assassination schemes

which may of may not have been put into effect involving

exploding sea shells that Castro might pick up by scuba diving?

Mr. Halley. No, I do not recall any exploding sea shells

while Castro was

scuba diving, but the problem of Castro being

an avid scuba diver is well-known to me. As I recall, somewhere

in this thing there was a refugee group or Cuban exile group

or somebody at one time in this whole activity who had focused

MI. Baron. You do not recall ever hearing Desmond

subject or hearing that Desmond

FitzGerald was involved in exploring that possibility, planting

an exploding sea shell?

MI. Halley. The exploding sea shell is enough of an off-

beat kind of thing that I think I would have recalled it. I

don't recall it.

I do recall Castro's scuba diving, and that representina

a vulnerability and somewhere in the recesses of my memory,

that does strike a bell with

me that some exile group, somebody

was talking about Fidel Castro being vulnerable while he was

scuba diving.

Mr. Baron. Did you! ever hear

of a plan to present Castro

with a skin-diving suit in which bacteria injurious to his health

would have been cultured, bacteria that would have produced

tuberculosis and would have produced a dreadful disease?

Mr. Halley. I have never heard of any bacteria approach

to the problem of dealing with Fidel Castro.

I do want to come back to this that I do recall something

about scuba diving, you know, on the range of Fidei being

vulnerable at the time he was scuha diving, but I do not recall

exploding sea shells or bacteria.

Mr. Halley. Other than reading the papers -

Mr. Baron. Other than what you read recently in the papers

did you acquire any knowledge during your period as Chief of

operations?

Mr. Halley. No. I had the impression

off that he was meeting with somebody, and at one point in time

I came to the impression that he was meeting a guy by the name

of John. Who John was, I had no idea. We were involved in an

attempt to try to find two Soviets at one

point who were of

interest. The fellow who provided the lead to that had been

a member of one of the casinos in Cuba at some time.

of this lead, I was surprised with the spood with which we got

a response back on this man and the details run down that we

got on him in terms of who he was and where he worked and so

this fallow very well and somewhere in the whole labrynth, eithet

Justice or we or somebody had access to somebody who could give

us a great deal of insight into paople who had been involved

with the gambling establishment in Cuba.

Those are the only two things that. I can say to you that

I knew at the time. Obviously I have sinca read the papers and

I have put together in my own mind by deduction that the John

that I was aware of that. Harvey was in touch with must. be John

Roselli, but I cannot provide to you --

MI. Baron. Would this person with contacts with gambling

interests in Havana have been Santos Trafficante?

Mr. Halley. I would have no way of knowing. I know who

Santos Trafficante is.

Mr. Baron. How do you know this?

Mr. Halley. This is like asking me whether I knew where

Santos Trafficante is a name

that constantly was discussed among Cuban exiles and he was a

well-known figure. You could not possibly be involved. .

Mr. Baron. Did you know of any involvement that he had

in Cuban operations that were connected in any way to the CIA?

recollection when I was in Miami, Santos Trafficante was in the

I also think that there was some large scandal, when I was

in Miami, that was played up in the Press. I forget, some

Federal agent who was somehow involved with the Mafla and with

the Syndicate and there was some linkage in the Press between

Santos Trafficante, Cubans and the Federal agent, but I do not

remember the details of it.

Mr. Baron. ¡The Federal agent was not a CIA employee?

MI. Halley. No, he was not. My recolluction 1s he was

Narcotics or something:

Mr. Baron. You would make the same statement about John

Roselli that you had no knowledge of his connection with any

CIA sponsored operation against the Cuban government or against

Castro personally?

want to caution you that I have read the Pross. If I have

trouble sorting this out, I want you to understand that --

Mr. Baron. I understand that clearly.

Mr. Halley. -- that this is a dilemma for me. Obviously

I told you I made my own deduction that John, the one that

Harvey was in touch with, must have turned out in the context of

20/15 hindsight. to be John Roselli. At the time, I did not

know that.

say in answer that at the time that

I was involved in '62 and '65 I did not know anything about

Sam Giancana. I have since read in the Press about him.

Therefore, the name is familiar to me today.

Mr. Baron.

Did you know at that time that Sheffield

Edwards, who was then Director of the Office of Security, was

connected in any way with those efforts against Castro personally

or against the Castro government?

Mr. Halley. At that time, Shef Edwards was known to me

as Director of Security. That is all. I had no knowledge of

his involvement in any activity against Fidel Castro in a

personal sense.

Shef Edwards did help Security Officers assigned to my

staff in Miami. Therefore I would periodically go to him about

the performance of his officers who were on my staff. So during

the time that I was involved in Cuban affairs, yes, I did see

him, yes, I did talk to him

performance of his officers on my staff, but nothing about anything

the consejo, the revolutionary counsel that had been set up to

sort of administer the Bay of Pigs optration. In the post

Bay of Pigs era, Nua Cardona and Tony Varona were people who

still appeared on the exile seene and were prominent. We had

some dealings with Nua Cardona, officers in the Station had

dealings with Nua Cardona and Tony. Varona to pay off, you know,

injuries to peopoe who had been suffered during the Bay of pigs,

things like that, widows and so on. I kiow who he is and so

Mr. Baron. Would it surpriso you if that were the case?

Mr. Halley. The Tony Varona thing would surprise me,

frankly. I think I would not -- I would be surprised, yes.

Mr. Baron. Why is that?

Mr. Halley. Well, because here is a case where the guy

was a prominent exile figure, essentially residing in Miami, and

I knew of no contacts or had no reasons to suspect any contacts

with this kind of an exile figure, though once it specifically

appeared, I was aware of and it was discussed. This was done

under FitzGerald's stewardship with the Task Force. I was .

aware of that. I would be surprised if sombone was in touch

with Tony Varona and I did not know about it.. If you told me

that is what happoned, that is what llarvey has testified to,

I accept that. I am

surprised by it.

Mr. Baron. What was the nature of the CIA relationship

to Artime?

Mr. Halley. Well, the Miami Station had no direct relation-

ship with him.. As to the nature of the project, you know Artime

ran'from the Agency, from other people who actually worked with

•him on a first time

Mr. Baron.

Were you aware of a project called AMLASH?

Mr. lialley.

Let me make sure we are talking about the same

thing.

Mr. Baron. Off the record.

MI. Baron. We have just gone off the record to straighten

out the fact that we are both talking about the same Cuban' high

military officer who was known to the CIA by the cryptonym of

AMLASH.

Correct me if I am wrong, Mr. Hallay, that you and I agree

that we are referring to the same person that we have identified

off the record?

MI. Halley. Yes, we have.

MI. Baron. Were you aware of contacts between AMLASH-1,

as he was known, and Artime?

Mr. Halley. I think at the time that this was going on, I

do not know whether I was or I was not. -- I was aware that the

CIA was in touch with AMLASH.

Mr. Baron. Did you deal directly with the case officers

who ran AMLASH?

MI. Halley. I did not. My recollection of this AMLASH

case is as follows. • At some point in time, I had a conversation

with Desmond FitzGerald in Washington during one of my periodic

visits to Washington from Miami. We discussed at that meeting

the nature of our approach to the military establishment in

Cuba. In the context of that conversation, Mr. FitzGerald asked

me if I thought whether it would be a good idea for him to meet

one of these Cuban military personalities, and he subsequently

identified to me the personality he was talking about was

AMLASH-1.

My advico to him was that it would probably not ba a good

idea for him to meet him, and the only thing that I could see

coming out of that kind of a contact would be that he, Mr.

FitzGerald, would get a personal feel for what makes some of

these people tick, in human terms, and that that probably was

too high a price to pay for the prospect if anything went wrong,

an individual as prominent in Washington as, both within the

Agency and the social world in Washinaton, would be exposed in

the Press. That would create a flap that I thought was not

worth what would be gained from that meeting.

Mr. Baron.

Would this have been in the fall of 1963?

Mr. Halley. I have no recollection of the time.

Subsequent to that, Mr. FitzGerald told me that he had

indaed met him and that he had had an interesting conversation

with him. I subsequently recall that this gentleman was met

in Spain at some point in time --

Mr. Baron. This gentleman being AMLASH-1?

Mr. Halley. This gentleman, being AMLASH-1, was met in

Spain. I also recall after having left the Cuban activity that

I read a Press article showing that. he had been apprehended

and I remember reading the publicity of that particular

activity. It is also my recollection that we put in & cache

for

him.

That is about the sum and substance of it.

Mr. Baron. Do you recall what the purpose of that cache

MI. Halley. It was a cache. I think that you could:?"

go:tothe record to establish what was in the cache. I do not

recall specifically what the material was that was in the

cache.

MI. Baron. At the point that you were having these

conversations with Desmond FitzGerald, though, in the first

instance the prospect of his contact directly with AMLASH-1,

in the second instance his reaction to his contact with AMLASH-1

do you recall FitzGerald mentioning to you the fact that

AMLASH had requested assurances that high officials of the u.s.

government would stand behind him if he undertook operations on

behalf of the CIA?

Mr. Halley. I do not recall this at the time.

You know, I also want to say, as you probably know from

the record, I was later Chief of the WH Division from 1972 to

1973, and I did read some of the files. I am familiar with

the case. But at the time -- I am trying to be schizophrenic,

you know, to put this in the time sequence in which we are

• talking about. My recollection of that is that I did not know

that.

Mr. Baron. It would then be your testimony that Mr.

FitzGerald never broached with you the subject of making a

representation

to AMLASH-1 that. Robert Kennedy or other high

officials of the U.S. government would stand behind him?

With FitzGerald, no. I can only say that my

FitzGerald and his staff were working on what I was doing in

Miami to try to establish contacts with the Cuban military.

In other words, we saw this as a multi-faceted approach. First,

we wanted penetrations of the Cuban military so that we could

collect intelligence.

What were their strengths, weaknesses,

what was their mood, where were things going? Secondly, we

wanted from these sources operational intelligence. Who -- in

other words, who in these groups were dissatisfied as Fidel

consolidated. Who could provide leadership for a counter-

movement

against

Fidel?

We were looking for people, once we had identified them,

to sed if we could establish contacts with any of these leaders

so we could see whether there was a basis for working toward

an overthrow of the Castro government. You know, those were

the basic steps.

Now as you got down to talking about how you overthrow

Castro, obviously the question comes in of how does a 'group who

wants to run a coup or take power take power, and obviously

one of the things that has to be looked at is where does the

•existing leadership going to be during this event, who has,

control of the various units.

So our discussions were all in

that context.

MI. Baron. Would it have surprised you or would it

surprise you now to learn that at least part of the contact

with AMLASH would have involved planning for an assassination

Mr. Halley. I certainly was not aware of that at the

time, as I recall from, you know, looking at the files in the

'72-'73 period, saeing any evidence of that in the file at the

time.

MI. Baron. There are fourteen folders in the AMLASH file.

Did you read all of those files?

Mr. Halley. No, I did not.

Mr. Baron. How did you gather your impression that that

was in the AMLASH files?

Mr. Halley. I think I may have read one or two volumes

of whatever my question was at the time, because these cases

keep

coming up. You know, there must have been some inquiry

at the time that necessitated my looking at the folder or

discussing it with my staff and so on.

MI. Baron. As far as you knew, what was the objective of

the contact with Artime?

Mr. Halley. You mean the CIA contact with Artime?

Mr. Baron. Yes,

.....

Mr. Halley. As a concept, the Artime thing was looked at

as another track, an approach to the overall Cuban problem to

see if they could sort of do it on their own. If they could

simply be given, you know, & number of dollars, some equipment,

some guidance, and give them an opportunity to find a Cuban

solution to what was a Cuban problem. That was also, you know,

and if you have not, you should talk to the people who ran the

Artime operation, when this was set up, I think I participated

In giving Artime some tutorial training for a couple of weeks

when this operation was first established in order to familiarize

him with some of the problems of trying to manage a large

operation against Cuba because he had been out of things for a

couple of years.

Mr. Baron. Were you aware that. he had been supplied a

weapon which we already agreed could be characterized as an

assassination weapon?

Mr. llalley. You say "we." You and I?

MI. Baron. Yes.

Mr. Halley. Which weapon was that?

Mx. Baron. A high-powered rifle with long-range and low

muzzle velocity.

Mr. Halley. I am aware of the fact of this project that

Artime was involved in that he got a number of weapons, any

number of which could have been used for sniper type activities.

I am aware of the fact that he had a base in Nicaragua to

• have activities, so I would find it hard to single out a weapon.

My recollection of that that he was given a large number of

weapons.

Mr. Baron.

Was one of Artime's objectives to have been

to assassinate Fidel Castro?

MI. Halley. Not that. I am aware of.

Mr. Baron. Did you ever hear any discussion to the

effect that the Agency was attempting to achieve through Artime

indirectly. what they did not want to achlave directly in a

fashion that would be attributed to the CIA, namely the

assassination of Castro?

Mr. Halley. I think that you have tied two issues together

there and I do not think I can

answer. the question that way.

I would llke to separate the question into two parts.

Mr. Baron. Go ahead.

Mr. Halley. The first part, as I mentioned to you earlier

the CIA did establish a relationship with Artime and he was

given funds and other support to run his approach to solving

the cuban problem. He was one of two such activities that were

run at the time. And therefore I think that your statement is

correct that perhaps he was set up so that there could be no

direct attribution in his activities

to the United States,

because he set up a base in Nicaragua, and the story as I recall

it was put out that he was receiving assistance from the

Nicaraguan government, and therefore there was a part of the

whole cover story, if you will, for him.

So, yes, there was an attempt to set him up as a parallel

track or a separate track. That does not follow

from that, in

my perspective, that was geared towards an assassination

operation, because that was a fantastically large operation

involving lots of people, you know, with substantial amounts of

money. I was opposed to it at the time. And once it was set

up, and I did what I was supposed to do, which was to train

Artime and contribute to his training, I then did not pay an

awful lot of attention to the thing except what I picked up,

you know, over the years, and again in the '72-'73 period,

and talked to officers who had, you know, more intimate knowledge

of it and got an appraisal of it as to what they thought had

Castro?

Mr. Hallty. No, not for the specific purpose of assassina-

ting Castro.

was a reliable agent?

Mr. Halley.

I really do not know that much about him,

you know. This was an operation that was run at that time out

of Washington and, you know, my knowledge was as I described it

to you, the conversations with FitzGerald, Madrid, newspaper

•articles, so forth, in that particular timeframe.

Mr. Baron.. Did the CIA to your knowledge use any gambling

Syndicate contacts inside Cuba or people outside Cuba who were

connected to gambling interests inside Cuba for any operational

purpose including the intelligence gathering?

Mr. Halley. Well, Executive Action is some sort of a

euphemism -- to eliminate somebody, I guess is how it appears

in the popular jargon.

MI. Halley. No, I think that this is a term that has been

years I have seen literally --

Mr. Halley, Let me go back. You asked me about RIfLE.

This is one of a thousand

or hundreds of cryptonyms.

Evely day

I read, you know, hundreds of pages of traffic, so when you ask

me do I know what URRIFLE is, I must answer you off the top of

my head

no. I have tried to be helpful. I have asked you

several times if you could give me a steering tip or show me

what direction you are going, I might

be able to try to comment

on it, but ZRRIFLE as such

means

nothing to me. You really

could not expect that it would, given the thousands of these

things that come across my desk.

MI. Baron. That

is absolutely understandable. I want to

try to see what happens in the way of getting an unrefreshed

recollection from

you, then I will go back over these two,

especially the next one, DJWIN. Do you recall a CIA asset who

went by the cryptonym OJIN?

forth, normally it would have

something to do with Spain. It

Mr. Baron. Harvey has testified, as has Richard Bissell,

I will represent to you, that instruction was given by Bissell

to Harvey to set up, to develop such a capability in early 1961

and that Harvey took steps to develop such a capability in

coordination with an asset in New York named nJWIN and I think

that period of greatest activity was in 1962 and WIN was

involved in spotting potential assets among the criminal under-

world in Europe and might be used for any number of dirty

deeds.

Mr. diGenova. It should be emphasized that the Executive

Action Plan that you are referring to has had as

its goal the

incapacitation of foreign leaders, one possibility of

incapacitation being the ultimate weapon, assassination. It

was just not assassination. It was a spectrum of activities

that could be used to incapacitate a foreign leader anywhere

from illness, chemical warfare, and then including death.

Correct me if I am wrong, but it was not just assassination.

MI. Baron. Does that ring any bells?

Mr. Baron. Let us pick out some specifics and discuss

them briefly here.

Near the beginning of this article, it mentions that JMWAVE

Station operated within an annual budget of well in excess of

$50 million.

Would that be accurate to you?

Mr. Halley. I do not recall whether that is an accurate

figure. We would have to go back to the records: You know, as

I explained to you earlier, the start of the operation taking

place in March and

escalatid up. to a high point:and then

dropped off. In the budgetary cycle, we are dealing with a

mass of figures, and I would not want to give you an inaccurate

answer. That

is something that could be researched -- we have

the files - rather than speculate for you on the buildup and

• reduction in the operation. I do not feel that is useful.

Mr. Baron. As a ballpark figure, would you be able to

place the annual

budget of the Station in the neighborhood

of tens of millions of dollars?

Mr. Halley. No, I would not, because of this transition,

you know, period, the costs were very high in the beginning to

get a start-up operation, brougit to a certain peak, and then

tapered off and starting to be peeled back. I would not want

to draw a figure of --

MI. diGenova. What would the start-up cost?

•Mr. Halley. In terms of what they

involved or dollars?

figure. You might want to get that figure when you can retrieve

it in the files. It is available.

MI. Baron. Were the operations of IMWAVE coordinated with

other Latin American CIA Station's, as the article indicates

here?

MI. Halley. I think my recollection of that phase is that

Cuban activitles with other Latin American stations were

coordinated with JMWAVE.

Mr. Baron. Coordinated with JMAVE?

MI. Halley. With JMWAVE.

MI. Baron. Who had the central coordinating responsibility?

Mr. Halley. Washington.

MI. Baron.. Was that. delegated by Washirgton to you?

Mt. Halley. No. Essentially Washington had the overall

coordinating responsibility, but that needs some

elaboration.

Miami that a number of interesting people had come in on a

flight to Mexico City. He would send a cable down to Mexico

City with an information copy to washington outlining who we

were interested in, and I would probably send somebody down to

Washington.

Mr. Baron. Let me quote you a passage here and see if it

comports with our discussions earlier of special arrangements

you may have, the JMVAVE Station may have had, with law enforce-

ment authorities in Florida.

The article says: "All the boat missions to Cuba were tech+

nically illegal under the Neutrality Act, the Maritime Laws,

and Immigtation statutes, so that the Station had to work out

special acrangements with Customs, Immigration and the Coast

Guard."

Is that generally accurate?

MI. Halley. I think, as I described to you before, there

• was coordination with the Coast Guard

in terms of vessel

departures. The other is Immigration?

MI. Baron. Customs, Immigration and Coast Guard.

MI. Halley. Immigration, there would not have been

coordination or a particular, you know, boat dispatch. On

the

other hand, let's say if a mission aborted for some reason and

a small boat could not racover its position and get back to the

at that point.

Now the third group was Customs. Customs did have a

number of patrols and at times when boat loadings were conducted

off the Florida Keys in particular, those ware coordinated with

the Coast Guard so they would not be expending their manpower

to run down groups that were extricating with us, in fact the

Agency was doing.

MI. Baron. The article continues to say: "It was illegal

for agents to travel around with machine guns and plastic

explosives in the cars, as they often did. The Station had to

establish

liaison with seventeen police jurisdictions along

the Florida coast

and into the Keys. The result was that

any agent who was arrested for anything from drunken driving to

illegal possession of firearms would be quickly released."

Is that accurate?

them on the vessel and taken back from them when they came back

Mr. Halley. I have to go back and divide your question

into two parts. There were no

firearms --

MI. Baron. I am not saying firearms supplied to them by

the CIA for a CIA mission or any agent travelling down the

street in Miami who happened to have a Saturday Night Special

in his car or who happened to be drunk while driving. Would

such a person be released right away of once the CIA connection

surfaced?

Mr. Halley. It varied. When we started expanding the

operation, you know,

there had already

been a Station there

and

there also were

two security units in the greater Miami

area.

In some cases the existing contacts at the station were

expanded, the same with Dade County. In

other cases, the

sacurity of personnel who had established contact with other

jurisdictions were used to effect the introduction. In some

cases, we had our security people who were on my staff go out

jurisdictions and identily themselves simply with a

interested In so that there would not be a cross 'öf problems

that basis, a multiplicity of approaches.

Mr. Baron. The article discusses the fact that regular

commando raids were run out of JWAVE Station to the shore of

Cuba, and that those commandos-were equipped with.all kinds of

explosives and armaments.

Is that generally a fair statement, that we were running on

a regular basis commando raids to Cuba?

Mr. Halley. Yes.

There were

a series of commando raids

run from the Miami Station against targets in Cuba.

Mr. Baron. Were assassination weapons, that is, high-powered

rifles with low muzzle velocity and telescopic sights, supplied

to those commando teams as a matter of course?

MI. Halley. .. No, they were not.

For most of those

commando teams, you were looking for a different kind of a

weapon. You are looking for a weapon with a high range of fire

power over a short distance to deal with an emergency situation

rather than the kind of, you know, weapon that we are talking

about.

In other words, you would find

that type of a group armed

with a submachine gun, as for example.

Mr. Baron. If

an assassination weapon as we have

described it was supplied to a commando team, they would have

to have a sperific purpose in mind for its use?

Mr. Hallay. Yes.

Also, again, all of these weapons were controlled, the

weapons that were issued

at the time of the mission on the

mother ship and picked up on the team's return to the mother

ship, so there was accountability for the weapons.

Mr. Baron.

• Would

it have been

unusual to supply what we

have called an assassination weapon to a commando team?

Mr. Halley.

Well, that

depends on the mission.

For

instance, let me use an example.

Most of the missions that were run were run against targets

•that were in fairly close proximity to the shore. If you are

going

to put a party to attack your objectives, let us say the

objective was a petroleum storage tank, if you were going to do

this by putting charges up

against the petroleum storage tank

that meant that you had to have a group infiltrate close

enough to put the charges on the tank. Some distance away

from them you would give them a second element of the commando

team

which would be providing

covering fire for this.group in

case they got into trouble and cannot. handle it on the ground.

This covering fire group might have had a light machine gun.

a Belgian weapon. They could have these kinds of weapons and

they did have these kinds of weapons which

in the definition you

art

using could be used as a sniper weapon of whatever, but the

basic reason for having

that

weapon was.

to provide fire

support.

for the other members uf the commando team. And therefore when

this mission was over and they raturned, those weapons were

taken back from them and accounted for. They were shaken down

so that we did not have weapons disuppearing out of our

control.

Mr. Baron. Such weapons, high-powered rifles with telescopic

scopes, conceivably with silencers, were supplied with some

regularity, but they were kept under tight control?

Mr. Halley. We had high-powered rifles. I cannot think now

of a case where there was a sniper scope attached to the rifle.

I can think of no case where there

was a silencer attached to

a rifle in any of these commando raids. There were a number of

raids conducted, some of them involved

teams of fifteen or

twenty men. I am not prepared to say that no man ever had one,

Mr. Baron. In the Harper's article, It says that Martinez

indicated that "More than once he was given personal charge of

weapons drops in which special rifles with silencers and tele-

scopic sights were left in designated inland

spots."

Do you know of a factual basis. for that statement?

Mr. Halley. Martinez is undoubtedly factually correct when

he says he put caches on the coast

of Cuha

that contained

weapons

I do not know how he would be able to tall what kind of weapons

were in the cache.

The reason I say that is that when one of

these missions were

planned, the cache was put together and

packed by our logistics group and once the cache

was put

togather it was brought on board the vessel and the

cache was

then turned over to

the team for infiltration so he would never

have seen

the contents of the cache, he would

not have

opened

it up because it was always in a sealed container.

It is conceivable that in the pre-mission briefing that

he got before he went down that he was told that we are

putting

In a cache containing a radio or putting in a cache containing

weapons because that would influence what he selecter as a

cache typy. In other words, if it ware a

were wraped in cosmolene and

so forth. He might know that they

were weapons, but he wouldn't krow that they were silenced

and they had

a scope.

I must honestly

say to you I doubt that.

Mr. Baron. Did you know of any weapons drops that ware

mado for the purpose of supplying someone inside Cuba with a

weapon for the assassination of Fidel Castro?

MI. Halley. No, not for that clearly stated purpose.

AS

I told you, we put a lot of weapons caches in.

The weapons were

multi-purpose weapons, could be used. I know of no cacha that

went in specifically for the task of playing a contributory role

to assassinating Fidel Castro.

MI. Baron. It would not have been contrary to the policy

directives under which you were operating at the time to

supply such a weapon to someone inside Cuba who might have

access to Castro?

Mr. Halley. No, it would not have been.

For instance,

I can remember several resistance.groups that we had that had two

three hundred

men

that we were supplying on a regular basis.

Mr. diGenova. Inside Cuba?

MI. Halley.

Inside Cuba, that were essentially living in

the bush

to a large extent, whom we did supply weapons to and

got anmunition to them and so forth. And that was why I was

very careful when you mentioned this linkage before to saying

that I could

not be a guarantor

as to what these man would do

with these weapons once they got their hands on them. They

were free

agents.

what you have

said is

a concern of not only yourself in terms of

realizing that it was a possibility but of people: like Dean

Rusk and Mr. McCone, who also said, you have to realize then

once

these agents

are in another country and are supplied that

thore is little if anything we can do to control those weapons

after they receive them. It would

be safe to say that that, of

course, was understood that there was a lack of control, and

to the extent that it was a problem, it existed and had to be

tolerated because of the nature of the operation, would that

be correct?

Mr. Halley. I do not know whether I want to phrase it

exactly as you have in terms of this lack of control. Our

mission in dealing with these groups was to first, to put them

in areas where we did not have other intelligence covers. Their

first task was to collect intelligence.

The:

second task was to organize a resistance which would

take armed action if we ever got a total package put together

that jave us an opportunity -- that was the first and secondary

missions. Once we issued the weapons to the team leader, if

you will, he had freedom to recruit from among the peasants

anybody he wanted to. If he gave the peasant a weapon, there

was no guarantee either by the team leader or by us that that

peasant would not do something that we did not want him to do.

To even shoot a militiaman, you could have an

argument, you

know, over a woman. Any numher of things.

Mr. diGenova. Were there any restrictions, once, for

air -- and we have spoken

to Mr. Murray who was in the lavana

Station, for example, for awhile and Arthur Avignon who :

was head of the Havana Station

for awhile who indicated that

they ware aware of the weapons drops and were intimately

familiar with where they would be.

Mr. Halley. That was

all before my time. I have no

knowledge of that. During my time, we mada no drops by

air.

Mr. diGenova.

Were there any limitations that were

placed of how the weapons would

be used that were delivered

into

Cuba to these internal resistance groups?

Mr. Halley.

I cannot speak to this period that you are

addressing.

Mr. diGenova. During your period.

Mr. Halley. During my period, the weapons were issued

essentially

as self-protection for the people who were living

in the bush. Secondly, to be used in a military operation at

such time as we got the whole package together. Thirdly, they

were to be used for self-protection if they conducted raids,

ambushes, sabotage operations.

were powerful rifles with sophisticated scopas, Sprlngflalds

with bolt

action, rifles only used by snipers. They were not

sent to shoot pigeons or to kill rabbits. Everyone in the

Underground was

plotting to kill Castro and the CIA was helping

the Underground. I was with the Underground as well as the CIl,

so you can see I was involved in the

plots too, but that is

also obvious."

You commented before that there was a lot of talk in the

air about assassinating Castro. Martinez seems to by taking

that a few steps further, saying that there were actual plots

underway in the Cuban Underground to assassinate Castro and

that people who worked with the CIA were aware of those plots

and were

aiding them in effect by the weapons they were

supplying.

Is that an accurate statement?

Mr. Halley. No, I do not think I can go along with that

statement. Martinez' role as

I described it to you, he is

accurate when he says that weapons were put in and that :'..

he participated in putting them in.

I again question how he

would know what was in each cache. I just do not see that, and

I would havy to accept that

as a sort

of secondhand

statement

by him becauser of the way that the caches were put together.

I just do not see his knowing that.

Mr. diGenova. Could he have found out about this after

the fact from people that he knew in Cuba, members of the

resistance in Cuba that he knew of who would have told him the

nature of the items that they would have received in a cache

delivery? Would that be one way that he could have found out?

was he that intimately involved, to your knowledge?

Mr. Halley. He was not at the time. This is the period

that I am familiar with, '62-'65. I do not know. Maybe some

of these

people have come out since then, and maybe he has

talked to people who have come out in '68, '69, things like that

I cannot exclude that.

At the time, I do not think, however, he would have had

that kind of firsthand knowledge, and therefore I have trouble

with that statement and I cannot identify with it.

Mr. Baron.

The Harper's article says: "By the end of

1961, several men affiliated with the CIA had already been

foiled in attempts to kill him" -- meaning Castro -- "among

them, Luis Toroella, executed; Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo, still in

•prison; William Morgar, executed; and Antonio Veciana, escaped

to the United States. lad these men succeeded, their efforts

would have been tied to the U.s. only indirectly, if at all."

Let me show you the passage I am reading from and ask

you whether you have any knowledge of the connection of any of

those men named to the cIA.

(Pause)

Mr. Halley. No, there is no connection that I know of

between these names and CIA. This guy Luis Toroella does not

ring any bells with me. Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo was a leader of

Alpha 66. He may have been in Cuba in '61. During the time

that I was involved in Cuban affairs he was in exile for -- he

was in Miami for a long period of time.

MI. Baron. Can you explain what Alpha 66 is for the

record?

MI. Halley. Alpha 66 was a Cuban exile organization that

was engaged in a number of raids against the Cuban government.

They claimed to have

attacked Cuban shipping, fishing boats, and

claimed to have an organization in Cuba that was a resistance

organization. Gutierrez Menoyo was therefore a well-known name

to me. We had no direct contact with him.

William Morgan is also a well-known name. His activities

and exploits in Cuba are well-known to anybody that has dealt

with Cuban affairs.

MI. Baron. Do you have any knowledge of a connection

attempted to shoot Fidel Castro, that is Gutierrez Menoyo did

this, I would have no reason to doubt. I would have no basis

for proving it, either.

Mr. Baron.

You have never heard of these alleged assassina-

tion attempts before?

Mr. Halley. No.

back up to date. Morgan did get himself in trouble with Fidel

over some

I do not recall,

MI. Baron. What about the last name on the list.

Antonio Veciana?

Mr. Malley.

That.

I do not attach anything to it. In other words, it is a name

I have probably read in various and sundry kinds of reports.

Gutiorrez Menoyo. We did have a steady stream of reporting on

list of groups that had a capability of doing this kind of

thing. Therefore, they received quite a bit of coverage from

us, from the FBI, from Customs, and others.

They were on everybody's sort of watch list.

MI. Baron. Let us tum now to a document that we will

introduce as Exhibit 4, which is a report by Fidel Castro on

alleged attempts to assassinate him that he connects to the

United States government and especially to the CIA.

Mr. Baron. Which was released recently by Gaorge McGovern,

to whom Castro had sent this report.

MI. Halley, is it true that I had askod you to review this

report before we began our session today?

Mr. Halley. Yes, you did, you did ask ma to look at the

report.

Mx. Baron. Can you point to any names ur incidents in

this report that are connected in any way in your mind to

actual assassination attempts against Cuba: -- Castro?

MI. llalley. No, I cannot point to any names that in my

mind are attached to an assassination attempt against Castro:

You asked me to look at this originally to see if

any of the

names were familiar to me in any way. I made a list of some

of the names that rang a bell with me, for various reasons.

One name is Humberto Sori Marin. I recall that he was

active, he was active with the DRE.

MI. Baron. At what page is that?

Mr. Halley. There

is no page number.

For

instance, here's

a name, Humberto Sori Marin. That is

•familiar to me. I do not know whether that was from the

reporting showing that he was in prison, you know, we constantly

got reporting on, or why, it is a name that I recognize in the

counterrevolutionary sense, that it is something that crossed

my

dask, to see the name.

All right.

The other name that is familiar is Tony Varona.

That was a Cuban exile leader. Wa talked about Tony Varona. I

MI. Harvey.

There

is another name in here, Manolo Ray. I mentioned

Manolo Ray to you. He was one of two exile leaders who had a

relationship with the Agency. You know, I told you Artime was

one; Manolo Ray is another.

He is familiar to me as a result of

that.

MI. Baron. You did not know of any involvement of Manolo

Ray in an

assassination effort against Castro?

Mr. Halley.

I do not.

Hert is another name mentioned in the same paragraph,

Aureliano Sanchez Arango. That is a name that

is familiar to

me as a prominent Cuban exile.

Mr. Baron.

You have no more specific recollection?

Mr. Halley. I am trying to be responsive to your question,

telling you which names ring a bell with me as

I run through

this.

Mr. Baron.

All I am trying to do is clarify for the

record the exact nature of your recollection of each of these

names.

Do you have any recollection of a plot alluded to in this

report to shoot Castro with a bazooka at the lavana Stadium?

ir. Halley. No, I do not have any recollection of that.

According to this, it this is correct, it took place in October

of '61 which I would not have had any knowledge of because I

was not involved in Cuban affairs until, as I told, you, early

February 1962.

Mr. Baron. The same would go for the shooting of a

bazooka towards the Presidential Palace?

15. Halley. I have no knowledge.

Mr. Baron.

Do you have any knowledge of any efforts to

assassinate Fidel Castro run out of Guantanamo Bay Naval Base?

MI. Halley. No, I do not. As you know, Guantanamo had

a number

of Cuban

exiles in it, people who had taken refuge in

the base at one time or another.:. During the time that I was the

Station Chief in Miami we did have contacts with people at

Guantanamo. We did use

them for intelligence collection

purposes, but I do not have

any linkage between that intelligence

project and assassination.

Mr. Baron.

were paramilitary operations run out of

Guantanamo Bay?

Mr. Halley. They were not during my time as Station Chief

in Miami by CIA. There was an office of DNI, Office of

Naval Intelligence representative on Guantanamo. I have no

knowledge of what they may have been doing during various

periods of time. I am talking about CIA.

Mr. Baron. Any other names that struck a chord with you

in this report?

Mr. Halley. Well, you have a name here, Mario Salabarria

Aquiar; that name rings a bell with me, for what reason, I do

not know. You know, we would have to run a name tracs.to get

a rundown of what is in the files and what is in the central

Index for me to be able to comment on it. As I told you earlier

I know that the Agency is doing all these traces after they are

completed and you get them and you want me to take a look at

it, I will ba glad to do so.

It may trigger some response.

This name, Ramon Grau Scerio, it rings a bell with me. It

is quite possible that he may have been a collection agent, just

as is written here. I am making a deduction, but again, I would

have to look at the name traces, but it is a name that rings a

bell with me.

Mr. Baron.

You do not remember him in connection with an

attempt to poison the Prime Minister in June of 1965 as it says

there?

Mr. Halley. No, I do not.

Then the next name that is on here, that is familiar.

Here is one that we discussed, that is AMLASH-1. We already

went over that one.

The other name was Manuel Artime, whom we have talked

about.

Mr. Baron. Right.

Mr. Baron. The last name on here -- I cannot find it --

the other name is Antonio Cuesta Valle. I cannot find it now,

but that is the last name that rang a bell.

take a look at what the information is.

MI. Baron. Was Frank Sturgis connected with the JWAVE

Station?

Mr. Halley. He was not.

Mr. Baron. Not under the name of Frank Fiorino either?

Mr. Halley. No, ha was not. This is again one of these

great myths. At this whole Cuba thing, Frank Sturgis was a

soldier of fortune, was constantly involved on the periphery

of the Cuban exile community. lle was involved in free lance

operations against Cuba. He was somebody that the FBI,

Customs, CIA, everybody, reported on. He was a household name,

but he was not on the CIA payroll during tha period that I was

involved in Cuban affairs, that is the payroll of the Miami

Station. I remember

name traces being run on this guy and so

forth, and the Agency had no contact with him during that

period of time.

Hi. Baron. Are you aware of his ever having been on the

payroll of the CIA?

Mr. Halley. I personally am not aware of it, and I think,

you know, if you had gone to the Agency that they must have given

you all sorts of traces on this fallow and told you the same

thing.

Mr. Baron:

Mr. Halley. Yas, I am.

MI. Baron.

How was that spelled?

MI. Halley. AMOT.

Mr. Baron. What was that program?

Mr. Halley. That was a program involving a Cuban emigre

group that was used

as an operational support mechanism to

support the Miami Station.

Mr. Baron.

What kind of support did they provide?

MI. Halley. They were interviewers of refugees who came

out of Cuba. They provided translator personnel to translate

the Spanish language publications that were of interast to us.

They provided information on the various mainstream activities

that were going on in the Cuban exile community.

Mr. Baron. Did they provide support for paramilitary

operations against Cuba?

Mr. Halley. They might have identified people whom they

thought we should interview or look to or see if they would

fit into other paramilitary programs. In other words, they

had the contacts. in the Cuban community. Say we had a requiry-

ment for a diesel engineer. We would say to the MOT organiza-

tion, we would say we are looking for a Cuban who is a diesel

enginter who has a first engine's license, and they would go.

through all of their contacts until they would come up with

one, a week or ten days or whatever, having identified: :

the fellow, where he was, what he was doing.

We would then

sand somebody around to talk to him independent of them and

pick him up to work for us in our maritime activities.

It was that kind of operational support.

Mr. Baron. People who were part of this program were

not used as paramilitary operatives, at least insofar as they

operatad under the aegis of this program. There were some of

them who may have buen in the paramilitary program

and then

left it and were subsequently picked up in the AMUT organiza-

tion.

Could we go off the record for a moment?

(Discussion off the record.)

Mr. Halley. 'e are now back on the record.

The AMOTs also worked with us on a common project, which

was monitoring Cuban naval traffic, things like that, so they

were used across the hoard for operational support tasks.

MI. Baron. One more

general question.

Did the JMWAVE Station have an operational relationship

with the FBI?

ir. Halley. I would not --

Mr. Baron. Was the FBI involved in

supporting your

activities in any way?

Mr. Halley. I would rather phrase that in my language,

because I think -

Mr. Hallay. I do not know if your question means the same

thing to me. I would prefer to say we had a liaison relation-

ship with the FBI, that is, on matters dealing with counter-

intelligence matters.

There was a regular exchange of data

with the FBI. There was an

exchange of name tracas on people

that they were conducting investigations on. for: countérintellit

gence purposes, We would trace certain individuals and with the

FBI there were a couple of counterintelligence cases that we

discovered that were turned over to the FaI.

So this is in the context of the normal CIA-FBI liaison

that existed between the two agencies.

Mr. Baron. But the FBI was not involved in supporting

paramilitary commando raids to tha shord of Cuba, is that.

correct?

Mr. Halley.

I do not know what you are driving at.

their. I am having a little trouble with that. Are you saying

that the FBI dispatched paramilitary teams to Cuba as

an organization?

Mr. Baron. Were they involved in paramilitary training

of any of the CIA operatives?

Mr. Halley.

No. The FBI did not train any CIA personnel

during my tenure in the Miami Station.

Mr. Baron. Did the FBI at any point provide with you

links to people who had gambling interests inside Cuba?

MI. Halley. No. We covered the gambling thing previously.

MI. Baron. Were you ever made awara of a CIA attempt to

secure the ald of a pilot, a Cuban pilot, to arrange for an

"accideht," to occur to Raul Castro when he flew on a Cuban

plane?

MI. Halley. I read this somewhere in the record in post

years, but I was not aware of this at the time, at the time I

was in Miami.

MI. Baron. Were you aware that serious consideration had

been given to the tactic of assassination at CIA leadquarters

during your period of involvement :with Cuban affairs?

MI. Halley. No, that is in the period 1962 to '65 when

I was the Station Chief in Miami, I was not aware of any serious,

you know, program operational effort towards assassinating

Castro.

Mr. Baron. Were you aware that serious consideration had

been given to the tactic or to the use of the tool of assassina-

tion at CIA Headquarters prior to your coming on as IMWAVE

Station Chief?

Mr. Halley. No, I was not aware of any, you know, planned

program effort at assassination.

Mr. Halley. I went through this before before you came

in and explained to Mr. Baron that the subject of assassination

was constantly being discussed in the Cuban community and was a

part of the fabric of the times.

MI. diGenova. That I am aware of. you are not the only

one who has expressed that knowledge that they were all saying

let's kill him, let's get together.

Mr. Halley. There was a lot of discussion of this kind of

subject of assassination and that is why I keep trying to be

precise that there was no programmatic operational program that

I was aware of to assassinate Castro.

Mr. Baron. Although the context in which we discussed the

talk that was in the air of assassinating Castro was coffee shops

in Miami and conversation among Cubans as opposed to conversa-

tions among high CIA officials back in Headquarters, were you

aware that there were at least serious discussions of the

use of assassination against Castrc at CIA leadquarters?

Mr. Halley. No, I was not. We are plowing the same ground

that we covered before in this.

As I indicated to you, people would come out of, Cuba and

discuss these kinds of things.

Some of these were reported in,

you know, traffic back to Washington. People would discuss

what are the prospects of somebody assigned to assassinate

Castro. In that particular context, yes, discussions on the

assassination of Castro took place. That is why I keep coming

back, if you are saying that if anybody outlined an opsrational

plan to ma, did I help construct the plan, did I make a contri-

bution to a plan, my answer is again no. We talked earlier,

you asked me about those exploding sea shells of which I said

I had never heard of but I had heard discussions of Castro's

vulnerability because he was a scuba diver. And you asked me

about bacteria, I said I had never heard of an introduction of

bacteria, but I had heard again about Castro's vulnerability

in this context.. Where I heard 1t., as I told you before, I do

not remember.

MI. Baron. I realize we are plowing some of the same .

furroughs again. I am trying to be meticulous in the way you

wert before. You just now said that the subject of assassina-

tion probably came up in the context of discussing the contin-

gencies of Castro's death. Did

it come up in terms of discus-

sing whether or not a plan should be put together to assassinate

Castro, whether of not an operation should be mounted --

MI. Halley. I cannot recall any such discussion, but in

any state where there

is a leadership dominated by one man, it

is always a discussion of succession. That question has come

up, you know, if something happened to Fidel Castro, if he is

thrown over, if he does something foolish himself or if somebody

is successful in assassinating him, somebody who decides sudden-

ly to take his machetti ard just get out in tha sugar cane

on whether or not the CIA should induce the death of Fidel

Castro?

I do not recall any such discussion. That

is why I have gone into all this background to try to explain

the mood of the times and that is why I keep referring to, in

my sense of the word,

as a professional intelligence officer,

of an opyrational plan, I was not a participant in any discus-

•sion in which an operational plan for the assassination of

Castro was discussed. That is, I think, the heart of the

matter.

MI. Baron. I have no further questions.

MI. diGenova. Mr. Halley, we have just had a brief

discussion here about some of the things that were covered

before I arrived by Mr. Baron and you. I do not want to cover

any

more of that ground.

it is my understanding in discussing the structure of

JMWAVE's relationship with Headquarters, General Lansdale's

name came up, and that on one occasion, General Lansdale actually

came down to Miami to visit the station to get firsthand

knowledge of what was transpiring. Is that correct?

MI. Halley. That

is correct.

MI. diGenova. Do you have any idea when that was?

Mr. Halley.

No. I stated earlier it was in 1962. It

probably was in the summer of 1962 because it was

after my

family arrived in Miami. I do not remember the exact dates.

It could be established probably from records of the Agency.

I do not recall it specifically.

Mr. diGenova. To your knowledge, did he travel by himself

or was he with compatriots or aides?

MI. Halley. My Iscollection of that. was that he came down

on a special airplane. There may have been other people on the

plane with him, I do not I+call, hut he

landed at Homestead

Air Force Base. As I recall, we picked him up from there.

MI. diGenova. Did he have contact when ha was there with

some of the assets themselves?

Mr. Halley, lle had no contact with any Cubans that I am

aware of. He did spend the night that he came down with some

friends at Homestead Air Force Base, but I do not recall, I

would have no way of knowing what he did that evening.

MI. diGenova. For the time that he was at IMWAVE he was

with officials such as yourself who had a supervisory capacity

at IMWAVE Station?

MI. Halley: That is correct.

MI. diGenova. I have no further questions.

Mr. Baron. On the record, I just want to thank you for

your testimony here today. It has been a long day and wa

have gone over a lot of things quite carefully and it has been

most informative.

I would also like to ask you, if you would, to pursua for

us that one name of the man who was connected with gambling

interests in Cuba and supplied some intelligence to IMWAVE

Station.

It is worth noticing that, in the innumerable

members of counterrevolutionary organizations,

one of the permanent goals has also been the-

physical climination of Commander in Chief, -

Fidel Castro Fuz.

The CIA, in orden to carry out its plans, has-

social origins, including samples of all types

of viciousness.

In the sare way, they have had no objection -

to recruting well-known leaders ando members-

from the American maffia, to whom they have -

barred their offences, in exchange for

their-

participation in the plots against our leaders.
