in this endeavor could

only have made you better

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, Clandestine Services Career

Service Panel

SUBJECT

: Recommendation for Promotion of Mr.

Joseph S. Piccolo .

It is recommended that Mr. Joseph S. Piccolo be promoted

from GS-7 to GS-8. He has been in grade GS-7 since 19 July 1960

and was assigned to what is now the Special Affairs Stall (formerly

Task Force W) on 27 August 1962.

2. As long ago as 16 June 1960 when he was a GS-6 Mr. Piccolo

was considered to have merited promotion to GS-9, but an Agency

policy precluding multiple grade promotions prevented his being con-

sidered for G8-9 at that time. He was promoted to GS-7 on 19 July

1960. On 4 May 1961 Mr. Piccolo was recommended for promotion

to G8-8 at a time when he was expected to leave the Agency in order

to comply with his obligation for military service.

The recommendation

was not approved on the grounds that promotion spaces were limited.

Mr. Piccolo served in the Air Force between 4 October 1961 and

27 August 19ß2 when he returned to the Agency and began working in

the Cl Branch of the Special Affairs Staff.

Mr. Piccolo has demonstrated an aptitude for CI and FI

operations and is one of the most promising younger men in the CI

Branch. His performance since returning from military service has

been supertor in all respects.

4, I am happy to recommend Mr. Piccolo for promotion.

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY..

WASHINGTON 25, D. G.

Applicant Information

Sheet No. 1

To all persons ipplying for employment.

with the Central Intelligence Agency:

This paper is the first step in applying for employment or consultant

Biatus with the Central Intelligence Agency. No application may proceed

beyond this first step if the applicant is not in agreement with the

conditions stated below:

General Considerations:

1. The Nitional Security Act of 26 July 1947 (Public Law 253, 80th

Congress) which created the Central Intelligence Agency places upon the

Agency the responsibility:

á, "40 advise the National Security Council in matters concerning

such intelligence activities of the Guvernment departments and agencies

as relate to the national security;

b. "to make recommendations to the Notional Sicurity Council

for the coordination of such intelligence activities of the depart-

ments and agencies of the Government as relate to the national

security;

c. "to correlate and evaluate intelligence relating to the

national security, and provide for the appropriate dissemination

of such intelligence within the Government... ;

d. "s0 perform, for the benefit of the existing intelligence

agencies, such additional services of common concern as the National

Security Council determines can be more efficiently accomplished

centrally;

e, "to perform such other functions and duties related lo

intelligence affecting the national security as the National Security

Council may from sine so time direct. "

!

---

## Page 91

14-00000

The special charocere of this national responsibility requires the Agency

to maintain correspondingly special employment criteri: which miy be

different from the routine or normal employment standards of other Govern.

ment departments and agencies which do not have the highly sensitive res-

ponsilality borne by she Control Intelligence Agency, ll follows that the

investigation of applicants preroquisire lo their acceptance do a time-

consining process which, in addition to loyalty and security checks,

includeo evaluation of competence, physical and emotional fitnees, und

avallability of i suitable position al such time as employment may be offered.

This la called "elearance" of an applicane.

2. Investigation of an applicant may reveal something which prevents

his clearance - perhaps something of which the applicont is genuinely unavire.

perhaps something which only the special employment criteria of the Agency

make unacceptable. In uny event, adverse lindings by the Agency are con-

clusive and final so far as the Agency is concerned, und no statement of

specific reasons is made so the applicane.

3. Employment by the Central Intelligence Agency is not i right upon

which an applicant con insist. Offer of employment which is subject to full

clearance does not constitute a commitment on the Agency's part giving an

unsuccessful applicant grounds for any claim against the Agency. Acceptance

of employment upon the condition of clearance is at the applicant's risk,

taken with the knowledge that a very substantial percentage of applicants

are not cleared.

Stitrinent of Understanding

and Agreement

I have read, understand, and agree to the foregoing Generil Consid-

erations. If not accopted for employment by the Central Intelligence

Agency, I will make no claim or demand in conflict with those consid-

erations.

I have also seen and read Applicant Information Sheet No. 2.

Instincts, his activist stylem and his been analytical skills, superbly qualify him

to serve

as the sentor Cl Staff coordinator for LA Diviston.

One obvious measure of

his strong, continued effectiveness, Is that in any given week he receives more

requests for guidance, Cl rile reviews, and other forms of cl support, than any of our

other area division coordinators.. On

the other hand, because of his in-depth, across

the board knowledge of LA's operational activities, he represerts a unique resource

to C/CI when the latter has to respond knowledgeably and rapidly to inquires from the.

DDO level on LA related matters.

On that score alone, C/CI has conmented on his deep

satisfaction with Mr. Piccolo's impressive performance.

During the year, Mr.. Piccolo led the team which conducted an in-depth Cl and

Operational Security. Survey of Brasilla Station and Its two Bases.

The final report

was well received by the Division and the Station, which began implementing certain

of the team's suggested recommendations before its return to Headquarters.

other Cl survey reports, the Brasilia study was forwarded to the DDO and the DC! for

their infoimation.

Piccolo is one of the more experienced survey officers, having

participated in or led five station survey exercises in AF and LA Divisions.

The operational traffte Mr. Piccolo screens for the "frano office"

accompanted by pertinent insights on the significance of the sereloment orsually

He has been praised more frequently for his commentaries than any of our

other coordinators, which is another reflection on his intinase familiariey with

the LA operational

Numerous examples of his productivo and versatile service

to the Division and Staff can be cited but we will note for die sale of brovity only

three to underscore out point.

(1) For the past two years ao has been the guiding

and principal referent on a joint Agency/rBI proposal which sailo enable the fBI to

engage in foreign CI operations against the Soviet intelligence

services on the

Mexican side of the border.

Mis perseverance in shepherdina the instrument through

Its vartous approvat-stages in the Agency and the Department of Justice, Is finally

paying off with the recent notification that the SCC/CI had informally approved the

-agrement. (2) This past summer Mr.. Piccolo was temporarily assigned to assist NE

Division as a consultant, because of his Brasilian expertise, in a case involving

a Brazilian walk-in who claimed PLO connections.. Ultimacely Mr. Piccolo participated

directly in the interrogation assessment process, and was a ley factor in finally

persuading the Brazilian to return to Brasil to work in place against the PLO.

Finally (3), he las quite justifiably earned the reputation (per student critiques

and faculty commentary) as one of the most effective instructors on the Cl Staff. He

lectures, regularly in the Cl and BOC courses, and participates in the walk-ins and:.

Doubled Agent seminars for our military and FBI colleagues.

Again, Mr. Piccolo's performance during this past yeár, as in prevtoús years.

reflected a sustained superior effort, which, I am convinced, sill continue to be

the pattern in the future..

I fully concur with the comments of the supervisor.

I have been most pleased

with the manner in which Mr. Piccolo has moved in and taken over the management

of his branch in the absence of the branch chief who departed with little warning.

vir. Piccolo is a hard-nosed, honest evaluator of l problems. He has, horever,

cables had considerable impact on WID management and were used widely in

the extension of the survey program into other areas.

Although Mr. Piccolo's field exposure has been exclusively in the Latin

Anerican arca, he has i widely varied operational backeround, having served

in varying operational capacities in several stations, and he is perceptive

in his understanding of operational realities.

lis personality is positive

and outgoing, and in most instances he is able to initiate very quickly a

responsive dialoge with follow officers.

He is adantible in outlook and

reads quickly and with understanding; qualities almost indispensible in an

activity of this kind. Im sum, Mr.

Piccolo approached both Surveys with

enthusiasm and a sense of responsibility, completed his written report

(he had a different partner in each casc) promptly and accurately.

doubtedly would have been engaged in a third survey except his temporary

tour ended and he was assigned permanently elsewhere in the Staff.

In his duties in the Special Upcrations Branch, Sit. Piccolo has excelled

in his management responsibilities in the sense of both setting the work

oit of his people and in getting along with them.

tie is on good terms with

le has shown good CI mentality and a thorrughness which is

essential to good CI work.. His dedication to his work is shown hy his

punctuality in the noming and his presence in his office well after five

most evenings:

His production as operations officer has been steady and

thorough for both of the projects for which he has responsibility.

Unfortu

nately, he experienced a period of ill health folloring a hectic THY;

however, he returned to duty at the first opportunity and resumed his duties

with vigor. His versatility was recently demonstrated by his participation

in a joint mecting with representatives of a forcion service over a perio

of several days and evenings during which he proved fully effective in

nchieving Ayency objectives in a liaison and social environment.

The most impressive aspect of Str. Piccolo's performance and one deserving

special mention in this fitness report is his ability bith the written word.

It is fully accurate to say that the survey

reports to stich he contributed

wore much hotter written than were those of his peers.

He has the ability to

describe an operational situation in terms which are at the same time mean-

ingful, concise

and casy to read.

It is a pleasure to read his material and

to compliment him on this ability in this report.

Subject conducts Station liaison at the working level with

two contacts.

His main job is the maintenance of the relation-

oblige him to take but never give, to cancel scheduled training,

and to maintain a low profile.

Nevertheless, he does manage

to extract information of interest. on the terrorist and political

military officers who are being assessed and developed.

This sooms to be a fair report which rates Subject about the gamo

way that I would, based on my understanding of his performance.

Subject

is a maturo and competent officer who does a fine job of handling existing

operationa and adminiatrativo taska but has not been very aggressivo in

The aleepy tropical atmosphere of Managua may not

bo very inspiring operationally, but now business is nerded and Subject is ::

believed to ho capable of turning in a stronger performance in that area.

He has the potential for furthor carrer advancement.

There is no doubt about his being able to devise and

He did not, however,

the priority which Division

romovod Prom' immediato super-

vision of Subjoct and has worked with him only since October 1969.

In what follows, there is no difference of opinion botweon the

supervisor and the writer, and statements'not specifically at-

tributed to one or the other represent the judgment and obser-

vation of both.)

Subject is an experienced officer whose primary field,

on-1sland agents, is by definition difficult and frustrat-

ink and has recently becomo more so owing to developments

beyond his control.

Despite this situation he hay continued

to support successfully the most productivo Cuban In-place

FI agent that the Agency has.

The compromise of a major on-island operation during

the roporting period was due not

to any deficiency on

Subjoct's part but rather to a general lack of Agency

control over the operation from its incoption.

it is to Subject's credit that he wrote a candid

and thorough analysis and damago report on

the case (Writer).

It does not appear that liaison with the representa

operational matters has been used to its fullest

potential, although it should also be noted that

this responsibility is not purely Subject's.

Subject appears. to be a thought.lul and. er-

During his training, Mr. Piccolo has acquired a goud knowledge of

the principles and

techniques of clandestine operations. He las

demonstrated a good intelligence sense and a particular

ability for

handling agents.

He has had no supervisory responsibilitles yet, and he appears to

be cost-conscious as far as the undersigned can judge.

Employce returned to duty with the Agency In September 1962 after com-

pleting a tour of military duty. At that time he was assigned to TEW/CI.

Although employee expressed a desire to work in operations at that time, he

agreed to periorm the duties outlined in section B. He was called upon to

perform these duties because of the dire need within TFW/CI for someone

with his talents to establish and manage Branch systems for mall rousing-

control and Miles.

Employee was promised an opcrational assignment as

soon as the systems were established and functioning in an orderty and

efficient manner.

Employee has performed his dutice exceptionally well

and has established systems for mall routing-control, and files for the

Branch which are functioning well. It is strongly recommended that this

employee be assigned to duties of an operational nature and relleved from

his present dutles as soon as possible. Employee has the capability of assuming

addition lu his normal administrative functions Mr. Piccolf has been acting as a case

oificer on cortain senaitive and complicated clandestine operatite.

He has performed

these dutica in i superior fashion. It is my unqualified opinion that Mr. Piccolo

should recolve at least a two-grade promotion immediately. However it is

recognized that this is contrary to current Agency policy and therefore it is strongly

recommendod that he be promoted to the grade of GS-7 Immediately, Mr. Piccolo

is intelligent and extremely industrlous.

Ho has worked long hours performing a

variety of Important tasks. It is my opinion that Mí. Piccolo hau the attributes

required of carcer personnel working in the Foreign Intelligenco arca and that ho

should be pormitted to have his carcor designation changed to Fl.

Mr. Piccolo should

also be given the opportunity to receive Agency training so that he might be buttor

qualifica to porform lasks in this arca of activily. There is no question that ho would

become a professional case officer.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, LA Division

SUBJECT

:

Mr. Juseph S. Piccolo - Completlon of Senior

Operations Course 02/76

1. Mr. 'Piccolo attended the Senior Operatlons Course from 3 November

have not been used to evaluate student performance. The diverse background of

the students and the nature of the course materini uned in the SOC preclude

formal testing.

thon of the courac.

2. During the six weeks of che course, 59% of the time was devoted to

subjects and activities directly related to

operations, including 30% devoted

to "hands-on" time with technical equipmont and "on-the-street" practice of

tradecraft. 3l% of the time was devoted to material broadly categorized as

"ops management," Including about 107 on the Sovlet and China targets.

The :

final 10% of the time

was. devoted to subjects categorized as "management over-

view and ops support," which consisted of meetings with Do division and ataff

chiefs and visits to labs and other ops support facilitles in the Headquarters

area.

The ten officers in the class ranged in grade from GS-12 to GS-14

(averige grade 12.9), nverage age was 43.6 (Mr. Plecolo's age la 40).

The

class members' average years of Agency service was 16.8, and their average

years of overscas service was ?.2.

3.

The six weeks, normally 30 days of Inatruction time, wis shortened

to 28 days by the Thanksgiving

Day weekend.

Of these 28 days, Mr. Plocolo

apent aix days in Intensive training in Persuasion and Manipulation Skills

ag

taught in the SAl system.

He spent approximately another eight and one-half

days on technical tradecraft (photo, audio, and commo equipment familiarization

and usage) and street tradecraft (surveillance, car cous,

dead drop, brush

pass, etc.) Including three days Intensive practice of these skilla

in a live

exercise conducted in Richmond.

"Another flve days were apent at Headquarters

meeting with the chiefs of all DO divisions and staffe, and visiting

three

operational support laboratories in the metropolitan area.

The approximntely

eight and one-half remainine days were consumed by a combination of macel-

lancous operations minagement subjects, student seminars, and term paper

uriting (though the latter was accomplished sontly on the students' own time).

This running of the course was keynoted by remirks by the ADDO, and the

Headquarters weck was climaxed by an hour and a half with the DDo.

The gueat

speaker at the graduation dinner of SOC 03/76 was Agency Historian

De. Walter Pforzhelmer.

SUBJRCT: Mr. Joseph S. Piccolo - Completion of Senior Operations

Course $2/76

4.

Mr. Piccolo, as a 40-ycar-old CS-13/4, was at about the average age

for this class and slightly above nverage in grade.

Although formal grades

are not siven to graduates of the SOC, it was

the

consensus of DTS staff

Instructors Involved In SOC 12/76 that Mr. Piccolo would almost certainly

rank number one in this particular group.

Bringing to the class broad opera-

tonal experlence and understanding, Mr. Piccolo was an

active participant in

the six-day SAl block.of. Instruction and made contributions based on his own

operational past.

The tradecraft Instructors who conducted the live problem

In Richmond described Mr. Piccolo as the best student in street tradecraft.

One of the Course Coordinators commented that Mr. Piccolo, "exhibited, more

than any of the others, the ability to lead the group."

Mr. Piccolo's term

paper on the gubject of how a NOC station might be established in Rio de Janeiro

was careful and thorough and was described by the panel as

"an excellent overall

plan." To a man of Mr. Plecolo's experience, at least some of the course may

have seemed a little basic or redundant, but he never let it show, and always

took part with the same enthustam as the more junlor members of the class.

A copy of this memorandum is being placed in Mr. Piccolo'a official

personnel file.
