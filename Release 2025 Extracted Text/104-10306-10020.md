In your absence this memorandum was discussed with Mesara.

Helms, Houston, Miskovaly and McManue, and upon receiving

final approval from higher authority at 1:45, MI. Houston was

inatructed by me to initiate appropriate actiona.

It is exceedingly important that great care be exercised

to minimize the publicity and to emphasise humanitarian interest

on the part of the United States Government in securing the release

of the prisoners. Both the President and the Attorney General are

anxious that the explanations giventhe Cuban Families Committee

be handled with great care. I agree with this and urge that extreme

caution be taken to avold attribution or CLA implication in this matter.

MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

CONCERNING THE NEGOTIATION FOR THE RELEASE OF THE CUBAN

PRISONERS.

The meeting took place at the residence of the Attorney

General at 10:30 a.m., on Thuraday, November 14, at the DCI'S

request.

McCone explained that ha had had dinner the evening before

with Mr. Edward Foley (former Under Secretary of the Ireasury,

logal representative and a DIrector Of the Drug Industry Assoclation).

MT. Foloy had questioned DCI concerning the negollations

10x release ol Cubas prisoners in exchango for some 50 million

dollars in drugs, and statod that MI. Danovan had been in touch with

mombers of the industry (presumably Pfizer and Merck) in the past

few days, that indleations were that the transactlon was to be worked

out promptly, and the subject would undoubtedly be discussed at

longth at the Industry'a Board of Irustees meeting in New York on

November 16th.

Mr. Foley stated that the Industry had no clear understanding

of the Groverament's positios, most particularly in viow of Cuban

developments of the last three weeks.

Alter explaining to Foloy the background of the transaction

I tald him that MI. Donovan had been told to do absolutely nothing

in this matter and expressed great surpride that the subject was a

copie of current discussion among members of the Industry.

long as this money was on deposit and the letters outstanding, there

was a danger of publicity emanating from elther Donovan or the drug

industry; or both. Despite the fact that no official government

connection had over been admitted, publicity would implicate the

Administration and CIA in the negotiation because ol recent press

storios (most particularly the Herald Iribune articles) identifying

Administration and ClA activities and citing the exact amount of

17 million dollars as representing the Government cost of the drugs.

I pointed out that certain elements of competition between the members

of the drug industry made it almost a certainty that "leake" would

come from industry sources as long ae the letter of credit were

outstanding, regardless of MT. Donovan's denials.

Furthermoto, consunmation of the transaction seemed

totally unzealistic in vlow of current difficulties with Castro and 11

an article appeared indicating we mere still purauing this transaction.

the Amerleas publie and a great many others would ba conlused and

disenchantad.

'or the above reasons, and fooling that damaging publicity

undoubtedly would appeas. I strongly recommended that we arrange

for the bank to withdraw the Letters of Gredit, and for the withdrawal

of a subntantial part of the money from the Banklot Canadal Also

advise Mi. Donovan that the pursult of this affort must await a better

elimate although our Interest remained constant. I urged that

action be commenced today.

The Attorney General, alter some discussion involving an

exploration os possible alternatives, agreed with the course of

action.

We agroed that me should carefully explaia to the Families

Committee and possibly to Miro Cardona that we were ln no way

abandoning our intention to secure the relosso al the prisoners but

were forcad becaune of eircumstances beyond our control to ser the

negotiation aside ponding further dovelopments on other important

problems involving our Cuban xelationship.

McCons discused the above with Mr. Bundy who personally

approved the action and, in turn, received approval from bigher

authority. The latter was communicated to the DCI by telophone

at 1145 p.m.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Cline, DD (I)

SUBJECT: Castro as a Threat to the Americas.

I think that in analyzing Castro's potential in the Western

Hemisphere as covered by paragraphs 9 through and including 21,

we should consider his posture and potential under various alternatives

of possible United States decisions and probable Soviet policies.

Let us assume for the moment that the United States meets

the exact letter of the Kennedy-Khrushchev exchange and no more.

This would mean the withdrawal of IL 28s, the halting of the establish-

ment of

a submarine base, and some acceptable form of inspection

verifying the removal and assuring against the reintroduction of

offensive devices, U.S. commits not to invade. At this point U.S.

commitment on propaganda, sabotage, guerrilla activities and other

actions designed to overthrow Castro is not very clear, but I think

that we can

i assume that such activities if attempted would be no

more successful in the future than they have been in the past, which is

about zero.

TOP SE

## Page 10

13-00000

TOP SECRET

Having reached this point, the Soviets have at least three

alternatives:

One, they can abandon Castro, reduce military and economic

aid, cut their losses, and in such event Castro would soon collapse.

Current intelligence does not support such a probable Soviet course

of action, otherwise they would not be disposed to leave such quantities

of extremely valuable modern military hardware, including the SAM

sites, communications equipment, and extensive Naval and ground

equipment and a large number of technicians.

Second, they could maintain about the same level of economic

and military support as in the past, although I would feel this could not

be a very reasonable assumption from the standpoint of military support

as the presence of large amounts of additional military equipment, in-

cluding those mentioned above, would necessitate a higher level of

military

support than before in order to provide operational readiness,

training, maintenance, spare parts, replacements, etc. This does not

mean more economic supportalthough I think Castro could insist upon

it on the grounds that Soviet equipment is a burden to him and of course

Dorticos alluded to this in statements in New York.

Third, the Soviets having accomplished one of their objectives,

that of securing a U.S. guarantee against invasion, will increase their

military and economic aid so that all military materiel will be work-

able at all times and the Castro economy will be reasonably well off.

Under each of these alternatives, Castro's posture and his

effect on the United States and other Western Hemisphere countries

will differ vastly and I would suggest that your paper be oriented so

that it will project for the benefit of policy makers the consequences,

favorable or unfavorable, under these several alternatives.

It is my personal opinion that Mikoyan will return to New York

in a few days and will announce an agreement for some perfunctory

Red Cross ground inspection of the missile sites and nothing else,

will deny any intention of a submarine base, will dismiss the IL, 28

issue as wholly beyond the Khrushchev-Kennedy agreement, will

indicate that all Soviets are leaving Cuba except economic and

agricultural advisers, and will state most persuasively that the

Khrushchev-Kennedy agreement has been fulfilled to the letter and

demand our non-invasion commitment.

He will then build Castro up and indicate Soviet intention for

supporting in every way and to go right down the line with him.

- 3 -

TOP SOMET

## Page 12

13-00000

Castro will feel secure, his political and military structure will be

manageable, and Cuba will be used by Castro and the Soviets more

aggressively in the future than it has in the past in disturbing

Western Hemisphere countries.

This is the situation I fear, and I think our policy makers

whose negotiations are trending toward the establishment of a set

of conditions and commitments which will make the third case

mentioned above a probability, should have the benefit of our

thinking

as to the consequences. In doing this, equal attention

should be given to the first two alternatives.

In further reference to the paper, the historical background

is excellent, the country by country annex useful, although if time

permitted we might get the chiefs of station to give the current view

of their contacts as Win Scott did. The inventory of equipment is

useful but I propose that it be broken down into three columns, a

pre-July Ist, 1962,

added since July 1962, and the total as of now.

MEMORANDUM FOR: General Carter

You will note from the very brief memorandum of my.

discussion with Secretary Rusk that he made two requests --

the first, a study of the reasons for lack of action of the

Communists in Southeast Asia. This is a matter I discussed

at this morning's meeting and I hope that we can have an OCI

memorandum on my return.

The second question was concerning clandestine channels

to Castro, the Chinese Communists and Hanoi. This should be

given serious thought by DDP. Each situation differs. I am sure

we could; if we desired, open up a channel to Castro. The

Peiping and Hanoi situations are more difficult. In one respect

representative on the ICC; however this obviously is an "official"

channel and is not very productive. I think it would be well to

go over this matter with Dick Helms when he returns.

Secretary Rusk expects comments on both these points

next week.
