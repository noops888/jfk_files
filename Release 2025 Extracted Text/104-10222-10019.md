For the information of Headquarters and for

personnel file, WAVE wishes to express commendation of

mis contribution to the JMAtE project.

Beginning with

his arrival in the WAVE area in October 1960, initiated

an operational program directed to the establishment of a

Cubar intelligence

service, both for positive collection of

intelligence and to establish protective security on JMATE

operations.

In a remarkably short time citiesawas able to

recrult, train, and organize such a service which has

effectively responded to intelligence and counter intelli-

gence operational tasks, and has shown willingness and

ability to ably perform a number of support functions for

other types of substantive operations, principally para-

military.

In addition, the Cuban service whiche

organized is likely to be the nucleus of a post-castro

Cuban Government service which will serve KUBARK enda, not

enly on the basis of liaison, but by means of penetrations

of this service already established.

In the swift accomplishment of so many objertives,

Catchas shown executive ability, diplomacy, energy and

tmagination comensurate with a grade level well in excess

of his own.
