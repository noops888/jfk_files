3. Anong loadors of both the PPS and the General Unlon of Workers

and

Peasants of MexIco (UGOCH - UnIon Goneral de Obrerog. y

truth of the matter as lt has been presented in the press.

It la probably trus that arms and matorials for manufacturing

explosives vere confiscated.

It 1s probably true that indoc-

trination sesslond' on political and rovolutionary matters

probably vero hold in the houses whero: the arrests

were made.

And probably the group did have some kind of plan for notion.

But, It 18 simply not true that there was the alightest danger

of immodiate anú formidable rebellion from Rico Galan and his

Irlends.

4.

Thig. latter conclusion 1s based on the fact that Rico Galan

He 13 an aggrossive intellectual, a

radical, but ho is not in jail for what he has done but for

hia ideas.

As for Raul Ugalde Alvarez, named with Rico Galan

as one of the leaders of the group, he

has the reputation of

belnk fuzzy-ninded, a leftlet advonturer and cortainly nolther

brave

nor dedicated. Further, and Rico Calan 1a vell aware

ol this, popular support le assertial to tho success of rebollion.

None exists. The peasants are divided. The workery aro controllod

by the Governsent, and the middle-clans is content with the way

things aro.

also, there in the foruidable precedent of Govorn-

ment action against any kind of rebellion, trade unton, armed,

and particularly any sort of activlty which is Cuban-connected.

The Governent has always noved with energy, apsed, and affi-

clency to combat such threats as, for oxample, during the

Rallmay DorMore Striko or 1959.

Bevoral leadorg of that striko

There no doubt 18 a dogroe of truth tu pollce charges, but

OF GRANTING ASYLUM TO GUILTY PARTIES.

LOPEZ IS PROBABLY A SECURITY OR INTELLIGENCE REPRESENTATIVE AT

REPORTING IS BELIEVED TO BE RELIABLE.

1. PRELIMINGRY RESULTS OF AN INVESTIGATION BY MEXICAN

SECURITY OFFICIALS OF THE 14 AUGUST EXPLOSION AND FIRE IN THE

PEMEX REFINERY AT POZA RICA, VERACRUZ, HAVE REVEALED NO EVIDENCE

TO INDICATE ONO MIGHI BE RESPONSIDLE FOR THE EXPLOSION.

INVESTIGATION 1S HAMPERED BY THE FACT THAT SECURITY PRE-

CAUTIONS AT THE REFLUERY ARE ALMOST NONEXISTENT. AT THE :

TIME OF THE EXPLOSION OULY QUE GATE GUARD AND TWO SOLDIERS.

WERE ON DUTY IN THE ENTIRE PLANT.

LINE WHERE THE FIRST EXPLOSION OCCURED INDICATES THAT THE •

LINE WAS RUPTURED BY AN OUTSIDE EXPLOSION SINCE THE EDGES OF

THE PIPE AT THE POINT OF RUPTURE WERE TURNED INWARD.

3. THE EXPLOSION OCCURED AT A TIME WHEN MAXIMUM PROPERTY

DAMAGE AND MINIMUM LOSS OF LIFE WERE ASSURED. (SOURCE COMMENT:

HAD THE BLAST AND FIRE OCCURED DURING THE WORK WEEK IT IS PROBABLE

THAT AT LEAST THREE HUNDRED PERSONS WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED.›

4. ISOURCE COMMENT: THE CONDITION OF THE PIPE LINE AND

THE TINING OF THE EXPLOSION STRONGLY SUGGEST SABOTAGE. ALSO,

THE DANAGE IS MUCH MORE EXTENSIVE THAN THE PRESS HAS INDICATED

AVD IT WILL PROBABLY TAXE MUCH LONGER TO GET THE REFINERY BACK.

NOW TO PREVENT A GASOLINE SHORTAGE.)

Las leyes mexicanas, por su esencla demaert-

El señtor Rico Galán y todos los que como él

1. WE ARE STILL MOST DESIROUS OF EXPLOITING RICO GALAN TAPE.

DESPITE MEXI PESWING OEJECTIONS TO SURFACING IN NEXICO, WE BELIEVE THAT

THIS IS GOLDEN OPPORTUIITY TO START BURNING RICO AND THEREFORE URGE

PERHAPS ESPILL ONE OR IVEN PERALTA IF NECESSARY WOULD BE BETTER CHANNEL

FOR THIS THAN MINGOY SERRANO, SINCE QUATS RAGUND SUBUCT OL TAPE

DURING RECENT MINISTERS MEETINGÓ, THEY PRESCHADLS WOULD BE QUENIOLE

NOW TO LOCAL SURFACING.

2. ONCE SURFICING ACCOPLISHED GUAS, WE WILL BE IN POSITION TO
