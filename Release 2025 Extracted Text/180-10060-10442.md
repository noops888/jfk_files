Assassination Records Review Board

Final Determination Notification

AGENCY : HSCA

RECORD NUMBER : 180-10060-10442

RECORD SERIES : STAFF PAYROLL RECORDS

AGENCY FILE NUMBER

December 8, 1995

Status of Document: Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 18

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors

including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United

States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 6

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could

reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of

privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

Substitute Language: SSN

Date of Next Review: 2017

Board Review Completed: 10/24/95

Released under the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992(44 USt 2107 Note)"

Mr. Hitchcock is a very bright young man.

He

graduated from the Georgetown University Law Center in

May, 1975. He then clerked for a Connecticut Supreme

Court judge for a year. He did part-time work for

Representative McKinney and is now working with a small

Washington, D.C. law firm making $200 a week.

I was

impressed with his willingness to work hard

and his ability to fend off pointed questions.

I recommend we take him.

Dear Rick:

Con Hitchcock is very interested in working on the committee's

but he declined. I reconnend him very highly.

His work is superior

and he has a reputation as a tireless worker.

I would hope an interview could be arranged for Monday, December 6.

Thanks for your assistance.

MEMORANDUM

TO:

Tom Lambeth

FROM:

Robert J. Lehner

DATE:

May 26, 1977

SUBJECT: Con Hitchcock

This is to request a salary adjustment from $15,000

to $20,000 per year for Con Hitchcock. Mr. Hitchcock was

hired in December at a salary of $15,000.

The thought

of the then Staff Director and Chief Counsel was that after

members of

the staff were working here for a period of time

and we were able to evaluate their work, salary adjustments

would be made.

Unfortunately those salary adjustments were

never made because of the delay in reconstituting and re-

budgeting

the Committee.

Mr. Hitchcock graduated from Law School in 1975.

only other attorney on the King Task Force that graduated

that year was Sheila Jackson Lee. Her salary is $23,000

per year.

Mr. Hitchcock has demonstrated a quick ability to

assimilate factual situations, gives insightful legal

analysis of those situations and writes cogently in these

He is a definite asset to our team and one of the

brightest people we have on the staff.

I had recommended to Al Lewis this same adjustment.

Lewis agreed and was prepared to make that recommendation to

the Committee.

For the above reasons, I hereby recommend Mr. Hitchcock's

salary adjustment be made forthwith.
