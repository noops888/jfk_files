Status of Document:

Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 9

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors

including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United

States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 2

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Gentlemen:

For several weeks in November 1976, I worked with the Committee in the capacity

of attorney. It occurred to me recently that for the periods I was on the payioll, deductions

were made for federal retirement; however, at the time of my leaving I failed to execute

the necessary forms to withdraw those contributions.

At your convenience, I would appreciate receiving from you the necessary application

to withdraw the contributions made by me to the retirement fund. Please return the

necessary application to me at the letterhead address. Thank you.

Sincerely,

Joseph Kiel
