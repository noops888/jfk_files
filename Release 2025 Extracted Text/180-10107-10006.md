Summary of Contact:

Investigator Robert Buras met Mr. Atzenhoffer at his service

station and learned that he had joined the Civil Ari Patrol

Cadets ,Moisant Souadron in Sept. 1954 and left 1957. He

was a platoon Sgt. and used to call the roll and remembered

Oswald's name being on the roll. He has no recollection of

ever training with him or speaking with him, ana remembers

him being a quiet guy. When he saw Oswald on TV in 1963 he

didn't recognize

him but on one of the newscasts he saw Ed

Voebel talking about him (LHO). He remembered Voebel as the

man that Oswald was close too and stayed with at the meetings..

Atzenhoffer only knew Voebel from CAPC, not socially.

Ferrie did come to Moisant Squadron and teach some courses

and Atzenhoffer took his first plane flight with Ferrie. He

con't

Recommended Follow-up (if any) :

never got to know Ferrie very well. He went to one social

party that was given

at either Ferrie's house or Col. Jim

Salmon (James Salmon was killed in a plane accident 10-15-78).

The party was all guys and when they started drinking he left.

He was about 16 and his father didin't allow him to drink.

Salmon and

some others were seniors and Atzenhoffer didn't

et to know them. He remembers that ferrie flew at blue

Stinson that he kept at Moisant Airport, (Now New Urleans

International and they don't allow private planes there any

more).

Ferrie never indicated that he was homosexual in any way.

The only thing that he can remember that was not of CAPC was

Ferrie wanting the kids to participate in some kind of ex-

periment for Tulane University. They didn't do it.

Atzenhoffer was shown the photo book and related the

following:

#5. Clay Shaw knew from nesspapers.

#27. Looked familiar but name didn't mean anything.

#62. Melvin "Pinky" Seeling.

Knew from either CAPC or other

friends.

He remembers that Seeling's father owned a

large dairy farm in Kenner,

La. Last saw him a few years

ago.

Seeling

is in the Air Force and is stationed in

Corpus Christi, Texas.

Garrion's men showed him a mug

shot of Seeling and he was suprised to learn that he

had

been arrested.

A check of New Orleans PD files indicate that he was

arrested on August 30, 1961 and booked with Vagrancy,

given as 8-1-37.

The report will have to be ordered

from microfilm section.

Subject not identified in photo book except by last

name.
