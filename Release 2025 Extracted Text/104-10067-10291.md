1.

REF A CABLE ANSERS SOME OF THE QUESTIONS OF PRIMARY

CONCERN TO THIS STATION, BUT AT SAME TIME, IT CONFIRMS THE WORST

FEARS EXPRESSEO IN REF 6 CONCERNING REVELATIONS ABOUT OPERATIONS

AGAINST THE SOVIET TARGET IN MEXICO CITY.

2.: IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE, THE NBC PROGRAM CANNOT HELP BUT

BE DAMAGING TO U.S. SECURITY INTERESTS AND THIS AGENCY IN THE

FOLLOWING MANNER:

A.

REVELATION OF SOURCES.

THE STATEMENT BY BACH IN

REF C

THAT HE "HAD NUT IDENTIFIED ANY SOURCES BY NAME OR DES-

CRIPTION THROUGHOUT THE TAPING..." IS REFUTED BY THE STATEMENT

THAT A SOVIET NAS RECRUITEO BY FORNER COS (ROGER T. KINGMAN)

DURING HIS TOUR. APART FROM THE DESCRIPTION OF THE CIRCUM-

STANCES UNDER WHICH THE HECKUITMEMT WAS MADE, THE SIMPLE STATE-

MENT THAT A SOVIET OFFICIAL WAS RECRUITED IS SUFFICIENT TO

SET OFF A FULL SCALE INVESTIGATION BY THE KGB INTO EVERY

SOVIET OFFICIAL ANO SERVED IN MEXICO CITY DURING THAT TIME

FHAME. THE SOVIETS HAVE THE RESOURCES AND DETERMINATION TO

EVENTUALLY IDENTIFY THE SPY.

B. FUTUKE RECRUITMENTS.

HOW WILL IT BE POSSIBLE FOR

THIS AGENCY TO RECRUIT SOVIETS, ON ANYONE FOR THAT MATTER, IF

THE AGENCY CANNOT OFFER GUARANTEES THAT THE IDENTITY OF SOURCES

•ILL NOT DE EXFOSCO MY SONE EMPLOYEE, REGARDLESS OF MOTIVATION?

PHILE THIS PROGRAM KILL HAVE INMEDIATE IMPACT IN MEXICO CITY,

LA PALA AND NORTEVIDEO, THE FALLOUT AFFECTING FUTURE RECRUITMENTS

HILL BE WORLD MINE.

C.

REVELATION OF METHODS.

THE OPERATIONAL TRADECRAFT

AND METHOUS (TELTAPS) REVEALED

BY BACH ARE STILL IN PRACTICE ATY

THIS STATION.

WHILE IT MAY BE ARGUED THAT THE METHODS HAVE BEEN

EXPOSED BY OTHERS SUCH AS AGEE, THE BACH REVELATIONS WILUSHAVEN

FAR GREATER IMPACT BECAUSE THEY CARRY THE IMPRIMATÜR OF A

REPUTABLE U.S, NEMS AGENCY AND ORIGINATE WITH A PERSON WHO IS

NOT IN LEAGUE WITH ANY HOSTILE COUNTRYSCAS FAR AS WE KNE

DAMAGE TO LIAISON.

PUERABLE SEGMENTS OF

THIS STATION'S OPERATIONS ARE BA

ON LIAISON CO-OPERATION.

THE RELATIONSHIP THIS STATION EN

EITH HIGH LEVELS OF THE?

MEXICAN GOVERNMENT ALSO PROVIDES HUNTING LICENSE FOR

UNILATERAL ENDEAVORS.

THE MEXICO BOVERNMENT IS EXTREMELY

SENSITIVE TO THE POSSIBILITY OF EXPOSURE OF INSTANCES OF

CO-UPERATION, THE POLITICAL RISK WHICH THE GOVERNMENT IS EA

WILLING TO UNDERGO FOR THIS AGENCY IS NOT UNLIMITED.

EXISTING

OR POTENTIAL OPERATIONS COULO BE CURTAILED.

DAMAGE TO EXISTING SOURCES. IT REMAINS TO BE

SEEIN MOM MANY CURRENT SOURCES WILL CONTINUE COLLABORATING WITH

TE COL R AS POCPAM

IS RELEASED.

F .

EMBARRASSMENT TO PRESIDENT LOPEZ PORTILLO.

AS

IN REF B, THE MEXICAN PRESIDENT WILL TRAVEL TO MOSCOW ON

A STATE VISIT IN ABOUT SIX WEEKS TINE. AS A MEANS TO DAMAGE

CIA, IT WOULD NOT BE UNLIKE THE SOVIETS TO POINT OUT THAT

UNBRIDLED CIA UPERATIONS AGAINST A LEGITIMATE SOVIET PRESENCE

IN MEXICO ARE A MATTER OF CONCERN TO THE SOVIET UNION AND A

POTENTIAL IMPEDIMENT TO CONTINUING FRIENDLY RELATIONS BETWEEN THE

THO COUNTRIES.

THE PRESIDENT MAY CHOOSE TO FINESSE SUCH A STATEMENT,

BUT THE POINT WILL HAVE BEEN MADE.

G.

STATION SECURITY. DURING PAST MONTHS, HARDLY A

DAY HAS PASSED WHEN

THE LOCAL PRESS HAS NUT CARRIED SOME ATTACK

AGAINST ALLEGED CIA ACTIVITIES IN MEXICO.

WITHIN KECENT WEEKS,

THE AGENCY HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF EVERY CRIME FROM THE MURDER OF

PRESIDENT KENNEDY TO THE ABDUCTION OF ALDU MORO, THE NBC PROGRAM

WILL. PROVIDE NEW GRIST FOR THE LOCAL PROPAGANDA

MACHINE AND FURTHER

HIGHLIGHT CIA PRESENCE IN MEXICO WITH CONCUMITANT EROSION OF

STATION SECURITY.

H. FUTURF BACH REVELATIONS.

THERE PROBABLY IS NO WAY

TO ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF INFOGWATION THAT BACH HAS REVEALED

TU NNAUTHORIZED PERSONS. HACH ADHITS THAT HE HAS UNBURDENED

HIS

SOUL TO MIS FRIENDS, AND UNDOUBTEOLY HAS PROVIDED MATERIAL TO NBC
