2. Some of the operational Iniormation and sugrostlong offared by Tichborn

ura the following:

a: Thore appoars to be little chance of a coalition of the opposition

groups at this time of in the near future sinco they aro not well organized

and each group want would want to be the leader of such an effort. Also,

according to the manbors of the orposition to whon Fichborn talkod, 1t 1s

the general consensus of opinion that Fidol Castro is In no danger of loosing

his grip or the devotion of his followerax for sore time to come.

b. Fidol Castro soons to bocone most it upset and almost paniced by

defoctions. Possessing a "Messiah-typo complex" ho cannot bear tho thought

of someone loaving the fold. Rather than to let such defactious pass on

unnoticod, he fools compelled to give reasons and rake excuses. This then

blows the matter up perhaps out of proportion and quickly bocores a matter

of public knowlodge. Tichborn feels that the laducesent of deiactions coald

locatod in Carecas, Venezuola, who had been a teacher of Fidol Castro during

h1s youth. Castro vas in Venezuela and saw Father de Castro thore during

which timo the littor criticizod Fidol for sono of his actions. In spito of

tho fast that this rominstration occured in front of sons of Fidel's men,

and they laterthe litter treated him with great rospect. It was felt by Iichbern's source

chatted alone of this Information, and by Tlahborn, that Father de Castro undoubted

has sono influence over Castro, Tichborn supgested that 1t would bo of valuo to

determine whothor or not Fidel has chy regular contact with Father do Castro

b. Horb nathows, he is a journaliat with tho l.Y, Tings and was the only

American newspaperman covering

tho Castro story prior to his final succosa.

While Tichborn was In tuba, a front pago articlo fu appeared in Rovolusion

(tho regimo's press spokesman) on Mathews. It was a sort of editorial and

praised Mathous as & "roal man" and one who understood the rovolution and

Its alms. Iichborn fools that 1t might be to our advantago to got into

contact with Mathews sinco he appears to have the confidenco of tho

administration.

c. Profossor Rosco: Subject 1s on the faculty of the intveraidad de

Villamera and 1s a contemporary of Fidel Castrn. Thoy vero claosmatos and

both were dabators although according to Rosco, Castro did not mako the

Debating: Society of which he (Rosco) was the presidontonco after the

revolution, Rosco attended a sppoch Castro mado and aftor the oration, the

latter asked Rosco what he thought of 1t. Upon hearing sons criticism, he wantod

to know how 1t could have been inproved. Sinco Castro was leuving for

Vonezuela and the United States ho asked Rosco to arcompany him in order that

they could discuss the rautur further. Tichborn fools that Rosco (a ember of

the opposition) tux probably has more influence on Castro than Rosco roalizes

and that this jossibillty would bo worth looking into.

1. Edward i-Murrow: ha producod a-ll program on Castro and Tichborn fools
