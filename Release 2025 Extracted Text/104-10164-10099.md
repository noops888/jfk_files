SUBJECTE

REFERENCES WASHINGTON 173605

LEGALLY THERE IS LITTLE CHANCE OF CONVICTING BOSCH

AND

THE OTHERS BECAUSE THE CRIME WAS NOT COMMITTED IN VENEZUELA

SECONDLY,

THERE IS NO EVIDENCE AGAINST BOSCH AND GROUP•

OPINIONS OF A NUMBER OF STATION AGENTS AND CONTACTS INCLUDING

VENEZUELAN LEGAL EXPERTS SUCH AS MKALIKE-Le UKDIET-O AND

UKSCARLETOO,

WHILE HERNAN AND LUGO

SUPPOSEDLY CONFESSED TO THE

CRIME IN TRINIDAD, THEIR

CONFESSIONS ARE NOT ADMISSABLE IN

COURT AND THEY HAVE DECLINED TO REPEAT THEM FOR VENEZUELAN

JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES.

THE EVIDENCE LINKING HERMAN AND LUGO

TO POSADA COMES FROM TELEPHONE TAPS, WHICH ARE LIKEWISE

INAUMISSABLE.

BOSCH'S CONNECTION WITH THE CASE COMES FROM

• TELEPHONE CONVERSATION BETWEEN LUGO AND POSADA IN WHICH

THE NAME "ORLANDO" IS MENTIONED.

DEFENSE ATTORNEYS COULD

MAKE A GOOD CASE THAT THE "ORLANDO" WAS DISIP OFFICER ORLANDO

BARCIA AND NOT ORLANDO. BOSCH.

So

THE

GOV

cOULD. Of COURSE,

PUT PRESSURE ON THE COURY

AND

JUGGLE

THE

EVIDENCE TO GET

A CONVICTION.

BUT TO DO SO WOULE

LEAVE IT, OPEN FOR CRITICISM INTERNALLY AND REPRISALS FROM THE

CUBAN EXILES, AND WOULD

MAKE

IT MORE LIKELY THAT THE DEFENO

DANTS WOULD DIVULGE EMBARRASSING INFORMATION CONNECTINE

Respecto a sus instrucciones de indogar sobre las actividades de

Orlando Boch durante sus visitas a Guatemalo, paso a Informarle lo 81-

guiente.

El Embajador de Costa Rica en Hondusas, Edula Góngora, me dijo

(21 de noviembre) que a principios de este año recibió de su Gobierno

Instrucciones de averiguar cuales eran sus contactos en Guatemala. D110

que el propio ministro de relaciones exteriores de Costa Rica, Gonzalo

Faccio, le había mostrado un documento procedente de. la CIA (estas Pue-

ron sus palabras) en el cual se demostrabaja que Boch había tenido rela-

clones en Guatemala con el hijo del ex-presidente Ajana, Jorge.

Roberto

Asena España (Tito).

Agregó Góngora que ere muy probable que al contacto entre Boch

y Tito Arana se hubiera hecho por medio de los cubanos Gerardo Sampedro

y Moreira, con quienes al sagundo tiene negocios.

Recuerdo que, efectivamente, cuendo Góngora me habló de este asura

t0, 8 principios de aste alla (más o menos en mayo) me mencionó la circune-

tanala de que Faccio Pué a Guatemala para comunioar al canciller guatemalo

Comenté: Góngora tambié, que Tite Arona heodo Precuentes viajes a

Mans, donde as posible -dl 100 que pitiasa hecho amiatad con otros cubanos

Agraçó Góngora que auando se le comuniscó de pasta de au gobiesno.

que desde enconces no ha recibido ninguna otra instrucción de su Gobierno, por

includes representatives from Dade County and Miami po

lice, the U.S. Custorns Service and the U.S. Bureal of

Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Although the Federal Du-:

reau of Investigation is not formally a part of this task force.

its agents work closely with it.

With cooperation from Cuban refugees who are sick of

the terrorist violence, law officers haie arrested a number of

suspects. Police also have learned enough about other sus.

pects so that their freedom to engage in new acts of violence

can be limited even though there is not enough evidence lo

prosecute them.

A federal grand jury is interrogating witnesses who might

have some knowledge of terror opcrations.

Efforts of law-enforce.nent officials to deal with the terror:

bt groups face formidable handicaps, however. The terrorists.

seem to know what police are doing. Licutcruit Lyons:

relates that one suspect identified one of my officers who

had never met him before, called him by haric ind fold him

what section he worked in and what his dutics were."

Terrorists are protected by a seb of old loyalties: Most of

them worked at one time. or another for. the U.S. Govern-

ment. Many have had several roles: members of. the U.S.:..

Army, ClA opcratives and FEl informants. One refuger

leader suggests that law-enforcement officials have not found

the killers of Cubans "because they don't want to."

A further complication is the heavy infiltration of the,

terrorist movement: by: members of Castro's Intelligeiici

corps. They not only gather intelligence but sometimes act as

aronts provocaleurs, instiguting terrorist acts desigued lo

escredit the refuges and influence American polley.

The Cuban Prime Minister has "surfrend" chough of sich

agents to reveal their pattern of operation, Parly, this your.

named in Senate commiltee testimony as having bron is.

Castro blared the CIA for the airliner bombing and other

ucts of vinlence." "¡'ho else but the ela... can curry out

Sccretary of Stite Henry Kissinger has flatly denied U.S.

involveinent in the airliner bombing. He said: "I can state

categorically that no official of the United Slates Govern-

ment, nobody paid by the American Government, nobody in

do with this crash of the airliner. We consider actions like this

Officials of other Government agencies suy they scriously

SUBILGI

ACTION REQUIRLD - RLFERINCES

WARNING NOTICE-SENSITIVE INTELLIGENCE. SOURCES & METHODS. INVOLVED

We understand from press accounts that Orlando Bosch,

WKSCARLET-3 and several other. Cuban exiles were recently arrested

and charged with the sabotage of a Cubana Airlines airliner on

6 October.

After having read these account.s. NOC. Byron.W. GUTRADT

reported,. for the record, that he once knew Bosch and WKSCARLET-3

In the early 1960's.

GUTRADT met WKSCARLET-3 In 1964 when both

were enrolled In OCS at. Fort Benning, Georgia.

time had already terminated his relationship with BiHERALD..

While at OCS GUTRADI was not particularly close to WKSCARLET-3

but WKSCARLET-3 was generally knowledgeable of GUTRADI's back-

ground and past kHErALD activities.

¡GUTRAnT has not seen

NKSCARLET-3 since 1964 after completion of the OCS course and

doubts seriously that WKSCARLET-3 would remember him...

GUTRADT met Bosch circa 1963 in Miami when GUTRADT was

training Bosch in a BKHERALD-sponsored program.

Bosch only knew

GUTRADT In alias.

GUTRADT has not seen Bosch since complation

of this training.

Given the length of time that has olapsed plus the lack

of closeness to either WKSCARLET-] or Bosch, GUTRADI and the

station do not bellove that their knowledge of his past BlERALD

activities presante.any security problans today.

GUTRADT, Of

course, was unwitting of their alleged current activities and

vas surpiisod to hear of the bombing of the Cubana alclines.
