GORIES OF PRIORITY. FIRST, AID WHICH WE MUST CONTINUE TO RECEIVE

INDEFINITELY, SPECIFICALLY THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION; WE WILL NOT SEEK

A REDUCTION IN THIS CATEGORY, NOR WILL WE REQUEST AN INCREASE. SECOND

AID WHICH CAN BE EVENTUALLY PHASED OUT. THIRD, AID WHICH CAN BE

TEMINATED IMMEDIATELY.

C. ALL SHOULD BE INSTRUCTED ON THE ABOVE LIST OF

PRIORITIES BUT IT SHOULD ALSO BE MADE CLEAR THAT THIS. POLICY IS NOT •

INTENDED TO BE ANTIFOREIGN. FOREIGN AID WILL PROVIDE WITH THE MEANS

OF PRODUCTION SO THAT WE CAN EVENTUALLY DO WITHOUT CONSUMER GOODS

ASSISTANCE. WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT, FOREIGN AID WILL CEASE

SOONER OR LATER, AND SO WE MUST STRIVE TO BECOME SELF-SUFFICIENT.

MEANWHILE WE MUST

MAKE PROPER USE OF THE AID WE RECEIVE.

2. DURING THE LAST WEEK OF MARCH 1963 THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR ON

ORDERS FROM NHU, ISSUED TO ALL PROVINCE CHIEFS INSTRUCTIONS TO

ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO START. PRODUCING WEAPONS, LAND MINES AND AMMUNITION
