1. After considering several alternatives and given ORPHONE/1'5

lack of financial forward planning, ICPIPIT believes that it would

be beneficial and advantageous for WOFIRM to offer to subsidize a

portion of an overt life insurance program designed to give him both

life insurance and a cash value toward retirement.

We have dis-

cussed this with QRPHONE/1 and he has agreed to the desirability of

such a program. He is willing to participate in such an arrangement

and has undertaken to explore the possibilities available to him.

We are forwarding under separate cover a copy of several proposals

which he has received from the local representative of a reputable

WOLADY insurance fimm.

2. -MCPIPIT requests authority to subsidize up to 1/2 of the

cost of a life insurance program for QRPEONE/1. (This WOFIRM portion

not to exceed $50 per month.) Prom an administration standpoint

this would merely take the form of an increased monthly paywent and

we would take the necessary steps to verify that the funds were

indeed being devoted to their designated purpose.

1. On the basis of the documentatier sabmitted under reference dispatch, the

Medical Staff feels that QRPHONE/l mads a nurprisingly fast recovery and seems

woll on the way to complete health. However, the hospital report (a quick transla-

(lon of which lato English is attached for your ready reference), dated as it is, still

reflects some inconclusive levels in the resalts of the various chemical tests shows.

Undoubtedly these have by now been lowered to completely safe levels, since

ORPHONE /1 apparently felt well enough to travel to France, but the Medical Staff

bolieves it would be advisable for CRPHONE/l to undergo another series of liver

funetion tests, to include the following:

a. SGOT

b. SGPT

c. Bllirubin

(1) Direct

(2) Indirect

(3) Total

d. B.S.P. (Bromsulfophthaleia)

e. Serum Proteina

Albumin

Globalin

Total

We assume ORPHONE /1 has consulted his own physician on his return to the Uk.

but the Medical Staff has pointed out that clinical examination alone is not always

ratficient to determine complete recovery from hepatitis.

2. In terme of our operational atllization of ORPHONE/l at this time.

while they reserve finite comment until all the returns (per above) are in, the

Medieal Staff did stress the paramount importance proper rest and of not over-

taxing the strength of the agent, coupled with his strict adherence to regular.

warm, balanced meals in accordance with the dietary restrictions usually imposed,

and complete absence of alcohol, in order to prevent a relapso. So long as these

caveats are adhered to, however, there is no reason why he could not make some

more short trips during the next few months, if necessary. However, since he

also has an office to set up and we would like him to concentrate on the Kambona

offer, perhaps it would be a good idea to keep those trips to a minimum for the

time being.

The Medical Staff will be glad to review any further chemical tests per

para. I above suggestions, or any others which his doctor may have already run.

HEPATITIS BOUT

What I had thought was a touch of malaria and the extreme

fatigue I felt when I returned to London in july proved 12

time to have been acute infectious hepatitis.

- which takes tho to three weeks to develop - was probably

contracted in Uzanda.

principal contact in Kampala Insisted on taking me to a rimber

of local restaurants of dubious cleanliness to sample Uganda

delicacies.

My liver was swollen by one finger and blood and urine

analysis indicated a fairly severe infection.

Treatment

consisted of terramycin and cortisone therapy, with massive

doses of vitamins.

I was put on a lat-free diet, which 1 have been told to

follow for at least six months. Naturally, no alcohol.

On 20 August, I was released from the hospital, mainly be-

cause I was

pestering the doctors to let me go. ,? was

told to have *

"absolute rest* for four to six weeks and to

have another

blood test within several weeks.

REVISED MEMORANDUM OF ORAL COMMITMENT

1. QRPHONE/1 collaborates with WOFIRM as a Field Agent who

provides certain services of a confidential nature. He has

received 3 Provizional Operational Ayprovai, datea do lany 66.

Financial aspects of his activity are charged to approved Project

ORPHONE.

2. ORPHONE/1's employment by WOFIRM, which began 1 June 1965.

was originally formalized by a letter of Agreement for a period

of three months, replaced by a Memorandum of Oral Cormitment dated

Under this NOC, which remains in effect (as

amended) since that date. ORPHONE/l's employment continues on a

month-to-month basis. It can be terminated by either party on a

3. ORPHONE/ receives the following financial entitlements:

a. Compensation so computed as to give QRPHONE/1 a

"tax-free" income of $800 per month (this figure

effective 1 July 1967).

NOTE: The actual breakdown of QRPHONE/1's finances

as carried on #OFIRM's books is $800 monthly salary

and $70 per month tax supplement withheld at Head-

quarters to discharge ORPHONE/1'S WOLADY tax

obligation. These taxes are remitted through

the

Covert Tax Committee.

This procedure was devised

to honor the original "tax free" commitment made

at the time of his recruitment and at the same

time to fulfill the requirement that all WOLADY

citizens pay taxes on funds received from LNFORT.

b.

Reimbursement for operational expenses and travel

unless these are paid by other sources in which

case WOFIRM will offset such outside reimbursement

against WOFIRM financial obligations to QRPHONE/1..

Since security considerations preclude processing

of detailed accountings for miscellaneous opera-

tional expenses, and as an added inducement to

ORPHONE/1 in connection with his obtaining certain

confidential information of interest to WOFIRM, a

small operational payment, as authorized by Chief,

ICPIPIT will be made to QRPHONE/l for each day

during which he is required to be absent from his

home on confidential business.

NOTE:

Write-off of the funds passed to QRPHONE/1

is to be effected on the basis of the procedure

approved by Chief, ICPIPIT and COS/London, a copy

of which is attached.

This procedure is authorized

in view of the security considerations applicable

to QRPHONE/1 and the need to limit the knowledge

of this operation within WOllACE.

ORPHONE/1 is authorized to receive a non-accountable

office allowance of $100 per month.

NOTE:

This provision was included

in ORpHONe/l's criginal borter of Agreement and was retained in

this MOC since it may be operationally desirable for @RP HONE/1

WOFIRM has arranged for a portion of QRPHONE/l's finan-

cial entitlements to be funded to him by QRPURE, which has also

agreed to repatriate QRPHONE/1 to WOLADY. This has been done

for operational reasons to enable ORPHONE/l to qualify for

reimburse QRPURE for any costs incurred.

6. ICPIPIT is authorized to approve purchase by @RPHONE/1

of certain items of operational equipment which are to be non-

accountable and which shall be charged against the operational

expense category of approved Project ORPHONE.

7. QRPHONE/l signed a separate Secrecy Agreement (in true.

name) at the time of his original recruitment. He is aware that

its provisions are still in effect.

8. QRPHONE/l is aware that he may be required, from time

to time, to undertake an SGSWIRL.

of Oral Conmitment with the exceptions of paragraph 6, which

duriag the week of 25 soptember 1967, and you agreed to give CRPURE.I2

prior warning of this violt. In accordance with the same conversation

QREBONY /l was briefed that his visit should be mainly a question of

flonship (1.0., amount of money, amount of REBONY/l production for"

along the same lines, and also to indicate to him that, contrary to our

original thinking, we would not like to have DREBONY /l gives & by-

lino, ubenever ORPURE /2 feels he cas do so.

2. In addition to the above, we would appreciate it ll you mould

sibility of increasing the amoant of money funded to CREBONY ll via

ORPURE. As indicated to you, me would like to increase the carrent

$100.00 monthly to $300.00 monthly, but woald like your careful

examination with ARPURE priscipal(s) that this amoun: is not excer-

ORPURE's ostensible ability to cover.

3. Please also mention to ORPURE /2 our desire to have QREBONY /1

open a small office in London, and our thought of perhaps includlag

ORPURE (along with other publications) as a namo on the door or on

his lotterhead. Vioald ORPURE/2 (or CRPURE/l) have ery abjoctione?

Lo UREBONY? tas recruited by HOPACT On 3 June 1965.

recruitient was perfored by an officer frou WOMUSE/OG since

GREBONX/1 (then knows as STEBONY/1) was vieved as a "double agent"

penetration of pro Chinese corunist groups. UREBONY/l has per-

fored well in a difficult and dangerous environnent. He is a

clandestine agent operating against targets violently anti-HOLADY

and of priority interest.

The aGaIniStrAtiOn of UnabOsT/l rEquires

special care since, by the very nature of his role, he is not

typical of the average ICPIPIT asset.

2. CREBONY/l's initial employment was by Letter of Agreement

for a period of three lontiis. This letter of Agreement expired

1 September 1965 and was replased by a lemoransun of oral Colantuent

dated the save day. Inis oral euployment agrechent Ictains in.

effect at this date-sove two years later. but has been amended

to aljust coupensation. Certain inaccuracies in the orijinal

NOC have also been corrected subseguent to its preparation.

Given

the sensitive nature of CREBONY/l's relationship with HOPACT it

1s sometines difficult to adapt the operational reaiities of his

situation to the administrative requirements of WOPACT. However.

with great understanding at lons and in the field, we have reached

• Vasy manageable situation.

can be terminated by either party on 30-day notice.

3. OREBONY/l receives the following financial entitlementes

a. Compensation so computed as to give DREBORTY/l a

"tax-free" figure of $800 per month (this figure effective

1 July 1967) NOTE: the actual breakdown of QREBONy/1'8 -

$100 non-accountable operational allowance, $70 tax supple-

ment withheld at HQS to discharge QREBONY/l'B MOLADY taX

obligation.

These taxes are remitted through the Covert

Tax Committee.

b. Reimbursement for operational expenses and travel.

unleas these are reimbursed by other sources in which case

WOFACT will offset such outside reimbursement againat HOPAC? -

financial obligations to QREBONX/1. Since socurity considera-

tions generally preclude the detailed accounting for mis-

cellaneous travel expenses, per dien will be pald at the

rate of $20 per day during periods of authorized travel.

this per diem authorization was qualified by a personal

ruling of Chief of Station, Paris/ICPIPIT dated 12 July 1965:

"If subject la absent from his home station on

authorizod travel for part of one day and returns to

bis home station the night of the dame day (1.e. 11

no hotel expense is involved in the sense of overnight

accomsodations), then he shall be entitled to draw

1. ICPIPIT is revising the QREBONY Project files--which

have been rather haphazardly naintained over the past year or

so (much of this time the project was without a case officer).

In our attempts to locate basic project documents we have been

unable to find any copy of the provisions of the Operational

Approval applicable to QREBONX/1. We do have a copy of the • •

Provisional Approval granted 23 May 1966 forwarded with OFLW -

1591, 7 July 1966. Possibly the relevant document was destroyed

during the reduction of files attendant upon the ICPIPIT move,

or possibly it was inadvertantly not forwarded to ICPIPIT.

any rate we will appreciate being sent a copy.

2. We would also like to have a sterile version of the

Project Renewal as well as all other basic documents

ought to be available to ICPIPIT.

We are forwarding USC a copy of a letter sent QREBONY/1

by Jacques Verges' lawyer in which he makes a settlement offer

on behalf of his client. CREBON'/1 will probably accept this,

after a suitable waiting period, as it offers very telling and

effective annunition for use in his continuing battle to counter

Verges' allegation that he was a WOPACT agent. It is our reading

at this point that QREBONY/1 has been quite successful in this

effort and that this settlement fron Verges will be the final

triumph in his campaign.

Cher Yonsieur,

Mon confrère adverse, Conseil de la Société Nouvelle

savoir qu'il a eu une conversation avec sie VirGis qui lui a

indiqué qu'il vit actucilement en Algérie et serait disposé

à rechercher un règlement amiable des difficultés qui vous

opposent.

Il n'a fait part qu'actuellement sa situation

lui permet pas de payer en

une autre monnaie que la monnaie

algérienne; savoir le dinar.

Il y a là une question de principe. Pourriez-vous,

je vous prie, ne faire savoir si vous pourriez invisazer une

ransaction aux terres de laquelle vous seriez regle

on dinits.

j'ignore d'ailleurs dans quelles conditions l'exportation ces

capitaux d'alsáre est encore possible à ce jour.

Uuos qu'il en soit, peut-être seriez-vous intéressé

par cette proposition.

Je n'ai pas encore discuté de chiffres avec mon

confrère

adverse puisqu'il s'agit là d'une question préjudi-

cielle à

toute discussion sur le fond de la somme due.

J'attends done votre prochaine réponse et vous prie

Ref:

A OBLA 43,522,

2 July 1965

B DELA 43,802,

11 August 1965

The following is the text of a JAGUAR report on STEBONY/1

and Marc SCHLEIFER.

boat e151 on get so

JAGUAR states that the information was

received from a "most secret and delicate source which has been

"STEBONY/l was in contact with Marc SCHLIFER while the

latter was staying in London with his family, en route for

Algeria.

SCHLEIFER had planned to leave London for Algiers

via Paris on the 2nd June,

but he deferred his departure in

order to meet STEBONY/1.

It seems that SCHLEIFER wanted, 1f

possible, to visit Tanzania also.

STEBONY/l apparently was

prepared

to help SCHLBIFER and his family to find accommodation

while they were in London because they had little money.

He is

also reported to have said that there was a possibility of his

co-operating with SCHLEIFER in Africa.

"According to our source, SCHLEIFER, while 1n London,

arranged to contact the Tanzanian Mission, in connection with

& job in Dar-es-Salaam which might be taken by either SCHLEIF&R

or STEBONY/1."

2.

Ref A contains previous JAGUAR comments about STEBONY/1 and

SCHLEIFER, of about the same period.

While TIFFANY was in London

(which puts it at the right time) STEBONY/l was in touch with

SCHLEIFER, and TIFFANY

should be-able to compare JAGUAR's comments

with what STEBONY/1 said at the time.

Ref B reflects a different

contact between the two, from a different sourge.

B. DIRECTOR-66211, paragrash 3

At their 15 March seeting, GREBONY/l and RODIGIST discussed

OREBONY/l's running his own pro Chicos group, at least as a

paper organization to allow hin to gét close to target conferences

and institutions as a bona fide delegate rather than bystander.

UREBONX/1 feels that if not done right this could cause trouble,

because of usual organizational rivalries. Bo is thinking of

beginning by writing and circulating a statelent in support of

the statement on "Afro-American Liberation" which arpeared in

the E Decenber Ad Hoc Bulletin (Marxist-leninist) in Chicago.

He would use a pseudonym to sign his statement, but rould let

all his friends know that the pseudony vas really hinself, and

he sight use blanchanda's address. ferhas Grippa vould agree to

circulate or print it. If this staterent goes over, OREBOMY/1

could escalate into a suall organization. He will show RODIGAST

a craft of his statement, but also will discuss it bith Manchanda

for "ideological purity".

ACTION PIQUIRID. RIJURENOIS

At the time of his recrultment in June 1965, QREBOKY/1 was told that his

$600 monthly tax-free salary would be raised to $800 once he got a job in a target

organization, uhich of course vas the soal of hla planned sunner activity in

Alglers.

2. Through no fault of his own, the Alglers assignsent (and otber possibil-

1t1e8.

suca as Djakarta) evaporated shortly thereafter.

Meanwhile, WOFACT changed

1t8 signals and eventually decided to base QREBONY/l in turope targeted againat

Ind1u1duala and groups in varlous countries.

3.

Fron the begiming, QREWDiY/l has proved more than satisfactory as an

lie has carrled out assignsents given to his wich knowledge and tact and

the proper spirit, has used his own Initiative as much as our guidance, aud has:

not violated our instructions.

ão one uill argue that no hasn't proved to be

better than ve collectively thought he would be, and in teras of k1s oun

abllities-apart frow targets which nay or uay not be accesaible to bin- he lo

getting better all the tize.

to Last year, about a year later than (REBOKY/1 night have expected his

salary to go up from $600 to $800, ve raised 10 to $700. He was pleased, and he

has not cosplained as much as he used to about a shortage of funds. (Presumably

QREBONY/l is responsive to the generally good treatsent he has had, to the

respect for bie do an ludividual and tie appreciation of hie services; probably

he la carried along as such by bis own personal satisfaction in knowing he is

meeting requirements and continually breaking neu ground.

So fevertheless, LCPIPIT belleves the tine bao cose to raise OREBORY/l's

salary

to the prouised level.

We can all agree that ve are still getting his

BErVICEE CheaP: QREBORY/1 receives Do quarters, living allowance, or educational

allonance sor his children.

His increased gratitude, the rellef he will undoube-

edly feel at being able to reduce his present financial vorties, are nore khan

voxch the extra $100.

Robert Williams allegedly has $1, 000, 000 available for the use of RAM.

NY T-10 advised on September 26, 1966, that STANFORD prior to moving

to Philadelphia on September 18, 1966, discussed RAM and ROBERT F. WILLIAMS

with him. According to the source, STANFORD has alleged WILLIAMS has money

avallable for RAM.

During the course of the conversation, STANFORD stated that the contact man

between RAM in the US and R. Williams' is one Richard GIBSON in Paris, France.

STANFORD stated that GIBSON passes on messages from WILLIAMS and will be the

man contacted by whoever is designated as a courier to go to China to get the money.

Source also stated that he was told Richard GIBSON was living in the Obs

Crystal, Hotel (phonetéc), Paris, France, and was working out of the La Royale Cafe

Chief, ecs/NC

Reguest for Approval for Operational Use of

U.S. Free-Lance Writer - QREBONY/1

support for QRRBONY/1, an asset currently handled by CA Staff, and Involves

the cooperation of Russell R. DeBow, a Chicago city official and proprietor

of the Negro Press International Inc.

GREBONY/1 was granted a POA on 23 May 1966,

and a full operational approval is pending.

The project under which he 18

handled was approved by Acting ADDP on 14 June 1966. Mr. DeBow was Erented

& Covert Security Approval on 19 April 1966.

2. QRIBONY/1 1s an American Negro e patriate journalist and author

presently residing in London. He is the author of one novel and numerous

contrloutions to a vide variety of publication, such as the leayon Revier,

Monthly Review, The Nation, The Liberator and others. He worked as a reportoi

for the Philadelphia AIro American in 1950,

for Agence Frence Presse in 1959,

for CBS In 1960 and, In Furope,

for the now defunct, pro-Chinese magazise

Revolution. As & result of broad contacts and acceptance anong radical,

pro-Chinese and Negro militant circles, he has offered valuable access to

Important targets spanning four continents, and has denonstrated considerable

skill In elicitation and exploitation of contacts for intelligence purposes

In the process.

The immediate and paranount operational objective for this

agent 1s to gain direct access to hostile politicel targets in North Viet Nam

and China.

The outstanding requirenent to be met in support of this objective,

and of his continued effective exploitation generally, 1s the development of

& backstopped and viable explanation for at least a portion of his income,

which presently derives almost exclusively fron clandestine CIA support.

The proposal outlined below represents the conclusion of considerable research,

Including an Interview with Mr. DeBor, to Identify suitable cover arrangements

which would nake possible this explanation.

Jo Mr. Dejon, a lawyer, 15 an Administrative Assistant to the Mayor o

hicago as well as a long time, if casual, contact of Donestic Contacts Service

His background includes assignment to the

Intelligence Division of the Chicago

police and cooperation with CIA in the course of a trip to Africa in 1961.

Hr. DeBor also 1s part owner and in effective control of a very suall feature

syndicate in Chicago, the Negro Press International, Inc., which distributes

rewritten news to Negro newspapers in the United States on a subscription basis.

4. On 20 June 1966, Mr. DeBON vas approached by representatives of CA Staff

and Central Cover Staff, acknowledging CIA connection, and interviewed with &

viev to determining the feasibility of using his scriice to bacistoy modest

payments to GREBONY/1 for real or ostensible contributions of feature stories

and reporting. (Since the contact was made to develop information pertinent

to the present request for DIP approval, the interview was conducted on a

hypothetical basis: QRUBOIlY/l's identity was not revealed nor vere any

commitments entered into.)

This conversation, despite 1ts limitation, demonstrated

clearly toat such an arrangement involving Mr. DeBow and his firm would be

practical from MI. DeBow's point of view and well suited to the needs of the

QREBONY Project. Mr. DeBow grasped the problem involved and suggested various

neans by tnich he could plausibly implement a cover arrangement should this

be our decision.

He was made aware of and understood the incongruity between

his and QRASONY/l's ostensible political positions, and stated tbat this need

offer no inpediment to creation of the type of relationship which vould be

Involved.

The nature of Mr. DeBor's feature service and its modest size

clearly enhance its usefulness and appropriateness for our objectives.

Mr. DeBor, in conclusion, expressed his agreement in principle to participate

In this cover support activity should CIA, on further review of its needs,

decide to proceed with a request for his cooperation.

5.

In the light of the very favorable response fron Mc. DeBow and the

determiration, Iron reviewing the outlines of his operation, that it vould

be a miguely appropriate backstopping for QREBONX/1, your approval is

requested to recontact Mr. DeBow and establish vith him suitable cover

A number of lengthly and fruitful discussions have

been held with JIGUR officers regarding our continued

running of CRIEONY in the U.k.

Their comments on the

quality of CRaONY's reporting hal been reported Iron time

to time.

similarly, ve will not duell here on the nechanical

arrangements we have evolved (with SIOTH's agreement) to

expedite the passage of infornation to JAGuAR, on the one

hand, and avoid duplicate reporting (prinicpally by passing

the

same materials as us dissens to subti, on the other

hand.

Suffice it here to say that achleving both of these

goals,

without conpronising CRRECHY as a source throughout

both JAGUAR and S!OTH (due largely to the wide range of

areas he reports on), 1s a compler problem.

le think we

have reached a mutually satisfactory arrangement for

achieving both ains.

possible."

JAGUAR pointed out that CRUBONY operates in the

Bame areas as some of jiGual's own agents,

and this necessitates

a falt amount of frankness regarding his activities 1n the

U.k.

He have made every effort to date to display to them

that frankness.

In returo, JAGUAR has been cooperative, 1f

not downright helpful.

In one of our discussions, StILL

confidentially stated that one of their sources had quoted

a sub-source as saying that CRABONY had admitted tohin that

he is a KUBARK agent.

We assured JaGlida

that GREBONY is

under instructions not to reveal his KUBARK relationship,

of course; that QRZBONY is not supposed to be recruiting any

sub-agents and has not done so; that the remark could well

have been made in jest, in reference to the charges levelled

against GRISONY three years ago (or longer). tie told JAGUAR

that it would obviously be advantageous for

us to know to

Thon QRIBONY is alleged to have made the statement, and ve

would be grateful if JAGI3 could tell us.

We have repeated

this

request in writing, but with no reply to date.

stated at the time

SHILL

that he had doubts about whether they

could identify to us the person who had made the statement; he

was sure that they could not go back to their agent for

elaboration without showing an undue interest in SRIBONY. He

may yet hear who the person vas.

All this is rapeated here

merely to indicate how

far JAGUAR w1l1. go to be helpful, and

how far, to date, they will not go.

A. QRBONY/ (Q) gives the convincing impression that he is at home

in his new work. He responds sell to su; estions and instructions, adds

suggastions of his own ior i-proving the =lan-- an indication that he

wishes to please. in the begiring he storea a tenuency to raise minor

objections involving personal zaterial problems (e.:, Inconvenience to

family life oi a long tdy) but less of this was renarked as he cane to

realize that requirements were to be reasonable and he was to te treated

as a haman being with his on problems.

He has stated that he sould not continue his present involvement

with target personalities and institutions if it were not that re wish

him to, l.e., his oin inclination would te to withdraw irom the political

fringe. Podigast feels that this is consistent hith his background,

which has not a party career; in his youth he was willfully apolitical

and hostile to the "rovement"; later he ves involved in opposing party

people in his lew York work; in Faris he didn't get along wit.. his party

friends (the affair oi the forged letter) and oi course broke with the

magazire crond there.

He seems to be genuinely comnitted to working against erenies

of CDYuke, ready to accept eve- deeper comitient; he has expressed

no reservations as to what he vill do. He doesn't object to reporting

on old friends, fello: BRIEs,

PLUTTEd, or using s/w techniques (which he took with him on a trip to what

was then a very hostile area, ihere he has known enenies, and where

there has a recent history oi sealing roughly with outsiders). shen

orders contlict tith personal desires (for example, when he planed to

spend a weekend in a city he enjoys but ras told he should proceed

Imediately to his next stopping place), he obys without hesitation.

the foregoing is a collection of discellaneous facts, cut taken

together they paint the portrait of a promising agent, both in terns

oi motivations and abilities.

АТТОБРВСТІ

B. Rodigast's knorl:de of @'s a-vitude in the months prior to.

recruitrent (June 1905) is limited. Rodigest has the impression & had

simply reached the end of his rose-- he had nowhere to go, he had

earlier decided that he would iike to work for or at least cooperate with

ODYOKs (although earlier attespis to maxe contact met with no success) .

The humane treatment received at the hands oi his recruiter, the

subsequent sympathetic handlin; by his case oilicer, undoubtedly

convinced hir that he had not nade a mistake.

The material factor is

not to be underestinated.

The dezoralizing position

oi lirinz on his wire

and worse, on her fanily,

must have lowered his resistance to any possible alternative. Rodigast

simply doesn't know hor @ might have responded to a reasonable offer

from enesies of ODYCK: at that point. The prospect of immediate engagement

at a decent wage may have been cecisive.

Since that time, Rodigast feels @'s motivation has been reinforced

and perbass considerably altere: he has been asked to do obviously

necessary tasks, and so he can feel he is reeded by someone; he has been

given reasonable instructions on how to acc.nplish them; he sees that

others are concerned for his personal safety and material wellbeing.

Rodigast has taken pains to avoii giving the impression that there was

any coniusion or error or difference oi vientoint in running the project

(even at a time when there were alanty of all three); such problens were

resolved before being taken up with f, and thus he has a sonewhat rosy

vl:w of the operation. The satisfaction oi accos?Lishment (i.e., bein?,

able to produce userul answers to our questions) is surely a jactor

in his present attitude.

Though Light-skinned, with a voice and accent which would be

considered acceptable in any raPilil, society, & is extremely sensitive

to the fact that he is a liegro. He has not said or suggested any such

thing to rodigast, but this is so obvious a lactor in his correspondence

(even discounting the extent to which the correspondence is part of

his conscious cover) that it seems to Rodigas: that it must be a factor

in his life. On the other hand, lodigast has knor another liegro who

Q has published one; lodigast doesn't know much about the post-logical

that he would like to know about them, and just night be capable of

primary: A joined the orgenization a-u stayed with us because he could

not do as well in any other job, could in iact get no job (because of;

his background, his alien status abroad, etc). Fodigast does not exclude

this, although he feels that whatever the originai motivation, it has

been

strengthened and perhaps converted into sosething more worthy.

But even if his prinary zotivation renains material,

project over its lirst nine months suggest it is a viable one.

C. & has lived in the underground for so nany years without

breaking that it is likely he will be able to continue to do so. He thinks

fast, handles himseli well in matters presenting security problems.

He is not fully trained for clandestine activity. Fodigast's long

mestings with him alriays include advice on one or zore specilic aspects

of clandestine work, wrich then added yp may be taken to repr-sent a

short, course, but that is all. The lacs of training has led @ to do or

say things which hoalgast would not have wished hin to do or say, and

whenever possible t.is has been brought to Q's atiention, and he seems

responsive to such instruction.

Rodigast would not recommend that l be given a training course,

but this would not preclude more lornal sessions with Rodigast during

which Rodigast could give nore complete instruction on various phases

of clandestine work.

It is to ce hoped that the present situation regarding his wife

(who belleres him to be working for th= arch foa of : BERIMa) will be

possible to maintain. She doesn't like the situation much, but accepts

It, and apparently hasn't betrajed his "confidence".

If he is woved

(Rone) she would probably be even happier ard less likely to revolt,

financial straits (they can pay rent and buy lood but not save or

repay debts— so his wife sa;s he is doing an unpleasant thing without

even being able to say they are better oif than the; were in Paris).

If he rare sent to a less agreeable place for six months or a year

(say Dar) he roule went to settle his wife in a desirable place (London

but preferably roue) for the childients schooling; here too her attitude

would depend on their caterial cosition and on the possibility or

his being able to visit on occasion (if he were in Dar, say, and she

in Rome, he Hould return ior visits- which sould also be cover

for his neetings with his case oificer). Rod: gast recommends that once

the revolutionary nove-ent and tovard his on country; even though there

were opportunistic reasons ior him to have done so, he is see: ingly

not anti-BPRis. His views on liegro problems in PER-Ili probably have

not changed, but he never was a black nationalist, and has many friends,

besides his wife, tho are white). He might not agree with ODY " policy

In Vietnam, Cuba, or elsewhere-- he obviously has not been questioned

not disloyalty, and in any case should not prevent hin from executing

KUBARK policy to the letter. Undosbtedly be has a leftist econosic

orientation, but there is no evidence that it is an orthodor larst

one (or that it ever was).

He seens to like Rodigast; in any event they work well together.

He has made no effort to develop a warm relationship with Rodigast,

horever, apparently feeling that this is not necessary, night not

On the -ther hard, part oi d's satisfaction with KüBAR". might

derive fron a feeling that rubili is a "soft touch". Rodigast does

not recanend that anything be done to change i's opinion (if he really

does hold it); Rodigast feels that it are going to pay & as much whether

A appears to possess a realitsic, sane view or Odivis, what

background would lead one to expect. In any case, te have no

recent evidence to contradict his statement that he considers himseli

to be a loyal PBP:!:R; it may just be true. If it isn't, this won't

make any difference to the project as it is understood by Rodigast.

that he didn't like it.

E. Rodigast does not believe @ i3 at present vorking for another

it is possible that he would.

He has not written as many iree-iance articles as codigast iould have

liked him to, because each requires thinking out a subject, gathering

naterial, selecting a point oi view and thinking o: the public to which

it would be addressed- a lot of york lor articles neant to sem: nainly

as cover, for publication in obscure organs, or perhaus merely to be

used to convince editors that he as active. Or the other hand, he produced

the 1irst issue o. the nenslotter in record time. folloing instructions

to the letter (indeed, accesting what must at tines seem like petty

editorial changes nade by Rodigast). Ferha-s he produced the latter

so efficiently because he say in it added prestige, an opportunity to

get his name back beiore the public in a respectable context.

Idealogical totivation would not seem to be a level oi control

in his case, "hat is nost important is his contentuent with being (he

hopes) a persanent part o: a large organization, with a steady salary

(he has never said this, oi course); the poier of CDI Ke is less

important than its knonn reputation ¿or keeping its promise to pay,

and he finds new exa-ples of this daily.

Doubtless, his tendency to bear a grudge is a factor here- o

Rodigast feels that considerate dealing with l, letting

him knor where he is going, what he can expect, not changing the rules

In the course of tine, the ideological factor, rhich is perhaos marginal

Fe read A Spy and His laster by Christopher Pellt., and has

mentioned it a couple oi times when a renark by railgast reminds him

is not to depend on y ior such things, but to atteat to plan nesting
