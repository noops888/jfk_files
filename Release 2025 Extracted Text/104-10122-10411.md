2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

23 June 1976

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Security Analysis Group

SUBJECT

:

Manuel L. DE ARMAS

SF#591

865

Reference is made to the attached cable traffic which

sets forth the "defection" of the Subject to Cuba circa April

1976. In substance,

agent who had been recruited by a fnu BLACKENHOUSE (no Office

of Security traces) in 1969. DE ARMAS also claimed to have been

stationed in New York City in 1971 where he maintained contact

with BLACKENHOUSE and Richard TOMLEY (probably identifiable

rove hast novo Area

with Peter L. B. TOMLEY, Washington Area Recruiting Office).

In the cited press conference, DE ARMAS made many

assassination plots and

Venezuela and Cuba.

Details of these allegations are set

forth in the attached cable traffic and are not treated in

instant memorandum.

However, interest in DE ARMAS' allegations

concerning alleged CIA operations concerns the identities of

individuals that he claimed to have been Agency operatives and

assets; details regarding these individuals are covered in the

latter

portion of instant memorandum.

3. Agency interest in DE ARMAS was originally predicated

upon the receipt of a letter written by dE ARMAs on 12 september

1972 in which he related details concerning his anti-CASTRO

activities through his membership in a group called ABDALA.

The letter also contained a request for employment with the

AS a result of DE ARMAS' letter, WH Division requested

a Special Inquiry by the Office of Security for the purpose of

establishing DE ARMAS' identity, which was completed in October

1972. In May 1973 Office of Personnel opened a file on

• DE ARMAS

and apparently went through the normal routine of shopping his

file.

Interest in DE ARMAS terminated when TOMLEY sent DE ARMAS

a letter advising him that the Agency had nothing currently

available.

Then on 22 January 1973 DE ARMAS wrote TOMLEY

thanking the latter for interest following a telephone call

DE ARMAS made to TOMLEY in which DE ARMAS wanted to know once

and forever if there were any openings for him. DE ARMAS'

security file reflected no subsequent activity except for the

attached cable traffic following his "defection."

4.

Regarding the personalities mentioned by DE ARMAS

in his Havana press conference, it appears that several

individuals may be identical to

former WH Division assets, as

shown beloi.

It should be noted that DE ARMAS did not identify

any bona fide Agency staff employees or agents nor does it

appear that he identified any past or current operations.

It

seems likely that DE ARMAS was provided a list of known or

suspected Agency

assets by the DGI as part of Cuba's ongoing

anti-CIA, anti-U. S. Government campaign

designed to offset

adverse criticism to Cuba's military assistance to Angola.

Set forth below are those individuals alleged to have been

connected with Agency operations by DE ARMAS; results. of Office

of Security indices searches and file reviews follow each name

where

a

possible identification could be made.
