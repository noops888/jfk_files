N.. Mclean has bustness interests in

Dallas and

said that he is wiiling to expiors this possibility with

Mr. Nclendon if we provide guidance.

Mr. Nclean himself perhaps offers nore potential

Mr. Mciean is seeking

venture capital opportunities abroad.

For. example, he

and a Mr. Lincoln Epworth in New York City are working

with a Japanese named Ikvo Kasal who is President of

Nichimen Co. of Tokyo, a firm secking to

export to the
