Assassination Records Review Board

Final Determination Notification

AGENCY : HSCA

RECORD NUMBER: 180-10068-10363

RECORD SERIES : STAFF PAYROLL RECORDS

AGENCY FILE NUMBER

December 8, 1995

Status of Document: Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 11

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors

including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United

States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 9

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could

reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of

privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

Substitute Language: SSN

Date of Next Review: 2017

Board Review Completed: 10/24/95

Feleased under the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992144 050
