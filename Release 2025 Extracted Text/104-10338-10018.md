CURRENT INTELLIGENCE MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Cuban Subversion in Latin America

Since July 1963

Cuban subversive efforts in Latin America

are continuing at a steady pace, despite recent

major setbacks in such countries as Venezuela and

Brazil. From July 1963 through December, when

Havana evidently believed a "second Cuba" was likely

in Venezuela, Cuban propaganda stressed the inevi-

tability of Castro-inspired revolutions in the

hemisphere. Since the first of this year, however,

Cuban leaders have muted direct exhortations to vi0-

lence and have emphasized other policy priorities.

Nevertheless, the Cuban potential for subversion in

Latin America remains high.

2.

.In his speech of 26 July 1963, Castro re-

captured much of the militant tone of his speeches

in late 1962.

He made it clear that he regards

Cuba as the main source of inspiration and guidance

for inevitable revolutions in the rest of Latin

America.

He claimed

that what has been done in

Cuba can take place "exactly the same way in many

Latin American countries."

The hemisphere's mil1-

tants,

he said, must take advantage of conditions

presently favoring revolution and "open the breach."

On 28 September, Castro said that while "imperial-

1sts believe they can destroy the Cuban revolution,"

the Cubans believe that before that could be accom-

plished "many other revolutions like ours will ap-

pear on the continent."

On 24 November, Che

Guevara said the spreading of revolution in the

hemisphere "is also our responsibility and it is

part of our daily preoccupation."

3.

What emerged from these and other Cuban

pronouncements was the apparent conviction of

Castro and his aides that further Communist revolu-

tions in Latin America are inevitable, that Cuba

can speed up the process, and that in Cuba's own

interest it is urgent that revolutionary action be

initiated

wherever possible and as soon as pos-

sible. It is logical to assume that despite recent

official soft-pedaling of the issue, the basic

Cuban viewpoint remains the same.

Cuban leaders

continue to believe that the very presence of their

regime will inspire other Latin American revolu-

tionaries to action, and undoubtedly will continue

to give assistance

to these efforts.

4.

Cuba's policy of revolution in the hemi-

sphere has suffered severe defeats, however, since

the 3-ton Cuban arms cache was discovered on a

Venezuelan beach on 1 November 1963. For example,

OAS action stemming from that discovery is pending;

despite the Cuban-supported terrorist campaign,

constitutional government in Venezuela was

success-

fully transferred following President Leoni's dra-

matic election victory last December; and the out-

breaks of violence in Panama last January failed to

upset constitutional processes there.

The April re-

volt in which President Goulart of Brazil was over-

thrown was also a severe defeat for Havana.

These

reverses may have produced a feeling in Havana that

a breathing spell is necessary.

In addition, Castro

may have been cautioned to moderate his revolutionary

tactics when he visited the USSR last January. This

year has been designated "the year of the economy."

This and Cuba's all-out campaign to obtain

needed

commercial and industrial goods from West

also may be factors prompting Havana to lessen its

public expressions of support for revolution.

ver, Castro may believe that a soft-pedaled policy

on revolution now may pay dividends after the US

elections in November.

He probably assumes that

conditions for a US-Cuban modus vivendi--on his

terms--will be more favorable then.

5. Nevertherless, evidence presented in the

accompanying country-by-country index shows that

Cuba has continued since the first of the year to

promote, finance, and otherwise support pro-castro

groups and individuals in Argentina,

Brazil, (be-

fore the April revolt), Chile, Panama, British

Guiana, and other countries.

Indeed, on at least

two recent occasions, Che Guevara was quoted as

restating

familiar Cuban views on revolution. In

an interview published in an Italian newspaper in

March, Guevara reiterated that the road to "national

liberation" in Latin American must take a turn to

violence.

He emphasized that violence would be

"necessary" in "almost all" Latin American countries,

for "there is no other way." In an April interview

in Algiers, Guevara said:

"It is very, very, very,

very, but very, hard to achieve liberation in Latin

America by employing peaceful means."

6.

A number of reliable clandestine sources

have provided information on the many facets of

Cuba's subversive effort in Latin America.

The most

serious form of subversion from Havana is its train-

ing of other Latin

Americans in the practical arts

of guerrilla warfare.

This proposed congress--which, however, is

being officially discouraged by the Canadian govern-

ment--would be modeled on a similar effort staged

Before the overthrow of President Goulart, Cuba

providing funds,

guerrilla training, and propaganda

support to Communist and pro-Communist groups. Operat-

ing primarily through its embassy in Rio de Janeiro,

Havana collaborated closely with Francisco Juliao's

Peasant Leagues in northeast Brazil and with Leonel

Brizola, Goulart's violently anti-American brother-

in-law.

described Brizola as having the best prospects for

starting a Castro-stule revolution in Brazil. The

ambassador appeared to be favoring him over Juliao

Quick response by Havana to unrest in the Dominican

Republic also was reflected during the transit

ing in Cuba organized the 14th of June Revolutionary

Much of the pro-Castro activity in Honduras

neighboring countries make Honduras well suited

The Castro regime has been careful in the past

to avoid antagonizing the Mexican government, in

view of the importance to Cuba of maintaining its

embassy and its civil air connections through Mexico.

The Cubans continue to use their embassy in Mexico

City as well as individual Mexican nationals and

exiled Central American residents there to support

subversive activities elsewhere in Central America.

15. Nicaragua

Cuban subversive efforts aimed at Nicaragua

have been channeled principally through the National

Liberation Front (FLN), a Communist-dominated revo-

lutionary organization.

Most of this group's guer-

rilla leaders were trained in Cuba in 1961-62, along

with members of various other Nicaraguan revolu-

tionary movements.

Cuban aid to the FLN takes the

form of financial support, training, and guidance,

but details are lacking regarding its current size

or effectiveness.

In August 1963, the FLN launched

an unsuccessful guerrilla foray into northern

Nicaragua from Honduras which cost the small organ-

ization some of its key personnel. Since then,

the FLN has been the object of harassment by both

Nicaraguan and Honduran security forces. It has

shown no capability to make another move soon.

pressure on its contacts in Panama to cooperate in

starting revolutionary action.

Revolutionary

leaders of the Castro-supported Vanguard of the

Revolution (VAN) were urged as early as

the threatened banana workers' strike in October

1963 to cooperate in initiating an anti-government

Planning quickened after the early

November visit of Victor Rico Galan and possibly

other Castro agents.

Some of the approximately

100 Panamanians believed to have received training

in Cuba were planning to give guerrilla warfare

courses in December and again in May.

Clandestine reporting also discloses Cuban

efforts to influence the outcome of the 10 May

1963 national elections. Havana is reliably re-

ported to have provided

some funds for campaign

assistance to selected deputorial candidates of

a new revolutionary group in Panama

and to launch revolutionary activities in the near

future.

Some FULNA members have received

guerrilla training in Cuba.

A once-weekly pro-Castro broadcast in the

Guarani language has been heard in Paraguay since

mid-November 1963. The PCP is said to be keeping

two Paraguayans in Cuba permanently to enable the

program to continue to be broadcast in Guarani.

However, probably more exiles in Uruguay traveled

to Havana.

18. Peru

The primary recipient of Cuban assistance for

armed revolution against the Belaunde government is

the Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR), a

militant pro-Castro organization composed of

some

1,000 members and 3,500 sympathizers. Between 450

and 500 MIR members

Ing abroad

have received guerrita want-

them in cuba.

Police raids in

January and May Probably upset the MIR's timetable

for initiating anti-government action, but the move-

ment is well-financed, well-armed, and well-organized.

It has the

potential for carrying out a subversive

campaign of

considerable disruptiveness.

Luis de

la Puente, the leader of MIR, has visited Cuba on

several occasions, and is on

good terms with Castro.

Cuba has assisted other pro-Castro groups of

lesser importance, but such assistance has been

limited to guerrilla training.

One such group, the

Army of National Liberation (ELN), organized by

Peruvian extremist students in Havana, has isolated

bands of guerrillas operating in remote areas of

the country. The National Liberation Front (FLN)

is openly pro-Castro, and has sent members to Cuba

for subversive training. Principal FLN leader

Salomon Bolo visited Cuba last September.

Castro-inspired extremists have exploited re-

curring peasant unrest in Central Peru for the past

several months and they have been behind much of

the illegal peasant land incursions which have oc-

curred there.

20. Venezuela

The current level of Cuban activity in Vene-

zuela is considered fairly low.

International

reprecussions stemming fron the unprecedented dis-

covery of the

huge Cuban arms cache in Venezuela

on 1 November 1963, the failure of the terrorist

campaign to disrupt the December national elections,

and the presently increased capabilities of the

Venezuelan military and

security forces will prob-

ably dampen Cuban activities in Venezuela in the

short run.

There is no reason to believe, however,

that these setbacks will alter Venezuela's high

priority on Cuba's target list for subversion.

Cuban support for the militantly pro-Castro Armed

Forces of National Liberation (FALN) doubtlessly

will continue, and may even increase.

The FALN gives signs of stepping up its activi-

ties, but on a lesser scale than at the end of 19b3.

of the Communist party to continue using violence

as a political instrument probably presages a gradual

increase of terrorist incidents.

Riots in mid-May

led by Communist-dominated students took place in

Caracas, San Cristobal, and Merida. At the same

time, one successful student-led robbery of a post

office occurred, as well as an attempted robbery

of the university payroll.

Robberies have been the FALN's favorite means

in the past to obtain money to finance its terrorist

activities.
