XXXXX DETAILS:

On 12 November 1969, KARL D. ACKERMAN (former Counselor for Administration,

United States Embassy, Bangkok, Thailand), 99 Victoria Drive, Atherton, California,

was interviewed by SA ROBERT I. NOVACK and the writer, and related substantially as

follows:

ACKERMAN had several conversations with Colonel WALTER ADAMS concerning the

practical problems of getting weapons, belonging to a MITCHELL L. WERBELL, into

Thailand from the Republic of Vietnam in order that WERBELL could put on a fire power

demonstration for the King of Thailand's birthday..

At all times during these conversa-

tions, ACKERMAN assumed the weapons were WERBELL's wares, and that he had

brought them from the United States with him. With this in mind; ACKERMAN stated

that he instructed Mr. GERALD T. CARTA to annotate WERBELL's travel orders with a

Bangkok United States Embassy Funding Citation number. ACKERMAN said the citation

numbers were in a block of numbers belonging to the Embassy, and because he did not

feel he had the authority to issue WERBELL any other type of number, he issued him an

Embassy number. When ACKERMAN was asked if he knew PAUL ARNOLD MARRIOTT, he

said the name was vaguely familiar but could not recall anything further. When

ACKERMAN was asked if he knew EARLENE DOBBS, he stated that he did not, to the best

of his knowledge. ACKERMAN stated that his knowledge of WERBELL came solely from

ADAMS and other stories he heard around the Embassy of the fire power demonstration

to be given for the King. ACKERMAN stated he had no personal knowledge of WERBELL.

SYNOPSIS

Information re: WERBELL, as contained in files of OSI District 50, obtained

and set forth.

CARTA advised WERBELL, during Jan 69, requested his assistance

in shipping various captured enemy automatic weapons and official equipment

from Saigon to Bangkok. WERBELL was traveling on a U. S. Invitational Travel

Order, without funding citation, authorizing space available travel only from

Bangkok to Saigon and return.

CARTA stated WERBELL told him he had collected

the weapons while in northern sectors of RVN, with U. S. Army Airborne and

special forces units. Packaging and preparation of Transportation Control and

Movement Documents (TCMD) were prepared by U.S. Embassy, Saigon. CARTA did

not know why one TCMD reflected antique arms when contents were known to be

automatic weapons. CARTA received authorization and funding citation number

for WERBELL's shipment from the Counselor for Administration, U.S. Embassy,

Bangkok.

This was only shipment processed by CARTA for weRBeLl.

CARTA did

not know of or process any shipments for SUBJECT and/or SIONICS, INC.

DETAILS

1. On 20 September 1969, Mr. GERALD T. CARTA, Staff Operations Officer, U.S.

Embassy, Saigon, Republic of Vietnam (RVN)., was interviewed with the assistance of

SA RONALD A. CUNDIFF and provided the following information:

During early January 1969, a Mr. MITCHELL WERBELL, a senior officer in an

American firm (NFI), came to his office requesting assistance in shipping one or

two cartons of captured automatic weapons to Bangkok, Thailand. WERBELL stated

that he was a weapons expert and was in the RVN on invitation from the U.S. Govern-

ment

to demonstrate some of his new

weapon accessory inventions to the military

services of the RVN and Thailand. WERBELL indicated that he had just spent the

last 2-4 weeks in various northern sectors of the RVN, with U.S. Army Airborne and

Special Forces units. During this period WERBELL had collected various captured

enemy automatic weapons. He advised that he needed these weapons for examination,

in that he was in the process of designing a new automatic weapon that would far

automate upon that son tar

surpass the capabilities of the best foreign made automatic weapon. WERBELL pro-

duced an Invitational Travel Order, issued by the USAF Air Attache, Bangkok,

Thailand. This travel order was approved by the Counselor for Administration (CFA),

U.S. Embassy, Bángkok, Thailand, This travel order authorized WERBElL to travel,

on a space available basis, from Thailand to the RVN and return. The travel order

did not reflect a funding citation, which is necessary to ship any large items

aboard a military aircraft. WERBELL stated that he had attempted to ship these

weapons aboard military aircraft stationed at Tan Son Nhut AB (TSNAB), RVN, how-

ever, because his orders did not reflect the necessary funding citation, he was

sent to the U.S. Embassy. WERBELL indicated he was going to use these captured

weapons in a fire power demonstration, to be held for the king of Thailand on his

birthday, which was on the following Saturday. WERBELL stated he was a personal

friend of the King and Queen of Thailand and numbered among his friends many high

a the no 1 ming at ang

ranking military and civilian officials of the Thai government. CARTA placed a

long distance call to the CFA, U.S. Embassy, Bangkok, Thailand. The CFA advised

that WERBELL was expected in Thailand by the King for a weapon demonstration, to

be held on the King's birthday. The CFA was informed that WERBELL wanted to

one or two heavy cartons to Thailand. The CFA then gave CARTA the Bangkok U.S.

Embassy funding citation, with instructions to have same added to WERBELL's

travel orders. He then asked the CFA: "Do you know what he wants to ship?" and

Ine to here gave cided to a to this

ship

the CFA replied: "Yes, it's okay".

After this conversation the weapons were

packed, along with some items of official equipment, as identified by WeRBELL.

Transportation Control and Movement Documents were executed and signed by CARTA.

The U.S. Embassy, Bangkok, Thailand, funding citation was reflected on these

documents.

At no time did CARTA examine the contents of the boxes. CARTA iden-

tified the Transportation Control and Movement Documents reflected as attachments

1 and 3, ROI, DO7, 2 Sep 69, as the ones executed and signed by him.

CARTA could

provide no explanation as to why one of the Transportation Control and Movement

Documents (Atch 1) reflected the contents as antique arms. CARIA stated that he

knew of no other shipments of firearms that had been processed by WERBELL. He

concluded that he does not know SUBJECT, nor has he ever processed any shipments

under SUBJECT's name or for SIONICS, INC.

2. On 24 September 1969, a review by SA CUNDIFF of case file 50D24G-133, of

which WERBELL is the SUBJECT, revealed the following information:

WERBELL was in the RVN in an unofficial status, with the concurrence of ASD,

Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, to demonstrate a noise and flash suppressor assembly for

the M-16 rifle, as well as other firearms equipment.

He possessed no security

clearance. He was to demonstrate his equipment only in the RVN and was then to

return to

the U.S. Upon his arrival in the RVN, he was given a Military Assistance

Command Vietnam (MACV) Identification and Privilege Card (MACV Form 6) for use

while in country. The application for this card was filled out by Col WILLIAM M.

FAGAN, Commander, Det 6, ASD, ISNAB, RVN. The card, to expire Mar 69, was only to

reflect WERBELL was to have BX privileges, and no grade or rank was reflected

intentionally.

The card that was finally

• issued reflected equivalent rank of GS-16

and gave WERBELL postal, BX, commissary and check privileges for a period of one

year, to Sep 69.

The application form was adjusted to show this and someone other

than FAGAN placed FAGAN's initials in the appropriate blocks to obtain these privi-

SUBJECT was the individual who met WERBELL upon his arrival in country, and

who took care of getting his weapons registered in accordance with MACV directives.

SUBJECT also set up the demonstrations WERBELL was to give.

At the conclusion of the demonstrations, rather than return to the U.s.,

WERBELL traveled to Bangkok and Korea, utilizing his MACV. ID card and dropping

names of alleged acquaintances of high reputation in order to show his equipment

in those countries.

FAGAN obtained the MACV ID card from WERBELL in Bangkok on

8 May 69.

3. On 24 September 1969, a review by SA CUNDIFF of 50D24G-0/86 revealed the fol-

lowing information concerning WERBELL:

FAGAN advised that in Jan 69, WERBELL stated he had captured weapons he

wanted to ship back. FAGAN told

him he would help through legitimate channels if

the weapons were for a government agency; otherwise, he would ship back only the

equipment WERBEII brought over. FAGAN heard no more from WERBELL until early

Feb 69, when WERBElL stated he was ready to leave and would bring the items to be

shipped. He was told by FAGAN to bring the items in an open box, which would be

sealed at the aerial port.

FAGAN was unable to locate WERBELL after that meeting until & May 69, when he

located WERBELL in Bangkok to retrieve the MACV ID card.

WERBELL requested FAGAN

to ship some gear from Saudi, Arabia, to the U.S. FAGAN again replied he would

ship back only the original equipment from TSNAB.

The files contained no further information pertinent to the present investiga-

tion.
