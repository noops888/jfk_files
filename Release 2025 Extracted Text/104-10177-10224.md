1- OBYEDKOV ACTED AS A GUARD AT THE SOVIET EMBASSY IN MEXICO

CITY, ALTHOUGH HE APPEARED TO BE BETTER. EDUCATED THAN HIS DUTIES AS

A GUARD WOULD DEMAND. AMONG HIS MAIN DUTIES, HE TENDED THE SOVIET

EMBASSY TELEPHONE, STOOD GUARD DUTY AT THE GATE, TOOK MESSAGES FOR SERER

OTHER SOVIETS, NOTIFIED THEM OF MEETINGS, AND ARRANGED APPOINTMENTS.

HE ALSO OCCASIONALLY DROVE ONE OF THE EMBASSY CARS ON ERRANDS.

DURING HIS TEHRAN TOUR, HE WAS ALSO LISTED AS A GUARD AT THE SOVIET

EMBASSY. HE WAS OBSERVED TO BE VERY SECURITY CONSCIOUS. Y

•

2. ON BOTH PRECEDING TOURS OBYEDKOV APPEARED TO FUNCTION AS A

LEGITIMATE GUARD AND WAS NEVER OBSERVED IN THE ACT OF PERFORMING

ANY INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE A SOVIET IS LISTED AS A GUARD

AT A SOVIET EMBASSY, IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT HE IS NECESSARILY A

KGB OFFICER. SINCE WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT

AN INTELLIGENCE

AFFILIATION WE WILL NO LONGER CARRY HIM AS SUSPECT RIS, PROBABLY KGB.

1. For your information, we no longer carry Ivan Dmitriyevich OBSEDKOV

(201-779195), guard at the Soviet Embassy in Tehran, as PCS. lie was not listed

on ROGH'EN's April 1971 Presence List nor their December 1971 list. We assume

he has departed PCS.

&. During OBYEDKOV's tour in Tehran his wife,. Yelena, served as principal

at the Soviet school. His son was apparently in Moscow living with Yelena's mother.

On 29 Octuber 1969, ROARC reported the grandmother calling to check with OBYEDKOV

regarding a tutor for the child. They discussed the possibility of the tutor coming

for three times a week, at five rubles per hour, but OBYEDKOV, after checking with

his ife, decided on two times a week. OBYEDKOV seemed to be very fond of his

mother-in-law. According to our AESCREEN transcriber, she was the only one that

could tell OBYEDKOV what to do.

3. The following are comments made by our AESCREEN transcriber on OBYEDKOV

on 8 Jaly 1970:

"He is very security conscious, especially in dealing with "official people" or

superiors. He mentions his name to his friends freely, but refuses to say his name

when he knows that one of the superiors is calling,

"this is the duty officer' OBYEDKOV

would say several times. He often lectures people when they violate security regulations

when talking on the telephone. OBSEDKOV has to be persuaded several times or even

here was Rafik Nazhaf-Ogly ABDULLASEV (201-30852), Third Secretary, suspect

10. PERSOVALITY, CHARACTER, AND HABITS:

Although Subject acted

as a guard at the Soviet Embassy

in Mexico, he appeared to be fairly well educated and was

not subservient to any of the other Soviets, with the

exception of Counselor Boris Aleksandrovich KAZANTSEV .

(201÷028975). On one occasion Subject was reported to be

helping the daughter of Commercial Counselor Georgiy

Stepanovich VISKO with her arithmetic homework. On another,

Subject was

asked

about methods of producing metal wire,

a subject

on which

Subject was well informed as a result of

his having once worked for a wire factory.

Subject had

a tape recorder at home which he liked to

• listen to.

le also occasionally went fishing with other Soviets. •

Subject told "Boris" in Moscow to build a large garage,

because he was bringing a big car back with him. He also

asked whether Boris had bought a refrigerator and TV for the

apartnent. On another occasion he was negotiating for a can

of paint to tako bagk to Moscow with him to repaint "che

Moskvich".

Subject and his wife were both buying watches

just before leaving Mexico. From the above it appears

that Subject was fairly well-off financially, for a guard.

12. INTELLIGEYCE AFFILIATION:

Mexico City Station considers Subjecz suspect RIS because

ne appears better educated that his duties as a guard would

demand, because he seems financially better off than other

Soviet guards and because of his apparent association on

equal footing with Soviet KIS officers. DERYABIN in 1955

advised LVERGO that the surname OBYEDKOV was familiar to him

as the nane of a person who was in the Guards Directorate of

the MVD in 1951.

In September 1967 DERYABIN and RASTVOROV said that they

neither recognized the face nor the name of the Subject.

(Both Ivan Ivanovich and Ivan Umitriyevich were seen by the

defectors and they did not recognize either of then.)

13. INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITY:

There was no intelligence activity noted on the Subject's

part while he was stationed in Mexico.

14. SON-INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITY:

Subject primarily handled the main Soviet telephone and

cook zuard duty at the gate. Subject took messages for other

soviets, notified them of meetings, and contacted them for

anpointrents with each otner. He occasionally drove one of

In addition, LIENVOY reported that on 17 August 1965 that "a new school

OBYEDKOVA' had previously been the

director of the Soviet school in Mexico, and the fact that she had been replaced

indicates that she will not retur to Mexico. The identity of the new school

assumed to be identical. No date of birth is availale for the OBYEDKOV in
