DAVID G. MARWELL

Biographical Information

On July 1, 1994, the Berlin Document Center (BDC) was transferred to the German

Federal Archives (Bundesarchiv) marking the end of nearly 48 years of American control

of this unique organization. With an estimated 25 million Nazi-era personnel-related files,

the BDC was once a crucial source of evidence for the Nuremberg Trials and is today an

incalculably important source for the study of the Third Reich. The transfer also marked

the end of David Marwell's tenure as Director of the BDC.

A well-trained scholar with a PH.D. in History, Marwell came to Berlin in 1988 from

the Office of Special Investigations (OSI), U.S. Department of Justice where ho held the

position of Chief of Investigative Research. At OSI, he was involved in researchings and

preparing cases against accused Nazi war criminals residing in the United States. In

addition, he was selected to participate in the Klaus Barbie Investigation (1983) and played

a major role in the Josef Mengele investigation (1985), both of which received

international attention.

In connection with the Joseph Mengele and Klaus Barbie investigations, Marwell was

in charge of assembling all relevant documentary evidence relating to any possible

connection between these individuals and U.S. institutions of personnel. The

investigations were two of the most unusual ever undertaken and through them he gained

significant experiences in the identifying and locating documentary resources. The former

Director of OSI, Allan A. Ryan, Jr., in his book Quiet Neighbors: Prosecuting Nazi War

Criminals in America, described Marwell as "an experienced and careful historian who

could find documents in archives when no one else could."

When Marwell arrived at the Document Center, the institution had been rocked by a

scandal involving a significant theft of documents. The resulting focus on the Center

revealed that it had been neglected in many areas for many years and suffered from an

outmoded administrative structure, a disaffected and undertrained staff and a lack of

professional guidance. It was Marwell's job to bring the Center up to standard and prepare

it for turnover to the German government. •

The challenges facing Marwell were not only to manage a complex institution (with

an annual budget of eight million deutschmarks) and repair past deficiencies, but also to

define a future for an institution in transition. He prepared a "five year plan" for the BDC

that set five goals, developed a corresponding program to meet each goal, and designed a

system to monitor the progress. In achieving all of the goals, Marwell:

• Introduced computer technology (there was not a single computer at the

BDC when he arrived) and developed a sophisticated, integrated information

retrieval system that has been described as a model for archive

administration;

• Created a fully professional document conservation and restoration program;

• Developed a staff (50 Germans and 20+ Americans) that is better trained and :

far more responsible, flexible and creative than it had been;

18. Speeches:

I have no texts of formal speeches delivered in the past 5

years.

19. Congressional Testimony:

I have never testified before a Committee of the Congress.

20. Selection:

(a) Do you know why you were chosen for this nomination by

the President? I assume that I was considered to have

professional qualifications especially suiting me for the

position.

(b) What do you believe in your background or employment

experience

affirmatively qualifies you for this particular

appointment? I have spent a lifetime teaching and writing

about the history of the presidency and about American

history in general. The work of this appointment is bound

to draw on the expertness I believe I have acquired.

B. FUTURE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIPS

1. Will you sever all connections with your present employers,

business firms, business associations or business organiza

tions if you are confirmed by the Senate?

II. ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES

What particular qualifications and experience do you bring to

the role of being a member of the ARRB?

First, I have been a professional historian during most of my

adult life, specializing in the history of the presidency and the

history of United States diplomatic relations, and attaining

plomatic vet

I believe that I have a well-

developed sense of historical objectivity.

Second, I served to terms as a member of the National

Historical

publications Commission to which I was appointed and

then reappointed by President Johnson.

A chief function vas to

arrange for the evaluation and publication of collections of

documents with historical significance. I participated fully in

the activities of the NHPC and gained indispensible experience in

judging documentary work.

Third, as co-author

of The Modern Researcher (which has been

described

as the "classic guide to research and writing" and

1

## Page 35

13-00000

82

which non is in its Fifth Edition and Its thirty-sixth year of

publication), I have a keen sense of the sethods and neads of

researchers.

2. What do you consider to be your primary responsibilities and

priorities as an ARRB member?

My first responsibility is to help establish the deternina-

tion of the board to fulfill the purpose of the legislation

creating it.

The second is to help oversee the orderly and complete

gathering of the docunents fron the raspoctive agencies holding

The first priority 1s to help structure the Board so that

the work can proceed expeditiously and efficiently.

The second priority is to obtain the services

of a know?

ledgeable and energetic Executive Director as soon as possible.

3. How do you envision your relationship and responsibilities--

as an ARRB member-- to (a) the President, (b) the Congress, and

(c) other executive branch agencies?

(a) to the President: I will aim to the best of my ability

to meet the high expectations that President Bush enunciated upon

signing the Act creating the Board; to help burnish the reputa-

tion of the United States Government for trustworthiness.

I will

be responsive to inquiries and suggestions that nay emanate fron

the white House, while keeping in mind that the Board's own

integrity is the highest desideratun.

(b) to the congress: I will ain to fulfill the purpose of

the legislation creating the Board. I will always be acutely

aware of the keen interest and concern that the Congress has

expressed fron the beginning in the assassination itself and in

the attendant issues that understanding it has generated both on

Capitol Hill and in the country at large.

to inquiries and suggestions that may emanate iron the Congress,

while keeping in mind that the Board's own integrity is the

highest desideratum.

(c) to other executive branch agencies: I will be respon-

sive to the special concerns that assembling the pertinent

documents nay create. Still, I feel obliged to keep firmly in

wind that the Board's mission is the highest desideratum.

4. How do you view the job of ARRB Executive Director? What role

do you anticipate playing in the selection of ARRB Executive

Director and staff?

The Executive Director is central to the success of the

Board's mission.

He or she must be a person of judgment,

2

95%

## Page 36

13-00000

1

The ExeCutiVe Director 1s central to the success of the

Board'& mission. He or she sust be a person of judguent,

prinaiple, and enorgy, exporiencod in dealing with masses of

historical naterial and capable of confortably delegating work to

subordinates.

The person sust be history-minded as well as

capable of administering justly and effectively an enterprise

that will be substantial in size and enduring in 1ta impact on

the nation's. The Executive Director must be avare fron the

outset that he or she will have to be in regular contact with the

Board on all vital lssues arising out of the work.

I would expect to have a part in interviewing prospective

nominees for the post, and then in helping to instruct the person

selected as to his or her responsibilities. As to the staff, I

assume that the Bxecutive Director will have a comparatively free

hand in the selection of subordinates in order to guarantee the

ultinate responsibility of the Executive Director for the

thoroughness of the undertaking.

I would expect to be consulted

on nominees for staff positions as significant issues arise.

IILL POLICY ISSUES

1. Have you made any public statements- oral or written-

regarding the assassination of President Kennedy or the public

availability of government records regarding this assassination?

Please explain, and provide coples of any relevant saterial.

I vas interviewed by the scarsdale Inquirer in the week after

President Clinton announced his Intention to nominate me to the

ARRB. I offered sone innocuous remarks to the reporter, which

were not set down with complete accuracy. (I know, for example,

and so said, that the kennedy autopsy material will not be made

public. Also, I specifically said that George Stephanopoulos was

never a student of mine.) The text is attached.

Menbers of the ARRB will be examining security classified

records with a view to their declassification and public dis-

closure, in whole or in part, at sone time in the future.

(a) can you describe what prior experience you have had, if

any, with using or examining security classified records of the

Federal Government?

During my army service in World War II as an enlisted man

and as an officer of the Army security Agency at Arlington Hall

Station in Arlington, Virginia, I was engaged in cryptanalytic

and translation work on the most secret Japanese diplonatic codes

and ciphers.

The resulting documents were classified TOP SECRET

ULTRA-- the highest classification of that day.

I was also privy

to the MAGIC SUMMARY, which was issued daily to the White House

3

11-1T-93 11:E3FN PO01 527

---

## Page 37

13-00000

and to 10 Downing street by special Branch in the Pentagon, and

was also classified TOP SECRET ULTRA.

(b) What do you think of our current security classlfication

system?

for example, would you say it operates well, has

integrity, and serves the public interest?

I an not familiar with the intricacies of the classification

system at present.

I have never requested documents under the

Freedon of Information Acts and have no personal experience on

which to bage an answer to the sub-question.

As a diplomatic historian, I have been concerned that the

long time-lag that now obtains in the publication of the Foreign

elations of the United States Series could be considerabl

hortened without danage to the national interest

3.

one of the dutles of the ARRB will be to determine what

constitutes an "assassination record". What criteria do you

think should be used to nake this determination?

I belleve that an "assassination record" would be any

document that directly or indirectly materially bears on the

assassination.

The Board will have to create criteria for what

is meant by "materially". It is my further belief that in-

dividual documents and classes of documents will have to be

avaluated by the Board on a case-by-case basis.

IV. RELATIONS WITH CONGRESS

1. Do you agree without reservation to respond to any reasonable

summons to appear and testify before any duly constituted commit-

tee of the Congress, if confired?

Yes.

2. Do you agree without reservation to reply to any reasonable

request for information from any duly constituted connittee of

the congress, or its duly authorized agent, if conformed?

Yes.

PRE-HEARING ANSWERS FROM

KERMIT L. HALL

TO BE A MEMBER OF THE

ASSASSINATION RECORDS REVIEW BOARD

I. NOMINATION PROCESS AND POTENTIAL CONFLICTS

Were any conditions, expressed or implied, attached to your

nomination to be a member of the Assassination Records Review

Board (ARRB) ?

No.

so, what are they?

No.

3.

Are there any issues involving the ARRB from which you may

have to disqualify yourself? If so, please explain.

No.

4. Have you been a party to any legal actions or administrative

proceedings pertaining to access to, or disclosure of, federal

records on the subject of the assassination of President

Kennedy?

No.

1.

II. ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES

What particular qualifications and experiences do you bring to

the role of being a member of the ARRB?

I am a practicing historian of 21 years experience with a

thorough knowledge of American history and of archival and

recording management techniques. I have previously served on

committees

task forces

charged with improving

the

retention of both electronic and paper records. My service as

a scholar demonstrates, I believe, an even-handed approach to

major issues, a willingness to weight evidence impartially and

fairly, and to pursue truth with fidelity to the evidence.

Moreover, I have successfully brought to press books and

articles that have withstood the scrutiny of my peers.. I have

worked

extensively

in archival,

manuscript, and

other

governmental

materials, both of

the nineteenth

and

the

twentieth

centuries.

These qualities of professionalism,

character, energy,

and experience are essential to the

1

## Page 58

13-00000

2.

3.

effective fulfillment of the duties of a member of the ARRB as

required under the statute.

What do you consider to be your primary responsibilities and

priorities as an ARRB member?

As a member of the Board, I will be asked to consider whether

a record constitutes an assassination record and whether an

assassination record or particular information in a record

qualifies for postponement or disclosure under the statute. In

fulfilling these responsibilities I will be required to adhere.

faithfully to

the letter and spirit of

the enabling

legislation,

which carries a presumption of the immediate

disclosure

of all records relating to the assassination of

President John F. Kennedy. My responsibility is to serve the

public. interest in meeting this presumption with the

understanding that some materials may pose important issues of

national security, identify a living person who provided

confidential information and would pose a risk of harm to that

person,

invade privacy to a degree that outweighs the public

interest, and/or compromise a security or protective procedure

currently employed. In these cases a decision to postpone the

release of a document may be warranted. The burden in these

instances is clearly on the agency or other entity holding the

record to demonstrate that the presumption of release should

be set aside. In every instance the question must be answered

whether the release of a document would be so harmful as to

outweigh the public interest in releasing it under the terms

of the statute.

How do you envision your relationship and responsibilities --

as an ARRB member -- to (a) the President, (b) the congress,

and (c) other executive branch agencies?

As a member of the ARRB, I recognize that my official conduct

falls under the oversight of the Committee on Governmental

Operations of the House of Representatives

and the Committee

on Governmental Affairs of the Senate. Board members have a

duty to

cooperate with the

exercise of such

oversight

jurisdiction.

At the same time, the ARRB has authority to

direct Government offices to provide documents and related

finding aids for assassination records and, if necessary, to

investigate

surrounding additional information,

records, or testimony from individuals which may reasonably be

required for me to perform my duties under the statute.

statute creating the ARRB provides that after it has made a

finding with regard to documents obtained or developed solely

within the executive branch, the President has the sole and

nondelegable

authority

to

require

the

disclosure

postponement of

such

record

or

information

or

under

the

appropriate provisions of the statute. Throughout, the statue

clearly provides that the ARRB engaged

in

a mutually

## Page 59

1.

constructive dialogue with the executive branch and the

Congress about the character and disclosure of documents.

How do you view the job of ARRB Executive Director? What role

do you anticipate playing in the selection of ARRB Executive

Director and staff?

Members of the ARRB are charged with appointing an Executive

Director,

whose responsibilities include

serving

as

orincipal liaison to Governnent offices: administering ani

coordinating the Board's review of records; and administering

the official activities of the Board. The Executive Director

will have no authority to decide or determine whether

record should be disclosed to the public or postponed for

disclosure.

That duty resides with the Board alone.

selection of staff members will be done in keeping with the

statutory requirements. Staff members will have no authority

to determine whether

postponed.

a record should be disclosed' or

III: POLICY ISSUES

Have you made any public statements - oral or written --

regarding the assassination of President Kennedy or the public

availability

of

government records

regarding

this

assassination?

Please explain, and provide copies of any

relevant material.

I have made no public statements.

a) Can you describe what prior experience you have had, if

any, with using or examining security classified records

of the Federal Government?

From 1968 to 1969 I served as an officer in the United

States Army, a position that required me to handled many

classified documents and other materials. These documents

ranged

from

war

plans, to encrypted messages,

to

memoranda and working papers on various intelligence

matters.

What do you think of our current security classification

system?. For example, would you say it operates well, has

integrity, and serves the public interest?

Although I have not worked with classified documents for

some time, my general sense is that the present

system

probably leans too heavily toward classification and

over-classification of

materials

that

really do

not

deserve protection.

My own experience in years past

suggests

a tendency to make secret that which is

confidential and confidential that which is really not

3

## Page 60

13-00000

sensitive. Such a practice is perhaps understandable,

given the vicissitudes of national security, but openness

and the general availability of information about the

conduct of government is to be cherished in a democracy.

3.

One of the duties of

the ARRB will be to determine what

constitutes an "assassination record".

What criteria do you

think should be used to make this decision?

The statute creating the ARRB defines an assassination record

as a record that is related to the assassination of President

John F. Kennedy, that was created or made available for use

by, obtained by, or otherwise came into the possession of the

Warren Commission,

the Rockefeller Commission,

the Church

Commission,

Pike Commission,

the House

Assassination

Committee, the Library of Congress, the National Archives,

Presidential libraries, any Executive agency, any independeny

agency, any other office of the Federal Government, and

State or local law enforcement office that provided support or

assistance or performed work in connection with a Federal

inquiry into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

I understand that autopsy records donated by the Kennedy

family to the National Archives pursuant to a deed of gift

regulating

those records,. or

copies

reproductions made from such records, are not included.

IV. RELATIONS WITH CONGRESS

1. Do you agree without reservation to respond to any reasonable

sunnons to appear and testify before any duly constituted

committee of the Congress, if confirmed?

Yes.

2. Do you agree without reservation to reply to any reasonable

request for, information from any duly constituted committee of

the congress, or its duly authorized agent, if confirmed?

Yes.

of the Society of American Archivists before the House Committee on Appropriations,

Subcommittee on the Interior, in support of the annual appropriation for the National

a)

I was selected by the President from among three nominees supplied by the

President of the Society of American Archivists, in accordance with the procedure

outlined in Assassination Materials Disclosure Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-526).

b) My education as a historian and my background and experience as a

professionally active archivist, curator, research library administrator, and archival

educator qualifies me for the position for which I have been nominated.

B. Future Employment Relationships

1.

Because the position for which I have been nominated is a temporary

responsibility as a member of a Federal board, I have not resigned my permanent,

full-time position at Princeton University.

---

## Page 67

13-00000

2.

I have not resigned my permanent position at Princeton University, as I have

stated above, and expect to meet my responsibilities at Princeton while also serving

the goverment. I also have a temporary teaching assignment for a twelve week

period, from January 10 through March 25, 1994, at the University of Califomia, Los

Angeles, though I have arranged my schedule in order to be able to attend meetings

of the Assassination Records Review Board. I have also arranged a leave from

Princeton for this period.

3. My only commitment during my service with the goverment is to continue in

my permanent position working for Princeton University, as stated above.

4. The only commitment that l have after my government service is concluded is

to continue my work in the Princeton University Library. I have received no other

offers for commitment of my services after this assignment is concluded.

5.

If confirmed, I will continue my service on the Assassination Records Review

Board for as long as necessary.

C. Potential Conflicts of Interest

1. The only financial arrangements that I have maintained are those related to the

exercise of my duties in the Princeton University Library and as a temporary

instructor in the Graduate School of Library and Information Science at UCLA this

coming Winter quarter.

2.. I do not believe that I have any investments, obligations, liabilities, or other

relationships which could involve potential conflicts.of interest in the position for

which I have been nominated.

3.

I do not believe that I have had any business relationship, dealing, or financial

transaction over the last ten years that could constitute or result in a possible conflict

of interest in the position for which I have been nominated.

4. In the past ten years, the only activity in which I have engaged to influence the

passage, defeat or modification of any legislation or affecting the administration and

execution of law or public policy, has been to write occasional letters on behalf of

legislation affecting my chosen professions of research librarianship and archives.

---

## Page 68

13-00000

5.

Should there be any possible conilicts of interest in connection with my service

as a member of the Assassination Records Review Board, I would receive

information from all affected parties, and take appropriate steps to eliminate the

conflict.

6.

I agree without reservation to having written opinions provided to the

Committee by the designated agency ethics officer of the agency for which I have

been nominated, as well as by the Office of Government Ethics concerning potential

conflicts of interest or any legal impediments to my serving in the position for which I

have been nominated.

D. Legal Matters

1. I have never been disciplined or cited for a breach of ethics for unprofessional

conduct by, or been the subject of a complaint to any court, administrative agency,

professional association, disciplinary committee, or other professional group.

I have never been investigated, arrested, charged or held by any Federal,

State, or other law enforcement authority for violation of any Federal, State, county or

municipal law, regulation, or ordinance.

3.

I have not been involved as a party in interest in any administrative agency

proceeding or civil litigation, nor has any business of which I am or was an officer.

4. I have never been convicted (or offered pleas of guilty or nolo contendere) of

any criminal violation other than minor traffic offenses.

I am not aware of any other information, favorable or unfavorable, which I think

should be considered in connection with my nomination.

ANSWERS TO PRE-HEARING QUESTIONS

BY WILLIAM L. JOYCE

NOMINATED TO BE A MEMBER OF THE

ASSASSINATION RECORDS REVIEW BOARD

1. NOMINATION PROCESS AND POTENTIAL CONFLICTS

There have been no conditions, expressed or implied, attached to my

nomination to be a member of the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB).

2.

I have made no commitments with respect to policies or programs

affected by my role as a member of the ARRB.

3.

I am not aware of any issues involving the ARRB from which I would

have to disqualify myself.

4.

I have not been a party to any legal actions or administrative proceedings

pertaining to access to, or disclosure of, federal records on the subject of the

assassination of President Kennedy.

11. ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The particular qualifications and experience that I bring to the role of

being a member of the ARRB are the training and experience I have acquired as

a historian, in addition to my work-related experience as an archivist and

research library administrator.

2.

My primary responsibilities and priorities as an ARRB member are to

establish, in concert with other. Board members, clear policies and sound

procedures that can guide the work of the staff that the Board is to hire. Once

policies and procedures are set and staff is in place, it is the Board's clear

responsibility to oversee the training of staff in effective procedures for reviewing

classified records, to advise staff in problem areas, and to oversee their work

generally.

---

## Page 70

13-00000

-2-

As an ARRB member, l envision my relationship and responsibilities to:

a) the President to be one of faithfully executing to the best of my

ability the provisions contained in the President John F. Kennedy

Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992;

b) the Congress to be one of fulfilling the purposes of the same

legislation to the best of my ability, and to responding fully to

requests for information from appropriate oversight groups

conceming our progress;

c) other executive branch agencies to be one of cooperating to the

utmost of my ability to facilitate the review of any of their

assassination records and to provide them with full information

conceming our activities.

4.

I view the job of ARRB Executive Director to be one of organizing staff

for the most efficient and effective implementation of the policies and procedures

adopted by the Board. Apart from setting policies and procedures, there is no

more important task for the Board than hiring the best-qualified Executive

Director and overseeing the Executive Director's hiring of staff.

Ill. POLICY ISSUES

1.

I have not made any public statements- oral or written-- regarding the

assassination of President Kennedy or the public availability of govemment

records regarding this assassination.

2.

As an ARRB member, I will be examining security classified records with

a view to at least partial public disclosure:

a) I have had prior experience with security classified records first in

working with the Papers of Senator Arthur Vandenberg at the William L.

Clements Library at The University of Michigan, where we had to initiate a

declassification review of parts of those papers, and, second, in my current duties

at Princeton University where we have had to initiate contact with the State

Department conceming the declassification review of hundreds of reels of

microfilm of the most important state documents as selected by John Foster

Dulles himself.

b) The current security classification system certainly has integrity. I

would hope that, in the inierest of a fully informed citizenry and accountable

public officials, that somewhat more emphasis might be given to disclosure of

records after the passage of a specified period of time, allowing for agency

11-16-9312:1E5K

---

## Page 71

13-00000

-3-

initiative to classify records beyond that time when they fall into specific

::* categories that, in order to protect the national interest or privacy interests, must

continue to be restricted.

3.

The criteria to be used to determine what constitutes an assassination

record will likely consist of several elements: the proximity of the record either to

the time of the assassination or to the related activity of an assassination

principal, and/or the sontent of the record manifestly relating it to the

assassination, or an association of the record to the related activity of someone

known to have been involved in events plausibly connected to the assassination.

IV. RELATIONS WITH CONGRESS

If confirmed, I agree without reservation to respond to any reasonable

summons to appear and testity before any duly constituted committee of the

Congress.

2. It confirmed, I agree without reservation to reply to any reasonable request for

information from any duly constituted committee of Congress, or its duly

authorized agent.

First, since 1976, when I became a staff member of the

Public Documents Commission, I have been engaged in studies of

public records and have become knowledgeable about government

recordkeeping and archival practices. I also have been a consistent

supporter of the preservation of records and timely access for

historical research. Between 1980 and 1988, I participated as a

speaker on 15-16 programs having to do with public records..

archives or government information policy.

Second, as an active researcher in foreign policy records

as well as congressional records during the initial stages of the

Cold War era,

I also

have an understanding of the nature of

research and the kind of documentation required for such research.

Third,

as a member of

an

advisory committee on

documentation in the state Department (which reguired a security

clearance), I have an appreciation of the kinds of documents that

government agencies find too sensitive to release.

Finally, I believe that in my work on preservation and

access I have illustrated a personal integrity that has allowed me

to gain the trust of my professional colleagues.

PRE-HEARING QUESTIONS

ASSASSINATION RECORDS

REVIEW BOARD

I. Nomination Process and Potential Conflicts

1. Were any conditions, expressed or implied, attached to your

nomination to be a member of the Assassination Records Review Board

(ARRB) ?

No

2. Have you made any commitments with respect to policies or

programs affected by your role as a member of the ARRB?

3. Are there any issues involving the ARRB from which you may

have to disqualify yourself?

4.

Have you been

a party to any legal actions

administrative proceedings pertaining to access to, or disclosure

of,

federal records on

the subject of the assassination

President Kennedy?

NO

II. Role and Responsibilities

1. What particular qualifications and experience do you bring

to the role of being a member of the ARRB?

a. Staff member of the

Public Documents Commission,

created

Congress after the Nixon

tape controversy.

Commission held hearings, sponsored studies on public records and

wrote a final report. As a staff member, I was introduced to the

promises and problems of preserving federal records and providing

access to them.

b. Project Director, Committee on Records of Government.

This

foundation

funded project

designed to study the

relationship between information management and records management,

particularly as it

applies to computer generated records. As

project director

I worked closely with the Chairman of the

Committee and its members. I organized hearings, wrote summaries of

the hearings to be circulated to the Committee and was responsible

for preparation of the final report.

c. As an historian of American Foreign Relations, I have

researched documents in the National Archives (including four

Presidential Libraries) from the era

of the Cold War. I

an very

familiar with "withdrawal" notices of classified material as well

as the kind of material that has been released.

a .

I

have been

elected and/or appointed to several

comittees sponsored by various historical organizations that have

---

## Page 85

13-00000

page 2

been concerned with the declassification of historically valuable

documents. As a result, I am very familiar with FOlA and

the

Executive Orders that control declassification.

2. What do you consider to be your primary responsibilities and

priorities as an ARRB member?

The primary responsibility of the ARRB is to ensure the review

and facilitate

the public disclosure of records relating to the

assassination of President Kennedy. It is important to note that it

is not the responsibility of the Board or its members to reach any

conclusions about the participants or events of the assassination.

law. and either open of present to the Board Al documents

pertaining to the assassination. The obligation of each member is

to carefully study the documents that have not yet' been disclosed

SEES

to weigh the need for public disclosure against the protection of

national

security.

A major priority of the Board should be the

preservation

of

its own integrity in order to ensure the

restoration of government credibility regarding the assassination.

3. How do you envision your relationship and responsibilities--as

an ARRB member -- to (a) the President, (b) the Congress, and (c)

other executive branch agencies?

a and b. My responsibility to the President and Congress is to

fulfill the trust and perform the tasks mandated by the legislation

to the best of my

ability. I would be willing to confer with

members of the White House

staff and the Congress on the progress

of the Board if it is necessary to do so to preserve the integrity

of the process.

c. The relationship with other executive branch agencies may

prove more problematical. To restore public confidence, the Board

must be guaranteed

complete compliance with the law by all the

agencies with assassination related records. I would try to ensure

that agencies have indeed

searched for all relevant records, and

have either provided public access to them or prepared them for

action by the Board.

4. How do you view the job of ARRB Executive Director? What role do

you anticipate playing in the selection of ARRB Executive Director

and

staff?

As described in the statute, the Executive Director should be

responsibile

administrative duties.

• will involve

serving as a liaison to the agencies, describing the universe of

records, organizing hearings (if necessary), etc. The Executive

Director will not be responsible for policy and should not be

responsible for determining which documents can be opened to the

public.

I would anticipate that every Board member would actively seek

candidates for the position of Executive Director. However, since

five individuals cannot effectively run a Board, the elected

Chair

the axecutive Director. Thus,

involved in the selection process.

III. Policy Issues

1. Have you made any public statements - oral or written

regarding the assassination of President Kennedy or the public

availability of government records regarding this assassination?

2. Members of the ARRB will be examining security classified

their declassification

and public

disclosure, in whole or in part, at some time in the future.

Can you describe what prior experience you have had, if

any, with using or examining security classified records of the

Federal Government?

As a member of the State Department Advisory Committee on

Historical Documentation I have examined documents that have been

deemed security classified (including intelligence documents) and

have participated in discussions of disclosure of documents in the

Foreign Relations of the United States series with desk officers of

State who did not wish to see these documents published. I have

also

participated

in meetings

with

agency personnel

whose

responsibility included preserving

national security related

documents.

b) What do you think of our current security classification

systen? For example, would you say it operates well, has integrity,

and serves the public interests?

The current

system

is extremely expensive, labor

intensive and subjective in its implementation. It has resulted in

an enormous backlog of documents over 30 years old and has further

eroded public trust and government credibility. The current attempt

rewrite the

Executive Order

governing. the

security

classification system reflects the awareness of the White House and

executive agencies that the current system is no longer viable; it

does not operate efficiently, sacrifices the integrity of

record and does not, therefore, serve the public interest.

3. One of the duties of the ARRB will be to determine what

constitutes an "assassination record". What criteria do you think

should be used to make this determination?

This will be one of the most difficult problems facing the

Board. First, I think I would seek information from the agencies on

what they regarded as an assassination record. Second, since this

goes to the heart of public confidence, I think this is a question

that probably should

be the subject of an open hearing. Currently

my sense is that the Board will have to determine parameters for

---

page 4

the kinds of records sought, but that these should be as broad' as

possible.

IV. Relations With Congress

of the Congress, if confirmed?

2. Do you agree without reservation to reply to any reasonable

request for information from any duly consituted committed of the

Congress, or its duly authorized agent, if confirmed?

19. Congressional Testimony: Have you ever testified before a Committee of the Congress? If

so, please provide details, including date(s).

No.

20. Selection:

(a). Do you know why you were chosen for this nomination by the President?

I was one of six lawyers recommended for nomination to President Bush in December,

1992 by the President of the American Bar Association, J. Michael McWilliams, as

required by the statute. The recommendation was unsolicited. I was selected from the

recommendations.

(b) What do you believe in your background or employment experience affirmatively

qualifies you for this particular appointment?

I have extensive public law experience, including over seven years as the senior managing

lawyers in a highly-regarded attorneys general's office with over 425 staff members. I

have handled many of the most sensitive legal disputes involving the State of Minnesota

over that time, personally arguing three United States Supreme Court cases and winning

two. I have served throughout as the chief legal counsel to the Governor of Minnesota. I

have considerable experience dealing with Minnesota's Open records law and have a

reputation of approaching issues in a fair, thoughtful and impartial manner. I have not

been involved in any dispute over the assassination records and believe that, although I am

a strong believer in openness in government, I will approach the task in a fair manner. I

have considerable experience setting up governmental organizations and administrative

processes and believe that experience will be helpful in organizing the process by which

the Panel will conduct its work. I have played a leadership role within the National

Association of Attorneys General, particularly on management-related issues.

B. FUTURE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIPS

1. Will you sever all connections with your present employers, business firms, business

associations or business organizations if you are confirmed by the Senate?

No. My understanding is that the position is part-time and l have no conflict of interest in my

current position. I will take leave time from the State for any days l am working on panel

business.

2. Do you have any plans, commitments or agreements to pursue outside employment, with

or without compensation, during your service with the government? If so, explain.

Yes. I will continue my employment with the State of Minnesota and i planned position as

Adjunct Professor of Constitutional Law at the University of Minnesota Law School.

to resume employment, affiliation or practice with your previous employer, business firm,

government service?

Not in any position other than my current position.

5. If confirmed, do you expect to serve out your full term or until the next Presidential

election, whichever is applicable?

I expect to serve the full term of the Panel which sunsets under current law.

C. POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

1. Describe all financial arrangements, deferred compensation agreements, and other

continuing dealings with business associates, clients or customers.

None.

2. Indicate any investments, obligations, liabilities, or other relationships which could involve

potential conflicts of interest in the position to which you have been nominated.

4. Describe any activity during the past 10 years in which you have engaged for the purpose

of directly or indirectly influencing the passage, defeat or modification of any legislation or

affecting the administration and execution of law or public policy.

When employed by Oppenheimer, Wolff, Foster, Shepard & Donnelly, in 1983, I représented

business interests on workers compensation legislation before the Minnesota Legislature; and in

1984, I represented a major communications company on tax legislation before the Minnesota

Legislature. For both activities, I was registered as a lobbyist with the Minnesota Ethical

Practices Board.

Since being employed by the Minnesota Attorney General's Office, I have been involved

significantly in the development of legislation in Minnesota, including primary responsibility

for the budget of the Attorney General's Office each year from 1986 to present. I have also

worked with the Minnesota Legislature on criminal justice issues, environmental issues, farm

credit issues, consumer issues, government records issues, labor issues and others. My wotk has

included drafting legislation, testifying before legislative committees, serving on task forces,

writing legal opinions, and working with and advising staff, legislators, and governors.

My entire employment experience in the Attorney General's Office has involved the.

administration and execution of law or public policy. I have been the senior appointed official

in the office for over seven years, responsible for the management of the office. None of my

activities have involved any records dispute with a federal agency or anything regarding

assassination records.

5. Explain how you will resolve any potential conflict of interest, including any that may be

disclosed by your responses to the above items. (Please provide copies of any trust or

other agreements.)

I cannot imagine what conflict might arise, but if there is one I would not take part in any

decision of the panel affecting my conflict of interest.

IL. ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1. What particular qualifications and experience do you bring to the role of being a

member of the ARRB?

Primarily, I bring my background and experienco as a lawyer and public offcial, I

have twice been alectod a soction officer in the American Bar Association and was

recommended for this nomination by the President of the American Bar

Association. My experience as a lawyer includes thres years in private practice and

nine years as Solicitor General and Chief Deputy Attomey General in Minnesota.

For 7 1/2 years I have been the senior appointed official in the Minnesota Atomey

General's Office, responsible for the management and direction of an office of over

200 attomeys. I have handled-countless sensitive projects and cases, arguing three

cases before the United States Supreme Court and serving as legal counsel to two

Minnesota Governors and to the Minnesota Legislature. I have played as acüve

role within the National Association of Attorneys General, twice receiving major

national awards from NAAG, twice chairing the Conference of Chief Deputics, and

directing many of NAAG's management improvement initiatives. I teach

Constitutional Law as an Adjunct Professor at the University of Minnesota Law

School.

From my experience as Minnesota Chief Deputy Attorney General, I have

considerable experience dealing with the kind of processes envisioned by the Act,

including establishing new administrative procedures created by new statutes,

working with a wide range of governmental agencies, resolving tough legal issues

raised by new laws, applying confidentiality rules, administering open records laws,

issuing subpoenas, conducting government public heatings, and making difficult

public decisions that significantly impact citizens. I understand the separation of

powers issues that could be raised in the context of tus act. curthermore, I have

had no priot involvement in any aspect of the Kennedy assassination or the

assassination records. I would bring independent, objective judgment to the

position.

I also have a strong interest in historical preservation. My primary undergraduate

major was History, an area in which I graduated summa cum laude with honors. I

authored a 220 page local history and study of immigration. My research included

reviewing records at the National Archives. I have also provided legal

representation to the Minnesota Historical Socicty and State Archivist for eight

years.

I have worked in the Congress for the United States Senate on Senator Hubert

Humphrey's staff and have worked in the federal judiciary as a federal law clerk. I

have worked closely with the United States Department of Justice on a wide range

of projects and cases.

3.

What do jou donsider to be your primary responsibilities and priorities as an ARRB

member?

I see our primary responsibilities as:

(1) Overseeing and directing the prompt colloction trom govemment oracos of al

Kennedy assassination records that have not yet been transmitted to tho

National Archives, and directing a prompt public disclosure of all appropriate

records.

(2) Gathering input and information from the public to ensure that concems are

addressed and that all appropriate records are requested and received.

(3) Applying in a fair manner the standards set forth in the Act regarding

postponement of the release of records, ceeping in mind the strong

Congressional intent expressed in the Act favoring public disclosure.

(4)

Assuring the Congress and the American public that information about the

Kennedy assassination is not being hidden by any branch or agency of the

federal government.

(S). As the lawyer on the panel, l believe that I have additional responsibilities to

help ensure that appropnate and fair processes are established to guide the

collection and release of records, that legal questions are addressed promptly

and thoroughly, and that any necessary investigations are handled properly.

How do you envision your relationship and responsibilities - as an ARRB member

to (a) the President, (b) the Congress, and (c) other executive branch agencies?

My responsibilities to the President are to provide a regular and detailed

accounting of the work of the ARRB, and to provide concise and thorough

postponement and release decisions in order to expedite the President's review

of ARRB decisions affecting executive branch agencies.

Although ARRB is an independent agency, it is important to have a smooth

worlang relationship with the President in order to ensure that the process

established by Congress wors well.

My responsibilities to the Congress are to implement the law promptly and in

the manner intended by Congress, to provide on a regular basis a detailea

accounting of the work of the ARRB, and to respond appropriately to all

Congressional inquiries and requests.

(c)

My responsibilities toward and relationship with other executive branch

agencies are to work cooperatively but firmly in ensuring early transmittal of

documents to the National Archives. My responsibility includes working with

the agencies to ensure a complete understanding of agencies' responsibilities

under the law and fairly and independently reviewing agencies' requests to

postpone disclosure oi any records.

4.

How do You view the job of ARRB Executive Director? What role do you anticipate

playing in the selection of ARRE Erecutive Director and staff?

I consider the Executive Director to be the ARRB's chief administrator and

coordinator of all functions of the panel. The Executive Director should be the day-

to-day administrator of the staff and the administrator of all activities of the ARRB.

I envision the Executive Director playing an important coordination role with other

federal agencies.

I anticipate playing arole in the selection of the Executive Director. The position is.

critical to the effectiveness of the ARRB and I would like to use my considerable

recruiting and hiring experience to help choose the best available staff.

M. POLICY ISSUES

I..

Have you made any public statements - oral or written - regarding the assassination

of President Kennedy or the public availability of government records regarding this

assassination? Please explain, and provide copies of any relevant material.

I have made no written or oral public statements regarding the Kennedy

assassination or the assassination records.

Members of the ARRB will be examining security classified records with a view to

their declassification and public disclosure, in whole or in part, at some time in the

future.

a) Can jou describe what prior experience you have had, if any, with using or

examining security classified records of the Federal Government?

I have no prior experience with using or examining security classified records

of the federal govemment. I have, however, considerable experience handling

documents protected by state confidentiality laws.

b) What do you think of our current security ciassification system? For example,

would you say it operates well, has integrity, and serves the public interest?

The security classification system has generally well served the public interest

throughout the period in which the Cold War placed significant constraints on

sharing information. We have entered a new era and my understanding is that

a comprehensive review is now underway that will likely result in significant

revisions and the development of a less restrictive system of security

classification. Such a comprehensive review is a positive development.

3. One of the duties of the ARRB will be to determine what constitutes an "assassination

record.". What criteria do you think should be used to make this determination?

The definition of "assassination records" will be one of the most important and

signiãcant decisions of the ARRB. It is important to understand better the universe

of potential records before the difficult docision on how to define "assassination

records." Preliminarily, and without such an understanding yet, I would favor a

broad definition bocause (1) & broad definition will help assure the American public

the al i dunged: preta reviewed and disclosed, and and I believe inar 15

It may well be difficult to define "assassination records" in a manner which will

cover all relevant documents, and if so, it may be necessary to establish &

mechanism by which a case-by-caso determination can be made regarding the

linkage between the assassination and a particular document.

IV. RELATIONS WITH CONGRESS

1.

Do you agree without reservation to respond to any reasonable summons to appear

and testify before any duly constituted committet of the Congress, if confirmed?

Yes.

Do you agree without reservation to reply to any reasonable request for information

from any duly constituted committee of the Congress, or its duly authorized agent, il

confirmed?

Yes.

the twentieth century. nl In the 1950s, Senator Joseph

McCarthy' 8

Communist conspiracy theory - the "second Red Scare" - traumatized the nation

and destroyed lives. n2 More recently, David Irving'e explanation of the

Holocaust as an enormous historical fabrication n3 has defied logic and

distorted reality. ne Even Abraham Lincoln rests uneasily in his grave, as

theorists of his murder advance plots so tangled that only the exhumation of

John Wilkes Booth's bones can unravel them. n5

comprehensive historical accounts of the specter of conspiracy in America. See.

official Rosenberg story and the historical and cultural critiques performed by

its re-presentation in literature, drama and the visual area"); David Brion

These are compelling examples of the American appetite for intrigue, but no

other event in twentieth-century American history has generated such persistent

notions of conspiracy as the assassination of President John f. Kennedy. More

than foux hundred books have been published on the subject; no a major

newsletter provides a continu-

ing flow of new theories about the

assassination, 17 and à national organization, the Coalition on Political

Assassinations, meets annually to debate the murder. ni Oliver Stone elevated

the idea of conspiracy to epic proportions in the film JFK. nº That movie

claims, among other things, that bee Harvey Oswald did not act alone; rather, he

was part of a plot hatched by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in

collaboration wich organized crime, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),

and other elements of the American government. nil Stone's follow-up to JEK,

Nixon, nil echoes this theme, intimating a connection between the Cuban burglars

of the watergate complex and the assassination of President Kennedy, n12

by seven sober-minded Americans, headed by Chief Justice Earl Warren. n16

received strong support. Polling data indicates that prior to the Report's

responsible for the assassination of President Kennedy; following its release a

year later, in 1964, that number increased to eighty-seven percent. However, two.

years later, in 1966, only thirty-six percent of Americans indicated they

believed the Report. nld By the time JEK opened in the movie houses of

America, nig public confidence in the Commission's Report had sunk even further,

with about seventy percent of Americans concluding that Oswald did not act

alone. n20 The movie, therefore, capped a deep wellspring of distrust of the

Report rather than, as is sometimes implied, n2l fostered it.

The government's penchant for secrecy fueled the public's corrosively

cynical view of politics and politicians. During the Watergate investigation,

President. Nixon proclaimed to the nation that he was "not a crook," n35 but he

soon abandoned the Oval Office and joined his disgraced vice president n36 in

private life. n37 In one of the great ironies of modern American politics, the

instrument of Nixon's downfall was a secret recording system installed in the

White House. n38 What was supposed to be a tool to record reliably the

President's triumphs became the chief means of exposing the Watergate cover-up.

First, the Commission had accese to an enormous amount of information not

otherwise accessible to the American press and public. n41 This information was

secret, top secret, and beyond, much of it compartmentalized cryptologic and

signal intelligence material dealing wich the Soviet Union,. Cuba, and other

foreign governments, such as Communist China. n42 Because of the enormous Cold

war paranoia, as well as the requirement to maintain tight secrecy around the

sources and methods used to collect this information, the Commission could not

argue its case fully to the American people. When the research community

asserted that the government itself had been im-

assassination, n43 the evidence that the Commission had used to discount such a

possibility was available only to the government charged with having abetted the

crime. The cost of secrecy was uncertainty, an uncertainty that turned to

cynicism, much of it based on cheories about the assassination that gained

legitimacy simply because they could not be tested against the appropriate

evidence.

Second, although the Commission had access to some high-quality incelligence

information, it did not receive everything. The CIA, FBI, and Attorney General

Robert F. Kennedy failed to reveal information that would have helped identify a

motive for a conspiracy. 144 The failure to disclose all information to the

Commission was particularly damaging because of the distinguished character of

its seven members. 145 Its chairman was Chief Justice Earl Warren, a person

noted for probity and fairness, 146 The Commission was really divided into two

subgroups. Four of the members - Warren, Hale Boggs, Gerald Ford, and John

Sherman Cooper - had relatively little experience with intelligence matters;

however, the other three - Richard Russell, Allen Dulles, and John J. McCloy -

were fully conversant with national security issues and the sources and methods

used by the intelligence services. 147

II. Other Investigations of the Assassination

Between 2964 and 1979, the American intelligence services were subjected to

unparalleled scrutiny, much of it fueled by the CIA's and FBI's ties to the :

Watergate debacle and by revelations of domestic political surveillance by both

agencies and the military intelligence services. n72 There were three other

federal investigations that, in dealing with these issues, also addressed the

Kennedy assasgination: in the mid-1970s, the Rockefeller Commission, n73. the

Pike Committee, n74 and

couched on matrers relating to the assagsination and provided, most

other abuses, that the CIA had compiled files on over 10,000 U.S. citizens as

part of Operation CHAOS. See id. at 3.

Rockefeller Commission, named after its chairman, Nelson Rockefeller. See

The most powerful of the post-Warren Commission inquiries was that made by

the House Select Committee on Assassinations. (HSCA), which in 1976 reopened the

investigation that had been seemingly closed a dozen years earlier. n79 The

Committee, chaired by Congressman. Louis Stokes of Ohio, explored several

controversial areas of John F. Kennedy's assassination, along with those of his

[*14]. ert, and Reverend King. n80 The HSCA suffered from its

own limitations, which are beyond the scope of this Article. 181 However, the

ISCA's conclusions, which now seem to be in question, held chat. the Committee

could not rule out a conspiracy to kill the President. n82 This finding directly

challenged the Warren Commission. n83 For example, che HSCA believed that

advanced acoustical techniques demonstrated that there had been more than one

shooter in Dealey Plaza. n84 That analysis was subsequently repudiated, n85 but

it was too late to counter the damage done to the Warren Commigsion's

credibility.

III. The Assassination Records Review Board

The findings of these investigations inspired Oliver Stone'a 1991 movie. n87

Without endorsing the movie's sensational conclusions, many members of Congress

decided that the government's refusal to release classified information about

the assassination promoted an unhealthy level of distrust of government. n88 As

a result, Congress passed the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection

Act of 1992 n89 (the JFK Act or Act), which mandated the creation of a

five-person Review Board. 190 The Act ordere all' federal agencies to assess

whether they (*151

possess records relating to the assassination. n91 All

records that an agency deems as not suitable for immediate release are subject

to the Board's evaluation. n92 All records identified as relating to the

assassination must be opened by October 26, 2017, with the exception of records

that the president certifies for continued postponement. n93

IV. Openness and Secrecy • OriginalIntentiona

History offers uncertain guidance about how the Board should weigh these grounds

for postponement against the public's interest in knowing the facts about the

assassination. The Framers of the United States Constitution did harbor doubts

about government, doubts precipitated by their experience in the English Empire.

1107 James Madison and Thomas Jefferson, among others, testified eloquently to

the proposition that public accountability was an appropriate measure of the

success of a republic. n108 Still, the Framers were also sophisticated statesmen

who valued secrecy in fostering the public good. n109 For example, the

Philadelphia Convention of 1787 conducted is deliberations in secret without

any complete record of its debates. n110 The Constitution provides for the

malatenance of an executive journal for both Houses of Congress and permits

government to publish its accounts and revenues from "time to time," rather than

on demand. n111 Even more fundamental was President George Washington's

assertion of a broad degree of presidential discretion in dealing wich foreign

relations, war, and peace. n112 In certain circumstances, secrecy could be

justified to attain ends superior to a completely in- (*18]

formed public.

Indeed, the Constitution's Preamble declares that insuring "domestic

Tranquility" and providing for the "common defencé" are objectives egual to

securing the "Blessings of Liberty. " n113

V. Openness and Secrecy - FOIA

For more than 190 years, the American public did not have a legal right to gain

access to information about its government..n115 All of that changed, however,

in 1966 when President Lyndon Johnson signed FOIA nll6 and thereby altered the

historical relationship between the federal government and the public. n117 FOIA

presumes that government information is public information and is implemented by

the judicially enforceable requirement that all federal agency records be made

aváilable promptly upon request, subject only to nine exemptions, which are to

be narrowly construed. n118

-Footnotes-

allS. The issue of openness in government has historically been franed int

terme of the right of the government to keep secrets, rather than the right of

the public to have access to governmental recorde.

See Seth F. Kreimer, Sunlight

Secrets and Scarlet Letters: The Tension Between Privacy and Disclosure in

Constitutional Law, 140 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1 (1991). The movement towards greater

openness in the post-World War II period has been part of a broader movement in

the twentieth century to hold government accountable for its actione. See id. As

a result, since the progressive era of the early twentieth century, we have seen

the institution of public records, open meetings, and "sunshine laws." See id.

Today, keeping information secret has become a massive industry in washington.

n124 According to official estimates, the government took 6.3 million

classification actions in 1994, creating an estimated 19 million pages of

information that only selected

government officials can see. n125 More than

32.000 government workers are employed full-time to determine what should be

secret, what level of secrecy the material should have, and whether the

documents should be classified. n126 The government holds hundreds of millions

of pages of secret documenta; indeed, the precise number has gone beyond the..

government's ability to count. n127

so. 1130 For more than fifty years, the Department followed a scheme of

classification that might best be called "classified at birth. " n131 Any

document generated was presumed secret until proved otherwise. n132 The

Department and its civilian contractors have literally lost track of what needs

VII. The Board and the Intelligence Services

the wik act is an attempt not only to deal with the issue of public contidence

in government, n141 but algo to forge a model of how we might keep from sinking

in our own secrets. Yet, the intelligence community resists the opening of

classified materials, even those that are now a third-of-a-century old. This

defiance is particularly ironic in the case of the kennedy assassination, in

that the intelligence agencies most troubled by the disclosures are che same

ones that most often figure in conspiracy theories. n142 Disclosing materials

Chat the CIA and FBI want postponed might actually affirm that neither a foreign

nor domestic conspiracy existed and demonstrate the vital role they played in

supporting American interests in the Cold War.

Congress never contemplated total disclosure, otherwise it would not have

it permica compromise by allowing individuals to make concessions without losing

certain secrets from disclosure. See 44 U.S.C. 2107(6) (1994) (identifying the

materials); Sanders & Zaid, supra note 62, at 419 (explaining the Board's

popular sentiment" and to compromise "without loss of face").

n146. United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 705 (1974) (footnote omitted).

n147. Secrecy in the High court is a practice, a matter of the Court's..

culture and traditions, not of law. see Bob woodward & Scott Armstrong, The

Brethren xi (1979) ("The Court has developed certain traditions and rules,

largely unwritten, that are designed to preserve the secrecy of its'.

deliberations."). The Justice who tells what took place in conference 1s

indiscreet and is likely to forfeit the respect of other Justices, but he breake

no law and neither do his law clerks. See id.

Indeed, one of the arguments

raised in che wake of opening the papers of Justice Thurgood Marshall was that

his written commentary. on his colleagues may have made it more difficult for

them to deal with one another now knowing that the public understood the reasons

that they held certain positions. See id. at xii (observing that, because

Justices are not elected but are appointed for life, they are not disposed to

allow their decisionmaking to become public). The matter is posed differently,

What duty does the government owe to persons who agree to serve as

Informants? There are many reasons why persons serve as informants. "Money,

revenge, and the sheer chrill explain some of this behavior. Yet, above all

else, informants expect that they will be clothed in confidentiality in return

for cheir information. An informant who is identified immediately loses value.

All informants in the service of the various domestic and international

Intelligerce operations are recruited with an understanding that they will be

granted confidentiality - that they will never be "given-up" in the lingo of the

Intelligence community. n161 The very nature of what they are asked to do -

commit treason on their home government, report on the activities of groups like

the American Communist Party, or shed light on the activities of organized crime

majority of documents involving informants has been opened in part; infrequently

only the names of the informants and other key identifying language has been

Board's disclosure of informants. The Exhibit contains a message sent by the FBI

Special Agent in Charge (SAC) in Houston to the SAC in Dallas and to FBI

Director J. Edgar Hoover on November 26, 1963, four days after the murder of

President Kennedy, n163 This document was öriginally reviewed by the FBI, and

As Exhibit Iwo reveals, the Board decided that much of the redacted material

could be released, most notably che name of Mary Ann McCall, a hostess at a

Dallas night spot. n165 By the time the informant had interviewed McCall, Jack

Ruby had already killed Oswald. The Board decided that the historical record was

well served by opening McCall's name, especially given her purported

relationship with the dallas police and organized crime. The Board, however,

also accepted the FBI's argument that the name of the person who provided the

Information about McCall should be proteated. Consequently, a document that had

many redactions when it was sent from the PBI to the Board went into the public

record with only one name redacted. The Board was sacified that revealing the

informant's name would harm the informant, thus outweighing the value of

immediate disclosure. The Board used substitute language to make clear to

students of the assassination that the redacted portion was the name of a

"confidential informant" and ordered that the name be released in the year 2010.

therefore, is whether an agency that seeks to protect an individual, regardless

of the quality of the information provided, can substantiate the claim that harm

will come to that person as a result of revealing her name. When an agency has

failed to do so, the Board has released the name. n168 The record of events

surrounding the assassination will never be complete until we know what blind

alleys are not worth pursuing. As any good investigator knows, eliminating blind

alleys is critical, because the elimination provides additional certainty about

who knew nothing, a fact that can be helpful in discerning who knew something.

In this context, knowing that an informant knew nothing, at least by her

statement, is valuable itself, given the complexity of the conspiracy theories

surrounding the assassination.

whether she is alive or dead, what is the Board's duty? The Board faces the

whether to postpone releasing the names of informants and agents. Where does the

requirement for a full historical record of the Kennedy assassination yield to

the prudential uses of secrecy to preserve the nation's ability to gather

intelligence?

IX. Sources and Methods

Tie JEK ACt requires the Board to balance the need to protect sources and

methods of intelligence collection with the public need for disclosure of

information relating to the assassination. nißl The inappropriate release of

documente, either in part or in full, dealing with our intelligence agencies'

sources and methods could afford hostile nations, organized crime, terrorists,

them, they are likely to adopt appropriate countermeasures. They also might seek

to provide selectively misleading information, knowing that we are listening and

how we are listening. Many of the documents already available in the JFK

Collection at the National Archives indicate that the United States bugged,.

tapped, photographed, and otherwise conducted surveillance of persons and

places.. The question arises whether we should also reveal the precise kind of

equipment that was used, how it was employed, and against whom it was targeted.

Knowledge about equipment and technique would be important in evaluating che

capability of the intelligence community, not only to ply its craft, but to

organize a conspiracy on its own. Again, the question arises whether disclosing

a source, method, or technique should turn on whether positive or negative

information becomes available.

custody of that material is critical. Yet, to do so would require identifying

the persons who handled it. In this instance, the Board decided that, on grounds

of personal privacy and potential harm, it would not disclose the name of one

CIA official involved wich the Mexico City operation, although the names of

other officials were released in cooperation with the CIA.

connection with the CIA. However, a full understanding of the intelligence base

upon which the warren Commission and the incelligence community as a whole

assessed the Kennedy assassination depends on a thorough accounting of such

was known at the top of the cooperating governments and the extent to which such

Board with this heavily redacted document, arguing that release of the body of

material in the message from the FBI field office in Paris to the Director of

the FBI in Washington on October 12. 1960 (three years before the

assassination), would damage the ability of the United States to work with the

intelligence and police operations of a foreign nation. The cable. however,

struck the Board as being particularly important, in that it showed that three

years before che murder of the President the FBI was engaged in surveillance of

Oswald's activities. n192 The Board was also concerned that concealing so large

an amount of material would only heighten speculation about the document's

significance.

States, who consented to the relcase, only with the proviso that che names of

specific Swiss officials not be divulged. As a result of the cable's release, we

know that the FBI had knowledge of and interest in Oswald's activities well

before the assassination, to the extent of relying on officials of the Swiss

Federal Police to learn about his possible attendance at Albert Schweitzer

college. n194

renders open that which currently requires postponement. The second is whether.

by adopting a particular theory about what happened in Dallas, the Board so

fundamentally shapes its assumptions about the significance of documents that it

may actually fail to open the most critical of them.

More than a third of a century has passed since the murder of President

Kennedy. When asked whether the sources, methods, and techniques used then are

no longer worchy of protection today, the intelligence and law enforcement

agencies appropriately anewer no. n195 They argue that disclosure at any time

will reduce their capabilities and, hence, our national security. n196 In the

world of intelligence operations, all secrets must live forever, lest we be

unable to find new secrets in che future.

The passage of time, however, has made a difference, and in some instances

dramatically so. There is today no Soviet Union to which Lee Harvey Oswald could

return. If he returned to Minsk, he would find it a capital of an independent

nation, rather than a satellite of the Communist Empire. The. Warsaw Pact has

dissolved; the capitals of Eastern furope now sport trendy shops and capitalist

enterprises; Cuba survives by importing tourists from everywhere but the United

States, and China has emerged as a major American market. Not only is the cold

War dead, but so too are many of the principal figures in the assassination -

President Johnson, Robert F. Kennedy, John Connally, and Jacqueline Kennedy. The

n197 There is no doubt that the CIA, FBI, and military intelligence services

snooped on us and other nations, friend and foe. n198 The CIA in particular

argues that current intelligence activities must remain plaugibly deniable and

that the Board's role should be to postpone the disclosure of actions taken a

third-of-a-century ago that conceivably could compromise current operations.

Yet, we might reasonably ask ourselves, as che Board has, whether, three decades

lator, we would compromise our security interesta around the world by indicating

that a CIA station once existed in Moscow.

preferred over partial; the full truth is better than something less, and the

George Bernard Shaw was correct when he argued: "There are no secrets better

kept than the secrets that everybody guesses." n212 Shaw's words surely describe

the approach of the intelligence agencies to the Kennedy assassination. In the

absence of disclosure, the public, goaded by a news-hungry press and an activist

research community, will be left to speculate in sensational ways about the

assassination. Such speculation will continue to have predictably corrosive

consequences.

Assassination Records Review Board

Guidelines for Review of Postponements in the Segregated Collections

Adopted: April 23, 1997

Background

In order to ensure that the Review Board will be able to complete its task of reviewing

all identified assassination records, the Board recently took two significant steps.'

. First,

on November 13, 1996, it adopted guidelines with respect to reviewing "Segregated

Collections" with regard to information that is "not believed relevant" (NBR) to the

assassination. Second, in February 1997, the Review Board requested Congress to

extend its tenure for one additional year.

It is the Review Board's judgment that, even with the assumption that our operations

may be extended through Fiscal Year 1998, the Review Board cannot hope to complete

review of postponements in the Segregated Collections under the current method of

review. In particular, a reasonable modification of current postponement standards

would greatly expedite and facilitate the release of additional information and records.

Otherwise, the Review Board might cease operations without having reviewed claimed

postponements in tens of thousands of pages of FBI and CIA records.

Postponement Criteria for the Segregated Collections

In a further effort to enhance the Review Board's work, the Review Board now issues

these revised guidelines for the review of records in the Segregated Collections.'

(These guidelines do not affect the FBl's Core and Related Files or the ClA's 201 file on

Oswald.) The four principal factors that underlie these review guidelines are: first,

continuing, to the greatest reasonable extent, the Review Board's established

guidelines for postponements that have emerged over the past two years; second,

establishing guidelines consistent with the Review Board's decision regarding NBR

records; third, establishing reasonable and workable guidelines that will enable the

'The regulations adopted by the Board on November 13, 1996, define

"Segregated Collections" as including first, FBI records that were requested by: (a) the

House Select Committee on Assassinations ("HSCA") in conjunction with its

investigation into the Kennedy assassination; (b) the Church Committee in conjunction

with its inquiry into issues related to the Kennedy assassination; and (c) by other bodies

(e.g., Pike Committee, Abzug Committee, etc.) that relate to the Kennedy

assassination; and second, CIA records including (a) the ClA's Sequestered Collection

of 63 boxes as well as one box of microfilm records and the microfilm records (box 64),

and (b) several boxes.of CIA staff "working files."

Review Board, the ARRB staff, the CIA, and the FBI to complete the significant arount

of work that remains; and finally, to provide reasonably consistent standards for the

review of postponements that would apply equally to CIA and FBI records.

The following are, in summary form, guidelines for reviewing postponements in the

Segregated Collections.]

CIA Source and FBI Informant and National Security Asset Postponements

There are, of course, similarities and differences between FBI informants and CiA

sources: Like FBI informants and national security assets, CIA sources may or may not

be paid for the information that they provide and they may or may not be providers of

information over the long-term. When providing information to the Bureau, FBI

informants generally are understood to be cooperating with law enforcement officials for

a legal and legitimate purpose. It is often the case, although not always, that FBI

informants understand that at some point their name might surface in conjunction with a

criminal prosecution and that they may need to testify in court. Foreign CIA sources

and FBI national security assets, however, are not necessarly deemed to be

cooperating with law enforcement officials but may, in fact, be committing the crime of

espionage against their native country by cooperating with US authorities. Furthermore,

unlike FBI informants, CIA sources and FBI national security assets presume that their

names will not be released publicly and they certainly presume (in the ordinary course)

that their identities will not surface in criminal trials. As a practical matter, it is generally

much easier today for the FBI to locate a tormer informant who resides in the United

States than it is for the CIA and FBI to locate former sources and national security

assets.

Despite these differences - differences which would generally suggest a greater

degree of protection being owed to CIA sources and FBI national security assets - the

issues in terms of postponements are fundamentally similar.

"The existing "NBR" guidelines allow the Review Board to remove from detailed

consideration those records or files that truly have no apparent relevance to the

assassination. Nevertheless, a significant number of files in the Segregated Collections

contain records that shed some light on issues that the HSCA explored as potentially

relevant to the assassination of President Kennedy. The following criteria would apply

to all records in the Segregated Collections, including records containing some NBR

redactions.

CIA Sources

The Review Board established guidelines, during its December 1996 meeting, for

handling CIA source issues and applied those guidelines at the January 1997 meeting.

These guidelines directed the protection of names and identiiying information of ClAs

sources in cases where the identity of the source is of low public interest or is peripheral

to the JFK assassination. The Board's decision was based on two factors: the concern

that since CIA sources generally live outside the United States, they could risk haim if

their identities were revealed. Moreover, many of the sources referenced in ClA

records appear infrequently and are of relatively low public interest. Therefore, In

records where the identity of the source is of importance for understanding the

assassination, the CIA will be required to provide aditional evidence to support the

protection of the source's identity." In cases where the identify of the source is

peripheral to the assassination story, the information will be postponed until 2017.

FBI Nat/onal Security Assets

FBI national security assets should be treated in the same manner as CIA sources.

FBI Informants

Informant issues represent the largest category of postponements in the FBI's

Segregated Collection, as they do in the "core" FBI assassination files. They also

provide the greatest opportunity for streamlining the review process. Currently, there

are ten members of the Bureau's JFK Task Force who are responsible for researching

individual informants in response to evidence requests from the Review Board." They

retrieve and review the informants' files and attempt, through DMV, Social Security, and

other database searches, to determine if the informant is alive. Under current Review

Board standards for "core" files, this work is necessary to provide evidence to support

redacting the informant's name, regardless of whether the informant provided

information. Removing the requirement of proving whether informants are alive in the

Segregated Collections would free up significant resources that could be deployed to

reviewing unprocessed HSCA subject files.

The new approach to HSCA subjects is to protect informant-identifying information,

3An example would be the case of John Scelso (pseud.). The Board found that

his identity is relevant to the assassination story and CIA offered evidence of a

continuing need to protect the identity. In this case, "Scelso" documents would

continue to be scheduled for release in five years.

"Six work full-time on informant evidence, four devote about half their time to

informant evidence.

without requiring the Bureau to make a showing that the informant is alive. This

protection would extend to individuals characterized as symbol-number informants,

"PSis," "PCls," "established sources," "panel sources," and the like - designations that

Indicate an ongoing relationship with the FBi. It would not extend to individuals who

requested that their identity be protected in an isolated contact with the FBl or to local

and state law enforcement officers.

The "informant-identifying information" to be protected would include the customary

(i.e., informant-specific) portions of informant symbol numbers and file numbers;

informant names, and - at least potentially - descriptions of, and information received

from, the informant. How much, if any, of the latter type of information should be

redacted would be the principal focus of staff-level discussions with the FBI. The staff's

principal goal in this process, with regard to each inforrant, would be to release as

much information that is relevant to understanding the assassination as possible. In

discussions with the FBl, the staff would be prepared, if necessary, to concede

redaction of informant-identifying information that is unrelated to the assassination in

order to ensure that more pertinent information is released.

The presumption will be that an informant's identity will be released if the informant

provides "positive" information about an assassination-related issue. To overcome this

presumption of release for informants with "positive" information, the FBI would need to

make a particularized showing that the identifying information should not be released.

To the extent that an informant's identity is protected, it will be postponed until 2017.

CIA Employee Name Postponements

Over the past year the ClA has addressed the employee name issue and has released

some names that it had previously asked the Board to postpone. But during that time

the list of names has grown to a size that had not been imagined at the time the work

began. To date, the Review Board staff has identified in the JFK Collection over 650

names of CIA employees. These names appear in more than 1000 documents already

reviewed by the Board and numerous additional records that have not yet been

processed. While some of these employee names are important to the assassination

story, many appear only a few times in the entire JFK Collection and seem to add little,

if any, important information.

Sin HSCA subjects, there typically will not be information about Ruby, Oswald or

the assassination itself. However, in a file on, for example, Sam Giancana, there may

be informant reports on Giancana's support of anti-Castro activities, and reports from

the same informant on day-to-day numbers operations in the Chicago area. The staff

would set a higher priority on release of the former reports than on the latter.

CIA's argument to protect employee names emphasizes a number of points. First;

since many employees are "under cover," the maintenance of that cover is critical to

gathering intelligence. CIA argues that identification of a name can identily the cover

provider and jeopardize operations. Second, althöugh the majority of names are of

retired CIA employees, CIA has a confidentiality agreement with them and many do not

want their past Agency affiliation released. The argument here is that release may

jeopardize business relationships or personal safety. Such arguments have already

been presented to the Board. Their merit can only be determined on a case-by-case

basis. However, due to the volume of names in the JFK Collection, the individual

review and evaluation of each case would delay significantly the review of documents

and ultimately lead to less total information becoming available to the public.

CIA has proposed, and the Review Board agrees, that ClA employee names be treated

in a manner similar to that applied to Source names: to postpone until 2017 those

employee names that are of low public interest or are of peripheral interest to the

assassination. It will be presumed that employee names will be released if their

identities are important to the assassination story unless the CIA is able to provide

specific information of a potential harm of release. (CIA acknowledges the presumption

of release unless specific evidence is provided to the Review Board that harm to

national security or to personal safety would result from the release of the employee

name.)

FBI "Foreign Counterintelligence" Postponements

It is presumed that the FBI will, at least partially, carry over its post-appeal standards for

disclosing "FCI" activities targeting Communist-bloc nations. To the extent that the

HSCA subjects reflect "FCI" activities against other nations that have not been

addressed by the Review Board in the "core" files, the FBI will be allowed to redact

direct discussion of such activities, unless the information in the proposed redaction

meaningfully contributes to the understanding of the assassination.

FBI and CIA Foreign Liaison Postponements

The criteria for these postponements would not, in the abstract, depart significantly from

the Review Board's current approach of releasing information received through liaison

channeis, while protecting direct acknowledgment of the source of the information. In

practice, however, the staff would be more flexible in protecting text that implies,

although may not unambiguously state, that a foreign government is the source of

particular information. Nevertheless, the more significant the information is to any

assassination-related issue, the more information would be released under these

guidelines.

CIA Stations and Other Issues

Over the past two years the Review Board has established other guidelines that will

continue to guide the review process, some of which will be outlined here. For CIA

stations, all locations related to the Mexico City story will be released during the period

1960-69. Outside of that window, they will be released on a case-by-case basis should

the identity of the station be critical to understanding the assassination. Other stations,

except for those identified as particularly sensitive, will be released from the beginning

of the Kennedy administration until the publication of the Warren Commission report,

(i.e., January 1, 1961 to October 1, 1964). Outside of these windows, stations will be

postponed. Cable prefixes, dispatch prefixes, and field report prefixes would be

postponed or released according to the same windows as the stations to which they

refer. CIA job titles also are redacted or opened along with the station at which the

officer served.

Crypts would be released along lines similar to other information. All "LI" crypts, except

those considered particularly sensitive would be released through October 1, 1964, as

are "AM" crypts and U.S. govemment crypts. In other areas, only the digraph is

protected. Again, the exception is sensitive crypts, which would be protected in their

entirety. After October 1, 1964, the presumption shifts towards protection of the crypts,

except those that provide meaningful information about the assassination story. (For

example, crypts pertinent to Garrison-era documents would likely carry the same

presumption of release as those generated during the Warren Commission.)

Surveillance methods will be released if the nature of the surveillance has a material

bearing on information related to the assassination unless CIA provides evidence

demonstrating the political or operational sensitivity, in which case the information will

be released in 2017.

To:

Review Boar

From:

Subject:

I. Jeremy Gw

Proposed ARRB Timetable for

Review of CLA Records

• I. Background

The CIA Team has developed a preliminary timetable that we hope will provide a

reasonable framework for completing our review of CIA's assassination records by

August 1, 1998.' We are creating this timetable for three purposes:

First, to establish our own working target dates to measure Review Board progress

against the mandatory deadline established by the JFK Act.

Second, to provide CIA with our best assessment of the order and scope of our review.

so that it can make its own internal judgments on the proper allocation of its resources.

We provided ClA prior drafts of this memo and solicited its specific advice and

suggestions for better ways to accomplish our goals. [We have not asked CIA to

"agree" to these deadlines, but we have encouraged it to provide alternative

suggestions on how best to meet the August 1 deadline.]

Third, to solicit the Review Board's advice regarding "enforcement" of these (or other)

targets. Although we surely hope that both the ARRB staff and CIA will be able to meet

the targets, and although we certainly plan to make all reasonable accommodations for

problems that no doubt will arise, we nevertheless anticipate that it is possible that CIA

might not be able to keep to these timetables. Thus, we anticipate that there may well

be times when blocks of records scheduled for Board review will not have been fully

processed by CIA. It is our judgment that, in keeping with our commitment to

Congress and to the goals of the JFK Act, we may need to have the Board act on groups

of records for which CIA has not completed its initial review. At the risk of over-

repetition, the ARRB staff seeks to be as reasonable and accommodating as it can on

timetables, provided that any proposed changes are consistent with our obligation to

complete the task. We realize that this review may have resource allocation

*By establishing this target date, we will provide ourselves with a two-month

cushion to handle possible appeals and miscellaneous issues that doubtless will arise.

consequences for ClA and we expect to refine this timetable both to minimize the

resource impact and to allow us and the CIA to proceed most efficiently with the

review. We also take very serlously our commitnent to Congress to complete our work

on schedule. Is the Board prepared to make decisions on records if CIA has not

completed its review and to enforce those decisions?

I. Issues applying to all CIA record groups

Records to be opened-in-full

During the course of CIA's review, it frequently identifies records that, is it

is prepared to open in full without Board action. Althöugh there is a

benefit in promptly forwarding such records to NARA, it is less expensive

for CIA to process these records during the summer months.

Accordingly, we are prepared to agree with CLA that it may delay.

processing such records, provided that all such processing of open-in-full

• records will be completed by August 30, 1998.

Duplicates

CIA will continue to identify duplicates and may process them after all

other documents have been reviewed and transferred to NARA. If the

ARRB is shown that any given record is a duplicate, CIA need not

complete the processing before September 30, 1998.

IlL. CIA Record Groups

1 to 4 scale. CIA has completed its declassification review of

roughly 66% of the priority 1 folders.

The ARRB Staff has completed its own review of approximately

50% of the priority 1 records and those records have been (or

shortly will) be voted on by the Board.

The ARRB staff has no objection to the records being identified entirely on the

folder level provided that all records in the folder are open-in-full. If there are records

in which the CIA is requesting redactions, those records must be identified

individually. The remainder of open-in-full records may still be identified with one RIF

as being the contents of the same folder.

Act. To the extent that the records previously have been reviewed,

there is little value in re-reviewing the records. The ARRB staff will

survey the Microfilm 201 in an effort to identify any additional

records that have not already been acted upon by the Board. All

records not previously acted upon by the Board will be so

designated, a RIF will be prepared, and they will be sent for Board

action. The remaining Microfilm 201 will be transferred to the JFK

Collection at NARA and operied in full in 2017.

-Strategy:

The "working files" is a group of records that was assembled at

CIA by Russ Holes. Although he was not asked formally by CLA

to create this separate records group, he did so in order to facilitate.

his work and, perhaps, to satisfy his own curiosity. The group

contains many original records (copies of some of which are

already in the collection) and it includes some records of which we

are aware of no other copies. It is the best-organized collection of

assassination records held by CIA. Its value as a reference tool is

greatest as a collection. Therefore, though the file contains many

duplicates of records found in the JFK collection, the ARRB staff

recommends that it be preserved as a single group. Duplicates and

open-in-full documents should be treated in the same manner as

they are in the rest of the JFK Collection. As, with the microflm

from the Sequestered Collection, the ARRB staff has no objection to

the records being identified on the folder level provided that all

records in the folder are open-in-full. If there are records in which

CIA is requesting redactions, those records must be identified

individually. The remainder of open in full records may still be

identified with one RIF as being the contents of the same folder.

D. Additional Records

-status:

Research, requests, and negotiations continue to identify and

include additional CIA records for the JFK collection.

Oswald Office of Security File. As a result of an ARKB staff request

for additional information and records,. CIA located portions of a

previously undisclosed Office of Security file on Lee Harvey

Oswald. This seven-volume file, of which six parts have been

located, contains two volumes of press clippings, third agency

material on Oswald, a copy of Oswald's address book, and Marina

Oswald's INS file. In the upcoming months CIA will begin to

review and process these materials.

- time line:

Completion by July 31, 1998.

- strategy:

Continue current efforts.

activity be excised from any documents released under the

auspices of the JEK Assassination Record Collection Act of 1992.

While the teltap activity mentioned in the documents under review

occurred some thirty plus years ago, the joint teltap operation

with Mexican liaison has never been terminated; it continues to

this day in a slightly different form.

2. Release of any information that would constitute

official USG acknowledgment of the existence of the joint teltap

operation would have a serious adverse impact on current

operations.

Relations between the Station and the liaison)

service would be affected, with the likely outcome of

discouraging liaison from cooperating in similar ventures in the

future with Mexico City Station.

Official acknowledgment of the

existence of the joint teltap in the 1960's would embarrass the ?

(liaison service given Mexico's strong brand of nationalism

and

sensitivity towards the issue of sovereignty vis a vis the United

States.

(The service probably would terminate its cooperation)

with the Station on the current joint teltap operation in order

to be able to defend itself against domestic critics.

The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992

Public Law 102-526, October 26, 1992

Introduction to the Assassination Records Review Board

The Assassination Records Review Board is an independent federal agency created to oversee the

identification and release of records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

The Review Board was established by The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records

Collection Act of 1992 (PL 102-526), and was signed into law by President George Bush. The

five members of the Board were appointed by President Clinton, confirmed by the United States

Senate, and sworn in on April 11, 1994.

The law gives the Assassination Records Review Board the mandate and the authority to

identify, secure, and make available all records related to the assassination of President Kennedy.

The Board has until September 30, 1998 to fulfill its mandate.

The Review Board Members

The Review Board consists of the following members:

1. The Honorable John R. Tunheim, Chair; United States District Court Judge, District of

Minnesota.

2. Dr. Henry F. Graff; Professor Emeritus of History at Columbia University.

3. Dr. Kermit L. Hall; Dean, College of Humanities, and Professor

of History and Law at The Ohio State University.

4. Dr. William L. Joyce; Associate University Librarian

for Rare Books and Special Collections at Princeton University.

5. Dr. Anna K. Nelson; Distinguished Adjunct Historian in Residence at The American

University.

The Law

The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act was enacted by the

Congress and signed into law by President George Bush on October 26, 1992. The law states

"All Government records concerning the assassination of President John F. Kennedy should carry

a presumption of immediate disclosure."

The law mandates that all assassination-related materials be housed in a single collection in the

National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

The Act defines five categories of information for which disclosure may be postponed, including

national security, intelligence gathering, and privacy -- provided there is "clear and convincing

evidence" of some harm which outweighs public disclosure.

The law requires all federal agencies to make an initial assessment of whether they possess

records relating to the assassination. The agencies themselves will conduct an initial review to

determine whether their records may be disclosed immediately or whether disclosure should be

postponed. The agencies must then give all records that are not disclosed to the Review Board.

The Review Board will then evaluate all agency decisions to postpone the release of records.

Once the Board completes its review of an agency's recommendation for postponement, all

records, including those that have a postponed release date, will be transferred to NARA. The

Act requires that all assassination records must be opened by 2017, with the exception of records

certified for continued postponement by the President.

Authority of the Assassination Records Review Board

The Senate report of The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of

1992 stated that " the underlying principles guiding the legislation are independence, public

confidence, efficiency and cost effectiveness." In order to achieve these objectives, the Act gave

the Board the specific powers to:

* direct government offices to provide identification aids and organize assassination records;

* direct government offices to transmit assassination records to the National Archives;

* obtain assassination records that have been identified and organized by a Government office;

* direct government offices to investigate the facts, additional information, records, or testimony

from individuals which the Board has reason to believe is required;

* request the Attorney General to subpoena private persons to compel testimony, records, and

other relevant information;

* require any Government office to account in writing for the destruction of any records relating

to the assassination of President Kennedy;

* receive information from the public regarding the identification and public disclosure of

assassination records; and

* hold hearings, administer oaths, and subpoena witnesses and documents.

Background and Need for the Law

On November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated while traveling in a

motorcade in Dallas, Texas. His tragic death, and the subsequent murder of Lee Harvey Oswald,

the President's alleged assassin, led to the creation of The Warren Commission, seven days after

the assassination.

Amid continuing public doubts that all of the facts surrounding the assassination had not come to

light, the House of Representatives established the House Select Committee on Assassinations in

1976 to reopen the investigation.

In addition to these two major federal investigations devoted to the investigation of the

assassination of President Kennedy, three other federal investigatory bodies have dealt with the

assassination to some degree. President Ford created The Rockefeller Commission in 1975 to

investigate Central Intelligence Agency activities within the United States. Part of the

Commission's efforts related to the Kennedy assassination. Also in 1975, Congress created the

Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence

Activities (the Church,Committee) and the House Select Committee on Intelligence (the Pike

Committee). Some of the work of these committees was related to the assassination.

Despite these official investigations and with private researchers continuing their efforts, the

public was not satisfied that all of their questions about the assassination of President Kennedy

had been answered. The result was the passage of The President John F. Kennedy Assassination

Records Collection Act of 1992, which included the creation of the Assassination Records

Review Board.

Contacting the Assassination Records Review Board

The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 provides that the

Review Board has the authority to "receive information from the public regarding the

identification and public disclosure of assassination records."
