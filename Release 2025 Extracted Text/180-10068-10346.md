Assassination Records Review Board

Final Determination Notification

AGENCY : HSCA

RECORD NUMBER

: 180-10068-10346

RECORD SERIES : STAFF PAYROLL RECORDS

AGENCY FILE

NUMBER

December 8, 1995

Status of Document:

Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 15

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors

including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United

States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 4

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could

reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of

privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

Substitute Language: SSN

Octo 20, 1977

Dear Tom:

Here, without further delay or adue, is my repayment of the overpayment.

You will note that it is made out to the U.S. Treasury or the Committee. This is

due to the fact that I never recieved your note of September 15, so I was not

sure who this was to be made out to. You may instruct those fine fellows at the

Payroll Department, however,

that I had an exquisitely fine time with my unexpected

'manna from bureaucratic heaven'.

Also, I wish you would advise Donovan to advise Blakey's office that I am

still waiting breathlessly for their letter of recommendation. Please tell him

(them)

that I will not be able to obtain credit for my arduous labors of the summer

ng a to a so to.

until I recieve some sort of recommendation.

Thus, with all the sincerety due the occasion, I am,

Sincerely,

found Foun

John J. Farmer, JI.

PiS. Say hello to Kevin Walsh and Edwin Lopez for me. Tell Edwin that I am now

a lifetime member of the "Reggie Jackson for Messiah" fan club.

Dear John:

In reference to my letter of September 15, 1977, the

House Finance Office informs me that in settling your over-

payment, they will adjust various withholdings, that were made

from your salary.

Accordingly,

the amount of the check that you send to

us should be $199.38

instead of $220.00.

Dear John:

Through an oversight, the Research Unit failed

to notify the Budget Office that you had terminated

your services with the Select Committee.

Asa

consequence, you were overpaid for the month of

August.

As I understand the facts, you worked through

Friday, August 12 and that Mr. Gay gave you vacation

through Friday, August 19. Therefore, you were

overpaid for the period August 20-31,

1977 which

amounts to a gross

salary of $220.00:

If you agree with the facts, I must request

from you in the name of the House of Representatives,

the return of House funds in the amount of $220.00.

The check should be made payable to the U.S.

Treasury and sent to me in care of the Committee.

If you dispute the facts, kindly get in touch

with me as soon as possible so that we can settle

the matter.

Kind regards and good luck in your classes at

school.

Sincerely!

Ga

John Farmer

Early August, 1977, John Farmer, The Committee's

summer intern, informed me that he would be registering

for classes on August 26, 1977, and would like some time

off commencing August 15, 1977, so he could vacation with

his family for two weeks.

Based on the countless hours he devoted, and on

John's overall performance, which was exceptional, I took

it upon myself to grant him the week of August 14, 1977

to accommodate his vacation plans.

Therefore, he should

have been taken off our payroll

ending August 20, 1977.

However, I erred in failing to notify you earlier

on the above, as I thought I had already done..

Therefore,

John Farmer was in fact paid for the remainder of the month

of August, 1977.

Should there be additional questions on this matter.

please contact me immediately.

Furthermore, I can assure

you that in the future, you will be notified immediately

with regard to personnel changes.

Thank you.
