COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL (contd)
William M. Kent
Clandestine Service, one of my prime responsibilities is to try to
reestablish the integrity of the current letter evaluations used in
fitness reports and one of the first places for me to start is in my
own Staff.
With that said, I do wish to underscore the fact that Mr. Kent
is a responsible and responsive professional who knows what he has
to do, does it with a minimum of fuss, writes clearly and to the point,
is dedicated and in my judgment fully warrants an overall evaluation
of strong. The above comments will be shown to the rater as well
as the ratee.
SECRET
SECTION D Narrative Comments (Continued)
languages (Spanish and Italian), and his admirable command of English
prose which enables him to write crisp operational communications
wita speed and precision, all aid him in carrying out his responsibilities
in a superior manner.
Subject does not become a victim of routine. In addition to
developing the effective referrals system noted above, he has also
on his own initiative created our own "skills bank" in which we are
able to locate suitable NOC candidates, and those on board, in terms
of needed professional or area experience, rare and esoteric language
skills, etc. to the point that we can supply "leads" to divisions
in a matter of minutes. (Several hundred NOC applicants and on-board
personnel have thus been listed by skills bank criteria.)
Subject constantly seeks to make the NOC Branch a more meaningful
and useful management tool. I find him a thoughtful and canny colleague,
careful to observe in full the regulatory limits of our activity but
quick to perceive opportunities to support and assist the divisions
within those limits. He is a firm, fair, no-nonsense supervisor of
Branch personnel. He speaks his mind, honestly but tactfully, when
differences occur between him and me. It is my conviction that he is
ready to enter into the upper reaches of staff and supervisory echelons
of the Directorate and has by now proven that he is as adept at staff
responsibilities as he was previously impressive in his field and
desk operational responsibilities. In short, a comer and a cherished
colleague.

In Februay 1976,0001
1976,000llowing the emergency hospitalization and
retirement of my duty, Subject became my new deputy, a position he
has filled since that time in addition to performing most of the
assignments he had been tasked with earlier. His undiminished energy
and enthusiasm for his work is a hall-mark of his performance since
that time. Subject has, on his own initiative, developed our referrals
system (finding new NOC applicants and those on board for filling
specific area priority needs) to a point where it is serving the entire
Directorate with distinction and precision, especially in the "crisis"
areas of NOC needs, such as Africa and Near East Divisions. Thanks
to his creation of an orchestrated system of finding and "shopping"
new-hire applicants with rare skills, we have also begun to serve
the newly-created Clandestine Corps program with dozens of such
applicants, in addition to serving normal area division NOC needs.
As a Branch supervisor, Subject deals with the entire spectrum

performance "is so exceptional to requirements of the work and in comparison of

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT
SUBJECT:
Mr. William M. Kent, Period: 1 January 30 May 1977
1. As I depart from the assignment as Chief, Non-
official Cover Branch, Career Management Staff, I should
like to make a final comment on the performance of Mr. Kent
who has served with me during the entire period of my
assignment and who, since March 1976, has been my deputy.
More specifically, the period since 1 January 1977 has been
a trying one for this component and has culminated with its
sudden transfer from one component (CMS) to another (ADDO/D).
2. During this most recent period, Mr. Kent has
demonstrated his capacity for growth and leadership.
He has
himself handled virtually all of the transition aspects for
the Branch, involving briefings and counsel for his new
overall chief (the ADDO/D) and for his new branch chief.
He has served in the past 30 days substantially as acting
branch chief, given my fairly lengthy TDY absence abroad
during that period. I can only reiterate my judgment in the
last fitness report that Kent is a senior and mature supervisory
officer, very well organized in his work habits and capable
of making measured judgments and decisions. His continuity
in all aspects of nonofficial cover and its ramifications makes
him a valued and valuable staff officer.
future contribution lies in the entire area of managing and
I would say his
guiding Directorate personnel.
I have noted the clear progress
he has made in the past year in taking supervisory decisions
involving personnel, firmly and crisply.
3. Given his impressive field and Headquarters experience,
Kent should be given an opportunity to display his worth in
future Directorate assignments involving discretion,
professionalism and maturity. I give him an unquestioned "Strong"
for this final period he has served with me.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS
Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to
overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment
on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section C to provide best
basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties and cost consciousness
in the use of personnel, space, equipment and funds, must be commented on, if applicable. If extra space is needed to complete
Section D, attach a separate sheet of paper.
healthy skepticism enables him to contribute materially to the
smooth, still on-going, transition from the old to the new way.
In this context he has made invaluable suggestions on how we
shall proceed in order to improve the operational efficacy of
a NOC officer, as well as to ease the burdens imposed on the
private life of a NOC officer.
3. Worthy of special note is the systematic and orderly fashion
in which he tackled each new problem. These attributes resulted
in his solving many of the thorny personnel problems which have
confronted us of late. Mr. Kent's industriousness together with
his legendary meticulousness have enabled him to set up an
effective referral system through which we control the flow-
through of both traditional and new NOC officers a most
difficult and at times frustrating task.
4. As a deputy and acting branch chief he has been a firm
and stern supervisor who exacts precision and perfection from
his subordinates. The firmness and sterness, however, are
tempered by a judicious application of human understanding
or compassion in cases of "hard-to-place" NOC officers. His
advice in solving many of these cases to the satisfaction of
both the officer and the operational component involved was
most welcome.
5. In sum, Mr. Kent has been a most effective deputy. As
noted above, he has many outstanding traits and his overall
