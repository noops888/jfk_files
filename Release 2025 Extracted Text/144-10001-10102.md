The statement by the Texas state authorities that the slaying of

OSWALD closes the investigation of the KENNEDY assassination brought on public

journalists) of the intentions of the Dallas police who conducted the'

reactiong of doubt by some segments of the information medla (commentatives ti

This in turn facilitated the decision of the federal authorities to

step into the investigation immediately. R. KENNEDY's hand can also be seen

in this.

Therefore, a struggle between the right and groups close to KENNEDY

will continue over the political implications of the attempt. It must be

expected that in the near future it will pass to more basic matters of foreign

and internal policies of the new president. Although the right was not success-

ful, so far, in obtaining a high degree of anti-comnunist tension in the

community, and force, in this way, JOHNSON to immediately withdraw from

KENNEDY's line, undoubtedly the reaction expanded its influences.

Its repre-

sentatives in Congress,

HICKENLOOPER. for example, began an open attack against

KENNEDY's policy of seeking agreements with the Soviet Union, emphasizing with

this the hope that JOHNSON will not be such an "inexperienced" politician.

In the UN great importance is attached to JOHNSON's talks with

MIKOYAN, DE GAULLE and ERHARD (the level and number of the FRG delegation

attached special attention). The Western delegations of Europeans and Scandi-

navians, with whom we talked, avoided any speculation whatsoever as to the

of the talks.
