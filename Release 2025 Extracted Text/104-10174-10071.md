ICNORAITINI CE CONTZIRSATIOLI

SUBUTOr: Congress for Cultural Ireodua

1. On 15 August, l discussed the Serlia Cultural Congrega

with Kenneth I farbley, with porticular demhasis on the proble

of bringins tee contlnuing Congress orgarisation under control

and, at the sane tune, expardles li into an effective anti-

costrunist reapon:

2. I expressed to Hanbley our concern over the manner 1n

which charlos 1. Steges had condected beself during the Congress.

and Evabler replied that he had bees equally conceruca.

Ee sa1d,

hoveror, trat vallo steles activitles had crused an unfavorablo

reaction on the part-of a muber of the delegates, that reaction

had bear nore direated against Steres persoully than agalast sin

as a representative of tho gover-cent.

Enabley rerood with my

suggestion that two bits of silver lining could bo found in the

steggs cloud, nanely that he had trian zost of the opposition

beat kimself, tims sparlog sond of our other pooplo, and that

he bad concucted himself Ilko agrtking dut the "Polizoispltsel"

the corist press of Germany bade bin out to be.

In fact.

sald Hsibler, Skeges general attitude vas such as to cause sone

of the delegates to disrenciber that Sregse vas attached to the

coTerment In an fashion or presmably subject to any disciplle

at all.

Handley said that nost of the delegates with whon he

bad talked ver perfectly willied so accept the explanation that

the Congress vas aniled upon bj: the United Statos Govorment to

the extent that some offielal funds vere suppliod for the plysical

steging of the meeting (es indeed they vere) but that the rest

of the money cano from somewhat ragse acofficial sources in the

United States.

Those sto suspected sonething more, with the

exception of the trevor-Roper froup, vard generally hoppy that

the Unlted States was doing sonething of this kind and were is

no mood to sat any arbarrassing questlons or raise any delicate

polats.

4.

I asked fanblgy What be thought his future role in the

Coniress should be. He replied that he was gerfectly willing o

undertake ant activities we asked la to undertake but personally

felt he stold retire into the beckeroud as rapidly as possible.

Congrees, as the spark plug and leadise light. This unsatisfactory poaltion

vas anticipated by Mr. Wiener, who, In his approval of Project PDQUICK,

cautioned agninet espbasia on Insig's participation. (Attachrent A).

3.

Fron the beginning, the hoze office was cogaizant of the danger of

a spotlight being throw on any cert t. S. euployee, and, in addition to.

previous varnligs, on 7 April cabled specific instractions for the retire-

the Intelligence auspices of the I. S. and that this accusation vould be

SUBJECT:

LINDSAY

OTF.IB

Project FEQUICK

With reference to my conversation with Mr. Baker concera-

ing the project outline covering the subject project. I have approved

this project subject to the following condition.

It nakes no sense

te ze that we saould state In paragraph 6 andor the beading of security

tcat all practicable reasures vill be takes to dioguiso the official

V. S- Interest, Maarcial and otherwise; and at the same time to pra-

vide that one of the two active aponsore will be Mr. Melvin J. Laoky,

editor of the ovort MICOG monthly mugazine "Der Monat.". I underotand

that Mr. Lasky 18 needed as one of the principal organizers and opera-

tives but I think 1t quite unnecessary for hie sane to be flourished

socat as a aponsor. Attor all, be lo officially employed by HIcOG--

he 1s, therefore, an acknouledged menier of tho U.S. apparatuo la

Germany.

Why then should bis name be used?

Reuter 18 an excellent

sponsor and surely it will be possible to find one or core others--

nor-derican or at least non-official American--to serve as sponsoro.

2.

Generally in the same connaction I assume that our con-

sultant,

Mr: Burnhat, will operate In the wings aid that hio reso

x1l1

not be too prosiently displayed.

As the

result of his recent

book and the farco of conminiat concentary, he le a "sitting duck"

but the more his par-

¿icipation can be ln the form of "off-stage ahispera" the ketter.

Dear Colonel

Walter Henring finally got off last night. There

was no roon on

Saturday's plane for trich he stood by, tut he was scheduled to take a

Sunday morring plane.

Drie to sone mechanical difficulty, that plane did

not leave until last night.

The American Epress Co. Kas unofficially

intormed that as

a result of President Truran's intervention all other

planes were chartered for the stranded students.

Buttles about getting tr. hehring

on one of the crartered planes if

the scheduled flight did not get off last night. If léhrire, too, did

not turt up our counter-Grosz campaign would have zooked bad.

I therelore

felt that he raistileare even if it meant being present at only part of the

Congress.

I received a letter from George ros? mich. I requested when I spoke

to dirs. Grosz:

"rere is my statement:

I regret not to be able

to attend the Congress for Cultural Freedom. ly

reasons are entireir personal.

I am deligated with your efforts to mobilize

Art and scientists of the world for Freedon and Peace."

•Die Sowjetarmee - das Bollwerk des Erledens

1st das äctto einex Ausstellung, die an 17.3.50. in laus der

Kultur der Sowjetuniod eröffnet wurde.

In einer blumengeschmückten Vorhalle und dres Rüuen sieht

naz Bilder, Lundkarten nit Erläuterungen und großplakatierte

Zliate. Das ganse könnte man als einen kriegsgeschichtlichen

Schnellkursus der yowjetischen Armee bezeichnen. Haffen, Unlfors

men und dergleichen, was sonst in Heeresnuseen zu finden ist,

werden hier nicht gezeigt. Auch tochnisch ist über den heutigen

Stand der Armee nichts Neues zu entnenmen. Die Ausstellung trägt

mehr ideologischen Charakter und eine bestinnte politische Iena

dens. Die äufere Ausstattung ist dekorativ sehr sorgfältig und

kunstlerisch gemacht.

Die Bilder beginnen zeitlich mit deadlden aus der Revolutions=

zolt in Cktober 1917, als dio ersten Irupps bewsifnoter Arbeiter

sich zur "Roten Garde" zusammenschlossen. Stets stehen schon hier

Lenin und Stalin Seite an, Seite.

Auf nehreren Landkarten werden-sodann die Feldzuge des Bürgers

krieges Illustriert, in deren Verlauf die Rote Armee nacheinander

die fremden Invasiongtruppen sowie 1hre inneren neiß-russischen

Gegner besiegte. Von Härz bis Oktober 1019 ging es gegen die von:

Osten anrückenden Truppen Koltschaks, nachdem schon 1918 brit1=

sche Expeditionstruppen von lurnanst aus vergeblich Ins Land olu

zudringen versucht hatten. Bedrohlicher für die Junge Sowjeta

macht wurden damála (1919/20) die Vorstose Denekins von Süden her,

die jedoch Ende 1920 mit

einen vollen Sieg der Böten Armee und

Vertreibung der Gegrer aus der Krim endeten. Auch des polnischen

Angriffs erwehrte aich die Rote Arnee. Schließlich gelang es

abwickelten. Unter einem Bilde von einer sowjetischen Haffen-

¡abrik stehts " "Dia sowjetische Armee errang ihre Erfolgo mit

In einer Inschrift zu 10 großen strategischen Bowegungen der

Armeen im Jahre 1944 beißt as: "In der so entstandenen Situation

war es klar, daß die Sowjetunion auch ohne Hilfe der Verbündeten

La Stande ist, ganz Deutschland zu besetzen und auch Frankreich

zu befreien".

The communist youth rass sooting planned for ferlin durlag tho

major prousganda offonsivo by the Russians and by German communists.

It has followed the charscterictic Soviet pattern of creating confusion

and tenseness on the part of the propaganda tariets achieving this ob-..X

alternating bolligorent threats with peaceful platitudes.

The throats have ranged fron doclarations tust the communist youth rould

drive the Festern invorialists out of terlin to outright gtatements that

they woulri seize the estorn Eerlin government and restore the city to

a unifiar, peaceful capital of Germany.

The peaceful declarations. have

stated that the demonstration of 500,000 toys and girls (from all over

Germany, and fros other countries) will chiefly take placo in Eastera

Berlin and will consist of rully-sarching;

sports everts, fironorks, and

huge peace neetings. Permission sas requestod ly the FDJ,

of Oberburger

meister Reuter; to march in a boig to the Olympic Stadiun (In the Eritish

Sector). but Reuter briefly and emplatically refused.

b. Turea groups are offlelally desling with the situation.

(1) The Ferlin Alliod Ko-maniatura

(2) 1 co nittee under Oburgormeister Reuter

(3) A special HICOG committea.

The police force has bean augmented and provided with riot equipment.

c. It is now estirated that it is not the intention of the communists

to make a serious effort to drive the ilestern occupyin, forces out of

Eerlis, or to sciza the fest city government. lowover, their campain has

succeedad to this extent, that it 1s not know whother or not they will

attempt an actual putsch, or if they will adopt a policy of opportunism

and probe-and-thrust at Test Ferlin defences with the deteruination to

advence as far as they can; or if they will, in fact, confine theaselves.
