Valeriy Vladinirovich KOSTIKOV: He is a 38-year-old officer of

the KGB who occupies the cover position of Second Secretary. He

first visited Mexico in 1959 for a Soviet Industrial Exposition

and later came from Septenber 1961 until August 1965. He

returned again in September 1968 to replace another KGB officer.

KOSTITOV is considered to be one of the most effectivo and dan-

gerous

of the intelligence officers in lexico. He has had a

wide range of responsibilities which have included operations

among emigre groups in western Mexico, operations directed

against the United States and currently against the governments.

of Central: America. He presently meets with exiles from Guate-

mala, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Honduras. He is known to have

-passed funds to these groups as well as tactical guidance.

Communist Party (FST) exile organization

in Mexico.

LIREBEL-2 reported that he

arrived at BALCARCEL's home at 2000 hours on the cir, and found cALCAPcEl about

to leave.

BALCARCEL requested that LIPFEEL-2 tare him to a garage where his

car was being repsired, which LIREBEL-2 did. Since BALCARCEL's ear was not ready,

BALCARCEL asked LIREBEL-2 to drive him to a meeting which he had schedulea for

2100 hours with his "Soviet contact."

rote: BAiRCEL had previously told

LIREBEL-2 that Valery KOSTIKOV was his contact in the Soviet Embassy.) LIPEBEL-2

and BAICARCEL drove to the

"parque Escondido,

"also known as" the

"farque t'undido, "

lorated on Insurgentes Sur between Gorez carlas and Millet Streets.

parked and BALCARCEl, held his meeting with his "Soriet contact" standing on the

sidewalk of Gomez Farias Street bordering on the park. The reeting lasted for

30 minutes.

BALCARCRI, commented after re-joining LIREBEL-2 that his "Soviet contact"

had been very upset about a long distance telephone call which he had received

from a Guatemalan student.

The student had asked io talk to the Soviet by true

name and asked his for sone information on the Soriet national soccer team, which

is scheduled to play some games in Guate=ala.

the Soviet told BALCARCEl that he

had told the student that he could not provide any current inforation on this

subject, and that the student should iry to get this information from El Salvador,

where the team was to play some games. prior to their arrival in Piaterala..

BALCARCEL said that the soviet was angry that this student had asked for him by

true name, and he speculated that the University Students Association (AEU) leader

who was recently in Mexico (see Reference B) may have been indiscreet in giving

his nave out to unauthorized persons.

SOVIET EX-BASSY IN MEXICO HAS LARGE

STAFF WHICH DOES LITTLE WORK

by Carlos jontiel

Source:

Costa Rica

La Prensa Libre (Free Press), 6 Way 1969, San Jose,

Mexico City -- In a letter addressed to our editorial

dopartment Peruvian newsmen informed me that, being acquainted.

with my article "Ahora Peru" (low Peru], they asked that country's

chancellor, Edgardo Jarrin, whether the arrival of a Soviet trade

mission in Peru would be only the prelude to another more important

mission, that of Soviet diplomatic representation.

lack

In that article I observed that members of the Soviet®

embassy in Mexico City had predicted in that city's social

circles that in less than 2 weeks Peru would establish diplomatic :

relations with the Krenlin at the embassy level.

According to the letter, barely 3 days later the Lina daily

La Prensa confired with prominent play the report that I had made

In El Universal Grafico whose substance I had obtained thanks to

the indiscretion of Soviet diplomats included in the "cocktail

circuit" organised here arong the ambassadors and trade representatives

of foreign countries.

## Page 68

14-00000

I recall that also in El Universal Grafico my colleague,

Alonso Fonseca G., published a noto entitled "Alegres Diplomaticos"

(Tipsy Diplonats) recounting the entertaining story of the "binge

of Vladislav Koromovshkin and Valery Kostikov, attache and second

secretary respectively of the Sordet estassy in l'exico. These

officials began their spree "between glasses of expensive sines

in the 'red' district of liexico City but had to bring their

adventure to a close at Ciudad Victoria amidst the abuse they

„hurled at l'exico under the diplomatic immunity which they enjoyed."

Apparently, the Soviet diplomats not only have given up decent beha

but are also demonstrating their incompetence.

. $+

The Peruvian chancellor, Mercado, Jarrin, who announced the

arrival of the Soviet trade mission, answered the newsmen's question

with a laconic comment that "at the appropríate time you will learn

whether the government has decided to take that step"'lof establish-

ing diplomatic relations with the USSR). Before the Lima government

"decides to take that step," we would like to reproduce these tro

paragraphs which the journalist Bernardo, Escalante published in ani

;ima article entitled "La Embajada Misteriosa" (The Mysterious Babassy)

in the newspaper El Sol de lexico.

"The strange thing is that the Soviet embassy is onè af

those with the largest staff but with the least to do. Those

branches that have contact with the public -- consular sectior,

cultural section, tourist agency -- work only 4 hours a wees. Che

can count the number of léxicans applying for a Russian visa on the

fingers of one hand. Trade between l'exico and the USSR is practically

nil, The 'cultural relations, ' as evervone knows, consist simly,

In making propaganda 'fron one place to another' inasnuch as

in the land of Brezhner and Kosygin they do not even have a

remote idea of what lexico 1s like.

"hat is this plethora of Soviet personnel used for

then in that embassy where not even a single l'exican citizen is

employed, where the doestics themselves are Soviet, in that

huge mansion that could serve as a den of vampires? The mystery

deepens if one considers that the lexican embassy staff in koscow

barely numbers six or seven employees whereas the USSR has more

than a hundred in Mexico. Why does the Soviet Union have such a

large erbassy siaff in our country if it does what ours does in

Moscow?"

TIPSY DIPLOIZES

by Alonso Fongeca G.

Sourco: •

This is the amusing story of a "spree" which began in

the frosty dawn of 12 December among bubbles of expensive

wines in the "red lipht" district of lexico City and reached

its conclusion very far off, at Ciudad Victoria. What are

involved are two Narxist-Leninists froz the Soviet Union who,

on breaking, the chains of disgraceful tyranny weighing on

respéclable diplomats, "tanked up" in tourgeois bars, not in

order to cheer up and forget

some sorrorful.episode or other

that inared at their hearts but rather to fire a broadside of

abuse and insults at Mexico and Mexicans under the pretext.

¿that when ore 19 "tipsy" everything that he does is absolved.

The diplomats of the Russian embassy in Mexico, Valery

Fostikoy, second secretary, and Vladislav Koromovstirin, attache,

not only forgot auong hippies the socialist ethics in order to

Indulre in a "small drink among those wio are in the limelight"

but, in the midst of a biz "binge" made possible by hatefui

capiralist brandy and whiskey, tiey decided to accompany four

encircers of PEMEX (Petroleos Mexicanos; l'exican Petroleun) in

• an old autorobile to Cludad Mante. On the way, after the

custozary excesses that alcoholic fumes provoke, the "wine"

drove the Hussians to the worst extremes of crudeness excio ivi

without. any of the "acadenic bearing" that the Frierdship

University of loscow notes as the rajor assets acquired by the

proressive men of Leninism. Accordingly, abuse rained on

the Mexicans.

The four PEMEX. engineers, as any well-born sons would

have done, delended their country with firmness. Thereupon,

the Mussians suddenly became transformed into diplorat-gunmen;

brandishing, their weapons at the engineers. However, no jous:

because Russians are better at getting ready to handle remote-

cortrolled spaceships directed at the moon than in the skillful

discharge of prosaic pistols, they found themselves disarmed 1-

short order by the Mexicans.

On reaching, Cindad Victoria the PElEX engineers handed

the Russian attaches and their guns over to the local authorities.

Despite the unanimous desire of all those present to see the

Soviet represertatives get their comeupparce the latter, with

insultiar, arrogance, Insisted that their diplomatic isunity be

respected.

Let us compare the aggrersive stance of both Muscovites

with the chirese government of lão ise-ture so insistent or

Forwarded herewith Is a characterizatlon of Subject prepared by Douglas

2. It is Interesting to no:e that LICOWL-| describes KOSTIKOV as follows:

He Is a man who would do anything to anybody. He is without morals, education

or manners. He uses foul language and has no respect for others. When

KOSTIKOV drinks at his (LICOWL-l's) establishment, with Sovler women present,

KOSTIKOV will run his hand over the legs of the wives of other Soviet employees,

while ther husbands are present, and thinkno:hing of it. According to LICOWL-1,

the husbands say nothing when KOSTIKOV does this. (Comment: However, from

a recent LICOWL-l rape, It appears that Yurly. Aleksandrovich ANDRIANOV,

GRU chauffeur, was complaining to Viktor Petrovich KALININ, administrative

employee, that his wife was running around with KOSTIKOV and he (ANDRIANOV)

was golng to say something to KOSTIKOV - someday - but had no: said a word to

him as yet.)

Valerly Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV

Valerly Viadimkrovich KOSTIKOV is approximately 35 years of age,

corpulent and paunchy, with a rouad somewhat fleshy face that sports a

5 o'clock shadow, and wears oversized tinted glasses In dark heavy frames,

which partially obscure a palr of small, but plercing eyes. H's heavy jowla,

thin lips, wide nosirlls and dark halr add to an impression that his features

are more of a Semlic, or a Near-Eastern type than that of a Slav. A

shapeless dark sult-coat, carelessly put over a whire shirt, with unbuttoned

collar, through which protrudes a suft of dark hair complete a photograpà of

Valerly ViadimIrovich KOSTIKOV, Attache ot the Consular Office and

IdentIfied member of the KGB.

KOSTIKOV arrived in Mexico In December 196l and assumed his duties

as an attache at the USSR Consulate at the Soviet Embassy In Mexico City.

Owing to his extrovert nature and propensity for drinking, he soon acquired

several "buddies" of simllar background and with simllar tastes. Among

these Individuals, his closest assoclates have been, or still are, the folloiring"

Vitally Borisovich SHUBIN, Attache and Ident fled member of the KGB, wbo ::

left for the USSR In July 1964; Ivan Gavrilovich ALFERIYEV, Pravda Corres-

pondent and KGB officer, who left for the USSR in October 1964; and Oleg

MaksImovich NECHIPORENKO, VIce-Consul and idearifled member of the KGB,

who is still in Mexico, and who has accep:ed KOSTIKOV into his circle of

Intimate frlends.

GOV I to HiMA 2551 l

## Page 152

However, It was mostly with S-UBIN and ALFERIYEV that KOSTIKOV

felt entirely at ease. Meny a time KOSTIKOV would talk to either one of

them en the phone and indulge in a friendly exchange of obscenities, where-

as he has never spoken to NECHIPORENKO In a Ilke manner, even though.

KOSTIKOV has been a frequent guest at NECHIPORENKO's house. KOSTIKOV

developed an exceedingly close relatlonship with SHUBIN. They used to

travel together to varlous parts of the country and to spend time together

with thelr familles at the Casino de la Selva, a hoiel In Cuernavaca. But

it was ALFERIYEV's wife Roza, who became the prime target of KOSTIKOV's

attentions. An emblttered acrimonious woman, Roza, who despised her

husband and had a fierce hatred for NECHIPORENKO, was transformed Into

a diiferent human being when KOSTIKOV talked to her on the phone in his

best unctuous and ingratiatlod manner. It is impossible ro say whether they

had sexual relatlons, but the obvlous and strong sexual overtones in Roza's

volce led one to presume that she had more than just a friendly Interest in

KOSTIKOV, who on the other hand, was probably using Roza as a target for

his amorous or Illicit asplrations. •

It seems :has KOSTIKOV Is quite preoccupled with matters of sex and li

given an opportunity would turn into a veritable profligate. Apparently his

---

## Page 153

#Le Roza has a tolerant attitude towards KOSTIKOV's probable incur-

sions into the domain of maltal infidelity, strice, on one occasion,

when KOSTIKOV had been Invited to a supposed stag party at ALFERIYEV's

home, and Roza KOSTIKOV had phoned to caution KOSTIKOV aga lust

drinking too mush, a woman answered the call and then called KOSTIKOV

to the phone. When Roza talked to KOSTIKOV li sounded that she was more

peeved at the fact that she had not been invited to the party rather than that .

other women were present there at the time.

" When KOSTIKOV started talking to his wlie on this particular call, he

already had had a few drinks and in disgulsed voice spoke to her In Spanisa,

French and English, possibly to Impress those who were present. His

Spanish is quite good and fluent, his French Is rather tolerable, but his

English Is somewhat stilted and of a school-room type. Possibly, he studled

these languages at the Moscow Instltute of Languages.

This fluency in Spanlsh affords KOSTIKOV a great latitude for making

friends among Mexicans and his easy-going earthy approach is presumably

of considerable help to him in developing contacis. Since his consular

dutles are quite negligible, he can easily engage in this sort of activity.

In fact, this neglect of official duties promped a heated argument between

NECHIPORENKO and the visiting Sovler correspondent Timur GAYDAR,

3152077

---

## Page 154

who declared tha: ostensibly the consular stalé does not preform any useful

function, but just loafs around. H's assertion has been confirmed In part

by the attitude of this particular group of Sovlet Embassy employses, w50

quite often seek some diversion of a non-intellectual type. Thus, on one

occasion, when a group of Sovlet touristihas a brlef stay In Mexio, one of

them - a woman, complalned during a phone call to the Embassy that

KOSTIKOV and Leonld Vasilyevich NIKIFOROV, Intourisi representative

In Mexico, had taken the group leaders to NIKIFOROY's apartment In

order to have a few drinks, leaving the rest of the tourlsts without any

Information about their next move and letting them shlft for themselves.

Since the departure of SHUBIN and ALRERIYEV, KOSTIKOV has startod

to "cultivate" NIKIFOROV, presumably as a potentlal drInkIng companion,

and has been talking to him on the phone a number of times recently in quie

a famillar tone of volce. It seems that. NIKIFOROV, a younger man, is

being Influenced by KOSTIKOV to a certain degree.

KOSTIKOV's family life does no: appear to be a siormy one; because bis

wife Roza A, sounds easy-going and friendly. She Is In charge of the Embassy's

dining-room. Her co-workers treat her with a good-humored tolerance and

a slight contemp:. KOSTIKOV's daughter Svetlana, born in 1959, seems to

be an average child, who does not present any outstanding prodems to her

parents.

---

## Page 155

14-00000

To sum sartze KOSTIKOV's character traits and abilitles: KOSTIKOV:

Is well trusted to take trips around the country In the company of another

Sovlet Embassy employee on varlous matters of Importance and, on

occaslons, he acts as an Interpreter for visking Soviet officlals. His

known physical defect Is weak eyes.

Sometime ago KOSTIKOV called up

an eye-speciallst for an appolntment, because his eyes were troubling him

and that is probably the reason for his wearing tinted glasses.. Sometimes

Mexicans refer to him as the man with glasses. It Is quite possible that an

auto accident KOSTIKOV had In Vera cruz may have been caused by his

somewhat defective vision and was not the result of carelessness. However,

when KOSTIKOV was excusing himseif fir it, GARMASHEY, to whom

he spoke on the phone, told him dryly that li was about time KOSTIKOV

learned to drive.

Owing to this shortcoming of having weak eyes and his physical make

up, KOSTIKOV does not participate In varlous indoor or outdoor sports as

much as do other members of the Soviet Embassy. It seems that billlards

are about the most strenuous execise that he undertakes. However, it must

not be surmised that he ls a weak individual in a physical sense and will

probably give a good account of himself if a situation will demand it.

Many of his intimate collaborators call him "Kopchenyy" or "Smoked"

---

## Page 156

which in Russian slang maj- mean an individual with a dark skin, or may

refer to the fact of his wearing tinted glasses, or it may signify that he went

through a school of hard knoc ka

It is quite cextaln that KOSTIKOV and ALFERIYEV belong to the same

group of former hoollgans, who by dint of sheer disregárd for moral

standards forged ahead and became "somebodles".

KOSTIKOV seema to be quite unsrupulous, ready to perform any sort

of task set before him, not in a cold and methodical way, but with a cer-

tain zest and bravado. It appears that he has no moral, religlous, or

any other type of scruples. He la vulgar, untly and lecherous, with a

penchant for using lewd and obscene expressions In conversation with

his "buddles", with whom be drinks quite a lot, circumstances permitlig

In addition, It must be noted that he is a shrewd and resourceful Individual

unquest lonably loyal to the Communist system.
