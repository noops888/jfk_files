1. On 9 Mar 11 we received a long distance call, presurably from Powder
Springs, Ceorgia, from subject, who is on old and unsavory contact of this
office dating from 1959. Werbell has been involved in a variety of scrapes,
the latest of which concerned an abortive Invasion of Haiti which John Creany
wan very much concerned about a year or so 030.
2. Werbell stated that the Departcent of Defense had just revoked his
cecurity clearance on grounds of Werbell's "frivolous behavior" in the Haitian
caper. Werbell stated i that he intended to "Light 1 It to the Sujrore C
Court" os
lic had always kept us and other elecents of the US Government inforced con-
corning developments in the Haitian matter.
3. Werbell asked if there was anything that we could do for him in the
way of interceiling for him with the bow, and we inforred him bluntly and in
no uncertain In terma that he was strictly on his cứu, 1, and we could do nothing
for his. He then asked if it would be worthwhile to subpoena Cart Gonzales.
We informed him that it was up to his attorney to take such recomendationg.
4. Werbell scened to get the message, and then offered to keep us advised
regarding an alleged forthcoming attempt on Haiti witch is being sponsored by
Rolando Fasferrer, even though Nasferrer is currently incarcerated in a federal
prison. He told Werbell that if he wished to pass any information along we
would accept it bat under no circunstances should he attempt to elicit any
Information on our behalf. He agreed that he would operate on this basis and
caid he might be in touch with us agam.
5. In view of Werbell's record we felt that this latest contact-phould
to a matter of record and that CCC should be informed of developments.

MIM-084-69
SUBJECT: Local OSI Inquiry Regarding Information on Mitchell
L. Werbel
1. On 15 May 1969, Special Agent Dave Ploumen, local OSI representative,
USAF, visited the Miami Field Office to solicit any information we might
have regarding Mitchell L. Werbell who apparently is undergoing a security
clearance check as the result of presently being caployed by a company
with a government contract.
2. Werbell was an unsolicited contact of this office beginning in
1959 and he reached peck notoriety In November 1967 as a result of his
Involvement in the Rolando Masferrer trial in connection with the abortive
Haitian Invasion. John Greaney, 050 was in iht the time to oversce
Agency interests.
3. Ploumen in contacting other US Goverment nencies locally
including the US Attorney's Office somehow, received an indication that CIA
had information on Werbell; thus Ploumen's visi to the Plant Field Office.
4. It was indicated to Ploumen, who is known personally by several
members of this staff, that we knew of Werbell and that on occasion he
had reported unsolicited information. It was suggested, however, that
Ploumen direct his request officially through channels via OST'gengehey
liaison officer in Washington.
5. This is for background and is being forwarded at the cuggestio
of local CIA Security.

THAT THE ATTEMPTED USE OF DCD/MIAMI AS A CHANNEL BY SHERES STEMMED

SUBJECT
Chief, LA Division
Mitchell Livingston Werbel III
1. I was advised by the Justice Department on 23 February that
Werbel has been indicted and the trial is scheduled to begin on 29 March
in Miami, Florida. The charges relate to importing and distributing
quantities of marijuana. With Werbel's propensity to raise his past
affiliations with the Agency, we can anticipate problems during this trial.
An additional problem is presented because Werbel is defended by Edwin
Marger who was the defense attorney for John Hawk in the B-26 case in
Buffalo, New York in 1966. It was Edwin Marger who subpoenaed the CIA
General Counsel as a defense witness.
2. The Justice Department has received information that a person
either currently or formerly affiliated with the CIA has been participating
in Werbel's meetings with his attorney. It would be appreciated if all
addressées could review their holdings on Werbel and determine if there
is any validity to any recent contacts with him. I would urge that instruc-
tions be sent to Miami that no, repeat no, contact with Werbel take place
between now and the beginning of the trial.
3. It would be helpful if each addressee could prepare a summary
of the various contacts Werbel has had with CIA in the past. Please chock
to see if you have any information on a Colonel Bayard who was killed in
Atlanta, Georgia during the summer of 1975. Bayard, reportedly an
associate of Werbel's, had previous contacts with the Agency. It would
be appreciated if your responses could be received by close of business
2 March.
