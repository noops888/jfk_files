CASTRO INTERVIEW ON RELATIONS WITH U.S.

telegram NI. 25-27 of 2 January 1964.

On 1 January Mr. FIDEL CASTRO granted an interview by

telephone to a newsman from the ABC radio and television

network. The Cuban leader repeated that he hoped to

normalize relations between his country and the United States,

and he added: "Henceforth it is up to the United States to

take a step in that direction." Mr. CASTRO stated that

"until the tragic death of President KENNEDY," he thought

that "the normalization of Cuban relations with the American

administration was possible." While acknowledging that

public opinion in the United States is still hostile to

Cuba and wants the naval blocade of the island strengthened,

he appeared "full of hope" as to the future of his relations

with President JOHNSON.

The Cuban Chief of Government even gave concrete proof

of his good will by bringing up the problem of the

indemnification of American citizens who were victims of

nationalization in the following terms: "We are ready to

speak of the indemnities due under the heading of the

nationalization of American property by the revolutionary((A)).

Thus, you can see that we are sincere when we say that we

are ready to talk, but that does not depend only on us."
