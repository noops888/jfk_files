I - CURREST BALANCE SUBET DE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRACY

2.

Parties of Current Significance. Christian Democratic

paities are gercially agreed to be of current political signlficance

in only four Latin American countries -- Chile, Venezuela, El

Salvador and Peru.

8.

The Chilean PDC is the only party with the xespon-

sibility of soverning; the solid victory of Prei in the 1964

presidential clection was followed by an even more impressive:

showing in the March 1965 congressional election. However, the

Party's refore program is being implerented with less chan

deliberate speed, no progress has been made in weakening

Martist lesdership domination of the urban labor force, and

indications are that Frei's moderation will be increasingly

challerged by the left wing of the PDC:

b.

The COPEI Party of Venezuela has strong hopes of

duplicating the victory of the Chilean Party in 1968 and

appests to have narrowed the gap between itself (22 percent

of the cicctorate in 1963) and the governing Accion Democratica

Party (32 percent).

COPEI Secretary General Rafael Calders,

onc of the few Latin American CD leaders of international

stature, is expected to be the Party's standard beazer in his

fourth try for the presidency.

c.

In El Salvador, the PDC garnered 29 percent of the

votes in the March 1966 legislative clection and one of 1t8

Icaders, Jose Napoleon Duarte, retained the mayoralty of San

Salvador.

In

less than six years the PDC has become the

leading opposition party. It has little chance of capturing

the presidency in 1967, but should be a strong contender by

1972,

with Notre Danc-educated Mayor Duarte the llkely

candidate.

d.

The Peruvian PDC formed a coalition with the Popular

Actica (P) Party in 1963; 1t currently holds two cabinet

positions.

Sove would argue that the Peruvian CD (with only

4 percent of the votes in 1963) has no real future in compe

tition with the dominant AP and the long-established APRA,

both refomist parties,

and thus should not be included in a

listing of significant CD parties.

Some weight is added to

this argucent by the very recent split off of

a dissident

faction of the PDO into a separate party. However, the

inclusion of the Peruvian party here is based primarily on the

fact that it is the only CD group participating in a coalition

government and chus contributes an element of stability to the

political scene in Peru.

Parties Of Moderate Potential, Applying even the most

generous criteris to the Judgcuent of potential, there are not

nore than four CD parties - in the Doninican Republic, Panama,

brazil and Guatcuila - that night develop as moderately important

"forces over the next five years.

The Doninican PRSC stands as a prime example of

CD' irresponsibility fron the tiue Caonabo Javier. took over

Party leadership in the wake of the Dominican Revolution in

April 1965. It has collaborated with the entire spectrum of

Matsist-lining parties, and moderation of its extreme

cilitancy in the near future appears unlikely.

The PRSC has

devalosed a suall but talented cadre of leadership, primarily

fron the university ranks, and is buttressed by the strongest

CLASC affillate (CASC) In the Benisphere:

The Panamanion PDC was registered some five years

ago sad polled only 3.1 perceat of the votes in 1964. Although

It continues a miniscule party, It has mado significant

organicational strides and its philosophy of social justice

gives it roots lacking by most Panamunian parties, which ara

largoly personalistic or tied to financial interests. "If the

Panera CD succeeds in expanding its middle-class base and

attracts militants fros the predominantly negro and nestizo

populstion, it could becone a force of some importance.

While the Brazilian PDC polled a mere 4 percent of

the voie in 1964, the Party has significant strength in three

"wuy staics of the Center-South (Parana, Sao Paulo, and

Cuanabera).

Like all other pre-Castello Branco political

parties; the PDC was unable to campaign under its own banner

in the presidential and parliimentary elections of late 1966.

Expanded political activity will probably be permitted after

the seating of. Prcsident Costa e Silva in March 196%, but It

is expected that the number of legally recognized political

parties will be limited.

have to merge with another party 1f it is to compete la the

legislative life of the country. If the. PDC joins with a

party that has strength outside the present PDC atrongholds,

and tha PDC message and mystique seta the tone for such a new

political entity, the net result could be expanded importance

for Christian Democracy in Brazil.

¿. The Guatemalan PDC was only recently recognized as

a legaily constituted party.

This nascent group has good

strength in the youth and student movement

and growth

potential in the important campesino sector. Current jirection

of the party leaves much to be desired; PDC leader Rene de

Leos eppears honest and intelligent but be has little organ-

izatioral flair or charisma.

His leadership is being challenged

by a group of militant "Young Turks" on the left.

With more

vigorous leadership and the development of middle echelon

cacres the party could develop significantly.

4. Parties of Insignificance. The remaining nine Christian

Democratic parties

- in Argentina, Bolivia, Colombla, Costa Rica,

Ecuador, lexico, Nicaragua, Paraguay and Uruguay … show scant

pro-isa of caveloping into

forces of national importance over the

neit five jears. Leadership of even modest stature exists only

in Asgcatins (Salvador Allende, Horacin Sualdo) and Bolivia

II - PARTY YOUTH WANGS

Co Strenth in Universities Ahead of Party Strength. As

with all political sroups in Latin irerica, the vast majority of

CD party militants are drain fron the ranks of student appendages

activo in the local univeraltics. In most countries of the hémi-

sphere, co voting strengch on the caspus is nuch

more significant

then the political strench of the parent party.

A few champles

In Panana, the Party polled 3.1 percent

of the vote in 1964 (and probably sould poll not more. than 5

percent today, while its University youth got 12.8 percent in the

January 1966

clection. The Dominican PRSC received S.4 percent of

the vote in 1962 (and its prescht strength could will be lower

because of intemal divisions and leadership conflicts), but its

youth wing on the campus garnered 40.2 percent of the vote in

May 1966

In Venezuela, COREI polled 22 percent of the vote in

1553; les student wing on the campus of the Central University,

horover, polled 40.? percent of the vote in 1966.

These comparitive

figures suggest sad conclusions which are prescnted In Paras. 19

and 20 below.

Radicalination of Youth Wings. Several CD leaders, most

notsbly Frei and Caldera, have expressed considerable concern over

the groiing radicalization of party youth wings.

that youth groups

of every political stripa assume positions to the left of their

partics is nothing new, but the situation in several CD groups has

gotten badly out of haud.

In several countries only an opaque line

divides the positions assuned by CD youth groups (or important wings)

fros the stance assured by Marxist youth elements.

"In venezuela,

the wing or the COPEI youth headed by Marta Sosa 18 80 "far-out"

it has camed the sobriquet "the Astronauts." Chilean President

Frei repostcaly told a German Christian Democrat that his youth

wing is in danger of beconing Marxiet.

In Panama, the dominant

wing of the CD youth has assumed positiong at least as radical as

And in the Dominican Republic the Social Christian

group in the National University is allied with the Communist

students.

7.

Youth Tending to Push Parties Further Left. The grcat

concers of responsible party leaders is that youth input to the

parties will swell the ranks of the radical wings and push the

parties further left. Sane observers believe that the CD youth

probiles has been

exasgerated and that the "bot heads" will mellow

once they participate direcily in party life and cope with hard

political rcality.

III - THE TRACT DE CLISC ON TIE CHRISTIAN DEVECRITIC MOVEMENT

9. CLASC Poses Sericus Danger for CD Movemeat. A KUSONE

study points out that "Oryanized labor could contribute substantlally

to. the "development of well-organized CD political parties in the.

hemisphere, but 1t also offers

the best chance for Co extresists

to cause haa to the novesent." Few would argue tast bow the CD

novcrent fares and the imago lt projects depend in sot insignificant

nessure on the posture assused and progress achieved by CliC.

Kore often than not, the judgement of a mass movement is based on

the logst clement comprising it a and in this regard GuSC is

chailcrged only by the party youth and student wings. As an

organized labor forco CLISC has been a dismal faflura (with the

exception of its carpesto ama); its only lupact and sole raison

d'ste un to this tino has beca as a political action listrument

with primary appeal to the working classca. It is unlikely that

CHiASC, under Maspero leadorship, will mellow as do partles when

they schieve the responsibility of government.

10. CLASC Has Maintained Posture of Independence. Despite 13

"Christian" label, CISC has consistently maintained that it 1s not

subservient to the Christian Democratic movement or any nember

The statcent canrot be disputed, for while CLISC 1s guilty

of nost of the seme aberrations as the least responsible of the CD

parties, it Invariably coits its follies independeacly, (often,

in fact, setting en exagple that is caulated by the parties). But

while CLASC can defend its claim of independence, it is also true

that CLISC does not discoursge the belief that 1t is the chosen

labor instrument of the Christian Democratic movement, although

this label has never been corally bestowed.

11. Closer Iles Betwesh CL"SC and CD Moverent Apacar Likely.

It sopcars likely that a core organic participation oi CLISC In CD

altairs is in the offing.. A Schinar was held in Montevideo frou

11 - 23 April (sponsored by the Christian Democratie Formation

Institute -- IFEDIC) for officials of CLASC who are siso officers

of Christian DerocIstic parties.

spocific purpose of arranging closer coordination betazes the CD

political covesent and the Christian labor movement, resulted 1n

the signing of the "Carta da Moatevideo" on 20 April.

president

.: Rafael Caldera, Venezuela

Vice President 8 Hector CORNEJO Chavez, Peru

Vice President : Rene DE LEON Schlotter, Guatemala

Sceratary General: Tomas REYES Vicuna, Chile

ODCA has consistently assumed an anti-Yankee posture on a broad

range of key issucs (cost forcefully on the Ancrican intervention

in the Dosinican Republic). out on balance has been less strident

1n. 1ts criticisn than several of its member partics (notably the

chilcan, Bolivien and Dominican CD's), probably because of

cnldora's rostraining hand. The Organizatioi would merit mucr

closer attention than we have given it to date if it had substantial

Influenee on or authority over member parties, or could apply

sanctiors against national groups.. But ODCA mounts to little

nore than a fratemity. Its member parties have little Idcological

horogencity and the cement of their union appears to be based nore

on revolutionaly mysticism (which most parties are careful to

qualify with adjectives like peaceful, democratic and Christian)

end im regative foctors (hostility to the U.s., capitalism and the

oligarchies), thea on a foundation of CD doctrine or basic agree-.

nent on just

wizst they want.

14. Efforts to Firm Ue the ODCA Role. We have asked contacts

in European CD circles to prod ODCA to set criterla for merbership

and bchavior and that the Europears weigh petitions for support

• fron the Latin Anerican parties and organizatlong azainst these

critcria.

CHRISTIAN REMOCRACY: IN LATIN AMERICA

The decisive victory of Eduardo Frei in the Sep-

tember 1964

Chilein presidential elcition led many to

hope that Christian

Democracy sould develop signifi

cantly throughou: Latin America, compoting with Con-

munism on ideological grounds and offering an alterna-

tive, democratic route to social and economic progress.

No such trend has yet developed.

The Christian

Democratic movement's appeal is to students and middle

class, a relatively small percentage of the population

in most Latin American countries.

•Its concepts of

basic social refora and the dignity of the human person

may appeal to the rorkers, but they

still cast their

vote on a pragmatic basis for the least objectionable

of the established parties that have an immediate chance

of governing:

The movement's progress is likely to be hampered

by its lack of strong

leaders and effective

labor

ganizations to congete against

or-

the entrenched posi

tiong of other political

movements.

Current Balance Sheet

The Christian Democratic

movement is generally agreed to

be of

current political sigrifi

cance in only

four Latin American

countries--Chile, Peru, Venezuela,

and El Salvador.

ing Marxist domination of the

urban labor force; and Frei's

moderation has been increasingly

challenged by the left. wing of

his own party, which may capture

control in the next two or three

years.

In. only one of these--Chile--

is the Christian

Democratic Party

(PDC) the governing party.

Frei's

Solid victory in the 1964

dential election was

presi-

followed by

an even more

impressive showing

in

the March

1965 congressional

election.

However, the party's

reform program

has

run

into dif-

ficulty in the upper house of

Congress, which is

still con-

trolled by the opposition; no

progress has been made in weaken-

The

only other Christian

Democratic party with

a claim

to

a role

in government is the one

in Peru.

It was brought into a

pre-election coalition by the

dominant Popular Action Party

in 1963 and, although it gained

only four percent of the votes,

it holds two cabinet posts.

Its

voting strengh has been weakened

recently by the defection of a

dissident faczion which formed a

separate Popular Christian Party.

Venezuela's Christian Demo-

crats (COPEI) have strong hopes

of duplicating the victory of the

Chilean party in 1968 and appear

to have narrowed the gap. between

their 22 percent of the elector-

ate

in 1963 and the governing

Democratic Action's 32 percent.

COPEI Secretary Géneral Rafael

Caldera, one of the few Latin

American CD leaders of interna-

tional stature, is expected to

be

the

party's standard bearer

in his

fourth try for the presi-

dency.

Ile has recently come out

in favor of a politically expe-

dient move to the right, thus

filling the vacuum of the center-

right of the Venezuelan political

spectrum and opening new sources

of support.

In El Salvador, the PDC

garnered 31.2 percent of the

votes in the March 1966 legisla-

tive election and one of its.

In less than six years

the PDC has become the leading

opposition party.

It has little

chance of capturing the presi-

dency in 1967, but should be a

strong contender by 1972, with

educated Mayor

Duarte the likely candidate.

Applying even the most yen-

erous criteria to the judgment

of potential, there are not more

than four other CD parties--in

the Dominican Republic, Panaina,

Brazil, and Guatemala--that might

develop

as moderately important

forces over the next five years.

The Dominican Revolutionary

Social Christian Party. (PRSC) ,

quer. government clear, but has

alsö indicated that it intends to

operate within bounds acceptable

that this moderate: line will in-

crease its following and enable

it to improve on the poor showing

it made in the 1966 elections.

The party has developed a small

but talented cadre, primarily

from the university ranks.

The Panamanian PDC was reg-

istered some five years ago and

polled only 3.1 percent of the

votes in 1964.

lacked by most Panamanian parties,

which are largely personalistic

or tied to financial interests.

The PDC is currently negotiating

with the mass-based Panamenista

Party of Arnulfo Arias--Panama's

largest--in hopes of forming

coalition for the May 1968 elec-

tions.

The CDs have offered to

provide the Panamenistas with

much-needed administrative skills

in return for a share of the as-

sembly seats in the next election.

A long-range goal would be to

acquire support within Arias'

party and

inherit his mass fol-

lowing when he passes from the

scene.

Youth and student movemen't and

some growth potential among the

campesinos who make up more than

half the population. Current

direction of the party leaves much

to bedesired; its leader, Rene de

Leon,

appears honest, but he has

little organizational flair or

popular appeal.

With more vigo-

rous leadership and the develop-

ment of a middle-echelon cadre,

the party might develop signifi-

cantly--particularly if the

in-

cumbent Revolutionary Party (PR)

administration

fails to resolve

basic problems confronting it.

As with all political groups

in Latin America,

the vast major-

ity of CD party militants. come

from student organizations in the

local universities.

In most

countries of the hemisphere, CD

voting

strength on the campus is

much

greater than the political

gtrength of the

parent party.

A few examples illustrate

this

point:

In Panama, the party

polled 3.1 percent of the national

vote in

1964 (and probably would

poll not more than 5 percent to-

day); but its university youth

got 12.8 percent in the January

1966 campus election and 24.4

percent in January 1967.

The

Dominican PPSC received 5.4 per-

cent of the vote in 1962 land its

present strength could well be

lower because of internal divi-

sions and leadership conflicts),

but its youth wing

on the campus

garnered

40.2 percent of the

vote in May

1966.

In Venezuela,

COPEI polled 22 percent of the

vote in 1963; its student wing on

the campus of Central University,

however, polled 40.2 percent of

the vote in 1966.

The great concern of respon-

that these

Some mellowing

Both German and American

observers have commented that

cadres might arrest this drift

to the

left.

Frei and Caldera

have specifically asked the

training field.

However, the

Germans, who have long been pro-

ponents of organizational programs

have permitted the situation to

to be in the offing..

Last April,

complish this goal, they proposed

that.both.the CD party labor de-

partments and CLASC be granted

formal representation in the

Democratic Organiza-

tIon of America (ODCA) , the re-

gional grouping

formed

in 1949.

The plan has not yet been

implemented, but eventual ODCA

approval appears: likely.

Closer

CLASC identification with the CD

political movement may have an

adverse effect on CD youth

wings, which--being further left

than

their parent parties--have

identified more

closely with

CLASC's revolutionary image.

Since the flyst of the year,

CLASC has intensified. its ef-

forts to create: its own youth

groups and appears to have made

some progress, especially in

Central America.

The Role of ODCA

In its 17 years of existence,

ODCA has not evolved beyond a

sort of fraternity held together

more by negative factors such as

hostility to the US, to capital-

ism, and to the oligarchies, than

by any basle agreement among it's

members on doctrine or principles.

Moreover,

made very clear that they

will fight any. effort--whether

initiated by ODCA or by the Eu-

ropean

financial backers

of the

CD movement:--to

impose standards

and controls that will impinge

on their freedom of action.

In gencral, ODCA takes a

slightly

less hostile line on

Us policies than that of its

member parties.

This probably

results

from the influence of

its president, Rafael Caldera of

Venezuela. • The organization's

two vice presidents are Hector

Cornejo Chavez of Peru and Rene

De

Leon of Guatemala.

Vicuna of Chile is its secretary

general.

Only in Central America has

Union of Central America, was Of-

ganized last July.. It now has

five member parties, in Guatemaia,

El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica,

European Role and Influence

Although Latin American

Christian Democracy like the Eu-

ropean variety, has its roots in

the profoundly

humanistic and

democratic

ideas of the French

philosopher Jacques Maritain, it

does not contain the European

fascist concept of the corporate

state.

The European reaction to

the growth of. Communism in the

1930s had little effect on the

Latin American CDs; consequently

the Americans were moving to the

political left as the Europeans

were moving to the right.

Scurce Comment.

At the tize of his departure, Batista told

the executive.

committee that he was going directly to Caraças,

Venezuela.

It was not until after his return that it was

learned

that he had not gone to Caracas or to Guatemala as

he had planned.

He later explained that while he was in

Puerto Rico he telephoned his relative in Guatemala and was

infored that the latter had "failed in his efforts."

Field Comment.

Presumably he was referring to an interview

with President Julio Cesar Mendez Montenegro which Batista

had earlier said had been arranged by his

cousin::: (Cf.

Estimaào democratacristiano:

Después de locr una copia literal del discurso pronuncia-

do jor Castro, en la escalinata de la Universidad de La Habana, el

pasado 13 de marzo, me considero obliguão con el Gobierno, el Par-

t1ão Demócrata Cristiano y el

mente atacados por Castro durante el transcurso de su alocución, a

22223

expresar mi opinión con relación a dicha ofensa.

Digo obligado, porque el hecho de ser democratacristiano

cubano, integrante de

esa gran comunidad de seres humanos que un

¿ía se dieron a la tarea de realizar una revolución en libertad y

que lamentablemente vicron tronchadas sus aspiraciones al compro-

bar que las mismas eran ahogadas por la sangre vertida en los pa-

redores de fusilamientos por héroas cono Porfirio Ramirez, Presi-

dento de la FeU

de la provincia de Las Villas en Cuba y el Dr.Hum

berto Sori Marín, Comandante del Sjército

Rebelde y autor de la

prinera Ley do Reforma Agraria: debe servirme de experiencia para

expresar lo que pienso decir a través de estas lineas. Digo obli-

jado, porque en igual forma que nosotros hemos pedido en múlti-

ples oportunidades, colaboración y solidaridad

con nuestra lucha,

solicitud que lamentablemente no ha sido

respondida por algunos,

ricgando unas veces desconocimiento y otras imputándonos incom-

prensili con al "proceso revolucionario" que se está llevando a

cabo en Cuba, no queremos que en esta oportunidad en que son los

compañeros chilenos los que necesitan de ruestra solidaridad, va-

lanos a encontrar a alguien que por desconocimiento, no se decida

= respaldar públicamente al Gobierno, Partido y pueblo de Chile

en la actitud cívica y valiente adoptada frente a las ofensas ex-

presadas por Castro durante su discurso, entre las cuales trans-

cribimos las siguientes:

"A decir verdad, siempre he cieido que

Frei es un representante de la burguesía chilena, que su gobier-

no es un gobierno de la burguesía. Jamás he creido que Frei vaya

a hacer ninguna revolución"

.... pusteriormente, al referirse a

los sucesos provocados por los comunistas en la mina de cobre del

Salvaror conde murieron varias personas dijo: "Frei es un reaccio

Frei ha demostrado con este hecho, no ser un individuo de

irme, sinó un individuo cobarde, que abusa del podes.......

Frci la demostrado ser un mentiroso. Frci ha denostrado ser un po-

litigiero vulgar que para justificar su sanguinario gesto, trata

de culpar a la Tri-Continental. Frei se desermascara. Frei demues-

¿te di pueblo de Chile y al mundo qué tipo de revolución es la

que va a hacer, qué tipo de gobierno es el que va a llevar adelan-

ic. Es decii.

no una revolución sin sangre, sinó una política de

sargro sin revolución; sangre sin revolución, esa es la política

de Froi, sangre sin revolución.

ese es el gobierno de Frei, sanyre

sin rivolución, esa es la política de la Alianza para el Progreso".

Después de estas expresiones, no podemos menos que salirlo

al paso a Castro y a la camarilla que desgobierna hoy a Cuba, e

instar y pedir mayor colaboración con los patriotas que hoy ofren-

can sis vidas por liberar a Cuba, a fir de evitar no solo la con-

tinuada masacre de cubanos que se lleva a cabo en la Isla, sino

tambion ponerle fin a todos estos.

incidentes bochornosos para la

historia, en los que

aparece un cubano, ofendiéndo públicamente

ante el mundo a un Presidente, a un Partido y a un pueblo que a

contrario sensus de lo que él

esta haciendo en Cuba, sí está rea-

lizando una revolución en libertad, sí ha defendido en todo momen

to el sano nacionalismo, sí se ha puesto de frente cuantas voces

las circunstancias lo han requerido a los oligarcas y explotado-

IES.

Para terminar, sólo me queda reiterarle, que en nombre de

la solidaridad. que une a todos los demócratacristianos, exprese

públicamente, su deseo de colaborar con la lucha que mantiene el

puebla cubano por derrocar al castrocomunismo y poder realizar en

Cuba, una verdadera revolución en libertad, asf como

a la ¿ctitud asumida por el Gobierno,

el Partido Demócrata Cris-

tiano y el pueblo chilero en los actuales momentos.

Pendiente de su atención y respuesta y dejando constancia

de mi mayor consideración, quedo suyo

cordialmente.

Miami, Marzo 17 de 1966

Estimaso compañero:

La JDC de Cuba,

fiel al pensamiento de nuestro Apostol

José Vastí que dice: "ver en silencio un rrimen es cometerlo", no

ha guirido marginarse del daño que Castro quiere hacerle a la

Revolución en Libertad, que está realizando el Presidente Eduar-

ão Frei, su Gobierno y el Partido Demócrata Cristiano de Chile.

consciente de que es posible que no te hayan llagado

nuchas

de las informaciones relacionadas con los innobles ata-

ques públicos de Castro a Frei y su Gobierno, Calificándo al Pre

siderie de "representante de la burguesía chilena"

• "reaccionario".

"mimaio dei imperialismo yanqui ! guardián de sus intereses en

Chile'.....etc. Hemos querido carunicarte, no sólo los ataques de

Castro a Frei, sino una de las muchas respuestas que se le han

dado : castro. Nos referimos a la que en dias pasados hiciera el

Diout-so Damócrata-Cristiano Chileno, Alfredo Lorca y que a cor-

tinuación transcribimos "Realmente, Fidel Castro es un caso dig-

-o de milisis. Hace pocos dias atrás, segun expresaron diputa-

¿os qie estuvieron en Cubá, Castro dijo que Frei era un gran Pre-

sidente. agregó que si el hubiera

estado en Chile, habría hecho

lo misto que Frei.

Pero ahora, porque se le ha tocado la epidermis de la

Tri-Continental, Frei se transforma en un Castro Cualquiera.

jo estuve en cuba -añadio Lorca- en 1959 cuando Castro

sabió al poder. En esa ocasión le pregunté al ver a tantos hom

ares armados, si pensaba reorganizar al ejército. Y él me contes-

tó, con eso modo tan tropical, "chico, armas para qué cuando se .

tiene aà pueblo".

s¿. embargo, -añadió. Loca- en los siete años que fidel

=1 pueblo detrás de él, arda mas armado que un militar en

guerra. En Chile, todos los Presidentes que yo recuerdo, los

radicales,

el Sr. Ibarez, el Se. Alessandri, el propio Se. Froi.

han recorrido todo el pais sin gendarme, ni pistoleros a suoldo

que utiliza Castro.

so se puede docir que Frei sea un cobarde, un mentiroso

y un élagota como Fidel Castro afirma - ajudio Lorca-. En cambio

El csin rciguardado por metralletas y no puede dormir, ni se lo

coroce comicilio dijo porquo los hijos de los muertos en el pare-

dós le tuscan. Además -puntualizó Lorca- vale la pena

destacar que

radie se ha ido de Chile. En cambio, es público y notorio que más

de 300 500 personas han huido del paraiso fidelista. Y me atrevo

a pena:= que si Fisel Castro diera libertad a quienes quieren ir-

se de Cisa,

se quedarla solo con sus barbas y su hermano Raúl,

porcile camilo Cienjuegos ya no está. Dicon que se cayó de un avión.

Finalmente, Lorca recordo el caso del que fuera Presiden-

te de ica tribunales populares de Cuba, Sorf Marfn."Es un hombre

•Iritega:,, puro y extremadamerte justo", decía Castro de él. "Estoy

segure tie nunca condenaría a guien no mereciera la pena de muer-

los Escados Unidos. Resultado: hizo fusilar a ese hombre puro,

Integro s justo.".

Estas palabras, expuestas por el Diputado D.C. Alfredo

Lorca, señalando algunas de las muchas contradicciones de Castro:

ratifican una vez más lo que la JDC de Cuba a través de sus di-

rigortuz, le ha venido diciendo a toda la juventud demócritacris-

tiara se trérica y que hoy, con más fuerza y moral que núnca nos

permite pedirte en rombre de la solidaridad que nos unc, que ex-

porgas pisticamente

tu respaldo a la Revolución en Libertad que

viene ¿calizando el Pueblo, Gobierno y Partido Demócrata Cristia

no de Chile así como tu colaboración a la lucha que mantiene el

por derrocar al castrocomunismo existente en nues-

tra Patria.

Consciente de que nuestra solicitud será escuchada por

tÍ, Y sejuros de que nos darás a conocer la atención que has de

presta-le, quedo a tu entera disposición
