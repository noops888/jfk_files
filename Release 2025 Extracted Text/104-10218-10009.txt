SUBJECT
: Operational Survey in Spain by Edward G. TICHBORN (P)
1. After considerable coordination, agreement was finally
secured from EUR Division and COS/Madrid for Edward G. Tichborn (P)
to undertake an operational survey in Spain. Chief and Deputy Chiefli
EUR/IB plus the undersigned had a preliminary meeting with Tichborn"
on 20 June 1967. Background reading was provided him preparatory to
a detailed briefing. The latter was effected by DC/IB and the under-
signed on 21 June 1967.
2. Tichborn's mission is to identify operational targets,
primarily in the business community but not excluding those in
the military establishment, the Government, and the church, in-
cluding Opus Dei. Identification is desired of elements, particu-
larly in the business community, which have political influence now
4.
and which could be more important after Franco's death. After iden-
li
tifying such elements, Tichborn is to seek ways and means of access
to them. He will, of course, pay particular attention to the local
Spanish partners of ICAP Iberia in terms of their political activities
and their contacts with key officials. He will assess ICAP Iberia as
a cover mechanism, and in the event of a favorable assessment, explain
in detail how it could be exploited. He will assess one of ICAP Iberia's
local partners whose aunt was a famous RIS agent.

3. Tichborn is leaving New York on 24 June 1967 and will arrive!
in Madrid on the morning of 25 June 1967. He has been given the tele-
phone number and address of DCCS/Madrid, Fr. Osborne Day, who will be
his contact. Tichborn, upon arrival, will telephone Mr. Day. The
latter has been alerted by WOFACT cable of Tichborn's arrival. WUBRIRY/1
will meet Tichborn in Madrid on 28 Jure and make appropriate introductions.
4. It is anticipated that Tichborn will spend about a month in
Madrid or as long as it is commercially plausible and operationally
necessary to fulfill his mission. Necessary commercial groundwork

has been laid. Tichborn recently met one of the Spanish partners
in New York who was on a short visit to the U. S. They agreed that
when Tichborn visited Spain, they would jointly work on a prospectus
that could be used to increase business for ICAP Iberia.
5. It is estimated that Tichborn's trip will cost about
$2,500.00. Approval is requested to obligate $2,500.00 of FY 67 00A or
D&TO funds for this purpose.

3. Currem Cojectives. To support Contract Agent Edwara G.
TICLEORN (2) who is used as a covert action advisor and poltical action
agem by WIID. In addition TICHLORN is available for election campaign
research, special political surveys on selected countries and ched
research requirements which can utilize his poklical expertise and area
knowledge.
4. Back rozd. In 1959 TICKBORN, a bilingual Harvard-trashed
lawyer win polical experience, was hired as a poliucal actio.. ddvisor
for Agency-sponsored election operations througnout Latin America.
Не паз paricipated in political operations in Cuir., El Salvador, Guatemala,
Chile, Argemina and the Dominican Republic, based in Mexico City
from luôl umil 1953, he was primarily a Headquarters asset bat diso
assisted the Memco City Station in its CA program. In August 1966 ne
was assigned PCs to New York City where he has been employed for
cover purposes since October 1900 by the DO proprietary WUSALINE.
5. Effectiveness. During the period 1 October 1966 30 June 1967,
WED has had an opportunity to use TICHEORN in his primary rois of
political action advisor on only one occasion. In February TICHEORN
was sent to Puerto Rico to conduct a poltical action briefing of a
Station: Santo Domingo asset, AMANTEHEM-4, which task he perio.med
effectively. In order to maximize the benefits of his availability, he
was assigned the continuing task of monitoring the Dominican Republic
press and analyzing media reactions towards Balaguer and opposition
elements. Severai detailed summaries were submitted to the Doplinican
desk. A major effort was made ic develop an in-depth study of the PRI
party in Mexico. After a number of meetings with Headquarters and
arose m

Amico Chy Station officers and carly enthusiasm on the part of
TICTHBORN'S PRI contacts, those contacts became reluctant to delve
iMo Setitive PRI areas or to introduce TICHBORN to other contacts
with inside access. In May Headquarters, the Station, and TICHZORN
all agreed, that the effort should be dropped.
0 Cover and Security..
a. Cover. TICHSORN has done an excellent job of building
Lis cover wirA WUGALINE, iiis area knowledge and language
aidly have proven of real help to the cover company, and ice
h.s shown himself unusually well suited to the needs of inat
company. The cover company demands on his time, both on-the-
job and for foreign and domestic travel, have not interiored with
his operational uulization.
t

1
b. Security. While in Mexico, TICHEORN acted as an
unofficial legal závisor for the Center of Studies and Documnemation
which was momioned in the MFDOWEL fiap as being funded by a
CIA condit. however, there was no publicity in Mexico wrien
Lnked on win the Comer. Similarly there was apparently no
public exposure of the funding of the intellectual magazine with
which is was connected, "Dialogos", by other CIA conduits. There.
is no available cridence that his security has been compromised
by the MilDOWEL Rap.
7. Termination and Extension.
Ai
a. While TICHBORN has been available for assignments calling
for his airlities as a political action advisor, the Division has not
had the requirements for such activities wiich were anticipated.
The cominuing use of TICHBORN for CIA tasks of lesser priority,
together with the time and travel demands of his new cover business,
Lave kept hira weil occupied during the period. However, in view
of the icure anticipated lack of demand for TICHEORN's services
on a frequent basis, and the comparatively high cost in administra-
tive, financial, and WH case officer time required, it is felt that
the project should be terminated, effective 30 September 1967.
b. As indicated in the section above on "Cover and Security'
TICHEORN has proven himse to be of real value to his cover
company WUSALINE and to DO. Because of their interest in using

effective 1 July 1967. Full financial responsibility for TICHBORN'S
salary and expenses will be transferred to DO on 1 October 1967.

and exper.cnce, WHD would enjoy a primacy of interest in his possible
future operational use. WIRD agreed to reimburse DO for me costs of
salary and expenses for any sucin future use of TICHLORN.

The Station appreciates the press analysis contained in the

that TICHEORN's comments on the press image of EMANTHEM/1
are particularly useful. As Headquarters is aware, however,
ΕΜΑΝΤΕΚΗ/1 bas not shown himself particularly willing to
take strides to improve his press image and continues to
manifest a rather callous disregard for principles of public
relations in general. While thus of no real immediate use,
a continuing TICHBORN analysis would prove valuable should
the opportunity present itself to render EMANTHEM/1 public
relations advice and aid. We also believe such an analysis
would be worthwhile in that it would keep TICHBORN himself ||
up to date on the Dominican situation. Should it be decided
to offer EMANTHEM/1 direct public relations or political
advice, TICHBORN, in view of his established rapport with
this individual, would be a natural candidate for the job.
We would therefore appreciate further TICHEORN analysis,
if practicable and convenient.
