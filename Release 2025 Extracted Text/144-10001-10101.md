--

Reference repercussions in the Soviet Union to the assassination

of President KENNEDY.

Basing the first on personal judgment and the others on reports

from reliable diplomatic sources, I will give the following evalua-

• tions:

The deep grief produced here by the assassination was

absolutely spontaneous and can be explained by the high culture of

the Soviet people, which enables them to rise above world events,

and by traditional Russian sentimentality.

The moment the news was received, because of the possibility of

international complications the military authorities increased their

security measures.

These have now returned to normal.

High-ranking Soviet officials are concerned over what interna-.

tional policy the new President will pursue, especially with respect

to cuba, and, although it seems that MIKOYAN's feelings, after

speaking with the President and other high-ranking United States

officials, were moderately calm, Soviet leaders are waiting to learn

how the matter of the purchase of wheat in the United States will be

resolved and also for the conclusion of a new Soviet-United States

cultural agreement, in order to obtain a more clear idea of the above-

mentioned policy.

((A)) Reissue based on better text.
