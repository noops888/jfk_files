1.

The following AMOT report concerning the not-so-private

affairs of AMBIDDy/l and his fiancee

may be of interest to

BECKHOFF. According to AMYUM/19, AMBIDDY/1 intends to formalize

his relationship with Iden B sometime within the next few months.

The marriage wiil probably take place in Latin America and Iden

B will make her home there to avoid a public scandal which would

have a harmful effect on the AMYUM organization.

Attention 1s

called to paragraphs l4, 1l, and 26 which answer, in part, some of

the questions raised in ref dispatch concerning ÓDYOKE Involvement

10 AMWORLD.

The Station has forwarded reports of this nature

which concern clains by members of the Cuban exile community of

KUBARK sponsorship of AMBIDDY/l. Of the specifics cited by the

cuban, Intelligent or otharwise, to support their allegations

those statements attribused to

the AMHORLD principals thimgelves

appear to be the only ones which can make a claim to "knowledge"

as opposed to conviction based on AMYoRlD's affluence.

no tangible evidence of KUBARK Involvement with AMNORLD has come

to our attention.

Source: Iden A.

source states that she has known AMBIDDY/l since they

were children in Ismeralda municipal term, Camaguey province, from

where both of then come originally.

Ao - Iveryone knows when mars begin, but never when they end.

I would like to sey that 1t will de soon, but sy duty as

a leader is to prepare the people of Cuba and the Cubans 1s exile

sor the kind of war we expect: a long, hard war, but one that

Do - Today you talk of bringing about uprisings in the forces

of the castro rosino, and you seen to trust In this as the best

tray to liberate the island Iron Soviet and Comunist domination.

Why didn't you take that position three years ago, since it was

just as valid then as now?

A. - Three years ago we took the sane position as today, Just

remember that the Mi.R.R. pas the first revolutionary organiza-

thon to Ilse up against the tyrant castro to try to overthrow

bin by Intornal aotion at a time when many were convinted that

fidel was a communist but said "that 1t was not yet time to say

Remember that the first weapons for Internal rebellion

Hore carried to cuba by the M.R.R..

¡enenber that before the miyaùe rangs tere set un

this Internal rebell1on.

lo - Somo International circlos claim that russia is abandon-

Ing Castro, that it has egroed on this abandonent secretly

with North Areriod, and that this 1s visibly evident in the

gradual withdrawel of Soviet troops from the island. They add

that confidenoo in this agreement has caused North Ajerica to

/ "toleraten this sreah outbreak of arnod aotivities in the Car-

1bbean. Do you share this tier?

A. - Franiely I do not bellere in international pacts that are

not olear to me, and I bellete much less in the willingness of

Russia to cary out its agrechents: Poland, Chechoslovakia

and Hungary are historioal witnesses of Russian treachery.

As foIntolerating our aotivities", I cannot speals,

because we have not askod for "tolerance" for them. It never

This is not the first tire me say publicly that this

war of Ilberation of our onslarod Cuba must bo carried en

"no matter thon it pleases, no natter thon it displeases",

81noe it 18 true that powerful nations have international

obligations to carry out and 1t 1s also true that we Cubans

I-ve our inescapable duties to our enslaved country.

Do - II arned action within Cuba - guerrilla war in the

mountains and war of terror in the cities - should, as ex-

perted produce a wave of popular uprisings both among students

and workers and in the nilitary units of the dictatorship,

do you think that the democratio rations of the hemisphere

would cone to our help?

Aren't you afraid of a repetition

of what happened in Budapest?

A. - although I am continced that at some definite moment

they would come to our help, we cannot base our war on c0l-

lootite assistance. We must plan our strategy as a purely

¡Cuban struggle from berinning to end.

Many latin Amerioon nations have already helped us

the situation on the island and treat mith castro es if they

believed that all hope of llceration had sapired. Can you tell

us sonething avout the internal strugile azainst communisa?

i'Ao - To think that all hope of liberation has expired in Cuba

1s to shom a complete lack of knotledzo of the condition and

oharaoter of the Cuban people. The history of Cuba 13 8 h18-

tory of repeated martyrdon in search of real liberty.

I can BAy TAIy little about the Internal strugsto that

does not affoot its security. But let 1t be suffioient to say

that today there are guerrillas in five of the sis provinces

of Cuba; that the tyrant knows about then and that he has not

boen able to wipe them out because of the peasants support

sor then; that in the oitios the sentiment of the workers has

begun to be mobili?ed toward passive resistance, and that

within the very ranks of the militia Cuban patriots are form-

1ng Independent ce118.

Da - Fron the rays of the Bay. of pigs you seened to trust blind-

IT In North Amerloan material backing for your struggle. But

lately we see you shifting your interest toward Latin Anerican

countries. Why?

Ao - Aotually my first glance was toward Latin Amerloa. I took

residence In Merloo where I published my book Iralolón (roach-

asy) and I tratalod around Latin Ameriod Garrying the shout of

alarm against communion. riterward I went to North Aneries 1x

constant search of resouroes for the war, and although I havo

## Page 73

14-00000

never had blind confidence in anytilng human, because everything

that 1s dose blindly 18 done badly, 1t 1s true that I had con-

Ildence. in liorth Anerican naterial help. Reason: because wo

wore seeing it. II do not think it was a secret to anyone miere

the weapons. we used in the invasion came from.) I had no sory-

ples in accepting Anerican reapons to offset those from jussia

which Fidol Castro vas reCeiving 11 gigantic shipments.

After leaving prison I lost conildence in that assistance

because since then not only have I seen none, but also I have

not seen the posslbility even of getting any.

not only has uy Interest switoked toward Iatin Anerioa,

but also my gratitude toward these people who have opened their

arms to offer us help when all doors were being closed against

us. Thanks to them we oan continue the struggle.

So - what opinion do you think the conduct of natlons 11ke Eng-

Lend and Franoe deserve, who, turning their baoke on prinoiples

thoy olain to hold and on moral and humane considerations, take

part in propping up castro's bloody reflue by supplying him

with aredits and all kinds of Iinanoial baoking?

No - Jirat I do tot want to confuse countries with lovernments.

Most peoplan are innocent of the atrooities and treacherioa. of

thelr governments.

That kind of boharlor never surprisod me in the oase of

In the case of the french soverment I las sorrowful be-

causo of the figure of Ges. DeGaulle. is a young Cuban I used

to hold in sy heart the image of DoGaulle, hero of the second

Horld War, loader of his country's resistance in the fight

against the foreise invader.

It: was hard for ne to realize that this sane man would

turn his baok on the prinoiples which made him beloved by the

free world. It 18 unfortunate that such a brilliant caroor

, should have been darkened at its ending.

In any care, sone day Cuba Will be free and those goveru

sonts oan be sure that, If they do not alter their conduct, they

will then receive their payment in the same historical currenoy

that they have passed out to our nartyred people.

Q. - You and your party have been acoused of being fasolsts, of

being a bee-hive for the Central Intelligence Agenoy and a

"OOTeIn for the worst polltioal and economto interests of our

country. What do you have to say about that?

MENORANDUM FOR THB RECORD

SUBJECT:

Tolephone Conversation with AKBIDDY-1, 9 April 1964,

1315 hours

The following was relayed to AMBIDDY-l: "He are

glad you have second thoughts

about Playa Giron. We have

received nore information about nilitary, erpecially maritime,

build-up in that sector which would make any landing attempt

virtually sulcidal."

AMBIDDY -1 stated he would confer with

AMJAVA:& and AMYUM-19 and give us his final decision as to

whether or not this operation would be run... AMBIDDY-1 commented

that one life meant nore to him than the entire operation.

ever; A-l Rgain reminded this office of the impact an attack

on Playa Giron on the 17th of April would have on the morale

of the Cuban people.

The undersigned replied that there are

two sides to the coin; should their operation fall, this would

play into the hands of Castro, and it was the opinion of this

office thet the alternate plan would also do nuch to false the

moralo of the Cuban people. .

?: In conclusion it was reaffirmed to A-1 that the

final desision is his.

He replied that after his meeting

with AMJAVA-A and AHYUM-19 he will let us know the Linal

decision.

The following is a résuné of the political

philosophy of Manuel

Headguarters Comment Artime Buesa, leader of the Movimlento de

Recuperacion Rovolucionaria (MRR, Movement for Revolutionary

Recovory) as prepared by Source.

It is based on statements

nade by Artime in his speech on 18 March 1961 to the Associación

para Recuperación Económica de Cuba (AREC, Association for

Economic Recovery of Cuba), on his first publication entitled

Traición (Betrayal).

Artime does not believe in political extrenes - neither the

left nor the right.

He believes that extremes always end by

touching one another.

If any extreme gains power in Cuba,

and in the case of the extreme right by imposing a dictatorship,

ho will continue to fight with weapons in hand.

Artime does

not belleve in the classification of men by race, by political

ranke in former governments,

Be confesses to being

taking naximum advantage

of each opportunity, but not in the sense of changing his

bollefs in acnord with opportunities.

Comnunist and Eradtor, Artise sentioned dial he resigged

because Castro had not been bones sith tbe

businesses by

dat tell:ag then their property rould be contiscased.

3:

The following excerpis from Artine's book Iraicion clearly

outline Artine's ideology:

a..

"He belleve the state should fonent and stinulate private

economy, both national and foreign.

We have

to have an

effective denocracy in Latin America because the word.

denocracy in that area has been prostitured too often.

Many countries call thenselves denocratic but in reality

are sothing but militarist and demagogic, and many siliply

go through the motions of elections.

Many are siaply

totalitarian governments which are living off the blood

and toll of the people.

The corrupt politicians, the

strong men, the. totalitarians have been the errongest

1111e8 of Communism.

Our. fight is not against one nan,

1t 1s not a war of personal hatred--it is a war against

the doctrine of

hatred, be it called Castro or what have

you--1t 18 a war against a doctrine; le are as much opposed

to Khrushchev as we are against Tito.

lie are as much opposed

to the totalitarian left as ve are opposed to the fascist right"

b.

"He don't care if they call us extremist.

They will con-

tinue to call us rightist or leftist,

fascist, philocon-

munist. I recall the words of Don Quixote when he was

passing on the outskirts of a snall town and Sancho said

to Don Quixoto, 'Sir, the dogs are barking at us,' Don

Quixote roplled, 'Let then,. Sancho, if they are barking

it Is because we are moving. And we will continue to move.'"

"They say we are very ambitious.

Our ambition is that in

the coming days when Cuba is liberated people will pro-

-nounce our name with respect in our country."

d.

"Our men in Cuba are not only fighting for the independence

of our country but also for the independence of the American

hemisphere,

for the survival of Christian principles in

AmeriCa,

for the Western world."

Artime maintains that.

the situation today is much the way lenin would have hoped

fox. BritAin and France have recognized Red China; the

U.s. la at odds with these two governments--this is exactly

what Lenin would have wanted:

Artime has supported his

statements, by quoting Lenin,

"Within 30 years we will en-

bark on a peace oitensive,

of coexistence,

and we.will

splft the free nations and snash the inpotent bourgeois."

"The battle-ground jor latin America lies 30 niles fron

our shoros.

Should the Western world lose this battle,

the slooping glant (Latin America) will wake up on the

sido of the communiat camp.

Then it would be preferable

to be dond because the free world will hare coased to be."

"No aro all guilty for having turnod ayer. Cuba to the handa

of men who could not govern her proporly.: He have krocked

on doors and will continue to do so becauso our causa 18::

honorabla...

Wo cannot afford to wait for miraclod.....Hs

quet prepare for a long light and not expact tho sid of

CHICH REQUIRED. ALFERENCES

ACTION REQUIRED: None; for your information and piles.:.

INTRODUCTION: In the period 6 to 18 January 1964,

AMBIDDY-I was given 83 hours of tutorial training, in JMNAVE safe-

hause facilities,

on existing operational doctrine and management

techniques applicablo to & major clandestine effort against. PBRUMBN.

A copy of the training schedule which was used in this tutorial

training is attached. At the completion of the training course,

the various training instructors submitted an evaluation on

AMBIDDY-1.

These evaluationg are outlined in the following

paragraph.

2. EVALUATIONS: The below-listed evaluations were prepared

by the instructors who participated primarily in Phase I öf

AMBIDDY-l's tutorial training.

The Phase I instruction concentrated

on: lnparting. to AMbIDDY-1 current, operational doctrino relative to

unconventional warfare techniques.

The evaluations are ag follows:

mall Unit Operations and training:

AMBIDDY-1

responded most. enthusiastically to all aspects of the training on

amall. unit techniques.

He nade detafled notes on the mterial

covered, and these notes included copies of truining charts and

diagrams.

A&BIDDI-1 displayed particularly Intensive interest in

that portion of the training dealing with the principlos of

survival and the issuance of individual equipment.

In the course

rof the training, AMBIDDY-1 was given several practical tactical

problems to solve.

AMBIDDY-l's solutions to these problens were

logical and reflected a grasp of the techniques to which he had

been exposed during the tratning sessions.

Thomas L. DARGUZIS WaS

organization of a basic net, consunications and reporting techniques.

In the course of this trainino,

AMBIDDY -l expressed a particular

interest in the subjects of security, cover and compartmentation.

Charles F. HASENGILL vas the pricary.

instructor for this bloc ol

tra-ning, and he reports that ALEIdDy-l vas a keen student sho

appreciated the opportunity to tearn as such as possible about

clandestine operations.

MASENGILL believes that AMBIDDY-1 at tba

completion of his training vas probably weakest on the topic of

how to report intelligence information.

ReBIStAnCe ACtIVIty and Guerrilla Varfare: AMBIDDY-

received tralning on the principles and concepts inherent in

organizing an infiltration tess.

relative to the principles of organizing a resistance net.

Additionally, he was trained in caching, demolition and sabotage

techniques.

AMBIDDY-I also received instruction in the principles

and concepts of guerrilla warfare. AMBIDDY-1 was also given an

opportunity to familiarize hinself, through actual range firing,

with those weapons which are normally used by anti-althud-l forces.

Alton I. PIRNACK was the principal instructor for this bloc of

training.

PIRNACK reports thet AMBIDDY-l was responsive to the

subject material which was presented to him.

AMBIDDY-1 did not

hesitate to ask questions. nor to seek clarification of points. which

he did not clearly understand. AMBIDDY-l did indicate that he was

& neophyte in the subject of PM operations, and, as a result, he

was mat appreciative of the training which he was receiving on

these subjects.

It was evident during this bloc of training that

caching was an entirely new facet of clandestine operations for

AHBIDDY-1.

3. • COMMENT:

• Phase II of. AMBIDDY-l's training concentrated

on exposing AlBIDDY-1 to those management techniques and principles

which are applicablo to a major clandestine operation against a

target like PBRUMEN.

This part of the training was carried out

exclusively by Andrew K. REUTEMAN and Stanley R. ZaMKA.

In this

phase of the training, AMBIDDY-l constantly expressed a great deal

of enthusiasm for the

subject material which was being presented.

Throughout the training, AMBIDDY-l gave every indication that he

wis absorbing the maju. portion of the training.

At the same

time, It was clear that he was overwhelmed by the material and the

Implications of what this training meant in terms of his conduct in

future operations.

After the

management phase of AMBIDDY-l's

"training was completed, REUTEMAN and ZAMKA reviewed the 83 hours

training program in its totallty with AMBIDDY-1.'' In additiOn,

the

progran was reviewed with all of the instructors who participated

In the training.

As a result of this revlew, a consenaus was

"reached that, while AMBIDDY-l 'ls an Intelligent ard responsive

student, the training which he received does not quality him for

the position of sentor officer in a major clardestine undertaking

against PBRUMEN.

The training did, however, alert AMBIDDY-I to a

number of problems and pitfalls which he should avoid in his.

Cuba, in the case of the extreme right by imposing a dictatorship;

In both cases we shall continue to fight with our weapons in hand.

race, political levels in the government to which they formerly

belonged nor by money... I know whites who souls are black and I

know blacks who souls are white. I know wealthy men who are:

spliltually poor and poor who are spiritually wealthy. I only

AMBIDDY-l goes on to mention his vardous publications. He

describes Dis 11568 publicatios, "Concuniss por que?" (Communian

'Lator on, after Castro mas in porar, d-l urote his lettor of

resignation accusing Castro of being a communist and traitor.

In this letter A-l nentions he resigned because Castro had not been

honest with the businessmen by not telling them their property

would be confiscated.

A-l then went into exile and there he published a book called

TRicoloR (Betrayal). Tids book clearly outlined the Identogry of

the movement.

credentials.

"Guerrillas in the nountains; some resistance groupe in the

1. Martin began the conversation by welcoming A-l home.

2.

Martin stated that he had a message from Henry which

would have been sent out today had A-l still been In Costa RICa.

There were a few questions that Henry would 11ke answered:

2.

Since the Consefo had no previous indications.of

Calderonista attempts to overthrow the government,

Al began by saying that vico. starke hau had meetings with

Francisco Calderon.

Calderon's brother, kalael, had been

very friendly with Vico Starke's brother as of u-te. v100:

Starke's brother had been at GUILLOT avar since the first

arrival of the AMWORLD contingent:

Rafael Calderon had a

meeting in GUILLOT with Vico Starke's brother of an unknowi

nature.

Al considars the calderonistas the main opposition

to the government...

Other substantiating reports had roached

Figuls, the head of security for the Costa Rican Government.

Vico Starke had placed old Calderonista elements in key

positions within the MCRL. A-1 gave Col. Figula as bla

source of information.

Vico Starke had wanted to place these

old Calderonista elements within the AMWORLD organization

in a supervisory capacity and they also would have the

final say within AltORLD.

That did A-l mean by other reports reaching Cornello

to establish a

contraband business mainly dealing li whisky.

Starke also

visited A-l and tinidly told A-l that he vas in linancial

straits and the reason why he had ranted to move ucil people

into key positions vas to use the MR vebicles as a cover

nechanisn for contraband.

Vico Starke told A-1 that le

could obtain. the approval of the government to engage in this

type of business.: It appears to A-l that Vico Starke did

present the contraband pro position to Cornelio Orlich and

received tacit approval. A-l informed both. Cornelio and

Vico that since it ras their country they could do as they

pleased, however, he

would not peruit his vehicles to be used

for this purpose.

His main concern was to. liberate Cuba. and

not to engage in the internal affairs of Costa Rica. His

only desire 1s to be left alone so he can work effectively.

"What is Figures' role in this? A-l replied that

he had not seen

any indications that Figueres had been

they are political enemies.
