MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

The telephone surveillance on the national head-

quarters of the Black Panther Partylwhich was authorized on

February 4, 1969, has proved to be most valuable. It has

provided information concerning the planned establishment of

Black Panther Party branches at Eugene, Oregon; Fresno,

California; the Watts area of Los Angeles, California;

Syracuse, New York; Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; and Columbus,

Ohio! It provided information concerning the removal of

Joudan Ford from his leadership position in the New York City

branch and, most recently, has furnished details concerning

the travel

of National Chairman Bobby George Seale to the

Scandinavian countries where Seale is at the present time.

Live informants are furnishing information indicat-

ing that the organization will increasingly use underground

methods of operation which further emphasizes the desirability

of obtaining additional coverage to supplement data being

furnished by our live informants.

It is requested that authority be granted for

telephone surveillances on the Black Panther Party headquarters

at 4115 South Central Avenue, Los Angeles, and on the Black

Panther Party office at 2026 7th Avenue, New York City or on

any other places to which they may move.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

RE:

NEW YORK DIVISION

You have previously authorized this Bureau to

initiate and continue a telephone surveillance on the

office of the extremist Black Panther Party (BPP) in

New York City Located at 2026 Seventh Avenue?

This

installation continues to provide significant data on

this group's plans and operations, and it is apparent

the BPP in New York City is second only to the national

headquarters in Berkeley, California! from the standpoint

of generating plans for racial violence.

This Bureau has developed information that the

BPP in New York recently opened an office at 1370 Boston

Road, Bronx, New York! This office is known as the Black

Community Information Center and reportedly is to function

as the East Coast Information Center for the BPP? It is,

therefore, apparent that a telephone surveillance at this

location will provide access to invaluable data regarding

the BPP's plans and activities, not only on a local level

in New York City, but on a national scale as well.

It is, therefore, requested that authority be

granted for a telephone surveillance at the above location.

The telephone, concerning which coverage is requested, is

listed in the name of Ronald Morris, a known BPP member

in the New York area.

In view of the violence-prone nature of the BPP,

will be strictly complied with in such instances.

If you approve, a telephone surveillance will

be placed on the above BPP office at 1370 Boston Road,

will be continued for an indefinite period. There will

be no trespass involved in connection with the installation

INTERNAL SECURITY - YOUNG LORDS

Investigation by this Bureau has revealed that

the Xoung Lords has its principal offices in Chicago and

New

York and is attempting to establish a nationwide organi-

zation based on Marxist-Leninist principles enunciated by

Communist China and Cuba. The Young Lords has received

political education from and has embraced the basic program

of the Black Panther Party.

It has accepted aid and direction

from revolutionary Puerto

Rican groups seeking independence

for Puerto Rico.

Its publication, "YLO," is replete with

calls for revolutionary action.

The

New York Young Lords in December, 1969, seized

a neighborhood church and held it for ten days

before being

evicted by police action. On March 5, 1970, an officer

of the Young Lords in New York stated before a college audience,

"From now on when the fascist pigs point guns at us, we will

retaliate." The same speaker continued that he and

his

brothers in the Young Lords would no longer remain calm but

• would be violent "from this day on."

Your authorization is requested to institute

telephone surveillance coverage on the New York headquarters

of the Young Lords located at 1678 Madison Avenue, New York,

New York,, for a period of three months. This installation

will be made away from the premises and will not involve

trespass.

It is expected that the requested

telephone

surveillance coverage will provide valuable intelligence

information vital to the internal security concerning the

Young Lords" efforts to establish a national organization,

Its connections with the Black Panther Party and Puerto Rican

independence groups, as well as provide intelligence regarding

you approved continuation of telephone surveillance at the

headquarters of the lYLP in New York]for a three-month period,

effective June 30, 1970.

regarding the organizational and the financial structure of the

YLP and also furnished information regarding the identities of at

least 15 new YLP members.

The YLP continues to advocate revolution and violence,

and recently applauded the actions of those Puerto Rican revolu-

tionaries who attempted to assassinate President Truman in 1950

surveillance at the National Office of the Young Lords Party (YLP),

1678 Madison Avenue, New York City, for a period of three

Construction in the vicinity of the YLP National Officel

prevented installation of the telephone surveillance due to an

unforeseen effect upon telephone company facilities necessary

MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

RE: REQUEST FOR NATIONAL SECURITY

ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE

I hereby request, that you, on behalf of the

President of the United states, authorize a telephone surveil-

lance on the National Office of the Young Lords Party (YLP)

at 202 East 1l7th Street, New York City.

The YIP is a militant Puerto Rican youth group patterned

after the Black Panther Party.

In addition to several branches

in New York City, there

are YLP branches in Bridgeport,

Connecticut; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Puerto Rico.

According to its 13-Point Program and Platform, the

YLP is a revolutionary political party fighting for the

liberation of all oppressed people, seeks self-determination

for Puerto Ricans' liberation, and

believes armed self-defense

and armed struggle are the only means to liberation.

It cites

the Castro revolution in Cuba as an example of the right of the

people to destroy a government which oppresses them and of the

importance for all true revolutionaries to have definite plans.

Major confrontations with police authorities occurred

in New York City during 1969 and 1970 when armed YLP members

and sympathizers forcibly occupied a Harlem church for an

extended period.

During the current month agitational activity

of YLP members

and sympathizers precipitated serious civil

disturbances in New York City and Bridgeport, Connecticut.

One YLP leader, Rafael Viera, reportedly is an associate of

various suspects in the Capitol bombing investigation.

days prior to these mirders two other New York City police

officers were wounded by black assailants and a letter to The

New York Times said that the shooting

was for revolutionary

justice for black people against "fascist pigs." Weapons of

the same caliber were used in both shooting incidents which

may have been related. In this crime, with the type of motive

effect a solution to the murders of the police officers

by unknown black assailants as well as information of

intelligence value regarding black extremist activities.

It is also anticipated that results of this telephone

surveillance may be introduced in court or that leads

to evidence may be obtained; therefore, this request

is being made not only for the purpose of obtaining

intelligence information but also on the basis that

evidence may be obtained that will be used in court.

In line with instructions on page five of your

referenced letter, the following information is set

forth:

On May 21, 1971, two New York City police

officers were shot from behind and killed by two

unknown black male assailants while returning to

their car after responding to a legitimate call in

the Harlem section of New York City. Iwo days prior

to these murders two other New York City police

officers were wounded by black assailants and a

letter to The New York Times said that the shooting

was for revolutionary. justice for black people

against "fascist pigs."

Weapons of the same caliber

were used in both shooting incidents which may have

been related. In this crime, with the type of motive

involved, telephone surveillances of selected persons

are most valuable and necessary since a remark during

a conversation or a contact often results in leads

to the solution of the crime which would not otherwise

be available, Bealfhas been selected as a person

likely to lead to the solution of these murders.

AL. FATAH

Over the past several years, Al Fatah, a leading Arab

terrorist organization with headquarters in Beirut, Lebanon, has

had continuing interest in Black Panther Party (BPP) activities

in the United States. Black Panther

Party - Cleaver Faction

(BPP-CF) leader Eldridge Cleaver, upon meeting with Yasser Arafat,

Al Fatah leader, in 1969, vowed full support by the Panthers of

Al Fatah activities. BPP-CF leaders from the United States and

Algeria have reportedly traveled to the Middle East for indoctri-

nation and tactical guerrilla training. In April, 1972, informa-

tion was developed indicating that the BPP-CF is planning the

recruitment of trainees to travel to Algeria where they would be

instructed in sniper tactics. These terrorists would be specifi-

cally trained in use of ground fire to attack the Presidential

helicopter and would be utilized if the decision is made by BPP-CF

leadership to assassinate the President of the United States. .

The BPP-CF was originated in February, 1971, following

a split between Huey P. Newton and Leroy Eldridge Cleaver, leaders

of the violence-oriented BPP. Cleaver is a fugitive from justice

living in self-imposed exile in Algiers, Algeria, from which

location he controls the International Section of the BPP-CF.

Since its inception, the BPP-CF, with national headquarters at

2026 Seventh Avenue, New York City, has advocated increased

disruption of and violence against existing order. It strongly

Al Fatah

advocates urban guerrilla warfare in the United States. Within

the past jear, individuals associated with the BPP-CE have been

directly linked to murders, skyjackings, assaults on police

officers, and armed robberies.

Its scope of operation, however,.

has been

limited due to lack of financial resources.

Recently, information was received that Al Fatah is

now willing to support financially BPP-CF activities in the

United States including purchase of weapons and explosives.

In

mid-August, 1972, an Al Fatah operative, at the direction of

Eldridge Cleaver, contacted BPP-CE member Charles Imile Pratt, who

resides at 19108 Northwood Avenue, Carson, California. According -

to the information, Pratt was to arrange for acquisition of weapons

and ammunition and to make underground contacts needed by. Al Fatah

for an operation in the United States similar to that which

occurred in May, 1972, at Lod Airport, Tel Aviv, Israel, in which

29 persons were killed as the result of an Arab-directed terrorist

attack. Pratt introduced the Al Fatah operative to John William

Washington, a BPP-CF member, who then resided at 1136 West 93rd

street, Los Angeles, California,

and who now resides at 4844z Mascot

Street, Los Angeles. Washington reportedly received 5500 from the

Al Fatah operative and traveled to the East to obtain arms and

weapons that were to be used in terrorist acts in the United States.

Although aborted, these acts were to occur simultaneous to and in

consort with the recent terrorist acts at the Olympic Games in

Munich, Germany.

Two confidential sources, who are knowledgeable

concerning Al Fatah activities in the United States, have furnished

additional information corroborative of the data set forth above.

The first source advised in March, 1972, that an Al Fatah leader

in Beirut indicated that Al Fatah has trained agents, not connected

with Al Fatah, based in the United States who are members of black

nationalist groups and who stand ready to carry out acts of

sabotage in behalf of Al Fatah. A second source confirmed that

Al Fatah, during 1972, has contacted members of the BPP in

California concerning plans for acts of terrorism in the

United States.

The disastrous events which occurred at the 1972 Olympic

Games and at lod Airport clearly demonstrate the foreign potential

and capability of Arab terrorist organizations. The utilization

by Al Fatah of BPP-CF members to assist in carrying out acts of

terrorism would closely parallel the tactics employed at Lod

Airport in Tel Aviv in which Japanese nationals were utilized by

Al Fatah to carry out a terrorist attack.

Foreign intelligence information essential to the

security of the United States, which

information is necessary to

protect the Nation against actual or potential attack or any other

hostile action of a foreign power, may be reasonably expected to

be obtained trom a telephone surveillance on the residence of_

John William Washington, BPP-CF member in the Los Angeles area who

is acting as an agent of Al Fatah in the United States.

which is set forth above have furnished reliable information in

at least temporarily, as a headquarters to conduct Los Angeles

Black Panther Party business.. As you are aware, the Black

Panther Party is a black extremist violence-prone, organization.

The Los Angeles, California, chapter has been one of its most

active chapters.

A surveillance of Carter's telephone would be a

valuable supplement to the telephone surveillance on Los Angeles

Black Fanther Party headquarters which you initially approved

on March 20, 1969, and renewed for a three-month period on

September 8, 1969. This coverage has provided invaluable

information not available through other sources.

A surveillance on Carter's)telephone might furnish a

valuable insight into the current power struggle between factions

of the Los Angeles Black fanther Party in which the subject 1s

prominently involved. In view of her/current position, she will

undoubtedly be contacted on matters of planning and policy. For

the same reason she]should be in contact with numerous individuals

who are actively engaged in Black Panther Party activities in

an underground capacity.

The Black Panther Party openly advocates the use

of guns and guerrilla tactics in preparation for revolutionary

activity against the Government.

All members are under

instructions to possess large caliber firearms. They have

plotted to blow up police stations and have attempted to do

so. They are known

to possess dynamite and other explosives.

During November, 1968, Black Panther leaders

rom across the country gathered in the san francisco

this crime.

Iwelve of these individuals have been indicted

and are awaiting trial.

The new

headquarters is being utilized for planning and directing

on behalf of the BPP!,

A survey of this telephone number

for the period from October 6, 1969, through October 28,

1969, disclosed over 150 long distance telephone calls

ranging from New York to the West Coast.

Much of the BPP policy-making apparatus will be

located at New Haven during the next several months and it

is telt that instructions affecting the overall movement

will possibly be issued through the New Haven BPP office.

In view of the violence-prone nature of the BPP,]

it can reasonably be anticipated that subjects involved in

past or future criminal violations may be monitored. The

guidelines to be followed, as previously furnished by you,

will be strictly complied with in such instances.

If you approve, a telephone surveillance will be

LIHITE PANTHER PARTY - YOUTH

INTERNATIONAL, PARTI

INTERNAL SECURITY - ANARCHIST

Reference is made to your letter May 6, 1969,

concerning the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act

of 1968.

The White Panther Party is a self-described

revolutionary organization which is a strong support group

for the Black Panther Party: The Youth International Party,

which is also known as the Yippies, was organized in early

1968 by militant activists Jerry Rubin and Abbott Hoîfman.

These two organizations recently formed a coalition and the

combination of the two groups indicates the development of

the organization as a leading revolutionary white group in

the United States.

The headquarters of this organization is

located at 1520 Hill Street, Ann Arbor, Michigan! Three

officers of the white Panther Party have been indicted for

the bombing of a Central Intelligence Agency office in

AnD Arbor, Michigan, in September, 1968.

One of these indi-

viduals, Lawrence Plamondon, was a recent Bureau fugitive

and was apprehended on July 23, 1970. He is currently in

custody in lieu of $100,000 bond.

At the time of his arrest in an automobile by the

Hichigan State Police, weapons and other incendiary devices

were found. Also found was numerous written material which

indicates Plamondon may have been using the same underground

apparatus which has been serving Weatherman and other New

leftist fugitives. Plamondon noted in this material that

conditions in this country must escalate to "revolutionary

violence" where battles will not be on police level of law

and order but on war level which will force the calling out of

the Army. Plamondon refers to this new level of violence as

involving "bombs and sabotage." He further states that financial

problems are severe and that "they" are going to have to get into

"ripping off banks like our brothers in South America.'

He also

suggested that the example of "the brothers in South America"

who kidnap American ambassadors to trade off for prisoners should:

be followed.

Milton Taube, a hite Panther Party national officer,

was also arrested with Plamondon on July 23, 1970. Taube is

known to have been a contemporary and extremely cicse associate

of Willian Ayers, a Weatherman member who is currently a Bureau

fugitive.

raube, at the time of his arrest, was a resident at

White Panther Party/headquarters and has resided at this address

for several years.

furthermore, all business transactions of

the White Panther

Party are transmitted through this address.

Investigation by this Bureau has indicated that only some half

dozen top

deaders in theLihite Panther Party are privy to

sensitive White Panther Party information. He have one live

informant who has access to some information in this organization.

A telephone surveillance on the headquarters of the

White Panther Party - Youth International Party is expected to

provide extremely valuable information concerning the whereabouts

of Weatherman fugitives

-also be expected that intormation concerning possible violent

plans on the part of this organization will be obtained.

It can be expected that any individuals who have access

to the White Panther Party headquarters may become subjects of

either local or Federal criminal violations.,

It is also

The African Liberation Day Coordinating Committee

(ALDCC) is an ad hoe black coalition which is in the process

of organizing an African Liberation Day demonstration in

Washington, D. C., on May 27, 1972. The purpose of the

demonstration is to protest United States involvement in

south Atrica and to show Atrican-American solidarity with

African liberation groups.

To carry out its objectives on a mass level, a

large protest demonstration is being planned as the logical

vehicle of expression.

Broad-based local ALDCCs are being

set up in major United States cities, Toronto, Canada, and

in the Caribbean area. These committees are working with

the ALDCC headquarters in Washington, D. C., to spearhead

efforts to mobilize at least 10,000 black people to come

together in Washington, D. C., n May 21, 1972. Corresponding

demonstrations are also being organized in San Francisco,

California; Toronto, Canada, and in the Caribbean area on

May 25 and 27, 1972.

Plans are being formulated in Washington, D. C., to

assemble at Meridian Hill Park, 16th and U Streets, N.W.

The

The National Steering Committee of the ALDCC has

designated Howard Lamar Fuller as Chairman. Members of the •

National Steering, Committee include Huey P. Newton, LeRoi Jones,

and Roosevelt Bernard Douglas. Statements of endorsement of

the ALDCC have been received from Stokely Carmichael and

H. Rap Brown.

Fuller is President of the Malcolm X Liberation

University in Greensboro, North Carolina, and during an

address February 23, 1972, before a group of 200 people

at Howard University, Washington, D. C., he stated there

would be no change in this society without revolution and

that basic changes should be in political and economic

structures.

The April 1, 1972, issue of "Contrast," a Canadian

newspaper self-identified as serving the black community,;

disclosed Fuller reportedly visited Africa during the Fall

of 1971 and made contact with liberation army leaders. He

spent approximately 45 days among fighters under battle

conditions and was urged upon his

return to the United States

to mobilize "brothers and sisters" in demonstrations to protest

United States and Canadian involvement in Southern Africa.

Huey P. Newton is the leader of the Black Panther

Party and the March, 1972, issue of a national publication

quotes Newton as saying, "Armed struggle is still my belief,

and always will be. We have to get it to that point. We're

building and organizing an army to finally get people to the

point where we'll fight, because we believe that the only way

we will resolve the final contradiction is through armed

struggle."

must be Black ruled or they will not be ruled at all....

Unless we Black people can come into peaceful power and

begin the benevolent rule of the just, the next phase of

armed rebellion will burn Newark to the ground."

With regard to Roosevelt Bernard Douglas, a

West Indian now residing in Canada, it is noted he was

convicted in April, 1971, of charges in connection with a

student riot in Montreal, Canada, during January and

February, 1969.

A source, who has provided reliable information in

the past, reported that during 1971 Roosevelt Douglas attempted

to organize an uprising in the Caribbean.

•During public speeches made in 1967 throughout the

United States, H. Rap Brown has called for "rebellion by any

means" and "massive civil disobedience."

In a speech at the University. of Hawaii October 31,

1968, Stokely Carmichael declared, "I am stating affirmatively

that we are for revolutionary violence as a way to crush

racism and capitalism to change the status quo and to liberate

black people. " '

BLACK PANTHER PARTY (BPP)

According to the official newspaper of the Black

Panther Party (BPP), the BPP was started during December, 1966,

in Oakland, California, to organize black people so they can

take control of the life, politics, and the destiny of the black

community.

It was organized by Bobby G. Seale, BPP Chairman,

and Huey P. Newton, Minister of Defense.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," has

regularly stated that the BPP advocates the use of guns and

guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression

of the black people. Residents of the black community are urged

to arm themselves against the police, consistently referred to

as "pigs," who should be killed.

The newspaper, in its issue of September 7, 1968, had

an article by the then Minister of Education, George Murray.

This article ended with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everywhere!

Arm yourselves. The only culture

worth keeping is revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom

everywhere. Dynamite. Black power. Use the gun. Kill

the pigs everywhere."

The BPP newspaper, issue of October 5, 1968, had an

article introduced with the following statement:

"We will

not

dissent from American government. We will overthrow it."

David Hilliard, Chief of Staff, BPP, in a speech at

the San Francisco Polo Field on November

will kill Richard Nixon."

David Hilliard, in "The New York Times," issue of

December 13, 1969, was quoted as follows:

"We advocate the

very direct overthrow of the government by way of force and

violence."

In the issue of April 25, 1970, the BPP newspaper

had an article by Minister of Culture Emory Douglas as follows:

"The only way to make this racist U. S. government administer

justice to the people it is oppressing, is ... by taking

up arms against this government, killing the officials,

until the reactionary forces... are dead, and those that

are left turn their weapons on their superiors, thereby

passing revolutionary judgement against the number one

enemy of all mankind, the racist U. S. government."

The BPP headquarters is located at 1046 Peralta Street,

Oakland, California. Branches of the BPP and Committees to

Combat Fascism, under control of the BPP, have been established

in various locations in the United States.

Newton exercises autocratic control of BPP national

headquarters and through national headquarters all of the BPP

branches. He rules from his apartment at 1200 Lakeshore

Boulevard, Oakland, California, issuing instructions by telephone

land holding policy conferences in the apartment.

The BPP established an international section at

Algiers, Algeria, in 1969, through which it maintained liaison

Hemorandum for the Attorney General

Since the installation of these surveillances,

information has been developed, on a daily. basis, regarding

plans, movements and activities of individuals responsible

for the massive demonstration in Washington, D.C., on April 24;

1971, and who plan violence and civil disobedience during

May, 1971. For example, information was developed that a

group planned to break away from the massive demonstration

in Washington, D.C., on April 24, 1971, and attempt to take

over the South Vietnamese Embassy: by way. of Dupont Circle.

This information enabled the Metropolitan Police Department

to effectively block Dupont. Circle well in advance. of the

approaching demonstrators and thwart this plan. In addition,

this coverage developed information regarding a schism which

developed between the National Peace Action Coalition (NPAC)

and the pay which cosponsored the demonstration. on

April 24,

1971, due to NPAC, fears that'

PCPJ was planning violence.

These surveillances also enabled this Bureau to follow

closely the activities of many of the major suspects in the

bombing of the U. S.. Capitol on March 1, 1971, and other

New Left extremists who might actively engage

in violence and:

terrorism during May, 1971.

The period which offers the greatest potential for

violence and civil disobedience in Washington, D.C., continues

to be the first week in lay, 1971. It is expected

that these

telephone surveillances will continue to furnish this Bureau

detailed advance plans of co

MDC] and other New Left

activists to engage in such violence and civil disobedience.

There is also the continued possibility that information will

be developed regarding plans of these groups and individuals

to violate the Antiriot Law statute, the Destruction of

MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.

In carrying out the Marxist-Leninist ideology of the

Progressive Labor Party? lorker student Alliance members have

repeatedly sought to become

involved in labor disputes on the

side of labor, join picket lines and engage in disruptive

and sometimes violent tactics against industry recruiters on

college campuses. For example, on February 18, 1970, several

thousand demonstrators protested the presence of General Electric

recruiters on the University of Michigan campus. (Worker

Student Alliance members were included in the leadership of

this demonstration which snowballed into city-wide violence

and extensive damage occurred to banks and police cars in

the areas.

This faction is currently very active in many of the

major demonstrations and student violence on college campuses.

It is making all-out efforts to assume leadership in the anti-

war movement and is in the forefront of organizations

maintaining steady agitation to stop military, recruitment and

abolish the Reserve Officers' Training Corps:

academic year over five hundred campus demonstrations have

taken place.

Over two thousand arrests have been made and there

have been forty-one cases of attempted arson and four cases

of bombing. Nearly two million dollars in damages have been

inflicted to college facilities.

Last sunmer Worker Student Alliance had a Summer.

Work-In project designed to infiltrate industry and it has

made plans to rejuvenate this project this summer. Worker

Student Alliance leaders have repeatedly encouraged action against

Industrial concerns, both off and on campus with General Electric

being the main target. New Left advocates are believed to be

responsible for the bombing of General Electric offices in

New York City on February 7, 8, 1970. On March 1l, 1970,

powerful bombs also destroyed the offices of three major

corporations in New York City.

The leadership of Worker Student Alliance, is extremely

security conscious at this time. Many of its leaders are

traveling throughout the United States, especially the South,

in an effort to promote the aims of the group, as well as

directing agitation against universities and industry.
