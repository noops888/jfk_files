a nonomicial cover assignment is subject also to personal interview by a

designee of Chief, Central Cover Staft, for assessment as to his sult-

ability for the proposea cover.

This interview, when required, will be

At the conclusion of the discussions with the operating divisions and

Renewal of Robert S. HUNKELER Contract

Action Required: As Indicated

The present contract with Robert S. HUNKELER expires on 31

March 1967 and the question of renewal is up for immediate treatment

and decision.

The paragraphs below outline the major factors to be

'considered in this matter.

HUNKELER 15 a

former staff officer who resigned from WOFACI

in 1964 to establish a market research and marketing firm. He was

recontacted in the spring of 1965 and employed as an independent con-

tracter by the then COS, JWAVE,

who expressed the hope that this

relationship night set a standard for use by WOFACT of former staff

officers as long term clandestine assets and outlined HUNKELER's duties

and responsibilities as follows:

a. To provide cover for WOFACT personnel abroad.

Spotter and assessor of Central American consular

community in Niami.

Spotter and assessor of recruitment targets throughou

atin and Central America as developed through his travels and contacts.

Third party recruiter and agent handler, but only th

certain carefully controlled circunstances.

These original concepts framing HUNKELER's activities have

continued as the major guide lines to his employment.

Also added was

the task of reporting such positive and operational intelligence as he

might elicit from his contacts and associates..

There has been no other use by WOFACT of this HUNKELER potential during

the past two years. Such use in the future is an open question depend-

ing in part on whether WOFACT

has a requirement for cover facilities

such as this, and in part on the nature of our relationship with HUNKELEF.

HUNKELER has met frequently with members of the Central

and Latin

American consular community in the Miami area.

These assoc-

iations were enhanced by HUNKELER's activity and participation in

several international organizations concerned with business and social

relations among Latin and North American countries.

clared himself always ready and willing to take on agent handling tasks,

but the Station has found it more advantageous and efficient to use

inside personnel for this.

It is highly unlikely that station policy

will change in this regard.

HUNKELER has been on several business trips during this period.

On these occasions he was given an intelligence brief and his operation-

al expenses were defrayed by WOFACT.

The results, in terms of dissemine

ated reports, have kenerally been negative.

Recently, HUNKELER provided an introduction to some individuals

who have a potential for use in

the JNLION program.

There was some

discussion of continued activity for HUNKELER in this program, but 1t

was the consensus that there was not sufficient promise in his

MERO RANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

Operational Review of Robert S. Hunkeler

DATE:

16 February 1967

Background:

Shortly after Hunkeler resigned from KUBARK he

met with the then Chief of Station on several occasions

concerning Hunkelers potential use as a Station asset.

It was between the period following his resignation, and

before his first contract with the Station, that the Cos

told Hunkeler that he was in a "cooling off period" during

which time Hunkeler should devote his energies towards the

settlement of his personal affairgand the development of

his own business interests. Hunkeler was also told that

his value to the Station and to KUBARK would be increased

11 he were free from all ties with KUBARK and ODYOKE In

order that flunkeler may be available at a later date for

KUBARK assignments. The COS did not, however, make any

commitments to Hunkeler.

Developments:

2.

During the months which followed Hunkelers resignation

he proceeded to attend to his personal affairs in Lakeland,

Plorida, and

established his company, Identity A, in the

WAVE area.

SEGRET:

## Page 50

- 2 -

3.

After a number of months had lapsed, Hunkeler

was contacted by the Station COS and was recruited under

a contract in the amount of $500.00 a month plus operational

expenses. Hunkeler expressed a willingness to undertake

any assignment and a desire to actively participate in

operations. (His initial target was largely limited to

the monitoring of the activities and the personalities of

the foreign consular corp in the lAVE area and reporting

on matters of operational interest as they came to Hunkelers

attention.)

4..

Shortly after Hunkeler was placed under contract

he submitted a paper to the Station which spelled out a

number of specific tasks which he could, under the cover

of his company if required, undertake for the Station

Or KUBARK. (There aroignments are st111 oomptablo with.

tio prevent over and baokgrount.) There follows a list

of these tasks;

(a) Sale of KURIOT doctored parts and supplies

to the government of PBRUMEN through middlemen

and in a manner as to not disclose Hunkelers

involvement.

(b)

Providing non-official cover

facilities

to persons being assigned

overgeas

and

who require

tight, realistic and flexible cover.

(c)

Recruitment pitches, courier work, or

related assignments anywhere in Latin America.

(d) Monitoring of diplomatic and commercial

activities in the vAVE area.

(e) Reporting on targets of operational

Interest, both in the wAVE ares and in those

countries here Funkeler visits.

(1) Spotting and assessment of specific operational

targets in the PEPRIME and in Latin America.

Review of Accomolishments:

5.

Whereas Hunkeler remained ready and willing to

travel anywhere at anytime for any KUBARk assignment, he

was advised that his long range value would be jeopardized

if he rere to take operational assignments involving any

degree of risk. Hunkeler was, in his opinion, "kept in a

vacuun" as regards his being able to serve field Stations

which have not to this date been made aware of his availability

to travel except in those cases when his business travel takes

to a country and the

é field Station is advised of his presence

in the area.

6.

From the outset Hunkeler began to report on develop-

ments in the jAVE area and he began to work in organizations

which would permit him to penetrate the diplomatic community

•

## Page 52

= 4 -

and strengthen his operational capabilities in terms of

being able to spot and asgess Latin American political

leaders. Hunkeler got him-self appointed to a policy

making position in the Identity B, he was elected to

the position of President of Identity C, appointed to

the Board of Directors of Identity D, was elected to

the position of President of Identity E, and became a

delegate to several conferences (Panama, Jamaica and

1x. PBPRIME) of the Identity F.

It was largely as a result of Hunkelers Latin

Anerican oriented commercial activities and his organizational

activities that he uns sble to provide tirely and valuable

reports on the Dominican crisis, establish a personal

relationship with Identity G and persons close to him,

spot and access several Fanamanian targets, and report

on the activities and recommendations of Identity H, an

organization which provides commercial policy to the President

of Panama. (See

Hunkeler kept the Station

up to date on the personalities and

activities of the Consular

Corp in the WiVE area, and has furnished assessments and

biographic information on 12 members of this group.

"em.

Other accomplishnents include the followirg;

(a) Operational erorting: During the last two

years Hunkeler has traveled to and submitted

operational and/or intel reports about lexico,

the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, Venezuela,

Panana and Costa Rica, in addition to reports

originating in the WAVE area.

(b) Establishment of Cover Facilities: In 1966

Hunkeler set up and maintained cover facilities

for an agent who was initially trained in Hunkelers

companies and subsequently assigned to a European

post where he remained until a personill reduction

cut caused his termination. The cover aspects of

this cover operation, however, were tight and

professionally maged by Hunkeler. Other cover

facilities developed by Hunkeler in this period

included a cover office facility in Haiti, Venezuela

and the Dominican Republic.

(e)

Other: In late 1966 Hunkeler met with an Officer

ässigned to the WAVE Station for the purpose of

reviewing the operational potentiais of the "aribbean.

Hunkeler was able to provide the Officer with the

names and introductions to persons well known to

lunkeler who are now in the Caribbean or residing

in Milani and available to participate in zent, p.a.,

or informant capacities.

## Page 54

- 6 -

Present Situation:

9. In early February, 1966, Hunkeler met with a lase

Officer of the tracas Station who reviewed Hunkelers existing

business activities in Venezuela and who told Hunkeler that

the Caracas Station desired to use a Hunkeler company for

non-official cover purposes in Venezuela. The success

of Hunkelers commercial activities in the Dominican Republic

(and the corresponding move by Hunkeler to open an office

in Santo Domingo) is a recent development and there has not

yet been time to query Station Santo Domingo as to whether or

not they have a requirement to use Hunkelers facilities.

(Hunkeler is presently phasing

out of much organizational

work in the WAVE area in order to devote

more. time to the

chore

of setting up his operations

in Santo Domingo and

Venezuela where both of his companies

are currently doing

business.)

10.

There are

several aspects of Hunkelers present business

activities which have not yet been finalized: He will soon

terminate his lease at his present address and has not yet

decided where to re-locate lis offces; he is still in

negotiations with an investment group in Haiti and nay

undertake a consultant type survey there which would provide

access to Halti of possible interest to that Station.

Friture Potentialg:

When lunkelers contract was about to expire in

Pebruary, 1966, he met with a Station Officer and advised

that he was

fully in accord with a salary cut from $500.00

to $300.00 a month in keeping with budgetary cuts which

were evident at that time. Moreover, Hunkeler volunterily

ceased requesting reinbursement or operational expenses

choosing to use his KUBARK income for entertainment expenses

which oftines have operational value to KUBARK. Although he
