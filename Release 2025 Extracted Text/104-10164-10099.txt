SUBJECT: POSSIBLE RELEASE OF CUBAN EXILE LEADER ORLANDO BOSCH
REFERENCE: WASHINGTON 173605
1. LEGALLY THERE IS LITTLE CHANCE OF CONVICTING BOSCH
AND THE OTHERS BECAUSE THE CRIME WAS NOT COMMITTED IN VENEZUELA
AND THUS VENEZUELA HAS NO JURISDICTION IN THE CASE. SECONDLY,
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE AGAINST BOSCH AND GROUP. THESE ARE THE
OPINIONS OF A NUMBER OF STATION AGENTS AND CONTACTS INCLUDING
VENEZUELAN LEGAL EXPERTS SUCH AS WKALIKE-1, WKDIET-6 AND
NKSCARLET-٩.
2.. WHILE HERNAN AND LUGO SUPPOSEDLY CONFESSED TO THE
CRIME IN TRINIDAD, THEIR CONFESSIONS ARE NOT ADMISSABLE IN
COURT AND THEY HAVE DECLINED TO REPEAT THEM FOR VENEZUELAN
JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES. THE EVIDENCE LINKING HERNAN AND LUGO
TO POSADA COMES FROM TELEPHONE TAPS, WHICH ARE LIKEWISE
INADMISSABLE, BOSCH'S CONNECTION WITH THE CASE COMES FROM.
A TELEPHONE CONVERSATION BETWEEN LUGO AND POSADA IN WHICH
THE NAME "ORLANDO" IS MENTIONED. DEFENSE ATTORNEYS COULD
MAKE A GOOD CASE THAT THE "ORLANDO" WAS DISIP OFFICER ORLANDO
GARCIA AND NOT ORLANDO BOSCH.
3. THE GOV COULD, OF COURSE, PUT PRESSURE ON THE COURT
AND JUGGLE THE EVIDENCE TO GET A CONVICTION, BUT TO DO SO WOULD
LEAVE IT OPEN FOR CRITICISM INTERNALLY AND REPRISALS FROM THE
CUBAN EXILES, AND WOULD MAKE IT MORE LIKELY THAT THE DEFEND
DANTS WOULD DIVULGE EMBARRASSING INFORMATION CONNECTING
GOVERNMENT FIGURES TO BOSCH AND THE EXILES HE LED.

OTHER GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WERE CONCERNED THAT BOSCH MIGHT
INDEED DIE. SHOULD THIS OCCUR. LEPAGE SAID HE HAD NO DOUBT
THAT VENEZUELA WOULD BECOME THE TARGET FOR CUBAN EXILE TERRORIST
ATTACKS. LEPAGE EXPLAINED THAT BOSCH'S DEATH WOULD MEAN
PROBLEMS FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND THE EXILE COMMUNITY.
THEREFORE.
LEPAGE ASKED THE EXILE LEADER TO TALK WITH BOSCH AND ATTEMPT
TO DISSUADE HIM FROM CONTINUING WITH THE STRIKE.
3. THE CUBAN EXILE LEADER ACCOMPANIED BY REINALDO
MARTIN CANO, A CUBAN EXILE PHYSICIAN, VISITED BOSCH IN
THE HOSPITAL ON 21 FEBRUARY AND FOUND HIM TO BE IN SERIOUS
PHYSICAL CONDITION. BOSCH ALLOWED MARTIN TO GIVE HIM INJECTIONS
TO COMBAT BRAIN DEHYDRATION, BUT REFUSED ANY OTHER TREATMENT.

TO: WASHINGTON,
FOR: LA/VCE
of
SUBJECT: POSSIBLE RELEASE OF CUBAN EXILE LEADER ORLANDO BOSCH
REFERENCE: WASHINGTON 173605
1. LEGALLY THERE IS LITTLE CHANCE OF CONVICTING BOSCH
AND THE OTHERS BECAUSE THE CRIME WAS NOT COMMITTED IN VENEZUELA
AND THUS VENEZUELA HAS NO JURISDICTION IN THE CASE. SECONDLY,
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE AGAINST BOSCH AND GROUP. THESE ARE THE
OPINIONS OF A NUMBER OF STATION AGENTS AND CONTACTS INCLUDING
VENEZUELAN LEGAL EXPERTS SUCH AS WKALIKE-1, WKDIET-6 AND
NKSCARLET-٩.
2.. WHILE HERNAN AND LUGO SUPPOSEDLY CONFESSED TO THE
CRIME IN TRINIDAD, THEIR CONFESSIONS ARE NOT ADMISSABLE IN
COURT AND THEY HAVE DECLINED TO REPEAT THEM FOR VENEZUELAN
JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES. THE EVIDENCE LINKING HERNAN AND LUGO
TO POSADA COMES FROM TELEPHONE TAPS, WHICH ARE LIKEWISE
INADMISSABLE, BOSCH'S CONNECTION WITH THE CASE COMES FROM.
A TELEPHONE CONVERSATION BETWEEN LUGO AND POSADA IN WHICH
THE NAME "ORLANDO" IS MENTIONED. DEFENSE ATTORNEYS COULD
MAKE A GOOD CASE THAT THE "ORLANDO" WAS DISIP OFFICER ORLANDO
GARCIA AND NOT ORLANDO BOSCH.
3. THE GOV COULD, OF COURSE, PUT PRESSURE ON THE COURT
