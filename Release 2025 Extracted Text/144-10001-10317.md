On the subject of the conversation which MIKOYAN had with

President JOHNSON, the Department told us that it does not yet

have a record of the conversation. As far as our interlocutor

knew the conversation was of a general nature. MIKOYAN, after

expressing the sincere sorrow of the head of the Soviet Govern-

ment and the entire Soviet population for the tragic death of

President KENNEDY, expressed hope that relations between the

two countries could continue to develop peacefully in conformity

with the KENNEDY policy. President JOHNSON gave assurances that

it is his firm intention to keep the preceding line of policy

unaltered.

MIKOYAN then met with RUSK.

The conversation lasted about an hour. The Department told

us that MIKOYAN began by repeating the ideas expressed to JOHNSON,

and RUSK assured him that the change of Presidents did not mean

a change in the foreign policy of the United States. In spite of

the fact that the two countries have different positions on many

international questions--RUSK continued--it is necessary to

explore the area of common interests even if it is not possible

to conclude formal agreements.

The conversation was then devoted to problems of disarmament,

limitation of the arms race, and reduction of military expenditures.

Particular importance was given to the question of nondissemination

of nuclear arms.

On this last aspect MIKOYAN repeated the well-

known Soviet thesis concerning the incompatibility between an

agreement on nondissemination and the establishment of a NATO

multilateral force.

Bilateral problems were then briefly mentioned and RUSK

expressed hope that discussions on a consular agreement and

negotiations on cultural exchange can be fruitful.

RUSK then concluded the talk by affirming that, on the

broader international problems, the United States will discuss

the Western position with its allies in December.
