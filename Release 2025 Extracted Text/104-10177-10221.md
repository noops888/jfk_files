Subject 1s presently employed In Paris by Trans World Airline

In the capacity of Special Sales Representative. He. Is well krown to

Douglas C. Haw and Eleanor T. HARteLL,

the forcer naving known hir

socially for a nunber of yearo and the latter having dealt with him on

transportation problems since his appointment, fifteen months ago, to the

position he non occupies with IlA..

2.

Subject is also

a long-time friend of UNCTED, who broight him

to our attention as a potential recruit and who has provided us with the

biographical information eontained in the attached personal record forma

No. 51-67.

30

Fron rhat I have been able to gather from UNLOVED, as vell as

from HARP and HARTiEIL,

subject appears to be the type or individual which

might be ideally suited to

fulfill certain valuable operational assigmm.ints

in 'France, such as "spotter" for other high-level potential agents, high-

level costacts,

cut-out, etc. All who know him agree that subject is capable

of "doing

anytaire and getufrie to know aryone" if he so chooses.

Apparertly

süticoti, despite the "bräss" nich surrounds his perceptible personality, is

a serious-minded, Irtelligent and patriotic Individual who nas tail such ex-

perience alory lines which could be of use to this organization, as, mell as

an uncanny knack of beine able to introduce and ingratiate hiasel into prac-

tically any nilley of interest to his nork or wishos. A paral list of

suuject's fairly close friends, as reported by UNOVED on Page 8ma of attach

In this area. Undouttedly, subjoct hinself could add a much longer list of

PISASON, Chairsan of the Board of TiA, assured aubject he rould endeavor

to secure for hin an additional allotrent of funds to supplement h1s

present expense account budget.

Due to budgetary restrictions this has

not been possible and subject is at present seeking arother, more reuner-

ative position, since le claims that his present Incowe of approxinately

$666:00 monthly (including expense account) is Insüffluient to permit hin

to live in Parts and maintain the contacts and activity required by his

job. According to UNLOVED, subjoct is at present endeavoring to secure

from his good friend Benjamin KATZ (President of the Gruen Watch Co.) the

sales agency for Gruen watches in Europe.

bearhile, horever, subject is

not contemplating resigning his position with tiA until he has a firm and

more reminerative prsition. UMICVED states that subject plans to renain

with Ild at least until the end of the year, by which time he may have

secured sonewling better. Subject has also harl talks with James A. FARIFY

(on his receni trip to France) concerning the possibility of handling the

Coca-Cola agency here.

Nothing has come ci this possibility to date, but

subject appears to be hopeful.

UNLOVED is of the opinion that subject would be nost receptivo

to a proposition of doiro intelligence work and furthermore believes that

if subject could supplement his present income by an additional $200 or

5300 per sonth, he would be willing to remain with Tili, thich he likes

and is only considering leaviny due to his present lon total income,

of which is spent in connection with activities required by his positiou.

8: UMOVED has, of course, lever even hinted to subject anything

about his can undercover activities and is sure subject does not suspect

that the forner is doing anything but his cover work in France.

when questioned as to his opinion concerning subject's potential value

as a covert agont, as tell as his rec-uitability, has pointed out very

strongly that subject, que to the very nature of his personality; must

be given a good deal of operational fuidance and be closely controlled.

Questioned as to whecher sone other indivitual should endeavor to recruit

subject, UNaVED raj of tho opinion trat,

should the organization desire

to do so, he wouid be best fitted to exploit subject's posential, sance
