MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation with Gordon Novel.
Gordon Novel called the New Orleans office on 13 August 1981.
Ronald Farris was away on Annual Leave and had arranged to have his calls
forwarded automatically to the Houston Field Office's listed telephone
number. When the call was answered with the Houston number, Novel indi-
cated that he was calling the New Orleans office. He was told that Farris
was out of the office for a week and his calls were being relayed to
Houston. Novel asked how he would go about obtaining his personal Agency
file under the Freedom of Information Act. He was told that he should
address a letter to Freedom of Information Coordinator with his request.
He then indicated that he had done this already, and the information sent
to him was so severely edited and sanitized that it was difficult to make
sense of it. He did, however, discover that it contained information that
was erroneous and he asked how to go about refuting the misinformation
and/or correcting the file. It was suggested that he write a letter
detailing the discrepancies and request that a change be made. He did
not seem interested in doing that and promptly changed his line of
questioning. He asked how he would go about contacting the Director of
the Agency directly. He was told that he should use the local represent-
ative, Mr. Farris, to relay any information he might wish to get to the
Director. Novel indicated that he had only talked to Farris once, but
was anxious to bypass the usual channels to avoid having his information
mishandled or misconstrued. He was told that Farris was a highly qualified
representative of the Agency and the proper individual to contact regarding
information he wished to get to the Director's attention. He gave a small
sinister chuckle and replied, "We'll see about that," then hung up.

Gordon Novel
1. Gordon Novel is a somewhat notorious figure
who first came to the attention of this Agency during the
Garrision Investigation into the assassination of
President Kennedy. From time to time he has claimed to
be a CIA employee or to be acting on behalf of the CIA.
He has never been employed by the Agency and has had no
contacts with the Agency except for occasional visits to
Domestic Collection Division offices. He has been in
several scrapes with the law, most recently in October
1976 when he was on trial for conspiracy to firebomb
several buildings in New Orleans. Mr. Novel has now
filed a civil suit claiming alleged violations of his
rights and interference with his personal affairs.
is not suing the Agency but he has named Mr. Howard
Osborn as a defendant. Mr. Osborn has been in touch with
the Office of General Counsel seeking representation by
the Justice Department since he feels his being named in
the suit probably resulted from his official duties with
the Agency..
He
2. On 27 April 1977 Mr. George Jameson of the
Office of General Counsel contacted the undersigned to
inquire whether we had a file on Novel and if the file
showed any reason why Mr. Novel should have named
Mr. Osborn as a defendant in the suit. Mr. Jameson was
given a rundown on the nature of the information in
Novel's file and was also provided with Mr. Osborn's
retirement date, 26 February 1974. Mr. Jameson mentioned
that most of the alleged alleged activities complained about by
-31dec 74

CL BY 007472

CONFIDENTIAL
Novel occurred in 1975 and there is no apparent reason
for Novel having singled out Mr. Osborn as a defendant.
Mr. Jameson also requested traces on two individuals
who are alleged to have been involved in this matter--
Larry Blanscett and Bridget Pfiffer. He was advised
that the Office of Security had no record of either of
these individuals.
3.
Mr. Jameson indicated that we would probably
be receiving a formal request for pertinent information
as this case develops, but he merely needed a preliminary
reading in order to determine if Mr. Osborn should be
defended by the Department of Justice in this litigation.
Aside from indexing the names of Blanscett and Pfiffer to
Novel's file, no further action is contemplated by the
undersigned.

Reference is made to your memorandum of transmittal

dealt with a contact of your New Orleans Office with one
Gordon Novel. According to the report, during his contact
Mr. Novel indicated that he had a relationship with the
Central Intelligence Agency. This is to advise you that a
check of the appropriate records of the Central Intelligence
Agency has determined that Mr. Novel is not and has never
been an employee of this Agency.

1. Reference is made to your 20 October 1976 priority
request (OGC 76-5787) which asks that the Office of Security
search its indices to determine if any of the above-named
individuals have ever been employed by the Agency. Reference
is further made to our telephonic response to you on 20 October
1976 confirming that none of these individuals have ever been
employed by the Agency.
2. This memorandum will serve to confirm the referenced
telephonic response. Office of Security indices contain no
record in the name of Lawrence B. Rohde, which was also searched
in the variation of Lawrence B. Rhode. The Office of Security
does maintain files on Gordon Dwane Novel and Allen D. Bell, Jr.,
and a brief summary of the information contained within these
files appears below:
a.
Gordon Dwane Novel, SF#526 113
Mr. Novel has a long history of leaving the
impression that he is either employed by or asso-
ciated with the CIA. Mr. Novel has not, however,
ever been an employee of the Agency in any capacity..
The Office of Security file on Mr. Novel was
established in 1967 by virtue of his involvement
with the Garrison investigation of the assassination
of President Kennedy. During the ensuing period
Mr. Novel has both telephoned and written to the

been followed-up by the Agency. Most recently,
Mr. Novel was in contact with the Domestic Collec-
tion Division (DCD) in New Orleans, Louisiana,
in October 1975 and February 1976 to volunteer
various proposals. Mr. Novel's proposals were
rejected by DCD, and Mr. Novel was requested to
