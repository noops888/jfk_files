EMBASSY UNDERSTOOD THAT LEGISLATIVE MANDATE FOR ARRB HAD

EXPIRED IN FALL 1997, SO DID NOT FOLLOWUP FURTHER.

HOWEVER, MANDATE

WAS APPARENTLY EXTENDED TO FALL 1998, AND ARRB'S INTEREST IN BKGB

INFORMATION HAS BEEN REACTIVATED.

ARRB TEAM MAY WISH TO COME TO

MINSK TO TRY AGAIN TO OBTAIN THESE RECORDS FROM BKGB, OR AT LEAST GET

EMBASSY TO REVITALIZE EFFORTS TO DO SO.

FOR THE RECORD< (AND HOS TRACES)',

, AT THE TIME OF THE ARRB'S

OCT 1996 MEETINGS WITH BKGB, ARRB MET PRINCIPLY WITH THE FOLLOWING

BKGB OFFICIALS:

-- ALEKSANDR ((VERAS) ), HEAD OF SECTION (NFI)

-- LEV ( (PIMENAU) ), HEAD OF SECTION (NFI)

-- ALEKSANDR ((ABLAMEIKA)), PUBLIC RELATIONS DEPT.

AT SOME POINT DURING MEETINGS THEY WERE JOINED BY :

-- GENNADIY ( (NARKEVICH) ) (PHONETIC), A DEPUTY

CHAIRMAN, BKGB.

(THIS IS ALMOST CERTAINLY

IDEN.)

REQUEST HQS TRACES ON FOUR BKGB OFFICERS ABOVE .

COMPLICATING ALL THIS IS FACT THAT AT SOME POINT, AUTHOR

NORMAN MAILER (APPARENTLY WITH EMBASSY ACCESS ASSISTANCE) WAS GIVEN

ACCESS TO. (SOME/ALL? OF) THE BKGB'S OSWALD RECORDS, WHICH MAILER

REFERS TO EXTENSIVELY IN HIS BOOK "OSWALD'S_TALE: AN AMERICAN

MYSTERY," PUBLISHED-IN 1995.

CAFTER THE FACT,

PER_POLECON_OFFICER,

BKGB REALIZED THAT MAILER MADE SUBSTANTIAL PROFITS FROM THIS BOOK,

AND THAT THE BKGB. HAD GOTTEN NOTHING FOR PROVIDING ACCESS-TO-THEIR /

RECORDS, THUS THEY REPORTEDLY FELT

_ THEY HAD BEEN CHEATED:

BALL IS NOW IN STATE'S COURT, BUT THEY AND EMBASSY EXPECT

THAT_REQUEST WILL BE FORTHCOMING FROM ARRB IN NEAR FUTURE, AND THENCE

TO STATION, IO FACILITATE MEETINGS WITH BKGB ON THIS MATTER. TO BE

BIT AHEAD OF THE CURVE, REQUEST HOS GUIDANCE AND AUTHORIZATION AS

APPROPRIATE.
