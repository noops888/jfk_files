sokhers.
2. The DC publish a similiar leaflet aimed at prospective drafters which includes a
section en ways of getting out of the draft, andC. O. information etc.
3. One of the major themes of the 15-16 demonstration will be a position by the VDO
urging solders and potential inductees to individually and collectively oppose the war.
4. The the VDC, through its publicity. and through at least one public speaker make it
clear that at the O. A. T. we will go beyond merely stating that we urge soldiers and
potential inductees to oppose the war, but that we shall lausch an active campaign of
attempting to communicate with soldiers and potential inductees, trying to inform
them of the criminal nature of the war and the reasons why we urge theni to oppose it.
5.. That the VDC publically inform intellectuals, liberals etc. that we are urging soldiers
to copose the war, why we are doing so, and urging them also to oppose the war by
refusing to parcipate in government programs, rejecting government research
grants, etc.
6. It is under stood that the alive program does not rule out stressing other major themes
on the 15-16, or of launching other programs on that day.

:
You may soon be sent to Vietnam. You have heard about the war in the news; your
officers will give you pep talks about it. But you probably feel as confused and uncertain
about it as most Americans do. Many people will tell you to just follow orders and leave
the thinking to others. But you have the right to know as much about this war as anyone
else. After all, it's you---not your congressman---who might get killed.
WHY ARE WE FIGHTING IN VIETNAM ?
We are supposed to be fighting to protect democracy in Vietnam, and yet our own
government admits that South Vietnam is a dictatorship. General Ky, the latest military
dictator, is as bad as they come. Insert here quote about Ky admiring Hitler etc.
General Ky doesn't mean much to us; we're not even sure how to pronounce his name.
But the South Vietnamese have lived under him and men like him for ten years. As far
as they are concerned, we are fighting on the side of Hitlerism; and they hope we lose.
WHO IS THE ENEMY ?
U. S. military spokesmen have often said that their greatest problem is finding the
enemy. "The enemy" they say, "is everywhere." The old woman feeding her chickens
may have a stock of hand grenades in her hut. The little boy who trails after the America
soldiers during the day slips out to give information to the guerillas at night. The
washerwoman at the American air base brings a bomb to work one day. "It is impossible
says the military. "to tell who is the Viet Cong and who is the people."
And so, because the whole Vietnamese people seems to be the enemy, the military
is taking no chances. They use tear gas---a weapon only used against civilian populations
never against soldiers. They order American troops to fire at women and children---
because women and children, after all, are firing at American troops. American fighter
planes destroy civilian villages with napalm; American B52s are flattening whole regions.
That is why the war in Vietnam is so often called a "dirty war."
When the South Vietnamese people see you in your foreign uniform, they will think of
you as their enemy. You are the ones bombing their towns. They don't know whether
yor're a draftee or a volunteer, whether you're for the war or against it; but they're not
taking any chances either.
FREE ELECTIONS
The Vietnamese would dearly like to vote the foreigners out of their country, but
they have never had the chance. According to the Geneva Agreement of 1954, there were
supposed to be elections throughout Vietnam in 1956, But the U.S. government was
afraid that our man in Vietnam, Premier Diem, would lose. In fact, President Eisenw
himself admitted that "Ho Chi Minh....80%" (Eisenhower quote). So we decided not to
allown any election there until we were sure we could win. Diem set up a political police

force and put all political opp. tion---Communist and anti-C munist---in jail. My 1959
it was clear that there weren't going to be any elections, and the guerillas known as the
Viet Cong began to fight back. By 1963 our government was fed up with Diem, but still
wasn't willing to risk elections. Our CLA helped a group of Vietnamese generals to over-
throw Diem and kill him. Since then there have been a series of "better" military
dictators. General Ky---the man who admires Hitler---is the latest one.
FIGHTING FOR DEMOCRACY
Win
Your job as a soldier is supposed to be "to win the people of South Vietnam."
them to what? Not democracy. We keep democracy for ourselves---they get, military
dictators. What then? The American way of life ? But why should they care my more
about that than we care about the Vietnamese way of life? We can't speak their language
or even pronounce their names. We don't know anything about their religion or even what
it is. We never even heard of Vietnam until Washington decided to run it.
You are supposed to be fighting to "save the Vietnamese people from Communism."
Certainly Communist influence is very strong in the National Liberation Front, the rebel
government. Yet most of the people support the NLF. Why? Many of the same people
who now lead the NLF led the Vietnamese independence movement against the Japanese
during World War II and then went on to fight against French colonial rule. Most Vietnames
think of the NLF leaders as their country's outstanding patriots. In fact, many anti-
Communists have joined the guerilla forces in the belief that the most important thing is
to get rid of foreign domination and military dictators. On the other hand, very few
Vietnamese support the official government of General Ky. His army has low morale and
a high desertion rate.
THE TOUGH GUERILLAS
The newspapers and television have told us again and agian what a brave, tough fighter
the Vietnamese guerilla is. Short of ammunition and without any air cover, he can beat
forces that outnumber him five or ten to one. Why do they have such high morale? They
are not draftees; no draftees ever fight like that. They are not high-paid, professional
soldiers; most of them are peasants who work their fields. They are not well-trained;
they can't even spare the ammunition for target practice.
Their secret is that they know why they are fighting. They didn't hear about Vietnam
in the newspapers; they've lived there all their lives. While we were in high school,
they were living under the Diem regime and hating it. Now American planes are bombing
their towns and strafing their fields; American troops have occupied their country; and if
they complain out loud, an American-supported dictator sentences them to jail or the
firing squad. Is it any wonder that they fight so fiercely?
CRUSHING THE RESISTANCE
The war in Vietnam is not being fought according to the rules. Civilians are gassed.
Prisoners are tortured. Our planes drop incendiary bombs on civilian villages. Our
soldiers shoot at women and children. Your officers will tell you that it is all necessary,
that we couldn't win the war any other way. And they are right. Americans are no more
cruel than any other people; American soldiers don't enjoy this kind of war. But if you
are going to wage war against an entire people, you have to become cruel. The ordinary
German soldier in occupied Europe wasn't especially cruel, either. But as the resistance
movements grew, he became cruel. He shot at women and children because they were
shooting at him; he never asked himself why they were shooting at him. When a certain
town became a center of resistance activity, he followed his orders and destroyed the

whole town. He knew that SS men were torturing captured resistance fighters, but it
wasn't his business to interfere.
FOLLOWING ORDERS
1
As a soldier you have been trained to obey orders, but as a human being you must
take responsibility for your own acts. International and American law recognize that
an individual soldier, even if acting under orders, must bear final legal and moral re-
sponsibility for what he does. This principle became a part of law after World War II,
when the Allied nations, meeting in London, decided that German war criminals must
be punished even if they committed war crimes under orders. This principle was the
basis of the Nuremberg trials. We believe that the entire war in Vietnam is criminal
and immoral. We believe that the atrocities which are necessary to wage this war
against the people of Vietnam are inexcusable.
OPPOSE THE WAR
We hope that you too find yourself, as a human being, unable to tolerate this night-
ma: war-we hope that you will oppose it. We don't know what kind of risks we are
taking in giving you this leaflet; you won't know what risk you will be taking in opposing.
the war. Several GIs have already refused to fight in Vietnam and have been court-
martialed. They have shown great courage. We believe that they, together with other
courageous men who will join them, will have influence far out of proportion to their
numbers.
There may be many other things you can do; since you are in the service, you know
better than civilians what sorts of opposition are possible. But whatever you do, keep
your eyes open. Draw your own conclusions from the things you see, read and hear.
At orientations sessions, don't be afraid to ask questions, and if you're not
satisfied with the answer, keep asking. Take every chance you get to talk to your fellow
soldiers about the war. Demand to hear civilian speakers who oppose the war debate
military spokesmen.
You may feel the war is wrong, and still decide not to face a courtmartial. You may
then find yourself in Vietnam under orders. You will have to do some fighting-but don't
do any more than you have to. Good luck.
