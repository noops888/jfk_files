They flatly denied the rumors that at the beginning of 1964 they will renew

intrigues against us at the session (article 19 which deals with the loss of

vote) on the question of payments for the Congo operations and UN forces in

the Near East (see our Nr. 478)Âª.

From the constant emphasis that the new administration in Washington

will

concentrate on internal matters and that it needs time before it will be

capable of conducting an active foreign policy, we surmise that they fear

pressure from our side.
