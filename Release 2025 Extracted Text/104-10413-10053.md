The company Telefonos de Mexico, S.A.,

has subroontracted this work of cloaning up and reorganizing the phone

system to the independent firm, Intel.

They are cleaning up unused and

old Ines, putting in new and spare lines, redefining exchange areas,

Laying underground cables, oto.

Eventually we should be better off be-

aslise. there should be more surplus lines. The renovation work has

hampered much of the LIFEAT work, principally because many of the lines

now are underground and ve carnot get access. to them before they enter

tho: cantral..

This is particularly trun with respect to the Czech Em-

basay, to whose telephone linea we cannot obtain access from the vantage

point we nan occupy.

WILSTED said that we try to keep track of the activities of

"Intel" but since they seem to attack "Colonias" at mindom, we have no

prior warning of their presenca in a certain area.

Lo In the recent past, lexico has been using houses for listing

posts for security reasons.

ile have more control over the access of

phone company inspectors of repnirman to houses. llowever, under new

regulations, all now apartment bulldings must have telephone lines In-

atalled in the building by the phone company during the construction

This means that the lines and their destination are concealed.

HILSTED proposed that this will mean we can again use apartments since

we can siphon off a line destined for use by another tenant in such a

way that the phone company cannot trace its destination without tearing

the building apart and me can then install a sevarate Iine to the butld-

Ing and hook up the subscriber to this line which, if checked, will

belong to a legitimate subscribor.

50. One system which has been used effectively is to take one-half

of two separate pairs which have one faulty line each. These two huilf

pairs then for one rood pair which we can use.

WIISTEN explained that It cost about 3000 posos to get a

rogular telophone. This entails the purchase of a telephone company

bond, which later can be sold.
