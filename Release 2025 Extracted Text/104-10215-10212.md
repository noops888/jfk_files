Subject is President or Director of the

Neuroplysiology institule (formerly Higher Nervous

!

Activity Instilute), Acadeny of Seichees: subsource

thinks that Subject is also Professor of

Redical

Psychology at Havana University.

Subject is a very

well trained psychiatrist and has aluays enjoyed

great prestige as such; nevertheless, he has always

been reputed to have very low morals, and in medical

circles is "famous" as a woman chaser.

He is widely

reputed

to attempt to seduce his female patients and

his colleagues' wives.

Major Bernabe

ORDAZ

Director or Havana Psychiatric Hospital, consider's

Subject to be a vulgar political schemer utterly

lacking in personal prestige among Cuban "new"

Communists; Ordaz has stated that he considers that

Subject wants to control Cuban psychiatric practice

for his an personal benefit.

When Castro took power,

Subject surprisingly

abandoned the Immediate Action

party

and joined the recently organized Revolutionary Medical

Party; Ordaz did not join this party until 1960.

In medical circles,

Subject is reputed to collaborate

with the DSE in brain-washing activities, but subsource

had never seen any direct indications of

collaboration.

2. The information below was acquired through fe

interrogation of CC-4033,

Dr. Hector WILTL lancis, a

refugee

and former resident

Cuban

of Nuevo Vedado, Inbana,

who left

Cuba

on 19 March 1969 and has been a professional colleague

of Subject for many years.

i:2a

a.

Dr. Jose *BUSTAMENTE O'Leary, psychiatrist,

was brought up by his aunts; he does

not know the

identity of his mother.

He, together with Raul Roa,

Justo Carrillo, and others,

comes from the ranks of

the left wing of the student movement: he joined the

Communist Party of Cuba in 1938 and, in 1914, supported

presidential candidate Dr. Carlos Saladrigas in the

presidential elections held that year.

When Dr. Gran

ras elected President, Subject concentrated on his

professional activities,

earning considerable pres-

tige and acquiring a good practice, while maintaining

his political relationships with senators, colonos,

etc.

In 1952, the year

of the coup d'etat, Dr. Bustamente

had

such friendly relations with both presidential

candidates that, if the general elections scheduled

for June 1952 had been held,

subject would have been

made (a) Vice-Minister of Foreign Relations if Dr. Agramonte

had been clected, and (b) Minister without cartera

(portfolio) if Dr. Hevia had been electer.

b.

Niter the, 10 March 1952 coup d'etat,

Subject opposed the de facto government

split ui. nis close relations with Dr. JORALES

del Castillo, who offered Subject the post of

Consulting Counsellor (Consejero Consultivo)

which post Subject rejected.

Subject began to

conspire

against the regine with Justo Carrillo

and Di. Araujo, constituting the orgavization

called the Montecristi Group.

Subject continues

to maintain a close relationship with Di. Araujo:

now President of the Cuban Medical College,

Professor of the School of Medical Sciences of

Havana University, and functionary of the Higher

Nervous Activity Research Institute.

After the 1 January 1959 Revolution,

Subject hastened to exploit the Communist con-

tent. of the Revolution

and participated directly

in the denunciation of Dr. Urrutia.

One of

Urrutia's

assistants was Subject's patient and

informed Subject of events occurring within the

Presidential Palace.

Subject then consulted with

Raul Castro and denounced Dr. Urrutia as anti-

Communist.

d. Subject is very intelligent, very com-

petent, and an extraordinarily hard orker.

He

is Professor of Psychology at the Mavana University

dedical school, and Director of the Higher Nervous

Activity Research Institute.

During the decade

1950-60,

he held a high post within the Cuban

Medical

College and was President of the World

Medical Group; during this decade he made many

visits to the USA on matters related to his pro-

fessional activities.

e.

It has been commented that Subject performed

"brain

washing" activities for the Havana DSE.

During the period in 1966 that subsource was held

prisoner at Villa Marista, he did not sec Subject;

subsource has never heard

anyone

state that he

actually saw Subject at Villa Marista. In subsource's

opinion, if Subject has ever worked for the MININT,

it was probably as professor of psychology in classes

given to MININT personnel; subsource presumes that

the classes would have been similar to those that

Subject gave to Cuban artists.

f.

In 1956, Subject acquired an extraordinarily

beautiful mistress that he still continues to visit

and

support.

This mistress, Manolita Canto, was

devoted red bushed band surprised su get ande

Canto in a hotel room in Miami, Florida;

subsequently,

U.S. immigration authorities prohibited Subject from

entering the U.s.r.

Canto had. had one son by her

husband; when her husband died, the son inherited

the father's wealth, which was

considerable.

The

lars against private property promulgated by the

Castro regine undermined Canto's economic position

to the point that she has had. to go to work; she now

works at the INIT (National Tourist Industry Institute),

located at 23 and L Streets, Vedado, Hasana City.

which salary amounts to 800 Cuban pesos; this salar

is insufficient to permit subject to maintain his

own home and his mistress's separate home and to lead

the type of life to which he was accustomed.

B.

Subject is described

as lacking in normal

affections, cold and calculating, a typical schizoid

interested

only in himself, never makes. a friendly

gesture, has almost no friends.

Subject is generally

disliked and has many enemies who feel real hate towards

him. The young Revolutionary

medical doctors refuse

to have anything to do with him.

Fidel Castro does

not know who Subject is and has certainly never been

treated by Subject or received psychiatric treatment

from

any other psychiatrist.

Subject must be very un-.

happy and downcast at his present situation:

income is insufficient forhis normal mode of life;

he no longer travels extensively abroad (formerly,

he traveled abroad every three months; he holds no

representative office: he is not politically or socially

prominent and, indeed,

no one pays him the slightest

attention.

Subsource

states categorically that he

believes

that "Dr. Bustamente would be willing to

accept any offer. He would take the bait if given

half a chance."

The trip that Subject made to the USSR in

the early 1960's was a "pleasure trip."

(Summary:

The National Center for Scientific Research

(CNIC) 15 an autonomous

organization controlled by the Office

of the Prime Minister, who appointed the Director, Dr. Wilfredo

Torres, M.D., and other important executives.

The CNIC exists

basically to perform scientific research and to train porsonnel

for employment as (a) CNIC researchers, (b) rescarchers for the

National Research Institutes that collaborate with the CNIC,

(e) medical

(e) and researchers and workers in the pure sciences.

school faculty members, (d) industria: serente evic

has departments of Biochemistry, Ultracentrifugation, Electronic

and. 310-

microscopy, Medical Botany, Microbidogy and Virology, training

mechanics

and Biomedical Studies.

The CNIC graduate

program for medical doctors confers the degree of Luctor of

Basic Sciences upon completion of the three-year 1. gram;

in

the future,

the CNIC will also

graduate Doctors of Pure Science:

The National Research Institutes, of which there are at least

are organized by medical specialties and work in coordination

with the CNIC but are subordinate to the MINSAP. All are

clinical research institutes that work primarily with patients.

These institutes include the Institutes of Endocrinology,

Nephrology, Hematology, Gastroenterology, Neurology and Neuro-

surgery, Physiopathology, Psychology and Neurophysiology,

Hygiene

and Epidemiology, Cardiology and Cardiovascular Surgery;

Microbiology and Virology, Angiology, and Parasitology.)

The National Center for Scientific Research (Centro

Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas, CNIC) is located in

Reparto Siboncy (formerly Country Club), Marianao, Havana Pro-

vince, next to the Victoria de Giron premedical school (formerly

colegio Sagrado Corazon), and occupies several impressive ncw

buildings: in addition, large private homes in the area have

been equippod as laboratories

and residences for CNIC personnel.

As of mid-November 1967, some of the residences were

occupied by

foreign scientists.

The CNIC is an autonomous organization controlled by

the office of the prime Minister, through which its funds are

budgeted.

Important matters concerning the CNIC are handled

personally by Fidel Castro, whose approval is required for

foreign exchange expenditures such as the purchase of equipment.

contracting of foreign personnel, trips abroad by CNIC per-

sonnel, and recruiting campaigns

aimed at foreign scientists.

Fidel

Castro, rather than ex-Minister bachado Ventura, appointed

the director and other important CNIC executives.

Dr. Wilfredo

Torres, M.D., hematologist, is CNIC director.

The Public Healtl

Alinistry (MINSAP) plays no part in the supervision of the CNIC

and cannot influence the decisions of its executives.

The organization and functions of the CNIC are con-

fidential although not secret, and any person who has contact.

with medical professors can acquire some information on the

CNIC.

Since about June 1967, an ID card issued by the CNIC to

Its employces

1s required to

enter the CNIC buildings and the

private homes that have been equipped as laboratories and resi-

dences.

5.

CNIC activitles are oriented towards three

fundamental

objectives, namely:

Scientific research related to the medical sciences.

bo

The preparation of highly qualified research and

professorial personnel for employment,

after gradu-

ation, as (1) CNIC researchers, (2) researchers of

(3) members of the faculty of the three Cuban medical

schools (referred to as schools of medical sciences)

located in Havana City, Santa Clara, and Santiago de

cuba, and (4) biochemists and microbidogasts in indus-

tries rolated to tie medical sciences, such as the

pharnaceutical industry.

c.

The preparation of personnel for. work in the pure

sciences; this thiid objective constitutes a more

ambitious but long-range goal

that was still: in the

organizational and planning stage in January

68.

Part

of the personnel so trained would remain nt the Center

ns CNIC researchers; part would join the faculties of

tie university schools of pure sciences,

and: part would

enter Cuban industry to work on the applications ur

technology to production.

Scientific Research

6. Scientific research related to the medical sciences

is done at both the CNIC and at the National Research Institutes.

The general directives for such research are oriented tovards:

2.

The experimental verification of conclusions arthus work

or discoveries made, by foreign scientists.

of verification is effected (1)

principall"

in order

to train Cuban personnel in the methods of higher re

search, but also (2) as an attempt to contribute in-

formation complementary to the discovery.

b.

Original research work done by Cuban personnel adrased

by foreign scientists.

This work is directed tosards

(1) the attainment of

results of international

tance to be used in propaganda pradsing Castro depor-

education system, and (2) the achievement of discoveries

"In applied science that would serve either as an econ-

omic

saving or to earn foreign exchange.

As of rid-

January 68, CNIC research projects had produced nothing

of scientific importance.

During the first half of 67,

Fidel Castro ordered the CNIC. to orient all its re-

search projects towards production technology so that

-

the foreign exchange invested in the projects could be

partially recovered through improved production.

7.

Department of Biochemistry. The most important of the

CNIC departments is the Department of Biochemistry; it occupies

several new buildings and former private homes.

It is headed by

This department was

conducting research on polarinetry,

enzymology, spectograply,

and the synthesis of a steroid hormone from stigmasterol, a

sugar-cane by product.

As of mid-January 1968, all attempts to synthesize a

steroid hormone from stigmasterol had failed and will almost

surely continue to fail because stigmasterol is in inert

steroid lacking in biological activity.

Dr. Carlos J. Finlay, M.D., was preparing a resci.cl

thesis for the degree

of Doctor of Basic Sciences; his rescarch

project,

the biochemistry of lipides in cardiovascular diseases,

is of scientific interest although not

a separate department,

logical substance.

11.

Department oi Electronie Microscopy.

This department. was

functioning in November

7967 and contained two election micro-

scopes of the lighest quality, one Polish-made and the other

believed to be Japanese.

It was performing research in cytology.

ultrastructuie (tic :ltronicroscopic structure of tissues of

living beings), crystallography,

and the three-dimensional

-

spatial structure of certain biological substances.

12. DEpartment of Medical Botany. This department is headed

by a very intelligent and cultured Spanish agronist named

Guillermo Cid who has been in Cuba since 1940.

It is cifecting

a systematic study of Cuban flora in order to deterrine the

pharmacological and therapeutical properties of Cuban plants.

The department works in coordination with the experimental

station in Santiago de las Vegas that is directed by the chinent

92-year old Di. Juan Tomas Roig Mesa, who is the greatest Cuban

expert

on Cuban and tropical Tlora and one of the greatest

authorities in the world on medicinal plants.

In addition, the

department has the cooperation.of all the experimental agion-

omical stations in Cuba, which send the department samples of

any plant considered worth investigation;

the department con-

ducts an

exhaustive analysis of such samples.

The research has

two objectives:

8..

The utilization of the curative properties of the

plants, which constitute a cheap supply of national

raw materials and can replace many imported pro-

ducts.

b. The launching on the world market of competitive

pharmaceutical products,

following the example

of Red China and Bulgaria.

The work of the Department of Medical Botony will pro-

bably be successful because of (a) the qualifications and com-

petence of its director, Guillermo Cid, (b) the extraordinary

impulse that has been imparted to its research program, and

(c) the extraordinary richness of Cuban flora in medicinal plants

Department of Microbidogy and Virology. This depart-

very well equipped and manned.

It has Ultracentrifuges

and isolated installations for virus cultures, and installations

for experimental

animals.

15.

Biomechanics and Biomedical Studies.

Biomechanics is

the study of the biological activity of living organisms from

the point of view of the physicochemical laws that govern them.

As of September 1966, a department that would do research

on bio-

mechanics was being organized within the CNIC.

The Cuban Govern-

ment is aware of the enormous medical importance of the appli-

cation of cybernetics (problem solving by electronic computers)

to the analysis, organization, and resolution of the very complex

physicochemical problems that

the biology of living beings pre-

sents; the Government is attempting to organize. this department,

which will train highly qualified personnel and import clectronic

computers (a) for the study of the complex. physicochemical pro-

blems relnted principally to hematology, neurophysiology, and

cardiology and cardiovascular surgery, and (b) for the computa-

tion for public health purposes of. the vast anounts of publ-ic.-

health data of different types that the MINSAP regiond organi-

zations would provide.

The research projects of this department were to be

directed fundamentally towards the study and electronic compu-

tation of the

equilibrium of the blood, and were to include the study of the

variations in the biological parameters from

the biochemical

and hemodynamic point of view during cardiovascular surgery

and in physiological research related to the cardiovascular ap-

paratus.

In ncurophysiology. and neuropharmacology,. the re-

search projects would be oriented towards research

on higher

nervous activity including electrical modifications produced

in higher nervous activity; in hematology, the projects would

be oriented towards the study of isoimmunization and patho-

logical alterations of the different blood cells.

The electron-

ic computers would be needed to process the immense quantities

of data such research would produce.

an electrical engineer,

is reputed to be very intelligent, a gifted organizer, highly

motivated, and by far the best man available in Cuba for the

type of research described; he has more than 20 years ex-

perience in electromedical instruments.

18. Reduced Number of Research Projects.

The scarcity

of research projects can easily be

explained by the fact that

Cuba, which has no considerable scientific tradition,

first train personnel in the higher methods of scientific

research, and such training requires years of effort.

persons prepared to do important research are at the present

time occupied in the administrative and pedagogical organization

of the CNIC and cannot work full-time as researchers.

19.

In 1960, Dr. Jose Antonio

Padron, an eminent research scientist,

began work on the isola-

tion and culture of antibiotic substances, the study of theii

properties, and experimentation with said

substances; he ini

tiated this work at the Oncological Hospital but is now a CNIC

collaborator.

As of December 1967; he had isolated and exhaus-

tively studied 89 new antibiotics,

many of which are too toxic.

for human use. His work demonstrates his great ability and

perserverance, and with the material resources of the CNIC at

his disposal, should result in discoveries of scientific im-

portance.

CNIC Training Program

20.

Doctor of Basic Sciences.

The CNIC offers a three-

year training program Teading

to the degree of Doctor of Basic

Sciences for which program fifth-year medical students with

exceptional academic standing can qualify if (a) during their

college career they have shown special aptitudes for teaching

and research, (b) the UJC gives them an "A" grade in political

standing or reliability, and (c) they

are cleared by a DSE

investigation.

In 1966,

of the students then in the fifth

ycar

of medical school, only six were accepted by this trainag

program; all were excellent students and UJC members and are

now medical doctors:

Ramon Ortiz, Rosa Elena Simeon, Ismael

Claik Arce, Hilda Donderis, Julio

Rovriguez Docal, and his

wife daira

(Inu).

As of April 1968, probably no nore than 30

students were studying in this training program, chiefly be-

cause of the rigorous entrance requirements.

During the first year of the three-year program, the

students, i!l

of thon are

medical doctois,

study (a) nathe-

natics: mathematical analysis (higher algebra), analytical

scoretry, and tripononetry; (U) physics: nechanics (kinematics,

statics,

and dynamics), nechanics of liquids and gases, and

heat; (c) chemistry;inorganic and organic; (d) languages

inosier, Gibbish, Prench, or German); dialectical and histori-

cal naterialism; and logic of science.

The classes occupy

both mornings and afternoons and include seminars given by

the prole: sors; under a rotation system, the students also

give seminars

in which each by turn first lectures con presides

over

the ensuins debate.

lu addition,

the student: review the

bibliography. of subjects related to medicine, such is studies

on biochenistry, pharmacology, etc.

22.

During the second year of the three-year program,

the studenis

continue to study the pure sciences: mathematics

infinitesimal analysis), physics (optics and electronagnetism),

and organic chemistry, plus dialectical and historical naterial-

Ism, langunges, and a

specific medical speciality selected by

che individual

student.

In addition, the students serve as

instructors of biochemistry, physiology, etc., at the Victoria

de Giron premedical school.

23.

each student (a) continues to

serve as an irstructor at the Victoria de Giron premedical

school,

(b) continues to study in his own specialty, such as

biochemistry, neurophysiology, electronic microscopy, genetics,

virology, etc., (c) undertakes an original research project

under the guidánce of a professor who is usually a foreigne it,

writes a thesis hased on the research project, presents

and defends it before a tribunal, and (e) completes an examina-

tion in the specialty he has chosen.

If the thesis is approved

and the student passes the examination in his specialty, he

receives the title of Doctor of Basic Scicices and either becomes

a'member of the faculty of one of the three Cuban medical

schools (Paragraph 5.b.above) or stays on at the CNIC as a

research assistant.

During the first year,

students receive 225 Cuban

pesos monthly.

During the second year they receive 250 pesos

monthly, and during the third year they receive 300 pesos

monthly.

In addition, the students receive a free lunch and

supper daily.

In late 1968, the CNIC w1ll graduate its first two

Doctors of Basic Sciences:

both will remain at the CNIC after graduation and do research

in biochemistry.

26.

Doctor of Pure Sciences. Candidates for the CNIC

training program Teading to the degree of Doctor of Pure

Sciences must satisfy requirements similar to those described

in paragraph 20 above:

candidates must be outstanding students

in one of the pure sciences (chemical, physical,

nathematical,

or biological sciences) who, throughout their entire college

career have deronstrated special aptitudes for teaching

and

scientific research, and no are Communist sympathizers approved

by the UJC.

As of Septeaber 1967, students from Las Villas,

Camaguey, and Oriente Provinces who desire to coter medical

school as first-jear students must matriculate at either

Santa Clara or Santiago de Cuba University; this measure was

put into effect. in order to reduce congestion at Havana Uni-

versity.

Naïlonal Rescarch Institutes

-

29.

The following National Research Instisutes, organized

by medical specialties, work in coordination with the CNIC but

are subordinate

to the MIN&1P.

All were organized as "insti-

tutes" during the first three

months of 1967, although sone had

been functioning for years under different names.

All are

clinical research institutes that work primarily with palients.

Each institute controls all the hospital departsents throughout

Cuba that correspond to the specialty of the institute.

For

example:

The Endocrinology Institute controls all the

hospital

departments of endocrinology in Cuba.

30.

Endocrinology

Institute. The Endocrinology Institute

replaced the tormer Institute for Endocrinological Research

that was founded and directed by Dr. Yamil Kouri.

The insti-

tute

is located at the same site as

the former institute: the

ground flour of the leit wing of the Fajardo Hospital, Havana

City.

It is headed by Dr. Oscar Nateo de Acosti, M.D., Cuba's

most eminent endocrinologist.

Dr. Mateo is extraordinarily

intelligent, a university professor and PCC member, and is one

of the scientific bulwarks of the Castro Regime.

Mateo's

assistants include Dr.. Catalina Eibenschuz, who is married lo

Dr. bora,

head of the CNIC Department of Biochemistry, and

was studying endocrincology in France in early €8; Dr. Bario-

lome Arce; who studied in Rumania and was studying in France.

in early 68; and a young medical doctor named Oriedo (Inu),

who was probably to be sent to Sweden to study.

The Endocrinology Institute enjoys a large budget

because of Dr. Mateo's scientific eminence and political

"virtues".

It has excellent equipment for electrophoresis,

ultracentrifuges, and photocolorimeters.

Nephrology Institute.

The Nephrology Institute is

located on the fifth floor of the Joaquin Albarran Clinical-

Surgical Hospital, Avenida 26 at Avenida Rancho Boyeros,

Havana.

It as headed by Dr. Abelardo Buch, M.D., an extraordinarily

abl, researcher who was working on:

8.

b.

c.

acute, chronic renal insufficiency,

microdeterminations of certain nornal quantities .

the renal apparatus, and

the experimental verification of modern theories

that explain the physiopathology of shock and its

treatment; his experiments were based on the research

• hypothesis of Dr. Richard Lillehel, chief of the-

Department. of Surgery, Minnesota. University.

late 1967; these artificial kidneys are for use in lreating

kidney discase rather than for medical research.

Hematology Institute.

The Hematology Institute

has

departments at the lilliar soler Hospital,

the Fajardo

Hospital, and the National Hospital, all located in Havana

City.

The institute has no building of its own and its

activities are located at-the three best hematological clinics

in Cuba, as enumerated abovr.

The Director of the Hematology

Institute i8 Dr. Eduardo de la Torre, who is

also chief of the

Department of llenatology, William Solex Hospital.

Dr. Ulacia

(fnu), who is probably Cuba's best hematologist,

is chief of

the Department of Hematology of the Fajardo Hospital.

36.

The most important research project of the Hematology

Institute was

initiated about july 66 and

consisted of the

study of the "atilization of isoniazida in the treatment of

Werholf's (as recrived) discase d purpura trombopenica idio-

patica." The value of isoniazida in the treatment of herholf's

disease was discovered by chance under the following circum-

stances:

A clild hospitalized in the hematological department

o1 the William Soler hospital for treatmint of Werholf's dis-

ease contracted a primary tuberculosis infection: when this

infection was treated with isoniazida. the symptom-complex of

Werholf's disease disäppeared completely and no relapse occur-

red::

As of January 1968, 22 such cases had been studied and the

conclusions

were being prepared for presentation at a Renato-

logical Congress; the biological mechanism of the treatnent had

not yet been determined, but it was considered that the experi-

mental stage had been completed.

37.•

Dr.

Eduardo de la Torre wäs performing research -

principally of a statistical nature - on leucemias.

Infantile

leucemia was being studied at the William Soler Hospital and

at the Angel Arturo Aballi Children's Hospital, located in

Arroyo Naranjo, liavana; this research followed

the treatment

scheme of Swelzer and

the University of California schene

known internationally as V.A.d.P.

38.

Gastroenterology Institute.

The Gastroenterology

Institute occupies the iwo-story building at the Calixto Garcia

Hospital which was formerly occupied by the hospital library.

Its Director is DI. Raimundo Llanio Navarro, who was brought

to world-wide eminence when he presented his study "Colangio-

grafia Laparoscopica en la Lactante" at the Brussels Congress

in 1965.

When the Gastroenterology Institute was officially

established in early 1967, it had been functioning for about

two years.

In January 1967, Dr. Humberto Rodriguez Hidalgo and

Dr. Mirna Quintero were admitted as residents;

their adnission

as residents coincided with the establishment at the institute.

Dear DI. Bustamante:

I have

recently coupleted a reading of your

paper entitled "Cultural Pactors in Hysterlas with

Schizophrenic Clinical Pictures." I found it to be

of great interest and I appreciate your sending it

to me. I have been working with Dr. Hillian Holf

on

the projection of medical education and paychiatry

as they are likely to be in the next century.

The

first of a serles of articles and of a monograph,

was published in the April 1966 iasue of the American

Journal of Psychotherapy,

This takes in e great deal

of analysis that would be included under transcultural

psychiatry.

Indeed, we are using the systems analysis

approach which, of course, must take into account the

broad psychosocial and socioeconomic forces thet in-

fluence the psychodynamics matrices in Iodividuals.

I am interested in the particular securities that are

precipitated in the ego structure of individuals by

the very nature of the socioecononic, sociopolitical

and

sociophilosophic system in which the individual

Lives... In an opposite vein, we are interested in the

stresses that are placed upon the individual by vari-

ous

social systens from individual and practical stand-

points.

Awarenesses such as these should be of belp

in the planning of social systems for underdeveloped

nations.

While this seems like a very amoitious con-

ceptualization, I do not believe that it 18 an unlikely

possibility. in

the coming generations.

I look forward to receive the copy of your

hello to his Cuban friend, uhich L-l did on 21 March.

During the ensuing

conversation, CUSTAMANTE mentioned that he attended the World Congress of

Psychology in the Soviet Unloo in August 1966.

He had prevlously visited

the

USSR in 1961, and found great charges 1a that country.

Ile felt that a

definite evolution had taken place betueea 1961 and 1966, brinzing life in

the Soviet Union several steps closer to that in the lestern countries. He

also found radical changes in the field of his professional specialty.

Psychlatric and psychological trends in the USSR, he felt, had broken anny,

from the rigid doctrines that limited their development until a few years

ago and had groun more liberal. Several specialists who had been ostracized

for psychiatric and psychological theorles contrary to those officiolly

accepted in the USSR. had been rehabilitated.

In the mornings, Dr. John gave a lecture on physiology. of

He has been working on

I think I should let you know that I have written to Dr. Do

Loigh,

Secretary to the Horld Psychiatric Association

and among other

things I indicated the convenience to create one Committee or Section

of Transcultural Psychiatry within the World Paychiatric Association

paychologists, psychiatrista, anthropologists, etc.) requiring more

than any other one the cooperation and help to lacilitate the

to keep producing and offering contributions in the development of

this field.

agistentes al misno que se dedican a la Psicologia Médica.

Yo recibí su citación con gran entusiasno pues creo que es necesario

ja que cada uno de dicho grupo tenemos nuestra propia opinión cono

Bon sin duda las tres opiniones que rigen en el mundo en esta nateria.

•Parte nos derraudo tanto a mi cono a seguin pues realizo

una reunion intrascendente y se puso en contacto con gente que no re-

presenta la Psicologia Medica en el mundo y por ejemplo, concretamen-

en relación al Perú, entro en contacto, no con Seguin que estaba

allí, sino con un muchacho que no se dedica a esta disciplina.

Esa es la razón por la cual le escribí esa carta haciéndole esas crí-

ticas y sugiriendole

que para tratar de esos problemas con nosotros

Istinoamericanos tenían fundamentalmente que entrar en contacto con-

tigo, con Seguín y conmigo pues creo fuera de toda falsa modestia que

the Caribbean Zone Dr. Leopoldo E. ARiUJO Pernal who 15 sani-

en donde desempeñó diversos cargog, pulo conocer ampliamente el desarrcllo

de la medicina en Cuba hasta el

30 de itril de 1967, es decir ha podido co-

nocer también el desenvolvimiento de la medicina cubana durante el régimon

castro-comunista. Siendo lo que a cortinuación expreso un enjuicianierto

del mismo en su triple aspecto docente, profesional y clasista.

Aspecto docente.

La Universidad de la Habana fué fundada en el año 1728 y fueron precisarente

los estudios médicos los primeros en ser organizados coro Facultado Si ol pa-

:sedo puode venegloriarse de haber sido cuna de dos nombres preclaros en ls Hia-

toria de la l'edicins, cono son Tomás EONAY, sabio introductor de la vacura er.

•Cuba y el DI. Oarlos J. FIFLAY, genial descubridor del agente transmisor de la

fiebre amarilla, En la época republicana adquirió justa fana por la celidad de

els profesores, la rígidez de sus planes de estudio y la brillantez de sus ga-

duados.

Pero no es el

comento de citar nobres que justifiquen tales esevera-

CiOnes. Besta decir tan solo que la Facultad de ledicina, preoisamente, estaba

clasificada coro A-l en el ranking de las facultades similares del mundo artero,

al igual que las mejores universidades de los Estados Unidos de América.

Con el advenimierto del régimen commista de Fidel CASTRO, comenzó la dasintagrar

ción de la Universidad de la Habana, para volverla a integrar, como una rueda rá

er.-le irmensa raquinaria comunista del Gobierno. Siendo precisamente :: raculiei

de lodioina la prinera en ser atacada, alegando diversos pretextos de indoie se-

cundaria, lo que trajo coro consecuencia la renuncia de la nejor parte de su pro-

Pesorado. Con la enigración de los médicos cubanos casi en mesa, que repudiaban

el régiren totalitario y tiránico que se instauraba en la Isla, agudizániose la

carencia de profesores en la Facultad de L'edicina.

Modo de resolver esta erare problema que se le creaba al rézinen de Casti.

En primer lugar roabralo profesores de "dado", es decir que nurica hicie.... min

guna prueba de cajacidad para adquirir sus cátedras, sino que deten ou nivlitniis.-

autoridades comunistes cubanas que dirigen la salua pública. En segundo lugar,

isportanio profesionales extranjeros de Faises Comunistas o Socialistas, o bien

de Países Denocráticos, pero que son militantes.

o simpatizantes ocultos de loa

pertidos comunistas loceles. Toios estos profesionales son habilitados inuodia-

tamento, incluso para ejercer la proresión médica, por un simple decrato recto-

ral.

AsÍ como un erámen imparcial de este proiesorado, nos pernite afiruar su baja

calidad, y por una razón muy sercilla; por ser todos con rarísimas excepciones

profesores improvisados, sin ninguna historia o experiencia médica-pedejósion.

•Y aquollos rarísimos, repetimos, que pueden poseer alguna, por haber sijo ante-

tiornente profesores de le facultad, no tienen la libertad de enseñanza propia

del caráctar liberal de le l'edicina, sino que están sujetos a la férrea discipli-

na colectiva propia de los sisteras marxistas-leninistas.

Del alumnado puede decirse sin exageración alguna, que es el nás malo en la largs

historia de la ya bi-centenaria Universidad de la Habana. Como lo qué se quiere

obtener es un tipo de sédico político, clego observante de las reglas comuristas

poco importa la preparsción sédica de los alumnos."' Si antiguamente se raquerian

T años de Escuela Primaria y 4 o 5 de Bachillerato, hoy cualquiera, con ui simple

•elanes, las mas de las veces suañado, puede hacer su ingreso en los estudios mé-

dicos sin haber cursado ningún tipo de preparación en la Primera o Segu da linger-

ñensa, lo que ai se exigo es una nilitancia activa dentro de l0s ouadros del Per-

tido Comunista Cutano, es decir, que no estudia en la Pacultad de ledicina, el que

quiere o tiene vocación por estos estudios, para ello hay que demostrar de un nodo

fohaciente la vinculación al réginen. Y ouando se tione sospecha de una tilla ad-

besión por cualquiera de los alumos, inmediatamente se celebra una "Aaaablea de

depuración", en la que 99 veces de cada 100 es expulsado aquel que tenga la liala

suerto de ser señalado por sus corpalleros, en defiritiva, que la clásicas cursa-

grada libertad de erseianca es un alto en el réginen comunista curano.

En algunas asignaturas no existen las pruebes de capacidad generalmente acep-

un

tadas por todas las universidades del mundo, es decir el exaren, bien de tipo

u otro. Pues en el alán de graduar médicos con el fin de poder reemplazar. inu-

tilmente a la grar, masa de profesionalea emigrados, las notas se dan por simple

asistencia a clases, hay que graduar médicos a toda costa, dicen loa dirigertes

comunistas y para que se vea hasta dorde llegan en este sentido, vaya la sizuler:

tA anécdota viviùa por el DI. BEATO, la cual refleja con exactitud está gran

preocupación de los jerarcas del régimen. Se trata de un antiguo al unno de la

época pre-comunista, que cuando CASTRO se apodera del poder, le faltaban pocas

esignaturas para graduarse de médico. Caro es un cubano denócrata, aprobó to-

das meros una, que no quiso examinar, para no coger el título de médico bajo el

réginen comunista, cosa que repugnaba a su conciencia, pero cuando los dirigante:

de su curso lo apremiaron para que se examirara, so pena de ser expulsado si no

lo hacía, no tuvo más remedio que hacerlo, pero buscó adrede el suspenso, con-

testando male

la casi totalidad del exámen, a pesar de esto, y de hacer malisi-

mamente el erámen, fué aprobado. He aquí la nueva versión del castro-counista,

de hacer médicos a palos.

En el plan de estudíos médicos, existe una asignatura "Marxisno" que es indis-

pensable para continuar la carrera. El alumo que no posea el aprobado en la

misma, jamás será médico, no importa que sea brillante en Patología o Terapéuti-

ca, Janás obtendrá el título mientras no se haga un alumno aventajado en esa

asignatura. Así que lo que se quiere obtener por el régimen es un tipo de sé-

dico político, que responda siempre a las orientaciones de la dirigencia conu-

nista y no a los cánones sagrados del clásico arte de curar.

Todas estas cosas han dado origen a un tipo especial de médico, que el pueblo

cubano le ha dado a la broma y lo conocen con la denominación genérica de "oin-

co picos", porque la prueba final, la gran prueba, la que 103 consagru anta lou

:ojos de los jerarcas comunistas es "la nubias durente circo vocua al Pico 'ur-

quino",. la mortaría nás alta de la Isla. Esto que parece escapado de la mon-

to de un alierado es lo que exige C-STRO, para que un médico se gradúe, no

importa que el alumno tenga una gran vocación por los estudios médicos, no

importa que haya demostrado su capacidad en la materia que son propias de la

ledicina, si no tiene

aptitudes de alpinista o no quiere bacer la gran esca-

lada, no se gradua y rio obtiene el título. Por estas razones, se podrá ot-

servar del teror casi sagrado con que son mirados estos médicos denominados

"cinco picos" por la población cubana, que con razón los desprocia y que jus-

tificadamente rebusa tenazmente todos sus servicios.

Aspecto Profesionals

¿"El ejercicio de la medicina es hoy una pesadilla para los médicos que tangan

Las medicinas son pocas y malas, el Ministerio de Salud Pública, envia a toios

los profesionales cada dos meses, una listica cada vez menguante, de 109 nadi-

camentos que pueden obtenerse y que contados por el entrevistado no pasan de

700 productos. El avance de la Terapéutica, que día a día está registrado par

la prensa médica mundial, no se conoce en Cuba, cuyos nédicos se ven obligados:

.a reoetar nedicinas ya en desuso en los países atanzados del orbe. Projucios

métodos de exploración radiológicas, cono son las coleciatografias y pie-

logratías, son nuy difíciles de hacer por la falta de los medios de cons

traste adeouados.

Las consultas privadas están llamadas a desapareoer en el régimen cocunista

según ya proclaran a todos l08 vientos, los jerarcas del gobierno y por una

razón muy sencilla; porque, las consideran centros de competencia a la redi-

cina oficial, pues todavía el nédico privado a pesar de todos los obstáculoa

se esfuerza en dar al paciente una medicina de calidad superior a la que es-

to encuentra en los Centros Hospitalarios y asistenciales del Réginen.

Aspecto clasista:

Los médicos cubanos, como clase habían llegado a una organización rodio an

su género, que fué copiada y sirvió para organizarse a muches instilucioned

similares de otros países, tal ora

el Colegio Médico Nacional (antizua rejo.

ración Médica de Cuba) que agrupaba bacie el año 1959 unos 7,000 médicos ou-

banos. Así cono bajo su actuación se obtuvieron una serie de conquistas la-

borales y un ansiado Retiro Médico para la hora del desoanso y de la vejez.

Había un Código de Horal Médica y funcionsba dentro del Colezlo, una serie de

¡Tibunales de Disciplina, que valaban por el estrioto cumplimiento réuico, es

decir agrupaciones con criterios disímiles en cuanto a la orientación de la

medicina cono clase, independientes de todo lo que significara militancia ao-

tiva dentro de la politica nacional.. La dirigencia colegial se elogía a tra-

vés de elecciones devócráticas, en las que participan todos los nédicos, re

partiendose los puestos ejecutivos de acuerdo con la representación proporcio-

nal de cada partido. Es decir que cono en toia organización denocrática, ha-

bia una mayoria que

gobernaba y uns minoría alerta y vigilante a cualquiar

transgresión de las leyes colegiales.

Todo esto ha despparecido desde el mes da Abril de lyoó, en que el régles de

Fidel CASTRO declaró disuelto el Colezio Lédico Nacional y extingulda todia:

un plumazo, todas nuestras reivindicaciones, muchas de las cuales estaban

regadas con la sangre y el sacrificio de muchos de nosotros. En, su lugar

existe hoy en día un réginen de trabajo esclavo, que no admite méritos y

capacidad en el orden profesional, sino una oioza obediencia a los princi-

pios barzista-Leninista. Habiéndome enterado por amigos colegas de 1s pro-

fesión, de que en el mes de Enero o Febrero de 1967, apareció en la escuala

actual de Medicina una lista completa de todos i0a médicos cubanos que han

tomado el Foroigi-Board en Florida, U.S.A. y bus correspondientes calificacio-

nos. Mesconociendo como una cosa tan privada ha sido posible de que se pudiet

se publicar'en Cuba, siendo las causas de que entre el sector médico, oxista

al recelo de hablar al ver que cosas confidenciales como son esos exémanea,

puedan ser publicadas en Cuba, por lo que se piensa en la infiltración conu-

nista dentro de dicho organiemo.

A mediados del mes de larzo de 1967, ouando me dirigía al Archito Hacional,

ol. cual se encuentra ubicado en la Calle de Compostela y San Isidro ar. la Ha-

bana, para realizar estudios de investigaciones históricas de la Vedicina Gu-

bana, adonde todos los días solía ir, pues en uno de esos días al salir de d1-

•cho Archivo Nacional y tratar de tonar la Ave. del Puerto para ir al british

Club, que se enouentra en Prado, pude observar de que dicha ave. estuvo inte-

rumplia al tránsito durante varios días, no recuordo días exacto, pero si sé

que un solo dia extremaron la vigilancia en el puerto, además de no parmitir

que se acercase nadio, logrando ver desde los muolles de la T'erminal del f'erry

Habana-Cayo Hueso y a una distanoia de unos 50 a 100 mts. camiones y rygtras

cargando objetos de toda clase de tamaños, éstos objatos eran de madera y pue-

por sor vista a ojo de aguila y a la distancia antes mencionada. También pu-

Dr. fernander-Conde suggests that Marla Lulsa's

attitude towards and

the latter's behavlour.

He also suggests that Marla Luisa, but not Jose, Sr..

Is vulnerable where thelr son, lose, Jr... Is concerned. LThe subject of sexual

aberrations came up several times during this Intervlew.. It seems appropriate

to point out hero that, according to Dr. Fernandez-Conde. there are many horo

sexuals among current Cuban governent officials and the possible exposuro as

states that homosexuality is glven no importance in Castro's Cubal

Dr. Bustamante's local arrest and detention on several
