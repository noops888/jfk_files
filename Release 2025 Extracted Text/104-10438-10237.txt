The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence
by Victor Marchetti and John D. Märks
1. Subject book was published in 1974 with 168
deleted items demanded by CIA and involved court
trial and decision. The lawyer for the authors has,
in effect, requested that a review be made of the
168 deleted items to determine which can now be
declassified and removed from the court's injunction,
particularly in view of the official disclosures
since the publication of the book. The Department of
Justice has advised that such a review is in order.
2. Since the courts decided the 168 deleted
items were properly classifiable and classified in
accordance with the appropriate Executive Order in
effect at the time of the initial classification,
including Executive Order 11652, the review at this
time must include two points:
(a) Is the item still classified under
Executive Order 11652,
(b) Has the item been placed in the public
domain by official disclosure by the United
States, such as by an official in the Executive
Branch authorized to declassify the item, or by
a report of a Congressional committee, or by
the courts.
3. Each addressee is requested to appoint a
focal point officer to review each component's
respective items which are held by this office.
This office also has the DDO documentation submitted
in support of deleting each item in 1973. These can
be reviewed by each focal point official as necessary.
A review will also be needed of those items which
may have been cleared or released by CIA when
reviewing manuscripts submitted by other authors
since the publication of the Marchetti book. A
few items will need to be referred by some of the
components to other departments and agencies of
government for their review.
4.
Please advise this office of the name of
your focal point officer by COB 11 April 1977.

SUBJECT: Review of Deletions from Marchetti Book for Declassification -
Request for Documents.
1. In order to review the deletions from the Marchetti book, The
Cult of Intelligence, Mr. Halpern must determine if any official of the
U.S. Government placed any of the classified material in the public
domain in open testimony before a Congressional Committee. The following
material or information is required:
a. Is there any index to public statements by senior government
officials on the subject of intelligence? Is there any index
to the Pike Committee or Church Committee testimony ?
b. Mr. Halpern would like to have copies of the open testimony
before a Congressional committee by senior officials of the
CIA,
NSA,
State Dept,
Dept of Defense,
FBI,
which deals with intelligence.
c. Any open testimony before Congressional committees by senior
U.S. officials dealing with the cutoff of AID during the
Cyprus disturbances.
d. Any testimony (open) concerning American POWS (MIA) in Vietnam
and CIA's method of communication with them.

Hussein on
Following the disclosure that Jordan's
King Hussein had for years taken secret
payments from the CIA. NEWSWEEK'S
Arnaud de Borchgrave flew to Amman
last week for an exclusive interview with
the King. The result was what Hussein
called "my first and very last words' on
The Washington Post's revelation of the
payments and their possible impact on
chances for peace in the Middle East.
Some excerpts:
i
DE BORCHGRAVE: How much truth is
there in the story that appeared in The Wash-
ington Post?
!
HUSSEIN: The whole thing is ridicu-
lous and insulting. But I am prepared to
answer questions about it.
Q. Your government spokesman said the
story was a combination of "fabrication and
distortion." What has been fabricated and
what has been distorted?
A. What was fabricated in the story was
everything about funds handed over per-
sonally for private benefit. When friend-
ly Arab countries extend aid, it has been
traditional for the checks to be made out
to the Head of State, which then are
deposited in the state budget account.
This is not an uncommon practice. All
assistance received by us is handled in
the same way. What is true is that for a
number of years, we have been offered
security and intelligence assistance,
which the government of Jordan accept-
ed gratefully.
As for the story that the CIA paid for
the protection of my children at school
in America, my request was made to the
State Department which kindly agreed
to ensure their security. Remember that
there have been many extremist plots
against me and my family and this was a
perfectly normal request. If Amy Carter
decided to come to school in Jordan,
we would, needless to say, be responsi-
ble for her security and would not be.
sending a bill to the U.S. Government
for an elementary courtesy and security
measure.
Q. How do you feel about President Carter
ordering the arrangement-code-named "No
Beef" stopped?
A. We had, I promise you, never heard
anything about all this before. If the
reference is to the assistance we have
been receiving for security and intelli-
gence, then I have not been advised
about its suspension, either officially or
unofficially.
Q. The Intelligence Oversight Board set up
in February 1976 reported to President Ford a
few months later that they regarded the pay-
ments as improper and he did nothing about
it. What do you feel was improper about those
payments?
A. What is à proper way to support a
friend and ally is strictly your business,

was totally unaware that this assistance
to Jordan had come into question last
-year. What is proper in some minds is
apparently improper in others. As far,
as I am concerned, anything I can get
for Jordan and my people is proper.
And five of your Presidents [Eisenhow-
er, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford
thought so, too.
Q. Since you say the assistance was proper
and just another form of U.S. aid, why, then,
the secrecy and method of payment?
A. If you mean the report that pay-
ments were made directly to the King
and for his [personal] benefit and with
political conditions and obligations, this

eled against us. It was hardly coinciden-
tal that these attacks were made as the
peace offensive was puking up steam
and on the very das that Secretary
Vance arrived in Amman. It is obvious
to me that those who wish to sabotage
the peace process-and help Israel stay
put in the occupied territories-are
even willing to engage in character
assassination of persons whose dearest
wish is for a just and durable peace.

LU RAINS
The dialogue [interfured by the Jorda-
nian civil war'in 1970, when the PLO
was driven out of Amman) has barely
begun. To what degree political action
can be coordinated an ong us is some-
thing we will be exploring over the next
few months. And they hole Arab posi-
tion on this problem vet to crystallize.
f
Q. Is it your impression that the PLO is now
ready to amend its basic charter and agree to
coexist peacefully with Israel in a West Bank-
Gaza state?
A. This is the decision they must face.
But it is equally important to know what
the Israeli position will be. Why should
the PLO take such a step milaterally?
There must be a degree of simultane-
ity-Israel recognizes a West Bank-Gaza
Palestinian state and the Palestinians
recognize Israel.
Q. Is it your intention to negotiate with the
PLO prior to Geneva a new organic link be-
tween a possible Palestinian state on the West
Bank and Jordan proper?
A. This has been suggested by many
leaders in the area as a possible con-
structive development and we certain-
ly plan to explore the possibilities.
But I must caution you against overopti-
mism. The resumption of the Geneva
conference by itself means nothing and
if it doesn't produce quick results
then there will be the danger of a
letdown, of the pendulum swinging
back and the extremists coming to the
fore again.
Q. How do you think the latest CIA story will
affect relations between Jordan and the Unit-
ed States?
A. Throughout all these years I have
been very proud of the growing strength
of the relationship with our American
friends. We identified with principles
your forefathers held dear. We built
our relations on the basis of mutual
respect, confidence and faith, and be-
yond that anything I did to cement
relations with the U.S. was based on a
deep conviction about our common ob-
jectives-stability, peace and progress
in the Middle East..
My duty is to develop my country, its
human resources, armed forces and secu-
rity and intelligence services, to face the
tremendous threats that lie ahead. The
road is strewn with mines to sabotage the
peace process. One has just exploded in
Washington. There will be others. But
bear in mind that Jordan is not unique in
receiving such help. Israel falls into the
same category and is a far greater exam-
ple of all kinds of assistance. As far as I
am concerned, these will be my first and
very last words on that matter. My per-
sonal pride is a very touchy subject. And
my main concern is to preserve Jordan in
freedom.
Finally, regarding your media attacks
against a branch of your government, if
you choose to denude a vital arm that is
there to protect you, that is your affair,
not Jordan's.

SUBJECT
: Fairways Corporation
1. Per our telephone conversation today, attorneys
for Victor Marchetti have requested release of the 168
items previously deleted by court order from the book,
The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence. Fairways Corpora-
tion was referred to CCS by the SA/DO/O for review in
this connection.
2. Fairways Corporation is the subject of four items
(107, 128, 129, 279, on pages 123, 132, 133, and 403 respec-
tively,) in the original manuscript. The position of CCS on
all four items is that they are still classified, since they
describe intelligence sources and methods by identifying an
operational support facility located in the U.S., and are
therefore exempt from declassification under Section 5(B) (2)
of the General Declassification Schedule contained in Executive
Order 11652.
3. According to CCS files, in April 1975 Director Colby
was asked by an NBC reporter about CIA sponsorship of Fair-
ways in connection with a planned TV documentary on Agency
proprietaries. CCS files are unclear on the point, but there
are indications that Director Colby may have responded to
the question in a manner which could have been construed as
admission of CIA sponsorship of Fairways. In any case, CCS
files contain other evidence that the matter was considered
to be still classified as recently as December 1976, when
Director Bush wrote to the Administrator of the Federal
Aviation Administration regarding CIA sponsorship of Fair-
ways and asked that the subject be withheld from public
disclosure.

4. Per our conversation, CCS has stated in its
response to the SA/DO/O that DDA would comment further
on the extent to which CIA sponsorship of Fairways may
have been placed in the public domain since the court
order (i.e., since February 1975).
5. Please direct your comments to SA/DO/O. For
your information, Mr. Halpern, Room 6 D 0120, red line
