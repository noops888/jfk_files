GS-15 in 1957. In 1959 he returned to Tokyo as Deputy for Operations and
as DCOS until 1964. He was promoted to GS-16 in August 1964. From
1964-1966 he served at Honolulu Base. In 1965 he was appointed COB,

Recommendation for Promotion
Robert P. Wheeler
1. As one of the final acts in my CIA career I want-
to bring to your attention and add my strong concurrenco
and recommendation to two (2) recorded recommendations for
the promotion of Robert P. Wheeler to the grade GS-17. I
find it hard to imagine a more persuasive recommendation
for this action than that forwarded by my predecessor in
June 1969 (Attached). I can imagine Mr. Mitchell's feeling
when he prepared the second recommendation in February 1970
(Attached). And yet, I find in February 1971 there has still
been no action. In the year that has passed this promotion
has becomo even more deserved, for despite the natural dis-
appointmont accompanying such a continuing lack of recogni-
tion, there has been no diminution of entliusiasm, no lowering
of standards, and the CS is clearly better managed because
of his continuing efforts. Were these two previous recommen-
dations not so clear cut and descriptive, I would conclude
that those in control simply do not know what this officer
does and has done. Knowing what he does and how he does it
should not continue to be unrewarded and, hence, I add my
strongest recommendation for early and favorable action..
2. This officer has performed in a most outstanding
manner, as testified in his fitness reports by my prede-
cessor, and certainly during my tenure as Chief, MPS for
the past 12 months.
