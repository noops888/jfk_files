MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

Subject: Response to Congressional Query

1. On 9 November 1978, G8 began a

search for material to answer an inquiry

by the House Assassinations Committee referred to us by NSA's Legislative Affairs

Office (LAO). An individual assigned to the USAFSS intercept station in Kirknewton,

Scotland (USA-55) in 1963 reportedly intercepted an ILC message containing informa-

tion relative to an assassination plot against President John F. Kennedy. He claims

he intercepted this message, but was not allowed to disseminate the content. The

Committee is seeking to determine if this intercept actually occurred and has asked

NSA to check product and files for pertinent intercept and reporting from USA-55 during

1963.

2. Though it seems unlikely that such a message ever existed, the following

actions have been taken in response to the House Committee request:

a. A records check was conducted in concert with N33 (Mr. Carrol Baldwin) •

There was no material which was identified in the records index as relevant; however,

check wa identitled a the tec

there were three boxes of material dated 1963 containing unidentified material. These

three boxes were opened and were found to contain the following:

1) Two boxes contained audio tapes with accompanying gists and logs

from USASA intercept sites along the German/Czechoslovakia border (USM-42 sites).

The intercept was identified as CKMS (Czechoslovak Army Voice communications) dated

1961.

2)

The other box contained International Commercial Traffic passing

between the Soviet Union and Cuba. This material was largely from the Naval Security

Group Activity at Sabena Seca, Puerto Rico (USN-19) and was dated in 1962.

b. A few personnel currently at NSA had experience during 1963 with ILC

intercept policies and procedures at Kirknewton and at NSA.

Several of them were

questioned, and recalled that an ILC mission did exist at Kirknewton in the 1963 time-

frame, that all traffic was forwarded to NSA, and that all reporting of ILC messages

was done at NSA.

3. On 21 November LAO asked that we also check those records available labeled

1964, because the 1963 dated boxes contained material from 1962 rather than 1963.

Further, we were asked if product for the 1963 period was available, if USA-55 material

used in

the product could be identified, and how much of an effort would determining

this entail.

We have checked the records for 1964 and find no boxes which we feel

should be examined.

The contents of all boxes are clearly identified and none relate

to ILC intercept, and there are none whose contents are not identified.

4. As noted earlier the product from ILC intercept historically has been reported

by NSA.

This product is available in Tl4, but there is no practical way to isolate that

which was derived from USA-55. It is possible to scan 1963 (QOC) product and it is the

T142 estimate that this would require a minimum of four weeks to scan the some 9,900

such products on file for the period from January through November 1963. G8 did not

request a search of these records, pending further word from LAO.
