MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT:

Earl J. Williamson

1 April 1970 to 31 March 1971

Nir. Williamson departed San Jose, Costa Rica, on 21

• February 1971, after having served as Chief of Station for two and

one half years.

The last year of his tour was highlighted by two

extremely delicate, highly productive operations targeted against

the Conunist Party of Costa Rica, and a political action opera-

tion of a most aengitive nature stemming from them. This latter

operation, focused as it was around the president of the country,

called for constant good judgment on how to pursue U.S. Govern-

ment interests with this highly sensitive and significant intelligence

at hand.

(It was highlighted at the WH Division's Chiefs of Station

Conferenco held in February 1971 as a classic example of both the

collection and use of intelligence on the real "national interest"

level.)

Throughout these operations, Mr. Williamson handled him-

yelf very well, especially during the latter part of hia tenure when

he was under considerable pressure as an alinost inevitable conse-

quenco of the impact of these operations.

Ultimately, Mr.

Williamson's recall from Costa Rica was requested by the Costa

Rican Government.

It should be strossed that this was a mark of

his operational success rather than the result of any operational

"flap" or miscuo whatever, (Tho U.S. Ambassador was the

government's ultimato and proferred target but, for a variety of

raasono, it was doaired by local authoris to avoid that hind of a

confrontation with the U.S. Governmone, so Mr. Williamson was

aclected as the noxt bost target in tho Fmnbassy.! Publicity based

on false and aelf-aerving loato by the locai governmene placed Mr.

Williamoun under the muet intense atrain in his final wecko. The

---

fact that, under these general circumstances, he continued to

function normally, responding to numerous demands being made

on him by the situation and Headquarters, and set about paving

the way for his successor to take up the cudgel from the best

operational platform -- all this speaka for itself and certainly

underlines the fine quality of Mr. Williamson's professional and

personal characteristics.

In the realm of normal activity, Mr. Williamson handled

his officers with both firmnesg and tact.

very well in the local commurity and, during his tenure, established

a wide range of contacts.

Mr. Williamson's relationship with the Ambassador was

excellent, and his wife was i great help tu him in discharging his

representational duties and in doveloping contacts within the Costa

Rican community.

In sum, Mr. Williamson is a "pro" who turned in a strong

perforrnance both before and after the chips were down.

Comments of Reviewing Official:

I fully concur with the Rater's comments. I am

pleased that Mr. Flannery explained the circumstances

surrounding Mr. Williamson's recall from Costa Rica

go well. His tour was a fine piece of operational work

and in no way should it be tarnished by misinterpretation

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT: Earl J. Williamson

1 April 1908 - 31 March 1969

Mr. Williamson began hia tour nd Chief of Station, San

Jose, in July 1968. He was well propared lor the responsibilitica

of the assignment, having served in two important stationg as

Deputy Chiel of Station, and as Deputy Chief, WH/COG.

At the outser of his assignment, Mr. Williamson was

confronted with an ambassador who had rocervations on several

matters connected with the station,

including problems con-

cerning the establishment of a "third country" radio operation.

Shortly thereafter Panamanian exile and guerrilla activities

placed an additional burden on the San Judo station and on rela-

sions with the ambasaador. Mr. Willlamoon weathered those

initial rough spots well, keeping Axoniy intereata protected.

In the seven months since his arrival in San Jose, Mr.

Williamson not only succeeded in overcoming the ambassador's

Initial frostineas, but has mollified the ambassador'a misgivings

0n arreral potential iremia of conflict. Furthermore, he has won

a strong endureement from the ambassador who has made it a

point so inform Mradquarters officery that he la highly pleaaed

by the manner in which Mr. Williammon is handling his irelyn-
