DCS Case 52872
Santa Monica, Calif. 90401
1. Interviewed 23 Apr 69, Huch C. McDonald, a cleared DCS source,
informed that there appeared to be a misunderstanding in connection with
his visiting Washington. First, he does not plan on going to Washington
himself; a representative from the Chicago Office is going for the purpose
of meeting with the Financial Group Company. Next, McDonald said he has
not offered to demonstrate his Voice Ident System. Finally, he does not
plan a "world tour". Rather, sometime this Fall he plans on visiting
bankers and government security people in various Latin American countries.
He will return to the US; then, later on, visit various European countries.
Again he will return to the US and then visit various Far Eastern countries.
His purpose in making these trips is to sell Hughes helicopters to foreign
police departments combined with possible sale of his check cashing security
system to banking institutions.
2. McDonald will inform DCS/LAFO of his travel plans when they are
firmed up.
*3. McDonald is willing to go to Washington, D.C. himself on 8-9
May and meet with TSD/ORD people there to "discuss" his Voice Ident
System, but he is not prepared to do so unless TSD/ORD have some
specific problems which his system will help solve. He feels otherwise
it would be a waste of time.
4. The above discussed with DCS/OSS (Musulin) 29 Apr 69. It was
decided that since ORD (Carrick) has been in contact with McDonald
previously that Carrick discuss the possible meeting on the Voice
Ident System directly with McDonald.
5. McDonald was informed 29 April to expect a call from Carrick;
that DCS/LAFO would follow up later concerning his travels abroad.

SUBJECT:
Case 52722
1. John Purfey passed the attached to me on Saturday, 9 Hay.
FYI I would like to comment as follows.
2. (Item 1) It was Herbert White, not Beske, who reported reporte
on the new radical group at Pitzer, source Linda Knolles. We doubt
that we can obtain much more in response to CI/SO questions. We
will try, but with caution, since we are dealing with a young, obvious
liberal female. As for Tom Clark, we think he is back at Cornell.
Our report to you covered all we know to date.
3. (Item 2) R. D. Beske will try and determine what he can
about Dr. and Mrs. Leo Kiper at UCLA. If everything appears favoracle
and we can clear we may contact. However, they are unknown to us.
Aak CI/S0 what they can tell us about them. It will help.
4. (Items 3, 4, 5, 6) These people unknown to us. stho are
they? Where did Furfey get their names? What does he know about
them? that does he want us to do about them?
5.. (zem 7) As I have reported, I will not personally contact
John Cole. The FBI regards him as unsuitable to help them and,
based upon their assessment, I will not serve any requirements on
him. (Sorry my memo on this had an incomplete sentence.)
6. (Item 8) Answer is "no".
7. (Item 9)
I have contacted Reid and reported.
