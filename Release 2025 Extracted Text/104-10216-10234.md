On 19 June 1964, the undersigned vent to the varehouse

at PrascOnIa to try to

sit the sight hood to otbor 7. 65mm thi

It was suspected that the fit might bo a probles when 1t

sould sot fit over the rear sighta of three pal rifles at Isolation.

Although it was latOr dotaralDod that thO arDO 81110s. parO a1 a

rear sight casting, it was folt that further checking vas necessary.

the sino, two were perfect fits and the other seven too thick

8or the hood to sit.

raja created & problen in that the bigai

hoods bad to fit rifles which for operational reasons could not bo

maRsurod before hand to deteraine the thickness of the rear sight

blade. Providing adjusteent in the glot of the eight hood mould

have complicatod the lixture to the point where it could becone

operationally unsuitable.

Therefore it mas deterainer that the

best solution was to provide soveral small 11les nith the boods.

The poap sight on

the rifles, a soft casting, vas found to be

quito easy to 111o.

In nost cases it mould be necessary only to

11le several thousandths to outain a proper 11t.
