SUBJECT

: Mr. Rocca, CI Staff

: (Thomas Lee Roberts:) The Itkin Case

At our meeting on 30 January 1969, certain additional questions were

raised relative to the relationship between (Roberts)and Itkin.

244 First, when did IEGLOBE become aware that Itkin and the

Conestoga Group had approached Roberts with a proposal to represent

them in AfricaNoWe were advised in 1966 through case officer

meetings with Roberts that he had been developing some potential

cover company business with interests from the United States and

individual names of those involved.

when it became apparent that no real business was forthcoming

from this group, our interest ceased.

2. We can add nothing to Roberts' account of January 1968 reflecting

that he entered into an agreement with the firm on 31 May 1901 wherein he was

authorized leave of absence from 1 June 1961 to 31 May 1963 drawing $100.00

per week for that period.
