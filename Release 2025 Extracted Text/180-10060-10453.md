RECORD SERIES

STAFF PAYROLL RECORDS

AGENCY FILE

NUMBER

:

December 8, 1995

Status of Document:

Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 10

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors

including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United

States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 4

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could

reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of

privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

ment and spirit of the New Administration.

It is with this in mind that I forward this letter to you as a member of

You were always willing and ready to work long hours, above and beyond

Throughout the planning and implementation period, you were faced with

an everchanging list of requirements. Your dedication to duty, under-
