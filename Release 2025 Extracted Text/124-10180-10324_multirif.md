GONFIDENTAL

NOTE: from January, aero, to approximately September, 1521,

primarily targeted against White Hate Groups. In 1971, he traveled

to Savannah, Georgia, at which time he reported on activities of the

National States Rights Party office and that Jerry Ray, brother of

James Earl Ray, stated he knew there was another party involved in

the killing of King and that his brother was the one who pulled the

trigger. This is the apparent HSCA interest in informant.

Referenced communications concern previous informal

requests by the HSCA that we contact SL 1495-E to determine if he

would be willing to be interviewed by the Committee. St. Louis con-

tacted informant on 1/27/78 and he agreed, but two days later submitted

a letter to St. Louis declining to be interviewed by the HSCA. Subse-

quently, the HSCA determined informant's identity through its investi-

gation and contacted him, at which time, according to the fisCA, he

agreed to interview. By letter to the Attorney General dated 1/26/78,

the HSCA has asked for all information at FBI Headquarters and in

the field concerning informant.

This matter has been coordinated with SA D. O. Coulson,

Legal Liaison and Congressional Affairs Unit, Legal Counsel Division,

and SA M. V. Hale, Top Echelon and Criminal Informant Unit, Criminal

Investigative Division.

The Congressional Inquiry Unit,

Legal Liaison and Congressional Affairs Unit and Mr. Robert I.

Keuch, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division,

agree

this approach is best prior to continuing discussions

to resolve legal and other issues.

The apparent interest of the HSCA involves informant's

travel to Savannah, Georgia,

in 1971 at which time he reported

on activities at the NSRP Office in Savannah, as set forth in

referenced communication. Informant reported that Jerry Ray;

brother of. James Earl Ray, and J. B. Stoner, National Chairman,

NSRP, were in the office when Jerry said that the FBI and he

knew

there was another party involved in the killing of King

and that his brother was the one who pulled the trigger.

HSCA has requested FBI Information on the NSRP, Stoner,

Jerry Ray and other individuals identified as being in

attendance

in the NSRP Office in Savannah during that time.

One of the

individuals present, Richard Geppert, was later

developed

as an Informant of the Springfield Office. Geppert has been

interviewed by the HSCA and has furnished a signed statement

In which he gives authority

for HSCA review of all FBI

information concerning him, including that pertaining to his

confidential relationship with the FBI.

This matter has been coordinated with Legal Liaison and

•Re: Request from House Select Committee on

Assassinations to Meet with British

Police Authorities

Dear Mr. Angel:

By way of background, the House Select Committee

on Assassinations, as authorized by the U. S. House of

Representatives, is investigating the circunstances surround-

ing the murders. of President i. F. Kenneay and Di. Martin

Luther king, Jr.

The Chief Counsel and Staff Director requested con-

tact be made with appropriate officials in the British Govern-

ment to obtain authority to interview appropriate police

officials who were involved in the arrest

of James Earl Ray

in London on June 8, 1968.

'Assistant Legal Attache Dennis Dickson had contact

with you on December 6, 1977. regarding this matter. At that

time

you requested the following:

A) "Purpose or scope of inquiry:.

B)

Names of individuals to be interviewed and

C) Intended use of results of inquiry, i.e.,

public hearings, etc., it being noted that

any records maintained by the British police

would be as the result of an official inquiry

and this would normally be available for police

use only, unless otherwise exempted by the

British Government.

The Select Committee responded that due to the

brevity of the 95th Congress, it was most important that

representatives of the Select Committee be allowed to meet

with appropriate members of New Scotland Yard who are

knowledgeable about the KING-RAY investigation. The Com-

mittee advised they would be happy to meet personally with

British Government officials in London to provide answers

to the issues forwarded to them for clarification arid

elucidation.

I would be most appreciative if you would advise

if this situation is agreeable to you.

Sincerely,

Dennis R. Dickson

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Portland, Oregon

December 19, 1977

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

On November 16, 1977, SA William F. Kusch of the

Portland Division öf the Federal Bureau Of Investigation (FBI)

was

Interviewed at House Annex #2 in Washington, D.C., by Mr. Mark

Speiser and Mr. Peter Beeson,

members of the House Select Committee

on Assassinations, investigating the assassination of Dr. Martin

Luther King, Jr.

The interview with SA Kusch dealt with a period of

time SA Kusch was assigned to the New Orleans Division of the

FBI, specifically April, 1968. During April of 1968, SA Kusch,

along with numerous other Special Agents assigned to the New Orleans

Division, conducted many Interviews with persons who had, or who

might have had, knowledge of the activities or contacts of James

Earl Ray during the period of time Ray, using the name Eric Galt,

was in New Orleans.

Specifically, SA Kusch was questioned regarding his

squad assignments in New Orleans, the identities of other squad

members, the identity of his supervisor, his Agent in charge and

his assistant Agent in charge at the time.

Further, SA Kusch was questioned relative to the

content of several interview report forms (FD 302s) concerning

interviews that he conducted and prepared appropriate FD 302s

in connection therewith, or FD 302s covering interviews that he

was a party to.

House

Select Committee on Assassinations members

exhibited said

FD 302s to SA Kusch to refresh his memory.

House Select Committee members in essence apparently

desired SA Kusch to amplify or further expand on these interviews.

SA. Kusch pointed out that as a result of the passage of nine and

one-half years, for the most part he could not specifically recall

the persons interviewed.

To specific questions regarding the

interviews, SA Kusch could only point out that if additional

questions had been asked of these persons interviewed at the time,

resulting in the receipt of any positive or pertinent information

regarding Galt, that information would have been duly recorded

on said FD. 302s.

Both Mr. Speiser and Mr. Beeson were cordial and SA

Kusch responded to their questions

• in a candid manner.

December 5, 1977

JAMES. EARL RAY;

DI. MARTIN LUTHER KING,

JR.

- VICTIM;

CIVIL RIGHTS - CONSPIRACY

On November 21, 1977, retired Special Agent Joe C.

Hester appeared at Washington, D. C., at the request of the

House Committee on Assassinations.

Mr. Hester met with the Committee staff in their

offices

at Washington, D. C., and was interviewed for a

total of four hours by two different groups of five persons

each.

Both groups were affable and were not in any way

critical of the investigation conducted in this case:

The first group of five interviewers asked a

variety of questions but seemed to be particularly preoccupied

with the investigation conducted by Legats in Mexico.

Mr. Hester was able to answer many of the general questions

regarding the activities of Legats but referred them to

Assistant Director Richard Long when they began to ask more

specific questions regarding the investigations by Legats

and the manner of transmittal of this information to FBI

Headquarters.C)

The second group of five interviewers asked more

general questions regarding the Bureau's investigation of

the king murder. They seemed to be greatly concerned with

the allegation of conspiracy. Mi. Hester advised them that

he believed the conspiracy theory was an invention by the

conspirac theory,

• Department of Justice to be used to justify the FBI's

investigation of Dr. King's murder.

Mr. Hester advised them

that he had never personally believed there was a conspiracy

and he did not believe that any of his FBI superiors had

ever believed in the conspiracy theory: Mr. Hester further

advised that it was his personal opinion that James Earl Ray,

acting alone, had murdered Dr. King and that his subsequent

travels were

probably financed by armed robbery.

RE:

JAMES EARL RAY;

DI. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

- VICTIM

This group was concerned with how the subject Ray

had known how to obtain false documents following his arrival

in Canada. Mr. Hester pointed out that a "Top Ten" criminal

had been arrested in Canada and had been returned to the

Hissouri State Penitentiary and had served time there with

James Earl Ray prior to Ray's escape.

Mr. Hester indicated

It was his beliet that this "Top Ten" fugitive had been

responsible for instructing Ray on how to proceed in obtaining

• false documents in Canada.

This group touched on such diverse elements as the

information furnished by John McFerren regarding Frank Liberto,

and one of

They also discussed

Ray's purchase of the rifle in Birmingham; the fact that

Officer Redditt was moved from the firehouse near the Lorraine

Motel just prior to the murder; what motive did Ray have for

killing Dr. King; whether or not there was any evidence to

indicate a conspiracy; whether or not there were any wiretaps

and whether or not there had been any surreptitious entries

made against King and his followers at Memphis prior to the

assassination; and when, following his escape, did Ray appear

to have made up his mind to

assassinate Dr. King.

In addition, they asked numerous questions about

the political climate

in Memphis just prior to the assassi-

nation and inquired as to what investigation was being conducted

by the FBI in regard to the Sanitation Workers Strike and the

first march conducted by Dr. King. Mr. Hester was forced to

admit that he had had nothing to do with the investigation of

Di. King prior to the murder and he suggested that they talk

to current Special Agent Howell S. Lowe who would be in a

They inquired about the interview of James Earl

-Ray conducted by former Special Agent in Charge Robert G.

Jensen, former Special Agent Robert F. Boyle, and Mr. Hester

at the

State prison in Nashville, Tennessee, following Ray's

plea of guilty.

Mr. hester recounted as best he could recall

the events that transpired in connection with this attempted

interview and advised the interviewers that former Special

Agent Robert F. Boyle has suffered a cerebral hemmorrhage

and possibly might not be competent to furnish information

regarding this investigation.
