OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the above information, witch does

not appear that the subject fits within the

criterian

of thelALaM program..

It is to be noted that the subject

was in the Us for a considerable amount of time before he

married an American citizen and had been granted Permanent

Residence on a Non-Immigrant status prior to his marriage to

CYNTHIA HAAS.

Although the subject did enter the US with the

profession of a photographer and had employment with Magnum

Photos, Inc. upon his entry, thite does not appear that his

services were solicited by this company because of a special

skill.

In view of the above, it is the opinion of the

NYO that further investigation of the above is not warranted

and this

case is being placed in a closed status.
