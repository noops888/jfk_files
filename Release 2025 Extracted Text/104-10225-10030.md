2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

SL0U37A MC9R3T

" January 1953

MEMOHANDUM FOR: DEPUTY DIRECTOR (PLANS)

SUBJECT:

RED

in Turkey

ACTTON NECESSARY:

Will you pleage decide or cause to be decided the

Tollowing

question;

Snonld the sitional Comnittee for a Free Burob:

in Its approach to

Turkisn authorities exploring the porsivility of

creating an RFE station in Turkey contact Turkish autorities as a

non-governmental private Contice or as a CIA-financed Institution?

Backround

The State Departuent has asked that R'E not approach Turkish

authorities until VO's attempt to zet Into Turkey has been

or reinsed by

the Turks.

The Department has now given the Voice of

America until 15 January to conclude its negotiations with the Turkish

Governent.

These negotlations appear to be leadin? ruhere and, on

the assumption that VoA will not pain entrance to Turkey, the Depart-

ment has authorized RFE to begin negotiations on the above dato.

2.

to

Bob Lang, Bili Turkan and Me. Wadsworth, former Aresearer

Turkey, as well as the IS division have all beer in on discussions

as to how NOFs should abornach the Turke. Mr. Wadnworth counsrls

that all cards be laid on the table, and he bares his reasoning on

his belier that the Turks will mon about it anyhow: and that prE 1s

likely to set further if it cores clean.

Phe NE Division on the

other hand hopes that the äpproach can be wat of a private committee

and that no mention need be made of ClA's interest.

3.

Your advice on the above question will not constirute approval

of the building of a Turkish station or of operations from Turkey. By

PRo decision at the last nearing on NOPE's budoet these cuestions in

Tirkey mist be brought back here for approval if the attitude of the

Turks is favorable.

NETHERLANDS

CHILEAN REFUGEES IN NETHERLANDS POINTED OUT AS FUGITIVES

Editorial by N.

Sudho 1g Dr 1994 Peenhuysens Reformatorisch Daeblad,

The Chilean refugees in the Netherlands seem to be

having adjustment problems. These rather prolonged symptoms

seem to be caused among other things by the fact that they

still find it hard to accept that the socialist dream of

their karxist president is definitely over and that their

country is now being ruled by a small

group of reactionaries

who are trying to keep the people under control through

terrorism, repression, and torture.

Such problems will take

you quite

a ways in the letherlands and those idealists were

quick to take advantage of it.

Welfare

What is the situation?

Most of the approximately

250 refugees with a high

school or university education do

not work.

About half of them have been housed at the "Huis

ter Schie" in Overschie, where they enjoy the sunshine on

the terrace or play volleyball in the yard.

lodging are free and at the end of the week they pick up

i year to Me dare

Board and

another 25 guilders pocket money.

In addition they receive

free language instruction, commuter tickets for the bus, and

compensation for each trip they have to take.

Do you get the idea that they are better off than

many. old people

in the Netherlands?

You are probably right,

because the Chilean exiles do not have to live on welfare;

they

are being paid from the frozen funds which had been

allocated for development aid to their fatherland, Chile.

So you can see how well our tax

money is being spent.

Considering that this small eroup of pampered exiles

is preaching revolution

even here and with a full stomach,

It may be useful to point out a few facts.

These are facts

which are well known in the Ministry in The Hague but for

some reason never made it to the Netherlands press.

Facts

The great majority of the refugees are not even

nationals.

underground organizations," those who during the last months

of his predecessor's regime had been charged with bank

of weapons from military arsenals, kidnapping. and attempted

The fact that some of those revolutionaries received

Chilean diplomatic status was due to Allende's policy of

granting residence permits to this type of revolutionaries.

fugitives didn't suffer any sleepless nights in

Chile either, because they

IMPORT DEMAND AND EASE PRESSURES ON THE COUTTRY'S MEAGER FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RESERVES. AS A RESULT, CHILE'S COST OF LIVING JUMPED 80%

FOR THE YEAR.

4. THE JUNTA HAS HOW AGREED TO FOLLOY THE STABILIZATION

PROGRAM PROPOSED BY AN IMF TEAM WHICH VISITED CHILE IN LATE 197%.

THIS PROGRAM CALLS FOR TIGHTER FEDERAL SPENDING AND FOR LIMITING

INFLATION TO 100% IN 1974. THIS IMF PROGRAM IS FEASIBLE BUT MAY

BE SOMEWHAT OVER-OPTIMISTIC, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE WORLD-WIDE ENERGY

CRISIS WILL SOON FORCE CHILE TO RAISE FUEL PRICES, THUS EXACCER-

BATING THE PROBLEM OF CONTROLLING INFLATION. ADHERENCE TO THE IMF

PROPOSAL HAS, HOWEVER, IMPROVEI CHILE'S COREDIT RATINGI AS HAS THE

SIGNING OF A BILATERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE UNITED STATES ON CHILE'S

1971-1972 DEBT. CHILE IS THUS IN A RELATIVELY GOOD POSITION FOR

THE OPENING OF THE PARIS CLUB TALKS IN FEBRUARY, THE MASSIVE $4

BILLION DOLLAR FOREIGN DEBT, HOWEVER, WILL CAUSE CHILE BALANCE OF

CIVILIAN ADVISERS TO ASSIST THE GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES.

THIS

PHENOMENON IS MOST APPARENT IN THE AREAS OF ECONOMIC POLICY AND IN

SUCH TECHNICAL FIELDS AS PUBLIC HEALTH AND HOUSING. THE IMPORTANCE

OF THE GROUP OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS. HEADED BY RAUL SAEZ, FOR EXAMPLE

IS WELL KNOWN. THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH HAS AlL ADVISORY BOARD

DOMINATED BY THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, WHILE THE MINISTRY OF

HOUSING'S BOARD IS LARGELY CONTROLLED BY THE ORGANIZATION REPRESENT-

ING PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION FIRMS. SIMILARLY, ALMOST EVERY MINISTRY

AND MANY AUTONOMOUS AGENCIES HAVE PERMANENT CIVILIAN ADVISORY

BOARDS COMPOSED OF REPRESENTATIVES OF GROUPS WHOSE WELFARE IS

AFFECTED BY THE AGENCY'S ACTIVITIES.

1Z• IN ADDITION TO THESE CIVILIAN ADVISORY BOARDS, THERE ARE A

LARGE NUMBER OF "STUDY COMMISSIONS" THROUGH WHICH CIVILIANS CAN

EXERT THEIR INFLUENCE. BEST KNOUN OF THESE IS THE GROUP IF INTER-

NATIONAL LAWYERS WHICH IS DRAFTING A NEU CONSTITUTION, BUT THERE

ARE OTHER GROUPS WORKING ON A NEW MINING CODE, STUDYING THE EDUCA-

TIONAL SYSTEM, COLLECTING INFORMATION ON UCCOMPLOYMENT, URITING A
