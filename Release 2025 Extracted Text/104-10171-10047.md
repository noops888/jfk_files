The other two who

toro roleased were Eduardo. Diaz Lanz und Jorge Cruz Peñe,

a Borgount in

tue kobol Amy who was with Castro In the Sierra.

Tho letter had aotually

not boen involved in the group. Source thought that he (source) und viaz

Lans were reloaned so thut they might be followed and loud the tovernment

to other groups and individuals

In Ravana who mlüht bo livolved in

rosietande aotivity. Source had boen in prison six montho beloro being

rulesaed, and one thing wbloh he could not explain was bat on the paper

that be was slyen which indicated his reloase, no mention mas made of any

sentenos or penalty.

•. On sovoral oooasions, duller had boon subjocted to false ezecution

procouures, with the purpose of trying to make him talk, but be did not

weaken. Duriny the trial, "evetyone remained I'irm," and zource was told

*hat Luller was vory bravo in his pronouncements aguingt the Fogiue and,

at every moment, abided by his prinoiples. He presentod a very brilliant

self-defense..

since he wanted to leave Cubü more than anythiny else. Homever he knew

that the various resistance groups worked hurd, oarrying out a great deal

of independent sabotage sotivity, although there was not muca coordination

among the various movements. One

novement which had a large membership,

espeoially In Orienta Province, was the l-30-Il. This soup nas planning to

launch an insurreotion in Pinar del Rio in January 1962, but they could

not carry it out since the repression in the araa was so preat.

h. Hans, a membor of tha Revolutionary Student Direotorste, was recently
