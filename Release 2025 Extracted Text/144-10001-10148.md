MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

28 November 1978

SUBJECT: Visit to House Select Committee on Assassinations

On 21 November I

visited House Select Committee on Assassinations

spaces to review for classification purposes the report Messrs Cornwell

and Klein

wrote following the 17 November interview with Sgt Nicholas B.

Stevenson, USAE.

2.

The report,

about one and a half pages long, listed the participants

in

the interview and described generally the substance of the discussions.

Although it did not mention the specific site to which Sgt Stevenson and

"Mr. Christensen were assigned, it did say that the facalaty was able to

collect the Lisbon-Tangier link. The report further mentioned "intercept"

and "NSA" in several places.

3. I told Mr. Cornwell that as written, portions of the report should

be classified "CONFIDENTIAL, HANDLE VIA COMINT CHANNELS ONLY." He agreed

to classify it and asked me to mark it which I did. I suggested that with

a few changes we could make it unclassified. Mr. Cornwell stated that he

would prefer to retain the original language of the report at this time

but that if it was to be used in any unclassified report by the Committee,

he would then ask us to review the wording so that classified information

would not be disclosed.

4. Mr. Cornwell asked if NSA had determined whether the conversation

Mr. Christensen referenced had been published and disseminated in product

channels. I told him that we had not yet determined the answer to that

question and that we would be back in touch.
