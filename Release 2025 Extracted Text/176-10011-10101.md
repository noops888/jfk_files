2.

Through clandestine: agent sources, we.learned recently.

that a Western European merchant ship en route from Havana, Cuba,

to Odessa,

• USSR, would be forced to dock at a Caribbean port and

off-load temporarily part of its cargo in order to repair minor hull

damage which resulted from an accidental grounding. It was ascer-

tained that this vessel carried as cargo 80; 000 two-hundred pound

bags of Cuban raw sugar shipped to Odessa, USSR, for'

refining in

the Soviet Union. In order to lighten the ship sufficiently to permit

repairs, it was necessary to off-load and temporarily wárehouse

14, 000 of the two-hundred pound bags of sugar.

3. Through a clandestine operation which was not detected

and is not traceable, we were able to contaminate 800 of these bags

of sugar with a chemical used in the process.of denaturing alcohol

while the bags were in the warehouse and before they were reloaded

on the vessel.

1790E

When this cargo of sugar is refined in the Soviet Union

the contaminated bags will completely contaminate the entire ship-

ment making the sugar unfit for buman or animal concumption in

any form. The contaminate we used will give the sugar an ineradicable.

sickly bitter taste which no process will remove. The contarinate

cannot be detected in the refining and although the contaminate in not

in any sense dangerous to health, it is so strong to the taste that it

ruins the taste of the consumer for any food or drink for a considerable:

time:

5. This successful contamination will spoil the entire cargo

the value of which to the USSR is estimated at $350, 000 to $400, 000

Additional Information

For your further information in connection with this operation,

it was conpleted on 24 August 2962 in San Juan, Puerto Rico:

vessel involved was the British merchant ship STREATHAM HILL:

The operation was successfully conducted without compromise and

none of the personnel connected with the vessel are aware of the

operation
