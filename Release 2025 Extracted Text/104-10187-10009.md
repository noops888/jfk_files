WITH KDVAULT TECHNICAL OPERATION. APARTMENT UNDER EARLIER

IN MAY, AND WE DO NOT NOW HAVE ANY SUITABLE CANDIDATES TO

OPERATIONS WILL REDUCE NUMBER ASSETS INVOLVED, COSTS, AGENT

KDLITERAL COVerage.

Approximately two years ago MHHARSH personnel

planted eight small trees along the edge of the terrace leading to

the garden.

These trees have flourished and now have grown to the

point where KDFACTOR-2, the KDLITERAL operator,

OPERATIONS

1. The KDFACTOR Project continued throughout the past six

to support two visual and photographic surveillance points

(KULITERAL and KDASSINTIE) directed against the MHHARSH installation.

ADMINISTRATION

2.

Howard T. BAGAUS handled the administration of the project

until early April 1971 when project responsibility reverted from the

Ops Support Section back to the REDTOP Section.

At that time Timothy

H. ARCHSOLD assumed the inside administrative chores, and agent

meotings were turned ovor to the outside case officer Bruce H.

assets in the futuro.

Processing

of the photo product is now accomplished inside

the Station by Phemia B, CHAUVEAU.

KDFACTOR-1, who formerly did all

the processing in an outside safehouse/darkroom, was terminated

amicably in early March 1971, and at that time

the responsibility

was turned over to CHAUVEAU.

The new arrangement has proven to be

more than satisfactory.

Agent meetings have now been cut to a

minimum, and

the processing of the product and delivery to the con-

sumer has been speeded up considerably.

PERSONNEL

The project includes five salaried assets. KDFACTOR-2

operates the KDLITERAL base house and has been employed in this

capacity since 1957.

HMMA-39679, 23 October 1970 (Previous Operational Report)

GENERAL

1.

The KDFACTOR Project continued throughout the period to

support two visual and photographic surveillance points

(NDLITERAL

and KDABSINTH) directed against the SHHARSH installation and to

support the related photo processing of the product..

The Station

is presently taking steps to terminate

KDFACTOR-1 the photo

processor and move this phase of the operation

into the Station.

3.

Primary responsibility for the operational and administra-

tire handling of Project NDFACTOR das transterred on 1 December 1970

to tae Operational Support Section, and handling of the KDFACTOR

personnel was turned over to Howard I. BAGAUS on 2 December 1970.

MEETING ARRANGEMENTS

KDFACTOR-5:

This agent is set by BAGAlS at 0800 ench

Tuesday morning at one of four different sites near the Anillo

Periferico in Polanco,

some three miles from the Station.

The modus

operandi used with this agent is basically the sare as previously

used by Bruce H. FERNALD.

All meetiny are held in the case officer

car, and after the meetings, KDFACTOR-5 resumes his trip to work.

patient while waiting In tho outor office.

The walting perlod

normally depends upon whether KDFACTOR-1 is in at the time, or

whether he is in the middle of an operation at the hospital..

(Waitink periods vary from immediate admittance to tho KDFACTOR-1

office to several hour's)..

average period is about twenty

minutes: A docision was reached in the Station to terminate this

asset and to transfer this phase of the operation to the Station

1tsell,

in the interest of speed,

security, and cost.

termination is planned for early March 1971, at which time, the

processing will be done in the stulion.

SECURITY

7.

There have been no known security problems during this

reporting period.

PRODUCTION

KDLITERAL: During this reporting period, KDLITERAL

through KDFACTOR-2 has again boch the principal source of within-the-

compound photographic coverage of PCS and TDY MARSHERs producing

129 rolls of film.

During the period covered, a great changé of POS

personnel at the MHHARSH installation took place, and KDLITERAL

played a leading role in assisting the Station in identifying the

of the installation,

through not only photogiaphic

but through detailed visual reporting also.

to reporting on the activities f the different individuals in the

target installation, NDLITERAL has also reported on significant

construction changes in the compound such a recent change in the

antenna configurations on the roof of the main building.

this period, KDLITERAL has boeu

sporifically targetted against

AEJEFE, on whom which a special report has been submitted.

KDABS INTH: Operating phrough KDFACTOR-S, KDABS INTH

produced 158 rolls of film.

It provided the Station with information

on visitors to the MIHARSH installation, giving speciai attention

of "WOCORK-type" perschs;

KDABSINTH continues to fulfill

requirements from the various sections of the Station who have

requested fixed surveillance of political exiles, otc., to determine

if these individuals are in contact with the WHARSH installation.

This segment of KDFACTOR continues to be the main source of

information on MAHARSH license plates and automobiles.

Both KDLITERAL and KDAPSINTH continued to provide detailed

"attendance sheets" on all MHHAPSH personnel.

In addition,

provided reports on the activities and associates of IDENTITY who

was on TDY in Mexico from 15 October through 4 November 1970.

During this period both units were also involved

in surveilling

the movements of an AEKICK techdician, (201-83S166) who periodicalls

makes trips to olher latin

countries on short notice.

PLANS AND CHANGES

CO MELO CASCCIMATION

With the excoption of the termination of KDFACTOR-1 (paras.

MEETING ARRANGEMENTS

3.

LEMPTY- 13:

He is met by FERNALD in the early hours

of Tuesday mornings

at about 0730 in Polanco, an area far from

the basehouse.

LIEMPTY-13 parks his car and walks through

central park on Calle Horacio where he is intercepted within

a ten-block distance by FERNALD,

driving his car.

and, once a month, LIEMPTY-13 1s

paid his salary and the

salaries for LIEMPTY-14,

-26 and -27.

After drop-off LIEMPTY-13

returns to his car and proceeds to his full-time job,

avoiding any direct route back to the basehcuse operation.

LIEMPTY-9:

After completing his surveillance workday

0800 to 1500 hours, he completes his willlen reports and

drives to meet FERNALD

at around 1630 hours;

also on Tuesdays.

The location of car mectings varies but remins within a quiet,

secluded section.

After leaving FERALD, LIEMPTY-9

proceeds to his cover job at a brother's automobile dealership

for the remainder of his day, again avoiding any direct route

from FERNALD back to the basehouse.

5.

LIEMPTY-1:

After receiving the unprocessed take from

LIEMPTY-9 and -13, FERNALD prepares instructions,

as suggested

by log entries that accompany the take, and goes

to, LIEMPTY- 4's

medical office waiting room in the late afternoon.

For these

meetings, FERNALD appears to be a pharmaceutical

salesman or

a patient and gets to see LIEMPTY-1 only after all other visitors

have departed.

At each meeting,

FERNALD delivers films from

both LICALLA and LILYRIC for processing anc retrieves the

processed take that, he had left the week before.

While this

arrangement means that

some of the product (those photos taken

soon after meeting with LIEMPTY-9 and -13) are almost two weeks

old

when received at the station,

we have not found this to be

unacceptable.

When speed is of the essence in special

circumstances, the Station WOACRE technician can handle the

processing.

The elimination of GRiNDE has resulted in some loss

of efficiency, since base house personnel cannot regularly be met

as frequently

as in the past.

This can mean a delay of up lu two

The Station's position with GERENDE from the

that he must agree to an amicable settlement with

in order to insure that she would not feel forced to take

steps which would jeopardize the security of Station operations.

for this reason, the Station insisted from the beginning that any

financial settlement with his wife would have to take into account

the fact that he was receiving a certain salary from RVROCK, and

that he could not fairly keep this salary out of the settlement on

the grounds that his wife could make no legal claim to that

GERENDE's wife was made aware of our position on this, and

she was grateful, even though she realized that

was strictly informal.

The Station felt that GERENDE could not ve

allowed to use his RVROCK salary as a weapon in the dispute with his

wife, because if he did, she could hardly

be expected to refrain

exposing his connections.

Indeed, events have shown that

GRINDE's wife is a vindictive woman, and if it had not been clear

to her that she,

as well as GERINDE,

would lose money if he loses

his job, she might have blown the whistle long ago.

GERENDE, for

his part, would have preferred to keep his RVROCK salary entirely

out of the picture.

eventually, however, he agreed that the Station

position was fair, and he said he would conform.

She appeared to accept this gracefully, even though it

would have to scale her support demands down to the

level of GERINDE's overt income (GERENDS'S monthly salary from

RYROCK was over 7,000 pesos; he earned an additional 4 to 5,000 pesos

teaching English, and he has since rented their house, for which

he is receiving slightly less than 7,000 pesos monthly).

Subsequently, LICHPTY-19 was told that the Station would see to it

that as long

as GERENDE continued to receive an RVROCK salary, he

would give her the same proportion of this salary that the courts

determined should be paid from his overt income. This, of course,

was strictly an informal arrangement,

one which would stop the

minute GRENDE stopped receiving a salary.

Later, as LIkITY-19°s

position hardened and her vindictiveness began to rule her actions,

LIENPTY-19 was reminded by the Station that the longer it took foi

an amicable solution to be reached,

the greater was

the chance

two occasions he has seen them.

They have been there since

5 December 1969.

LIENPTY-19 has denied that she has a fixed addresg

and says

that she is staying with "friends."

LIENPTY-19 1s continuing to use the services of Bernabe

through him, is pressing for even more

in the divorce than she had asked in November.

The charges and accusations made by LIELPTY-19 against

GERENDE are still not completely resolved and are as follows:

MAGALLON has

given GERINDE assurances that the charges

are likely to be dismissed.

b. Fraud - this charge was made by LIEMPTY-19 and her

lawyer on ll December 1969, the day after GERINDE left the

Villa Obregon jail after having spent a wook there for

disoboying a court order.

(The

coul't order had consisted of

an unfounded request to have GERENDE expelled from his house

and to have LIENPTY-19 reinstated there with her father,

the temporary custodian of the

children.

GERINDE refused them

admisson under those terms,

hence disobeying the Villa Obregon

judge's order, so

the judge's secretary arbitrarily ordered,

on the spot,

& 10-day detention.

Subsequently,

the judge,

LUCAS del ARAWAL,

was forced to lift the detention after

seven

days and disaiss himself from the case and divorce proceedings

as

incompetent.

The judge has had to face charges

of

collusion from and with the lawyers of both parties,

LIENPTY-19 claims that the money lent to her and GRENDE for

building the house at Ladera $39 was actually loaned to buy

the house and that GERENDE, knowing they were married under

the separate property marriage clauselad wrongfully placed

and that they were utterly destitute.

GERENDE was not

notified of. this charge and on 9 February after attending a

hearing at: the Villa Obregon juzgado (see below), once out on

the sidewalk, Judicial police agents detained GERANDE, took

him to the Procuraduria and fron there to Lecumberri.

This

procesg involved being finger-printed and muggod.

The

following day GERENDE was out on a 2,000 pesos bond and three

days later, 13 February, the justico of the peace (a woman)

formally set GERENDE free for lack of evidonce.

GERUNDE and

Magallon went back on 5 March to pick up the bond money and

see if Jurado had appealed but he had not and, apparontly,

that matter is closed.

On 14 Novembor 1969, one day after LIFMPTY-19 disappeared

from home taking the children with her, GERENDE brought charges

against her for minor losions and slowed. medical proof thereof.

The hearing of 9 February after which GUINDE was detained, was

called by Villa Ouregon Judge Bonfillo SEGURA.

GERENDE reiterated

except for GERENDE learning that they are still staying at the Dutch

Ambassador's. GERENDE'S last visit thore was on 3 March (Tuosday).

After the Villa Obrogon judge dismissed himself from the

now involved in divorce proceedings with his wife.

This situation is steadily worsening and represents

a potential

security risk to LIMPTY and other Station operations.

GERANDS

As Headquarters is aware,

the Station has for some time

tried to get additional mileage out of GRENDE.

The Station has

long recognized GRINDE'S not inconsiderable talents:

He is personable,

fluent in two languages (to the poiat where he can pass either as a

Moxican or an American with no trouble,

he has considerable

experience in support activities, he has knowledge of the local

scene which would be hard to duplicate, and he is completely at the

Station's disposal. He has also worked for RVROCK for close to

15 years, in effect making a career of RVROCK, and the Station

believes that this long period of service imposes on RVROCK an

obligation to see that he is fairly treated and provided with benerts

which would not otherwise be due an agent with less lorgevity.

On

the other hand, GERSNDS has picked up some bad habits- he is not

punctual, his

written reports leave much to be desired, and worst, of

all, he lacks drive and ambition.

i.:

1.

Some attention should be devoted, if it has not already

been, to the dangers involved in this operation and particularly

to what countermeasures the target may institute, or may already

have instituted.

One current danger certainly exists, to wit, the erist-

ence of project licalla base, which 1s in the group of buildings

comprising the Limesa complex. One of the agents at Licalla

base is known to one of the Lipstick agents arrested in the

sunner of 1958, and it 1s, hence, possible that both the host

government and the target knows of Licalla. It is suggested

that parhaps Licalla should be terminated.

The reason has been

that this should not be done since the agent would be

suspicious and in asy event Licalla might serve as a red herring

It is belleved that the licails agent could be

of this operation without arousing his suspicion.

Station could mount an obvious tail on him; shen he reported 1t,

he could be told he had probably been made and that, hence, tho

operation should no longer continue.

The agent has been & good

one and could be used elsewhere on some other work. Licalla

house 1s going to be repaired soon. This might be a good oppor-

tunity to stop wor; there and let some innocent party rent it.

That would be a better red herring.

3.

Concerning the manner In which linesa houses were acquired

by the Station, It should be kept in mind that the purchase nechanism

was identical with that used in Limited.

The watchnan at limited

knew an American owned it and told this. to what to him must have

seemed a casual visitor to the premises when it was under repairs.

He should, therefore, assume the targets know an American owns it

and that 1t 1s blown. Therefore, ve should also assume that 11

the targets have conducted any sort of an Investigailon of limesa

houses, they may well have discovered that the same ultimate owner

is involved.

So far as 1s known, the bank shich fronts for the

purchases has not been checked to see if any inquiries have been

made. We must agiee the targets have the capability to find out

who the front owner is--the bank-- and fron there could possialy

establish the identity of the omer, Limousine. Limousine and his

fims have also been used as cover for uther Station agents sad

operations apart fron Iluesa and limited.

but the question arises as to how

Summary

I. During the reporting period, the project's principal

agent, Raymond H. GlikENDE,

was assigned additional tasks, aimed

at broadening his uscfulness to the station.

These tagks

included spotting and assessment as well as the handling of a

recruited agent, ERFAIN-3.* GEREND; did well, and It 1g belleved

that a new dimension has been opened for him, and by the same

token, the Station has,

in effect, gained a new asset.

The

LIEUPTY base houses continued to produce at their usual rate

and with their usunl effective support to Station REDTOP oper-

ations.

The LIMITID Base House and its operator, LIENPTY-6,

were terminated on 31 May 1968.

Termination was decided upon

partly to save money and partly because advancing age had mensur

ably decreased the rollability and effectiveness of LIbAPTY-G's

wOrk.

LIEAPTY-26 was rehired, which permitted the LILYRIC Base

House to give us the same total hours of coverage as LILYRIC

and LIMITED had together in the past.

all ol the administrative problems which may develop. To judge

from the results,

GERENDE has excellent rapport with

these agonts

and 1s able

to get a consistently high periormance rate from

them -- particularly LICALlA and LILYRIC personnel.

As noted in refcrence, GEKENDE waS unployed by the

Mexican MIRAVEl, committee, which we found a useful side benefit.

His MIRAVEL activity during the reporting period has been minimal,

but we expect it to start picking up again.

GRENDE has con-

ducted a few disercet inquiries and investimations for us within

the MiRIVl, complex, and we have instructed him to try to fet

an assignment which

will keep him as close to the FJSTEAL

delegation as possible.

Reference also pointed out that GEREVIE had performed

nicely in the cultivation and development of an operational

lead, and that the station planned to live GERANDE more of the

o1 GERENDE's timo.

GlEND is rather firmly committed to

WOFIRM by virtue

of the fact that he has worked for holIk! jor

over is years and has no other outside emploment oi nuy

consequence.

By the same loken,

he was,

through no fault of

his own, dotny less work for world than at any time in his

career.

GERENDE's operational exposure through the years

dictated

more and more restrictions on his activity, for sound

security

reasons.

The solution to GRINDS's probler (lacl: of

a promising future) and the Station's (not retting

its money's

worth) seemed

to be to fire GEREND: additional tasks which he

could handle under suitable cover and with due regard to security

precautions.

Since

most of GERiNDE's support rutivities had

been against the FJSTEN, target, particular care would have to

be taken in committing him further in this direction,

decided,

therefore, that his principal retooling would be in

a non-FosTell lield.

recruitment of the prospect by GERINDS.

dithough

the attempt was unsuccessful, GERENDE eshibited considerable

resourceluiness and operational skill in doveloping the target

to a point where the recruitment attempt was possible. He plan

to use GERENDE in sinilar roles in

the future as opportunities

and for this reason we plan to document him with a set

or raise lexicun docureutation as well as a set of false kerican

documentation.

GERSNDE is collecting exemplars and gettin the

assembled, Headquarters (WOACRS) support will be requested.

GERINDE has continued to provide support for the JUROD

operation as needed.

11, In September and-October 1967 GERENDE was employed by

the Mexican SHRAVEL committee. He was able to get assigned as

alde to the DIZTAG delegation.

In this capacity he was able to

supplement very nicely the intormation and support being provided

by Jeremy S. HODAP!.

this foot-in-the-door came in very handy,

and is expected to be even more valuable in 1968, if GERENDS can

get the position again.

While the job was rather time-consuming

we believe that it mas well worth it.

In connection with his duties with MHRAVEL, aS pell as

in connection with the fact that his NOFIRM actlvities are nearly

100% against the EJSTall target, GERiNDE waS given a very jeueral

GERENDE will be able to make an even greater contri-

There wers no known security incidents during the period corered in tris

As a precautionary measure, the LIMiTY basenousekeepers.vest instructes

to vinintain incrensod vigilance in their nespective areas and tulliines and to be

prepared to evacunte any incriminatins equipuent and papers in a scuent's notico..

This was done because of the renewed interest in the assassinatior of President

Kennody which in turn brought forth comments in the press abort protographs

taken of Osvald during his visit to Mexico.

On

three occasions durins this period

LIÎMERACE-3 surveilled the operational meetings between GERaNTS and LIEMPTY-6.

This was done in order to try to ascertain if any FISTEAL persörel vera taking

measures to verify the activities of LIMPTY-o. MIEMERACE-3 reported that all

of the meetings he covered appeared to be clean of hostile surreillance.

(NOTE: Headquarters is aware of the interest FISTEAL has taken in LIEMPTY-6.

LIEMBRACE-3 does not knou the exact location of LIMITED/LINET-É, although he

1s -aware of the existence. of this asset because of the radio alert system used by.

the surveillence team when vorking the FJSTEAl. target. In onder to arold

LIEMBRACE-3 sürvellling LIEMPTY-6 to the exact address, WIsNsilas-} vas instructed

to surveill GRINDE when he departed the meeting site and to repart to GaReNdE

after LIEMBRACE- 3 was convinced that there vas no hostile surreillance and after

they had departed the meeting area.)

LICALLA

5. During this period LIEMPTY-9, operator of the LICAllal sasehouse, provided.

1112 frames of operational photographs coverins the patio ani garden area of

FISTEAL.

All phocographs provided by LIMiTY-, vere accompanied by fixed-

surveillance reports, sighting reports and special notes. LISVeTY-I is a per

ceptive individual and his special notes and comments are considerad. to be of

great value by the interested section in the station. LICAllA coverage was

suspended during the period 19 through 25 March while LIEMPTYay was taking, a well-

deserved vacation.

The cover of the LICALLA basehouse appesrs to remain good,

with no undue attention devoted to it by FISTEAL personnel.

LISMPTY-13 is

employed full-time and most of the coverage is provided by LINPTY-lt, and -27,

although during this period, LIBMPTY-14 carried the largest stars of the workload.

In March the hours in which LIEMPTY-27, a medical student, attenioil school

were changed from the afternoon to the morning.

This schedule change will remain

in effect until the end of June 1967. LIEMPTY-14 does not hare the mental composure

to remain on the job for the hours needed to provide full-tive coveraga and her

homekeeping duties often interfered with her working hours. In order to alleviate

this problem, the working hours of LIDMPTY-6/LIMITED were increased and those of

LILYRIC/LIEMPTY-l4 decreased.

No serious loss of coverase resulted from this tem

porary change in working hours.

The salary of LIEMPTY-27 was cut in half for the

It seems to me that any careful observation by

In both the old and the now bases. I have no doubt that the sovlets realize

6. Statton Conments. The Station agrees with GERENDE that careful

observation by tho Soviets would have revealed the missing slat in the venetian

blinds and also the fret that those blirin are soldom open. The Station also

asrees that the soviets realizo that they are undor photo surveillance.

This was pointed out recontly when a soviet shielded an LNHOO walk-In when

they passed the front sata of the Embassy and made a sign to the walk-in

indicating that they could be seen by someone watching with a telescope

Iron the buildings across the street.

Also, as Heedquarters is aware, there

have been numerous comments by residents of Mexico City to the effoct

that

anyone entering the soviet inunsay is photographed; however, seldom has it

been rumored that the

reatfirming GERENDE's statement that the Soviets possibly believe the Mexican

Government runs the base.

I. SUNMARY - Throughout the reporting perfod, the LIMPTY Project contimer

o provide the vast majority of the operational photographs and surreillance

reports used by the station in its planning and operations apainst the

LIMERICK Installation and personnel.

The LIEMPTY coverage has proved to be

a particularly rallable tool for:

fallowing the dally comings and goings

of the himnick personnel; providing loads to and confirming the Identi-

fications: of now LIMERICK staffors and also visitors to the LiMbRICk installa-

tion; providing loads to the rolativa rank and the specific Intelligence

sondes affiliation of various LIMSRICK officals: keeping the Station abreast

of construction and physical changes in the LIMERICK physical plant; and

providing a reliable check on various statton and LNDHOO access asents.

During the quarter under revier, Project LIEMPTY basehouses providod 5,003

frames of operational photographs (109 rolls) as well as 1,290 pages of

fixed surveillance reports covering the movements of the LIMbRICT staffars.

B. LIKNIRAP - Throughout this perlod, the LIENTRAP sobile unit was agein

targetted heavily against leaders and neetins sites of the lacel Communist

parties as well as other targets of opportunity, particularly Haitian,

Guatemalan and Honduran Communist axile leaders now resident in Maxico.

LIEVIRAP provided up-dated and/or new Idantifleation photograpas which

are of value to both the JuTIlER and the Station rocrultment/penetration

program. This apparat provided a total of 237 operational photographs,

while the personnel attached to this LINTRAP unlt regularly serviced 23

postal accommodation addresses used by Mexico City Station, Hesdquartars and

other flold Stations.

C. LIMITED - During this quarter, the LINTED bauehouse provided 724 frases

of oporational film as well as dally physical surveillance reports covering

tho arrival and departure of all LIMERIC personnel and visitors at the

ront sato of that installation during the evening and week-and hours. In

addition, LIEMPTY-6, the LIMITED basehousekeeper, working from his excallent

vIsual vantage point, diapatched the LIMERACE survelllance toan via radio on

BEVeraL LIEMBRACE survelllance operations.

D. LILYRIC - During this reporting perlod, the LILYRIC basehouse provided

2,859 frames of operational photographs covering the same area and targets

noted in the LIMITED section above, out during the norning and afternoon

hours. In October the LILYRIC personnel (LIEMPTYB -13, -14, -26 and -27)

It should be noted that GRENDE's alertness in spotting

indoubtedly saved this sensitive deception operation inn exposure by the

opposition.

SECURITY AiD PROBLENS

Other than the atteapted PRUll surveillance of tie AMROD accommodation

address noted above (which vas neutralized by GERENDS's alertness), there

have been no known inoldents which adversely affected the security of the

LIPMETY projoct or the related asent pernonnel. While several minor ad-

ministrative problems arose, all such matters were resolved locally.

S. CHANGES AND PLANNING

One major operational change is planned for the ensuing perlod.

Upon completion of the new LINOUSINE stricture (ses HADA-25352, dated 10

february 1965), the Station will move the present. Lumfic basellouse

personnel (LIEMPTYs 13, 14, 26 and 27) into that edifice rather than the

LIMITED (LIBITYs 5 and 7) personnel as originally planned.

Ancillary

nodifications are: l) To increase the hours of both the photographic and

physical surveillance coverage provided by the LILYRIC operators (dawn to

dusk) during the week day's and 2) have LInITED provide photorraphic and

plysical surveillance corerere on week-ends only, while remining on sally

stand-by for radio-dispatching assignments. Tiese changes were dictated by

the following considerations:

1) The new LIMOUSINE building will offer a much better vantage point

for both photosraphic and physical surveillance than does the present

complex which houses the LILYRIC and LIMITED bases.

Therefore, the

Station feels that the personnel occupjing this new bage should ie

those possessing the highest technical skills and also those ablo to

provide the most thorough ant complete covera...

SincA the IIIIIED base

now has only one trained operator while the LILIRIC basehouse has three,

the LILYRIC group 1s Indleated.

2) Because it appears that the coverage of the LINRICK Installation

w11l be a long-range and continuing requirenent, the station desires

to staff the new hase with personnel of lorj-rense potential.

LIEMPTY-O 1s now alrest 60 jears old, it is obvious that he loes not

possess this potential; however, the TILYRIC asent complex happlly

combines experienced personnel with jouthful agents.

Finally, the social and financial status of the LILYRIC perannnel 13

much more compatible and consistent with the envirorment of the new

building than is that of the LINIDD family.

While It is anticipated that these nodifications and changes will initially

cause varicus administrative and operational probleas, it is belleved that

all such adjustments can be handled locally.

b) The requisite copies of the PS?. Part II pertinent to LIB-t'TY-26

1. It would appear from paragraphs 2a and 2b of reference igat

KUDESK and KUTUBE Ops have nor itten completely informed of the back-

ground of the LIEMPTY Project and is agent-requirements. At the time

HAIMLA - 14093 (Request for Renewal of Project LIEMPTY) was wristen, it

was assumed that the Mexico Desk and KUTUBE/D could answer any additional

questions, based on reports and dispatches not normally available to the

senior staifs, which migh: be raised during the renewal process.

2. In answer to paragraph 32, Oliver G. SCANTLING first contacted

Inez. PARADA de Moreno in early: 1957 to fulfill a KUTUBE/D requirement.

He visied her ag an archipect interested in viewing the LIMERICA installation

from the building where she lives.

He was socially acquainted with her brother,

a Carholic Priest, and knew the family to be unquestionably anti-Communist.

However, It would be Imprudent on the Station's and SCANTLING's part to

assunie that PARADA does not at less: suspect that some anti-LIMERICK

intelligence service is involved. PARADA suggesied during SCANTLING's

initial visit that he couid return at sny time for further observations. This

was reported by SCANTLING on 21 Narch 1957 and it does not seem appropriate

to query him again on the pretert for his recent visits.

3. While HMMA- 14093 corretly referred to LIMITED, LIYRIC and

LICALLA as "photographic basehoses, " the Station would like to emphasize

that photographic coverage is oily one of their functions (please see FIMMA-12095,

+ February 1959). LIMITED is used as a radio dispatch base for atomobile

surveillance teams in addition io physical surveillance of persons entering

the front gate.

Their photography is negligible compared to their other duttes.

The LILYRIC base performs the best photography of persons visiting the front

gate, perhaps because the vantage point for taking the biciures is from the

second floor and above the sireer trattic which partially blocks LINITED

photographs. LILYRIC also does individual reports on LIMERICK personnel

entering and leaving the main gate.- LICALLA is used almosi exclusively to

identify LIMERICk officials and to support KUTUBE/D requirements in

connection with the LIMESA/LIMUST Project. As an indication of the effect-

iveness of LICALLA photographic coverage, the Movico Station has all the

LIMERICK officials identified. Before this base was activated more than two-

- thirds of the LIMERICK officials were unidentified. In order to support other

operations, it is considered essential that the Station identify all LIMERICK

officials.

In this respect, LICALLA nas provided most of the necessary infor-

The rctention of this base is also considered vital to the security of

the LIMUST portion of the LIMESA Project.

4. The Station does not agree that the color photography and moving

pictures are a luxury. Color slides were made for identification pirposes

and have proved useful, particularly in identifying facial features and skin

The motion pictures were nade at Headquarters suggestion (Please

see HMIMW-7687, 29 May 1959 and HNDIW-8438, 26 January 1960).

5. In conclusion, the Station would like to potnt out that the "photo-

graphic baschouses" represent an integral and significant part of the Station's

counteresplonage effort against the LIMERICK installation.

These bases do

not produce Foreign Intelligence and should not be constdered In such a light.

1. On 13 October 1959 it was learned from source that the local ODENVY

chief got a priority cable from his Headquarters asking why data concerning the

Mexican apprehension of the (KUBARK) truck and photographer had not been re-

ported to the U.S. Ambassador lucally, The statement was nude that "such

natters as this should be immediately reported to the Ambassador."

2. This cable resulted from the report the ODENVY office sent in on

the incident from the knowledge they had - as reported in reference.

3. The local ODENVY chief replied to his Headquarters that he did nos

agree that matters concerning KUBARk operations should be reported by ODENVY

to the Ambassador.

4. Source stated that the cable was abriously a result of the KUBARK/

ODENVY headquarters "ill feeling" which presently exists and which source

believes is primarily (and principally) attributable to the article in TRUE magasino

of Septen:ber 1959.

5. Source is LIMEW.

i. It is requested that under no circumstances should the information

contained herein be dissennated in any forn: Whatsoever outside KUBARK.

At 1110 hrs., 20 Septomber 1959, while on an operational abuignment.

LIEMPTY-10 and the LIENTRAP vehicle were temporarily detained by the Servicio

Secreto de Mexico (Mexican Secret Survice), LIEMPTY- 10 was huld under

unofficial custody for approximately zu hours before his releade was obtained, Ther

follows below an accountol the more important details portaining to this incident.

2. LIEMPTY-10 was instructed on 17 September to case the area surrounding

the Theatro Iris, located at Donceles 36, preliminary to undertaking a photographic

surveillance of all persons entering and leaving the theatre botwoon the hours of

0930 and 1200 hra., 20 September. In this instance, the Station's target was a pro-

Cuban rally spongored by the Circulo de Estudios Mexicanos (CEM).

T'he Station

had received information that nany of the leading Mexican and Central American

Communisty would attend this rally and that this was an opportune time to establish

which ones did attend and to collect their photographs. The Stition did not know that

the Mexican Secret Survice would also be covering thia meeting for the purpose of

preventing a Comnunigt-inspired demonstration.

The Station was advised at 1730 hrs., 20 Septemher, by Raymond H.

GERENDE: (ps), the Principal Agent who handles LIEMPTY-10, that L-10 was being

held by the Seerut Service, Immediately following, this notification, Allen W. WAKE

(ps) was requested to contect Philip K. TESSAROLO (pa) and request him to implemoit

procedures through a criminal lawyer to effect the release of L-10.

TESSAROLO

was contacted aud brieted at 2200 hours and immediately began arterpts to locate

a reliable criminal lawyer. However, as sometimes happens in an chergency

situation, his two most appropriate conticts were out of temn.

It was not until the

iollowing morning at 0700 hrs. that TESSARULO located another reliable lawyer

who agreed to handle the case.

4.

Since GERENDE vas known to L-10 and since the Station could not be

gure how much 1-10 might de forced to tell the Secret Survice, GEPENDE was

given the following instructiong:

A. To disconnect immediately the LIFEAT/LIVERY lince in the base

where ho and his wife vere living and to move all equipment to another safe

location. It was believed appropriate to take this precaution even though L-10

¿i not know the location of the LIVERY bage, the telephon: number of the

base, or even that GERENDE was living at a place other than lus mother'g

residence in another part of the city.

B. To collect and deposit with his Case Officer any compromising papers

presently in his possession.

C. To make a accurity inspection of the outside photographic lab at his

mother's house.

D. l'o phon: L-10's wite and inform her that procedures were underway

to untain L-10'g release and ior her not to lecome upset and talkative.

E. io suspend all operational contacts until L-10 was ruleased and the

extent of compromise was determined.

So Jeron; the evening of 20 September the Station LlfrdT Care Officer

was adise: that GERENDE had been arocted lo disconnect tie LIVERY lines

and so stAnsier ill LIFEAT equipment lo a safe location.

To further insure the

BeCurity & LIVERY, all LIVERy lines vere pulled externally during tie carly

morning de il September.

ó. A: approximately 1000 hr8., 21 September, LINEW informed the Chief

of Statio: that a contact vi las (LIMËW'n) had just informed him that L-10 (true

nante) ars die LIENTRAP

„vehicle were being held by the Secrot Service. LIMEW

stated that li L-10 was pie vi NUBARK's agents he would attempt to have his

contact in tho Secret Service brain his immediate release. LIMEW was told

that L-10 was, in face, a KUbARk agent and that the Station would very much

appreciase his efforts to clicet his release.

A short sale later LIMEW again

contacted tie Chief of Station and informed him that it would be noccasary for

documenicà ODACID official porsonally to contact a Commandante fnu LiMON"

of the Scerer Survice and that I-10 would then bo released.

ACCOrdING tO LIMEW,

L-10 had foid the Secret Service that he was carrying out his operational photo-

graphic assignment on a contract basis for ODACID; thoroforo, an ODACID

official would have to catablish L- 10's bona fides.

7. as the Station learned lator, the Sccret Service agonte were roughing up

sonic of tic individunla attending the rally; consequently, they were endeavoring

to make sure that no photographs were taken which could be uyed against them by

the Conmnists.

L-10 and L-ll, the LIEN'TRAP driver who loft the scene before lie

was deminos, were just proparing to leave the arca after taiing five colla of film

when a Secret Service agent demanded a search of the vehicle on tho suspicion that

it contaires Communist propaganda. L-10, his camera with telephoto long and

the film were then discovered in the rear of LIENTRAP. It was at this time that

L-10 was secused orally by the police officers at being a Soviut agent and later of

being a loeal Communist agent.

After being taken to Secret Survice Acadquarters,

L-10 told AlMON, m private, about his asgociation with ODACID and emphasized

that he certainly was not a Communist agent. LIMEW's source (possibly Com-

mandante MINION), believing that there may be some truth in Lo-10'a slatement,

contacto: LIMEW. Based in purt on assuniption and in part on fact, this is the

Station's pinion as to how ODENVY becams involved in to case.

8.

The Station, realising that LIEMP'TY-10 had not committed an illegal

act by aking photographs, decided that WARE should personally visit LIMON

and request L-10's release. WARE contacted LIMON and thu sub-jofe of the

Secret Service, Raul MENDIOLA Cerecero, about 1230 hrg., 21 September,

identific: himself as an ODACID official and told them that L-10 did from time

to time perform photographic assignments for ODACID, particularly in the

field of local Communist activities.

WARE also told LIMON and MENDICLEA

that L-10 was never permitted to do any task which was slogal under Mexican

law and chat if he had done so it was certainly not under the auspices of ODACID,

but on is or volition. They implied that L-10 had not done anything illegal and

that all racy wanted to be sure about was that L-10 was not a Communist agent. L-

10 was inimediately roleased and the LIENTRAP vohicle returned to him with ill

equipmes: intact, including the five rolls of undeveloped film.

?. 'Nhile WARE vas on his way to sec LIMON at the Secrut Service Ficad-

quarters, thi Chief of Station was adviged by the ODACID Security Office that

L-10 was being detuned by the Societ Survice. The Socurity Office was told that

WARE was presently investigating the matter and should be at the Sucret Service

Headquarters at that time. ly coincidence, WARE Was talig to MENDIOLEA

when tir ODACID Security Otice phoned to inform him that WARE was taking care

of the maiter. It was learned later that MENDIOLEA is a brother-in-law of the

local invest-gator employed full time b; the ODACID Security Office.

This was how

ODACID became involved in tha incident. To tie best oi te Station's knowledgo, the

ODACID Security Oificer lias said nothing more abour the inciden: and, at the time,

did not aitach any particular significance to it or seem especially concerned about

L- 10'8 atatement that he did sume photographic surk for ODACID. There saa no

Herepaper or other publicy pertaining, to L-10 or LIENTRAP.

During his visit to Sucret Service Headquarters WARE discovered that

L-10 had not boun booked of formally charged with an allegal act and that neither

LIMON NUr MENDIOLEA cuuld recall L-10's name. L-10 ias not placed in jail

during: the 26 hourg he was at Secret Service Headguarters but, rather, was permitted

to remain in the Secret Service agents' duty roum. No bribes were necesgary to

obtain his release; however, por LIMEW's requeat, $ 500.00 pesos were given to

LIMEW to give to his source, LIMEW said that in addition iu notifying him about

L-10's detention, the source was also reoponsible for all equipment and film being

returned intact to L-10.

11. TESSAROLO vas auvised, as 800n as LIMEW became involved in the casd.

that the criminal lawyer should not pursue the matter any further. I'wo bottles of

ycotch whiskey were given to the lawyer through T'ESSAROLO for the few taska he

had already performed.

12. After his release, L-10 reported that he was not interrogated and that he

did not reveal any data about other operations he has worked on nor did he give the

names of anybody connected with operational activitios. Based on the developnients

in the case, the Station has no rcason to doubt the veracity oi L-10'a statement. L-

10 was reprimanded for his use of statements to the Secret Survice about being

employed by ODACID.

i; wan told that the revelation of such employment wila to

he made only by the Station and that hencoforth he is never to use such a cover

story, L-10 was also esprimanded for hiu lack of judgment in remaining in an arca

where there was i strong concentration of police, it ia beliered safe to assume that

L-10 will never maise this same mistake again.

In retrospect, it in interesting to note that L-10's use of the ODACID

employment story is possibly responsible for his not bemy interrogated and thus

compromising other operations and individuals. This case has pointed out to the

Station shu desireability of taving casual contacts in the Secret Service and other

local police-type organizations do that the Station, rather than ODACID and ODENVY,

in the first to learn of incidents of this lype. Considering the multifarious activities

handled by the Station, it inus: be assumed that the police will occasionally appre-

hend an agent and that the Station must be geared to handle such emergencies.

The Station is allowing a one month's cooling off pariod for the LIEN-

TRAP vchicie and LIEMPTY-10. The vehicle will then be painted annther atandard

color and re-registered in the State of Mexico. Alter these security precantions

are observed, the Station stes no reason why carcfully sclected photographic sur-

verilance operations should not continue wich L-10 as a wiser and more prudent

LIENTRAP operator.

review of Raymond H, GERENDE's activities was forwarded to Head quarters as an

ill tachment to HMMA-11308, 22 October 1958.

ACCOUNT OF DEVELOPMENTS • OLIVER G. SCANTLING SEGMENT

2. Agert Information - Oliver G. SCANTLING has continued to periorm his

assigned tasks in an outstanding manner. SCANTLING's polse, common sense,

education, ideology and native ability for the pursu it of clndestine activit les

make him one of the most valuable support asses available to the Mexico City .

Stacion, The fact that S CANTLINC has tull time overt occupation as Chief

Enginee r and Production Manager for a local manufacturing compan y adds to

his long-range potential as a KUBARK agent. On two occasions during the past

six months SCANTLING has indicated to his Cise Officer that he would li ke to

resign from his overt position and devote full time to his KUBARK upe rational

duties; however, the Case Officer has discouraged him from doing this on the

basis that he has more long-range potential when his cover occupation is legitimate.

Of course, SCANTLING would be more valuable if he could work full time for the

Station, but not sufficiently so to warrant his resignation from his overt job (his

monthly salary in his overt job is in excess of $800.00 U, S.). The only

significant limitation that S CANTLING has evidenced to his present Cil se Officer

Is his occasional delay in preparing written reports of investigations and other

matters requiring reporis for the files. However, this limitacion gradually is

being overconie and it is expected that SCANTLING's reports will continue to

be factual, comprehen sive and soon will be prompily submitted.

Security Developments - SCANTLING is constantly under a consider able

of cosure and pressure when following up LIMESA leads obtained from

LIFEAT and the photogra phic bases.

Since time is always of the essence when

using such perishable leads, SCANTLING frequently is di rected to make approaches

to individuals performing services for the LIME RICK target after routine, and

sometimes only cursory, investigation. Theretore, the possibility always exists

of his entanglement in an undesirable secu rit y incident.

is a calculated risk which both SCANTLING and the Station must take if penctration

oí the primary target is achieved, whether decimically or by a recruitment in place.

it Is to SCANTLING's credit that he has not yet become involved in an incident which

he: Station feels has compromised him and/or alerted the target of KUBA RK's many

operational efforts against then. The closest SCANTLING has come to being conipro-

mised and to being identified as a PBPRIME agent stems directly from the LIPSTiCK

surveillance team flap of June 1958. The office used by the surveillancc team was

rented by sChniting in his true name at the time that he was loader of the team.

Not the sightest indication, however, has been uncovered which points to SCANTLIN &

SCANTLING and the Star ion

Operational Success and Effectivenesg - Briefly discussed below are some

of the many operational activities in which SCANTLING partic ipaced during the period

covered by this report. flir

MK LIGHTING opc ration th rough CASTRO. As late as September 1958 possibilitius

still exisied, or appared to exist, that CASI RO would complete his work in the

primary LIMERICK office and that it might be possible to install MKLIGHTING.

While CASTRO, through SCANTLING, was the principal source of this informi-

tion, portions were also confirmed by LIFeAT. During July, August and September

1958, SCANTLING had approximately eignt meetings with CASTRO, In late

Sep rember 195S LIFEAT indicated that the LIMERICK target was using persounel

under the supervision a one of their regular local ciployecs. Auton1g

(201-239821), to complete some of the work CASTRO was supposcd ro'tini sham

that ot her contractors were doing jobs around the target area which CASTRO

would normally in ve becn expected to do had he still been in the employ of the e

target. Also, LIMITED and LIF ENT confir med that the LIMERICK target had y

lost interest in CASCRO - he was not secn visiting the target in stalla iion nor die'

the target people attempt to get in touch with him.

In view of this, SCANTLING&

was instructed to cease all contact with CASTRO as of l November 1958, Kg

B. Pablo MON RoSas (201-03/52

SCANTLING had two intervicws with MON Rosas.

SCANTLING's most recent

report was forwarded to Head quarters as an at tachment to HMMA - 11143, 1

October 1958. Unquescionably the Station has identified Mon Rosas as the tech-

nician whe services LIMERICK sales and locks. SCANTLING will continue his

dcy elopment of MON Rosas (please see HMMA-1 1711, 10 December 1958).

accurate drawing of the type door installed at LIME RICK. This drawing was

forwarded to Headquirters via HMMA -11926, 2l January 1959.

SS SCATE prepared man emba sasing reing one euly and

West Ger man Embassy. SCANTLING's engineering ability enables him to

prepare accurate drawings and sketches from a minimum of data. Also,

his personality and gregar lous manner permit him to visit the inside of such

establishments, with an appropriate cover story, and retain minute details

which lat er he commits to paper and emerges with a comprehen sive floor

plan and important construction data.

F. 'LIMERICK Construction - SCANTLING's long association with th is

target from the casing standpoint provides the Stat ion with an unparalleled

source of in formation about LIMERICK construction activities, modifications

and rcasons for sanie. All of the LIMERICK cas ing reports on file in Head-

quarters are the product of S CANTLING's unusual a bil ity and knowledge.

Consultations with Station Officers about LIME RICK construction have been

of benefit to the Stat iondiring this reporting period and' they wili continue io

be of worthwhile importance,

G. Routine Investigations and Surveillances - Although the Station has

several assets capable of pertorming investigations and surveillances,

SCANTLING is still used in situations requiring the utmost in discretion and

clande stinit y.

His activities in this connection are too numerous to list

here; suffice it to state that he has contributed materially to the Station's

collection of operacional in formation through his investigative efforts.

SCANTLING's interiew of Paul Frederick Kir schholf (201-13015) of LCMAY-

*OWL interest is an example of SCANTLIN G's use on investigations (see

HMMA-1 1749, 17 Dicember 1258).

H. ESGEM-15 - SCANTLING served as the cutout with ESGEM-15 during

the latter's Deceinber 1958 trip to Mexico City. In this connection

SCANTLING is & support asset which is trustworthy and depen dable.

SCANTLING never displays undu e curiosity in operations such as the ESGEM-15

one; he accepts the minimum amount of information given and performs his

duties in a proîessional and sincere manner.

I. LIEMPTY/3 - SCANTLING handles the administ rative mart ers connected

with L/3. Doris M. KILLGO provides operational direction to L/3. During

this reporting period, she Stat ion had hopes of SCANTLING taking over the

operational supervision of L/3's activities. However, after a four-month

trial period with both SCANTLING and KILLCO iceting with L/ 3, it was

decided that it would be desirable for KIILGO to continue handling handling L/ L/3's

unu sual personality and intellect indicated that he could best be direcied by

a PBPRIM E citizen.

Therefore, SCANTLING no longer attends KILLGO's

and L/3's operational meetings, although he does continue to handle L/3's

administrative problems.

Mexico City in December 1958 and January 1959, it was considered appropriate

for SCANTLING to handle LIMITED, LICALLA and LIENTRAP. Although this

procedure defeats some compartmentation principles, it was the only manner

in which the Station could maintain effici ency with the three operations listed

SCANTLING has known the agents involved with LIMITED, LICALLA

and LIENTRAP for several years, In fact, he was at one time the agent in

cha rge of these three operations.

5. Operational Methods Evolved During the Period - The VIDALES operation

(see parag rapn + (C) above) indicated to the Station the necess ity for thorough

briefings and discussions with the agent making an approach to a target. This can

hardly be described as a new operational method, but it does serve to illu strate

the min im um efforts that should be followed.

The forthcoming LINIMENT IV

operation whe rein SCANTLING must recruit the landlord of the target's building

is offering SCANTLING and the Station the opportunity to prepare thoroughly for

SCANTLING's recruit ment pitch. The excellent documentation prepare by

KURIOT and the story being created by SCANTLING and the Station should increase

the batt ing average on SCANTLING's cold approaches.

(See HMMA -11366, 22

October 1958, and HMMW-7038, 21 November 1958, for additional details on

this Subjeci),

In a gencral sense, ond other conclusion can be made about a ny Station's

support apparatus - where technical and photographic operations are poss ibi e,

the utility of the information obtained is enhanc ed consider ably by accurate,

comprehensive and timely casing reporis. SCANTLING, as previously mentioned,

is an excellent a sser for this type of support.

Administration - S CANTLING's contract expires on 15 February 1959.

As of that date SCANTLING will have received an annual salary of $3, 600. 00 U. S.

for two years. The Station plans to raise his annual compens ati on to $+, 00C. 00

U.S. No other significant admini strative problems exist.

7. Outlook for Future Development - Station plans call for the continued

ut ilization of SCANTLING in the same manner as he is presently being used.

The Station will keep SCANTLING as un independ ent asset and, it is hoped, resist

the temptation to make him a principal agent in charge of numerous sub-agents. It

is believed that SCANTLING is the type of support asset that can be wo rtliwh ile

to the Station for many years to come and that every effor, should be made to protect

his security and value to KUBA RK.

ACCOUNT OF DEVELOPMENTS - RAYMOND I. GERENDE SEGMENT

8. Agent Intormation - Aside from the agent information given in HINIMA - 11368

22 October 1955, the only significant development was GERENDE's December 1958

marriage to a U. S. educated girl of Dutch citizenship. The $ :00.00 U. S. for the

purchase of two plane rickets as a wedding gift to GERENDE Was designed co

impress GERENDE with the fact that KUBARK thinks highly of him as an individual

and that KUBARK has a great interest in his intelligence career. GERENDE is at

the age and stage in life whe re he is beginning to wonder just what the future holds

for him. In the near future, the Station will propose a salary raise for GERENDE

and request a new contract that provides for some type of reti rement benefits.-

perhaps similar to the Civil Service Retirement program for KUBARK employees.

9. Security Developments - Again, the Information on this subject was covered

adequately in FIMMA-11365.

GERENDE was relieved of his LIFEAT/BGMORNING

and LIF EAT/ Cuban Exiles duties on 10 December 1958.

This, of course, was

vin line with recommendations contained in HMMA~11308 and represents a definite

security improvement.

GERENDE was told that LIFEAT/MORNING was being

terminated because it had not been productive of cnough significant information and

that LIFEAT/Cuban Exiles was being terminated because t he occupants of the target

apartment had moved (Note: This was true where the Cubans are concerned.)

Additional security Improvements will be made when Simon D. CLACKETT returns

to Mexico and relieves GERENDE of responsibility for the LIJERSEY sur veilla nce

10. Op crational Success and Effectiveness - Bricfly reviewed below are the

separate operational activities which GERENDE managed during the period covered

by this report:

A. LIvITed - This base functioned smoothly, securely and citic iently

dur ing the period July through December 1958.

The base operator, LIEMPT Y/

demon strated his usual competence and devotion to duty, in addition to the

primary objective of taking photographs of individuals of interest, L/o also

prepared detailed daily logs on the arrivals and departures of all target

per sonnel, weckly reports of work ers activities at the LIME RICK installation,

performed three one -man surveillances of Mexicans working at LIMERICK in

an effort to identify them by name and home address, and provided SCANTLING

with information on LIMERICK construction. During this six-month period,

LIEMPTY/6 took approximately 800 photographs from the LIMITED base.

B. LILYRIC - This base is operated by LIFMPTYs/13 and 14, with LIEMPF!/

12 serving as a cutout between the base and GERENDE. LIEMPTY/14 does most

of the photography and reporting for the base since LIEMPTY/13 has a regular

job and is not on the premises during regular daytime working hours. L/14

devotes approximately six hours (0800-1 400) each day to photography and the

remaining time is spent preparing reports. The Base personnel compile

individual logs on each target personality indicating their arrivals and departures

from the LIME RICK installat ion (Note; These reports are filed in the

appropriate Station 201 file and are available to Stat ion officers in analyzing a

target personality's pattern of daily activity). LILYRIC also prepared a

weekly report on workers activities at the Club and reports the license plate

numbers of all vehicles di schar ging or picking up individuals it LIMERICK.

(Note: These license plate numbers are then checked our through LIV ES TOCK/2

for the owners names and addresses - in case of immediate or lat er operational

interest.) During GERENDE's recent absence from Mexico City, OUSLER met

directly with LIENPTY/ 12.

Dur ing this period approximatel y y2, 000 photographs

were taken from the LILYRIC base.

C. LICALLA - While LILYRI C and LIMITED are excellent bases for

photographing individuals entering and leaving the LIME RICK installation,

the LICALLA base is the Station's best source of photographs of LiMekick

employces. LICALLA is so situated that photographs can be made of tanger

per sonnel in the garden ared of LIME RICK. LIEMPTY/9 is the base oporator

for LICALLA and in the Station's opinion performs his jub in an outstanding

manner. As repo ried in IMMA - 11308, LIEMPTY/9 is the brother of former

LIPST ICK/47 (the first LIPSTICK surveillance team member arrested in

June 1958). No repercussions, or indications of any impending ones, have

rested in this family relationship. This, certainis, is the major security

problem faced by L/9 during this reporting perial. L/ 9 and his family soon

vill have to vacate the LICALLA base for the period ef time required to renato

it. The Station is quite sure that L/9 does not know that his covert employer

owns the LICALLA base and the three adjoining houses and every effort is

being made to preserve this secret from L/9. (Sce HNNA-12032, 28 January

1959, for a more detailed explanation.) Of course, during the remodeling of

LICALLA there will not be any LICALLA iporting or photographs. In audition

to taking approximately 2, 500 photographs during d: is six-month periou, the

LICALLA base also prepared weckly reports on LIM ERICK garden aeris ities.

These reports indicate which LIMERICK employees are seen together each day:

which vehicles different employees are accustoniet to using, construction activities

and other matters which appear of significance to 1/9.

LIENTRAP - LIENTRAP continues to be a worthwhtie Station asser.

Approximately 1,400 clandestine photographs have been made of numerous

targets during this reporting period and LIENTRAP type activities will undoubaily

remain one of the Station's best investigative assers. As explained in the Field

Pro ject Outline, forvardel to Headquarters on 8 Cerober 1958, the Starion is

3: 0f che opinion that the LIENTRAP vehicle should be replaced as soon as possible.

Nearly four months have elapsed withour receiving fleadquarters authority co

replace the vohicle. The security situation is even more acute now than ai the

time of the request. LlEnTYs 10 and il do an errellent job on LieNtRaP

ope rations.

E. LUJERSEY - This operation can be chara cterized as somewhat dormant

for the July - December 1953 period, Because of GERENDE's other important

activities, he did noi have the time to train and work with the surveillance team,

Also, the Station considerel that it would be stretching security just a bit too far

to have GERENDE engaged in surveillance at the same time that he was handling

the photogra phic base houses and performing monitoring chores for LIFEAT/

BGMORNING and LIF EAT/ Cuban Exiles.

The expecred arrival of Simon D.

CLACKETT in April and his relieving GERENDE of LIJERSEY will enable

the Station to train, within a year, an efficient moble surveillance team.

At present, LIEMPT Ys/15, 10 and 17 compose the LEERsEy team.

F. LIF EAT - Until 10 December 1958 GERENDE served as monitor

in the basc house containing LIF EAT/ BG MORNING and LIFEAT/Cuban

In addiri on to living in the base house, GERENDE also transer ibed

the majority of the BGMORNING and Cuban Exile tapes. He performed

these jobs satisfactorily even though his efficiency was handicapped by numerous

other duties.

Relieving GERENDE of his LIFEAT duties enables him to devoie

more time to his other operations with a correspondig ulcrease in che securin

of all his activities.

On 16 December 1955 the daily check of property which this Station

may desira to use for operational purposes (LICJOi runy showed that a

house adjacent to the LINRICK target installation vas vacant. LIPSTICK-19

was contacted immediatoly to Investigato the property. He repurted that

1t was a one-story house(duplex) in very poor condition shich was being

repaired by the owner for rental.

He furtner reported that from the

maid's roon on the roof a clear view of ts entire LIMERICK compound was:

possible and, if he had understood the LIMRICK lazguage, he would have

been able to understand several conversations which vere golng on betwean

LIMBiICK officers in the game area of the compound.

LIPSTICK-19 also re-

ported that from the roof of this house 1t was a distance of only approxi-

natoly Mity feot to the LIMalICK building across liat roofs with no

obstructing partitions axcept for a small wall and sararal straids of

barbed wire, all totalling about four or five feet high between the last

root and the LIMERICK building.

Based upon this favorable report, reference A sas sent innediately

to Headquarters requesting authorization to rent the house.

apparent to all concernod that his decision was based upon loyalty lo

tilla Station and dedIcation to the fight sainst Coimunism.

It is hoped

that this unselfian and dovoted act of LIPSTICK-?l's will be majo a

matter of permanent record.

The reason for LIPSIICK-2 to nove from very comfortable quartors

at less rent into cramped quarters at a higher renta. needed sona explana-

There 18 a very fine privaio 30700l

approxinately one block from this house which HIPSTICK-21 has often men-

Soned as the best in tie city for his children, and consequently he told

everyone that the reason for moving was to be as close as possibla to this

school so that his chiliren could attend. It should be noted in this

in reality, LIFSTICK-21 had bean sending his chiliren to

one of the best public schools in Mexico dity at no cost. Unier the present

circumstances, he will have to pay tuition at the private school because

1t 1s the only decent school in the area and it provides excellent cover

for his residence in the area.

It 1s requested that Headquarters authorize

this Station to angist LIPSTICK-21 in the payment of his chiliren's tuition

for the above stated reasono.

Approximate cost of the tuition douli bo

$20.00 U,S, per child por month, or a total for LIPSTICK-21 of $0.00 US

per month.

Authorization is requested to assist LIPoTICK-21 by pament

of $30.00 U.S. per month.

The house 1a ore of a garies of one-story houses that extend iron

the LItICK building is a four-story apartment building on the far

The fronts of the houses are all diroctly on the sidewalk with

the doors opening onto a ono-step stoop.

Ire backs of the houses and the

walls of the back patlos all abut the compound of the LIMBRICK installa-

The rear windows of the house face a patio wiich ends in a brick

Inis brick wall is not as high as the roaf of the house, anding

about. four feet below the level of the roof.

this patio to the roof where

the maid's quarters are situattd.

About halfway up

these stairs one can

turn and obtain an unrestricted

view of the LIMEKICK compound.

the maid's room offers soe best

operational possibilities since it provides concealment for the observer

and his equipment, plus a more auvantageous view. LIPSiICK-21 told his

maid that she would have to sleep out at a local pension since ne saedod

for his radio exueriments.

Iris is a plausible story sinca

LIPSTICK-21 is known to do an enthusiastic radio amateur.

The maid's room has a door that faces across the roofs in the direction

of the LIMKICK installation and one window which faces across the house

oof toward the street

A view of the LIMFRICK compound is obtained by

in observer who is back in the room looking through the partly coened door.

Some better metnod of observation will be worked out wiich will eliminate

the security hazard of a door partially opened at all times of operation.
