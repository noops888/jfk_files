I that the:

3rd ISI (an GS-15) was proposed

to be'mado affective

on 19 Sept 60, but that the effoctivo dato had been

changed by Payroll to show 16 Oct 60. Reason for

•the chango is presumed to be due to IWOP. Form 560

If those fijures are correct, then there was no

MEVORANDUM FOR: Asilstant Director fOr Operations.

SUBJECT:

W111lan P. Burke, Memorandin of Performance

1. William P. Burke, Chlef of the New Orleans Feld Office,

cuntinues to manage bis office most efficiently and to demonstrate

thorough knovledge of his area. His Inherent conservatlam and some-

what legalistic approach tend to make 1t difficult for him to accept

change and nethoda peculiar to clandestine support without most care-

ful consideration of all the factors iavolved.

2. Mr. Burke represents the Agency well in his area. Hls con-

servatism is to a degree an asset in New Orleana; 1t could conceivably

be a handicay elsewhere.
