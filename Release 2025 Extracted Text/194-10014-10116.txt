1. Clemard Joseph-Charles was released from pricon during the evening of 25 Apr
68 in return for a "ransca" of US $605 thousand.
2. Charles has been given until 24 May 60 to produce the US $505 thousand. This
Gum must be in on irrovocable letter of credit on an American bank in favor
of the National Eank of the Eepublic of Haiti. It has been intimated that
the 24 Kay 63 deadline can be extended, should Charles to experiencing any
really umicual difficultica in producing the required monzy.
3. In order to obtain his release from prison, Charles had to sign a memorandum
of understanding that he would produce the US $605 thousand plus some
unidentifica real property. These terms were agreed to by both Charles and
his wife prior to the rolcase. At the same time, Charles wrote a personal
lotter to President Duvelier coking for rolease and promising to hand over
the money and property in question.
4. Charles is now under house arrest in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.
5. Charles's immediate resources consist of about US $100 thousand in cash in
two U3 banks (no additional data available), various homes, businesses
(essential oils, an automobile dealership and others (no additional data avail-
able)), buildings, land and about US $400 thousand worth of Haitian Covernment
bonds. He did bave another US $300 thousand in personal funds in Haiti. He
can no longer count on this money to help raise the US $505 thousand, however,
because prior to his release from prison the Haition authorities (no addi-
tiomal data available) confiscated it.
6. Charles has agreed to raise the US $605 thousand on condition that it be used
to pay off legitimate claims of depositors in his Banque Commerciale d'Haiti.

depositors who are able to produce documentary proof that they had deposited
funds in his bank.

8. President Duvalier is reportedly cost interested in the cor venture czi is
crices to cco 12 cucceed. La bas finally realized that the economic cituation
in Eatti hos Cetericratci co tadly during the past 10 months that to mest do
comething before total bankruptcy occurs. Accordingly, Presiccat Duvalier wants
to improve bio "image" in the cycs of the cutside world, particularly in the US,
cad by Coing co kopce to attreet investments and business activitics from out-
oids Haiti. Eo apparently hopes that the new, incorporated, Ecaqus Commerciale
d'Haiti, will help attract such activity to Haiti and is therefore permitting
Charles to proceed.
9. Collector's Note: 00-D-321/12106-63 described a possible reorganization in
the Faitian Government. This reorganization, cronsored by Duvalier, would
place Duvalier ca the clevated plans of spiritual civicor and fother of the
people and vould, on the curico, at least, turn over to a president the day-
to-day management of Haitian government cffairs. Various ces have been
Ecutioned for the position of president under the possible now cystem.7 The
name of Luc-Albert Foucard has recently beca mentioned frequently in Haiti as
the possible now president under the rumored reorganization of the goverment.
Foucard is a son-in-law of Duvalier and lives in Haiti. He is in charge of
tourism. Some say that Duvalier listens to Foucard and is, to a degree,
influenced by him. I doubt this very strongly.
