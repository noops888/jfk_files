AGENCY FILE

NUMBER

December 8, 1995

Status of Document:

Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 12

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors

including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United

States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 6

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could

reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of

privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

Substitute Language: SSN

Date of Next Review: 2017

Board Review Completed: 10/24/95

Richard Sprague

Select Committee on Assasinations

House Annex II

Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr':, Sprague:

Gail Beagle suggested that I contact you concerning

employment possibilities with the Select Committee.

seeking a legal position on the Committee staff, and would

like very much to speak with you concerning those possibilities.

I am a Harvard Law School graduate and a member of the bar.

Before going to law school, I was an intern with Congressman

Gonzalez. In addition, I have graduate degrees and considerable

experience (including teaching at Harvard) in modern American

history, a facet which might be of interest to the Committee.

In Washington, a reference can be provided by former

Speaker Carl Albert, who knows me well. He would be happy

to respond to a request for information concerning my

abilities.

I shall be in Washington through Friday, and hope to

see you during that time if it is in any way possible.

Sincerely,

faulfurik

Paul Zevnik
