Arent Japich advised McCone thai in had a piece of business

which necies ironing out before the end of the year.

The Agent ex-

pinined that since the assassination o" Iresident Kennedy, there

hare been various types of stories circulated concerning the case

the evirence collected; that some of these stories could immedi-

"i've discounted; and that there wes certain Information received

licCone was then told that he was charged with being the

Drew Pearson in that he, McCone, had stated that CIA had uncovered

a plot in Mexico City indicating that Lee Harvey Oswald had received

stating that it this were true, hicCone had endeavored to leave the

impression with certain people that CIA had developed information'

not

known to the Eureau and, in essence, made the Bureau look ridiculous.

¡The Agent advised that if McCone had made such statements, we could

only assume that he was employing viclous and underhanded tactics

since he and officials of his agency fully well knew that the story

i concerning the $6,500 had been proved to be absolutely false.

HicCone was very visibly incensed and left the impression

that he might at any moment ask the Agent to leave.

I a ten moments, he made the following atetant: 6)

After pausing

(1) He stated that he has never talked to Drew Pearson

in his life; that he has never sent any kind of message to

Pearson directly or Indirectly and that he does not have any

intertion, of communicating with Pearson.

He briefly referred

to the fact that he has been the target of attacks by Pearson,

one of these occurring within the last two weeks. (s)

(2) With regard to the 1$6,500 story," McCone advised

that as soon as the original report was received from his

people in Hexico City, he contacted President Johnson and

informed him of the development.

He explained to the Presi-

dent that this was a matter which required Intensive interro

gation of Aivarado and that CIA had coordinated very closely

with the FBI.. He told the President that Alvarado would be

kept in a safe house by CIA until the FBI was satisfied that

all necessary investigative action had taken place. (5)

(3) HicCone advised that he has not been critical of the

Bureau; that if he had any criticism he vould conter directly

with the bureau and not get Involved in malicious gossip.

encountered people who have been critical of the Bureau and

the Secret Service and he, Mclone, has gone to the defense

lof both agencies. (5)

losure

throughout.

Before the Agent left, McCone inquired about the

ratus of FBI - CIA relations in general and the Agent replied that

i; vere satisfactory. He also asked about the Director's health

1s indicated above,

Authenticity of Document

1.

This is in response to your request to this office

to review the attached document and advise if it is a valid

Agency document or something made up using an Agency reports

format and information either entirely made up or from other

The 3. August 1962 document purports to tie Dorothy

Kilgallen, Marilyn Monroe and former Attorney General,

Robert Kennedy, together with knowledge of an number of

matters, including the plot to kill Castro.

2. Those Agency officers who have reviewed the

document consider it to be fradulent.

While the format

resembles a "reports" form used in the 1960's, the

substantive information and presentation is foreign to

normal presentaion or collection efforts. Also, the control

stamps and othèr administrative items are not typical of CIA

reports written during the 1960's.

If you have any further questions in this regard,

please call me directly at (703) 351-2909.

HRG counterparts at the FBI are engaged in serious

In the course of those negotiations, FBI •

officers advise they are increasingly concerned about being

names, of three former Soviet agents. Given that view, they

believe it would assist their overall efforts and

information on one or more of the three Soviet agents.
