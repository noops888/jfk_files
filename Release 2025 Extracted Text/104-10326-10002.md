SUBJECT: PROPOSED DECLASSIFICATION OF BSS DOCUMENT FOR RELEASE TO

* <JFK> BOARD

REF:

NONE

TEXT:

1. ACTION REQUIRED:

PLEASE PASS PARAS 3-4 MESSAGE TO BSS

AND ADVISE WHETHER THERE ARE SERIOUS OBJECTIONS TO RELEASE OF BSS

DOCUMENT (BEING FAXED SEPARATELY) •

HOS IS FAXING (OR E-MAILING, IF POSSIBLE) DOCUMENTS FOR

STATION AND BSS REVIEW.

3.

THE DO<JFK>REVIEW TEAM ADVISED EUR/NG THAT A 1963 BRITISH

SECURITY SERVICE DOCUMENT, WHICH HAD BEEN ATTACHED TO A CIA

DOCUMENT, IS SCHEDULED TO BE RELEASED AT THE END OF THIS WEEK (31

*JULY) TO THE<JFK ASSASSINATION>REVIEW BOARD.

THIS DOCUMENT

(CSCI -3/778,353) DESCRIBES A MARCH 1963 INTERVIEW BY BSS IN

HALIFAX OF LILLIAN SLOBODA, WIFE OF VLADIMIR O. SLOBODA, WHO WAS A

DEFECTOR TO THE USSR.

THE BOARD IS INTERESTED IN DOCUMENTS IN CIA

POSSESSION PERTAINING TO DEFECTORS TO THE SOVIET UNION AROUND THE

*TIME OF OSWALD AND THE<JFK ASSASSINATION.> EVEN THOUGH CIA

OBTAINED THE DOCUMENT FROM A FOREIGN FRIENDLY SERVICE, IT WOULD

THUS BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO DENY RELEASE OF THE DOCUMENT IN

FULL.

4. WITHIN THAT CONTEXT, EUR/NG REVIEWED THE DOCUMENT AND

PROPOSES REDACTION OF ALL REFERENCES TO BSS, CIA AND FBI (LEGATT

LONDON RECEIVED A COPY OF THE INTERVIEW RESULTS IN 1963). THE

PASSAGES WE WANT TO REDACT ARE HIGHLIGHTED ON THE FAXED COPIES

WITH BRACKETS.

WE CERTAINLY WILL FORWARD TO THE DO REVIEW TEAM

ANY ADDITIONAL DELETIONS REQUESTED BY STATION AND/OR BSS. ABSENT

THESE FEW PASSAGES ABOUT US/UK INTELLIGENCE, THE DOCUMENT DOES NOT

APPEAR TO AFFECT CURRENT CIA EQUITIES; ON ITS FACE, IT ALSO DOES

ALTHOUGH WE ARE EXTREMELY

CONCERNED ABOUT THE DECLASSIFICATION OF INFORMATION GIVEN TO US BY

SECRET
