bad fooling and nistrust has arison botween CA and Stato on the

one hand and NCFE on the othor.

and the ama divisons of CIA accuse NCFE of playing personal petty

favoritos and of not keepink us inforned. On the othor hand, coop-

oration of State and CIA witi, NCFE in alvins poaltivo continuing

guidance in Weir efforts has ant bean forthconing. In the past

no coordinated attampt has bean made to give "ciE high-lovol

Tits division has asked the concernad area divisions

to initiate plana for rcorganization and ulfication of

Organisation

RSFERENCS!

Mesorandun to I, Subjects Current J. So Attempt

to form a Unified Runanian Refugee Organization,

dated 12 jeptenber 1952

l. The NCFE erotiationg for a unitod Ruzanian refureo organization

appear to be culinating successfully. Although a number of Millerences

have bren resolved, a fer controversial matters renain.

These points

have boen discussed several times, both with the !cht. and the refugtes,

but are of such imortanco as to warrant special attention and erasis

at this momento

2. The rost urgent problem, the one rost likel; to nullify the

rocerit

efforts and cause further difficulties, is that of Geniral Fedescu.

Tha problem 18 to find a position wiich the Generai kill consider suffi

clently Innortent for him and which we will consider sufficiently Innocrose

to enguro that he cannot interfere kich the comittee. A najority of tie.

rofu;ees are in accurd on thie necessity for placinr. limitations of actio

1uy on the Goneral, for operational reasons, ve require such linitations.

The existing good relations between the NCHi and the Generai should be

utilised to persuave the General that a passive, honorary position 1s the

only way to riard his health for, by implication, later action.

Fe rust

De made to realige that he is not voing sielved but 1s being savec.

If

he cannot ve prévailed on to adojt tilo atritude, he mill have to bo told

with complete it artness

that his

obstructionist cannot de tolerated, tat

he will have to re-ain passivo outside, rusher than within, the new organ-

Isation or risk losing the assisiance he now receives.

The first metrod

1s the more dost :able, and 1t 10 surrested tint the Geueral's secrotary,

Earbu Niculescu,

io intoried of the liCiE's intention and warned of the

Istter sten 1f his cooperation 13 not obtrined in expediting the General'g

acceptanco of a rassive role. Niculescu shoule be dealt vith quite frankly

and Intorned of the consequences, to his as vell as to the General, 1f no

Conversation with Mr. Jan Nowak

At your request, I had a conversation today with Mr. Jan

Nowak, acad of the Folisi raiio desk of WE in kunich. I ai

that you did not get to see lin.

Our conversation reninded me that

vi work is terribly importait, wilic: is a nice reminder on a busy

afternoon.

2. I say "important" because Nowak reviered with me the letters

he had reccived froin listenors in Poland

and these, togother with nis

out. enormous enthusiast for the hork he is doing, reminded ne that our

long days in hashington have an effect on the lives and hopes of people

Iar away.

Nowak, who was in the' Polish resistance during the war and

wiio on one of his three escapes from Poland at one time spent several

wosks in Switzerland where he had made contact with your ropresentatives,

later worked for the B3C and ho pointed out that at no time during the

Na" was he given to feel by the B3C the sense of responsibility and

mission which he feels in his job in RºE.

He said he was told wien

he Nas brought to RFE: that the

responsibility ior the programs was his

and that if at any time prograns wont on the air wiich wore irresponsible,

says that inen he has questions which

se thinks might influenes nited States policy, lie confers beforchand

with Griffith and the Acricans in Munich, and sonetines arguments ensue,

but ne feels, and I an cortain de lecls sincerely, that ho has an aqual

suare with Americans in a great effort to carry the truth back hone..

3. I say "terribly" important because Nowak, like othar exilos,

wonders out loud how long our work can continue to have an invact.

is rumself convinced tat every Polish soldier is a potential ally of

the irest but he wondors, and makes his listener wonder, how long we can

arcect this sympatiny anong a rising ioneration fur which the past is

inarorably fading.

4. Nowak made one point which I an sure he interded for your

ears, that no was afraid that "certain people in German;" who had

contacts into Poland right lead his friends benind the Curtain to

Mattora

1. You will be interested to knox, I an sure, that ir, Wiener's Srland,

M. Groniescu, has recently been most helph:l.

Through his offorts and the

cooperation of jin Pekich of SE. Europoan Division, I bolleve that HOrE 18 on

the threshold of a unifled Rumanian National Council.

I'm in ontire agrermont also with lir. Doorrasculs obsorvation on

the personnel sot-up within NCFE. As you know, kr. Dolbeare 1a concerned

about his role.

He is the firet to admit that his strenath 1s abbine, and

that he should retire.

I think it mist be arrood also that lif. Tolbeare has

done a aplendid job, a job that would have beon, and w1ll still bo, difficult

for a man in tho prine of l1fe.

I haro discusned this problem in confidence uith Francle B. Stevens.

As a rogull of my inuiries about a possible successor to Mr.. Dolbearo, lir.

Stevene suppests that Mr. Nathandol. l'enistone Davia 18 a person entrently

qualified to do this Job. I would to Interostod in knowing whother fir.

Wisnor knows this man.

3. I believe also, Ar. Georgescu's misalvings about ir. Yarrow aro valle

Icunded.

In the last two months, Mr. Yarrow has taken

an increasingly pren-

Inent position in Mr. Lolbears's Division, as a result of Mr. Lolbearo's

physical inability to do a fill tire job. lir. Yarrow 18 blunt, and Inclinod

to bo dictatorial. He has a predilection for direct action in situations

that rightly call for finesse and caroful dovelopment.

for theso reasons,

in addition to the fact that he la of luasian extraction and speako vith a

heaty accent, I en convinced that he should not replace Mr. Dolbeare. In

ny gainion, under the right leaderahip, Mr. Yarrow could continue to make a

valuable contribution to CHE's dealines with endares as an admindatrator.

I believo that such a solution is politically possible, for NCFE

In tils phase of its activitios 19 going through a perlod of groping and

I hope that the slart ve have nado in working out a

latters will provide a progren of posttive projects which will supply annund-

tian for psycholonical varfure, hoth behind the Iron Curtain and in the free

NCFE-CIA RELATIONS

I. whon this Division was delogatud the reaponalbility of

conducting CIA relations with NCFE 1t was, limediately apparent that

a varioty of probleme existed which nado offectivo action on the

part of IO Division difficult if not Impossible. These difficulties

may be gonorally sunmarized as followsi

(1) Satisfactory mechanical procedures to provido

Info: nation to CIA and to Insure effective

cooperation and coordination

of activities by

CIA and NCFE did not exist. This was true not

only in financial

matters, such as the orderly

submission of budgets and financial reporting,

as well as security, but was also true of atterpts

to gIve NCFE policy guidance and to insure that

NCFE's activities did not compromise CIA

operational activitles.

(2) The attitude of the responsible officials of NCFE

was one largely of non-cooperation in terms of NCFE

and CIA efforts being joint to achieve the same

objective. Indeed NCFE's attitude was that they are

a separate organization with the responsibilities

of a corporation In the State of New York, ant that

the role of CIA's representatives in dealing with

them was one of being their salesmen rather than

partrers, that tace theis geneser actritis were

- 2 =

(3) NCFE hao not only faliod to provide inforration

about 1ts activitius, but had gonerally expanded

its relations with government agencies in an

effort to play one agency against another and,

Indeed, In many cases play the personnel of one

agency against othor personnol in that agency. A

general feoling of suapicion and distrust provaded

CIn's relationships with NCFE.

2. In an attempt to properly discharged sta roapono bllities

IO Division has attempted to solvo the above problems by lil proparing

an agreement or directive which states sets out the joint responsibilitles

of CIA and NGFE and t

which clearly states NCFE's duties and responsibilitts

to this Agency, To Inplement this agreement IO Division has, or is 1n the

process of, creating orderly procedures by which this agreement will bo put

into effect.

3. If IO DIViBion 18 to duceed in 1ts task, which in our opinion

1s well begun, two conditione are incauscopeden essentials

(1) That there be a single point of liaison between NCFE

and CIA and that CIn act as tho sole official goverrmental

liaison with NCFE. It should be sald that this does not

mean that officials of NaFt will not consult with higher

authorities in CIA, but that when they do, those

responsible in IO Divinion will be fully informedo

(2) That NFE clearly understands with whom they are to deal in

CIA and that those with whom they deal on a regular basis

are responsible officials entitled to respect as such

MMORANDUM FOR: DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTFILIQENCE

SUBJECT;

Crusade for Freodom

l. Admiral Miller will call upon the DDI soon to request

more

funds for the Crusade for Freodom.

At the prosont rate of

expenditure, funds will run out on 31 December.

$488,991 was budgeted for the Crusade this yenr.

Wo

havo told Admiral Miller that since the Crusado was unble to

Il've within this budget, we were cortain that the Arency would

appropriats more money to wind 1t up,

although we have explained

that his request was embarrassing because the PRC had expressly.

approved $488,191 instead of a larger amount in tho bollof that

less money. should be expended this year.

We have noked Admiral

Miller to provide us with a financial statement of the Crisado

cost to date as well as a breakdown of the further amount needed.

3. The Crusade this year has so far cost only a quarter of

lant. year's expenditure and half of the anount exponded in 1950.

Receipts are up, 140% over last year at this date. On the whole,

a much better job has teen done to date than nu antlaipated -

and purely in terms of the anount raised the performance has

been superior.

4.

Thore is a good deal of gossip about the use of Crusade

lunds and I think you should be acquainted with it. Because the

Crusade 18 a rather public enterprise, the gossip has occasionally

been sounded not only within NCFE and

this Agency but also anong

"semi-witting" private citizens who have been enlisted for short-

term fund-raisinz on an unpaid basis.

The gossip is that a good

deal. of money has found its way into

the private hands of local

Crusade chairmen and workers.

In one instance, it is said,

1nvolving a local chairman in Minnesota, the

amount which reached

private hands was enough to build a new home.

Another story I have

heard repeated by different people on

different occasions is that

in the state of Nevada and certain other locales no money received

by fund-raising, chairmen last year was ever turned in to Head-

quarters, and no report ever made. Another item which some

that NCrl do what 1t can to prevail upon finfencu to conu back to the

Initod States and mango himelf in cortain nctivities wich nay te

of somo use and value to NiFE.

The following Intormation was obtaired

yesterday fron Mr. Tylir who is fantliar with the background of the

Iciorence message.

2.

Mr. Tyler statod that My. John iurhee has become yomewhat

concerned about the activitlus

and lchavior of Cafencu in Europe, and

moro espucially in and amwid Paris, and althourt: he does not relive

that a major isoue needs

to co mado of this matter, he la firnly of

the opinion that cafencu ig not doing anything ngcful for the NCrE

In Europe and that the not offect of his activities is somewhat, to

the disadvantare of the Interests of the linited states.

Carencu 18

bolteved to bo maintainine a rather close association with Cuy de la

Tournelle (sp?) and his wife, who are described as "very sour suilse

and bitter opponents of IDC."

Cafencu is also reported to have bren

Involving himself with cortain businessmen in France in a series of

questionable o1l promotion schemes.

He is also reported to have been

engaged in organizing a kind of infornation center in eniero circles

and to be selling this information to Agence france Presse.

MoreOver,

Gafencu has been selling himself and "throwing his weight around" on

the basis of reprecentations and strong intimations that he is a close

and intimate friend of Mir. Allen Dulles. liis utterances in this re-

eard are regarded by Hir. Huches as hishly indiscreet, the more so

since he appears to te livinr and entertaining on a scale sufficiently

lavish to sugeest that he is being provided with substantial funds -

well above the allowance granted

to him by NCrE.

Mr. Hughes, as well as tho Paris Station, fully appreciates

that NCrE is not in a position to force the return of cafencu to the

United States. At the same tine, he believes that NCFE should do

P. So

Since dictating this memorandu, I have received a report fron

a well-intormed Humanian source

to the effect that. Cafeneu has

roturned to the United States within the past few days for the

purpose of remaining here inderinitely

(The fact of Careneu's

return to the US has been positively established, and it is

possible that within the nort day or so confirmation will la

obtained concerning his longer-rane suture intentions. ly

Rumanian informant has told me that the real reason for dalencus

return was an urgent request fro. ilalara, wu feels that he re-

quires Gafencu's present in the united States to assist him

(Palaxa) in goverrment circles, etc. My Punanian sourca: is

prejudiced against Malaxa, but has maintained contact with

Cafencu notwithstanding this, ard is convinced that fafercu

1s st1ll on Malaxa's pay roll and subject to Malaxa's demands

Miss McCrum:

I have a feellag lhat no one on our a de la prepared to keep a litia hand

on tho Jean Paul David trip.

David is limools a king-sizo froe wheeler. Although bo is unquestionably

'One of the French "doers," as opposed to "talkero," in thia flold, ho

is also quito a big-mouth and laclined to over-talk, over-promine and over-

Indulge in cloak-and-dagger stago setling. Il he hasn't gol a guard, armed

to the teoth, with a borat and a hall-burnod cigarette glued to his undorlip.

lurking outside the dining-room, be can't enjoy hie rosal.

Ino plor lo complicated by the fact that as far ai the U..S. le concerned

ha has always been strictly covert. This time ho arrivea as strictly

"overt" so noon on our side will really know how to behave slace

evoryone will have to do and be the exact oppoalto of what they did and

were during David'o last trip.

I would suggest that you show the attached to Abbott Washburn, Georgo

Morgaz, Tom Braden and/or Bill Durkoe, and Joe Phillips (also thio soro)

and suggoat that they work out who should consider himsell responeible.

I personally hope Joa Phillips will be willing lo tako it on.

lacidentally, tho American who handles David best is Helen Kirkpatrick.

She migbe conceivably bo draited as chaperone for this trip.

debate mind

The following is from a disparin writlen dy Mr. William Tylor, dated

22 Juno 1953.

1. After a rocent coversation with Jean Paul David, at which time ho

outlined hio activities and ideas in connoction with the mission with which

ho lo charged by Geargos Bidault, I receivod a leftor from him.

2. It will be seon from this lotter that David is most anxioua that the

roport which he will tale an his survey should reprodent, without committing

any one country, a systhosia ol the viama and the rodourced of the Western

powora allied undor NATO, in the broad (ield al propaganda and paychological

warfare dosignod to build support lor Vastern delenso palicy and to promoto

she achlevomone of the objoctivas al these palicies.

3. It occurs so me that a difficulty maicù we have to face, and which we

are probably unique in baring to face; is due so the organisational afructure

within waich we aporase officially in the general field under diacuasion. In

a country like italy, lor examplo, it 1s possibla for David to havo oxchangos

of viers with high afficials of the government and to foel reasonably suro

that even though such riems are not to be taken au a commitmone, thoy do in fact

reproseni the disposition di the governmeat in question, or any goverament

likaly to succeed it, soward these probloms. In our caso, howaver, it seomo

to me that it will reguiro careful preparation to determine with whom David

should consult and to moris our a conatructive position which will influence

bis report and his recommendations in a direction which we approve.

4. It is particularly difficule for mo to make apacific recommondations,

since devolopmeata in Mashingion in the last lew months ara difficult to

keep up with from overseas. Il would, thorefore, la particularly helpful

to have headquartors' viowa at this stago on the fallowing points, assuming

that David. will go to trio Stalos in lato Sepsember du the last log of his survey:

8. With whoir should he most for basic diacuasioas. (Il occura to

me that a suitable body, il af ill in axiatorce, movid so the Paychological

Operationa Coordinariag Committeo.)

b. Within whai limits al this timo are ne preparad to díscuss tha

problem of concerted action for the psychological strength of lão North

Allantle Community.

3. As headquarters is awaro, C. D. Jackson knows David personally,

and it trould perhapa be useful so arrange for conversations with him and

say group ho might have in mind.! It is true that the position of David

with rogard to this Agency is anomalous, since làe ourney on which he la

engagod, lar from relating to comert aporations, is al the most allicial

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, International Organizationg

I had a talk with Spencer Phenix about NCFE. matters and

the following points were discussed.

(1) A Strategy Board to guide RFE. Spencer feels the need

for some higher lovel political guidance than RFE is getting fron

their staff people and talked about getting together a board of people

like George Kennan,

etc: I told Spencer that I thought it unlikely

that George would give very much time to this but might be willing

to give them an occasional idea or suggestion.

(2) Spencer asked me about the possibility of their finding

some job for Sam Reber. I told him to wait on this until I had time

to discuss it with FW.

(3) Spencer seemed disturbed that the allocation of one

million a month until our budget was passed would cramy their

operations. I told him that it they had particular difficulties to

Ict me know. He also asked what they should do about the proposed

allocation oi $100, 000 to help in the refugee situation. I told him i

was not familiar with this particular issue.

(4) He suggested that it would be well to have a meeting here

with some of the members of the Board and the Executive Comminee

and suggesied a date around the first week in August.

I told him I

would do it ill had not already left the country by that time.

(5)

Spencer is pleased with the better integration ard

coordination of activities between their shop and this office.

MEMORANDUM POR: JO/PP

ATTENTIGNS

Mr. Thonan Bracen

SUBJECTE

Mr. Kenneth Dean Koch

lo In Jarary of thin year I dircussed with jour offico the

rotention of Xonnoth Dean. Koch in Berlin as RFE reprosentative,

due to his extonelve ucofulness to FI in Borlin, Froviding PI

with covor faciltlos, loads, general services

and working very

satinfactorily in supporting

the FI mission 1n Birlin. At that

tine I was annured by Il that thoy would do everything possiblo

to sorain it. Koch in Berlin se the Rit representativo.

In Mas

of this your. I had oocasion to visit Bob Lung In New York on

anothor mattor and I ajain toucbed won Mr. Koch's assignment 1n

Berlin, at which tima fr. Lang assurod me that no chunges would

be unde in Kich's assignment In Berlin vithout prior clearanco

with me. He also emphasizod that no man would ba sent to Berlin

who did not meet with our comuleto approval.

In the norntino,

Koch was sent to Isriel to dot up the FFE office but sooninely

not with opposition on the part of Israel authoritles and bau

roturnod to Gormany with no dofinito job envisagod for bin.

John Elliott has takon civer the APE offico in Berlin and there

‚senna to bo no attent to nako any concessiona to FI wishes in

Berlin.

2.

We fird this solution in extrenoly unsatiofactory one.

allott, by backgrouid, gonoral charactor, and stility, 1a sot

an useful to FI in Berlin e8 Kooh was end I seriously doubt that

RFE would find him as catisfactory as Kuch in standard RFE busineus.

I know Elliott when he was & neuspaper man, und I have checked ith

several of his former colleagues uno agree that he doos not have

any of the hard-hittlag qualitiea so desirublo for an PFI: TapTA-

sentativa in Borlin.

This 18 not an attempt to bolittlo bla.

ability is a journaliat but the job in Berlin 1a very mich moro

than that.

In short, I would aprocinto your cifice taking stepa

with RIE to roturn Dean Koch to berlin as RFE reprocontativo, since

bio servicee to FI are very much desired even on a part-time baalo.

Our. rain reason for woriting Koch in Berlin is that the fFE offloo

aùtracts a large percentage of Satellite refugees and as such 1t

18 important for us to hive the head of the IFE office in Berlin

Memurandum for the Kecord

Subject:

Converaation with Congreasman Kersten

1. On 6 May Congressmon Koralen addressed a letter to the

Stato Depariment, enclusing a lelter dared i May 1953, which he had

received from Mr. Creighton Scort, a lorier employee of indi, Free

Europe al Munich, Germany.

This leller was highly critical of cer.

tain personnel in REi, particularly as regarde allegations of pro-com-

munist attlludes: Un 6 July I discussed these criticisms with Eungress-

man Keraten in detail, conveying lo him orally the material contained

in the memorandum of 17 June 1953 from the Director of Security; Subject:

Inquiry by Cungressman Koraten; which the Director ol Security had noted

should be utilized in this meeting with Congressinan Hersten.

2. The Congresoman noted the difficulty in evaluating the sype of

criticisms which dr. Scott hod made but appeared willing so accept our

explanation.

3. Cungregsman

Karaten then lurned to certain cribeisins which

he had heard expressed regarding RFt from several sources, including

Scult.

One such criliciom is that RFE is nt doing the beat it sbould on

religious programs.

He feels that this aspect ui the broadcasis could

probably be considerably strengthened, particularly anung Catholic

elements.

4.

Mr. Kersien cited the opinion of Count Tarnowski (sp.?), a well

knivn Pole, who told the Congressman What any fourteen year old Suriet

cilizen would be so well brieled on Surict philosophy as lü lura up their

noses al lhe RFF: material.

The Count (and fersten appears to agree)

feels that le Sivier population has more sophisticaled philosophicai

material thrown at them by their own Government, and that it should be an.

important function of RFE: to cuunter with an attempt to destroy le Soviet

philosophical material and shake the soviet faich in their theoreticians.

5.

Congreaszan Keraten realized that it is difficule lo capture a

wide audience with philosophical arguinents, bus he fee!s thas if these

arguments reached a segment of impurtant leaderd behind the Iron Curtain,

it would help to destruy and counter the philosophica! teachings of Marx.

Lenia, et al. The Cungresamen feels chat many of vur broadcaste deal

•with econimie mallers, and, while these are important, RFS should go

desper and hit harder on religion and philusophy.

6. While Cungresoman Kersten is aware that many of the

capilve population are not interested in righteal movemento, it la

his opinion that RFE cannot beat communiam with socialiam. In

particular, he lelt (and Scolt bore this out in their conversation)

that we were making tur much use of Czech socialiata, and we were

using socialists from the Eence Government which had sought su

compromise with the communists.

while be recognizes the popur

larity of Benea and Masarve in Czechia, he feels they are not el-

lective in Slovakia, where there is a heavy Catholic pupulation.

7.

Congressman Yersten plans to go to Europe, probably

in September.

While he did noe say su, 1 belleve he would welcomo

an invitation lu vial RFE, Munich.

Furthermore, is the author of

the Kerster Amendnient and ul several resolutlons on the enslaved

I adit to considerable curiosity when this document appared.

In raply to a direct inquiry fronto, Sears now states it was

At the risk of indicating an ovarly suspicious temperament, which is

not charactoristic

It estedios a point of view that the operation at Strasbourg

conditions are.

Royall Tyler and Sears have never had that exporlenco and

forned their opirions from what they have been told by Davis, Galy, Straka,

The latter in turn was constantly fed incornation by Caly and

straka, and altogether has spent only thide or four days on the ground. Fe

has had numerous talks in faris with Galy and some of die tutors.

This pertains to the work

1) :

r

1. Attachod hereto 18 a letter Iron Egidio Ortona of the Itallan

Entassy, who 1s reconsending for our considerition the above-nazod

Individual who 1s asld to be the son of tr. Arthur Malxner, formerly

the Minister Plenipotentlary of Czechoslovakla to the Vatican. Also

attached 1a a brief curriculum vitas of Mainer.

2. It 18 rather unusual for a forelen diplonat, even

though he.

be on

good terma vit officials of this Agency, to recomend personnel

to us for our use, and uncer the circuustances I do not suppose that

there would be ary. way in which you could maie secure use of this

yourg, man even 1f you vere to find him in other respacts suitanle. In

other words, he lo "blown" by the very fact of his heving been recon

mended to us by a forelin diplanat..

And I

ar also aware of the fact

that this would be a zood cheap way of effectiny, penetrations of the

Agency vere ve to folios the practice of acting favorably on recon

mendatione of this character:

Hevertheless, thero may be sone

aspect

of this matter which would have sipificance to you or to Mr. Tim

which I do not readily perceive, and accordingly I an passing this

on to you and to fr. Tian with

this thought in nind.

For exaaple,

there is a bare possibility that ticause of the contacts and connec-

tlons of Males and his fither, a former Czech diplomat, st alght be

possible to make une of him (on

an arm's-length basis) in a progra

of defector solicitation.

3. I an also furnishing a copy of this memorandum to Mr. Braden

In view of the possibility that Maixner atght be of some use to Radio

Free Europe, assurine that the dijection of his having beer introduced

to this Agency by Ortona coula be overcone.

SUSJECT:

RiE in Turkey

ACTTON NECESSARY: Will you pleare decide or cause to be docided the

Following question:

Should the lational Comnittes for a Free Euroo:

in its approach to Turkish asthorities

exploring, the posalbility of

creating an RFE station in Turkey contact Turkish autivir tles as a

non-governmental private Comátree or as a CIA-financed Institution?

The State Department haz asked that R5E not approach Turkish

authorities until VOA's attempt, to zet into Turkey has been accepted

or refused by the Turks. The irpartment has now given the Voice of

America until 15 January to conclude its negotiations with the Turkish

These negotlations appear to be leading nowhere rad, on

the assumption that VoA will not enin entraice to Turkey, the Depart-

ment has authorized iFE to berla negotiations on the drove date.

to Turkej,

as well

ag the l5 bizision have all beer in on discussions

as to hew NCFS should approach the Turke. Mr. Wadeworth counsrls

•that all cards be laid an the table, and he bares his resennirg on

his plier that the Turke will inod

wat of a privare cormittee

and that no mention neeri be made of ClA's interest.

3. Your advice on the above question till not constirute approval

of the building of a Turrish station. or at operations from Turkey. By

PR: decision at the last nearing

on NorE's budget these questions in

Pirkey must be brought back here for aperoval if the attitude of the

Turks is

favorable.
