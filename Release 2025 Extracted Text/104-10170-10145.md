MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Ramparts: John Garrett UNDERHILL Jr:,

Samuel George CUMMINGS, and

INTERARMCO

1: Ramparts of June 1967, Vol. 5, No. 12, pp. 28-29, contains

the following passages about Subjects:

"The day after the assassination, Gary Underhill left

Washington in a hurry. Late in the evening he showed up

at the home of friends in New Jersey. He was very agitated.

A small clique within the CIA was responsible for the as-

sassination, he confided, and he was afraid for his life and

probably would have to leave the country. Less than six

months later Underhill was found shot to death in his

Washington apartment. The coroner ruled it suicide.

"J. Garrett Underhill had been an intelligence agent

during World War Il and was a recognized authority on limi-

ted warfare and small arms. A researcher and writer on

military affairs, he was on a first-name basis with many of

the top brass in the Pentagon. He was also on intimate terms

with a number of high-ranking CLA officials--he was one of

the Agency's 'un-people' who perform special assignments.

At one time he had been a friend of Samuel Cummings of

Interarmco, the arms broker that numbers among its cus-

tomers the ClA and, ironically, Klein's Sporting Goods of

Chicago, from whence /sig/ the mail-order Carcano alleg-

edly was purchased by Oswald.

"The friends whom Underhill visited say he was sober

but badly shook. They say he attributed the Kennedy

murder to a CLA clique which was carrying on a lucrative

racket in gun-running, parcotics and other contrabard.

and manipulating political intrigue to serve its own ends.

Kennedy supposedly gor wind that something was going on

and was killed before he could "blow the whistle on it'.

Although the friends had always known Underhill to be

perfectly rational and objective, they at first didn't take

his account seriously. 'I think the main reason was.'

explains the husband, "that we couldn's believe that the

CIA could contain a corrupt element every bit as ruth-

lese--and more efficient --as the mafia."

"The verdict of suicide in Underhill's death is by no

means convincing. His body was found by a writing

collaborator, Asher Brines of the New Republic. He

had been shot behind the left car, and an automatic pisiol

was under his left side. Odd, says Brynes, because

Underhill was right-handed. Brynes thinks the pistol

was fitied with a silencer, and occupants of the apartment

building couid not recall hearing a shot. Underhill bri-

ously had been dead several days.

"Garry Underhill's chilling story is hardly implausible.

As a spy apparatus the CIA is honeycombed with self-

contained cliques operaring without any seal central control.:.."

2. A check of Agency records has jielded the following information

about John Garrett UNDERHILL Jr.

a. DPOB: 7 August 1915, Brooklyn..

b. Attended high school in Brooklyn and was graduated

from Harvard in 1937.

be providing information lo the FBI and ilso knew

him to be "careful about keeping the appropriale

U.S. Government agencies informed of his deale. "

8. In early 1958 CUMMINGS assuried sole

ownership of International Armament Corp.' and

of Interarmico. (An Agency audit established the

net worth of these companies as $219.000.00.

CUMMINGS bought them with a non-interest bearing

promissory note in the amount of $100, 000, payable

in four annual installments of $25, 000, and certain

ยก'emy of inventory which had a cost value of $67, 000

and a market value of $250,000.

These items were

to remain the property of Cla, and their cost was

to be returned to the Agency alter they were sold.

ti On 28 June 1961 the West German publication

Der Spiegel reported that CUMMINGS had been em-

ployed by CIA as an arms expert during the Korean

War and that he had cooperated with CLA in "supplying.

arms to various trouble spots".

mended against his use by Domestic Contact Service as

a source, and in December 1964 the CI Staff advised that

Subject's activity is not directed by the Agency. He

volunteers information.)

dated 1 June 1965, staled that at that time there was

"no record of a current operational interest in Subject."
