Lodge has little contact with Diem and has not been out of Saigon.

that he belleved that we should move cautiasly, that we should talk seriously to Diem

and_that Lodge should be urged to visit the countryside to obtain a more realistic

view of the effects of suspending aid.

Mr. McCone also suggested that another approach

be made to Nhu to seek his cooperation ina departure. The President asked whether we

had carefully studied the detail effects of cuts in aid. (as proposed in a paper prepared

by Hillsman). It was evident that the effects had not been studies.

The President

asked DOD and CIA to analyze the Hillsman paper. He also asked that a telegram be sent

to Lodge asking him to try to reduce the press leakage from Saigon and to establish some

real contact with Diem. Any current plans for ald negotiation should be stalled, and the

OCCURRENCE:

(CARD 2)

In a memorandum by SANCHEZ on November 13, 1963, it was reported that "FITZGERALD

informed [AMLASH) that the U.S. is prepared to render all necessary assistance to

any anti-Communist Cuban group which succeeds in neutralizing the present Cuban

leadership." (89) Despite the fact that SANCHEZ, reported that "nothing of an operational

nature was discussed at the FITZGERALD meeting

(90), FIIZGERALD recalled that

AMLASH-1 "spoke repeatedly-of the need-for an assassination weapon. In particular,

he wanted a high-powered rifle with telescopic sights or some other weapon that could

be used to kill Castro from a distance." (90)

FITZGERALD said that he told AMLASH

"that the U.S. Government would have no part of an attempt on CASTRO's life. (90)

However, the SANCHEZ memorandum reported

"After the meekits LAMAS!!? stated that he

was satisfied with the policy discussion but now tasted to know what technical support

we could provide him." (90)

the action to sabotage the sugar harvest which commences about January 15 and upon which

Cuba's one-crop economy depended. Sabotage of transport, mills, sugar sacking in cane
