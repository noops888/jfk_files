1. FHABOVE reports that on 13 January 1976 it again spoke to Subject

who, although remains approachable, declined to elaborate on previous

comments conceming the 1940's: Concerning himself, Subject said that

he and his wife toured Israel, Italy, Greece, Spain and England in the

summer of 1975. Work on the second volume of his book on Cuba has

fallen behind. HALPERIN left the impression that once the Cuba book is

out of the way, he will commence his autoblography.

He also expects

that Simon Fraser University will extend his teaching appointment to

decoruled by the Brazian government with the Order of tho

This experience led directly to his next position - a three.

The following is a SHABOVE request for approval to dissominato

SMABOVE/ 20 hand-

roquest to us and made the conment that SHABOVE lopod

that NOFIRM would tofuse the request since the derogntury intor-

mation could inve come only from one or two sources and SMALOVE

is generally opposed to making public information that has beon

acquired by covert means.

Although the iollowing

doos not montion

it, a similar request hns been Sent to LNERGO and SMORANGE:

"In order to acquaint you and your Agency with the reason

for our request in paragripli 6 belor, we

would explain that rocent

changes.iu the regulations of the Department of Manpower and immi-

gration and the

provisions of the Invigration Appoal Board Act have

created cortain problems.

2..

"Whon a Speclal Inquiry is hold by an Immigration Officer

st a Canadian Port of Entry to enquire into a persons admissibility,

i1 Information is available to the SHICOVE prohibiting the immigrant's

entry under the provisions of the Immigration Act, and this infor-

mation cannot be released for

security reasons, SMABOVE is required

by Immigration Rogulations to 'issue a "Solemn Declaration" for use

at the Inquiry.

Should such an Inquiry result unfavorably for the

Immigrant, he has the right of appeal.

. 3.

"In issuing the first. "Solenn Declaration",

in order to

provide protection for our sources, we only made a declaration that

we were in possossion of information making the subject ineligible

for entry to Canada under Section 5 of the Immigration Act.

However,

the Inmigration Appeal Board has since ruled that a

"Solemn Declara-

tion" should contain sufficient inforestion|to enable the individual,

against whom action is being taken,

to have a reasonable opportunity

of knowing the nature of the allegations.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: "American Delectore to tho USSR"

The attached material was part of a soft file entitled

"American Defcelors to the USSP", which was set up by SR/6

(Support) around 1960 and maintaincd by various SR. components

until ca. 1963.

The compilations were derived from a varicty

oi sources, and contain both classified and overt data.

2.

In the inll of 1966, the files were turned over to CI

Staffo: In mori instances, basic information was then abstracted

for thie US Defucto- Machine Program.

In all instances in which

the material ivas unigue, or representod a valuable collation effort,

it has been incorporated into the appropriate 201 file, alung with

a copy of this memorandum.

3.

It is suggested that any diesemination of this data should

be coordirated with SB Division and with CI Staff (CI/MRO), in

view of the frequently inadequate sourcing and of the fact that

disseminations have already been made through the US Defector

• Machine Program.
