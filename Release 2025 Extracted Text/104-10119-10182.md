Comments on Manuscript Give Us This Day:

CIA and the Bay of Pigs Invasion by Edward I.

Hamilton

This manuscript has evidently been kicking around in publishing

circles since at least mid-1968, presumably without ClA clearance.

William Backley of the National Review neems to have been "shopping" it

at one point. One publishes rejected it as too "controversial", and noted

Its "confidential"' nature as well as lts potential for libel sulte.

Z. In the foreword to this manuscript, the author (whom I shall

y to under his assumed name of Hamilton), describer the book as a

Personal account" of CIA's role in the Bay of Pigs affair in which he was

The villains of the piece are certain liberal figures in the Kennedy

ministration (Schlesiages, Goodwin, Stevenson) and to some extent,

ine resident himseli. In his concluding chapter, the author's bitterness

is undisguised againet those in the Administration and the presa who took

the opportunity of the Bay of Pigo incident to attack and denigrate CIA.

4. MossIs. Bissoll and Barnes and the author's other ClA co-

workers in the Cuban Project, by and large, are given quite favorable

treatment. One exception is General Cabell, whom the author excoriates,

and it lo apparent that Hamilton'o opinion of Jerry Droller is far from
