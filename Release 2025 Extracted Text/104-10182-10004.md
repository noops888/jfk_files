land because of the obligation to remain there until an indefinito

date, and above oll because of the work I'm now doing which had been in

ny departure, it was only a business trip.

" T had been able tourite you sooner, I would have done so. Now

I can, end of there are many things in suspense 7 would be flad to be

able to take then up where I've left them. T never expected you to bear

the price of ry actions: therefore, I'm counting on you to tell me whon

you paid for me. for I presume that most people immediately thought you

were responsible for m. debts.

As soon as you reply, I ulll Immediately

read you, and to be with you as before. I'm sure that some

day I'll return and we'll have fun like crazy, but this 1s

for later, perhaps in a few months from now?? I an now the

most handsone man in Brazil. Eridently not for very long

since I arrived only yesterday, but word has gotten around

you know.

They ilne up to see me!

In the meantine I was travelling all ovar. but

above all I travelled quite a bit by air, and it can be

said that since I left you. I spent balf my time flying 1n

the clouds with all kinds of planes, and also sonetines with

out planes. Sao Paulo is the pearl of Brazil.

Jou meet a

lot of Brzällian den end some pretty Brazilian wonen, but

what I'm interested in is to know 1f you are all really in

good health. My (greatest) wish would be to have a very

long letter from each of you, including little Michel.

I give all three of you a very affectionate and

big kiss:

[signed I

I want to point out to you that since the

mail here leaves quite a bit to be desired and since. I

travel very often, It's better to write carefully the ad-

dress I'm giving you.

In any case I'll receive your letter.

DATE:

SR/ DOB Meno randu dated 14 September 1959

The subject is an alien who, at the request of sR/DIv

(for the purpose of Redsox training), was parolied lato the U. S.

into the custody of the CIA In April 1959.

2:

According to the referenced memorandum, the subject's

training for this purpose has been suspended until about

1 August 1950, when it will be reinstituted. This delay, it

1s understood; 1s due to the fact that his proposed mission

has been postponed until late 1960.

3.

It 1s observed that SR/DIV proposes that the subject

be permitted to remain 1a the U.

until bla training is reinstituted in date 1960, ga, custody i

interim, his services will be utilized by TSS.

It is also

noted that the subject has, in the past, been convicted of

robberies acroad; has engeged in various nefarious activities

and that his knowledge of the English language 1s Linited.

4.

fithough recognizing that the subject is undoubtedly

a likely caniidate for the Redsox program, and further, that,

psychologically, It might vell be preferable for the individual

to feel that he 1s not in an

"arrest" category, still, this

office 1s reluctant to place in jeopardy the arrangements made

with the attoraey General by CIA; whereby individuals othervise

excludable can be brought into the U. S. for training or for

other operstional purposes.

It 1s felt,

consequently, that further consideration

should be given to the necessity for keeping AENSPIC in the U. S.

during the period he is waiting for his training to be connenced.

noted that the subject has, in the past, been convicted of

robberiss abroad; has engaged in varlous nefarious activities

and that his knowledge of the English language l8 Halted.

Although recognizing that the subject l0 undoubtedly

a Ikely candidate for the Redbox prograin, and further,

psychologically, 1t might vell be preferable for the individual

to feel that he is not in an "arrest" category, still, this

office 1s reluctant to place in Jeopardy the arrangements made

with the Attorney General by CIA, whereby individuals othervise

other operational purposes.

S.: It 18 felt, consequently, that further consideration

abould be given to the necessity for keeping AEASPIC 1n the U. S.

during the perfod he 1s walting for his training to be commenced.

3. Eating Habits:

Subject is not too impressed with arerican say of eating, that 1s,

having all the food put on the table and than each talang a portion of each

course and filling up tre plate.

Subject feels that nore time should be devoted to eating than Joe C.

alloted for eating.

te was amazed that it only took the latter about 15

nutes to eat. Likewise, Subject likes to eat one course at a time and

that each course be brought into the roon and placed on the table separately.

wver tre neat he would like iresh fruit, cheese, coffoe. He does not care

ruch for sweets, reitcer does he care for cottage cheese salad, 1.e.,

cottage cheese

and canned fruit.

This corbination irks hin.

Subject was

assured that this was a ranner of eating in America and that it was a

custon and that the undersigned probably would find sone faults with the

way the French serre food. Dave enjoys fruit juices.

Dave eats his food in the manner to which he is accustored. He puts

orly ore course on his plate and caly when finished eating it does he help

hinself to the next course, etc.

At breakfast he is a very lift eater. He is content just with

coffee, toast and juice.

50 General Remarks!

He was amazed that he was in the U.S..o, though he was here he stated

that te could not celieve that he was here.

The relative seclusion auriog

In the U.Sid. Many at ris ideas regarcing Averican seemed to be inpressions

that he obtained from seeing. American filns while in france.

Thus he has

a little citriculty trjing to place the Auerica that he has observed now

with what preconceived loeas that he already bas of America.

while in

town on 23 April, his only remark about Washington was that

he did not see any excertionally beautifully girls (Hollywood types). Fe

also stated that the aterican males, loe, American Soldier in 1945, was

atee strone, beälthy type of male.

route fron the aurport Dave wore his blackout glasses until ve

reached the district line. while crossing the South Capital Street Bridge

Dave seas ed that ve were brossing the bridge because of the vierations caused

by the car passing over the-steel mesh on the bridge; stated that we must

be crossing the Fotonae river now.

Another question was how far was the

airport fron the house where we were headed.

The undersigned agreed that

we were crossing the Fotomac

and that the area we were going to was over.

fifty niles from the district.

By nature Dave is very curious.

To satisfy his curiousity he uses

various ruses in order to elicit information regarding his status and

Wienever the undersigned went for a walk with Dave, usually before

and after meals, the former expected to be asked numerous personal.

questions.

One

or twice, Dave mentioned that he aid not know why he was

here, what kind of job he would have, etc.

Dave was assured that this sounded somewhat irregular, the undersigned

felt. that he mist have been told something womewhere alcng

the line.

At

this roirt, Dave would stop asking questions..

Later on the undersimed

learned that Dave was very talkative with Tom Piller (alias) and told the

latter the whole story about what was told to date. It is assumed that

Dave was trying to show fon that he knew everything and thus hope that

Toné would fill any little details that Dave would omit.

These were two

different approaches that Dave used trying to elicit information frca the

undersigned and Ton Miller.

Dave seers to be quite a periectionist when it come to things

nechanical.

while at the Log Cabin, Dave tried on af nurber of occasions to

adjust the li set. Dave could not understand why the IV set sometines

would not function proverly particularly whenever a passing plane would go

over It would interfere with

the sets operation. This account did not

suit hle for he had to try and asjust, so as a result more time was

expended

he does not feel being a Georgian,

Although he"hates the Russians in General", and even more

the Soviet-Russians, this hatred was not strong

enough to make

him join the German-sponsored Georgian ant1-Soviet unit. (G 4,8.)

His longing for thrill and excitement, the single remaining

notivation, seems to be limited to the more-or-less.comfortable,

physically easy activities, like forging of documents, and

fooling officials with those documents,

playing a wise man who

acts accörding to his psychological tricks. (6 24,36,37,57; D 6.)

2• Drafting a list of additional fact-finding and control ques-

tions •

3. Asking these questions under simultaneous application of

consealed tape

detäiled study of the answers and reactions of David.

4. Secret checks on persons sentioned in David's story, espe-

cially on Mathée Keresselidze.

5. Secret checks with the French authorities on the last 10

years of David's whereabouts, activities and contacts, in-

cluding the time in jails.
