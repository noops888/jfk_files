since President Roosevelt met Mr. Hoover immediately after returning from

an extended trip, a departure from his usual practice. There was no entry

on 8/25/36, other than the President's departure for the Dakotas at 10:40 p.m.

RESEARCH CONDUCTED AT FRANKLIN D.

ROOSEVELT LIBRARY, HYDE PARK, NY

ON 3/10-12/75

On 3/10/74, Mr: DONALD B. SCHEWE, Assistant

Librarian in the Reference Archives, Franklin D. Roosevelt

Library, Hyde Park, NY, was advised

of our interest in

locating any communications bearing upon a conversation

between former President FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT. and former

Secretary of State CORDELL HULL in the latter part of

August, 1935.

SCHEWE was advised that this conversation

was concerned with the security of the US and that Mr. J.

EDGAR HOOVER of the FBI may have participated in this

conversation. Mr. SCHEWE was also advised that Mr. ROOSEVELT

allegedly reduced the subject matter of above conversation

to a memorandum and that we were interested in locating

this memorandum or some information bearing upon above

conversation.

Arrangements were made to meet with Mr.

SCHERE

at the Franklin D.

Roosevelt Library in Hyde Park, NY,

on 3/12/75. Mi. SCHEWE indicated that in the meantime

je would conduct some research in this matter.

On 3/12/75, Mr. SCHEWE advised that he had

conducted some research relative to our telephone call

on 3/10/75, and inquired if we could be more specific

with regard to the

dates of the information desired.

"SCHENE

was advised that to the best of our knowledge the

conversation we were interested in involving FRANKLIN D.

-ROOSEVELT (FDR, HULL and Mr. HOOVER, occurred on

approximately 8/24-26/36 and that the conversation concerned

the internal security of the US.

dated 8/24/36, (copy of which is

attached) on White House stationery, classified "Confidential

which are

for the Secretary of State, unsigned, undated and

recommending coordination of activities of all agents

of the Government in foreign countries.

SCHEWE advised

## Page 11

that the synopsis of this memorandum which appears on,

the

"buck slip" was the usual practice at that time to

Identify the documents attached to it. SCHEWE added.

that this was the only document he was able to locate

which may have some bearing on the desired information.

SCHEVE stated that the possibility exists that the

referred to memorandum may be located

among the collection

of papers of CORDELL HULL which are now stored at the

Library of Congress, Washington, D.C:

Mr. SCHEWE then exhibited to interviewing personnel

the White House Ushers Appointment Book which was

hand-written and kept on a daily basis.

This appointment

book contained the following pertinent information:

Thursday, August 13, 1936, at 9:50 AM

FDR departed the White House for a visit

to the flood areas in NY, Ohio and Pennsyl-

• vania.

Thursday, August 24, 1936, FDR returned.

to White

House at 8:45 AM.

9:20 AM FDR met with Mr. HOOVER from

9:20 AM to 10:12 AM.

(Note * - There is no entry in this book

for Aug. 24, 1936, indicating that Mr.

HULL was there.

Mr. SCHEWE advised that

It is interesting to note that. FDR met

Mr. HOOVER in his residence in the White

House on 8/24/36, prior to leaving for

his office in the White House:

SCHEWE

also pointed out that this meeting was

significant since FDR met with Mr. HOOVER

on 8/24/36, immediately after returning

from an extended trip.

This, according

to SCHEVE was a departure from FDR's

usual practice.

There was no record in the White House

Usher's Appointment Book for 8/25/36, which would indicate

that FDR met with either Mr. HULL Or Mr. HOOVER on that

date. This book indicates that FDR departed the White

House on Tuesday, 8/25/75, at 12:40 PM for a trip to the

draught areas, in upper Maine, South Dakota and North

Sorroi gets

Dakota, as well as a visit to Mt. Rushmore.

FDR did not

return to the White House until Sunday, Sept. 6, 1936,'

at 10:02 AM.

The White House Usher's Appointment Book

further reflects that FDR, during the period July 10,

1936, to Aug. 10, 1936, was away from the white House

campaigning.

FDR returned to the White House on

2/10/30, and remained there until 0/13/30, when he

igain departed on a trip and returned on 8/24/36.

FDR also departed from the White House on 8/25/36,

and returned on 9/6/36.

Mr. SCHEWE also produced to interviewing

personnel the appointment book of FDR's private secretary,

GRACE TULLY for the pertinent period.

This appointment book

reflects all of FDR's office appointments.

A review

of this appointment book fails to reflect that FDR met

or had an appointment with Mr. HOOVER in his office

during the period 8/13/36 to 9/0/36. However, this

• appointment book does reflect that during this period

FDR did have a meeting with CORDELI HULL On 8/25/36,

at 1:00 PM.

Mr. SCHEWE further advised that he personally

reviewed

"the following and was unable to locate any

documents or references which could possibly shed some

light on the matter of interest to us:

1.) Papers kept in FDR's safe:

2.) Papers kept by his secretary in a separate

White House safe.

3.) Papers kept In FDR's official presidential

file.

4.)

Papers kept in FDR's alphabetical file

maintained by his secretary.

5.) Individual agencies filés.

6.) J. EDGAR HOOVER's file.

7.) ' Attorney General's file.

8.) Assistant Attorney General's file.

9.) National security file.

10: Internal Security file.

11.) FBI file.

In conclusion; Mr. _ SCHEWE stated that after

reviewing all of the above data, he concluded that the

pertinent document of interest

to us is not at the FDR

Library at Hyde Park, N1.

SCHEWE added that if any

such document is at the Library,

it is misfiled and

as there are approximately 21 million pages of manuscripts

and documents

at the Library, it would be impossible

to locate same.

It is to be noted that on the enclosed

"buck slip" there are four penciled notations, 1.e.

285-C, X20, X285 and X67..

SCHENE Stated that

these

nottions are part of the

FDR Library cross-reference

system.

SCHEWE added that he checked these refereness

and could locate nothing further regarding the matter

of interest to us.

SCHEWE stated that these references

pertained to the enclosed "buck slip"

Telebhone Rm

On 2/6/75 Mr. Kelley and I met with Senator Church

and Bill Miller, Staff Director of the Senate Select Committee.

Senator Church pointed out that he intended to run the Committee in

FAR iS TON

a very responsible manner, had no intention of destroying or impairing

the effectiveness of the intelligence community and, in fact, hoped that

the efforts of the Committee would help to reestablish public confidence

in the intelligence agencies.

Parameters have not been drawn but Senator Church feels that

the Committee will contine its activities largely to inquiries into domestic

activities. The inquiries will be designed to determine whether agencies

have acted outside the law and the type of remedial legislation necessary

to prevent such abuses in the future.

Study will be largely concerned with the activities of the Central

Intelligence Agency but will, of course, involve the FBI and other agencies

involved in domestic'intelligence.

The Committee hopes to have a nonpartisan staff of approximately

40 employees headed up by Mr. Miller and would appreciate having necessary

background investigations expedited to permit an early clearance. Miller

indicated he has already been in touch with Mr. Hotis and Mr. Bowers in

this regard. It was explained that the contemplated procedure involved the

FBI conducting the full-field investigation necessary with the results being

furnished to the Chairman, after which he would, upon being personally

satisfied as to their loyalty, furnish the results to CIA for final clearance.

Senator Church appeared satisfied with this arrangement. He stated that

he wanted to prevent leaks and be hopefully as successful as the Judiciary

Committee was on the impeachment inquiry. Our experience in this regard

was pointed out wherew the Judiciary Committee in connection with the 17

Re: SENSTUDY 1975

information available they would afford it appropriate security restricted

to members only, excluding staft, and would not make the information

public. Subsequent to the hearings, the Committee published its report

which contained our classified documents right along with the Top Secret

classifications. Senator Church was not aware of this, appeared surprised

by it, and stated surely the information must have been declassified. I

advised him that not by us and it was our information.

Senator Church was asked whether in his opinion the formation

of the Select Committee would have any effect on the proliferation of

committees seeking to obtain testimony from the FBI and it was his opinion

that this would have a favorable effect.

He said he had been in touch with

other members of the Senate who felt that it was a waste of time to have

repetitious testimony on the same subject matter before a variety of

committees and he had the feeling that the other committees would hold off

until after the Senate Select Committee completed its hearings. He indicated

that he could not vouch for what would happen in the House, however, he

intended to speak to the House leadership in order to try to effect some

coordinated approach there also, because he was well aware of the large

number of committees seeking to provide oversight or obtain information

from the intelligence agencies.

A question arose as to the extent of cooperation with the Committee

and Senator Church was assured that the FBI would be completely responsive

subject to certain limitations which would have to be delineated by the

President in order to protect sensitive sources and information. Senator

Church indicated that he was going to talk to the President in this regard in

order to secure his complete cooperation, and it was Senator Church's feeling

that the Committee should be entitled to answers to any questions they might

ask without restriction other than, of course, the identities of informants.

He felt the progress of the Committee would be severely impaired if it were

necessary to go to Court over such questions to obtain enforcement of their

right to have access to whatever information they need.

ACTION:

MEMORANDUM FOR: USIB Principals

SUBJECT:

Community Aspects of Inputs to Congressional

Committees Investigating Intelligence

1. The Intelligence Community Staff, with John M. Clarke,

Associate Deputy/IC, as my representative in these matters, will

keep the Board and other appropriate officials advised as to

progress of the investigations conducted by the Senate and Fouse

• Select Committees investigating intelligence activities. In particular,

it will ensure that we are kept informed as to materials which are

formally being provided to the Select Committees by all elements

of the Community. The USIB Ad Hoc Group will assist on this

, matter and provide the mechanism for regular and constant communi-

cations.

2. In response to this assignment, the Intelligence Community

Staff is establishing a registry for documentation relating to the

investigations. This registry will be a source of reference of all

responses, testimony, et cetera, provided by USIB agencies and

available to your designated representatives.

3. In order to make the registry useful to the Board, it is

essential that it include:

a. File copies of documents or other materials which

each Intelligence Community elément provides to one of the

Select Committees where the originating agency considers

the materials to involve aspects of Community activities,

and/or which may result in follow-on queries concerning

the functioning of the Community. The availability of this

documentation will be of particular importance il it is

expected there will be subscquent inquiries relating to the

materials provided and involving elements of the Community

other than the originating clement.

Mr. L. Frank Schwartz

Federal Bureau of Investigation

Room 4637

Washington, D. C.

Dear Frank:

ALL FECINSORIACION CON BATTED

UNET IS ONCEAGUNEH

Reference is your request for comments on the sample

abstracts prepared in the FBI as a report on materials being

provided to the Senate Select Committee.

As you know, we want to make the Community Registry as

complete a record as possible of what is provided to the

Committee, and for this reason hope that the actual copy of

special reports and particularly important documents will be

provided to the Registry.

Where this is not done, an abstract

or summary of each document or homogenous set of documents.

We have amended the abstract format slightly to include

an entry for "Document Classification."

A copy of the

amended

format is enclosed.

Your sample abstracts require a few alterations to make

them more "indexable."

a.

Item 1, "TITLE/SUBJECT" refers to the subject

matter of the material which is being provided. The

abstract on the FBI Manual of Instructions should have

an entry here something like "Instructions covering FBI

Investigations in the Security Field," rather than the

title of the Senate Committee.

b.

The date at the head of the page should be

the date of preparation of the abstract.

The date of

submission to the Committee is listed at Item 9.

c.

The entry "ORIGINATING ORGANIZATION" identified

the organization with authority to release the document.

ENCIOSURE

62-110-375-992

---

## Page 31

d.

The "SUMMARY OF CONTENTS" section should

be brief, but also should clearly indicate what is

being provided to the Committee.

I wonder, for

instance, whether your sample on the letterhead

memoranda was issued in widely separated time periods.

The summary as written gives no indication as to

the particular subject of any of the memoranda and the

single sentence now used to describe all of them covers

the waterfront.

e.

If the request for information comes officially

from the committee, the Committee title should be entered

under "REQUESTOR,

but if the requestor is an individual

member of the Staff, his name should be indicated.

f.

The last entry in the format, "PROBLEM AREAS,"

has particular significance since it is important to

know if there are Third Agency, or sources and methods,

or other sensitivity problems involved, and this is

the place to identify them.

We are beginning to use

the abstracts prepared in our office as an aid to

obtaining release clearance when we are dealing with

the document for which another agency must concur ir

the release.

The "PROBLEM AREAS"

section gives such

other agency an idea as to whether we see any important

reason why they should be concerned about release of

the document.

The entry in this final section of the

format is expected to prove useful for this purpose.

5.

One copy of the document or its abstract is all

that is needed by the registry.

6. The mailing address of the registry is:

FROM The Attorney General

SURJECTNICROPHONE SURVEILIANGI

155-20

Ine recent decision of the Supreme Court entitled Irvine v.

California, 347 U.S. 128, denouncing the use of microphone surveillances

by city police in a gambling casa makes appropriate a reappraisal of

the use which may be made in the future by the Federal Bureau oi

Investigation of microphone surveillance in connection with matters

relating to the internal security of the country..

It is clear that in some instances the use of microphone

cuivilianão is the only passings may of uncoverina the activities

a sepionaga agents, mssinle sahnteurs, and subversive persons. In

such instances I an of the opinion that the national interest requizes

that microphone cumeillance be utilized by the Federal Bureau of

Investagation.

This use need not be limited to the development of

ovidence for prosecution. The FBI has an intelligence function in

connection with interal security matters equally as important as

the duty of developing evidence for presentation to the courts and

the national security requires that the FBI be able to use microphone

surveillance for the proper discharge of both of such functions.

The Department of Justice approves the use of microphone surveillance

by the fBI under these circumstances and for these purposes.

I do not consider thät the decision of the Supreme Court

in Irvine v. Califomia, supra, requires a allierent course. inat

case is readily distinguishable on its facts. The language oi the

Couct, however, indicates certain uses of microphones which it would

be tell to avoid, if possible, even in internal security investiga-

It is quite clear that in the Irvine case the justices of the

Supreme Court were outraged by what they regarded as the indecency of

installing à microphone in a bedroom. They denounced the utilization

of such rethods of investigation in a gambling case as shocking. The

Court's action is a clear incication of the need for discretion and

intelligent restraint in the use of microphones by the ibi in all

cases, including internal security matters. Obviously, the insialla-

tion of a microphone in a bedroom or ir. some comparably intimate

Location should be avoided wherever possible. It may appear, however,

that important intelligence or evidence relating to metter connected

with the national. security can only be obtained by the installation oi

a micropione in such a location.

It is my opinion that under such

circustances the installation is proper and is not prohibited by the

•Supreme Court's decision in the Irvine case:

NW 88608-Docld:32989628 Page 43

---

## Page 44

Previous interpretations which have been furnished to you

as to what may constitute trespass in the installation of microphones,

suggest that the viers expressed have been tentative in nature and

have attempted to precict the course which courts would follow

rather than reflect the present state of the law.

It is realized

that not infrequently the question of trespass arises in connection

with the installation of a microphone. The question of whether a

trespass is actually involved and the second question of the effect

of such a trespass upon the acmissibility in court of the evidence thus

obtained, must necessarily be resolved according to the circumstances

of each case.

in connection with the use of nicrophone suveillance will review the

circumstances in each case in the light of the practical necessities

of investigation and of the national interest which must be protected.

It Is my opinion that the Departnent should adopt that interpretation

which will permit microphone covarage by the FBI in a manner most

conducive to our national interest

I recognize that for the FBI.

to fulfill its important intelligence function, considerations of

internal securitv and the national safety are paramount and, there-

Reference Legal Counsel to J. B. Adams memorandum

dated 3/20/75 captioned as above and letter of Senator Frank Church

dated 3/19/75.

Relet requested, among other things, the titles and number

collection and/or counterintelligence matters, operations or activities,

together with the percent of total agent man-hours devoted to such matters,

operations and activities ( page 3, item ITiC of relet).

The purpose of this memorandum is to forward to the Legal

Re: Senate Select Committee on

Intelligence Activities

ADDENDUM: Intelligence Division, WOC:aso, 4/4/75

The Intelligence Division has reviewed the attached figures

prepared by the Administrative Division. Under the criteria of the current

Classification Act it would be impossible to justify classification of these

figures; however, should they be made public or fall into the hands of a

hostile foreign intelligence service, it would reveal the current capability

the t'B employs in the field of counterintelligence against the total foreign

threat. In view of the above, the Intelligence Division strongly recommends

that the Legal Counsel Division discuss this with the staff of the Senate

Select Committee pointing out the vulnerability implicit in this attachment

in an effort to have the Committee withdraw its request identified as III C.

ADDENDUM: LEGAL COUNSEL DIVISION

PVD: Aks 4: 4-14-75

Regarding the observations of the Intelligence Division

concerning the making available the amount of manpower dedicated to

counterintelligence and domestic intelligence work in the FBI, the

Legal Counsel Division has the following observations:

of

classes

(1) Based on our analysis and conversations this

Division has had with Fred B. Griffith of the Inspection Division, it

Collar appears that the information contained in this memorandum may be

classified confidential under Executive order 11652.

(2) Before making any determination as to whether we

make such information available to the Senate Select Committee, it

would appear we should determine from CIA what their response to

such a request will be so that our position and that of CIA will be

consistent in this area. In this regard SA Paul V. Daly has contacted

Leon F. Schwartz, Liaison Section of Intelligence Division, and requested

he determine from CIA what their position in this regard is.

(3) It is not believed that we should take a hard and fast

position that this information not be made available to the Committee or

that we make an effort to have the Committee withdraw their request for

this information. We should rather develop some fallback position such

as that this information will be made available to the Chairman of the

Committee or will be made available during an oral briefing, etc.

entitled "Senate Select Committee on Intelligence

ACtivities" forwarded to the Intelligence Division for review

Director Soc'y —

the titles and numbers of FBI field office Agents assigned to

internal security, intelligence collection, and/or counter-

intelligence matters, operations or activities. This was in response

to requirement IIIC of Senator Church's letter

dated 3/19/75.

By addendum dated 4/4/75 the Intelligence Division

recommended that the Legal Counsel Division discuss with the

staff of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) our reluctance to

provide these type figures to the SSC.

On 4/11/75 I discussed with Mr. John Clark, Associate

Deputy to the Director of Central Intelligence for the intelligence

community, the request of Senator Church.

Specifically, Mr. Clark

was asked

members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence

Activities were briefed by Assistant Director Wannall and

members of his staff in the Conference Room at INTD.

Briefed

from the Committee were Mr. William Miller, Staff Director;

Mr • Frederick A. O. Schwarz III, Chief Counsel; and

Messrs. Mark Gitenstein, Marvin

Epstein, Patrick Shea, Britt

Snider and Loch Johnson, all staff members,

The first hour of the briefing was occupied with

the showing of

the INTD slide presentation and commentary

which provided

highlights of the work of the In,

the counterintelligence and internal security field.

Following

this presentation a question and answer period ensued for the

rest of the briefing. Mr. Miller and Mr. Schwarz posed most

of the questions.

In the counterintelligence field the thrust of the

questioning was directed toward the continuing growth of the

hostile intelligence presence in the United States and its

short-term and long-tem etfect on the fBI's operations.

Mr. Wannall pointed out that the Director on previous occasions

had indicated his intention to "beef up" the counterintelligence

effort of the FBI by the addition of some 250 Special Agents,

and that INTD had also effected certain programs designed to

assign certain counterintelligence functions to non-Agent

personnel, thereby freeing additional special Agents to function

as case officers.

In response to a question as to whether the

additional investigative effort necessary to counter the

mounting hostile intelligence threat might not involve investi

gation of more and more American citizens, ur wannall concedee

that this was inevitable.

He stressed, however, the investi-

gative policies of the FBI which protected the constitutional

rights and right of privacy of such individuals,

On the domestic internal security side the thrust

of the questioning appeared to indicate an interest in the

predication, duration and administrative controls of investi-

gations of domestic organizations and individuals.

Again,

Wannall stressed the precautions inherent in FBI policy

and instructions to the field in these matters, pointing out,

in effect, that these investigations are founded on statutory

authority

and are closely supervised by experienced personnel

at Headquarters level.

The Committee staff appeared to accept

these answers and no critical or hostile attitudes on their

part were evident.

The briefing was terminated at 12:20 pm, due to

commitments on the part of the staff. Mr. Miller and

hiT.

Schwarz both

expressed their appreciation for the briefing

and indicated it had been most instructive, They indicated

a desire to continue these discussions at some later date and

Mr. Wannall assured them that he would be happy to continue

the briefing at any future mutually agreeable time.

Perhaps most significant of all questions posed was

the

final question by Mx. Schwarz in which he inquired as to

advantages and disadvantages to the FBI could be anticipated

as a result of the Committee fulfilling its mandate, Mr. Wannall

replied that any statutory authority defining and affirming the

FBI's role in the intelligence collection field would certainly

be a positive achievement,

He also stated that any result of

the Committee's investigation which would tend to limit the

investigative resources or the investigative effectiveness of

the FBI would surely be an unfortunate negative factor.

You requested analysis of the legal authority for FBI

criminal intelligence collection and its relationship to ou statutory

jurisdiction in criminal matters.

"The gathering of criminal intelligence information"

describes activity not subject to precise definition. However, its

general objective is well understood by those engaged in law entorcement.

Thers exist individuals and groups whose daily occupations are directed

toward profit without regard to the restraints of the law.

Tei, dy the

very nature of their associations. little actual particivation in criminal

acts may be observed by the most astute law enforcement observer.

Their existence and contribution to the sum of criminal behavior. has been

detected and to some degree measured by the collection of data concerring

their personalife-sijles, property holdings, associates, influence, and

access to capital. Such information has been characterized as "criminal

intelligence."

For years, the FBI has been aware of the need to identify

these resources of the criminal element. Congress responded to this

need through the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970. The Congressional

findings were that organized crime in the United States is a highly

sophisticated, diversified, and widespread activity that annually drains

billions of dollars trom America's economy by unlawful conduct and by

the illegal use of force, fraud and corruption. Legitimate business and

labor unions are infiltrated and corrupted and our democratic processes

are subverted. The problem was declared lo be of of national concern

both as to our economy and the domestic security.

Memorandun J. A. Mintz to Mr. Dalbey

RE: FBI JURISDICTION: CRIMINAL

INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION

The Act attempted to attack organized crime by making

criminal the management of syndicated gambling and by prohibiting

rackctecring activity charactcristic of organized crime including the

use of illegal proceeds for investment in legitimate business enterprises.

The long-established suspicions of law enforcement officers

were confirmed by the Congressional findings but statutory enactments

did not eliminate the conduct described as evil therein. There remains

the task of establishing the identities of those constituting the national

menace and developing prosecutable evidence of their guilt.

• "Criminal

intelligence" collection is one moans by which this responsibility may

be fulfilled. It may be the only practical means in view of the scarcity

of witnesses willing to testify and of the high mortality potential of those

who do appear. A classic example of such intimidation is reported in

United States v. Addonizio, 451 E2d 49 (3rd Car. 1972) where a pruspecie

sonitoo

•acad in 2202=

ten case found an anonymale onto on the cost of his

car which read 'This could have been a bomb. Keep your mouth shut."

Accepting the need for intelligence gathering as a practical

necessity, the issue remains as to its propriety in the face of Constitutional

protections. If the Supreme Court announces that individuals have a

Constitutionally protected right of privacy that may be overcome only

through established arrest, search, and subpoena procedures, the issue

will be settled. But, thus far, the Court has only drawn upon the concept

of Constitutional privacy to resolve cases involving special circumstances

such as marital aifairs (Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965) ) and

interception of communications (Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967)

More specific Constitutional limitations on the criminal

intelligence function may be found in the First Amendment protections of

speech and assembly; the Fourth Amendment prohibitions of unreasonabie

searches and seizures; and the Fifth Amendment privilege against

compulsory self-incrimination.

The theme consistently found in decisions having a bearing on thi

relationship between these rights and the collection of criminal intellige ce

is that, when in direct conflict, the collection efforts must yield. Such is

not to label criminal intelligence as necessarily the product of malpractice.

but to recognize the paramount nature of the Constitutional interests being

safeguarded. Other incidents of government regulatory authority have

been required to yield as well when confronted with legitimate claims of

Constitutional protection, e.g. the administrative search cases, Camara v.

Municipal Court, 387 U.S. 523 (1967).

Overt and obtrusive conduct susceptible of being characterized

as harassment may well be enjoined as, for example, was the case of an

obvious 24-hour-2-day physical surveillance of an individual, his home,

relatives, friends, and associates (Giancana v. Johnson, 335 F2d 356

(7th Cir. 1964) cert. den. 379 U.S. 1001.

Similar results might be

expected where an identilied officer loiters in the subject's place of

business (Bee See Books. Inc. v. Leary, 291 F. Supp. 622 (SD N. Y. 1968)

or openly attends organizational meetings where nis presence inhibiis

romaninátina and tha francontina of the hucinode of the accomily (Tarai

309, United Furniture Workers v. Gates. 75 F. Supp. 620 (ND Ind. I9÷ò) ).

However, open photographic suveillance of public gatherings (Donahos v.

Duling, 330 F. Supp. 308 (ED Va. 1971)) and secret monitoring of

criminal activities through the use of undercover agents (Lewis V. United

States,

385 U.S. 206 (1966)) and informants (Hoffa v. United States, 385

U.S. 295 (1966) ) have met with judicial approval.

Obviously, criminal intelligence information gained by un-

reasonable search and seizure or through compelled self-incrimination is

tainted and subject to judicial condemnation upon complaint of one having

the requisite standing.

Perhaps, the decision coming ncarest to discussing the

legality of criminal intelligence collection was Anderson v. Sills. 106 N.J.

Super. 545, 256 A2d 298 (1069), (reversed on the ground more complic

record was necded to support the decision) 56 N.J. 210, 205 A2d 678 (1970).

New Jersey had responded to the threat of continuing civil disorcers by

collecting intelligence information on persons and events alleged to have

some rolationship to such activities. The trial court held the collection

effort to be unconstitutional because it conflicted with the First Amendment.

RE: FBI JURISDICTION: CRIMINAL

However, the court order to destroy the intelligence files excepted instances

"where such information will be used to charge persons with specifically

defined criminal conduct." 256 A2d at 305. Thus, the decision may be

interpreted as drawing a distinction between collection of intelligence

information where political or social factors are involved and First

Amendment freedoms therefore may be directly inhibited and collection

of criminal intelligence information where the objective is the establishment

of criminal conduct and the identitics of the offenders. While the Fourth

and Fifth Amendment may be enjoyed by the guilty and innocent alike, it

is improbable that the First Amendment would be stretched so far as to

protect freedom of speech and assembly when such speech and assembly

constitute elements of a criminal offense. On appeal, the Supreme Court

of New Jersey returned the case for further development of the record

and observed "

it reasonably believes to be necessary to enabie it to perform the police

roles, detectional and preventive.

A tentative conclusion may be stated, subject to further develop-

ment of the case law.. The gathering of criminal intelligence information

for the purpose of developing evidence of specific offenses characteristic

of organized crime is legally justified as well as practically necessary.

Where there is diversion from the proper objective and such collection

efforts are manipulated to cause harassment or where such activity conflicts

with Constitutional rights, to that extent the criminal intelligence program

must be reformed.

FBI AUTHORITY IN DOMESTIC

#MDR16

ATI, INTORNATION CONTAINED

UTEIN IS UNCLASSES ALICA

411-18-0/BT

You requested an analysis of the Bureau's authority to conduct

domestic intelligence investigations. The question of the jurisdictional

basis for these investigations is being examined at length by the Domestic

Intelligence Division and will not be discussed here.

It is fair to say that the domestic intelligence program is one

of the more controversial areas of the Bureau's activities.

For one thing,

an intelligence investigation casts a broader net than inquiries that are

diricted toward the pront of a specitic offense. A large amount of raw data

is collected, much of which has no immediate bearing on potential offenses

or offenders. But seemingly trivial information may later become important

in the detection and prevention of violence or civil disorder. There are

also fears that these investigations may eventually touch upon one's

political belieis, habits or associations; or that information collected for

proper purposes may eventually be misused at the hands of Government.

Each is a legitimate concern. The notion of Government prying into the

personal lives of its citizens is repellent to all of us. And yet there is a

strong sense that the Government must acquire necessary intelligence

information if it is to meet its responsibilities in connection ith the

national security.

One of the major concerns about our domestic intelligence

activities is that they are not supervised or monitored by any outside

agency. The claim is made that the Executive Branch has been left wide

discretion to define its own authority, and to choose the directions, mothods,

and focus of its investigations: For one thing, the law has never made

clear what facts and circumstances must be present to authorize an

intelligence investigation, nor how far such an investigation may lawiully

proced without being directed toward proof of a specific offense.

Hotis to Mr. Dalbey

RE: FBI AUTHORITY IN DOMESTIC

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS

And unlike the practice in criminal cases, our clectronic surveillances in

security matters are not submitted for prior court approval.

For another,

the exclusionary rule which provides the usual mcthod of judicial control

over investigative procedures, is not often availuble in secuity cases.

Since the goal is largely preventive, these cases seldom come before the

courts. As a result, the public, the courts, and the Congress have very

little information about how we operate in domestic intelligence matters.

and what we do with the information acquired.

In response to this situation, some members of the Congress have

pressured for tighter controls over the Bureau, perhaps in the form of a

tch smite to ever sott eating as to evin pa chairs

concern about the right of privacy and the authority of the Government ic

gather information, In an exchange of correspondence with the Department

of Justice, the Senator has requested specific documentation of the

Department's guidelines for the gathering and retention of domestic

intelligence information. He has also suggested that legisiation mighi e

enacted, requiring a showing of probable cause before an investigation can

be initiated by the Government. It is doubtful that any such measure would

pass the Congress, but the proposal does show the mood of the times.

A parallol trend may be developing in the courts. In several

recent cases, plaintiffs have made the claim that Government information

gathering, which goes beyond the effort to apprehend criminal suspects,

may have a "chilling cffect" on the exercise of First Amendment rights.

These challenges thus far have not been successful. Anderson v. Sills,

56 N. J. 210, 265 A2d 678 (1970); Donahoe v. Duling, 330 F. Supp. 308

(E.D. Va. 1971); American Civil Libertics Union v. Westmorcland, 323

F. Supp. 1153 (N. D. Ill. 1971).

The courts have generally recognized that one of the principal

functions of the Burcau is to gather information law violators, agitators of

violence and possible subversives.

to Fir'st Amendmentrights. Thus, in Davis v. Ichord, 442 F2d 1207 (D. C.

Cir. 1970) although appellants allegedly felt chilled by a Congressional

Committce's investigation of them, the Court of Appeals found there was

insufficient justiciability in their claims to create a viable case or

controversy. This was because appellants had "failed to bring the fear of

Investigation by the present Committze home to themselves,' their foars

were wholly speculative; there were no criminal proceedings confronting

them; nor was any action pending. Moreover, the Court in Davis lound

that the power of a Congressional Committee began and ended with the

investigation; whenever a Committee of the Congress seeks punitive action,

the Judiciary must become involved, and thus every investigation has a

judicial check which operates to guarantee the protection of constitutional

rights.

This latter aspect of the Davis decision was given perspocare y

the Court of Appeals in Tatum. In contrasting the potential impact on First

Amendment rights occasioned by investigations conducted by the military

with investigations conducica by a civilian investigative agency, such as the

Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Court observed:

The compilation of data by a civilian investigative

agency is thus not the threat to civil liberties or the

deterrent on the exercise of the constitutional right

of free speech that such action by the military is, because

a civil investigative agency has no inherent power always

being subject to the well-defined restrictions of law and

the approval of the courts. * **

There,the Colit pantedly examined the "source of the chill" as it had in

apprchensions. In this connection the Court stated,

Mcmorandum J. B. Hotis to Mr. Dalbey

RE: FBI AUTIIORITY IN DOMESTIC

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS

Referring to our holding in Davis that the

"source of the chill"' is important in determining whether

there is any inhibiting etfect on the exercise of First

Amendment rights, we think that there is a significant

difference between investigative actions taken by a

military agency in reference to civilians and similar

investigative actions taken by a regular investigative

agency of a civilian branch of the Government.

One of the functions of a civilian investigative

agency, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, is

to compile information on law violators, agitators of

violence, and possible subversives. It has always been

recognized that this is a delicate function, and it is

exercised under the direction of the Attorney General.

Investigation is performed by men a majority oê whom de

under the direction of lawyers in the Justice Department,

and the information compiled is only usable and effective

through court action. The FBI is powerless to imprison

or to affect his liberty in any way except through the

action of the courts.

As to the surveillance of public meetings through the use of

informants, it has been held that such surveillance is not per se actionable.

See Donahoc V. Duling, 330 F. Supp. 308 (E.D. Va. 1971) (police

surveillance of stree: demonstrations held not to offend First Amendment

rights).

The Supreme Court in Hoffa v. U.S., 385 U.S. 293 (1900), held

that the use of secret informants is "not per se unconstitutional"

not violate the fifth Amendmont privilege against selt-inorimination, soes

the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unrcasonable searches and

seizures. The Court upheld, as reasonable under the Fourth Amendment,

admission at trial of evidence obnined by an undercover informant to whom

a defendant spoke without knowlodge that he was in the employ of the policc.

385 U.S. at 300-303. Sce also Lewis v. U.S., 385 U.S. 200 (196G) and

Lopcz v. U.S., 373

U.S. 127 (1963). .

Memorandum J. B. Hotis to Mr. Dalbey

RE: FBI AUTIIORITY IN DOMESTIC

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS

Moreover, the Supreme Court in U.S. v. White, 401 U.S. 745

(1971), recently held that the use of secret informants does not violate

any constitutionally justifiable expectation of privacy under the Fourth

Amendment, even when an informant uses electronic equipment to transmit

his conversations with defendants to other agents.

If the use of undercover government informants without a

warrant does not violate the Fourth Amendment and invade a defendant's

constitutionally justifiable expectations of privacy, Hoffa v. U.S., supra.

and such informants may write down their conversations with deiendants

and testify concerning them. or simultaneously record and transnit such

conversations to others,

who may testify against them, On Lce v. U.S.,

313VeS 290192) TS. V white surry then clearly pere visual s

would not violate their constitutional rights.

I would seem that those who elect to present their views actively

in the public arena deliberately expose themselves to the public. See

Associated Press v. Walker, 308 U.s. 130 (1967). Any recording of their

activities by the delendants does not invade their privacy any more than

does a newspaper, radio, or television story, and, indeed, much less since

any information compiled is usable and effective only through court action.

Tatum v. Laird, 111 E2d 947, 957 (D. C. Cir. 1971).

More difficult questions are presented where the investigation

delves into the privato affair's of the individuals or organizations. Bụt

even here, the courts have generally sustained our procedures so long as

they comport with the restrictions of the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments.

Re: FBI AUTHORITY IN DOMESTIC

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS

In summary, it is premature to say that the First Amendment

line of cases, dealing with the "chilling" concept offers any substantial

impediment to our intelligence investigations. There is less reason for

optimism, however, with regard to congressional intervention. We

should be prepared

therefore, to meet arguments regarding the need

for outside supervision. The sound answer, which should satisfy

governmental needs and individual rights, is found in tight internal

controls and carefully developed guidelines.

The criteria and guldelines for TbI investigations

the "I. B. I. Handbook," and in Letters to all Special Agents

in Charge. In addition, ins: -dons and guidance are given

to the lield in Headquarters commuxications on specific cases.

Compliance with criterianis gulaclines is obtained by super

vision in both the liold and at Bureau loadquazters. In

addition, regular inspections or field and Headquarters

Divicions assure that Bureau policies concerning investiga

tions are baing lollowed.

in the security field, the basic responsibility of

the rei is to

investlgate revolutionary organizations dedicated

to the violoni overthrow or destruction of the United states

Government. These include old line Marsist groups, for example,

the Connunist, Party, USA, and the Trotskyist Socialist Workers

Party; and such new revolutionary groups as the Students for

a Democratic Society, the Black Panther Party and the Weatherman.

identification of intelligence operations and agents;

(2) the penetration of these operations for the purpose

of coptrol and the development of intelligonce infornation;

(8) neutralization of hostile intelligence operations through

disruption and disinformation; and, (4) prosecution. Whatever

the

assigned priority, the overall objective is to deny access

to intormation soughi by whatever pirotical menns are availnble.

Foroign intelligence investigations are grounded in

the Espionage statute and solated lows including the Registra-

ELon and Atonic Energy Acis. Individual Investigations are

initiated usually on the busis of a known or suspected connec

tion with a foreign intelligence service, foreigh country or

subversive organization vich such connections. Since these

investigations emanate iron various sensitive sources and.

involve special considerations, extensive criteria and

limitations are defined and enumerated in current instructions.

In genernl terns, the governing criteria are designed

¿o preclude initiation and continuanco of investigations which

ALL INFORMATION CONTAIUED

HERETN IS UNCLASSIFIED

DATE 2-18-01 BASP BALISTG

During our mnecting on July 29, 1973, you referred to a discussion

you liad with Sonator Charles McC. Nathias, Jr., of Marylond during Your con-

firmation hearings ns to the statutory authority of the FBI and the Departnent of

justce in the liold of domestic intelligence investigations. You then asted

lin'. Wiltium D. luckolshous to work with the FBI in weighing the pros and cons

with regard to statutory authority in this area. I mentioned that research wes

touch with fir. luckelehous with regard to this natter when we have completed

the realis of our concideration and lindings within the FBI.

Actually, a study has been going on in the FBI for more than two.

years as to the scope of ful jurisdietion and authority, in domestic intelligence

investigations. When Mir. Li Patrick Gray, Ill, was designuted as Acting

Dircotor of the FBI; he instructed that a position paper be prepared concern-

ing the jurisdiction and authority of the FDI to conduct domestic intelligence

investigations. A position paner was prepared wlich in essence sinted that

authorty of the M3l in this field is bosed on legislntive enactments, even

though we may have publicly relicd hcavily on Fresidential directives as the

basis for such authority. Mr. Gray ordered an in-depth study made of the

position and in August, 1972, a detailod report was furnishod to him. The

following is a summary of that report.

Over a period of several inonths there were a number of public

stateilients questioning authority and jurisdiction of the FBI to conduct comestic

intelligence-type investigutions, particularly where there is no clear-cut

legislative authority apparent. One of the most soniching inquiries was con-

tained in a paper presented by Professor John T. SUe ata dye-sley conference

at Frinecton University in October, 1911, sponsored by the Commitlee for Public

Justice.

The Attorney General

A major thrust of Professor Elliff's paper concorned FBI authority

derived from legislative enactments as opposed to that derived from Presidential

directives, beginning with a directive issued by President Foosevelt in

September, 1939. Professor Elliff is of the opinion that the 1039 directive,

which was r'eiterated on three subsequeht occasions, was negnifica by the

FBi from ils original purpose to a detinitive order to conduct inteiligence-type

investigations.

Senator Sam 2. Ervin, as you know, had been probing into the

nature and extont of rial intelligonco-type investigations. Sonator Ervin had

even announced that he intended to provose legislation to prohibit the rBI

from Investigating any person without that indivicual's concent, unless the

Government has roason to believo that person hus committed a crime or' is

about to commit a crime. Other Congreesmen indicated a similar intcrost

in Fist investicative activitics.

Our study rovealed that the FBi had declared publicly over a

long period of time thai its responcibilities in the domestic intelligence ficid

are authorized under logisintive enactments, Yresidential directives, und

instructions of the Attornoy General, 'The Presidentiai dircotives axe bviously

the 1) directive dated September 6, 1039, and reiterated January 8, 1043;

July 24, 1050; and Decembos 10, 1953, and 2) Exocutive Order 10450 ciated

Apil 26, 1053 (and anonded bui not yet implemented by Executive Order

21005 dated July 2, 1971) •

In carefully analyzing the language of the first directive, dated

September ê, 1939, and considering that the subsequent dircetives are all

hinged on that ohe, we believe that there is a misconception as to the extent

of jurisdiction or authority conveyed lo the till by these directives. It

appears that while the 1530 directive fixed Peoponsibility on the FbI to hondic

espionage, sabotage, and neutrality matters, it did not convey any authority

or jurisdiction which the Fill did not already have from legislative enactients.

It is ditficult to read into this dircctive or in any of those which followed any

authority to conduct intolligence-type investigations which would or could

120t be conducted under un umbrella of legislative enactments.

As & matter of historical fact, Prosident Roosevelt in August,

1936, did request formor Director d. Edgar licover to conduct investigations

of subversive activities in this country, including communion and fasciem.

This request, however, was & confirential oral roquest and there is doubt

that any record of it woo made outride the FM. This request, or Presidential

mandato, was based, incidontally, on the faet that the lew provided that the

IBl could conduct such invostigations if the Sccrutary of state should so

reguest.

The study rovenled that while the 1039 ct seq. dirceliver did not

grent any special intelligence-gatbering authority io the REI, we were respon-

sible under these direcsives to gellect all intelligence intormation furnished

by local, stute, and Esdural law en orcement ageneles and patriotie eitizens

and to sift und coordinate ali suel information for indications of subversive

activity covared by Fedural siatutes

The study concluded that the FDi has the rosponsibility to con-

duct whatover investigatione zre nodussary to detormine if etatutes rciating

to espionage, sabotage, insurrection or reboltion, sedition, seditious son-

spiracy, novocacy of overthrowing the Government, and other such crimes

note that in o. Iciter dinted Sepiember 14, 1967, the Departnont of Justice

advised that the FBI is continually alert to the prublem of zceuring riots

und is submitting inicilicones roperts to the Lopertment of Justice concern-

ing such activity. This letter enumorated several Fuderal statutos and

stated these could be applleable in using maximum availeble resources,

investigative and intclitzonce, to crilect and roport all facts bearing on

tho question of schemes ox conspiracies to plan, promote or eggruvato riot

activity.

In other words, the Departmont was requesting all possible

Based on this study, we believe that hod there never been a

single one of the Presidential cirectives in question the fBI would have

conducted and will, through necessity, continue to conduct the same intelli

gence-type investitations as were conductud from 1939 to the present date.

We also believe, however, that in order to counter the criticiam and skepti-

cism of such individuals as l'rofescor lllift and Senator Sun 2. Ervin that

an up-to-date Escentive order should be issued clearly establishing & need

for Intolligence-type investigations and delincuting a clear authority for the

FBi to conduct such investigutions based on guidelines established by the

Attorney Gonerul aud adhering to constitutional principles.

The study concinded with two badic recommendations.

1) Thot the Dopartment of Justice be requested to sponsor compichensive

legislation spelling cut the kat's investigutive nuthority in the collection of

Bepartrent of Justico be requested to seck a comprchensive Executive order

which would couct any poncible pop beiwoen statutory authority and Executive

necessity in protection of the netional security .

At fiasi glance i:ese recomnendations may appear to contradict

our porition that wo already, huve statutory authority to conduct sccurity-type

investigations; that this being the case we do not need additional legislative

enactments, nos do we need an Executive coder. But being realictie we thirl:

that the basic statutes upon which we reiy for our authority to conduct

domesic intelligence investigacions need to be updated to tit 1075 aceds.

Pitle 15 U.S.C. Suettons 2668, 2384, and 2335 rolate to the nutional security,

but the logislarive Idstory o 4303 and 2081 indicates that they were designed

for the Civil War ora, not the 'I wentieth Century, und Soction 2385 has been

reduced to a fragile shell by the Supreme Court, 'Shese statutes are unques-

The Attorney General

As to the need for un Executive order, we think that two lesuos

are involved. We have statutory authority, but what we need is a donative

requirement from the President as to the nature and type of intelligence data

he requirca in the pursuit of his responsibititics based on our statutory

authority. In other words, thore is a need, from eur stondpoint, for both

authoritative and definitive guidelines. The statutos give us the authority.

The Laccutive order would defino our national security objectives.

Members of Congrese, including such men as Senator Robert C.

Byrd of West Virginia, have proposed legiclution to spell out jurisdteden and

authority of the FEI in this field. It would appeor that th Procident would

rather spell out his own requiremonts in an Executive order insteno of having

Congress tell him what the FBI might do to help hun fulli his obligalions and

responsibiukes as President.

The poliiical climule of suspicion and distrust resulting from

disclosures coming out of the Matorgate neurings coulú present an obttacle

to getting any such Exceutive order signed in the immeciato future. However,

the xationale is nevertheless valid and when serutinizos closcly, the Jenguage

in the lixecutive order we hereinatter propose establishes dofinitive giddelines

which have heretofore been uncleor. It is my belief that we should go forward

with this.

We therofore propose and recommend that an Exccutive eider

along the following linas be suomilted to the White louse with a stoog

recommendation for approval. The language which foliows is mercy to

¡lustzate the type of Executive order which we tink would be appropriate

and does not necessarily represent an ideal format or style which shoald

be subruitied to the White House.

it would be folly to opt an investgative policy based on

the concept of investigation only wich there in reason to bolieve a crime

involving the national scurity tus been committed. The FBI must

obviously anticipate the crines duscribed above. We believe that in

order' for the Covermmont to be in position to lutend itseli against revolu-

tionary and terrorist ollorts to doctroy it, the kEl must have suiticient

investigative authority to condudi intelligence-type investigations not

normally associated with enforcomant of the stututes. In other words we

think the Fresioent has the inhorent Executive power to expand by further

dehning the IM's investigative authority io couble it to develop advance

information concerning the plans and aspirations of terrorists and revolu-

tionarics who seek to overthrow or destroy the Government. However, we

also beliove that such empanded authority must be formally sei forth in an

Executive order and that this recoimendation is responsive in the littorney

General's expressed interest in loying more formal guidelines to our work

in areas where definition is not now cloar.

We consider the issuance of a now Erecutive order delineating

our jurisdiction, authority, and responsibility to gather and report intelligence

information relating to the national security to be & very important and high

For your information, our own investigative guidelines as con-

tained in our leanual of Instuctions relating to domestic subversive investiga-

tions live beon completely rewritten to conform with the concept that our

domestic intelligence-type invostigations are based on. Fedoral statutos. These

guidelines provido that in each instance, the domestic intelligence investigation

must be predicated on informotion indicating that the organization or incividual

is angoged in activity which could involve a violation of specific statutes a'clating

to the national scourity. A copy of the now guidelines was previously provided

to the Dopartmont vi Justice in connection with the request of Schator Edward il.

Kenardy to obtain a copy of the Ebl's Section 87 of the Alanual of Instructions.

Reference Legal Counsel to J. B. Adams memorandum

dated 3/20/75 captioned as above and letter of Senator Frank Church

dated 3/19/75.

Relet requested, among other things, the titles and number

of FBI field office agents assigned to internal security, intelligence

collection and/or counterintelligence matters, operations or activities,

together with the percent of total agent man-hours devoted to such matters,

operations and activities ( page 3, item IIIC of relet).

The purpose of this memorandum is to forward to the Legal

Counsel Division, through the Intelligence Division, the response, attached

herewith, to the above request.

It is noted the request specifically mentions internal security,

intelligence collection and counterintelligence matters. Our response has

been constructed in the traditional two categories of internal security and

counterintelligence. Intelligence collection (informants) is included in the

& data for both of the other categories as appropriate.

RECOMMENDATION:

That this memorandum with enclosure be forwarded to the

Intelligence Division for review, classification and approval and, thereafter,

forwarded to the Legal Counsel Division which is coordinating replies to

the Senate Select Committee.

The Intelligence Division has reviewed the attached figures

prepared by the Administrative Division. Under the criteria of the current

Classification Act it would be impossible to justify classification of these

figures; however, should they be made public or fall into the hands of a

hostile foreign intelligence service, it would reveal the current capability

the FBI employs in the field of counterintelligence against the total foreign

threat. In view of the above, the Intelligence Division strongly recommends

that the Legal Counsel Division discuss this with the staff of the Senate

Select Committee pointing out the vulnerability implicit in this attachment

in an effort to have the Committee withdraw its request identified as II C.

Kegarding the observations of the Intelligence Division

concerning the making arailable the amount of manpower dedicatosite

counterintelligence and domostic intelligence work in the IDI, the

Legal Counsel Division has the following observations:

(1) Based on our analysis and conversations this

Division has had with Fred B. Criffith of the Inspection Division, it

oppears that the information contained in this merorantum may be

classified confidential under. Executive order 11052.

(2) Before mnting any determination as to whether we

make such information available to the Cenate Select Committee, it

would appear we should determine from CIA what their response to

such a request will be so that our position and that of CIA will be

consistent in this area. In this regard SA Paul V. Daly has contacted

Leon F. Echwartz, Liaison Cection of Intelligence Division, and requeated

he dotermine front CiA what their position in this regard is.

(3) It is not believed that we should take a hard and inst

position that this information not be made available to the Committee or

that we make an effort to have the Committee withdraw their request for

this information. Tre should rather develop some fallback position such

as that this information will be made available to the Chairman of the

Committee or will be made available during an oral briefing, etc.

Director Sec'y

In connection with our investigations of staff members for

captioned Committee, we have developed derogatory information on two

individuals which has been brought specifically to the attention of William Miller,

Staff Director of the Committee, One of these involved Mrs. Diane Eloise

LaVoy whose sister-in-law questioned her loyalty and declared she "does not

love America." The sister-in-law said Mrs. LaVoy constantly criticized the

U. S. Government and its policy and underlying weaknesses of our society.

Another individual said she was highly critical of CIA activities. This information

was pointed out to Miller on 3-25-75 when the results of the investigation were

delivered to him, and he also was advised that the CIA would be furnished the same

data in accordance with our agreement concerning these matters.

On 3-24-75 and 3-28-75 results of the investigation concerning

Mrs. Betty Dale Ellison were delivered to Miller and he was advised that a prie

supervisor with eight years of training and experience in psychiatric care statee

he felt Mrs. Ellison needs psychological examination. He termed her a troubleg

maker and said he would have fired her if he had the authority. He described

her definitely as a security risk due to her mental and emotional instability. It

R

2

also was pointed out to Miller that other former supervisors described her as

unstable when working under pressure and unable to get along with fellow emplo

Miller was told that this information also would be furnished to CIA.

On 4-2-75 Miller advised Inspector Bowers he had considered the

matter involving Mrs. LaVoy and had discussed it with the Committee Chairman,

and they had decided to proceed with her as a staff member since they did not feel

the derogatory remarks by her sister-in-law were sufficiently strong enough to

disqualify her since the remainder of the investigation was favorable.

RE: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

Miller also advised on 4-2-75 that their review of the Ellison

investigation showed justifiable concern for her being cleared for the staff, and

he asked for any guidance we might give him. It was pointed out that the only

Miller said he would appreciate any comments from the CIA also in this regard.

This request was conveyed to CIA by Section Chief William Cregar of the

Intelligence Division who subsequently advised that Charles Kane, Director of

Security, CIA, had reviewed the file on Ellison and agreed there was sufficient

cause to question her suitability for assignment to the Select Committee staff.

Kane stated CIA Director Colby concurred in this observation.

These views were conveyed to Miller on 4-9-75. Miller stated

and Special Agent Paul V. Daly met with William Miller, Staff Director;

the Senate Select Committee (SSC) staff. During the meeting Mr. Schwarz

requested a briefing be arranged for staff members of SSC concerning the

operations of the Intelligence Division, that they be furnished copies of training

documents pertaining to matters handled by the Intelligence Division, and that

they be furnished a glossary of terms used in the intelligence field.

He pointed

out the aforementioned material would greatly assist in the SSC staff developing

an understanding of the Intelligence Division operations and hopefully prevent

misunderstandings or needless requests of the FBI.

Mr. Miller advised that Senators Frank Church and John Tower

intended to contact the Director in the immediate future to discuss arrangements

relating to the SSC's review of the FBI activities.

DATE 1-18-01 BY SPLANTHE

At 11:00 a.m. on April 17, 1975, Inspector JOhn B. Hotis

Special Agent Paul V. Daly and I met with Deputy Attorney General Tyler

and Associate Deputy Attorney General James Hutchinson at the request

of the Deputy Attorney General.

Deputy Attorney General Tyler advised that he had been requested

by Burke Marshall and F.A. O. Schwarz, III, who are consultant and General

Counsel, respectively, for the Senate Select Committee, to meet with

him on Monday afternoon, April 21, 1975, to discuss matters relating

to the Committee's activities. The Deputy Attorney General said that he

has been personally acquainted with Mr. Marshall for a long time and also

is acquainted with Mr. Schwarz. He considered the possibility of having

a Bureau representative attend the meeting, but then decided it would be

best if he would meet with Marshall and Schwarz privately to determine

whether they desire to discuss details of the Committee's responsibilities

and if it became necessary, he would request the Bureau to send a

representative to the meeting. REC AA

The Deputy Attorey Ceneral said that he would, of course,

advise us orally or in writing of the results of his conference with Mr. Marshall

and Mr. Schwarz.

2Z APR 22 1975

The Deputy Attorney General inquired as to the procedure

currently being employed in responding to the Committee's requests

and Inspector Hotis explained the current procedures. I mentioned to the

Deputy Attorney General the existence of the Ad Hoc Committee of

Intelligence Agencies and suggested to him that he might desire to designate

a representative to attend those meetings in order to be on notice as to the

policies being developed by the White House and the intelligence community

in responding to Committee requests. I explained to him that James

Memorandum to Mr. Adams

Re: Senate Select Committee on Intelligence

Department's representative on the Committee, but he has now been

reassigned to responsibilities at the White House. I told him that

Assistant Attorney General Scalia had been scheduled to attend the last

meeting of the Committee, although he was unable to attend. The

Deputy Attorney General said that he would discuss with Mr. Scalia

the possibility of having Mr. Scalia attend as the Department's

representative.

I asked the Deputy Attorney General whether he was undertaking

the principal responsibility in the Department for matters relating to the

Senate Select Committee and other committees that may be inquiring

into the FBI and he said that that was not clear as yet because the Attorney

General has taken a personal interest in these matters and it appeared that

the responsibilities are still fragmented within the Department. It was

his opinion that the responsibilities should be centralized and he appeared to be

willing to undertake that responsibility.

It was my impression that the Deputy Attorney General was

interested in being of assistance to the FBI in these matters and expressed

a willingness to cooperate by having the FBI participate as much as

possible with the Deputy Attorney General.

Re :

Rapota and possibly other Soviets.

WFO has noted that

Mr. Miller is also known to have been in contact with

Aleksandr A. Kokorev, a First

Secretary of the Soviet

Embassy, Washington,

D. C., and a known officer of the

Soviet Military Intelligence (GRU). 5)

While Mr. Miller was most cooperative on the last

occasion he was interviewed by the FBI, it is noted he did

not provide any particularly significant information con-

cerning the Soviets with whom he had contacts)While it is

not known at this time whether he could presently provide

meaningiul information, an interview with him at this time,

when he is now the Stafi Director of the Select Committee

to Study Governmental Operations, could well be untimely and

indiscreet.

ACTION:

(1) In view of impending contacts which will be

nad by fBihe with ur. willer, the purpose of this memorandun

Is to draw attention to the fact that Mir. Willer has hac

Cast contact with representatives of Soviet intelligence

services and may be continuing to have same. (5)

(2) If you agree,

there is attached a communication

to WrO captioned,

"Grigoriy A. Rapota; IS - R (SOVEMB-

KGB)" which denys authority for an interview with Mr. Miller

at this tine and instructs that office to promptly advise

FBIHQ of any additional contacts between Mr. Miller and

representatives of the soviet Embassy, Washington, D. C.,

which may come to its attention. (5)

This memorandum records the formal establishment

a task force entitled Project Senstudy 75.

The concept behind the establishment of this Project

is to develop a capability of implementing requests received

from Select Committees of the Congress in a comprehensive and

timely fashion but yet allow the Bureau to continue to conduct

its day-to-day business in as normal a manner as possible.

to

meet the requirements of these Select Committees with the

substantive Divisions.

While the Project will direct internal work and

related liaison with the intelligence community and the

White House staff, we envision the Legal Analysis Unit Office

of Legal Counsel Division as continuing to be the primary

point of direct contact with the Select Committees of the

Congress. They will receive all requests and deliver all

responses to these Committees.

In addition, they will meet

with the staffs of the Committees to insure the reasonableness

of requests.

If necessary, they will call upon the expertise

of the substantive Division for determination as to whether

a proposed request from the Committees can be responded to

within a reasonable period of time and within the capabilities

of the FBI's information retrieval systed 106 67-1/1-575

At the present time foür Supervisors have been

delegated to work

exlusively on the Project. They are as

follows:

ambiguities requiring recontact with Committee staffs; the

assignment of research responsibilities to substantive Divisions;

following such responsibilities to insure timely responses;

as well as representing

• the FBI on the Executive Committee

of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group for Congressional Review of

the Intelligence Community. Assistant Director John A. Mintz is

also a member of the Executive Committee.

This latter responsi-

bility will provide Cregar and Mintz with direct liaison not

only with senior officials of the intelligence community but

also with the President's counsel.

Mr. Elmer W. Larson, Unit Chief, Training Unit, IS-3

Section, Intelligence

Division will act as Cregar's Number One

Man; will administer the work of the Project; and act in the

absence of Cregar.

Seymor F. Phillips, Unit Chief, Civil Disorders

Reporting Unit, IS-1 Section, Intelligence Division will serve

as the Review Coordinator for the Project. His responsibilities

will be to review all research; coordinate all responses; be

available to consult with substantive Divisions as to proper

form of our responses; identify any conflicts in FBI positions

where several Divisions are responding to a particular question;

as well as to insure the quality, completeness and

adequacy

of responses to Select Committees requests.

Additionally,

Phillips will be responsible for the preparation of abstracts

to be furnished to the Interagency Registry maintained at CIA

Headquarters.

This Registry established by the Executive Committee

of the Ad Hoc Group at the suggestion of and with the concurrence

of the White House will serve as the coordinating mechanism

for the entire intelligence community.

Mr. Leon F. Schwartz, Liaison Officer with CIA, CI-4

Section, Intelligence Division will function as the Liaison

Officer with the intelligence community responsible for coordi-

nating and clearing all information under the third agency rule

where FBI responses are of interest to or are of a proprietary

interest to other agencies of the intelligence community. Schwartz

will serve as the Bureau's representative on the Ad Hoc Coordinating

Group for Congressional Review of the Intelligence Community.

Memorandum to Mr.

W.

R. Wannall

Re:

Senstudy 75

Because of the White House insistence that all requests

land responses be completely coordinated and available for review

by White House representatives, it is imperative that the Project

have a self-sustained records facility to insure immediate access

to requests received from and responses furnished to the Select

Committees. In addition, in those instances where certain FBI

documents furnished to the Select Committees must be sanitized

copies out is imperative this records facility not only retain

the sanitized documents but also copies of the original

text. For these reasons a senior clerical employee has been

requested to function as a Records Manager for the Project.

In addition to the above, there will be stenographic

and clerical personnel assigned to the Project to support the

work of the Bureau Supervisors.

We have not committed any more

personnel to the Project than are absolutely necessary at the

present time.

Should the requests of the Select Committees

require additional personnel, appropriate memoranda will be

submitted with

a complete justification for additional personnel

assigned to the Project.

Although the physical space for the Project is

limited, all personnel connected with Project Senstudy 75

will be located in Room 4063, J. Edgar Hoover Building. This

space is physically located within the Intelligence Division.

As a matter of interest, Mr. James Wilderotter,

Associate Counsel to the President, has requested that should

James estld tott shoula

any member of the intelligence community get requests from other

Committees of the Congress which impact on the intelligence

community; could be of interest to the White House;or are of such

sensitivity that coordination is required, copies of both the

requests and an abstract of the responses

should be made

available to the Interagency Registry.

ACTION:

For information and record purposes.

As you were previously advised, William Miller, Staff Director

of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities, requested that we

provide a briefing for certain staff members of the Committee on the functions

of the Intelligence Division. He asked that the briefing cover both internal

security and foreign counterintelligence operations and that it provide a broad

overview of our investigative responsibilities.

18 astro

The Intelligence Division is prepared to offer a two-hour briefing

beginning at 10:00 a.m. on Friday, 4-11-75. It will include a slide show to

be followed by a general discussion and an opportunity to afford questions. and

answers. After a luncheon break, the staff members will be given a brief tour

of the Files and Communications Division.

Since the briefing will cover classified materials, no staff

members will be invited unless they have appropriate security clearances. As

a consequence Professor John Elliff, who has been tentatively named Director

of the Committee's Task Force on Domestic Intelligence, will not attend. It

is hoped that we may provide him with a private filing at gone later date.

wi.,

It is expected that those attending the briefing will include:

Mr. Miller, F. A. O. Schwarz III, Chief Counsel, Mark Gitenstein and

"The Washington Post," Thursday, 4-10-75, edition

on page A31 contains an article reporting an interview of Senator Frank

Church, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities.

Senator Church, according to this article, stated that the Committee is

reserving the right to make public eventually any documents it gets and is

laccepting nothing with "strings attached. "

Inasmuch as this Committee is also the Committee which the

FBI is furnishing information too, it is believed a clarification of Senator Church's

statement must be obtained and in the interim we should furnish the Senate

Select Committee only those documents which do not have a caveat such as

classified documents or documents bearing the property stamp.

Section Chief William O. Cregar advised that he had contacted

Dr. John M. Clarke, Associate Deputy to the DCI for the Intelligence Committee

concerning Senator Church's reported statement. Clarke stated that CIA

Director William E. Colby was highly upset at Church's remark and that

this statement would be a topic of a discussion of the Executive Committee meeting

of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congressional Review the morning of

4-11-75. We will be represented at that conference by Section Chief William O.

Cregar and Assistant Director John A. Mintz. Clarke indicated the position.

that the CIA will apparently take regarding this problem is that the White House

should obtain the clarification although CIA Director Colby initially was prepared

(to send a letter over his signature to Senator Church to obtain such clarification.

REG. 40 d-116395

Inasmuch as the request by this committee was forwarded through

the Department, Senator Church's statement was brought to the attention of

Douglas Marvin, Assistant to the Attorney General, who has been handling

all FBI responses to Senate Select Committee requests. Marvin indreated-her

was concerned at Church's statement and stated it was the Attorney General's

desire that he be advised of any Bureau response to the Committee

concerhihs 1975

this matter.

RE:

testimony of a secret employee and following such testimony

the employee will be allowed to meet with staff members of

definitive information on the final decisions regarding this

aspect will be forthcoming from the White House.

The question was raised by the Bureau representative

as to whether the Ad Hoc Group and/or the interagency registry

should be notified as to requests members of the Intelligence

Community receive from other Congressional committees.

Mr.

Wilderotter advised that this would be a judgment question;

however, if a request from a Congressional committee other than

the Select Committees impacted on the Intelligence Community,

involve sensitive issues or would be of interest to the White

House, such requests should be provided to the

interagency

registry along with an abstract of the response.

Attached is a list of those members of the SSC staff

who have been certified for access to compartmented information.

Also attached is a paper identifying 10 issues likely to grow

out of Select Committee

deliberations. The pencil notation in

the right-hand column identifies those agencies of the Intelli-

gence Community responsible for preparing a paper which addresses

these issues.

It is noted that issue identified as number eight

is entitled,

"Intelligence Files and Privacy." Mr. Colby asked

that the FBI prepare this paper. Assistant Director Mintz advised

that the Bureau has a study underway on this very subject and

agreed that the Bureau would prepare this study. The deadline

for completion of the study is 4/25/75.

Also attached is a copy of the survey of the SSC facility,

Room G-308, Dirksen Building, covering all aspects of physical and

the participants of the EXCOM had ans

objection to the facility and we presume the SSC will abide by

the procedures outlined in the attached survey report.

Attached also for information is a draft of an employee

notice and agreement concerning treatment of confidential material

being considered by the SSC.

It is to be noted that to date neither

the Committeenor its staff has signed any such Secrecy Agreement.

FISHLIT IS UNTOS ASS.

DAM 118-0/57S2-

In

previous sessions we discussed the

importance of

highlighting issues likely. to grow.out. of.Commission.or

Committee deliberations.

We observed that we should identify

isome of those on which a legal brief or annex would be helpful

• to Executive Branch initiatives.

The idea was to select a

few where a solid research paper with options, pros and cons,

etc., could help us develop a firm grip on the questions in

the issue and identify options.

For example, the question of

_Executive.privacy.presents itself..and I.gather is being

worked on.

There are others we feel it would be useful for the group

to address

and assign responsibility for further work. For

DATE L/18/0 / BY SP-2 ALA

This memorandum reports the results of a meeting

of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congressional Review of

the Intelligence Community (hereafter referred to as the

Group), held at CIA Headquarters on the morning of 4/2/75.

The study prepared for the President's Foreign

Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) entitled, "Human Intel-

ligence," has come to the attention of the Senate Select

Committee (SSC).

The major contributors to this report were

the FBI and CIA. It is an extremely sensitive document and

for that reason

any requests from any committees of the

Congress

for copies of this report should be referred to the

White House.

At the present time, the consensus of those

persons in

the

White House

dealing with the subject of release

of information to the committees of Congress is that this

report will not be provided Congressional committees at this

time.

The SSC does recognize a requirement to comply with

the Third Agency Rule which states in effect that classified

information or material originating in one department shall

not be disseminated outside any other department to which it

has been made available without the consent of the originating*

department. CIA's General Counsel has produced a paper entitled

"The Third Agency Rule," copy attached, which they have requested

be reviewed by the Legal Counsels of all agencies making up the

Intelligence Community.

A copy of CIA's paper referred to above

has been made available to Assistant Director Mintz who has

indicated he will be in direct SEC fat with Mr. Warner, CIA's

General Counsel.

The Third Agency Rule

#mDR16

ATT INFORMATION CONTAIURO

HEREIN IS UNCTASSITIED

DATE L// 8/0/

31582

1. As early as November 1953, the third agency rule was

included in Executive Order 10501, which has now been revoked.

Section 7(c) prohibited the dissemination of "classified defense

information originating in another Department or agency" to an

agency "outside the receiving Department of agency without the

consent of the originating Department or agency". The only excep-

ton to this rule is that dissemination may be made under the authority

of Section 102 of the National Security Act. This section authörizes

the Director of Central Intelligence "to correlate and evaluate intelli-

gence relating to the national security, and provide for the appropriate

dissemination of such intelligence within the Government using, where

appropriate, existing agencies and facilities".

2. Historically, the responsibility of the DCI to disseminate

intelligence has referred to "finished intelligence". This product is

the end result of contributions from members of the Intelligence Commu-

nity. Therefore, in this situation the finished product is ay homogenous

product and therefore the approval for further dissemination beyond the

receiving agency must come from the Central Intelligence Agency.

3. Executive Order 10501 was superseded by Executive Order

11652 which became effective 1 June 1972. This Executive order did not

specifically cover the third agency rule. However, it does provide the

following controls: Sec..9. Special Departmental Arrangements. The

originating Department or other appropriate authority may impose, in

conformity with the provisions of this order, special requirements with

respect to access, distribution and protection of classified information

and material, including those which presently relate to communications

intelligence, intelligence sources and methods and cryptography.

4. In anticipation of the implementation of Executive Order

11652, a directive was issued on May 17, 1972 entitled "National Security

Council Directive Governing the Classification, Downgrading, Declassi-

fication and Safeguarding of National Security Information". This

-directive does not contain the term "third agency rule" but does have

four subsections which relate to procedures which are similar to what

historically had been called the third agency rule. These sections are:

A. (2) Determination of Need-to-Know. In addition to a

security clearance, a person must have a need for access

to the particular classified information or material sought

in connection with the performance of his official duties or

ENCLOSURE

## Page 169

tractual obligations. The deter

nation of that need -

shall be made by officials having responsibility for the

classified information or material.

D. Consent of Originating Department to Dissemination

by Recipient. Except as otherwise provided by Section

102 of the National Security Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 495, 50

U.S.C. 403, classified information or material originating

in one Department shall not be disseminated outside any

other Department to which it has been made available

without the consent of the originating Department.

E. Dissemination of Sensitive Intelligence Information.

Information or material bearing the notation "WARNING

NOTICE -- SENSITIVE INTELLIGENCE SOURCES AND

METHODS INVOLVED" shall not be disseminated in any

manner outside authorized channels without the permission

of the originating Department and an assessment by the

senior intelligence official in the disseminating Department

as to the potential risk to the national security and to the

intelligence sources and methods involved.

F. Restraint on Special Access Requirements. The

establishment of special rules limiting access to, distri-

bution and protection of classified införmation and material

under Section 9 of the Order requires the specific prior

approval of the head of a Department or his designee.

5. Examples of the application of the Third Agency Rule are:

(a) In a national security estimate, contributions are

received from all members of the Intelligence Community and

then disseminated to members of the community under the

authority of the DCI;

(b) A CIA intelligence report disseminated to the State

Department may not be sent by the State Department to

the Department of Commerce without the permission of the

CIA;

(c) Information which the CIA furnishes the President's

Commission may not be disseminated to other agencies or

to the Congress without the concurrences of CIA. Thus,

a request from the Congress to the Commission for CIA

information should be referred to CIA for action so that

the necessary protection of the information can be insured.

NW 88608 Docld:32989628 Page 169

---

## Page 170

(d)

If the Navy Department discusses one of its operations

with CIA, CIA may not include information about that operation

in papers it disseminates to other agencies unless it has

received the permission of the Navy Department. The distinc-

tion here is that a Navy operation would not be considered part

of the finished intelligence mechanism and therefore would

not fall within the statutory authority of CIA to disseminate

intelligence.

HE DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE

WASHINGTON, D. C. 20505

28 March 1975

MEMORANDUM FOR: USIB Ad Hoc Group

SUBJECT:

Handling of Third Agency Matters in Response

to Congressional Select Committees

* m

¡CONTATTE

1. As you are aware, Senator Church already has submitted

to me a long list of materials which he requests be provided to his

Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with

Respect to Intelligence Activities. He has submitted other lists to

the Federal Bureau of Investigation and to the White House. . It is

expected that other elements of the Intelligence Community will

be hearing from Sènator Church.

2. The scope of the investigation necessarily is going to

involve Third Agency relationships to a considerable degree.

3. In the implementation of Executive Order 11652,

"Classification and Declassification of National Security Information

and Material," the President directed the following:

• "D. Consent of Originating Department to Dissemination

by Recipient.

Except as otherwise provided by Section 102

of the National Security Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 495,50 U.S. C.

403, classified information or material originating in one

Department shall not be disseminated outside any other

Department to which it has been made available without the

consent of the originating department. "

4. As regards Section 102 of the 1947 Act, the following

quotes 102 (e) in full:

"(3) To the extent recommended by the National Security

Council and approved by the President, such intelligence

of the departments and agencies of the Government, except

as hereinafter provided, relating to the national security,

62-118395-68

NW 88608 Docld:32989628 Page 171

---

## Page 172

shall be open to the inspection of the Director of Central

Intelligence, and such intelligence as relates to the

national security and is possessed by such departments and

other agencies of the Government, except as hereinafter

provided, shall be made available to the Director of

Central Intelligence for correlation, evaluation and

dissemination; Provided, however, that upon the written

request of the Director of Central Intelligence, the Director

of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall make available

to the Director of Central Intelligence such information .

for correlation, evaluation and dissemination as may be

essential to the national security."

5.

If I am requested to provide certain materials and

investigation indicates that the material asked for involves a document

which originated within an organization other than the Intelligence

Community Staff or the Central Intelligence Agency, the requestor

will be asked to redirect his inquiry to the office of origin..

6. It already is apparent, however, that the documentation

being requested inevitably is going to include references to inter-

relationships among various of the elements of the intelligence

community.

Clearing

each and every such reitience with etcry

agency mentioned could manifestly be extremely consuming of time

and manpower.

?. I propose the Ad Hoc Group agree on the following procedure.

Where it appears that truly sensitive matters are involved, the

material will be sanitized by the agency concerned and a check will

be made with the appropriate Third Agency organizations before

release. Where the reference concerns a Third Agency indirectly

or is not considered sensitive and does not pose policy concerns, the

agency concerned may forward the material to the requesting Select

Committee without an item-by-item

mention-by-mention clearance

with Third Agencies. However, in all cases notification that such

material has been forwarded will be made to the central index and

U.

NW 88608 Docld:32989628 Page 172

---

## Page 173

all agencies alerted through that mechanism. Agencies will

designate on their submissions to the central index, the name and

telephone number of the releasing party.

8. Ad hoc members should be prepared to discuss and

come to some agreement on this matter at the next meeting.

SUBJECT:

Sanitization Guidelines for Documents

Provided Congressional Select

Committees

1. Attached is a copy of a statement, Guidelines for

Sanitizing Certain Documents Provided Select Committees''

prepared by the Chairman, USIB Security Committee, for

consideration by the Ad Hoc Group. This step is a follow on to

the understanding the DCI has with Senator Church that sanitization

of selective documents will be undertaken before the documents

are released to the Committee. Similar understandings have been

discussed with House Staff as well.

2. It is important that, to the extent possible, all intelligence

Organizations follow generally the same sanitization guidelines.

Accordingly, the USIB. Ad Hoc Group should consider utilizing these

or similar guidelines within their respective organizations.

3. If requested by the Chairman, the DCI will discuss

orally with the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Senate and House

Select.Committees the content of the sensitive USIB or CIA material

excised from documents. Where appropriate, the DCI may discuss

this sensitive material with the entire Select Committee. He

considers it essential that the written record provided to the

Committee staff not include such sensitive information for the

protection of intelligence sources and methods.

28 MARCH'S

GUIDELINES FOR SANITIZING CERTAIN DOCUMENTS

• PROVIDED SELECT COMMITTEES

1. The Director of Central Intelligence has recently discussed

with Senator Church the need for special consideration and treatment

by the Select Committee of certain sensitive aspects of intelligence

activities and the Senator has expressed his recognition of this need.

Included in such matters are the identities of sensitive sources, the

material provided to the United States by cooperating foreign

intelligence services, the details of technical devices and systems

and of operational methods, the identities of certain employees whose

safety could be jeopardized if revealed, the identities of American

citizens and organizations who have cooperated with US intelligence

and some additional materials the public disclosure of which would

create serious foreign policy or national security problems. Such

material should be protected not only from exposure but indeed the

risk of exposure. Further, recognition should be given to the need

to protect certain other information which, if improperly disclosed,

might impair the privacy rights of individuals.

2. One form of this special consideration may include use

of sanitization procedures to avoid the risk of exposing such matters

and at the same time satisfy the Select Committee's need for a full

understanding of the community's activities.

3.

What May Be Sanitized

While it is not possible to anticipate all requirements which

may be levied by the Committees for document.

• material and not

possible to determine specifically what material should be excised

from these documents, the following illustrations are offered in

certain likely categories. The criteria in all cases should meet

the test mentioned above.

4. Collection of Intelligence

"(a) The Committee will probably address the matter of how.

intelligence activities or methods have or may impinge upon individual

rights.

Documents supporting responses may be sanitized by removal

of identities of sensitive agents and informants, covert personnel,

and contractual cover arrangements. A descriptive phrase may be.

substituted, i.e., a foreign journalist, a political official in the

opposition party. No sanitization should be used in connection with

= Z

NW 88608 Docld:32989628 Page 176

---

## Page 177

names of individuals whose employment or former employment by,

or association with a department or agency, does not remain secret

or for individuals whose present or future activities on behalf of the

department or agency do not require that previous cover arrangements

remain secret.

(b) Some information may be required with respect to

technical intelligence systems including cryptologic and communications

activities and reconnaissance capabilities. Almost all of such material

is currently handled in compartmentation control channels under

various codewords or nicknames. No security threat is perceived

by release

of these codenames or nicknames in documents. Details

of the technical systems involved, contractual arrangements, funding

and/or names of companies or consultants whose participation was

obtained under agreement of continued secrecy may be excised from

documents. Any question on release of codeword material should be

referred to the Program Manager who in turn may consult with the

Director of Central Intelligence to ensure a consistent approach in

the community's sanitization procedure. While documentary samples

of intelligence obtained by technical means may be used in support of

verbal testimony, no raw product should be provided the Committees

- 3

NW 88608 Docld:32989628 Page 177

---

## Page 178

• for retention.

If absolutely required by the Committees, sanitization

of such raw product should be conducted to mask the degree of

technical capabilities.

5. Intelligence Estimates

Finished intelligence reports of departments and agencies and

"estimates do not usually contain source identifications and will not

normally require sanitization. However, departments and agencies

should review such publications to ensure deletion of source identities.

6. Administration

Information concerning the internal administration arrangements

of intelligence agencies may be requested. This may include staffing

chart with occupants identified. Sanitization of individual, identities

of personnel formerly not under cover and now functioning in a cover

assignment should be deleted as well as those who may in the future

be considered for a covert assignment..

7.

General

The following categories of information or specific examples

may arise in any number of circumstances in documentation requested

by the Select Committees. In all cases, serious consideration should

be given by the department or agency concerned to the necessity of

NW 88608. Docld:32989628. Page 178

---

## Page 179

• deletion or sanitization of this type of information, prior to

providing the document.

(a) Agent or informant names or operational information

revealing them.

(b) Details which would reveal the effectiveness of sensitive

methods and techniques (1) employed overseas in-human-source-

collection, (2) employed for the physical security protection of the

department's of agency's personnel or physical environment.

(c) The nümbers, locations, times and other indications of

recruitment or emplacement of personnel within targetted foreign

organizations.

(d) The success or failure of recruitment attempts in any

given targetted foreign organization.

(e) Names of particular employees whose physical safety or

future career might be placed in jeopardy bỳ exposure.

• (f) Foreign or US sources, official or otherwise who agreed

to cooperate under terms of explicit or implied confidentiality, who

would be embarrassed or endangered by disclosure of their role.

(g) Identifying information on intelligence services in friendly

and neutral countries.

- 5

NW 88608 Docld:32989628 Page 179

## Page 180

(h) Identifying collaborative operations between the United

States intelligence agencies and other foreign intelligence liaison

services

against targets within the country extending the collaborations

or within a jointly targetted third country.

(i) Identifying collaboration with foreign governments in

signals intelligence collection, particularly for arrangements which,

if revealed, would be politically embarrassing in the countries

involved.

(j) Identification of technical intelligence operations of high

technical vulnerability and extremely high political sensitivity.

(k) Specific identification of foreign technical collection

installations involving high political sensitivity in the host country.

(1) Details or disclosure of monetary arrangements with

US and foreign banks, investment houses,

etc., in support of foreign

intelligence operations.

(m) Specific information on special relationships with private

firms established with the approval of top corporate officials. This

includes names of firms or industrial associations that collaborate

in a special manner such as providing cover for foreign intelligence

operations.

agencies in collection and assessment programs (especially

those having large foreign clienteles).

" 8.

: What Should Not Be Sanitized

There are general categories of intelligence activities which

have already been placed in the public domain by the mass news media

or authors with background experience in intelligence departments

or agencies of the community. Names, places, dates and events

which have been so revealed should not be excised if contained in

requested documents.

there's amineceasing body of information which-has been

•released under the Freedom of Information Act. No further sanitization

of this material should be conducted unless it relates to an individual's

rights to privacy.

• 9. Techniques of Sanitization

Sanitization of intelligence material is usually considered the

act of physical removal of the identity of a person, place or thing

from written communication with or without regard for the residual

7

NW 88608 Docld:32989628 Page 181

---

## Page 182

content.

Use of a substitution device, either pseudonym or ident

is an example of sanitization which permits intelligent continuity

of the material without revealing the true identity. Sanitization

does not extend to the use of false or misleading substitute material

in this context.

The integrity of official records must be maintained.. The

following sanitization techniques apply only to copies of records.

(a) Physical Sanitization - Names may be cut out and

the residual material xeroxed and submitted to Committees. Names

may be masked with correction tape and then xeroxed. The xerox

copy may be submitted to the Committees.

(b) Names may be deleted and replaced with "IDEN,"

The defted materialis provided on, a separate IDEN list which

contains names or descriptive phrases substituted for deletions.

(c) The material can be retyped or reprinted with

substitute phrases or substitute descriptions which do not reveal

the sensitive material.

(d) Entire pages can be removed from some documents

and replaced with a blank page carrying only reference information

-

8

NW-88608_Docld:32989628. Page 182

---

## Page 183

as to the location of the sensitive material within the contributing

department or agency. This technique may be employed when

physical sanitization or excision of material results in unintelligible

gibberish as residue..

(e) Within a category of inquiry, it may be desirable to

• extract a complete document from requested material when the

request is broad and all inclusive within its field. The existence

of such a document should be made known to the Committees but

retained by the agency or department for, review under escort

of a representative of the department or agency.

:10.. Management of Sanitization

The original record and a copy of the sanitized version provided

-should-be-readily-available.irall.cases-Materials developed.within.an

agency or department in response to requests should be reviewed at an

appropriate level for completeness, responsiveness and accuracy. In

the case of documents or materials of a community nature, the release

should be done in coordination with the departments or agencies and/or

--3-

the Program Manager concerned and any sanitization should be agreed

upon during coordination.

9

NW 88608 Docld:32989628 Page 183

---

## Page 184

This proposed use of sanitization as a special arrangement.

to protect selected issues contained in material provided to Select

Committees by one agency may prove to be a futile exercise if not

practiced in common by all participating departments and agencies.

It is essential to the proposal that departments and agencies attempt

to employ the same criteria for sanitization and coordinate as

required. This paper can serve only as general guidelines on

sanitization.

By memorandum dated 3-20-75, you were advised of a

Director Sec'y -

request received from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities.

The Intelligence Division requested that an attempt be made to modify portions

of the Committee's request.

Regarding Part I titled Legal Authorities, the Intelligence Division

pointed out that this particular request was wide-ranging and required a considerable

file review as it requested any memorandum discussing the legal authority of

the FBI to "(1) investigate internal security matters, (2) collect intelligence

information, and (3) engage in counter-intelligence activities; together with

copies of all constitutional and statutory provisions, executive orders, presidential

directives, Attorney General opinions and memoranda, and any other materials

asserted as sources of such authority." With regard to Part II concerning the

FBI's administrative organization, they requested the identities by name of personnel

in the Intelligence Division, Unit Chief and above. This caused concern in the

Intelligence Division that there would be a needless proliferation of a list of

Bureau personnel working in this field which list, of course, would be of interest

to foreign intelligence sources.

On 4-1-75 Inspector John B. Hotis and SA Paul V. Daly discussed

these matters with William Miller, Staff Director of the Senate Select Committee;

John T. Elliff, who has been nominated to head the task force for the Committee

looking into FBI activities; F. A. O. Schwarz, Counsel to the Senate Select

Committee; and staff member Michael Epstein. They agreed to modify the request

in Part Ill to the extent that personnel in the Intelligence Division need not be.

identified by name below the level of Assistant Director in the organization chart.

to be furnished them pursuant to their request of 3-19-75. They asked as an

alternative the Bureau prepare a list o

of personnel in the Intelligence Division down

to the level of Unit Chief with names included which they would have access to

Ireview in Bureau space.

Legal Counsel to Adams Memo

RE: SENSTUDY 75

With regard to Part I relating to legal authorities, they stated

they were amenable to the Bureau furnishing them whatever documents they

have retrieved up to this time which have been recovered pursuant to their

request of 3-19-75 and that no additional detailed review need be conducted

until they review the aforementioned documents. At the end of their review

they will make any additional specific requests concerning this part of their

request. They also asked that in our response we furnish them copies of documents

listed on a three-page paper prepared by the staff of the Senate Select Committee,

a copy of which is attached.

Staff Director Miller requested that the Bureau expedite their

response to the Senate Select Committee's request as the first meeting of that

Committee is scheduled for Wednesday 4-0-75 and he felt strongly that they

вскольник

must have material that showed progress in their study of the FBl prior to that

time. Mr. Miller requested that, if necessary, the request be responded to in

a piecemeal basis and that the complete response does not necessarily have to

¿be made at one time.

It is suggested that we make available to this Committee as soon

as possible those documents which we have furnished the General Accounting

Office (GAO) which

"also fall within the 3-19-75 request of the Senate Select

Committee. In this regard staff members have advised they are in contact with

GAO auditors concerning the FBI.

By way of observations it is obvious that the staff members of

the Committee are well versed in Bureau policy and procedures. To this point

they have been cooperative and we should insure that we give a timely response

to their various requests.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) That the Intelligence Division advise whether modification

of the Senate Select Committee's request concerning legal authorities for

investigations and the modification of the table of organization of the Intelligence

Division are acceptable and, if so, expeditiously prepare the necessary response

to the Senate Select Committee.

(4) This material should be sent to the Deputy Attorney General

Committee.

The purpose of this memorandum is to recommend that all

responses for the production of records, etc., received from Congressional

committees be forwarded by letterhead memorandum through the Deputy

Attorney General to the requesting committee, and also that in selected instanges

a property stamp or statement be affixed to certain documents limiting access.

With the proliferation of committees in Congress looking into

FBI operations, it is essential that a standard procedure for the forwarding of

documents to the requesting committees be established. Inasmuch as requests

such as the request of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities

have been forwarded to this Bureau through the Department, it would appear V

logical that responses to such inquiries and all other inquiries of Congressional :

committees, whether they be directed to the Department and/or the Bureau,

be responded to through the Department. Such a procedure not only will mak

all our responses consistent but will also give the Department an opportunity

review and approve documents being made available to Congress.

In connection with our preparation of responses to requests of

Congressional committees, it is suggested that all responses should be by

letterhead memorandum, the first paragraph of which should clearly describe

the specitic request which is beins responded to in the letterhead memorandung

REC-18

62-116.395-

In those instances

here documents are of a nature that i doe

not desirous of unauthorized personnel, whether they be in Congress or otherwise,

having access to, we should affix a property stamp. This property stamp shoulders.

read as follows:

CI APR 11 1975

"This document is prepared in response to your request and

is not for dissemination outside of your Committee. Its use

is limited to official proceedings by your Committee and the

contents may not be disclosed to unauthorized personnel,without

the express approval of the FBI.

APPÉNDIX B

PERIODS OF PREDOMINANT MILITARY

INTERESTS:

NOT

INVOLVING MARTIAL LAW

I.

In time of war certain areas will come into prominence as

potential theaters of operation. When an armed forces commander

of such a potential theater is designated, he definitely nas

interest in, though not control of, the civilian life within the

area.

In order that the armed forces commander may prepare him-

self for the discharge of the possible responsibility which may

affix to him, the following procedure is agreed upon:

1. Agents of the FBI; of ONI; ID, Army; and the OS1, IG,

UoS. AlY Force Will continue to function in accordance with the

provisions of Sections II, III, IV, and V.

2.

In addition thereto, the armed forces commander may take

steps to analyze the facilities existing and to explore the

manner in which complete coverage will be obtained if martial lar

is declared.

Adequate liaison with the other subscribing agencies

will insure

that the armed forces commander will have the benetiz

of the experience, judgment and knowledge of the representatives

of the other agencies.

3. The armed forces commander is authorized to request and

receive such information from the other three agencies as he may

desire and they may be able to furnish.

II. The analysis and exploration referred to above will show the

coverage furnished by each of the subscribing agencies and any

additional coverage each subscribing agency can undertake.

When

the commander feels that more complete coverage is required, it

is recognized that he is authorized to augment the coverage with

such elements of the subscribing agencies as are under his

jurisdiction.

Prior to any invasion of the spheres normally

coming under

the cognizance of the other subscribing agencies;

the armed forces commander should obtain the necessary authority

from the Secretary of Defense.

III. Irrespective of the fact that the preceding recommendations

have placed the initiative in the hands of the armed forces

commander, Whenever any of the other services feel that such

a survey to determine adequacy of coverage should be undertaken,

it should be so recommended.

REGULATION OF EXPLOSIVES

1. General

Title XI of the captioned law amends Title 18, United

States Code, by adding a new chapter 40 with section numbers 841

through 848 governing the importation, manufacture, distribution

and storage of explosive materials and creating certain Federal

offenses pertaining to the unlawful use of explosives. Administration

of explosives regulation is vested in the Secretary of the Treasury

as is investigative jurisdiction over the unlawful acts proscribed

in section 842. Under authority contained in section 845 the

rederal bureau of Investigacion (BL, and che Bureau of Alconor.

Although not specified in chapter 40, the Postal

Inspection

•Gervico shull have jurisdiction iù investigaie all incidenis

involving explosive or incendiary devices sent through the mails

or directed against U.S. Postal Service property.

Title XI greatly broadens Federal-auchority pertaining to

explosives-connected offenses.

At the same time, Congress has

expressly disclaimed any intent to occupy the field in the exclusion

of state law on the same subject matter.

To effect both Congressional

purposes and to prevent unnecessary duplication of effort it is

essential that the limited Federal investigative resources be carefully

allocated, particularly in cases in which both the ATF and the FBI

have jurisdiction.

2. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Jurisdiction in General

(a) Effect on prior jurisdiction - This agreement applies

only to those incidents as to which the FBI had no investigative

jurisdiction prior to the enactment of the captioned law and to

incidents previously subject to FBI investigation by reason of chapter

65, Title 18, United States Code (malicious mischief). Investigative

procedures in other types of incidents (e.g., train wrecking, damaging

aircraft and motor vehicles, racketeering) shall remain unchanged.

The Postal Inspection Service shall have primary jurs-

diction to investigate all violations of section 844 which are

directed at U.S. Postal Service property or functions.

5. Special Considerations

The ATE and the

(a) Bomb Threats, falsa information (section 844(0) -

The ATF and the Postal Inspection Service shall have jurisdiction

over violations of section 844(e) against Treasury Department or

Postal Service property or functions, respectively.

have jurisdiction over all other violations of section 844(e). Upon

receipt of information alleging or suggesting a violation of subseccion

844(e), the investigative agency concerned will review available

information to determine whether the identity of the offender is

known or can be readily ascertained and, if not, whether the evidence

suggests a pactern or pian of such offenses by à parcicular offender

or against a particular victim.

If such a pattern appears or if the

offender is identified, all available information will be disseminated

as indicated in paragraph 6 below.

(b) Use/carrying explosive in conmission of a felony.

(section 844(h)) - Violations of 844(h) should be handled as an

adjunct of the felony from which they arise and should be discussed

with the appropriate United States Attorney or Division of the

Depariment handling prosecution of the underlying felony offense.

The agency having jurisdiction over the underlying felony will have

investigative jurisdiction over the 844(h) violation (e.g., bank

robbery is under FBi jurisdiction).

(c) Violations of 26 U.S.C. 5861 (destructive devices) -

In incidents involving alleged violations of 18 U.S.C. 844 (which

may also involve a violation of 26 U.S.C. 5861), ATF shall not

exercise its primary jurisdiction under 26 U.S.G. 5861 involving

destructive devices, but the incident shall be treated in accordance.

with the provisions of these guidelines.

This is in no way a

relinquishment by ATF of its investigative jurisdiction under 11tle

Il of the Gun Control Act of 1968.

5. Development of Background Information

Some incidents such as those directed against Federal

property or functions (paragraph 2(b) above, require immediate full

federal investigation.

others require a more circumspect approach

and will result in full Federal irvestigation only after considera-

tion of factors pertinent to the exercise of Federal jurisdiction.

Accordingly, in those incidents which these guidelines do not prescribe

immediate full investigation, the investigative agency having juris-

diction will develop background information which includes (a) facts

bearing on motivation such as involvement of the suspected perpetrators

in terroríst/revolutionary activities, organized crime, labor-management

disputes, or racial-religious hate activities; (b) the applicability

of state

and local laws and likelihood of state or local investigative

and prosecutive actions; and (c) any other available facts indicating

whether or not the offense warrants Federal investigation and prosecu-

tion.

Such background information will be submitted telephonically

(202-739-2745) or by teletype (710-822-0008) to the General Crimes

Section ne the Criminal Division and to the appropriate United States

Actorney, The Criminal Division will advise the investigative agency

concerned whether the matter warrants submission to any other

Division or Section of the Criminal Division, and when so warranted

the Crimnal Division will transmit the infornation to such other

Division or Section.

%. Full Investigation

A full investigation will be initiated immediately in

those instances wherein such investigation is specified herein.

In

other inscances full investigation will be initiated only upon direc-

tion of the Department of Justice after consideration by the Division

having cognizance over the matter of the background information

developed under paragraph 6 above.

8. Reports

Copies of case reports prepared in matters investigated under

these guidelines will be furnished directly to the Department of Justice

and the appropriate United States Attorney. All investigative agencies

NW 88608 Docld:32989628 Page 223

---

## Page 224

-6 .

shall submit initial reports as soon as practicable to the Department

of Justice and shall submit progress reports once each 30 days or

as soon thereafter as possible.

The Criminal Division of the

Department of Justice will be informed as soon as possible in each

instance wherein an investigative agency initiates an investigation

under section 844. Such notification is of critical importance to

the avoidance of duplication of investigative activities. Also each

agency subscribing to these guidelines shall, upon instituting inves

tigation regarding possible violations of section 844, immediately

notify other subscribing agencies having a logical interest therein.

Also, a sufficient level of follow-up liaison and dissemination shall

be maintained to avoid duplication of investigative effort.

Additionally, each such agency will exchange information

on a timely basis and in a manner which will not interfere with

ongoing investigations relative to types, scurces, movement, and

storage of explosives which are the subject of its investigations.

Information regarding significant developments in investigations

being conducted under these guidelines and information of an intelli

gence nature developed incidental to investigations which is of logical

interest to the Department of Justice shall be furnished promptly to

the Criminal Division of that Department which will be responsible

for any necessary further dissemination within that Department.

9. Review of Guidelines .

These guidelines shall be reviewed on a continuing basis by

the parties hereto to determine whether problems exist in their admin-

istration which should be alleviated or whether modification of any of

the terms of the agreement are needed in the interests of better law

enforcement.

"AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION AND THE UNITED STATES

SECRET SERVICE CONCERNING PROTECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES

["I. Purpose of Agreement

"The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) originates, and receives from

large numbers of reports on individuals and organizations.

One purpose of this agreement is to define that portion of the information

on Ille with, or received or originated by, the FBl, which the United States

secret Service USSS desires to receive in connection with 1ts protective

responsibilities.

"The USSS has statutory authority to protect, or to engage in certain

activities to protect,

interview individuals who might constitute a threat to the President or cer-

tain other persons.

killing or kidnaping and attempts or conspiracies to kill or kidnap

the

President and other designated individuals.

: "The FBI will make available to the USSS information it may ragucot di inéve-

native wiicis uy its nature reveals a definite

or possible threat to the

safety of the President and certain other persons.

"A second purpose of this agreement is to insure the most effective pro-

tection for the President and certain other peisons by establishing

a clear

division of responsibility between the FBI and the USSS.

Such division

will also avoid compromising investigations or sources and needless duplica-

¡tion of effort.

+ "II: General Responsibilities

1 President until they reach 16 years of age, unless such protection is declined;

protecting persons who are determined from

time to time by the Secretary

of the Treasury,

after consultation with the Advisory Committee, as being

major residential and Vice Presidential candidates who should receive

protection (unless the candidate has declined such protection); protecting

rule is accurate and does not present legal problems.

The statement in the attached of the Third Agency

As an observation paragraph number 7 of the

document titled "Handling of third Agency Matters in Response to

Congressional Select Committee" dated March 28, 1975, (attached)

appears to be subject to various interpretations. This paragraph and

in particular the second sentence of the paragraph appears to allow the

agency receiving the Committee's request to respond in instances where

a Third Agency is indirectly involved and the material is sensitive with-

out first contacting the Third Agency. Any notification of the Third

Agency in this instance of the furnishing of such information to the

Committee would be after the fact.

The term indirectly is not defined.

Additionally, this paragraph allows the Agency receiving the Committee's

request to respond in instances where a Third Agency is directly involved

and the material is nonsensitive without checking with the Third Agency

involved. It would appear the language in paragraph number 7 should

be tightened up and the appropriate terms defined.

The Third Agency Rule

8

Ter

ALL.

IDATIO

1. As early as November 1953, the third agency rule was

included in Executive Order 10501, which has now been revoked.

Section 7(c) prohibited the dissemination of "classified defense

information originating in another Depariment or agency" to an

agency "outside the receiving Department or agency without the

consent of the originating Department or agency". The only excep-

tion to this rule is that dissemination may be made under the authority

of Section 102 of the National Security Act. This section authörizes--

the Director of Central Intelligence "to correlate and evaluate intelli-

gence relating to the national security, and provide for the appropriate

dissemination of such intelligence within the Government using, where

appropriate, existing agencies and facilities".

2. Historically, the responsibility of the DCI to disseminate

intelligence has referred to "finished intelligence". This product is

the end result of contributions from members of the Intelligence Commu-

nity. Therefore, in this situation the finished product is ay homogenous

product and therefore the approval for further dissemination beyond the

receiving agency must come from the Central Intelligence Agency.

3. Executive Order 10501 was superseded by Executiva Ürder

11652 which became effective 1 June 1972. This Executive order did not

specifically .cover the third agency rule. However, it does provide the

following controls: Sec.. 9, Spacial Departmental Arrangements. The

originating Department or other appropriate authority may impose, in

conformity with the provisions of this order, special requirements with

respect to access, distribution and protection of classified information

and material, including those which presently relate to communications

intelligence, intelligence sources and methods and cryptography.

4. In anticipation of the implementation of Executive Order

11652, a directive was issued on May 17, 1972 entitled "National Security

Council Directive Governing the Classification, Downgrading, Declassi-

fication and Safeguarding of National Security Information". This

-directive does not contain the term "third agency rule" but does have

four subsections which relate to procedures which are similar to whai

historically had been called the third agency rule. These sections are:

NW 88608 Docld:32989628 Page 241

A. (2) Determination of Need-to-Know. In addition ti ¿

security clearance, a person must have a need for access

to the particular classified information or material sought

in connection with the performance of his official duties or.

tractual obligations. The dete:

nation of that need

shall be made by officials having responsibility for the

classified information or material.

D. Consent of Originating Department to Dissemination

by Recipient. Except as otherwise provided by Section

102 of the National Security Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 495, 50

U.S.C. 403, classified information or material originating

in one Department shall not be disseminated outside any

other Department to which it has been made available

without the consent of the originating Department.

E. Dissemination of Sensitive Intelligence Information.

Information or material bearing the notation "WARNING

NOTICE -- SENSITIVE INTELLIGENCE SOURCES AND

METHODS INVOLVED" shall not be disseminated in any

manner outside authorized channels without the permission

of the originating Department and an assessment by the

senior intelligence official in the disseminating Department

as to the potential risk to the national security and to the

intelligence sources and methods involved.

F. Restraint on Special Access Requirements. The

establishment of special rules limiting access to, distri-

bution and protection of classified information and material

under Section 9 of the Order requires the specific prior

annenval of the head of ? Depertment ou his dosignas.

5. Examples of the application of the Third Agency Rule are:

(a) In a national security estimate, contributions are

received from all members of the Intelligence Community and.

then disseminated to members of the community under the

authority of the DCI;

(b) A CIA intelligence report disseminated to the State

Department may not be sent by the State Department to

CIA;

(c) Information which the CIA furnishes the President's

Commission may not be disseminated to other agencies or

to the Congress without the concurrences of CIA. Thus,

a request from the Congress to the Commission for CIA

information should be referred to CIA for action so that

the necessary protection of the information can be insured.

If the Navy Department discus

es one of its operations

with CIA, CIA may not include information about that operation

in papers it disseminates to other agencies unless it has

received the permission of the Navy Department. The distinc-

tion here is that a Navy operation would not be considered part

of the finished intelligence mechanism and therefore would

not fall within the statutory authority of CIA to disseminate

intelligence.

Director Sec'y

By agreement, the FBI is currently conducting full field

investigations resarding SSC staff personnel. These have extremely

short (2 week) deadlines which are identical

to those afforded

Presidential appointments and are, therefore, given preferential

treatment in opening, assigning, and following field progress.

Section, which

has about twice its normal case load, is handling

these requests.

that between 35 and 40 staff members would be submitted for investi

gation.

As of today, 4-3-75, we have received requests for 65 such

investigations from

the SSC and the end does not appear to be in

sight.

They are received in bunches as many as 6 at a time, which

is not the even flow expected and presents an additional burden,

UNTRAC

In addition it is expected that similar requests will be-

forthcoming in the near future from the HSC since we have a simlar

agreement

with it.

Congressman Nedzi, Chairman of the HSC, has

estimated "probably no more than about 25 staff members will be

hired." It remains to be seen if this estimate also falls short of

actual receipts.

Since there is no charge for these full field investigati

they will have to be considered in the budget. It is noted the

current charge for a lullatiza investigation, where applicable, is

Director Sec'y —

This memorandum recommends than the attached

draft of

a paper prepared by CIA entitled, Ambiguities and

the Law," be reviewed by the Legal Counsel Division for comment

and that a member of the Division be named to represent the FBI

in future meetings with legal representatives from other U. s.

Intelligence Board (USIB) agencies and departments.

The purpose

of such a group is to develop recommendations for changes

in

existing laws or the proposal of new legislation which Mr. Colby

as the Director of Central Intelligence can offer to the Senate

Select Committee for their consideration.

At a meeting of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on

Congressional Review of the Intelligence Community 2/27/75, a

draft paper entitled, "Ambiguities and the Law," was distributed

to all members.

This paper was drafted by Mr.

Marvin Smith of

CIA.

It is considered a starting point for the Intelligence

Community to identify areas in existing statutes that should be

ties, the limitations and missions of various member agencies

changed, as well as to recommend new legislation deemed necessary

or departments of the Intelligence Community.

8/0

DATE/

In furnishing copies of this paper to members, the

Chairman of the Ad Hoc Group, Mr. John Clarke, acknowledged the

paper presents a starting point and in no way should be considered

a final draft. He suggested that Legal Counsel representatives

of each agency or department of USIB review the

document and

submit their comments directly to Mr. Marvin Smith, on Agency

code 143, extension 4055.

Following

the receipt of such comments

from the legal offices of member agencies and departments, it

was proposed that a meeting would be called in an effort to

begin drafting a paper representative of the Intelligence Community

which would reflect recommended changes in existing statutes or

proposals for new

legislation.

AMBIGUITIES AND THE LAW

CIA, NSA, DIA, FBI and, to some extent,

several other'

Federal Agencies, collect information and produce intelligence, but

of different kinds and for different purposes. This is recognized in

practice but is not as clearly established in the law. Given some

lack of clarity in the law and some uncertainty regarding limits

placed on intelligence activities, misunderstanding and fear of abuse

of power easily thrives. In reality, however, in the implementation

of mission and charters and in direction and control, there are not

as many unresolved ambiguities as the uninformed may suppose:

The experience following the National Security Act of 1947 is

such that it is now possible to eliminate some of the vagueness of

the language of the Act. The certainty and public confidence that

should result from clarifications in the law should far outweigh any

disadvantages. A number of possible amendments or additions to

current laws have already been mentioned, and proposed legislation

has already been submitted for some. These ideas and others are

suggested, below.

.

1) Clarify CIA's mission and charter by

amending the National Security Act of 1947 to *

reflect:

--that included in the proper functions

of the Agency are (a) collection of foreign

intelligence information; (b) conduct of

activities to carry out CIA's counter-

intelligence responsibilities overseas;

and (c) conduct of covert action operations

overseas when authorized by the President;

--that CIA's responsibility to produce

intelligence relates only to foreign

intelligence;

--that it is a duty of the Agency to develop

advanced technical equipment to improve

the collection and processing of foreign

intelligence information; and

NW 88608 Docld:32989628 Page 250

---

## Page 251

--that the conduct of any counterintelligence

operation or other activity overseas directed

specifically at U.S. citizens (other than CIA

employees) will be undertaken in coordination

with the FBI or as requested by the FBI or by

other USG agencies in coordination with the FBI.

Establish the authority for those agencies engaged

in the collection and production of foreign intelligence to

carry on certain specified activities within the United

States, such as:

--protection of classified information and

their own installations against penetration

and compromise;"

--investigation of employees, applicants,

and those persons who could assist the U.S.

foreign intelligence effort;

--investigation of employees and other

--collection of foreign intelligence

information from foreign nationals and.

from cooperating U.S. citizens;

-- establishment of mechanisms in support

of foreign intelligence activities; and

-- cooperation with the FBI in investigations

relating to the unauthorized disclosure of

foreign intelligence.

3) Remove uncertainty regarding responsibility for

internal security matters by modifying appropriate laws to

establish clearly:

--that the collection of counterintelligence

information in the United States and the

collection of information related to internal

security are functions of the FBI;

NW 88608 Docld:32989628 Page 252

---

## Page 253

--that the responsibility for the

production of intelligence related to •

internal security rests with the FBI; and

--that with due regard to assessed

reliability of the information and

responsibilities for protecting sources

and methods, those agencies engaged in

foreign intelligence activities will make

available to the FBI and other Federal

agencies, as appropriate, the security

and counterintelligence information relating

to foreign nationals in the United States and

to U.S. citizens which is derived as a by-

product of foreign intelligence activities.

4) Recognize international terrorism and international

illegal drug activities as threats to U,S. national security

and proper targets for U.S. foreign intelligence efforts,

as well as for internal security operations.

to foreign intelligence and foreign

counterintelligence;

--assigning to the Director of the Federal

Bureau of Investigation the duty of protecting

intelligence sources and methods related to

internal security and to counterintelligence

--imposing specific burdens, upon officers

and employees of all branches of the gowern-

ment and others granted official access, not

to disclose such information without authorization,

and providing criminal sanctions for unauthorized

disclosures;

--establishing effective injunctive recourse,

through the Attorney General, for protection

of all intelligence sources and methods:

--providing for in camera judicial review

of material ievealing intelligence sources

and methods when relevant and necessary

to criminal and civil proceedings;

--delineating authorities and responsibilities.

for investigating

suspected or discovered

unauthorized disclosures by (a) U.S. citizens

overseas

and (b) all persons within the

United States.

6) Delineate areas

of interagency assistance that

facilitate performance of authorized missions, promote

• economy of resources, and as a matter of policy are

desirable, for example:

NW 88608 Docld:32989628 Page 255

---

## Page 256

-8-

--cooperation in research and development

of technical collection and information pro-

cessing equipment, methods and techniques;

-loan or supply of equipment, methods and

techniques;

--provision of training in special skills and

techniques;

--passage of information derived as a by-

product of foreign intelligence activities to

those

agencies responsible for the matters

involved.

• A few changes in the procedures for reviewing intelligence

activities might add considerable understanding and confidence. Of

paramount importance is a form of congressional oversight that permits

the provision to Congress of the necessary information in a timely,

efficient and controlled manner. It is recognized that a number of

Committees in both the Senate and House must be informed of sub-

stantive intelligence, operational matters and fiscal details in varying

degrees. Just as in the executive branch, the test of access should be

NW 88608 Docld:32989628 Page 256

---

## Page 257

-9-

"need-to-know." To apply this test and to control and protect

sensitive information provided to Congress, a focal point within..

Congress would be extremely helpful. Whether a joint committee

or not,

such a focal point would also be valuable in facilitating

changes in laws affecting intelligence activities. Congress might

find that a more uniform approach to budget presentation and review

would provide better insight and understanding-

The foregoing suggestions are by no means definitive.

They

do, however, present areas that in the experience of the intelligence

community deserve careful attention.

This memorandum recommends that the Legal Counsel

Divisions for the collection and preparation of certain materials

we anticipate the Senate Select Committee (SSC) will soon request

from the FBI.

Memorandum W. O. Cregar to W. R. Wannall, dated

3/5/75, reported the results of a meeting between Senator Church

and Mr. Colby wherein Senator Church advised he anticipated

asking all agencies and departments of the Intelligence Community

for (1) Organizational charts broken down to a branch level going

back to 1947, (2) Copies of all budgets since 1947 and (3) Docu

ments reflecting all cash flows since 1947.

Attached is a copy of a short letter from Mr. John

Clarke, Chairman of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congres-

sional

Review of the Intelligence Community to Mr. William G.

Miller, Staff Director, SSC.

Also attached is a copy of a

memorandum from Mr. Clarke to all members of the Ad Hoc Coordina-

ting Group on Congressional Review of the Intelligence Community.

This memorandum sets out in more detail what information the

SSC will be seeking from all agencies making up the Intelligence

Community. It should be noted that on page two of Mr. Clarke's

memorandum he notes a formal request from Senator Church to all

agencies can be expected.

The Intelligence Division believes considerable time

and effort will be required from several Divisions to pull this

information together. It is believed we should begin now to

assemble the data in anticipation

REGENTION CONTRARYT

Dear

Pursuant to your request, I have advised all members of the Ad Hoc

•Group of the United States Intelligence Board and MI. Thomas K. Latimer,

Special Assistant to the Secretary of Defense, of Senator Church's request

to provide legal authority and organization charts of USIB entities from

their inception.

I also have alerted them to the Committee's desire for

comprehensive historical data on personnel, budgets, and cash flow for

the same periods. They will expect to hear moré directly from Senator

Church on these matters.

By early next week, we will begin providing you the CIA data in

response to the Chairman's request. The first set of annexes developed

under the auspices of the USIB Ad Hoc Group is ready and I am having

are desired.

Sincerely,

SUBJECT:

Information Requested by Senate Select

Committee Staff Director

I. Senator Church has asked the Director to provide to the

Senate Select Committee Copies of CIA legal authorities and organi-

zation charts to branch levels, 1247-1975. He also indicated he

manis similar authorities aud charis fui all JOIG entliies from

their inceptions. In the case of ClA this will be from 1947; NSA

from 1952; DIA from 1961: etc.

The Committee is seeking a comprehensive historical

base hue for each U.S. intelligence organization its structure and

the people mvalved over time.

therefore, Senator Church has asked

that the names of all incumbents, who have beid supervisory responsi

bilities over the period, down through the branch level, also be pro-

wided. The Staff Director has heen made aware of the difficulties

involved in tracing personnel assignments too far back but asks that

every eifart be made to, meet the request. CIA is proceeding

accerdingly.

Sovator Church has also asked for budget and cash flow

date on all IS. intelligence organizations from their inceptions.

The Cia finds that the source, and uses tables, employed in annual

mancial reports. provides the historical profile desired. Supple-

mental data on specific programs can follow it requested. Senator

Church wants: data which will show specific patterns of expenditures

as distinct from budgets and appropriations. A formal request

from the Chairman to all agencies on this matter can be expected.

4. The Senate Select Committee will be ready to receive

classified material this week. It is suggested that Ad Hoc Group

members begin assembling the legal, organizational, personnel,

and budgetary data for early submission. I have provided Mr.

Miller, Staff Director, with a list of Ad Hoc Principals, phone

dated 3/12/75, the Legal Counsel Division indicated that its

Legislative Matters Section would coordinate and assign

responsibilities within the Bureau for the collection and

preparation of material for tue Senate Select Committee.

This memorandum instructed Intelligence Division

to accumulate data which was identified in a memorandum from

Mr. John M. Clarke from the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group of the be

Intelligence Committee. Clarke's memorandum was attached to

W. 0. Cregar to W. R. Wannall memorandum dated 3/6/75.

• The identified data to be collected outlined in Clarke's memorandum

was proposed-type data that the Senate Select Committee has

- indicated an interest in.

In view of 3/19/75 letter subsequently received from

Senator Frank Church (Democrat, Idauo), Chairman of the Senate

Select Committee, to tre Attorney General outlning a request for

specific FBI documents they are interested in receiving, the

Intelligence Division has begun accumulating this specitic data.

In view of this request for specific data, the Intelligence Division

will not accumulate the data outlined in the Clarke memorandum

since it was only in the nature of proposed data and differs from

the specific data to be collected which is extensive in nature.

Memorandum captioned as above, 3/27/75, from Legal

Counsel to you, noted that you and Wannall were to meet with

Mx. Hills and Mr. Phillip Buchen, Counsel to the President,

on

3/28/75.

Your addendum to the memorandum pointed out the

results of this meeting and the various matters discussed.

As a follow-up to this meeting, you, Legal Counsel

Mintz and Wannall met on 4/4/75 with Mr. James Wilderotter,

who is presently working under Mr. Buchen in coordinating

intelligence community matters relating to the inquiries

underway by the Senate Select Committee. Mr. Wilderotter was

(5)

given a briefing similar to that which had been afforded to

Buchen and Hills. In addition, the discussion covered matters

a sensitive nature relating

to the ORCHID and similar programs.

electronic surveillances, specialized handling of informants,

and Bureau Source 4 (access to social security records).

Many of

these matters discussed covered topics with which Mr. Wilderotter

had become familiar when he was assigned to the Department as an

Assistant to former Deputy Attorney General Silberman.

Wilderotter said it was the feeling at The White House

that while raw fBI files should not be made available to the

Committee, it might be necessary to permit the Committee to review

a few such

files in order that the integrity of the FBl could be

established with the Committee.

It was pointed out to him that

we did not agree to this that

we could furnish summaries of

materia1 Irom the Illes.

furnishing reports and letterhead memoranda which had been

prepared for dissemination would satisfy the Committee's

needs.

He was advised by both you and Mr. Mintz that it was

our feeling that we should not furnish the raw

material but

summaries could be prepared for the Committee's purposes and

if necessary, Bureau officials could be placed under oath

and attest to the correctness of the summaries. Wilderotter

said that this was a matter which he would afford further

consideration.

As during the conference with Buchen and Hills,

it was obvious as the result of our meeting with Wilderotter

that The White House was most anxious that it not be caught

by surprise by revelations of activities which in any way

every effort possible to become

cognizant of any such situation

prior to the Committee hearings.

Classified "Top Secret" to protect highly sensitive

investigative techniques and matters relating to foreign

relations.

ACTION:

For information. Further contacts with Wilderotter

or other White House Staff Members will be duly reported.

On 3-10-15 Protessor John T. Ellit advised Inspector John B.

Hotis that he had been contacted by William Miller, Staft Director for the

Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities, and was asked to serve

as Director of the Committee's Task Force on Domestic Intelligence. This

is one of four Task Forces being formed by the Select Committee and it

will focus primarily on the activities of the FBI. The other Task Forces

are on Foreign Intelligence, Military and Technological Intelligence, and

Command and Control.

Elliff said he had not decided whether to accept the offer

and believed that others were also being considered for the position. He

said he was reluctant to do anything that would interfere with the excellent

working amagemens he had developed with the Bureau. He feels that his

initial obligation is to the Director, and the purpose of going to the Police

Foundation was to get formal support for a project that would be of primary

E

benefit to the Bureau and only secondarily to the Attorney General and Congresse

He said he would be guided by our judgment in this matter and not want to

break any commitments that he might have made with the Bureau.

It he accepts the appoiniment Elliff said he would, of course,

suspend work on his research project until he had terminated his employment

with the Committee. He said he would also agree not to use any classified

material that he acquired in his capacity as Task Force Director. Elliff

has discussed this matter with John Heaphy, Assistant Director of the Police

Foundation. Heaphy said the Foundation had no objections whatsoever for

his accepting the position with the Senate Select Committee, and he would

be tree to resume his projeci arter the Committee work was gone

Legal Counsel to Adams Memo

RE: JOHN T. ELLFF

It should be noted that the Select Committee considered

offering the position to LarryBaskir, Counsel to the President's_Clemency

Board. Mr. Basku formerly served as Chief Counsel to Senator Ervin's

Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights, and we had numerous contacts

with him in that capacity. Our purpose was to reach some common agreement

on privacy legislation that Senator Ervin planned to introduce in the 93rd

Session of Congress. There were numerous meetings with Baskir on the

same subject in the Deputy Attorney General's office. These efforts proved

unsuccessful and after several months we discontinued the discussions.

In our opinion, Mr. Baskir was unwilling to work out any reasonable

compromise and seemed unsympathetic to the legislation concerns of law

enforcement.

It is clear that this is a matter for Professor Elliff to

determine and the Bureau should not express an official opinion. Although

we have not always agreed with his views on intelligence matters, we

have had no occasion to question his objectivity or his integrity as a scholar.

Mr. Miller knows that Professor Elliff enjoys our confidence and it is

our understanding that he offered Elliff the position in order to avoid an

adversary relationship between the Bureau and the Committee.

Professor Elliff said he would make no commitments to

the Senate Committee until he hears from us.

RECOMVENDATION:

That Professor Elliff be advised that it would be inappropriate

for us to express an opinion on whether he should accept the appointment

offered by the Senate Select Committee.

The following items of interest were discussed:

Mr. William G. Miller, Staff Director of the Senate

Select Committee (SSC),

and the Committee's Counsel, Mr. F.A.0.

Schwarz, III, Visited CIA Headquarters to discuss SSC business.

Mr. Miller suggested that a tactic the SSC was considering is

the identification of several key issues that the Committee

to identify two or three covert actions engaged in by CIA and

examine them in-depth rather than try to cover each and every

covert action CIA might identify. Colby advised that this

appeared to be an encouraging development and possibly each

agency of the Intelligence Community might be asked to provide

a series of key issues from which the Select Committee could

Memorandum for Mr. Wannall

RE: SENSTUDY 75

Both Miller and Schwarz accepted the Third Agency

Rule and agreed to abide by it. For the record, the SSC's

interpretation of the Third Agency Rule (which is consistent

with the Intelligence Community) is as follows: Classified

information or material originating in one department shall

not be disseminated outside any other department to which it

has been made available without the consent of the originating

department.

The Security Committee of the United States Intelli-

gence Board (USIB) will meet to develop some ground rules and

standardization for sanitizing documents to be furnished to

the Select Committees.

The question of Intelligence Community personnel being

represented by counsel was discussed. The position of the White

House on this issue has been fully reported in a memorandum from

the Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams, dated 3/27/75, entitled "Senate

Associate Counsel to the President."

It was also agreed at the meeting of 3/25/75 that the

President's Counsel would attempt to negotiate with the sSc to

insure that all interviews of Intelligence Community personnel

would be conducted on the premises of the bureau, agency or

department employing the persons to be interviewed.

Attached also for the record are the following:

A letter dated 3/20/75 from Staff Director William G.

Miller to Mr. John Clarke advising that Mr. Ben Marshall has beer

designated as the Security Officer of the SSC:

A letter dated 3/17/75 from Mr. Miller to Mr. Clarke

listing employees of the SSC who have been cleared by the

Committee for certification by CIA for access to classified

information up to and including "Top Secret";

A letter from Mr. Miller to Mr. Clarke dated 3/20/75

advising that Mr. Ben Marshall was cleared for access to

classified information up to and including "Top Secret";
