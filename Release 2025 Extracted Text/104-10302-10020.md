Meanwhile, a Cuban group, which had probably planned to

INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS:

Noscow has given rather standard treatment to the OAS

meeting which heard the Venezuelan Government charge Castro

with illegal arms shipments.

On 4 December, TASS correspond-

ent.: Leonid Shokin reported

that "the weavers of plots against

revolutionary Cuba

are still at it...accusing it of delivery

¡of arms to Venezuela for 'subversive purposes'."..

Shokin found

"certain US circles are the most interester in this, as is

evident from the fact that representatives of the US State

Department declared at the meeting that the United States

'would

'firmly support' additional economic and diplomatic

sanctions by the OAS against Cuba." He thought it unexcep-

tional that

"these provocative attempts were not supported by

the largest Latin American countries" and warned that "such

attempts to interfere in Cuban internal affairs are fraught

with extremely harmful consequences for the cause of peace."

(CIA/FBIS, Moscow, 4 December, UNCLASSIFIED)

CUBAN INTERNAL SITUATION:

Several weeks

ago there were CAS reports that the storm-

tossed peasants of Oriente looked on Hurricane Flora as the

vengeance of God--a God, who in the tradition of the old

Testament's stern and sometimes vengeful Jehovah, had loosed

his fury on a people first seduced and now impressed by an

alien regime.

Now a report from the US Naval Base at Guan-

tanamo Bay provides yet another insight into the frame of mind

of the Cuban populace.

While the incidents pictured in this

report do not necessarily reflect anything other than a com-

bination of religious fervor and superstition, they are signifi-

cant to the extent that they reflect the unrest--and, perhaps

a growing feeling of hopelessness and despair--current among

the Cubans.

In any case, there are prevalent locally tales of St.

¡Barbara's appearing several times to prophesy a change in the

regime or admonish errant youths to mend their ways. /Barbara,

i virgin daughter of the heathen Diosorus, was beheaded by her

father near Heliopolis in 235 A.D. for embracing Christianity.

A fearful thunderclap is alleged

to have greeted her execution.

Symbolized by a windmill-like tower with three windows, the

white he vat absent tros home,

while he was absent from home, Barbara is the patroness of

artillerymen and miners.

/In the Church's calendar, her feast is marked on 4 Decem-

ber.

- Apart from her significance in the Christian ritual,

Barbara figures prominently in a neo-pagan cult known as

the Santeria. Devotees of Santeria regard themselves as

Catholics and believe that the names of the Catholic saints

are translations into Spanish of the Nigerian names of African

gods.

Catholicism is viewed as the Spanish tribal version of

Santeria. The association between Catholicism and Santeria

is based on a largely superficial similarity between Catholic

saints and the pantheon of African spirit gods. Saint Barbara

is thought to be Shango, the God of War!?

According to one of these tales, a

woman dressed in

martyr's red stopped a bus outside Guantanamo City on 25 No-

vember, stepped inside and berated the Castro regime.

The

woman is alleged to have said that the Cuban people could

not live forever in such misery and to have predicted that

Castro would be taken from them sometime between 4 and 7 De-

cember.

A militiaman passenger told her that she would be

arrested when the bus

arrived in the city.

When it had, she'd

disappeared.

Continuing on to Caimanera, the bus stopped in

the town square with the same woman sitting on one of the

seats inside the vehicle.

Dolores Ibarruri, "La Pasionaria" of Spanish Civil War fame

and secretary general

of the Spanish Communist Party, arrived in

Havana from Moscow on 5 December, according to press reports.

Ibarruri, who resides in Moscow, was invited to Cuba by Castro

during his visit to the Soviet Union. (The New York Times,

6 December, UNCLASSIFIED)

CUBAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT:

Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, minister of INRA, has expressed

serious dissatisfaction with Cuba's current agricultural situa-

tion and revealed that he disagrees with Castro's emphasis on

"ultimate aims" in place of current "tactics."

In a long talk

with the British ambassador in early November, Rodriguez agreed

"with surprising enthusiasm" that the two main problems facing

Cuban agriculture were the lack of competent personnel to run

the appropriated farms, and the lack of consumer goods which

are necessary to stimulate production, especially by the remain-

ing private farmers. Rodriguez had advised Castro that there

were not sufficient

agricultural experts to run the state farms

which had been previously organized, and he had counseled against

taking over medium-size farms (as the Second Agrarian Reform Law

did) until

sufficiently trained and experienced personnel were

available; he commented on Soviet complaints about the low edu-

cational level of Cubans sent to the USSR for agricultural

training.

Rodriguez said that despite his advice, Castro had

gone ahead with the Second Agrarian Reform Law for two "polit-

ical" reasons: to push ahead with the progress of Cuba's

Socialist economy, and to destroy the support for counterrevo-

lutionaries which

Castro believed existed among the "rural

bourgeois."

Rodriguez thought it ironical that US pressure on

Cuba (presumably he meant aid to counterrevolutionaries) had

forced Cuba to seize lands faster than it would otherwise have

done. He also stated his belief that the seizure of medium-

size farms would lead to a drop for several years in many

branches of Cuban agriculture, particularly in market gardening

and dairy farming.

Rodriguez also agreed with the British

ambassador that the

second problem

facing Cuban agriculture was the lack of consumer

goods which were necessary to stimulate production.

However

Rodriguez said that Cuba was in a vicious circle:

not have incentive to produce because there were

goods available, yet such goods could not be obtained until

A got such so

farmers did

few consumer

farm production had been raised. Rodriguez' main concern

seemed to be the scarcity of many consumer goods; in fact, he

admitted that he was willing to undertake temporary expediencies

which might help raise production, even though they might be

"doctrinally unwelcome." Rodriguez referred the ambassador to

Lenin's New Economic Policy, and made no attempt to disguise his

disagreement with Castro's insistence on "ultimate aims" instead

of current "tactics."

Cuba is taking further steps to improve its fishing industry.

A Havana radiobroadcast reported the completion of several con-

struction projects in the Chuyima shipyards in the Almendares

esplanade measuring 17,000 square meters with a capacity of 24

SHIPPING SUPPORT FOR CUBA:

The US Embassy in Beirut believes that Lebanon may act

to curtail the use of its ships in the Cuban trade.

This would

result in a significant decline in Cuban shipping in free world

bottoms because Lebanese companies provided ten of the thirty-

two free world ships which called at Cuba in October. The

Lebanese foreign minister planned to ask the cabinet for a pro-

visional measure whereby he would be able to demand that all

ships carrying Lebanese flag must call at Lebanon periodically

and report their destinations.

He believed this would cut

the Cuban traffic quickly by 60 percent. Because

Us aid to

Lebanon is almost nonexistent, the US Embassy believes that

this Lebanese action would be prompted by motives of princi-

discussed by the us congress.

The us consul

the real representatives of the people are to be found in the

Dr. Kring said that he was impressed by the woman's utter

sincerity and normal behavior.

He believed she was convinced

of the truth of her story and of the honesty of her friend..

the woman had apparently, at some earlier date, contacted the

FBI in connection with her friend's participation or knowledge

of a coup in honduras.

She later retracted her story because

she felt it seemed "too implausible and silly."
