Election campaigning ended

at midnight, but boosters for the

several

candidates continued to mill

about streets of Caracas in defiance

of terrorist threats to shoot anyone

who ventured out for the next three

days.

b.

The terrorists, it seems,

were all but drowned out by the car-

nival air.

c.. The FALN, meanwhile, is

trying

to bargain off Colonel Chenault

for as high a price as it can, de-

manding variously release of all its

comrades, of all women detained by

the government, and of the six hi-

jackers who have been returned from

Trinidad to custody in Venezuela.

a. The Chinese Communists

will have nothing to do with the

idea of bilateral talks with the

Soviets under present circumstances.

Chinese party Secretary

General Teng Hsiao-ping, one of the

select few in Peiping's ruling cir-

cle, recently told a group of visit-

Ing Latin Americans that such a meet-

ing could accomplish nothing.

c. Teng put the issue of

another meeting of world Communist

parties

even deeper into limbo by

saying that Peiping would be in favor

only when

assured of the support of

a majority of the world parties.

d. Moscow, for its part, has

apparently stopped thinking about

another gathering of world Communist

party representatives.

e.

The feelers it put out

after the conclusion of the test-

ban treaty were received coldly by

some of the fraternal parties. They

felt such a meeting could only make

matters worse with the Chinese.

Indeed, Peiping saw this

to be Moscow's purpose, and when

the idea failed to take hold, the

Chinese took it to be a setback for

Khrushchev personally.

g. Their reaction to Khrush-

chev's subsequent call for a cessa-

tion of open argument was to press

the offensive, and this they have

been doing in roundly abusive terms

since.

h. The forthcoming Afro-Asian

visits by Chou En-lai and Chen Yi

have

awakened suspicions that the

Chinese are in hot pursuit of a

second Bandung-type conference--a

more rewarding enterprise from their

point of view.

a. Yesterday and on Thursday,

we detected what we believe to have

been operational training launches

of standard 350 nautical mile sub-

marine-based ballistic missiles.

b. Two and possibly four mis-

siles were fired from submarines

based in the Petropavlovsk area to

the impact area at Klyuchi.

C. seven similar instances

have been detected previously this

year, and there may have been others.

(INTERCEPTS)

a.

The Soviet Bloc will soon

gain an important propaganda outlet

in Nairobi, communications hub for

East Africa.

b. Plans are for a state-

controlled news agency to be set up

by the Kenyan government when it

ber •

This will fall under the juris-

diction of communications minister

Oneko, who has well developed con-

tacts within the Soviet Bloc.

C. TASS has already agreed to

equip the new agency, and Kenyan re-

quests for further financial and

techincal help are being discussed

in Prague and Moscow.

d.

Kenyan journalists have

been training in Prague and, on re-

turn, will find ready employment in

Czechoslovakia-

USSR

a. Czech President Novotny

returned from Moscow on Thursday

after signing a renewal (for another

20 years) of the treaty of friend-

ship and mutual assistance.

b. He apparently got little

else out of Khrushchev.

The final

communique was conspicuously cool.

There were no Soviet con-

cessions, nor were there the usual

references to Czech "propress" or

to public support for Novotny's

leadership.

South Vietnam

a.

The first suicide by burn-

ing to occur under the new

regime

was

witnessed today by bystanders

at a crowded intersection in Saigon

where a young girl went up in flames.

b. A note she left behind said

she was protesting the war of Viet-

namese against Vietnamese.

At the

intersection are three villas which

house the ICC delegations.

C. There were no Buddhist

overtones.

d. Some think the Viet Cong

encouraged her, but if they did,

they did not write her script.

They

would have said it is the Americans

who are fighting the Vietnamese.

NOTES

A.

South Vietnam

Plans are now afoot to shuffle

South Vietnam's Corps commanders so that General

Khanh, considered by General Harkins to be the best

of the lot, will take over in the crucial delta (IV

Corps) area.

General Dinh, the ambitious Minister

of Security, is still resisting pressure to relin-

quish command of the III Corps area, and is not in-

volved in the current shuffle.

B. Cuba-USSR

There are about 8,000 Soviets in Cuba,

5,000 of these military, according to a bloc offi-

cial in close touch with Soviets in Havana. The

figures are close to our own estimate of 4,000 to

7,000. Some withdrawals continue.

C.

Cambodia-Vietnam Sihanouk seems. to feel that cut-

ting off his nose to spite his face was not enough.

Now he says he will formally recognize North Vietnam

if the US

does not silence the Khmer Serei radio.

South Vietnam will cut Cambodia's primary access

to

international markets via the Mekong river if he

does. (INTERCEPT)

D. Indonesia-Cambodia

sukarno apparently plans to go

to Cambodia on an official visit following his trip

to Manila. The Cambodian ambassador in Djakarta has

advised Phnom Penh that Sukarno plans to leave for

Manila on 6 December and directly from there for

Phnom Penh on the 10th. He will stay three days.

Coal and Steel Community

Coal and Steel community

members at their next meeting on

Monday will prob-

average of nine percent.

iffs of each member into line with Italy's, the

highest in the community. Only the Dutch oppose the

idea.

F. British Guiana - Cuba GIMPEX, trading arm and

source of funds for Jagan's party, has worked out a

deal to supply the country's major electric utility

next year with fuel oil from Cuba. Texaco and Esso

have

been the traditional suppliers.

G. Brazil-US. A

press report from Rio cites "well in-

Formed sources" to the affect that Goulart plans

soon to invite Mrs. Kennedy to visit Brazil so that

Brazil can pay her the honors which it had planned

to render the late President.

H. Cuba-Moroçco

A three-man Cuban delegation is on

Its way to Morocco to try to patch up relations

broken by Morocco because of Cuba's assistance to

the Algerians in their border war. (INTERCEPTS)
