Investigation requested by Condr, Eglin AFB, FL on 7 Jul 69, to determine circum-

stances surrounding importation of 3 boxes of captured enemy weapons by SUBJECT.

queried by ARPA, a DOD agency, about a box of weapons being sent through ARPA

channels.

Investigation disclosed SUBJECT sent 12 weapons to Eglin AFB from SEA

while TDY in RVN in Nov 68.

Eleven of these weapons were subsequently shipped from

Eglin ArB to Sionics, Atlanta, at SUBJECT's request and at government expense.

The

twelfth weapon recovered at Eglin AFB. Deputy Condr, AFAIL, advised SUBJECT had no

known authority to send weapons from SEA nor to ship weapons to Sionics; Sionics

does not have AF contract.

Records reflect SUBJECT, since Nov 68, has placed 7

long distance telephone calls to Sionics, at government expense.

In verbal state-

ment, SUBJECT advised he shipped one box containing 12 captured enemy weapons from

SEA in approximately Nov 08 as part of his assigned duties to assist Vice-President

of Sionics; that 1l of the weapons were subsequently forwarded to Sionics in Mar

69, because he considered Sionics an AF contractor. He advised that official

telephone calls were placed for same reason. SUBJECT stated he acted as an agent

for the USAF in all instances.

He declined to execute a written statement at this

time. SUBJECI's former supervisor in SEA advised that he did not authorize or di-

rect the shipment of any captured enemy weapons to Sionics.

Matter coordinated

with U. S. Treasury agents who opined that SUBJECT was in violation of Public Law

90-618.

DETAILS

This investigation was requested by the Commander, Eglin

AFB, Florida or 7 July 1969, based on a request from the

Commander, Air Force Armament Laboratory (AFATL), Eglin AFB

to determine the circumstances surrounding the importation of

three boxes of captured enemy weapons by PAUL ARNOLD MARRIOTT

(SUBJECT) , Lt Col, 513-10-4236FR, AFATL, during the approxi

mate period of November 1968 - July 1969.

2.

On 7 July 1969,

at Eglin AB, Florida, a letter dated 3

July 1969, from the Commander, AFATL, was reviewed and the body

of the letter is set forth as follows:

"1. It is requested that an investigation be conducted to de-

termine if the laws/regulations regarding the importation of

firearms have been complied with in the following instance.

"a.

Approximately the first week in June Mr Beard of ARPA

called colonel Berkow of ADTC and inquired about a box of enemy

weapons that had been shipped through the transportation

capa-

bilities of ARPA to Eglin AFB, Attention of It Colonel P. A.

Marriott. Colonel Berkow called the Armament Laboratory (AFATL)

since Lt Colonel Marriott is assigned to AFATL.

"b."

A search was made to locate the shipment. Two boxes

were found each containing North Vietnamese weapons.

Both

boxes were addressed as follows: FB2823 USAF (DOL-AFSC) Attn

L/C P. A. Marriott.

"C:

Subsequently, it was discovered that a shipment of

North Vietnamese weapons and ammunition had been received at

Eglin in early March and had been reshipped to Sionics

Corporation, 1655 Peachtree Street, N.E., Atlanta, Georgia. The

attached documents pertain to this shipment.

"2.

Colonel J. H. Hobaugh, telephone 882-2763, will be available

to discuss in more detail the above information."

The above letter is being retained in the files of OSI District

7 and will be available to proper authority upon request.

3.

On 9 July 1969, J. T. KING, Lt Col, 472-12-2614FR, Staff

Judge Advocate, 320lst Air Base Group, Eglin AB, Florida, was

apprised of the information contained in the above letter, by

SA WILLIAM D. DIXON.

KING advised that in his opinion, there

existed probable cause to warrant the issuance by the Base Com-

mander of an authorization for search and seizure of any captured

enemy weapons contained in the storage facilities of the 3207th

Armament and Munitions Test Support Squadron (AMTS) , Eglin AB.

KING also opined that there was probably a violation of Public

Law 90-618 (Gun Control Act of 1968), possibly a violation of

customs regulations, and possibly a fraud in that government

transportation facilities had been misused.

4 :

On 9 July 1969, DONALD V. THOMPSON, Colonel, 472-12-2614FR,

Deputy Commander, 3201st Air Base Group, Eglin AFB, Florida, was

briefed concerning this matter, by SA DIXON.

Colonel THOMPSON

subsequently executed an Authority to Search and Seize, thereby

authorizing the seizure of any captured enemy weapons contained

in the storage facilities of the 3207th AMTS.

5 •

On 9 July 1969,

a search of the storage facilities of the

3207th AMTS. Building 1270, Eglin AFB, Florida, was conducted by

SA DIXON, in presence of JOSIAH C. MUSICK, CMSgt, FR361-07-1904,

and CLARENCE M. GREEN, SMSgt, FR250-44-2188, NCOIC and Assistant

NCOIC, respectively.

The search revealed the presence of two

packing crates marked for SUBJECT containing a total of 21 various

automatic weapons, five noise suppressors, two range finders. 32

ammunition magazines and a brass plaque mounted on a piece of wood.

The crates and contents

were seized-and taken as evidence against

proper receipt and are being held by the evidence custodian of OSI

Detachment 710, Egin AFB, Florida, and are available to proper

authority upon request.

6.

On 11 July 1969, this investigation was coordinated with

WILLIAM C. GOODMAN, SSAN: 579-20-9774, and ROBERT E. SANDERS,

SSAN: 150-26-6417, Special Investigators, Alcohol, Tobacco and

Firearms Control Division, Internal Revenue Service (Treasury

Department), Pensacola, Florida, at Eglin AFB, Florida. GOODMAN

advised that based on the available information, it appears that

SUBJECT is in violation of Public Law 90-618; however, he would

query his headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia and Washington, D. C.

in an attempt to ascertain if SUBJECT had applied for permission

to import the weapons or had submitted application to register

the weapons GOODMAN added that his inquiry would be accomplished

by the most expeditious means available.: GOODMAN and SANDERS re-

quested

that they be present during the photographing and identi-

fication of the weapons and during all interviews of witnesses and

SUBJECT during this investigation.

on 14 July 1969, JOHN H. HOBAUGH, Colonel, 165-05-2634FR,

Deputy Commander, AFATL, Eglin AFB, Florida, was interviewed

at

his duty station

by GOODMAN and the writer. Colonel HOBAUGH

advised substantially as follows:

The first part of June 1969,

he received a telephone call from Colonel BERKOW of the

Armament Development and Test Center (ADTC), Eglin AFB

Colonel

BERKOW stated that he had received a call from a Mr. BEARD (NFI)

of the Advance Research Project Agency. (ARPA), a DOD. agency: who

inquired about a box of enemy weapons that had been shipped

through the transportation capabilities of ARPA to Eglin AFB, to

the attention of Lt Col P. A. MARRIOTT. At this time Colonel

HOBAUGH attempted to contact SUBJECT, but was unable to do so as

SUBJECT was on leave; however, he left a message for SUBJECT to

call him the next day.

The next day SUBJECT called Colonel

HOBAUGH and was instructed to telephonically contact Mr. BEARD

and explain to BEARD the circumstances surrounding the shipping

of the enemy weapons..

the dire

At this time Colonel HOBAUGH went on

leave, returning about I July 1969. Upon his return to duty,

Colonel HOBAUGH was asked by Colonel MARTIN, Commander, AFATL, to

look into the circumstances surrounding the shipment of enemy

weapons and ammunition to Sionics from Eglin AFB, Florida and at

the same time showing Colonel HOBAUGH a shipping document, dated

13 March 1969, requesting

the shipment of two boxes of miscel-

laneous equipment to Sionics, 1655 Peachtree Street, NE, Atlanta,

Georgia 30309, Attn: Mr. FRED BROWN, signed by SUBJECT.

Colonel

HOBAUGH fürther stated that the boxes of so called miscellaneous

equipment were found to contain weapons and ammunition and were

therefore repacked and shipped by the organizational logistics

Colonel HOBAUGH advised that SUBJECT made several conflicting

statements concerning his knowledge of how the enemy weapons

got into the U.S. from the Republic of Vietnam (RVN). SUBJECT

stated that he thought the weapons were registered by sionics;

SUBJECT stated

that he thought the weapons were for the

museum at Eglin AFB; and SUBJECT denied any knowledge of how

any of the boxes of enemy weapons were sent to Eglin AFB.

SUBJECT stated to Colonel HOBAUGH that while assigned to 7th

Air Force in RVN, he acted as escort officer for MITCHELL

WER BELL III, Vice-President of Sionics, and during such duties

Colonel HOBAUGH also

recalled that SUBJECT had stated that WER BELL was in RVN under

Air Force sponsorship and was a close friend of the Thai Chief

of Staff. Colonel HOBAUGH recalled that Colonel BILL FAGAN was

SUBJECT's supervisor in RVN. Colonel HOBAUGH stated that to the

best of his knowledge the Air Force museum at Eglin AFB has only

a few old Viet Cong weapons as the museum was appointed to dis-

play weapons of U.S. origin and the Air Force Laboratory has no:

test program for enemy weapons.

enemy weapons at Eglin AFB. Colonel HOBAUGH stated that it is

not likely that SUBJECT had any authority to ship any enemy

weapons from RVN, and SUBJECT unequivocally had no authority to

ship any weapons to Sionics as the Air Force Laboratory at Eglin

AFB presently has no

contract with Sionics, nor has it ever had

a contract with Sionics for any purpose.

On 17 July 1969, SUBJECT was interviewed by GOODMAN, supra,

and the

writer at OSI Detachment 710, Eglin AFB, Florida.

Prior

to the interview SUBJECT was advised of the nature of the in-

vestigation; of his rights under the provisions of Article 31..

UCMJ; of his right to remain silent; his right to have a lawyer

present during the interview; and that he could obtain a civilian

lawyer of his own choosing, at his own

charge. SUBJECT advised that he wished to waive his rights and

made the following verbal statement:

In approximately November 1968, while assigned to 7th Air Force

Headquarters, RVN, as a munitions expert, he

was ordered by his

OIC, Colonel FAGAN, to assist and süpport WER BELL, the Vice-

President of Sionics, to the fullest extent possible... Therefore,

when WER BELL asked SUBJECT to send

a box of 12 captured weapons

to the U.S., SUBJECT complied by sending the weapons through

official channels to Eglin AB, Florida, as he (SUBJECT) con-

sidered Sionics, and therefore WER BELL, an official Air Force

contractor.

On approximately 13 March 1969, at SUBJECT's request,

11 of the 12 weapons sent to Eglin AFB by him were further sent

to Sionics, after FRED BROWN, President of Sionics, assured

SUBJECT that the weapons had been licensed and registered with the

proper authorities.

The shipment was sent to Sionics through

öfficial government transportation channels,

at government expense.

SUBJECT also admitted placing approximately 7 long distance tele-

phone calls since November 1968 from his office at Eglin AFB,

Florida to Sionics or FRED BROWN in Atlanta, Georgia, at govern-.

ment expense as he (SUBJECT) stated that Sionics is an Air Force

contractor:

SUBJECT further stated that he had the twelfth

weapon that was sent to Eglin AFB from SEA in approximately

November 1968 stored in the lock-up. room at Range 22, Eglin

AF B...

SUBJECT also advised that during

the approximate period of

February to June 1969, two additional boxes of captured enemy

weapons were sent to Eglin AFB, Florida (Attn: Lt Col P. A. MARRIOTT)

from Bangkok, Thailand, by (to the best of SUBJECT's knowledge)

WER BELL.

SUBJECT

then asked the appropriate personnel at Eglin

AFB to store the weapons for safekeeping and SUBJECT stated that if

the weapons were

not sent to Sionics, he assumed the weapons would

be sent to the Air Force museum at Eglin AFB.

SUBJECT further

stated that as the officer responsible for the Air Force museum,.

On 21 July 1969, WILLIAM M. FAGAN, Colonel, 533-14-6288FV,

SUBJECT's former commander in RVN, was

interviewed at his summer

home in Destin, Florida.

Colonel FAGAN executed a sworn statement,

pertinent portions of which are set forth as follows:

"On or about 5 Sept 68 I was advised that a Mr. Mitchell wer Bell

of Sionics was arriving at Saigon Airport and would bring some

munitions equipment (guns and suppressors) for demonstration *****

"I assigned It Col Marriott the task of handling all facets of Mr.

Wer Bell's visit which he did by meeting Mr Wer Bell at the

Commercial Terminal and assisted him to get settled in a hotel. Mr

Wer Bell was in RVN as a private citizen and we were aware that he

had no security clearance.

*******

"I departed on a Trip to

CONUS at the end of Nov 68 and returned to Saigon 13 Dec 68.

Mr

Wer Bell was still in SEA, but I did not know where. I was aware

a shipment of guns had gone to Eglin during my absence but had

already arranged through the Commander of FTD W-PAFB that we should

have shipped such

items to FTD and they would forward them to the

designated base.

Idid nothing to counter this Nov 68 shipment as

it was going to the A.F. Armament Lab for a "museum"

.*******

"In early. Feb 69 I found Mr Wer Bell and we concluded that he would

leave RVN. about 17 Feb 69 and he would give me his MACV form 6 and

I would ship back only what he brought over.

I was very specific

about no enemy weapons being involved and if he had such for the Air

Force, that I would ship them to FTD as instructed. After my return

from my second CONUS trip on 23 Apr 69 I found that wer Bell did not

depart RVN. I asked around for him and heard many stories of his

activities and felt I should take direct action.

About 7 May I heard Mr Wer Bell was in Bangkok

at the President Hotel. I went there with a Capt Gaylord

and got back the MACV form 6.

On 14 May I turned it over to

the OSt.

I felt that I had closed out our sponsorship, but..

also felt his (Wer Bell's) activities in SEA warranted investi-

This is why I went to the OSI.' I did not authorize

or direct the shipment of any captured enemy weapons to Mr

Wer Bell and/or Sionics."
