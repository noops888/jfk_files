INARDDUCHICK

Ints review presents the facts and observationg which bear

on the bona fides of the soviet defector Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO.

The highlighta of NOSEiXO's biography, as he has given it to

CIA, are as follows:

He was born 30 october 1927, tre first

son

of Ivar Isidorovich NOSENKO, snipyard worker who in 1939 as to

becone Soviet Minister of Shipbuilding.

After graduating in

1951

from the Institute of International Relations in Moscow, where

he specialized in international law and the English langage,

NOSENKO entered the Chief Intelligence Directorate (GRU) of the

Soviet Navy,

serving first as a translator assigned to the intel-

ligence staff of the Seventr. (Far Eastern) Fleet

and then as a

senior translator and political officer at an

intelligence unit

of the Fourth (Baltic) Fleet.

In mid-March 1953,. imrediately

following STALIN's death, NOSENKO left the Naval GRU to become a

junior case officer in the KiB.

He was assigned to the U.S.

Embassy Section of the American. Department, KGB Seconä Chief

Directorate, iron 1953 to mid-1955.

During this perica he was

initially responsible for operational activity surrounding Am-

erican journalists in Moscow and later for operations against

U.S. Army Attaches at the Embassy.

when transferred to the newly

organized Tourist Departmert of

the second Chief Directorate in

1955, NOSENKO had as his targets vi-itors to the Soviet Union

from the United States and the countries of the British Common-

wealth.

Having handled a nimber of successful tourist opera-

tions, NOSENKO in 1958 was promoted to Deputy Chief of the

section responsible for operations açainst American, Eritish,

and Candian nationals.

Eighteen months later

Ni-SENKO returned

to the U.S. Embassy Section as its Deputy Chiei.

Between January

1960 and January 1962 he was second-in-charge of all KGB activ-

ities against the U,S. Embassy in Moscow and personally super-

vised operations against tre Embassy Security Officer, the

Second Chief Directorate's most important counterintelligence

target at the time, and against American code clerks, collec-

tively the Directorate's most important recruitment targets.

At the cod of December 1951 NOSENKO again was transferred to

the Tourist Department, this time as Chief of the American-

British-Canadian Section,

Six months later he was made Deputy

Chief of the Tourist Department, and in mid-1963 he became its

First Deputy Chief,

FrOM

the time he first contacted CIA in Geneva, in 1962,

NOSENKO's status has been under examination.

only now, three

years following his defection

in recruary 1964, is a definitive

study of the bona fides question possible:

the voluminous and

diverse reports by NOSENKO, coupled with collateral information,

required that much time for assimilation, correlation, investiga-

tion, and evaluation.

NOSaNKO '5 own testimony, interspersed with

representative subsidiary cases stemming from or related to his

reports,

constitutes a large part of

the evidence.

This review

also draws upon statements and actions by other

Soviets, colla-

tions with materials from other sources,

and opinions by special-

ists of various kinds.

These factual elements are presented

without comment or interpretation,

except in the penultimate

section of the review where the evidence on the bona fides of

NOSENKO is evaluated

and analyzed.

II. SUMMARY OF CPERATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS

A. Introduction

Prcu tho CIA side, the NOSENKO case can be divided into

thras perioda:

che first Geneva phase of June 1962, the second

Gereva phase of January-February 1354, and the post-defection

handling of NOSENKO from Feiruary 1964 to date.

The rest of

Part II i8 separated irto these three periods accordingly.

B. First Geneva Phase (Jure 1962)

The NOSENKO case opened on 5 June 1962 in the corridors of

the Palais des Nations in Geneva during the United Nations Dis-

armament Conference.

A thier-unidentified soviet, known to him

by sight from conference reetings, approached Ü.S. Foreign Ser-

vice Officer David MARk with the suggestion that they get to

gether for a talk the folloring day.

In the late afternoon of

6 June,

the same Soviet

motioned "'ARK aside and said that he

would like to taik to

him privately as soon

as possible.

told MARK that he was "not going to pumo him for information,

but simply wanted to teli his sone things."

A luncheon neeting

was arranged for 9 June,

although the Soviet clearly preferred

an earlier date.

MARK

advised CIA of the appointment, explain-

ing that he thought the ipproach so unusual that it might be

an offer of cooperation or cefection.

He said he believed the

soviet to be yuriy Ivanovier: NOSENKO, a member of the soviet

delegation to the arns talks.

At the 9 June luncheon with MARK, NOSENKO told MARK that

he, NOSENKO, was a KGB counterintelligence officer

sent to

Geneva to ensure the security of the Soviet delegation.

He knew

that MARK had previously served in Moscow and believed he war

connected with American Irteiligence.* He needed approximately

900 Swiss francs innediately to cover KGB operational funds which

he squandered on liquor

and a prostitute ir. Gereva, and he offered

for this amount to sell

tio pieces of information to American

Intelligence.

The first of these has the identity of a former

U.S. Embassy employee in Moscow who was a KGB agent and, as of

1962, was

"near ciphers" in the hashington area; the second was

the identity of a soviet in Moscow who,

although ostensibly a

CIA agent, was actually planted on American Intelligence.

Al-

though NOSENKO at first told Mark that he would stop at

the sale

of these two items, he later stated:

"I know you won't let me

alone now." At another point NOSENKO said:

"I will not work in

Moscow, but I come out about once a year." NOSENKO also gave

MARK

brief chronological account of his personal and profes-

sional past.

MARK explained that although he was not an intel-

ligence officer,

he could place NOSENKO in contact with the

Intelligence Chief in Geneva later that same day.

MARK Introduced NOSE:KO to a CIA officer at 2000 hours that

evening, and a

followed at a CIA safehouse in

Geneva.

Describing himseif as a KGb Major experienced in opera-

tions against the American Embassy in Moscow and against tourists

and other travellers to the Soviet Union, NOSENKO told the CIA

Another Soviet source,

has also reported that the

KGB suspected MARK to be an

Axerican Intelligence officer;

although he has never served in CIA, MARK did engage in a num-

ber of operational support activities on behalf of CIA while

stationed at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.

He said that the need for monay

suing discussion he said also that he was dissatisfied with the

theless, that he had no intention of beconing an imerican agent.--

this was to be a one-time transaction, and after that he would

have no further contact with CIA,

and NOSENKO was driven across the border to Germany that sane

sight.

Debriefings resured in a Frankfurt safehouse.

The des

cision has reached on ll february to bring. rOSENKO to the

United States, and in the early even..g of 12 February he and

his CIA escorts arrived in Washington via commercial aircrait,

thence to a safehouse in the Washington area.

At

the request of the Swiss and Soviet Governments, NOSENKO

met on 14 February with representatives of their respective

Washington Embassies in the offices of the U.S. Immigration and

Naturalization Service.

He told both that he had defected of

his own free will after careful consideration and that he had no

desire to return to the soviet Union.

In answer to the questions

of the soviet representatives, he orally renounced his status and

rights as a citizen of the USSR.

CIA completed its initial debriefings of NOSENKO on 18 Febru-

ary.

and on 24 February he was introduced to representatives of

the

FBI for questioning. At about the same time, there was a

marked decline in NOSENKO's discipline:

He became evasive and

uncooperative, refusing to answer some of the questions of his

debriefers, both CIA and FBI; his nightlife in Washington and

nearby cities was punctuated by drinking bouts, crude behavior,

and disputes with his security escort.

He explained these

actions by saying that he was under great tensich

as a

result of

his defection, abandonment of his wife and children, and the

disgrace that he had brought to his family name. It was against

this background that CIA acceded to NOSENKO's demand for a vaca-

tion.

On 12 Haron, therefore, NOSENKO left Washington with a

CIA case officer and two CIA security guards for a two-week

vacation in Hawsii. There his behavior deterioriated still fur-

ther: He drank heavily and almost

constantly; he engaged in

sexual acts with a number of prostitutes; he was loud and crude

in public places; and he spent money extravagently ($800 on

one prostitute) and conspicuously (a $100 bill for a restaurant

tip).

During NOSENKO's absence, consultations were held with

the FBI concerning

steps to be taken to restrict his movements

and activities.

agencies feared that his behavior would

bring about unwanted attention and publicity, perhaps police

arrest, and that doubts about his bona fides, which were be-

coming known to a widening group of people in the l.s. Govern-

ment, might be inadvertently revealed to NOSENKO himself.

FBI on I April said it would "not interpose objection" to the

CIA plan to limit NOSENKO's freedom of movement.

The Acting

Attorney General, the Department of State, and the White House

were also notified of the CIA pian at this time.

In the morning of 4 April NOSENKO was driven to another.

graph examination.

At the safehouse NOSENKO was given a rou-

Detailed interrogation of NOSENKO was begun on 4 April 1964

in order to obtain information which he had been reluctant to

give in debriefings, and to clarify contradictions in that he

had already reported.

This phase of the interrogations was termi-

nated on 21 April 1964.

questioned for a total of about 140 hours by individual interro-

and by interrogation teams consisting of two o= three

men, and he was directly challenged on many of his previous re-

He admitted that certain of his earlier statements had

been incorrect, and that he could not explain contradictions in

his testimony.

Nevertheless, NOSENKO maintained he had been

bagically truthful, and that he had come to the United States

solely for the reasons he had originally given. This interro-

gation was broken off on 5 March 1965.

Questioning of NOSENKO during the summer and

autumn of 1964

and the interrogations of January and February 1965 concentrated

on the period of his claimed service in the U.S. Embassy Section

of the American Department,

KGB Second Chief Directorate,

January 1960 to January 1962.

Among the reasons for selecting

this particular period were the comparatively large amount of

collateral information available against which NOSENKO's state-

ments could be checked; the importance of the U.S. Embassy and

its personnel as the outstanding KGB Second Chief Directorate

targets; their importance from the standpoint of American

security; and the extent of NOSENKO's knowledge about the acti-

vities of the U.S. Embassy Section, in his capacity as its

Deputy Chief.

In keeping with Soviet practice, CIA asked NOSENKO in

February 1965 to sign a series of interrogation Ieporis, so-

called "protocols;" most of which

concern the period of his

claimed service in the

American Department.

These were written

by the CIA interrogators, and they were designed to incorporate

tests.

---

## Page 31

NOSENKO's exact statements and meaning on various specific sub-

jects.

The protocols were in no way presented to HOSENKO as

documentary portions of a "confesaion," but father as distilled

and final statements of what he did and did not knes concerning

particular topics. NOSENKO was asked to read each page of each

protocol carefully and to sign his name at the botton to indi-

cate that he understood and agiend with its cortents; he was

allowed the use of a dictionary and was permitted to ask any

questions and make any changes that he wished.

(Amendents were

entered by the interrogators and were initialed by NOSENKO.)

NOSENKO was asked, after reading. each

page and after completing

the entire protocol, whether he understood what was written there

and whether there were any more changes he wished to make.

He

was then

asked to sign and date the statement, "I have read and

understood this report and certify it as correct." at the end of

the final page.

With one exception, which will be noted later,

he did so calmly and without objections, although on one or two

of them he remarked that his statements were presented

in such

a manner as to make them look foolish; although invited to do

so, he was not able to suggest any changes of fact or presenta-

tion which would make them more accurate.

Conmenting on the

use of interrogation reports, NOSENKO said on 4 Narch 1965:

"My life story is absolutely

correct. Anytring I have signed

is absolutely correct. I absolutely understand what I am doing

when I am signing any paper.

This is an official document, and

I fuliy understand what I'm doing when 1 sign it as being

abso-

lutely correct."

In May 1965 a CIA psychologist questioned NOSENKO in detail

on his life from birth until 1953, when he said he entered the

KGB, in an attempt to gain additional insights irto his charac-

ter and personality.

Further questioning was conducted from 26 July until l4 August

1965 with the participation of Peter DERYABIN, a former KGB offi-

cer.

These interrogations, the first to be held in Russian,

were for the purpose of using DERYABIN's first-hand experience

in the KGB to obtain a clearer understanding of NOSENKO's per-

sonal and professional background.

There were no further debriefings or interrogations until

18 October 1966.

On this date NOSENKO was polygraphed on the

case of Lee Harvey OSWALD.

During the period 19-25 October 1966, NOSENKO was questioned ior

seven days on specific aspects of selected topics ranging from his

identity to his involvement in and knowledge of specific KGB opera-

Questioning was in both Russian and English.

OPERATIONAL CIRCUNSTANCES

Earlier Information on NOSENKO in Coneva

HOSENKO's saue 1irst camo to tho attention of ClA In October

1960 when he applied at tho American Embassy in Moscox for a visa

to enter the United

States as a selabor uf an automotiva delega-

tion.

Tbe following month CIA obtained coples of his passport

photograph at ino separate points on hia TDY route lo Cuba.

There

wAS

no indication of intelligence affiliation, and when

NOSENKO arrived under true nano with the soviet delegation in

Genova in karch 1962, he was accorded no more then the

interest

routinely given by Western intelligence services to Sovicts

travelling abroad.* After arriving in Switzerlard, however, but

before establishing contact with CIA, NOSEKO was

involved 1n

at least two incidents which brought him to the special notice

of the British, balss, americon, and possibly the rest German

services.

The

first of these occurred in April 19f2. At a cocktail

party in Geneva, NOSE"kO met a female scoretary employed by the

British Foreign Office. He saw hor several days later in

the

corridors of the Pilais des Nations and asked her to have dinner

with hia, and a date was made for several evenings later. Ac-

cording to the secretary's later account as reported by her

superiors:

"They talked about Marxism, the Chinese, Yugoslavia,

and love; NOSENKO was obviously smitten with her,

became verbally

amorous,

and told her that he would like to take her off to a.

desert islard."

The girl

felt that NOSENKO probably was not

interested in

her for intelligence purposes, but seemed to be

genuinely attracted by her.

From her conversations with JOSENKO

she was able to report that "he had been in submarines during

the war and, according to himself, had risen to the rank of

Commander.

He was a nenber of the Communist Party.

His father

lle himself had served in the

Ministry of Foreign Alfairs in

1948 and 1949 and had apparently

visited England but had not been stationed

there."

NOSENKO

also told her that he was acquainted with stator of the

echapublishing house in London.**

When NOSENKO became too

persistent in his atteutions, the socretary reported the contact

to her superiors,

was withdrawn

immedlatoly from Switzerland,

and later resigned fron the Foreign Offies.

This same incident also brought NOSENKO to the attention

of the Swiss service,

which later reported it to CIA, without

details, as an attempt on NUSESKU's part to iccrul: the girl.

cerning recruitment approaches to incricans in

to recruit the

and that he attempted to outain

At his seoond reeting witli CIA on 11 Jure 1962, HOSENKO

described the

same incident, in the context of reporting a pos-

sible KGB penetration of British counterintelligence:

POr NOSENKO's Presence in Geneva (1962 and 1964)

1.

TDY in 1962

When NOSENKD arrived in Geneva for the first time on

10 March 1962, he was listed officially as a Soviet Linistry of

Foreign Affaty's "expout" with the Delegation to the disarmament

talks.

Early durink lits second meeting with CIA on 11 June 1962,

NOSENKO was asked to oxplain precisely why he had been sent out

to Geneva.

de repllud as follows:

"Right now, I cane to pro-

vide counterintellis nce support to the Disarmament Delegation....

There is a special (iGB) department for delegations, a special

one, recently creatoo.

And - the chief

of this departrent is

Understand?

The chief of the

directorate [O.M. GIANOVi hated to sign all sorts of recun-

mendations and

so on, when someone can run off in Belgium or

Wherever he may br.

This happened more than once, and he was

summoned before the ICPSU! Central Committee.

Therefore, he

decided to create a

new position.

The person holding it is

simultaneously chief of the department and deputy chief of the

directorate and personally signs off on all matters concerning

exits | from the USSHl.

This was in order to avoid being called

on the carpet...so that blame would fall not on the chief of

the directorate, but on his deputy, no is in charge of this

department and who signed off...

"This department," NOSENKO continued, "is concerned with

departures abroad, that is, it checks all Soviet citizens who

intend to travel abrond, both alone and as members of delegations.

Since GOLITSYN (deforted] in Finland, we have

an order that no

delegation is to bo lut out without an operational worker, not

a single delegation...

With me it happened as follows:

not planning to 5o.

They told me:

'You are going.'

I said:

'I can't.

I have a noction.

I have 15 people there, all

operating people.

Am I supposed to dump them?

What can I do?'

'No, you are going,'

was the reply.

'And what did the chief

order?' I asked.

The chief [NOSENKO was referring to GRIBANOV

when he spoke of the "chief"'! said:

'GROMYKO is going this

time, the Minister of Foreign Affairs is going, and somebody

on an appropriate lovul must go with him.

Not a case officer.

not a senior case officer, not a deputy, but the chief of a

section, or the deputy chief of a department, or a department

chief.'

Well, I was the nost junior section

chief.

I was

called in to my chiol, my immediate chief, who is concerned

with the Seventh Department.

They had told hin that it would

be for a month

and

on this basis he gave me permission. And

I have been here sinco 10 March."

Later during thie second meeting NOSENKO volunteered that

in addition to his

sccurity officer functions in Geneva, he had

a special

assignment

to check on P.F. SHAKHOV, a senior advisor

to the Soviet Delegation. * SHAKHOV had been noted in contact

*CIA records show that SHAKHOV has served in and visited the

United States on numorous occasions since 1942,

with David MARK, belleved by the KGB to be a CIA officer,

NOSENKO reported, and on this basis the KGB suspected that

SHAKHOV might be an American age.t.

NOSENKO described the

various ways he had tested these suspicions in Geneva. He

first gave SHAKHOV disinformation and looked for indications

that he passed it on to American contacts.

Next, SHAKHOV was

told to perform countersurveillance

tasks

during & neeting by

NOSENKO with an imaginary agent, while other KGB officers

checked for signs that SHAKHOV had forewarned the Anericans

about the neeting.

Finally,

NOSENKO revealed to SHAKHOV the

location of a KGB

"dead drop" and checked back five days later

to see whether the specially prepared materials which had been

placed in it had been disturbed in any way.

ROSENKO'S con~

clusion fron all this, he told CIA, was that SHAKHOV was ab-

solutely free of suspicion, and it

was his intontion to report

this finding when he returned to KGB Headquarters.

On later occasions NOSENKO reported that SHAKHOV had

previously served with the Ministry. of Foreign Affairs in the

United States and that duriny this perlod he acted as an agent-

recruiter for the KGB.

In 1966 NOSENKO named one person whom

SHAKHOV had spotted and developed in the United States, for

SHAKHOV, according to NOSENKO,

was not and

never

haa

been a KGB officer.

Asked why SHAKHOV was permitted to

travel abroad when he was suspected of being an Auerican agent,

NOSENKO explained that since SHAKHOV belonged to the Ministry

Of Foreign Affairs, the KGB could do nothing about his trips

abroad.

"There was no proof, only suspicions,"

and furtherrore,

SHAKHOV was a member of the personal staff of the head of the

Soviet Delegation, S.K. TSARAPKIN.

NOSENKO was questioned again about his 1962 assignment to

Geneva during

the February 1965

interrogations.

His answers

were incorporated in a "protocol" which NOSENKO certified as

being correct on 26 February 1965.

The protocol states:

"GRIBANOV had nothing at all to do with my assignment to Geneva

in 1962.

I think that the fitness report written about me for

this trip was signed by[f.D.) BOBKOV, since he was the Deputy

Chief of

the Second Chief Directorate who supervised the

Seventh (Tourist) Department.

I did not personally discuss

this trip with GRIBANOV before my departure from Moscow.

Siy

candidacy for this assignment was supported by (S.G.] BANNIKOV,

the Deputy Chief of the Second Chief Directorate, who super-

vised the work of the Eleventh (Soviet Delegations, Department

1n New York as a merber of the Soviet Mission to the UN in 1963.

this trip because SHAKHOV, who was suspected of possibly being

a lestern agent, was to be in the delegation.

When the Eleventh

Department was looking for a case officer to rake this trip

they wanted to have a chief of section because of the serious-

ness of the SHAKHOV case.

When they asked in the Seventh

Department (V.D.) CHELNOKOV agreed that I should take the as-

signment.

There was no background or neightorhood investigation

conducted on me in connection with my being approved for this

My assignment was approved by the Eleventh Department,

by the Personnel Office of the

Second Chief Directorate, by

the Central Personnel

office of the KGB and by the Certral

Committee of the CPSU."

NOSENKO was asked why he had been selected to make this

trip immediately after

assuming the duties of the Chief of the

American Tourist Section, on the eve of the tourist season,

and at a time when he had no deputy.

He explained that it

was not thought that the assignment

would last so long, and

CHEL:OKOV, his superior and friend, had decided to le= him go

as a "treat."

During interrogations of October 1966 NOSENKO was ques-

tioned further about his 1962 assignment to Seneva as a security

officer.

He said that in this capacity he would

necessarily

know the identity of all other KGb officers serving with the

Soviet Disarmament Delegation in Geneva.

There were only,

besides himself, the KGB First Chief Directorate Officers M.S.

TSYMBAL and I.S. MAYOROV.

(CIA, however, has tentatively

identified three other delegation members

as KGB staff officers:

A.K. KISLOV, observed in Washington aid in Moscow in what

appears to have been KGB operational

activity; V.G. FILATOV, who

served as an alternate handler in the KGB operation with the

NATO officer Georges PAQUES; and Oleg GRINEVSKIY,

member

of the permanent Soviet Delegation who handled a

double agent during this same conference.)

NOSENKO included

GRINEVSKIY in the list of his own agents

in Geneva in 1962

and said that,

in Moscow, GRINEVSKIY was handled by an offi-

cer of the Intelligentsia

and Correspondents Department of

the Second Chief Directorate.

KISLOV, according to NOSENKO,

was an operational contact in Moscow of the Austria-Germany-

• Scandanavia Department of the KGB Second Chief Directorate

and was used in operations against the West German Embassy

there.

NOSENKO also said that KISLOV had been a KGB operational

contact during his earlier tour in the United States but was

neither then nor later a KGB officer.

He characterized FILA-

TOV as a Ministry of Foreign Affairs.official and stated that

he is "definitely not an intelligence officer."

NOSENKO was also requestioned during these interrogations

on his investigation of SHAKHOV.

After saying on the morning

of 19 October 1966 that he had been personally told by the

Deputy Chief"of the Second Chief Directorate that the SHAKHOT

"My main task was to

separate these tasks. "

In this questioning NOSENKO described the basis for the

suspicions of SHAKHOV, the lack of results from

earlier inves-

tigations, and his own preparation for this assignment.

said that as a representative of the Soviet Delegations De-

partment of the Second Chief Directorate, M.G.

SITNIKOV had

conducted investigations of SHAKHOV in Geneva in 1961, but

SITNIKOV was unable to resolve the questions concerning him.

Because of the

failure of these early efforts, the KGB decided

to send "a senior guy" to the Disarmament talks in 1962, and

NOSENKO was chosen "to finish things up." Betore leaving Mos-

cow in larch 1962, NOSENKO therefore discussed the SHAKHOV

case with. SITNIKOV and with one (fnu) LYALIN, the Soviet Dele-

gations Department officer in charge of the

SHAKHOV case; he

elso read various materials on the case,

including an investi-

gative plan drawn up by LYALIN.

NOSENKO's description of these

preparations provided the basis for the questioning which

followed:

Question: Why was SHAKHOV under suspicion in June 1962?

NOSENKO:

He was working with different delegations at

different conferences and, being in Geneva,

it was noticed that there

was something which

can he described as a connection with David

MARK, who was considered a ClA officer.* Also,

little, little, little things before.

Question:

When did SHAKHOV and MARK first meet? How did

NOSENKO:

it begin?

In '60 or '61 there was a contact with MARK.

I don't remember who reported it.

The report

was maybe from SITNIKOV in Geneva. MARK was

known to the Second Chief Directorate as the

Rezident [CIA Chief of Station] in Moscow.

Arter Moscow he went to Geneva, and it was con-

sidered he must be the Rezident in Geneva.

All the KGB officers going there were told to

pay attention to him:

Question:

What about the report?

NOSENKO:

Maybe the officers saw the two going to the

toilet. Maybe there was a contact.

The file

said "maybe." I was sent to Geneva to carry

*As stated earlier, MARK was not a CIA officer in Moscow,

although he did perform certain clandestine tasks for CIA.

He

had no CIA missions in Geneva in 1962.

Within the context of

discussion of NOSENKO's security officer duties during October

1966, NOSENKO was asked to name any CIA officers he knew to be

present in Geneva during the 1962 disarmament talks. MARK waS

the only one he cited.

and, in addition, he was

2. The 1964 TDY

NOSENKO '6 1964 trip to Geneva,

conmencing on 19 January, was

also in the capacity of security officer with the Soviet Dis-

armament Delegatlon.

He said

he was the unly security officer

for the group, which consisted of about 25 persons, and again

he was officially listed as an "expert."

NOSENKO reported that

he had three or

four agents within the delegation and an equal

number of opurational contacts.

The only person whom he was

instructed to watch in particular

waS A.A.

TKACHEY,

an inter-

preter, who had travelled to Austria ir 1960 ard 1961 and who,

the KGB had noted, was in the habit of going about by himself.

Other than this, according to NOSENKO, his responsibilitles

were general in nature.

NOSENKO explained during the February 1965 interrogations

how he was selncted for this ThY.

The protocol he signed on

26 February 1965 states:

"GRIBANOV haC

absolutely nothing to

do with my assignment to Geneva in 1964.

The fitness report

on me for this trip was signed by [F.D.) BOBKOV.

For the 1964

trip no decision of approval of the Central Committee of the

CPSU was required for me or for any other members of the dele-

gation who had been approved for the 1962 trip.

personal wish to make this trip in 1964 and I had discussed the

question with (V.D.) CHELNOKOV even in 1963 and had received

his agreement.

I had also talked about this with (M.V.l

KHLOBUSTOV. and (G.| PANCHENKO [both of the Soviet Delegations

Department).

After it had been decided that I would go,

in

about the beginning of January 196%, (N.I.) ZHARIKOV, the Chief

of the Department,

suggested

that a case officer might not be

required with this delegation.

KHLOBUSTROV, PANCHENKO, and

[A.G.| KOVALENKO [Chief of the Tourist Department and NOSENKO'S

immediate supervisor supported me for the assignment as a

personal favor to me."

With regard to GRIBANOV's knowledge of

his assignment to Geneva this second time, NOSENKO said that he

feared that if GRIBANOV learned about the TDY he would have said,

-"What, again?" and would not have permitted him to go.

for this reason that NOSENKO did not discuss the trip

with GRI-

BANOV, he said, and he did not believe that GRIBANOV, in fact,

knew

anything about it.

*GOLUBEV was also identified by

sou first Chief Directo-

rate counterintelligence officer.

According to Coathe was

one of several KGB officers forced to leave the United States

in 1964 because he wag well

known to NOSENKO.. There 1s no re-

cord in CIA files that GOLUBEV has ever been to Switzerland.

Motivationg and Intentions of NOSENSO

l' Introduction

NOSENKO has not indicated that his professional status 1n

his standard of living in the Sovlet Union, or his

tamily lite prompted his to volunteer to merican Intelligence

in 1962 and to defcct to. the United States in 1.964.

He initially

told CIA that he had been unusually successful during his ten-

year carcer as a KGB counterintelligence officer; his closest

friends and the people whon he adnired most were members of the.

KGB; he enjoyed his work.

The NOSENKO fandly held a high social

position, and their econonic situation

was "luxurious by Soviet

standards."

NOSENKO described his family life as close and

harmonious.

He spoke with fondess

and pride about nis

two

daughters,

of his wife's tolerance

and understanding, of the

companionship she gave him.

He expressed love and a

sense of

responsibility for his widowed sother, who heavily depended

upon him after the death. of his father in 1956.

The

elder

NOSENKO won his son's adulation for having worked his way up

from an apprentice pipefitter in a shipyard to the position of

Soviet Minister of

Shipbuilding.

The NOSENKO name is honored

in the home town of Nikolayevsk, where the shipyard has been

retamod for the former minister and where a statue of him has

been erected in the town square.

By his own account, NOSENKO

thus had had a rewarding home life and a successful and enjoy-

able career in the KGB.

2. Collaboration in 1962

At the outset in 1962, NOSENKO said he wanted to limit his

reports to two items of information.

Before the first meeting

with CIA was over, he went beyond these two items to give de-

and he offered to meet again.

(Four more meetings ensued in

1962, with NOSENKO providing additional information on the KGB.)

He would not defect, NOSENKO said, unless his personal safety

was endangered by the KGB.

Motivations in coming to American

Intelligence,

according to NOSENTO, were his financial emergency

in Geneva and his disaffection for

the Soviet regime.

a. Readiness to Report to CIA

During his 9 June neeting with David MARK, NOSENKO said he

realized, even before talking to representatives of Anerican

Intelligence, that they would not be satisfied with the two

items of information alone--he expected them to insist on more.

He was introduced by MARK to a CIA case officer later the same

day, and at the start of the meeting, the following dialogue

took place:

NOSENKO:

I am not planning to be your agent...

Officer:

further prompting, gave a detailed statenent of his own personal

past and his professional career. In tilis statement he described

his education, his service in the GRU, his entry into the KGB

and generally

the functions and operating techniques of the

various components of the KGB Second Chief Directorate in which

he had served, along

with the inclusive dates of his service

in each.

This account

was very similar to that given MARK

earlier

in the day.

still without prompting, he discussed

several specific KGB operations against Americans inside the

Soviet Union, one involving the recruitment of a Yale University

professor on

the basis of homosexual compromise and the other

an unsuccessful attempt to recruit an American code cleif.

NOSENKO said he was personally involved in both cases.*

The question of his further assistance was then raised

again:

The CIA officer asked NOSENKO to tell more about the

Yale

professor, but NOSENKO demurred, stressing that the agree-

ment involved only two pieces of information and ignoring the

fact that he had already given

considerably more:

NOSENKO :

This exchange was followed by a lengthy description of the two

leads which NOSENKO had come to sell; the BELITSKIY and the

"ANDREY" cases.:

As NOSENKO was about to leave this first meeting, his case

officer asked when they might meet again.

NOSENKO suggested

that they meet two days later, on Monday, around noontime as

it would be easier for him to get away unnoticed at lunchtime.

He then said that the case officer was probably trying to get

everything down on tape and asked that this be stopped because

of the risk to his security resulting from such a permanent re-

cord of their conversations.

NOSENKO said:

"I will not tell

you. anything particularly.interesting.

But I can tell you some-

thing.

But not today. I can tell how LANGELLE blew POPOV--not

LANGELLE, but because of whom and why we found him--for your

end of me." Although he

sometimes voiced moral compunctions, from this point on NOSENKO

expressed his primary personal concern as being his own secur

rity vis-a-vis the KGB.

D...

Attitude Toward Defection

While willing to meet with CIA representatives during

future trips outside the soviet Union, which ie estimated would

occur about once a year, NOSENKO in 1962 refused to corsider

defection except in circumstances where his

would be endangered.

His devotion to his wife

the probability that the kGs would take reprisals against

if he fled were, he said, the primary considerations

refusal.

(Without elaborating or the reasons, NOSENKO said on

another

occasion that he would not want to leave the U'SSR even

on a permanent KG3 assignment and accompanied by his family.)

Other considerations included his widowed mother's dependence

on him and his love of Russia and the Russian people, as opposed

to the regime.

For these reasons, NOSENKO said, he could not

defect as PETROV, GOLITSYN, and KHOKLO! had sone.

c. Motivation

NOSENKO told David MARK on 9 June 1962 that he wanted to

contact American Intelligence because he was in trouble over

the loss of KGB opcrational

funds, for which he had to account

prior to his imminent departure for the Soviet Union.

career would be ruined if he was caught misusing this money,

NOSENKO added, and because he had nowhere else to turn, he was

willing to sell two items of information to Mark.

The

amount

needed to cover the loss was 900 Swiss francs, or about $210,

and this was the price asked for the information.

NOSENKO's statements of motivation to his CIA case officers

during subsequent meetings are given below:

9 June 1962: In his first meeting with a CIA officer NO-

SENKO. asked whether MARK had relayed the reasons why he wanted

to meet with American Intelligence.

He then very briefly re-

peated what he had told MARk concerning the loss of his opera-

tional funds.

The case officer remarked that there must be

something more to it, upon which NOSENKO said that this was not,

in fact, his main motivation:

"I have been working in this

business' for a long time and I know what I an doing.

I have

has been started in the USSR.

In short,

they have begun to do

away with the ministries and the sovnarkhozy.

But this is pre-

mature.

Right now our agriculture is falling apart at the seams

and our industry

is at the point of collapse because this re-

organization,

this innovition, is too early.

And this is not

just me, a young man, talking.

I mingle with ministers, with my

father's friends, and I hear what they are saying..: And how much

Also, look at the serious situation in

These rains are also very settous. It

Why have I told you this! Because under other circumstances

perhaps I would not have come to

for what has happened to me.

This is

perhaps the incident that

drove me into contact with you. It all somehow grew within me.

God knows.

11 June 1962: During the second meeting, NOSENKO himself

raised the issue of motivation.

His case officer had just said

that CIA would respect his wishes in connection with a particu-

lar request when NOSENKO said:

This was my mood.

I say, 'How much is it pos-

sible to deceive the people, the soviet peopie?

How far can

you go?'

Our people are very poor.

It is somewhat difficult

to arouse a people such as this.

If we stir ourselves up we

will know how to stand up for ourselves.

But I feel for my

people.

How often can you say that things will be good; how

often can you say that

we have achieved big successes?

This is

what I say...that there

A terrible resentment.

I love my country. You may

say

that this is nothing.

But I tell you that I cannot act like

GOLITSYN, like KHOKLOV, like PETROY, because I want to be there.

I want to be with my

That's all.

But I feel that not

only the government is making mistakes. I feel that there are

faults throughout the entire system of socialism.

What I mean

is that things are bad in Czechoslovakia, things are bad in Po-

land, things are bad with KADAR (in Hungaryl, they are starving

in China.

This means that there are great mistakes.

well,

that's all.

What did you want

to ask me, please?"

At the close of this meeting, NOSENKO stressed that money

was unimportant as a motive for a

continuing relationship:

"My

name must not be used anywhere, even in your offices.

Understand?

It would be the end of me.

I am not afraid of this.

The subject of motivation was not discussed

phasize "without attempting to justify himself" that he had

"always felt a certain sympathy toward the American people." He

explained that it was not the technical progress of the United

States which attracted him, nor was it the high standard of

living of the Americar people.

It was rather the openness and

directness with which the Americans whom he had met and seen

As examples he cited his American targets

hardest thing is to part with my family." He had, however, care-

fully considered their fate as the close relatives of a defector,

nd he knew that, because of his mother's position in Soviet so-:

ciety, no harm would come to them.

Whereas NOSENKO declared his intent to defect immediately,

the CIA case officers at this first meeting in 1964 persuaded

him to remain in place for at least two of three weeks on the

grounds that,

first, CIA would benefit much from this; and

second, arrangements for his transfer to and reception in the

United

States would have to be coordinated in advance with CIA

Headquarters.

## Page 47

During this first meeting NOSENKO made no monetary request

of CIA and asked only for reasonable assurance of a secure future

in the United States.

In this cornection, he said, he would

prefer to act as a ClA consultant, particularly or counterintel-

ligence matters because he was

specialist in

this field; he

would be able to give CIA leads and assistance in spotting and

recruiting other Soviets.

The next five meetings with NOSENKO were devoted exclusively

to debriefings on the activities of the K3B Second Chief Direc-

torate.

Althoigh his impending defection was mentioned, his

reasons for taking this step were not discussed.

In the mean-

time, NOSENKO's first CIA handler Elew to washington for dis-

cussions regarding the defection and, on his return, told

NOSENKO that the

CIA leadership had asked why,

specifically,

NOSENKO had decided

to come

to the United States at that time.

The answer was that NOSENKO, "aiter coming back and seeing that

there was no more chance to

come to the liest, or little more

chance," felt that this was his one opportunity to come and make

his life with the Americans.

Therefore, he was going to seize

the opportunity while he had it.

Askes

about this, NOSENKO con-

firmed that

this was his

reason,

and added:

"I may never have

another chance, and in addition,

I've had sufficient time since

our last meeting here in Geneva !1962) to weigh everything and to

consider everything."

Later in this same meeting, NOSENKO again

mentioned his lack of interest in money ans his

feelings about

deserting his family:

"I understand (that it will be difficult

to adjust to a new life in Anerical and know

that for some time

I will be sick within.

And I know that a certain period of

time must elapse before this can heal. I ever spoke to you

bluntly about ny (financiall security.

I am absolutely un-

mercenary and have never had any appreciation for money

This is the nost basic and most difficult spot of all.

know perfectly well that I must go through an

illness over

this.

For this the only and the best doctor is time.

I don't

expect to have

a new family there.

Of course, I don't know--

but at least I'm speaking from the way I feel

now.

I have a

strong liking

for children--not only

for my

own,

but for all

children and, losing my own, I

am

fully conscious how I must

suffer through this.

In time I will get used to it.

I know

one can get used to almost anything."

At this meeting, NOSENKO agreed to remain in place for

approximately another week, and

tentative date of 8 Febru-

ary was selected for the defection.

NOSENKO's motives for the defection were not. mentioned

for five more meetings. Then, on 4 February 1964, he telephoned

the Geneva safehouse to say he wanted to defect at once.

AỊ-

riving shortly thereafter, he announced that he had been or-

dered to return to Moscow

the following day and,

therefore, had

to leave Switzerland before morning.

He stated his reasons

formally in an asylum request, written at the time:

This decision was made by me, not now, at the

moment I write this I quest, but several years ago.

Having worked for many

years in the kgB and knowing

4. The letter of July 1954

The most complete explanation given

by NOSENKO of his

motives for first contacting clA and'later delecting to the

United States is contained in a letter to his CIA case officer

in July 1964:

He described this letter as "an exposition of

all those

reasong and roct causes which led to the decision

to leave the soviet Union" and

further explained that "every-

thing put down here is lacking in a whole series of lesser

details which to a greater or lesser degree played their

role."

Nevertheless,

he said, he had tried in this letter

"to set down the main things to show how, when, and why the

decision was born,

grew,

and hardened within me to completely

alter the course of my

life."

This letter is preserted below

in its entirety.

Most of the biosiaphical and operational

details mentioned in the letter are covered separately in other

parts of this paper.

"l.

My life, my childhood and youth passed in

very comfortable circumstances since the position of

my father gave us the opportunity to live without lacking

for anything. And the only difficult periods of my

life (before

the death of my father) were:

study in

the naval schools in kuybyshev, Baku and Leningrad;

and the beginning of my working life, the perios in

the Far East (1950-1952) •

The opportunity to be

always well-dressed, to have a sufficient amount

of money,

to have my own car, to be able to use the

car given me by my family and also my father's car,

the opportunity to travel to the South and to vaca-

tion in the best sanitariums,

dachas, and so forth;

all this unquestionably left its mark on me and be-

came something of a habit.

After the death of y

father, my successful progress in my work gave me a

higher

salary,

and although I did not have all that

which I had while my father was alive,

still I did not

experience any serious difficulties.

But already I

wanted to live still better.

"2. Up to 1953, over the course of my entire

life--at school,

in

the Institute, at work, at home

in the family--it was

always pounded into my head

that STALIN was a great genius, that he was good, keen,

etc., and the thought never occurred to me to question

his words or his deeds because everything that he

said, and everything he did, were completely axiomatic.

The arrestsand trials only involved traitors and it

was considered and explained that the people who

suffered innocently, especially in 1937 and 1938,

suffered only because at the head of the NKVD in 1937,

1938, was the betrayor of the people YEZHOV.

Not

even

the shadow of doubt fell on the name of STALIN.

Soon after STALIN's death in 1953 I read a certain

document given me by my father.

This was

a secret

letter of the Central Committee of the CPSU on the

"case of the doctors;" it was not addressed to all

communists but only to members and candidate members

of the Central Committee.

I was deeply shaken by this

letter which described in detail how these people.

Important spectalists in the field of medicine, were

They were

about the reign of STALIN, all this left its mark and

forced me to think deeply

about the real truth and to

look at everything more critically.

Already I no

longer had faith

in all those ideas which for years

had been pressed into my head.

was always

going to concern itself with the welfare

of the people.

In fact,

it was a struggle for power

cesses,

they didn't exist, the figures

about how

the USSR had. passed the USA ir. the produc-

tion of butter and milk, when in the stores they were

available only infrequently.

The endless promises

of a better life when

in fact nothing of the sort is

taking place.

All this similarly forced me to re-

evaluate not

only the events which were taking place

in the country, but already the entire ideology of

the Party, its external and internal course.

"4.

The events in Novocherkassk where about 20,000

to 25,000 people rose up and the way in which this

popular indignation was suppressed by troops with many

casualties.

This also made a deep impression on me.

When I was resting in the summer of 1961 in Nikolayev,

from my relatives--my father's brothers--I understood

well the real relation of the workers both to the

leadership and to the Party as a whole.

At the same

time I saw how the workers really lived, how they eat,

what they have and what they san buy with their wages.

"5. I heard a great deal from my father about

the domestic policies of KHRUSHCHEV in regard to the

development and the course of constructior in industry,

about his complete illiteracy in engineering techno-

logy and industrial economics, about incorrect deci-

sions in regard to many industries, and this was not

only the opinion of my father, but also of other impor-

VANNIKOV, AKOPOV, and others). But no one dared to

open his mouth and when in December 1955 my father

tried, as an engineer, to prove that a certain deci-

sion would be incorrect, he received such a rebuff

from KHRUSHCHEV. that he was profoundly shaken and in

the opinion of my mother this brought him to his ill-

ness in. 1956 and his death in August 1956.

Hungary showed with absolute clarity the bankruptcy

of communist ideology.

What was especially important

for me was the fact that in these countries it was

a protest not of individuals or groups,

but of the

entire people who could no longer indure a regime

imposed on them by force.

Here it is necessary to

emphasize that the life

of the people in these coun-

tries was much better than that of

the people in the

USSR (I saw for myself how people live in Czecho-

slovakia, in Germany, and beyond any doubt they live

better than the entire people of the Soviet Union).

The split of the international communist

movement became for me a clear fact and confirmed

my opinion that the theory of communism is a theory

built on sand and that it is practiced according to

the needs of the leadership of the Party at a given

stage of life and that in reality full material wel-

fare would never be enjoyed by the people but chly

by the leadership and the Party and

the government.

Such

questions as disarmament, the ban on atomic weapons, the

position of the USSR in the United Nations--all these

a screen for carrying out of the policies needed by

the cormunist party.

My trips abroad opened my eyes wide to the

With my own eyes, I saw how people

how they can dress ind live

on their wages, and I paid special attention to the

life of ordinary people and not to that of scientists,

engineers, etc.

And all the propaganda about the

enormous armies of unemployed in the countries

my head.

And that which I met with in my work, the

a lack of faith and

indecisiveness in me.

Knowing many officers in the FCD, I began

that being sent abroad is entirely

'cleanliness' of

the person's autobiography and complete assurance as

to his limitless dedication to the Party and the

But not only being sent abroad but the

assignment

of personnel in the First and Second Chief

Directorates and the entire KGB depends on the reasons

indicated by me and also on good

relations with the

leadership and good connections with workers in Central

Personnel.

I lived about 11 years with my wife and our

life was not a hell.

It is true that there were

quarrels and basically they boiled down to the fact

that she took an extremely unfavorable attitude to-

suggested that we not do this before her death. And,

of course, my mother will not leave my children without

will be given to my children.

"14. If the defections of PETROV, FASTVOROV and

DERYABIN passed without evoking any particular

thoughts,

the defection to the United States of GOLIT-

SYN, whom I had heard of as an intelligent person and

a capable officer, undoubtedly

caused me to think

very deeply.

Because to act thus,

it is necessary

to have not only boldness and decisiveness, but also

great. strength of will.

And already I put to myself

the question, will I be able to act thus in view of

the dissatisfactions and disillusionments which had

accumulated inside of me?

"15.

Being in Geneva in 1962,

not long before

my departure I myself of my own desire entered into

The reason for this was the loss

money before my departure and there was nobody to

borrow from

cial difficulty

and at the same time he was already

preparing for his return home).

To

tell the truth

about the loss of the money would have meant that it

would be necessary to explain where and in what cir-

cumstances it had been lost.

This would have risked

expulsion

from the KGB and a serious reprimand from

the Party.

Not to tell the truth,

to think up some

sort of a story--they wouldn't believe, and worst of

all, they might think that I had appropriated the

money, that is,

stolen it.

And this would be for me

the worst of all and I would, of course, in such

event have told the truth.

"16.

To tell the truth,

it was only after my

return home from Geneva in 1962 that I gradually, not

immediately, began fully to realize all the seriousness

of my contact with you and its full meaning.

And

although I did not give you ary promises or assurances

about our continued contact in the future, I under-

stood that you sooner or later would set yourself the

task of continuing our contact.

And here it was that'

weighing up all the reasons and causes which I have

indicated above that in 1962 I took for myself the

decision to leave the USSR at the first opportunity

and that I started to work towards being sent on a trip

abroad.

"17.

Of course, I wanted to come abroad with some

sort of

'baggage',

that is, with materials which could

be useful and necessary for you.

up to January 1964

I tried to collect information which

would be of the maximum value

for you.

ment in July 1962 gave me a greater opportunity than

before..

But

at the same time this assignment almost

excluded the possibility of a trip abroad and it was

mly with great difficulty that I was able to got away

for the trip in January. 1964. It was necessary to con-

vince CHELVOKOV and then to ask CHELNOKOV to convince

BOBKOV and in 1963 to convince KOVALENKO.

In this i

advanced many reasons:

that I had not spent all the

money (in foreign currency); that the medicine which

I bought for my daughter had proven very successful

and that I needed to buy some more medicine to carsy

out one more series of treatments; that this trip

would not be a long one and that since I was already

the deputy chief of the Department I would not be able

to travel abroad any more and so, therefore, this trip

would probably be my last.

Of course, all this was

said at convenient moments and outside of work.

Things were easier with the Eleventh Department (which

deals with trips abroad) because I was on good terms

with PENCHENKO who covered Switzerland, besides which

when I came back from Geneva in 1962 I had brought him

a number of presents.

"18.

The publication in 1963 by the foreign press

of the VASSALI case put me on my guard since in the

newspaper Times it said outright that the English

learned about him thanks to the Americans who learned

about VASSALL in the spring of 1962.

Fortunately, the

leadership of the FCD,as I learned from GUK, CHURANCV,

and TARABRIN, came to the conclusion

that here the

Americans had been helped by GOLITSYN.

But at the

same time the FCD was not completely sure of this.

But the publication in the American press of Alsop's

articles on the CIA alarmed me extremely.

This ar-

ticle in one spot said plainly that as far as is known

the KGB does not have any gources in the CIA while at

the same time the CIA has penetrated the KGB.

From

this moment, I do not conceal this fact, I began to

feel afraid

that the KGB would somehow learn of my con-

tact with you.

This article deeply 'interested'

the

KGB.

During the closed trial of PENKOVSKIY I

got a pass in the Second Department and went in order

to look at him myself.

For sometimes it is enough

to simply look at a man, to see how he holds hiniself

and to hear how he speaks in order to form some sort

of an initial opinion of him.

Personally, I liked how

PENKOVSKIY held himself at the trial; I liked his

ap-

pearance and I understood that everything which had

been said in the KGB about him and the sort of person

they were trying to make him out to be (that he was

morally degraded, that he had descended and sunk into

a swamp) that all this was nonsense, bluff, and chatter.

And PENKOVSKIY,

the same as GOLITSYN, gave

me a feeling

of greater confidence in the correctness of the deci-

sion taken by me to leave the Soviet Union.

1. Introduction

The extent to which NOSENKO made himself available for

meetings with CIA in Coneva in 1962 and 1964 is reviewed here

in connection with his statements about the KGB duties assigred

to him for these trips, his visits to the KGB Legal Residency,

and his personal association with other Soviets.

CIA made no attempt

to place NOSENKO under surveillance in 1962 and 1954, and thore

is no evidence from other sources confirming or aisproving

NOSENKO's statements about his activities while away from the

CIA safehouse.

2. Official Duties in Geneva

In 1962 NOSENKO said he was the sole KGB officer in the

94-man Soviet delegation to

the Disarmament Conference and as

such he was responsible for the security and behavior of the

entire delegation.*

assist him in carrying out these security

officer functions, NOSENKO had the services of a number of

coopted informants of the KGB who were serving in the delega-

In addition, NOSENKO had the specific mission of check-

ing on suspicions

attached to one of the delegation members,

SHAKHOV** but ty the time he established contact with CIA,

he said, this assignment had already been completed.

In 1964, NOSENKO said his only operational task then was to

handle the general security

responsibilities for the Soviet

delegation, as he had done

in 1952.

There was no specific

mission such as the one concerning

SHAKHOV in 1962.

NOSENKO has described his investigations of SHAKHOV, but

he has never indicated either that he conducted security checks

of other delegation members in 1962 and 1954, or that he re-

ceived any security-type information (except on SHAKHOV) from

the KGB cooptees who were supposed to be reporting to him.

Likewise, NOSENKO has not said that he prepared communicationg

for KGB Headquarters regarding his clandestine assignments in

Geneva.

3. Visits to the KG3 Legal Residency

Virtually

every day, NOSENKO told CIA in 1962, he went to

the KGB Legal Residency in Geneva, and if he stayed away for

more than a day or two,

the Legal Resident, S. I. GAVRICHEV,

would invariably ask NOSENKO where he had been keeping himself.

I.S. MAYOROV and M.S. ISYMBAL also arrived with the delega-

rion in March 1962 but had left Geneva by the time NOSENKO

contacted CIA.

SHAKOV is discussed further in Part IIi. 3.:.

IS1 SHORES

## Page 55

GAVRICHEV, according to NOSENKO, treated him with deference,

and shortly after his arrival in Geneva In March 1962, NOSENKO

gave a lecture on counterintelligence to the assembled members

This lecture was given at GAVRICHEV'S

request, although it was only after some resitation on the part

of the Legal Resident that all of his subordinates were brought

together to heat NOSENKO.

(In return for helping the Legal

Residency to perform counter-surveillance on several occasions,

NOSENKO said, he was sometimes allowed by GAVRICrav to have the

use of an operational car and driver to go shopping and carry

out other private errands.)

Similarly, in 1964, NOSENKO said he was making nearly daily

visits

to the Legal Residency.

During the 1964 meetings NOSENKO

stated that it was his close relationship with M.s. TSYMBAL*

which made it possible for him to have visited the Geneva Legal

Residency so frequently, both in 1962 and 1964.

"According to

the strict rules,

" NOSENKO told CIA.

"an officer in a status

such as mine should not even go to the residency.

In this case

it is only because I am deputy chief of a department and GAV-.

RICHEV knows my position perfectly well fit is not lower than

his), and because I have such a sympathetic personal relation-

ship with TSYMBiL. "

He then went on to say that ISYMBAL "sort

of escorted me to the Residency.

They could have simply said:

"You are here or. a mission, we have our own mission, and we

have rothing in common. ""

not the case, thanks to TSYMBAL's intervention.

4. Association with TSYMBAL

At the secord meeting with CIA in 1962 NOSENKO volunteered

information on TSYMBAL'S KGB background and his current missions

in Geneva,

then alluded to his having spoken with TSYMBAL in

Geneva but without placing any particular emphasis on this

relationship.

In 1964, however, NOSENKO claimed that their relationship

was close,

explained that it was TSYMBAL (again in Geneva at

the same time) wino gained NOSENKO'S admission to the Legal

Residency,

and said that he had twice gone to see ISYMBAL off

on train

trips, once on 24 January when TSYMBAL wert to Bern

and again on 28 January when TSYMBAL left Lausanne for Rome.

NOSENKO told CIr he had been dealing with TSYMBAL since 1960

or 1961. At that time "We were looking over some candidates

for recruitment and came across some whose background would

have made them

suitable for the Special (Illegals) Director-

ate... Then when we came (here) in 1962 for the Disarmament

Conference, I got to know him a little better - more from the

human side. He seemed to take a liking to me for sore reason.

We had met in Moscow before, of course, but just in the hall:.

or in the dining room.

He used to say:

'Stop in and see me,'

and I would answer: 'Well, it's kind of awkward for me to

hang around the Special Directorate - what am I supposed to be

doing here?' He would say: 'Oh, comeon, stop in. ' But I

5eh901°

TSYMBAL appeared in Geneva under the last-name alias

"ROGOV" and was identified by NOSENKO as Chief of the

Illegals Directorate, KGB First Chief Directorate. Since

1956, TSYMBAL was known by CIA to be the true name for

ROGOV, and COLITSYN reported in 1961 that ISYMBAL was

Chief of the European Department, KGB First Chief

Directorate..

didn't." NOSENKO also said that ISYMBaL had asked him several

times to transfer to the Firet Chief Directorate and had

suggested that he might be assigned to the United States.

In

TSYMBAL's efforts in 1962 to have NOSENKO transferred and his

leaving the impression with GRIFLOV that NOSENKO (who was still

in Geneva) had agreed to this action.

Questioned in April 1964 about his association with ISYMBAL,

NOSENKO stated that he met TSYMBAL. for the first time several

days before their departure for Geneva.

Besides saying again

that he saw TSYMBAL alnost daily at the Legal Residency and

that TSYMBAL's assistance enabled him to enter tre Legal Resi-

dency, NOSENKO reported that in 1962 he went out with ISYMBAL

several times a week to

eat lunch or dinner; sometimes they were

joined by I. S. MAYOROV, * sometimes by h. K. KISLOV (see next

section),

ard sometimes the two ate alone.

During the 1966

interrogations, NOSENKO said that, while he had seen TSYMBAL

on a daily basis in 1962, he san him only twice ir 1964: once

When TSYMBAL travelled to Geneva from Bern

for ore or two days

and later when NOSENKO saw TSYMBAL off for. Rome from Lauranne.

5. Association with Other Soviets

NOSENKO said in 1962 that the other Soviets he saw most

often were A. K. KISLOV and Yu. I. Guk.

**

KISLOV, with NOSENKO

was one of the four members of the Soviet delegation staying

at the Hotel Ariane in Geneva, and was said to be head of the

American Section of TASS and a genuine correspondent *** During

the 1962 meetings with CIA, NOSENKO reported

that KISLOV was

not a KGB officer and made no reference of his having any

affiliation with the KGB.

NOSENKO dia say, however, that he

had arranged for KISLOV's name to be given the KGB double

agent B. Ye. BELITSKIY**** to use as a notional source of

information on Soviet disarmament policy; BELITSTIY was to

pass this information to his CIA contacts.

NOSENKO made

numerous references to drinking and carousing with KISLOV,

specifically with regard to a night in early Jure - when

NOSENKO was robbed of or squandered his operatioral funds,

which brought him to CIA - and on the night of 10 June 1962

when NOSENKC squandered 2000 Swiss francs (the money CIA had

given him) on wine

and women. *****

In giving NOSENKO the

money to defray these personal expenses, the CIA handlers

expressed to him their concern over the dangers to his security

arising from KISLOV's knowledge of this inexplicable source of

income..

NOSENKO replied that there was no need to be concerned

since KISLOV was "too drunk to know what is going on," and in

any event he constituted no threat.

MAYOROV, according to NOSENKO, was visiting Geneva in

order to have operational meetings with agents.

Both KISLOV and GUK are mentioned in the discussion of

the "ANDREY" case (see Part VI.D.3.b.).

GUK was also a

friend of CoLITSyN,

who reported extensively on GUK's

"career in the KC3 including his service in the United

States.

** &

In October 1966 MOSENKO named all the Soviets living at

the Ariane, without mentioning KISLOV.

The BELITSKIY case is discussed in greater length in

Part VI.D.6.

**See Parts II.B. and II.C.2.C.

## Page 57

- 11"1964" Nosenso confirmed"that he had spent much time with

KISLOV in Geneva two years before and that they had become

very friendly.

For the first time, NCSENKO reported that

KISLOV had beer. a KGB operational contact while in the United

States, that he had been introduced to KISLOV by a KGB officer

in Moscow prior to his departure for Geneva in 1962 in order

to be able to exploit him during the Geneva Conference, and

that after returning from Geneva KISLOV had beer. recruited as.

& KGB agent on the basis of a favorable report NOSENKO had

prepared.

Often during the 1962 meetings NOSENKO spoke of his "big,

big friend" CUK, wrom he described as the Deputy Legal Resident

in Geneva and the only "strong officer" in the KGB Legal Res1-

dency.

He implied that his friendship with GUK, a former member

of the KGB Second Chief Directorate, was of longstanding. NOS-

ENKO related that he and GiK were together nearly every day in

Geneva.

They often went out together to chat and have a few

drinks, and as a corsequence, NOSENKO was able to elicit infor-

mation about some of GUK's operations there.

In 1964 NOSENKO

told CIA he found it difficult to obtain information on the

activities of the Geneva Legal Residency because he no longer

had a good friend there like GUK, who had been reassigned to

KGB Headquärters.

When questioned later in 1964 about his

relationship with GUK, NOSENKO said he hau come to know GUK

well only during his 1962 TDY in Geneva.

6. Availability for Meetings with CIA

In speaking to David MARK on 6 June 1962, NOSENKO expressed

displeasure over MARK's insistence on deferring their luncheon

(at which NOSENKO sought contact with American Intelligence)

until three days later.

When

the first meeting with CIA did

take place on 9 June 1962, NOSENKO stayed. for three hours.

and it was at his suggestion that another meeting was scheduled

for 11 June.

This second meeting in 1962 lasted seven hours.

NOSENKO remained in Geneva until 15 June, and in the interim

he met CIA officers three more times for

over seven hours

altogether.

He

offered to meet again on the day of his de-

parture,

but this proposal was rejected as needlessly endan-

gering his security.

From the first 1964 meeting on 23 January to his defection

on 4 February, NOSENKO was

met. a total of 13 times, the sessions

lasting for

five or six hours.

He was able to come to the CIA

satehouse every day but one, and this opportunity was skipped

at the request of the clA handlers.

By mutual consent, most

of the meetings started in the afternoon, but on two occasions

NOSENKO arrived as early as 0930 hours; several meetings went

on until past midnight.

• NOSENKO appeared to be totally at

the disposal of CIA,

to be the master of his time, and to have

no other demands for his attention except for the visits to

the KGB Legal Residency,

"looking in" on an occasional session

of the Disarmament Conference, and attendance at a reception.

E. Tining of Defection

After telling CIA on 24 January 1964 of his decision to

defect,

NOSENKO at the same neeting concurred when CIA gave

operational and administrative reasons for hin to stay in

place until the middle of February.

During the neok that fol-

lowed, the date of the defection was moved up to 8 february

in accordance with NOSENiO's wishes and with his reports in-

dicating that less information of value would be forthcoming

than ClA had at first thought.

On A February, howeve for a

NOSENKO reported that le was being recalled to Moscow

conference en

tureign tourism in the USSR,

and he therefore

placed himsel! in CIA custody on that date.* Details on

the tining of NOSENKO's defection are given in the following

paragraphs.

At the 24 January

iceting the CIA case officers agreed

in principle with NOSElKO's decision to defect. NOSENKO

felt that it would be best for hin to disappear from Geneva

ilthout a trace, leaving all his personal possessions be-

hind: he assu..ed

that ClA could exfiltrate hin fron Switzer.

land to the United States.

He wanted to carry out this

soon as possible,

but the CiA officers encouraged

in--and NOSENSO agreed--to renain in place for at least

three weeks more. The reasons given NOSENKO for this re-

quest were:

- The desire to get information on the local KGB

Legal Residency

and the Soviet delegation to the Dis-

armanent Conference while he still has access to this

infornation;

• The value of having NOSENKO present when O.M.

GRIBANOV mado a visit to Geneva about 7 February a

visit known to CIA only through NOSENKO; **

• The potential value to be derived from NOSENKO's

in place spotting of CIA recruitment targets among the

Soviet representation in Geneva;

- The necessity of making arrangenents, accept.

to NOSENKO, for his defection and resettlement.

The events which followed NOSENKO's agreement to remain

in placo for a short time longer are chronicled below:

The report of NOSENKO's recall to Moscow for the con-

ference on tourism is discussed further in Part III.F.

• GRIBANOV was in 1964 the Chief of the KGB Second Chief

Directorate and,

according to NUSENKO and other sources,

the sponsor of NOSENO's rapid

rise in State Security.

Several far moles sources, have reported that GRIBANOV

was fired from the KGB as a result of NOSENKO's de-

faction (Part Illal.).

NOSENKO's relationship with

GRIBANOV is discussed in Part V.Hl.

## Page 59

26 January 1964: In a three-and-a-half hour meeting,

NOSENKO emphasized that although he agreed that it was

necessary and useful for him to remain in place until the

GRIBANOV Visit to Geneva, he wanted to defect as soon as

possible thereafter.

28 January 1904:

NOSENKO reported that GRIBANOV might

not be coming to Geneva after all, for KGB Chairman

SEMICHASTNYY was apparently reluctant to permit hin to

travel beyond Vienna.

NOSENKO said that he would probably

have definite information on GRIBANOV's trip by the end

of the week.

30 January 1964: At the seventh meeting of the series,

NOSENKO said that there now appeared to be littie likeiihood

that GRIBANOV would visit Geneva or Paris.*

Therefore, he

wanted to defect right away.

As reasons

he cited the

enotional strain of any further delay

and the fact.that he

and his case officers were wasting their time working

against the local KGB Legal Residensy, which had no worth•

while or promising targets.

Ile also telt that nothing of

value could be obtained

from the Soviet delegation because

"ISARAPKIN himself doesn't know what he will

say until he

is told by Moscow the day before."

The CIA handlers, however,

scheme would not work.

He repeated his willingness to remain

in place until the arrival of the CHEREPANOV Papers*, which

he was told were enroute from Washington. He explained that

he had felt pressure at the previous meeting because of an

imminent move by the delegation

from

its hotel to the Soviet

Villa outside Geneva; at the villa his disappearance would

be noticed more quickly.

This move, he had now learned, had

been postponed pending the arrival of a housekeeping officer

from Moscow.

From-* to 10 February 1964 GRIBANOV was in Paris, where

he was seen on the street with a Soviet identified by

NOSENKO as a KGB counterintelligence officer.. There is

no evidence. that he visited Switzerland.

4 February 1961: NOSENKO telephoned the Geneva

safe-

house from his hotel room in the carly afternoon and said:

'"I want to coine nor and not go back."

After arriving he

explained that when he dropped by the KGB Legal Residency fol-

lowing

the morning session

of the lisarmament Conference,

he read a cable ordering him to return to Moscoy innediately

to prepare for a KGB conference on

foreign tourisn in the

Soviet Union. ** The residency was arranging for a ticket for

NOSENKO to fly to loscow via laris the following day, and a

repiacement has being readied to assume NOSENKO's duties ag

security officer for the Soviet velegation in. Geneva; ho was

not told who the replacement could be.

Before he had left

for Geneva in January,

JOSENKO then related, the Soviet Govern-

nent had been Joliberating the question of expanding foreign

tourism in the USSR and had agreed to open a nunder of new

citios and tourist itineraries in this connection.

SEMICHASTNYY

had now decided that it was tine to cüll a conference

to

discuss new

"tactics and strategies" for handling the 1n-

creascú number of tourists expected.

Since NOSENKO had been

placed in charge of the entire conference, he was directed

to leave at once to prepare

a jasic report on the KGs handling

of tourists; the report wouid be read to the conference either

by himself or by soreone fron the leadership of the Kos or

the Second Chief Directorate.

OSENKO explained that he was

the only one who could do this joù as La.

Col. A.ú. KOVALENKO,

the KGB Headyuurters Department senior officer, was a rel-

atively now man in this line of operations, having been

there only four or five years, perhaps

less.

NOSEYKO also

told CIA that "by great coincidence"

he had learned, just be-

fore the cable arrived, he was being moved to the soviet

vilia on the morning of 5 February.

He had arranged for a

Soviet chauffeur to bring a car around at 0930 hours the

next morning for the move.

His absence wouid be noted at

that tire,

and therefore

"the main thing is to cross the Swiss

border before

morning."

NOSENKO felt, nowever, that there

would be considerable confusion among the Soviets in Geneva

for a time following his disappearance, and that there would

be no real concern until the evening..

To foster Soviet un-

certainty he had left his clothing lying around his hotel

IOOm

and had brought no personal effects to the CIA safe-

house.

NOSENKO estimated the first Soviet queries to Swiss

NOSENKO was driven to Frankfurt the night of 4 February

remained in a safehouse there until ll February, when press

Soviet Official Reactions

The Chief of the Soviet, Delegation to the Dis-

armament Conference notified the Soviet Ambassador in Bern

shortly before noon on 6 February 1964 that NOSEIKO had dis-

appeared, correctly placing the date as 4 February; they

speculated that

he might have been "poisoned" or injured in

a car acciâent.

Two more days passed without Soviet authorities

making any additional public or private statements on the subject.

Later events showing Soviet official reactions to NOSENKO's de-

fection are presented below in chronological order:

B February:

A Soviet spokesman in Geneva reported to

Swiss police that NOSENKO,

an "expert" temporarily assigned to

Geneva, had been missing for four days.

9 February:

Evening news broidcasts in Geneva carried

reports attributed to both Soviet and Swiss sources that NOSENKO

had disappeared.

10 February:

Unidentified Soviet sources were quoted in

the press as having said it was presumed that he had defected.

A U. S. Department of State press release was issued iden-

tifying NOSENKO as a KGB officer

and

acknowledging his request

for political asylum in the United States.

11 February: The Department of State was advised informally

by Amoassador DOBRYNIN in Washington that a Soviet note to be

delivered later would ask how NOSENKO had left Switzerland,

request his release, and demand an immediate interview with him.

1? February: S. K. TSARAPKIN, the head of the Soviet Dele-

gation to the Disarmament Conference, read a statement at a press

conference in which he

strongly condemned the Swiss authorities

for permitting NOSENKO'S

"kidnapping"

and for hindering efforts

to locate him.

TSARAPKIN demanded that immediate steps

be taken

to return NOSENKO to Soviet custody.

At simultaneous press conferences in Bern and Geneva, the

Swiss rejected these accusations of non-cooperation and noted

the Soviet delay in advising the police of NOSENKO's disappear-

ance and Soviet failure to cooperate with Swiss authorities in

locating NOSENKO.

The Soviet note predicted by DOBRYNIN was delivered to

the State Department, and a noncommittal reply was given to

Apparently no effort was made to notify Moscow immediately.

Special intelligence shows that no cable traffic was passed

from Geneva to Moscow from 1630 hours on 3 February until

1900 hours on 7 February:

at 1915 hours on the 7th, the

Geneva Residency transmitted a short top priority cable to

MoScoW. Likewise, after one routine cable on 4 february,

the Bern Residency sent no traffic to Moscow on 5 February.

Seven cables, at least four of which were of routine pre-

cedence, were sent to Moscow. on 6 February; thereafter there

was no traffic from Bern to Moscow until the early morning

of 10 February.

Soviet queries concerning the requested Interview and the

means of NOSENKO's departure from Switzerland.

The Swiss Enbassy asked for a meeting with NOSENKO in

order to obtain assurance that the defection had been volun-

tary.

Arrangements were made to have NOSENKO meet with Swiss

and soviet representatives in washington as soon as possible.

(NOSENKO arrived in Washington at 2130 hours this same

evening.

13 February:

NOSENKO said he had no objection to talking

to the Swiss, but he would see the sovlets only if necessary.

14 February: In Moscow, Ambassador KOHLER was summoned

to the office of Soviet Foreign Minister GROMYKO, who read

him a statement deploring the "evasive" reply of the State

Department to Soviet inquiries in Washington and terming the.

whole event of NOSENKO's disappearance a

"gross provocation

by American

Intelligance organs."

GROMYKO repeated the demand

fOI NOSENKO's immediate release from American custody.

The Counselor of the Swiss Embassy, Jean-Louis NATURAL,

Interviewed NOSENKO at the Washington offices of the U.s.

Immigration and Naturalization Service late in the afternoon.

The Soviet confrontation immediately afterwards was handled

by Mirister Counselor G. M. KORNIENKO, second to Anbassador

DOBRYNIN at the Soviet Embassy, and Third Secretary V. F.

ISAKOV, a recent arrival in Washington.

(ISAKOV had been a

member

of the Soviet Delegation to the

1962 Disarmament

Conference ir. Geneva, where NOSENKO said he had first met. him.)

NOSENKO told both the Swiss and the Soviets that he had defected

of his own free will after careful consideration and that hu

had no desire to return to the Soviet Union.

In response to

KORNIENKO's questions, he specifically renounced his status and

rights as a Soviet citizen.

H. Reactions of NOSENKO's Family

Two women who said they were the mother and wife of NOSENKO

called at the Anerican Embassy in Moscow on five occasions

netween 24 February and 23 March 1964,* and NOSENKO, who on

the basis of physical descriptions confirmed their identities,

said he had no doubt that the KGB had directed them to do this

in order to pressure him to return.

The women expressed dis-

belief that NOSENKO had voluntarily betrayed his family and his

to the Imbassy to ask whether he had replied; the younger Mrs.

NOSENKO explained that she required some definite

statement in

writing from her husband so

she could plan her own future

and that of the NoSENKO children.

NOSENKO proposed to respond to his

family's letters by

writing two of his own, one which would be intended for KG3

consumption and the other for his wife alone.

would express hope

for a reunion, ask her to wait for hin, and

tell her to

by writing either

"yes" or "no" on the letter itself.

Although

NOSNEKO prepared both letters, only the first was sent to his

wife; it was mailed from Washington to the NOSENKO home in

Moscow on 1 April 1964.

From March 1964 nothing was heard from NOSENKO's relatives

until mid-1966, when Yurly Dmitriyevich KOROLEV,** a Soviet

journalist, visited Paris and spoke with representatives of the

French magazine Paris Match. KOROLEV indicated that he rould

NON-KGB АБРЕСТА- OF NOSENKODBIPE

A.

Introduction

The biography of NOSENKO is built largely upon his oratate-

ments to CIA, but certain portions of it have been substantiated

(as well as contradicted) by other Soviet sources. Given first

below is the NOSENKO autobiography for the period

preceeding his

entry into the has, then follows a summary of his statements

about his non-professional life since becoming a KGB officer, and

finally there is presented a review of what other sources have

said on these subjects.. A separate section of this paper, Part Vo

discusses NOSENKO'g career in the KGB.

B.

NOSENKO'S Pre-KGB Autobiography

Although several other sources have since NOSENKO's defec-

tion furnished fragmentary information concerning NOSENKO's early.

personal history, NOSENKO himself has, of course, been the prin-

cipal source on this topic.

He volunteered information during

the 1962 meetings, during

debriefings in early 1964, and under

interrogation in April 1964, in 1965, and in 1956.

These vari-

ous accounts are arranged in separate coianng in the following

table, and they are organized chronologically from NOSENKO's

birth to his alleged entry into the KCB.

The first column in

the table contains statements which NOSENKO made during the June

1962 meetings in Geneva; these were taken from the transcripts

of the meetings and, for the

most part, are in NOSENKO's own

words.

The column headed "1964," derived from the April 1964

interrogation, reflects a number of changes in his story before

and during that interrogation.

Most of the information given

in the "1965" column was taken from discussions with NOSENKO,

mainly on his early years, by

a CIA psychologist in May of that

year; however, material from the February 1965 interrogation

and from DERYABIN's interrogation in July and August has also

been included when it was not covered in the psychologist's ques-

tioning and when NOSENKO signed protocols certifying his state-

ments to be correct.

The

"April 1966" column is comprised of

remarks by NOSENKO in a signed autobiography submitted to CIA

at that time.

The final column presents

the results of the

October 1966

interrogation as they pertain to NOSENKO's early

life.

from column to column appear inconsistercles and contra-

dictions with regard to dates and locations furnished by NOSENKO,

although in 1964, again in 1965, and most recently in October

1966 NOSENKO has said that he was "now" telling the truth.

The

table shows where he has admitted having previously lied about

certain events and where he seems to have forgotten his earlier

statements to CIA about the occurrence of other events affecting

his life.

This tabulation of NOSENKO's autobiography concludes in

Part V.A., in which are quoted the various dates and circum-

stances

concerning his entry into the KGB which NOSENKO has

given in 1962, 1964, 1965, and 1966.

C. Personal Affairs Since Entering the KGB

1. Family Life

The Soviet internal passport which NOSENKO carried to

Geneva in 1964 confirms his claim that he married Lyudmila

KOZHEVNIKOVA on 27 June 1953.

(They married approximately

six months

says he joined the KGB.)

Immediately after their narriage

the couple moved

into the home of NOSENKO's new in-laws at

Ulitsa Serafimovich 2, Moscow, where they lived until obtain-

ing their own apartment on Narodnaya Ulitsa in January 1955.*

KOZHEVNIKOVA's father is Yulian Mikolayevich KOZHEVNIKOV, a

metallurgical engineer by training, who held the position of

First Deputy Chairman of the State Scientific Research Com-

mittee

(GKKNIR) of the RSFSR at the time of NOSENKO's defec-

tion.**

NOSENKO said that he has two daughters by this second

marriage.

According to his passport, the eldest of these,

Oksana, was born on 21 August 1354' and the other, Tamara,

on

13 July 1958.***

NOSEUKO in 1952 displayed to his CIA handlers

a photograph of the two girls and their nother and made a par-

ticular point of noting the close physical resemblance between

his first GRU post in the Far Fast, he lived in an apart-

ment on Meshchanskaya Ulitsa. He gave up this apartment,

he said, in 1950, when. his Navy orders came through.

Having

nade this

the 1951 Moscow telephone directory still listed him at

the Meshchanskaya Ulitsa address. He replied that he could

not explain but that he was considered to have vacated the

house in 1950.

(He later said he moved to the Far East in

1951 - see Section IV.B. ) NOSENKO ther said that the

previous tenant at Narodnaya Ulitsa 13 had been one Nikita

ISHCHENKO.

Although the phone then in the apartment was

switched to NOSENKO's name for billing purposes, NOSENKO

never bothered to have

phone book; he said that this would have required a visit

to a downtown office, the filling out of numerous forms,

etci; besides he added, he did not use

way.

Therefore, NOSENKO said, from 1955 until his defec-

tion in 1964, the telephone in his apartment was listed

under the name of ISHCHENKO.

He has repeated this story

during subseguent questionings.

The 1961 Moscow phone

directory carries no listing for NOSENKO; it does list

ISHCHENKO but gives his address as Krasnokholmskaya

Naberezhnaya, not Narodnaya Ulitsa.

is now the GNTK. PENKOVSKIY worked

NOSENKO has also given his second daughter's year of birth

as 1957.

In 1962 he told CIA that the older daughter was

then studying in the first class at school; in 1965, how-

ever, he said she began school in the fall of 1962.

Oksana and himself.

He said that he and his wife refer to her

"double"

(kop-ya).

His wife, in a letter after the

defection, referred to Oksana as NOSENKO's kopiya.

NOSENKO's father,

the Shipbuilding Minister, died of

stomach cancer in August 1956, three years after NOSENKO says

he entered the KGB. Second Chief Directorate.

The period of

time surrounding his father's death was, according to NOSENKO,

a turning point in his personal and professional life.

It was

drinking and wenching, and indifference to his work.

2.

Venereal Disease

The incident which NOSENKO has most often cited as an

example of his irresponsibility in the period prior to 1956

involved his illegal use of KGB alias documents to cover treat-

ment for a case of gonorrhea he contracted in 1954, at the time

his wife was pregnant with their first child.

ThE CIA psycho-

Logist who questioned NOSENKO in May 1966 submitted the follow-

ing summary of HOSENKO's statements about this incident, which

about as given earlier (during the April 1964 interroga-

tion) :

"A girl friend he had known in Leningrad since 1945 came

to visit relatives in Moscow in 1954.

She called him, and he

spent some time with her.

She was not a prostitute, and he

had slept with ner before, so he thought nothing of it. Later

he developed what he feared was a venereal disease.

Since his

wife was pregnant, he was safe both from discovery and the

danger of infecting her.

He searched frantically around Moscow

Ior a private doctor wo treated such diseases, but could not

Some of his friends at the

office suggested a central

clinic that would require no documents.

He went here but when

confronted with a request for documents, had the choice of

showing his KGB certificate or ising a false passport he had

for business.

He tried to talk the doctor into letting him

go home to get his documents, but the doctor said re would have

to be accompanied by a member of the militia; otherwise he

might not come back.

He was required to take treatment of a

conrunicable disease.

He was forced to give the false document.

He. Came back for treatment about three times and was ordered

to report back in two weeks for a final

check.

They also

demanded the name of the

girl, but he claimed

he had only just

met her and did not know who she was.

He forgot to go back

and a nurse visited the safehouse about two times and left

a note for him to report.

However, he did not go to the safe-

house so knew nothing of the note.

In the false passport was

a listing of where the named person worked, a fictitious

factory.

As the result of the clinic inquiries, the request

for information got into the hands of the section which made

the docurents.

MOSELKO was called before the deputy chief of

the Directorate and severely criticized.

He explained what

had happened and was given five days of

house arrest.

However.

the chief of his section had also gotten word of the

infraction

and sentenced him to fifteen days of house arrest without even

talking to him.

He toid his wife he was going on a trip and

moved into the administrative room near the office to serve

his term.

In the meantime, the Secretary of the KGB Party

Committee called NOSENKO's father on the phone and told him

the whole story.

NOSENKO's father never toli either NOSENKO'S

wife of mother of the incident, but did chide NOSENKO about

it..

The incident was brought before the Komsomol and discussed.

A written reprimand for immoral conduct-unauthorized use of

official documents was placed in his recora.

This was also

a final warning meaning

that any other infraction would result

in expulsion.

He made the statement

that he had been punished

for this incident many times.

He could not immediately apply

for party membership; the incident was broucht up repeatedly

in Konsomol meetings

and even in party meetings (after he was

accepted) as a horrible example; and it kept him from being

promoted from Senior Lieutenant to Captain.

(The Deputy-

Director who

gave him five days was a member of the promotion

commission.)"

Although there have been slight changes and contradictions

in NOSENKO's numerous accounts of this story (the house arrest

was variously reported as 5, 10, and 15 days) it remained

basically consistent until the October 1966 interrogations

when he said for the first time that he contracted gonorrhea

from the girl in Leningrad in 1945 rather thar. 1954.

In 1954,

he said,

he again was infected, this time by a prostitute whom

he picked up

in the vicinity of the Leningrad Railroad Station

in Moscow.

When the KGB required that he reveal the source.

NOSENKO said, he ascribed the latter case to the origiral girl

from Leningrad.

During the October 1966 interrogations NOSENKO

also told CIA for the first time that he had had venereal

disease on

two other occasions while studying at the Institute

of International Affairs.

He later began to "feel more a part of the KGB," and as

a junior KGB case officer,

BURGI in the first successful recruitment operation carried

out by the newly-created Tourist Departmert of the Second Chief

Directorate.*

"And in 1956," NOSENKO said ir. 1964, "cefore

my father's death, I was made a candidate for membership in

the Communist Party and, exactly 15 days later, was assigned

the rank of Senior Case Officer.

forth."

3, Affiliation with Comnunist Party Organs

NOSENKO said that his formal participation in Connunist

Party activities began in late 1943 or early 1944 when he

joined the Komsomol at the Naval Preparatory School in Baku.

This step was a casual one, and he has said that he took it

without much thought, mainly because all his friends were

See Part V.D.4.b. for a description of the BURGI recruit-

ment operation.

Until 1966 NOSENKO claimed to CIA that

he had received an award for his participation in this

operation.

In the October 1966 interrogations he retracted

this and said that he never received any KGB award for the

BURGI or any other operation.

jolning..

When NOSENKO entered the KGB in the spring of 1953.

he transferred routinely to the Konsomol organization there

and became

Secretary of the Komsomol Organization of the

Second Chief Directorate.

This was a small organization

consisting, NOSENKO thought, of about 17 KGB employees; he

remained its secretary until June or July 1954,

when he got

into the trouble over illegal use of operational documents.

According to NOSENKO,

"Inmediately after this incident the

Bureau of the Komsomol was gathered, and I was immediately

removed from the position of Secretary." A week later, a

"strict reprimard" was entered in NOSENKO's Konsomol records.

In October 1954, on the eve of his 27th birthday, NOSENKO

was

forced out of the Komsomol for over-age.*

At that time,

the "strict reprimand" he had received several months earlier

was remitted on NOSENKO's petition, and he was permitted to

leave the organization with a clean record.

He was not per-

mitted to join the Communist Party immediately, however.

NOSENKO described the situation on 15 April 1964 as follows:

"Now I had to prove myself.

Not being a candidate for Party

membership. I asked them for assignments to show my eagerness,

to prove myself. I also asked the Party Organization of the

Second Chief Directorate for some

'public service' (obshchest-

venniy) assignments.

I collected newspapers."

For a year,

"made good" by running errands and performing other

such tasks, until it was decided that he was suitable for

Party membership.

He applied in January 1956 and was accepted

as a candidate member of the Party in June the same year;

full membership was granted in 1957.

For over a year, from

October 1954 until January 1956, NOSENKO said, he had

the

distinction of being the only employee of the

KGB who was

neither a Komsomol nor a Party member or applicant.

Statements to Others. by NOSENKO

Before giving CIA the foregoing details, NOSENKO had

talked about himself to several non-Soviets, including persons

involved in cases which are reviewed in other portions of this

On this basis, NOSENKO should have been excluded

When

this was explained to NOSENKO by DERYABIN in July 1965,

NOSENKO replied that he was certain he left the Komsomol

in 1954 upon reaching the age of 27, that he was sure the

maximum age was 26 at that time, and that no special

two daughters.
