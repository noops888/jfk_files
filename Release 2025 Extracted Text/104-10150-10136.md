Introduction

The judgment of NOSENKO's bona fides entailed the

distillation of the huge volume of counterintelligence

information assembled in connection with his case, including

the product of his lengthy interrogations, the analysis of

KGB

operations which he related, the results of file checks

of thousands

of

individuals involved, comparison of his

assertions against collateral information from all sources

and with counterintelligence

records on the KGB and related

matters:

The: examination herein reduces this volume of

material to manageable proportions, to essential elements

of NOSENKO's claims, in order to permit comparison of his

statements with matters of known fact and to permit appli-

cation of reasonable judgment.. Conclusions are drawn from

the examination of each major period in his claimed

biography. The final conclusions represent the aggregate

of conclusions independently drawn from the examination

of

each major period in his claimed biography.

Summary of Case

The NOSENKO case opened on 5 June 1962 in the corridors

of the Palais des Nations in Geneva during the United Nations

Disarmament Conference.

A Soviet official approached an

American diplomat with the suggestion that they get together

for a talk the following day.

The diplomat advised CIA of

appointment, explaining

that he thought the approach so

unusual that it might be an offer of cooperation or defection.

He said he believed the Soviet to be Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO,

a member of

the Soviet Disarmament Delegation.

Later

meeting with the American diplomat, the Soviet

official identified himself as NOSENKO. and stated he was

a

KGB counterintelligence officer sent to Geneva to ensure the

security of the Soviet delegation.

He knew that the American

had previously served in Moscow and erroneously believed

that

he was the "American Rezident" in Geneva.

NOSENKO stated

that he needed

approximately 900. Swiss francs immediately to

cover. KGB

operational funds which he had squandered

liquor and a

prostitute in Geneva.. He offered for this amount

to sell two items.of information to American Intelligence.

These were the identity of a

former American Embassy employee

in Moscow who was a KGB agent "near ciphers" in the Washington

area, and the identity of a Soviet in Moscow who, although

ostensibly a CIA agent, was actually controlled by the KGB.

In reply, the American explained that he was not an intelli-

gence officer, but

that he

could place NOSENKO in contact

with an appropriate u.S. official in Geneva later that same

day.

evening NOSENKO was met by

a CIA officer

and a three-

hour meeting followed

at a CIA safehouse in Geneva.

Describing

KGB major experienced in operations against the

American Embassy in Moscow and against tourists and other

travellers to the Soviet Union, NOSENKO told the CIA officer

of his financial difficulties and repeated his offer to sell

the two items

of information. He said that the need

for money

was his

immediate morive for

contasting ClA, alchough In the

ensuing discussion he aiso expressed dissatisfartion

Communist regime in the Soviet Union.

NOSENKO met CIA representatives

four more rimes in Geneva

in June 1962.

Wich the second

meeting on i1 June, his earlier

expressed reservations disappeared almost

entirely. He

answered most questions put to him on KGB organization and

operations.

His knowledgeability was almost exciusively

limited to the KGB Second Chief Directorate (responsible for

counterintelligence and security within he USSR;.

NOSENKO

seemed

to be what he claimed to be:

a KGB officer in a

sensitive position with knowledge of important KGB operations.

NOSENKO returned to Moscow on 15 June, having promised

to do everything within certain limits to colleir information

on matters indicated to be of interest to CIA.

The only

restrictions he placed on his cooperation were his absolute

refusal

to permit operacional contact with him inside the

USSR and his request that no mention of his collaboration be

communicated to the American Embassy in Moscow.

He promised

to notify CIA via an acconmodation addiess when he came to

the West again.

NOSENKO again accompanied the Soviet delegation to the

Disarmament Conference in Geneva in January 1964.

Since last

meeting with CIA he had been promoted to the rank of lieu-

tenant colonel and had become the Deputy Chief of the largest

department in the Second Chief Directorate.

At the first

of the new series of meetings on 23 January he announced

that he had decided to defect to the United States.

cited as reasons his continuing dissatisfaction with the

Soviet regime and the fact that he probably would have no

further opportunities to travel to the West in the foresee-

able future.

Although he implied that he wanted

to defect

as soon as possible, he agreed to remain in place in Geneva

while arrangements

reception were being made in

Washington.

NOSENKO had brought a large amount of new

information, much of it in scribbled notes, on KGB opera-

tional activity which he had collected in the 18 months

since his last meeting with CIA:

(Summary of Case)

On 4 February,

four

days before the date tentatively

for NOSENKO's defection, he reported that he had

received a cable from KGB Headquarters ordering his immediate

return to Moscow to participate in a KGB conference on

foreign tourism to the Soviet Union.: That night exfiltration

plans were implemented and NOSENKO was driven across the

border to. Germany where his debriefing was resumed

Frankfurt safehouse..

The decision was reached: on l1 February

to bring NOSENKO to the United States, and in the early

evening of 12. February he and his CIA escorts arrived in

Washington via commercial aircraft, thence

to a safehouse

in the Washington area.

At the request of the Swiss and Soviet Governments,

NOSENKO met on 14 February with representatives of their

respective Washington Embassies in the offices of the U.S.

Immigration and Naturalization Service.

He told both

he had defected on his own free will after careful consider

ation and that he had no desire to return to the Soviet

Union. In answer to the questions of the Soviet represen-

tatives, he orally renounced his status and rights as

.a.

citizen of the

. USSR.

CIA completed its initial debriefings of NOSENKO on

18 February, and on 24 February he was introduced to:

representatives of the FBI for questioning.

At about the

same

time,

there was a marked change in NOSENKO's comport-

ment. While outwardly cooperative during most debriefing

sessions, it became increasingly difficult to get him

respond to specific questioning. His free time in Washington

and

nearby cities was punctuated'by drinking bouts, crude

behavior, and disputes with his security escort. He explained

his behavior by saying that he was under great tension as

a result of his defection,

abandonment of his wife and

children, and the disgrace that he had brought

name, and on this basis CIA acceded to NOSENKO's demand for

a vacation: On 12 March, NOSENKO left Washington with a

and two CIA security guards for a two-week

visit to Hawaii.': There his behavior deterioriated still

further. He drank heavily and almost constantly; he

consorted with a number of prostitutes; he was loud and crude

in public places; and he spent money extravagantly and

conspicuously.

(Summary of Case)

During NOSENKO's absence from Washington, consultations

were held with the FBI regarding steps to be taken

to restrict

his movements and activities.

that his behavior would attract undesirable atrention and

publicity, perhaps police arrest, and that doubts about his

bona fides, which were becoming known to a widening group

in the U.S.. Government, might be inadvertently revealed to

NOSENKO himself.

The FBI on 1 April indicated

ic would

"not interpose objection" to the CIA plan to limit NOSENKO's

freedom of movement, and the Acting Attorney General, the

Depariment of State, and the White House were advised.

On 4 April NOSENKO was

driven to a new safehouse in a

Washingion suburb, and told that this safehouse chenceforward

would be his regular place of residence.

Since that time

NOSENKO has had contacts with CIA personnel only, has been

under full-time guard, and has not been permitted

access to

news media.

Intensive interrogation of NOSENKO, including a polygraphic

examination, was begun on 4 April 1964 in order to obtain

information

which he had been reluctant to divulge earlier,

and to clarify contradictions

In what he had already reported.

polygraph examination results were inconclusive.

phase of the interrogations was terminated on 24 April 1964.

Despite the searching nature of the questions and the

implicitly and explicitly expressed doubts of his veracity,

NOSENKO asserted that he was willing to answer, or to try to

answer all questions put to him.

Because more information

pertinent to the question of his bona fides was needed, a

new series of interrogations was begun in mid-May 1964.

Different interrogators were introduced and questioning was

resumed in a neutral, non-hostile manner. The period of

neutral

questioning continued until mid-November 1964.

After further consultations with the FBI, a round of

hostile interrogations began on 26 January 1965. Between

then and 5 March, NOSENKO was questioned for a total of

about 140 hours by individual interrogators and interrogation

teams, and he was directly challenged on many of his previous

assertions.

He admitted that certain of his earlier statements

had been incorrect, and that he could not explain contradictions

(Summary of Case)

in his testimony: Nevertheless, NOSENKO maintained he had

been basically truthful, and that he had come to the United

States solely

for the reasons he had originally given.

These interrogations were suspended on 5 March 1965c

Questioning of NOSENKO during the

summer and autumn of

1964

and the interrogations of January and February 1965

concentrated on the period of his claimed service in the

American Embassy Section of the American Department, KGB

Second Chief Directorate, from January. 1960

to January 1962*

Among the reasons for selecting this particular period were

the comparatively large amount of collateral information

available against which NOSENKO's statements could be checked;

the importancè of the Embassy and its personnel as critical.

KGB Second Chief Directorate targets; their importance from

the standpoint of American security; and the extent of

NOSENKO's

claimed knowledge of the

activities of the Embassy

Section, of which he claimed to have been Deputy Chief.

In keeping with a Soviet practice with which NOSENKO was

familiar; CIA asked NOSENKO in February 1965 to sign a series.

of interrogation reports, so-called "

protocols", most of

which cöncerned

the period of his clained service in the

American Department

These were written by the CIA

interro-

gators, and they were designed to set forth NOSENKO's exact

statements and meaning on various specific subjects.. The

protocols were

in no way presented to. NOSENKO as

documentary

portions of a

"confession"

but rather as distilled and

final

statements of what he did

and did not know concerning

particular

topics. NOSENKO was

asked to read each. page.of

each protocol carefully and to sign his name at the bottom

to indicate that he understood and agreed with its contents;

he was allowed the use of a dictionary and was permitted to

ask any questions and make any changes that he wished.

(Amendments were entered by the interrogators and were

initialed by NOSENKO.)

NOSENKO was asked, after reading

each page

and after completing the entire protocol, whether

he understood what was written there and whether there were:

any more changes he wished to make. He was then asked to

sign and date the statement,

"I have

read and understood

this report and certify it as correct"

at the end of the

final page. With one exception, he did so calmly and without

objections.

In. one or two

instances he remarked chat his

statements were presented in such a manner as

to make them

(Summary of Case)

look foolish, but he was not able to suggest any changes of

fact or presentation which would make them more accurate.

Commenting on the

use of interrogation reports, NOSENKO said

on 4 March 1965: "My life story is absolutely correct.

Anything I have

signed is absolutely correct.

I absolutely

understand what I am doing when I am signing any paper.

This is an official document, and I fully understand what

I'm doing when I sign it as being absolutely correct."

Further questioning was conducted from 26 July until

14 August 1965 with the participation of Petr DERYABIN, a

former KGB officer. These interrogations, held in Russian,

were for the purpose of using DERYABIN'S KGB experience to

obtain a clearer understanding of NOSENKO's claimed personal

professional background.

During

the period 19-25. October 1966, NOSENKO was

questioned for seven days on specific aspects of selected

copics ranging from his identity to his involvement in and

knowledge of specific KGB operations. Questioning

boch Russian and English. Although the interrogations

identified topics and time periods in NOSENKO's accounts

which contained the greatest number of contradictions and

discrepancies, neither the contradictions nor the discrep-

ancies could

be resolved.

Because of the incidence of deranged persons CIA has

encountered among would-be defectors, the question of

NOSENKO's mental stability was

a matter considered early

after his defection in Geneva.

From his arrival in the

United States in 1964 NOSENKO has been under psychiatric

observation. A CIA psychiatrist and a CIA psychologist,

both with extensive experience with Soviet Bloc defectors,

monitored many of NOSENKO's interrogations. In May 1965

the psychologist for three weeks

questioned NOSENKO on his

life from birth until 1953, when NOSENKO claimed he joined

the KGB, in an attempt to identify psychological

factors

which might underlie NOSENKO's contradictory and inconsistent

accounts.

The psychiatrist has continued his

periodic

observations of NOSENKO to the present time. The psychiatrist

and the psychologist concluded independently, on the basis

of their observations, that NOSENKO was mentally stable.

CHAPTER I

FOUNDATIONS OF NOSENKO'S CLAIMS

Evidence of NOSENKO's bona fides is

comprised of his own

statements, the corroborating statements of Soviet officials,

and the counterintelligence information he has provided.

NOSENKO's Statements About Himself

In his meetings in 1962 and 1964 with CIA abroad

the course of the interrogations since, NOSENKO has made

statements about himself. More than any other,

however, a statement written in July 1964 (after the initial

hostile interrogation was concluded) is a thoughtful and

well-expressed

exposition of how he wished CIA to regard

him. It is quoted here in its entirety.

My life, my childhood and youth passed in very

comfortable circumstances since the position of

my father gave us the opportunity to live without

lacking for anything. And the only difficult

periods of my life before the death of my father

were at the naval schools attended in Kuybyshev,

Baku and Leningrad, and at the beginning of my

working life, when I was in the Far East in 1950-

1952.

The opportunity. to be always well-dressed,

to have a sufficient amount of money, to have my

own car, to be able to use the car given me by my

family and

also my father's car, the opportunity

to travel

to the South and

to vacation in the best

sanitariums, dachas, and so forth; all

unquestionably left its mark on me and became

something of a habit. After the death of my father,

my successful progress in my work gave me a higher

salary, and although I did not have all that which

I had while my father was alive, still I did not

experience any serious difficulties. But already

wanted to live still better.

Úp to 1953, over the course of my entire life--at

school, in the Institute, at work, at home in the

family--it was always pounded into my head that

Stalin was a great genius, that he was good, keen,

etco;

and the thought never occurred to me to

question his

words or his deeds because everything

that he said, and everything he did, were completely

axiomatic. The arrests. and trials

only involved

traitors

and it was considered and explained that

the betrayor of the people was Yezhow, the head of

the NKVD. Not even the shadow of doubt fell' on the

name: of Stalin.

Soon after Stalin's death in 1953

I read a certain document given me by my father.:

This was

asecret letter of the Central Committee

of the CPSU on the 'case of the doctors;' it was

not addressed to. all communists but only to members

and candidate

members of the Central Committee.

I was deeply shaken

by this letter which described

in detail how these people, important specialists

in the field of medicine, were brought to such a

condition that they

condemned themselves; that is,

they confessed to things which had never happened,

to things which they'had never, done.

They were

simply forced to

give the evidence which was needed

by the investigators.

The secret letters on the

cult of Stalin and

much that: I heard in the KGB

about the reign of Stalin, all this left its mark

and forced me to think deeply about the real truth

and to look at everything more critically.

I no

longer had faith in all those ideas which for years

had been pressed into my head.

The new leaders (Khrushchev

and Company) used the

same methods but already diluted with the

water' of

democracy, with playing up to the people and attempts

"to convince.them

that a new

eta would arise, a new

and better life; and that now the Party was always

going to concern itself with the welfare of the

people...In

fact, it was a struggle for power and

the use of

all means in this

struggle,

even micro-

phones. (they listened to the conversations of

Beriya and his friends; later they listened to the

conversations of Molotov, Malenkov, Kaganovich, and

others).:: Khrushchev's endless blabbing about

successes, when in fact they didn't exist, the

figures about how the USSR had passed the USA in

the production of butter and milk, when in the

stores they were available only infrequently.

endless promises of a better life when in fact

nothing of the sort is taking place.

All this

similarly forced me to re-evaluate not only the

events which were taking place in the country, but

already the entire ideology of the Party, its

external and internal course.

The events in Novocherkassk where 20,000 to

25,000 people rose up and the way in which this

popular indignation was suppressed by troops with

many casualties.

This also made a deep impression

When I was resting in the summer of 1961

in Nikolayev, from my relatives--my father's

brothers--I understood well the real relation of

the workers both to the leadership and to the .

Party as a whole. At the same time I saw how the

workers really lived, how they eat, what they have

and what they can buy with their wages.

I heard a great deal from my father about the

domestic policies of Khrushchev in regard to the

development and the course of construction in

industry, about his complete illiteracy in

engineering technology and industrial economics,

about incorrect decisions in regard to many

industries, and this was not only the opinion of

my father, but also of other important leaders in

various fields of industry. But no one dared to

open his mouth and when in

December 1955 my father

tried, as an engineer, to prove that a certain

decision would be incorrect, he received such a

rebuff from Khrushchev that

he was profoundly

shaken

and in the opinion of my mother

this brought

him to his illness and

death in August 1956.

The events in Germany and

especially in Hungary

showed with absolute clarity the bankruptcy of

communist ideology. What was especially important

for me was the fact that in these countries it was

protest not of individuals or groups, but of the

entire people who could no longer endure a regime

imposed

on them by force.: Here it is necessary. to

emphasize that the life of the people in these

countries was much better than that of the people

in the USSR. (I saw for myself how people live in

Czechoslovakia, in Germany, and beyond any doubt

they live better than the entire people of the

Soviet Union):

The split of the international Communist move-

ment became for me a clear fact and confirmed: my

opinion that the theory of Communism is a theory

built on sand and that it is practiced according to

the needs of the leadership.of

the Party at a given

stage of life and that in reality: full material

welfare would never be enjoyed by the people but

only by the

leadership and the Party and the

governmente

Working in the KGB I came to understand much and

became conscious of the contradiction between the

internal and external course of the USSR. Such

questions-as disarmament, the ban of atomic weapons,

the position of the USSR in the United Nations--all

these are used only in the interest of propaganda

and as

a screen for carrying out of the policies

needed by the communist party... (I was myself

present at the negotiations

in Geneva. and saw the

politicst of the

Soviet delegation.)

My trips abroad opened my eyes wide to the true

reality.

With my own eyes, I saw how people live,

how much they earn, how they can dress and live on

their

wage's,

and I paid special attention..to the

life

of ordinary people and not to that of scientists,

engineers,

etc.: And all the propaganda about the

enormous armies of unemployed in the countries of

the West, about the 'heavy exploitation', and the

'unbelievably difficult life' was immediately

dispelled.'. And what I met in my own work, how

which Soviet citizens get sent where abroad--this

finally debunked this propaganda.: Many of my KGB

acquaintances think back with great pleasure

about

life abroad.

I entered the Komsomol

completely without thinking

about it.

The time came, the right age, and

became a Komsomol member like all the others. It

was different in regards to the Party: I joined

the Party in- 1956 after the death of Stalin and

while I was working in the KGB and already at that

time there was

a lack of faith and indecisiveness

in me. My father continually insisted on this,

saying that without the Party I would never move

ahead and would not have success in life. But I

myself understood and saw that I would not be able

to work in the KGB unless I was a member of the

Party.

And if I worked somewhere else, I would

truly never move ahead in my career unless I entered

the Party.

But from the very beginning of my entry

into the Party, I deeply hated all the Party talmudism

and dogmatism.

All the Party meetings were literally

a torture.

Especially when I became the Deputy

Chief and then Chief of a section, and then Deputy

Chief of a department, because then I had to speak

at these

meetings.

Because this meant to lie, to

twist my

soul, and to attempt to show myself as

deeply dediçated to the Party and its course:

In 1960 my oldest girl's asthmatic attacks became

worse.

The question of a

change of climate was

raised. At that time the

Second Chief Directorate

needed to send an officer to Ethiopia for two to

three years to conduct counterintelligence work

among the Soviet specialists there.

It cost me a

great deal of effort to personally talk Second Chief

Directorate Chief General GRIBANOV into letting me

go.

The Party and work references had been confirmed,

all the questionnaires were already filled out, the

photos had been submitted; that is, all the formal-

ities had been accomplished. But at the very last

moment the Central Personnel Office of the KGB began

to protest against my going with my family to

Ethiopia.

The reason for this was

that from the

house check made at my place of residence they

received information that I

sometimes

came home in

a drunken condition and on this ground had quarrels

with my wife.

A tour abroad with my family was

necessary because of the health of my daughter

(since 1963 the illness has become better)

and also

it would have been advantageous from the financial

point of view.

From

this time on I understood that

Personnel would

not let me so abroad with my family:

Knowing many officers in the First (Foreign

Intelligence) Chief Directorate, "I began to under-

stand that being sent abroad is entirely determined,

not by knowledge, experience in work and success,

but only by the absolute 'cleanliness" of the

person's autobiography and complete assurance as to

his limitless dedication to the Party and the

government,

But not

only being sent abroad but the

assignment

of personnel in the First and Second

Chief Directorates.and the

entire KGB depends on

the reasons indicated by me and also on good relations

with the leadership and good connections with workers

in Central Personnel:

I lived about 11 years with my wife and our life

was not a hell. It is true that there were quarrels

and basically they boiled down to the fact that she

took an extremely unfavorable attitude towards my

delays at work and also when I would be delayed with

some of my friends and

acquaintances after work and

would. come home with a few drinks under my belt. Of

course, I

loved and love my children and only the

fact.

that

they are taken care of financially until

they grow up and have received an education to

some

extent consoled me in taking the decision to leave

the USSR. What do I have in mind when I speak of

financial security? After the death of my father,

the family received a

a large monetary allowance, plus

the money that my mother had saved and valuable

property, etc. My mother many

times offered to

divide all this in three parts; for me, my brother,

and for her, but I

suggested that we not do this

before her death.. And, of

course, my mother will

not leave my children without attention,

and my

share of

the property and the money will be given to

my children.

If the defections of (former KGB officers] PETROV,

RASTVOROV

and DERYABIN passed

without evoking any

particular thoughts, the defection to the United

States of GOLITSYN, whom I had heard of as an

intelligent person and a capable officer, undoubtedly

caused me to think very deeply. Because to act thus,

it is necessary to have not only boldness and

decisiveness, but also great strength of will. And

already I put to myself the question, will I be able

to act thus in view of the dissatisfactions and

disillusionments

which had accumulated inside of me?

Being in Geneva in 1962, not long before my

departure I myself of my own desire entered into

contact with you.

The reason for this was the loss

of money received by me for operational expenses.

I would have been unable to accumulate such a sum

money before my departure and there was nobody

to borrow from.

To tell the truth about the loss

of the money

would have meant that it would be

necessary to explain where and in what circumstances

it had been lost. This would have risked expulsion

from the KGB and a serious reprimand from the Party.

Not to tell the

truth,

to think up some sort of a

story--they wouldn't believe, and worst of all, they

might think that I had appropriated the money, that

is, stolen it. And this would be for me the worst

of

all and I would, of course, in such event have

told the truth.

To tell the truth, it was only after my return

home from Geneva in 1962 that I gradually, not

immediately, began full to realize all the seriousness

of my contact with you and its full meaning.

And

although I did not give you any promises or assurances

about our continued contact in the future, I under-

stood that you sooner of later would

set yourself

the task of continuing our contact.

here it was

that weighing up all the reasons and causes which I

have indicated above that in 1962 I took for myself

to leave the USSR at the first opportunity

and that I started to work towards being sent on

trip abroad.

Things were easier with the

because I was on good terms with the KGB officer:

who covered Switzerland, besides which when I came

back from Geneva in 1962 I had brought him a number

of presents:

tó the conclusion that here the Americans had been

helped by GOLIISYN. But at the same time the

First Chief Directorate was not completely sure of

this.

I began to feel afraid that the KGB would somehow

learn of my

contact with you. This article deeply

'interested' the KGB.

During 'the closed

trial of PENKOVSKIY I got a

pass from the Second

Department and went, in order

to look at him myself.

For sometimes it is enough

to simply look at a man, to see how he holds himself

and to hear how he speaks in order to form some sort

of an initial opinion of him.

Personally, I liked

how PENKOVSKIY held himself at the trial; I liked

his appearance and I understood that everything

which had been

said in the KGB about him and the

sort of person

they were trying to make him out to

be (that he was

morally degraded, that he had

descended and sunk into a swamp) that all this

was

nonsense, bluff, and chatter.

And PENKOVSKIY, the

confidence in the correctness of the decision taken

by me to leave the Soviet Union.

Soviet Officials' Statements About NOSENKO

cides markedly with NOSENKO's self-description.. According

to the comments of Soviet officials, principally intelli-

gence officers most likely to be speaking authoritatively,

defector NOSENKO was the son of the deceased Minister, he

served over a decade in the KGB, his personal shortcomings

were overcome

through the patronage of KGB General GRIBANOV,

and

in connection with operations against Americans he

occupied positions of progressively greater trust änd

responsibility, ultimately: becoming Deputy Chief of the

largest department in the key

Second (Counterintelligence)

Chief Directorate. According to these sources, his defection

wrought severe damage "for years to come" to the KGB

because of his knowledge

of KGB operations against American

targets, and his treachery

prompted: the expulsion and

disgrace of numerous senior KGB personnel,

the recall of

many others from

abroad, the virtual suspension of KGB

operations in the United States,

and extraordinary plans to

x418:

The Product of NOSENKO's Debriefing

Positive Intelligence Information

At his first meeting with CIA in 1962 NOSENKO asserted

that he was acquainted

with Ministers of the Soviet Govern-

ment, who were friends of his father, and he heard what

was said in their circles.

His debriefing and interroga-

tions did not bear out his

assertion that he was informed

of the attitudes and

aims of the Soviet leaders. His

responses to questions about the viability of the then

Soviet Government, for example, were couched in vague and

general terms and

did not reflect any specific knowledge.

From his debriefing it emerged that NOSENKO had spent his

entire adult life either

as a student or as a state

security

official, and he stressed

that since the early 1950's he

had had few interests

and "no real contacts"

outside of the

KGB itself.

Questioned on a wide range of topics, including

various aspects of nuclear weaponry, missiles, electronics,

communications, unconventional weapons, military industry,

military units and equipment, and

research and development,

NOSENKO repeatedly said that

he had no knowledge of such

matters and

that his responses reflected only personal

opinions.

Because of his two assignments to Geneva with

the Soviet Delegation to the Disarmament Conference, questions

were put to NOSENKO about Soviet underground

testing, Soviet

efforts in the fields of chemical and biological warfare,

Soviet disarmament aims and Soviet views of the corresponding

attitudes and intentions of the United States. Because

his assignments to the

Soviet Disarmament Delegation were

so ponding

for cover purposes only, NOSENKO disclaimed any special

knowledge.

He explained

that he took no part in the

substantive work of the Delegation nor did he have any

connection in the USSR with officíals or organizations

concerned with arms control or disarmament policies.

NOSENKO's failure to provide

any

useful positive

intelligence information was not unique, although previous

KGB defectors did not have NOSENKO's claimed access, either

on the basis of his family ties or on the basis of his KGB

counterintelligence position within the Soviet Union. KGB

officers who defected earlier to Western

services provided

no. significant military, economic or scientific information

on the USSR, and the political information provided by a

few (usually relating to the personalities and relationships

1n the ruling group of the Communist Party) was of marginal

value.

Counterintelligence Information

NOSENKO's knowledge of KGB foreign intelligence operations

was limited, for his whole career had been spent in the

Second Chief (Counterintelligence) Directorate concerned

with KGB operations within the Soviet Union.: His information

on Second Chief Directorate operations, however, was

apparently a counterintelligence windfall, because most of

his KGB assignments, involved operations against American

targets, either visitors to the Soviet Union or members of

the Embassy

staff

in Moscow. From this circumstance he

represents himself as an authoritative source on KGB success

and failure in recruiting Americans in the USSR during the

years 1953-1963°

NOSENKO has described scores

of

KGB operations

mounted

against American

Embassy personnel during that ten year

period. Because of lasting relationships he established

with KGB colleagues, NOSENKO kept abreast of KGB operations

against the Embassy, even while serving elsewhere than in

the Embassy Section. NOSENKO has

stated that he would

know if the facts were otherwise,

and he has asserted

unequivocally: that no American

stationed

permanently.at

the Embassy was recruited between the early 1950's and his

defection in 1964.

NOSENKO named six members of the Embassy

recruitment overtures, and all have

confirmed his assertions. He provided information on the

vulnerability of a significant number of Embassy personnel;

in particular, two Foreign Service Officers were consequently

withdrawn

from Moscow. Physical search has confirmed the

information he provided regarding the KGB audio surveillance

installations in the Embassy.

Among Americans other than Embassy. personnel whom NOSENKO

described as KGB targets, he provided information leading

to the identification of 51 KGB agents, including seven

correspondents in

Moscow, the Moscow representative of the

individual officers prominent in each. NOSENKO was not as

productive with respect to KGB operational methods and

of): the KGB position he held at the time.

not material to his claimed positions at various times in

the KGB,

they are summarized in Annex B.

but for reasons of brevity they are omitted from this paper.

Among the items of information which NOSENKO provided

but which do not relate to specific KGB positions he held

at particular times,

there are several which merit special

note here.

These, which

are among the most significant of

his revelations, are the leads to Sgt. Robert Lee JOHNSON,

"The KGB Agent in Paris"

-(Sgt. Robert Lee JOHNSON)

The first item of information given by NOSENKO

upon meeting CIA in Geneva in 1964 was a lead to a KGB

agent who was'an American serviceman stationed at a sensitive

U.S. military installation in the Paris area:

The agent had

been the source of documentary intelligence which had been

shown to Premier Khrushchev personally. Although still

active, the agent had lost access to classified documents.

some months earlier, in 1963. NOSENKO characterized the

lead as the most important

single counterintelligence item

that he acquired during the

year and a half he was a CIA

collaborator at KGB Headquarters in Moscow.

NOSENKO's Information

Shortly after returning to Moscow from Geneva in 1962,

NOSENKO first learned of a KGB agent's successful penetra-

tion of a classified documents vault at an

"important

American military installation" in the Paris area. Because

the documents included information on strategic targets in

France

as well as in the Soviet Union,

he assumed that it

was a "strategic planning installation".

The installation

had

its own airfield

that

there were "procedures for

bringing Iop Secret documents in and for taking them out".

There had been six successful entries of the vault, four

in 1962 and two in 1963.

On each occasion Special Section

technicians travelled TDY to Paris under diplomatic courier

cover to assist the local KGB case officer in the technical

details of the

operation.

Their function was to advise the

case officer concerning the entry to the vault and later

surreptitiously to unwrap

and re-seal the documents.

The

case officer, on this basis, would give appropriate instruc-

tions to his agent, and the technicians probably

never met

the American.

Although this was a First Chief Directorate operation,

officers of the Special Section of the Second Chief

Directorate were used.. The. Special Section was comprised

of technicians transferred from the KGB Operational-

Technical Directorate, and usually it handled

surreptitious

entries

to Western embassies in Moscow.

Among these officers

were S.A. IONOV, L.A. LEBEDEV, S.D. ILYIN, V.V. SINITSYN,

V.Z. KARETNIKOV, M.I. PREOBRAZHENSKIY and Fedor FOFANOV.

IONOV, LEBEDEV and ILYIN took part in this operation, and

FOFANOV was later involved.

The specialists were not the ones that carried out the

operation.

It was carried out by the

case officers of the

Paris Legal Residency. The specialists just opened and then

resealed the packages. LEBEDEV said that they also placed

some radioactive substance, with the help of the American

agent, in the lock of the vault door; when the substance was

removed, they could pick the lock.

They did the same thing

lused some radioactive substance] to the safe in the vault.

Before everything was finally ready, the Special Section

technicians had to visit Paris several times.

The first

time was the beginning of 1962.

The paris Residency couldn't

have launched the operation beföre 1962, because they

couldn't do it without the help of Special Section techni-

cians and the latter did not travel to Paris in 1960 or 1961:

Entry into the vault area was first achieved after the

agent used some radioactive substance to determine

the

combination. The agent also photographed the lock for KGB

study.

Subsequent entries were always made between two and

five

o'clock in the morning.. The agent removed documents

from

i the vault and delivered them to his KGB case officer,

who in turn passed them to Special Section technicians.

The envelopes were then opened, photographs were made,

the

documents were repackaged, and the envélopes were given

back to the case officer for return to the vault.

There'-

after, the Paris Legal Residency pouched the

films to Moscow',

and the technicians themselves left Paris until the next

opportunity for

entry

The KGB officers were able to complete the whole operation

during the agent's night duty. During this time, they had

to pick up the

materials, drive some place ("naybe the

Soviet Embassy") open the documents, photograph them, close

them again just as they were, and return them to the agent.

The KGB

could not specify which documents the agent was

to

bring out; the fact that all the documents had to be opened

shows that they were sealed when they were received from

the agent.

Since

he heard that almost all of the material obtained

was of interest to

the Ministry of Defense, NOSENKO concluded

that it came from a military installation. The agent couldn't

bring out a great. deal of material, only what he could hide

on his person.: From what the KGB technicians said, NOSENKO

thought the agent was not alone on duty. The technicians

said that "the agent explained Ito co-workers] that he is

going out for coffee or a sandwich", and that "he is gone

for only 5 or 10 minutes".

The last time the vault was entered

was in the fall of

1963.

At about that time the agent, a military man,

received a promotion and was relieved of his night watch

duties. (The agent was

scheduled for rotation to the

United

States but, with his promotion, he had obtained

an

extension until May 1964.) Although the agent was still

active in January 1964 and was still assigned to the same

military post,

he had lost access to the classified

documents. The information obtained from the agent's vault

was highly sensitive and so valuable to the KGB that the

Paris Legal Rezident as well as several case officers there

had been rewarded

i that here

for their part in the operation.

Before leaving Moscow for Geneva in January 1964,

NOSENKO had been told that the technician FOFANOV had been

sent to Paris in the KGB hope that the agent would be able

to re-enter the vault again before his transfer to the

NOSENKO learned of the case "in little pieces"

Directorate Special Section who participated in it,

principally LEBEDEV or KARETNIKOV in Moscow, and FOFANOV

later in París..

• [Under intensive questioning, NOSENKO has

also alleged he learned of the case

from IONOV, the Chief

of the Special Section.] NOSENKO explained that he knew

LEBEDEV and KARETNIKOV

from their visit to his office to

discuss technical installations at new tourist hotels, when

NOSENKO was Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department.

Comment:

NOSENKO's lead was identified as Army Sergeant

Robert Lee JOHNSON, who served in the period

1962-1963 at a military courier station at Orly

Field, Paris.

JOHNSON confessed to KGB

recruitment of himself and his wife, his

recruitment of James Allen MINTKENBAUGH, and

the latter's subsequent collaboration with the

KGB .

Mrs. JOHNSON

and MINTKENBAUGH have

corroborated JOHNSON's statements.

NOSENKO is apparently unaware of JOHNSON's

earlier (since 1952) involvement with the KGB

in Berlin,

the United States, and in Orleans,

France.

With respect to the

1962-1963

surreptitious entires of the

courier station

vault, however, JOHNSON!s admissions coincide

with the information provided by NOSENKO, with

no significant differences.

"SASHA" (KGB cryptonym. identity unknown)

When NOSENKO announced in Geneva in 1964 that he

was going to defect, he was told that as a consequence

additional persons

in CIA would be informed of his case

and he was asked to search his recollection for any

evidence of a KGB penetration of CIA.:

NOSENKO. knew.of

none in CIA, but he recalled a KGB agent,

; an American

known

as "SASHA"

, "who was a member of a U.S, military

intelligence organization.

NOSENKO's Information

NOSENKO learned'of

"SASHA" from M.A. SHALYAPIN; the KGB

officer who, while assigned to the Fiist Chief Directorate

and working in Berlin; recruited the agent in 1955-1957.

"SASHA"

who had been recruited by financial inducements,

had officer status; he wore civilian clothes to his meetings

with his KGB handler and he could have been either a

civilian or military intelligence officer.

"SASHA"

returned

to the United States

"in' the 1960's" or "in 1962".

"SASHA"

was stationed in the United States at the time of the Cuban

missile crisis but had been unable to provide the KGB any

relevant intelligence of

any significance. NOSENKO thought

that "SASHA" served as a department chief in intelligence

when he was re-assigned to Germany in November 1962 - early

1963.

NOSENKO met SHALYAPIN for the first time in September or

October 1962 lafter NOSENKO's first visit to Geneva and

initial contact with CIA] through his friend, Yu. I. GUK.

GUK had known SHALYAPIN when they had served together in

the First Chief Directorate in Moscow. SHALYAPIN had

served

in the United States, Uruguay, Berlin, and Cuba.

In

1962 he had been assigned

to the Latin American Department

of the First Chief Directorate, as a case officer.

retired from the KGB and through NOSENKO's intervention with

Second Chief Directorate Seventh Department Chief CHELNOKOV,

SHALYAPIN obtained a position with Inturist. Presumably

out of gratitude to NOSENKO, SHALYAPIN felt free to talk,

and over drinks he expressed his bitterness at his treat-

ment by the First Chief Directorate which, without him,

would

not have had the

agent

"SASHA" in Germany

"at that

time"

• [1963]: NOSENKO

heard

such details as he knew. of

"SASHA" in the course of several such talks with SHALYAPIN.

Under intensive questioning on the "SASHA" case NOSENKO

retracted his statement that he had first heard of the case

SHALYAPIN, though maintaining that he was sure he had

discussed :the case with SHALYAPIN

"at some time".

Pressed

to identify his first source, NOSENKO then cited

several

officers--some

First Chief Directorate, some Second-who

could have told him about it because they were likely to

know of it though none of them was actually involved in the

operation.

Ultimately NOSENKO refused to commit himself

on this point, saying

he did not remember from

whom he

"SASHA".

Comment:

"SASHA" has not been

identified.

William VASSALL ("KGB Agent in the British Admiralty")

Asked in the June 1962 meetings with CIA if he

was familiar with the case of George BLAKE, the former KGB

agent in MI-6, NOSENKO replied that he knew of another, more

important, KGB

agent who was employed in the British

Admiralty.

NOSENKO's Information

The KGB has/ now (in 1962) an

agent in a high government

position in London

who provides most valuable information,

some from NATO intelligence services' conferences.

The

agent was recruited in Moscow in 1956 or 1957 on the basis

of a homosexual compromise. In Moscow he was "a First

Secretary" or "chief of protocol" of the British Embassy.

After leaving Moscow he became

an assistant to the Minister,

or "something like that" in the Admiralty.

"He may be an

assistant, chief of the secretariat, but he's close to the

Minister.

All papers for the Minister go through him. He's

not an intelligence officer. He is

meeting with the KGB

now.

Several KGB officers received

the Order of Lenin for

their part in the operation, including the London Rezident

RODIN. NOSENKO learned

of the agent's existence, but not

of his identity, from his friend and colleague in the Second

Chief Directorate,

: VA. CHURANOV, who had made the recruit-

ment while chief of a section in the British Department.

agent who was

VASSALL's confession confirmed what NOSENKO

had reported. He had been recruited in Moscow

in 1955, after a homosexual entrapment, by two

KGB officers, one of whom he identified as

CHURANOV:

He continued to collaborate with

the KGB after returning to London,

first in

his job in the Admiralty Naval Intelligence

Division,

as clerical officer assistant to the

Civil Lord's private secretary, and finally,

as an employee in the secretariat of the Naval

staff.

In London he was- met by KGB officer

"KOROVIN" who has been identified as London

Rezident RODIN. VASSALL's last meeting with

the KGB in London was on 17 August 1962.

At

preparation for his next meeting on 30 October,

fifteen rolls of film containing 140 photo-

KGB Audio Attack on the West German] Embassy

In 1962 and 1964 NOSENKO reported on KGB microphones

concealed in several Western embassies in Moscow. Aside

from the American Embassy (see p. 25), he furnished the

greatest detail

- on the microphones in the West German Embassy.

NOSENKO's Information

The KGB was able to enter

surreptitiously every embassy

In Moscow, with the exception of the American and British

Embassies. It had been particularly successful with respect

Il to the West German] Embassy:

KGB microphones monitored the

I' West German Ambassador as

he dictated his reports or held

discussions with diplomatic colleagues, including American

Ambassador Thömpson.

The microphones

were operative during

the period 1959 through 1961, and the KGB monitored then-

as well as passages. of a book he was writing

NOSENKO learned of the KGB microphones either from

O.S. BUBNOV, Deputy. Chief of the Second Chief Directorate's

Third (Austria and Germany) Department, or Mikhail SKORIK,

Chief of that Third Department's First Section. In 1960-

1961 Tatyana GRISHNYAT brought from the Operational

Technical Directorate to NOSENKO in the American Embassy

Section dally monitoring reports from microphones in the

American Embassy.

On such occasions she had a much larger

volume of material addressed to the

Third Department, from

which NOSENKO

concluded that the KGB was even more successful

in monitoring the

¡West German Embassy than it was the

American

Embassy

Comment

NOSENRO's information was substantially correct.

Independent of that information, however, West ln

German authorities learned in 1963 that their

technical security officer in Moscow had been

recruited by the KGB.: They surmised that the

recruitment may have taken place as early as

1956•

In August 1964 the leader of

a technical

search

team: was

seriously disabled by mustard

gas poisoning; presumably at the hands of the

KGB.,

in 1965, finally, another search tear

completed a "tear down"

of the west German'll

Embassy, in the course

of which two separate

audio systems with 24 microphones were

found,

as

well as 27 microphones in the residence of

the Ambassador. In addition, evidence was

found indicating that the Embassy had been the

target of a sophisticated electronic attack

against its cipher machines and its acoustic

room.

NOSENKO's assertion that the KGB microphones

were operative in 1959 and his

sourcing of his

information to the periodic visits of Tatyana

GRISHNYAT to the American Section, are contra-

dictory.. NOSENKO claims he was not in the'

American Section until 1960.

"ANDREY". (Dayle W. SMITE)

When

contacting CIA in 1962 NOSENKO offered to sell

information about two KGB operaldles, one of which he knew

only under the KGB cryptonym

., a KGB agent recruited

in Moscow in 1949 or 1950 who in 1962 was working in

Washington "near ciphers"

NOSENKO's Information-1962

"ANDREY" was a U.S. Army sergeant who was

spotted for the

KGB by "QUEBEC" (Roy RHODES).

RHODES served in Moscow

from April 1951 to July 1953. He dated his own recruitment

by the KGB as January 1952.] RHODES was still in Moscow.

when "ANDREY" was recruited by the Second Chief Directorate,

although RHODES was

not aware of "ANDREY's" recruitment.

The KGB approach to

"ANDREY" was based on "women

and

money".

"ANDREY" worked satisfactorily in Moscow for the KGB,

providing "materials"

and information on ciphers.

promised that he would cooperate with the KGB in future

assignments abroad; but would not work with them in the

United States as he did

not want to "sit in the electric

chair". He was paid well for his cooperation in Moscow.

The KGB wanted to pay him more but he refused; he said he

could not plausibly explain the possession of too much

money. When the KGB offéred him diamonds and other gems for

later sale, he did not take them, telling his case officers

that possession could arouse the attention of the American

police.

In 1950. the agent left Moscow for the United

States.

The

KGB waited for him to reappear in some other

country, but he did not.

Finally, in 1955, the KGB

sent

V.M. KOVSHUK, the then-Chief of the American Embassy Section

of the Second Chief Directorate, and

a participant in

"ANDREY's"

recruitment in Moscow, to the United States to

find the agent.

KOVSHUK travelled under the alias "KOMAROV",

under the cover of either Second or Third Secretary of the

Soviet Embassy in Washington.

KovsHUk, with the help of the KGB Legal Residency in

Washington, learned where the agent was living,

identified

his automobile, and contacted him at the end of 1955 or

the beginning of 1956.

KOVSHUK had looked for him a long

time•

He found where

"ANDREY" parked his car, but "ANDREY"

lived in

a place where there were

many other people and it

was difficult to get close to him.

At first

"ANDREY" was

frightened and refused to work, but when at the third

contact he was offered $1,000;

the agent accepted the money

from KOVSHUK because, due

to his gambling, he was again in

financial straits. From that point on he worked well with

the KGB.. He again provided good information, information

considered important by

the KGB•

Whẹn KOVSHUK found him,

"ANDREY" was working in the Pentagon and he was still

working there in 1962.

In reference to his modus operandi for meetings

with

"ANDREY"

• KOVSHUK knew he was under surveillance by the

FBI.. His meetings always took place in cars. KOVSHUK

would lose his surveillance the day before the meeting and

travel outside of Washington where he would wait by the

highway; "ANDREY" would drive by and stop, KOVSHUK would

the American would drive on.

The KGB officer who compromised Rudolf Ivanovich ABEL

[Reino HAYHANEN, who defected in Paris in May 1957] also

provided the information leading to the arrest of Roy

RHODES. When RHODES was under investigation

"ANDREY"

was called as a witness because he had worked with RHODES

in Moscow.

"ANDREY" was the only such witness called,

and he was called upon several times to tell how RHODES

had behaved in Moscow. "ANDREY". could be identified as

the only person who testified at the trial.. During this

investigation of RHODES, "ANDREY" stopped meeting KGB

officers, because he was afraid he too would be exposed and

arrested.

"ANDREY"

may have feared that RHODES was involved

in his own recruitment, or he may merely have been panicky

because he knew

he could be accused of the same thing as

RHODES. Little by little, however, "ANDREY" resumed

his

meetings with

the KGB, "having little other choice"

KOVSHUK turned "ANDREY" over to a member of the Washington

Legal Residency and returned to Moscow.

NOSENKO did not

know who succeeded KOVSHUK as the handler, but KOVSHUK's

successor eventually turned the case over to N.G. BAGRICHEV,

who concluded his tour in Washington in 1961. NOSENKO did

not know BAGRICHEV's successor, but asserted

must have been one since. "ANDREY" was still working with

the KGB in 1962.

NOSENKO's Information-1964

While continuing to associate "ANDREY's" recruitment

with RHODES' presence in Moscow, NOSENKO in different

discussions of

in

"1948-1949", "in 1952 or earlier", or "in 1953".

recruited

"ANDREY" had been recruited by KOVSHUK and

N.M. BORODIN.

After returning to the United States, "ANDREY" worked at

the Pentagon,

"in codes", but by the.

time KOVSHUK recontacted

him in the United States

he was nearing the end of his

enlistment, and he was working In an Army recruiting office.

was not RHODES' trial at which "ANDREY" appeared, but

he was among persons called during the pre-trial investigation.

"ANDREY" was called just once, and he was scared to death.

"ANDREY" did not testify at the

RHODES trial.

..":

In Moscow, "ANDREY" had explained to the KGB how the code

machines in the Embassy worked and may have given the KGB

parts of code machines

as "discs

[sic, meaning

rotors).

Aleksandr SELEZNEV, a deputy

department chief in the

Communications Directorate of the KGB, had been involved in

the

"ANDREY" case:

NOSENKO first saw

him in 1953 during the

period that "ANDREY" was working for the KGB in Moscow.

SELEZNEV came to meetings in the American Department to

discuss and plan KGB meetings with "ANDREY".

reason for

SELEZNEV's presence was that the case officers were not

technical specialists, and SELEZNEV would supply them with

(FOUNDATIONS OF NOSENKO'S CLAIMS)

questions to be asked of "ANDREy"

• Since SELEZNEV came to

these

meetings in civilian clothes, whereas NOSENKO later

saw him in uniform in his visits to the American Department,

NOSENKO speculated that SELEZNEV may have attended some of

the meetings with "ANDREY". Although NOSENKO did not know

how the KGB exploited him, he repeatedly emphasized "ANDREY'S"

great importance to the KGB during the time he worked for

them in Moscow.:

"Thanks to his help. they were able to read

your State Department codes... To date we have never been

able to read your military codes..."

"ANDREY" brought no

military code material to the KGB; only State Department

material. Mainly, he described the operation of code machines

and

what daily or other periodic settings were made.

"ANDREY" supplied valuable material from the time that

the first recontact was made in

the United States until he

ceased meeting the KGB because of the RHODES trial.

Again,

after the trial, he was able to furnish good material. This

was true both while KOVSHUK was handling him and while

BAGRICHEV was the case officer. Between June 1962 and

January 1964, while NOSENKO was in Moscow, he heard that

"something is going wrong with this operation".

Comment:

"ANDREY" was identified as former U.S. Army

Sergeant Dayle W. SMITH, who served as a code

machine mechanic while assigned to the office

of the U.S. Military Attache in the

Embassy in

Moscow from April 1952 to April 1954.

headed counterintelligence."

NOSENKO went on to describe

the mounting of a blackmail operation, of which he was

the case officer, against SMITH (whose KGB cryptonym was

"RYZHIY"

, Or "REDHEAD").

SMITH had been sleeping with his Russian housemaid, who

was an agent planted on him by the KGB. When the KGB was

unable to obtain actual incriminating photographs,

she was

instructed to take photographs of herself on SMITH's bed.

These were then combined with photographs of SMITH to

produce photomontages, copies of which were delivered to

SMITH together with a letter inviting him to a meeting with

the KGB.

SMITH came. The KGB was represented at. the

meeting

by GRIBANOV, NOSENKO and one other officer. At

this initial meeting SMITH was not interrogated nor asked

for classified information. SMITH agreed to come to further

meetings.

(FOUNDATION OF NOSENKO'S CLAIMS)

When SMITH did not come to the next scheduled meeting

with GRIBANOV, NOSENKO sought out the

maid

to find

out what

had happened.

She reported

that SMITH was in a state of

desperate indecision; he had paced his room all night as

if his mood was alternating between despair and defiance.

To increase the pressure on

him, the KGB

sent him threatening

letters on each of

the succeeding three days. Finally, on

the third day, instead of meeting the KGB,

SMITH went

to

Ambassador BOHLEN

and reported

the blackmail attempt.

SMITH

was

immediately withdrawn from Moscow and (as of 1962) he

was

"still in intelligence work".

In 1964 and afterwards NOSENKO denied that he had played

any personal role in the case.

He explained that as

junior officer in the American Embassy Section at the time,

working on correspondents, he would not have taken part in

so important an operation.

He said that he had heard

about

the operation from V. M. KOVSHUK, SMITH's case officer.

(On a later occasion NOSENKO said

that his only personal

role was being assigned to a phone-watch

to receive

surveillance reports connected with the initíal KGB approach

to SMITH.)

GOLITSYN's Information

In February 1962 GOLITSYN reported that in 1957 he had

read

a two-volume KGB study which gave examples of successful

operations against the Embassy in Moscow.

One case concerned

an American, probably single, who was either the Security.

Officer or

the counterintelligence representative in the

Embassy.. He had a dog, and lived in an apartment in the

city or a country house outside Moscow. His Russian maid

The KGB concluded that

to ordinary blackmail and

consequently the maid, a KGB agent, was instructed to confess

to him that she

had been

recruited

by the KGB against her

will and would be arrested if she did not fulfill her KGB

tasks.

The American agreed to help her, and GOLITSYN believed

that he did not report

to his

Washington headquarters.

GOLITSYN also recalled that the American first supplied

only misinformation to the KGB, but when the KGB complained,

he provided

mixture of truth

and misinformation.

GOLITSYN

said the case study he read was based on a true incident

which took place between 1953 and 1957, but he was not sure

that the operation actually resulted in a successful recruit-

ment, as was alleged in the study.

Comment:

Edward Ellis SMITH (a redhead), Embassy

Security Officer (and CIA employee) from

July 1954 to June 1956, reported to the

Ambassador on 5 June 1956 that he had received

four letters from the KGB. The first,

received on 2 June 1956, enclosed incriminating

photographs of himself and his Russian maid and

requested him to come to a personal meeting

with KGB representatives outside the Embassy.

When he did not do so, SMITH subsequently had

received three threatening letters.

In

reporting

the matter to the Ambassador, SMITH

admitted having been intimate with his

Russian

maid.

SMITH was recalled from Moscow on

8 June 1956, and he left CIA employment a year

later.

When interviewed in March 1962 on the

basis of the GOLITSYN information, SMITH

admitted that he had maintained his

affair

with the Russian maid during most of the time

of his Moscow

assignment, 20 July 1954 to

8 June 1956, and

confirmed that to help her

he had in fact passed unclassified information

through her to the KGB for many months.

NOSENKO clearly ascribed the SMITH operation.

to the period when NOSENKO was in the

American

Embassy

Section, in 1953-1955. SMITH's state-

ment that he reported the blackmail

attempt to

the Ambassador in June 1956 is confirmed.

If

NOSENKO was; as he says, transferred to the

Seventh Department in 1955, he could not have

played

any role

in the KGB approach to SMITH.

If he played such a role, he was in the Embassy

Section in 1956, not in the Seventh Department

as he claims.

If he played a role in the SMITH

case as well

asin the Seventh Department

recruitment of BURGIj (see p. 115), it remains s

possible that he was neither

an

officer in the

Embassy Section nor Seventh Department

and was

acting in some other KGB capacity.

CHAPTER II

EXAMINATION OF NOSENKO'S BONA FIDES

What NOSENKO has said

about himself, the information

about the KGB which he has provided, and the apparently

corroborative statements

which Soviet officials have made

since his defection represent prima facie evidence that

NOSENKO is a former senior KGB officer.

To permit a

conclusive judgment that he is a bona fide defector, the

information NOSENKO provides about his life and related

persons and events must be coherent, and his accounts of

important events

must be consistent.

Allowing for personal

vagaries such as

lapses of memory and so forth, as well

as for factors of accident and coincidence, the information

he relates must conform within reasonable

limits with that

which is known from independent and reliable sources to

the United States Government about Soviet realities and

about the events, topics and individuals NOSENKO describes.

Lastly, the information NOSENKO provides must plausibly

relate primarily to the KGB positions he held, and his

account of how he functioned in these positions must be

substantiated by verisimilar detail.

The following portions of this paper, organized in

chronological fashion insofar as possible, summarize this

examination of the significant aspects of

NOSENKO's claims.

Notes for the Reader

In order to follow the examination as presented the

reader should note the following:

The examination tests the validity of the presumptive

evidence favoring NOSENKO in terms of coherence,

consistency,

and compatibility with fact and plausibility.

(EXAMINATION OF NOSENKO'S BONA FIDES)

Notes for the Reader (Continued)

NOSENKO's claims are judged in the light of his own

assertions and in comparison with collateral information.

It is not the function of the examination

to speculate

about possibly credible alternative explanations for the

paradoxes reflected in NOSENKO's statements, except when

such explanations are advanced by NOSENKO himself.

If there is no immediate explanatory note pointing out

the relevance or significance of some item in the text, the

reader may expect that the item's relevance or significance

usually will be developed in the immediately-following text.

Otherwise seemingly minor points are included because of

their aggregative significance:

they will be a matter of

comment in the Summary and Conclusions section following

each major portion of the examination.

Direct questions and NOSENKO's replies about his

contradictions, inconsistencies, ambiguities, retractions,

omissions and the like, are reflected in the

text. Where,

during his interrogations, it was not possible to

direct questions without furnishing NOSENKO information or

insight into the interrogators'

purposes, the topic was

covered exhaustively, if indirectly, and NOSENKO was

provided every opportunity to comment on the matter in

question.

When the text indicates that NOSENKO apparently

not asked about a particular matter, or that "hé didn't

, or "didn't comment" or "didn't indicate awareness".

so forth, the reader properly may assume that the

matter was covered

extensively.

In instances in which NOSENKO contradicts or retracts

earlier assertions, no more weight is necessarily given

to his final assertion

as opposed to earlier contrary claims.

To assist the reader in following what are sometimes

lengthy and complex accounts of events, NOSENKO's narrative

is broken from time to time by a clearly identified

editorial comment which seeks to

draw the reader's attention

to the relevance or significance of NOSENKO's assertions,

or to what conclusion is drawn.

At the end of each episode in NOSENKO's biography

CHAPTER III

PRE-KGB BIOGRAPHY

NOSENKO's biography from birth to entry into the KGB is

relevant to his bona fides insofar as it is material to

establishing his true identity, his general veracity, and

his eventual eligibility for KGB service.

Below are

summarized pertinent events in his early

life, his study

at the Moscow Institute of International Relations, and

his RU service, as reconstructed from statements he

volunteered as

well as from the accounts obtained in

repeated interrogations.

Birth to 1945 - NOSENKO's Account

NOSENKO was born on. 30 October 1927 in Nikolayev, in the

Ukraine.

At, the time of his birth, his father, Ivan

Isidorovich NOSENKO, was a shipyard mechanic and an evening

student at the Nikolayev Shipbuilding Institute.

Shortly

after NOSENKO began kindergarten in Nikolayev, in September

1934, his father graduated from the Shipbuilding Institute

and the family moved to Leningrad, where NOSENKO started

the First Class of school in September 1935. From 1935 to

1937 NOSENKO lived in Leningrad where his father was director

of a shipyard. In 1938 the elder NOSENKO became Deputy

People's Commissar of the Shipbuilding Industry and the

family moved to Moscow, where NOSENKO completed the Sixth

Class in June 1941 just as the war broke out.

NOSENKO has given two versions of his whereabouts for

the next two years.

In one, he said that on the outbreak

of hostilities he was enrolled in the Moscow Special Naval

School which was evacuated to Kuybyshev where he finished

the Seventh Class; thereafter he transferred to the Lenin-

grad Naval Preparatory School (which had been evacuated

to

(PRE-KGB. BIOGRAPHY)

Baku), where he finished the Fighth Class in spring, 1943.

In a second version Imore probable since entry to the Moscow

Special Naval School required prior completion of the

Seventh Class] NOSENKO said that when the war broke out he

and his mother were evacuated to Chelyabinsk, where he

completed the Seventh Class in summer of 1942.

They returned

to Moscow afterwards, and NOSENKO was then enrolled in the

Moscow Special Naval School (then in Kuybyshev) where he

completed the Eighth Class in 1943; in the fall of 1943

NOSENKO was enrolled in the Leningrad Naval Preparatory

School (then in Baku).

After just six months in Baku, without completing the

Ninth Class, NOSENKO ran away from school and returned to

MOscow.

Comment: NOSENKO has asserted variously that he ran

away and fought

on the front at Tuapse, and

that he had finished the Tenth Class in Baku

and then spent the period 1943-1945 at the

Frunze Higher Naval School, the equivalent of

Annapolis. He has retracted both assertions.

NOSENKO completed the Ninth Class in June 1944 at the

Moscow Mining Institute, and when the Leningrad Naval

Preparatory School returned to Leningrad from Baku, he

resumed his studies there.

Early in 1945, however, NOSENKO

received a gunshot wound in the hand, and

after being

hospitalized for a month, he left the Naval school.

(PRE-KGB BIOGRAPHY)

NOSENKO completed the Tenth Class at the Leningrad Ship-

building Tekhnikum in June 1945, and he successfully passed

the necessary examinations to qualify him for entrance to

the Moscow Institute of International Relations that summer.

Birth to 1945: Summary and Conclusion

NOSENKO is virtually the sole source of information on

his early life.

However, this portion of his claimed

biography is consistent with the NOSENKO family's where-

abouts

as publicized in press accounts at the time of his

father's death in 1956, and with the existence

of the

schools he claims to have attended.

Allowing for exaggerated claims of boyhood heroics

netracted are interrogation, NoSEN

and the substance of his claims about his life until 1945

are accepted as true.

Attendance at the Moscow Institute

ef International Relations (1945 - ca. 1950)

In all of his accounts, NOSENKO has. stated that he entered

the Institute's Faculty of International Law and English in

September 1945. He completed his first year in spring 1946.

NOSENKO Claim

In 1947, on completion of his second year at the Institute,

NOSENKO claims he received a commission as a junior lieutenant

"in the reserves"; he does not recall in what arm he received

a commission, other than being sure that it was not in the

Navy •

higher institutions are commissioned, but in

At that time they receive their voyennyy

assigned MOS and category (sostav) • CIA interro-

gators were unable to resolve why NOSENKO

pleaded ignorance on this matter, and concluded

it may relate in some manner to his claims to

subsequent commissioned service in the Navy.

In 1947, also, NOSENKO married the daughter of a Soviet Army

Lieutenant General, Augustina K. TELEGINA "just after" her

father had been arrested in connection with Stalin's campaign

against Marshal Zhukov's associates.

NOSENKO recalls neither

the date of that marriage, in what

occurred, nor how long after her father's arrest.

(The

significance of this first marriage lies in NOSENKO's contra-

dictory statements about when

and how he obtained his divorce.

(PRE-KGB BIOGRAPHY)

NOSENKO has said at various times that the Institute

course was of four years'

duration and that he entered

the

Naval RU on graduation in 1949; that it was four years'

duration and that because he failed a state examination

he

was graduated later, in 1950; that it was of five years'

duration and he graduated in 1950, on schedule; and that it

was of five,years' duration but he failed an examination

which delayed his graduation for

three months.

Comment: See p.367 for report that NOSENKO joined the KGB

upon graduation from the Institute in 1947.

The duration of the Institute course and

the

date of NOSENKO's completion are materiai to

the plausibility of his claimed Naval RU service,

which he said followed almost immediately upon

his departure from the Institute.

Naval RU Service (ca. 1951 - ca. 1953)

NOSENKO claims that upon completion of his studies at

the Institute of International Relations he entered the

Naval RU, serving in the Far East and then in a Baltic post,

finally successfully "transferring" to the KGB through the

intervention of his father's friend, KGB General KOBULOV.

(PRE-KGB BIOGRAPHY)

The significance of NOSENKO's RU service is the fact

that he claims it launched his intelligence career and

served as the means through which he secured appointment

to the KGB after once having been rejected... The two or more

years he claimed to have served in the RU represent a

significant perioa of his adult life for which he should

have no difficulty accounting. Finally, the date of his

actual transfer from the Naval RU to the KGB is critical to

determining the time from which his claims about kgB service

can be judged credible.

NOSENKO volunteered extensive comment on his Naval RU

service

at his first meetings with CIA in 1962. After his

1964 defection, it was the topic on which he made one of

his initial retractions

and his first admission that he had

earlier made a false claim. The subject of his Naval RU

service was consequently prominent in interrogations

in

1964, 1965 and

1966.

However, throughout these interrogations,

challenges of his assertions about his RU service prompted

adjustments in his claimed date of graquation from

the

Institute or claimed date of entry into the KGB, just as

challenges on those latter topics prompted amended state-

ments with respect to his RU service.

The extent of the

still-unreconciled discrepancies and contradictions in

NOSENKO's various accounts is best perceived in comparison

of his statements made in 1962, 1964, 1965 and 1966

In summer 1952, again eligible for duty,.

NOSENKO was offered an assignment to the Military-Diplomatic

Academy, but he rejected the opportunity because the

curriculum was almost identical to that of the Institute

from which he was graduated.

In summer 1952 NOSENKO was ordered to the Baltic city of

"the former German city of Pillau". (Baltiysk, a

larger city close by Primorsk, is the former German city of

Pillau.]

There NOSENKO was involved in the formation of

"agent-observation posts", in which candidates from among

Soviet seamen were formed into three-man teams and trained

as stay-behind agents in the event of war.

In early 1953,

after less than six months in the Baltic assignment, NOSENKO

returned on leave to Moscow where he met at his father's

dacha KGB General KOBULOV, First Deputy to then-MGB [KGB]

Chairman Beria.

KOBULOV, on finding that NOSENKO did not

care for his RU assignment, invited him to consider joining

the KGB.

NOSENKO's Information-1964

Prior to NOSENKO's graduation he had been tentatively

assigned by the Institute's military commission to the RU,

and on the instructions of the Institute's "secret unit", he

was interviewed by a RU Colonel KALOSHIN at the RU Personnel

Department. After passing the state examination on the

second try, NOSENKO entered the Navy in September 1950, when

he received orders calling him to active duty as a junior

lieutenant.

He also: received orders assigning him to the

Intelligence Staff of the Seventh (Far East) Fleet. He

left Moscow approximately 1 October 1950, travelling for

ten days by train to his unit, which was

stationed near

Sovetskaya Gavan'. He was there assigned to a Reports

Section with duties which included translating American

naval publications and making summaries of Order of Battle

information of American naval forces in the Far East.

radio signals intercept unit was connected with NOSENKO's

unit, but [contrary to what he asserted in 1962 and 1965] he

was not personally concerned with that unit's activities.

In spring 1951 NOSENKO was promoted to the rank of

lieutenant.

At the end of 1951 NOSENKO was assigned as an

"apprentice" in the Agent-Intelligence Section near

Sovetskaya Gavan', an assignment which involved subchaser

delivery and pickup of agents from Hokkaido and Sakhalin.

In early 1952 NOSENKO filed by mail for divorce from

TELEGINA in a Moscow court. In April 1952 he returned to :

MOSCOW on

leave, where he visited the Naval RU Headquarters

personnel officer, Col. KALOSHIN, and requested

..a transier

from the Far East. During May and June 1952 he was on

leave accrued during his two years' service in the Far

East.

Following his leave, in summer 1952, NOSENKO was

ordered to proceed to Rostock but he refused and took

unauthorized leave.

He could not learn what his actual

assignment

was to be in Rostock, and he heard that the Naval

Intelligence Points in Germany were being closed down.) He

subsequently was assigned to the Baltic city of Baltiysk,

where he reported for duty with the Intelligence Staff of

the Fourth (Baltic) Fleet.

He was assigned to a Naval

Intelligence Point being set up in Sovetsk (sic, see p. 57),

a small town.

"in Primorskiy Kray" near Baltiysk.

Comment:

Primorskiy Kray is in the Far East, as NOSENKO's

interrogators pointed out to him at the time.

NOSENKO subsequently claimed it was his earlier

post, Sovetskaya Gavan', which was in Primorskiy

Kray, a fact known to him from the way his

letters were addressed.: This is also an ercor.

See below

In Sovetsk NOSENKO prepared training materials for agents.

Comment::

NOSENKO also said that after refusing to go to

Rostock he himself had received training in

Moscow and then was sent to Rostock and Sassnitz,.

Comment: (Continued)

in East Germany, before going to Baltiysk.

In

retracting that claim, he explained that he

knew his CIA interrogators would not believe

that he had successfully refused the assignment

in Germany•

In August or September 1952 NOSENKO returned to Moscow

for 7 to 10 days to complete the divorce proceedings which

he had initiated in the Far East.

This was not regarded

as leave,

but official business.

He afterwards returned

to Sovetsk, but he did not like his work there, and in late

1952. he requested leave to return to Moscow to seek a transfer.

When his unit commander refused him leave, NOSENKO appealed

to Admiral GOLOVKO in Baltiysk, and because of the elder

VOSENKO's influence, was able to return to Moscow for a month's

leave in January. 1953.

At the end of January NOSENKO visited

the RU Personnel Officer, KALOSHIN, and stated his distaste

for his work.

KALOSHIN

told him to

"look around"., and

NOSENKO spent February 1953 "at the disposal of the Personnel

Department", not doing anything. Since he wasn't working,

he didn't receive his pay, and he lived with his parents.

Comment:

Just before giving this account of his January

1953 leave, NOSENKO claimed that he spent

January and a part of February at the Kubinka

Sanitorium. He has never reconciled these two

statements•

NOSENKO's Information-1965

Prior to his graduation from the Institute, a military

commission tentatively assigned NOSENKO to the Navy, after

which he visited a special section at the Naval Ministry

to file special forms for a security check. Although nothing

was said at the time, NOSENKO

believed then that he was slated

to join Naval Intelligence.

After passing all of his

examinations, in the fall of 1950 NOSENKO received orders

calling him to active duty Offered a choice of assignments,

NOSENKO chose the Far East "to prove that he was now ready

to make a man of himself". Arriving in Sovetskaya Gavan' in

Primorskiy Kray (sic) , NOSENKO was assigned to a Reports®

Section.

Comment: Questioned in 1965 on the location of Sovetskaya

Gavan', NOSENKO insisted that it was located in

Primorskiy Kray•

Shown contemporary Soviet maps

clearly locating it in Khabarovskiy Kray!

NOSENKO angrily asserted that the map had been

falsified by his interrogators to confuse him.

NOSENKO's contention is somewhat analogous to

being stationed in Oregon for an extended:

period and thinking oneself to be in California.

In Sovetskaya Gavan' NOSENKO liked the work and did a

good job despite rigorous working and living conditions,

and during his service there he was commended as an out-

standing officer. NOSENKO and his officer colleagues

analyzed the product of some 300 radio intercept operators

as well as information received from Sakhalin and Vladivostok.

In spring, 1951,

after about seven months' service,

NOSENKO was promoted to lieutenant, the normally reguired

time in grade of one year having been reduced to six months

for Far East service.

In early 1952 NOSENKO published in a local newspaper his

intent to divorce his wife, and he forwarded the necessary

legal papers to Moscow:

NOSENKO's two-year tour would not end until October or

November 1952, nor was he entitled to any leave before that

time.

An understanding superior, however, arranged for him

to take leave in April 1952 so that he could return to

Moscow in time for his father's birthday on 1 May. On ? May

he reported to the Naval Ministry and was told to return

for reassignment at the end of his leave.

NOSENKO was on

leave in May and June 1952, and he remained "at the disposal

of the Naval Ministry".

[According to his 1962 and 1966

versions, he was hospitalized during this period.]

In the summer of 1952 NOSENKO was offered assignments to

them all down.

He rejected the opportunity to attend the

academy, because he had had almost all of the courses

earlier at the Institute of International Relations.

"Sometime after his return to Moscow from Sovetskaya

Gavan'

"" NOSENKO completed the formalities to secure his

divorce from TELEGINA.

(According to his 1964 account,

NOSENKO visited Moscow later, from his Baltic assignment,

to complete divorce proceedings. I

In August 1952 NOSENKO received an assignment to Sovetsk,

in the Baltic, where he arrived in early September 1952.

His assignment there was as a political officer, in which

capacity he was involved with sailors being trained for

wartime sabotage missions. His main task was to prepare the

training plan for the agents, to instruct them in such

subjects as

"The Foreign Policy of the USSR", and generally

to see to their needs.

NOSENKO did not care for his

assignment in Sovetsk and in December. 1952 he obtained leave

to spend the holidays with his parents in Moscow.. In January

1953 NOSENKO and his parents visited KGB General KOBULOV

at the latter's dacha and KOBULOV, learning of NOSENKO's

dissatisfaction with the RU, suggested he consider working

for the KGB.

NOSENKO's Information-1966 (April)

At an interview with the military placement commission

at the Institute before graduation,

NOSENKO indicated that

he wanted to work in "some sort of a military organization"

Soon thereafter the chief of the Institute's special section

gave him a telephone number to call. NOSENKO recognized the

number as one belonging to the MGB [the predecessor of, and

hereafter referred to, as, the KGB]. NOSENKO was invited to

an interview with KGB officials who queried him about his

background and his knowledge of English.

Later, however,

the chief of the Institute's special section informed

NOSENKO that his qualifications were unsuitable for assign-

ment to the KGB:

During the summer of 1950 "while state

examinations were underway"' lin earlier versions NOSENKO

claimed

the examinations were over in Junel, NOSENKO began

to process for entry into the Naval RU, through Colonel

KALOSHIN, the Chief of the RU Personnel Department. He

filled out

questionnaires in duplicate, wrote two auto-

biographies and, in August or September, submitted copies

of his diploma.

Note that this version of events omits

any reference to delayed graduation caused by his having

to take a state examination a second time.]

For the next

nine months, until March 1951, NOSENKO awaited being called

to RU service.

[In earlier versions, NOSENKO claims he

entered the RU in 1949

or 1950.]

On 12 March 1951 NOSENKO received two orders from the

Naval Ministry, one calling him to active Naval service and

the other assigning him as a translator to the Intelligence

Unit of the Seventh Fleet in the Far East.

On 13 March,

on KALOSHIN's instruction, NOSENKO reported to the Moscow

City Military Commission and was issued his travel documents,

and NOSENKO departed Moscow for

his post on 16 or 17 March.

At the end of March NOSENKO arrived at his post near

Sovetskaya Gavan' and began work in the Reports Section of

the Seventh Fleet Intelligence Unit.

At the end of April 1952 NOSENKO left Sovetskaya Gavan'

on

leave, arriving in Moscow on 28 April. Note earlier

versions in which he was transferred because of illness.

and that he was permitted to return to Moscow because of

his father's birthday.] While on leave he became ill with

tuberculosis and spent almost two months in May and June.

1952 in a sanitorium near Moscow.

During the month of July 1952 NOSENKO was ordered to

the Naval Intelligence Point of the Fourth (Baltic) Fleet

in Sovetsk, in Kaliningradskaya Oblast (at the head of the

Bay of Gdansk).

Sovetsk was a small village located on

the spit of land between Kaliningrad and Baltiysk.

only Sovetsk in Kaliningradskaya Oblast is located many

miles inland from Kaliningrad, in the opposite direction

from Baltiysk.

When NOSENKO was shown their locations on

contemporary Soviet maps, he insisted that he was correct,

although Primorsk, where

NOSENKO had said in 1962 that he

was

assigned while in the Baltic, is located on a spit of

land between

Kaliningrad and Baltiysk.] NOSENKO remained

in "Sovetsk" but a short time, and he

returned to Moscow

at the end of 1952 to seek another assignment. Before

his departure he was promoted to the

rank of lieutenant

of the Administrative Service.

[In previous versions he

claimed to have become eligible for promotion and was

promoted while in the Far East, after less then a year's

service.1

On 1 January 1953 NOSENKO and his parents were guests at

the KOBULOV dacha. NOSENKO indicated his dissatisfaction

with his RU assignment and KOBULOV promised to find him a

place in the KGB.

From the middle of January to the middle of March 1953

NOSENKO was under treatment at the sanitorium near Moscow

where he had been hospitalized in 1952, and there he became

acquainted with his second wife, Lyudmila Yulianovna

KOZHEVNIKOVA.

[NOSENKO's earlier accounts either omitted

reference to this period of hospitalization, or indicated

that it was of considerably shorter duration.]

NOSENKO's Information-1966 (October)

In his most recent account, in October 1966, NOSENKO

said that before graduation from the Institute

the military

placement commission sent him to the KGB, but there he was

told that

he was not qualified as a candidate because of

mediocre academic record and drinking habits. NOSENKO said

he did not mention this rejection earlier, because his

interrogators would not have beljeved that he ever became

a KGB officer after once being rejected.

NOSENKO also volunteered that he had "lied"

when he

claimed to have entered the Naval RU in 1950. In fact,

he said, he entered the RU in March 1951 and was on active

duty in the Far East from 1951 until 1953.

Comment:

This

latest assertion discredits almost all

of his earlier claims regarding entry into

the RU, including the date of his graduation

from the Institute, the timing if not the

fact of his promotion, the number, sequence,

and purposes of his visits to Moscow, his

hospitalization with tuberculosis, and his

assignment to the Baltic Fleet.

Naval RU Service: Summary and Conclusion

According to NOSENKO's contradictory statements, which

are

still unresolved after interrogations over a three-

year period, he graduated from the Institute of International

Relations in

either 1949 or 1950. Before graduation, he

(a) was selected for Naval assignment,

(b) sought a Naval

assignment,.or (c).

was selected for and rejected by the

KGB and then he sought an assignment to the RU; or,

immediately following graduation, or three months or nine

months later (in the following year), he was called to

active Naval service and

assigned to the RU.

With neither

training nor indoctrination he was assigned initially to

the Far East for nine months or three years; there he

participated in agents' operational training, or reports

In the latter capacity he was or was not involved

in RU radio signals intercept operations.

He either never

served in the Baltic. or, if he did, it was for three

months or six months, during which

he either participated

in agent training or

was an administrative or political

officer. He was promoted to lieutenant in the Far East

or in the Baltic, after either seven months' or thirteen

months' RU service.

Despite his claimed active commissioned service in the

Navy. NOSENKO knows nothing of Soviet Navy tradition,

doctrine, organization, or procedures. He disctaims

know-

RU organization other than at the posts where he

served, "because of his junior rank". However, even at

those posts he describes neither the staff, the functions

nor the personnel intelligibly nor does he describe the

posts"

actual locations.

The sole Headquarters RU officer NOSENKO identified was

the personnel chief, Colonel KALOSHIN..: He identified no

ranking officers in either the Baltic or Far East intelli-

gence staffs.

Some thirty GRU officers he did identify,

by his own admission; NOSENKO knew not from his Naval RU

service, but through social acquaintance, later, in Moscow,

or through his visits to Geneva.

Conclusion

NOSENKO did not serve in the Naval RU in any of the

capacities at the places and times he claimed.

CHAPTER IV

KGB ENTRY

Comment:

Stalin died in March 1953, an event which was

accompanied by extraordinary repercussions

The Ministries of Internal Affairs (MVD) and

State Security (MGB) merged under the MVD, Of

which Beriya became Minister. There followed

a period of widespread reorganization entailing

the transfer or dismissal of many personnel:

Beriya's arrest just four months later in June

1953 was followed by another extensive (if

and Evdokia PETROV, Yuri RASTVOROV, and Petr

DERYABIN, among others, defected in the wake

of these events. From information they pro-

vided, as well as from

l that acquired from other

sources, CIA has a substantial amount of infor-

mation against which NOSENKO's accounts of this

period may be weighed.

For the convenience of the reader, the term

"KGB" is used hereafter to refer as

well to its

predecessor organizations in 1953-1954.

In statements volunteered in his early meetings with CIA

in Geneva in 1962, NOSENKO mentioned that he had joined the

MVD/KGB in 1953. In a biographic statement written immediately

after his defection, however, he asserted his KGB service

began in 1952, a date he insisted was correct even

reminded he had earlier said 1953.

Repeated interrogations

produced a variety of dates of claimed KGB entry, ranging

from

"the beginning of 1952" to April 1953, all of which

were accompanied by modified accounts of the circumstances

of his entry (as well as of his earlier period of service.

in the Naval RU and of his date of graduation from the

Institute of International Relations) •

To the extent to

which he has been consistent at all, he has cited March 1953

as the time of his entry to the KGB.

Date of Entry

NOSENKO at his first meeting with CIA in Geneva in 1962,

volunteered how and when he joined the KGB. NOSENKO hao

just returned from his Naval RU assignment in the Baltic,

said, when he met KGB General KOBULOV and KOBULOV urged

him to join the KGB. NOSENKO stated that after completing

his processing, he reported for

duty in the Embassy Section

of the Second Chief Directorate's American Department in

March 1953,

"just after Stalin died". (Stalin died on

5 March 1953.)

Comment:

According to KGB defectors, the precise date

of entry to the KGB would not likely to be

forgotten by a KGB officer.

The date is the

basis for computing length of service and is

a common entry on KGB administrative forms

periodically filled out by KGB officers in the

course of their service.

According to NOSENKO in January 1964, he transferred to

the KGB from the Naval RU "in something like 1952"; "just

after Yu. I. GUK transferred from the Second Chief Directo-

rate"

Comment:

GOLITSYN had reported that GUK was transferred

out of the Second Chief Directorate in January

1952.

In February 1964 NOSENKO wrote a biographic statement in

which he noted that he entered

the KGB in 1952, and in which

he back-dated by one year his 1962 account of his activities

in the period 1945-1955. Although he was then reminded of:

his 1962 statement and the contradiction was discussed with

him, after study he indicated his approval by signing an

official biographic statement (for the Intelligence Community)

which indicated that he entered on duty with the KGB in

about May 1952:

At the first hostile interrogation in April 1964, NOSENKO

was

confronted with his contradictory claims. In response,

NOSENKO stated that he returned to Moscow from the Baltic in

August 1952 by most of his other accounts,

NOSENKO returned

in January 1953] and entered the KGB on 5-7 September 1952.

By March 1953, NOSENKO stated, he had already worked in the

Embassy Section for some months against American correspon-

dents, and it was "just after Stalin's death, after the

reorganization". that' he

assumed responsibility for operations

against American Army Attache personnel.

[NOSENKO ultimately

settled on June or July 1954 as the time of this reassignment.

See p. 84.]

Challenged in April 1964 to resolve the contradictions of

his earlier claims that he joined the KGB variously in

January 1952, September 1952, or March 1953, NOSENKO

asserted that the truth was that his service dated from March

1953, after Stalin's death. He

finished his Institute studies in 1949 (sic),

went on to explain that he

"defended his

diploma" and then failed one of the four required State

examinations. All four examinations, he said, he had to

take over again, and as a result he didn't receive his diploma

until 1950 although he "officially" graduated in 1949.

NOSENKO said

that to avoid admitting

"this unpleasant thing"

he claimed he joined the KGB in 1952 and after claiming that

again,? fact, "did not want to correct it, to twist it around

NOSENKO went on to say that the actual date of entry

was while Stalin was still alive, on "12 or 15 March 1953"

or about 15 March 1953.

then-MVD. NOSENKO said that when KOBULOV learned of NOSENKO's

dissatisfaction with the Naval RU, KOBULOV encouraged him

to enter counterintelligence and invited him to visit the

General's office. : NOSENKO said he did not, but nevertheless

received a week later a telephone call from the KGB Personnel

Office asking him to appear at the secretariat of General

king him to a

KOBULOV and informing him that General KOBULOV had already

arranged for a building pass.

NOSENKO gave an this version, he first met KOBULOV, a

somewhat more detailed account

friend of the NOSENKO family, in February 1953. NOSENKO said

KOBULOV had visited his father in the latter's office, and

that evening the elder NOSENKO brought him to the NOSENKO

dacha to spend the weekend. [NOSENKO had just before been

informed by his interrogators that KOBULOV was at that time

posted

in Germany, not in Moscow.]. According to NOSENKO,

KOBULOV was in Moscow on a short visit from Germany. : "My

father invited him to spend Saturday night and Sunday...On

Sunday we were playing billiards

and KOBULOV asked me what

I was doing, and I told him I was at the disposal of the

(Naval RU) Personnel Department and that I didn't want to

return to the Baltic."

NOSENKO said that KOBULOV offered

to call the KGB Personnel Office and have them "look

NOSENKO over", and NOSENKO assented, after which he twice

visited the Personnel Office where he filed completed forms.

NOSENKO asserted that KOBULOV did not forget, because "just

as soon

as STALIN died; KOBULOV imnediately returned from

Germany" after being "summoned by Beriya or someone", and

on "maybe the

l0th of March" NOSENKO received a call from

KOBULOV's assistant.

NOSENKO claimed he reported to KOBULOV's

office;

although he waited two hours to see the General,

the latter was busy elsewhere. Instead of seeing KOBULOV,

however, NOSENKO said he was finally taken to the office

of Second Chief Directorate Deputy Chief SHUBNYAKOV, who

assigned him forthwith to the Embassy Section of the American

Department.:

In April 1964 NOSENKO introduced a new variant. He said

that he met KOBULOV while accompanying his parents on a

visit in January to KOBULOV's dacha [NOSENKO had previously

graphically described KOBULOV's weekend visit at the elder

NOSENKO 's], KOBULOV intervened in his behalf, and he was

called to the KGB Personnel Office to be interviewed and

receive necessary forms. NOSENKO stated that he heard

nothing further until after Stalin's funeral, wien he was

summoned to KOBULOV's office and afterwards assigned to

the Second Chief Directorate.

During the July 1965 interrogations NOSENKO retracted

his earlier claim that KOBULOV and his father had been close

personal friends. He stated that his father's relationship

with KOBULOV was not personal, and that KOBULOV had never

visited the NOSENKOs.

In a biographic statement written in April 1966, NOSENKO

said that he had met KOBULOV but twice, once on 1 January

1953 at the latter's dacha, and the second and last time in

the elder NOSENKO's office as NOSENKO's father and KOBULOV

were departing to attend Stalin's funeral.

On that latter

occasion, NOSENKO clained, KOBULOV promised to concern him-

self with NOSENKO's entry into the KGB and it was several

days later that NOSENKO was summoned to KOBULOV's office

and told ie was appointed to the KGB.

Comment:

General Bogdan Zakharovich KOBULOV was a career

security official, but from the immediate post-

war period until after Stalin's death he was

not assigned to KGB Headquarters. As of 1952,

he was posted to Germany with the Chief

Directorate of Soviet Properties Abroad, then

directly subordinate not to the MVD but to the

Council of Ministers and latterly to the

Ministry of Foreign Trade.

Until he returned

from Germany in March 1953 to assume the

position of Beriya's deputy, he had no office

In KGB Headquarters. KOBULOV was arrested

with Beriya in June 1953, and also later executed.

In light of the foregoing, it is improbable

that KOBULOV was instrumental in NOSENKO's

appointment to the KGB at the times NOSENKO

claimed.

If KOBULOV ever interceded in

NOSENKO's behalf, it is probable that NOSENKO

would later have

been purged after KOBULOV's

Comment:

(Continued)

and Beriya's arrest and execution:

NOSENKO's

eventual retraction of his assertion that his

father and KOBULOV were intimate acquaintances

makes it the more unlikely that KOBULOV played

any role at any time in NOSENKO's appointment

to the KGB.

Eligibility

Throughout the various versions NOSENKO has provided

about his entry to the KGB, he has emphasized how influen-

tial was his father's prominent position in the Soviet

Government.

Comment: In the period 1953-1954, during which NOSENKO

claimed he entered the KGB, it was KGB policy

to avoid recruiting the children of senior

Soviet officials.

NOSENKO asserts that he was rejected for KGB appointment

upon graduation from the Institute of International Relations.

Comment: Other than claiming to have completed an

undistinguished period of service with the Naval

RU, NOSENKO acknowledges thät he was no möre

eligible in 1953 for KGB appointment than he

was at the time of his rejection.

NOSENKO states that in March 1953 he was already twenty-

five and a half years old, a member of only the Komsomol,

and that he had not been recommended for Party membership.

He further claimed that. on entry to the KGB he became

secretary of

the Second Chief Directorate Komsomol organi-

zation.

Comment: Eligibility for Party membership, if not

membership itself, is a requisite for KGB

appointment. By Komsomol statutes of that time,

twenty-five was at that time the maximum age.

Thus, at the time of NOSENKO's claimed KGB

appointment, he was within six months of being

dropped by the Komsomol as well as still

unqualified for Party membership. He could

not have been secretary of the Second Chief

Directorate Komsomol organization, as discussed

on p. 338.

NOSENKO has referred frequently to having contracted

tuberculosis for which he was periodically hospitalized.

Comment:

According to KGB defectors

familiar with the

standards in force at the time, no candidate

was

accepted who had ever had tuberculosis.

KGB Processing for Entry

NOSENKO has stated (in chronological order) that at his

initial interview with a KGB personnel, it was not necessary

For him to complete any forms or questionnaires since the

KGB had his Naval RU file; that he was told that the KGB

would request the Naval RU file and meanwhile he was given

three copies of a four to six-page biographic form to complete

never. spoke to any KGB personnel officers nor visited the

completed no forms provided by

them) •

Comment:

The most important document filled out by

prospective KGB officers was a detailed 16-page

personal history questionnaire, Anketa

even when blank, the form was not permitted to

be taken home.:

KGB defectörs have described

completion of the form "as an experience not

likely to be forgotten.

NOSENKO omits in all

accounts reference to other documents which are

known to have been required in connection with

a KGB officer's processing for duty:

NOSENKO insisted that he took no physical examination in

connection with processing for KGB entry:

Comment:

A medical examination was a routine and mandatory

part of a KGB

candidate's processing. Former

KGB defectors could think of no instance in

which the examination could be waived, parti-

cularly for a candidate with a recorded history

of tuberculosis.

NOSENKO claims in all of his accounts that he entered the

KGB building and, with a pass obtained at the Pass Office,

was permitted to proceed without escort. NOSENKO specifically

asserted that the name of the interviewer did not appear on

the pass.

The interviewer's name was essential

Initial Service in KGB (1953)

NOSENKO stated that in the period of Beriya, in March-

June 1953, the two existing directorates were the First

Chief Directorate, which was the foreign intelligence

existings

directorate, and the Second Chief Directorate, the counter-

intelligence directorate.

The designations were later

reversed for a few months, he said, by Kruglov, Beriya's

successor.

Comment:

Beriya reversed the designations of the First.

and

Second Chief Directorates in March 1953,

and they were not changed back until March 1954.

NOSENKO does not know how his

own directorate

was designated either at the time he allegedly

entered on duty or during his entire first

year of KGB service.

NOSENKO described the KGB identity document of the period,

but in spite of repeated questioning could not recall any-

thing unusual about it.

new stamps were placed on the document, lacking

installation. KGB defectors state that the

events were the topic of numerous anecdotes at

the time.

NOSENKO claims he received no training

in the KGB, but

was assigned operations responsibilities immediately upon

reporting for duty.

He had explained that training was

unnecessary because of his Naval RU experience.

Comment:

NOSENKO's lack of training is unlike that of

any other KGB defector. His Naval RU service,

by NOSENKO's own account, provided little if

any preparation for his subsequent KGB duties.

NOSENKO

that his initial KGB basic pay was 1700

rubles

officer, plus

secrecy, language and

longevity pay, plus 500 rubles, "rank pay" as a lieutenant.

He recalled that there was one year, 1954, when KGB officers

dia not receive the pay for rank.

Comment:

September 1952 and not restored until April

Other Aspects Relevant to 1953 KGB Service

NOSENKO insisted that the KGB was organized from components

of the MVD not earlier than late 1954 or early 1955.

Comment:

The KGB was Organized in March 1954, in a final

reform of Beriya's organization of Soviet

security agencies."

Preceded by a series of

purges, the inception of the KGB would presumably

be memorable to a KGB officer serving in Moscow

Headquarters at the time.

NOSENKO stated that the MVD Intelligence Directorate

(subsequently to become the KGB First Chief Directorate,

was located in 1953 in four buildings, including the

Agricultural Exhibition and the "KI (Committee of Infor-

mation) Building".

Comment:

The Agricultural Exhibition and the "KI

Building" were one and the same.

From his

statement, NOSENKO is unaware that the KI

(a combined foreign intelligence agency)

ceased to exist in 1951, a matter perhaps

unfamiliar to a KGB officer serving at a

substantially later time, but one which

other KGB officers serving in Moscow in

1953 recalled

easily.

NOSENKO did not know where the Chief Directorate of the

Militia was located in 1953-1954.

Comment:

According to KGB defectors, a staff officer in

the Counterintelligence Directorate at the time

would have had frequent occasion to deal with

the Chief Directorate of the Militia.

(KGB ENTRY)

KGB Entry: Summary and Conclusion

NOSENKO's assertions regarding the KGB in the 1953-1954

period throw

no more light on the actual date of his KGB

entry than did his claims of when he transferred from the

Naval RU; the contradictions and

inconsistencies are

interrelated.

It is possible that a former KGB officer, relating the

truth as he recalls it about events occurring ten years

earlier, could be inconsistent; that he could forget his

date of entry, not remember what administrative procedures

were, fail to recall the circumstances of the organization

he joined were, be inaccurate about what his pay was, and

be vague on what his KGB identification document looked

like.

Recognizing that administrative regulations and

procedures are on occasion honored in the breach, it is

also possible that NOSENKO was accepted by the KGB despite

the

fact that he was the son of a senior official, that he

had

tuberculosis, that he was unqualified for Party member-

ship, that he had been previously rejected and all at a

when the KGB was not accepting new recruits.

The probability of these events being coincident, however,

is remote.

On examination, NOSENKO's latest admission, that

he

"actually" entered the

• KGB in March 1953, is no better

substantiated than earlier accounts citing other dates.

Conclusion

NOSENKO did not enter the KGB in the manner nor at the

time he claimed:

CHAPTER V

AMERICAN EMBASSY SECTION OF AMERICAN DEPARTMENT

(ca. 1953-June 1955)

NOSENKO claims to have served in the American Embassy

Section of the American Department (Second Chief Directorate)

from his entry in the KGB until June 1955. His targets

during this period were at first American correspondents

residing in Moscow and later Army Attache personnel of the

American Embassy in Moscow.

His assignment involving

American correspondents lasted anywhere from six to eighteen

months (depending on the various dates he claimed he entered

the KGB) •

His involvement with the Army Attaches lasted

from sometime in 1954 until his transfer to the Seventh

Department in June 1955.

NOSENKO has sought to avoid discussion of his own of

other KGB activities during this entire period which he

characterized on occasion as "not relevant" or "of no

consequence"

He has repeatedly stated that he "found

himself" only after this initial KGB service in the American

Embassy Section.

Until then, he asserted, he was a wastre

and "did not pay attention to the work".

(He has variously

dated his self-discovery as occurring in 1955 when he

case; and after August 1956 when the death of his father

forced him to pull himself together.)

operations Against American Correspondents

NOSENKO exempted himself from reporting details of KGB

work against any specific American correspondent in Moscow

in 1953-1954 by saying that, as a new, very junior employee

he had no access to operational files and did not partici-

pate personally in the handling of any of the correspondents.

Although able to identify correspondents in Moscow who were

then recruited KGB agents, NOSENKO learned this information

either in conversations with his superior [V.A.] KOZLOV or

at some point and in some undefined way after he no longer

was working against these targets.

NOSENKO made clear that

he was not the case officer responsible for the more important

correspondents:

"KOZLOV himself was working with them,

chief of the section himself--with SHAPIRO/with SHAPIRO 06

wife. I also know that KOZLOV was working with WHITNEY 06

identified the Polish-born wife of WHITNEY as

a KGB agent, an allegation which she denied.

NOSENKO said his early months in the job were spent

reading personality (not operational) files on a number of

the correspondents in Moscow, (none of which indicated the

individual's developmental of agent status) and familiarizing

himself with KGB methods.

Later NOSENKO was assigned the

"agent network" of drivers, clerical personnel, and domestics

surrounding four of the correspondents, SHAPIRO, GILMORE, €6,06,06

SALISBURY] and WHIINEY.". He met with his agents periodically

to determine whether they had developed any important infor-

mation.

His superior KOZLOV often went along to the meetings

with NOSENKO, first to show him how to handle the agents and

afterward whenever something interesting would begin to

develop.

In fact, according to NOSENKO, KOZLOV would

accompany him to meetings with these Soviet citizens-agents

when there was even a hint that something of interest might

NOSENKO has descrived some of these agents in

general terms, but for all but a few he recalled neither

their names nor personalia concerning them.

06

WHITNEY

On the day of his acceptance into the KGB, NOSENKO

stated that he was taken directly to the offices of the

American Embassy Section.

There he met the section chief!

V.A. KOZLOV, who told NOSENKO that he would take over the

work of the departing case officer, Captain Anatolly

TORMOZOV, in operations against American correspondents in

MOSCOW

When NOSENKO reported for work the following day, he

found a desk in Room 615 and, "There were three other guys

sitting there. At first I was running traces, and at the

same time I was reading the files on journalists. I think

there were seven files in all, and I didn't see any other.

NOSENKO listed these files

as those on Henry SHAPIRO, Eddy 06,06

active recruitment target in 1953 and 1954, but NOSENKO

did not know whether he was recruited. Likewise, he did

not know the status of SALISBURy as of 1953.

- 06

NOSENKO stressed that the files he was given to read

during the early period of his KGB service were develop-

mental files (delo formulyar) rather than the operational

files of the agents.

The developmental files were less

and cooks.

Agents Reporting on Correspondents

NOSENKO said he was responsible

06 GILMORES and met them regularly to learn whether" "anything

was new, whom did (SHAPIRO meet, what might be interesting

in his behavior, what might be suspicious in his behavior,

whom he is contacting, etc"

.

He then reported to KOZLOV and

would sometimes prepare a written report of his conversations

with the agents.: Asked to describe these meetings, NOSENKO

replied:

06

"Let us take the same case of SHAPIRO. I would

meet drivers about three times a month or even two

times. Oft the meeting I would ask the driver what

was

in SHAPIRO"s behavior since our last meeting.

theY (SHAPIRO had suspicious contacts with forei-

gners, about his meetings with Russians, were they

would begin his report.

Of course, if he spots

anything suspicious he calls immediately, and I

would see him the next morning.

Otherwise, I would

tell him at the meeting that I would see him again

in about ten days or in two weeks, but if there was

something interesting he should call immediately.

It was the same with

the maid and the cook.

Upon

returning to the office I would have to report to

KOZLOV about my meetings, either orally or in

writing.

If,. for example, IV.M.] KOVSHUK lalso of

the American Embassy Sectionl had a meeting with his

agents, he too had to report immediately to KOZLOV.

If the meetings were taking place late in the day

and lasted until midnight or later and there were

no written materials submitted at the meeting, I

could go home and then report the

next morning."

KOZLOV accompanied NOSENKO to meetings with the various

agents surrounding the correspondents.

"At first he was

teaching me.

Then he would go in cases when something

interesting would begin to develop, even when it hadn't

yet begun to develop but when there may have been a hint

in a case of some other case officer.

NOSENKO's agent network consisted mainly of domestic and

clerical personnel in contact with the correspondents and

their families. Asked to describe them, he said:

"My first agent has a woman agent, a cook, who

was working at GILMORN's place.

She also worked

at the Associated Press later.

Her. codename was

'AGLODINA', a funny one."

(While reviewing a list

of Soviets employed by Americans in Moscow, NOSENKO

in the fall of 1965 identified one Yelena s.

KOSIENKO as his former agent "AGLODINA".

"At that

time he told CIA that he had taken over KOSIENKO

from TORMOZOV upon entering the American Embassy

against particular individuals, he had forgotten their true

NOSENKO estimated that he was responsible for handling

dents.

This, he said, 'was a normal load, although more

experienced case officers might have as many as fifteen.

NOSENKO described his agentura as follows:

Operations Against U.S. Army Attache Personnel

NOSENKO claimed specific responsibility for work against

American Army Attaches during twenty months of 1954-55, a

period in which NOSENKO claimed no supervisory responsibility

to divert his attention from personal operational duties.

(NOSENKO, explaining why he did not know more details about

the Embassy, Section's targets while he was its deputy chief

he we see a

in 1960-1961, said that as a supervisor he was too busy

overseeing subordinates.

Hence, NOSENKO continued, he could

not be expected to remember as many such details as would

be possible had he been a case officer working daily on only

four or

five targets. Elsewhere, he contrasted operations

against tourists, who often came and went in a matter of a

few days, with the work against the service attaches and

diplomats permanently stationed in Moscow, who could be

studied systematically and slowly.)

NOSENKO has said in different contexts that as the

American Department case officer responsible for operations

against Army Attaches he received and was responsible for

assimilating the product of a wide variety of sources on the

individuals who were his targets. He has mentioned infor-

mation received from the KGB First Chief (Foreign Intelli-

Comment:

NOSENKO has said variously that the microphones

in the Army Attache offices were his most

valuable source of information on his targets

of 1954-1955; that he knew nothing of these

microphones until he re-entered the Embassy

Section in 1960; and that he learned of their

existence during 1953-1955 but not where any

were located.

Information was also received according to NOSENKO from the

network of Soviet chauffeurs, cooks, language instructors,

and

other agents in the Embassy; permanent and roving

surveillance patrols outside the Embassy; fixed observation

posts next to, across from and near the Embassy; advance

notification of intent to travel by the attaches and their

itineraries; and reports from outside Moscow, including

surveillance, agent networks, the Militia, and the military.

The point of collecting and assimilating this information,

NOSENKO said, was to be able to know what the military

attaches were doing in Moscow and thereby to control their

intelligence collection activities.

the goal of recruiting military attaches; NOSENKO knew of

only a few instances when this was attempted, and all of

these efforts allegedly failed.

The KGB's principal interest in control rather than

recruitment has been NOSENKO's explanation

for knowing little

about the backgrounds

and personal lives of his targets--such

information, he stated, simply was not pertinent to the

primary mission of

control.

He has also used this explana-

tion to support his assertion that there were no recruitments

of American military personnel during this period.

Comment:

0001352

NOSENKO's assertion that the KGB's mission was

to control rather than to recruit American

military attaches is contradicted by the

emphasis KGB tradition and doctrine place on

conducting operations against the United

States, the "main enemy", in the KGB parlance,

in this case American officials with access to

classified information, who were residing in

the soviet Union.

In the USSR, especially in the early 1950's

prior to the U-2 reconnaissance, the Service

Attache travel program was the primary means

by which the U.S. Armed Forces acquired intelli-

gence information on the Soviet Union's

military-industrial complex.

The prevention

or inhibition of this collection activity fell

consequently to KGB components concerned with

the security of military-industrial installations,

Comment:

(Continued)

with transportation facilities, and with the

geographic regions to which the Service:

Attaches travelled.

Approval of Service

Attache travel itineraries was not within the

competence of a case officer within the Embassy

Section; the determination would have to have

been

made by officials concerned with the

USSR's military and

industrial security and

aware of reciprocal privileges being extended

to Soviet Service Attaches in the United

States, matters involving the GRU as well as

the KGB.:

An Embassy Section case officer

would have as a matter of course monitored

reports of Service Attaches' travel, searching

for personal vulnerabilities among his targets,

and assisted local KGB elements in setting up

provocations outside of Moscow.

NOSENKO,

however, has included neither of these latter

functions as having been among his responsi

bilities.

Custody of Case Files on Army Attache Personnel

"Sometime in the first half of 1954" NOSENKO said, he

was relieved of his responsibilities for the correspondent

cases, and

from then until his transfer from the American

Department he handled KGB Second Chief Directorate operations

against the officer personnel of the Army Attache's office.

NOSENKO's account of the turnover of the correspondent files

to his successor and of the acceptance of the attache files

is presented below.

-8 April 1964:

"I took over the Army Attache cases from

Nikolay KHRENOV..•

When I was leaving in 1955, I turned

the attache files over to Valeriy BUDYLDIN."

-10. April 1964: "I made a mistake (when] I said I

accepted the cases from KHRENOV....

I accepted the cases

from Pavel Fedorovich PAIIKRATOV. This was in the beginning

of 1954."

-15 April 1964: NOSENKO said that he thought he turned

over the correspondent files to F.V. KISLITSYN (who returned

to the USSR from Australia in May 1954) • NOSENKO asked

when the PETROVs defected in Australia; he explained that

he was not sure about KISLITSYN and could have given them

to another officer.

"If KISLITSYN came [back from Australia)

in 1953, then it was to KISLITSYN. Otherwise, it was some-

one else."

"18: June 1964: "KISLITSYN came into the Embassy Section

in 1954 and I gave him the files on American correspondents.

BUDYLDIN also joined the section this year and took the

files on the Army Attache and his assistants from PANKRATOV.

BUDYLDIN left later that year and turned those files over

to: me.....

Yuriy LEONTIYEV joined the section in 1955, and

gave him the files on the Army Attache and his assistants."

NOSENKO has also been indefinite as to the date he assumed

responsibilities for the Attaches.

As noted above, he said

on

10 April 1964 that he received the files in the beginning

of 1954.

Ile had earlier said that he worked on the corres-

pondents "only alout six months".

If the date of March 1953,

which he most often gave for his entry into the KGB, is

correct, this would place the turnover in the fall of 1953.

On other occasions he has said specifically that he turned

over the correspondent cases and began work against the

Attaches in January 1954, on still others that this occurred

in May 1954.

In February 1965, NOSENKO said that he could

not remember when he changed assignments.

Agents. Reporting on Army Attaches

Asked in April 1964 to describe the agent network

(agentura) at his disposal in operations

against Army

Attaches during this period which began in 1954, NOSENKO

replied: "There were two maids, a cook, drivers...about ten

persons, plus the agent. 'SERVIZNIY' and the one with the

cryptonym 'DMITRIYEV'....

These additional two agents,

about 12 or 13 agents altogether." With one exception, this

networl: remained constant until NOSENKO transferred from

the American Embassy Section in mid-1955. He met each agent

about once a week, except for the chauffeurs who were met

three times

a month in a safehouse or on the street. The

Assistant Army Attaches used a pool of five drivers at

random, all of whom were his agents, NOSENKO said..

Apart

from the permanent driver for the senior Attache, none

was targetted against specific members of the attache

office.

Comment:

As noted earlier, NOSENKO named "VOLODINA" and

" RAKETA"

...as agents he used against correspondents

and against Army. Attache targets, but he never

again referred to them and, in describing his

own activities, he never indicated how or in

what cases they were used:

According to NOSENKO, this network was "just a supporting

agentura, which very seldom was worthwhile," the main source

of information on the Army Attaches being the microphones in

their offices.

Newly added to the network while NOSENKO held this

position was a maid inserted to report on Army Attache

06

BarI L. MICKELSON and his successor Fillmore K. MEARNS! 06

Her name, NOSENKO thought, was NOVIKOVA. She. was an

English-speaking university graduate but "hid her knowledge

of English in order to overhear conversations or read

letters without taking them outside"

Besides NOVIKOVA, NOSENKO named one other maid who was

his agent. Mariya NEVEROVA, cryptonym "SHVEDOVA,

and she

was targetted against the Assistant Army Attache, [Ira 06

RICHARDS. He described NEVEROVA as a "little, old, thin

woman,"

from whom he never obtained anything of interest.

Of the KGB agents among the chauffeurs, NOSENKO named

Nikolay SHNYRYEV, who was used by various

attaches.

"He

reported where they went, what they said, whether they took

notes or photographs, whether they had unusual packages

with them, and so on."

When viewing photographs (see below) in September 1964,

NOSENKO identified Vladislav VOROBYEV as his former agent

"SERVIZNIY". He had been working in the Embassy since its

establishment, starting first as a messenger boy and, in

NOSENKO's time, performing clerical tasks. VOROBYEV had no

direct connection with the Army Attaches,.

and NOSENKO said

he himself did not know why he had been given VOROBYEV to

handle in 1951.

The main function of this agent was

delivering to NOSENKO copies of the unclassified telephone

listings of the Embassy, Issued monthly.

"DMITRIYEV's" true name may have been Dmitriy KUKOLEV;

NOSENKO saw this name on a 1962 phone list and thought, but

was not sure, that this was his agent.

An electrician who

worked on the

Embassy's electrical wiring systems and

elevator,

"DMITRIYEV"

reported to NOSENKO on antenna wires

and other wires he had observed on the top floors.

Like

VOROBYEV, "DMITRIYEY" had no direct

connection with the

Army Attaches.

Comment:

Elsewhere NOSENKO described an electrician who

provided some technical information on the

Embassy, but he related him to his second tour

in the American Embassy Section in 1960-1962

1060-19621

and did not then claim that the electrician was

his agent.

In Septemuer 1964 NOSENKO was shown a series of 260

biographic cards on Soviet citizens employed by the American

Embassy in Moscow.

Each card contained a photograph of

the

person involved and short biographic notes, including his

name and job in the Embassy.

The first time he went through

these cards, NOSENKO was permitted to see only the photo-

graphs; NOSINKO diù not identify the photograpis of SHNYRYEV

adding that he thought his name was VOROBYEV. Then shown

the Embassy biographic cards on SINYRYEV and KUKOLEV,

he

identified each of them as his agents during the 1954-1955

period in the American Department and equated them to the

cryptonyms given previously. In the case of SHNYRYEV, when

shown the biogtaphic information, which listed SHNYRYEV as

"chauffeur for the military attache," NOSENKO exclaimed:

"Oh my God,

this is my own agent."

about agents who might have been working against MICKELSON, Ob

NOSENKO said that there was one cook, a KGB operational

contact whose name he did not recall, and MICKELSON's maid, 06

NOSENKO said that the KGB learned nothing interesting about

D6 MICKELSON from concealed microphones, telephone taps, or

surveillance, and that no operational approach or recruit-

ment was attempted.

There was, in fact, no interesting or

derogatory information on MICKELSON from any source.

Comment:

MICKELSON was involved in at least two

incidents inside the Soviet Union which

HOSENKO has not reported. In May 1954 he was

arrested in Thilisi on the (false) charge of:

having photographed a bridge.

In August 1954

C6 MICKELSON was arrested again for illegal photo-

graphy south of Kharkov; on this occasion he

was held for two hours before being released.

It is judged that such events, particularly

those staged by the KGB, would be known to the

KGB case officer responsible for the attache

officer concerned.

MEARNS

NOSENKO accurately identified Fillmore K. MEARNS as

MICKELSON's replacement and said that he was the responsi-

Ble case officer.

There were two agents and one operational

contact working against MEARNS.$6 Of these, IOSENKO couLd

recall the name only

of NOVIKOVA, the same maid who reported

earlier on MICKELSON, SoBesides being told to attempt to over-

do hear MEARNS conversations, NOVIKOVA was instructed to

search his clothing and to copy any notes she might find,

but she never overheard or found anything of interest to

the KGB. NOSENKO recalled that MEARNS' personal effects D6

were searched by the KGB while they were being shipped to

Moscow from the United States,

and that all his service

records had been discovered and photographed. (NOSENKO

has told this same story about (MICKELSON.) NOSENKO described 06

MEARNS as being more "active" in Moscow than MICKELSON had 06

been and said that information from concealed microphones

showed him to have a strong character. Nothing of interest

concerning him was received from these microphones or from

telephone taps.

Additional Reporting

Knowledge of another KGB operation involving Americans

was said by NOSENKO to stem from his 1953-1955 service in

the American Embassy Section, against CIA officer and

Embassy Security Officer Edward Ellis SMITH (see p. 37).

NOSENKO claimed to have personally participated in

the

operations against E.E. SMITH in 1954-1955. The incidents

which NOSENKO described, however, occurred in June 1956,

by which time NOSENKO, by his own account, had been out of

the American Embassy Section for a year and when he was

involved in the Seventh Department recruitment of RichardU

BURGI)

His involvement in the BURGI case has been confirmed.

NOSENKO has also described the KGB recruitment of military

cipher machine mechanic "ANDREY" (Dayle SMITH, see p. 33),

whose

true name he claimed not to have known.

He dated the

recruitment as occurring "in 1949-1950" and "before he

joined the KGB", although he said that he knew of the

existence of the

agent during his first tour in the Embassy

Section in 1953-1955.

However, NOSENKO also related that

"ANDREY" was recruited while Roy RHODES was in Moscow, that

"had spotted 'ANDREY'".

"ANDREY" and RHODES over-

lapped in Moscow from April 1952 to July 1953.

"ANDREY"

fixes his own recruitment as occurring in December 1953,

and until his departure in April 1954 he was responsible

for the entire Embassy code room. In that capacity "ANDREY"

was a direct subordinate of the Army Attache cryptographic

security officer, NOSENKO's target Army Captain Walter MULE. U6

If NOSENKO served in the 'Embassy Section during 1953-1955

as he claimed, it is difficult to perceive how he could have

remained unaware of "ANDREY's" identity.

According to NOSENKO, immediately upon entering on duty

with the KGB he was assigned without training to what he

describes as the most sensitive and important section of

the Second Chief Directorate.

There, after first handling

agents covering American correspondents resident in Moscow,

he was made the case officer solely responsible for opera-

tions against the commissioned officers of the Embassy's

Army Attache office, until his transfer to the Seventh

Department. Alleging complete knowledge of all service

attache operations, NOSENKO flatly asserts that there were

no KGB recruitments of American military personnel during

the period of his assignment to the Embassy Section.

Pertinent to the consideration of NOSENKO's statements

is his reluctance to discuss the 1953-1955 period, and his

inconsistent accounts of the dating and circumstances of

his entry into the Embassy Section, of his assumption of

responsibility as sole case officer for Army Attache tar-

gets, and of his transfer to the Seventh Department. Al-

though NOSENKO could plausibly claim failing memory to ex-

plain some areas of ignorance, he does not do so.

Instead,

he is positive and insistent that his statements about his

targets are a factual and complete account of what was then

known to the KGB. His assertion that the KGB was not in-

terested in his targets'

vulnerability to recruitment is

belied by his own statements as well as by the MULE] case, 06

as he himself related it.

He is uninformed about both At-

tache personnel and agent-informants who, by his own ac-

count, were his targets and his agents..

Conclusion

NOSENKO did not serve in the American Embassy Section

throughout the March 1953-June 1955 period as he claimed.

Specifically, he neither entered the Section in March 1953

nor transferred from the Section in June 1955. In whatever

period he may have served, he was not the sole case officer

responsible for commissioned officers in the office of the

Army Attache. Unaware of many aspects of KGB activities

involving Army personnel and by his own account not involved

involved with seventh Department operations

against merican and British tourists, coin-

cides with the growth of a suistantial

Imerican and Britis Intelligence program!l

aimed at

exploiting tourists visiting the

Sovict Union. Boginning in 1956, the growth

of tourism which followed the post-stalin

thai in the ussr had grown to the point

where it could

be usefully exploited ly CIA.

Initially, returning American tourists were

debriofed on their experiences in the Soviet

Union anc particularly with regard to their

acquaintances there with Soviet citizens who

might be

susceptille to eventual recruitment.

Gradually, leads were

developed to Americans

planning to visit the USSR, and from among

these, agents were selected, trained in

clandestine operational techniques, briefed

intelligence requirements, and instructed

how to identify and develop potential agents

from arong their soviet contacts.

The

American agents performed a variety of clan-

destine tasks including passive assessment

of Soviet candidates for recruitment, propa-

ganda activities, and infiltrating equipment,

loading deaddrops, of mailing letters bearing

secret writing, all destined for CIA agents

in

the

soviet Union.

the program reached its height in 1959,

fifty agents under tourist cover from CIA

alone had performed missions in the USSR; by

Comment:

(Continued)

then a substantial number of similar missions

had also been launched by American military

intelligence organizations and by the Britishll

and allied services.

It is a matter of fact, not of conjecture,

that as early as 1957 a large number of these

agents were coming to the attention of the KGB

within the soviet Union.

Few were arrested.

Instead, all were surveilled, and some pro

voked or entrapped, as the

Second Chief

Directorate and its provincial KGB counter-

intelligence elements sought to identify the

Soviet citizens with whom the American

agents

were in contact, as well as the agents'

specific clandestine tasks. By the summer

of 1959 the KGB had obtained from its British

agent,

George BLAKf, complete details of the

objectives and methods of CIA and British i

Intelligence tourist programs, together with

a number of case examples.

It is within this context that one must

examine NOSENKO's claims to KGB service in

and consequent knowledge of Second Chief

Directorate counterintelligence operations

against American and British tourists in 1955-

1960 °

NOSENKO claimed he served with the Seventh Department

from June 1955 until January 1960.

According to him, the

Seventh Department exercised counterintelligence functions

involving foreigners then visiting

the Soviet Union,

including businessmen,

seamen, foreign delegations

and some

tourists, as well as the hotels and restaurants utilized by

these visitors.

He said that by 1958, however, the number

of foreign tourists visiting the soviet Union had grown

Tourist Section was split, and two new sections were created.

NOSENKO explained that one

responsible for counterintelligence operations conducted

against American and British Commonwealth nationals, the

other section was charged with all other nationalities:

It is convenient to divide the examination of NOSENKO's

claims to service in the Seventh Department into two

periods.: The first of these covers the years from June

1955 until June 1958, during which NOSENKO said he was a

case officer handling and recruiting agents of all nationa-

lities and planning and managing other operational activi-

ties.

The

second period covers HOSENKO's service from June

1958, when he claimed to have become Deputy Chief of the

newly-created American-British Commonwealth Section, to the

beginning of 1260.

IOSENKO described his personal and direct participation

in Seventh Department operations during this four and one-

half years as including:

-Recruiting and handling Soviet citizen agents and

targetting them against American tourists.

HOSENKO 'S

agentura varied in number from eight to fourteen agents,

most of whom were employees of Inturist.

-Mounting operations against fifteen foreigners,

principally Americans, in the Soviet Union.

-Recruiting a pair of Soviet homosexuals as agents

to be utilized against foreign homosexual targets. NOSINIKO

managed the pair from their recruitment in 1957 and 1958

until their retirement in 1962 or 196306

-Recruiting and handling Arsene FRIPPED, the American 08

Express Company representative in Moscow.

(NOSENKO continued

Ob to meet FRIPPELeven after the latter was transferred from

Moscow to New York and after NOSENKO was transferred from

the Seventh Department.

From personal involvement or otherwise MOSEHKO claimed

that he learned of all the important operations conducted

against American tourists during this period of his Seventh

Department service.

NOSENKO 's Soviet Agents

The Seventh Department Tourist Section, just established

when NOSENKO was transferred to it in mid-1955, had no agent

network for operations against American and British

Consequently, NOSENKO said, he and

the other case officers

had to "start from the beginning".

As a first step NOSENKO was introduced by a fellow.

officer to a number of "trusted persons" in Inturist.

These

were not agents, he explained, but "just persons a KGB man

could approach with questions about somebody or something".

NOSENKO collected information on these and others with the

aim of formalizing their recruitments. By the end of 1955,

he estimated, he had a network of about eight agents, all

of them Inturist interpreters. During the following

four

years, the number of agents whom NOSENKO handled varied.

Agents would be transferred from one case officer to another,

some would leave Inturist, and "things were sort of changing

all the time, back and

forth". In 1956, NOSENKO said, he

had about ten agents, in 1957 there were about twelve, in

1958 about eight, and

at the end of 1959 (when he was

preparing to return to the American Department) he had

approximately twelve. The substance of MOSFNKO's descrip-

tion of his agents is as follows:

Larissa SOBOROVA

An Inturist English-language interpreter, SOBOROVA was

one of the first agents recruited in 1955 by NOSENKO within

Inturist.

She reported to him on all foreigners with whom

she worked as an interpreter.

he served as a guide for British subjects BIRSE and| LANE(in Ob Ob

SOBOROVA was an Inturist guide for a number

of American tourists, including CiA agents,

between 1957 and 1959. SUTTON'has identified 06

her.

In 1959 she was the head of all English-

language interpreters at Inturist headquarters

in'the National Hotel, Moscor.

Vladimir MURONTSEV

MUROMISEV, KGB cryptonym

"LEBEDEV", was recruited by

HOSENKO from Inturist in 1955. He was NOSENKO's agent!

until called into the army in about 1959, when he was sent

to a Soviet Air Force Academy in Central Asia to serve as

an

interpreter with Syrian students there: During that

period his file was held by the KGB organization in Central

Asia.

Then he returned to Moscow he was re-employed by the

KGB

Second Directorate.

Comment:

NOSENKO has said elsewhere that MUROMTSEV had

been

a Second

1 Chief Directorate agent "since

1958", implying that someone else recruited

him and that he thus could not have been

NOSENKO's agent in 1955.

MUROMTSEV was

identified in 1957 as an Inturist guide by

two CIA sources.

Nikolay ROGOV

ROGOV, KGB cryptonym "OZERO", was recruited in 1955;

He

had been formerly a "confidential contact" of the KGB:

He

worked in the central Inturist office which assigned inter-

preters to British and American citizens visiting the USSR.

assing eit

Nataliya SHULGINA

SHULGINA was an Inturist interpreter recruited by NOSENKO

in 1955.

NOSENKO knew that double agent Boris BELITSKIY

[see p.282] "reported to the KGB that CIA had warned BELITSKIY

against SHULGINA".

Comment:

KGB-controlled CIA source BELITSKIY reported

to CIA that SHULGINA was a KGB agent:

CIA did

not warn him.

SHULGINA was for two years the

secretary-interpreter of NBC correspondent

Irving R. LEVINE after his arrival in Moscow

In July 1955. She served as a quide for an

American musical troupe's visit in the Ussk

in 1956 and in 1956 and 1957 she served as a

guide for American tourists in Moscow. According

to BELITSKIY, she was involved in the sexual

entrapment and KGB recruitment of British MP. Ot

Tom DRIBERG!

NOSENKO's apparent ignorance of

SHULGINA's involvement with LEVINE and other

Americans, as well as with DRISERG, and of her 06

foreign travel, belies his claim that she was

his agent during the 1955-1958 period.

Shown

her photograph in 1964, NOSENKO failed to

recognize it.

Ihen he was then given her name,

he identified her not as his former agent but

just as a Second Chief Directorate agent once

involved with BELITSKIY.

Tamara KUNGAROVA

KUNGAROVA was an Inturist interpreter recruited by

NOSENKO in 1955. In 1957. or 1959 she was involved in a

KGB sexual entrapment operation of an American professor

O6(John THOMPSON,

but there was no attempt to recruit him.

Between 1957 or 1958 and 1960 she was targetted against

American tourist 'and suspect CIA agent. Philip NIFLSEL 03

(see p.420) • KUNGAROVA married NIELSENTand emigrated to 08,05

England, and the KGB was still interested in NIELSEN at 05

the time NOSENKO left the Seventh Department.

Comment:

Elsewhere NOSENKO has said KUNGAROVA was an

agent who came to the Seventh Department from

the British Commonwealth Department in 1957

or early 1958. If true, he could not have

recruited her or have been her case officer in

the 1955-1957 period. In describing the

(3/NIELSEN case, NOSENKO indicated he himself was

not involved and; although he commented on

KUNGAROVA's role,

he never mentioned that she

was or had been his agent. KUNGAROVA was

interviewed by the FBI on the basis of NOSENKO's

information and she confirmed that she had been

06 intimate with THOMPSON while serving aS en

Inturist guide, as well as with other Americans.

She denied, however, that she had ever colla-

borated with the KGB. KUNGAROVA died in 1965.

Aleksandr A.

DMITRIYEV

DMITRIYEV, KGB cryptonym "TOMO"; when NOSENKO recruited

him in 1958, was a candidate member of the USSR Academy Of

Sciences and a specialist on Japan and Thailand.

He spoke

Japanese and English and worked at the Japanese Exhibition

in Moscow..

He

"was used against British and American

nationals"

NOSENKO, he was meeting with another KGB case officer.

DMITRIYEV accompanied a sports delegation to Norway and a

Soviet circus to Japan.

Comment:

DMITRIYEV's travel to Norway and Japan in

1958 is confirmed.. From NOSENKO's own

statement he was aware of DMITRIYEV'S

activities, but he was not his case officer.

(Enu) IVANOV

Once a recruited agent in the Baltic area, when IVANOV

moved to Moscow the provincial KGB suggested he might be

of some use in the capital. IVANOV was a lawyer employed

by the Institute of Foreign Trade when NOSENKO became his

case officer.

IVANOV was later turned over to the British

Commonwealth Department which "planted him in the British

Trade Mission or something like that"

Comment: CIA records contain no reference identifiable

with IVANOV.

Marina RYTOVA

which she obtained on foreign delegates or foreign tourists

who visited the Exhibit in Moscow, and on foreign delegates

attending meetings at the Ministry of Agriculture, where

she served as an interpreter in English and Greek. RYTOVA

served several times as an interpreter for Khrushchev and

once participated in a conversation he had with the Iowa

farmer [Roswell]. GARST.

In 1959 or 1960 she was sent as

an interpreter with a small delegation visiting GARST's

Residency in Washington to report observations made enroute

RYTOVA was married to a captain or major

who works in a military office in Moscow. She had one

Soviet Homosexual Agents

The KGB operations which NOSENKO described commonly

involved sexual entrapment. Many of the operations in

which he claimed a personal role involved the use of homo-

sexual agents, KGB agents whose homosexuality was exploited

against susceptible male targets. Nhile NOSENKO was never

their official case officer, in specific recruitment-

entrapment operations he worked with "LUCH", "NIKOLAYEV",.

"SIBINAK", "KOSHIKIN" and "STROYEV" (Victor BELANOVSKIY,

used in the compromise of Richard BURGI, VASSALL, and the O6

Canadian Ambassador WATKINS) . He provided virtually no

personality information on them and usually could not recall

their true names.

Two such homosexuals, however, VOLKOV

and YEFREMOV, NOSENKO claimed were his own agents.

NOSENKO claimed to have re-recruited VOLKOV, a former

agent (cryptonym "SHMELEV") and recruited YEFREMOV

(cryptonym "GRIGORIY") and to have been their sole case

officer from the beginning of their KGB careers in 1957-

1958 until they were discharged in 1963 because they had

become too well known. He said he met them frequently,

and directed them in at least a dozen entrapment operations

or other homosexual encounters.

them with him when he transferred to the American Department

in 1960 and back again in early 1962 to the Seventh

Department.

YEFREMOV and VOLKOV

Because he had been seen meeting a foreigner in a

public toilet in Moscow, NOSENKO said, the KGB concluded

that A.I. VOLKOV might be a homosexual and hence of some

operational value.

To verify this possibility in 1957, a

homosexual agent of the Moscow Criminal Investigations

Department provoked VOLKOV into a compromising situation.

Then VOLKOV, who had previously been a KGB agent but was

at this time inactive, was summoned by the KGB and, after

NOSENKO interrogated him, he admitted his homosexuality and

agreed to NOSENKO's proposal to work for the KGB among

homosexuals. VOLKOV helped NOSENKO the following year to

recruit a homosexual acquaintance, Aleksey (patronymic not

recalled) YEFREMOV. The two agents subsequently worked

as a team against foreigners under NOSENKO's direction; in

addition to specific targets, they had the general assign-

ment of associating with foreign visitors in Moscow for the

purpose of spotting possible homosexuals. NOSENKO described

on 12 June 1962 his use of

these agents:

"Although I am

a chief of section there I

have all sorts of agents.

I have a good agent

apparatus.

.. I have beautiful girls, whom I can

use as I like.

I have homosexuals, in particu-

lar, one special pair.

I am afraid they are

known to both you and the British...

I permitted

this pair to work [without specific assignments]

on their own. I give them money and tell them

to go 100k around, but only Americans. Look for

American pederasts.

call me at night:

'Yuriy Ivanovich.

There is a mister so-and-so

here.'

I say:

'Well, let him Ido what he

wants]. We'll talk about it tomorrow.'

So the

next day they go to a special hotel room.

We

make photographs. Then we think about what he

represents.

Is he worth it?

Then, as Chief, I

recommend that he be recruited or not--depending i

on his position, what he can give, what he can

tell.

If he can give something, I say: 'Well,

let's have a go ligratl.'

After this, I speak

to these boys:

'Well, go with him again.

whatever is wanted.'

All this is observed by

the KGB:

The (hotell administrator enters.

'What are you doing?' The administrator calls

the Militia. An akt is drawn up.

'Well, you

are

a foreigner.

This is not our business. We

don't know what to do with you.'

Then the Chief

arrives and a conversation ensues:

'Listen,

what shall we do? Pederasty is punishable by

three to five years and now, on the basis of

recent legislation, by up to eight. Understand,

if your friends find out that you are a pederast--

and how can they help but find out'..."

NOSENKO'S Soviet Agents: Summary

NOSENKO claims to have been these agents' case officer

for two to five years, during which he met each regularly,

assigned them operational tasks, and received their reports.

With the exception of YEFREMOV and VOLKOV, however, NOSENKO

can cite few instances of their operational use, and he has

but superficial knowledge of their personal backgrounds.

It is unlikely that this is merely the result of failing

recollection.

He knows no more about the three whom he

claimed he took with him to the Embassy Section, where he

continued to be their case officer for two more years, than

he does about the others.

In the two instances where his

agents were involved in KGB operational activity, NOSENKO

is unaware of SHULGINA's work with LEVINE and DRIBERG, andt

was not involved when KUNGAROVA was targetted against and

married CIA agent Philip NIELSEN. NOSENKO's familiarity

with the nine agents he named appears to be that which

would be acquired second-hand, not through personal contact

as he claimed.

With respect to YEFREMOV and VOLKOV, the evidence does

not sustain NOSENKO's claim that he was their case officer

in every operation Irom their recruitment in 1957 until

their retirement in 1962-1963. He is unfamiliar with either

agent's background.

Recruitment of BURGI

(1956)

At the first meeting with CIA in Geneva In 1962, ROSENIO

gave a brief account of the recruitment of Richard BURGI, a 06

Yale professor The recruitment was effected on the basis

of a homosexual provocation operation which began in Moscow

and culminated with an approach in Kiev in June 1956.

This recruitment, which occurred close in time to the

death of HOSENKO's father, was by NOSINKO's later accounts

a turning point in his personal and professional life.

From it, NOSENKO said he acquired a sense of self-confidence

and responsibility and began to "grow" from a wastrel into

an effective and successful KGD officer.

As a result of

this operation, the first successful recruitment in the then

short nistory of the Tourist Section, NOSENKO asserted he:

first came into personal contact with General GRIBAITOV.

According to all accounts he gave prior to October 1966,

when he retracted the claim, NOSEIKO received the first of

a series of KGB awards for operational performance because

Obof the BURGIcase--a letter of commendation.

Within a month

of this operation, NOSENKO, said, he

was promoted from the

rank of lieutenant to captain.

NOSENKO's Information

NOSENKO stated that at the time of BURGI!'s arrival in

the USSR, his file contained a copy of his visa application

(anketa), "maybe" an excerpt from a cable sent by the

Soviet Embassy in the United States saying that a visa had

been granted, a routine note from Inturist giving BURGI!'s 06

anticipated date of arrival and his itinerary inside the

Soviet Union, and the results of file checks of the KGB

main Archives and of the First Chief Directorate Archives.

NOSENKO himself ran the file checks, which provec to be

negative; there was no information on record concerning

06.

BURGI, and since no other names were mentioned in the

0

material available on BURGI, no other checks were made.

The KGB interest in BURGI derived exclusively from the

fact

had contact with students who might eventually work for the

U.S. State Department, American Intelligence, and for other

target organizations.

NOSENKO did not recall who first

suggested an attempt to recruit him.

When BURGI arrived in the Soviet Union, he came in

contact with a numver of KGS agents, and their reports were

placed in an informal file maintained by NOSENKO. NOSENKO

could not recall how many such agents there may have been,

their names, or what they might have reported concerning

O BURGI. 0 BURGI had an Inturist interpreter but NOSENKO did

not know whether he was a KGB agent.) From some source,

name forgotten by NOSENKO, the KGB obtained indications

that

06 BURGI] was a homosexual, and it was decided to try to obtain

grounds for recruitment by homosexual compromise. NOSENKO

therefore approached Yu. A. LOPUKHOV, an officer of the

British Department who handled the homosexual agent Viktor

BELANOVSKIY, and asked permission to use BELANOVSKIY in

setting up the compromise.

After permission had been :

received to mount an operation on this basis, LOPUKHOV and

fact of common homosexuality was recognized, and BURGI] was 06

invited to BELANOVSKIY's hotel room where homosexual acts

took place and photographs were made.

NOSENKO was in the

adjoining room and directed the compromise, although he did

not meet BURGI at this time.

out, and the basis was prepared for the man to say:

'All right, I agree to help'

We showed him the

He was embarrassed of course--he was

naked

Then we prepared the basis:

'You have a

students may become future specialists on Russia or

may work as diplomats, etc., but many of these

students can be used by intelligence. They may be

sent somewhere with special tasks.

Maybe you will

tell us who among the students is preparing for

...

During the first conversation everything was made

completely clear...

He was not at all willing to

help or work for Soviet Intelligence.

He was told

that he must understand that in this case 'helping

Soviet Intelligence' was a very broad term. I

remember that I told him:

'Understand, nobody is

going

to ask you that you help our friends. over

anything bad or conduct any kind of subversive

hours; at its end BURGI signed a short statement that he 06

agreed "to assist the organs of Soviet Intelligence"

(NOSENKO first said that it was he who took this statement

06 from BURGI but

tater he could not remember whether it was

he or KOZLOV.)

BURGI was then taken to a hotel.

This was the first time NOSENKO met BURGI. Following

the recruitment, he moved into the same hotel, a floor above

06 BURGI, and for the remainder of BURGIl's stay in Kiev became 06

his constant companion and guide. An attempt was made "to

smooth out all the dirty business that had been brought up

during the recruitment talk". NOSENKO took BURGIl to an old 06

cathedral in Kiev; with KOZLOV and PETRENKO they visited a

kolkhoz and the writer SHEVCHENKO's grave in nearby Kaniv.

The subject of homosexuality was not raised again.

From

06 Kiev, BURGIleft the Soviet Union without returning to

MOSCOW.

Before the approach, NOSENKO had visited the

American Department of the First Chief Directorate and had

arranged with its chief, FEKLISOV, for a recontact plan in

New York City should BURGI be recruited. BUrGilwas 06 06

instructed how to use a recognition signal for a first

meeting in the New York Public Library.

About five days after returning to Moscow, NOSENKO

turned over all his materials on the (BURGI operation to 06

the First Chief Directorate. Somewhat later Sergey GUSKOV,

Chief of the American-Canadian-British Tourist Section,

KOZLOV, and NOSENKO visited American Department Chief FEKLISOV

in the First Chief Directorate and expressed an interest in

further developments in the case.

FEKLISOV told them that

06i

BURGI. had been observed to arrive for the first meeting but

the KGB refrained from establishing contact..

The first

actual meeting in New York City took place the second or thiro

06 time BURGI appeared, and a KGB officer of the New York Legal

Residency continued

to meet with him until the revolution in

Hungary in late (October] 1956, when BURGI refused to colla- 06

borate further NOSENKO later heard from someone in the

American Department, First Chief Directorate that the case

was closed. For their roles in this first recruitment of

the Seventh Department, NOSENKO said he and KOZLOV received

letters of commendation and bonuses of one month's pay by

order of SEROV, Chairman of the KGB; PETRENKO was given a

chatrian

letter of commendation and half a month's salary; and even

RASTYKAITE, the housekeeper, got a commendation.

In 1964 NOSENKO reported for the first time that his

superior, A.S. KOZLOV, Deputy Chief of the Seventh Depart-

ment, had

also taken part in this operation, but that he,

NOSENKO, was the responsible case officer.

In August 1965,

when asked who had recruited BURGI), NOSENKO replied: 06

"KOZLOV and NOSENKO: "

Asked who recruited him first,

NOSENKO said: "KOZLOV; naturally.: lie was the Deputy

Chief

of the Department. : The collection of the materials lin

preparation

for the approachl was in the hands of Case

Officer NOSENKO."

responsible for operations against foreign seamen. Since

VERENIKIN spoke no German and GEHRCKENS was known to speak06

English, NOSENKO was selected to make the approach because

"knew English a little". When asked why a German-D

speaking KGB case officer was not used, NOSENKO answered:

"The higher-ups said 'go work on this case', and that was

all." After being rebuffed by GEHRCKENS,, NOSENKO saw himO

NOSENKO's Information

The British subject Sir Allen LANE travelled in the

summer of 1957 to the Soviet Union to visit various publishing

nouses and brought with him as an interpreter Arthur BIRSE. 06

The latter was of Russian extraction, having left Petrograd

(Leningrad) before the Revolution, and he served in British 29

Intelligence during the Second World war. The casa was

handled by another section of the Seventh Department, but

06 because of BIRSEl's past, "some of our leaders decided that

it would be good if one of our workers could approach him,

would get in on the case under the cover of the Ministry of

Culture, who would take care of this person, who would help

him meet with all sorts of people representing our publishing

companies.

The choice fell to me. I was chosen for this

job. "

Taking along the KGB agent Larissa SOBOROVA as an

interpreter and using the alias "NIKOLAYEV", NOSENKO

O6 accompanied BIRSE] and [LANE]in Moscow and Leningrad during

their stay there?

The only object was to watch BIRSE 06

because he was suspected of having an intelligence mission,

and no approach was made or contemplated. NOSENKO explained

that he appeared a "friendly, helpful man who

Moscow during lorld War II and was interpreter

Recruitment of Egil SUNDAR] (1957)

NOSENKO's Information

In 1057 or 1958 aNorwegian journalist, (Enu) SUNDAN,-

visited the Soviet Union and an attempt was made to recruit

him. A Second Chief Directorate officer, N.A. ARKHIPOV,

06 made SUNDAR's acquaintance and handled the entire operation

against him, but NOSENKO himself played a role. NOSENKO

presented himself to [SUNDAR,busing the name "SMIRNOV" or

"SERGEYEV" and posing as a'painter, and told SUNDAR that he06

could find women for him. A party was arranged with a KGB

Obagent as SUNDAR's date and a Second Chief Directorate secre-

tary as NOSENKO's. Late in the evening NOSENKO and his date

excused themselves, and SUNDAR had sexual relations with theO

female agent.

Photographs of the scene were taken by the

KGB.

officers for this purpose) telephoned K.N. DUBAS, Chief of

the Seventh Department, to request an officer who spoke

English. DUBAS

asked NOSENKO whether he wanted to make

: the

trip:

NOSENKO replied:

"Why not? I have never been

abroad yet."

NOSENKO consequently travelled to London,

using the alias Yuriy Ivanovich NIKOLAYEV and posing as

"the deputy chief" of the delegation. He was specifically

instructed to observe one member of the delegation, a woman

named MYARIMYAYE, whose father had been

killed in a Soviet

prison and whose political reliability was uncertain.

Additionally, he had the general task of watching all

members of the delegation for possibly suspicious contacts

with foreigners.

The delegation consisted of approximately

60 persons and to help him

l in carrying out these duties,

NOSENKO was assigned three or four agents and several

operational contacts among the delegation members. He was

the only KGB security officer which accompanied the group.

The second trip to London took place a year later, in

the fall of 1958, again as a security escort. This time

he accompanied a delegation of eleven or twelve boxers, and

again he used the alias. NIKOLAYEV and the cover position of:

deputy chief of the delegation.

NOSENKO said he was the

only security officer with the delegation, and he had two

agents and two operational contacts among the boxers. His

assignment was general; no one in particular was kept under

observation, and the KGB had no derogatory information

concerning any member of the delegation.

NOSENKO used the NIKOLAYEV alias for travel to London

because it was the alias used earlier with the British

subjects BIRSE) and LANE. NOSENKO explained this situation

as follows:

06

06

"With BIRSE and (LANEJI used the name NIKOLAYEV,

Yuriy Ivanovich, a representative of the Ministry

of Culture. And

then when the question was raised

of sending me in 1957 with the delegation to

England, I was forced to go there as NIKOLAYEV.

went back to England, they would tell who they were

with [report their contacts in the USSR]. They

would probably question BIRSE especially, as one 06

who used to work in intelligence... BIRSElwould 06

say: 'There was this man from the Ministry of

Culture, NIKOLAYEV.

He was with us all the time,

even went to Leningrad with us.' So they would

say:

'How does he look [what does he look likel?'

He would say:

'He looked so-and-so.' I'd go there,

and they would look at me and say: 'How come this

name NIKOLAYEV. Just a matter of conspiracy.

Since I already became known as NIKOLAYEV to the

Britishers, this would be noticeable."

Comment:

That NOSENKO (aS NIKOLAYEV) took the trips is

corroborated by British records?

¡ according toll

which, a Yuriy Ivanovich NIKOLAYEV, born 30

October 1927, arrived at London from Brussels

on 20 August 1957. His visa application

described him as a member of a group invited

by the Light Athletics Association to partici-

pate in contests in London.

He left on 27

August 1957.

With the same name and date of

birth, NIKOLAYEV arrived again at London on

12 October 1958 with seventeen others, all

described as boxers.

. His visa application

described him as an

"office worker"

his landing card, NIKOLAYEV was listed as a

boxer.

He left London on 19 October 1958.

On neither visit dia NIKOLAYEV attract the

attention of any British security service. Cy

While these trips are corroborated, they

are not material to NOSENKO's claims to have

served in the KGB positions he alleges he

held at the time.

Deputy Chief of the American-British Commonwealth Section

According

to NOSENKO, the seventh Department was reorgan-

ized in June 1958, and NOSENKO's section, which theretofore

had been concerned with operations against foreign tourists

split into two new sections, one

concerned with tourists from the United States and the

British Commonwealth and the other with tourists from Europe,

Latin America, and all other countries. NOSENKO claimed

that at that time he was promoted to the position of Deputy

Chief of the American-British Commonwealth Section, "the

Recruitment of F

HARRIS (1958)

NOSENKO's Informatioß6

NOSENKO in 1958 recruited Gisella HARRIS, an employee of

29,10 the American Express Company in Salt Lake Cityl. The recruit-

ment was based on her romantic and sexual involvement with

a Soviet citizen, who told HARRIS that he was in trouble 06

with Soviet authorities and persuaded her to accompany him

to the police. HARRIS agreed to meet and cooperate with 06

the KGB in[Salt Lake City•

The case was turned over to thelU

First Chief Directorate, and NOSENKO was unaware of any.

further contact with her.

Comment:

06,08

HARRIS, a

former German citizen, visited the

USSR on a tourist visa in 1958.

According to

statements made to the FBI in 1958, the purpose

of her visit was to contact her former lover,

a Soviet soldier who had fathered her child in

Germany in 1953.

She hoped to persuade him to

divorcé

his Soviet wife and marry her. She

described her recruitment by two men, one of

whom resembled NOSENKO. When shown a photo-

graph in 1964, she tentatively identified

NOSENKO as one of the men who recruited her

and said that, of the two involved, he "was

definitely the man in charge" while

"was merely present and listened". According

06 to HARRIS,

she has had no further contact with

Soviet intelligence.

(NOSENKO had been the case officer and had

handled the operation, but he took no part in the confronta-

Recruitment of TAYLOR] (1959)

NOSENKO' Information

NOSENKO personally and alone recruited the Moscow

representative of British European AirwayS, whose name 29

• NOSENKO did not recall, at the Hotel Metropol in Moscow

during the summer of 1959, possibly in August.

The approach

was based on homosexual compromise involving NOSENKO's

agents VOLKOV and YEFREMOV.

NOSENKO explained that the Seventh Department in 1959

had a section dealing with commercial representatives, which

eat on danga that the

was responsible for the BEAman. That section had asked

NOSENKO's section for help.29

"They said they didn't have any agents or any-

thing and didn't know what to do."

So somebody said,

'Well look, why don't you ask the chief of the

section? He's a specialist on homosexuals and can

arrange everything for you.'

So I wound up handling

the case, and TARABRIN (of the First Chief Direct-

orate) said I should report to him."

the photographic technicians because of the amount of time

they spent waiting for VOLKOV to succeed in his mission, and

NOSENKO recalled that he provided them with drinks and

treated them well because they were a big help to him in

was a target of the Moscow City KGB Directorate which

Of believed WILLERFORD to be an FBI agent and had been collecting

Both of these

NOSENKO returned to Moscow from Geneva. (FRIPPEL/ arrived 06

in the Soviet Union as a

guide for some American journalists.

(NOSENKO was unable to give the composition of the journa-

list group or to recall where they stayed in Moscow

and

where else they travelled in the Soviet Union.) NOSENKO

contacted him in Moscow. to learn what questions the newsmen

intended to ask Khrushchev during a scheduled interview;

required visiting journalists to submit their intended

questions for Khrushchev in writing to Soviet authorities

prior to interviews,. After the interview, he recontacted

FRIPPELto learn the reaction of the journalists to their

Ealk with the Soviet leader.

NOSENKO could not recall their

remember that they were "satisfied".. Another reason for

Obcontacting FRIPPED, NOSENKO added in a later discussion,

was to learn whether any of the journalists might have

joined the group at the last moment in

the United States,

which might suggest intelligence connections on their part:

NOSENKO met FRIPPEL alone for the second and last time

during March 1963. Since FRIPPEL was a guide for tourists 06

aboard the ship "Olympia", which stopped for a day in valta

and Odessa, NOSENKO flew to Odessa from Moscow and accosted

FRIPPEL in the lobby of the hotel where the tourists were

having dinner.

news was that he might again be reassigned to Moscow in

twice in Odessa, while visiting the USSR in 1962 and

1963..

NOSENKO insisted that he met ERIPPEL but once 06

in Odessa and önce in Moscow in that period.

Comment:

NOSENKO volunteered his account of the FRIPPEL

He freely

related the details of the summer 1962 and

February 1963 meetings with FRIPPED in the 06

USSR.

Lee Harvey OSWALD (1959-1960)

For continuity of presentation, both periods of NOSENKO's

alleged involvement with OSWALD: in 1959-1960 and in 1963

are described elsewhere.

(See p. 303.): According to NOSENKO,

he was involved with OSWALD in 1959 because he was then

Deputy Chief of the American-British Commonwealth Section

of the Seventh Department:

In that capacity he participateu

in the decision that OSWALD was of no interest to the KGB

and he should not be allowed to remain in the Soviet Union.

Comment: NOSENKO's information on his involvement with

OSWALD in 1959 is insufficient to serve as

evidence confirming or refuting his claimed

service as Deputy Chief of the American Section

of the Seventh Department in 1959.

Operational Activities - 1955-1960: Summary

Tourist Section as a case officer. Between 1955 and 1957

he assembled a network of agents and was involved in four

KGB attempts to recruit foreign tourists.

One of these

attempts, that against Richard BURGI, was the first recruit-U6

ment of the tourist section; it won NOSENKO a commendation,

brought him to the attention of General GRIBANOV, and turned

NOSENKO into an effective and successful KGB officer.. In

1958 NOSENKO was promoted to the position of Deputy Chief

of the American-British Commonwealth Section. He then

recruited the second member of his two-man homosexual team

and, in 1958 and 1959, participated in ten KGB attempts to

recruit American and British visitors to the USSR and one

American resident of MOSCOw. NOSENKO's success in the

Seventh Department prompted

GRIBANOV to transfer him back

to the American Embassy Section as Deputy Chief with the

critical priority task of reviving KGB operations against

American Embassy code clerks.

It is worthy of note that of the fifteen cases in which

he personally participated, by his own admission, NOSENKO

became involved in nine not because they were operations of

his section, but because the targets were the victims of

homosexual or other entrapment.

In addition, three of the

fifteen operations were not directed by his section, but

by senior seventh Department officers:.

According to his

own statements, four others were specifically the responsi-

Wility of other Seventh Department sections of KGB elements

including the Foreign Seamen Section (GEHRCKENS) , Delega- Ub

06 Obtions Section (LANE and BIRSE), Commercial Representatives

06O6Section (TAYLOR), and WILLERFORD) (Moscow City KGB). FRIPPEL 06

does not relate clearly to lOSENKO's claimed Seventh

Department service:.

NOSENKO states he was also used as an

agent of the First Department Embassy Section. Even the

remaining case, that of HARRIS, was not necessarily a

Seventh Department operation: by NOSENKO's other statements,

she was not a "tourist"

and she would have been the target

of the Moscow Oblast KGB because of her intention to marry

a Soviet citizen.

While NOSENKO's participation

in the attempted recruit-

ment of the targets lie describes, even where not

confirmed,

is not disputed, the evidence suggest that he was an:

English-speaking specialist in sexual entrapment, not

counterintelligence officer responsible for the identifi

cation of foreign agents among tourists or for the develop-

ment,

recruitment, and exploitation of agents for the KGB.

Nothing NOSENKO has said indicates that there was any

material change in his duties

and responsibilities after

he was allegedly promoted to Deputy Chief of the American-

British Commonwealth Section.

The evidence is that he was

more active, but not that he had any administrative and

supervisory responsibilities.

Knowledge of other Seventh Department

American Tourist Operations

NOSENKO said that upon his return to the Seventh Depart-

ment in 1962 as Chief of the American-British Commonwealth

Section, he reviewed the section's activities during his

two-year absence, e.g. January 1960 to January 1962. In

the course of that review he made written notes of the

section's operational targets during that period notes

which he brought to Geneva in 1964. (See p• 319.) NOSENKO

could not describe the operations other than to say that he

recorded the target's names and such details as he could

acquire at the time of his review.

NOSENKO has never resolved why these cases,

More

important, he never could explain why he was

Besides those operations in which NOSENKO claimed

Deputy Chief of the American-British Commonwealth Section,

NOSENKO claimed awareness of what the KGB knew of the use

of tourists in the USSR by foreign intelligence services

throughout the 1955-1960 period.

sources serves as' a basis for judging the validity of

NOSENKO's claim.

NOSENKO's Information

NOSENKO's Tourist Study

Sometime between May and October 1959, during the

tourist season, NOSENKO was ordered to gather facts for

the period 1955 through 1958.

NOSENKO said he assembled

this material from the Seventh Department's annual reports

of the years 1955-1958, supplemented by information he

obtained from discussions with knowledgeable Seventh

Department case officers.

NOSENKO recalled only that the

study incorporated statistical data on the growth of

foreign tourism; he did not remember the content of the

study, any examples included in it, or what the study

concluded about American or British Intelligence tourist

operations.

Nevertheless, based on his research for this

study as well as on his general and supervisory responsi-

bilities in the Seventh Department, NOSENKO asserted that

he could accurately describe KGB counterintelligence

operations among tourists during the period 1955-1960.

Extent of KGB Knowledge

According to NOSENKO, operations against foreign tourists

were developing slowly during this period and very little:

was known by the KGB about the American Intelligence use

of tourism at the time he wrote the study in 1959. No.

agents were definitely identified among American tourists,

and no tourists were "caught in the act" mailing letters,

servicing deaddrops or contacting agents, with one exception.

06 (MCGUIRE sic, see below.) The Seventh Department, NOSENKO

ole on tacking vener

said, developed suspicions concerning a number of tourists

because of their apparent interest in photography, or because

they were disseminating foreign literature. The KGB never

established any firm intelligence connection, however,

despite various operational measures taken such as vyemka

(covert baggage search) and maneuvering KGB agents in

contact with the suspect tourists.

No American tourists

were definitely identified as American Intelligence agents,

NOSENKO concluded.

On related matters, NOSENKO asserted

that during his 1955-1960 service in the Seventh Department

the

KGB acquired no information regarding American Intelli-

gence use of tourism; specifically, the KGB obtained no

documentary information on this topic from any agent source.

Information Furnished the KGB by George BLAKE

In 1959 the KGB obtained from its agent in MI-6,

[George BLAKE, who was arrested by British authorities in

April 1961] the complete details of the CIA-MI-6 program for

utilizing tourist agents in the Soviet Union. In early

June 1959 a three-day conference was held in London between

CIA and MI-6 representatives, at the conclusion of which a

nineteen-page document was drawn up which described opera-

tional doctrine on tourist operations, including agent

spotting, agent selection, agent assessment, agent training,

and agent tasks planned for the current (1959) tourist

season.

The document stressed CIA planned use of tourists

for spotting, contacting, and assessing and, eventually,

communicating with agents in the Soviet Union. BLAKE

confessed to passing the document to the KGB as soon as it

came into his possession.

Comment:

It is not advanced that NOSENKO should neces-

sarily have known of BLAKE, although his

statements on the matter have been ambiguous.

Asked in 1962 whether he knew of BLAKE (whose

earlier arrest had been publicized), NOSENKO

affirmed that he did but indicated that BLAKE

was a less important source than the Canadian

Ambassador (WATKINS) or the agent in the

British Admiralty (VASSALL):

When BLAKE was

mentioned in 1964, NOSENKO asked

"Who's BLAKE?"

The

significance of BLAKE is that his

confession established that the KGB was fully

aware of the status and character of

American

and British Intelligence tourist operations

while NOSENKO alleges he was in the Seventh

Department.

It is judged, by any measure as

well as

by NOSENKO's statements about the KGB,

that the substance of the information if not

the document itself would be brought to the

attention of a key KGB counterintelligence

officer concerned, the Deputy Chief of the

American-British Commonwealth Section, which

NOSENKO claims was himself.

KGB Study of American Intelligence Tourist Operations

In 1961 CIA acquired a lengthy KGB Top Secret study on

the subject of the use of tourists by American Intelligence

for espionage and operational support in the Soviet Union:

The KGB study draws recognizably upon the information

supplied by BLAKE and, although concerned primarily with

American tourist operations in 1960, it also refers to

American agents whom KGB counterintelligence elements

identified among tourists in the years 1958 and 1959, while

NOSENKO claims he was Deputy Chief of the American-British

Commonwealth Section and during which time he claims

KGB identified no American Intelligence agents.

SEVENTH DEPARTMENT - 1955-1960: Summary and Conclusion

NOSENKO's description of the activities of the Second

Chief Directorate Seventh Department in this period is

almost solely restricted to his account of these fifteen

KGB operations.

Other than to allege that certain KGB

officers he named were his subordinates, he provided no

information to substantiate his claim that he had any

supervisory or administrative responsibilities.

The common

feature of the operations do not relate to NOSENKO's own

description of the function of the Seventh Department's

Tourist Section or later, to the American-British Common-

wealth Section.

Most were sexual or other entrapment

operations, and he acknowledges that several were operations

conducted by KGB elements other than his own section.. In

short, NOSENKO need not have been in the Seventh Department

sections, as he claims, to have learned of or participated

in the activities he describes.

Although NOSENKO gives a

graphic account of the Second Chief Directorate's (and his

own) counterintelligence mission, his knowledge is not of

counterintelligence operations among tourists; in the only

three such operations he describes, the counterintelligence

aspects were incidental.

Contrary to his claims, NOSENKO

is aware neither of all important KGB operations conducted

against American tourists during the period, nor what was

known to the KGB about American Intelligence and British

tourist operations.

Conclusion

While NOSENKO was associated with a KGB element conducting

operations against American and other foreign tourists

during the period 1955-1960, he was neither a

senior case

officer nor Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department American-

British Commonwealth Section.

CHAPTER VII

AMERICAN EMBASSY SECTION OF AMERICAN DEPARTMENT

(January 1960-January 1962)

Deputy Chief of the Section

NOSENKO claims to have served as Deputy Chief of the

American Embassy Section of the American Department, KGB

Second Chief Directorate, from sometime in January 1960

until the

first days of January 1962. This section, in

his words, was working against "the most important counter-

intelligence target in the Soviet Union", the permanent

American representation in Moscow.

It regarded every

American stationed there a possible spy and, simultaneously.

as a target

for recruitment.

The functions of the American Embassy Section were

described by NOSENKO as being to monitor all contacts by

Embassy personnel with Soviet citizens, to collect all

information possible on American Embassy employees, and

somer can enator

to use this information as a basis for planning and imple-

menting recruitments.

The Americans' personalities, jobs,

personal relationships,

weaknesses, daily routines,

security

precautions, contacts

with Soviet citizens, and the major

and minor scandals in their Moscow lives formed the basis

for this work.

To gather such information, the section's

officers employed large numbers of agents and informants

among the indigenous employees of the Embassy, Soviet

citizens moving in Embassy social circles, and third-country

nationals with American contacts. The officers also

from the reports of numerous surveillance teams

as well as information obtained from

telephone taps and microphones in Americans' offices and

homes. Each officer had a limited number of American

targets with whom he attempted to become thoroughly familiar.

Annually, they submitted detailed operational plans for

(AMERICAN EMBASSY SECTION - January 1960-January 1962)

exploiting the knowledge they had gained of their targets.

During 1960 and 1961, NOSENKO said, within the section

special emphasis was

placed on "identifying intelligence

officers in the Embassy and actively developing them,

acquiring ciphers, and painstakingly studying code clerks,

creating

the basis on which they can be recruited".

As Deputy Chief of this section, NOSENKO said, he had

access to all information concerning its activities:

"Nothing was hidden" from him.

On this basis, he expressed

certainty that in 1960 and 1961 the KGB recruited no

Americans associated with the Embassy, there were no KGB

In thin

agents among Americans assigned to the Embassy in this

period and, in fact, the KGB had recruited no American

Embassy personnel since "ANDREY" (Dayle SMITH, recruited

ca. 1953, see p. 33).

From continuing friendships with

his fellow-officers of 1960-and 1961, who remained in the

section when NOSENKO transferred, NOSENKO has also claimed

certainty that there were no KGB

recruitments from the

time he left the section in January 1962 until his January

1964 departure in Geneva.

Transfer to the American Embassy Section

In December 1959, while serving as Deputy Chief of the

American Section of

the Seventh Department, NOSENKO learned

from the Department Chief DUBAS of plans to transfer him

back to the American Department's American Embassy Section,

as Deputy Chief. NOSENKO said

he was opposed to the move

and wanted to remain in the Seventh Department:

"I was used to it there and wanted to continue.

I wanted to stay in the Seventh Department.

This

(the transfer] was no promotion.

Here I was the

Deputy Chief of section and would be the same

there. The American Department is, of course, the

most important.

But here I was working against

American tourists.

This is also important.

Furthermore, I showed [had proven] myself there in

'55, '56, '57, '58, and '59 and was considered to

be not a bad case officer.

And there, in the

American Department, I must prove myself with new

people."

NOSENKO therefore asked DUBAS to try to retain him. DUBAS

later told NOSENKO that he had twice spoken to Second Chief

Directorate Chief O. M. GRIBANOV on his behalf, but to no,

avail: In January 1960 the official orders transferring

NOSENKO were issued.

On the day NOSENKO reported to V.A. KLYPIN, Chief of

the American Department, to begin his new job, he was told

to report to GRIBANOV's office.. NOSENKO expressed his

misgivings about the change of assignment to GRIBANOV:

GRIBANOV replied that DUBAS had spoken to him but that he,

was to pay particular attention to operations against

American code clerks, the

"number one target":

Predecessor as Deputy Chief

Asked on 17 April 1964 whom he had relieved upon reporting

for duty in the American Embassy Section, NOSENKO replied:

"No one." He assumed responsibility for the Embassy security

file from KOVSHUK.

Various case officers earlier had been

responsible for Embassy Security Officer Russell LANGELLE,

including MALYUGIN, then KUSKOV, KOVSHUK, and KLYPIN; but

LANGELLE had been expelled from the Soviet Union in October

1959 and his successor, John ABIDIAN, was not to arrive

until March 1960.

On several occasions between January and June 1964 NOSENKO

hot one hut he sai

had referred to. a KGB officer named Mikhail Fedorovich

BAKHVALOV--but never in connection with the American Embassy

Section Thus, in January he first identified him as

Colonel Mikhail BAKHVALOV, the Deputy Chief of the Fifth

(Eastern Countries) Department:

In February he identified

a V.A. ALEKSEYEV as the alias of a Mikhail Fedorovich, last

name not recalled, who was Deputy Chief of the Fifth

Department:

In June, in listing KGB officers who had

received various awards for their service, NOSENKO included

the name of Mikhail BAKHVALOV, Deputy Chief of "an unremem-

bered department". of the Second Chief Directorate:

(AMERICAN EMBASSY SECTION - January 1960-January 1962)

On 18 June 1964 NOSENKO was asked to list the names of

the Seventh Department in 1955 to his return to the American

Embassy Section in 1960.

NOSENKO listed fourteen officers

as having joined the section, and five who had been trans-

ferred out. In neither list did NOSENKO mention BAKHVALOV.

A week later, however, on 24 June 1964 NOSENKO stated

that "in 1959 and possibly in 1958 Mikhail Fedorovich

BAKHVALOV was the Deputy Chief of the American Embassy

Section. I replaced him in his position in 1960 and he

went to the Fifth Department as Deputy Chief". In September

1964 NOSENKO asserted that BAKHVALOV, as Deputy Chief,

Inot

the others he had identified earlierl had been LANGELLE'S

case officer. In 1965 NOSENKO first mentioned that

BAKHVALOV, not KOVSHUK, had been responsible for maintaining

the Embassy security file and stated that BAKHVALOV had

shared with KOVSHUK responsibility for supervising code

clerk operations.

Comment:

Interrogation has never resolved contradictions

between NOSENKO's earlier accounts of what

functions he assumed from whom when he entered

the Section, and his belated assertions that

BAKHVALOV was his predecessor as Deputy Chief.

Responsibilities

Shortly after reporting. for duty in the American Embassy

Section and following his short discussion with GRIBANOV,

NOSENKO said he met with American Department Chief KLYPIN

and Embassy Section Chief KOVSHUK to discuss his responsi-

bilities and functions in the section.

Repeating what

GRIBANOV had said, KLYPIN stressed that NOSENKO's most

important single responsibility in the section would be

supervision of all KGB operational activity against American

military and State Department code clerks stationed in

MOSCOW.

As for the other Americans at the Embassy, KLYPIN

suggested a division of labor under which KovSHuk would be

responsible for supervising operations against State

Department personnel and NOSENKO would supervise work

against the Army, Air Force, and Naval Attaches and their

assistants.:

NOSENKO was also to be custodian of certain

sensitive files in the section.

NOSENKO has signed a protocol which listed his principal

responsibilities during 1960 and 1961. It reads in part:

"During the entire period in the First [American

Embassy] Section, First [American] Department in

1960 and 1961 my position was Deputy Chief of

Section. My responsibilities were the following:

-General Deputy to the Chief of the First

Section, Vladislav Mikhaylovich KOVSHUK, and

Comment:

for supervising operations against service

attache targets. In October 1966 NOSENKO

for the first time claimed he was personally.

operational activity against Naval and Marine

officers of the office of the Naval Attache.

on this subject during February

1965 were distilled in a protocol which NOSENKO signed on

20 February:

"As the only Deputy to the Chief of the American

Embassy Section, First Department, Second Chief

Directorate, KGB; Vladislav Mikhaylovich KOVSHUK,

Irom January 1960 to January 1962, one of my :

order to perform this function I had the right and

the obligation of knowing the details

about every

important activity of the section against the

American Embassy and its personnel.

No activity

of this nature was withheld from me.

"As Deputy Chief of the Section I know definitely

that no U.s. officials serving in the Embassy were

agents of the KGB or reporting unofficially in any

In the two years of NOSENKO's service in the section

there were a total of over three months when he said KOVSHUK

was ill or on leave,

NOSENKO recalled that he was Acting

Chief during KOVSHUK's two 30-day leave periods in 1960 and

1961, although he did not remember precisely in which months.

He also served as Acting Chief for about a month in the

summer of 1960 when KOVSHUK was in the KGB hospital with

heart trouble and for a week or two some time in 1961, again

when KOVSHUK was ill:. He recalled that KOVSHUK was also

absent for several days in connection with preparations for

President Eisenhower's planned visit to the Soviet Union in

1960.

As Acting Chief in KOVSHUK's absence, NOSENKO stated that

he was responsible for supervising the administrative work

and operational activity of the entire section and, in

particular, for assuming KOVSHUK's work in directing

operations

against diplomatic personnel assigned to the

American Embassy•

NOSENKO could recall no operational decisions that he

made as acting chief, nor any specific or unusual occurrences

during these times.

NOSENKO said that the only specific

responsibility of KOVSHUK's which he handled in the Chief's

about all correspondence going out of the Embassy Section.

According to NOSENKO, KOVSHUK had personal

contact, under

Ministry of Foreign Affairs cover, with "some" American

Embassy officers, but the only such Embassy officer he could

identify was WINTERS, and he knew of no details about

KOVSHUK's relations with him.

General Supervisory Duties

In interrogations of January 1965 NOSENKO was questioned

in considerable detail about his supervisory duties as

Deputy Chief of the Embassy Section. He didn't know what

major

duties occupied most of his

time, nor which were the

most important:

He stated that "everything" was important.

His subordinates were

GRYAZNOV and KOSOLAPOV (responsible

for code clerk operations), [Vladimirl DEMKIN assisted by

[Yevgeniy] GROMAKOVSKIY (residents of America House),

IN.A.] GAVRILENKO (Air Attaches personnel and the aircrews

of the Ambassador's aircraft), [I.Ya.] KURILENKO (Army

Attache personnel), and (Victor] BELOGLAZOV (Naval Attache

personnel) •

Except

for "little questions" which the

officers decided for themselves, NOSENKO said he directed

their activities, discussed with them various aspects of

their work, and responded to their questions as required.

If he could not answer their questions, NOSENKO stated, of

if the problem was not within his authority, NOSENKO

discussed the matter with KOVSHUK.

NOSENKO claimed he thereafter would discuss the matter with

American Department Chief KLYPIN or his successor, (S.M.]

FEDOSEYEV, and on some occasions, with Second Chief

Directorate Chief GRIBANOV.

NOSENKO stated he accompanied his subordinates to some

meetings with their agents, not because he didn't trust

them, but to hear for himself what the agent was reporting.

He cited as hypothetical examples occasions when DEMKIN

might relay reports from Ella UMANETS or Inga VARLAMOVA

(agents working against America House residents), reports

which NOSENKO would want to hear for himself, personally:

NOSENKO would not estimate to his interrogators what percen-

tage of Embassy Section agents he met in this fashion.

Supervisor of All Code Clerk Operations

NOSENKO said that, upon assuming responsibility for

supervising operations against American code clerks, he

found a very "difficult situation". Prior to the assignment

Of KOSOLAPOV to the American Embassy Section in late 1959,

all operations against code clerks had been handled by

MALYUGIN, but during MALYUGIN's two years of effort there

had been

no operational approaches and no successes.

When

NOSENKO took over there were no active developmental

operations against code clerks under way, he stated, and

the only agents or operational contacts being used against

them were poorly educated maids and waitresses none of

whom had accomplished anything of importance. No non-soviet

citizen agents were being used in operations against code-

room personnel.

According to NOSENKO, in January or February of 1960

GRYAZNOV was assigned to the American Embassy Section as a

second assistant to NOSENKO in his code clerk activities.

From this point on, NOSENKO; KOSOLAPOV, and GRYAZNOV shared

the same KGB Headquarters office.

American code clerks as well as the files on all agents

available for work against them, were stored in one large

safe accessible to all three officers. NOSENKO supervised

all of the section's work along these lines, and no provo-

cations, compromises, recruitment attempts,

could have been planned or carried out without his prior

knowledge and agreement when he was in Moscow.

If NOSENKO

was absent on a trip, he would have been told

about any such

activity upon his return.

NOSENKO said that he carefully directed the work of

GRYAZNOV and KOSOLAPOV during these two years, discussing

their cases with them, taking part in operational planning,

and approving or disapproving all operational measures.

GOLITSYN's Information About KGB Operations Against Embassy

Code

Clerks in 1960-1961

The most significant collateral information about KGB

operations against American code clerks in this period,

with which to compare NOSENKO's assertions lon this topic,

is that provided by GOLITSYN after his defection in 1961.

GOLITSYN identified KOSOLAPOV and GRYAZNOV by name and

from photograph as being two veteran KGB officers, personally

known to him, who were in 1960 "working against code clerks

in the American Embassy in Moscow."

With respect to the

priority attached to the recruitment of American code clerks

in 1960, GOLITSYN commented in 1961 that:

"The task of

strengthening of work against Americans had been a standing

requirement, both in the past and most particularly lin

This work was particularly intensified after the

appointment of SHELEPIN. to the KGB...

In 1960, it was

recommended in the KGB to intensify the work against the

Americans at the Embassy in Moscow, and against American

colonies

In other, countries...

This question of intensifying

work against the

Americans was up before the Collegium of

the KGB.

Thereafter there was a directive from SIIFLEPIN

regarding the intensification of work against the American

cipher-clerks."

GOLITSYN said that NOSENKO was not assigned to the Embassy

Section in 1960-1961, since if he had been GOLITSYN would

have known about it.

Preparing for his assignment to llelsinki, GOLITSYN. in

the spring of 1960 visited the Embassy Section and learned

from GRYAZNOV. that the latter had as an agent an Embassy

code clerk who was scheduled to be transferred to Helsinki.

The code clerk had already provided the KGB with

some infor-

mation and he was considered by the KGB to be a "real"

agent.

GOLIISYN was told by GRYAZNOV that, if the code clerk's

transfer materialized, GOLITSYN might have him in Helsinki

as his agent.

(AMERICAN EMBASSY SECTION - January 1960-January 1962)

GOLITSYN also learned from GRYAZNOV in spring of 1960

that the latter had developed an operation against an

Embassy military code clerk in which the KGB was "99 per

cent sure" that the target would be recruited:

GRYAZNOV informed GOLITSYN in April or May 1960 that an

American employee of the Embassy in Moscow, possibly a code

clerk, was either recruited or prepared for recruitment on

the basis of homosexual: compromise beginning in 1959 and

concluding in 1960. The KGB had photographed the American

in various homosexual acts but SHELEPIN, who had just become

homosexual blackmail was in this instance "too dirty", and

the KGB should find another basis for recruitment. SHELEPIN

did not exclude future use of the photographs, which the KGB

would hold in reserve:

While on a temporary assignment to Helsinki in November

1960, V.V. KOSOLAPOV told GOLITSYN that he had come to

Helsinki in order to accompany an Embassy code clerk back :

to Moscow on the train.

KOSOLAPOV planned to strike

up an

acquaintance with the code clerk which he could continue

to develop in Moscow. In September 1961 a friend of

KOSOLAPOV also visited Helsinki on temporary duty. GOLITSYN

tried to get him to talk about KOSOLAPOV's November train

operation, but KOSOLAPOV's friend would not discuss the

case.

GOLITSYN. reasoned that there would be no reluctance

to discuss the case if it had

been unsuccessful, and that

therefore KOSOLAPOV must have been successful in developing

the code clerk on the train or afterwards.

GOLITSYN learned in January 1961 from V.M. KÖVSHUK that

Operations Against Military Code Clerks

Comment:

According to official U.S. Government records,

Service Attaches of the Embassy in Moscow as

of 1960 shared a single cryptographic center

and a single military code clerk (except when

two code clerks overlapped during periods of

22223

turnover). The military code clerk was respon-

sible for enciphering and deciphering the

traffic of all three military services. In

practice, at least one other member of

Service Attaches' offices in Moscow held a

cryptographic clearance and was trained to

replace the regular military code clerk when

the latter was absent.

the only military code 06,8

clerk assigned to the Moscow Embassy from

February 1960 to September 1961, when his

successor, Matthew ZUJUS, arrived. (STORSBERG] Ü6

certain other sensitive activities at the

Embassy D6. HURLEY's tour in Moscow began shortly

06 before (STORSBERG's, in December 1959, and he

served there until June or July 1962.

The only other person performing official

functions in the military code room during the

1960-61 period was James KEYSERS, who arrived 06

in Moscow on 22 December 1960 and was assigned

to the office of the Air Force Medical Officer.

As a concurrent secondary assignment, KEYSERS 06

worked as a clerk-typist in the office of the

Air Attache. From February until mid-April

the joint military code room where he was in

Attempted Recruitment of STORSBERG] 06

NOSENKO's Information-1962

NOSENKO first'alluded to a KGB attempt to recruit an

unnamed American military code clerk during his initial

meeting with CIA in 1962: He was describing a new technique

(which he later claimed to be his own idea) introduced in

the 1960-1961 period to overcome the reluctance of Americans

in Moscow to develop friendships with Soviet citizens.

in: 19%0 che

Beginning in 1960 the KGB instructed "third-national"

agents

(Germans, Frenchmen; and Finns; for example) to visit the

American Club on Kropotkinskaya Naberezhnaya to cultivate

American enlisted men living there.

(GOLITSYN learned of

one such agent of NOSENKO and the KGB concluded that GOLITSYN

had reported the KGB practise to the Americans, because

foreigners no. longer were permitted to enter the America

House billets freely for dances, movies, and the like at

the club there.)

NOSENKO had recruited the agent known to

GOLITSYN in order to develop an American military code

clerk. Without identifying either the foreign agent or the

American target, NOSENKO provided further details on the

case in subsequent meetings.

Recruiting a military code clerk from the Embassy was the

American Embassy Section's "number one assignment"

• and for

a year NOSENKO was involved in an operation against such a

target almost to the exclusion of all other duties.. The

case was considered to be the "number one" case, and KGB

Chairman SHELEPIN as well as Second Chief Directorate Chief

GRIBANOV impatiently inquired as to its progress.

The target

was an American Army sergeant with about 20 years' service U8

who, the KGB learned, wanted to retire and take a position

as a code clerk with

che State Department. For the purpose U8

of developing the target, NOSENKO recruited a foreigner who

visited the USSR frequently.

The "third-national" agent was

placed in contact with the American, and they had several

drinking bouts together. After about two months; NOSENKO

instructed his agent to take the American to the

agent's

hotel room and introduce him there to a KGB female agent.

AMERICAN EMBASSY SECTION - January 1960-January 1962)

Although the girl and the American were intimate, no photo-

graphs were taken, nor were photographs taken the next time

the agent provided the American with a girl..

On the third

such occasion, however, the KGB technicians did obtain

incriminating

photographs: The foreign agent also involved

the American in an illicit currency, transaction in which

the American contributed $300 as his share to finance the

purchase and subsequent sale of some jewels. The American

was allowed to believe that he earned a $5,000 profit:

the

money was actually furnished by the KGb.

After a year's develöpment, GRIBANOV decided that a

recruitment

should be attempted, through another foreigner.

The original foreign agent was withdrawn from the operation,

and a KGB officer, Nikolay Semenovich SKVORTSOV, was

introduced to the American in the guise of wealthy French

businessman "Marcel MICHAUD" • SKVORTSOV/MICHAUD met and

drank with the American several times, "even at America

House": It was SKVORTSOV's estimate that the American was

very careful, but that he might be susceptible to recruitment

while drunk.

After meeting with the American at the club in

America House one evening SKVORTSOV telephoned him and

invited him to SKVORTSOV's hotel room to meet "two Dutch

girls"

When he arrived, SKVORTSOV explained that the girls

had refused to come;

but that he could call another girl for

the American. The girl [identified by NOSENKO in 1964 as

Inga VARLAMOVA] was a KGB agent of GRYAZNOV's who was used

for such operations, and she and the American were intimate

in SKVORTSOV's hotel room.

In an adjacent: room were GRIBANOV,

NOSENKO, KOVSHUK, and another KGB officer. In another

adjacent room were technicians of the Operational Technical

Directorate, who taped the American's conversations. when

the American left SKVORTSOV's room" at two o'clock in the

morning, he was "very tipsy". NOSENKO and another officer

Intercepted him in the hallway, escorted him into the adjacent

room, and locked the door. NÖSENKO himself solicited the

American's collaboration with the KGB in exchange

$20,000 in cash (which was offered in two packages of $10

notes) and the promise of additional sums. When the American

refused, the KGB officers disclosed their knowledge of his

plan to transfer to the State Department. They threatened

to inform the Embassy that he had collaborated with the KGB,

in which case he would get neither the cash nor the job with

the State Department, The American was adamant in his

refusal, although he was held in the hotel room all night

long.

At about six o'clock in the morning the KGB officers

received a telephoned report that the Embassy Marine guard

had called America House to advise that the American. was

needed at the Embassy because an enciphered telegram had

arrived.

The American was then released.

The KGB "knew" that the American did not report the

recruitment attempt.

Using that circumstance for blackmail

rather than the incriminating photographs, the KGB planned

another attempt to recruit him if he ever returned abroad.

When the non-soviet agent used in the first year of

developing the American target had come to the attention of

GOLITSYN, GOLITSYN visited the Embassy Section to see if he

could use him in First Chief Directorate operations abroad.

NOSENKO was on leave at the time, but GOLITSYN talked with

another Embassy Section officer.

GOLITSYN was told "Don't

touch him, he's ours". [The relevance of this incident is

discussed below.]

NOSENKO's Information-1964

At the second 'meeting with CIA in Geneva in 1964, NOSENKO

identified the American military code clerk as "Jim" Vt

STORSBERG.

The foreign agent NOSENKO recruited for the

case was (Johannes PREISFREUND (KGB cryptonym "PROKHOR"),

Finn!! In repeating the substance of his 1962 account of

the KGB recruitment attempt, NOSENKO emphasized his personal

role in directing both PREISFREUND and the KGB officer

SKVORTSOV/MICHAUD.

06

GRIBANOV and KOVSHUK, not NOSENKO, actually made the

recruitment attempt..

NOSENKO was not present; he waited

outside the room with GRYAZNOV. Neither did NOSENKO recruit

C6 PREISFREUND.

The latter was recruited by KOVSHUK "who

needed credit for the recruitment" although NOSENKO had

initially cultivated the Finn.!! Under KOVSHUK's orders,

NOSENKO served as (PREISFREUND' &6 case officer, although

KOVSHUK accompanied him to operational meetings with the

non-soviet girls. NOSENKO was in the hotel and he had

made arrangements with the KGB Operational Technical

Directorate to call at once if audio coverage of the American

Embassy indicated anything which might affect the recruitment

attempt.

While NOSENKO waited outside the room; GRIBANOV attempted

Ob to recruit (STORSBERG) on ideological grounds; his proposal

During the 1964 interrogations NOSENKO had been vague as

to the timing ana sequence of events in the STORSBERG opera-O6

any other operation he described, stating he could no longer

be sure when any particular incident occurred. Questioned

again about the STORSBERG case in October 1966, NOSENKO

insisted that he had directed the entire operation from

beginning to end, and that it was his most important case.

At his interrogator's insistence, he provided the following

PREISFREUND finally admitted, however, that he had been

involved in a KGB operation against STORSBERG and he agreed Ub

to tell "the entire truth". His version of the case, while

containing some internal contradictions, only partially

coincided with that provided by NOSENKO. (PREISFREUND 06

claimed to be hazy on the date of all events connected with

his

contacts with the KGB: The dates, however, could be

reconstructed from the known dates of otherwise related events

which he said occurred about the time he was recruited or

0o first met STORSBERGor last visited the America House, and

so forth.] He described being recruited by KOVSHUK, first

dating the event as at the end of 1959 or the beginning of

1960, and later as March-April 1960. According to PREIS- U6

FREUND, he was

"cultivated" neither by NOSENKO or by KOVSHUK.

The first time he met either was when he was confronted and

recruited by KOVSHUK under threat of prosecution for black-

market dealings.

[NOSENKO is unaware of that feature of

PREISFREUND's recruitment.] On NOSENKO's and KOVSHUK's

instructions, about six months after PREISFREUND's recruit-06

ment, he became acquainted with STORSBERG, and in the summer 06

of 1960 on one occasion he lured /STORSBERG into intimacy with 06

a female KGB agent (earlier identified by NOSENKO) in his

hotel room.

He never

saw STORSBERG again; nor did he 00

participate in any other KGB operations:

girl shared his bed. At one point during the evening he

glimpsed NOSENKO in the hallway, wearing a rubber apron.

He deduced from this that NOSENKO had been involved in

surreptitious photography of(STORSBERG and the girl.

room. He

has never

said anything to suggest,

however, that he ever personally was involved

claimed any competence in clandestine photo-

Before his last meeting with CIA, PREISFREUND mentioned

that he was planning to visit Leningrad with his family,

but that he had learned from business contacts in Moscow

that Soviet authorities suspected him of complicity in

NOSENKO's defection.

He was apprehensive and particularly

concerned that the KGB might suspect that he had related

nis role in the STORSBERG case to American Intelligence. 06

During his final meeting with CIA on 13 July 1965LPREIS- 06

FREUND asked his interviewers for advice as to whether he

should or should not travel to the USSR. He was told that

if the situation was as he described, it could be quite

Moscow and had involved him in speculatory activities and

lured him into intimacy with various female KGB agents.

According

to KOVSHUK, the recruitment was accomplished "in

1960, at the end of 1960"; PREISFREUND "had helped to create06

the circumstances" and had been withdrawn from the operation

before the actual, approach, which was made by KGB officers.

The American target of PREISFREUND, from what KOVSHUK relatede6

to GOLITSYN, was either a code clerk or diplomat..

(GOLITSYN

later expressed his personal belief that the individual

probably was unmarried and might have been a "military

man".)

Comment:

06

but to

some other_American code clerk against whom

PREISFREUND was used, NOSENKO's claim to have

supervised all such code clerk operations is

refuted.

Attempted Recruitment of STORSBERG:

Summary and Conclusion

In the absence of contrary evidence, it is judged that

GOLITSYN's lead refers tö STORSBERG. 06 The role of PREISFREUND 06

is the key to this determination.

While the time of the

operation remains

in dispute, GOLITSYN's timing is judged to

be the most plausible because of the circumstances under

which he acquired his information.

These circumstances--

GOLITSYN's visit to and discussion with KOVSHUK in Moscow,

about the use of PREISFREUND are confirmed by NOSENKO and 06

the date, January 1961; is established by passport informa-

tion. It follows that the operation against (STORSBERG] thus 06

would have taken

place more than six months prior to the time

NOSENKO and STORSBERG claimed.

Such a significant inaccuracy 06

by NOSENKO, about an event which he said took place less

than a year before he described it to CIA (in June 1962),

undermines his claim to the role he played in the case and

hence to his position as Deputy Chief of the American Embassy

Section and supervisor of code clerk operations:

O6 1963, ZUJUS confirmed an Embassy Security Öffice report

that

in the summer of 1962(ZUJUS) had been intimate with an Ob

Austrian woman; "Lillian" (last name unknown), who had

visited America House with someone from the United arab

Republic and had returned alone a few days later, when she

was picked up by ZuJuS. since ZuJus]was a cryptographer, 06

the America House manager interviewed "Lillian" and learned

that she claimed to be from Vienna änd to be travelling with

her employer, a Czech.:: When the Embassy Security Officer

learned from the Austrian Embassy that no Austrian passport

had been issued to "Lillian", he asked her for her passport.

She replied that she had forgotten it and then left, saying

she

was going to her

hotel for the passport. She

Operations Against State Department Code Clerks

KGB operations against code clerks, for which NOSENKO

claimed supervisory responsibility, included those directed

against State Department cryptographic personnel as well as

military cryptographers at the Embassy.

In several such

cases, NOSENKO's claimed subordinate, KOSOLAPOV, figures

prominently

Development of Paul JENNER 06

NOSENKO first mentioned the (JENNER case in a 1964

interview with the FBI, when he was asked whether he had

ever heard of a case within recent years in which KOSOLAPOV

had travelled to Helsinki, to intercept and establish contact

with

an American code clerk. NOSENKO "immediately recalled"

such

an incident which happened in 1960-1961.

He explained

that because Embassy code clerks were not sufficiently

accessible to the KGB after they arrived in Moscow, it was

decided to send KOSOLAPOV to Helsinki as part of an effort

to probe for a new way to get in touch with the code clerks.

According to NOSENKO, KOSOLAPOV made but one trip to Helsinki

in this new effort, and it was not tried again by others.

NOSENKO identified KOSOLAPOV's target in this operation as

Paul JENNER.

NOSENKO'S Information

06

A month before JENNERs arrival in Moscow the Embassy

Section received a copy Of JENNER's anketa (visa application) O

listing his diplomatic title as Secretary Archivist anc

indicating when he was to enter the Soviet Union from

Finland by train "at the beginning of 1960, in the middle of

the month". Believing him to be a code clerk (he was

subsequently found to be a pouch clerk)y"the group" decided

to send KOSOLAPOV to Helsinki with the mission of accompanying

JENNER\on the train to Moscow to study JENIER's behavior. Ub

JENNER and KOSOLAPOV were about the same ame

A proposal for the operation was prepared for the approvai

of the KGB Chairman which explained that code clerks were

assigned to Moscow usually only for one year ithus limiting

their accessibility to the KGB for development) and that it

was necessary to attempt to place an agent near them even

before they arrived in Moscow.

When the Chairman's approval

was granted, NOSENKO prepared the kharakteristika (official

form) on KOSOLAPOV for the trip and gave it to the Personnel

Office. KOSOLAPOV wrote a cable for Helsinki explaining that

he was coming for two or three days. NOSENKO didn't sign the

cable, but read it, and it was taken to KLYPIN for his signa-

ture and thereafter KOSOLAPOV took it to the Second (European)

Department of the First Chief Directorate for release.

was no other correspondence with the Helsinki rezidentura

concerning the operation before KOSOLAPOV departed Moscow.

NOSENKO discussed the plan with GRYAZNOV and KOSOLAPOV and

"maybe" they discussed it with KOVSHUK the day before

KOSOLAPOV left.

KOSOLAPOV had (JENNER's photograph and h1s06

name, and expected that the Helsinki residency could obtain

a ticket for KOSOLAPOV. on (JENNER's train.0 NOSENKO did not

recall precisely when KOSOLAPOV left Moscow or under what

name he travelled. KOSOLAPOV was gone for about a week and

he travelled both ways by train.

Although the KGB later discovered that JENNER)was not a

code clerk but a pouch clerk, he remained

a target for

development. Since he did not telephone "SOLISTKA" after

one or two months, the KGB arranged for her to encounter

him at the railroad station or airport when he went alone to

meet the couriers. JENNER saw her but did not approach her,

turning away.

The KGB took no further steps to cultivate

JENNER,

The

KGB "had nothing on JENNERJat all except a0b

On 26 October 1966 MOSENKO confirmed the identification

of other CIA sources by identifying a photograph as

that of

Vadim Viktorovich KOSOLAPOV, [born in Perm, 19 February 1928]

his former subordinate of the Embassy Section. The photo-

graph shown NOSENKO was that of one Victor Dmitriyevich

acknowledged that that data accurately refiected KÖSOLAPOV! s

alias, cover, and itinerary during his trip to Helsinki

to

On 26: October 1966 NOSENKO was confronted with the Finnish

train manifest showing that Paul JENNER]was the single 06

passenger departing Helsinki for Moscow on 31 March 1960

and that KOSOLAPOV/KOLOSOV travelled on 2. April on a train

carrying no Americans.

Repeating the substance of the KGB

operation and citing his recollection from reading KOSOLAPOV's

report of the trip. NOSENKO insisted that KOSOLAPOV travelleo

on the same train with JENNER and that the Finnish manifests

must be in error. [See

accompanying exhibits.]

(JENNER's Information

After arriving in Moscow on 1 April 1960 JENNER reported

that he was approached on the train from Helsinki by two

young Russians, "a boy and a girl; probably university

"Yuliya" explained that

I. Ye. SERGEVEV, a KGB officer and the Soviet Consul in

Helsinki, contacted

the chief of the Helsinki police on

1631 March 1960 to ask his assistance in locating an American

named (Paul E. JENNER, wilo was due to arrive in Helsinki

the day before. SERGEYEV explained that he had some

"business" with [JENNER, but he did not specify its nature.

Reportedly, this was the first time that SERGiVEV had made

such a request of the police chief. GOLITSVN identified

the Helsinki police chief as a Soviet intelligence agent

JINNER:

Summary and Conclusion

NOSENKO's version of the JENNER case in some degree

resembles less

the facts about (JENHER than IGD activities Ov

directed against John GARLAND (see below), activities which

NOSENIO asserts never occurred. GARLAND, not GENNER 0S

travelled on the same train as KOSOLAPOV, and GARLAND, not 06

JENNER, travelled "in the middle of the month".

Residency's query to the Helsinki police chief about (JENNER) Uo

indicates that KOSOLAPOV's cable contained information about

06

JENNER,: not just notice that KOSOLAPOV was coming to Helsinki.

It was at the airport in Moscow, not on the train, that

"SOLISTKA" gave JENNER her telephone number, an event which

Ob wait for JENNER to call. Finally, NOSENKO is unaware of the

actions OF KGB agents who were employed as maids by JENNER. O6

From the foregoing it is concluded that NOSFNKO was neither

KOSOLAPOV's supervisor, nor in this instance, supervisor of

all KGB operations against American code clerks.

NOSENKO's Information

employed by the American Embassy in Moscow who were of

interest for various reasons to the KGB. He gave a short

06

statement concerning each of the twenty, among which was

GARLAND, about whom NOSENKO said, "Code clerk, but nothin

Later asked to review the list and supply any

additional information he might have, NOSENKO stated that

Obthe KGB was studying GARLAND like the other code clerks, to

gather enough incriminating material to make a recruitment.

NOSENKO did not recall any

he had read the KGB file on GARLAND, "but he thought he must

have read reports concerning him as they came into the

Embassy Section.

There was no operational plan drawn up

Obfor GARLAND] because the KGB developed no derogatory infor-

mation concerning him; no recruitment thus was ever planned

or attempted.

NOSENKO could recall no background informa-

tion concerning GARLAND, such as his travels and acquain-

tances while stationed in Moscow.

Confronted in October 1966 with the evidence (see below]

Of KOSOLAPOV's trip to Helsinki to accompany GARLAND back Ulo

Ob GARLAND's Information

GARLAND was first interviewed on 17 July 1962 by the

Regional Security Officer in Moscow as

' a result of the

Gotten dead. see belowl:

In this interview GARLAND denied 06

having met any Soviet of KOSOLAPOV's physical description

during the Helsinki-to-Moscow train trip and also denied

having been approached by soviet Intelligence.

On 30 July

06 1963 GARIAND was interviewed by the FBI and on 31 July he

was given a polygraph examination. The latter; according

06-

to the FBI, "disclosed no information indicating that

GARLAND was deceptive in his statements to us denying any

association with Vadim Viktorovich KOSOLAPOV or denying ever

knowingly being contacted by any foreign intelligence agent"

GARLAND, by his own statement, took the

train on 16 November

1960 from Helsinki to Moscow, to assume the duties as

supervisor of the state department code room in the Embassy:

GOLITSYN'S Information

about the case on which he had helped KOSOLAPOV. From the

GOLITSYN concluded that

it must have resulted in

a success-

Information From Other Sources

KOSOLAPOV arrived by train in Helsinki on 12 November 1960.

NOSENKO's denial of the facts of the GARLAND]case is fatal

necessarily know of any operations mounted against Embassy

code clerks.

compromise the American.

On 11 June 1962 NOSENKO was asked

whether he had foreign (non-Russian) agents working against

the American Embassy, and he replied that he himself

introduced the idea

of using

such agents to develop

Americans afraid of becoming involved with Russian girls.

He had several such agents, he said, and

he sometimes asked

the East German and Polish

security

services to supply him

with such agents.

As an example, NOSENKO cited the case

of a Marine guard and a code clerk from the Embassy who

travelled to Warsaw.

The code clerk was intimate with a

Polish female agent, whom NOSENKO had planted in their

train compartment, on the train to Warsaw, and later in

MOSCOW.

In an FBI interview on 24 February 1964 NOSENKO

were mentioned, he immediately identified them as the men

involved.

Interesting or useful.

SARWAT EL SHAZLY, an Egyptian employed at the Egyptian

Embassy and an agent of the Sixth (Underdeveloped Countries)

Department of the KGB Second Chief Directorâte, visited

America House and met MORONE, but he reported nothing of

value that NOSENKO recalled. 06

Pietro CECCHI, an Italian cook at the American Embassy

and KOSOLAPOV's agent, reported everything he heard or saw

about Americans to KOSOLAPOV, but NOSENKO recalled nothing

In early 1960 GRYAZNOV went to East Berlin to obtain two

German women who could be used against the residents of

America House.. One of these, Hanna, a blonde, was documented

as a West German. NOSENKO never met her but instructed

PRETSFREUND (see the STORSBERG) Case) to take her to America

House and leave her on her own. Hanna went several times to

America House in 1961, but NOSENKO can recall nothing that

she may have reported on MORONE! The second East German

manner, the KGB learned that MORONE was planning to go on

leave in Warsaw. NOSENKO, KOSOLAPOV, and GRYAZNOV thereupon

decided to employ a Polish female agent in an attempt to

compromise him.

KOSOLAPOV wrote the draft of the operational

plan for the attempt, which was approved by GRIBANOV after

some editing by NOSENKO and KOVSHUK. KOSOLAPOV next met

witil a Polish UB counterintelligence officer in KGB Head-

quarters to discuss the plan.

The Pole was told that the

target was an American Embassy employee, but not that he

was a code clerk; this fact was deliberately kept from the

Poles:

As a result of this meeting, a Polish girl was obtained

by the Polish UB and sent to Moscow by train.

Upon her

arrival she was met by KOSOLAPOV, who took her to a Moscow

hotel where he gave ner instructions concerning her role

in the operation. The girl was told to meet MORONE on the 06*

train, flirt with him, have him fall in love with her,

continue the association, and study him.

She was to tell

him that she had been in loscow as a guest of her uncle, a

member of the Polish Trade Representation in Moscow, and

that she could meet nim again on her next visit.

Arrangenents were made with the KGB Operational Technical

Directorate for a technician to be placed on the train in

the compartment next to that of MORONEjand his companion, Ob

Ob BEGGS, for audio and visual (but not protographic) coverage:

NOSENKO did not recall when MORONE and BEGGS left 4oscow:

The Polish agent did, however, succeed in naking MORONEY's U8

acquaintance, and the technician from the Operational Direc-

torate reported back to NOSENKO the day after the train

reached Warsaw. The technician told NOSENKO the girl had

engaged in sexual intercourse with MORONE during the trip.ol

The technician also reported that the tape recordings ob-

tained were of poor quality.

Comment:

At this juncture in NOSENKO's interrogation

ne was reminded that he was en route to Cuba

on 15 November 1960 and did not return to

Moscow until mid-December, and that State

Department records indicated tnat MORONE and b

BEGGS left Moscow on 13 November and arrived

on the following day... NOSENKO responded that

report and had seen "the film strips" after

his return from Cuba, NOSENKO, it will be

noted, had said earlier that there was no

photographic coverage of MORONS's train

compartment.

06

Because the KGB still lacked compromising materials,

KOSOLAPOV prepared a paper requesting that the girl again

be brought to Moscow and permission to acquire compromising

photography during her visit. The requests were approved

by higher KGB authority.

When the girl arrived, KOSOLAPOV

met her alone and took

her to the Hotel Peking, to a

room two of three times, during which photographs were taken.

These were placed in the KGB's file on MORONE]. Ohe did not

fall in love with the girl, as the KGB had hoped, and she

had no further contacts with him.

Although the KGB had the compromising photography, it

was felt that there were insufficiently incriminating to

attempt to recruit MORONE. The KGB wanted to trap him in

the apartment of a Soviet woman, to catch him in something

that was definitely prohibited.

For this purpose, Svetlana

IVANOVA (see above) was supposed to lure MORONE) out of 06

America House to somewhere in Moscow, but before anything

further could be done, the Americans ordered MORONE] out of06

Moscow before the end

of his tour, possibly because they

were concerned about his association with IVANOVA. There-

fore, NOSENKO said, the

KGB made no attempt to recruit

MORONE 06

NOSENKO has also plailed

(to the FBI) that no attempt

was made. to recruit MORONE because Khrushchev instructed

the KGB to refrain from any action which might affect the

improvement in relations which the Soviets sought with the

United States.

MORONE's Information

receive to cense formation abe, oR was misst 06

interviewed about the allegation in May I961:

On 19 August

1961 he was transferred from Moscow.

In an October 1962

security interview, MORONE stated that he had travelled with Ob

06 Frank BEGGS to Warsaw on 12 November 1960. On the train

he saw a Polish girl outside their compartment and asked her

what languages she spoke. Later she entered his compartment,

and when he tried to engage her in sexual relations, she

slapped his face. A day or two after they arrived in warsaw;

tne girl contacted him at his hotel, and he went to her room

where they had sexual relations. According to MORONE, heUt

had sexual relations with at least two other women while in

briarsaw. He and BEGGS returned to Moscow without incident.

On 6 February 1961, after MORONE had returned to Moscow D

the

Polish girl from the train called him at America House,

and

the following day he visited her in her room at the

Peking Hotel, where they were again intimate. On either

this or an earlier occasion the girl told him that she had

an uncle in Moscow. MORONE has denied being approached of

recruited by soviet intelligence.

Information From Other Sources

A sensitive Polish source reported in 1961 that on

8 November 1960 a Polish female, an experienced English-

speaking agent of the Polish UB, arrived in Moscow where

She was met by a KGB case officer named "VOLODYA". She

stayed at the Hotel Warsaw in Moscow. The KGB case officer,

Operation Against MORONE:

Summary and Conclusion

He is apparently unaware

of information known to KGB agents (and hence to the KGB) ,

Obsuch as MORONEl's sexual involvements with IVANOVA's friends

and at SARWAT EL SHAZLY's apartment, his illicit currency

dealings with CECCHI, and his relationship with UMANETS.

Obe errs in relating to MORONE the East German female agent

sent to America House:

the incident occured, bút later,

Obwhen MORONE was no longer in Moscow nor was NOSENKO himself

still in the Embassy Section. (See p. 183.) The KGB did

not lack a sufficient basis for attempting to recruit

MORONE if it refrained from the attempt, it was for other

KGB inaction did not relate to Khrushchev's concern

for Soviet-United States relations; this was the period

between the U-? incident (May 1960) and the Berlin crisis

(August 1961) ..

Even

with respect to the Polish UB agent, there is

persuasive evidence that neither NOSENKO nor KOSOLAPOV

played the roles NOSENKO described:

NOSENKO was travelling

to Cuba and KOSOLAPOV was in Finland in connection with the

GARLAND case.

It is concluded from the foregoing that NOSENKO, in this

instance, was not supervisor of all KGB operations against

American code clerks nor would he necessarily have known of

recruitments among Embassy personnel.

Other KGB Targets Among State Department Code Clerks

In connection with his responsibility for directing

KGB operations against American code clerks in 1960-1961,

NOSENKO has commented on five other State Department code

clerks who served in Moscow during that period.: Their brief

treatment in this paper reflects not their unimportance but

to which information provided by NOSENKO accurately reflects

the KGB's knowledge of each target.

Maurice ZWANG 06

06

NOSENKO identified ZIANG as a State Department Code

clerk who was "actively worked on"

during the 1960-1961

period, An Egyptian agent, name not recalled, introduced

O6. ZWANG to a female KGB agent in an attempt to obtain incrimi-

nating photographs, but the female did not like ZWANG and U6

refused his sexual

advances.

In January 1962 (when NOSENKO

claims he left the Embassy Section) the KGB was engaged in

no activity against ZWANG Do The KGB agents had no agents

in contact with him,

and had no information indicating

ZWANG was vulnerable.

Comment:

In connection with a State Department security

interview conducted after ZWANG returned from Ok

MOScOw! WANG related that in March or April

1961 an Egyptian introduced him to a Soviet

female whom he visited in her apartment on

several occasions but with whom he was not

NOSENKO originally identified CAFFEYJas a military

enlisted man in Moscow during the 1960-1961 perioa, and an

operational target of DEMKIN. In February 1965, however,

he identified him as a State Department code clerk for whom

the responsible case officer was KOSOLAPOV, whom NOSENKO

supervised.

Moscow using Svetlana IVANOVA, the maid in America House

Supervisor of all Code Clerk Operations:

Summary and Conclusion

According to

NOSENKO, on transfer to the Embassy Section,

operations against the American code clerks were the Section's

priority task and thus his most important single responsibility

He asserts to be complete his awareness of

what was known to the KGB on this topic at the time, because

of his senior position, his personal review of relevant files

and correspondence, his personal direction of KOSOLAPOV and

GRYAZNOV, and his personal participation in their operations.

Nithout exception, in every one of the cases NOSENKO describes

there are facts substantially at variance with his account,

in direct proportion to the amount of collateral information

available.

Conclusion

From the foregoing it is concluded that he was neither

Deputy Chief of the Embassy Section nor supervisor of all

operations against American code clerks. Consequently,

he would not necessarily have known of recruitments among

other Embassy personnel.

John ABIDIAN

Comment:

John V. ABIDIAN served as the Embassy Security

Officer in Moscow from 2 March 1960 until

February 1962, approximately the same period as

NOSENKO's claimed service in the Embassy

Section of the American Department. The State

Department replacement for CIA officer Russell

LANGELLE, ABIDIAN was coopted by CIA to perform

a number of operational

tasks, including

performing clandestine letter mailings to CIA

agents inside the

Soviet Union and servicing

deaddrop emergency communications from CIA

source GRU Colonel O.V. PENKOVSKIY.

ABIDIAN studied in Paris in 1949-50 and then

secured employment with the Department of State

as a clerk/typist.

He remained in Paris until

1954• After special training at the CIC school

at Fort Holabird and the Secret Service school,

ABIDIAN served from 1956 until leaving for

Moscow in 1960 as a special agent in the State

Department's Office of Security.

A large part

of his work in this period was accompanying

foreign dignitaries visiting the United States,

including Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov in

November 1956, Mikoyan in the spring of 1959,

and Khrushchev at the end of 1959:

duties brought ABIDIAN into contact with KGB

officers stationed in New York and Washington

as well as among the Soviet delegations.

One

of the members of the Khrushchev entourage was

KOSOLAPOV, NOSENKO's subordinate in the Embassy

Section,

During his 1962 meetings with CIA, NOSENKO mentioned

ABIDIAN in several instances, identifying him as the Embassy

Security Officer and as "a CIA officer" and describing his

letter-mailing activities. His knowledge of ABIDIAN was

attributed to his claimed position of Deputy Chief of the

Embassy Section.

After recontacting CIA in Geneva in 1964 NOSENKO for the

first time explicitly claimed to have been the KGß case

officer responsible for ABIDIAN in Moscow and for the first

time described ABIDIAN's alleged servicing of a deaddrop in

1960. NOSENKO has described ABIDIAN since 1964 as the sole

American for whom NOSENKO was personally accountable during

his 1960-1961 Embassy Section service, and one of the most

important counterintelligence targets of the Embassy Section

and therefore of the entire Second Directorate.

then expected in the near future.

ABIDIAN was to be the

only American

target for whom NOSENKO personally was officially

accountable while he served in this section. KOVSHUK gave

NOSENKO such information as the section had on ABIDIAN.

Included was ABIDIAN's visa application, the negative results

of checks of KGB Headquarters files, and a report prepared

by the American Department of the First Chief Directorate.

According to that report, which was based on correspondence

from the KGB Legal Residencies in the United States, ABIDIAN

had served as a Department of State Security Officer concerned

with the safety of Premier Khrushchey when he visited the

United States in 1959; from ABIDIAN's behavior at that time,

the Legal Residencies concluded he was an intelligence officer,

probably with CIA.

That report and the fact that ABIDIAN was

replacing the known CIA officer Russell LANGELLE as Security

Officer, made

ABIDIAN one of the most important counter-

intelligence targets of the Embassy Section and therefore

of the entire Second Chief Directorate.

NOSENKO personally opened the KGB file on ABIDIAN and

later adopted for him the cryptonym "ARSEN" used earlier by

personnel of the Seventh (Surveillance) Directorate of the

Second Chief Directorate.

NOSENKO waS

unsuccessful in his attempts to learn more

about the life and career of ABIDIAN.

He visited the Chief

of the American Department of the KGB First Chief Directorate,

but that unit had no information not included in its original

report.

NOSENKO requested that the KGB Legal Residencies in

the United States be asked for further details, but none were

ever

received NOSENKO thus never learned of ABIDIAN's

education and study abroad, date of entry into the Department

of state, promotions, personal rank, previous assignments,

military service,

•Or

Prior to ABIDIAN's arrival in Moscow, the KGB decided not

to work aggressively against him with agent contacts or

provocateurs unless he first demonstrated some personal

It was considered better to concentrate on

surveillance coverage in the hope that, as LANGELLE's

successor, he might lead "to another POPOV"

IPOPOV, a

GRU Lieutenant Colonel and CIA agent, according to KGB

sources was apprehended in 1959.1

Because ABIDIAN was considered to be a CIA officer, he

was made a "special target" of surveillance from the date of

his arrival. He was always under 24-hour surveillance by

at least two and often three KGB teams, so that at any hour :

a team was available to cover him if he left the Embassy.

The only time this intensity of coverage might have been

reduced, NOSENKO

said, was during a period of about one and

one-half months

in 1961, when surveillance of the Embassy

was generally reduced in order to allow increased coverage

of British targets in connection with the PENKOVSKIY case.

As the responsible case officer, NOSENKO directed the

surveillance of ABIDIAN and evaluated the operational

possibilities offered by information from surveillance

reports.

In line with the emphasis on surveillance, the opera-

tional plan for ABIDIAN written by NOSENKO in October 1960

called for no direct action but specified that:

-ABIDIAN's maid Tatyana FEDOROVICH, an "operational

contact" of the Embassy Section, was to continue to apply

metka to ABIDIAN's clothing and

"NEPTUNE-80" to his shoes.

(According to NOSENKO, these are surveillance aids. Metka

is a "thief powder" applied to clothing pockets, leaving a

trace on anything with which it comes into contact.

primary purpose is to aid in the detection of operational

letters mailed by suspected foreign intelligence officers

and agents.

NEPTUNE-80, applied to a target's shoes,

leaves a trace on the ground which the KGB even long

after-

wards can follow with a dog.)

The only item of information

received from FEDOROVICH was that ABIDIAN was having an

affair with an Embassy female employee. FEDOROVICH was

unable to find personal mail or personal papers in ABIDIAN's

apartment

-Pietro CECCHI, Embassy employee and KOSOLAPOV' s

agent, was to try to cultivate ABIDIAN and report whatever

he learned concerning him. CECCHI never obtained any

significant information on ABIDIAN's personal life.

"ABIDIAN was developing CECCHI as an informant on American

personnel at the Embassy", but NOSENKO did not recall any

specific report CECCHI gave to

ABIDIAN that was

of interest

to the Embassy Section.

-Two Embassy chauffeurs were to apply NEPTUNE-80 to

the floorboards and foot pedals of ABIDIAN's car if

necessary.

-Surveillance teams were to be instructed to check all

places where ABIDIAN might be mailing letters.

-Coverage of ABIDIAN's mail was to be continued.

for Embassy personnel, was an agent handled by Embassy Section

case officer GAVRILENKO. ABIDIAN took "only several" Russian

language lessons from GROMAKOVA and NOSENKO did not know

whether these were private or class lessons.:.

He learned

nothing of operational significance from GROMAKOVA's contacts

with ABIDIAN, and there was no regular

reporting from her.

Comment:

Although he had earlier identified GROMAKOVA as

a KGB agent, NOSENKO never associated her with

ABIDIAN intil told that ABIDIAN had been one of

her students. In actuality ABIDIAN took

regular language lessons from GROMAKOVA, normally

three one-half hour lessons per week, from

shortly after his arrival until his departure

from Moscow.

The second KGB agent, "KAMO", was an agent of the Moscow

City KGB organization who met ABIDIAN at the Baku Restaurant

by accident. When informed that ABIDIAN gave "KAMO" his

telephone number, NOSENKO recommended that "KAMO" try to

develop a relationship with ABIDIAN.

After arguing that

this was against the policy of taking no aggressive or

provocative action against ABIDIAN, KOVSHUK and KLYPIN

finally agreed, and

"KAMO" phoned ABIDIAN twice on KGB

instructions.

ABIDIAN, however, refused to meet him, and

no further action was taken. [See below for ABIDIAN's

account of a similar incident, but one which occurred in

Armenia.]

NOSENKO did not know the room number of ABIDIAN's office

in the Embassy or on what floor it was located, but he could

have checked, if necessary, with a copy of the

Embassy tele-

phone list published monthly, since it contained the office

room number of each American employee. [The Embassy telephone

list contained apartment, but not office room numbers.]

ABIDIAN's office was in the "Zone of Security" (i.e., secure

office areas). NOSENKO said that a report from an agent

(identity not recalled) indicated that there was a sign on

ABIDIAN's office door which said "Security Office". [There

was no. such sign.] • NOSENKO was unable to determine if

ABIDIAN had a secretary. No dictation was monitored in

ABIDIAN's office because no KGB microphone was installed

there.

[In 1964 a microphone, albeit then inoperative, was

found in the room occupied in

1960-1961 by ABIDIAN.] NOSENKO

recalled no particularly interesting or important information

about ABIDIAN obtained from other microphones in the Embassy.

NOSENKO did not know the location of ABIDIAN's apartment

in the Embassy building, nor how it was furnished, since

"data of this nature was not operationally significant

unless the target had shown vulnerabilities or was under

active development".

Aware that ABIDIAN travelled from the USSR two or three

times while stationed in Moscow, NOSENKO did not know to

which countries he went or the time of year when the trips

were made.

Such information would have been of interest to

him as ABIDIAN's case officer since, like LANGELLE's earlier

trips abroad, ABIDIAN's trips were presumed to be for

operational purposes.

However, there was no possibility for

the KGB to find out where ABIDIAN had gone; even if the

Embassy Section did establish where ABIDIAN would travel,

nothing could be done about it because the foreign Legal

Residencies of the KGB First Chief Directorate "would not

accept a request for operational action against an American

diplomat coming from Moscow".

With reference to whether the KGB could have photographed

ABIDIAN's passport on his return to Moscow, NOSENKO said

that the Second Chief Directorate does not photograph pass-.

ports of foreign diplomats entering the Soviet Union. Mhile

this procedure would not be impossible, it was

not considered

so important as to justify the special effort involved.

Comment:

According to ABIDIAN, he openly discussed his

travel plans with Embassy language teacher

GROMAKOVA (GAVRILENKO's agent), and on at least

some occasions used international telephone

calls

to arrange for accommodations at his

destination in Europe.

Also, the Foreign

Ministry, UPDK (which office provides adminis-

trative services to foreign diplomats

in

Moscow), to which ABIDIAN sent his passport for

an exit visa for each departure, could have

noted from passport entries the whereabouts of

his

earlier travel.

ABIDIAN took no trips in the Soviet Union outside of

Moscow, since if he had, NOSENKO would have known and

remembered them, as

it was his responsibility as case

officer to take certain actions.

Among the latter he

listed:

-Receiving notification of ABIDIAN's request to travel

from the UPDK: (the Soviet Foreign Ministry unit which

provides administrative services to the diplomatic

community in Moscow)

-Advising the UPDK of KGB approval

for the trip:

-Advising appropriate local KGB offices of ABIDIAN'S

itinerary and giving them instructions for surveillance

and any other necessary operational activity.

-Receiving, reading, and filing all reports of

surveillance and other operational activity carried

out by various KGB units.

NOSENKO was certain that he took none of these steps. Even

if he were absent when such a request for travel was made,

he would have seen all documents upon his return; he did

not recall seeing any such documents in ABIDIAN's file.

Comment: ABIDIAN who is of Armenian origin and speaks

the Armenian language with a high degree of

proficiency, made a trip to Armenia between 5

and 9 October 1960. While in Armenia ABIDIAN

visited with various churchmen, their parish-

ioners and an Armenian who had repatriated from

Greece in 1946.

ABIDIAN attended a service in

Echmiadzin celebrating the anniversary of the

accession of the Katolikos VAZGEN I, and also

visited some relatives of his in or near the

city of Yerevan. After returning to Moscow,

an Armenian whom ABIDIAN met on that trip

tried to contact ABIDIAN at the Embassy, but

ABIDIAN refused to see him.

After being told ABIDIAN had attended a

service celebrating the fifth anniversary of

the Armenian Katolikos, VAZGEN I, NOSENKO

recalled that ABIDIAN had gone to Echmiadzin

and that an agent had reported a contact with

him there.

This agent, NOSENKO recalled, was

a priest or a monk, and the report concerned

only his conversation with ABIDIAN; the agent

had no further contact with him. NOSENKO said

that this was his sole recollection concerning

ABIDIAN's trip.

With reference to ABIDIAN's travel to

Armenia in October 1960, NOSENKO recalled

having been on leave at the time.

However,

NOSENKO's reconstruction of the

timing of his

alleged leave still placed him in Moscow at

the time of ABIDIAN's trip.

In 1966, NOSENKO

stated that he had lied, that his 1960 leave

was taken in January, not October.

Except for the American woman with whom ABIDIAN was

thought

to have been intimate, NOSENKO knew none of

ABIDIAN's close American

friends in Moscow nor his close

friends and professional contacts among foreigners there,

NOSENKO received and read transcripts of

all telephone

calls that ABIDIAN made or received at his office and

apartment via the Moscow city telephone system, but he

recalled none of their names nor nationalities, because

there was nothing of interest in the conversations.

At the end of the January-February 1965 interrogations

concerning ABIDIAN NOSENKO acknowledged that he knew little.

about this important KGB target.

"working badly"

ABIDIAN's case officer, he said, because he had had to

concentrate on supervising the work against code clerks.

ABIDIAN's Letter Mailings

During the 1962 meetings with NOSENKO: in Geneva, he

reported KGB knowledge of ABIDIAN's mailing of at least

three clandestine letters, in each case

to KGB-controlled

agents. According to NOSENKO, the KGB detected all the

letters mailed by ABIDIAN through the use of metka.

He

cautioned

the CIA representatives from further use of Embassy

employees for mailing letters to agents in the Soviet

Union

He noted that after LANGELLE, no

mailed for a year and a half, until ABIDIAN mailed several:

He explained that Embassy employees' servants applied an

odorless substance (metka) to clothing pockets, and traces

of the substance rubbed off on any thing it contacted, such

as a letter:

All the letters mailed in Moscow were passed

through a machine which identified letters bearing tracing

of metka,

he said, and this was how letters ABIDIAN mailed

were intercepted.

INOSENKO said the machine was a fotoapparat,

literally a camera, but presumably he meant some sort of

light-sensitive device. I NOSENKO recalled that ABIDIAN had

and. two

by ABIDIAN's surveillants.

According to NOSENKO, no new

agents were discovered, however, since all of the

agents to

whom ABIDIAN mailed letters were already controlled by the

KGB.

Comment:

NOSENKO's information is substantially correct,

that no letters were

mailed for one and a half

years after LANGELLE's expulsion, and that

ABIDIAN mailed two or three letters, including

ones to the Baltic area and to Odessa,

NO

letters were mailed from February 1960 until

ABIDIAN mailed one on 1 April 1961, and of the

three letters ABIDIAN mailed, one was

to Odessa

and one each to Latvia and Estonia.

CIA has conducted tests to determine whether

a substance such as metka was being used as a

KGB control device.

Ultra-violet, chemical

and microscopic analyses developed one possible

use of a metka like substance,

Analysis of an

article of clothing of a foreign diplomat in

Moscow who served as a CIA support agent

produced a sharply positive reaction.

NOSENKO later described how metka was applied to ABIDIAN's

clothing by his maid and how, in particular, this led to

the discovery of the letters ABIDIAN mailed to the agent in

Odessa and to his parents in the United States.

"ABIDIAN's maid in Moscow was Tatyana FEDOROVICH.

She was an operational contact reporting to ARTEMOV.

that FEDOROVICH would continue to put metka regularly

"FEDOROVICH put metka on ABIDIAN's clothing during

the entire period that she worked for him.

She did

this every two or three weeks except for a few times

when she was sick or on leave. No one else had

access to ABIDIAN's apartment and therefore no other

person had the possibility of putting metka on his

clothing:

"I have said that ABIDIAN mailed an operational

letter to the KGB double agent 'ARKHANGELSKIY' (in

Odessa) • He mailed it at the mailbox on Iverskaya

Yamskaya where he had gone several times earlier.

Surveillance dia not see ABIDIAN mail the letter

but the mailbox was controlled and the letter to

'ARKHANGELSKIY' was found, along with a letter to

ABIDIAN's parents Both of these letters had metka

on them, as I was told by SUMIN (a KGB secret

writing specialist

cannot remember, the date

that ABIDIAN mailed this: letter except that it was

sometime in 1961."

Comment:

ABIDIAN had no maid in Moscow until sixteen

months after his arrival; FEDOROVICH worked

for

him part-time from July 1961 until he left

Moscow Thus FEDOROVICH could not have applied

the metka which as NOSENKO Claimed resulted in

the interception of the letter ABIDIAN mailed

:1 April 1961, and probably was

not yet employed

by ABIDIAN even at the time the letter to

"ARKHANGELSKIY" was mailed on 2 July 1961.

ABIDIANs third letter was mailed on l September

1961, while FEDOROVICH was working for him.

ABIDIAN's Servicing of the Pushkin Street Deaddrop Site

In 1964 NOSENKO reported for the first time that in 1960

or in early 1961 the KGB had surveilled ABIDIAN visiting

what was believed to be a deaddrop site on Pushkin Street

in MoscOW.

He provided additional details when questioned

again in

1965.

NOSENKO's Information

In 1960 or early 1961, while NOSENKO was his responsible

case officer, ABIDIAN was surveilled from the Embassy to a

residential building on Pushkin Street in Moscow. A KGB

stationary surveillance post at the Embassy saw ABIDIAN leave

with the Publications Procurement Officer of the Embassy in

a chauffeured automobile, rather than in the car he normally

used.

ABIDIAN's surveillance team followed the car to a

bookstore. Both Americans entered the bookstore, but

shortly thereafter ABIDIAN left alone and walked around the

corner, where

he entered a residential building next to a

meat market on Pushkin Street.

The surveillance team saw

him go in but did not follow him. ABIDIAN emerged after a

few seconds.

This unusual incident was reported by the

surveillance team to the KGB Seventh (Surveillance) Direct-

can to the a

and the building was inspected that same day by KOZLOV,

the Chief of the First Department of the Surveillance

Directorate, and

MATVEYEV, the Deputy Chief of the Second

Chief Directorate's American Department.

Taking into account

the character of the building

and it's

inhabitants, the

duration and circumstances of ABIDIAN's visit, and the

suitability of the hallway - particularly the radiator in

it - for use as a deaddrop site, it was decided by the leader-

ship of the Second Chief Directorate and the Surveillance

Directorate that a stationary surveillance post should

immediately be set up to cover this location.

Because of

the short time available, it was not possible to place this

post inside the building, so it was set up across the street.

In addition, the radiator was checked daily to see if any-

• the vadiator

thing the cost was maned conta nee, hod been so dese behin

which it was maintained from 0800 until midnight for another

two months.

If a package or magnetic container had been

found behind the radiator, which was checked every morning,

it was planned to attach to

"it very thin wires to trigger a

signal should someone remove the package. At the same time

a member of the surveillance team would be stationed' on the

landing of the staircase in this building, out of sight from

the hallway below.

During the three months that the post

was

maintained, nothing was found concealed behind the radiatori

nor were any suspicious persons seen

entering or leaving the

building.

The post was

then discontinued, but the address

was placed on a list of suspicious places inspected daily

by the Surveillance Directorate.

The true significance of

this location became known to the KGB only later, after the

arrest of PENKOVSKIY in 1962.

NOSENKO first heard of ABIDIAN's visit to the suspected

deaddrop site on: the day it occurred. He was

sitting in

KOVSHUK's office when he received a telephone call Irom

MATVEYEV telling him of the

incident

Although NOSENKO was

ABIDIAN's case officer and KOVSHÜK was Chief

of the Embassy

Section, the decision to place the stationary surveillance

post at

the site was made at a higher level; neither of them

was involved in it or in the later decision to discontinue

NOSENKO himself visited the building on Pushkin

Street the following day or the day after, but he remained

only a few minutes and did not recall any details of the

the po the followin and

hallway. except that there was a radiator there.

As ABIDIAN's case officer, NOSENKO recalled

receiving the

surveillance report

of his visit to the Pushkin Street building

and placing this report in ABIDIAN's file.

(This case file

NOSENKO turned over to his successor, GRYAZNOV; about

28 December 1961, just before he transferred to the Seventh

Department.)

NOSENKO received no written reports on the results of the

stationary surveillance post, but he did discuss this matter

with KOZLOV on an almost daily basis during the first month

of surveillance, and periodically after that.

These discus-

sions took place

either by telephone, when KOZLOV was

visiting NOSENKO,'s office, or when NOSENKO visited KOZLOV's

office in KGB Headquarters. From KOZLOV or perhaps someone

else, NOSENKO learned that the post had been discontinued

after 90 days.

On the basis of these conversations with

KOZLOV, NOSENKO knew that nothing of interest occurred

during the period of the stationary surveillance.

NOSENKO was in the Embassy Section during all the period

that the stationary surveillance post was watching the

Pushkin Street site and was there when he heard from KOZLOV

that the post had been replaced by periodic inspections.

NOSENKO did not report this incident of surveillance on

the Pushkin Street deaddrop site to his CIA contacts in

Geneva in June 1962 because by that time the post had

already been discontinued without anything unusual or

suspicious having been noted, and he thought that this

incident would be of no particular interest to CIA.

When last asked whether he had visited the Pushkin Street

address several days after ABIDIAN had been seen there, as

he had earlier said, NOSENKO replied:

"I don't remember. I do not want to say that I

visited the deaddrop. I don't remember now whether

I visited it or not. It seems to me that I visited

it, but I don't remember. It seems that I visited

it with

Comment:

ABIDIAN visited the Pushkin Street deaddrop

site only once, on 30 December 1961, a fuli

year after the time reported by NOSENKO:

As

NOSENKO reported, accompanied by an Embassy

Economic Officer, ABIDIAN left the Embassy in

an official car with a Soviet driver and

proceeded in a bookstore on the corner of

Pushkin Street.

Leaving the bookstore, ABIDIAN

entered the building where the site was located,

determined that the drop was empty, and left

one minute later, returning to the Embassy.

by the site on 12 November and 4 December 1960;

on 21 January 1961 MAHONEY briefly entered the 0$

building to confirm the site's precise location

If the KGB had surveilled HATONEY's visits and OJ

had put the site under surveillance, NOSENKO

might be relating those events by mischance in

attributing the visit to ABIDIAN. In such a

circumstance, however, NOSENKO, as ABIDIAN'S

case officer, would have known that his target

visited a site which had been previously noted

in connection with the suspicious movements of

another Embassy official. Further, NOSENKO's

description of ABIDIAN's route, companion, and

sequence of movements is so precise as to refei

clearly to ABIDIAN.

_ Lastly, NOSENKO disIcaims

any knowledge of MAHONEYJor his activities; he US

asserts that MAHONEY was neither the object of o

KGB suspicion or concern. For reasons no

combination of circumstances nor NOSENKO himself

can plausibly explain, NOSENKO can describe

ABIDIAN's deaddrop site visit although it

occurred at a time when MOSENKO was no longer

ABIDIAN's case officer and when he was assigned

to another Second Chief Directorate department:

If

dáys after ABIDIAN's visit, as he claimed (and

NOSENKO's participation in

the W.E. JOHNSON case 06

indicates that he was working against tourists

by 5 January 1962), he could neither have visited

the site as he described nor could he have

received thereafter the daily surveillance

reports.

He could not, of his own knowledge,

assert that the surveillance was terminated

after three months, since well before the three

months' surveillance ended he was abroad in

• Geneva.

Lastly, it cannot be for the reason

NOSENKO claimed (that the surveillance was

unsuccessfull that NOSENKO did not mention

ABIDIAN's activities to CIA in Geneva in 1962.

Case Officer for John ABIDIAN: Summary and Conclusion

If for no other reason than ABIDIAN's security functions

with the Khrushchev entourage, files of the First Chief

Directorate would record his name: If NOSENKO states to

the contrary, that traces were negative, NOSENKO did not run

the traces himself nor know the results. According to

NOSENKO, ABIDIAN was "one of

the most important targets of

the Second Chief Directorate"; all KGB resources were

employed for two years, including 24-hour surveillance, the

exploitation of all agents with access to him, audio sur-

veillance, and technical aids, with amost absolutely negative

results.

The results could not have been negative: for

NOSENKO to so assert can only mean that NOSENKO was not

informed of the results.

In the two instances NOSENKO cited

of Embassy agents' activities against ABIDIAN, he made

fundamental errors: ABIDIAN's maid was not employed by

ABIDIAN at the time NOSENKO insists she was applying the

metka, and GROMAKOVA taught ACIDIAN Russian throughout his

stay in Moscow, not just

"several times". NOSENKO acknowledges

that ABIDIAN's travel in the Soviet Union would have had

been approved by the KGB, and that the responsible case

officer would have issued orders for his surveillance out-

side of Moscow and would have later received reports of the

target's activities.

NOSENKO acknowledged that he was not

so involved, although he belatedly recalled one trip ABIDIAN

made.

Lastly, although NOSENKO claims to know, from his

Embassy Section assignment, details of ABIDIAN's visit to

the Pushkin Street deaddrop, the event occurred at a time

when NOSENKO by his own account could not have been physically

present in the Embassy Section.

1

Conclusion

It is concluded from the foregoing that NOSENKO was not

case officer for Embassy Security Officer John ABIDIAN.

Supervisor of Operations Against

American Service Attaches

Questioned in detail in 1964 on his responsibilities in

the

Embassy Section, NOSENKO claimed no personal role in

operations against American service attaches.

He said only

that when he arrived in the section, DRANOV was the respon-

sible case officer for the Naval personnel, including the

Embassy Marine guards, and when DRANOV was transferred

shortly thereafter, his responsibilities were assumed by

BELOGLAZOV. Listing the names and functions of American

Department personnel, NOSENKO mentioned that Yevgeniy

Nikolayevich ALESHIN was Second Deputy to Department Chief

KLYPIN: ALESHIN had

the

special assignment of coordinating

Second Chief Directorate activities against all foreign

military intelligence personnel, including service attaches:

In January 1965 NOSENKO claimed for the first time that

he had among his other responsibilities as Deputy Chief that

of supervising operations

against American service attaches,

(AMERICAN EMBASSY SECTION - January 1960-January 19621

and for the first time claimed case officer responsibilities

against American targets other than ABIDIAN. He related how,

at his meeting with KLYPIN and KOVSHUK on entering the section

in January 1960, KOVSHUK suggested that NOSENKO assume super-

visory responsibility for the service attaches while KOVSHUK

supervised operations against the civilian diplomatic staff

of the Embassy•

NOSENKO stated "supervising" meant that the

case officers for the service attaches referred their ques-

tions to him, not to KovsHuk.

These included case officers

GAVRILENKO, responsible for Air Attaches, KURILENKO, for

Army Attaches,

and DEKIN, for enlisted personnel of all

services.

"While he was getting acquainted with the section

on DRANOV's retirement", NOSENKO himself took case officer

responsibility for the Naval Attache personnel.

This res-

ponsibility was subsequently assumed by DRANOV's former

assistant, BELOGLAZOV. NOSENKO could not initially recall

how long he supervised service attache operations; he later

said

"several months" and finally "five or six months".

Neither could NOSENKO recall what other pressing duty or

duties

caused him to be relieved of this function.

He said

this resulted from KOVSHUK's proposal that supervision of

the service attaches be assumed by ALESHIN who was Deputy

Chief of the Second Directorate's American Department and

coordinator for Second Directorate operations against

military intelligence officers of all nationalities.

Supervisor of Service Attache Operations:

Summary and Conclusion

Because of the tardiness of NOSENKO's claim to have been

responsible for operations against service attaches and

because he

was not able, when challenged, to substantiate

his claims

by providing any details of KGB activities against

these targets; it is concluded that this aspect of his

claimed KGB service is a fiction.

Custodian of KGB File on Embassy Security

As former Deputy Chief and öccasional Acting Chief of the

American Embassy Section, NOSENKO claimed awareness of KGB

knowledge of its American Embassy target. Specifically!

NOSENKO claimed to have been custodian of the Second Chief

Directorate's file on Embassy security.

NOSENKO's Information

He received

the file from the Section Chief, kovSHUK, when

he arrived in January 1960.: As was permissible under KGB

procedures, as long as the custodian was still in the same

directorate, the

file was charged to BAKHVALOV. [See p. 153

for NOSENKO's various assertions with respect to BAKHVALOV.j

NOSENKO had custody of the file charged to himself, and from

January 1960 until NOSENKO was leaving the section on 25-28.

December 1961, only KOVSHUK, NOSENKO, and GRYAZNOV and

KOSOLAPOV (both of

whom shared NOSENKO's Office and safej had

access:

to the file.

The file consisted of two volumes, one for the old

building on Mokhovaya Street and the second (about an inch

thick) on the new Embassy building occupied in 1953 on

The file contained detailed floor plans

and photographs of both buildings.

All Soviet employees of the Embassy who entered the

restricted areas, "the seventh through the tenth floors",

were carefully questioned because of the special KGB interest

in these offices. (The secure area barred to unescorted

Office".]

Nothing could be recovered from the Embassy classified

trash, which was always burned at an unrecalled location by

a non-commissioned officer or Marine guard accompanied by

an officer. [At the Moscow Embassy the Marine guard detailed

Custodian Of Embassy Security File: Summary and Conclusion

NOSENKO cannot describe the location (even by floor) of

any of his own targets, such as ABIDIAN, the military code

room,

or the State Department communications center

In

fact,

he cannot describe the location of the office of any

individual or unit in the Embassy, even of the Ambassador:

When challenged to substantiate his claim to knowledge of

the Embassy security file, NOSENKO asserted that he had never

read it nor paid any

"special attention" to its content in

the two

years he was file custodian It is concluded that

NOSENKO's claim that he was custodian of the file is an

invention.

Audio Operations Against the American Embassy

NOSENKO's knowledge of the KGB microphone system in the

Embassy derived from his alleged responsibility as Deputy

Chief of

the Embassy Section for receiving and routing to

approptiate KGB personnel the reports of monitored conversa-

tions. Also, in his capacity as Deputy Chief and custodian

of the monitoring reports logbook NOSENKO claimed to have

attended a meeting

at the end of 1960 of the beginning of

1961 at which he learned details of the locations of specific

microphones hidden

in the Embassy.

Lastly, NOSENKO claimed

he obtained information on the KGB audio operations against

the Embassy, even after he left the Embassy Section, from his

former

subordinate GRYAZNOV. NOSENKO regarded the information

about the KGB microphones, first mentioned in Geneva in

1962,

as the most important he provided CIA:

NOSENKO's Information

Handling of Monitor Reports

According to NOSENKO, only a limited number of KGB

personnel, all in the American Department of the Second

Chief Directorate, had access to the monitor reports.

These

included Department Chief KLYPIN (but not his deputies),

KOVSHUK, NOSENKO himself,

and GRIBANOV, to whom important

items were shown. The existence of the audio operation and

its product were concealed from personnel in other KGB

Departments.

The reports were produced by the Second Special

Department of the Operational Technical Directorate (OTU) •

The OTU Second Special Department has several sections, one

of which was the English Section under Colonel N. Ya. KUZMIN.

KUZMIN's monitors, fluent in English, listened

to and

transcrived the tape recordings.

Their reports of the

preceding: day's product were brought daily by Tatyana

GRISHNYAT

(of the Second Special Department) to the American

Department.

(In some accounts NOSENKO has said that he

received the reports first, at other times that they went

first to KLYPIN.)

NOSENKO reviewed the reports, marked

significant portions and usually within twenty-four hours

returned the reports to the Second Special nepartment.

In NOSENKO's absence either KOVSHUK. or GRYAZNOV reviewed the

reports.

The Second Special Department prepared sterile

abstracts of the portions NOSENKO had marked, abstracts

which disguised the source of the information contained:

the abstracts were returned to the American Department for

the reference of individual case officers in the Embassy

Section and for filing in the delo-formulyar (developmental

file) kept on each American employee in the Embassy.

Location of the Microphones

In the 1962 Geneva meetings with CIA, NOSENKO emphasized

that the KGB was listening to all conversations of the

service attaches and particularly, to conversations held

in

the office of the Minister Counsellor. In addition, he

referred to "points"

[microphones] in the office of an

unnamed State Department employee,

in the Agricultural

Attache office shared by BROWl and HORBALY, and in the

Embassy code room.

In 1964, at the

second meeting with CIA, NOSENKO produced

handwritten note which he asserted listed all the micro-

phones in the Embassy which were operative in the years

1960-19610

NOSENKO explained that at the end of 1960 or

KOVSHUK met with Department

Chief KLYPIN.

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss

the possibility of releasing monitors from some of the

Embassy microphones so they could be assigned to Vladimir

PETROV, Chief of the American Department's Second Section

for use against non-Embassy targets.:

(PETROV had earlier

requested English-language monitors from the Second Special

Section, but had been told that English linguists were

engaged on priority targets.) At the meeting, KOVSHUk and

KIYPIN reviewed the microphone coverage of the Embassy

chancery to decide which rooms offered information of little

value, so that the monitors for those microphones could be

released to PETROV's Second Section.

KOVSHUK used NOSENKO's

notebook in which to list Embassy apartments and offices

then being covered on a full-time basis and to note those of

lesser importance. KOVSHUK

decided to relinquish, tempor-

arily, monitoring of Embassy apartments.

He continued the

monitoring of the code room, despite the limited value of

the information obtained.

At the end of the meeting KOVSHUK

gave or NOSENKo took the list, and NOSENKO retained it in

his office safe until bringing it to CIA in 1964.

NOSENKO's list showed that

microphones were located in

the following offices of the noted occupants:

"Office of the Minister Counsellor, FREERS;

"Office of the Naval Attache, HOUGHTON;

"Office of the Army Attache, URBAN; ,

"Office of the Air Attache, NEILSEN;

NOSENKO said that "many" microphones were installed in

the chancery building before the Americans occupied It, but

he did not know how many were installed in all, how many

were in any particular room on KOVSHUK's list, or where they

were located in specific rooms. He did recall that most of

the microphones were emplaced in the outside wall, the wall

nearest Chaykovskiy Street, as most of the offices faced

this street and microphones emplaced there were less vulner-

able to technical search and discovery.

According to NOSENKO, there were no fixed microphones in

America House, the Embassy quarters of enlisted military

personnel.. In 1960-1961 there had been a discussion of using

KGB agents

employed there to emplace temporary audio devices

for one or two days. at a time in the rooms of the Americans,

as well as in the Embassy garage.

These plans were vetoed,

however, because of the risk of discovery.

For the same

reason there was no attempt made in this period to emplace

a device temporarily in Spasso House, the Ambassador's

residence, or in the apartments of Embassy officers.

The

KGB was afraid that they

would be detected and there would

be a scandal:

Performance Characteristics of the Microphones

According to NOSENKO in 1962, the audibility of the

microphones in 1960-1961 ranged from very clear to zero,

but the microphone system was deteriorating.

The KGB could

do nothing about it because they could not gain access to

the inside of the Embassy.

Referring to the microphone in

the Minister Counsellor's office, NOSENKO said that it was

becoming increasingly difficult towork with its product.

the microphone was fading, and the recording tape sounded

as if "somewhere far away, somewhere in the cellar, someone

is speaking in a whisper'

KUZMIN, the KGB officer respon-

sible for the monitors, said that soon the KGB could recover

nothing. Of the microphones then (in

1962) in place, about

twenty no longer were operative.

In 1964 NOSENKO referred again to the microphone in the

Minister Counsellor's office.

NOSENKO learned from

DMITRIYEV [Deputy Chief of the English-language Section of

OTU Second Special Department] how difficult it was to

monitor conversations in that office. Only very experienced

linguists were used, but even they had to listen "ten,

fifteen, even twenty

"times" in order to understand portions

the recording.

After NOSENKO left the Embassy Section,

on several occasions in 1962-1963 GRYAZNOV, his former sub-

ordinate and his successor, referred to the microphones'

decline.. GRYAZNOV said the microphones were picking up

only snatches of conversation, and that in a year of two

they would be completely inoperative.

As a result, GRYAZNOV

told NOSENKO, GRIBANOV was insisting on the recruitment of

code clerks at all costs. Besides the fading quality of

the microphone's signäl, GRYAZNOV, KOVSHUK and FEDOSEYEV

attributed the diminishing. value. of the audio operation to

g value on

the Embassy use of the

"room-in-a-room"

[NOSENKO said

that in 1960-1961 the KGB had information that, in prepara-

tion for President Eisenhower's visit, a "steel chamber"

had been constructed within the Embassy where secure conver-

sations could be held.]

Microphones in the North Wing

According to NOSENKO, no microphones or other audio

devices were ever installed in the north wing (as distinct

from the chancery) prior to the' Embassy's occupancy of the

building in 1962.

In his first meetings with CIA in Geneva

he described how he knew. When it was decided to permit

the Embassy to construct the north wing, NOSENKO wrote a

proposal that audio equipment be installed. Approval

was

up by KGB Chairman Shelepin, who had reservations

because of the political consequences of discovery.

BY

the time Shelepin approved the proposal two or three months

later, renovation was far advanced, and Embassy security

Officer ABIDIAN was already inspecting the premises:: The

Consequenty the

opportunity was lost and the KGB installed no microphones:

Consequently, NOSENKO suggested to CIA that the Minister

Counsellor,

occupying rooms in the chancery which had microphones, be

moved gradually to the north wing, where the KGB had neither

audio equipment nor the capability of installing any.

Amount, Type, and Value of Audio Surveillance Production

In 1962 while citing examples of the kind of information

the KGB obtained from monitoring, NOSENKO referred only to

the offices of the Minister Counsellor and of the

service

attaches.

According to NOSENKO, Counsellor FREERS dictated

Top Secret and Secret cables. If the content justified,

GRIBANOV was informed and he notified the KGB Chairman

immediately:

FREERS also dictated fitness reports on Embassy

personnel from which the KGB learned of various American

officers' personal weaknesses.

With respect to the service

attaches, NOSENKO said that the KGB learned from microphones

where they intended to travel, and what they wanted to find

out:

In 1964 NOSENKO provided some additional details. He

said that audio reception was good from the military code

room, but that the occupants rarely spoke.

When one of them

Nothing was obtained from the State Department code room and

teletype room because of the interference from the noise of

the teletype machines.

The microphones in the apartments

produced rarely anything of interest.

An exception was

advance information obtained of a social affair, for which

the English-language Section of the OTU Second Special

Department would

be asked to pay particular attention. There

was a microphone with good reception in GLEYSTEEN'S (a

political officer) office, but no secret information was

obtained.

Similarly, the conversations were overheard in

the Agricultural Attache office, but nothing significant

was obtained except "something"

which made the KGB suspect

HORBALY was connected with American Intelligence.

• In a protocol signed on 26 October 1965 NOSENKO summarized

his knowledge of the value of the information obtained by

the KGB via microphones in the Embassy:

"I regularly reviewed all of the transcripts from

According to the

USIB Security Committee damage report which followed, a

microphone and associated probe was first discovered in the

outside wall behind a radiator in Room 1008 of the chancery.

lIn 1960 this room had been the office of the Army Attache,

where NOSENKO reported a microphone was emplaced.] The

microphone's cable was traced to a major cable which ran

horizontally (several inches) under the outside surface of

the east face of the chancery, to the roof area of the north

annex. A number of vertical cables were found to run to the

various microphone: installations..:

Fifty microphones were

positively identified (ultimately, fifty-four were foundl,

although the system apparently was devised for a considerably

greater number. The microphone system covered all outside

rooms on floors six through ten, with certain exceptions.

The USIB damage report concluded that the microphones were

installed before the Embassy took occupancy of the chancery

The discoveries in the chancery led to the discovery of

other Soviet technical equipment

installed in the north wing

Parallel to the audio cable running from the chancery to the

north wing roof, there were found three coaxial cables, all

terminating in the concrete floor of the north wing attic.

The coaxial

cables appeared to be of more recent installation,

probably prior to the Soviets' evacuation of the north wing.

in 1962.

Comment: While not definitely established, it is assumed

that the Soviets, before the Embassy occupied

the north wing, used it as a listening post for

monitoring microphones in the chancery. In

preparation for American occupancy the main cable

from the chancery was concealed and run from the

north wing roof to the basement, and presumably

from there to a listening post elsewhere.

The

three coaxial cables may have been either

installed at that time or earlier..

Their purpose

is still unknown, but they may have been a

feature of a highly sophisticated electronic

attack against the code room, the existence or

character of which NOSENKO did not know and need

not have known. When NOSENKO was informed in

1965 by CIA that there had been a technical

discovery in the north wing, he offered his

personal assurances that nothing was installed

in the north wing and insisted that whatever

was found must be something unrelated to an

äudio system.

Damage Estimates

With reference to the damage caused by the audio penetra-

tion, the previously-cited USIB damage report stated that "it

must be concluded that due to the extensive period of penetra

tion; the cumulative effect has resulted in serious damage to

the United States. The Soviets have gained considerable

knowledge as to the effectiveness of United

States operations

within the Soviet Union, particularly the military attache

collection program.

Soviet knowledge of U.S. emphasis upon

certain intelligence collection areas has made it possible

for them to identify priority intelligence and probably

Soviet targets and thereby permitted them to implement

specific counteractions.

The Soviets over the years must

have amassed considerable information concerning the personal

habits, problems, attitudes and weaknesses of personnel

assigned

to the Embassy which can be used by them for purposes

of exploitation at any time of their choosing in the future."

months of NOSENKO's claimed two years'

Audio Operations Against American Embassy:

Summary and Conclusion

Given that NOSENKO's information about microphones in the

chancery has been confirmed, that information's significance

remains the extent to which

it substantiates his claims,

e.g., that his knowledge derived from his position as Deputy

Chief, and that he for two years reviewed the reports of

what the KGB monitored from microphones emplaced in the

chancery

NOSENKO's 'knowledge of the microphones' existence is not

proof that he was Deputy Chief of the Embassy Section, (or

even proof that he served in that unit).

KGB sources serving

elsewhere than in the Second Chief Directorate earlier:

reported the microphones' existence; GOLITSYN specificali

NOSEIKO's

acquisition of the list of microphones in

"1960-1961" is singular (the more so

since he never hinted

of the list's existence while describing the microphones in

the chancery to CIA in 1962). He asserts that he had no

plan to defect in 1960-1961, when the list was acquired,

that for no apparent purpose he risked keeping a highly

sensitive document in a safe he shared with two subördinates

(GRYAZNOV and KOSOALPOV), and keeping it even after he left

the Embassy Section for the Seventh Department. NOSENKO

so Pot the

has never plausibly explained the circumstances which

prompted his retention of the list until 1964, when he

produced it for CIA in Geneva.

According to NOSENKO, he reviewed what must have been

literally hundreds of monitor reports in the course of two

years, important ones of which

were forwarded to Second

Chief

Directorate Chief GRIBANOV, and others of such signi

ficance that they were the subjects of special reports sent

to the Central Committee of the CPSU.

Yet when challenged

States relations (and hence of priority interest to the KGB),

as the U-2 and President Eisenhower's visit. Of the micro-

phones which produced useful information, NOSENKO describes

those in the Minister Counsellor's office, the office of

the Army Attache, and in the code room; when challenged to

cite examples

produced any Information of interest to the Embassy Section.

Lastly, although he stresses the value of the chancery

microphones as sources of information on which he rdied

to

direct operations against code clerks and other Embassy

personnel, he again can describe no actual instance: In

the single case in which he asserted that he relied on

information procured from microphones. KEYSERS!' failure toOb

report receipt of the defection invitation), he was in error.

Conclusion

From the foregoing

it is concluded that, NOSENKO's claims

to the contrary, his information on the chancery microphones

does not sustain his claim either to have been Deputy Chief

of the Embassy Section, or his claim that he personally

reviewed the KGB microphone monitoring reports.

Cryptologic Attack on Embassy Communications

American Department NOSENKO claimed to be knowledgeable of

the extent of KGB success in its cryptologic attack on

Embassy communications,

in the information as it did not relate to agents or agent

activities.

NOSENKO noted, however, that the material

concerned messages from the Secretary of State to the American

Ambassador, Moscow.

All of this material was highly sensi

tive, and few people were permitted to see it or even to

know of its existence. NOSENKO stated that it was treated

more carefully than Top Secret information.

Unable to describe the techniques of the KGB Eighth

Directorate in breaking U.S. Department of State crypto-

graphic systems, NOSENKO nevertheless did indicate methods

as known to him.

One method, mentioned by NOSENKO on

12 June 1962, stemmed from the habit of certain Embassy

officials (notably Ministers Counsellor FREERS and McSWEENEY;

dictating the text of outgoing cables aloud. When the texts

were picked up on the KGB microphones,

the Eighth Directorate

compared them against enciphered traffic intercepted by

other means.

NOSENKO has referred to the Eighth Directorate's interest

in equipment sounds and snatches of technical conversations

picked up by the microphones in the State Department and

military code rooms.

"Now, we also listened to the code room and the

teletype office, but we could never get anything out

of the teletype office because of interference

lequipment noises which drowned out conversations].

In the military code room--that was where James H.106

STORSBERG and later

(Matthew P.] ZUJUS worked--we 0b

on occasion, and then he would mention a group of

numbers.

This was, of course, all recorded and we

turned it over at once to the Eighth Directorate,

dealing with coding and decoding.

Of course, all

other intercepts were turned over to them also."

With respect to the use of code clerks by the American

Department, NOSENKO recalled that in 1948 or 1949 the KGB

was helped

a great deal by (James H.] MCMILLAN la military

code clerk of the Embassy

staff who detected in 19481, and

by "ANDREY" [Dayle SMITH, see p. 331. It was thanks

lat. the time of SMITH's tour in Moscow

a single code room was shared by State Department and

military code clerks. As-the only cryptographic machine

technician assigned to the Embassy, SMITH had access to both

State and military cryptographic equipment.l

NOSENKO also named MARTIN and MICHELL INSA mathematicians

who defected to the USSR in July 1960] and "an American

code clerk brought to the USSR from India" lunidentified,

but possibly John Discoe SMITH, State Department communica-

tions technician who defected to the USSR sometime between

1960-1967, when his presence in the USSR was publicized.

NOSENKO said the Eighth Directorate was submitting

regular reports to khrushchev and the Central Committee on

their intercepts until "the end of 1961 or the beginning

of 1962". He learned this from GRYAZNOV, his successor in

the Embassy Section. At about the same time he learned

that various Embassy officers were less often överheard from

KGB microphones in their offices discussing significant

information.

This development GRYAZNOV and American Depart-

ment Chief FEDOSEYEV attributed to a "room-within-a-room"?

room was installed in December 1962] After

his own departure from the Embassy Section, NOSENKO also;

Cryptologic Attack on Embassy Communications:

Summary and Conclusion

From USIR and NSA damage assessments following the

discovery of the microphones in the chancery, it has been

concluded that it was equally feasible for the soviets to

have recovered plain text (by analysis of cipher machine

emissions) from enciphered service attache traffic of the

period 1952-1962, and from enciphered State Department

traffic during 1952-1959.

of his conduct as a Department of State security officer

NOSENKO remembered the names of no KGB

agents working against rUNKHAUSEk; nor any information about

him which was regarded as derogatory by the KGB:

Comment:

FUNKHAUSER had no affiliation with CIA.

William HORBALY

HORBALY was suspected of being a CIA case officer or

cooptee because the KGB monitored through a microphone in

the Embassy his discussion or dictation of observations made

on a field trip. NOSENKO knew the names of no KGB agents

working against HORBALY, nor whether the agents ever obtained

any derogatory information about him The KGB did not try

to recruit HORBALY ®

Knowledge of CIA Personnel in Embassy:

Summary and Conclusion

With the exception of ABIDIAN, there is a paradox

connected with each of NOSENKO's identifications, as is

most evident in the cases of MORELI) and GARBLER.

It is a Of

fact that both these individuals were known to the KGB as

CIA officers, a fact of which NOSENKO apparently is unaware.

His claim is

thus false, that he would necessarily know

whom the KGB believed was a CIA officer, and to the extent

he related it to his claim that he was Deputy Chief of the

Embassy Section, that latter claim is unsubstantiated.

Personal Handler of KGB Agents

NOSENKO has named seven agents which he claimed to have

handled while Deputy Chief of the American Section during

1960-1961:

YEFREMOV and VOLKOV

NOSENKO continued to manage these two homosexual agents

whom he had recruited and managed during his assignment in

the Seventh Department, and brought with him when he trans-

Ierred to the American Department (see p. 1ll). They were

ised in no operations during the period 1960-1961.

[NOSENKO

lescribed the compromise of Robert BARRETT in 1959 and knew 0.

of his later recruitment in I961. (See p. 134.) NOSENKO

does not know of BARRÊTT's contacts with YEFREMOV and VOLKOVO6

Travel to Cuba (November-December 1960)

When NOSENKO first mentioned his travel to Cuba (in

1962, in Geneva), he claimed that he travelled under the

NIKOLAYEV alias, and he provided colorful details of his

activities in Havana in surveying the American Embassy

there for operational possibilities.

NOSENKO asserted that he travelled in true name, and that

his was a routine assignment to accompany a Soviet delegation

as a security officer.

NOSENKO's Information

In the latter part of 1960, at the same time as he was

preparing for his intended trip to the United States, a

special delegation of nickel industry experts from Gosplan,

the Soviet State Planning Commission, was preparing for

departure for Cuba.

The delegation was a routine one,

consisting mostly of engineers from various sections of

the Soviet Union.

Since there was no one under any sort of

suspicion, the Eleventh (Soviet Travellers Abroad) Depart-

ment of the Second Chiéf Directorate decided it was unnec

essary to include a security officer. Two days prior to

the departure of the group, however, the Central Committee

of the Communist Party ordered that a Second Chief Direct-

orate officer accompany the group.

Because of the short

time remaining before the delegation's scheduled departure,

the Eleventh Department protested that it would be impossible

to find a suitable officer who could get his necessary

travel documents ready in time. At this point, A.I. KUZNETSOV

of the Eleventh Department suggested NOSENKO, who had been

supposed to go to the United States and who had a valid

The Cubans issued NOSENKO a visa

immediately as did The Netherlands a transit visa.

NOSENKO's functions with the delegation were purely of

a security nature.

He flew with the delegation to Cuba in

October or November and spent about a month and a half

there. During this time he accompanied the delegation

everywhere it went, to different plants, and to meet repre-

sentatives of the so-called Institute of Agrarian Reform

to discuss how to increase production. NOSENKO's cover

assignment was deputy chief of the delegation and shortly

before departing Moscow he was introduced to the other

members as such..

He had one agent within the delegation

and developed several

"confidential contacts" during the

trip. NOSENKO would not have accepted the assignment had

he known how long and uneventful the trip was to be; he

had really wanted to go only to the United States.

On his return trip to Moscow, NOSENKO was given a special

mission. As he was leaving from Havana Airport, the KGB

Legal Rezident in Cuba, A.I. ALEKSEYEV, handed him a package

with instructions to deliver it to Moscow: NOSENKO did not

know the contents of the package until he arrived in

Amsterdam en route home

There the wrappings became loose

(it was bound only by thin string) and NOSENKO took the

opportunity to determine that it contained copies of "letters

between wiikoyan and Khrushchev concerning the prices of

sugar" and drafts of

agreements between the Soviet Union

and

East Germany,

Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Rumania.

On

arrival at the airport in Amsterdam, NOSENKO was told that

a message had been received from the Central Committee of

the Communist Party instructing that the package was to be

delivered "urgently" to Che Guevara, who was

touring Eastern

Europe and was then in Berlin.

While the delegation continued

on to Moscow, NOSENKO was driven to the Soviet Embassy in

The Hague, and in the late evening of his second day in The

Netherlands he left by train for East Berlin.

When he

arrived in Berlin Guevara was found to have left Berlin for

Hungary, and NOSENKO delivered the papers to "Guevara's

deputy" in Berlin and continued on to Moscow.

for Havana on 19 November. According to flight

manifests, on 13 December NOSENKO arrived in

Amsterdam

from Havana en route to Moscow and

left Amsterdam via air for Moscow on 15 December.

NOSENKO was travelling on

a service passport;

he did not enjoy diplomatic immunity: It is

thus highly unlikely that he did serve as a

courier, bearing documents of the nature he

described as he claimed.

NOSENKO's planned trip to the United States

and his confirmed travel to Cuba damages his

claim that he was supervising operations during

this period against Embassy code clerks in

MOScOW.

The trip occurred at the time his

alleged target, State Department code clerk

MORONE, was to be entrapped on the train en

route to Warsaw (15 November) and while his

subordinate KOSOLAPOV was in Helsinki (12-16

November) in connection with another code clerk

Travel to Bulgaria and the LUNT Case (April-May 1961)

In Geneva in 1962 NOSENKO reported that he had been sent

to Sofia as a KGB response to a Bulgarian Ministry of

Interior (MVR) request that the KGB provide a Second Chief

Directorate American Department officer to discuss opera-

tions with Bulgarian counterparts.

While in Sofia NOSENKO

asserted he played a key role in the compromise of American

professor Horace G. LUNT.

said that the Bulgarian Minister of the Interior had

requested the KGB Chairman to provide an officer from the

American Department of the Second Chief Directorate for

consultation with the MVR American Department in Sofia.

Anerican Department Chief KLYPIN subsequently instructed

NOSENKO to go•:

NOSENKO was told that he was going for

"consultations" and that KGB advisors would discuss his

duties with him.: KLYPIN told NOSENKO only that he should

see how the MVR worked, and tell them how the KGB managed

its operations...

NOSENKO had no meetings or discussions with

American Department, the names of any MVR officers, or what.

the MVR's particular problems were.

NOSENKO flew from Moscow to Sofia in early April 1961

and was met at the airport by A.s. KOZLOV, a former Second

Chief Directorate officer whom he had known' in Moscow.

The following morning he was picked up in an official

vehicle and was taken to KOZLOV's office in the Bulgarian

MVR building. NOSENKO asked KOZLOV what was expected of

him and was told that "they want to know about how to work

against the American Legation, everything, right from

letter 'A'"

NOSENKO was introduced to the Chief KGB

advisor in Sofia, Mikhail YEGOROV, and to the Chief of the

MVR's American Department, after which he was assigned an

office: In the MVR building. During the ensuing weeks he

discussed both general matters and particular cases with

carget::. On one occasion he lectured interested MR officers

on the principles of operations against foreign military

personnel in Moscow, and on another he visited an MVR

surveillance post opposite the American Legation.

He

discussed KGB methods of operations against foreign tourists.

He also addressed the entire American Department for about

five hours to tell them "what is necessary, what to pay

attention to, how to work". At the end of his visit, some

time in mid-May, NOSENKO conferred with the First Deputy

Minister of the MVR about what had been accomplished and

his recommendations for improving operations against Americans:

Comment:

NOSENKO doesn't know why he was selected to

consult with the MVR in Bulgaria,

As far.

as is known

to CIA, such consultation was a

function of the KGB advisors in Sofia whom

NOSENKO himself described. The American

Legation (after a ten-year absence) reopened

in February 1960. By 1961 the MVR had demon-

strated that it had lost none of its earlier

demonstrated efficiency in controlling the

activities of resident foreigners and in

establishing the basis for mounting operations

against American diplomats.

There was no

apparent necessity for NOSENKO's Sofia assign-

ment, and therefore his account is jüdged to

be untrue.

Promotion and Transfer to

Seventh Department (January

1962)

NOSENKO stated that his return to the Seventh Department

resulted from GRIBANOV's wish to promote him from Deputy

Chief of the Embassy Section to Deputy Chief of the whole

American Department, However, according to NOSENKO, the

new American Department Chief, FEDOSEYEV, wanted as his

deputy KOVSHUK, NOSENKO's superior.

Under the circumstances,

NOSENKO said he preferred to be transferred back to the

Seventh Department, in any capacity.

NOSENKO reported that

he spoke to Seventh Department Chief V.D. CHELNOKOV, and the

latter proposed that NOSENKO ask GRIBANOV. to be returned to

the Seventh Department as chief of the American Section,

with the understanding that he would be appointed Deputy

Chief of the Seventh Department as soon as the incumbent

deputy [B.A.] BALDIN retired in July 1962.

NOSENKO asserted

his proposal was

made and approved by GRIBANOV in September

or October 1961 GRIBANOV, according to NOSENKO, never

indicated his reasons for planning to appoint him Deputy

Chief of the American Department of for later promoting him

to Section Chief

and

then Deputy Chief of the seventh Depart-

ment in 1962.

In view of his impending transfer, starting in December

1961 NOSENKO, said he spent several hours each day in the

DEPUTY CHIEF Of the AMERICAN EMBASSY SECTION - 1960-1962:

Summary and Conclusion

According to NOSENKO, between January 1960 and January

1962 he was Deputy Chief of the American Embassy Section,

in which capacity he was occasional Acting Chief, super-

visor of all operations against code clerks and for some

months service attaches, case officer for priority KGB

target ABIDIAN, custodian of the Embassy security file, and

reviewer of all information obtained from microphones

emplaced in the Embassy.

From a comparison of NOSENKO's

assertions, amendments, and retractions with collateral

information, he was none of these.

Further, while he may

have been familiar with the activities of some agents of

the Embassy Section, his relationship with them was not in

the manner nor circumstances he claimed.

From his position as Deputy Chiéf NOSENKO claims complete

knowledge of KGB recruitments and recruitment attempts among

Embassy personnel during the period 1960-1961 and thereafter,

of CIA personnel identified by the KGB on the Embassy staff,

and of the status. of the KGB. cryptologic attack on Embassy

communications. His apparent ignorance of KOVSHUK's rela-

Fionship with [MORELIU and KOSOLAPOV's connection with GARLAND] Ob

refute his contention that he would have known of all KGB

recruitment attempts; that he was seemingly unaware of such

events while Deputy Chief demolishes his claim that he would

necessarily have learned of them later, and while assigned

elsewhere.

Contrary to his claim, NOSENKO does not know of

ClA personnel on the Embassy staff who were identified by

the KGB:

NOSENKO's information on the KGB cryptologic

attack reflects no special knowledge; it is superficial and

in erIOI.

Conclusion

NOSENKO was neither Deputy Chief of the American Embassy

Section nor a supervisor in that section.

halt JOHNSON's criticism of the USSR.

JOHNSON'S Information

According to: a statement given to the FBI, prior to his

Jo visit to the USSR JOHNSON had written a church authority. ir

Moscow requesting permission to preach there.

He was. in-

formed that some official permission was needed. JOHNSON 06

subsequently travelled to Moscow as a tourist, and he did

preach on one occasion but he suspended further such activi-

ty on the advice of Russian Baptist colleagues.29 During his

ten-day stay in Moscow JOHNSON wrote and posted letters to

some twenty persons outside the USSR.

GOHNSON reported to the Embassy in Moscow on 5 January

1962 that he had experienced an incident with Soviet plain-

Clothesmen at the Hotel Metropol earlier that day JOHNSON, O6

who had arrived in Moscow on 31 December 1961, explained

that he was dining alone at the Metropol restaurant on the

evening of 4 January when he was joined by a Soviet citizen

who identified himself as "a doctor from Riga". The "doctor"

to sc tong

spoke English poorly, and JoHNSoN agreed to visit the doctor s06

room at the hotel on the following day, when the doctor would

have with him a student friend who spoke English well. Soon

Obafter JOHNSON arrived in the doctor!'s room on 5 January, the

"student" made homosexual advances. JOHNSON protested and

started to leave when two plainclothesmen suddenly appeared

in the room and announced that all were under arrest. After

signing a statement in Russian, JOHNSON was taken to another 06

room where he was confronted with a man who identified him

self as Georgiy Ivanovich NIKOLOV. "the Chief of Police"

Ob After threatening JOHNSON. with imprisonment, "NIKOLOV" of-

fered to dismiss the matter, provided, JOHNSON would sign a U!

commitment not to criticize the Soviet Union when he returned

to the United States.

06

on 8 January JOHNSON telephoned the Embassy to report that

he had been recontacted by the "Police Chief" who reminded him

of his pledge and showed him incriminating photographs alieged-

ly taken of JOHNSON and

the "student" in the hotel room pre-

viously.

From

tional pseudonym Yuriy Ivanovich NIKOLAYEV

• Although JOHNSON apparently confirmec

NOSENKO's role, NOSENKO's version of the case

is incompatible with what must have been the

actual time frame.

According to NOSENKO's

version, within five days of JOHNSON's arrival06

in Moscow the KGB had discovered that he was

a homosexual, concluded from "two or three"

censored letters that he was a threat, and

ar.-

ranged his entrapment.

The rapid pace of

events suggests that JOHNSON's homosexuality 06

was already known to the KGB (if not to NOSENKO;

Ob before JOHNSON's arrival in Moscow. NOSENKO's

Obignorance of JOHNSON's preaching (probably the

actual cause of KGB concern) is further evi-

dence that NOSENKO did not know the complete

background of the KGB operation, and

that his

role was merely that of playing

the :"Police

Chief".

NOSENKO's participation in this case con-

tradicts his assertions about the timing of

his transfer from the American Department.

Six days before his return

to the Soviet Union, NOSENKO con-

tacted CIA:

Purpose of Trip to Geneva

NOSENKO arrived in Geneva on 10 March 1962 listed offi-

cially as an "expert" of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Af-

fairs attached to the Soviet delegation to the Disarmament

Conference.

NOSENKO explained that after GOLITSYN's defec-

tion in Finland lin December 1961] an order was issued that-

no delegation was to be permitted to depart the Soviet Union

without an accompanying KGB security officer.

INOSENKO has

since stated that he can recall no such order.]

Explaining in 1962 how he came to be designated,

as the

security escort, NOSENKO said he argued that he was needed

to direct the fifteen case officers in his section, but

GRIBANOV stated that Foreign Minister Gromyko was leading

the delegation and that someone of an appropriate senior rank

should accompany the delegation, not just a senior case offi-

cer, but a section chief or a deputy chief or a chief of a

department.

NOSENKO was the most junior section chief. His

immediate superior in the Seventh Department approved the

trip on the basis that it would last only a month.

(SEVENTH DEPARTMENT - January 1962-January 1964)

In addition to his general security duties with the

delegation, NOSENKO said in 1962 that he was given a

special assignment to check on a senior delegation advisor,

Pavel Fedorovich SHAKHOV (see below).

During the 1965 interrogations, NOSENKO provided somewhat

varing accounts of the background of his 1962 trip to Geneva:

He said that GRIBANOV had nothing to do with his assignment,

but that [S.G.] BANNIKOV, the Deputy Chief of the Second

Directorate who supervised the Soviet Delegations Abroad

Department, made the selection. The latter department was

investigating SHAKHOV, and BANNIKOV was concerned with the

selection of a security officer because SHAKHOV, who was

suspected of being a Western agent, was to be in the delega-

tion.

Because of the seriousness attached to the case, the

Delegations Department wanted a chief of section as case

officer, and when a request was made to the Seventh Depart-

ment Chief, CHELNOKOV, the latter agreed to NOSENKO's as-

signment.

NOSENKO stated that CHELNOKOV, his superior and

friend, let him go to Geneva as "a treat"

to ten that

, even though he

had just assumed his duties as Chief of the American-

British Commonwealth Section, he had no deputy,. and the trip

was occurring on the eve of the tourist season.

Investigation of SHAKHOV

According to NOSENKO, M.G. SITNIKOV, representing the

Soviet Delegations Department, conducted investigations of

SHAKHOV in Geneva in 1961, but had been unable to resolve the

KGB suspicions about him.

discussed the SHAKHOV case with SITNIKOV and with. LYALIN, the

Soviet Delegations Department case officer in charge of the

SHAKHOV case.

He also read various materials on the case,

including an investigative plan drawn up by LYALIN.

NOSENKO has said that SHAKHOV was under suspicion in 1962

because he was working with different delegations at different

conferences, and there was some evidence that in Geneva ear-

lier he was

somehow connected with American diplomat Davia MARK,

In that KGB report he was depicted as "not good"

and

not wanting. to work as an agent"

NOSENKO stated that SHAKHOV had served with the Ministry

of Foreign Affairs in the United States and that during that

service he acted

as an agent-recruiter for the KGB.

SHAKHOV

was permitted to

travel abroad even though suspected of being

an American agent, because he belonged to the Ministry of

Foreign Affairs, and "the KGB could do nothing about his

trips abroad'

"There was no proof, only suspicions, and

furthermore, SHAKHOV was a member of the personal staff of

the head of

the Soviet delegation, S.K. Tsarapkin.'

According

to NOSENKO, SHAKHOV was not and never had been a KGB officer.!

Comment:

SHAKHOV has served in and

visited the United

States since 1942, when he was assigned to the

Soviet Consulate General in New York. He at-

tended the 1945. Conference on International

Organization in San Francisco, and he had at-

tended a number of sessions of the UN General

NOSENKO described the various ways he had tested suspicions

of SHAKHOV in Geneva.

He gave SHAKHOV disinformation and then

watched for an indication that ne passed lt on to his America:

contacts.

SHAKHOV was told to perform countersurveillance

tasks during a meeting by NOSENKO with an imaginary agent,

while other KGB officers checked for signs that SHAKHOV had

forewarned the Americans about the meeting. Finally NOSENEO

revealed to SHAKHOV the location of a KGB dead drop and

checked five days later to see whether the specially prepared

materials emplaced had been disturbed in any way. NOSENKO's

conclusion was that SHAKHOV was absolutely free of suspicion.

and it was his intention to report this finding when he re-

turned to KGB Headquarters from Geneva.

Security Escort Officer for Soviet Disarmament Delegation

NOSENKO said that he was the sole KGB officer with the 94-

man Soviet delegation to the Disarmament Conference and as

such he was responsible for the security and behavior of the

entire delegation. (KGB officers I.S. MAYOROV and M.S.

TSYMBAL came with the delegation to Geneva, but they had left

Geneva before NOSENKO made the foregoing statement to CIA.]

To assist him in carrying out his security functions, NOSENKO

had the services of

a number of coopted informants of the KGB

who were serving in the delegation. (NOSENKO has never re-

ported what, if any, security checks he ran on the delegates

in his charge, or what, if any, information his informants

provided him.]

NOSENKO has never been precise about how he spent his days

and nights in Geneva, but he has indicated that he disposed

of his time as he saw fit, and for the most part had little

to do.

He explained in 1962 that he could come and go as he

pleased because Ambassador Zorin knew who he was, as did most.

of the delegation.

No one paid him any attention. It was

known that he was not really a Ministry of Foreign Affairs

officer, and he could absent himself from conference meetings

at any time.

Visits to the Geneva KGB Legal Residency

• Virtually every day, NOSENKO told CIA in 1962, he went to

the KGB Legal Residency in Geneva, and if he stayed away for

more than a day or two, Legal Rezident S.I. GAVRICHEV would

invariably ask NOSENKO where he had been

• keeping himself.

GAVRICHEV, according to NOSENKO, treated

him with deference,

and shortly after his arrival in Geneva in March 1962,

NOSENKO gave a lecture on counterintelligence to the assembled

members of the Legal Residency.

This lecture was given at

GAVRICHEV's request, although it was only after some hesita-

tion on the part of the Legal Rezident that all of his subor-

dinates were brought together to hear NOSENKO.

In return

for helping the Legal Residency to perform countersurveillance

on several occasions, NOSENKO said, he was sometimes allowed

by GAVRICHEV to have

the use of an

operational car and driver

to go shopping and carry out other private errands.

[NOSENKO

was not under CIA surveillance at any time in 1962 in Geneva

and his claims as to his activities there, aside from his

meetings with CIA, can be neither confirmed nor refuted.]

KGB Officers within the Soviet Delegation

NOSENKO claimed that he would know of any others, and he

was the sole KGB officer within the Soviet Disarmament Dele-

gation in 1962.

Among delegates he identified only Oleg

GRINEVSKIY as having any connection with the KGB.

GRINEVSKIY

was one of NOSENKO's own agents within the delegation: in

Moscow he was handled by KGB officers of the Intelligentsia

and Correspondents Department of the Second Chief Directorate.

Among other delegates NOSENKO described A.K. KISLOV and V.G.

FILATOV. According to NOSENKO, KISLOV was head of the Ameri-

can Section of TASS and was "a

genuine correspondent"; "de-

finitely not an intelligence officer".

Comment: CIA had tentatively identified all three of

the delegates as KGB officers. 'KISLOV was Ob-

served in apparent KGB operational activity in

both Washington and Moscow.

at the time.

Association with Other Soviets

According to NOSENKO, the Soviets he saw most often in

Geneva in 1962 were A.K. KISLOV (see above), Yu.I. GUK, and

M.S. TSYMBAL. (Both KISLOV and GUK were involved in the

"ANDREY" case:

see p. 33 .)

A.K. KISLOV

TASS correspondent KISLOV was one of the three other dele-

gates besides NOSENKO staying at the Hotel Ariane in Geneva.

NOSENKO said he arranged for KISLOV's name to be given as a

notional source of information on Soviet disarmament policy

to KGB double agent BELITSKIY (see below). NOSENKO drank

and caroused with KISLOV while in Geneva, and KISLOV was

NOSENKO's companion in early June, when NOSENKO either

squandered or was robbed of KGB operational funds. [the loss

he asked CIA to make goodl, and on the night of 10 June, when

he squandered the 2000 Swiss francs CIA provided on wine and

women.

With reference to the threat posed his security by

KISLOV's knowledge of his profligacy, NOSENKO said that KISLOV

was "too drunk to know what was going on", and in any event

constituted no threat.

In 1964 NOSENKO reported for the first time that KISLOV

had been a KGB operational contact while

stationed in the

United States and that NOSENKO had been introduced to KISLOV

by a KGB officer in Moscow prior to departing for Geneva in

1962, so that he could use KISLOV at the conference.

On the

basis of NOSENKO's favorable report afterwards, he said,

KISLOV had been recruited as a KGB agent on his return.

In 1966 NOSENKO named the Soviets living with him at the

Ariane Hotel in 1962, but did not name KISLOV.

Yu. I. GUK

Implying that their friendship was of long standing,

NOSENKO related in 1962 that he and GUK

were together nearly

every day in Geneva, where they went out to chat and have a

few drinks. As a consequence, NOSENKO was granted access to

the residency and was ablé to

elicit information about some

of GUK's operations in Geneva.

He described his

"big, big

friend" GUK as the Deputy Legal Rezident in Geneva and the

only "strong officer" in the residency.

Comment:

In 1964 NOSENKO attributed his gaining access

to the residency in 1962 to TSYMBAL, not to

GUK.

M.S. TSYMBAL

In 1962 NOSENKO reported ISYMBAL's presence in Geneva and

identified him

as Chief

the Illegals Directorate of the

KGB First Chief Directorate.

He alluded to having spoken with

him, but placed no particular emphasis on their relationship.

In 1964 NOSENKO claimed that he had been dealing with

TSYMBAL since 1960 or 1961, when he was looking for some

candidates for

recruitment and came across some whose back

ground would have nade them suitable for the Special illegals!

Directorate.

in 1962 and established

the precedent from which he was

granted access in 1964.

After several dates, NOSENKO could

longer reach her at her apartment, and he concluded that she

had told her superiors that he was a Russian and had pro-

bably believed him to be an intelligence officer.

Comment:

According to an official British report, when

NOSENKO became too persistent in his attentions

and the secretary reported the contact to her

superiors she was withdrawn immediately from

Switzerland and she later resigned from the

Foreign Office.

This same incident came to the attention of

the Swiss service), which later reported it to

CIA, without details, as an attempt by NOSENKO

to recruit the girl.

According to this report,

"after a time it became evident that NOSENKO'S

interest in her was not only sexual, but also

in information to which she had access in the

course of her duties":

A Swiss official in|

Geneva told CIA that NOSENKO had definitely tried

to recruit the secretary and that he attempted

to obtain "disarmament secrets" from her.

learned of the case through his friendship with the chief

of the Second ("Active Line") Section of the American Depart-

ment, V.I. PETROV. BELITSKIY wasia KGB agent whom American

Intelligence had recruited in London: he had never been met

by the Americans in the Soviet Union. NOSENKO did not know

the date of recruitment

but knew the case was already in pro-

gress during his second

assignment with the Embassy Section

(January 1960-January 1962). BELITSKIY had been ạ KGB agent

for a "long, long" time and was a KGB agent when he first

aguary 2,a2)

went abroad (prior to his recruitment by American Intelli-

gence).

The KGB's purpose in running the BELITSKIY operation was

to lure American Intelligence into meeting the agent inside

the Soviet Union; to learn the channels and means through

which American Intelligence communicated with agents inside

the Soviet Union

This was the "most important task" of the

Second Chief Directorate. Although BELITSKIY, in meeting

with his American case officers, continually pleaded fear of

contacts with American Intelligence in Moscow, this was a

ruse; the real KGB intent was to use BELITSKIY to lure Ameri-

can Intelligence into contacting him in the Soviet Union.

After BELITSKIY was recruited in London, CIA "did not go on

with him. didn't hold any meetings with him'. Nevertheless.

he said, the KGB "cherished the hope...to lead him in some-

what deeper"

The KGB First Chief Directorate, with its own

responsibilities and objectives, was unaware of Second Chief

Directorate objectives in the BELITSKIY case.

The First

Chief Directorate, through Department D, provided dezinformat-

siya [disinformation]

at the Second: Chief Directorate's re-

quest, but in this case, as in other "games", it did not know

for what ultimate purpose the disinformation would be used.

(In such cases I.I. AGAYANTS, Chief of Department D, did not

even know in what country the disinformation was to be used;

let alone the identity of the agent.)

Comment:

According to GOLITSYN, Department D runs its

operations alone or in conjunction with (never

subordinate to) other KGB departments:

NOSENKO did not actively participate in the case until he

received in Geneva a cable from Moscow directing him to give

advice to the young and inexperienced case officer V.L. ARTE-

MOV .

ARTEMOV had not worked on the BELITSKIY case in Moscow

either; he also had been

sent to Geneva to work on counter-

intelligence matters and only to direct BELITSKIY if the Ameri-

cans should contact the agent. BELITSKIY had been "inserted"

in a World Health Organization Delegation in the hope that CIA

would "find him".

As a result of that KGB instruction, NOSENKO juined with

ARTEMOV in directing BELITSKIY's meetings with the latter's

American case officers.

BELITSKIY was first met in Geneva by

the

American case officer "Bob", and later by "Henry", who

was "called out from the States"

• BELITSKIY noted that the

name on the door of the apartment where he met his American

case officers was not the same as that of the person nose

apartment it was alleged to be, and that the apartment itself

had

an "un-lived-in" look.

When the American case officers asked BELITSKIY whether he

could establish contact with a Russian on the Disarmament

Delegation, NOSENKO advised ARTEMOV not to use anyone from

the Soviet Foreign Ministry. NOSENKO proposed instead that

BELITSKIY claim to get information from the head of the

American Department of TASS, A.K. KISLOV.

The information,

of course, would be (disinformation) furnished by the KGB.

In case the Americans would check, NOSENKO and ARTEMOV ar-

ranged for BELITSKIY to be introduced to KISLOV.

The KGB believed that CIA had accepted BELITSKIY's bona

fides. From the KGB viewpoint, however, while BELITSKIY was

not a bad

agent!

he was apt to go too far sometimes, and "add

things on his own".

For this reason, the KGB limited BELIT-

SKIY'

s time spent with CIA, to lessen the chance that the

agent might say something which would cause CIA to sense that

he was a plant.

Comment:

NOSENKO's information about the BELITSKIY-CIA

relationship is substantially correct, except

for some inaccuracies about the origin of the

case.

BELITSKIY, a commentator for Radio. Mos-

cow, as NOSENKO described, in Geneva did meet

CIA officers using the aliases "Bob"' and "Henry"

in a safe apartment.

NOSENKO's version

of his role in the case,

however, is implausible.

He asserts that BELIT-

SKIY, a prominent Russian with acquaintances

among influential officials of the Soviet Govern-

ment, an agent ostensibly under the control of

CIA

for

several

years, was sent by. the KGB to

Geneva to resume contact with CIA.

The KGB, ac-

cording to NOSENKO, sent neither the responsible

case officer nor an officer of the KGB section

responsible for the operation. NOSENKO states

that the KGB instead detailed a 'young and in-

experienced" KGB officer who happened to be in

Geneva at the time,

an officer who had no prior

connection with the BeLlIskly. case nor even

knowledge..of operating conditions in Geneva.

NOSENKO further states that the KGB then instruc-

ted. NOSENKO, who had learned of the case unoffi-

cally who had no experience of training in

double agent operations, and who was similarly

in Geneva for other reasons, to guide the

"inexperienced' KGB officer, NOSENKO can cite

no guidance provided by KGB Headquarters, al

though he claims he exchanged messages with

Moscow about the case:

ARTEMOV was not inexperienced.

He had hạo

continuous service with the Second Chief Direc-

torate at least since 1958, and had been involved

with a series of:CIA American tourist agents in

the Soviet Union. Although allegedly familiar

with ARTEMOV, NOSENKO is unaware of the latter's

involvement with American tourist agents in

1958 and 1959, during a period when NOSENKO

claims to have been Deputy Chief of the Seventh

Department's American Section.

Under interrogation NOSENKO did not know

how, when, or where the BELITSKIY operation

started, did not know the nature of British li

involvement, did not know the operational đe-

tails and contact arrangements BELITSKIY had

with CIA, did not know BELITSKIY's pattern of

activity

in Moscow or in Geneva, and did not

know the alleged objective of the KGB opera-

tion, e. g., the substance of the "disinformation"

which BELITSKIY was to provide CIA.

From the foregoing it is concluded that

NOSENKO did not exercise any supervisory func-

tion in the BELITSKIY case.

Contact with CIA

Có

On 5 June 1962 U.S. Foreign Service Officer David MARK

reported to CIA in Geneva that he had been approached by a

Soviet citizen whom he believed to be Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO,

a member of the Soviet Disarmament Delegation. NOSENKO had

merely suggested that they get together for a talk on the

following day.. In late afternoon on 6 June, NOSENKO told

06 MARK privately that he would like to talk to MARk as soon as UG

possible. He was "nöt going to pump him for information", but

"simply wanted to tell him some things". A luncheon meeting

was arranged for? June; although NOSENO indicated that he

preferred an earlier date.0 MARK advised CIA of: the appoint-

ment and commented that the approach seemed so unusual that

it might be an offer of cooperation or defection.

At the 9 June luncheon with MARK] NOSENKO identified him-

self as a counterintelligence officer sent to Geneva to ensure

the security of the Soviet delegation. He knew that MARK) had U6

previously served in Moscow and (erroneously] believed him to

be an American intelligence officer.

NOSENKO said ie needed

approximately 900 Swiss francs immediately to cover KGB opera-

tional funds which he had squandered on liquor and a prosti-

tute in Geneva, and offered for this amount to sell two items

of information to American Intelligence.

The first item was

the identity of an American, a former employee of the Embassy

in Moscow,

who was a KGB agent. "near ciphers" in the Washing-

ton area.

The second item was the identity of a Soviet citi-

zen in Moscow who, although ostensibly a CIA agent, had been

planted on CIA by the KGB.

Although NOSENKO proposed a one-

time transaction, he acknowledged to MARK] that he might be

unable to avoid deeper involvement with American Intelligence.

MARK introduced NOSENKO to a CIA officer the evening of

9 June and NOSENKO was taken to the first of five lengthy

meetings held in a CIA safehouse. At the initial meeting

NOSENKO described himself as a KGB major experienced in opera-

tions against the American Embassy in Moscow and against

American tourists and other travellers to the Soviet Union.

He told of his financial difficulties and repeated his offer

to sell the two specified items of information. He said that

the need for money was his immediate motive for contacting

CIA, although in the ensuing discussion he asserted also that

he was dissatisfied with the Communist regime in the Soviet

Union.

NOSENKO emphasized that he had no intention of be-

coming an American agent and that after his proposed trans-

action, he would have no further contact with CIA. Despite

this

assertion, after describing the cases of "ANDREY"

(Dayle SMITH, see P. 33) and the KGB double agent BELIISKIY

(see p. 282), NOSENKO supplied considerable biographic infor-

mation about himself and also discussed in general terms cer-

tain additional KGB operations as well as KGB organization

and operational methods in Moscow. He understood, as he had

told MARK earlier, that CIA would want more information, and

he agreed to meet again two days later.

NOSENKO met CIA representatives four more times in Geneva.

With the second meeting on 11 June, his initially expressed

reservations disappeared almost entirely. He answered most

questions put to him on KGB organization and operations, most

of his information being limited to the Second Chief Directo-

rate. Besides "ANDREY" and BELITSKIY, he provided leads to

more than a score of American citizens who had been compro-

mised or recruited by the KGB, and information on the KGB

audio surveillance operation against the Embassy in Moscow.

Among foreign agents of the KGB NOSENKO identified Canadian

Ambassador WATKINS (see p. 23 ) and described a British Ad-

miralty employee (William VASSALL, see p. 30 ) •

He talked

freely of his activities in Geneva, including his association

with KGB officers there, his visits to the KGB residency

and his security duties with respect to the Soviet delega-

tion:

NOSENKO seemed to CIA to be what he claimed: a KGB

officer with personal knowledge of important and sensitive

KGB operations.

He described his education, his service in

the Naval GRU, his entry into the KGB and the general func-

tions and operating techniques of the various components of

the Second Chief Directorate in which he had served, along

with the approximate dates of his service.

Ultimately the only restriction which NOSENKO placed on

his cooperation with CIA was his refusal to permit communica-

tion with him in the Soviet Union.

He was willing to meet

with CIA representatives during future trips outside the

Soviet Union, which he estimated would occur about once every other

year. He said he would not consider defecting except in cir-

cumstances in which his personal security was endangered,

citing as reasons his devotion to his wife and children (and

fear of KGB reprisal against them if he fled), his widowed

mother's dependence on him, and his love of Russia and the

Russian people:

NOSENKO promised to contact CIA and arrangements were

made for him to do so, when he came to the West again.

Meanwhile, he expressed the intention to do everything within

limits imposed by concern for his own security to obtain in-

formation which he was informed was of interest to CIA.

from Geneva, NOSENKO

Chiéf of the American-British Commonwealth Section:

Summary and Conclusion

According to NOSENKO, he requested transfer to the Seventh

Department to avoid being named Deputy Chief of the American

Department over his then-superior, the experienced and highly

successful KGB officer KOVSHUK.

He is adamant that the trans-

fer took place "before (the defection of] GOLITSYN", which he

asserts occured in mid-January 1962.

Among his other functions

in the Seventh Department, he.cites directing five agents

whom he brought from the American Department.

In his initial

capacity as Chief of the American Section, NOSENKO claims in-

volvement only in the W.E. JOHNSON case, his time being spent Ok

either in "reading in" on

his new job or preparing for his

initial trip to Geneva.

He alleges that he was directed to

accompany the Soviet delegation to Geneva for an extended

period, in behalf of another Second Directorate Department,

over his objections, when he had no deputy to assume his func-

tions in his absence, and on the eve of the tourist season.

sell information for a relatively small sum. Back in Moscow,

immediately after participating in the KGB approach to BRAUNS, 06

he claims he became Deputy Chief of the entire 100-man

Besides the implausibility of NOSENKO's account of seeking.

GOLITSYN defected on 15 December 1961. If NOSENKO transferred,

(NOSENKO explained in

another context that the KGB is wary of foreigners' contacts

with Soviet Jews because the Israeli Intelligence Service

many suspicious contacts, both the KGB First and Second

and recalled his earlier identification as a GRU agent.

Arrest of BARGHOORW

At the first of the 1964 meetings in Geneva NOSENKO

described the provocation and arrest of Yale University

Professor Frederick BARGHOORN in late 1963. NOSENKO's

most comprehensive statement, from which the following

paragraphs were largely drawn, was made on 9 June 1964.

NOSENKO said that the purpose of the KGB operation

against BARGHOORN was to retaliate for persona

non grata

action taken against three Soviets in New York City in

the case of John W. BUTENKO [in November 1963] and to

secure a hostage in exchange for a fourth Soviet (Igor

IVANOV) in the BUTENKO case who was jailed.

(NOSENKO

had asserted in Geneva, earlier, that the operation

against BARGHOORN "was

to discourage future arrests

such as that of IVANOV, not because of any special im-

portance of IVANOV himself.")

NOSENKO's Information

In 1963 four KGB First Chief Directorate officers

assigned to the New York Legal Residency were caught in

operational

activity in the United States. Of the four,

three had diplomatic immunity, but one was a chauffeur

and had only a service passport. The three Soviet

diplomats were held three or four hours by the American

authorities and

then released.

IVANOV, the chauffeur,

was arrested since he did not have diplomatic immunity.

GRIBANOV, Chief of the KGB Second Chief Directorate,

learned of this arrest probably the next day and was

directed by KGB Chairman Semichastnyy to take "necessary

measures."

GRIBANOV thereupon called to his office

NOSENKO; A.G. KOVALENKO, Chief of the Seventh Department;

and G.I. GRYAZNOV and Ye. M. RASHCHEPOV from the

American Department.

After

describing the arrest,

GRIBANOV asked what

information the Second Chief

Directorate Departments had on any American, Embassy

employee or tourist, that could serve as the victim of

an (retaliatory] arrest. RASHCHEPOV and GRYAZNOV said

that at that very moment there were three or four

American Service Attaches in Rostov and that, in the

opinion of the American Department, these officers might

be carrying electronic apparatus.

It was known that they

had cameras, that they had been taking photographs, and

they had been observed taking notes.

They could be

arrested in Rostov before they took the return plane to

MOSCOW.

(SEVENTH DEPARTMENT - January 1962-January 1964)

GRIBANOV instructed the two representatives of the

American Department to write a report on what other

possibilities existed. He also told them to request

permission to arrest and search the Service Attaches:

GRIBANOV then asked what pertinent information was

held by the Seventh Department.

He was told that there

were relatively few. American tourists in the Soviet

Union at that time.

These included BARGHOORN, who was

mentioned to GRIBANOV along with one other (name not

recalled). NOSENKO and KOVALENKO reported, however,

that the KGB had no "strong" materials to use against

them.

They were ordered to make an immediate study of

the situation and to report back to GRIBANOV as soon

as possible.

Returning to the Seventh Department, NOSENKO and

KOVALENKO gathered the entire American

Tourist Section

in their officé.

In a general discussion, it was

decided that BARGHOORN was the only possible American

target.

All information on BARGHOORN was gathered,

and NOSENKO and KOVALENKO took it to GRIBANOV.

GRIBANOV read it and was pleased; he was sure that

BARGHOORN was connected with American Intelligence:

He then asked what could be done. NOSENKO and

KOVALENKO reported that BARGHOORN was

then in Tbilisi

and that, in fact, Ye: N. NOSKOV (case officer,:

American Tourist Section) was in Tbilisi with a woman

doctor from the KGB Operational Technical Directorate

for the purpose of working against BARGHOOPN; the

doctor had some special substance which had been used

to make BARGHOORN so violently ill that he had to be

hospitalized. While he was in the hospital, a careful

search had been made of his belongings, but

nothing of

operational interest had been found. In addition, a

KGB agent was placed in BARGHOORN's room as a patient;

he made anti-Soviet statements and offered BARGHOORN

"materials": but BARGHOORN did not rise to the bait.

At the time of this meeting with GRIBANOV, BARGHOORN

was scheduled to fly

• from Tbilisi to Moscow the fol-

lowing morning, and the KGB knew from a phone tap that

he had an appointment with Theodore ORCHARD of the 06

2 British Embassy"at the Hotel Metropol the following

evening

It was GRIBANOV who raised the possibility of giving

"materials" to BARGHOORN in Moscow.

NOSENKO said that

this would be a provocation, but GRIBANOV replied that

this made no difference.

He instructed NOSENKO and

KOVALENKO to locate an agent who could be used to pass

the compromising material to BARGHOORN and told them

to write a summary of BARGHOORN's background with a

proposal that the Second Chief Directorate arrest him

"when he obtains materials which are of interest to

American Intelligence."

This was to be sent in letter

form to Semichastnyy over GRIBANOV's signature; the

letter was not to indicate how BARGHOORN was to receive

the materials.

(That the evidence was to be planted

was not to be mentioned.)

GRIBANOV took a one-page letter on BARGHOORN, along

with a similar letter from GRYAZNOV and RASHCHEPOV

concerning the Service Attaches, to SemichastnyY. While

the four -- NOSENKO, KOVALENKO, GRYAZNOV and RASHCHEPOV -

were waiting in GRIBANOV's office for his return,

GRYAZNOV received a telephone call from the Rostov KGB

organization informing. him that the Service Attaches

were in the air on their way back to Moscow. Shortly

thereafter,. GRIBANOV returned with the news that the

Chairman of the KGB had approved the arrests of the

Service Attaches as well as BARGHOORN.

Khrushchev was

absent. from Moscow at the time, but Semichastnyy had

called BREZHNEV and secured his approval.

When GRIBANOV. learned from GRYAZNOV that the Service

Attaches were already on their way back to Moscow, he

became furious and sent GRYAZNOV out "to do the job or

die."

Meanwhile, arrangements were made with the

"Department D" (the KGB. element responsible for dis-

information, subordinate to the First Chief Directorate).

to provide materials on missiles which could be passed

to BARGHOORN.

While these were being picked up, NOSENKO

and KOVALENKO returned to their office to plan the arrest.

BARGHOORN was placed under immediate surveillance

upon his arrival in Moscow.

At 1810 hours a radio

message was received from one of the surveillance cars

that BARGHOORN had gone to the American Embassy, and it

was decided that the agent (name not recalled, aged 25

to 30 years) would be placed in contact with him as soon

as he came

out.

The KGB knew BARGHOORN had an appoint-

ment with ORCHARD of the British Embassy at 1900 hours, 0627

but at 1900 hours a report was received that BARGHOORN

had left the American Embassy in the American

Ambassador's car.

He was alone but for the

Soviet driver.

Nothing could be done while

BARGHOORN was in the moving car.

A check on

05 ORCHARD established that he was in the downstairs

hall of the hotel waiting. It was therefore

decided to approach BARGHOORN wien he left the car

at the hotel.

No sooner had BARGHOORN stepped out. of the car

than the agent approached.

"You are an American?"

the agent asked.

"Yes."

"Please take it," the

agent

said.

The agent put the packet containing the

materials on missiles in BARGHOORN's inside coat

pocket and then ran off.

BARGHOORN had taken only one of two steps when he

was seized by NOSKOV and Petr POPTSOV, another case:

officer of the American Tourist Section, and tola

he was under arrest.

A surveillance car pulled up

BARGHOORN was placed in the car, handcüffed (on

GRIBANOV's orders, because the Soviets arrested in

the United States had received similar treatment)

and driven to a Militia station where a room had been

prepared.

L.I. YEFPEMOV and K.G. KRUPNOV from the American

Tourist Section were waiting at the Militia station,

KRUPNOV to interrogate BARGHOORN and YEFREMOV to be

the interpreter.

When BARGHOORN was brought into the

station, an "incident report" form was filled out, and

a document was

prepared requesting permission to hold

him 48 hours.

Between 0200 and 0300 hours BARGHOORN

was taken to the KGB inner prison. At 0400 hours the

Seventh Department case officers were released with

instructions to report for duty at 0930 hours.

NOSENKO and the others went höme

KRUPNOV began the questioning in Russian at 1000

hours the next day. Although BARGHOORN speaks good

Russian, YEFREMOV remained in case he would be needed

to interpret. NOSENKO entered the room several times

during these sessions.

(Although NOSENKO did not

want to reveal his face to BARGHOORN because he knew

BARGHOORN would be released, GRIBANOV had told

KOVALENKO that NOSENKO should be there when they reached

the point where BARGHOORN was to tell how he obtained

the missile documents. The first sessions

concentrated on general matters,

such as

BARGHOORN's life history.

After one and one half hours of questioning

BARGHOORN agreed that the

materials were on him

when he was

arrested, but

he maintained that they had

been placed on his person.

He said

that he thought

they were "newspapers or something," that he did

not

know what they were.

The package was then opened and

shown to BARGHOORN; it contained about 20 to 25 pages

of information on missiles.

"BARGHOORN was not, of

course, given a close look" at the materials.

Following BARGHOORN's admission, another declaration

was drawn up by KRUPNOV and signed by KRUPNOV,

KOVALENKO, and GRIBANOV.

NOSENKO and KRUPNOV then

took it to the office of the Chief Prosecutor where

the incident report, the first interrogation, and

the first and second declarations were reported to

MISHUTIN, the First Deputy Chief Prosecutor.

GRIBANOV

directed

that all materials on BARGHOORN, including

information from KGB Archives, be given to the KGB

Department of Prosecution

that they could begin

legal proceedings against BARGHOOR.

After this, all

interrogations were conducted by that department;

KRUPNOV was dropped from the case, although YEFREMOV.

continued to act as interpreter.

Comment:

BARGHOORN's version of his entrapment,

arrest;

and interrogation coincide fairly

precisely with the version provided by

NOSENKO.

He identified NOSENKO from a

photograph as a KGB officer present at

one stage of the interrogation on the

second day of his arrest and said

NOSENKO took some part in the pro-

ceedings.

He recalled NOSENKO as

being

"clever and quick-witted" and as "giving

the impression that he was not a dedicated

careerist, but opportunistic and adaptive:

he seemed not to care about what he was

doing, but doing a good job nevertheless."

The OSWALD CASE

NOSENKO's knowledge of the KGB's interest in

OSWALD stemmed

1 from his claimed Tourist Department

assignments. He asserted that while Deputy

Chief

of the American Section in 1959 he participated in

the KGB determination that OSWALD was of no operational

interest.

In September 1963, when NOSENKO was Deputy

Chief of the Tourist Department, he

was informed of

OSWALD's visit to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City to

apply to return to the USSR. Immediately following

President Kennedy's assassination, NOSENKO,

as

Deputy Chief of the Tourist Department, reviewed KGB:

records of OSWALD's stay in the Soviet Union including

the Second Chief Directorate file on OSWALD.

For continuity of presentation, both periods of

NOSENKO's alleged involvement with the OSWALD case

(1959-60 and 1963) are discussed here.

The information NOSENKO provided on the OSwALd

case is significant if it substantiates. NOSENKO'S

claimed positions in the KGB and confirms the validity

of his claim that he knew the extent of KGB involvement

with OSWALD:.

NOSENKO's Information

Residence in the USSR

Prior to OSWALD's arrival in the USSR, he was

completely unknown to the KGB.

Moreover,

upon

receipt of his visa application, the KGB Second Chief

Directorate determined that he was not of sufficient

importance to justify any special interest by the

Seventh Department:

Not until about October 1959,

when

OSWALD expressed a desire to remain in the USSR

did he come to the attention of NOSENKO, who was, at

that time, Deputy Chief of the American Section of

the Seventh Department.

'Al1 available materials on

him were thereupon collected and examined - the visa

application, Inturist reports, interpreters' reports,

reports from hotel agents,

and the results of a check

of KGB Archives.

NOSENKO's subordinate, KRUPNOV

interviewed the interpreter to whom OSWALD had stated

his wish to stay in the USSr.

• Top Secret

(SEVENTH DEPARTMENT - January 1962-January 1964)

Although the KGB considered it possible that OSWALD

might be an American agent, the KGB did nothing to

investigate this possibility because "this would be

done after the person is allowed to stay in the Soviet

Union."

Surveillance of OSWALD was not increased after

his request, and OSWALD was not interviewed by the KGB

in an attempt to establish his intentions.

KRUPNOV

sent NOSENKO, his chief, a memorandum on information

which had been received concerning OSWALD. The memorandum

cited reports by KGB informants at the Hotel Berlin, where

OSWALD was staying in accordance with an Inturist itinerary

and a two-page report by the Inturist interpreter to whom

OSWALD made his initial request to remain in the Soviet

Union. A file incorporating all information which KRUPNOV

had collected was thereupon opened in NOSENKO's section.

From this information NOSENKO and KRUPNOV concluded

that OSWALD was of no interest to the KGB, and both agreed

that OSWALD appeared somewhat "abnormal."

For this reason

NOSENKO instructed KRUPNOV to advise OSWALD through the

Inturist interpreter that he would not be permitted to

remain permanently in the USSR and that he must depart on

the expiration of his visa, then seek re-entry as a

permanent resident through normal channels at the Soviet

Embassy in Washington.

KRUPNOV followed NOSENKO's orders,

and either that day or the next NOSENKO learned that OSWALD

failed to appear for a scheduled tour arranged by his

Inturist guide. This prompted a search, and after several

hours, OSWALD was found in his hotel room, bleeding heavily

from self-inflicted wounds. After hearing of this incident

IIOm KRUPNOV, NOSENKO then reported it to K.N. DUBAS, Chief

of the Seventi Department. NOSENKO believed that DUBAS in

turn reported it to GRIBANOV, head of the KGB Second Chief

Directorate.

GRIBANOV upheld NOSENKO's original decision

that the

KGB should not become involved with OSWALD and

that OSWALD should not be permitted to remain in the USSR.

There was no

attempt to debrief OSWALD because "he was

not an interesting person and wasn't normal,"

OSWALD was

never questioned on his past nor asked to write an auto-

biography.

NOSENKO did not know who eventually granted

OSWALD permission to reside temporarily in the USSR

or who approved issuance of his temporary residence permit.

The KGB gave instructions that he not be allowed to live

in the Moscow area: Either the Soviet Red Cross or the

Ministry of Foreign Affairs may have made this decision

to assign OSWALD to Minsk. The Seventh Department updated

his file, and it was sent, along with a cover letter pre-

pared by KRUPNOV, to the local KGB organization in Minsk.

KRUPNOV's letter summarized the case and specifically in-

structed local authorities there to take no action con-

cerning OSWALD except to observe his activities "passively"

to make sure that he was not an American Intelligence agent

on temporary "sleeper" status.

NOSENKO read this letter,

and it was signed by DUBAS. On the basis of the instructions

contained in the letter, NOSENKO said, no active steps could

be taken in Minsk without KGB Headquarters approval.: It was

NOSENKO's opinion that the only coverage of OSWALD during

his stay in Minsk consisted of periodic checks at his

place of employment, questioning of his neighbors and

associates, and coverage of his mail. After OSWALD'S

threatened

second suicide attempt, the KGB "washed its

hands.

of him" and that even though there was considered

to be

some possibility that he was a "sleeper agent,"

KGB Headquarters interest in him while he was in Minsk

was "practically, nil. "n

Request to Return to the USSR

The KGB Second Chief Directorate was not concerned

with OSWALD's return to the United States in June 1962.

by which time NOSENKO was Deputy Chief of the seventh

Department.

No further word on him was received at KGB

Headquarters until he appeared at the Soviet Embassy in

Mexico City in September 1963 and requested a visa to

return to the Soviet Union. The Mexico Legal Residency

reported his visit to KGB Headquarters by cable, re-.

questing information. The KGB First Chief Directorate

had no record on OSWALD. M.I. TURALIN, Deputy Chief of

the First Chief Directorate's Service Number Two (Counter-

intelligence Abroad) called the Seventh Department to

see if the latter element had any information on OSWALD;

The Chief of the Sixth Section of the Seventh Department,

V.K. ALEKSEYEV, received the call and reported the in-

quiry to Seventh Department Chief CHELNOKOV of to KOVALENKO.

NOSENKO thought he himself was present at the time. ALEKSEYEV

was given OSWALD's background, including his suicide attempt

and the fact that he was not considered normal, and was

told to advise the First Chief Directorate that OSWALD should

not be permitted to return to the Soviet Union. ALEKSEYEV

relayed this information to the First Chief Directorate.

NOSENKO did not know to whom OSWALD had spoken at the

Soviet Embassy in Mexico City, and he knew of no contacts

between OSWALD and Cubans or representatives of the Cuban

Government there or elsewhere.

Comment: Independent sources, however, reported on

visits by OSWALD to the Cuban as well as

Soviet Embassies in Mexico City between 29

September and 3. October 1963 and on his

(apparently overt) contact with a KGB officer

under Consular cover at the Soviet Embassy

there. NOSENKO originally said he knew

nothing of any such contact. In October 1966

he revised this to say that OSWALD did not

have contact with the KGB in Mexico City.

NOSENKO explained that he had been sitting in

the office of Seventh Department Chief, K.N.

DUBAS, when a cable arrived at Moscow Head-

quarters from the KGB Legal Residency in

Mexico.

The cable, which NOSENKO said he did

not personally see, reported that OSWALD had

visited the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City

requesting permission to return to the USSR

and that the cable specified that OSWALD had

dealt with Soviet Foreign Ministry personnel

only.

Post-Assassination Review of KGB FIle

NOSENKO next learned Of OSWALD's activities as a result

of President Kennedy's assassination.

President Kennedy was shot, NOSENKO was advised of this fact

in a telephone call. to his home from KGB Headquarters. A

short while later he wäs told, again by telephone, that the

President had died. About two hours later, NOSENKO was told

that OSWALD had been arrested, and he and the other officers

of the American Tourist Section were called in to determine

whether the KGB had any information concerning him. After

establishing OSWALD's identity from KGB files and learning

that his file was

still in Minsk, NOSENKO phoned the KGB

office in

Minsk on GRIBANOV's orders.

The local KGB dictated

over the telephone a summary of its file on OSWALD.

This

summary. concluded with the statement that the KGB in Minsk

had attempted "to influence OSWALD in the right direction"

GRIBANOV had been greatly disturbed about the local KGB's

efforts because it had been given specific instructions to

carry out nothing other than passive measures against OSWALD

there. He ordered that all records in Minsk pertaining to

OSWALD's stay there, as well as an explanation of the

meaning of the statement about influencing OSWALD, be flown

immediately to Moscow by military aircraft. NOSENKO personally

the explanation from Minsk concerning the meaning of

this statement and thoroughly reviewed OSWALD's file when

it arrived by plane. He then turned the file over to s.M.

FEDOSEYEV, the Chief of the American Department of the KGB

second Chief Directorate, who prepared a two-page summary

memorandum for GRIBANOV:

This memorandum, which NOSENKO

read, was forwarded to KGB Chairman SemichastnyY, and

Semichastnyy in turn reported to the CPSU Central Committee

and

to Khrushchev concerning it.

OSWALD'S file from Minsk contained no information to

indicate that the KGB in Minsk had taken any action with

respect to OSWALD contrary to instructions from KGB Head-

quarters.

From the date of OSWALD's arrival in the USSR

until his departure, the KGB had no personal contact with

him and had not attempted to utilize him in any manner.

OSWALD never received any KGB training or KGB assign-

ments.

If any other department of the KGB or the GRU had

wanted to use OSWALD in any way, it would have had to secure

permission from the Seventh Department, which originally

opened his case file.

In view of OStIALD's apparent mental

instability, no Soviet intelligence organization, particu-

larly not the Thirteenth (Assassination and Sabotage)

Department, would have considered using him.

KGB Head-

quarters did not maintain a control file on him following

his settlement in Minsk,

as it would have done had OSHALD

been of any operational interest.

The only KGB record on

OSALD maintained in Moscow was an index card giving his

name and the fact the Seventh Department had originated a

file concerning him.

The KGB maintained no separate file on Marina OS"ALD;

all information about her was kept in OSWALD's file.

There

was no indication in OSWALD's

file that the KGB had had any

interest in Marina either while she was in the Soviet Union

or after she left for the United States.

Comment:

NOSENKO later told CIA on one occasion that he

"only skimmed the file" and on another that he

had it in his possession about 20 minutes. In

October 1966 he again said that he read the

file and that while doing so he saw a picture

of OSWALD for the first time. NOSENKO added

that he never met OSWALD personally.

NOSENKO's assertion that the KGB First Chief

Directorate first learned of OSWALD when he

applied for a re-entry visa in Mexico City in

September 1963 is probably incorrect. The

consular file turned over to the U.S. Govern-

ment by the Soviet Embassy in Washington

after the assassination indicated that the KGB

First Chief Directorate would have known of

OSWALD as early

as February 1963 if not earlier.

That file contained Marina OSWALD's letter of

February 1963 and a letter of July 1963 from

OSTALD, both of

which indicated that OSwAld had

file, one of 9 November 1963, OSWALD advised

the Soviet Embassy in Washington of his travel

under alias to Mexico, his fruitless contact

with an official (whom CIA identifies as a

KGB officer) of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico

City, his contact there with the Cuban Consulate

and his efforts to reach Havana in order to

visit the Soviet Embassy there.

without regard

to possible earlier correspondence, OSWALD'S

request for a Soviet visa addressed

to the

Embassy in Washington in July 1963 would require

the Washington Residency to report the matter

to Moscow just as NOSENKO described the Mexico

City Residency later did. NOSENKO's apparent

ignorance of OSWALD's communications with the

Soviet Embassy in Washington discredits his

claim to complete knowledge of all aspects of

the KGB relationship with OSWALD•

The CHEREPANOV Papers

Comment:

On 4 November 1963 in Moscow, a MEZHKNIGA

employee claiming to be one CHEREPANOV, passed

to an American book-buyer a package which he

requested the American to deliver to a trust-

worthy person at the American Embassy.

Embassy

officials found the package to contain a

bundle of typed or handwritten documents which

appeared to have originated in classified KGB

files.

Fearing a Soviet provocation which

could lead to a denunciation of the Embassy

for possessing classified Soviet Government

documents, Embassy officials had the documents

photographed and on the next day: 5 November,

returned the originals to the Soviet Ministry

of Foreign Affairs.

At his first meeting with CIA in January 1964 NOSENKO

related how a disaffected former KGB colleague, A.N.

CHEREPANOV, had stolen documents from the American Embassy

Section and in November 1963 sent them through an inter-

mediary to the American Embassy. CHEREPANOV's treason was

discovered, NOSENKO said, when the Embassy returned the

documents to Soviet authorities. CHEREPANOV fled Moscow,

and NOSENKO claimed to have taken part in the KGB search

for him. NOSENKO brought with him to Geneva the official

KGB document which authorized his travel in the search for

The significance of the ClEREPANOV incident is twofold.

The KGB documents which CHEREPANOV allegedly sent to the

Embassy appear to have originated in the American Depart-

ment's Embassy Section, and the documents relate to KGB

modus operandi, personnel, targets, and technical devices

employed in operations during 1958-1960, during part of

which time NOSENKO claimed he was Deputy Chief of the

Embassy Section.

The KGB document, the "temporary duty

authorization", is an item of physical evidence

NOSENKO

has offered to substantiate his claim to personal parti-

cipation in

the CHEREPANOV case and to having held the rank

of KGB lieutenant colonel. [The document does not itself

refer to CHEREPANOV in any manner.J

NOSENKO'S Information

The KGB officer, A.N. CHEREPANOV was born about 1920 or

1921,

During World War II he was a KGB officer working

with partisan groups behind the lines. Later he was in

Yugoslavia for fourer tive years, and was probably Deputy

Chief of the KGB Legal Residency in Belgrade.

Comment:

CIA records contain references to an Aleksandr.

Nikolayevich CHEREPANOV, a Soviet diplomat and

suspected intelligence officer in Belgrade in

1953.

CHEREPANOV left Belgrade in 1956.

Yugoslav intelligence officer who defected in

1957 confirmed that CHEREPANOV had been an

intelligence officer.

When CHEREPANOV returned to Moscow, he had some (unspecified).

problem getting a job, but finally the KGB Second Chief

Directorate took him into the American Embassy Section of the

American Department, working against State Department

personnel in the Administrative Section of the Embassy.

He

worked in the same room as V.A. KUSKOV, and was case officer

for three KGB targets:

Richard SNYDER. and John MCVICKAR,

counsular officers, and Marion ALBAMONTH. secretary to thell

personnel officer.

CHEREPANOV's work as

a case officer was

poor, and

as it grew worse, the KGB decided to retire him.

Because of his service in World War II, for which he

received three years' pension credit for each year of military

service, he had enough time to his credit to be eligible for

retirement. Also, he was just over the minimum age (40) for

retirement from the KGB.

Upon retiring in July or August 1961, CHERFPANOV got a

job with MEZHKNIGA:

Unhappy about his enforced retirement

and angry at the KGB, he became even more dissatisfied when

MEZHKNIGA turned down his several attempts to go abroad.

Prior to leaving the KGB, CHEREPANOV had stolen draft

copies of documents he had handled in the

the concent to the an aolen

Embassy Section.

In one case, he copied the contents of a report in his own

handwriting, evidently having been unable to steal the

document itself. All of the documents he had stolen were

intended for destruction.

In November 1963 Yu. I. GUK brought NOSENKO news about

"a catastrophe" in the KGB:

GUK said he had the story from

B.D. MAKASHEV, a common friend of GUK and NOSENKO.

MAKASHEV

had been in Foreign Minister Andrey Gromyko's office when

the CHEREPANOV papers were brought there, after their delivery

by Thomas FAIN of the Embassy. MAKASHEV saw the name of

(Second Chief Directorate Chief) GRIBANOV on some of the

papers and saw that one of them was a plan for agent opera-

tions against an American. He noted that one of the documents

was at least an inch thick. Gromyko immediately called KGB

Chairman Semichastnzy, who notified GRIBANOV. GRIDANOV's

depüty. went to Gromyko's office and picked up the papers.

The KGB then began an investigation of all the personnel

assigned to the American Department during the time period

covered by the

papers, 1959 to 1960 or 1961.

When the American Embassy saw the CHEREPANOV documents,

they were afraid that the documents were part of a KGB

provocation, and they wondered what the Russians were

trying to do. The Embassy officials photographed the

te ambasse

documents and on the next day returned them to the Ministry

of Foreign Affairs.

When the Americans gave the documents

to the Ministry, the KGB wondered why the Americans gave

them back.

The whole matter was held very tightly in the KGB during

its investigation for 20 or 25 days.

When the KGB examined

the documents, some were found to be in CHEREPANOV's hand-

writing, but no documents were found which pertained to

CHEREPANOV's own case work, or that of the American Embassy

Section. The KGB found no

documents dated later than

1961--none for 1962 or 1963--only 1959, 1960 and 1961. Thus

there were a number of indications pointing towards

CHEREPANOV, who had left the section in 1961.

The KGB did

not dare alert him by putting full-time surveillance on him,

but instead mounted fixed surveillance posts at his home and

office. In order to provoke CHEREPANOV into some precipitous

action, a former KGB colleague was sent to visit him who, in

the course of conversation, mentioned the great disturbance

in the KGB caused by someone passing stolen KGB documents

to the Americans. CHEREPANOV manifested no reaction to the

news and was quite cool about the matter.

The next day the

surveillance post observed him leaving his house in the

morning at his usual time, apparently on his way to work,

but the surveillance post

at his office soon reported that

he had not arrived at work. He had "simply dropped out of

sight".

An intensive search "all over the city of Moscow" ensued,

then spread throughout the Soviet Union: Border controls

were tightened, photographs of CHEREPANOV were sent out to

Republic and local KGB and

militia offices, and all means

of transport were covered.

Reports

began

coming in

from

various places that someone who seemed to fit CHEREPANOV'S

description had been seen acting suspiciously here and there.

Reports which came into KGB Headquarters from Gorkiy Oblast

strongly indicated

the possibility of CHEREPANOV's presence

there,

SO NOSENKO was dispatched to the area to check.

NOSENKO wen't to Gorkiy on the fourth day after CHERE-

PANOV's disappearance.

The arca was covered with very deep

woods, "where a person could los himself for life": : On the

seventh day CHEREPANOV was located and

arrested in Baku,

where he was on his way to the Iranian border.

A special plane was immediately sent to Baku, carrying

S.M. FEDOSEYEV and several other American Department offi-

cers. They brought CHEREPANOV immediately lack to Moscow;

interrogating him on the plane.: He immediately confessed

to having given the documents to the Americans.

When asked

why, he said he was "angry at the KGh, very angry", ano

besides, he thought he might ask the Americans for some

money in return for the documents.

He confessed that on

4 November he had passed the documents to an American tourist

who was a librarian interested in Russian books:

He said he

had given the documents

to the American in the entrance

hallway in the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,

the building in which the Ministry of Foreign Trade was also

housed.

Because CHEREPANOV had eluded the KGB between the two

fixed surveillance posts which had been established, the

Second Chief Directorate suffered considerable criticism

for not putting CHEREPANOV under full, round-the-clock

surveillance., CHEREPANOV himself, however, told the KGB

that if he had detected his surveillants he would have

written to the government and newspapers a letter of protest

against "such an indignity, such persecution", and then

would have committed

suicide, leaving the KGB without proof

of his guilt.

Comment:

NOSENKO's assertions with respect to the

CHEREPANOV case, however, are not material to

his claim that he was Deputy Chief of the

Seventh Department at the time.

Contents of the CHERFPANOV Package

The KGB documents in the CHEREPANOV package

totalled

103 pages in the original Russian version, divided almost

equally between typewritten reports in final form and hand-

written draft reports or notes, plus two copies of letters

written by Soviet citizens to the American Embassy. The

longest single document was a 33-page Top Secret report,

dated 18 April 1959, entitled "Operational Conditions in

the U.S.A. and the Activities of American Counterintelligence

Organs against Soviet Installations and Soviet Citizens in

the U.S.A. in 1957-1958"

The report was signed by Colonel

A. FEKLISOV, lalias FOMIN, the former KGB rezident in

Washington] whose title is given as

"Chief, First (American]

Department, First Chief Directorate".

The rest of the

documents refer to KGB coverage of various American Embassy

and American diplomats in Moscow during the period August

1958 to 15 October 1960. Most of the documents were prepared

by or for one senior case officer of the Embassy Section,

First Department, Second Chief Directorate, Major V. KUSKOV.

(NOSENKO has identified V.A. KUSKOV as an officer of the

Second Chief Directorate who shared an office with CHEREPANOV

from about 1958 to 1961.)

Two reports were on Americans who

had left the Soviet Union, Edward I. KILLHAM, Second Secretary

from July 1957 to July 1959, and Wallace L. LITTELL, Attache

There were operational plans

for agent work against four American diplomats once stationed

in MoscoW,

Richara HARMSTONE, Lewis W. BOWDEN, James A.

RAMSEY, and George WINTERS.

Other documents included were

an agent's report of her relationship with MINTERS, a summary

of LANGELLE's activities while in the USSR, a list of Soviet

citizens whose letters to the Embassy had been intercepted

by the KGB, a handwritten summary

(signed by CHEREPANOV). of

a Soviet youth who had been in

The operational plan on WINTERS,

as an example, indicated

that WINTERS had already been identified as an intelligence

officer, and to ascertain the nature of his intelligence

activities, the KGB was to employ round-the-clock surveil-

lance, technical aids metka and "NEPTUNE-80", audio surveil-

lance, and investigation of his contacts among Soviet.

citizens.

The plan reflected that while the KGB judgment

was that WINTERS

"had a hostile attitude toward the USSR"

and that there

"was no basis for recruitment"

i care should

be taken not to alarm him and cause him to leave the country

prematurely, since there still might arise an opportunity

to attempt to recruit him.

NOSENKO said that he had never seen the documents

CHEREPANOV passed to the Embassy, although he was familiar

with their substance.

Comment:

The information in the CHEREPANOV Papers was

substantially consistent with what NOSENKO had

said earlier in 1962 regarding WINTERS, LANGELLE,

HARMSTONE and Embassy Section operational

techniques such as the use of metka.

NOSENKO's Travel Document

When NOSENKO first related to CIA in Geneva in 1964'

his knowledge of the CHEREPANOV case, he produced a document

(see accompanying exhibit) which he said was his official

KGB "temporary duty authorization" to go to Gorkiy Oblast

to

search for CHEREPANOV. The document, signed by General

GRIBANOV,

authorized Lieutenant Colonel NOSENKO to travel to

Gorkiy during the period immediately before NÖSENKO's trip

to Geneva, 15-30 December 1963. NOSENKO acknowledged that

it was

"illegal" to have

kept the document and to have

brought it with him from

the Soviet Union. He did it,

he

said, to show CIA.

(SEVENTH DEPARTIENT. - January 1962-January 1964)

Comment:

NOSENKO has never provided a satisfactory

explanation for his retention of the document

nor for bringing it to Geneva.

According to

an earlier KGB defector, the bearer of a

temporary duty authorization is held strictly

accountable for the document which has to be

turned in with the financial voucher.

What-

ever NOSENKO's purpose, the effect of presenting

the document to CIA was to corroborate his

statements about CHEREPANOV and substantiate

his claim that he was a KGB lieutenant colonel.

NOSENKO was not a lieutenant colonel (see p.350) •

When he eventually said in 1966 that he was

only a captain, NOSENKO was challenged to

explain how he came to possess an official KGB

document signed by General GRIBANOV and

identifying him as a lieutenant colonel.

NOSENKO asserted that it came about "by

mistake".

Return to Geneva (January-February 1964)

NOSENKO was detailed a second time to perform security

escort duties with the Soviet delegation to the Disarmament

Conference, and he returned to Geneva in January 1964 where

he resumed contact with CIA and announced his intention to

defect.

He brought with him a considerable number of hand-

written notes to which he referred when describing to CIA

officers KGB. operations of which he claimed he learned at

KGB Headquarters during 1962 and 1963. His delegation

He visited the Geneva

Legal Residency daily and met with CIA almost as frequently

while awaiting approval of his defection and exfiltration

from Switzerland, tentatively scheduled for some three

weeks later. A little more than a week after his arrival!

however, NOSENKO declared that he had to defect at once,

because he had received cabled instructions to return to the

USSR immediately. On 4 February 1964 NOSENKO was

purpose of Geneva Trip

NOSENKO explained that it was his personal wish that

had brought him to' Geneva, that he was allowed to travel as

"a treat"

when it appeared to be the last occasion he might

have to travel to the West.

[NOSEIKO said in 1962 that when

he became Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department, as he

expected to become, he would travel to the west every two

or three years.]

He had discussed the possibility of the

trip in 1963 with then-Seventh Department Chief CHELNOKOV,

and secured his agreement.

He also talked with officers

of the Soviet Delegations Department, but after it had been

decided that he should go, the Chief of that Department,

IN.T.I ZHARIKOV, suggested that it might be unnecessary

for

a security officer to accompany this particular delegation.

[A.G.] KOVALENKO,

the new Chief of the Seventh Department,

supported NOSENKO's assignment as a personal favor. 'Although

at one time NOSENKO said that GRIBANOV approved the trip, he

has later asserted that GRIBANOV was. not involved and that

if GRIBANOV had learned of NOSENKO's plans, he would: not

have permitted NOSENKO to go.

NOSENKO's only mission was to concern himself with the

general security of the delegation, as he had done in 1962.

He had no specific tasks such as on his earlier assignment

(e.g., investigating SAKIDY or supervising the BELITSKIY

operation):

Comment: NOSENKO has never satisfactorily explained why

a Deputy Chief of the

Seventh Department would

draw an unrelated assignment abroad which

would last many weeks if not months.

another context, NOSENKO had described

a KGB

conference to take place about this time where

plans were to be drawn up

for KGB operations

during the coming tourist

season: he acknow-

ledged that he was expected to attend, but

nevertheless went to Geneva.

Visits to Legal Residency

As in 1962, NOSENKO said he visited the Legal Resi-

dency daily.

According to strict rules, he explained, an

officer in his status

[temporary duty assignment which was

independent of Residency] should not do so, but his case

was exceptional because he was a Deputy Chief of Department

and because of the relationship he established in 1962

through the intervention of M.s. TSYMBAL.

Illegals Direct-

orate Chief ISYMBAL, NOSENKO related in 1964, was an old

friend; they had become acquainted in Moscow before meeting

again in Geneva in 1962, when they dined together frequently.

TSYMBAL's wife once had

taught NOSENKO in school, and

TSYMBAL had once offered NOSENKO a job in the Illegals

Directorate. NOSENKO asserted that TSYMBAL's introduction

of NOSENKO to Rezident GAVRICHEV in 1962 permitted NOSENKO

to frequent the Legal Residency in 1964.

Comment: In 1962 NOSENKO attributed his access to the

Residency to his "old friend Yuri GUK", not

TSYMBAL, He mentioned TSYMBAL's presence in

Geneva but claimed no close acquaintance.

Availability for Meetings with CIA

In 1964 NOSENKO behaved as if he had no official

responsibilities or any

demands on his time, and he was

willing to spend all of his time in meetings with CIA.. He

said that his absence from the Disarmament Delegation could

be explained as "security duties" since everyone on the

Delegation knew or suspected that he was a KGB officer.

From

the first meeting on 24 January until 4 February,

NSOENKO met CIA officers thirteen times for meetings usually

lasting for five or six hours. By mutual agreement, most

of the meetings started in the afternoon.

On two occasions

NOSENKO arrived as early as 0930 hours and several meetings

continued until past midnight.

NOSENKO's Written Notes

After returning to KGB Headquarters from Geneva in

1962, NOSENKO said, he had availed himself of various

opportunities to record what he learned of KGB operations

in order to inform CIA, and to pilfer appropriate KGB

documents to which he had access, when he could safely do

He brought to Geneva in 1964 three KGB documents and

a large number of handwritten notes. The latter reflected

items which he had. excerpted from various documents to which

he had access, principally the Seventh Department Chief's

special file containing periodic summaries of all Seventh

Department operations.. He last had access to this special

file, he stated; in connection with his review of it in

December 1963 to confirm that it was intact after the

CHEREPANOV affair. While the file contained no true names,

he claimed he learned such true identities as were contained

in his notes by asking KGB colleagues.

For safekeeping,

NOSENKO said he kept

the notes and documents in a wall safe

of the office which he occupied alone, as Deputy Chief of

the Department.

Questioned

repeatedly about the KGB operations referred

to in his notes, NOSENKO in many instances could not expand

on what he had written:

He insisted he had written everything

he could discover, and knew no more.

Comment:

NOSENKO's sourcing for the notes does not

explain how he learned of the cases described

the notes dating from 1957-1959, a period

not covered by the documents NOSENKO Claimed he

reviewed. Neither can NOSENKO explain why he

was not knowledgeable, without the notes, of

operations which occurred while he was Deputy

Chief of the Seventh Department's American-

British Commonwealth Section. NOSENKO acknow-

ledges that his access to a personal safe in

which to keep the notes was just: fortuitous,

since neither all offices had such safes, nor

even all offices of Deputy Chiefs.

NOSENKO's Defection

On arrival for his first meeting with CIA during the

second Geneva phase, on 24 January 1964, NOSENKO said that

after long and careful consideration since the 1962 meeting

series, he had decided to defect.

He explained that he had

recently been promoted to the position of First Deputy Chief

of the Seventh Department, and that because of the stature

and responsibilities of his new job, there would be few if

any opportunities for him to visit the lest in the future.

Therefore, he had decided to seize the opportunity at hand

and to flee to the United States at once, leaving his family.

behind. He foresaw no possibility of his wife and children

being permitted leen tease made eat ento part

with my family".. He had, however, carefully considered their

fate as the close relatives of a defector, and he felt that,

because of his mother's position in Soviet society, no harm

would come to them.

NOSENKO was told that CIA accepted in principle his

decision to defect. NOSENKO felt that it would be best for

him to disappear from Geneva without a trace, leaving all

his personal possessions behind; he assumed that CIA would

exfiltrate him from Switzerland to the United States.

wanted to carry out this plan as soon as possible, but the

CIA officers encouraged him--and NÖSENKO agreed--to remain

in place for at least three weeks more. The reasons given

NOSENKO for this request were:

-The desire to obtain further information on the

local KGB Legal Residency and the Soviet delegation to

the Disarmament Conference while he still had

access;

320

Top Secret

TS No. 197124

## Page 332

Top Secret

(SEVENTH DEPARTMENT - January 1962-January 1964)

-The value of having NOSENKO present when GRIBANOV.:

made a visit to Geneva about 7 February, a visit known

to CIA only through NOSENKO;

-The potential value to be derived from NOSENKO's

in-place spotting of CIA recruitment targets among

the

Soviet representation in Geneva;

-The necessity of making arrangements,

acceptable to

NOSENKO, for his defection and resettlement.

In a three-and-a-half hour meeting on 26 January

NOSENKO emphasized that although he agreed that it was

necessary and useful for him to remain in place until

GRIBANOV visited Geneva, he wanted to defect as soon as

possible thereafter.

On 28 January NOSENKO reported that GRIBANOV might not

be coming to Geneva after all, for KGB Chairman SemichastnyY

was apparently reluctant to permit him to travel beyond

Vienna.'

NOSENKO said that he would probably have definite

information on GRIBANOV's trip by the end of the week.

On 30 January NOSENKO said that there appeared to be

little likelihood that GRIBANOV would visit Geneva or Paris.

[From 7 to 10 February 1964 GRIBANOV was in Paris, where he

was seen on the street with a Soviet identified by NOSENKO

as a KGB counterintelligence officer.] Therefore, he wanted

to defect right away.

He cited as reasons the emotional

strain of any further delay and the fact that he and his

case officers were wasting their time working against the

local KGB Legal Residency, which had no worthwhile or

promising targets. He also felt that nothing of value could

be obtained from the Soviet delegation because "Tsarapkin

himself doesn't know what he will say until he is told by

Moscow the day before" CIA handlers, however, delayed the:

defection for one week by obtaining NOSENKO's agreement

to assist

in an audio operation: CIA proposed to install

listening

devices in the offices of the KGB Legal Residency,

and NOSENKO said he would check certain physical aspects

of the delegation buildings.

As the best time for the

defection, he suggested Saturday morning,

He also asked about exfiltration plans.

On 31 January NOSENKO reported the results of his

reconnaissance of the KGB Legal Residency in connection with

the proposed audio operation, which would involve microphone

transmitters operating on a carrier current. He told CIA he

had accidentally overheard in the Residency that the building

used its own batteries and generator, and therefore the

On 3 February NOSENKO reviewed the CHERFPANOV materials.

The defection was still scheduled for

Saturday, & February.

NOSENKO telephoned the Geneva safehouse from his hotel

to come now and not go back." After arriving at the CIA

safehouse he explained that when he dropped by the KGB Legal

Residency following the morning session of the Disarmament

conference, he read a cavle ordering him to return to Moscow

immediately to prepare for a KGB conference on foreian tourism

in the Soviet Union.

The residency was arranging for a

ticket for NOSENKO to fly to Moscow via Paris the following

day and a replacement was being readied to assume NOSENKO'S

duties as security officer for the Soviet delegation in

Geneva.

Before he had left for Geneva in January, NOSENKO

agreed to open a number of new cities and tourist itineraries

in this connection.

Semichastnyy had decided that it was

time to call a conference to discuss new

"tactics and

stra-

tegies" for handling the increased number of tourists

expected. Since IOSENKO had been placed in charge of the

entire conference, he was directed to leave at once to

prepare a basic report on the KGB handling of tourists;

the

report would be read to the conference either by himself of

by someone from the leadership of the KGB or the Second Chief

Directorate.

NOSENKO explained that he was the only one

who could do this job as

It: Col. A.G. KOVALENKO, the KGB

Headquarters Department senior officer, was a relatively new

man in this line of operations, having been there only four

or five years, perhaps less. NOSENKO also told CIA that "by

great coincidence" he had learned, just before the cable

arrived, he was being moved to the Soviet villa on the

morning

of 5 February.

He had arranged for a Soviet chauf-

feur to

bring a car

around at 0930 hours the next morning

for the move.

His absence would be noted at that time, and

therefore

"the main thing is to cross the swiss border

before

morning": NOSENKO felt, however, that there would

be considerable confusion among the Soviets in Geneva for

a time following his disappearance, and that there would be

no real concern until the evening.

To foster Soviet

uncertainty, he had left his clothing lying around his hotel

roon and had brought no personal effects to the CIA safe-

house

MOSENKO estimated the first soviet queries to swiss

authorities would probably be made late on 5 February or

early on the oth.

NOSENKO was driven to Frankfurt the night of 4 February

ana remained in a safehouse there until ll February,

when

press publicity about the defection and Soviet demands for

an immediate interview with NOSENKO dictated that he be

wrought to washington as soon as possible. He arrived in

the United States on the evening of 12 Feuruary 1964.

with respect to NOSENKO's own description of Seventh Depart-

significant KGB operations against American tourists.

Information Furnished the KGB by George BLAKE

The KGB agent' in MI-6, George BLAKE, in 1959 furnished

the KGB with a documentary account of the joint CIA-MI-6

meeting in June of that year, (see p.148) and he was to

furnish other information by which the KGB could keep

sar held in at noon.

current on such hostile operations. Another CIA-MI-6 meeting

was held in Hashington in April 1960, of which a twenty-one

page summary was made.

BLAKE also passed this document as

soon as it came into his possession to the KGB.

KGB Study of American Intelligence Tourist Operations

The lengthy 1961 KGB Top Secret study referred to earlier

(see p.14)) reflects the detailed and accurate information

in possession of the KGB during the period of NOSENKO's

alleged service in the Seventh Department in 1962-1963.

Pertinent portions are quoted as follows:

"It has been established that the Intelligence

organs of the. USA are displaying special activity

in the utilization of legal channels, specifically,

in tourism, for the purpose of conducting subversive

work against the USSR.

Numerous facts indicate that

American tourists and members of various US delega-

tions, in the USSR strive to visit areas and instal-

lations to which employees of the Embassy and mili-

tary attaches have no access, establish oontact with

Soviet citizens, and collect intelligence informa-

tion.

In this regard, the channels of tourism to

the USSR are used

to dispatch experienced intelligence

to develop individual Soviet citizens with

the objective of their eventual recruitment. In

line with the preparation and dispatch of such

the tourists the Americans also make

of persons not directly connected

with American Intelligence organs.

These latter

agents are given one-time assignments such as

collecting information leading to the ideological

development of Soviet citizens.

The 'Center' officially

it instructs regarding their conduct in the Soviet

NOSENKO's Information

NOSENKO insisted that the operations he described accurate-

ly reflected the extent of KGB counterintelligence operations

among American tourists during his 1962-1963 service in the

Seventh Department:

In response to questions during his in-

terrogation, NOSENKO asserted that the Seventh Department, :

during his absence in 1960-1961, had only noted that "automo-

bile tourism had increased and that American Intelligence had

increased its use of multi-national tourist groups."

He stated

that the Seventh Department received no information during

1960-1961 regarding American Intelligence use of tourism as

cover for espionage,

He was aware, he said, from the damage

survey conducted in the KGB after GOLITSYN's defection, that

American Intelligence had obtained a KGB document on tourist

operations, a document

which had been written in the Seventh

Department.

Comment:

NOSENKO does not know the content of the docu-

ment, which he describes as a statistical sur-

vey similar to the study he himself drafted in

1959 (see p. 146):

KGB Counterintelligence Operations

Among American Tourists: Summary

BLAKE's confession and evidence obtained from internal

KGB documents establish the KGB concern for the threat of

American tourist agent operations and the scope of KGB

actions to thwart that threat. The effect of NOSENKO's

statements is that the KGB did not know of the American

tourist agent program. He averred that the operations he

described accurately depicted the nature of KGB counter-

intelligence operations during the period.

SEVENTH DEPARTMENT - 1962-1964: Summary and Conclusion

According to NOSENKO, in January 1962, at the direction of

General GRIBANOV, he was appointed Chief

of the Seventh De-

partment American-British Commonwealth Section in the expec-

tancy that he soon would be named a Deputy Chief of the Seventh

Departnent. As a Section Chief, he personally handled agents

and supervised all Second Chief Directorate operations against

American and British Commonwealth tourists, of which he de-

scribes four. In this period NOSENKO also

unrelated duty of serving as a security escort officer with a

Soviet delegation travelling to Geneva in which capacity he in-

vestigated a delegate of suspected loyalty, SHAKHOV. While in

Geneva he drew also the assignment of supervising another KGB

case officer's management of the KGB double agent, BELITSKIY.

of three Deputy Chiefs of the entire Seventh Department; in

this position he learned of all KGB operations against Ameri-

can tourists.

In this connection he described five operations,

as well as his accidental discovery of the identity of an

American GRU agent, and tie investigation and search for a

disaffected former

KGB colleague. In July 1963 NOSENKO states

he became First Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department.

Again assigned to escort a delegation to Geneva in January

1964, NOSENKO met CIA representatives again and delivered

notes of KGB operations of

which he had learned since his

last meeting with CIA in 1962. He also presented at this

time a KGB travel document to substantiate his clained rank

of lieutenant colonel. Finally, he announced the receipt of

a telegram recalling nim to Moscow, an event which prompted

CIA to accept his immediate defection.

NOSENKO's claimed date of transfer into the Seventh De-

partment is in dispute because of contradictory claims he made

regarding his Embassy Section activities. He provides no in-

formation sustaining his claim to have become Chief of the

American-British Commonwealth Section; his description of

his functions does not differ materially from that given in

connection with his earlier claimed service in the same sec-

tion, as a case officer, and he describes no administrative

nor supervisory responsibilities. None of his claimed agents,

with one exception, was employed in Seventh Department opera-

tions he described.

Because. of contradictions and the con-

flicts in his varying accounts, neither of the reasons

NOSENKO cites for his assignment to Geneva in 1962 or 1964

is credible. In Geneva, it is implausible that he conducted

the investigation of SHAKHOV as he claims, and he clearly:

did not supervise the management of the double

agent, BELIT-

SKIY.

NOSENKO offers nine "tourist" cases as evidence that he

served in the 1962-1964 period in the Seventh Department, part

of the time as Deputy Chief. These cases, which included two

religious figures, two American Communists, one emigre, one

suspected FBI agent, a First Chief Directorate target who in-

tended to marry a Soviet citizen, a hostage, and a permanent:

resident or former permanent resident of

the Soviet Union, all

have aspects for which KGB elements other than the Seventh

Department may have been

responsible. This fact and the

anomalies of NOSENKO's accounts of the cases aside, however,

the cases are evidence that NOSENKO did serve during the :

period in the Seventh Department, although they are not per-

suasive of his claim to have been Deputy Chief.

aspects of his statements, including those relating to his

supervisory duties and to the nature of Second Chief Direc-

torate operations against American and other foreign tourists.

NOSENKO has retracted his assertion that he was a lieuten-

ant colonel, a rank appropriate for a Second Chief Directorate

Deputy Chief of department, and asserts that he was never

promoted beyond the rank of captain.

Most damaging to NOSENKO's claims that he was a supervisor

in the Seventh Department is his assertion that he accurately

describes KGB counterintelligence operations against foreign,

particularly American, tourists.

A senior Seventi Department

officer would be aware of the Second Chief Directorate's pre-

occupation with American tourists: If NOSENKO is unaware of

the extent of KGB activities in connection with American

tourists, he was not a Section Chief of Deputy Chief of the

Seventh Department.

NOSENKO's claims, that in 1962 he was Chief of the

American-British Commonwealth Section and was thereafter a

Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department, are not credible.

CHAPTER IX

OTHER ASPECTS OF NOSE!IKO'S KGB SERVICE

Most of NOSENKO's assertions can be examined in a chrono-

logical fashion, as has been done in the proceding sections.

Some can most easily be examined separately, since they

relate not to any particular period of his KGB service nor

to any specific position he claimed he occupied, but to his

entire KGB career.

The principal aspects in this category

of claims are those he made about his relationship with

Second Chief Directorate General GRIBANOV, his Party status,

his knowledge of certain KGB forms and procedures, his

sourcing of KGB operations, awards he earned for KGB service,

and his KGB rank.

Relationship with General GRIBANOV

From his first meeting with CIA in 1962, NOSENKO main-

tained that he had a close personal and professional rela-

tionship with Major General GRIBANOV, Chief of the Second

Chief Directorate.

NOSENKO described recruitment approaches

in which he and GRIBANOV took part together, conversations

they had

on operational matters, the role which GRIBANOV

played in his promotions, awards and assignments, and their

after hours carrousing.

According to NOSENKO, GRIBAITOV was

wholly responsible, against NOSINKO's wishes, for his

appointment to the

position of Deputy Chief of the American

Department Emuassy

Section in 1960, and when NOSENKO later

rejected GRIBANOV's offer to make him Chief of the entire

American Department, it was GRIBANOV who arranged his return

to the Seventh Department as Chief of the American-British

Commonwealth Section and who shortly thereafter appointed

him a Deputy Chief and thereafter First Deputy Chief of the

Seventh Department.

NOSENKO'S Information - Post 1964

Immediately following his defection NOSENKO continued to

refer to this special and personal relationship, which

touched on nearly every aspect of NOSENKO'S KGB service.

Under interrogation, however, NOSENKO could not sustain

this claim. The extent NOSENKO's statements were retracted

or contradicted with respect to GRIBANOV or contradicted by

other evidence, is seen

from the following examples excerpted

from the earlier chronological examination:

GRIBANOV wrote

the very best fitness report on NOSENKO that could be given

(Retracted.

GRIBANOV wrote none of NOSENKO's fitness

reports) ; NOSENKO and GRIBANOV carroused together with women

provided

by NOSENKO

(Retracted. NOSENKO recalled only two

occasions, and could relate only one in any detail.);

recruited

Edward SMITH (see p. 37) together with NOSENKO

(Retracted. NOSENKO played no active role in SMITH recruit-

ment attempt and was not in Embassy Section at time.);

NOSENKO accompanied GRIBANOV to diplomatic receptions in

GRIBANOV on only one such occasion and learned from "friends"

in 1958-1959 about DeJean) ; GRIBANOV put NOSENKO in Embassy

Section in 1960 as Deputy Chief to supervise code clerk

operations (Contradicted. NOSENKO was not Deputy Chief and

did not

supervise code clerk operations); GRIBANOV approved

NOSENKO's operational plan for MORONE's recruitment (Retracted.06

The plan was written by another KGB ófficer.) ; GRIBANOV

ordered NOSENKO to prepare study on foreign intelligence

services use of tourism (Contradicted. NOSENKO could recall

no details of the study nor whether he ever discussed it

with GRIBANOV.) ¡ GRIBANOV promised to promote NOSENKO directly

to lieutenant colonel from the rank of captain and (subse-

quently) personally congratulated him on his promotion to

lieutenant colonel (Retracted.

NOSENKO never was promoted

past the rank of captain.); GRIBANOV was instrumental in

NOSENKO's receiving personal commendations from the KGB

Chairman, the

Orders of the Red Banner, the Red Star, and

the Order of Lenin (Retracted.

NOSENKO received no such

awards.); GRIBANOV ordered NOSENKO: to Geneva in 1962

(Retiacted. NOSENIO went at the request of the Soviet

Delegations Abroad Department.); GRIBANOV ordered NOSENKO

to assume charge of the BELITSKIY case (Contradicted.

NOSENKO did not supervise the BELITSKIY case.) ; GRIBANOV

allowed NOSENKO to go to Geneva in 1964, "as a personal

favor" (Retracted. GRIBANOV was not aware that NOSENKO

was to return to Geneva a second time.): and finally.

GRIBANOV was NOSENKO's patron (Retracted. Their relation-

ship was no closer than

their relative rank and position

indicated.)

Conclusion

NOSENKO's contradictions and retractions with respect to

his claimed relationship with GRIBANOV discredit his single

and most important unretracted claim, that NOSENKO, on

GRIBANOV's appointment was Deputy Chief of the Seventh

Department.

Communist Party Status

In addition to other stringent requirements, candidates

for the KGB must normally be Communist Party or Komsomol

members.

The significance of NOSENKO's statements about

his Party status is the extent to which they are consistent

with what is known about Party activity in the KGR, and

consistent with NOSENKO's account of his KGB career.

NOSENKO said his formal participation in Communist Party

activities began in late 1943 or early 1944 when he joined

the Komsomol at the Naval Preparatory in Baku. The step

was a casual one, he said, and he took it without much

thought, mainly because all of his friends were joining.

He continued his pro forma membership in the Komsomol while

in the Naval RU; and when he "transferred"

to the KGB in

spring 1953, he transferred routinely to the KGB Komsomol

organization from his Naval RU Komsomol unit in the Baltic.

He was registered with the KGB Komsomol, he said, without

referring the matter to his former Baltic Komsomol

unit.

Comment:

According to knowledgeable KGB defectors,

member's acceptance in another Komsomol unit

is contingent upon the endorsement of the

individual's former unit; NOSENKO's acceptance

by the KGB Komsomol without referring the

matter to his Komsomol unit in the Baltic "is

impossible"

In the fall of 1953 NOSENKO claims he was elected

secretary of the Second Chief Directorate Komsomol organi-

zation:

He was elected, he said, at a meeting of the

Komsomol membership.

Comment: The Komsomol membership elects only the

Komsomol Committee.

The latter elects

the

secretary.

NOSENKO cannot describe the duties of a Komsomol secre-

tary in any specific manner. He does not know who was the

secretary of the KGB Komsomol organization, nor could he

describe his dealings with that official's office.

Comment:

The secretary of the Second Chief Directorate

Komsomol organization is directly subordinate

to the KGB Komsomol secretary and would have

occasion to deal with the latter frequently.

NOSENKO stated that he did not know whether there was

Komsomol Congress while he was Komsomol secretary of the

Second Chief Directorate, but that the Congresses were

ordinarily held yearly.

Comment:

The first Komsomol Congress since 1948 was

held in March 1954, entailing considerable

work by every Komsomol member and especially

by the unit secretaries.

As Komsomol secretary, NOSENKO collected the dues of the

members of his unit:

All members paid in the amount of two

percent of their monthlÿ salaries.

NOSENKO insisted that in 1953-1954 the maximum age for a

Komsomol member was 26 years of age, and that he was a

member until he became overage in October 1954, and that no

special privilege was extended to him.

Comment:

According to Komsomol statutes at the time,

the maximum age was twenty-five, a fact which

would be known by a person who served as a

Komsomol

secretary at the time.

NOSENKO would

have thus been excluded from the Komsomol when

he became overage in 1953, not in 1954 as

he

claimed.

The March 1954 Komsomol Congress retained

the 25 year age limit, but provided for two-

year extensions in certain cases. Because of

age at the time, and because of his claimed

position

as. Komsomol secretary: the matter

would have been of vital interest to NOSENKO

if the facts he related were true.

From the time he was dropped from the Komsomol because

of age, until he was accepted as a candidate member of the

Communist Party in January 1956, NOSENKO claimed that he

was the only officer in the KGB who was a member of neither

organization:

Comment: NOSENKO is the only soviet official known to

CIA who claims to have occupied a position of

trust and who claims he was not a Party member

at the time..

In the period following, "to show his eagerness" ánd "to

improve himself", NOSENKO asked for Party assignments.

For

more than a year he ran errands and collected newspapers and

performed other such tasks.

He stated that he applied for

Party membership in January 1956, was accepted as a candidate

member in 1956, and that he was

Conclusion

NOSENKO's claims about his Party activity do not sustain

his claims to KGB service, and they suffer from identical.

discrepancies with respect to chronology, plausibility,

and contradiction by independent sources.

It is concluded

that NOSENKO was never a Komsomol secretary and, if a member

at all;

was no longer a member after reaching his

birthday in October 1953.

Knowledge Of Certain KGB Forms and Procedures

In the course of his various interrogations, NOSENKO had

occasion to comment generally on various KGB forms and

procedures.

Interrogation on these points, however, developed

that while he was generally familiar with various aspects

unexpectedly there were some of which he was ignorant.. Some

of these topics are described on page

in connection with

his KGB entry, and others which are described below.

KGB Forms

NOSENKO was familiar with the anketa, the KGB Personal

History: Statement, including its appearance, the nature

of

the questions included, and the purpose of the document.

However, he maintained

that it was reguired to be completed

in two copies, that it could be completed outside of KGB

premises, and

that it consisted of four to six pages.

Comment:

The anketa is a detailed, sixteen page question-

naire.

As a sensitive document, it is not taken

from KGB premises.

Defectors'

describe its

completion as

"an experience not soon to be

forgotten".

If NOSENKO was a supervisor as he

claimed, he would recall the form from reviewing

personnel files in which the anketa is a.

prominent basic document.

NOSENKO maintained that he had never heard of the Communist

Party Questionnaire, (Lichny Listok po Uchetu Kadrov) • Shown

an exemplar, NOSENKO

stated that he had seen it in personnel

files, but had never himself filled one out.

Asked in whose

personnel files he had seen the document, NOSENKO first said

those of civilians: (interpreters, etc), and finally expressed

his belief that the KGB did not use the document.

Comment: The form is completed by every KG officer, and

while it is not of critical importance to the

KGB itself, a copy is filed in every officer's

personnel file, a fact known to any Komsomol

secretary or supervisor responsible for reviewing

KGB personnel files.

NOSENKO was unfamiliar with the name of the KGB personnel

action form, and said he did not know of it. When its purpose

was described to him, he gave a superficial description of

its content.

Comment: A senior KGB officer would be familiar with the

form, which he would see on every occasion in

which one of his subordinates was promoted or

transferred.

NOSENKO was familiar with the Employment and Service

Record (Posluzhnoy Spisok), but he claimed he filled it out

only in "1958 or 1957".

Visitor's Pass Procedures

NOSENKO has described procedures entailed in a non-KGB

visitor's gaining access to a KGB installation, but he

maintained that the interviewer's name did not appear on, the

visitor's pass.

(See p. 70.).

Comment:

The interviewer's name does appear on the pass!

a fact which a

senior officer of more than a

decade's KGB Headquarters service would recall,

since he would have frequent occasion

to admit

visitors to KGB buildings.

Name Checks of KGB Central Files

NOSENKO on many occasions claimed that in connection with

his direction

of an operation he personally performed the

check of the targct's name against KGB files. Prominent

among these cases were BURGI] (see p.115). and ABIDIAN (p•205):

Comment:

NOSENKO could not describe specifically how he

performed the name checks he claimed, and his

description contained numerous errors of fact.

Among these were assertions that the Militia

retained court records of all Soviet citizens,

and that the First Special Department holds its

criminal index

separate from political and

security card indices.

NOSENKO was unfamiliar

with the KGB term spetsproverka, meaning a

clearance check.:

he performed name checks of American Embassy

personnel, he pleaded ignorance of any aspect

Conclusion

Awards and Decorations

Since 1964 NOSENKO has claimed to have received various

awards, commendations, and decorations for his KGR service.

His

assertions are material to any judgment of his general

credibility and, as

are mate:

well of the validity of his claims to

having occupied various KGB positions.

In January 1964 NOSINKO mentioned that in 1962, shortly

after meeting with CIA in Geneva, he received the Order of

Lenin for ideas which he developed to "enlarge the experience

and improve the quality" of Second Chief Directorate per-

sonnel in Moscow.

In the April 1964 interrogations NOSENKO was asked about

his awards, and he first said he received the Order of the

Red Banner, then corrected himself to say he received

first

the Order of the

Red Star.

He confirmed that he received

the Order of Lenin, in 1963.

[Earlier he had said 1962,

"just following visiting Geneva"

•] He claimed he received

the Order of Lenin for his performance in his Seventh

Department assignment, but when he was

asked what recruit-

ments justified his receipt of the award, he said the main

task of the Seventh Department was not to make recruitments,

but to counter the hostile intelligence service operations.

[For his contradictory statements regarding the Seventh

Department's mission, see pages 103 and 326 .] The Order

of Lenin was the highest decoration for which a KGB officer

is eligible, NOSENKO said, and besides himself, the Chief

and former Chief of the Seventh Department received it.

NOSENKO said he received in 1962 the Order of the Red Star,

he "thought" for his service in the Embassy Section in 1960-

1961, not for Seventh Department service; no explanation

accompanied that decoration.

(OTIIER ASPECTS OF NOSENKO'S KGB CAREER)

The question of NOSENKO's awards, orders and decorations

were of some interest to the interrogators since they might

reflect the importance the KGB attached to particular

operational activities in which NOSENKO engaged.

However,

before the April 1964 interrogations were suspended, NOSENKO

retracted his claim. that he received the Order of Lenin,

saying that it was just an idle boast. GRIBANOV; NOSENKO

explained, had promised in 1963 that NOSENKO, CHELNOKOV,

and KOVALENKO would receive the. Order of Lenin "for creating

the Central Operational Communications System of the Second

Chief Directorate" within the Seventh Department, but the

award had not materialized before NOSENKO left for Geneva in

January 1964.

Comment:

Earlier NOSENKO claimed he received the Order

for ideas he developed "to enlarge the experi-

ence and improve the quality of Second Chiéf:

Directorate personnel". Questioned, NOSENKO

reverted to the earlier claim.

In the April 1964 interrogations NOSENKO was asked

to

list the dates, reasons, and types of awards, decorations,

and bonuses he had received in his KGB career.

He replied

that he received nothing from 1953 until 1956, when he

received a commendation and one month's pay for the recruit-

06

ment of BURGI [see p.115l by order of the KGB Chairman Serov •

GRIBANOV informed him of the commendation, NOSENKO said, and

NOSENKO saw his name on the list of recipients which was

circulated. No written certificate accompanied the commen-

dation, according to NOSENKO, but personnel recorded the

event in each KGB recipient's personnel file. Almost every

year after 1956, NOSENKO stated, he received something,

"perhaps on the KGB anniversary, or May Day; or Army Day"

In 1957 or 1958, NOSENKO did not recall exactly, he received

for "several recruitments, including Americans MERTENS, DREW,

FRIPPEL," and three British citizens whose names he could

not recall. Along with a large group of KGB officers, NOSENKO

received a commendation from GRIBANOV in 1960, he said,

"for

good work in general".

He received in 1961 the Order of the

Red Star, he statel, with a group of Second Chief Directorate

case officers "for general good work"; IVASHUTIN made the

presentation, which included a medal and a certificate which

the officer may retain.

Comment: A week later, NOSENKO said that he received this

award in December 1962.

He said he recalled

that the presentation was planned for the KGB

Anniversary on 20 December, but the presentation

was delayed and not made until the end

of the

month.

In 1962, NOSENKO claimed, he received another commendation

from GRIBANOV for "general good worl:", and he also received

the Unblemished Service Award for ten

years' service.

Comment: At this juncture his interrogators reminded

NOSENKO that his most recently claimed date

of entry to the KGB was March 1953, and that

in 1962 he would only have had nine years'

service. NOSENKO said that he could not under-

stand why, but he was certain he recéived the

service award after his return from Geneva in

1962.: (The date is consistent with NOSENKO's

earlier retracted claim that he entered the

KGB in 1952.)

The following day NOSENKO

announced that he recalled why he received the

medal in 1962 rather than in 1963; the medal

was awarded to servicemen as well

as to KGB

officers, and prior military service is taken

into account in computing KGB officers' time

in service. NOSENKO entered the Naval RU in

1950, he said, and should have received the

medal in 1960, but did not because of some

administrative mixup.

(See p.56 for NOSENKO'S

eventual claim that he entered the RU in 1951.)

In 1963, NOSENKO said, he received another commendation from

inspiring the Seventh Department' on 20 December 1963, the

KG, anniversary.

NOSENKO said because he left for Geneva,

he did not actually receive the medal. (NOSENKO arrived

in Geneva on

19 January 1964.]

Interrogated in August 1965 regarding his claim to having

received a commendation from KGB Chairman Shelepin for his

recruitment of the three Americans and three British citizens

in 1959, NOSENKO said that he was nominated for the Order

of the Red Banner for these successful recruitments, but he

did not

receive it, probably because he transferred to the

American Embassy Section at that time:

Comment

NOSENKO apparently is referring to the KGB

practice of conferring decorations on KGB

anniversary, 20 December. NOSENKO claims he

transferred

to the Embassy Section in January.

When NOSENKO.'s claims to various KGB awards was reviewed

with him during the October 1966 interrogations, he said

that during his KGB service he had received only the Red

Army anniversary medal and an award for satisfactory comple-

tion of ten years! service, and that he had received no KGB

award, decoration, or commendation for his operational work.

Conclusion

NOSENKO's claims to having been the recipient of various

awards for KGB service are inextricably linked with his

claimed operational

successes,

his rank, and GRIBANOV's

patronage, on all of which topics he had made virtually

categoric retractions.

NOSENKO'S Sourcing

NOSENKO cited four general sources for KGB operations he

has related, and in all four there have been inconsistencies,

contradictions, and retractions.

Three of these categories,

each with an example typifying the difficulty of judging the

O6 MONSoo Man a personal participation In.E.

p. 268) cases learned in the course of specific

Obofficial duties (SHUBIN, p. 296), and information obtained

informally from KGB colleagues (Sgt. Robert Lee JOHNSON,

p.24 ).

The fourth category of sourcing relates to the

notes of KGB operations which he brought to CIA in Geneva

in 1964.

Regarding the notes, NOSENKO said he collected them at

various opportunities

in order to bring them to CIA.

He

kept them in a

wall safe in the: office which he occupied as

Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department.

[In this connection,

NOSENKO admitted that not all offices had such wall safes,

and not all offices of Deputy Chiefs of Departments, but

asserted that his did.]

Most of the notes are in NOSENKO'S

handwriting:

Those that are not include the only copy of a

typed top secret summary report from one of the Seventh

Department section chiefs, a similar handwritten report by

another Seventh Department officer, and a carbon copy of a

KGB document which summarized the recruitment of an| Austrian l|

businessman.

NOSENIO said he copied the date for the

remaining notes from such sources as the "Special File",

ospiro marized

which was held ordinarily by the Seventh Department Chief.

According to NOSENKO, he obtained access

to it for various

reasons from time to time.

The "Special File" contained no

true names, however, and NOSFNKO said he obtained such true

names as were included in his notes by asking various case

officers for them. Questioned on case after case which

appeared in his notes, NOSENKO insisted that he had written

everything he could learn, and could add nothing more.

Conclusion:

NOSENKO's sourcing for many of the events he has related

is not credible.

NÖSENKO 's KGB Rank

When he first met with CIA in Geneva in 1962, NOSENKO

identified himself as a KGB officer holding the

rank of

major. He said at that time that he had served the requisite

time in grade and expected to be promoted shortly to the

rank of lieutenant

colonel

On defecting in 1964 NOSENKO

said that he was a lieutenant colonel.

In the course of his

career as he initially described it, his military rank

pro-

motions

had generally parallelied his assumption of

successively greater supervisory responsibilities, culminating

in his becoming Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department.

Under interrogation, however, questioning about his rank

has evoked a series of inconsistent and contradictory state-

ments leading to his eventual assertion

that he had never

advanced beyond the rank of captain.

The matter of NoSENko's

statements about his rank is significant with respect. to his

general credibility, to the fact that he brought to Geneva

in 1964 a KGB document identifying him as a lieutenant

colonel, and to the paradox that as a company grade officer

he held supervisory positions in which KGB officers of

significantly senior rank were his subordinates.

Top Secret

(OTHER ASPECTS OF NOSENKO'S KGB CAREER)

In June 1962 NOSENKO volunteered that he was then a major,

but that he would soon be promoted to lieutenant colonel.

In 1964, in Frankfurt awaiting transportation to the

United States, NOSENKO reviewed and approved a biographic

statement which included the claim that he had been a senior

lieutenant in the American Embassy Section from 1952 (sic)

until 1955, that he was promoted to captain in 1956, to major

in 1959, and to lieutenant colonel in November 1963.

In the April 1964 interrogations NOSENKO claimed that

at the end of 1953 or the beginning of 1954 [not in 1952]

he was promoted to the rank of senior lieutenant. When it

was taken into consideration.

Asked in June 1964 to list his promotions, chronologically.

NOSENKO asserted that he became a senior lieutenant in 1953,

in 1956 a captain, in 1959 a major and, in October lin

Geneva, just afterwards, he said November] 1963, he was

advised

by Personnel that he had been promoted to lieutenant

colonel

and afterwards was personally congratulated by

General GRIBANOV. NOSENKO did not recall the month of his

earlier promotions.

Comment: KGB defectors have commented that it would be

unusual for a KGB officer not to recall his

date of rank, from which he computes his

seniority and time in grade towards his next

promotion.

In January 1965, while discussing his role as case officer

for Embassy Security Officer John ABIDIAN, NOSENKO volun-

teered out of context that he had never been a major nor was

he promoted to captain in 1956, as he had claimed earlier:

He explained that he became eligible for captain in 1956,

but his promotion was withheld as punishment because he had

obtained treatment for a venereal disease under an alias,

with

the use of KGB operational documents.

He stated that

thus he was a senior lieutenant still in 1959, and although

GRIBANOV had promised him that he would be promoted directly

to major at that time, an administrative error was made in

the personnel office, and he was just promoted to captain.

Instead of rectifying

the mistake, NOSENKO said, GRIBANOV

persuaded him to remain a captain until (if a major) in 1963

he became eligible for promotion to lieutenant colonel.

In October 1963, he concluded, he was promoted directly to

the rank of lieutenant colonel; he was never a major, and

he had served as senior lieutenant. from 1953 to 1959, and

a captain from 1959 to 1963.

Comment®

According to this chronology, NOSENKO was merely

a captain when he claimed to have been Deputy

Chief of the American Embassy Section, and

still a captain for much of the time that he

was Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department.

In August 1965 interrogations NOSENKO still claimed that

he was proposed for advancement to captain in 1956, but he:

stated that he was not promoted because of shortcomings in

his work. [He earlier had claimed he was

being punished

for misuse of operational documents.]

In response to his

interrogator's question, NOSENKO, replied that he had claimed

earlier in 1962 and 1964 to have been a major because he

thought the truth would not have been believed.

In a voluntary statement written in April 1966, NOSENKO

alleged that he had been promoted to the rank of senior

lieutenant in 1956 [he earlier. claimed 19531, to captain in

Conclusion

NOSENKO has stated that he became a senior lieutenant in

the KGB in 1952, April 1953, 1954, or 1956.

He was promoted

to the rank of captain in 1956 or September/October/December

1959; a major in December 1958 or 1959; and a lieutenant .

colonel in October/November 1963. He brought to Geneva in

1964, an official KGB document dated November 1963 identifying

him as a KGB lieutenant colonel. In retracting his claim

that he was ever a major or lieutenant colonel, NOSENKO

asserts that nevertheless as a captain, he held the position

of First Deputy Chief of

NOSENKO's contradictions and retractions with respect to

his KGB rank parallel and are apparently related to his

contradicted and retracted claims regarding Naval RU

service, date of entry to the KGB, KGB assignments and

do, and T

positions held; and in short, to the totality of his claims

regarding KGB service, few of which are credible.

CHAPTER X

PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PSYCHIATRIC ASSESSMENT

Because of the incidence of deranged persons CIA has

encountered among many would-be defectors, the question of

NOSENKO's mental stability was a matter considered early

after his defection in Geneva.

From the time of his arrival

in the United States he has been under psychiatric observa-

tion. In addition, he has undergone psychological examina-

tion. The CIA psychiatrist and psychologist, besides being

highly-qualified professionals, have both had extensive

experience with Soviet Bloc defectors. Their findings were

reached independently.

Psychological Examination

In April 1964 NOSENKO was administered a series óf

psychological tests by the CIA psychologist.

After monitoring

numerous interrogation sessions, the psychologist interviewed

NOSENKO for fourteen days during 3-21 April 1965, in an

attempt to develop sufficient insight into NOSENKO's persona-

lity to permit the obtaining of a truthful account of his

life.

Findings

NOSENKO is a rationalizer, a distorter, and an evasive

person clearly capable of dissemvling for personal reasons.

He is not a compulsive liar.. He

is inclined to relate what

he thinks he is expected to say rather than to tell the

truth as he knows it. He lies by design as well as for

effect, however, and

he does not always embroider just to

bolster his ego. He is neither "insane" nor psychotic, and

he suffers from no "delusions". NOSENKO's rationalizations

are not the product of derangement.

(PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PSYCHIATRIC ASSESSMENT)

Psychiatric Examination

Since April 1964 NOSENKO has been under the observation

of the CIA psychiatrist.

Besides monitoring many of the

interrogation sessions,

the psychiatrist has visited NOSENKO

weekly for the first year, monthly until 1967, and at some-

what less frequent intervals

since.

Findings

NOSENKO is neither psychotic nor neurotic. Of above

average intelligence, he is shrewd, perceptive,

adaptable. His memory is not defective. Besides suffering

from ordinary lapses of memory, however, he sometimes

falsely claims lack of recall. NOSENKO's thought processes

are unimpaired; he is rational and fully capable of distin-

guishing fact from fiction.

PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PSYCHIATRIC ASSESSMENT: Conclusion

The findings of the psychologist and psychiatrist dispel

the notion that NOSENKO's behavior and his statements are

other than willful.

SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS

CONCERNING NOSENKO'S BONA FIDES

NOSENKO claims that he served for a decade in the KGB in

successively senior positions of authority from

which he

derived extensive knowledge of the scope, character, and

results of KGB operations against Americans in the Soviet

Union in the period. 1953-1963.

he provides an impressive array of information about KGB

personnel, organization and operations which, to the extent

that it has been confirmed, is presumptive evidence of his

bona fides. Various Soviet officials, including intelli-

gence officers, have generally corroborated NOSENKO's

claims.

The examination has compared each element of NOSENKO's

biography relevant to his claimed KGB service with known

facts and reasonable surmise.

The examination reflects

the test to which

his accounts

were put:

whether his

accounts are internally coherent and

consistent with known

fact, and whether he actually gained the information he has

from occupying the KGB positions he claims to have held.

In short, is he what he says he is, according to his own

accounts?

(SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS)

This examination had led to the following findings,

arrived at independently:

-NOSENKO did not serve in the Naval RU in any of the

capacities or at the places and times he claimed.

-NOSENKO did not enter the KGB in the manner or at

the time he claimed.

-NOSENKO did not serve in the American Embassy Section

throughout the 1953-1955 period as he claimed.

-During the period 1955-1960, he was neither a senior

case officer in, nor Deputy Chief of, the Seventh Depart-

ment American-British Commonwealth Section.

-NOSENKO was neither Deputy Chief of the American

Embassy Section nor

a senior officer or supervisor in

the Section during the period 1961-1962.

-NOSENKO's claims, that in 1962 he was Chief of the

American-British Commonwealth Section and was thereafter

a Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department, are not credible.

-NOSENKO has no. valid. claim to certainty that the KGB

recruited no American Embassy personnel between 1953 and

his defection in 1964.

These findings differ somewhat with respect to degree of

probability or certitude, but they reflect the preponderance

of available evidence in

each instance.

The above judgments, if correct, rebut presumptive

evidence of NOSENKO's bona fides.

The contradictions in

NOSENKO's accounts of his life and KGB service are so

extensive as to make his claims as a whole unacceptable.

While truth and fact in this case frequently cannot be

established with certainty, it is evident that truth and

fact are not what NOSENKO relates.

By almost any test,

virtually any of NOSENKO's above claims are impugned by

fact or probability, or contradicted or retracted in his own

statements. NOSENKO is not what he claims to be, and

thus

he is not a bona fide defector.

(SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS)

Given the conclusion that NOSENKO is not a bona fide

defector, it is necessary to attempt to determine his true

motives for contacting American Intelligence and for

providing the information he has given.

Here, it must be

recognized that the evidence, largely consisting of NOSENKO's

own assertions, does not permit unequivocal conclusions:

Nevertheless, the question cannot be ignored.

The character

of the information NOSENKO has conveyed, the fact that some

of his false claims have been corroborated by Soviet offi-

cials, and the necessity to make decisions about NOSENKO's

future all require that at least a provisional judament be

made.

Of the reasonable explanations advanced for NOSENKO's

misrepresentations, the chief ones are that he is a

swindler posing as a former KGB officer for reasons of

personal advantage;

that he suffers from a deranged person-

ality or unbalanced mind; that he has greatly exaggerated

his actual rank, status and access in the KGB, for simply

personal reasons; Of, finally, that he is a dispatched KGB

agent.

The first two possibilities are easily dismissed. That

NOSENKO is not

simply a swindder who falsely claims for

personal advantage to have been a KGB officer is evident;

we believe, from the confirmed details of KGB organization,

personnel and operations which he has provided and which

could only derive from within the KGB itself.

Second, as noted in the text, extensive psychiatric and

psychological examination by qualified specialists rule out

the possibility that NOSENKO's actions and testimony are the

product of a deranged personality or unbalanced mind.

It is somewhat more plausible that NOSENKO is a KGB

officer who served in at least some

of the components for

some or all of the

time periods that he claims, but who

greatly exaggerated his positions, rank and access to infor-

mation, and invented some matters outright, to achieve

greater status with American Intelligence.

This explanation,

however, fails to accommodate the fact that several KGB

officers have asserted that NOSENKO did in fact hold senior

(SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS)

positions in the KGB. Also, NOSENKO's assertions with

respect to his rank, GRIBANOV's patronage, the recall

telegram, and the like, cannot be just a product of his own

invention, since these

were the subject of comment by other

sources.

Because none' of the above explanations is consistent with

the data developed in interrogations and investigations, we

are left with the hypothesis that NOSENKO was dispatched by

the KGB. While this explanation does not reconcile all the

anomalies, none of them renders it untenable.

In the absence of further revelations by NOSENKO, Or

other persuasive evidence to the contrary, CIA finds that

the evidence establishes a presumption that NOSENKO was

dispatched by the KGB, and believes that prudence requires

that he be regarded as still responsive to KGB control, and

that his information should be assessed accordingly.

Vladimir DEMKIN of the Embassy Section was the case officer

working against BINDER, and the Chief of the American

Department S.M. FEDOSEYEV participated in the recruitment

attempt, in 1962, by which time NOSENKO had transferred to

the Seventh Department and thus knew no further details.

Comment:

06

U.S. Army Master Sergeant Peter BINDER served

as manager of the America House from 16 March Of,09

196I to 22 January 1963. On 15 January 1963 he

reported to Embassy officials that he had been

abducted off the street by Soviet plainclothes-

men, taken to a Militia station, and interro-

gated on the substance of a letter alleged to

have been written by Galya MORELLI, which his

interrogators threatened to send to thé

Ambassador.

25 November 1961, had warned Soviet employees

against Embassy Security Officer John ABIDIAN,

that MORELLI had told (BINDER] she was pregnant 06

that she and other Soviets should be wary of

him.

on to the Ambassador, he was allowed

to go free 06 BINDER acknowledges that he was

en route back to Paris, was arrested in Prague

when his AEROFLOT flight was diverted.

presumably relates to his 1962-64 service in

the Seventh Department, had not been established.
