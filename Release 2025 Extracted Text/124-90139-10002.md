Washall

We previously have

been informed that the subject is a

nige ranking oitical in the Cuban G-2 organization in Havana.

on (5)

10/8/63, MrS. Anita Potocki, a CIA analyst who has been working

on intercepted Cuban communications intelligence traffic advised

noted that messages sent to the unidentified Cuban Agent in Panama

referred to as "Roberto" have been signed by ("Petronio]"(

Mrs. Potocki gave the following explanation

lich led to

CIA's deduction.

S(4)

Messages emanating from Havana indicated that one of the

recipients was probably located in a small town in Colombia near the

Venezuelan Border.

CIA developed a suspect and instituted coverage..

Recently, this individual transmitted a letter to Havana which

communication was intercepted by CIA.. The person had apparently

violated instructions by including some sensitive data in the

communication. Havana then transmitted a radio message astigating

the

yuban agent in colombia.

An examination of the radio message

ind the intercepted communication sent by the Agent has Lec

to believe that ("Petronio) §)

1s identical with Pineiro. S

ACTION:

The above information is being directed to the Nationalities

Intelligence Section.
