~ Recommendation for Promotion

=CASASIN

1. s

sets has been under my supervision as Deputy and

Case Ufficer for approximately fifteen months. Based on the knowledge of

-Fedulekha as an Individual gained during this perlod and upon his actual

perfomance, I recommend that he be entered for consideration on the SR

Division CS-1i to G5-15 promotion list at this time - Jure 1957.

The slot

and job which be nor occuples, Chief, Soviat Branch, is, of coursa, adequate

to accormodate

fich a pronotion.

2.

seesoperational performance has been outstanding and

notably versatils during this period. He has engaged primarily in liaison

and has been personally effectiva in termg of rasults achioved almost daily,

1n teims of reports, operational data, and joint enterprisa; while, overall,

he has established enduring professional relationships fron which tha

organization as a wole should bensfit for some time to come. In addition,

owing in largo part to unique personal talents, linguistic and otherwise,

assisten bas handled a nunber of unilateral cases nost effectively.

In

the office, too, as well as in face-to-face operational situations, sise

has been cutstanding. He has a flair for and a facility with the written word

as evidenced by the amount of general and particular correspondence which ha

has initiated, and ha knows the organisational "drill" intimately and from way.

back. Thus, I feel that he 1s qualified for the recormended promotion by

ability ant experience in both the internal and exteral aspects. of the

profession.

3. Falstive to tha more personal characteristics involved in the ter

managerial ability, judgments are recessarily nore subjective but here, too,

I consider lea

was to be qualified in maturity, in judgment, and in

experience.

He would most certainly be a supervisor nho could periom all

the chores or handle all the situations which he would be calling upon

subordimies to take care of, in itself, the begining of any good supervisory

relationship. In actual fact, ha has. had considerable experience in this

regard alreadr and the pricipal shortcoming I have noticed is a tendency to

"carry" others by an extension of his orm industry. Bistash is ret without

his difficulties in tha area of parsonal relationships.

He is a purist at

times and snifestly impatient in certain human situations where a shrug of

the shouliers would be the best reply.

These characteristics de not always

make for the best personal relationships but are fraguently obriated by.

Intellect and above all are correctable and are being corrected.
