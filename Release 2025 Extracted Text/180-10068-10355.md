EDUCATION

Baltimore Public School system until 12th grade

High School equivalency received July, 1967

At present, I have earned 45 credits towards an

Associate of Arts Degree in Criminal Justice at

Essex Community College, Baltimore County, Md.

EXPERIENCE

January 10, 1964 sworn into the Baltimore City Police Department - finishing

3rd in standing of 27 graduates. Thereafter assigned to the Southeastern

District in uniform patrol that covered high crime areas. During this as-

signment I handled all types of felony and misdemeanor investigations and

arrests.

December 1967 transferred to the Criminal Investigation Division and assigned

to the Vice Control Unit. In this capacity was assigned to undercover work in

the areas of prostitution and gambling violations.

While in this assignment,

I kept a low profile and learned to develop sources of select confidential

information.

In May 1968 was promoted to Detective Patrolman and re-assigned to the Crimes

Against Persons Unit - Homicide Squad, which is my present assignment. While

in this division, I have personally investigated in the excess of 225 homidices

and have been actively involved with another 150 homicide investigations.

have also conducted hundreds of investigations into the areas of questionable

death, suicide, serious assault, kianapping, armed robbery, extortion, threats

of death and hostage situations.

For a period of about four years, have also

investigated numerous sex related offenses such as rape, perverted practices,

etc.

As a result of these investigations, I have testified in the muncipal court,

Criminal. Court Supreme Bench, and the Grand Jury systems in the city of Barte-

more and State of Maryland.

On most occasions, the court recognizes me as an

expert in the field of homicides and related death investigations.

During my assignment in the Homicide Squad, I have acted in the capacity of

field supervisor for about 3 1/2 years, supervising 5 to 1 investigators and

their assignments.

Have also had the experience of acting undercover while

with the unit and on two occasions I was hired as a paid assassin. During

these operations I worked with several forms of electronic equipment and

became familiar with it.

I am acutely aware of how to search crime scenes; recover and preserve evidence;

examine bodies; interrogate suspects; locate and interview possible witnesses;

take full and formal affadavits and all other areas of homicide investigations.

I furthermore have written and have been named the affiant on numerous search

warrants and seizure orders.

It has been my duty on occasion to travel into other states and jurisdictions

and take custody of fugitives from justice and return them to this city to be

criminally charged.

During my tenure as a law enforcement officer, I have handled numerous line-

ups, surveillances, and details for the protection of suspects, informants and co-

operative witnesses.

I have a full training background in the area of handguns, shotguns, rifle and

tear gas devices.

TRAINING

ae comeded the "Francis, a grasa, " Her che dect, Peed at the Medical

Russell Fisher.

Have also attended and completed a "Federal Bureau of Investigation" seminar

on "Homicide and Sex Mutilation", held in Washington, D.C.

Furthermore, I have conducted and attended numerous training classes and pro-

cedure lectures held by the Baltimore City Police Department.

COMMENDATIONS

Since becoming a member of the Baltimore City Police Department in January

1964, I have been awarded the following commendations and citations:

Two Commendation Ribbons

Three Bronze Star Medals of Valor

Six Letters of Commendation

One Certificate of Achievement from

the American Legion

I have recently been recommended by my superior officers for the Department's

Medal of Honor for my actions during a sniper incident and the killing of a

police officer.
