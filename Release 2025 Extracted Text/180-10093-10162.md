RAM

Peter Carroll Glynn, Jr.

April 25, 19.77

Pursuant to an earlier phone contact, I interviewed Mr.

Glynn on his job at 4301 Suitland Road, Suitland, Maryland

at 2:35 p.m. Friday, April 22, 1977.

Subject is employed as

an Intelligence Analyst by NOSIC (Naval Oceanic Surveillance

Information Center) 763-2258 and resides at 107 Howard

Street, Dumfries, Virginia, 221-8748.

He was serving with the U.S. Army on 11-22-63 assigned

to Fort Walters, Mineral Wells, Texas as a radio technician

and as such regularly monitered messages between Mexico and

Cuba. As a result, he overheard comments in the sphere which

were adverse to the newly assassinated President and were

upsetting to him. Although he doesn't recall the exact

dialogue, the gist concerned the humor found by the Cubans

and Mexicans appraising this murder as being done by his own

people and yet suspecting foreigners like themselves.

Consequently, it has occurred to Glynn that we may

benefit by causing a thorough check to be made of the ASA

(Army Security Agency) who Glynn believes recorded all such

messages usually in tape form-and stored same. He also

prepared dossier of which he gave me the original and one

He goes on to say their mission at Fort walters was

labeled a training mission and, as such, was comprehensive

enough to encompass the recording of all such collateral

messages.

Additionally, he recalls the Mexican sending

station used the name of "Chihuahua."
