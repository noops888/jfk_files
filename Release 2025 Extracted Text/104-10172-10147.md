This report

stressed the points that the farmers and the

fishermen in PBRUMEN

are the most willing and capable of providing support to resis-

tance activities as a result of their having suffered the most at

the hands of the current administration after being largely

He has had one meeting with AMBUD-1 for the purpose of

maintaining contact.

His main question to AYBUD-I was with

regard

to the latter's ability to actually control the people on his staff.

He was disappointed by the reply which though positive could not be

supported with an example of where AMBUD-l had actually brought

about the dismissal of anvone nho had proved to be ineffective.

MCENIM-l is a pood friend of AMBUn-l as a result of his father's

long standine relationship with hin, but at this point has very

little respect for him as a result of, as he says, AYBUD-l's

failure to actually make his orranization into an

him the go ahead.

Following his belief that the most incortant job at hand

is the develodnent and maintenance of maritime reception points

alony, the north coast of PBRUMEN, AMDENIM-l has devoted considerable

time to readying assets anong his exiled fisherman friends to make

contact with their former fisherman associates still based in

PBRUMEN.

The foundation for this activity is quite: tenuous as a

of a variety of factors which make it difficult to arrange

sea rendezvouses in the absence of radio contact. - Several tries

have been made to the Anguila Key area for this purpose, the last

of which was supported by KUBARk and was.

called Operation Antonico

I: This attempt

was unsuccessfut due to the failure of the inside

contact to appear.

It developed that the woman and child who were

to be exfiltrated

on this operation appeareu in the JMyAVE area

two days later, havins obtained permission to leave PBRUMEN by air.

They carried the message that someone had stolen the port chief's

personal boat as a result of which the inside contact was unable

to depart on

schedule due to the implementation of temporary re-

strictions until the theft had been investigated. She said the

next rendezvous was scheduled for 12 August, however imminent bad

weather forestalled any chance of making this rendezvous. The

effort to establish contact continues on

the basis that, once a

system can be set up, it wilt be comparatively easy to es-

tablish further rendezvouses and thus develop ratlines into the

north coast.

Coincidentally with the above AMDENIM-l is continuing

his afforts to come up with radio operator candidates and

to obtain

candidates for infiltration.

Based upon past experience

effort is being made more selective in that the need for more self

sufficient personnel is greater than ever..

The increasing diffi-

culty of covering people inside makes it necessary to reduce the

size of the infiltration parties and to have people who can with-

stand the rigorg of existing on minimum supplies until they can

establish themselves with natives who are willinz to provide thei

with a base of operations.

Most of the people who are willing to

infiltrate at this point are of the type who want immediate action

and are unwilling to take the time to establish a clandestine base

from which they can methodically develop the assets in place who

are essential to the growth and refinement of a resistance base.

He has a number of people on tap who are qualified as candidates:

for snall guerrilla

teams, but who are not capable of maintaining

themselves clandestinely until the time for guerrilla action
