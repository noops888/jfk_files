PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF SUBJECT:

I knew Phil during the entire time he was in
Branch I at Headquarters, and during his tour in
Mexico. We came to Mexico PCS at the same time.
This means I knew him from 1966 until he resigned.
In Headquarters our relationship was limited to
business in the office, and that was 'not very
frequent. We sat in different rooms. He handled SB
matters. I did the routing of all Branch
correspondence which meant I decided what he was to
see--this was anything affecting Soviet/Satellite/
Chinese matters. My main areas of responsibility
were in the support field. Even though we were both
processing out at the same time, we did not exchange
stories much. However, since I traveled as a
"Tourist" and was not therefore allowed to bring
anything into Mexico, Phil offered to have some of
my things packed with his household effects since
he said he owned hardly anything. One day my husband
and I took some boxes of things over to his apartment
before work. I do not remember the name of the
apartment development in Virginia, but it was the
garden type. His apartment was nice--fairly new
but sparsely furnished. He helped us unload the things
and take them upstairs. Then we parted. I seem to recal
the had some trouble with his car that morning and we
dropped him off at a repair shop on the way to the
office.
At this time, in Washington, Phil was very
pleasant, was nice to work with. He did not appear
to be pushy, even though he did everything he could
to get the Mexican assignment. At this time, despite
his family problems, he did not appear to let these
affect his work. At least from my position he seemed
to get his work done, not to procrastinate, not to
take a lot of time off. From the goss gossip I heard,
he was separated, and was anxious to get any assignment
overseas. When the possibility of this Olympic job
opened up in Mexico he grabbed it. As I recall, C/WH/1
was sympathetic toward him also, and was happy to be
able to help Phil at this particular time.

In Mexico when Phil's louseirold effects arrived

to my house and we unloaded them into our apartment.

invited him over to supper one evening. (Willard C.
CURTIS had given permission for individual officers
to have Phil over to dinner if no outsiders were
present and prior permission was obtained.) I think
I got permission from the DCOS at that time. There
were only the three of us (Phil, my husband, and
myself--no maid, no other invited guests) There was
no discussion of office. My husband knew Phil was with
BKTRUST and was working on the Olympics in Mexico.
Conversation was light. During dinner, as I recall,
we talked about business in Mexico, and he mentioned
his father was in the dry cleaning business, and
he thought he might be interested in bringing into
Mexico some used dry cleaning equipment which is worth
nothing in the United States, and set up some dry
cleaning establishments in Mexico. The discussion
was merely in generalities--nothing specific as to
timetable or even if Phil were serious about this.
About a week later Phil brought his car over and
my husband helped him work on his car--a car--adjusting it
to the altitude. This must have been around September
1967.
Shortly thereafter, when Laura B. UTSTINE was
in Mexico TDY (she worked in WH/1 and also knew Phil
at Headquarters), Phil had my husband, me, and UTSTINE
over to his apartment (on Insurgentes Sur just off the
Viaducto) for dinner. It was a huge hug apartment,, sparsely
furnished. We had an enjoyable evening, very light
conversation. Talked mostly about Mexico. At this time
he showed us he had several bedrooms (forget how many)
and hopefully his sons would be able to visit him.
During his tour in Mexico I only saw Phil in the
Station occasionally--and then just in passingin the
halls. Once after I heard about Phil's having kidnaped
his boys, I thought I saw them (can't remember why I
thought they were his) in front of the Embassy with a
maid. I never saw Phil in the Embassy proper nor at
any Embassy functions (I was tourist and did not
circulate in the Embassy).

have met with Phil. At this time Phil looked neat
and well kept, as I recall.

in Branch I, and was privy to almost everything
going on at the Mexico City Station. He

In Mexico City Phil knew I was in the Cuban section,
and privy to all operations being run against the
Cuban target. He did not know of operations in
particular except possibly LIARM-1 (now terminated)
who we hoped to use against the Cuban olympic
target. The Cuban Section tried to talk with Phil
many times about the Cuban delegations to the
0lympics, but as I recall, C/Cuba only succeeded in

discussions between C/Cuba (Raymond F. FRADYER)
and Phil, but I believe they were mainly held
to see who Phil had met who might be useful
against the Cuban target. I know we thought at
the time Phil was spending almost full time on his
overt activities and the SB target, and he gave
the Cuban target little attention.
4. OTHER AGENCY PERSONNEL
At Headquarters in WH/1 Phil shared his cubicle
with LIADLIB-1 who was pressing to get overseas
as much as Phil, for different reasons.
Ex-
LIADLIB-1 was a much more pusiny individual, less
experienced operationally (right out of the JOT
program) and out to benefit himself entirely--
much more so than Phil.24 LIADLIB-1 went out of channe
constantly, talking of (NOC cover) ideas (for himself),
and going right to the head of Training or JOT
(can't remember which) and WOMACE on ideas and
suggestions, without necessarily going through the
Branch or Division. He had many business deals on
the side (one was as a landscaper in Virginia)
and had great prospects for business deals in
Mexico. He wangled gled a NOCjob ob in Mexico (replacing
LILINK) and was inserted in the (Li)GLOBE program while
he knew Phil (I think this was the timing.) He was
also quite open in his bragging he had been hired
as a GS-13 (I think it was) and did not have to go
up tpuranks. This might have irritated Phil who
was still a 12. Ex-LIADLIB came to Mexico PCS about

the same time Phil and I came.
no close friendship between Ex-LIADLIB and Phil
on the desk, the fact they sat together, were
poth processing out for Mexico, would have meant
they had something in common. Also, LIADLIB was then
handling all the projects for CP and leftist
penetration operations for the Station and Base
(Monterrey). Phil would have more than casual
interest in some of these as some were being handled
in the field by Howard R. BENJAYA, an old friend of
Phil's from Ecuador.) I do not know that Phil and
SECRET/SENSITIVE
Ex-LIADLIB ever met socially in Mexico or not.
I am quite certain their work paths never crossed.
LIADLIB is still in Mexico. He has had a difficult
time since his "resi "resignation" getting a job,
keeping a job, and making ends meet.
It probably
would be to BKTRUST's disadvantage now for
the two to meet. For this reason, and to assess
ex-LIADLIB-s present state of mind, Headquarters
sent someone to talk with LIADLIB-1 in the spring
of 1972. At that time he still seemed bitter
against BKTRUST.
Other than wishing to make special mention of
EX-LIADLIB-1, I know of no Agency personnel
other than those in WH/1 and the Mexico City Statio
whom he knew.
5. OTHER U.S. GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL
I know of none except the Olympic Attache in Mexico
under whom Agee worked from July 1967 until the
end of the Olympics.
