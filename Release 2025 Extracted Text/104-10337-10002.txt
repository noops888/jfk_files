2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
25 August 1993
NOTE FOR: All HRG Members
SUBJECT: Briefing of HPSCI on Denied JFK Documents
This is to let everyone know that HRG has been asked to
brief the HPSCI staff on the 10,000 pages of JFK materials
that we have denied in full (so far).
The request came from HPSCI Chairman Dan Glickman, who
apparently anticipates questions from others in Congress
about the denied documents.
Among the questions we are asked to address in the
briefing are the following:
- How many documents are involved (as opposed to
pages)?
- What specific types of sources and methods are
we protecting?
- What is the review process?
- Who made the judgments to deny the documents?
- Are there provisions for continuing review of the
denied documents?
We've asked that the briefing not take place until the
week of 30 August, but HPSCI may want it sooner.

in determining which records will be postponed. (Section 6)
3. We made every effort to meet the 22 August deadline
established by the JFK Act. The Director was committed to
this.
4. This called for a major effort--additional people,
lot of overtime and weekend shifts.

1. Marwell requested a figure for the number of
records in the sequestered files that contained
postponements. I explained that our review figures were
based on pages and that there was no record count for the
microfilm part of the collection. However, based on the HRG
index unaudited record count (see below) of the Oswald 201
file and the JFK hardcopy boxes, I was able to give him an
estimate of 28,000 records.
2. Unaudited HRG Index statistics:

32,881 (154,724 pages) 14,003
The page count for the hardcopy part of the collection is
within 10,000 pages of the Microfilm (163,500). Given that
the microfilm contains many duplicates and similar records
as the hardcopy, the percentage of sanitized documents
should be close to the same. I estimate the total number of
records with postponements to be approximately 28,000.

Phone Conversation with Susan Oullette, HPSCI
As you requested, I called Susan Oullette, HPSCI Staff today to respond to her questions about JFK Assassination records. She said that
the Committee was interested in the process used for declassifying the records, the status of our review, and what criteria we use for
declassification.
Following are among the main topics we covered during a discussion of about 10 minutes on the STU-III:
- A description of the JFK records held by CIA
- Process of declassification (review by retired senior officers, coordination with DO,
OGC, others)
- Criteria for redaction
- Coordination with FBI, other agencies on third agency documents.
- Presidentially-appointed JFK Assassination Records Review Board
- Differences with the Board on release of certain information e.g.,
names of former employees, identification of stations
- Current appeal to the White House of decision by Board to release
certain information we redacted.
- Efforts of the Board to identify additional records, including in other
countries
Susan said that she may have enough information for now, but she would let me know if more would be needed. I invited her to visit us if
she wanted more details or to look at the records.

HPSCI talking points
Thought you may be interested in seeing in advance an outline of what I plan to say at the HPSCI briefing. Of course, I will be ready to
alter this according to the circumstances of the meeting!
Talking Points
I. Statutory Authorities of the JFK Board
1. The JFK Act states that all government records relating
to the JFK assassination should carry a presumption of immediate
disclosure and that all records will eventually be disclosed.
Although the Act allows for the postponement of release of
certain information, all records will be disclosed in full by
2017 unless the President certifies that protection is still
necessary.
2. Under the JFK Act, the JFK Board determines what is an
"assassination record" and whether an assassination record
qualifies for postponement. The Board has the power to direct a
government agency to make available to it, not only assassination
records, but additional information which it believes is
necessary to fullfill its duties under the Act. It has has the
power to request the Attorney General to subpoena private
persons, records and other information relevant to its
responsibilities under the Act.
II. Appeal Procedures set out in JFK Act
1. Once Board has determined whether a record shall be
released or postponed, it must send a "Notification Letter" to
the head of the agency (DCI)
2. Only recourse for an agency that disagrees with Board
determination is to appeal to the President.
3. The President has 30 days from the date of the
Notification Letter to reply to appeal
a. White House asks that agencies submit any
ADMINISTRATIVE - INTERNAL USE ONLY
SECRET
13-00000
ADMINISTRATIVE - INTERNAL USE ONLY
SECRET
appeals within 7 days of receiving Notification Letter
4. CIA has never before presented an appeal to the
President; FBI presented an appeal last year but the White House
told the parties to work out their difficulties.
III. February 8th Appeal
1. In November and December of 1995, the JFK Board
notified DCI of the release of documents that would:
- implicate high-ranking Mexican officials in a joint
tel-tap operation against foreign embassies Mexican liaison
(December 7)
- reveal station in Helsinki (December 27)
- identify sensitive unilateral source in the
Nicaraguan service (November 28)
2. On February 8, DCI submitted an appeal to the President
on these issues.
a. Admittedly, CIA did have problems getting appeal
out on time. The JFK staff was very understanding of our time
problems and arranged to give us more time. They too have
recognized that the time periods set out in the Act are too short
to bring an appeal.
b. The reason for CIA's delay was simply because the
decision to appeal a Board determination to the President of the
US is very difficult one to make, both on a procedural and a
substantive level. As CIA never did an appeal before, it did not
have an efficient system worked out.
c. Today, the procedure is as follows: Once HRG is
notified of Board decisions, they immediately pass this on to OGC
and the DO. The appropriate components within DO are asked
whether the release would cause current damage to the national
security or intelligence operations or sources. If so, they are
tasked to provide a written assessment of that damage.
d. This package must then be approved by GC, DDO, EXDIR, DDCI
and DCI.
e. Although CIA's turn around time is improving, it
can take several weeks to task the appropriate people, have them
gather the information needed to prepare an appeal and then get
this up to the DCI.
3. Despite our time problems, the JFK Staff was
cooperative in the process of bringing this appeal to the
President:
ADMINISTRATIVE - INTERNAL USE ONLY
SECRET
13-00000
ADMINISTRATIVE - INTERNAL USE ONLY
SECRET
a. Before submitting appeal to the President, I faxed
copy of appeal to JFK Board's General Counsel with the idea that
if it presented new and convincing evidence, he would present it
to the Board during its session.
b. Shortly after submitting the appeal to the
President, I spoke with White House Counsel and Counsel to JFK
Board. We agreed to put the appeal on hold until the Board could
review CIA's submission to the White House and possibly
reconsider its determinations in light of additional information
presented in the appeal.
c. I talked with JFK Board's Counsel and Executive
Director regularly about the best way to handle the appeal. I
arranged with them to have the General Counsel of CIA to come to
the Board's February meeting and present new information
regarding the issues on appeal.
d. On February 29, the General Counsel of CIA and I
met with the JFK Board and their staff. We discussed issues on
appeal as well as 3 other stations recently released (Oslo,
Stockholm, Copenhagen)
e. Based on the information presented by CIA at this
meeting, the Board reconsidered and agreed to protect all of the
issues on appeal as well as 3 other stations.
IV. Future appeal procedures
1. Both JFK Board and CIA agree that we should never have
to appeal something to the President and we should try to work
out difficult issues on our own.
2. In the last 2 months, when CIA believed that a release
would damage the national security, the Board has invited us to
their meetings to present additional evidence on the issue. In
some cases, they have reconsidered their decision and protected
the information.
3. The Board also recently released Tokyo station - we are
arranging to meet with them at the end of this month to present
stronger arguments for protecting this station.
4. The Board is now considering the release of names of
CIA employees who retired under cover. It is very important for
CIA's mission that the names of its employees, especially those
who remain covert, be protected even after retirement. In the
spirit of cooperation and in the hopes of getting the Board to
understand this, CIA helped arrange a meeting between the JFK
Board's General Counsel and a retired CIA covert employee

currently living in Europe. CIA hopes that after hearing from
the employee about his objections to having his name released and
the harm that may come to him, the Board will agree to protect
his name, and others like him, from release.

-(EXECUTIVE SUMMARY) -
Following a telephone conversation with HPSCI staff in which
HRG/CSI noted a number of JFK assassination declassification
issues (see OCA C/96-05672 of 27 Mar 96,) CSI, DO, and OGC
briefed staff on the status of the JFK declassification
effort, the 1992 law which established the JFK Assassination
Records Review Board and the scope of the Board's authority, and
the details of some current declassification issues we
have been addressing with the Board. We noted the close
working relationship between the Agency and the Board, and
said that the Board staff is trying to understand the
Agency's equities and perspectives. Some staff expressed
concern about the Board's broad powers and authorities under
the 1992 law, particularly regarding declassification of
intelligence material bearing on identities, sources, and
methods. (S)
-(ADDITIONAL INFORMATION)
1. C/CSI/Historical Review Group Pereira opened by briefly
describing the nature of the CIA JFK material. The
open-ended "Oswald 201" also includes material gathered after
the assassination, and the "sequestered file" is that material
that was assembled for the JFK assassination investigations. The
material was originally sanitized and released to the
National Archives in 1993. We are now reviewing the 227,000 pages
and attempting to justify the material we withheld. Some
seventy percent of the released material contains redactions, although
later in the briefing we noted that as our experience has
grown the redaction standards have evolved and now most material (up
to eighty percent) is being released whole. Some 25
senior annuitants, working closely with a DO team led by Wickham, have
been performing the initial review. Pereira pointed
out that we are not only reviewing the assassination records, but
those records bearing on the House Assassinations
Committee's investigation of the assassination. Pereira identified
the five academic historians who make up the Board, and
said they are supported by 30 full-time Board staffers headed by
former Berlin Documentation Center chief David Marwell.

Pereira said that the 1992 Act specifies that the Board must have "clear and convincing evidence" if we want to postpone
release, and said that the Board requires "current justification" if we want to protect agent identities, sources and methods, or
liaison identities. Under the law, the Board has the authority to release all information, and must justify in the Federal Register
within 14 days any redactions. The Board sees the full text of all documents. Pereira said that we negotiate with the Board
the use of summaries or generic descriptions (such as substituting "a northern European station" for Helsinki) and that the
Board is making an "honest effort" to see the connection between 30 year old information and current damage to Agency
equities. Dupart asked rhetorically whether the Board understood the concept of ongoing liaison, with Wickham saying that
the Board clearly had a different perspective from the DO, and that the ADDO, General Counsel, Cover Staff and others have
briefed the Board in detail to address this "problem." Harrelson pointed out that our joint teltaps had recorded Oswald himself,
although we assured the clearly unhappy Dupart that we are trying to protect the fact that liaison cooperated in the teltaps. We
also noted our effort to protect the identities of covert Agency employees, although we are working particularly hard in cases
where the Agency employees now reside overseas. Pereira said we are concemed about the cumulative erosive effect on our
cover and our ability to conduct operations. He noted that the Board tends to focus on individual specific cases without always
focusing on the broader cumulative impact of their discrete decisions. (S)
2. (Cipriani described the appeals process specified in the 1992 JFK Act. She also lent Sheehy a copy of the act, which he
studied carefully during the briefing. Under the 1992 act, documents related to JFK carry the "presumption of release," with the
Board defining which records fall under the act. We have to justify any redactions or postponements, and Board decisions can
only be appealed to the President himself (which, as Cipriani dryly noted, tends to inhibit appeals.) The act also specifics very
short deadlines, with only 30 days for the President to make his decision. (This means we have only about seven days to get
our appeals out of Hqs and to the White House--a practical impossibility.) Our only appeal to date involved three issues: (i) a
cable implicating senior Mexican officials in our joint teltaps, (ii) the identification of the very sensitive Helsinki Station, and (iii)
the identity of a Nicaraguan source. In fact our appeal took several months, with the Board being very accommodating about
the delay, and we finally were able to give the Board enough justification and explanation that they changed their position and
spared the White House the decision. Healey noted that the Agency declassification team includes a DO team (as noted
above,) and asked why we hadn't been able to head off the problem. (Cipriani responded that new information arises for the
Board to consider in making its determination, and Wickham elaborated by noting that the DO is reluctant to reveal sensitive
current information to protect old material. He characterized this as a problem of "DO culture." At the same time, he cited the
specific example of the Mexicans declining to meet the DCI on his recent Latin American trip as illustrative of Mexican
sensitivity to the liaison issue. We later noted that the only other appeal thus far involves the FBI, and the White House has
told the Bureau to resolve the matter with the Board. (S)
3. Pereira noted to the staffers that we're dealing with very short deadlines involving enormous volumes of material, and
illustrated by showing the staff a bulky recent Board declassification notification which we must review to confirm we have no
problem with the material involved. In response to a Sheehy question, Harrelson reminded staff that the original redaction and
submission to the Board took place in 1992-3, and as noted above, our redaction standards and judgements have evolved
since then. Further, we have to double-check each release to confirm we concur, and in some cases compare substitute
language. Sheehy asked why we would object to such a thing as the acknowledgment of Tokyo Station, and seemed
impressed and persuaded when Wickham patiently explained that both the Japanese and Ambassador Mondale have strongly
recommended against confirming the existence of the Station. The Japanese are very sensitive to any public
acknowledgment of our liaison relationship. Wickham noted that the Board is trying to document Oswald's travels, and wants
to identify stations reporting such travel. Pereira said that we recognize the need to report the facts, but want to protect details

that do not add to the story but harm our equities. In response to a Healey question, Pereira said we are making progress in
giving the Board staff the context and framework necessary to appreciate and support our concerns. He said the staff tries
very hard to give the Board necessary background, and Wickham seconded Pereira's assessment that we have a very good
working relationship with the staff. Under the provisions of the Act, the Board will be working until October 1997, dealing with
CIA, FBI, DepState, as well as private individuals and even foreign governments. They are interviewing people, and as
Pereira noted, "getting theories." (S)
4. Staff, even those who asked pointed questions like Healey and Sheehy, seemed satisfied. Majority Staffer Eberwein,
perhaps reflecting concerns voiced by Deputy Majority Director Dupart about protecting Agency sources and methods,
however, expressed concern later about possibly amending the '92 act to moderate the act's bias toward release. Indeed, she
contacted OCA lawyer Cindy Ellis and asked her to draft language amending the act. It had not been my impression during
the briefing that staff had been especially concerned about the act to the point of intending to modify it, and its also unclear
whether Eberwein was acting on behalf of senior majority staff or the membership in asking OCA to suggest modifications to
the act. (S)

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
Following a telephone conversation with HPSCI staff in which
HRG/CSI noted a number of JFK assassination declassification
issues (see OCA C/96-05672 of 27 Mar 96,) CSI, DO, and OGC
briefed staff on the status of the JFK declassification
effort, the 1992 law which established the JFK Assassination
Records Review Board and the scope of the Board's authority,
and the details of some current declassification issues we
have been addressing with the Board. We noted the close
working relationship between the Agency and the Board, and
said that the Board staff is trying to understand the
Agency's equities and perspectives. Some staff expressed
concern about the Board's broad powers and authorities under
the 1992 law, particularly regarding declassification of
intelligence material
