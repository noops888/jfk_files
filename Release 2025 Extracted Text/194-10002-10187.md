Approad For Sosilas

ATTENTION ALL MILITARY PERSONNEL

You may soon be sent to Vietnam.

You have heard about the war in the news;

your officers will give you pep talks about it. But you probably feel as confused and

uncertain as most Americans do. Many people will tell you to just follow orders

and leave the thinking to others.

But you have the right to know as much about this

war as anyone. After all, it's you— not your congressman-who might get killed.

WHY ARE WE FIGHTING IN VIETNAM?

We are supposed to be fighting to protect

democracy in Vietnam, and yet our own gov-:

ernment admits that South Vietnam is run by

a dictatorship. General Ky, the latest mili-

ary dictator, is as bad as they come.

In a

recent interview he said:

"People ask me

who my heroes are.

I have only one -- Hit-

I admire Hitler because he pulled his

country together when it was in a terrible

state." (London Sunday Mirror, July 4, 1965).

General Ky doesn't mean muchto us; we're

not even sure how to pronounce his name,

but

the South Vietnamese have lived under men

like him for years. As far as the Vietnamese

are concerned,

we are fighting on the side of

Hitlerism; and they hope we lose.

'WHO IS THE ENEMY?

U.S. military spokesmen have often said

that their greatest problem is finding the ene-

my.

The enemy,

they say,

is everywhere.

The old woman feeding her chickens may have

a stock of hand grenades in her hut.

The lit-

tle boy who trails after the American sol-

diers during the day slips out to give informa-

tion to the guerillas at night.

The washer-

woman at the American air base brings a bomb

to work one day. It is impossible,

military, to tell which are the Viet Cong and

which are the civilians.

And so, because the whole Vietnamese peo-

ple seem to be the enemy, the military is

taking no chances. They use tear gas -- a

weapon designed for use against civilians.

They order American troops to fire at women

and children -- because women and children,

after all, are firing at American troops. Am-

ericanfighter planes destroy civilian villages

with napalm; American B- 52's are flattening

whole regions. That is why the war in Viet- -

nam is so often called a "dirty war."

When the South Vietnamese people see you

in your foreign uniform, they'gill think of

2's

27

All Previous Editions Obsolete

you as their enemy. You are the ones bomb

ing their towns.

They

don't know whether

you're a draftee or a volunteer,

whether

you're for the war or against it; but they're

not taking any chances either.

FREE ELECTIONS

The Vietnamese would like to vote the for-

eigners out of their country, but they have

been denied the chance.

According to the

Geneva Agreement of 1954, there were sup-

posed to be elections throughout Vietnam in

1956. But the U.S, government was certain

that our man in Vietnam, Premier Diem,

would lose.

So we decided not to allow any

election until we were sure we could win.

Diem set up a political police force and put

all political opposition -- Communist and

anti-Communist -- in jail. By 1959, it was

clear there weren't going to be any elections,

and the guerillas known as the Viet Cong be-

gan to fight back.

By 1963 our government

wasfedup with Diem, but still wasn't willing

to risk elections. Our CIA helped a group of

Vietnamese generals to overthrow Diem and

kill him. Since then there have been a series

of "'better" military dictators. General Ky --

the man who admires Hitler -- is the latest

one.

FIGHTING FOR DEMOCRACY

Your jobas a soldier is suppo' jed to be "to

win the people of South Vietnam." Win them

to what -- democracy? No, we keep military

lictators in power. What then? The Ameri-

can way of life? But why should they care

any more about our way of life than we care

about theirs? We can't speak their language

or even pronounce their names. We don't

know anything about their religion or even

what it is. We never even heard of Vietnam

until Washington decided to run it.

You are supposed to be fighting "to save

the Vietnamese people from Communism."

Certainly Communist influence is very strong

Yet most of the pople support

• people who

now lead the NLF led the Vietnamese inde-

pendence movement against the Japanese dur-

ing World War II, and then went on to fight

against French colonial rule. Most Vietnam-

ese think of the NLF leaders as their coun-

try's outstanding patriots.

Infact, many anti-

Communists have joined the guerrilla forces

in the belief that the most important thing is

to get rid of foreign domination and military

dictators. On the other hand, very few Viet-

namese support the official government of

General Ky.

His army has low morale and a

high desertion rate.

THE GUERRILLAS

The newspapers and television have told

us again and again what a tough fighter the

Vietnamese guerrilla is.

Short of ammuni-

tion and without any air cover, he can beat

forces that outnumber him five or ten to one.

Why do they have such high morale? They

are not draftees; no draftees ever fight like

They are not high-paid, professional

soldiers. Most of them are peasants who work

their fields; they can't even spare the ammu-

nition for target practice.

Their secret is that they know why they

are fighting.. They didn't hear about Vietnam

in the newspapers; they've lived there all their.

lives.

While we were in high school, they

were living under the Diem regime and hating

it.

Now American planes are bombing their

towns and strafing their fields; American

troops have occupied their country; and if

they complain out loud, an American-sup-

ported dictator sentences them to jail or the

firing squad.

•Is it any wonder that they fight

so fiercely?

When a certain on became a center of re-

sistance activity, e followed his orders and

He knew that SS

men were torturing captured resistance fight-

ers, but it wasn't his business to interfere.

FOLLOWING ORDERS

As a soldier you have been trained to obey

but as a human being you must take

responsibility for your own acts. Interna-

tional and American law recognize that an in-

dividual soldier, even if acting under orders,

must bear final legal and moral responsibility

for what he does.

This principle became a

part of law after World War II, when the Al-

liednations, meeting in London, decided that

German war criminals must be punished even

if they committed war crimes under orders.

This principle was the basis of the Nurem-

berg trials. We believe that the entire war

in Vietnam is criminal and immoral. We be-

OPPOSE THE WAR

We hope that you too find yourself, as a

human being, unable to tolerate this night-

mare war,

and we hope that you will oppose

it.

We don't know what kind of risks we are

taking in giving you this leaflet; you won't

A growing number of GIs have al-

been court-martialed. They have shown great

courage.

We believe that they, together with

other courageous men who will join them, will

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE

The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York Times'.

newspaper contained a

full-page advertisement captioned

'What Is Really Happening in Cuba," placed by the fair Play

for Cuba Committee (FPCC) .

This advertisement announced

the formation of the EPCC in New York City and declared the

FPCC intended to promulgate "the truth about revolutionary

Cuba" to neutralize the distorted American press.

"The New York Times". edition of January 11, 1961,

reponted that at a hearing conducted before the United States

Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on January 10, 1951,

Dr. CHARLES A. SANTOS-BUCH identified himself and ROBERT TABER

as organizers of the FPCC. He also testified he and TABER

obtained funds from the Cuban Government which

were applied

toward the cost of the aforementioned advertisement.

On May 15, 1963, a source advised that during the

first two years of the FPCC's existence

there was a struggle

between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers Party (SWP)

elements to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby

influence FPCC policy. This source added that during the

past year there had been a successful effort by FPCC leadership

to minimize the role of these and other organizations in the

EPCC so that their influence as of May, 1963, was negligible.

The SWP has been designated by the Attorney

General of the United States pursuant to

Executive Order 10450.

May 20, 1963, a second source advised that

VINCENT "TED" LEE, FPCC National Office Director, was then

formulating FPCC policy and had indicated that he had no

intention of permitting FPCC policy to be determined by any .

other organization.

This source stated that lEE believed

• that the FPCe should advocate resumption of diplomatic

relations between Cuba and the United

States and should

support the right of Cubans to manage their revolution

without

interference from other nations.

LEE did not advocate

supporting the Cuban revolution

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE (cont'a.)

The November 23, 1963, edition of "The New York

Times" reported that Senator THOMAS J. DODD of Connecticut

had called FPCC "the chief public relations instrument of

the Castro network in the United States."

It is to be noted

that Senator DODD was

of the Senate Internal

Security Subcommittee which twice conducted hearings on the

FPCC.

The December

27, 1963, edition of "The New York

World Telegram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-castro

EPCC was seeking

to go out of business and that its prime

activity during its lifetime had been sponsorship of pro-

Castro street rallies and

picket lines,

and.

the direction

of an active propaganda mill highlighting illegal travel-to-

Cuba campaigns.

Its comparatively brief span of life was

attributed to mounting anti-Castro American public opinion,

the 1962 Congressional hearings which disclosed FPCC financing

by Castro's United Nations Delegation, and ultimately, the

bad publicity which the FPCC received

from disclosure of

activities on its behalf by suspected Presidential assassin

LEE H. OSWALD.

second source advised that V. I. LIE had recently remarked

that the FPCC was dead and that there were no plans to

organize another similar organization.

On April 13, 1964, a third source advised that

there had not been any

FPCC

activity in many months and that

the

FPCC had been

dissolved.

national Harxist-criented youth organization which would hunt

For the most peaceful transition to socialism. The delegates

that the founding convention

was adopted.

Approximately 500 delegates from throughout the United States

attended this corvention.

this organization, as set

forth in the preamble to the constitution, are,

"It is our

belief that this nation can best solve its problems in an

atmosphere of peacerul. coexistence, complete disarmament and true

freedom for all

peoples as the world,

and that these solutions

will be reached mainly through the united efforts of all democratic

elements in our country, composed essentially of the workino people

allied in the unity of Negroes and other minorities with whites.

We further fully recognize that the greatest threat to American

democracy comes

from the racist and right winy forces in

coalition with the most reactionary sections of the economic power

structure, using the tool of anti-Communism to divide and destroy

the unified struggle of the working neodle.

As young Deodle in

the forces struggling for democracy, we shall actively strive to.

defeat these reactionary and neo-fascist elements and to achieve

complete

freedom

and democracy

for all Americans, thus enabling

each individual

to freely choose and build the society he would

to live in.

Through these struggles we

feel the American

people will realize the viability of the socialist alternative."

Ha11, New York, New York, a merger occurred between the Young

People's Socialist League (YPSL) and the Socialist Youth League

the YPSL merged with the SYL to form the

YSL. He explained that

the YPSL did not merge with anyone; that it continued to exist as

the youth section of the socialist Party. He explained that a

small group of

the ypsI was dropped, expelled, or suspended from

that organization and joined the SYL, which he characterized as the

youth group of the

"Trotskyite ISL."

few former members of the YPSI joined the SYl, the syl then pro-

ceeded to change its name for Its own purposes.

On AprIl 9, 1956, a source advised as follows: The YSL

has frequently worked in close sympathetic cooperation with the

ISL toward similar objectives, although each major issue given

mutual consideration

1s decided upon by these organizations

individuaally.

The YSI serves as an apprenticeship for the ISL,

but the ISI selection of members from YSL ranks is made onan

Individual and personal basis.

In many instances YSL members are

also members of

the ISL. The

Yst and the IsI utilize the same

printing house in New York city and the Ist publication is printed

as an insert in "Labor Action.'

Frequently, lecturers before the

YSL are ISL members.

Challenge," which appeared as page five of "Labor Action," contain-

ed an undated statement from the National Committee of the YSL

which indicated that the YSL had been dissolved.

The YPSI 1s publicly known as the youth affiliate of the

Socialist Party - Social Democratic Federation.

Calffornia, unit of the ySL was formed in

1954, following the unity

convention held in New York in February 1954, which combined the

forces of the syL and the YPSL.

in the San Francisco Bay Area continued to operate under the

leadership and guidanced ISI members.
