SUBJECT: Court Foster Wood

3

Michael Weimer Stratton has recently advised that Court s

roster Wood was a relatively close high school friend of Stratton.

during mutual

attendance at George-Mason High School, Falls Church,

Virginia, during 1957 to 1959. [Stratton described Wood as an

average high school student who had no particular problems with

the exception that there were domestic difficulties between the

father and mother of Wood.

Stratton became acquainted with the parents of Wood and made

occasional visits to their home during the above period of time.

The father of Wood, Foster Wood, is an attorney who was then living

in Falls Church.

Some time ago the father and mother of Court Wood

split up and Court Wood and father moved into an apartment on

Columbia Road, Washington, D.C.

Stratton advised that after graduation from high school in

June 1959 he lost any close contact with Wood who then started to

attend George Mason College, where he seemed to have an

interest

in philosophy. Stratton; started to attend a military school and

Wood expressed extreme opposition to military

schools.

3

Stratton married in 1960, which also helped to move stratton

somewhat out of the social circle of Wood. S Stratton believed thai

for approximately a year, during 1959 to 1960, which he did tually

see Wood but advised that after this period in

see Wood he has had a number of contacts with wood, many of which

occurred during mutual attendance at the University of Virginia

Extension School (night school) in early 1961. On one occasion

3 [Stratton attended a party at the apartment occupied by Wood and

father at the invitation of Wood, and on this occasion came into

contact with the "new set of friends" of Court Wood, whom Stratton s

described as being

"beatnik types."

Girls in attendance at the

party, according to Stratton, appeared to be of the "street pickup"

type.

3

After the above party Wood occasionally telephoned [strattonS

and about Christmas 1960 Wood called and stated that he was going

under the auspices of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.

3 Stratton calied on wood after the return of wood from Cuba and

that time Wood lauded Castro very highly. The father of Wood was

also present and Stratton obtained the impression that the father

vas also in sympathy with Castro. 3(Stratton recalled that he again,

at a later date, had visited the Wood apartment, this being an
