1. Referent B forwards an analysis of possible Agency involvement

with suspected criminal elements in the Bahamas. Referent A is a commentary

on this analysis that details CCS relationships with individuals associated

with a company that is reputed to be an employer of organized crime

figures. No specific fact is presented that would legally raise the suspicion

of the commission of a violation of law, morality or ethics by the U.s.

citizen businessmen now cooperating with this Agency: Major General

William P. Fisher (USAF-Ret.); Mr. John P. Roulett (USN-Ret.); and

• Mr. Albert Whisnant.

2. In the sensitivity of this time, it would be imprudent not to

' recognize that mere proximity to unsavory elements is sufficient for some

to suggest guilt by association. This Agency recognizing that unfortunate

fact of life has an obligation to protect the rights of those upon whom we

have prevailed to cooperate. The only direct method immediately, apparent

is to sever our relationship with voiced gratitude for past services in the

national interest. The timing proposed by C/CCS in referent A appears

appropriate.

3. It should be noted that General Fisher's son is aDDO case offce)".

That lact dictates that every effort be made- to contain the substance of this

and referent memoranda to the narrowest possible audience to preclude

unwarranted acrimony and suspicion until proof positive of evil or criminal

activity is certain, which event is extremely doubtful.
