1. An Operational Approval is requested for LITAMIL9,

reluctance to interview a Mexican officer who alleged in

1959 that LITAUIL-9 was a Corzunist, since this course of

action would unnecessarily dra attention of this officer

to our interest in LITAJIL-9.

Will has concurred in this

decision, and considers that this unevaluated derogatory

1==o==-t10= == LITANTED 10 5ar sutredohed by tis Fendez

mance record.

2.

Realizing the risk insolved in working with any

Cuban national, WH/l feels that LITANIL-9's excellent record

of cooperation, plus his acceptance of the idea of continued

cooperation in a denied area favor consideration of an

Operational Approval.

Additionally, we have had audio

coverage through the telephone in LITANIL-g's office for

the past two yeals or more, and during this time the Station

has used the installation for spot checking his information,

and is satisfied that there are no reasons to question his

veracity and security or suspect that he is under control

of the Cuban service.

Attached for your reviey are several contact

reports of LITAMIL-9,

as requested by dir. Lally.

prompt return will be appreciated.

This office will be

pleased to cooperate in any further review of this case

which will facilitate the OA.

1.

wring 21-26 February 1963, Andrey S. PARKERS

travalled frou Headquarters to Mexico City on TDY to train

LITALIL-9

on various clandestina, operational, techniques,

Including SW.

Upon arrival in Mexico City PARYERS ascertained

that LITAMlL-9 allegedly became of noral imbibitions, vas

unvilling to receive tralning and also untilling to accept the

Sk systues Headquarters had issued for his,

and which PARKERS

had carried to bexico city.

Nevertheless, PARERS not LiTAill-g

The first neeting was held at the Station case

Genarally LITAMIL? clained that he 18 very nervous, and

Incapable of performing clandestine tasks mithout having a

nervous breakdown and

at the san. time getting hingall cauybt

in the act because of his general incompetaucy.

AlBO, LITANTI-!

vas planning to stay at its brothers home in Cuba, and felt

1t rould be unethical and isnoral for hin to be conmunicating

clandestinely pith KUBARK while accepting the hospitality of

big brother and sister-in-lar who are staunch supporters of the

Castro rcaine.

Thesa szreements obvloualy had already been

prosented to

the Case Officer who had already concluded that

LITAHIL-9 could not ve moved fron his position.

The agent

furthersore,

felt that there was no need for tralning or 5t

alnce he would be returning to lexico after only three monthe

In Cuba. He displayed a cable he had just receivod Iron his

•Rathor answering LItahIL-g's query as to what might bo bis

next assigament.

The cable stated that LIIAMlL-9 would sast

11kely return to his present

post in Mexico. The agent tEre

fore felt that upon his return to Mexico City, he could ba

debriafod

LITAMIL-9 rejected all attempte

to convince him of our nood for current into Iron Insida Cuba.

1a charge.

6.

Based upon their three meetings, PARKERS formed

the follorinz opinions of LITAXIL-9:

lie 18 a shrand oppor-

tunist, villia to colloborate with KUBARY against the Castro

Goveranent, but not to the point there his personal security

7.

Although at first appearance, and

according to

b1s orn opinion statemeats, LITAMIL-9 anpears to be extrenoly

norvous because of his clandestine activities 1n behall of

KUBARK and agains: Cuba, after gone discussion 1t vas apparont

that he actually relishes these clandestine actions that ho

would have angaged in then long before he did,

and that he

would have continued a covert relationghip vith KUBAil even alter

serving either In Mexico (uber? he tas 123y

(since he can perform only those clandesting tasks

or induced to do

8.

Actually,

PARMERS feels that LITAMIL-9 rould

establish some control over him. Hla preseat remarka concerning

his soral qualie are artillelal. He has great appreciation

with his present TUBARX case officer.

9.

da Bunnry, although LITAMIl-9 did not accept

tralning or SW

1n the standard sense,

PARKERS believes that the

agenta reluctance nas based on his dealre to teke 1au rieks.

The agent in competent, his moral inhibitioas are probably

faxed.

He 18 convinced that he will ratura to Merico soon, and

desires to continue serviaz KUBARK iI nO greater sisk 18 in-
