Regarding your request contained in referenced communication

for the Burean to locate and furnish certain documents, it is my under-

IS

standing that you are in possession of the documents requested.

HEREIN

DATE

In response to your request that we turnish our observations

concerning the making of the documents avallable to former Assistant

Attorney General John Doar, may I suggest that this raises an issue

which has been discussed in the past by the Bureau and the Department

-and other Goverament agencies.

This issue to my knowledge has not

been resolved. That issue is whether & former employee should be

MAILED 6

allowed access to documents in the Government's possession to refresh

his recollection for possible testimony before the Senate Select Committee.

It la this Euronu's position that such documents should not be made

atallable for the aforementioned purpose, and in those instances where

a former employee camot respond accurately to the question of the jenate

Select Committee or any other Congressional Investigative body, the

Committee or Congressional body can be referred to the appropriate

bareau or agency which will, il appropriate, furnish the necessary

information. I am sure you will understand our concern in this regard

Coordination

DAG Inquiry Re Communication by Former AAG Doar.._

to FBI Regarding Mississippi. Freedom Democratic

Party Delegation

(1) The DAG has asked me to request that the Bureau make

a Ille check to determine what, If any, documents may be round

in FBI files relating to a request made by Mr. Doar in August

1964 for information and Bureau action regarding members of the

subject delegation. It is our understanding that Mr. Doar

requested certain information from the FBI regarding this dele-

gation in mid-August 1964; and that some information was delivered

to the DOJ (either to Mr. Doar or then DAG Katzenbach) shortly

thereafter, in the latter part of August 1964.

(2) It is possible that Mr. Doar may be asked about these

matters in connection with the Senate Select Committee inquiry

(reference Appendix D, Item 7, 5/14/75 SSC request). The DAG

has also asked that, after such documentation as may be developed

under (1) above has been located, the Bureau furnish to him its

view as to the access/delivery to Mr. Doar of such documentation

for the purpose of refreshing his recollection.

(3) An expeditious response to this request will be

appreciated.

the SSC requested certain information and documents from

the FBI.

Appendix C, Item number 10, requested all memoranda

and other materials relating to the elimination of the Liaison

Section of the FBI in 1970 and its reestablishment in late

1972.

Among the enclosures to our letter to the Attorney

dated 6/13/75, being proposed for forwarding

to the Committee is E. S. Miller memorandum to Mr. Felt,

7/14/72. On page 2 there is information that "our close

association with the Chief Postal Inspector and his top

officials has resulted in that agency providing support in

some of our most delicate intelligence operations looking

to the identification of illegal hostile intelligence

activities in this country." This could possibly be construed

to include opening of mail. It is to be noted that opening

of mail by FBI is the subject of a separate SSC request and

future correspondence with the SSC, through the AG, will

address itself to this subject. Former Chief Postal Inspector

Henry B. Montague, with whom we have had extensive dealings

in the past, is scheduled to appear before the tult soc on

6/12/75 and it is expected that he will be questioned about

possible FBI participation in mail openings.

the possibility of Elliff and members of his task force,

conducting the inquiry into the FBI, having lunch with the

would be very beneficial and indicated that he and four or

It would appear that such an arrangement might be

beneficial and consideration should be given to arranging a

luncheon if the Director's schedule permits.

That the luncheon be arranged in line with the above

at a time convenient to the Director.

investigation by the SSC which relate to the FBI as well as to

the Department of Justice.

The latest request which is identified as a draft

is broken down into three sections identified as: I. Issues,

II. Areas of General Inquiry, and III. Case Studies.

The SSC's inquiry into the intelligence and counter-,

intelligence activities of the FBI is designed to examine

fundamental issues which bear directly on the adequacy of

current legislation and administrative organization and procedure.

As a means of examining the issues in the context of actual FBI

intelligence operations, the Committee intends to study certain

specific topics, some of which are general in nature and others

of which involve specific cases, programs or techniques.

The

specific issues are set out in

the attachment under section

•Dear Mr. Attorney General:

Enclosed with this letter are notifications concerning

certain matters currently under investigation by. the Select

Committee which relate to government entities under your

jurisdiction.

These notifications are submitted pursuant to an

the Committee, the various intelligence

entities, and the Whité House.

Pursuant to that agreement,

cho various entities in tho Fiecutive Branch have agreed not

only to make avallable the pertinent witnesses,

but also to

subnit in response all information and material which they

possess

that is relevant to the

areas and cases which the

Committee wishes to investigate.

The response should include

all relevant underlying documentation and other information,

including documents which may not have come to the Committee's

attention and which the Comnittee has not specifically requestes,

ana all material relating to any prior Executive Branch inquiry

into the matter. In addition, we would welcome a current

analysis of the particular questions raised by the Committee

and

any other observations on the subject that you believe

would be helpful.

:.. :

We welcome the promine of cooperation and full dis-

closure that underlies that agreement.

Success in fulfilling

the full disclosure policy contained

the agreement is

Indispensible to the Committee's analysis and to the formulation

of our ultimate findings,

conclusions, and recommendations.

Within the Committee mandate, contained In S. Res. 21,

course, welcome your suggestion of other cases that would

give added insight into intelligence matters under your

jurisdiction.) These specific subjects for investigation

are not intended to limit the scope contained in the more

A.

Legal Authority for FBI Intelligence and Counter-

intelligence Activities

The Committee 1s examining the legal basis for FBI

intelligence and counterintelligence activities.

There may be serious question as to the adequacy

of the present legislative framework for the FBI's

functions in these fields.

Current statutes

authorize the FBI to perform investigative and law

enforcement functions, but they do not specifically

authorize intelligence or counterintelligence

activities.

Therefore, the Committee seeks to

determine whether the FBI's authority should be

clarified, revised, or incorporated in a compre-

hensive statutory charter.

B: Organization ana Queration uf the FBI Intelli

gence Division

The Committee is investigating the structure and

operating practices of the FBI Intelligence Divi-

sion.

Proposals have been made that the national

security intelligence and counterintelligence

functions of the FBI should be lodged in a

agency or othèrwise separated from the FBI's

criminal investigative activities.

mendations have been advanced for improved coordina-

tion between the FBI and other intelligence agencies,

for strengthened supervision of FBI intelligence and.

counterintolligones activitios by the Attorney

General of an independent boara, and for clearer

standards and procedures for FBI activities in this

area:

Therefore, the Committee desires complete

information on the operating practices ana proce-

dures of the FBI Intelligence Division and of the

field office activities supervised by the Intelli

gence Division.

specific areas:

The Committee seeks to determine the nature

and purpose of FBI intelligence operations

directed at foreign intelligence activities

and subversive or extremist activities within

the United States.

It has been alleged that

the scope of FBI

intelligence investigations

is too broad and has extended to legitimate

political activities..

Consequently, the Com-

mittee must examine how the FBI's responsibili-

ties have been defined.

The FBI and the U.S. Intelligence Community

The Committee seeks to determine what have

been the policies and procedures for coordina-

tion between the FBI and other agencies in the

U. S. intelligence community.

There have

been

occasions in the past where friction between

the FBI and other

agencies has produced serious

dissatisfaction within the U. S. intelligence

community.

The purpose of this inquiry is to

evaluate the adequacy of past and present co-

ordinating mechanisms.

Electronic Surveillance

The Committee is examining all forms of electronic

interception of communications including wiretap-

ping, electzonic eavesdropping, consensual elec-

tronic surveillance interception of video and data

communications, local monitoring devices, and all

other lorms oi

electronic or technical monitoring.

The Committce's general questions apply to each of

the techniques listed above, as well as to the

• matters

set forth in the following specific cases.

1.

Warrantless Electronic Surveillance

The Committee seeks to determine whether the

Attorney General should have the authority

to authorize electronic surveillance for cer-

tain purposes without a prior judicial warrant.

This power has been exercised by succeeding

Attorneys General since 1940, upon the explicit

directive of the President.

The Supreme Court

has ruled that this power does not extend to

purely domesic natters, sut the remaining scope

of the Attorney General's authority remains un-

defined by the supreme court:

Questions

The Committee requests that the FBI and the

Justice Department address the following specific

questions:

?.

What is the scope and basis of the claim

of Executive authority to conduct warrant-

less electronio surveillance?

b.

What have been the procedures for considera-

tion and approval of requests for warrantless

electronic surveillance authorized by the

Attorney General?

C.

What are the specific disadvantages of the

judicial warrant requirement for those

electronic surveillances which have been

authorized by the Attorney General?

Warrantless Electronic Surveillance and

"Leaks "

The Committee is examining several instances.of

the use of warrantless electronic surveillance

and other investigative techniques in connection

with "leaks" of classified information. These

cases may involve specific allegations of abuse

or other controversial matters where there is

reason to believe. improprieties may nave

occurred. These instances include:

a.

The investigation of alleged "leaks" by or .

to 17 Executive officials and newsmen

between May 1969 and February 1971.

b. The Investigation of alleged "leaks" from

a

Clandestine Informant Activities

The Committee is examining all aspects of the

FBI's use of informants, sources, and undercover

• personnel

and the techniques employed by such per-

sons.

Although informants are the single most

productive source of intelligence information, the

difficulties

of controlling their activities

may

increase the possibility of improper conduct. The

use of informants to infiltrate organizations also

may pose dangers to the right of associational pri-

vacy.

Consequently, proposals have been made for

the imposition of a judicial warrant requirement

or other safeguards for the use of informants.

The Committee seeks to evaluate such proposals as

well as the contributions of informants to the

accomplishment of legitimate objectives.

In addition, the Committee is examining informant

activities with respect to several particular situa-

tions and cases.

Angleton recently testified under oath before three

Senators and Staff Members of the Senate Select Committee (SSC).

He appeared without counsel. During his testimony, Angleton

was asked numerous questions concerning his knowledge of

Israeli capabilities to conduct intelligence collection in the

United States. Among the questions asked Angleton were questions

bearing on Israeli efforts to gather nuclear information in

the United States.

Angleton indicated that the SSC apparently

is aware of Angleton's past close relationship with the Israelis,

and Angleton feels that the questions directed to him by the

SSC may be related to

information provided to the Committee by

correspondent Tad Szulc who, according to Angleton, is writing

for Penthouse Magazine. Angleton understands that Szulc has

area, Angleton replied that he did not know but that he believed

the current senior Bureau official concerned with operational

matters to be Deputy Associate Director James B. Adams. (Ck) Ju

In addition, Angleton advised that certain questions

he was asked dealt with alleged Soviet attempts to infiltrate

the CIA and other agencies.

Again, Angleton avoided a direct

answer and indicated that the FBI would be the appropriate

agency to direct such questions to. Finally, Angleton commented

that in the event the Bureau thought it desirable he would be

happy to personally brief the Director or other appropriate

Bureau official concerning his testimony. He commented that

he has not been asked to, nor has he offered to, brief William

Colby, Director of Central Intelligence, concerning his testimony:

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. We are checking for any available information

in files concerning Israeli intelligence collection capabilities

in the United states. Results will be summarized in separate

memorandum.

2. It is not believed appropriate to request

Angleton to brief the Director or other Bureau official

concerning his testimony, particularly since Angleton has

not seen fit to brief his former superiors at CIA. A request

by the Bureau for a briefing by Angleton might be misconstrued

if it were to come to the attention of Colby or other CIA

ontire period of time of the Schafers relationship with the

FBI and it they wore still associnted with the Bureau.

Ix. Schafer told Mr. Epstein that he was not going to anit

any associntion with the TBI at tils point and the reply seemed

to croatly upset fir. Ipstein.

Ho askod the Schafers why they

had come to Washington, D. C. The ichafers replied they

wanted to establish some groundwork for any relationship with

the Conute Committce. My. Ipstein attempted to have the

Schafcrs relate their activities in behalt o1 the FBI.

Ir, Schafer advised they refused to comply due to iir. Dostoin's

manner and presentation. The Schafers stated they receivod

the detinite impression

that ix. Epstein and his colleagues

expected to hear an afternoon of interesting stories and

anecdotes.

Mrs. Schafer told Mr. Ipstein that they had done

nothing wrong, illegal, immoral or unethical in their

"novoment" activities and they were proud of thoir contributions

The Schafers related ther

enjoyed a happy relationship vith

nothing questionablo or unproîcsaional rogarding the Pureau's

handling of thoir information.

The Schators said they nade

it clear

that thoy yould bo happy to tell the SSC these

According to

the schafers, the necting broke up rather abruptly and

NOTE:

Several personal statements made by the Schafers, such as

"bearded hippy" in reference to one of Epstein's colleagues,

were not included in the LiM as this type of information

is not fully germane and our reporting of it might be

inferred as our being prejudicial.

Legal Counsel to Adams, Memo

Re: SENSTUDY 75

We have prepared an airtel to San Francisco with an

enclosed letter for Mr. Todd in response to his request.

are having the San Francisco Office hand deliver the letter

so that any questions he may have can be answered.

We have not regarded requests for interviews as

"demands" within the meaning of 28 CFR 16.22; therefore, no

release from the Department is necessary.

Regarding his request for access to Bureau files,

we have not had former employees make this request previously.

Our position should be that they not have access but rather

rely on their recollection.

If they cannot answer a specific

question, the Committee can

be referred to the Bureau.

RECOMMENDATION:

Attached Airtel with enclosed letter to Mr. Todd

be approved and sent.

inst

Dear Mr. Kelley:

On this date Supervisor Berryman of the San Fran-

cisco Office read to me a teletype to the effect the Bureau

approved a secrecy release for me to respond to questions

from Senate Investigator Lester B. Seidel in connection with

a Senate Select Committee on Internal Security Investigation

of the cointelpro as it related to the Black Panther Party.

A copy of a letter from me to Mr. Seidel has been furnished

to the Bureau previously:

At the time I was designated supervisor of the 'squad

handling internal security investigations of the Black Panther

Party (BPP), the BPP was international in scope; Eldridge

Cleaver and

others had been granted asylum in Algeria; the

BPP had support and/or branches in France, Germany, Scandinavia

and China.

Aspects of the counter intelligence program

approved by the Bureau of which I am aware were directed against

SOme BPP foreign operations.

Thus, interrogation by the Senate

investigator may involve information disseminated to other

ALL INFORMATION CONTAIN

government agencies under security classification and may

touch on foreign policy as well.

LARSIN

Y

Therefore, prior to furnishing information obtained

in an official capacity to Mr. Seidel, who according to the

Bureau's teletype will be in San Francisco in about two weeks,

I would like written confirmation of the release which was

furnished me orally, preferably an official document covering

any secrecy agreement made with the Bureau as well as releasing

HEREI

me from the provisions of any applicable executive orders which

DATE

preclude disclosure of official information without approval of

the Attorney General or an authorized Departmental officer.

I would also appreciate being advised 1f there is any limitation

on the scope of the material which I may release.

Since the Bureau's teletype also approved a secrecy

release for current SAC Charles Bates, this presupposes he

will be authorized to furnich Mr. Seidel with the contents of

files 1f Mr. Seidel so requests.

Therefore, I would also

appreciate advice as to whether I will be permitted to refresh

my recollection by reviewing official files prior to or during

the interview with Mr. Seidel.

Sincerely yours,

PURPOSE:

To advise that representatives of Intelligence

Division this date reviewed 693-page CIA document containing

information relating to joint ventures involving CIA and

other members of intelligence community in sensitive matters,

and a specific request has been made for CIA to furnish this

Bureau with copies of all material contained therein believed

to have a bearing on FBI activities.

DETAILS:

3

By memorandum 6/24/75 you were advised that

arrangements had been effected whereby a CIA representative

would on 6/25/75 bring to FBIHQ a copy of the 693-page document

containing a series of memoranda and reports prepared by CIA

citing instances wherein CIA may have engaged in activities

outside the perimeter of its charter. As you have been advised,

members of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) have had prior

access to this document and it contains numerous references

to FBI-CIA joint ventures, some of which are of an extremely

sensitive nature. CIA Director William Colby authorized a

review of this document and agreed to this Bureau obtaining

a copy of material contained therein believed pertinent to

this Bureau's operations.

packages were reviewed by Section Chief William O. Cregar

and Special Agents Leon F. Schwartz and Thomas J. McNiff

in Room 4123 JEH.

Material contained therein runs the entire gambit

from CIA cooperation, and in some instances financing of

Bureau sensitive operations in foreign intelligence field,

to CIA involvement in domestic affairs including cooperation

with police departments and other Federal agencies. In all,

it was determined that approximately 174 pages of the document

contain information which in some respect has a bearing on

this Bureau's operations.

Pertinent page numbers were identified to

Mrs. Mowitt and she is taking this Bureau's request for these

pages back to CIA Headquarters for the purpose of obtaining

authorization to furnish this Bureau with copies of the

pages in which this Bureau is interested. Mrs. Mowitt

advised that she would insure our request in this respect

received expeditious attention and she will furnish us with

the results at the earliest time.

Attached is a FD 302 reporting a conversation

SA Paul V. Daly had with Mr. Paul Wallach, staff member of

United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence

Activities.

The gist of the conversation is that Mr. Wallach

informed SA Daly that he had a list of national security

mait covers which cover the last five years and that he would

use this list for committee business including for interview

purposes if the Bureau did not promptly comply with the Committee's

request for a list of mail covers.

The contents of the attached FD 302, were orally turmished

on 6-18-75 to Deputy Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination,

Michael Shaheen of the Department.

Mr. Shaheen and Mr. O'Connor,

Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, contacted

F. A. 0. Schwartz, Chief Counsel to the Senate Select Committee,

to protest Mr. Wallach's actions. Mr. Wallach denied, in a

conversation with Mr. O'Connor,

that he had stated he had such

a list to SA Daly. Subsequent to this conversation with

Mr. O'Connor, and on the same day according to Mr. Shaheen,

Wallach called Shaheen and told Shaheen that he wanted to talk

to him off the record, at which point Mr. Wallach stated that

he had access to a list of mail covers through a source of his,

but did not have possession of same.

He also stated that he

may have suggested to SA Daly that he had such a list.

Mr. Shaheen stated that it was obvious that Wallach

could not be trusted and remarked that the Department had been

Keeping book on him. Shaheen informed SA Daly that Wallach

had contacted Mr. Cox, Chief Counsel for the United States Postal

Service, at which time he informed Mr. Cox that the White House

had authorized the release of all national security mail covers,

and requested Cox furnish same to him.

According to Shaheen,

Cox then contacted the White House to determine if Wallach's

story was in fact true, at which time James Wilderotter, Assistant

Counsel to the President, advised that Wallach's name was unfamiliar

to him, and that : he. had

not been given authority to obtain

national security mail covers.

Mr. Shaheen stated he, at the

direction of Mr. O'Connor, was furnishing the Bureau in writing, a

report of his conversations with Wallach and also stated that

O'Connor stated he would no longer have any dealings with Wallach

because of the obvious unethical conduct and lack of honesty on

Wallach's part.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Date of transcription

6-18-75

Mr. Paul Wallach, staff member of the United States Senate

Select Committee on Intelligence Activities, telephonically contacted me on

6-18-75 between 2:30 and 3 o'clock P. M., and inquired as to the status of a

request by the Committee concerning mail cover information. He asked it I

could furnish him a time when he might expect our response to be delivered

to him. He pointed out that he had had previous discussions with me and

Mr. Shaheen of the Department concerning this matter, and Mr. Shaheen

had indicated to him that he could expect the response to have been given to

him by this time. Mr. Wallach was informed that a time certain for

delivery of a response concerning this request could not be given, and it

was explained to him that a vast amount of material was being reviewed

pursuant to request of the Senate Select Committee and other committees of

Congress and that because of the amount of work involved in all these requests

it was not possible to make a judgment as to the date of the response.

Mr. Wallach indicated he felt he had been misled by Mr. Shaheen

into believing that he would have a response to his request and that he was

going to recontact Mr. Shaheen.

He made a general inquiry as to whether one

Agent might be gathering all the information and as to whether he might be

allowed to come to FBI Headquarters and review what has been gathered to

this point. He was informed that all disclosures have to receive proper

Bureau approval and that it would not be possible for him to review such

information in the absence of such approval. He asked if the Bureau could

separate the response by making available immediately portions of the mail

cover lists such as the identities of people who were the targets of mail

covers in the domestic field. He again was informed that this was not

possible in the absence of proper approval. Mr. Wallach stated that he

wanted me to know that he was in possession of a list of Bureau mail covers

for the past five years which he had been furnished by a source whom he did

not identify. He was asked (1) if this list concerned the mail covers in the

national security areas and, (2) was it a national list. Mr. Wallach stated it

was a national list in the national security areas. He stated he was not sure

of its accuracy. He indicated that he would have no reservations about using

the list to conduct the Senate Select Committee business and stated that inter-

views may be conducted based on the list.

He was advised that the list would contain sensitive information

which would seriously impair ongoing Bureau investigations.

He replied that

the names were not classitied, and since they were not classified he would

have no problem in using the list. It was explained to Mr. Wallach that

despite the tact it was not classified the list would be extremely sensitive

since it would impair many ongoing investigations and in many instances the

very fact that we are interested in an individual indicates that we are in

possession of sensitive information concerning that individual. Mr. Wallach

pointed out that if this were the case, acknowledging that he had been informed

previously that one of the reasons for the necessity for closely reviewing the

material to be made available was because of this problem, then the Bureau

should come forward with its own list and point out to him which of the names

are sensitive and which are not. Mr. Wallach stated that only one or two

other people had knowledge of the fact he possessed such a list.

Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B. Adams memorandum 6/6/75

related contact with Legal Counsel Division by former SA Richard H.

Davis who had been contacted by Michael Epstein, Staff Member,

Senate Select Committee (SSC), who desired to interview Davis

in Atlanta, Georgia, concerning the former FBI investigations

of Martin Luther King, J., Stanley David Levison and the

Southern Christian Leadership Confèrence. Davis requested a

Bureau representative be made available for consultation

purposes during the interview and that Davis would contact

FBIHQ as soon as a date and place of interview had been determined.

Approval has already been granted by the Bureau for the release

of Davis from his employment agreement for purpose of the •

interview and you (Mr. Wannall) designated S. F. Phillips of

the Senstudy 75 Project to be the Bureau representative at the

interview.

1/15 Epstin ato that unt.

Phillips took a telephone call this morning from

former SA Alan G. Sentinella (has already been interviewed and

testified before the SSC) who advised that he had been contacted

earlier this morning by Richard Davis. Davis told Sentinella

that Epstein had called him 6/25/75 and made an appointment to

interview Davis in Atlanta (exact site unknown) 2:00 p.m.,

Tuesday, 7/8/75. Davis had first tried to reach Charles Haynes,

a supervisor in the Atlanta Office, on b/25/75 and, being unable

to speak with the Director; that, it he were in his orrice,

such calls. would be transferred to the Director's Office

Mr. Mohr explained in detail

the system of handling tele

phone calls in the Director's office and the functions of

the FBI telephone switchboard.)

It was explained that the file cabinets in my office

contained strictly personal correspondence of the Director;

that from time to time during the past fifty years files

which were no longer current were eliminated,

Re the so-called o.c. files - it was explained that these

...

files were located in one of the locked cabinets; that there

'were, possibly one and a half or two file drawers of these.

in answer to questioning it was explained that on the day

of Mr. Hoover's death I spoke with both Mr. Tolson, who at

that time was Acting Director, and Mr. Mohr, and asked for

instructions as to whom I should deliver the öfficial-

367,

confidential

files and other Bureau material contained in

the Director's offices.

I also advised Mr. Tolson of

" Mr. Hoover's expressed instructions that his personal

correspondence be destroyed, and that he, Mr. Hoover, had

begun a review of these personal files sometime previous to

his death, and some already had been destroyed. Mr. Tolson

instructed that the official-confidential files and all

fun

where the Bureau material was kept and answered that book-

cases in my ofite were used for this purpose.

I was exhaustively questioned by Mr. Epstein

as to whether

I called Mr. Tolson (and where he was located at the time)

or whether Mr. Tolson called me. I told him that at this

late date I had no idea as to who called whom, but that he

was assured that ur. lolson and I communicated. I also was

morning in

of that morning were desired and was told no.)

I explained that instructions were immediately carried out;

the o.c. Files, with the index cards pertaining to them,

together with the above mentioned Bureau material, was placed

in cartons and delivered to Mr. Felt.

I was asked who carried

*these cartons to Mr. Felt's office and said I could not at

this date answer this but I believe they would have been

carried by either messengers or maintenance personnel.

"There was quite much questioning here as to how and where the

index cards were filed. It was explained that they were filed

* in the one index file, cards of a different color being used,

and that this file also was locked.

3.

In connection with the above authorizations it was

explained that as soon as Mr. Gray was named as the

new Director Mr. Felt brought him to the Director's

office to afford him an idea of the office set up;

that Mr. Gray indicated a very special interest in

the files in my office; that their contents were ex-

plained to him and that he was invited to view the

contents.

He did glance thru a drawer and obviously

was satisfied that they contained personal correspondence

anly, and was also satisfied that the Bureau material had

been

delivered to Mr. Felt.

One of the questioners

had been indicated; that a larger number had been given

to Attorney General Levi..I remarked that I would not

ay donoral tent.

after they had been delivered to Mr. Felt. Mr. Gitenstein

certain of the files in question and asked questions re

specific

cases

which were contained in the o.c. files. I

told him

I would not presume, after three years, to try

to remember specifics.

He asked if there were a file

containing reports from the Washington Field Office. I'

told him certainly I would not remamber such a file, 1f

one existed.

To questions regarding the destruction of personal

correspondence files I explained that up until the

time I left the Bureau I continued to tear up and de-

trash, the contents of these files in the "confidential

waste baskets; Mr. Mohr here explained this

that I had asked Mr. Gray 1f, in

order to vacate the office as soon as possible for his

convenience,

I could have his approval to send to

Mr. Hoover's house files which could not be disposed of

before my date of retirement and finish the taskthere.

He did not hesitate to give me this permission. (Mr. Felt,

who was present when I spoke with Mr. Gray (in my office)

suggested that a locked room on the fifth floor, with a

key only I would have, could be made available so the files

would be disposed of without moving.

I said that

would not be necessary and Mr. Gray

agreed. At this point

Mr. Gitenstein asked me if I thought I might not be the

only one with a key.

I asked him what he would have thought

and he smiled and said he would have thought that.

Four: Questions were asked, in further connection with the

set-up of the office and personnel.

The office of the Office Manager (Miss Holmes). Dia she

have file cases in her office.

The answer was "no".

the office of the secretary to the Office Manager (Miss McCord)

Were there files in her orfice and if so what did they contain.

The answer was "yes" and the contents were material necessary

for use by the Office Manager in connection with her super-

Vision of the office personnel, anxmatatakakagathe and

maintainance.

The reception room. The function of the receptionist was

explained.

NW 88326 Docld:32989611 Page 118

4.

The telephone room. Here, again, close questioning re

files kept in this office.

Assurance was given that

the only files kept here were background material necessary

to the functioning of the office.

Questions were asked

if records were made of telephone calls and visitors to

the Director. Information was given that a daily log was

maintained, and it was described. Question was asked re

where and how long the logs were maintained. Answer was

that they were permanently filed in the main Bureau files.

M1L Clerk's (Miss Mooney) office. Were there files here?

Answer was yes, mainly photograph files and also the

scrap books.

The names or Miss Holmes - Mrs. Metcalf - Miss McCord =

Ron Thompson and Miss Mooney were requested and given.

At one point during the sessions in being questioned re the

Director'g being advised of Bureau matters the questioners were

told by both Mr. Mohr and me that Mr. Hoover never was out of

touch with the bureau, day or night, whether in town or out of

town.

wold be used for political purpose, the answer was No - that

I had never found the need to lie about anything.

RE:

MISS GANDY'S QUESTIONING BY SENATE

SELECT COMMITTEE INVESTIGATING

FEDERAL AGENCIES WITH INTELLIGENCE-

GATHERING FUNCT ONS

IVFORMATION CONTANTO

Miss Gandy and I appeared before the staff of the

subcommittee for questioning on May 15, 1975, our appointmen

eing set for 10:30 a.m. The group consisting of Messrs. Gitenstein

Epstein and M. S. Talley immediately proceeded to the former

Carroll Arms Apartment building which is now used as an office

building by the U.S. Senate. We were taken to the sixth floor where

we entered an empty office which contained telephone equipment,

some chairs, and a desk.

Mr. Gitenstein had apparently drawn up a list of

questions he wished to discuss with Miss Gandy and he referred to

this list throughout the questioning period.

There is attached a rough draft memorandum

consisting of four pages and dated May 15, 1975, which was prepared by

Miss Gandy concerning her recollection of what transpired during

the interview. The interview, incidentally, lasted until

1 p.m. when a one-hour break was taken for lunch. The session

reconvened at 2 p.m. and was terminated at 3 p.m.

items which I recaloct transpired during the interview which

I am setting forth hereafter in numbered paragraphs

§ should be helpful in embellishing Miss Gandy's me morandum.

(1) During the early part of the questioning, Mr. Gitenstein

attempted to draw a chart of Mr. Hoover's office in the Department of

Justice building.

He said he had previously visited Mr. Kelley's suite in

the Justice Building. His effort at charting the office was poor at best

and he reque sted my assistance. A rough chart was drawn showing

Mr. Hoover's personal office on one end and Miss Mooney's office on

the other end. In making up the chart I inadvertently left out the supply

room which, of course, would have been of little or no significance to

the questioners since this room contained supplies only and no files.

2-114395-318

NW 88326 Docld:32989611 Page 120

---

## Page 121

(2) Sometime during the interview, Mr. Gitenstein

raised a question about "Expedite Processing" of mail and how it was

handled in Mr. Hoover's office. Miss Gandy pointed out that the

handling of personal and confidential mail for Mr. Hoover was

hustlow this mail won hand she plaCed y, a as me teen contidential

in the Routing Unit of the Records and Communications Division

was taken unopened to Miss Mooney in Mr. Hoover's office where

she opened this mail and the clerical employee who brought the mail

down then logged it in and stamped the mail "Expedite Processing"

on the left-hand edge. Thereafter the clerica employee would take

the log back to the Routing Unit and when the mail was subsequently

returned to the Routing Unit for regular filing purposes the item

would be crossed off the log. Mr. Gitenstein wanted to know

if the "Expedite Processing" logs were maintained permanently and

he was informed that to my knowledge they were not kept after accounting

for the particular items of mail contained on the particular log.

(3) Mr. Epstein gestioned Miss Gandy at length

concerning her title as "Executive Assistant." He wanted to know when

she acquired this title and she said she could not recall. He wanted

to know whether anyone else at the FBI had occupied this position and

Miss Gandy explained that she was the only employee with the

title of Executive Assistant who had served under Mr. Hoover during

his tenure in office. Mr. Epstein seemed to pay a great deal of

attention to the title Executive Assistant and I endeavored to explain

to him that the title was a Civil Service Commission title and that

Miss Gandy's position was set up under the Classification Act administered

by the Civil Service Commission. Although I am not sure what was

behind Mr. Epstein's lengthy questioning about) this matter, I got the

impression he might be trying to find out if Miss Gandy acted for Mr. Hoover

on her own initiative. This is just a guess on my part and I am not sure

what was behind his questioning.

(4) During Miss Gandy's description of the various

offices, she did mention specifically the fact that the interesting case

files were maintained on the shelves in the big conference room in black

folders. They asked what the interesting case files consisted of and I

explained this to their satisfaction; namely, that they were writeups of

closed cases which might be of irt erest for various purposes.

- 2 -

NW 88326 Docld:32989611 Page 121

---

## Page 122

(5) I should mention that Miss Gandy in describing exactly

how Mr. Hoover's personal correspondence files were destroyed said

she reviewed each item that she handled to make sure that it was not

related to Bureau official business. She had previously indicated

that Mrs. Erma Metcalf had assisted her in destroying these files

but she did not mention that Mrs. Metcalf endulged in the same type of review and

Miss Gandy was not questioned whether Mrs. Metcalf had made such a

review as she went through the files and helped destroy them.

(6) Both Mr. Gitenstein and Mr. Epstein queried Miss Gandy

at length about the log kept in the Telephone Room of all calls taken by

Mr. Hoover. They also queried her at length concerning a log that was

kept in the Telephone Room of all visitors to FBI Headquarters who were

seen by Mr. Hoover. Miss Gandy explained that these logs, to her knowledge,

were currently retained in the regular Bureau file room.

(7) Miss Gandy was asked regarding Mr. Hoover's commitments

and she explained that each morning the employees in the Telephone Room

prepared a commitment card of Mr. Hoover's commitments for the day

and this card was placed on Mr. Hoover's desk the first thing in the

morning for his information. Miss Gandy reported that she received a

copy of this commitment card. She was asked whether these commitment

cards were retained permanently and she replied in the negative. Somewhere

along the line it was explained to the interviewers that the Bureau had an

instruction that all items of a temporary nature, such as ticklers and the

• like were to be destroyed after they were 90 days old. Miss Gandy

indicated these commitment cards would have come under this category

for destruction. Miss Gandy was queried at length as to just how the

Telephone Room employees got their information to make up the commitment

card and she explained that all employees in Mr. Hoover's office made

certain the Telephone Room employees were promptly advised of all of

Mr. Hoover's commitments as they were made.

(8) In explaining the telephone set-up in the Department of Justice

building as far as it related to the FBI, the Staff members were informed

that calls for Mr. Hoover were received in the Bur eau's switchboard and

were then referred to the Telephone Room in Mr. Hoover's office and the

employees in the Telephone Room handled the problem of connecting

Mr. Hoover with the caller. They wanted to know whether employees in

the Telephone Room screened Mr. Hoover's telephone calls and they were

informed Telephone Room employees did not screen them except for "nut"

calls.

(9) During a rather heated conversation in the afternoon

about some of the questioning being done which seemed to be repetitious and

NW 88326 Docld:32989611 Page 122

- 3 -

---

## Page 123

irrelevant, Mr. Gitenstein was told by me that I felt it was high time

the questioners quit "beating around the bush" and came to the point by

asking Miss Gandy if she had ever destroyed any official and

confidential files. Mr. Gitenstein replied they had a discrepancy

concerning the O and C files in that a reliable source had reported

that Mr. Mark Felt had five two-drawer cabinets marked "O and C Files"

in his office. Miss Gandy on the other hand told Mr. Gitenstein in

response to a question that she had turned over to Mr. Felt after

Mr. Hoover's death, as she recollected, one and one-half drawersand

possibly two drawers. of O and C files. I explained to Mr. Gitenstein

that Miss Gandy would have no way of knowing what files Mr. Felt had

in his office and if there was a discrepancy the person to resolve the

discrepancy was Mr. Felt who Mr. Gitenstein had told me previously

had been interviewed by him and had been cooperative. I had previously

explained to Mr. Gitenstein in response to que stions he asked me when 1

appeared before the Staff that at the time Mr. William C. Sullivan had

furnished the data of the 17 White House telephone taps to Mr Mardian in

the Internal Security Division of the Department that Mr. Hoover had

instructed that any Assistant Director or Bureau official who had any

files in his office he considered to be confidential and relating to the

Bureau's work were to be immediately transferred to Mr. Felt and

a memorandum prepared concerning exactly what was transferred to

Mr. Felt. I told Mr. Gitenstein I had no idea how many files Mr. Felt

collected as a result of Mr. Hoover's instructions. It is interesting to

note that I was not asked at any time whether I lad turned over any files .

to Mr. Felt in connection with Mr. Hoover's instructions.

(10) Miss Gandy was asked whether there were any files.

Jof Mr. Hoover's personal correspondence in Mr. Hoover's former home

at the present time. Miss Gandy replied no.

11) At some point during the interview a reference was

made to the confidential trash baskets maintained in the Bure au, to wit,

the trash baskets with the painted rim. on top. Mr. Epstein wanted to

know if a log was maintained of items placed in the confidential trash

baskets for destruction. I informed him it wuld be ridiculous to think

that such a log could be maintained and he was advised exactly how

confidential trash is destroyed in the Bureau. He was also informed of

the Bureau files that were scattered over the streets of Southwest Washington

as a result of the Department of Justice engaging in destruction of some of

their files. This reference permitted an immediate termination of any

questions along the lines of the destruction of confidential trash.

= 4-

NW 88326 Docld:32989611 Page 123

## Page 124

(12) Miss Gandy refers to the fact that questions were

raised concerning Mr. Hoover's back door entrance. The questions

concerning this back door were to determine just who used this

back door entrance and its purpose. In addition to explaining it was

immediately adjacent to the elevators at 9th and Pennsylvania Avenue

which Mr. Hoover used to enter and exit the building, they were also

advised that this was Mr. Hoover's private and personal entrance and

that persons wishing to see Mr. Hoover were not brought through this

back door.

The foregoing is submitted for information purposes and

as an auxiliary record of Miss Gandy's appearance before the Staff of the

Senate Select Committee on May 15, 1975, accompanied by me,

John P. Mohr.

He advised that the Deputy Attorney General had requested him to

determine by the morning of 6/10/75 whether the FBI would object to

disclosing the Appendices to the Committee. Subsequently, Mr. O'Connor

sent me a copy of a notehe addressed to the Deputy Attorney General

dated 6/9/75, and its enclosure (a copy of a letter from Senator Church

to the Attorney General dated 6/9/75), both of which pertain to the

Senate Select Committee request to have access to Appendices A through

E of the Petersen report. The letter also requests access to Appendices

K and I for inspection by designated Committee staff at the Department of

Justice (Copies of these two are attached).

"ABF :glw

Intelligence Division strongly feels Exhibits A through E should not

be made available. These constitute work papers prepared on an expedite

basis by Special Agents operating under the understanding their effort was

of a rough draft nature which would be utilized by a committee of the Justice

Department and FBI for an in-house investigation.

The Agents preparing

the documents never conceived that their effort would be subject to review

outside of the Department and particularly outside the Executive Branch.

By letter dated 4/21/75 to the Attorney General it was pointed

out these exhibits related to the internal deliberations of the Department

and FBI representatives, some of the material in these summaries is

classitied and relates to sensitive operations and they should not be revealed.

Also, Deputy Attorney General Lawrence Silberman in testimony before the

Civil Rights and Constitutional Rights Subcommittee (Edwards Committee)

on 11/20/74 indicated as regards these documents, "If we had thought it was

appropriate to release the full discussion we would have done so at the time.

There are a lot of internal working documents which go into the making of a

final report. *

Further, if these documents are released to the SSC, or if the

Cormittee is allowed access to them, we would not then be in a position to

deny access to them by the Edwards Committee or the House Select Committee

on Intelligence (Nedzi). Should they be released and come within the public

domain, we could then be in a position of violating individual rights of privacy

and compromising sensitive investigative techniques and Bureau sources.

We feel we should first go through these work papers and excise such items

The Honorable Edward H. Levi

Washington, D. C. 20530

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

Thank you for your letters of May 17 and May 23,

1975, informing the Select Committee of five additional

COINTELPRO-type operations disclosed by the continuing FBI

review of its counterintelligence files.

The Committee ap-

preciates your candor in disclosing the sensitive aspects of

these programs.

Pursuant to its rules, the Committee will

handle this information with the necessary security..

I have been informed that a member of the Commit-

tee staff has inspected and taken notes on the 39-page

report of the Petersen committee on COINTELPRO.

I believe

that our security arrangements are more than sufficient to

safeguard the confidentiality of its contents.

The Commit-

tee members themselves as well as the staff would be con-

venienced by its availability in our secure facilities.

I believe that it is vitally important for the Com-

mittee to be provided with Appendices A through E of that

report.

These documents will also be handled according to

our stringent security arrangements. In addition, Appendices

K and I should be made available for inspection by designated

Committee staff at the Department of Justice. I understand

that these appendices are not "raw files" of the FBI.

-SUBJECT: COINTELPRO/Petersen Report

On June 4, 1975, Mr. Elliff of SSC reviewed the

39-page Petersen Report.

Afterwards, he had a confer-

ence with me from 4:15 to 4:45.

The

conference resulted

in a nodification of the previous request. I told him

I would be back in touch with him at an appropriate time.

He also indicated a probable future course of action by

the Committee.

The nodification is as follows:

As to Appendices A-E (the summaries prepared by

the FBI of certain COINTELPRO operations) Committee

Mr. Elliff advised that

he

understood that the FBI raw files question was most

sensitive, and that he would propose to have staff of

the Committee review these Exhibits, and, if the infor

mation in these Exhibits was not sufficient for their

purposes, to then request an expanded summary of any

particular topic summarized, without reaching the issue

access to the Bureau's "raw files",

As to F-J-Staff Assessments - he feels these are

not of pressing present importance,

As to K-I (summary reports on espionage matters),

he would like personal access; he does not view this

as inportant as A-E above.

would like personal access.

As to P (the overall FBI recommendation), he

I discussed as an alternative, access to the

initiating documents in the COINTELPRO matters; and

that I would attempt to obtain those as an alternative

solution to his inquiry. He said that he might be

interested in those documents, but they were far less

important to him than access to A-E.

He reiterated

his sensitivity to the question of raw files, and

Indicated a strong inclination to avoid the raw Illes

question, proceeding by the proposed expanded summaries i

necessary, with expanded sunmaries to be pre-

pared only in the event of specific questions being

raised after staff access to A-E.

He then went on to state that he perceived a

significance in

the recommendation and proposals of the

Petersen Report; and that he felt FBI and DOJ policies

might be perceived as at loggerheads, although this was

muted in the prose. He said that he

felt sure that, at

an appropriate time, the Committee would wish to explore,

by AG testimony at SSC,

the actions of the DoJ on the

recommendation reflected in the report. I said that I

understood his interest in that process.

My recommendation is that, in view of the retrench-

ment regarding "raw files", A-E

be made available, under

the conditions outlined above; I am furnishing a copy of

this memorandum to Mr. Daly for dissemination to appro-

priate Executives of the Bureau, and to Mr. Maroney of

the Criminal Division.

I believe a prompt decision as to A-E would be

most helpful.

Reference is made to the memorandum of Mr. W. O. Cregar

to Mr. W. R. Wannall dated 6-3-75, concerning the above committees.

Attached for approval was a revised draft of the Memorandum of

Understanding concerning clearance procedures for Staff Members

of captioned Committees.

It was pointed out that in accordance

with opinion expressed by John M. Clarke, Associate Deputy,

Intelligence Community Staff, and Donald E. Moore, Chairman,

security Committee, U.s. Intelligence Board, a copy of the

Memorandum of Understanding will not be furnished to Senator Church.

The revised draft is to be furnished the Attorney General for

his approval.

It is felt that we are confronted with a complex legal 3

problem here and it would appear that if the Senate Select

Committee is a party to the Memorandum of Understanding, it is

entitled to a copy of such communication to prevent any

misun

derstanding in the future and to protect the FBI which has

drawn

up this Memorandum of Understanding.

COPY FILED

Inserted in the revised draft are references to

Executive Order (EQ) 11652 and Director of Central Intelligence

Directive (DCID) No. 1/14. Both are limited in their stated

application to the Executive Branch and here their application

is being extended to the Legislative Branch, which apparently

has no established clearance procedure nor suitability for

employment program.

Of particular interest is that part of

the "Personnel Security Approval Criteria" under DCID 1/14

which reads:

"The individual shall be stable

of excellent

character and discretion and of unquestioned loyalty to the

United States."

Memorandum to Mr. Cleveland

Re:

Senate and House Select Committees

on Intelligence Activities

Referenced

memorandum pointed out that Mr. Clarke

and Mr. Moore were of the opinion that since Senator Church's

Committee was already following the procedures outlined in

the Memorandum of Understanding, and had completed the

Committee staft, It would be inappropriate to furnish a copy

of the Memorandum of Understanding to Senator Church. How

would the senate Select Committee know it is following the

procedures outlined intthe Memorandum of Understanding if

it does not have a copy? Does it have a copy of DCID 1/14

which has been, and possibly still is, classified?

The FBI has now received a request for a total

of 122 investigations from the Senate Select Committee.

This is many more than anticipated with all expenses absorbed

by the FBI in connection with a function of the Legislative

Branch. In addition, 16 requests have been received to

date from the House

select Committee, Also the FBI has been

asked by the Senate Select Committee to conduct additional

Investigation concerning Patricia Ann Monaco, already employed

by the Committee, who admits living with Neal Stevens up

to 4-75, and frequenting a lounge known as a hangout for

prostitutes.

Neal Stevens has said he engaged "in all forms

of sexual activities" with Monaco.

There is also the definite

possibility that we will have to process many of these cases

under the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act of 1974.

To date notification has been received from the

Director of Central Intelligence (CIA) that a total of 49

employees of the Senate Select Committee have been certified

as meeting requirements of EO 10450 (Security Requirements

for Government Employment) for access to classified information

up to and including Top Secret. Of this number, 17 staff

members have been briefed

additional 5 staff members designated to receive compartmented

information. From the above it is not clear that, as stated

by Mr. Clarke and Mr. Moore, that the Senate Select Committee

"had completed the Committee

Staff."

It is noted that CIA refers to EO 10450 but the

Memorandum of Understanding, as approved by CIA, does not

refer to EO 10450.

The Attorney General

NOTE:

Memoranda 6/17/75 and 6/23/75, W. 0. Cregar to

Mr. I. R. Wannall captioned "Senstudy 75" advised that the

Senate Select Committee (SSC) has made several requests of

the Bureau for information and documents relating to the

so-called "Kissinger 17!'

This material is being made avail-

able to the Department with the caveats that the Government

has not publicly admitted to 15 of the coverages involved

and that some material contained in the file has been

impounded by court order due to the Halperin (one of 17)

civil suit.

The decision as to whether or not the material

prepared in response to the SSC's request is to be turned

over to the Committee was left to the Department. As

mentioned in above memoranda, Mr. O'Connor advised that he

believed it necessary for a representative of his office to

personally review the file in question before a knowledgeable

determination could be made as to what material should be

turned over to the SSC.

In anticipation of the Department's

request, Legal Counsel Division inquired of the Department's

camin Division as to whether the court order of impoundment

would prevent such a review. On 6/20/75, it was ascertained

that USDC Judge John Lewis Smith, who issued the impoundment

order, gave court clearance to make the "Kissinger 17" file

available to the Department for review as indicated above.

The Attorney General

NOTE:

By memorandum from Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B. Adams

dated 6/3/75 captioned "Senate Select Committee on Intelligence

Activities," Legal Counsel Division transmitted an "Eyes Only"

communication, dated 5/30/75, from the Executive Secretary

of the USIB Ad Hoc Coordinating Group. In its communication,

the USIB Group requested that recipients furnish Mr. James A.

Wilderotter, Associate Counsel to the President, with

suggestions for administrative or legislative action relative

to United States intelligence programs.

In response to USIB's request on behalf of

Mr. Wilderotter, INTD Supervisors have been canvassed for

suggestions and

results obtained incorporated in communication

being attached for Attorney General's approval. Since USIB's

communication was marked "Eyes Only," we have not specifically

referenced this document in our response to Mr. Wilderotter.

We are, however, providing copies of the USIB letter and our

response for the Attorney General's records and for the Office

of the Deputy Attorney General.

The latter action would

appear appropriate, since the

Department of Justice was

included among the recipients of the USIB letter, although

Inspector John B. Hotis of the Legal Counsel Division was

erroneously designated as the Departmental addréssee by USIB.

The Committee has authorized the

staff to con-

duct an investigation of matters pertaining to the

above-named informant. Preparations will be made to

interview the above-named employees in St. Paul and Des

Moines.

Liaison officials at the Bureau and the Depart-

ment of Justice will be contacted shortly by Patrick

Shea of the Select Committee staff with regard to the

details of these interviews.

This investigation may involve specific allega-

tions of abuse or other controversial matters where

there is reason to believe improprieties may have occur-

red. It is not anticipated that these interviews will

be monitored by the Bureau or the Department of Justice,

as they will relate to alleged abuses falling within the

mandate of the Committee pursuant to Senate Resolution 21.

ALL INFORM. TION CONTAINED

AT 13 POSTRAN

Reference is made to memorandum from captioned

committee dated May 14, 1975, and the appendices thereto, which

contained requests for information from the Federal Bureau of

Investigation (FBI), Item 20, Part Il, Appendix C, requested a list

of any Cointelpro-type activities, as defined in the prepared statement

of Attorney General Saxbe before the House Judiciary Committee on

November 20, 1974, which were engaged in by the FBI subsequent to

April 28, 1971, be provided.

In response to this request, it is noted all Counter-

intelligence Programs (Cointelpros) were discontinued by FBI

Headquarters airtel to Albany, with copies to all field offices, dated

April 28, 1971, Specifically, this communication listed seven Cointelpros.

In addition to the seven mentloned in the April 28, 1971, airtel,

subsequent reviews at FBI Headguarters disclosed five additional

Cointeipros. In this context, it should be noted several of the 12

Cointelpro operations related to FBI activitles in the foreign counter-

Documents Pertaining to the "Huston Plan, "

Cointelpro, and Other Practices and Programs

A revlew of all of our illes which have been referred

to as Cointelpro files revealed no Cointelpro-type activity since

Apx1l 28, 1971.

In foreign counterintelligence operations the objectives

are detectlon, penetration and, finally, neutralization of intelligence

operations directed against the Unlted States by foreign intelligence

services or other hostile elements. Various neutralizing techniques

are employed against such services and elements, their officers and

their agents in the United States. Among these are double agent

operations, disruption, disinformation, penetrations, recruitments,

persona son grata action, visa denial and, in rare instances when

conditions allow, prosecution. Thus, it can be seen that so-called

"Colntelpro-type" techniques are, and always have been, an integral

part of our foreign counterintelligence efforts, whether they were

practiced in individual cases or under the aegis of a formalized program..

This ls a critical distlaction to be made between our foreign counter-

intelligence operations and operations conducted in the domestic security o

field.

In an effort to comply fully with the request to provide

a list of any Colntelpro type activities engaged la subsequent to April 28,

1971, in addition to the review of Cointelpro flies noted above, personnel

of the intelligence Division were contacted during the week of June 2-6,

1975, to determine if any had inowledge of any such actions. Excepting

foreign counterintelligence operations, the resulte of this inquiry were

negative.

NOTE:

"United States Sen lee see homittee on intelli eace Activities, 'aptioned

prepared by DR:pld.

It is noted in one instance one individual alluded to the

TARPAO disinformation-type operation which has been directed against

the Soviet intelligence service as being of a Cointelpro character. It is

not believed this latter technique constitutes the type of information sought

by the Committee.

Memorandum

Mr. W. C. Sullivan

DATE:

FROM

R. D. Cotter

SUBJECT: FBI INTELLIGENCE LETTER FOR THE PRESIDENT

This memorandum recommends that we extend our dissemination

of the FBI Intelligence Letter (Inlet) to include Vice President Agnew.

Inlet is outgrowth of Director's personal suggestion for a

channel of high-level intelligence directly to the President.

It has provided

medium for furnishing President sensitive and top-level data in nhich he

would have direct interest and has been disseminated only to President and

Attorney General. Since first Inlet issued 11/7/69, we have prepared

36 issues which have summarized 120 individual items of significance

on a wide range of topics, including racial violence, New Left intrigue,

Soviet and communist bloc espionage, and important foreiga intelligence

data. Material is presented in a one-page format tailored to the President's •

convenience.

Vice President Agnew in recent conversations with the Director

has indicated a keen interest in the information the Bureau has been furnishing

him in recent months regarding domestic and foreign subversion. It is

obvious the Vice President is relying on the Bureau as a key source of

information. In view of Mr. Agnew's vital interest in these matters and

the high position he occupies, it is believed we should at this time include

him in dissemination to Inlet.

ACTION:

If the Director approves, the Vice President will be inclüded

in future dissemination of this material.

THE PRESIDENT, CODE NAME 'INLET"

RESEARCH MATTER

2/2/73

ALL THANAMAMA CAPTAIN

The FBI Intelligence Letter for the President was instituted

in November, 1969, pursuant to then FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover's

instructions to keep the President fully informed of significant intelligence

developments within the purview of the Bureau's security responsibilities.

Dissemination was restricted to the President, the Attorney General, and

later: the Vice President.

By letter dated November 26, 1969, all FBI field offices were

advised to flag information obtained in our investigations important enough

for the President's interest with the code word 'INLET." This was to

include:

1) Information of national or international significance which

is security related.

2) Important current or pending developments in major

security cases.

3) Current information which is representative of or calls

attention to a significant developing intelligence trend.

i: 4) Material which has a beat)ugon national security,

particularly that from sensitive and/or penetrative coverage of foreign

establishments, which could affect American relations with foreign

countries, or assist in formulating United States policy.

• 5 FEB 16 1973

5) "Inside" information concerning demonstrations, disorders,

or other civil disruptions which is of more than locät signiticance.

6) Items with an usual twist or concerning prominent

personalities which may be of special interest to the President or the

Attorney General.

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

Re: FBI Intelligence Letter for the President Code Name 'INLET"

The FBI had, through several Administrations, furnished

various Presidents and Attorneys General important intelligence matters

on an individual basis. The Intelligence Letter served to consolidate this

information into one document. By August, 1970, changes in our commun-

ications capability, including the ability to afford immediate teletype

dissemination of intelligence data to The White House and the development

of other reporting procedures such as the Summary of Extremist Activities,

made the Intelligence Letter no longer necessary. Items submitted for this

Letter by the field were disseminated in these other ways. In December,

1972, the use of the code word "INLET" was discontinued and field offices

so advised. The field was also advised, however, they had the responsi-

bility to be alert for this type intelligence data.

ACTION:

For information.
