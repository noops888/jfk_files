THE VC ARE NEVER SCURE: THEIR POLICIES MUST NOW AIM AI THE INTERVAI SITUATION AND

AT UPHOLDING THE HARDSHIP-BEARING SPIRIT. MEANWHILE, VC ADMINISTRAIIVE ORGANIZATIONS

DO NOT YET EXIST, BUT THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INSPIRED BY THE REVOLUTIONARY SPIRIT OF

THE PARLY.

ECONOMICALLY, VC AGRARIAN REFORMS HAVE SOLVED THE LAND PROBLEM FOR THE

PEASANTS AND NOW CONSTITUTE THE FOOD SOURCE FOR THE TROOPS AND CADRES. (SOURCE

COMMUNT. VC AGRARIAN REFORMS" REFER TO THE DE FACTO LAND EXPROPRIATIONS CONDUCTE

IF THE VC CAN MAINTAIN THE PRESENT RELATIVE STALEMATE LONG ENOUGH, THE US WILL TIRE

OF THE STRÜGGLE AND SEEK SOME KIND OF. NEUTRALISI SOLUTION. )
