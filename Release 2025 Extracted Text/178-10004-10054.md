Dr. Killian suggested that Board members read the draft

report which had been furnisied to the Board on

forth the results

of the all-source review miich the Board hai

requested concerning U.S. intelligence cormunity activities with

respect to the

soviet military buildup in Cuba during the 6-morths

preceding October 22, 1962.

The Chalrman asked that Board members

make note of any comments and questions they might wish to raise

for discussion

during this

twc-day meeting.

Di. Killian said that,

sure the DCI's repert had the approval of the inteili-

gence community at this point,

for he understood that Mr. McCone

Killian said that he had very recently talked to Mr.

McGeorge Bundy who hopes that the Board will take the time it needs

to produce a solid report on the handling given by U.S. Intelli-

gence agencies to the soviet military buildup in Cuna.

Mr. Bundy

assured that the President will undersiand that the Board is going

into the subject deeply and oljectively.

a confidential source) and was concerned because the report did not

set to the basic issues,

sail to Mr. Mcuone about this.

alout Soviet and Cuban plansifor further activitles'involving

other countries in this Hemisphere. Also we are lacking Intel-

discussions.

Mr. Murphy reiterated

his concern that our lack of information on such matters as these,

indicates the absence of an adequate intelligence capability to

keep

our Government informed

aboli developments in Cuba at the pre-

sent

time and in the future.

Dr. Killian at this, point r'ported to. the Board on lihe con-

versation which he hadzjust.had iith Mr. "Bundy. According to

Mr.

Bundy, the Fresidentiis fully aware that the Board is con-

ducting its review of the cuba ,gituacion..

The President wants

an vijectlve report froma group oi citizens who have no are to

grind,

and he is placing great store, on this effort of the Board.

The Chairman said

that fir. Bundy was

obviously concerned about

the prospect that the Congress will make inquiries into the Cuba.

matter.

However, Mr. Bundy recis there is a bare possibility that

Congressional

investigators will

be more nesitant to raise ivvo-

thetical questions if they leain

of the existence of a stuay naving

been made by a group such as the Board.

It is tir. Bundy's hope

tnat the Board will caefully consider the preparation of a sani-

tized version of the report;

•but if the. Board end the President feel

that this cannot be done then the Board

should try to prepare a

report which could be used

in crocutive session of a Committee of

the Congress.

Dr. Killian

went, on to report other matters which had been

covered in nis discussion with fir. Bundy.

He said that Mi. Bundy

nad expressed concern over the failure of the dôl to accent the

suggestion that there be suinüted a more adequate report than the

one

which

the DCI forwarded io the Board on Decemier 26.

Bundy

noted in shis connection

that the DCI's report

assigns to policy

maicers prime responsibility.

for any failures with respect to

intelligence handling.

on the question offavailability of Special Group records for

purposes of the Boarals study, Mr. Bundy informed the Chairman at

fir. Murphy wondered why there had been a let-down in

intelligence gathering after

the Bay of Pigs incident.

Mccone said that this took s ace before his time, but he

assumed that the reasons had to do with discouragement and

otier psychological factors.

In response to Di. Killian's

question as to whether anothur intelligence let-down was in

store in the wake of the Cubi: crisis, Mr. McCone said that

there was in fact a great danger of such a development following

what some offictals consider was an "intelligence victory"

for the United States:

"Iccone, noting that the soviet

the MONGOOSE Group 1t?

was originally conceived that Piase I would be one of gathering:

intelligence on the possibilities

for the organization

supply

of resistance groups within Cuba, but this effort was "only fairly

successful" because Castro has. some. 100,000 Informers' in place in y

Cuba and exercises internal sec arity controls through a system of:

or. "B. PLUS"

and lesser autiens, or "B MINUS"

because of his own speculation that the U.S. would be faced with

MRBMs in Cuba.

In any case, the MONGOOSE effort became diverted

by considerations of Soviet activates in Cuba, Mr. Mccone

stated.

In answer to a question fron Mr. Murphy as to who chairs the

MONGOOSE Group at this time,

Mi. McCon, said that he did not inow!

whether Mr. Bundy or the Attorrey, General was now serving as.

With reference to the abserce of photographic evidence of Soviet

Mr.

McCone expressed his

own great concern that the Soviets are deceiving us by camouflage

methods.

Acknowledging that or intelligence estimates leave a
