The rating period covers the third full

year that Mr. O'Connell has served as the Deputy Director of

Security for Physical, 'lechnical and Overseas security.

2.. Thie directorate which Mr. O'Connoll supervises is

geographically widely separated in the Headquarters area. This

separation adds complexitics to the lask of supervising the

directorate and coordinating the activities of three Divisions,

operating ever a bioad spootrun of activitids and responsibilities.

During the oporting period, one of the Divisions of AIr. O'Connell's

directoraie look or in important, added responsibility- the security

of automatic data processing. This function covers the complexity

of maintaining securit; in a rapidly expanding activity replete with

serious security problems because of the severe compaction of

information resulling from rapid advances and acceptability of

technology in the field of data handling. The achievements of the

Physical Sccurity Division, the Technical Division, and the Over-

scas Security Support Division require a high degrec oi coordina-

tion in order to avoid contradictions detrimental to a unified

security policy.

3. In spite of the difficulty of supervising divisions remotcly

located fron his office, Mr. O'Connull has applied and achieved

eflective supervision. The Divisions moved forward in an

as the Deputy Director of Socurity for Physical, Technical and

Overseas Serarily, The rating period covers his second full your

The Directorate wich Mr. O'Connell heads has

gained added importance and increased attention during the year.

It encompasses an arca of activity vlich is vitally important to

the Office oí Securiy and the Agency as a whole.

Air. O'Connell

has given endorable attention to efforts which decrease our

He brings to the performance of his duries

broad knowledge and esperience of security procedures and praitices.

He has been most effective in keeping a close rein on budgetary

obligations within his Directorate.

Mr. O'Connell is personable and articulate and is able to

express himself well in both written and oral form.

His carert

is marked by steady advancement and consistently high level per-

formances. He possesses all of the requisite qualities of a senior

Security executive.

Horever, I feel that he has not as yet appliud

all of these qualities to their maximum potential in his performance

as.DD/PTOS. Mr. O'Connell has one Division Chici who is extra-

ordinarily capable and eifective in producing results. Consersely,

however, he presents one of the most difficult supervisors problems

in the Office because of certain personal characteristics. I don't

fecl, and I believe that Mr. O'Connell would agree with me, thit

he has yet gotten on top of this individual as well as he should. I

am consinced, however, that he is fully aware of the problem and

is working hard to achiere the proper supervisory balance. I rate

his performance, on balaire,

as STRONG with many outstandin, features.

I have complete confidence in Mr. O'Connell's ability, judgment and

excellent potential. He is a valued career asset to this Office ind the

Chief, Executive Staff

1. Mr. O'Connell has served as Chief, Executive Staff of

this Office from I April 1967 to 31 March 1968, the rating period

covered by this Fitness Report.

2. Mr. O'Connell has been most effective in the administration

and direction of the complex and varied activities encompassed in the

functions in the Executive Staff of this Office. He has been effective

in directing the staff in the formulation and implementation of basic

security policies and procedures. In addition, he has performed

diligently in continuing review of the considerable volume of paper

that transits the Office of the Director of Security. He has been

meticulous in ensuring that staff work and correspondence leaving

this office is up to the highest standards and has been very effective

in arranging priority action in meeting short deadlines. As the

initial professional recipient of the majority of correspondence

received by this Office for action, hu has been very effective in

applying his knowledge of the basic organization of the Office to the

assignment of action with appropriate coordination.

Mr. O'Connell is a personable and articulate senior

executive who writes particularly well. He has had extensive

experience as a Security careerist, both in Headquarters and

overscas, and his career has becn marked by rather rapid advance.

ment and a record of fine performances in positions of increasing

responsibility. I have no reservations about rating his performance

in this position over the past year as OUTSTANDING.

4. In searching. for an area where Mr. O'Connell might strive

for further improvement, I am hard put to find any in the light of

his consistently high performance record. I do believe, however,

that Mr. O'Connell has lost or appears to have lost some of his

enthusiasm and eager initiative which marked his performance for

the first six months in this position. It is possible that this is due

to the fact that the problems we encounter today require more

measured and considered judgment as opposed to enthusiast: and

initiative. Nonetheless I would like to see Mr. O'Connell strive

for a better balance in these essential performance characteristics

: Narrative Fitness Report

Mr. James P. O'Connell

Deputy Director of Security for

Physical, Technical and Overseas Security

1. This Fitness Report covers the period from l April

1971 to 31. March 1972.

The rating period covers the third full

year that Mr. O'Connell has served as the Deputy Director of

Security for Physical, Technical and Overseas Security.

2. The directorate which Mr. O'Connell supervises is

geographically widely separated in the Headquarters area.

This

separation adds complexities to the task of supervising the

directorate and coordinating the activities of three Divisions,

operating over a broad spectrum of activities and responsibilities.

During the reporting period, one of the Divisions of Mr. O'Connell's

directorate took on an important,

added responsibility--the security

of automatic data processing.

This function covers the complexity

of maintaining security in a rapidly expanding activity replete with

serious security problems because of the severe compaction of

information resulting from rapid advances and acceptability ni

technology in the field of data handling.

The achievements of the

Physical Security Division, the Technicai Division, and the Over-

seas Security Support Division require a high degree of coordina-

tion in order to avoid contradictions detrimental to a unified

security policy.

3. In spite of the difficulty of supervising divisions remotely

located from his office, Mr. O'Connell has applied and achiered

effective supervision.

The Divisions moved forward in an

innovative manner and have been effective in discharging their

responsibilities.

t. Mi. O'Connell also spearheads the accurity program

which furnishes Security Officers to overseas stations and domestic

operations as necessary. Mr. O'Connell has taken a personal

interest in this activity and has been of considerable assistance to

the Office of Security Career Board in the assignment of Security

careerists to those positions.

5.

During the last Fitness Report, the description of Mr.

O'Connell's performance was raised from "Strong" to "Outstanding."

He has continued his performance in such a manner as to warrant

an OUTSTANDING rating.

: Narrative Fitness Report

Mr. James P. O'Connell

Deputy Director of Security for

Physical, Technical and Overseas Security

This is a narrative Fitness Report which covers the

period from 1 April 1970 through 31 March 1971.

2. During this entire period, Mr. O'Connell has served

as the Deputy Director of Security for Physical, Technical and

Overseas Security.

The rating period covers his second full year

in that position. The Directorate which Mr. O'Connell heads has

gained added importance and increased attention during the year.

It encompasses an arca of activity which is vitally important to

the Office of Security and the Agency as a whole.

Mr. O'Connell

has given considerable attention to efforts which decrease our

vulnerability at the hands of foreign opposition as well as from

domestic efforts resulting from national unrest.

Mr. O'Connell

has shown improvement in the over-all coordination of his respon-

sibilities throughout the current rating period. He supervises his

people in an effective manner and anticipates problems so as to

simplify their solutions.

. 3. During the previous rating period, Mr. O'Connell's

performance was considered to be STRONG with several outstanding

features. During the year, I consider that there has been sufficient

addition to the outstanding areas of his performance to raise his

over-all rating to OUTSTANDING.

well, both in oral and written form.. ¡ evaluate Mr. O'Connell'8

performance over the past year as STRONG with several outstanding

features. I have confidence in his judgment and ability and consider

him a valuable career asset of this Office. His has been a difficult

task in that as well as assuming new and additional functions, he

has been burdened with the supervision of one Division Chief who

has proven to be extremely difficult to handle over the years. In

fairness to Mr. O'Connell, I should add that no one in this Office

has been particularly effective in supervising this individual who

is now slated for carly retirement. I believe that with this individ-

wal's departure Mr. O'Connell should be able to achieve a more

coherent irtegration of his Directorate's functions in the interest

of further efficiency and effectiveness.

1.

This Fitness Report covers the period from l April 1968

through 31 March 1969:

2. Mi. O'Connell was appointed Deputy Director of Security

for Physical, Technical and Overseas Security in August 1968 and

this Rating covers his performance during this period as well as

his performance as Executive Officer from 1 April 1968 to l August

1968.

3. Mr. O'Connell, as Deputy Director of Security for Physical,

Technical and Overseas Security, is responsible for the supervision

of three large and complex divisions of this Office. In addition,

he is respunsible for providing policy and technical guidance to

our Area Security Officers assigned io other components of the

Agency and in the field. Upon assuming his duties in August 1963,

Mr. O'Connell was quick to grasp the general scope and nature of

these varied and complex activities.

He is an alert and intelligent

supervisor and he recommended and put into effect several signifi-

cant personnel and organizational changes within his Directorate

which have resulted in significant improvement in the overall

efficiency and effectiveness of the Directorate. Recently, he was

instrumental in creating a new Overseas Security Support Division

made necessary by the dissolution of this Office's regional security

staff in Frankfurt, West Germany. He is an astute manager and an

effective supervisor. He brings to the performance of his duties

broad knowledge and experience of security procedures and practices.

He has been most effective in keeping a close rein on budgetary

obligations within his Directorate.

4. Mr. O'Connell is personable and articulate and is able to

express himself well in both written and oral form. His career

is marked by steady advancement and consistently high level per-

formances.

He possesses all of the requisite qualities of a senior

Security executive.

However, I feel that he has not as yet applied

all of these qualities to their maximum potential in his performance

as DD/ PTOS:

Mr. O'Connell has one Division Chief who is extra-

ordinarily capable and effective in producing results.

Conversely,

however, he presents one of the most difficult supervisory problems

in the Office because of certain personal characteristics. I don't

feel, and I believe that Mr. O'Connell would agree with me, that

he has yet gotten on top of this individual as well as he should.. I

am convinced, however, that he is fully aware of the problem and

is working hard to achieve the proper supervisory balance. I rate

his performance, on balance,

as STRONG with many outstanding features.

I have complete confidence in Mr. O'Connell's ability, judgment and

excellent potential. He is a valued career asset to this Office and the

Agency..

Chief, Executive Staff

1. Mr. O'Connell has served as Chief, Executive Staff of

this Office from I April 1967 to 31 March 1968, the rating period

covered by this Fitness Report.

2.

Mr. O'Connell has been most iffective in the administration

and direction of the complex and varied activities encompassed in the

functions in the Executive Staff of this Office. He has been effective

in directing the slaff in the formulation and implementation of basic

security policies and procedures. In addition, he has performed

diligently in continuing review of the considerable volume of paper

that transits the Office of the Director of Security. He has been

meticulous in ensuring that staff work and correspondence leaving

this office is up to the highest standards and has been very effective.

in arranging priority action in mecting ghort deadlines. As the

initial professional recipient of the majority of correspondence

received by this Office for action, he has been vory effective in

applying his knowledge of the basic organization of the Office to the

assignment of action with appropriate coordination.

Mr. O'Connell is a personable and articulate senior

executive who writes particularly well.

He has had extensive

experience as a Security carcerist, both in Headquarters and

•overseas,

and his career has been marked by rather rapid advance-

ment and a record of fine performances in positions of increasing

responsibility. I have no reservations about rating his performance

in this position over the past year as OUTSTANDING.

4.

In searching for an area where Mr. O'Connell might strive

for further improvement, I am hard put to find any in the light of

his consistently high performance record. I do believe, hoverer,

that Mr. O'Connell has toat or appears to have lost some of his

enthusiasm and eager initiative which marked his performance for

the first six months in this position. It is possible that this is due

to the fact that the problems we encounter today require more

measured and considered judgment as opposed to enthusiasm and

initiative. Nonetheless I would like to see Mr. O'Connell strive

for a better balance in these essential performance characteristics

Il I were to single

out any weakness it would be Mr. Engelhardt's locture.: He spoke on the Systems

precepts.. This seemed to have an irritating effect on the pariicipants who by virtue

memorandum of 10 April 1967, since Mr.

O'Connell was reassigned to the position of Chiet, Security Policy and

Executive Staff on 9 January 1967.

2. This then covers the period from 9 January 1967 to 31 March

1967. During this period, Mr. O'Connell quickly justified the sclection

for this key position in the Office of Security and has already begun to

demonstrate his executive talents in this position.

3.

Although the period for which he is being rated in this position

is too short to be characterized definitively or finally, I would say that

his progress thus far justifies an unqualified rating of "Outstanding".

(Fitness Report)

This is an annual Fitness Report on the above employee

for the period ending 9 January 1967. Mr. O'Connell was reas-

signed from Asgistant Deputy Director of Security (IOS) to Chief,

Security Policy and Executive Staff, and the Director of Security

will add comments for the remainder of the rating period ending

31 March 1967.

As Assistant to the DDS(IOS), Mr. O'Connell applied excep-

tional executive talent in sharing with me the responsibility for

the direction of the investigative and operational support programs

in the Office of Security.

It is felt that Mr. O'Connell made an

outstanding contribution to the management of IOS at a time of

the heaviest work pressures in our history. Mr. O'Connell has

a calm, clinical approach to work problems, and his solutions to

these problems reflect the soundness of his judgment and the

breadth of his experience. He expresses himself clearly and con-

cisely in both writing and speech.

As Assistan: DDS(IOS), he

demonstrated sound management concepts and acute cost con-

sciousness. His strength as a supervisor is reflected in the

universal respect he enjoys among all subordinates.

I regard Mr. O'Connell's performance as ADDS(IOS) as

"Outstanding."

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Security

SUBJECT

: O'CONNELL, James P.

(Fitnoss Report)

1.

This is an Annual Fitness Report on the above employee

for the period ending 31 March 1906. Mr. O'Connell is currently

assigned as Assistant Diputy Director of Security (IOS), a position

he assumed in September 1965. He was promotect to GS-16 at the

time he assumed these responsibilities on the basis of a long per-

iod of distinguished service that was culminated in his assignment

as Regional Security Oilicer ior the Far East.

2.

As iny Assistant, Mr. O'Connell shares with me the re-

sponsibility for the direction of the investigative and operational

support programs of the Office of Security. He brings to this posi-

tion a wealth of experionce, sound management concepts, and the

ability to meet and solve complex administrative problems. I have

implicit confidence in his judgment, and he enjoys the full respect

of all of his associates. Mr. O'Connell has made an outstanding

contribution to the management and direction of lOS at a time when

our work load is the highest in history.

He is susceptible to inno-

vation and has a keen appreciation of cost factors in meeting his

managerial responsibilities. He has a unique ability to put work

problems in the proper jocus, does his job without fanfaré, and

maintains extremely high standards of work accomplishment.

3. Mir. O'Connell's performance fully justifies his promotion

to the supergrade level and, in the relatively short time he has been

in his current assignment, his overall performance is considered

unusually strong with many outstanding aspects.

COURSE CBJECTIVES AND METHOD

Course objectives are to aid participants to: learn the managerial theories

contained in the Grid; understand their personal managerial styles in Grid

terms; evaluate convictions about managerial values; develop team action

skilla; ipcrease candidness of communication; strengthen the use of critique for

problem-solving and learning; and acquire an appreciation of Organization Cul-

ture and Development.

The methöd of leärning offers a challenge to all participants regardless of

level or experience. A Grid Seminar is not "taught" in the usual senso. In

Grid teams, participants solve complex management problems. Objective solu

tions are made available.

individual and team performance is repeatedly

asscased. Various measuring instruments are used to evaluate effectiveness.

Critique sessions assist each participant to underatand how he might chango

his own behavior to increase his problem-solving elfectivencas.

Thus managers

are not told the beat way to manage, but they learn by convincing themselves.

About twenty to thirty hours of study are completed as prework. Insights

gained are deepened and personalized during the intensive 50-hour Seminar.

ACHIEVEMENT RECORD

This is a certificate of attendance only. No attempt was made to evaluate

student achievement in this course.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Acting Director of Security

FROM:

Deputy Director of Security (IOS)

SUBJECT:

O'CONNELL, James P.

(Fitness Report)

Mr. O'Connell is completing ten years of Agency service and his

experience qualification includes four years of service with the Federal

Bureau of Investigation.

He holds a Bachelor of Science Degree from

St. John's University.

This evaluation covers Mr. O'Connell's first year assignment

as Chief of the Security Support Division. It is felt that the outstand-

ing accomplishments of this Division during this period are in large

measure attributable to Mr. O'Connell's managerial skill. During

this time the Security Support Division, without additional personnel,

has increased its production substantially and in the area of operational

support has handled many unique and diverse.assignments.

Mr. O'Connell has a keen and analytical intellect and a broad

understanding of the investigative and security problems inherent in

his job.. He applies these qualities with his talent for administration

to make for an overall outstanding performance.

Mr. O'Connell has the capacity for further development and

his future training should be directed to senior management courses

to insure the full development of this potential.

SUBJECT:

O'CONNELL, James P.

(Fitness Report)

1. This report constitutes an evaluation of Mr. O'CONNELL'S

performance as Deputy Chief, Security Support Division and as

Chief, Security Support Division.

2. It is pertinent to note that by virtue of a sustained per-

formance of outstanding proportions Mr. O'CONNELL was

promoted on 4 May 1959 to the position of Deputy Chief, Security

Support Division, and on 4 April 1960 to the position of Chief,

Security Support Division.

3. During the rating period Mr. O'CONNELL's periormance

amply justified and confirmed the previous assessments of his

potential executive caliber. He has demonstrated in his recent

assignments highly advanced administrative ability and judgment

of an excellence considerably more than that required in the dis-

charge of his increased responsibilities.

4. He has continued to display a marked dedication to the

welfare of his office and the Agency. His approach to the discharge

of responsibilities within his purview has been progressive and

sound in all respects. His contribution has been invaluable.

5. In terms of potential, Mr. O'CONNELL's overall

performance and his demonstrated talents and gifts of personality

continue to constitute him as being qualified for a future of increas-

ingly important service.
