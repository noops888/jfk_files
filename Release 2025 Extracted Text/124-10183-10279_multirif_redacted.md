DIRECTOR,

MEMORANDU FOR MR. HOOVER;

FEDERAL. BURBAU OF LVESCIGADION

This will refer to your menorandun of November 22 with

reference to the

Marcis Childs column appearing in The Hashington

Post on Hovenber 19, 1947 and to your letters of lovember 21, the

one addressed to Mr. Childs and the other addressed to Hir. Paul A.

walker, Acting Chairman, Federal Conmunications Conmission.

It 1s my view that the Bureau's practice of passing along

to the various Governnent departments and agencies information

which comes to Its attention in connection with the conduct of

Investigations normally and regularly within the Bureau's juris-

diction is entirely appropriate and correct. Indeei, ii vould

appear that the Bureau would be remiss in its duty if it falled

to pass alone incormation coming to it which might prove to be

In the interest of the general welfare. It is not the Bureau's

respongibility to determine wether the information is or is not

of importance to the particular agency in the carrying out of its

current activities and responsibiliting and whether or not any

action is taken by the department of agency is not, of course, a

principal concern of the Bureau.

I believe, therefore, that the Bureau should continue is

practice of passing along information which it is believed. might

be of interest to the vorious departments and agencies.

At the

prepare a circular to the various departments and agencies explain

tine, or (b) to make a particular effort for a time when trans

mitting indiridual-items of infornation to explain in the trans

mittal menorandun the Bureau's purpose in. making such transnittal.

Mc. Paul A. Walker

'Acting Chairman

Federal Cormunications Cormission

Washington, D. C.

Dear Mc. Walker:

Under date of November 18, 1947, there appeared in the column of

Mr. Marquis Childs in the Washington Post the following statement attributed

to Mc. Cliffora J. Durr of the Fedecal Communications Cormission:

"Already

the FBI is funishing to the commission unsolicited serorts on individuals

connected with radio, and I can assure you that if you should be told the

kind of things contained in many of these reports you would dismiss the infor-

mation as baseless gossip."

The Federal Bureau of Investigation has referred to the Federal

Communications Cormission from time to time infoiration which it has received

in the course of its regular investigations which appeared pertinent or material

to matters within the jurisdiction of the cormission. It is the policy and

practice of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to avoid any attempts to eval-

uate the significance of information relating io matters without its juris-

"diction or tne effect of such information upon the contemporary policies and

programs of other agencies. As a result, the Bureau furnishes to the various

Government departments such information as it seceives which appears pertinent

to the operations of those Government departments.

In so fas as is practicaole,

the Bureau attempts to evaluate the reliability of the source of this infor-

'mation. i thout attempting to make any suggestions as to the use which should

"or should not be made of the information itself.

Mr. Chilas, in his colum quoting Mr. Durr's statement, adds the

following obsesvation upon Mis. Durr's statement:

"Note the word

'unsolicited'.

It indicates thai the FBI initiated investigations and sought io influence

FCC decisions by sending reports on certain individuals to the commission.

If this is happening, it is something Congress should now about.

I desire to advise you that this Bureau has not at any time attempted

in any manner of degree to influence FCC decisions.

The material which has

been transmitted to the Commission was sent

golely for the purpose of affording

the Commission information

which came to the Bureau from various sources; which

In the light of the statements made by Mr. Durr, and since these

statements have not been repudiated by any other memkers]

of the Federal

Cormunications Commsssion, I must assume that the material wnich the Bureau

has been funishing to the Cormission is not desired by the Cormission.

am consequen ily discontinuing the transmittal of such data to the Cormission

upon the assumption that the material is of no interest to the Commission.

Very truly yours,

TO

Mr. J. Edgar Hoover

Director, FB!

DATE: June 25, 1953_

....i.s:.i.

ti.lw01101

Deputy Attorney General

SUbJeCT. Executive Order 10450

....

isie

102 208-46800

Security Requirements for Government Employment."

...

This is with reference to your memoranda of May I and

May I4, 1953, relating to the administration of Executive Order

10450.

1. Your opinion that there should be no abuse of the

privilege granted by section 3(b) of the order in filling sensitive.

positions in emergency cases prior to the completion of full field

pre-appointment investigations is well taken.

So, also, isfyour

suggestion that the Civil Service Commission, in respect to sec -

tion 3(a), should utilize extreme care in permitting less than

the minimum investigation with respect to per diem, intermittent,

temporary, or seasonable employees and aliens employed outside

the United States.

2.

I agree with your assumption that the coverage of

the order is limited to the Executive Branch of the Government.

However, I do not believe it will be necessary to make specific

provision in the regulations to that effect.

Inasmuch as they

are to be issued separately by and in the name of each executive

branch, department or agency, it will be' made clear that they relate

only to the administration of the particular department or agency

concerned.

You also make reterence to the tact that contain of the.

non-executive branch agencies, such as the General Accounting Office

and the Government: Printing Office, particivated in the procedures

prescribed ly Executive Order 9835.

I under-tand this resulted,

not because that order was necessarily applicable to those agencies,

but because they voluntarily adopted procedures similar to those

prescribed by the order.

Executive Order 10450 does not prevent

them from adocting a similar policy in relation to it. The main

question is whether the appropriations of the F2I are sufficient

tọ pay for the investigations required by such agencies: 1 under::

stand that the appropriations are sufficient with respect to some

of the agencies whose employees are part of the classified civl

service,

such as the General: Accounting Cffice,

but not for others.

such as the Liorary of Congress:

In the past a system of reimburse

ment was wotked out with.respect to investigations for agencies.not 3C

covered by existing appropriations.

I would suggest that the Bureau

•".:"

•"".

NW 88326 Docld:32989603 Page 32

---

## Page 33

work out similar procedures with. the Civil.Service .Commission and

other interested agencies with respect to Executive Order 10450v

:3.

In reference to the problem of the jesponsibility of

conducting investigations abroad; the Departments of State and Army

were sequested by letter date June 5534 to co times tatsome

abroad as existed under Executive Grder No. 9835. The letter stated

that in the absence of any indication of disagreement with this plan,

it would be assumed that the existing arrangement would remain in

effect. To date no expressions of disagreement have come from

either Department.

• ...

i.i.

under section 1, I agree that the Bureau should conduct additional

investigations only when their purpose is to develop information

of the type described in section 8(d). However, I believe the

Civil Service Commission, rather than this Department, should

issue direct instructions to all departments and agencies as to proper

procedures in connection with requests for investigation. I would

accordingly recommend that you work out a plan with the Civil Service

Commission to so advise the interested departments and agencies.

5.. As you point out,

the last sentence of section 9(k)

of the sample security regulations is subject to possible interpre-

tation requiring the employee to be given a copy of the investigative

reporis in connection with his case.

In order to preclude this

possibility, an appropriate amendment has been transmitted to

. jall departments and agencies.. Many.of them have also been

informally advised of the matter.

In addition, since they are

supposed to submit their regulations to this Department before

issuance, proper precautions will be taken at that time.

6.Tagtee that your easting policy of sending all Bureau

reports to the Commission for dissemination to the appropriate depart-

ments and agencies should be continued:

You note that the sample security regulations do not

state whether the hearings are to be open or closed and that under

Executive Order 9835 the Loyalty Review Board issued a directive to

all departments and agencies requiring hearings under that order to

be private. In accordance with your suggestion, an amendment to

thät effect. has been.transmitted to all executive departments and

agencies.

•.8.

You point out that the sample security regulations

provide la sections) that each employee shalt have. the right

1 2023

"to cross-examine any witness. offered in support of the charges!",

whereas under Executive Crder 9835 the Loyalty Review. Loard issued

ci.":

a directive permitting Loyalty Hearing Boards to hear witnesses in

the absence of the. employee and his counsel, if the witness so

requested.

understand the provision of section 9(6) 4) to

deliberate policy judgment that witnesses, other than contidential

informants,

shall be subject to cross-examination. Accordingly,

persons giving testimony will not have the choices set forth in

your memorandum. I therefore suggest that you advise prospective

witnesses that their testimony will have to be in the presence of

the employee and his counsel and will be subject to cross-examina-

tion.

9. I consider the Bureau's policy of permitting Special

Agents to testify at the hearings only "where they are in a position

to furnish competent evidence," to be sound and suggest that you

undertake through the Civil Service Commission to advise the agencies

concerned that this policy will be continued.

10.

Serious consideration has been given to your suggestion

that dismissals without prejudice to applicants in cases before the

Regional Loyalty Boards may effect the Civil Service Commission's

register of eligibles.

The Commission has already advised that it

believes that, under the basic Civil Service Act, it can establish

criteria with

respect to the register oi eligibles similar to those

set out in the order.

The Department has advised the Commission

that the order does not preclude it from so acting under the authority

of the Civil Service Act if it is satsified as to the existence of

such authority.

12414

11. I also go along with your view that it will be

necessary that agencies use. a standard form containing sufficient

identifying data in checking individuals!

names through the Bureau!s

tites and in connection with investrgations conducted under the

Executive Order,

and suggest that you work out a procedure for

'establishing such a form with the Civil Service Commission.

12.

With relation io section 5 of the order you state that

investigation by it, intends to foliow the colicy of immediately

initiating the investigation rather than awaiting a request from

the department or agency concerned, but notifying the head of the

department or agency that information of a nature requiring investi-

gation by the Dureau has been received and an investigation is being

conducted. You also mention that upon request the interested agency

will be furnished with the basis for the investigation. i do not

believe this policy to be in conflict with any provision of the order

Sland see no reason why you should not follow the policy you suggest char

13. You point out that

section 3(a) of the order requires

"a check of the fingerprint files of the Federal Bureau of Investi-

gation", but that section 4(b) of the sample security regulations

dealing with the same subject matter omits the quoted language.

In accordance with your suggestion, an amendment to the regula-

tions long the lines you suggest has been transmitted to all executive

departments and agencies.

14. You note that the abolition of Regional Loyalty

Boards and the Loyalty Review Board will affect procedures pursuant

to Executive Order 10422 relating to United States citizens who

are United Nations employees. As you suggested, amendments to

cover this situation have been promulgated to all executive depart-

ments and agencies.

Honorable J. Edgar Hoover

..i..

Dear Mr. Hoover:

You will recall that several agencies of the Legislative Branch of

the Government participated in the loyalty progran prescribed in Execu-

tive Order S835. These same agencies have made requests of the Cormis-

sion that they be permitted to participate in a similar manner under

the program prescribed in Executive Gruer 10450. By letter dated June 29,

1553, the DeDucy Attorney Caneral advised the Comission that in these

agencies are oi the view that they can anont procedures rich rould make

it possiole for them to particinate in the progran by virtue or authority

conferred under the acus under which they operate, it would be entirely

appropriate fos

•them to participate in the program on a

toluntary basis.

It was suggestea in this letter that the Comission work out with your

Bureau the question relatins toteimbusement oy the asancies involved.

Bezause of the above opinion I hove attached for jour cunsideration

proposed undated traits of letters io the Librarian of congress, The

-budget estimates of jour Bureau insofar as they pertain in searching

fingerprint records and Standard Poris S7 fos employees of these agencies

and making full field investigations when necessary under Section 8(d) of

Executive Order 10450. for this reason no feature of reinoursement has

been mentioned in our proposed lotters to these agencies.

The Commission is withing to conduct For the library or Congress. on

a reimbursable pass activities which it yould perform for. an agency, Ir

the tecutive branch under Precutive Order 10450. Ihave taken the lidorf

of including in the draft to the librariän of Congress. the basis for re"

During a current study of FBI juridiction by this Bureau, te

questions have arioen: has the authority to denignate organizations been

taken from the Attornoy General and given to the SACE by Executivo

" DATE:"

This is in sefezence to your menorandun dated

March 20, 1973 in which you requested to joe advised

regarding the Department's position relating to the

above executive orders.

In the event the Subversive Activities Control

Board ceases to function after üuly 1, 1973, the

designation program as authorind by E. 0. 10450, as

amendea, will continue to remain in effect. The

'Board's demise will, however, eliminate it as the

body which at this time has the exclusive authority

to conduct, upon petition of the Attorney General,

the evidentiary hearings and make the determinations

as to whether an organization should be designated

within the criteria and standaras specified by

•E. O. 10450, as amendea by I. 0. 11605.

The question of revising E. O. 10450 to ovecome

any deficiency which arises as a result of the demise

of the Boara is currently under study in the Depart-

ment.

There is also legislation penaing to afford

Congressional approval to E. 0. 11605. Until such

time as these matters are resoived, it is requested

that the Bureau continue to conduct the investi

gations which it has carrie out under E. 0. 10450

which is, of course, still in effect.

During the course of discussions within the task force, it was

pointed out to Mir. Waterman the Bureau's authority to conduct investigations

This. Burcau de now conducting investigations of domontic cubercion

on the baris of emisting Ecderni statutes. This Invectigalive pollug may

not adequately meet the necde of an eifcctive security of Corernment

camployeus program under BO 10450..

The Assistant Attorney Coneral, Offico of Loral Counsel,

prevlously solicited our views

on abolition of the Attorney (encral's. Lirt.

In our response captioned"" Abolition of the Attorney Ceneral's List,"

dated April 1l, 1071, our comments included acvice that under our

current statutory bngie for comestic subversion inveetirations may not

adcruately meet the necds of to 10450 and the obcorvaton the rei

A

DATE: NOV,I: 197%

This is in response to your memoranda, entitled as above,

dated May 8, 1974 and August 19, 1974, directed to the Deputy

Attorney General, Criminal Division, and referring to pro-

blems which have

arisen as a result of the promulgation of

Executive Order i1785 which amends Executive Order 10450.

In

view of the involvement of my staff in these matters, I will

undertake to answer your questions with the concurrence of the

Criminal Division.

As you know this matter has been under continuing review

both in the Task Force, chaired by a representative of this

office, of working level representatives of various agencies

• in the security field and is now under study to a lesser degree

• in Project #10 of the "Domestic Council on Privacy",

You ask that the Department; (a) provide specific instruc-

to the Bureau to conduct intelligence-type investigations

to identify and determine the activities of organizations now.

described in the amended Section 8 (a) (5) of Executive Order

10450; (b) furnish guidelines to be used by the Bureau in ini-

tiating investigations of individuals under the captioned matter

pursuant to Executive Order 10450 and specifically, criteria to

be utilized in determining whether available information is a

sufficient basis for investigation.

Under the amendment to Section 8 (a) (5) of Executive Order

10450, we now have only two types of organizations; (1) those

which unlawfully advocate or practice the commission of acts:

of force of violence to prevent others fro exercising their

rights under the constitution or laws of the United states ors

• 1

## Page 57

any State, (2) or which seek to overthrow the Government of

the United States, or any State of subdivision thereof, by

unlawful means. (Emphasis added) •

Of course, the key words which are underlined indicate

that the investigation should be initially based on a possible

violation of a federal (such as the Smith Act) or state statute

prohibiting unlawful advocacy or the commission of any unlawful

act of force. or violence. However, in order for the Bureau to

detect organizations with a potential of the above nature, it

is important that the investigation proceed on the basis of in-

formation indicating that the organization may be of the nature

mentioned. It is not necessary that a crime occur before the

investigation is initiated, but only that a reasonable evaluation

of the available information suggests that the activities of the

organization may fall within the proscription of the Order. The

most recent example of the type of organization, that you have

advised is becoming more prevalent, is the small but dedicated

to violence, Symbionese Liberation

1 Army (SIA) • Organizations of

this nature would clearly fall within the Order and should be

investigated as soon as information is available indicating their

potentiality for violence and of course, if possible, prior to

the fulfillment of their purposes.

It is true that Executive Order 11785 eliminated the prior

communist, totalitarian, fascist, and subversive characterizations

and definitions, but there was no intention of restricting the

investigations of such organizations if their programs call for

acts of force or violence or the unlawful advocacy of the con-

mission of acts of force or violence in furtherance of these

programs•

It is not possible to set definite parameters covering the

initiation of investigations of potential organizations falling

within the Order but once the investigation reaches a stage that

offers a basis for determining that the activities are legal in

nature, then the investigation should cease, but if the investi-

gation suggests a determination that the organization is engaged

in illegal activities or potentially illegal activities it should

continue.

It follows in answer to your second question that individ-

uals' who are active either as members of or as affiliates of

2

NW 88326 Docld:32989603 Page 57

## Page 58

organizations described above should be investigated when

information is received indicating their involvement.

The

same yardstick indicated above for organizations in deter-

mining whether the investigation should continue, should apply

concerning individuals and when a determination can reasonably

be made that the individuals activities, either within the

organization or as an individual, do not appear to be in vio-

lation of

any law, then the investigation should cease.

Assistant Attorney General

for Adninistration

Your menorandum of November 1, 1974, in part,

responded to this Burcau's nenorandum of August 19, 197%,

which anked for guidolines to bo usod by the FBI in

Initinting investirations of applicants aud émployees in

8(d) 0I E0 10450, This Section specifically instructs

other agencies to promptly rofer to the ict for investi

gation those cases which develop information indicating

that an individual may have boen subjected to coercion,

Influence or prossure to act contrary to the interests of

the national socurity, or inforation relating to any of

the other matters described therein..

Since the guidelines furished byyou are

concerned prinarily with possible violation of law, &

docision to be made by the department, 1t will be

appreciated 11 you will furnich additional guidelines

to cover "sympathetic association" and other standards

• mentioned

in Section 3(z) (2) through (3) when the

investigation concerns an applicant or enployee in the

Executive Branch of the Goverzment.

In considering the foregoing, it should be noted

the FBI has another rosponsibility under to 10130 which ig

'set forth in Section 5.

This Section provides thai

whenever there is developed or received by any department

or agency information isdicating that the retontion in

employment of any officer or employee of the Government

may not be clearly consistent with the intorests of the

national security, such information siall be forwarded to

the head of the

enploying department or agency or his

representative.

Your attention is also juvited to Chapter 736.o1

the Federal Personnel lanual, which instructs agencies to

promptly refer to the Fbi for investigation cases "bich

develop infornation indicating that a percon may have been

subject to coarcion, influcnce or pressure to not contrary

to the intorests ot

the national security,

ar informatics on

possible disloyalty to the United States."

under so 10900, the copartment of justice shall be

Ecation 15 of tO 10450 requests the

Attorney General to render to the hoads of departuents and

agencies such advice as nay be requisite to enable then to

establish and maintain an appropriate employee security

Available infornation indicates that difficulties

imposed by the courts in loyalty and security cases

several yoars and the adjudicative basis has apparently

An early response in this matter will be

appreciatod.

NOTE:

We have corresponded with the Department concerning

amendments to LO 10450 by EO 11785 and requested guidelines

as to our investigations of subversive matters defined in

EO I0450 as amended by EO 11785 as none have been previously

furnished by the Department. This is necessary because the

Federal Inployee Security Program depends on subversive

information originating with.our subversive investigations.

The foregoing requests ciarification in conflicting lauguage

in the Departnent's response as to subversive investigations

and response to questions concerning the FBI's investigative

role in the above Program.

Although our original inquiry vas directed to

Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, the Department

memorandum notes Assistant

Attorney General, Administrative

Division, answered with concurrence of the Criminal Division.

We are, therefore, directing our request for clarification to

Assistant Attorney General for Administration.

Chapter 732 of the Federal Personnel Manual Instructs

that before an agency lasues a letter of charges under BO 10450,

the Department of Justice shall be consulted to assure that the

rights of the employees are fully considered.

The Governnent Printing Office, General Accounting

in the program set up by no 10450.

These agencies again

with the Department and with the Civil Service

commission

procedures for their participation in EO 10450. The results

of FEI investigations under BO. 10450 concerning applicants

and employees of these agencies in the legislative Branch are

furnished to the Civil Service Commission, which in turn

furnishes the results to the designated officials in the

There shall be referred promptly to the Federal

Bureau of Investigation all investigations

being conducted by any other agencies which

develop information indicating that an indivi-

dual may have been subjected to coercion,

Instructs agencies to promptly refer to the fbI for

Investigation cases "which develop information indicating

that a person may have been subject to coercion, influence.

or pressure to act contrary to the interests of the national

security, or information on possible disloyalty to the

pursuant to Section 8(a) of EO 10450. Guidelines were

roquested for the use of the FBI in initiating investigations

of indiviêuals pursuant to EO 10450 and specifically criteria

to be utilized in determining whether available information

is sufficient basis for investigation under so 10450.

A xesponse to these inguiries was made by the

Assistant Attorney General for Administration on

November 1,

conduct investigations to identify organizations coming

within the purview of Section 8(a) (5) of BO 10450, 1.e..

organizations which: (1) unlawfully advocate or practice

the comnission of acts of force or violence to prevent

others from exercising their rights under the Constitution

thereof by unlawful means.

The Depart

ment advised that if the investigation of an organization

"suggests a determination that the organization is engaged

Regarding the investigation of individuals, the

Department advised that members or affiliates of organizations

Supplement Number 4 (revised) of Departmental

Order 3464, signed by the Attorney General on January 13,

1953, provides that all files, documents, records and reports

in the Department of Justice shall be regarded as of a.

contidential nature.

The Attorney General by memorandum dated December 5,

1947, avised the Bureau that the practice in passing along

to the various government departments and agencios information

which comes to its attention in connection with the conducting

of investigations, normally and regularly within the Bureau's

jurisdiction;

is entirely appropriate and correct.

The Attorney

General added

that it would appear that the Bureau would be

remiss in its duty if it failed to pass along information

coning to it which might prove in the interest of the general

welfare.

He added

that it is not the Bureau's responsibility

to determine whether the information is or is not of importance

to the particular agency in the carrying out of its current

activities and responsibility, and whether or not any action

is taken by the department of agency is not. of course, a

principal concern of the Bureau.

The Attorney General

advised,

therefore, that in his opinion the Bureau should continue

to

pass along information, which it is belleved night be of

interest to the varlous departments and agencies.

It should he noted that our FBI reports distributed

to outside agencies are stamped as the property of the FBI with

Dear Concerned Citizen:

Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me regarding the work ui the

Select Conmirtee on Intelligence Activities. I am sony to leant tal

you are unable to endorse the Conmittee's investigation and the efforts

which have been undertaken to strengthen the Nation's intelligence agen-

cies through closer definitions of their legal authority and areas of •

legitimate operation.

One of the possible abuses under investigation is the violation of the

First and Fourth Amendment rights of Americans under the Constitucion

and Bill of Rights. The American system of govenment is unique in that

it not only permits, but encourages, its citizens to voice their views

on important issues. One of the rights we are. trying to protect 15 your

right to express your thoughts to me, either over

the mails with having our messe inter tent t

ized persons. Highly sophisticated equipment now makes it possible üo tum

our survillance techniques, which were originally designed to intercept

foreign transuissions, inward against ourselves:

It is important that pro-

vision be made for the lawful use of this capability, and that protection

be assured our own. citizens who could become the unwitting victims of this

unconstitutional but nevertheless powerful surveillance technology.

I want to take inis opportunity to assure. you that the Conmittee's purpose

is not, as some have suggested, to destroy, degrade, or even disrupt the

legitimate functions of the intelligence gathering and law enforcement agen-

cies of the United States.

On the contrary, 'its purpose is to fortify these

valid and vital areas of operation. However, we do intend to ideutity abuses

or patterns of buses which are clearly unlawful and take action to prevent

their recurrence, whether they involve individuals or nations. •We as indi-

viduals must live within the law; so must our Government and its agencies.

I appreciate your taking the time to write to me, and trust that the

ultimate outcome of this investigation will strengthen the faith of out

people in the integrity of their Govamment.

With all kind wishes.

The New Mobilization Committee to End the War in

The Student Mobilization Committee to End the War in

Vietnam

(SMC) and the Vietnam Moratorium Committee (VMC) are closely

coordinating their efforts with NiC in organizing the

demonstration, NIC, SMC and VMC occupy adjoining office

SMC is completely dominated and controlled by the

Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party (SVP) and its youth affiliate,

the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA). The ViC has recently

endorsed fully the activities of NMC concerning the upcoming

antiwar demonstration.

This demonstration could possibly attract the

Hon. Frank Church

U.S. Senate

Washington, D.C.

Dear Sen. Church:

E212391325

3y way of background, I served honorably with both the Federal Bureau of Inve

igation and the Central Intelligence Agency for a combined total of over 33

years. I am proud of my service with each agency and I feel that my activities

were quite worthwhile and in the national interest. I am a graduate of George

washington University Law School and a member of the bar. I am now retirëd.

is an interested and intellectually curious, citizen, I have been reading

accounts in the public press concerning the activities of the committee which

you happen to chair and of the House Committee which Rep. Otis Pike happens to

both dealing with the U.S. investigative and intelligence programs.Brief-

ly stated, I am totally nauseated by the irresponsible way in which both of you

demand highly sensitive and classified data which seems to be publicized soon

after you get it.

It is my opinion and that of many ffiends that your committees

are effectively destroying the credibility of these agencies and making impos-

sible their effective performance in the future.

Before going

further, let me state that I do not condone irregularities, im-

proprieties or illegalities by either agency in their normal, routine activities

but I do see the justification, in serious security or Mafia like criminal acti-

vities,for certain "extracurricular" activities to achieve needed ends and I

think that the Congress should quietly recognize such, with reasonable controls.

You should be proud and complimentary, for instance in my opinion, about the

highly publicized and often misrepresented mail intercept program when you

stop to realize that it was confined to mail to and from Russia and, insofar as

I read, the results were given appropriate safeguards.

I have no objection to having some type of scrutiny and supervision of these

agencies by some well qualified and impartial panel and I do not object to

having appropriate administrative action taken against offending employees and

officials,if their rights are protected. What I do strongly object to is the

pathetically inept and horrendously damaging procedures whereby your inquiries

on sensitive matters are regularly reported, sometimes incompletely and for

apparent political reasons.

It just seems to me that someone connected with your

committees is afflicted with political "diarrhea of the mouth" which impels

them to babble without regard to common sense or the welfare of our intelligence

programs and, as I read the press, you two gentlemen both have this weakness.

I am sure that the intelligence organizations of all major nations make some

mistakes.But have you ever seen the British, the French, the

Russians, the

Germans, the Israeli or the Japanese governments conduct such a "three ring

circus"

on sensitive matters as you men are doing to your everlasting discredit?

I am sure also that we are the laughing stock of all the above

enumerated

nations. What foreign official will entrust sensitive and confidential data to

U.S. intelligence agents in the foreseeable future when he knows that he may soon

see his data publicized because of some misguided Congressional activity? I very

sincerely feel that strong administrative and/or criminal

action should be taken

in confidential data being reported.

In order that there be no misunderstanding, this letter represents nothingi

to our nation.

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: REQUEST FOR MATERIAL RELATING TO ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE

OF "KISSINGER-17"

NOTE:

The above agreement referred to in referenced

Department letter states that material in FBI files

relating to the 'Kissinger-17" surveillance would be made

available for review to SSC personnel at FBIHQ. These

personnel may take such notes as deemed appropriate which

notes were to be left in secure location at FBIHQ during

the time the SSC study was in progress. When the study

was completed, the SSC was to prepare a summary of the

information considered appropriate for Committee use.

summary would be checked to ensure the protection of

national security matters, protection of confidential

sources of information and observation of privacy consider-

ations,

Thereafter, the approved summary would be

furnished to the Committee and Staff notes destroyed.

Mr. Dick on July 16 and 17, 1975, reviewed the material

relating to the "Kissinger-17" and left his notes in

possession of Bureau personnel. On 2/17/76, Mr. Dick

requested permission to return to FBIHQ to review the

above notes and prepare his summary which he did on

2/18/76. The summary prepared by Mr. Dick can be placed

into two categories: (a) Political or personal information

obtained from the tesurs which was disseminated to

individuals at the White House and (b) a list of the

targets and the dates the coverage was in operation for

each target comprising the "Kissinger-17." Review of

this summary indicates that no confidential sources of

this Bureau are jeopardized, and there appears to be no

jeopardy to national security matters.

Regarding the

latter, however, it is felt that the White House would be

in the best position to pass final judgement in this matter.

It is to be noted that the matter of tesur coverage

of some members of the "Kissinger-17" is currently in

litigation.

1, Question: Does the FBI know the whereabouts of

Riha--whether he is alive or dead? Were?

Answer: The FBI does not know the whereabouts

of Riha or whether he is alive or dead.

2. Question: Was Riha known to the Agency? If

so, when first known and why?

Answer: All information relating to the FBI's

knowledge of Riha has been previously furnished to the

SSC. The first communication pertaining to Riha was a

menorandum fron CIA dated October 27, 1058.

This

memorandum was furnished the SSC on June 13, 1975.

Question: Was Riha employed by FBI? If so,

in what capacity?

Dates of cmployment?

Answer: Niha was not employed by the FBI.

Question: In March or April 1969 or thereafter,

did Mrs. Gloria (Galya) Tannenbaum of Denver and Boulder,

Colorado, contact the FBI in Colorado or Washington to

assure the FBI that missing University of Colorado

Professor Thomas Riha was alive and woll and had left his

home for personal reasons on March 15, 1963? .

If so, who

in the FBI received this information and to whom was this

information passed on in the FBI and the CIA? Whon was

this done?

Answer: NiS. Gloria (Galya) Tannenbaum did

not contact the FBI in March or April, 1969, for any

reason. On May 14, 1969, she was contacted by Special

Agents of tho FBI at her residence in Denver, Colorado, in

connection with an investigation involving charges that

ACIIVITIES (SSC)

she had impersonated an officer of the U. S. Immigration

and Naturalization Service.

There is no record that

Riha was discussed during this contact. A lctter fron

the Denver Office of the FBI dated February 12, 1970,

roported that on January 28, 1970, she was interviewed

by Special, Agents of the FBI at Boulder City Jail, Boulder,

Colorado, at which timo sho offered the opinion that Riha

had decided to lcave Boulder duo to marital difficulties

and personal clashes with other members of the faculty at

the University of Colorado.

She listed a number of

telephonic and personal contacts sho had had with him

subsequent to March, 1069.

The communication reporting the way 14, 1969,

contact does not list the names of the Special Agents who

contacted hor, however, tho communication was prepared by

Special Agent Merrill F. Smith. At that time Special Agent

Snith and Spocial Agcnt J. Hale Mclenamin were the only

Agents assigned at Boulder, Colorado.

As the SSC was

previously advised on November 21, 1975, the January 22,

1970, communication from Denver FBI to FBIHQ could not be

located and therefore it cannot be determined who at FBII

received it or if the information was passed to CIA.

Tho letter from the Denver Offico to FBIIQ on

February 12, 1970, was initialed by a case supervisor ia

the General

Investigative Division and a case supervisol

in the Intelligonce Division.

Othor than the information

following in response to question number 5, there is no

indication that the information was passed to CIA.

5. Question: Has this or other information passed

on by the FBI to the CIA or to other agencies and the

Denver and Boulder police? What was the information

conveyed?

When was this done?

Answer: The report of the interview of

Tannenbaum on January 28,

1970, was included in a

memorandum which was

furnished

to EBIAQ by communication

from Denver dated February 12, 1970, captioned

"Galya Tannenbaum, aka, Impersonation."

The menorandum

was disseminated at FBIIQ to CIA, Secret Service, State

Department, Immigration and Naturalization Service, and

Defense Intelligence Agency.

The menorandum was

furnished to the U. S. Attorney, Denver, Colorado, by

the Denver FBI Office,

There is no Indication that the

Information was passed to the Denver or Boulder police,

6. Question: Why did FBI say in 1969 and 1070--

and continues to say now--that it conducted no

Investigation of Riha's disappearance when it is known

that FBI agents talked in 1069 and 1970 with friends of

Riha about his disappearance?

Answer:

The FBI said in 1969 and 1970 and

continues to say now that it conducted no investigation

of Riha's disappearance because from the outset of his

disappearance to now, the FBI has never conducted any

investigation into the disappearance of Thomas Riha.

Reference is made to the third, fourth, fifth and sixth

paragraphs of Denver FBI letter to the Director dated

1970, supra, previously furnished to the

SSC on November 21, 1975, which read as follows: "All

persons interviewed in this investigation were specifically

advised by interviewing Agents that the purpose of this

investigation was to ascertain whether Galya Tannenbaun

had in any way violated Federal statutes concerning

impersonation, Interviewees were specifically advised

investigation was not in any way connected with the

dissapearance of Thonas Riha, a currently missing

Assistant Professor of Hlstory at the University of

"This statement was made to interviewees

because the Denver Office has roccived inguiries by

news media concerning liba's disappcaranco and they

have been specifically advised there is no evidence

rolating to his disappcaranco showing any violation of

Federal lay over which this Burean has jurisdiction.

The circumstances of his disappearanco suggest a missing

person situation and that investigation is being bandled

by tho Boulder Police Department.

"Becauso of the close personal rolationshiy

betwech Tannenbaum and Riha, it would be possible,

without the above sintemont

by interviewing Agents, that

interviewees could gain the impression the FBI is

investigating the disappearance instead of the

impersonation of a Federal officci by Tanncubaum.

"Pursuant to current Bureau instructions, this

olfice is not and has not conducted any investigation

concerning Riha."

Denver District Attorney Mike MoKevitt?

Was it made known

by the CIA agent that the purpose of the visit was to caso

the pressure on issuance of a subpocoa to Dr. Josoph Sailey,

former president of the University of Colorado? (Under

such a subpoena, Smiloy night have becn roquired to roveal

the agency that had given him the Anril 1000 report thuc

Riha was alive and well at that time.)

Answer: The only Infornation with reference

to the contact between former Special Agent in Chargo

scotty. werner and ClA agent like lOdorOViCh IS COu

tained in Denver IDI letter to Director dated

February 12, 1970, captioned "Thomas Riha," previously

furnishod to the ssc on June 13, 1075.

gucstion: In Decenber 1060, when Riha's

dying mother,

Dr. Ruth Ann Cook of Taunus, West Cermany,

contacted tho FBi in Washington about her nissing son,

she was very anxlous to "do anything" to determine where

he was and what had happened to him.

Yet the FBI

(J. Edgar Hoover) said in December 1960, that Mrs. Cook

declined the FBI's offer to placo a missing persons

notice on Riha in the FBI bulletin.

That information

did the FBI furnish Mrs. Cook to lead her to make this

unlilscly dccision not to pursuo all possible ways to

find out what happened to her son?

Answer: All repoxts of comuunications between

Dr. luth And Cook, mother of Thomas Riha, and the FBI,

were furnished to the sse on November 21, 1975.

" question: Was ir. look connected with the FBI

In any way at any time? In what canacity? When?

Answer:

Dr, Cooks was not connected with the

FBI in any way at any time.

10. Question: Was Mrs, Gloria (Calya) Tannenbaum

ever employed

by the FBI? For what purpose or purposes?

Was she hired to check on Leonard Carlin, Chicago attorney

According to CERVENY, he came to the United states on

November 9, 1968, from Vienna, Austria, destined for the residence

of his uncle in Boulder, Colorado. He stated that upon arrival in

New York City, he spent several days at che residence of Mr. and

Mrs. R. V. GROSSMAN in Brooklyn,

New York, kno are the aunt and

uncle of HANA RIHA, the former wife of THOMAS RIMA.

CERVENY continued that he arrived in Denver, Colorado,

via Greyhound Bus on November 16, 1968, and immediately called

THOMAS RIRA at his residence in Boulder.

He was advised by RiHA

that he would be unable to come to Denver to drive him back to

Boulder: but that he would have a friend meet him at the jus

station.

what, if anything, TANNENBAUM actually did in connection with his:

being admitted: to the United States; as the. matter, to his knowledgej

was handled by a Czechoslovakian Refugee Connittee. in New. York City.

CERVENY went on te state that after he moved to Denver

he did not see TANNENBAUM again until March 13, 1969, wher she

called him on the telephone and suggested he come to her residence

at 248 Logan Street, where his uncle was also visiting her. He

stated when he arrived at her house, his uncle seemed depressed

and upset over the fact that he was

having marital difficulties

with HANA, and that the marriage would probably terninate in

divorce.

He stated the purpose of his being invited to

TANNENBAUM's residence appeared to emanate fron a desire of his

uncle to see him, but that nothing of inportance occurred during

the visit.

it became immediately apparent that the principal purpose of these

invitations was an attempt on the part of TANNENBAUM to have sexual

relations with him.

He pointed out there were times when he

entered her residence when she would be partially unclothed, would

attempt to sit on his lap, sit close to him while watching tele-

vision, or would openly suggest that they go to her bedroom for

the purpose of having sexual intercourse. CERVENY stated TANNENBAUM

was physically repulsive to him, and that he would find an innediate

excuse to leave when she commenced making sexual advances to him.

vuring the period when he was visiting the TANNENBAUM

residence, CERVENY advised she suggested that she copt him, and

actually started adoption proceedings through an attorney in

Denver, STEPHEN L. R. MC NICHOLS, UR.; however, he stated he had

no desire whatsoever to go through with this, and told tAunawBau

60 •

He stated it was about this time that he began to suspect that

TANNENBAUM had no connection with Military Intelligence or had any

influence over his immigration status.

He stated that in May, 1969, he desired to go to Toronto,

Canada, to attent a wedding of some Czechoslovakian friends, and

he inquired of TANNENBAUM if such would be legal for him to do.

He stated she told him there was nothing for him to worry about;

however, she suggested

• In addition; CERVENY stated that in May, 1969, he met

a Czechoslovakian girl in Colorado Springs by the name of MICHEL

BDLIKOVA, who was working at the Broadnoor Hotel, and whom he

eventually introduced to TANNENBAUM.

He stated that TANNENB..UM

imnediately told the girl of her Military Intelligence and

Innigration connections, and advised her that she could arrange

to get her a passport. to visit relatives in Czechoslovakia.

He

stated that in October, 1969, BDLIKOVA told him that TANNENBAUM

had recently approached her with a letter written in English

purportedly fron THOMAS PIHA to CERVENY. He stated BDLIKOVA was

asked by TANNENBAUM to rewrite the letter in Czechoslovakian, and

that he eventually received this letter postmarked from somewhere

in Canada. He felt at the time he received the letter that it had

not been written by his uncle, and when he was advised by BLIKOVA

that the letter was a hoax,

he began to feel that TANNFWBAUM was

a fraud and that his uncle's disappearance could have been for

reasons other than marital discord.

He stated that immeidately

after being told of the letter by BDLIKOVA in October, 1969, he

filed a missing persons notice with the Boulder, Colorado Police

Department the following day. He stated the last time he saw

TANNENBAUM was just before or after he made this report to the

Boulder Police Department.

With regard to CERVENY's association with GALYA

TANNENBAUM, he recalled that on several occasions she tud him

that she would like to recruit him into Military Intelligence, as

his engineering background and language ability would be "extremely

useful to us. "

She also told him that if he were in the United

States "working for the other side," she would shoot him.

TANNEN-

BAUM also told CERVENY that she had origirally net THOMAS RIHA in

Chicago, and that after she came to Colorado, he followed her for the

purpose

of marrying her; however, the marriage did not take place

as RIHA was unable to get along with her children. He stated that

upon reflection, he feels that his uncle actually believed that

TANNENBAUM was connected in some official capacity with the United

States Government, and that there was something in their relation-

ship which he feels gave TANNENBAUM sore type of influence over the

actions of his uncle; however, in conversation with borh his uncle

father visited him, and during the visit, showed hin'a diamond

purpose.of:selling.forarelative.inCzechoslovakia.He-stated..r.f.fp'"

his father had previously cornesponded with another indivicual

by the name of RIHA in San Antonio, Texas, who was no relation

to his uncle, but whom his father had known in Czechoslovakia.

According to CERVENY, his father made a trip to San Antonio to

leave this bracelet with the RIHA in San Antonio for hin to

attempt to sell; however, the bracelet was eventually returned

to CERVENY from the RIHA in San Antonio, who advised him he could

locate no buyer.

Thereafter, he showed the bracelet to TANNEN-

BAUM, who indicated a desire to buy it. Both went to a jeweler

in the Denver Hilton Hotel, who appriased the bracelet at $350.

TANNENBAUM, however, offered him $500 for the bracelet, and

actually paid him $400 in cash with a promise to pay him an

additional $100 later, which he never received.

CERVENY recalled another incident which furthered

his suspicions of TANNENBAUM in regard to a will which he

witnessed at her insistence. By way of background,

he explained

that in the spring of 1969, TANNENBAUM introduced him to an

plant in Denver, Colorado.

He stated he had formerly done some

work in plastics, and TANNENBAUM suggested that INGWERSEN might

help him get established in this field.

As a result of this

meeting, CERVENY became friendly with INGWERSEN, and in the

company of TANNENBAUM and her two children, made two vacation

trips to New Mexico with him. He stated these trips were in

either April or May, 1969, and in June, 1969, TANNENBAUM advised

ham that INGWERSEN had died. Then on July 5, 1969, TANNENBAUM

had him visit her residence where she told him that INGWERSEN

had drawn up a will and signed it

prior to his death, but had

neglected to have two witnesses sign it in accordance with

Colorado law.

She said that INGWERSEN liked CERVENY and had

intended to ask him to witness the will, but had died before this

could be accomplished. She then coaxed

him for over an hour to

witness this document, and still believing she was a bona fide

official in some Governmental capacity, he affixed his signature

to the will.

CERVENY concluded by stating that TANNENBAUM had never

held at the Black Bear

Inn.

She stated that while the reception

was in progress, TANNENBAUM appeared, uninvited, and immediately

sought out RIHA, took him to the bar

section of

the restaurant,

and commenced a

long, serious conversation with him which lasted

for approximately one hour.

She stated that RIHA's bride became

extremely upset over this, as TANNENBAUM would not allow anyone

to interrupt their conversation. Mrs. STEIN advised that on one

occasion she went into the bar to tell RIHA that his bride was

beconing very upset, and was answered in an angry manner by

TANNENBAUM to "leave them alone."

Following this conversation,

the content of which is unknown to Mrs. STEIN, she stated RIHA

appeared to be extremely upset, and although TANNENBAUM left

immediately, RIHA seemed to have lost all interest in the

reception.

Following the incident during the weiding reception,

Mrs. STEIN advised that FANNENBAUM again visited her at the

Black Bear Inn concerning the immigration case of ZDENEK CERVENT,

during which she mentioned to TANNENBAUM that she owned some

property in Lyons

on which she. desired to build an apartment

house.

At this time TANNENBAUM told her that she was a Colonel

in Military Intelligence, and was soon to be promoted to the

rank of General.

She told Mrs.

STEIN that she could utilize

some influence in securing an FHA loan for her; that she had the

authority to deport her at any time; and intimated to Mrs. STEIN

that for a percentage of the loan obtained,

she would obtain

same; and if Mrs. STEIN did not agree to this arangement, she would

have her deported.

Mrs. STEIN again pointed out

that

she considered

TANNENBAUM a "nut," and told her that all of imnigration and

business dealings

were handled through her attorney.

Mrs. STEIN stated that to the best of her recollection,

the above was

the last time she saw TANNENBAUM, and in February,

1969, she made a trip to Columbia, South America, where she had

residod for approximately ten years before coming to the United

and did not again return to Lyons until March 18, 1969,

So1toring the disappearanos of RItA from Boulder, Colorado, on

March 15: 1969.

StEIN stated she did not believe the representations

made by TANNENBAUM that she was connected with the United States

Intelligence, and that she

obtained nothing

Mr's. STEIN advised that ZDENEK CERVENY. eventually came

to the United States in November, 1968, and to the best of her

knowledge, TANNENBAUM had nothing to do with his entry into this

country.

Miss JOYCE LEBRA, Associate Professor of History,:

University of Colorado,

Boulder, Colorado, 1590 Hillside Drive,

Boulder,

advised she is a colleague of THOMAS RIHA in

i the

Department of History and considers herself a close personal

friend.

At the outset of the interview, it was explained to

LEBRA that the purpose of the interview was to ascertain any

available information from her concerning Mirs. GALYA TANNENBAUM

on whom this Bureau is conducting an investigation under the

Federal. Impersonation Statute.

Miss LEBRA advised that to the best of her recollection

RIKA never did mention anyone to her by the name of TANNENBAUM or

any individual connected with Military Intelligence or the United

States Immigration and Naturalization Service.

She stated that

iF TANNENBAUM had been a close friend of RIHA's, this faci would

probably have been known to her, as she and RIHA generally asso-

ciated with the same circle of friends in the University community.

January 29g 1970.:

"STEPHEN. FISCHER-GALATI; Professor, Departnent öf

History, University of Colorado, adviced. that he had just: returned

fron a European trip: He recalled first meeting Professor THOMAS

RIHA-sometime. in 1966 at a meeting. of the American Historical

Society in San Francisco.

He advised he also had heard of RIHA

prior to their meeting.

He advised that after RIHA came to the

University of Colorado he knew him as a fellow faculty member of

the Department of History and had dinner with him on two or three

occasions. He advised their relationship was casual and could not

have been considered a profound relationship.

FISCHER-GALATI advised he first me: GALYA TANNINEAUM

sometime in May, 1969, after the disappearance of trofessor RIMA.

He advised his object

in meeting TANNENBAUM was to determine if she

were a

"colonel" as described in hearsay.

He advised he was con-

vinced she was not connected with any kind of intelligence work

and knew nothing of Eastern European history. He recalled that

TANNENBAUM

stated she had known RIHA for many years and indicated

she had helped RIHA come to the United States but gave no further

explanation.

He also recalled that TANNENBAUM displayed a "power

of Attorney" document which

was contained in a letter allegedly

signed by tOM RIlA.

He advised the most

significant pant of the

document to him was the date of sane, which he easily recalled

January 5. 1968. FISCHAR-GALATI pointed out that January 5, 1969,

Is the date of the overthrow of the Czechosiovakian Government: at

which time NOVOTONY was replaced by DUBCEK, and at this save tine

than c it

the official who was in control of passports disappeared and sub-

sequently

showed up in Montreal, Canada.

He recalied that TANNENBAOM

•indicated she carried a gun in her purse and that

her can had some

special equipment, but IANNENBAUM did nor elaborate further.

Fe

advised that

TANNENBAUM

was extremely careful in her conversations

with him and made no allegations.

FISCHER-GALATI advised his second meeting with TANTERBAUM

occured on October 1, 1969, at 2:15 p.m., same obtained fron his

notebook. He recalled that TANENBAUn called him on the telephone

and

arranged to neet him in front of the Colorado Book Stone in

Boulder.

He recalled that her car vas parked legally at the

aforementioned location.

He recalled that she was anxious to

determine

why a check had "bounced" in RitA's bank account.

recalled she

wanted to know if the University vas

oI. his salany per Universily records,: he advised he nad determined:

a discrepancy, existed between. what: the University claimed to put

Into the account ane what they actually put into Rulys account

He advised at this meeting TANNENBAUM did not discüss RIHA's

•whereabouts:

He recalled his third meeting with IANNENBAUM occured

about five days later at the same location, although this time

TANNENBAUM was accompanied by a small female child about three

years of age.

He advised her of the amount the University had

deposited to RIHA's accrunt..

At this time TANNENBAUM told him

her real name was not GALY: TANNENBAUM, but something else which

she did not disclose, and added that she was about ready to leave

town.

He advised of

no contact with TANNENBAUM since their last

meeting.

STEPHEN FISCHER-GALATI advised that the date of the

document mentioned above of January 5,

1968, and its historical

significance disturbs him.

He stated

if RIHA was not "bumped

off" by TANNENBAUM, then he assumes that RIHA's disappearance

may have been connected with an unknown intelligence matter,

which is pure conjecture on his part.

FISCHER-GALATI also recailad

that in Septenber, 1968, PrOfeSSOr RIHA requested that an advertise-

ment for a travel

bureau be run in the "Eastern European Quarterly,"

which GALATI described as an international journal to promote cul-

tural contact with Eastern European Countries. He advised RIHA

did not indicate if the advertisement was run for a friend or if

RIHA had any financial interest in the travel agency named Treasure

lours, 1010 St. Catherine way, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. FISCHER-

GAlATI advised that because of the reasons mentioned, he sometimes

believes that RIHA could be in Canada.

Professor FISCHER-GALATI advised that in April, 1969:

he contacted a Mr. FRITZ of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA),

denver, Colorado, regarding the sudden leaving of Professor THOMAS

RIHA of the University of Colorado.

Mr. FRITZ advised him that he

had no knowledge of the matter but

would check into same.

Professon

FISCHER-GA-ATT. stated he was later recontacted by FRITZ, who stated

the disappearance

had nothing to do with the CIA and that RikA's

Leaving was a personal matter connected

with personal problems.

;"

Professor FISCHER-CALATI explained that "in the absence

of a complete

denial by Mr FRISk that

the CIA had any

dealings

with RIHA at any time, he,

therefore,

"concluded and was convinced

the information furnished by Mr FRIul did not represent a:

personal opinion but

must have come Pron within the ciA

added that Inasmuch as it then appeared to him that RIHA had left

voluntarily, he also concluded he had no reason to fear for the

safety of RIHA.

Professor FISCHER-GALATI said that if he had

been subsequentiy quoted in the "Colorado Daily" or any other

newspaper as saying that RIHA had left voluntarily and was safe,

such quotation would have been correct.

Professor FISCHER-GALATI continued that he did not

feel, however, that the explanation about RIHA was adequate and

for that reason subsequently directed a letter to the Chief of

the Foreign Agenis Registration section within the justice Depart-

ment, whon he knew well. He thereafter received a reply that the

Chief to whom he directed the letter was deceased.

He stated he thereafter directed a second letter to

the same section mentioned above within the Justice Departnent in

mid-December, 1969, again inquiring about RIHA, but as yet has

received no reply.

He stated he did not know of anything of value ever

received by TANNENBAUM as a result of any representation.

Counsel Division, FBI, dated February 20, 1976, enclosing

SSC letter dated February 18, 1976.

Referenced letter requests interviews with FbI

Agents of the chicago uftice who prepared menoranda con-

cerning the Black Panther Party.

In view of current civil Iltigation Involving

members of the Black Panther Party, and Agerts of the FBI,

it is felt that it would not be proper to make these Agents

available for interview by the SSC at this time.

The FBI is in

agreement with the Department's view

that a proper response would be to allow the SSC to review

transcripts of the Agents' testimony at the trial, conceming

these menoranda.

SUBJECT: SSC Letter Dated February 18, 1976

Attached is a letter from the Senate Selact

Committee dated February 18, 1976, which requests

interviews with FBI agents who wrote various mem-

oranda concerning

the Black Panther Party in Chicago.

Because such interviews might impair the Department's

ability to conduct

a defense in the Hampton trial, in

Chicago, I have asked the Department attorneys hand-

ling that case to give us their views on an appropriate

response to Senator Church's letter. One possible re-

sponse would be to provide the SSC with the transcripts

of the IBI agents testimony at the trial concerning

these memoranda, instead of allowing the

SSC to inter-

view these agents. We would appreciate it if the FBI

would

also consider what response would be appropriate

-to this letter.

It was brought to the attention of the Legal Counsel

Division that in the Senate Select Committee report concerning

COINTELPRO the identities of Agents were contained which are

below the level of Section Chief. The prior procedure and policy

of the Senate Select Committee was not to include anybody below

a policymaking position which it equated with Section Chief or

above.

F. A. 0. Schwartz, Counsel to captioned Committee, was

contacted concerning this matter and Schwartz stated that he

wanted to assure the Bureau that there would be no names of Agent

the report under the title of Section Chief.

He indicated that their procedures and policies concerning utili-

zation of the identity of Agent personnel will be consistent. with

the policies established by their Bureau mail opening report. This

report was written by James Dick of the Committee and contains the

identity of only one Section Chief and that is William A. Branigan.

No one below the rank of Section Chief was identified. In fact,

Dick did not identify SACs involved in this operation.

permitting proposed drafts to leave their premises.

the proposed draft of the Committee's report as it

pertains to Informants in the domestic security field.

This review was conducted for the purpose of deter-

Case -No. 5--Public Meetim

Opposing U.S. Involvemen

in Vietnam War

•(1965),

"Informers were used extensively in FBI investigations of

possible Communist links to the antiwar movement. An example is

the FBI's coverage of

various antiwar teach-ins and conferences

sponsored by the Universities Committee on Problems of War and

Peace. A forty.-one page report from the Philadelphia office- based

on coverage by thirteen informants and confidential sources--described

in complete detail a "public hearing on Vietnam." A Communist Party

official had "urged all CP members" in the area to attend, and one

of the organizers was

alleged to have been a Communist in the early

1950's. Upon receipt from an informant of a list of the speakers,

the FBI culled its files for data on their backgrounds. One was

described by a source as a Young

Socialist Alliance "sympathizer."

NW 88326 Docld:

## Page 209

-4n-

Another was

a conscientious objector to military service.

A third

had contributed $5.000 to the National Committee to Abolish the

House Committee on Un-American Activities. A speaker representing

the W.E.B. DuBois Club was identified as a Communist. The FBI

covered the meeting with an informant who reported practically

verbatim the remarks. of all the speakers, including the following:

•The Chairman of the Philadelphia Ethical Society

A representative of the American Civil Liberties Union

A representative of the United Electrical Workers

A spokesman for the Young Americans for Freedom

A member of the staff of the

"Catholic Worker"

A minister of the African Methodist Episcopal Church

A minister of the Episcopal Church

A representative of the Philadelphia Area Committee to

End the War in Vietnam

A, Professor of Industrial Economics at Columbia University

répresentative of the Inter-University Committee for

Debate on Foreign Policy

A member of women's Strike for Peace who had traveled to

North Vietnam

A member of Women's International League for Peace and

Freedom who had visited South Vietnam

A chaplin from Rutgers University

A professor of political science from Villanova University

Another member of Young Americans: for Freedom

The former Charge d'Affaires

in the South Vietnamese Embassy

This informant's report was so extensive as to be the equivalent of

a tape recording, although the FBI report does not indicate that the

informant was "wired." Another informant reported the remarks of

additional participants.

:

An official of the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy

A minister of the church of the Brethren

A Unitarian minister

A representative of United World Federalists

A member of Students for a Democratic Society

A member of the Socialist Workers Party

A spokesman

for the W.E.B. DuBois Clubs

The report was prepared as a Letterhead Memorandum with fourteen

copies for possible dissemination by the FBI to other Executive

Branch agencies. Copies were disseminated to military intelligence

DATE IS YUCLASSIUED

This informative memorandm to advise of atatus

of repartmental review of Fil files concerning Martin inther

King, Jt., and related matters.

You will recall that, commencing 12/6/75,

personnel of the Civil Rights Division reviewed portions

of our files concerning king and related matters.

The

last date such review was conducted in 1975 was on 12/19/75.

On. 2/9/76, Criminal Section Chief Robert A. Murphy resumed

review of the King file.

He worked on this for less than

four houxs on that day and was to return the morning of

2/10/76 but had not returned as of the dictation of this

memorandum at 3:00 p.I., 2/10/76.

Murphy had been reviewing the King file to the

exclusion of other files of interest. The King file is

94 sections in size and, as of 2/9/76, only about 25 sections

had been reviewed. On that date, Murphy told Supervisor

J. I. Aldhizer that, when he resuned the review the next

day, he wanted to start with the portion of the file

commencing 1/1/68. This would be Section 77, and thus

Murphy would be skipping approximately 50 sectlons oI,

little over half of the file.

Murphy has given so indication, and neither has

there been an indication from any other lepartmental source,

as to the true status of the lepartmant's overall review
