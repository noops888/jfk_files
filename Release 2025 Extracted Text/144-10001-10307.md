GHANA ASKS FOR REPRESENTATIVES WITH HIGHER PRESTIGE TO ATTEND

KENNEDY FUNERAL

FR Washington: GHANAEMB

TO Açcra: FOREIGN

Msg Nr: WA/ 368

23 Nov 63

For Osagyefo from RIBEIRIO, Repeat to BOTSIO.

Representatives from all states to President KENNEDY'S

funeral, scheduled for Monday noon, include Heads of State,

Prime Ministers or Foreign Ministers. In view of this and

protocol involved, I consider Ghana's delegation inadequate

and would humbly advise that considering your own personal

friendship with the KENNEDY's, that you send the Foreign

Minister or Speaker of the National Assembly or Minister

BENSAR, Chief of Protocol, to give prestige and political

importance to your representation.

President KENNEDY's interest

in Ghana and his personal regard for you was such that I feel

sure a ministerial representation at his burial would be greatly

appreciated by Mrs. KENNEDY and the administration and further

strengthen good relations between Ghana and the United States.

I should be most relieved if you would graciously and

favorably consider my suggestion.

Representatives should catch

Sunday's Pan American flight due here same night.
