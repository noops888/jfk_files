Japanese Delegation

4 Dec 63

Very Urgent

Reference your NI. 1962((A)).

1. There is no objection on the whole, but in Paragraph 39

"entire resources" sounds too strong and might better be "toned

down"

2. In Paragraph 30, the passage from "the government of

Japan" to "program"' is not quite accurate. We suggest

substituting something like the reference to IGY in Mr. OKAZAKI's

statement in the First Committee last December.

3. In the first part of Paragraph 33, the reference to the

launching of two Kappa rockets in May should be corrected to

(B val onel, and the payload of the Lambda should be corrected

to 180 kilograms.

4. Regarding Paragraphs 34 and 35, recent developments are

as follows:

(a) The Kagoshima Space Center will conduct its second

Lambda test on 10 December.

(b) There were successful tests of television relay by

satellite between Japan and the United States on 23 and 26 November.

(Two tests on each date.) The second test on 23 November conveyed

the sad news of the assassination of President KENNEDY.
