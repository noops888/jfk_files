Because of the profusion of various U.S. intelligence groups in-

PBRAMPART and related business is a very lively and time

with his counterparts.

Subject is an intelligent, experienced officer with a wide

knowledge of the entire Philippine scene, its participants and their

pecking order. He is a quick

and ready source of the details of the

history of recent years

and he has extensive knowledge of where many

of the

more important bodies arc buried. He maintains a wide variety

of disparate contacts that enable him to maintain a detached

perspective:

responsibilitles in combating the narcotics trade.

By secking out current

and former liatson contacts,

ee ford le of co pretento picture than he recerot of to gave

us some idca of the parameters of what it was we were dealing with.

Through a formerly dormant liaison contact, one of the country's

experts

on narcotics, he has developed both a window on what is being

done officially.and.a mcans.of accoss capable of.affccting ther

Philippine policy on the subject.

During a recent regional ASEAN

mecting on narcotics held in Manila, Subject was able to insure that

our objectives for the conference were set through this influentlal

asset.

Subject has made a fine beginning in getting our narcotics

effort underway. He has done, the baste research, begun butiding the

necessary data base and has culled fron other activities three or

four Station assets whose natural access is being utillzed to

ocverop leads into

the murky

Philippine underworld.

Hits flair for

organizing disparate data is being put to excollent use.

in the carlier period covered in this fitness report,

Subject was

plagued by a nasty,

debilitating fever that cluded diagnosis for

some time.

A period of hospitalization followed by tho necessary

recuperatlve period kept him out of action for a lengthy perrod.

close on its heels, this was

compounded by i freak bone break in

his hand that required surgery and once again kept him off. the

The Fitness Report of tid prelaus period continues generally

apply during this rating period of seven months.

Subject was on home

leave for about one month durinai kiduperiod.

Subiect continued to handle until his home leave in May 1971 two

agent penetrations in the decision making level of the Moscow oriented

communist movement

They have since been turned over to another officer

for handling

Also, Subject continued to handle the Muslim agent

recruited during the previous period but the Agent's performance

has been marginal.

In July 1971, Subject recruited a former Philippine

intelligence officer who was connected with the two agent penetrations

cited above. The primary purpose of this recruitment was to increase:

the Station's control and equity over the two agents and as a by?

product,

to obtain intelligence on the communist movements During

July four developmental cases, all intelligence producers

(including

documentary) were turned over to Subject for

continued development

towards recruitment.

One has unique access in the student movement,

mainly in the Greater Mantla area but also in the main provincial

cities; another is an experienced officer of a civilian law enforce-

NARRATIVE • (Continued)

Referent for Communist Matters in an excellent fashion.

He has a

thorough

knowledge of the communist situation in the Philippines and

can provide briefings on any aspect of it. Subject has made meaningfül

comments on the communist penetration operations of other officers

advising them on vulnerabilities and suggesting approaches for grouter

exploitation of these assets.

His.briefings are well prepared..and

he delivers them fully and persuasively. During this rating périod,

Subject was the most asgressive and effective of the three "Referents"

who are senior operations officers responsible for the main operational

targets of the Station.

Subject has continued to be an effective agent handler.

He

He has directed them to collect difficult intelligence

which has been of high value in planning and assessing future opera:

tions.

Headquarters grades to Subject's intelligence disseminations

agents above

competence in extracting and preparing intelligence disseminations.

While Subject has performed well as a Referent and agent handler,

he hás

assets

in

the unilateral and liaison penetration fields."

This reguirement

has been spelled out in his letter of Instructions (Lol). discussed

by COS in the weekly operations staff mectings and daily

meetings; and in separate consultations with COS and DCOS.

It_isnot

that-Subject-dislikes contacting new people or contacting Filipinos;

to the contrary, Subject has a warm, natural, and sincere approach

in nceting Filipinos.

Initial contacts are made with potential assots

but there is a lack of plannco and systematic follow through that idl

developnental cases require.

Subject keeps himself busy throughout

the day

and his workday at the office normally begins at 0730 hours.

He is no slouch when it comes to work and he appars to gravitate to

it.

His

attitude and offorts in a recent highly scositive Station

NARRATIVE (Continued)

In my opinion, Subject's basic weakness, which was pointed out

in the previous Fitness Report, continucs. to

be his inability to

budget his time to handle the priorities as

established by COS/DCOS

as well as by himself.

Subject spends considerable time on a given

matter of the moment and has great power of concentration on a singlo

problem. These are attributes many wish they possess.

but at the same

time they impede the efficiency of an opcrations officer with

nunerous.

high priority duttes.

Unless he con

is timo by discrininating

against the low priority or non-priority

matters

and focus on

maintaining a balanced portfolio of contact and

staff responsibilities,

I believe his

further devclopment into the well- rounded

sentor officer

would be impaired.

Subject has made a determined offort to correct

the above weakness including the submission of paper work by the

deadline.

By the end of the rating perlod, there has been favorable

progress. an confident he can overcome completely this area of

weakness by exercising the same discipline he uses in cxecuting duties

#.1.

and 3.

Aboverall,

Subject tries to excell and he works extremely hard.

I believe that

Subject has the potential capability to progress to

more responsible positions in the operations and anugement fields:

he-has sound operational judgment, he is cooperative and responsive,

he works well with and has the confidence of people he deais

with,

and he has a good feel for the Station's total ains ind capabilities.

Subject was

given

an overall strong in view of his vigorous. and

successial prosecution of the

his determined

citort to overcome the weakness cited

above, and

his potential capability

Subject during his tour of duty at this station demonstrated a thorough

knowledge of the Pactory Markings program and was streese and competent in

performing his dutten. The establishment of the joint center (Comet) was a

creditable achievement which should make an Important contribution to the protram

The reporting officer feels that Subject has a tendency to procrastinate and

that on a few occasions he did not follow through on his commitments an ageresalvely

as he might have This, however, was the only weakness noticed in an otherwise
