ROBERT SCHEER was at his residence, 6468 Benvenue

Avenue, Oakland, on October 19, 1968 and had his infant son

with him.

He also has a new girl friend who looks like a

"hippie" who has been at this residence quite a lot in

recent weeks.

It is understood that SCHEER's son has been

residing with his mother at a different location.

Mrs: JOHN G. GWILLIAM,

Mrs. GEORGIA SWILLIAM, 6480 Benvenue Avenue, Oakland,

California, reported October 14, 1968 that ANNE SCHEER had

been living with THOMAS HAYDEN while ROBERT SCHEER was away

on trips for "Ramparts" magazine and now appears to have

taken their child and both are residing with HAYDEN full

time at HAYDEN's apartment. / The SCHEERs reportedly had

reached a mutual agreement to get a divorce.

ROBERT and ANNE SCHEER reside at 6468 Benvenue

Avenue, Oakland, California, and most of the neighbors refuse

to associate with them.

There has never been any sign of

emotion or warmth exhibited between them. When THOMAS HAYDEN

arrived in early September 1968, it became very evident that

ANNE SCHEER was very strongly attracted to him in a physical

way. ANNE is believed to have met HAYDEN in Hanoi, North

Vietnam during the summer of 1968. When ROBERT SCHEER made

trips away from home, HAYDEN would move into the SCHEER

residence.

During October 1968, ANNE SCHEER indicated she

intended to seek a divorce from ROBERT SCHEER and would move

into the apartment of THOMAS HAYDEN.

Beginning about

Christmas, 1968, ANNE SCHEER returned home with the SCHEER

baby and has remained with ROBERT SCHEER for the past month

or more.

THOMAS HAYDEN has not been observed in the company

Of ANNE SCHEER or visiting the SCHEER residence in more than

power: we warned, vears before the Kerner

report, that white racism was the base of

America's racial problems; we blasted awav at

I. Burning of Draft Card

The cover of the December 1967 issue of "Ramparts"

magazine contains a photograph of four right hands each

holding a burning Selective Service card.

One of the cards

is a duplicate issued December 3, 1958 of the "Selective

Service Registration Certificate

for ROBERT SCHEER, 653

Britton Street, New York 67, Bronx.

The San Francisco "Examiner," daily newspaper

published in San Francisco, California, in its issue of

November 16, 1967, carried an article headlined "Ramparts

Editors Burn Draft Cards" which quoted "Publisher MARC

STONE" of "Ramparts" as saying the magazine cover is'a

very serious editorial statement,"

adding "there is a very

serious political crisis in this country and we want to

show that the bureaucracy of the Selective Service System

is unfair."

The San Francisco "Examiner" daily newspaper,

issue of June 13, 1968, carried a news article "3 Ramparts

Officers Before Jury in NY."

This article stated that three

top officers of "Ramparts" magazine were called to appear

before a Federal Grand Jury in

New York City, June 13, 1968

to testify at an inquiry described only as "having

to do with

Selective Service."

The article continued by stating that

there was speculation that the investigation dealt with the

cover photograph of the December 1967 issue of "Ramparts",

в в селе

which pictured the flaming draft cards of 3 top officials.

( Should be four officials.)

The August 24, 1968 issue of "Ramparts" magazine

carried a column entitled, "Apologia," which carried a

reprint of a news article

from the "New York Times" news-

paper, issue of July 18, 1968.

The article stated that

WARREN HINCKLE, III,

ROBERT SCHEER, DUGALD STERMER, and

SOL STEIN, all officials of "Ramparts", appeared before

a

Grand Jury in New York City on June 17, 1968, as a result

of the December 1967 cover of "Ramparts" containing a photo-

graph of four hands holding burning draft cards containing

the names of these four men.

J. Threat to Subject's Life

Office on July 8, 1968, to state the receptionist at

"Ramparts" magazine, San Francisco, received the following

telephone message from an anonymous

male at 4:45 pm that

day :

Bor sched to now i ent

SCHEER stated that the New York City Office of

"Ramparts" had received a threat about July 3, 1968 and

he felt that this call resulted from a recent article in

"Ramparts" regarding Cuban refugees.

He said he had no

indication that the call was interstate.

The San Francisco "Examiner" newspaper, San

Francisco, California, in its issue of July 9, 1968,

carried a

news article headlined, "Ramparts Threatened

By Bombs."

The article stated that both the San Francisco

and New York City offices of "Ramparts" had been threatened

by bombs and "Associate Editor ROBERT SCHEER had received

calls threatening his life."

SCHEER advised SA CHARLES E. GALVIN on July 10,

1968, that no one had carried out the threat and that

he would immediately contact the FBI if any future threats

were

made

Records of the Bureau of Criminal Identification

and Investigation (CII), Sacramento, California, reveal

that a .25 calibre Beretta automatic pistol, serial number

415984, was sold to ROBERT SCHEER, 6468 Benvenue Avenue,

Oakland, California, on January 27, 1968, and that this gun

was purchased in Oakland.

Records of the Oakland Police Department were

searched October 17, 1968 by IC ROBERT L. GIBSON and it

was determined that

On January 28, 1966, Passport number G 41559 was

issued at the San Francisco Passport Agency to ROBERT SCHEER,

based on his application, January 27, 1966. SCHEER stated

he was born April 4, 1936 at Bronx, New York, was a writer

position to accept this invitation and requested a visa for

this purpose.

The Department of State advised SCHEER by letter

dated December 18, 1967 that provided he would execute the

enclosed affidavit stating that he desired to attend the

conference as a professional resorter and would not par-

ticipate in the conference in any manner, his application

would appear to qually under existing regulations.

On December 20, 1967, SCHEER returned the affidavit

which was executed on that date before a notary public in

San Francisco.

On December 27, 1967, the San Francisco

Passport Office was authorized by the State Department to

validate SCHEER's passport for one round trip to Cuba.

The State Department files reflect that the passport was

so validated at San Francisco on December 29, 1967.

US Department of State, 450 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco,

advised March 20, 1968

that her office received authoriza-

tion from the State Department,

Washington, D. C. on March

Miss EBINGER expected SCHEER

to appear in the immediate future for this validation since

she stated he has been telephoning the passport office

daily for the past week to determine if the validation of his

passport had been authorized.

On April 16, 1968, ROBERT SCHEER was observed by

a Special Agent of the FBI to visit the Passport Office of

One

of these speakers was identified as

An FPCC faction meeting sponsored by the SWP was

held March 21, 1961, at 5931 Whitney Street, Oakland,

California.

ROBERT SCHEER was not present at this meeting,

but was described as one of the 14 students on the campus

March 22, 1961

A meeting of the Bay Area FPCC (BAFPCC) was held

A characterization of the

is contained in the Appendix

of this report.

On February 21, 1968, there was

a discussion led

by TERENCE W. GREENE in Oakland, California, regarding

recent meeting of the East Bay CP Regional Committee.

At this regional meeting, there was a discussion of whether

the CP should support the PFP candidates:

It was stated

that the youths on the CP Regional Committee favored the CP

supporting certain PFP candidates such as ROBERT SCHEER.

The

matter was

not resolved at this meeting.

The "PW" issue of March 16, 1968, carried a

article entitled "PFP, New Party to Set Aims.". In this

article it was stated

"Author ROBERT SCHEER announced last

week he was withdrawing from contention, although some

political observers say he may be courting a possible draft

movement" for the US Senate on the PFP ticket. The article

told of plans of the PFP to have a state-wide conference,

March 16-18, 1968, at Richmona, Calliornia, to pass a state-

ment of basic principles and to refine planks for a platrorm.

The "Berkeley Barb", a weekly underground newspaper

that features news of left wing groups, published in Berkeley,

California, in its issue of March 15-21, 1968, carried a news

article headlined "Differs But Will Fight for

Party." This

article dealt with the decision of ROBERT SCHEER not to

run for the US Senate on the PFP ticket.

SCHEER was quoted

as aying,

"I can be more helpful without being a candidate.

I want to work hard for PFP without being accused of-doing

it for personal advantage.

"I will also be free of the petty in-fighting that

goes on too much in PFP. I am

talking about PFP in Berkeley.

This does not apply to the rest of the state."

"Without those 1966 peace campaigns, there wolle

be no PFP today•

In this area,

my campaign gave rise

to CNP (Community for New Politics) and CNP formed the

base for PFP here. I made the motion in a CNP meeting

to form PFP•

"That Congressional campaign did give rise to

organization on the left and its continuity is visibly

demonstrated by the fact that we turned our main office

at 2214 Grove (Berkeley) into the headquarters of PFP."

"To. All Who

"Our campaign was founded on assump-

tions which are at odds with mainstream

American politics.

We are concerned with

issues and not personalities.

"We were committed

to development of

community dialogue and involvement and not

merely to electoral victory. The fact

that we obtained an unexpectedly large vote

does not change this commitment but rather

reinforces it.

"The Community for New

Politics' was formed to carry out this

commitment.

We are, in fact, in a very

favorable position to

implement a 'new

The campaign produced strong

community ties and the beginnings of a

serious program.

If we succeed in new

politics it will serve as a much needed model

for American political life. If we fail

to seriously attempt it we betray not

only the larger community but our most

significant hopes as

"This will be a more difficult period

than that which preceded the election--it

requires all o' our support."

ROBERT SCHEER's decision to withdraw as a Peace and Freedom

based primarily on differences with the PFP leadership

over how to conduct the campaign. SCHEER was quoted as

saying, "I think it is possible to conduct a radical campaign

the same time reach out to bring people in.

agree that there is a conflict between educating people and

running a principled campaign.

for loyalty to the PFP program before it had been adopted.

SCHEER said he expects to campaign very actively for PEP, but

stated his position with "Ramparts" Magazine also creates demands

on his time.

The article added that SCHEER said he wanted to

work hard for PFP without being accused of doing it for

personal advantage.

SCHEER also said he wanted to be free

III FOREIGN TRAVEL

Trip to Indonesia, February 1965

An American by the name of SHEA (phonetic),

who claims that he is an ex-professor of a California

University,

visited Japan about February 1l, 1965. He

went to visit the office of the National Harbor and Ports

Labor Union in Tokyo.

The Japan labor union put up SHEA

in one of their dormitories and had him live there until

three days ago, when he left Japan and went to Indonesia

on a ten-day trip. Before he left Japan for Indonesia,

he claimed that he strongly desired to go to Communist

China.

He was complaining to the Japanese labor union

officials about the discrimination problem in the U. S.

and made derogatory remarks about the U.S.

The Japanese

labor union official, after listening to his desire to go

to Communist China, asked the Chinese Communists now staying

in Tokyo about the possibility of SHEA's trip to the Chinese

mainland. The Chinese did not give a decisive answer. Although

SHEA is expected to return to Japan after his trip from Indo-

nesia, he may go to China directly from Indonesia. It is

said that SHEA had to quit his university job due to an

article he wrote after he came back from a trip to Cuba.

The article contained

some derogatory remarks about the

U.S. Government. ($)

magazine had visited Prague and held "a long, secret session"

with officers of the Communist controlled International Union

of Students (IUS) •

is the magazine that exposed the fact that the Centrai

Intelligence Agency (CIA) had been financing the National

Student Association (NSA), which in turn had worked for

several years to prevent IUS from dominating the youth of the

world.

The article questioned what relationship there was

between "Ramparts" and the IUS.

ROWAN telephoned ROBERT SCHEER, Managing Editor of

"Ramparts" in San Francisco and SCHEER admitted that he had

met with representatives of the National Liberation Front,

political arm of the Communist Viet Cong, in South Vietnam,

and also with IUS officers in Prague "several weeks ago"

for two days.

In response to a question as to who controlled

IUS, SCHEER

replied,

"It is essentially an organ of the

foreign policy of the Soviet Union."

SCHEER emphasized

that he had visited IUS headquarters strictly for journalistic

reasons and that he was in Europe writing a story for "Ramparts"

on Bertrand Russell, " (94 year old British philosopher who

plans a Vietnam 'war crimes trial' of President Johnson)", so

he continued on to Prague to check the international implications

of the "Ramparts" article on the NSA.

SCHEER volunteered, "We

don't truck with Communism in Ramparts. We campare the U.S.

position in Vietnam with the actions of the Soviet Union in

Hungary.

Both are intolerable and we make no bones about it.

Any attempt to smear us at Ramparts is libelous and we'll sue.

The

editorial said that SCHEER referred constantly to the people

of Israel and the American Jews as the "Zionists" and uses

The editorial continued by stating that SCHEER

accused the Zionists of being imperialistic, of being excess-

ively hard on the poor Arabs they defeated, of provoking the

war - in short, of doing everything the Arabs and the Soviets

accused them of and SCHEER attributed these lies to Israel's

subservience to the United States." In his speech, SCHEER

was further accused of using the term,

"American Grand Concourse

JOSE VIERA LINARES, First Secretary, Cuban

Mission to the United Nationg, contacted an un-named

secretary to ROBERT SCHEER, editor of "Ramparts" magazine,

San Francisco, California, on January 29, 1968. During

this contact,

it was stated that VIERA had obtained an

appointment with FIDEL CASTRO in Cuba for SCHEER and

SCHEER was then seeking State Department permission to

have his passport validated for journalistic travel to

Cuba. Since SCHEER allegedly had been delayed by the

State Department and since SCHEER had political appoint-

ments running to March, 1968, he was attempting to make

an appointment with FIDEL CASTRO for March 15 or 16, 1968.

VIERA promised to help expedite this arrangement.

IV• WRITINGS OF SUBJECT

ROBERT SCHEER is the author of a pamphlet written

for the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions,

which he later condensed into an article for "Ramparts"

magazine entitled, "The Vietnam Lobby."

The article purports

to show how various Americans worked to misinform the public

about Vietnam.

The persons whom SCHEER holds responsible

for misleading the American people are JOSEPH KENNEDY, Cardinal

SPELLMAN, ARTHUR SCHLESINGER, JR., NORMAN THOMAS, J. BRACKEN

NOR AN

LEE, General EDWARD LANSDALE, MARVIN LIEBMAN, and others.

A feature article datelined Cairo, July 31,

1967, entitled, "Egypt"

which is described

as "A Special

Report from Managing Editor ROBERT SCHEER in Cairo"

published in the September 1967 issue of "Ramparts, was

magazine.

In this article, SCHEER tried to explain the

current situation in Egypt.

He laid the blame for the Arabs

losing the six-day war

to the Israelis on "cowardly

or traitorous officers" in the Arab Army.

The article also stated that many in the NASSER

Coverment say that most of the blame for starting the

Arab-Israel war should be charged to the Syrians for

having provided the Israelis with a pretext for attack.

The article stated the Egyptian people were not at this

time in a warlike mood and NASSER was doing his best

to discourage his people from warlike aspirations and

to encourage continuance of the Social Fevolution in

Egypt.

SCHEER concluded that NASSER must break with

the rightists in the Arab world and make his primary

commitment to the Arab

social revolution in order to

survive.

He concluded also that NASSER's most dangerous

enemy is the "Moslem Brotherhood" who could take control

of Egypt and become embroiled in another war in as little

as one year's time.

The November 1967 issue of "Ramparts" magazine

contains a 13-page article entitled, "A NASSER

Thesis" by ROBERT SCHEEP. In this article, SCHEER

analyzes the

situation from 1952 to the

present, giving his recital of the relationship of the

and the six-day Arab-Israel war in June, 1967•

The article lays great stress on WASSEr being

unsuccessful in some of his ventures because while he

nationalized many businesses and industries and distributed

the proceeds to the poor, he allowed the Army to remain

an elite, privileged class which was not loyal to either

NASSER or Egypt.

SCHEER also blamed NASSER's failure

to develop a political party with its own aims set forth

for his lack of success in communicating with his people

and obtaining their full support.

The January, 1968 issue of "Ramparts" Magazine contains

an article entitled

"Oil and

the Arabs (The Nasser Thesis:Part 2)"

This article states Researchers for this article and Part I

("Ramparts", November, 1967) include BOB AVAKIAN, JIM HAWLEY,

DAVID KOLODNEY and JOHN SPITZER."

The article states the thesis that the Middle East

is of paramount strategic importance to this Country" because

the Persian Gulf produces 27% of the world's petroleum and has

proved global reserves of 60%. In addition the Mideast is the

trade crossroads between Asia and Europe and an important cultural

bridge between Africa and Asia and the center of the Islam worla.

dition the important

The article explains that 27% of the oil used through-

out the world comes from the Middle East and, since oil is in-

dispensable to industrial and military potential it is no wonder

that continued control of this resource is a major focus of the

western powers.

It adds that if control of this oil is inportant

to the west it is absolutely critical to the Arabs, since it is

the only source of the cash needed to break out of

the cycle o

underdevelopment and poverty in which their countries are trapped.

It pointed out that the profits from the oil go to

the "wrongi

states, those with the least population (12% of the Arab population)

and therefore the least need.

The article stated the Arabs could

repay the total investment of western powers of $5 billion in

two years with the oil removed from Arab wells except for the

fact that Western Countries are in a position to force

the Arabs

to deal with them or to have no market whatever for this uit.

The article cited how Iranian

Prime Minister MOSSADEGH nationaliz-

ed his country's oil production May 1, 1951 and the U.S. pro-

ceeded to crush him so totally that the example has served as

chilling

model for other would-be nationalists - no major oil

producing country in the Mideast has dared to repeat MOSSADEGH's

attempt." The Western Powers were said to have accomplished

this by imposing, a total boycott of Iranian oil.

The article explained that the Baghdad Pact was an in-

tegral part of a global containment policy which was put' into

effect by the U.S. in the early 1950s but NASSER refused to a-

lign himself with it.

NASSER was said to be a threat to the

Western powers by being consciously and arrogantly expansionist,

and by holding the position that oil in the underpopulated oil

producing countries must be the basis of the development of the

entire region. It stated that the U.S. response to NASSER was

principally by propping up the economy and military machines of

the monarchies while alternately mollifying through grants or the

withholding of grants to the more leftist tendencies as they appear-

ed in Egypt and other Arab regimes:

The article added Intensive

CIA operations even involved founding the American Friends of the

Middle East - a pro-Arab Organization in the U.S. - as well as

widespread meddling in internal Arab politics."

The article continued that Soviet support of the Arabs

began in 1955, which caused the U. S. to be more careful not to

cause an anti-Western Arab union to be formed that might topple

America's right-wing Arab allies. NASSER was said to have steered

clear of any major direct confrontation with the U.S. and "the U.s.

has never attempted to really clamp down on him."

Thus the Arab

revolutionary impulse, fearful of challenging the west, turned to

"challenging Israel as a Western tool" and condemned

"Israeli im-

perialism."

imperialism that was able to appeal to both progressive leftists

and traditional monarchies in the Arab world. In 1956 Israel

joined the British and French attempt to reestablish by force

Western control over the Suez Canal after NASSER nationalized it,

and Israel also supported the French in the Algerian war. To the

Arabs it seemed that Israel had aligned herself with the exploiters.

This signalled the Russians to begin helping the Arabs to get as

mary friends

as possible among the non-aligned: countrias even while

local communists in Egypt, Algeria and Syria were being jailed, Russia

The article said the social changesin Algeria and Egyft

were significant but also inadequate because

"they destroyed the

power of the traditional upper class without in any significart sense

passing power on to that very broad base of the Arab pyramid.

The

reforms in Syria and Egypt came about as a result of military coups

d'etat which placed men in power who were willing to introduce re-

forms.

The article continued by stating "The identification of

Israel-rather than the oil companies and their monarchies-as the

serious extension of imperialism has allowed Arab progressives to

play at revolution, through periodic anti-Israel tirades, without

continuously underestimated the emotional depth and political

intensity of the Arab-Israeli conflict.

It added that Russia

began immediately to rearm Eghpt and Sypin after the defeat,

specifying only that their weapons be better used.

The article stated "The Central Thesis of this essay

is that the Great Powers cannot be expected to be concerned, on any

consistent basis, with the interests and needs of the Arabs

and

Jews who live in

the Mideast, but are preoccupied with their

own prestige and security needs. It added that both the Arabs and

the Jews identify their opposition with the

supported by the American oil companies.

The article added that "The Arab denial of legitimate

Jewish nationhood as the basis of Israel is the subject

of deserved

ridicule.

But that the mainstream of Zionism has, in like fashion,

denied the existence of a legitimate Arab quest for nationhood is

not commonly admitted. This factor has been of great significance

in the formation and

sustaining of Arab hostility towards Israel.

The Arabs will never be able to turn their energies from opposing

Israel to the development of an Arab nation so long as the Israelis

hold the existence of an Arab nation to be a threat."

viewed the drive toward Arai unity and independence as

a threat

to them.

ABBA EBAN conferred upon Israel the very nationhoot that

Israel denied to the Arabs.

The Arabs find this position most

difficult to accept when

the Jews deny them the same position.

The article

stated tht "Israelis must come to accept the fact

that

nationhood is an aspiration which some Arabs hold without being

conned into it by NASSER; and that an Arab State - if it became a

reality (as a confederation or a nation) - is not necessarily a

threat to Israel."

The article concluded that "The Arab Nation and the

Jewish Nation are both legitimate concepts which can survive to-

rether only if they exist as part of the same social revolution

"Editor Attacks U. S. Policy in Vietnam;

Sees National Peril."

In this article it was stated that

ROBERT SCHEER had delivered a speech at the Raymond College

High Table, University of the Pacific, Stockton, California,

on september 1, 1966•

SCHEER maintained that the concept

of an international communist conspiracy was false and the

U. S. is mistaken in considering it a unified, ever-growing

force that can only be contained by force.

He stated that

the communist conspiracy is a movement that does not hold

together because of nationalistic interests. He cited

the Sino-Soviet dispute and the international squabbling

between satellite countries and the major communist powers.

He said the Vietnam conflict began as an internal dispute

and if the U. S. withdrew from the conflict this withdrawal

would reaffirm the communists' confidence in the possibility

of peaceful co-existence.

He concluded that if anyone is genuinely concerned

about American security, he is going to have to work to

reverse American foreign policy.

October 18, 1966

"The Guardsman," weekly student newspaper at City

College of San Francisco, in its issue of October 19, 1966,

carried a news article headlined, "Scheer Lectures on Involvement

in Southeast Asia."

The article stated ROBERT SCHEER spoke at

the College Theater to a capacity audience.

He was reported

to have reviewed the historical changes in Vietnam, the French

role in Vietnam affairs, and the limited policy set by President

KENNEDY of only sending 30,000 advisors as "technical aid only

for a limited period of time to prevent a colonial posture."

The article stated further, "In a summary conclusion SCHEER

said that if there is an international communist movement, it

should cease to exist, that there are hardly two communist

countries that coexist, that communism is in truth a form of

nationalism and that practically speaking, 'it does not exist.'"

December 2, 1966

Discussion Unlimited, Incorporated (DU), sponsored

a meeting December 2, 1966, in the auditorium of Los Angeles

Trade College, 100 block, Washington Boulevard, Los Angeles,

with from 1,000 to 1,500

people in attendance.

The topic of

the discussion was "What Will the New Development on the Left

Be?"

ROBERT SCHEER from "Ramparts"

magazine, EUGENE GENOVESE

• from Rutgers College in New Jersey, and DOROTHY HEALEY from

Southern California District CP were the speakers.

HEALEY

spoke first, stating that the most important things for the

groups on the left to do today were to unite on common grounds

and to be critical on grounds where they cannot agree,

as well

as to give allegiance to the other 14 socialist countries in

the world. She described these countries as the hope of the

future.

ROBERT SCHEER attacked her bitterly, his main contention

being that he felt he could not even say he was a socialist

because

of all the crimes that are committed in the name of

socialism.

He said he could not align himself with other

countries in the socialist world because of the barbaric

deeds committed by some of these countries.

He led a vicious attack against the Soviet Union,

against the STALIN era,

against the crimes that were committed

in the Soviet Union against Jewish people and Jewish culture,

and against other religious people and intellectuals in the

Soviet Union.

He made reference to the two writers who had

been recently jailed in Russia.

In a rebuttal and question

and answer period the attack went back and forth, mainly

between GENOVESE and HEALEY against SCHEER for his anti-Soviet

Union position.

SCHeER constantly brought up hungary, stating

that the oppression that went on in Hungary is no different

than the oppression of the Untted States in Vietnam.

He also

said the Soviet Union is a sick society just as the U.S. is

a sick society, and he is quite sure that the workers

society are not much aware of or care about the relative

difference of the sickness.

He was introduced

as editor of "Ramparts" magazine.

His only comments concerning

officials of the U. S: Government. He indicated that if anything

went wrong with the policy of the high government officials,

they could always blame CIA for their failures.

In discussing the Vietnam war, SCHEER stated the

President of the U.S., along with other government officials,

were guilty of murder of innocent women and children.

SCHEER

then spoke of a trip he had taken to France and Belgium.

and gained the impression that these officials were opposed to

the war policy of President JOHNSON, particularly the bombing

of North Vietnam.

SCHEER alleged that there were more bombs

dropped in Vietnam than were dropped during World War II.

claimed that the reason the U.S. was using anti-personnel bombs

against the people of North Vietnam was because they did not

agree

with the U.S. and the use of anti-personnel bomb was of

an integral part of a policy of corrupt self-seeking

deception."

After explaining that MOBERT SCHEER visited

South Vietnam twice, the article quoted SCHEER as saying,

"I think we have to realize that the Vietnamese are indeed

fighting for their freedom - but their freedom from us.

They are nationalists trying to create a national revolution,

and they can't be explained away with a label."

SCHEER alleged that the United States was in

the Vietnam war to make a profit. He called for staged

withdrawal of U.S. troops over a period of years.

In reference to the domestic scene, SCHEFF warned

that

Sterner nuasures against dissent were

coming and that

President JOHNSON's talk about peace was a "cor job."

SCHEER said people were rioting in America because "they

have no legitimate avenue of dissent."

In summary, SCHEET

urged concerned youth not to become complacent but to

remain

aware of the problems and refuse to conspire with

liberal politicians who try to make dissent irrelevant

SCHEFF told the group, "Block the halls and block the

1967, and the results of this interview were shown

on Canadian Broadcasting Company television network on February

23, 1968. Some of the points emphasized by SCHEER in this inter-

view are as follows:

"Ramparts" magazine, of which SCHEER is Editor, tries

to handle and to give some diversity of opinion in the mass media

of America.

It is an experiment in seeing whether American

freedom and democracy really works. Other magazines are locked

Into the establishment because of the funding required to start a

magazine and the income received from advertisers, while "Ramparts"

is probably the only large circulation magazine in America that

does not depend on advertising.

"Ramparts" made a decision to challenge the big

magazines and to turn to a secular monthly magazine two and a

half years ago (about January, 1965) and it no longer has any

connection with or particular

interest in the Catholic Church.

It is aimeda challenging the establishment and its readers,

who are primarily in the 15 to 40 year age group.

Ramparts" has been called a muckraker and

left-wing.

It is on the left of the political spectrum since

it opposes the war in Vietnam and is interested in removing the

ghettos in American life.

"Ramparts" is based as a left-wing

opposition to "Time" magazine but "Time" is biased toward the

establishment and toward maintaining the status quo.

"Ramparts"

has never been sued for libel or had a serious challenge to its

factual accuracy.

"Ramparts" has a small staff of only 30 and

has successfully challenged the other big magazines with exten-

sive advertising revenue

and has done a more factual reporting

job on the Vietnam War, its casualties, civil rights stories

and stories on such topics as the children of suburbia rebelling

against suburban community and its values.

"Ramparts" magazine is largely staff produced and has

nothing to offer but the guts and freedom of its reporters to

report facts as they see them.

"Ramparts" does not edit the

reporters' articles for opinion or value of concept.

These

articles are only edited for size and possible emphasis for a

particular issue so that there would not be four articles on

Vietnam in a single issue, for instance. When "Ramparts" sends

a reporter to do a story it prints what the reporter writes

even though the Editor does not necessarily agree with that

reporter's viewpoint.

SCHEER feels that the United States is more

afflicted

with an extremely biased press because in the United

States we have the illusion of freedom and Americans are raised

to believe that we have

a free press while in fact the press is

controlled through "an interlocking directorate of big business,

big military and big government' that effectively manages the

news

so that it is not troubling or upsetting to their interests.

SCHEER beljeves that the honest reporting of news by

"Ramparts" is doing

"an awful lot of good" because a generation

is being raised in the United States that knows how to be free

for a change and "is not going to buy the nonsense that comes

out of Washington'.

The youths are asking some very searching

questions about American society and are not satisfied with the

usual glibness so they are willing to go on marches because

they do not buy these answers. This is a very large minority

of youths.

Most of the American soldiers in Vietnam have been

raised to believe that their country always does right and have

an implicit racism.

They realize that the Vietnamese do not

really share United States objectives. For instance "There

is a 650,000 man Vietnamese army that never does any fighting".

"It is very clear that the Viet Cong has considerable support

from the countryside and has done some very fine things in the

countryside."

There are some cracks in the brainwashing and some

disillusionment with the war in Vietnam even among

American troops.

more people have refused to fight and more people in the army

have taken those critical steps rather than go along with the

fighting.

It is not a significant number yet, but SCHEER

believes it is growing.

"We have to figure out whether the

United States is Rome on the rise or Rome in decay and hopefully

America's empire is on the verge of cracking up."

When asked if he could make a generalization about the

American housewife and American married life, SCHEER stated,

"The average American is drunk most of the time."

explained that the average American has a couple of drinks before

starting home and several more when he arrives at home.

The

cocktail hour is all about getting "yourself numb enough that

you can take your wife and kids and then you usually fall asleep

in front of the television."

scheduled to speak on

the "relevance of

academe in response to cultural needs," but abandoned this

topic and instead dissected the speech given by Albion College

President LOUIS W. NORRIS to freshmen at this school in the fall

of 1967.

SCHEER said Dr. NORRIS'

speech stressed the importance

of vicarious learning and the central role of the "great

conversation." SCHEER said the "great conversation is a bore."

SCHEER stated that white middle class Americans want to make a

revolution without doing anything revolutionary.

SCHEER said

Dr. NORRIS stated in his speech "hippies" did not belong on

Albion's campus.

SCHEER replied to this "with these

ideas he

shouldn't be president of a university, and I wouldn't have to

make these statements if he hadn't given such a speech to the

freshmen."

He said that America can no longer engage in foreign

aggression in the guise of extending freedom." SCHEER concluded

his speech by stating that to alleviate these crises America

should dismantle the defense apparatus, turn to a peace economy

and get out of

. Vietnam.

One of the critics of SCHEER's speech was quoted in

this article as saying, "Some of what he said was admirable, but

he was so irrational and so boorish and had excruciating bad

taste."

VI. WRITINGS ABOUT SCHEER

Human Events publication, Washington, D.C., in its

issue of April 8, 1967, carried a story headlined, "The Inside

Story of 'Ramparts' Magazine".

A portion of this

story,

Scheer's Radicalism, reads as follows:

Probably the best known nationally of Ramparts'

staffers is Managing Editor Robert Scheer, who, at

30, has made a career of New Leftism. A former member

of

the pro-Castro Fair Play for Cuba Committee, he

is the most articulate of the Ramparts crew and con-

tends that he is an anti-Communist.

Last year Scheer ran for the Democratic nomi-

nation for U.S. Congress in Berkeley, hinging his

entire campaign on getting out of the war

Nam and getting into the

Several

to meet with the Communist-controlled International

Union of Students and representatives of the National

Liberation Front,

the political arm of the Comnunist

Viet Cong in South Viet Nam.

Not publicized in his race for Congress but

revealed later was the fact that Scheer's campaign

coordinator was Carl Bloice, a 28-year-old Communist

party member.

Bloice's CP membership was hardly a

secret; for several years he had been a by-lined staff

writer for People's World, the Communist weekly on

the West Coast, and then he

was publications director

of the Communist-controlled W.E.B. DuBois Clubs.-

"From Berkeley to D.C.

"At last summer's Communist party convention in

New York City, Bloice vas elected to the CP's National

Committee and the requirements for serving on that

policy board make it ciear Bloice has been a CP member

since at least January 1964, although intelligence

agencies place it many years

earlier.

"Just two months ago the newsletter of the Robert

scheer campaign he is keeping his organization intact

under the name of Community for New Politics (CNI)

carried a social note:

'Carl Bloice, heretofore

coorainator for cut, has left Berkeley for the Larger

battlefield in washington, D.C., where he will be a

correspondent for People's world and The worker. At

a farewell party December 23 at the home of Mr. and

InS: Robert Scheer, Carl was presented with several

zoing-away gifts, including a larger than life poster

of Mao-Tse Tung.. Carl has indicated he will be an

occasional correspondent [for the Scheer newsletter].

we feel fully comforted by the fact that

"The portrait of Mao probably brought a gust

of laughter when it was unveiled and presented to the

Moscow line Bloice, and the 'gaining a spy' phrase was

simply new Left humor. The story makes two important

points: 1) Scheer's campaign manager was a Communist,

and 2) The Capital correspondent for two Communist

newspapers will contribute occasional articles to

Scheer's campaign organization.

"Scheer has told Human Events that he hired Bloice

'for his technical competence'; that he likes him as

a person, but violently disagrees with his politics.

supporters. Another backer was

which channeled funds into Scheer's campaign.

It

worked this way.

During his campaign one of his

workers was Mrs. Phyllis Haberman O'Donnell, who has

been chairman of the Fust Bay Dufois Club.

Mrs. O'Donnell

worked on a work-study program directed by the

University of California's Department of Criminology

(which is now practically another Sociology Department)

and was assigned to a leftist group called welfare

Rights Organization as a case worker.

In truth, she

worked for the Scheer campaign and reported on it

at WRO meetings.

"The work-study program

was originally funded

through the Office of Economic Opportunity, receives

its funds through the National Defense Education Act

and is overseen by the Department of Health, Education

and Welfare."

An article by IVAN SHARPE appeared in the San

Francisco Bay Guardian daily newspaper published at San Francisco,

California, in its issue of March 27, 1969, entitled "Ramparts -

revolution with limousine service."

This article reflects

numerous interviews with present and former officials of Ramparts

magazine and analyzes factors that led to this magazine's financial

difficulties.

The article places primary blame for the bankruptcy

on WARREN HINCKLE and ROBERT SCHEER for their extragavant spending,

such as taking their wives on trips for Ramparts and spending huge

sums of money.

Most of the blame was placed on WARREN HINCKLE

because frequently his expense account would be more than the

money he raised on promotional trips.

The article gave most of

the credit for the sensational stories and exposes to ROBERT

SCHEER, who obtained them from his new left contacts.

It reported

that HINCKLE had destroyed Ramparts and SCHEER was angry about

this.

SCHEER decided to stay on as Editor-In-Chief of Ramparts

and his

salary has been reduced from $15,000 to $10,000 per year

in an effort to help the magazine out of its financial problems.

the unified struggle of the workine neople.

As young people in

complete freedom and democracy for all Americans, thus enabling

each individual to freely choose and build the society he would

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE

The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York Times"

newspaper contained a

full-page advertisement captioned

What is Really Happening in Cuba," placed by the Fair Play

for Cuba Committee (FPCC). This advertisement announced

the formation of the FPCC in New York City and declared the

FPCC intended to promulgate "the truth about revolutionary

Cuba" to neutralize the distorted American press.

"The New York Times" edition of January 1l, 1961,

reported that at a hearing conducted before the United States

Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on January 10, 1951,

Dr. CHARLES A. SANTOS-BUCH identified himself and ROBERT TABER

as organizers of the FPCC.

He also testified he and TABER

obtained funds from the Cuban Government which were applied

toward the cost of the aforementioned advertisement.

On May 15, 1963, a source advised that auring the

first two years of the FPCC's existence there was a struggle

between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers Party (SWP)

elements to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby

influence FPCC policy.

This source added that auring the

past year there had been a successful effort by FPCC leadership

to minimize the role of these and other organizations in the

FPCC so that their influence as of May, 1963, was negligible.

The SWP has been designated by the Attorney

General of the United

States pursuant to

Executive Order 10450.

On May 20, 1963, a second source advised that

VINCENT "TED" LEE,

FPCC National Office Director, was then

formulating FPCC policy and had indicated that he had no

other organization.

that the FPCC should advocate resumption of diplomatic

relations between Cuba and the United States and should

support the right of Cubans to manage their revolution without

interference from other nations.: LEE did not advocate

one nations"

supporting the cuban revolution per se

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE (cont' d.)

The Noverber 22, 1963, edition of "The New York

Times' reported that Senator THOMAS J. DODD Of Cornecticut

had called FPCC "the chief public relations instrument of

the Castro network in the United States." It is to be noted

that Senator DODD was a member of the Senate Internal

Security Subcommittee which twice conducted hearings on the

FPCC .

The December

27, 1963, edition of "The New York

World Telegram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-Castro

FeCC was seeking to go out of business and that its prime

activity during its lifetime had been sponsorship of pro-

Castro street rallies and mass picket lines, and the direction

of an active propaganda mill highlighting illegal travel-co-

cuba campaigns. Lis comparatively brief span of life was

attributed to mounting anti-Castro American public opinion,

the 1962 Congressional hearings which disclosed FPCC financing

by Castro's United Nations Delegation, and ultimately, the

bad publicity which the FPCC received

from disclosure of

activities on its behalf by suspected Presidential assassin

LEE H. OSWALD:

On February 6, 1964, the previously mentioned

second source advised that V. T. LEE had recently remarked

that the FPCC was dead and that there were no plans to

organize another similar organization.

On April 13, 1964, a third source advised that

there had not been any FPCC activity in many months and that

the FPCC had been dissolved.

VIETNAM DAY COMMITTEE (VDC)

A source advised in May, 1965, that the VDC was founded in

May, 1965, to organize the May 21-22, 1965, community "teach-in"

on

the University of California, Berkeley, California (UCB) campus.

Public literature distributed by the VDC reveals that the

purpose of the VDC is to mold public opinion to force withdrawal of

the United States from Vietnam, and to utilize dramatic, large-scale

demonstrations in increasing public alarm about the Vietnam war.

A second source advised on June 24, 1966, that at a meeting

of the San Francisco Branch of the Socialist Horkers Party (SMP) in

San Francisco, California, on June 22, 1966, KIPP DAWSON, whom source

identified as a member of the Branch, commented, among other things,

that with our help' the VDC was finally recognized as a political

power and was under "our control."

The SWP has been designated by the

Attorney General of the United States

pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

During

the period from August 18, 1966 to October 7, 1966, the

VDC was publicly announced as having been expelled from the UCB as

a recognized on-campus organization.

A third source advised on September 29, 1966, that PETE CAMEJO

was the chief spokesman for the VDC in its attempts for reinstate-

ment as a recognized UCB on-campus organization. Following the re-

instatement of the VDC in October, 1966, CAMEJO decided to disband

the Campus

Chapter of the United Committee Against Mar (UCAl), which

he had organized to replace the VDC on the UCB campus when it was

YOUNG SOCIALIST ALLIANCE

The May, 1960 issue of the "Young Socialist" (YS),

page 1, column 3,

disclosed that during April 15-17, 1960, a

national organization entitled "The Young Socialist Alliance"

(YSA) was established at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This issue

stated that this organization was formed by the nation-wide

supporter clubs of the publication YS.

The above issue, page 6, set forth the Founding Declara-

tion of YSA.

This declaration stated that the YSA recognizes

the

Socialist Workers Party (SWP) as the only existing political

leadership on class struggle principles, and that the supporters

of the YS have come into basic political solidarity with the SWP

on the principles of revolutionary socialism.

A source advised on May 23, 1966, that the original YSA

was an organization formed during October,

1957, in New York City

by youth of various left socialist tendencies, particularly members

and followers of the SWP.

The leaders of this

group were the

guiding forces in the establishment of the national organization.

The source further advised on May 23, 1966, that the YSA

is dominated and controlled on a national basis by the SWP through

having SWP members comprise

exclusively the National Executive

Committee (NEC).

The YSA, in reality, is the youth and training

section of the SWP and the main source of new SWP members.

The headquarters of the YSA are located in Room 535,

41 Union Square West, New York City.

The SWP has been designated pursuant to

Executive Order

10450.
