so thatithe aforementioned information was being made available to the Bureau and

On the basis of this information, we immediately instructed the

Washington Field and New York Offices to institute confidential inquiries with

appropriate Post Office officials to determine the feasibility of covering outgoing

correspondence from the U.s. to theu.s.s. R., looking toward picking up a

communication dispatched to the aiorementioned address.

On January 21, 1958, SAd Powers

of the New York Office called

advising that his preliminary inquiries at first disclosed that such coverage

could possibly be effected at LaGuardia Airfiela, Powers stated that he subsequently

received a caft from the Chief Post Office Inspector who told him that he would not

be able to make such arrangements and explained that something had happened in

Washington on a similar matter and that Bureau Headquarters should take up the

Amatter with Post Office Headquarters here in Washington. The Post Office

inspector said that it did not involve our agency and because of what was going

on in Washington at the present time, he just couldn't do it on his own.

Almost simultaneous with this advice, Mr. James Angleton of CIA

(approached our Liaison Agent, (Sam Papich)on a personal basis. He indicated

that if it were known within CLA that he was volunteering this information to the

Bureau, he would lose his job. Mr. Angleton stated it had come to the attention

mat we were making inquiries concerning the

coverage of mail to the U.S.S. Ry, and as a result CiA was expecting to receive

MEMO TO: MR. BOARDMAN

RE: COVERAGE OF MATI TO THE(U.S.S. R.)

and in view of the volume of material being sent from the U.S., their coverage

is an extensive and expensive operation. He indicated that they had to set up an

elaborate array of IBM machines to tally and tabulate the results. In addition

a complicated indexing procedure was involved, as well as complex scientific

examinations of the material. / He said two or three hundred CIA employees are

exclusively engaged on various facets of the coverage. Angleton also indicated

that the cost of the operation was well over a million dollars a year, He further

indicated that the coverage has been in existence in excess of a year and he

stated that the sole purpose for the coverage was to identify persons behind the

Iron Curtain who might have some ties in the U,S. and who could be approached

fin their countries as contacts and souroes for CIA. Angleton indicated that CLA

had successfully developed several sources through this means.

He stressed

the confidential nature of his information and stated that while other officials of

CIA more directly concerned with the coverage were expecting a visit from the

FB he was passing this along for our guidance.

It would appear that our inquiries of the Post Office officials in

New York have flushed out a most secret operation of CIA. The question

immediately arises as to whether CIA in effecting this coverage in New York

has invaied our jurisdiction. In this regard, it is believed that they have a

legitimate right in the objectives for which the coverage was set up, namely,

the development of contacts and sources of information behind the Iron Curtain,

and according to Angleton they have had some success: in this regard. At the

same time, there is an internal security objective here in which, because of

our responsibilities, we have a definite interest, namely, the identification of

illegal espionage agents who may be in the United States..

While recognizing

this interest, it is not believed that the Bureau should assume this coverage

because of the inherent dangers in the sensitive nature of it, its complexity,

size and expense. It is believed that we can capitalize on this coverage by

l pointing out to CIA our internal security objectives and holding them responsible

to share their coverage with us. Of course, we are not interested in the

identities of the numerous persons in this country legitimately corresponding

abroad. The Post Office has indicated there are approximately four thousand

items of correspondence to the U.S.S. R. each day. Angleton said they have not

Icome up with a microdot or secret message communication as yet.

ACTION:

1. On the basis of our inquiries conducted in New York, we are in

a position and should, through Liaison, approach Cla, informing them that it

has been indicated that their Agency has coverage of mail going to the J.s.s.R

We Should get from them the details of their coverage and explain our interest in

being furnished with the results of the coverage as it might effect internal security

CIA coverage of mail going to and coming from Russia

Our Liaison Agent

Gandy -

I determined that CIA began this coverage approximately a year and a half ago through

confidential arrangements made with postal authorities. Initially, this coverage

involved photographing of envelopes; these envelopes were not to be opened. The

envelopes were microfilmed and the names and addresses appearing thereon were

indexed with IBM equipment. Several months ago CIA began opening some of this mail,

microfilming the contents and indexing pertinent data therein. Approximately 250, 000

names have been indexed by CIA. Examination of certain of this mail for microdots and

secret writing has been made to a limited extent because the volume of mail has been too

humerous for the establishment of a practical system without delaying moverent of the

mail. CIA has advised that to date it has not discovered any microdots or secret writing

or information revealing evidence of Soviet intelligence operations in the United States.

Cla has also advised that this program has not reached its full potential, but that its

system of opening mail is rapidly increasing. CIA has expressed a willingness to

Lurera, to ay information obtaine from this coverage which we feel would be of

interest to us.

An analysis has been made of CIA capabilities as revealed to the Liaison Agent

and it is believed we should request that CIA furnish us information of the following

types, both that which has been received in the past and that which they will obtain inc

the future

Reach

1)

All correspondence of a suspicious nature, such as that containing double

All correspondence indicating that the Soviets may be utilizing a hostage

re: COVERAGE OF MAIL TO THE U.S.S.P.)

With regard to the above coverage, it is believed desirable that Liaison make

arrangements for us to review at CIA any material of this nature and we will then

select that which appears to warrant investigation and then make appropriate checks.

This procedure will eliminate.having CIA sending us a bunch of worthless material with

the possible expectation that we will be running out leads for them. It is believed this

arrangement can be wacked out with CIA in a proper fashion.

In addition to the above it is believed the following arrangements can be

effected with CIA:

Place stops against names and addresses of individuals possibly presently

engaged in Soviet espionage to determine if they are in correspondence with U.S. S. R

This. would include a check of the back traffic on these individuals also. We would, of

course, make these stops on a highly selective basis.

Request CIA to place stops against addresses in Soviet Russia believed by the

Bureau to be mail drops or suspected mail drops. (It should be noted that we already

have placed a stop with ClA against the name and address of K. S. Smirnov, Central

Post Office, Vladimir, U.S.S. Re

2. This explanatory memorandum constitutes HUNTER Report

#1.

Future disseminations will be numbered consecutively.

3. In submitting possible traces on individuals of interest to

you, reports will be submitted in the following form:

a. I the individual named in the intercept appears to be

identical with the individual of interest to you, you will be furnished

a reproduction of the exterior, and of the contents if the item has been

• opened.

b. If the individual named in the intercept is only possibly

identical with the individual of interest to you, only machine run

listing of the items will be submitted. In such cases a reproduction

of the exterior and of the contents, if the item has been opened, will

be available upon request.

4. In order to facilitate your reading of machine run entries,

there follows an explanation of the various types of replies which you

will receive in connection with requests.

A hypothetical request for

any addressee in the U.S.. of mail from P. KROVAN, whose location

Is believed to be in/Moscow, might result in the following reply:

This reply has the following meaning:

"A" has no present meaning. All numbers are now preceeded by

"A" only to allow for future additional classifications. None are

presently contemplated.

"57COS'is the date of intercept, namely: "57" is the year. "C"

indicates the month. The code key for months is set out as Enclosure 1.

"05" is the day of the monta. Thus, "57C05" is 5 March 1957.

The group "C3325" is our own internal filing number.

The "Name In entry identifies the correspondent inside the uss.

The asterisk in "Re" column indicates that KROVAN sent the letter.

The entry in "Loc"(ation) column indicates the area or city inside

che soviet Union Irom which the letter was mailed. In this case it was

mailed from the western section of Ukrainian SSR. The code key

used for this column is set out in Enclosure 2. This code key is to

be used for all items prior to 1 January 1958, on which date a 4-place

code was instituted in order to designate more precisely the localities

with the USSR. A copy of this new code is enclosed as Eaclosure 3.

The "Name Out"' entry identifies the correspondent outside the

(USSR)

In both the "Name In" and "Name Out"' columns, the last or

family name is listed first.

The absence of an asterisk in the "Ref"' column after EVOSWA

indicates that she is the recipient of the letter.

The entry in the second "Loc"(ation) column indicates the state of

the U.S. (in this case, New Jersey) to which the letter was addressed.

The code key used for this column is set out in Enclosure 4. You

will note that some 3-digit entries indicate large cities within a state,

thus KO indicates New York State and KOA indicates New York City.

For your convenience an alphabetical list of the states with their code

indicator is set out in Enclosure 5.

The absence of an "X" in the "Ban" column means that the letter

was not opened and that only the exterior is recorded in our files.

5. Since the hypothetical request was for mail tromP. KROVANy

who is believed to be located in Moscow only the listing as set out

above would be furnished, since it would not appear that Paraskoviya

located in the western section of the Ukrainian SSR) is

otherwise available, you may believe that KROVAN may be identical

with the individual of interest to you, you need reference only the

HUNTER report number and request the exterior photographs of

item No. A57C05C3325, which will be reproduced from the original

film and made available to you.

6. If the bypothetical request is for any mail from the Soviet

Union to ROse ESTERSON, who residos in Chicago, the reply might

be as follows:

A57DZ3U 57D18 (AVRUNINA, Vera) (*) AAA (ESTERSON, Rose)

KKB X

The difference in this listing from that previously illustrated is as follows:

• 11' is our internal identifying designator, The first date is the date

of the intercept.

The second date is the date of the communication

inside the letter. The "X" under the "Ban" column indicates the letter

was opened. Again this indicator would indicate only a possible identi-

fication since KKB under "Loc" indicates California. In this instance

upon request, identifying the HUNTER report number and referencing

both A57D23U and 57Dl8 numbers, the outer envelopes and their con-

tents will be reproduced and furnished to you.

7. Normal service of either of the above requests will be 24 hours.

In an emergency we could service the request in a few minutes.

8. Is your first request had been for KROVAN, or P. KROVAN,

or Paraskoviya KROVAN, located in the western section of the

Ukrainian SSR; you would have initially received the photograph of

9. In order to insure most efficient servicing of your request,

it is suggested that you submit trace requests as follows: List the

last name first with any known first and given games or initials, and

address including state, city and street, if knowa. If an exact address

is not known, a probable state or section will be helpful but is not

required, The same would apply to the(USSR The above should be

at this address to whom the questioned communication might be

addressed, their names should also be given. For record purposes!

and in order to facilitate our answers to your request, would you in

turn number each card as HUNTER Request No. -

10. On each request will you also indicate whether the request

is for a one-time check or whether the name should be put on the

Watch List. If the latter, please indicate the duration of the Watch

List, i.e. 30, 60, 90 days, or "until cancelled". If a Watch List is

are to be informed immediately when a hit is made and prior to the

receipt of the letter by the addressee.

11. It is possible to make a special machine run of the names

of all correspondents either addressor, addressee, or both, from

combinations that could be run, such as all letters mailed in Florida

We have always considered the product from PROJECT HUNTER

as valuable to our investigative interests. In this connection,

it has provided us with the identities of Americans in contact

with Soviet exchange students in the United states who offer some

potential as informants regarding the Soviet students' activities.

we know from highly confidential sources that a proportion oi

of the major Soviet] Intelligence Services. We know also that

many of the exchange students will subsequently be posted to the

The Soviet Union is currently building up the number

We anticipate that PROJECT HUNTER would be valuable

in providing

leads for any necessary coverage of these people. (5)

With the relaxation of tensions between the U. s. and

the Ussel the volume of correspondence has obviously increased.

We do not currently know what that volume is.

of the number received from 2/58 until. 12/60. on 3/9/61 CIl advised

would probably increase the Hunter Report volume to us by 20%; however,

From the above figures it appears this increase in volume is far greaten

This is to advise you that on 10/31/62 representatives of

this Bureau conferred with ClA representatives James Hunt, John Mertz

and Thomas Chalmers at. CIA concerning "Project Hunter."

At this

conference. our observations concerning Hunter material furnished since

our last conference on 2/13/62 were given CIA.

In addition, ve advised

CIA specifically of certain Hunter items which were of no interest

to us and of certain Hunter items which were of interest to us. " These

items were set forth in memorandum form and furnished to CIA; a copy

of same is attached.

CIA advised that Its "Hunter-Don' coverage was being

operated seven days a week until November 15. This concentrated

coverage is for the purpose of determining if there, is any illegal

agent traffic. After November 15 all Hunter coverage can be expected

to be reduced until after the Christmas mail rush has subsided.

The CIA representatives were very pleased with our analysis

of the Hunter material received and with the attention afforded it

by us. They are very cooperative in that they are willing to focus

their attention on any particular phase of coverage we suggest for

our own benefit. For CIA's interest we furnished them a copy of the

attached memorandum of our analysis of typical information furnished

by (Bureau Informant 200) o1 interest to us.

For approximately one month beginning in February

1963,

Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had coverage of mail destined to

(Cuba) which was funneled through New York City from approximately

one-half of the United States.

The results of this highly confidential

project were furnished us under the code ("Hunter-Vince" through

special arrangements made with CIA. The project has been temporarily

as to its reinstitution based on the results achieved.

During the period the coverage was in effect, we received

94 items and opened 15 new cases based on the material.

While no

specitic data was developed indicating clandestine messages were

being transmitted, we know that one of the illegal. Cuban agent networks

has plans for mail drops in the New York City area, and this coverage il

could conceivably lead us to these drops in the future. We have

evaluating whether that program should be continued. It is believed

we should do so in this instance.

ACTION:

It you approve, the attached memorandum containing a 'o

summary of the action taken by us as a result of the Hunter-Vince

coverage will be furnished ClA by liaison for assistance of CIA in

evaluating whether the program should be continued.
