I want to express my appreciation to you personally.
and through you to Howard Osborn and the other of your as-
sociates who contributed so effectively to the visit of the
President on Friday. The arrangements were flawless; the
security first-class without being intrusive. I am well
aware of the amount of work and planning which went into
the successful outcome. I particularly want to commend the
good sense and judgment which prevailed throughout. It is
easy to push people around. It is difficult to take proper
precautions and at the same time zako everyone feel as though
it were his or her party. Thank you very much. Well donel
