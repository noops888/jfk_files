Memorandum to Mr.

Re:

Senstudy 75

During the period of these investigations it was

determined that Embassy of Israel officials recruited U. S.

scientists for employment in Israel, and extensive liaison

was

established with individuals within U. S. scientific, political,

academic and industrial communities.

As an example, Hermoni

developed close contact with Dr. Zalman Mordecai Shapiro, Director

of Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation, Apollo,

Pennsylvania, a firm which processes uranium 235 for nuclear

The basis of the discontinuation of the sensitive

technical

source coverage on the Israeli Embassy in 1972 was

a U.S. State Department directive. (5)

During this period it was also determined that the

IIS was attempting to penetrate the United Nations (UN) and

Arab diplomatic establishments in New York City.

An informant

of the New York Office, who previously engaged in intelligence

activities in the Middle East for the Israelis between 1955 and

1960 while vorking at the UN, was recontacted by Israeli intel-

ligence in August, 1968, while visiting Israel.

This informant

had access at the

extremely sensitive information from the

office of the Secretary General.

Israeli intelligence had

directed him to obtain and furnish, through a mail drop in

Belgium, interoffice communications between the Secretary General

of the

UN and his undersecretaries, and information regarding

the Middle East, particularly relating to Arab matters. (5)

In May, 1958, another informant of the New York Office,

who previously resided in the Middle East and was active in the

Igyptian intelligence

sign a peace

in Italy.
