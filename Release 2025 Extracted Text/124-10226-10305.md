reflected that 1967-68 Florida license 6WW-6273 was

issued October 18, 1967 to HENRY FEINTUCH, M.D., for a

1968 Cadillac coupe, Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)

J8123239.

The records of the Palm Beach County Credit

Bureau, the West Palm Beach Police Department and the

Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office examined July 31,

1968, failed to reflect any identifiable reference to

FEINTUCH®

JAMES L. DISMUCKES, Schooley-Cadillac, advised

SA ROBERT W. WISEMAN on July 31, 1968, that instant

car was sold October 18, 1967 to DI. FEINTUCH of 3050

Lincoln Road, Miami Beach, Florida.

This was a telephone

call sale, for cash, and the customer was referred

by one EMIL MORTON, 5646 North Bay Road, Miami Beach,

Florida. There is

nothing further available in the

company records.

MM 92-1870

New Kensington, Pennsylvania, and that the front name for

was NORMAN ROTHMAN.

SAM and GABRIEL

MANNARINO are reported members of

the LCN.

On November 16, 1955, MM T-12 advised that SANTO,

TRAFFICANTE

JR. had taken over the Sans Souci Nightclub

in Havana, Cuba,

and left ROTHMAN in as manager.

On October 10, 1955, CARL HACKER furnished the

Albany Office of the FBI with

the following information:

He is former international reppesentative of the

Hotel and Restaurant Employees & Bartenders International

Union.

Information which HACKER has furnished has

been

accurate and reliable.

HACKER stated he was sent to Miami Beach in May,

1954, as International Representative to take over Local

255, which local was in trusteeship.

He stated he was approached by one NORMIE ROTHMAN

and ROTHMAN told him that it was necessary for him and

his associates to control the political situation in Miami

Beach. ROTHMAN

propositioned HACKER as follows:

ROTHMAN would be appointed International Repre-

sentative of the Hotel Workers Union, and three organizers,

of ROTHMAN's designation, would be appointed in Local 255.

These individuals were to be on the Union payroll. ROTHMAN

and these organizers would then organize for the Hotel.

Workers Union in Miami Beach.

ROTHMAN stated that he and

his associates had "something" on every hotel operator in

Miami Beach and they would be forced to permit him to

organize their workers.

ROTHMAN indicated that he and

his associates would benefit in that they would have the

sizeable block of votes which could be controlled through

the union.

ROTHMAN indicated at the end of a one-year

organizational period he and his associates would expect

a fixed annual contributtion from the Hotel Workers Union.

minimini-sita:

HACKER said he listened to the proposition only

to ascertain the extent of ROTHMAN's interest in muscling

in on the Hotel Workers Union.

He said he then presented

this proposition to JACK WEINBURGER, formerly Organizational

Secretary, now General Secretary of

the Union.

WE INBURGER

stated that this must be discussed with ED MILLER, who

agreed with the proposal, except the appointment of ROTHMAN

as International Representative.

MILLER indicated he would

get around this somehow. In December, 1954, HACKER was

telephonically contacted by ED MILLER

and instructed to turn

the affairs of Local 255 to one ALBERT BERLIN, a former

associate of the gangster element. This appointment in

HACKER's opinion indicated ROTHMAN had gotten to MILLER,

apparently through ROGER LEBENNER, Business Agent for Local

133 of the Hotel Workers Union, and that MILLER was working

with ROTHMAN.

HACKER stated he could never work with

MILLER and resigned on December 13, 1954. HACKER stated

that in April, 1955, the first hotel in Miami Beach was

struck by the Hotel

Workers Union, and the strike which

presently involves 22 hotels is still going on. The Hotel

Workers Union is pouring $120,000 a month into this strike.

He can only conclude the hotel operators did not accede to

ROTHMAN's shakedown.

He is convinced, however, that ROTHMAN

made the attempt, and that MILLER is cooperating with him.

On July 30, 1956, AL MANHEIM advised that ABE

GOODMAN was in the bolita business in Cuba with ELI QUAIN

Miami, Florida, authorized the seizure of this equipment;

and the equipment was

over to the US Marshal on August 7, 1956. Prosecution of
