These assurances will preclude any neaningful CIA

notion'on a phased basis to provoke a revolt inside Cubr, sinue

unless there are major changes in operational and Internal con-

ditlons in Cuba, such a revolt 11 provoked would be totally

destroyed by Cuban counteractios 1ns matter of hours or, at

mont oN dare antone supported by a major Walted States

Military comnitment.. In addition, the son-iavasion assurances

as a practical natter uill. preclude invading Cuba on the pretext

of a contrived provocation such as an attack on Guantanano.

C. CIA operations lavolving a high noise level and a

diatinct.olenent.of attributability, particularly paranilitary,

guerrilläi and commando type operations vill be unacceptable

as a matter of policy.

D. The Castro-communist regime will remals in power for

, the indefinite future. with lts security and control apparatus

rolatively intact and with the capability not only of crushing

unsupported resistance activity, but of making operational

conditiong in Cuba

Increasingly d1ff1cult. While it 18

possible that recent and future developments including the

Soviet action in removing the offensive weapons from Cuba may

serve to weaken and discredit Castro, there is as yet no barr

indication that the control of the Castro-communist reglne over

Cuba bas been substantially weakenod.

I.. The Ualted States assurances of no Invasion and no

support olian Invasion will, 1n effect, constitute giving tr

Castro and his regime a certain degree of sonctuary. This will.
