MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, External Activities Branch, SSD

SUBJECT

: Manuscript by David Phillips

1. The following passages are a compilation of

observations made by the SSU regarding Mr. Phillips'

manuscript.

The comments are by no means a total list

of reservations concerning the submitted chapters but

those noted from the perspective of the SSU.

2.

In general the undersigned felt somewhat enlight-

ened but rather uncomfortable in reading the submitted

manuscript.

This uneasy feeling appears to be based upon

two impressions.

effort on the part of Mr. Phillips to

CIA.

Regrettably, as

is often the case when one attempts

o clarity and present the real tacts, there is a possibility

of further

compounding

a confused and

ambiguous circumstance.

Because of the various ramifications of the activities of the

Agency, the SSU gained the feeling that more was lost rather

than won in Mr.

Phillips'

efforts.

The second disarming im-

pression is that because an individual has proved to be an

effective and successful CIA operations officer, there is no

clear-cut assurance that he can achieve the same success as an

The SSU was continually pained by Mr. Phillips' efforts

to employ certain techniques often seen in spy fictions.

The

problem with author Phillips is that he is not writing fiction

and has been identified as a former CIA employee with over

25 years in intelligence service.

Although Mr. Phillips

labored to introduce some humor into his manuscript, some of

his anecdotes appear to be in bad taste.

3. The following comments are codified to complement

those parts of the manuscript reviewed in this reading.

Epilogue

Page 6: Although Mr. Phillips makes a considerable effort

to conceal the true identity of "Abe"

, there is a question

as to whethel the fact that two cables were sent from Head-

quarters to (Chile) in May 1973, and if this manuscript is the

proper vehicle to surface such

information.

Page 13: Mr. Colby is quoted by the author indicating

certain information revealing complications between

Mr. Colby and Dr. Kissinger.

In addition to breaching

personal confidences,

the author contradicts what he had

indicated earlier to

be an intent to permit Mr. Colby to

speak for himself.

Page 14-18: Mr. Phillips again refers to "Abe" and

his evaluations of the various congressional select comnittees

investigating the CIA.

In eftect these comments are suggestive

of Agency judgments and evaluation regarding the conduct and

success of the investigative efforts às well as other person-

alities critical of the Agency.

Page 21: There is a serious question raised regarding

the author connecting Ernest Hemmingway and the Havana Chief

of Station implying the prospect of a professional as well as

personal affiliation.

Page 48: If it is in fact correct, has it ever been

officially acknowledged that a U.S. citizen, a businessman

in Havana, implied by the author

as being a

CIA agent was

executed? Note: This chapter is replete with a profusion

of illustrations of tradecraft and operational activities

too numerous to set forth.

The

best interests of the Agency are not served nor for that

matter the interests of Mr. Buckley and Mr. Hunt are not

served by such revelations.

Page

4-6: The SSU believes it is totally unwise to

have the mission and organization of

the Mexico City Station

outlined

as explicitly as contained in these pages.

Page 5-6: The above observation is further complicated

by the author's remarks

regarding operations levied against

the Cuban Embassy in Mexico.

Page 8: The SSU further challenges the information set

forth on this page regarding the biographic details of

Mr. Winston Scott's assignments in Cuba, (London), Eur Division

and Mexico City.

15-8

Page 15: The undersigned does not believe the content

of the information set forth regarding the Agency's procedures

associated with the purchasing of scotch liquor.

He is implying

things which may perhaps have been unique to that station but

certainly has not been a worldwide practice.

Mr. Phillips'

anecdote about the prospects of the Agency printing counterfeit

tax stamps and the details involved in such planning, even

though perhaps presented in jest would not be viewed

as such

in the eyes of many individuals in the United States today.

Page 16: Because Philip Agee has revealed the secret of

the camera operation in his book, is it necessary for Mr. Phillips

to repeat and in effect collaborate what a diseffected employee

of the Agency is purporting?

From a friendly alumnus of the

Agency, this serves as a verification of Agee's statements and

provides a violation of sources and methods of this organization.

Page 18-19: Pursuing the aspect of sources and methods,

the SSU questions the author's anecdote regarding the identif-

ication and employment techniques of the material "why me".

It would seem that in so far as any chemical or technical

devices of this nature used by the Organization should not be

surfaced in a book such as this.

The specifics associated with the Cuban

Missle Crisis of 1962 involving former Director John McCone

and others are subject to strong question as to whether they

should be included in this text.

Again, what is provided

by MI. Phillips in this manuscript is drawn from such personal

experiences realized in his Agency duties.

Page 33-35:

The SSU takes exception to the information

presented regarding "walk-ins" based upon the same rationale

as contained above. It also flirts with the concerns of

sources and methods of this Agency.

is synonymous with the problem of beer being available to the

Secret Service when they are on assignment with the President.

Page 31: Throughout the manuscript the author in his

narration confirms the fact that CIA has stations located around

the world and in his writing procedes to verify the location of

these stations.

The comments relating to where he was assigned

and where others in the Agency have been or are assigned, not

only relates to the South America area but on this page the

author confirms the fact that there was a CIA station

in

12-32 Brazzaville.) Other than in the change in name there is no

effort made

to dispel the prospect that the station continues.

Page 42-44: Although it is a most timely subject,

information regarding any U.S. Government effort to assassinate

Castro is

highly explosive.

Mr. Phillips is reporting information

which he has privy to as a direct result of his Agency exper-

iences. These should not be contained in this book.

Page 44: Although (Camp Peary)has unfortunately been

identified

as a CIA facility, is it necessary for the author

to reintorce media articles regarding this establishment by

spelling

out the cover background and other "chapter and

regarding firearms training, counterterrorism training should

be avoided.

instance CIA involvement in Chile.

The information contained in these pages are volatile and

should not be included in such a commercial venture.

Any

such information is liable for quotations out of context

warping or reinforcing the involvement that the Agency did

have in the political activities of Chile.

Page 25:

For the first time the SSU was made aware of

the daughter of a CIA officer who was stripped naked and held

with a knife at her throat by political assassins.

If this

is in fact a true statement, I question the value of such an

inclusion in this

text particularly in light of the terrorism

problems that this Agency and other elements of the U.S.

Government are experiencing around the world.

Page 27: The statement the author makes with regard to

promotion to GS-17 is not correct.

Page 31: I believe that Office of Communications should

be consulted on the entire section relating to communications,

communications personnel and the Office of Communications,

however, the ssu raises the question concerning the inclusion

of teletype decoding speeds on this particular page.

Chapter 10

Note: Chapter 10 continues in the same vein as all of the

other chapters.

• It further reinforces the earlier remarks that

the more one

tries to explain and clarify a point the more

confusing it becomes.

The remarks contained in pages 23 and

24 regarding Chile are illustrative of this.

In summary, the ssU joins those who feel that this

oook would better have been left unwritten. It is a text

replete with names, details, operational information and

close personal

privileged information based upon the author's

assignments which has been rendered into a commercial version

of Mr. Phillips'

affiliation with this agency for over 25

This manuscript reinforces

the difficulty of a retired

operations officer to develop a non-fiction text which is

attractive to the public but does not contain information

regarding intelligence personalities, organization and sources

and methods.
