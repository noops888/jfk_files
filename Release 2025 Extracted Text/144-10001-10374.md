--

The Ecuadoran Military Junta would like to sponsor the

granting of the Nobel prize to the deceased President KENNEDY

in consideration of his great work for world peace.

Please inform me immediately of the qualifications and

conditions that are

required for such granting, and sound out

discreetly the form in which to put this strong desire of the

Ecuadoran Government.

In case there is the possibility that a specific demarche

would

succeed, let me know the proper way in which to make it

official.
