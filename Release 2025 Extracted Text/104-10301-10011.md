The Special Investigations Group Of the CI Staff (CI/SIG)

CI/SIG (the Special Investigations Group) did not exist

prior to the establishment of the CI Staff in early 1955.

Its

major functions as described in CSI No. 70-1 of March 1955 are

much more modest than the functions ascribed to it in a write-up

by the Staff in early 1973. The 1955 description of functions

is as follows:

"Special Investigation Unit

"Major Functions

"Performs the CI investigation and analysis of any

known or potential

security leak in the Clandestine

organization, whether

In performing this function, maintains alone soing

and (2) the cover of personnel.

relations with the Security

Office, the latter being

primarily concerned in such cases from Agency

security rather than an operational security stand-

poirt."

By 1973 the description of tasks which had been assigned

to CI/SIG or which they had absorbed during the course of

events over a period of nearly two decades provides a much

broader range of functions and responsibilities.

They are listed

as follows:

"CI/Special Investigations Group

assigned by the C/CI."

The first chief of the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) (as

it was called in CSI NO. 70-1) was Birch O'Neal, a former FBI

officer who had transferred to CIA after World War II,* In the

mid-fifties SIG had rather slim picking and appears to have spent

most of its"time investigating various aspects of the ECMÁYPONLY

complex (the (Boris Morros case) as it affected US interests based

on information the Agency acquired from foreign sources. Then in

1962 SIG received its biggest shot in the arm with the defection

of Golitsyn who brought with him several dozen leads to American

citizens including some supposedly in CIA. The handling of these

leads was assigned to SIG by Angleton, including the information

emanating from Golitsyn, which related to foreign countries.

Thus

O'Neal and his assistant, Jean Evans, played a major role in

directing the handling of the Golitsyn leads (or "Serials" as

Angleton invariably called them).. The activity continued through-

out the sixties reaching its apex in the period 1964-65 when the

HONETOL investigations (of CIA staff officers) was at its most

Office of the Chief (including two special assistants and a

Secretariat) the Staff was composed of seven "Divisions" and

four "Groups.")

For fiscal year 1958 the CI Staff budget was $f, 650,000.

The sum of SI, 800,00g was allotted for Fiscal Year 1959, and

$2,000,000 was to be requested for 1960. Specific figures were

quoted in the appropriate sections for projects or support,

such as travel. Otherwise the budget was almost solely for

salaries of Staff personnel.

The survey next gave brief attention to deception, agreeing

that it had to be carefully compartmented and that it best

belonged in the CI Staff. On the subject of the Special Investi-

gation Unity however, the survey took its first serious exception

to the organization and operation of the Staff stating:

"Hence,

in order not to contaminate a senior staff

(C1 Staff) with Agency employee investigation and/or

exploitation

this should be done by individuals with

The survey tean took special note of the Projects Branch of

mail opening project.

How it was operated

and viewed in 1959 is not without interest

in view of its subsequent role in the "Family Jewels" issue when

it was revealed to the Rockefeller and Church Committees.

versus area division prerogative in the conduct of operations.

Noting that there might have been some immediate reasons for the

CI Staff to take on operational aspects in its efforts to increase

CI activity, nevertheless it concluded these reasons were not

necessarily based on the best operational and organizational pro-

cedures and methods. The normal staff functions, the survey

opined, could be carried out effectively with a much smaller but

highly experienced staff whose impact and counsel would more

favorably be received by the operating elements of the DD/P. The

team also concluded that there had been insufficient attention

given to penetrating hostile intelligence organizations and

recommended that:

"Chief, CI direct the efforts of the CI Staff: toward

the development of programs for

the aggressive pursuit of

penetration activity against hostile intelligence services."

In a forward to the report, the Inspector General of the day,

Lyman Kirkpatrick, directed special attention to

one particular

aspect of CI work.

"The Special Investigation Division assists the

Office of Security in using DD/P assets to trace leads

concerning ClA employees.

had written a provocative analysis that found Nosenko bona

fide and challenged as incorrect the Monster Plot

assessmenta to the contrary. Even more provocative, he had

provided a copy directly to then DDCI Richard Helms when

stymied within the soviet Division in promoting his view.

Kalaris first learned of this well after McCoy joined the

staff, when McCoy himself told him. Angleton, on the other

hand, was certainly not unaware of this part of Mccoy's

background, and it is likely that he and Rocca and Miler

interpreted Kalaris's selection of McCoy as evidence that

Kalaris was out to discredit them.

Kalaris, originally having been summoned home to take

over temporarily until a replacenent for Angleton could be

found, had a title in the beginning as "Acting Chief,

CIOPS." In March, Nelson told him, "we haven't found

anybody yet," and as time went on it looked increasingly as

if he and colby were not going to find anyone. But by this

tine Kalaris was becoming intrigued with what he was doing,

and with the potential of the job. He went back to brasilia) o

to see his fanily in late March, and when he returned he

told Nelson he would take the job on a pernanent basis.

In

June, the "Acting" was dropped and Kalaris became chief,

CIOPS.

What Kalaris Found...

The StatE of Affaire

As he looked around, Kalaris found what struck hin as a

desolate situation. Mountains of traffic were coning in to

the staff, but none of it seemed to be of much importance.

The staff had no relationship with the Soviet Division or

any of the other geographic divisions. If the divisions had

any significant cases, kalaris was unaware of them because

the divisions were giving hin nothing of substance. Mecoy's

arrival in the staff made this picture unmistakably clear

made him privy to virtually all the division's sensitive

cases, he was able to tell kalarie what he was missing on

the sE front.

It also before long became evident that there was an

element of a two-way street in this situation. Soviet-East

European cases were discovered in CI Staff files that the

area divisions had never been informed of or had only

limited information about. These included such cases as

Angleton. They had been in their jobs for a number of years

and were well settled into their way of doing things. so

well in fact that: most had given up hope of ever going

anywhere else or accomplishing anything new.

compartmentation was a way of life, and management was

remote from the rank and file. Kalaris was appalled to

learn that his chief of support, who had worked in the staff

for four or five years, had never met Angleton; he had only

seen him fron a distance. The overall atmosphere seemed to

Kalaris to be conditioned by doublethink and mirrors.

Compartmentation in the Angleton staff had been carried

to such extremes, however, as to become counterproductive.

With Angleton not disposed to be forthcoming with his

successor, and Rocca and Miler taking their lead fron him

land Hood already having left the staff and the Agency some

months earlier), it was difficult for the kalaris team to

find out what the staff had been doing. Like the blind men

and the elephant, the personnel below the top leadership had

never been exposed to more than their own narrow slice of

staff activities, and accordingly even with the best of will

they were limited in what they were able to tell the new

management. The MORINE case (see below) provided a vivid

illustration of this point.

Mccoy, with his soviet Division background, was

particularly struck at the almost total absence of soviet

expertise in the staff. There was no Russian language

capability and no realistic area knowledge, and what

experience there was in Soviet matters was dated and

limited. This was the case not only in R&A, but in the

Operations Group as well.

search of insidious foreign sponsorship, in a front page

story by seymour Hersh in The New York Times on 22 December

Angleton's retirement, and led to establishment in 1975 of

the Rockefeller Commission on CIA Activities in the United

States, and the Church (Senate) and Pike (House) connittees

to investigate CIA and its activities. Both these programo

had been CI Staff responsibilities. CIA was receiving

a trap unfolding in front of him if he mishandled the

matter. The deliverer could be expected to tell Angleton

ways to exploit any ill conceived decisions.

After due

the Postmaster General undex cover of a letter explaining

the situation.

The Postnaster General in turn sent a copy

of this letter, along with the actual mail and a letter of

his own, to each addressee. The Postmaster General's letter

referred to "apparent interception and acknowledged

retention of this mail by the CIA," and described the natter

as "a serious violation of your rights" and "abuse of the

the recipients wrote letters

to the DCI asking whether CIA had dossiers on them.

In April a folder with some/ MORINE material was found

in an RiA safe and delivered to McCoy, who, believing that

he had stumbled upon an overlooked vein of

counterintelligence gold, brought the matter to Kalaris's

Angleton, but this was not apparent at the time. The

meanwhile, advice from the Hill and the lawyers supplied the

thousands of files in the Angleton staff that had been

created and maintained according to criteria, e.g.,

anticonmunign, that did not fit these guidelines.

Establishment of a guideline that counterintelligence

files were not to be established and maintained solely on

the basis of items in the press provided for elimination of

a large percentage of the material that had been collected

by the Angleton staft, prominent anong this being files on

HenrY Kissinger, W. Averell Harrinan, and some 30-40 US

congressmen, among others. Common sense provided other

working guidelines such as, for example, the simplistic role

of thumb: if a file has some linkage to reality, retain it;

if not, destroy it. People fron RID were brought in to help

decide what should go into the overall records system, and

what did not belong there, Some of them effectively noved

into the staff. And they were not the only outsiders to do

this. In July 1975 the Department of Justice sent some

lawyers to review the HILINGUAL material, and when they

discovered that there were 27 boxes of it in one of the

staff vaults it was decided that the best place for them to

do their work would be right there. Three dests were set up

for them in the vault.

It was important that this be recognized and the files and

suspicions appropriately dealt with. Julian for a laujer

by education who joined the staff in late summer 1975, was

assigned to study these files. A procedure was developed

whereby he reviewed each one by one, and prepared a summary

of its contents. This went forvard to Kalaris with, in each

instance, a reconmendation on the cover sheet for

disposition. On file alter file these cover sheets ended up

saying the same thing; that the file had been revieved,

that the conclusion had been reached that there was nothing

of merit in it, and the file should be destoyed. The review

of the file on Richard Kovich, for example, which was eight

pages long, was dated 22 December 1975.* Kalaris,

concurring, sent it to ADDO Blee with a handwritten note

that the naterial in this case would be packaged and held

with instructions that it should be destroyed as soon as the

senate released CIA from its embargo on destruction, and

that the funnary neno and cover sheet would constitute the

only future record. The HONETOL files received steady but

not priority attention. It took somewhat over a yeat for

Fox to make his way through all of them. Nothing of merit

was found in any of them.

A special approach was developed to get the MORINE! data

into central indices. As a result of the conpartmentation

applied to MORINE in the Angleton staff, much of the

existing MORINE infornation was squirreled away and not

immediately appreciated. The rejuvenated exploitation

program produced a flood of ZRTAPPY correspondence with

field stations, but this was slow to yield indexable

material. It was not until the end of 1975 that a focused

People Responssbilities

The Kalaris staff inherited responsibility for a

handful of defectors and certain contract personnel who had

been working for the Angleton stall. This responsibility

was not particularly welcomed, but it had to be dealt with.

The defectors were Golitsyn, Nosenko, Dexyabin, and

[Basevorov, and a former soman an intalligence officer by the

name of Constantin Dumitrachescu, also known as SHRIVOT/ 1]

The soviets were well known, at least by reputation, to the

surprise. They had never heard of him.t

--In the eyes of some who knew hin, Angleton viewed

hinself more as chief of an operational entity than of a

staff. Few gave him high marks as an elfective staff, as

opposed to operations, officer. His secret travels in

Western Europe, not to mention to Israel, to meet with

senior liaison officials with whom he had developed

confidential relationships constituted a form of independent

operational

activity. The proposal, ultimately stillborn,

in 1965 for Angleton to develop special counterintelligence

units in Vietnam** displayed certain parallels with his

conduet of counterintelligence

abroad as Chief of the CI

staff in the way in

units for Vietnam

were nodeled

after SCI units employed by

Angleton began his intelligence career. Perhaps those early

experiences shaped in some way Angleton's later preference

for conducting counterintelligence--by himself, without

involvement of the area divisions and stations.
