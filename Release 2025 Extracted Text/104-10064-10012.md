5.

BEHGIREN has engaged

in a number of propaganda actions,

and participated in inter-

national anti-Viotnam Var activities:

It has tried to co

operate with certain front activities in Japan controlled by

the JCP, most notably the Japan

Comnittee to Investigate Har

Crines in Vietnam

which culminated in the Tokyo

Court of last august,

but has been soundly and rudely rebuffed

by the JCD.

In spite of this, BEHEIRSN bas churned along at

its own pace, with a continuing series of ant1-Viatnan war

sctions, most of then related in some way to the American

pacifist novement.

In this regard, ERFEIREN has succeeded in

cornering a virtual monopoly on Japanese contacts with the u.s.

pacifist movements,

and has effectually capitalized on this to

promote its own action program.

The case of the four deserting

sailors, while an apparent lucky windfall for BElEIREN, only

points up the fact that BEECIREN, through past organizational

wori and pronotional activities, was "johnny-on-the-spot",

ready and capable (unique in Japan in this regard) to take

the ball and run with 1t. BElEIREN ran all the way in this

case and scored its most notable success since it was organized.

(Attachment 2 is a listing of BECIREN's more notable activitios

since its founding.

Attachnent 3 is a partlal listing of

American and other

foreign persons known to have been in

B. The Case of the Four Sailor Deserters and BOHEIREN.

1:

How It Started:

The consensus of all available overt

medis material,

with

no recorded dissent,

indicates that the

four sailors voluntarily left their ship,

went Alch, and ended

up wallowing around Tokyo's hippio-land.

Precisoly that personal

grievances prompted the four to embark on this mis-adventure is

not yet known. But, up to this point, the four could fairly be

categorized as misguided youngsters, gone astray in i foreign

land, and due to get slapped back in line with traditional

Navy justice when they finally decided to stop the lun and go

back to the ship.: So far, this nade their cases far from

unique.

With this reporter on the question of the four American seamen who deserted

At the interview held on the 19th,

Professor YOUNG clarified that the Peace for Vietnam Association (Beheiren,

with Makoto ODA acting as its representative) contacted an anti-war organiza-

and I also once served as special assistant to Ambassador REISCHAUER.

Professor; The desertion was completely the decision of these four

What were the movements of the foux after they deserted?

Professor; On the night of the 23rd, two days before the Intrepid

- Where are the four seamen. now, and where are they planning to go?

Professor: I am certain that the four of'them were still in Japan,

up until the lith, the day I left for home.

However, they already knew

fully well that it was not possible for them to obtain asylum in Japan.

They even said that "we will propably have to go to some third nation,

which is neutral." (The public security authorities judge that the four

What do the parents think of this action taken by their sons?

A certain television station asked the nother.of one of

the four men about her son's life.. This mother was completely perplexed;
