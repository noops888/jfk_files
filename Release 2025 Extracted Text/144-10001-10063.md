EGYPTIAN REACTION TO PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S MURDER

FR Cairo: --

TO Rome: Foreign Ministry

Msg NI:

649

Signed: MAGISTRATI.

Also in Cairo the murder of President KENNEDY has made a

very deep impression.

President NASSER sent the widow a moving and significant

telegram. Actually, and especially very recently, KENNEDY

appeared, particularly as far as Egypt is concerned, a strong

defender of the necessity of the continuation of American economic

aid in favor of Egypt and this was in spite of the active

anti-Nasserian campaign [8G] by the Senate majority in Washington.

Concerning the attitude of the press and concerning

responsibility for the murder, the position (B val is) still

(B val uncertain) but there is no lack of [SM/G] comments

tending to indicate that KENNEDY was murdered (B val mainly)

for the cause of racial equality and for his actions in favor

of the colored people.
