lent to shipment costs for a maxinum of 1,000 pounds of personal

SUBJECT

Thomas B. CASASIN

PERIOD COVERED: January - June 1974

Although I have been the Station case öfficer for Subject

only since

January 1974, I have been acquainted with his performance

for the

Station

for the

past s 1/2 years

through my asaigoment in

the French

Branch at. Headquartors and, for the past 2 1/2 years,

as the

Station officer responsible for UNCAIRD operations.

I

have always considered CASASIN to be a highly killed, experienced

Benior cae

officer

thoroughly devoted to the work of

BKHERALD.

He

1g

becoming

Increasingly

effective 1n his present cover position

at. UNCALHU,

operating against both soviet and IKC targets, and

am delighted that he

has agreed to continue his cooperation with

the Station

as a fleld agent

following his retirement from

BKHERALD effective 30 June 1974.

CASASIN can look back with pride

over his years of service wich

BKHERALD but he can also look

forvard to additional years of highly useful, productive work for

Paris Station.

CASASIN's attitude can best be summed up by a comment on my

first operational

meeting with hin following his officlal retire

ment.

He instinctively went immediately to a discussion of

operations, not of rettrement.

I am confident that CASASIN will

continue to be a highly motivated, effective asset of Paris Station,.

and I wish hin

well.

complete and literate. Despite his relative isolation as a noc, he

vell' aware of priortly objectives, concentrates his effores in these areas

and does not waste tire on operationally marginal acclulties.

As is normal in a NOC situition, subject has no supervisory duties with

SHERALD personnel but his cover

job provides.supervisory.respons1bility.

Subject is meticulous in presentation of financial accountings and his

operational expenses are, modest. There are no administrative problems

related to this project.

REVIETNG OFFICIAT.

level; in point of fact, It would, in the writer's opinion, merit a solid "S",

but no more.

Recognizing that such ratings are perforce subjective, and

that the rating officer has a closer, almost daily experience factor,

nonetheless, the reviewer simply does not believe that the written record of

the NOC's accomplishments on the specific targets will support an "0"

rating. at this time.

Even accopting the limitations which the cover

sicuation imposes upon the NOC, henas still' not perförmed in a manner

which would correspord to theliteral definition of "0".

Other than this divergency, the reviever shares the laudatory comments

set forth in the narrative

on this noc.

He is all the things the rater has

stated and more: highly intelligent,

versatile, linguistically extremely

vell qualified, and professionally experienced in his cover role.

He has

begun

very well to utilize this new cover position on the Organization's

behalf, and it is quite accurate to note that the NOC landed this particular

plus (in terms of competition for the cover vacancy) solely on the basis of

his own demonstrated: talents in the cover context.

In sun, this is an copurienced, rifective doe, whoe no cover affords him

an expanded natural access to a host of the Station's primary targets; he has

begun to exploit this. access in a sound, logical fashion,

and the period ahead

should further document the utility of his key situation

to our operational

programs. In fairness to all concerned, it is simply too early in this new

position to attempt a definitive judguent uf che depth of access which can be

derived Irom it.

Comments by Chief, EuR Erance:

Although concurring with an overall rating of "s", I consider the "o"

-ratings for specific duties numbers one and two to be sonewhat high and I recommend

"s" for both. Casasin certalaly has naintained his cover and we anticipate

he vill be able to preserve it 1a his new job. He has just begun to initiate

contacts with Suviet personael of operational interest and it renains to be seen

how effectively Cagasia can exploit this situation

COMMENTS OF NEVIEMING OFFICIAL I

I concur with

the supervisor's letter ratings and with the

substance

of his narrative comments.

•Put as simply as possible, Subject has done

an outstanding job in establishing superb access cover; it now remains

for him and the Station to exploit it operationally.

On the basis of

his ability during the reporting period to establish meaningful

relationships with target Soviets or to spot and assess leads to

potential

agents who can, Subject's retention is this assignment would

not be justified in terms of costs.

The 40% rebate does rake this effort

entirely defensible, however, buf Subject should understand that we

expect more concrete results now that his cover position has been

salidif-iad.

Despite long service as an NOC, Subject's knowledge of and

responsiveness to organisation priorities and requirements has not

weakened.

He concentrates on priority taïgets and his operational

reporting is complete, on target and highly literate.

As' is normal

has maintained a high output for BKTRUST. He has malntained trequent

MHHARSH couple in snother European city: The flow of apotting reports

nore in the flold of spotting and mating oporational contacta

than in that of sore than chort-range operational development.

subject's operational altuation makes it Impossible for hia to

attempt recruitmento. Thus, hia very real achievaments are not

by essence of the apoctacular variety.

subject's reporting has been satisfactory and continue to

be copious.

He could, hovever.. further improve the selectivity

of the leads provided the station and make more of an effort to

"Jigout" c..e

intoration contained in his roports.

Although subject has, at present, no supervisory functlon.

he has repeatadly requested such a responsibillty.

He is caroful

filth operat.loral expenses and has exercisad good security.

During the parlod under raviow, additional efforts have been

made to make full use of subject's potential and integrate hia

further in the work of the station componant with which he rocks.

He is a particularly valuable asset for the Station programs:

Moreover. I belleve the overall rating would more properly have

been in the higher range of the "p' category, rather than "s".

but it is of course a subjective judgment of the rating officor.

2. Student Progentation: Mr. Richerason presented a case with

which he was famillar fron his on experience. It was a first-rate

performance.

The material was very well arganised and crisply pro

Rofcrence:

OFPS-10932

CASASIN's dependents took physical examinations at the

American Hospital in Paris on 20 February•

since, because of

his cover there could be no INlIARP connection, CASASIN's dependents

made arrangements for their physicals as private citizens, on the

pretense that they remired statements that they were in good

health in order to obtain insurance.

Obviously, forms 88 were not

prepared; the attached certificates of good health and freedon

from contagious

disease are all that is normally jiven to private

individuals in France.

He hope they suffice.
