,
,
in the name of the

In the month of August 1966, that amount (from the ) was
reduced to $100.00 for economic reasons and in the month of Apt
April 1967 I was notified that this amount would be suspended
entirely and that I should not count of this subsidy in the future.
My situation cannot be sustained because due to my health

the request that the sum suspended by the
AMBIDDY-1
