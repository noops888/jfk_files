MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE

SUBJECT:

President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board

Meeting of Apr11 2-3, 1964

A regularly scheduled two-day meeting of the President's

Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board was convened by Chairman

Clifford at 9:00 a.m.

April 2,

1964, In the Eoard's offices,

Room 297, Executive Office Buliding.

Present were Board

members Doollttle, Gray, Baker, Langer, Pace and Murphy;

J. Patrick Coyne,

Executive Secretary;

and A. R. Ash.

(Dr. Land was unavoidably detained at the Boston airport, and

Joined the Board meeting later in the day.)

Chairman Clifford opened the meeting with some general

first congratulating Mr. Murphy on the excellence of

his recently published and well-received book "Diplomat Among

Warriors!'

Other Board members Joined In the sentiments ex-

pressed by the Chairman:

Next Mr. ClIfford expressed the Board's gratitude to the

Board Panel on NRO matters for:the: long and difficult task

Involved In the Panel's extensive study of the NRO management

and organization structure and attendant problems.: He noted

that Dr. Baker and General Doolittle had been devoting the

majority of their time to the study, with inestimable assis-

from Mr. Coyne. The Chairman

thought that in the NRo

matter the Board had

probably made the most exhaustive analysis

of any. Inteiligence-related problem up to this time.

Chairman Clifford announced that in a few minutes the

meeting would be joined briefly by Mr. Henry Thomas of CIA for

the purpose of Indoctrinating Board members concerning two new

security clearance categories (DORIAN and QUILI, covering two:

extremely sensitive areas of intelligence activity:

Mr. Clifford recalled that when the Board met with

President on January 30, the President had sought the Board!s

views on a proposed reduction, In the Military Services' repre-

Mr. cittford went on to inform the Board

that on rebruary 5, 1964, Presidential Assistant McGeorge Bundy

had issued a memorandum to the entelligence community, announcing

the Presidents decision to reconstitute the US membership.

TOP SEGMEY

Mr. Clifford pointed out that the DCI feels that because the NRO

Is presently set up as a "line" organization in the Air Force, a great deal

goes on that the DCI does not know about, e.t., after USIB sets out intelligence

requirement's for NRO to execute, the DCI does not have an opportunity to

examine the effectiveness of the program..

Mr. Vance agreed that the DCI shuuld

be kept fully informed,

but if weather conditions, for example, require that

a S-day mission be called down on the third day, this is the kind of operational

decision that should not have to Involve

the DCI.

DI. Baker referred to concerns which have been expressed regarding the

tendency toward a fragmentation. of effort.in the reconnaissance field within

the Defense Department, as for example In the case of the MOL.

Noting that

Defense is the

greatest resource for national reconnaissance, Di. Baker asked

whetner consideration had been given to relating the JRC to the NRO, with a

view to avoiding unnecessary duplication of peripheral reconnaissance missions,

, the reduction of costs, and the placing of emphasis on meeting national require-

Mr. Vance replied that tying the JRC into the NRO suggests some command

channel problems,

but he thought the suggestion very worth while, and he

expressed the intention to consider it further.

DI. Langer referred to the gystem

of monitors. of the NRP in Defense and

in the CIA, and he asted whether the Director of NRO in fact reports to

Dr. Fubint In Defens: Mr. Vance replied that, to the contrary, the Director

reports directly to !ir. Vance and to Secretary McNamara. He added that as an

Internal matter Di.. Fubini monitors NRO matters for the office of the Secretary

of Defense and Mr. Vance would continue this internal Defense arrangement but

would clearly spell out the role of the PFIAB, et al, to accomplish external

monitoring.

Secretary Vance completed his discussion with Board members and left

the Board meeting at 11:50 a.m.

session, Board members further discussed the question of

appropriate assignment to CIA of a role in the NRP -- with the object of

preserving the valuable research and development potential of the CIA. Mr. coyne

noted that the Board Panel

had heard testimony that CIA is heavily Involved

in reconnaissance research

and development, but that this was not yet supported

by the evidence thus far assembled. Mr. Coyne added that under the Vance.

proposal to leave aircraft projects In CIA, this would include 9 OXCART aircraft,

2 U-2's at Taiwan, 3 U-2's at, Lockheed undergoing configuration for carrier d

and aircraft engaged In the STPOLLY project.

Mr. Coyne also noted

that of the 694 personnel providing support for CIA's aircraft reconnaissance

activities, 350 are AF personnellassigned to the CIA.

At 12:10 P.m. the Board meeting vas Joined by Mr. Ray Cline, Deputy

Director for Intelligence, and Mr. Bruce, Clark, of CIA. Mr. Clifford indicated

to Mr. Cline the Board'g interest in receiving a current Intelligence briefing

and

storable. High energy propellant fuel.

As for Soviet MRBM's and IRBM's, Mr. Cline sald that there are over

700 launchers, mostly in the Western USSR; deployment is alnost complete;

and

there is evidence of some hardening (four silos have been discovered).

Mr. Cline said that it 1s not certain as to how much the USSR intends

to invest in the development of an anti-missile missile.

Satellite photography

is the key.

A March 1964 photo of Leningrad shows 5 distinctive bays at launch

sites, but

it is indicated that the USSR probably suspended

construction in 1963.

In further emphasis on the importance of special search satellite

photography, Mr. Cline said that a GAMRIT mission has not yet been run over a v

huge mystery structure recently revealed in photography of Moscow.

Mr. Cline reported that yesterday the Soviets had launched a space probe

to Venus, the time

of arrival estimated as July 22.

concerning the recent release of the CIA estimate on the Soviet economy,

Mr. Cline

said that despite the welter of denials and counterattacks by the

USSR, the CIA has Indications that its estimate was correct.

"Pravda"

blast contained statistics confirming the CLA's estimate of

a 3 per cent gain

in the Soviet GNP. The next issue of Pravda omitted these statistics.

As for the Sino-Soviet conflict, Mr. Cline stated that this deep and

bitter

struggle reflects opposing national interests and policy views, and is

a contest for dominance which is nearing the breaking point. The anti-soviet

vituperation coming

out of. Communist China is unprecedented. CIA's clandestine

reporting indicates

that the Chicons are attempting to subvert Soviet leadership

around the world,

and to discredit Khrushchev in the USSR.

Exchanges of secret

Party letters Indicute that a Sino-Soviet break must come. The basis of the

dispute seems to be the failure of the USSR to provide the economic and military

support which China needed in order to enlarge its industrial capacity.

Pubiie

exchanges of insults, and intelligence from various sources, shows that the

breach began

in 1960 from differences of policy with regard

to degree of risk

of war which should be acceptable to Communism in its actions affecting ühe West.

Also there is a lot of prejudice against China in the Soviet military. Mr. ¿line

does not think that Sino-Soviet differences can be resolved so long as Mao and

ihrushchev are in positions of leadership.

With regard to Indian border action by the Chinese Cormunists, Mr. Cline

thought that this move was for the purpose of getting control of a part of the

route for a transcontinental railroad.

In Vietnam, Mr. Cline said, the U. S. mission has given General Khanh

a breathing spell to gei a grip on the political and military machine.

There

Is a little more confidence within the South Vietnam government.

The Viet Cong

has not launched attacks on the larger scale expected when Khanh took over, but

guerrilla activities have increased and 3 nrovince chiefs have been killed

or

kidnapped in the last few weeks. In North Vietnam, recent intelligence indicates,

there is civil defense activity including the digging of shelters and

trenches.

Last night the Interagency Task Force on Vietnam discussed the

problem

and concluded that things are on dead center as lar as the South

war effort is concerned, and

more U. S. support may be necessary

before the rainy season sets in

in September.

The Viet Cong are getting

Mr. Cline concluded his briefing and departed the Board

meeting. at

1:10 pom. at which time the Board adjourned for lunch.

At 2:00 p.m. the loard resumed in

executive session.

Chairman Clifford

remarked that the sessior: with Mr. Cline of CIA had been valuable and that

there would be similar briefings arianged for future Board meetings. Mr.

Clifford asked that Board members let Mr. Coyne know ahead of time the subject

matters which they wish to have covered in current Intelligence briefings.

Next, tr'. Coyne give the board an oral surmary of implementing actions

reportedly under way in response to the Board's recommendations

In the Dunlap

case.

It was noted that in answer to Mr. Bundy's referral of the Board's

recommendations

to the Dil for agencies'

consideration and the preparation of a

coordinated report by the DCI, the latter had failed to coordinate with other

agencies with respect to ? of the 21 recommendations. Mr. Coyne had discussed

this with Mr. Bundly

who agreed that the DCI should have furnished a coordinated

report of agencies' views and conments, and Mr. Bundy had asked Mr. Coyne to

prepare an appropriate further communication for Mr. Bundy's signature.

In

answer to a question by Dr. Langer, the Chairman thought it best to see whether

the DCI complies with the request for a coordinated report, before suggesting

that Mr. Bundy go directly to the agencies.

During the Board': discusston of action reported on its Dunlap case

recommendation relating to the Soviet Union's attempt to obtain new Embassy

quarters

in Washington,

General Doolittle expressed the hope that steps would

be taken by U.S. intelligence agencies to ensure technical coverage of any

new Embassy that might ba constructed for the USSR.

Mr. Ash sunmarized for the Board recent reports received on the implemen-

tation

of Recomendation 3 (CIA-State report); Recomendation 35 (DCI report);

and Old Board Recommendation 3 on the status of JCS-CIA intelligence planning

for wartime emergencies.

With regard to the latter, the Chairman asked that

there be put on the agenda of the next Board meeting the matter of the JCS-CIA

suggestion that annual status reports be discontinued.

Chairman Clifford asked that Board members next proceed to discuss the

type of report that the Board would make to the President concerning

the NRO.

The Chairman asked Dr. Baker, as head of the Board's NRO Panel, to discuss the

reasons for changes in the NRO as recommended in the draft report which the

Panel had placed before the Board.
