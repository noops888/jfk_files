RE: ARRB Additional Information Request No.CIA-2

Dear John:

As you know, the ARRB Board at its May 19, 1995 meeting concluded that it required

additional specific information before it could review the CLA records under discussion

at this meeting. Based upon my discussions with you and with Barry Harrelson, I

understand that the Historical Review Group can respond only to questions that draw

upon information already on hand, and that any questions requiring further research

will go to the components for a response.

Since I understand from you and Barry that it will be faster if we divide those of our

questions directed to the Historical Review Group from those directed to the

components, we are submitting two separate lists for CIA's response. List 1, which we

are submitting to the Historical Review Group, asks basic questions about documents,

including the Mexico chronology, which HKG has not previously addressed. List 2

asks for the answers to questions about names, pseudonyms, and crypts that go beyond

what we understand is HRG's current available information.

Since the ARRB Board will consider these documents at its June 7, 1995 meeting, we

hope to have this information by then. Thank you for your continued cooperation, and

we look forward to your response. Please do not hesitate to contact me or Jeremy Gunn

for any clarification regarding these requests.

Sincerely yours,

Sione

David G. Marwell

Executive Director

Re:

•Status of Assassination Records Review Board Requests to CIA for

Additional Information and Records

file

Dear Barry:

I am writing to memorialize our conversation of October 1 regarding the status of

Assassination Records Review Board requests for information and records from the

CIA.

We discussed the following formal requests:

CIA-1 (Organization materials)

CIA has made records available to the Review Board. The Review Board

staff will continue its review and make recommendations to the Board

and will request further information, if necessary, from CIA. CIA needs to

do nothing further at this time.

CIA-2-5 Complete •

CIA-6 (Cables and dispatches)

CIA originally informed the Review Board staff that these materials could

be made available by December, 1995. CIA now agrees to make the

records available (or to have a response) by the first of November, 1996.

CIA-7 (Histories)

Mexico City. CIA has shown the Mexico City history to Gunn. CLA will

compile the portion of the history that was shown to G. Robert Blakey,

BOARD MEMBERS: John R. Tunheim, Chair • Henry F. Graff • Kermit L. Hall • William L. Joyce • Anna K. Nelson

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR: David G. Marwell

which will be processed as an assassination record. Gunn will then

determine whether there are any additional portions of the history that

should be added to the Blakey version. CIA will compile the "Blakey

version" as soon as possible and Gunn will promptly thereafter review the

documents.

Index. CIA has made an index available to Review Board staff and the

staff has identified certain histories that may be appropriate for review.

CIA will make available those histories that are of obvious relevance, and

will raise with Review Board staff any questions regarding the requests

where the basis for the request is unclear. CIA will begin to make

histories available on a rolling basis. Review Board has agreed to review

histories promptly once they are made available. Although it was not

discussed at our meeting, we would very much appreciate it if you would,

within the next two weeks, identify which histories you are prepared to

make available and those that CIA believes should be subject to further

discussions.

Cram's multi-volume counterintelligence history. Although Cram's

history was not specifically discussed at our meeting, the Review Board

staff understands that the history has been located and the Review Board

staff awaits its being made available.

CIA-8 (Intelligence community staff)

CIA will provide a report to the Review Board staff within two weeks.

CIA-9 (Publications and analytical materials)

The Review Board staff provided CIA with a list of certain publications as

they appear in an LBJ Library finding aid. CIA will report back on

recommended action to the Review Board promptly.

CIA-10 (Interagency source register)

CIA has compiled information responsive to the request. CIA will make

records available within two weeks.

CIA-11 (Duran's original statement)

Mr. Barry Harrelson

Page 3

CIA has been unable to identify to date Duran's original statement. CIA

will make some further attempts to locate it.

CIA-12 (MWAVE materials)

CIA will begin to make materials available on a rolling basis.

With respect to the informal requests, it is our understanding that:

CIA is inquiring into matters related to Spas Raikin. The Review Board staff will

discuss issues with CIA once the pending research is completed.

CIA is locating a cable number IN 24738 (7 July 62), which is identified in record

number 1993.07.20.10.18:29:650630 (Box 34, F 22), p. 2.

CIA is inquiring into matters related to Marilyn D. Murrett. The Review Board

staff will discuss issues with CIA once the pending research is completed.

CIA is continuing to search for HTLINGUAL records, particularly those

identified in Church Committee index that was provided to CIA by Review

Board staff. CIA is prepared to provide oral briefing on HTLINGUAL.

Please let me know if you have any supplements or corrections. We would very much

like to ensure that these matters are handled expeditiously.

As always, thanks for your cooperation and assistance.

General Conel and Associate Direstor for Research
