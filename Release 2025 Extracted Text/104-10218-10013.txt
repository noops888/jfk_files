Interview of Mr. Luis E, GUTIERREZ
ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES
See paragraph 1 below.

MOT EQURID
ONIY5ED DEK
CAN REG
1. Your assistance is requested in interviewing the Salvadorian citizen,
Luis E. GUTIERREZ, for information which would be helpful to this Government
in determining the accuracy of certain claims made confidentially by
Herbert L. ITKIN. Mr. ITKIN is a prime witness in legal proceedings presently
underway in New York City involving the Mafia and related underworld organiza-
tions. ITKIN lives under the protection of U.S. Federal Marshals.
2. The following data is for your information. It should not be used in
dealing with GUTIERREZ or outside of this Organization. ITKIN has been an
FBI informant since March 1963. He has now claimed to have worked for this
Organization during the period 1954/55 to 1960. ITKIN asserts that his contact
during these years was one Philip HARBIN. This inquiry is concerned solely
with ITKIN's claimed relationship with this Organization from 1954/55 to 1960
when he alleges HARBIN was his contact. As will be seen, GUTIERREZ, ITKIN
alleges, also knew HARBIN during that time and that fact, therefore, is
material to the credibility of ITKIN's story.
ITKIN's first contact with Philip HARBIN was in 1955 when he claims to
have been contacted purevant to a mecting be, ITKIN, had in Philadelphia with
a leading personality of this Organization and another high-government official
late in 1954 or early 1955. According to ITKIN, HARBIN never made the
specific claim of being from this Organization but that was ITKIN's assumption.
ITIKIN describes HARBIN as about 42 or 43 (in 1955), an American.
He had receding hair, combed back but parted. He was about 5'8" in height,

well-built with little evidence of fat. He always wore a vest. He spoke fluent
Spanish and could have been of Polish or Russian family background. HARBIN
always drank tea, never coffee. He appeared affluent with a professorial air
about him.
Following an initial mecting, ITHIN alleges that he am R
periodically in New York City. ITKIN alleges that he passed to HARBIN copies
of the correspondence developed by his law firm, Delson, Levin and Gordon,
dealing with Indonesia, Burma, and India, ITKIN left that law firm in mid-1957,
presumably thereby losing total access. Among the materials ITKIN claims he
passed to HARBIN before he left the Delson, Levin and Gordon firm was informa-
tion he picked up from a friend who worked at the United Nations for the
Government of El Salvador. This friend was Luis E. GUTIERREZ (see biographic
sketch, Attachment A). ITKIN claims that he became very friendly with
GUTIERREZ, who was studying either at New York University or Columbia
where he prepared a master's thesis on El Salvador's economic position.
HARBIN, he says, was interested in the topic and ITKIN alleges he furnished
HARBIN notes of GUTIERREZ' monograph.
Sometime presumably after mid-year 1957, HARBIN asked ITKIN if he
knew anybody else who could do (intelligence) work. ITKIN recalled GUTIERREZ,
who meanwhile had moved to the position as Consul General of El Salvador in
New Orleans, Louisiana. HARBIN--ITKIN says--accepted the suggestion and
ITKIN provided an introduction for HARBIN by letter, which he sent to GUTIERREZ
in New Orleans, ITKIN asserts that HARBIN--according to his own statement--
went to New Orleans and made the "new contact". ITKIN claims he last saw
HARBIN in 1960.
3. A comparison between the key points of ITKIN's account as summarized
in the immediately preceding paragraph with the data set out in Attachment A and
E will show immediate contradictions that tend to destroy any credibility in
ITKIN's account, particularly with respect to his relationship to GUTIERREZ.
We also point out, solely for your information, that we have found no confirma-
tion in our records of any relationship between this Organization and ITKIN during
the period 1954-1960, No traces have been found in our records or anywhere in
government thus far of a Philip HARBIN, and there is explicit denial that there was
any meeting in Philadelphia in 1954 between ITKIN and the high officials he
nominates. Finally, there is no substantiation in our files of any of the intelli-
gence product which ITKIN allegedly passed to HARBIN. This case, however, is
of such a nature that we must strive, if possible, to have GUTIERREZ' own
statement for the record.
:
4. We leave to the Station determination of the best manner to approach
GUTIERREZ. It is our preference that a Station officer, under suitable cover,
perform the interview, but it may well be that a consular or embassy officer
might be the best person to do the job. We repeat that we are concerned in this
matter solely with the verification or denial of ITKIN's statements, specifically
the allegation that he introduced HARBIN to GUTIERREZ in New Orleans and
that as a consequence GUTIERREZ would be in a position to identify and describe
HARBIN in a way that would permit us to locate him if he exists. The request
for GUTIERREZ' assistance in this matter is in no way predicated upon hostility
towards ITKIN nor is there any predisposition against his claims if indeed
evidence is found to back them up. If GUTIERREZ indicates that he is willing to
provide whatever information he can, you can assure him that his information is
solely for U.S. Government use and will not be made public by us at any time
without his expressed consent. Also, it is clear that we are prepared to accept
his decision to give no assistance in the matter.

5. We have compiled a short statement that might be used by the interviewer
to explain to GUTIERREZ the purpose of the interview (see Attachment B). A list
of questions, which should be given orally, is elaborated in Attachment C. You
will note that these questions concern the larger as well as narrower elements.
of GUTIERREZ' relations with ITKIN. We are willing to settle for a specific
answer to the narrower question of Philip HARBIN in preference to generalizations
about the whole relationship. If, as a consequence of your handling, GUTIERREZ
is willing to talk in depth, we will be grateful.
6. Attachment D is a copy of a New York Times article concerning ITKIN and
one of the completed federal cases in New York City. This item is attached for
your background reading. This may be shown to GUTIERREZ, of course.
Attachment E is a copy of a letter dated 26 February 1965 from GUTIERREZ to
ITKIN. Again, the content of this letter tends to support the theory that ITKIN'S
story, as elaborated in paragraph 2 above, is a fabrication. While possibly based
on a real relationship, it appears to be a fabrication with respect to chronology
and with respect to the exact mutual interests involved. Also included in this
attachment is ITKIN's answer to the letter. We feel in retrospect that
GUTIERREZ might be unhappy to read his own letter in the course of a consular
interview. We, therefore, suggest that this not be shown to him. However,
there is no objection to an indication that the U.S. Government is aware that
GUTIERREZ was in perfectly correct correspondence with ITKIN during 1965 on
business matters.
7. We would appreciate compliance at your earliest convenience and a pre-
liminary indication by cable of GUTIERREZ' response, if one is forthcoming, on
the questions concerning GUTIERREZ' knowledge of HARBIN. If there is anything
unclear in this dispatch, Headquarters would welcome any questions by cable.
All correspondence should be addressed Chief, WOMUSE, via Chief, WH.

Suggested Statement to GUTIERREZ
I understand you have a friend named Herbert ITKIN, a lawyer, now living
in New York. Mr. ITKIN is under the protection of United States authorities
because he is the prime witness in very significant legal cases presently pending
before the Federal court in New York City. Mr. ITKIN, in private testimony to
U.8, authorities, has indicated that you were a friend of his; he met you in
New York while you were at the United Nations. He has also indicated that sometime
in 1957 he sent a letter of introduction to you in New Orleans, presenting one
Philip HARBIN whom ITKIN claims did go to New Orleans and introduced himself
to you. Your answers to questions relating to the above would be of great help to
the U.S. Government in determining the veracity of ITKIN's statements.
