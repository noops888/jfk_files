Declassification of Warren Commission
Documents
1. In accordance with existing arrangements, we

whereas only certain segments of the others remain in
classified status. Copies of the affected materials
are attached..

3. Documents C and D would go beyond what we want
to release now about our dealings with defectors and the
determination of their legitimacy.

attached.
We recommend your signature.
