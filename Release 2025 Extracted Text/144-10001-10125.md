The Inconcelvable and irexplicable impunity with which en

Individual of known penal antecedente assassinated OSWALD, tha

principal accused of the assassination of President KENNEDY, in

the presence of the police thenselves and in the sal or a

that the powerful reactionary political forces within the

United States are making use of all cheir resources and tafluences

in order to conceul those who master-hinded KENNEDY's assassloation

and the true notives for it.

World public opinion demands the enlightening of the deeds.

It is absurd that the political authorittes and the probecueles
