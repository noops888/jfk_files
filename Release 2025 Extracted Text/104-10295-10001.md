2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992'

29 August 1962

MEPORANDUM FOP. THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Sursary of S/d Training and Issuance of Materials.

AGENT : AMLASH/1

PIACE : Paris, France

DATE : 17-22 August 1962

TRAINER: Richard M. Fallucci, Tu C/D.

1.

AMLASH/1 was instructed in Sw techniques by the under-

signed in a Paris Station safehouse on 17 and 18 August, and was

given an Sid review in the final triefing session held in the hotel

TOO of Wallace A. Growery (Madrid Station C/O) on 22 August.

Instruction was given in the use of carbon writing system No. 15136

and in the use of liquid developer system No. 56638 .

The "scorch"

method of developnent was also demerstrated to A/l as an alternate

system. A total of five hours was devoted to this instruction.

2. A/1, who was recruited a short time prior to coning to

Paris, was introduced to the idea of using S/w by the undersigned

during discussions held in Copenhagen.

Although for security

considerations, he was skeptical at first about using such a means

of cormunication, he was without due effort convinced that any

productive relationship depended upon his being able to comunicate

with his C/O on a regular basis through. the medium of S/i letters

sent through normal nail channels.

It was apparent from his early

questions that he was unfamiliar with the principles of S/i and clandes-

ine communications in general. After further talks in Paris witt

Growery on l6 degust, A/l was fully prepared to accept the concept

of S/l communications,, and arrangezents were made for this instruction

to begin the fallowing day.

The first training session on 17 August lasted a little

more than two hours, and was devoted to an explanation of the s/d

system of comunication, including careful instruction in the

preparation of a letter containing S/M. A/l also prepared an S/d

letter of his own under the superrision of the undersigned. He

seemed to grasp readily the principles of the preparation of an s/i

message and experienced only a little difficulty at first in remember-

ing all the steps in

sequence necessary for the preparation of an S/W

message. He was generally attentive to the instruction given. How-

ever,

In keeping with his te perment, he was a little impatient

during the preparation of the S/w message itself upon the cover

letter. At the end of this session, he demonstrated that he remembered

the basic steps in a satisfactory manner, particularly considering

that It was his first day in S/W Instruction.

The second period of instruction took place in the same

safehouse, lasting about two hours.

This session was devoted to a

review of the S/ procedures and the preparation by A/l of another

practice S/W letter. Following this, A/1 was instructed in the

development of S/l messages, using the liquid developer No. 55538

The scorch system of development was also demonstrated. A/1 was

impressed by the simplicity of the liquid developer and the immediate

reaction which it produced. The undersigned developed one message;

then k/1 was allowed to prepare the developer from its dry pill form

and to develop a second practice S/W message for himself. Following

he period devoted to sW development, a general review

communications was htld, the basic points apparently being well-fixed

in A/l's mind.

5. During the final fornal meeting with A/1 un 22 August

with Growery and the undersigned participating, the latter gave A/1

& general review of all the s/i procedures

which were to be used

In his contact with KUBARK. He also was provided with the following

items:

1. Two sheets of S/ carbon paper (10. 56638)

forty-seven pills of developer

c.

one tablet of writing paper provided by TSD and

known to be compatible with the carbon sheets.

D. 3 No. 2 percils of French manufacture.

E.

One ball-point pen with water-resistant ink.

F.

Two acconodation addresses: one in Madrid for

regular contact; one in New York City for rapid

emergency contact (see attached S/w data sheet).

G. Appropriate indicators (see S/w data sheet)

It is noted that A/1 did not have a secure accomodation address in

PBRUMEN to give us at this time. He was told, however,

that it was

imperative that he provide one for us by SW letter within two weeks

of his return to PBRUMEN. This he stated he would do.

During the last s/w review, A/I was shown a photograph

of one of his practice messages which he had prepared.

He was quite

interested in seeing this, which served to illustrate a number of the

training points which had been covered during previous instruction.

Generally, A/1 was an interested pupil and It is believed that he

will be able to carry out the instructions in a proper manner. He

is quite security conscious, a factor which it is believed, will add

to his attempts to seek perfection in his S/ü correspondence and

In the secure storage of his S/i materials when not in use.

It is

also known that A/1 practiced his S/W techniques in his hutel room

after leaving the 22 August meeting.

This is known because he had

an additional question to ask us at a brief meeting on 23 August.

It should also be noted that the TSD technician who

developed A/l's practice letters recommends that for best results,

all letters from A/l be subjected to ammonia fuming before immersion

in the developer.
