OCCURRENCE:
On August 12, 1960 the Special Group heard a summary of the budget for Cuban
operations from MR. BISSELL. Approximately million dollars were required
to finance Cuban operations for the fiscal year and a balance of 1055/4 was
necessary for the remainder of the fiscal year. Major subheadings in the budget
were (1) political action, (2)-propaganda,(3)-pa-rami-l-i-ta-ry, (4) intelligence
collection, (5) counterintelligence, (6) communications support, (7) support.
It was agreed
"This matter should be laid before the appropriate higher authori-
ties and a presentation would be arranged hopefully within the
next 10 days. This was believed to be wise, not because any

OCCURRENCE: Lansdale traces the history of the project from its inception on Nov. 30,
1961 through March 1, 1962. Under the latter date, he notes, "The Chief of Operations
/Lansdale/is to report to the President through the Special Group (NSC 5412 Augmented
by the Attorney General and the Chairman, JCS); the Special Group will be responsible for
providing policy guidance for approving important operations, and for monitoring progress."
(00181) Lansdale also submitted an intelligence plan for basic intelligence collection
upon which to base the decision to undertake actions to cause the overthrow of Castro.
The plan itself-at-pages-00183-through-00187, included establishing intelligence
inside Cuba; collecting intelligence from Cubans inside the United States; counterfeiting
ration cards and currency inside of Cuba; geographical surveys of air fields, military
installations, communications centers; attempts to place trained agents inside the government
organizations or to defect officials "in place"; and negotiating for British help in
contaminating lubricants and fuels to cripple Cuban transportation. "The British want to
know, 'how serious are you?', before risking their assets to help the U.S.". (00180-00187)

CIA operational capability, and to help create a climate which will permit-provocative

In regard to Task #7 of General Lansdale's review this memo notes, "Moreover, the development
of a resisitence movement will not remain controllable, so that operational time tables
produced during the next four weeks can serve only as guides for a proposed sequence of
actions." (00107)
The memorandum notes that six men to form the initial nucleus for work for inside Cuba

Approved were dispatching one intelligence agent operation to a key area selected by the
CIA, ("Many of the agents infiltrated into Cuba will be trained for paramilitary skills

"Had we been permitted to mount a more intensive and agressive, the original infilitration
schedule probably would have been met, possibly exceeded." The speed and extent of future
infiltration teams for resisitence purposes into Cuba "will of course depend upon policy
approvals by higher authority and the amount of support we can count on thereunder."

OCCURRENCE: Memo for Richard Helms from Gen. Lansdale concerning NSA cover. The memo
alludes to a conversation on the previous day, Jan. 31, 1962, about NSA cover for the
Cuba Project. It indicates that Cuba cover is top priority. It indicated that this was not
possibly known to the members of the United States Intelligence_Board. The problem seemed to
be to be able to decide how much of NSA (National Security Agency)'s assets were needed to
provide cover for the Cuban project.
