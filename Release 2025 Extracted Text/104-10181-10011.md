A. ON ARRIVAL SPAIN VIA AERONAVES DE MEXICO

BE MADE IN HOTEL. CINCIDENTALLY, BELIEVE NO NEED

POLITICAL

ATTITUDE:

A member of the Cuban Communist

Party, admitted on the recommendation

of Armando MART DavaloS, Secretary

of Organization. Although he has

been described as a militant Comrunist,

a convinced supporter of the Castro

regine and a fanatic Fidclista, there

is evidence to dispute this image.

An analysis of available information

indicates that he is not a convinced

Marxist, he cannot accept Party

discipline, and that his character

is basically inconpatible with the

systen he serves.

His father is reported to be an old-

guard Communist and a leader of

the barber's union.

In May 1961 AMiUG-1 reported RUIZ

was a DGI casc

officer in Mexico: for

operations targetted against "some'

nearby arca," and later identified

his photograph as DGI member in Mexico.

In 1961 an emigre said RUIZ,

with the

Finance Ministry, was a Conmunist and.

•G-2.

ANTIKI-I said a letter fron a friend

in Cuba stated that RUIZ, then in

Mexico, was a member of G-2, sent to try

to infiltrate counterrevolutionary

groups (1963).

In April 1968, RUIZ advised Aristides

DIAZ Rovirosa

on the use of disguises,

the nced to "live secretly" and

commented on DIAZ' being "already

clandestine."

The Cuban Ambassador to Geneva, in

1968, commented on RUIZ' refusal to

accopt DGI dominance of the Cuban Embassy,

Mndrid.

(AMDELAY-1).

In July 1969,

AMBEDEW-1 said RUI7 was very dictatorial

in his dealings with DGI officers.

Not much is known of his contacts in

Madrid,

other than official.

has no cousins or rclatives of any sort. AP tells her

that person went by the Consulate the day before claining

to be her cousin and saying he was a Spaniard. Ni contends

she cannot imazine where he got that notion because she

has

no cousins, adding that her cousins are Catalonians

and not fron Clión. AF says the man who came to the

Consulate saying to be her cousin resembles NR, and describes

him as having blueges, sort of blond, and tall. She then

says 1t 1s an older married couple. According to NR, all

her family comes from Catalonia. AP repeabs this is an older

married couple ans their problems cannot be solved by the

Consulate, rather they must le resolved there (In Cuba?),

In addition, you

recognized the Hurculean task we have, to overcome his strong-

mindedness and idealistic character.

2. After a series of discussions among the officers

involved

with PBRUMEN operations at the station, we have

concluded that to execute a logically developed

"traditional"

recrultment, ve are faced with the challenge to recruit a

person, an

intermediary, in whom AMAUTO-1 has confidence and

respect; an individual who is able to plausibly carry on a

polemic argument with MAUrO-l without cither antagonizing

him or causing him to become suspicious of the intermediary's

true role.

Moreover,

the intermediary must be intelligent

to be able to respord in an appropriate way to our instructions,

as well as show a genuine willingness to cooperate.

Frankly;

we have no such person, currently on our list of assets

and

to find someone with the attributes set forth in Reterence A,

will be difficult to say the least, but we are prepared to

work diligently on this problem.

ASLUTO-1 confides in tea people.

From our reading

of QUIINID and QUDOZE, Phere are at least three persons

who could Tonicaly and cirectivels fill the role ns an

internediary.

They

are Identities, B, and C.

No can

categorically climinate

Identity A for obvious

rcasons, i.c.,

lack of

direct access to him.

Because of his

relationship

to Identity D,

#e can also

tentatively climinate Identity B.

He presents a risk which we are not certain should be taken;

however, we would like to

add & comment on him

in a later

paragraph.

Identity C would seem

to be the most logical

choice.

He is intelligent, a professional man,

well-to-do,

joung and one with whom alAuto-l frequently talks and whom

he often sees. He know little about his political proclivities

although he gives the impression of being a moderate analyst

of world events and doesn't seem to have a strong affection

or aversion for the PBRUJEN Government.

He have a good

background on him prepared for us by Dun and Bradstreet;

however,

as you can well imagine,

the report concentrates on

the economic side of the individual.

We have made a number

of attempts. here

in the Embassy to determine whether he has

any American contacts; but with negative results:

His visa

file does not show where he visited in the United States or

the purpose, except that it was a business trip.

He has an

indefinite visa

and we are fairly certain that,

if necessary,

we could use

the question of his visa as an entreto him.

Ne are

currently reviewing with all Station assets their

knowledge of

Identity C.

In addition,

we are also considering

assets such as QUCASH-1 and QUSPOT-1, who could, under some

legitimate business pretext, contact

Identity C.

Our objective

is to develop a warm

entree

to Identity C without compromising

any

but we are in need of an assessment of

Identity C by

of our agenither a Station Orficer or an asset working

under an officer's instructions.

We will keep you advised of

our progress.

We are forwarding PRQ Part I under separate

cover.

A POA on Identits C was requested separately. There

are no derogatory Station traces.

4.

Ideniity B would be an excellent choice if not for

his relationship with Identity D.

This avenue might be explored

with QUSEQUIN-18 if Headquarters is agreeable to a joint

operation.

QUSEQUIN-18 could probably get the necessary

clearances from Identity D directly,

or from one of Identity D's

aides, to contact Identity B. We will not pursue this until

we receive your comments.

5.

It is not too early to consider the emoluments we

might want to offer to AMUTO-1 at the time a pitch

is made.

As always they should be divided into tro areas - for defection

and for recruitment and work in place.

According to CUTIMID on 26 February, Miss

SUAREZ

de Cepeda of: the Groller. Company called AMAUTO-l and spoke

with his secretary to explain that her company is giving

their book to a number of persons in order to obtain their

opinions about the product and AMAUTO-I was one of the persons

on Grolier's list. AMAUTO-l's secretary said that he would

call when he returned.

Later, Miss SUAREZ was told that an

appointment was made for 10 March.

This would appear to be a routine item which

probably would not merit further investigatlon, unless we

can discover someone of higher caliber in the Grolier Company

who could approach AMAUTO-1 as a means of cultivating a mean-

ingful friendship with AMAUTO-1.

Decenber 1969-30 January 1970

Problens of Cuban Mission In Madrid

with Lack of Response from Havana

ACO

Spain, Nadrid (2 February 1970)

FIELDNO. OSM 9937

An official Spanish service from a usually reliable source

who was able to read the memorandum reported below.

1. In a memorandum dated 30 January 1970 to Carlos A.

Ne 1 ra. Garcia,

official of the Cuban Ministry of

Forcign Affairs

the Cuban charge d'affaires in Madrid

c'ildlermo

Ruiz

Perez outlined the salient. current

problens of most concern to his mission:

..2.

Building construction.

Ruiz submitted

a proposal to Havana in December 1969 for the

construction of a building to house all the missión

offices including the embassy, the consulate, the

commercial office, the Cubana

Airlines office, and

possibly the minister's residence.

Ruiz had not

received a concrete reply to the proposal and he

urged Neira to take it up again with the ministry.

b.

Radio facility:

Responding to a request

from

the Director of

the Cuban National Fishing

Aragones

Navarro, in

Deserter 1969, Ruiz applied to the Spanish authori-

ties for permission to install a radio facility.

in the Canary Islands for communicating with Cuban

ships.

The permission had been granted by late

December yet Havana had failed to follow up the

project with plans and instructions.

c.

Visa delays.

Havana is consistently

late in processing visa requests for foreignors

traveling to Cuba.

Ruiz attributed the delays

to the red tape which involves processing the

requests through two uinistries;

The Visa Section

in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the

Directorate of Immigration in the Ministry of

Interior. Ruiz requested authorization for the

consulate to send its visa requests directly to

the Directorate of Immigration since this is. the

section that ultimately determines whether a

foreigner may or may not enter Cuba.

TYPIC/QUTINID/U.S. Company in Touch with Cuban Embassy, Madrid

QUTIMID reported a 21 January 1970 conversation held

between the wife of the Cuban Charge in Madrid and a Miss

"Lourdes" speaking for the Grolior Conpany in New York.

Miss

Lourdes said that her company was undertaking some type of

publicity and

wished to interview the Charge in this regard.

When questioned about what kind of work the company does,

Miss Löurdes replied that Groller is an investigation (studies)

and consultant firm with central office located in New York City.

Lourdes gave her local number as 233-7448.

She was advised

that the matter would be brought up to the Charge, Guillermo

RUIZ, and she would be informed of the results later.

Later that day Aristides DIAZ Ruvirosa, the Embassy'g

officer and a member of the DGI, called back to say that

he would see her the next day in his office at 10:30.

3.

According to QUSEQUIN, telephone 233-7448 is registored

in the name of Isaac BENDAHAN Sananes at Calle General Moscardo 8,

6th floor, Apt. C, Madrid: There are no Station or liaison traces

on BENDAHAN.

DO Base New York may be able to identify the Groller

•Company in New. York

and the reason for which their representativo

in touch with the Cuban Embassy.

Whatever follow-up action is conducted, the sensitivity

of the AUTIMID operation should be kept firnly in mind so

that

our interest does

not appear to stem froa a techuical monitoring

of the Cuban installation.

Report No. 2254 (Cont'd)

to see about a package that Melba had lost traveling fron

Cuba the week before and could not locate because she had

lost the ticket.

One Miss LOURDES calls on behalf of the Groller Company

from New York and tells NILDA they are conducting some

type of publicity and would like to arrange an interview

with Guillermo RUIZ. NILDA asks what type of company

it is.

Sheis told it combines study and research.

N notes down the following information for RUIZ tó call

when he gets in: Groller Company of Study and Research,

main office In New York, Miss LOURDES, tel. : 223-74-48.

* is 20:

SANTAMARIA, from the Ministry of Commerce, calls in answer

to R's call and to apologize for not having been able to 'attend

the reception.

R begins by saying that when Raúl LEON

had left for Cuba he had sent a letter of thanks to the

Minister (of Cornerce) for his kind considerations and at

the same time had mentioned that "before your Lpl. I trip

it would be most beneficial and advisable for both parties

if you [pl.I could advance us a list of subjects you are

interested In discussing in Havana, for it would at least

give us a little time to prepare ourselves." SANTAMARIA

says, "Precisely, on Friday at 10:30 I am having a

"yes' and NIld tells her: "look Miss, you're playing

a very dangcrous game. "

MATOS:

I don't know what you mean, miss.

NILDA: Well, because none of the comrades here is going

to allow himself to be provoked. So, please

do not keep on."

MATOS:

hell, I don't know what you are referring to,

NILDA:

Well look, don't be astonished, you might end

MATOS: I don't know what you are talling about.

NILDA: l'ell, we do.

NILDA hangs up.

there has been a misunderstanding.

NILDA:. Look miss, we do not wish to talk to you anymore.

We are telling you in a nice way. Please do not

call anymore.

You made a date.

MATOS:

What kind of a date?

NILDA: Didn't you make a date with the Charge d'Affaires?

MATOS: No, no, no.. One moment, miss. I received a telephore

call and was told to call this gentleman, the

Cuban Ambassador. I could also tell you about

another ambassador, but that they were trying

to get in touch with me.

NILDA:

Who are'they'? To whom do you refer when you say

that 'they' called you?

MATOS: I was called on behalf of the Ambassador of Chile

and the Ambassador of Cuba. I thought. it was

extremely unusual, miss, because I don't know anyone

here.

NILDA: Didn't you call here a few days ago?

MATOS:

I called when I was advised to do so.

MATOS: I live with a daughter and you must realize that

I live only for her.

NILDA: Well, look, If you live for her, don't get mixed

up in these things for they may cost you derly.

MATOS: Very well, miss. I am deeply grateful to have

been

enlightened by you. I can see already that it is

simply a plot or an implication by someune;

NILDA: It is a plot and we know it. And we know who 18

Guillermo RUIZ. Pérez

DOB: Late January. or early February 1930.

• POST: Minister Plenipotentiary, accredited

since 12 December 1967.

ADDRESS: Juan de Mena 48, Madrid.

TELEPHONES: 259-5956 (home), 221-7028 (office).

DỌI : March 1970.

WIFE: Nilda VECIANA. Probably in her early thirties,

she is pregnant and was due to have her sixth child

in May 1970. However, her physician recommended

forced labor (reasons unknown), which was scheduled

for 17 April 1970. She has had difficulties with

her pregnancy because of recurring fainting spells

and overweight, which are being treated by Dr. HER-

NANDEZ and Di.

MATA ( the latter ordered lab tests

for Diabetes, the results of which are unknown).

Married for 16 years to Guillermo, Nilda

is a pleasant woman who has not been known to

quarrel openly with her husband or express

political or religlous opinions, although in

this last respect she has recited the Lord's

Prayer in front of Embassy personnel, which

suggests that she may have been or is a practicing

Catholic.

Mrs. Ruiz li a language teacher by profession

( speaks English fluently ), and 1s active in

the Embassy as secretary to her husband and book-

keeper, but only on

an informal basis.

Of rather weak personality L Exception,

see Actachment II; she was upset at the time_7,

which is reflected in the way that she handles

her five boys--"little beasts,", according to

Severina ORTIZ, the maid--, Mrs. Ruiz does not

permit them to be punished severely and is always

complaining that she does not spend sufficient

time with them.

BACKGROUND : Guillermo RUIZ, familiarly known

as El Guajiro, probably comes from a humble

family in Cuba, as he lived in a solar [in

a slum dwelling 7 in Marianao and began

to work when he was only l4 years old.

In the fifties he emigrated. to the United

States, travelling throughout the East Coast

and holding minor jobs. In 1957 he began to

work as an apprentice butcher for a Polish-

American named Alexander SAMKO, who had a

grocery store on Flagler St. In Miami. He

did so well in attracting Latin-American customers

to the store that he soon began to distribute

meat in the area for SAMKO.

He has said that when he left Mient

in 1958 he turned over to his brother a house

In North Miami, & brand new car, and over a

thousand dollars in the bank.

But his "success" could be traced, perhaps,

to another acquaintance that he 1s known to

have had.

At the time RUIZ and Major José Maria MOLEON

Carreras, then another Cuban exile, were in contact

with an American of Cuban descent known as Joe LOUIS

or WIS, an underworld figure who was competing

with the Itallans in the bolita racket in Tampa.

RUIZ himself has told close associates that LUIS

or LOUIS offered them $800 a month, plus car and

expenses, to supervise "collections" In Miaml.

Furthermore, LOUIS or LUIS even asked them

to kill a man named FERNANDEZ, who was involved

Ln the numbers game in Miami, for $5000 each.

In February 1958 RUIZ left Miami with Harry.

VILLEGAS Tamayo [a Captain In the Cuban Army,

he has been seen at parties in foreign embassies

in Havana with Major Manuel PINEIRO Losada, DGI

chief / and three other members of the 26th of

July Movement and entered Cuba clandestinely.

At the triumph of the Revolution Alexander.

SAMKO went to Havana, where he stayed for a

week at RUIZ's home, and offered him a partner-

ship in the busineas, which RUIZ rejected.

In 1960 he was one of 18 out of 5000 who

selected by the Ministry of the Treasury,

where he was working,, to take the full statistics

course outlined by ECLA. The courss, which lasted

two years, included such subjects as mathematics;

finances, democracy... and Marxism-Leninism.

One of his schoolmates at the time was

Parta ARCOL, now director of the Art Museum.of

Havana.

In 1963 he was sent to Mexico, and after

returning to Havana was appointed Chief of the

Trade. School at MINCEX, post that he held for

two years.

In 1967 he was

sent to Spain to replace

Ranón CALZADILLA as

EDUCATION : Aside from the statistics course

taken in 1960, RUTZ seems to lack, in the ayes

of some observers, a solid, forual education.

But he makes up for it by being an avid reader

(five newspapers a day, plus books). This impression,

however, may be wroog,

for there are indications

that he either studied or wanted to be a CPA.

He understands and speaks English and

French (fluency unknown), and has undertaken

to teach grammar to the embassy staff.

Sensitive to art, or so he says, he

frequently complains of the general lack of

culture in Cuba, His vocabulary level is rather

low, cussing quite often in the presence of

others.

RUIZ Is well-versed in world affairs,

and does have an understanding of international

trade.

He has read some of the works of José Marti,

whom he likes to quote. But there is another

book that he also refers to repeatedly, Kim PHILBY's,

the KGB spy who penetrated MI-6.

He is up-to-date on current intelligence

publications.

BALTH : Blond, baby-faced, and blue-eyed ("Very

handsome," according to Anita, the young maid )?

RUIZ, is known to be suffering from an undisclosed

liver illness for which he takes a medicine called

bilidis. Late in 1969 he was planning to go to

Portugal on vacation following the advice of his

physician, Dr. Pedro CABAS ( telephones, 276-7746,

256-2294 ), but he did not make the trip. He coughs

frequently,

is used to cold weather, and was

thinking

of going to the same gymnasium as his son Alejandro.

He wears eyeglasses to correct astigmatism,

and is known to like skin-diving, a sport that

he pricticed in Cuba.

In general terus, however, he enjoys good

health.

EMPLOYMENT There 1s no doubt that Guillermo RUIZ

exercises: the full authority that presumably he

should have as Minister Plenipotentiary (relatlons

between Cuba and Spain remain at this level

because of Spain's refusal to appoint a full

Ambassador after LOJENDIO was expelled frow

the Island by Fidel CASTRO).

He is involved in and kept informed of

all matters that have to do with Cuban-Spanish

relations, Including trade. He does not permit

commercial attachés to bypass him when they

submit reports to their respective enterprises

Havana.

In addition, he supervises Cubana Alr

Lines operations, and no one may travel on

Iberia to Havana without his permission (this

applies only to Cubans, for tickets must be

paid in foreign currency). Evidently he controls-

the Cuban Embassy in Lisbon, and Rafael FERNANDEZ

Sardiñas, the chargé there, travels frequently to

Madrid for consultations with RUIZ ("

with Portugal are not very good now").

Cuban officials arriving in Madrid must

congult with him before arranging visits to

panish officials or tactories, and only he.

Juan Antonio CURBELO Lemes, Aristides DIAZ

Rovirosa, and Roberto FRANCO Oliva, are authorized

to issue visas for people travelling to Cuba.

He seems to have good working relations

with Spanish Government officials because he

1s always

careful to place all the "cards"

the table in his meetings with them.

Nothing is known about unofficial contacts

with other diplomats in Madrid except that he

Is close to and exchanges information with the

Algerian Ambassador.

At times he tries to give the impression,

and this uight be true, that he enjoys the full

personal confidence of Osvaldo DORTICOS and Raúl

He frequently tells other Cuban diplomats

stopping in Madrid that he makes 90% of the

decisions without consulting Havana because

that Is "why. I am here for."

Above all, he directs constant and bitter

criticism against the bureaucracy in Havana

because of Its incompetence, which, in his opinion,

will cause Fidel CASTRO to carry out a major purge

after the 1970 sugar harvest comes to an end ("No

one in Havana wants or cares to make a decision").

The Peter Frinciple L" In a hierarchy every

employee tends co rise to his level of incompetence".7,

which he has read and is going to send to Fidel CASTRO

for reading on the advice of Melba HERNANDEZ, should

be taken as an example of what is happening in

Cuba. Furthermore,

in his view Havana 1s always

trying to interfere with the Embassy in Madrid,

resulting in lack of co-ordination and even co-

operation. ( To Horacio FUENTES Martínez: " More

than lack of organization there is chaos in Cuba

today.")

He directs almost the same criticism againat

nig. staff in Madrid because they. lack qualifications.

for the posts that they hold. " They think that I

fool," he once told an associate, "but I

don't miss anything that they do."

In turn, he has also been the target of

cricicism from Havana, first from Sonia GOMEZ,

who made a critical evaluation of the Embassy,

which he decided not to answer ("I took a

11brlum, smoked a cigar, and forgot all about

1t").

[ Sonia GOMEZ, a MINREX inspector close

co Vice-Minister Carlos CHAIN, was in Madrid

in mid-February 1970 for another review of

embassy. accomplishments. But this time she

seemed frlendly with Guillermo RUIZ.

On another occasion he complained to

Aristides DIAZ that he had receired one more

critical report from Havana because the Embassy.

"had not achieved much," although they had done

things that were not included in the yearly

plan.

But perhaps the most serious censure of

his activities cane in by telex (" Why worry?

The Americans and the Spaniards intercept all

messages anyway") early in October 1969. Havana

questioned the way RUIZ was handling trade

negotiations with the Spanish Government. L The

trade agreement was extended by mutual consent

to 31 December 1972,7

In his reply addressed to Raúl LEON Torras,

first vice-minister of MINCEX and senior Cuban

official directly responsible for the talks,

Guillermo RUIZ defended his right to be "informed"

and "consulted" in rather strong language.

Therefore,

he rejected that his cable number 521

was offensive to Joaquin ALVAREZ, a Cuban trade

official who had been the source of the complaint.

In the last paragraph he cold Raúl LEON

that the indemnification question ( payment to

Spanish citizens who owned property in Cuba)

depended on his reply to Don Pedro SALVADOR,

& Spanish Foreign Office official, and not on

"bribery" conjectures:

Evidently this last cable upset him so

much that he was nervous and particularly

security conscious.

Less than a week later,

he called Raul LEON Torras and requested

permission to go to Cuba, ostensively to

settle a "personal problem with my son."

When he returned to Madrid on 29 October

he was a changed

man, again fully confident

of himself. Nevertheless, he has told close

friends that he feels very lonely in Spain

and has had the desire to simply board a plane

and reture to Cuba abandoning the Embassy.

Late in January 1970 he was again de-

pressed,

for he felt like an

"exile" in

Spain after two years of service (" Even

though LEON played a part in my appointment

I cannot work for a man that I do not under-

stand. Maybe he sent me abroad to get me out

of the way. I feel

as if I were in Miami.")

He thinks he is "burned" in Spain, and

when he returns to the Island he will definitely

not go back to MINREX, but to MININT. He has

told close friends his term in Spain is up and

he will be returning to Cuba probably in the

summer. In any event, he does not plan to be in

Spain more than nine months. Nilda, his wife,

has stressed that they are leaving Madrid permanently

In July 1970.

POLITICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL VIEWS: Although

outwardly a "revolutionary"', Guillermo RUIZ

is & man of moderate political views struggling

to justify the actions of his government in

face of the political and economic realities

of Castro's Cuba.

Armando HART Dávalos, secretary of Organization,

he ls definitely nöt a convinced Marxist, and

consequently cannot accept the role of "robot"

required by Party discipline and vertical

structure (" Revolutionaries should not be

coerced by political control forms," he wrote

meddlesome,

" he told another colleague soon

after, although in this instance he may have

been referring to the Spanish CP).

But the most important revelation of

his views came to light on 11 December 1969,

when he was quoted as telling a visiting DAP

official from Havana: " If I disagree with

orders, I question them because I am not a

robot nor do I have the mentality of one. As

a human being I express opinions no matter

the risk that I may personally have to take."

Obviously, a man who thinks in this way

cannot be à Marxist,

Havana because of incompetence, lack of vision,

He has also sald that medicine in general 1s

quite backwards in Cuba:

Probably an atheist, he 1s known to believe

that "religion should not be considered a

handicap for people trying

to return to Cuba."

On the other hand, he refers to Latin-

American diplomats ag "bootlickers" because

they use the English language in parties,

and

has remarked that "capitalism is no good".

RUIZ seems to have certain admiration for

Francisco FRANCO, who, in his view, is the only

reason why Spain has not turned communist. Of

course, It 1s doubtful. that he really believes

He does not hide his favorable opinions

of the American people, sno are

"frank" and

"simple".

"They treated me very well," he

told Raúl LEON Torras in December 1969.

On international matters he is up-to-

date and well-informed. Following are some

of his views, which are contradictory at times:

" Cuba la a political power, not a military

or economic power:

" The USSR has neutralized U.S. sea power

" Cuba can destroy Guantanamo whenever It.

SECURITY : It is normal for any member of the

particularly sensitive in this respect, which

perhaps could be traced to his probable involvement

with the DGI in one way or another.

He is quick

to warn visiting Cubans of the

CIA's efforts (" La Compañla Sociedad Anónima" )

to compromise them, even before leaving Havana.

"Our Embassy," he says, "is the primary target

for U.S. operations in Spain."

He keeps control of mail going to and

coming from Havana in the diplomatic pouch,

and states repeatedly that his office is

bugged and telephone tapped (" There are micro-

phones. here the size of olives"). In addition,

he thinks he is followed openly by Seguridad.

For all these reasons he has acked Havana"

for funds to build a new embassy, where he plans

to have a shielded room free from microphones. ( The

building, which will cost approximately $600.000,

was approved by Havana and a Cuban architect travelled

to Madrid in late March 1970 to discuss the project

It would be proof for

to the question of when. There are two key

factors to consider :

a) His recall to Cuba.

RUIZ has indicated that he is unhappy in

his post--perhaps not really meaning what he

says--, which he has occupled for over tho

years.

As he has said that Fidel CASTRO plans

a major purge after the 1970 sugar harvest,

he himself may be one of the targets. Assuming

that his ideological inconsistencies have been

noticed, the DGI, in the absence of proof

regarding his loyalty and considering whatever

support he has in Havana, may request his

recall at an appropriate opportunity: during

a major reorganization of the Cuban Government.

In any event, RUIZ does not expect to

remain in Madrid much longer; and is planning

to be back in Havana by the 18th of July.

If Cuba is successful in harvesting 10

million tons of sugar, and they have already

ON THE JOB

7.

There secms little doubt that Rül7 excrcise the full

authority that presurably he should have as Minister Pleni-

potentiary.

The relations between Cuba and Spain appear to

remain static because of Spain's refusal to

appoint a full

Ambassador to Cuba after LOJENDIO was expelled from the island

by CASTRO in 1959.

Ruiz is involved in

and is kept informed

on all matters related to Cuban-Spanish relations,

trade.

seen to permit connercial attaches to bypass

him when they

submit reports to their respective home offices in

Havana.

In addition, RUIZ takes a keen and active interesi in

Cubana operations; and he has said that no one may travel to

Havana on Iberia without his permission.

He insists that Cuban

officials arriving in ladrid consult with hin before arranging

visits to Spanish officials or factorics.. He seems to have

good working relations with Spanish government officials,

because he is alvays careful to "out all his cards on the table"

in nectings rith

them.

(The tenor of his conversation seems to

emphasize that he likes things this way in all his relations,

personal as well as professional).

with other diplomats in ladrid, except that he is close to and

exchanges infornation with the

Algcrian labassador.

Principle, to which he refers constantly, and he uses this •

book to

describe what is going on in lavana.

Havana is always trying to interfere with the Embassy in

Madrid, a

situation which results in a lock of coordination

and cooperation.

RUIZ directs the same criticism against his

staff in Madrid,

because his personnel lack qualifications for

the jobs they

hold.

He once told an associate:

that I'n a fool, but I don't miss anything they do."

In turn, he has also been the targot of criticism

from Havana,

first from Zoila CONEL (7), who made a critical

evalu-

ation of the Embass.

RUIz' reaction is instructive: "I decided

not to answer it.

I took a libriun, smoked a cigar,

and forgot

all about it."

On another occasion he complained

to Aristides

DINZ that he had received another critichl report from Havana

regarding his program for the Embassy.

Havana was complaining

that not much had

becn achieved.

Ruiz noted that the Embassy

had accomplished much

that was not in the plan, and he intended

to answer that particular criticisn in detail.

12. Perhaps the most serious criticisn of his activities

came in a coded cable reccived by

the Embassy carly in October

1969.

Havana questioned the way that RUIZ

was handling the con-

mercial treaty negotiations with Spanish authorities.

strong language, RUl% defended his right to be inforned and

consulted on the matter,

denying that his cable number 521 was

offensive to Jonguin ALVAREL (Director of Trade with Western

Europe and North Amcrica), who was evidently the source of

criticisn against RUIl.

SECURITY AND SECURITY-CONSCIOUSNESS

of security-consciouspess.. This attitude can possibly be traces

the DGI in one way or another, but his

and espacially his political views (sec below)

would appear to argue gainst his affiliation.

RUIZ is quick to

they leave lavana, indicating RUl%' possible belief in the

omnipresence and power of the sociedad anonima.

than legitimate commercial purposes.

RUIZ cren offered to allow-

Spanish citizens to opcrate the station in order to emphasize

his point.

Correct as he goncrally is in his professional

behavior, RUIZ made what appears to be a mistake in discussing

There were reports;

that he was

unhappy there, and RUI% asked on 16 October 1069 to go

to llnvana to settle a personal problem with Guillermito.

If there were a problem,

it seems to have been solved,

because RUIz on his return quoted Guillermito as being

very happy in his new school.

Spanish) to the Embassy staff.

29.

RUl? appears to be sensitive to art, and he frequently

complains about the

general lack of culture

in Cuba.

(This

might indicate thatRUIZ considers himself

"above"' the Revolution).

He shows some of the general inconsistencies of the self-educated.

For example, his vocabulary level is rather lon, and he curses

frequently when talking to other male menbers of the staff.

On

the other hand, he seems rather well versed in international

affairs and has a good understanding of international trade.

the diagnosis and X-rays to ROA in Havana, who would pass them to

the Cuban specialist !ARTINEZ-PAZ for review.

TRAVELS

Following are the trips RUIZ is known to have made during

the last quarter of 1969:

To Bilboa, San Sebastian, and Burgos by car,

on 28 November 1969, returning two days later.

b. To Havana, to settle "a personal problem," on

20 October 1969 via

Ikeria (first class), returning to

Madrid on 29 October:

C.

To London on 14 November for consultations with

Raul LEON Torrcs, returning two days later by air.

To Italy with his family on vacation on 28 December

to pick up an Alta Romero that he bought for the Embassy,

returning by car and arriving in Madrid on 6 January 1970.

CONTACTS IN MADRID

31.

little is known about RUIZ' contacts in Madrid. Aside.

the Algerian Ambassador (see above), we know about:

a. Pedro RUIZ.

A good friend who goes to RUIZ'

home frequently:

According to RUIZ,

influontial and

Pedro is quitc

is a friend of MASSO(?).

b.

Carlos. CARRASCO.

Another person who calls

RUIZ frequently.

In late

October or early November 1969

CARRASCO went to New York:

c. Rosendo CANTO (201-719310). CANTO lives at Goya

51, Madrid.

His friendship with RUlz is intcresting,

CANTO's background, because their being together could

very dangerous for RUIZ unless he were using CANTO for

some reason with the approval

of lavana.

for a ycar, live there foi a year, and then join the

Cuban Foreign Service.

Referring to CANTO's desire, RUIZ

January 1970:

"He is a fool!

CHARACTER

35. Superficially, RUIZ scoms to be an casy-going and rather

simple man who

no doubt enjoys the prestige and pusition he has

and the

successes he has had professionally in Spain.

He appars

so have a

strong

character and probably plays the predominant

roic in his marriage.

He and his wife seem to get along very well

Sometines he spcals lile a man at war

constant reference to blacks as

colloquialisu roughly comparable with the pejurative

"nigger."

37.

except

ROlz almost never discusses women with his colleagues,

for one

off moment when he mentioned a girl he knew

in the United States before the Revolution.

Perhaps RUIZ wisely

remembers

that dilda also works nt the Embassy and refrains

from mentioning women on her account. In any case, still, one

known to be involved in any extramarital affair.

wonders about the custom of absenting himself by automobile

into the interior of Spain).

His habits seem to be simple: he likes movies; he

has read Topaz (but made no comment thercon); and he receives

people at his home for cocktails.

POLITICAL AND. IDEQLOGICAL VIEWS

39. Although outwardly a "Revolutionary," RUIZ, gives much

more

the appearance of a

man with noderate political views

struggling to justify to himself the actions of his govcrnment,

especially in view

of the political and cconomic realities of

his country.

It is possible

that his feclings might lie

closer to the theory of the "betrayed revolution"

---but not

for strictly ideological reasons.

The incompetence of the

Cuban

governrental bureaucracy, for esample, has sabotaged the

revolution.

10. In the first place, RUIZ definitely does not scem

to be a Martist and consequently he cannot

accept the role of

"robot" (his term) required by Party discipline and vertical

structure.

On 29 December 1969 he wrote to Telesforo

DIAZ Portillo, a MINREX official:

"Revolutionaries

should not be coerced by forms of political control."

b. On 11 December 1969 he told a visiting

Agropecuario

official from Havana that:

...not a robot nor do

disagree with orders, I question them because I am

the mentality of one.

a human being I express opinions no matter what the

risk that I may have to accept personally."

11:

Aside from the constant criticism of Havana's

incompe-

tence, lack of vision, and lack of realism, he is quick to point

out the deficiencics of life in Cuba as reflected in his directive

to his Embassy staff not to celcbrate Christmas together, because

there are hungry poople. at home.

RUIz has also said that medicine

in general is quite backward in Cuba.

12.

Although he is probably an athdest (or likes to think

of himsclf as one), he is known to believe that "religion should

not be considered a handicap for persons trying to return to Cuba."

He docs not hide his views of the American people, either, for

he describes Americans as "frank" and

seem

like strange words for a man as security-conscious as he.

He appears to be well-informed on international matters.

Some

of his views

are contradictory at times, but they characterize

as what might be called an undecided realist:

"Cuba is a political power, not a military or

economic power."

"The USSR has neutralized US sea power in the

Meditcrranean."

c:

"Cuba can destroy Guantanamo Whenever it chooses

to do

so,

although the base has lost its strategic value

to the United States."

"US-China rappronchment should be feared, but

of possible interest b addressees is a translation of

the following

letter dictated by Guillermo RUIZ Perez to his

secretary on 26 December 1969.

The letter was addressed to a

comrade "OCUZA or LANUZA (fon)! in Havana in response to a confi-

dential note received

by RUIZ from Havana.

"In relation to your confidential note number

7240 about the Spanish prisoners, Joaquin AUVI Casals,

Lazaro GARRIDO Sanchez and Antonio MARQUEZ Pedraza, whose

release was requested in a note from the Spanish Embassy

in Havana,

I would like to tell you the following:

Firstly,

Senor Joaquin AUVI Casals was of interest to

D. Pedro SALVADOR de Vicente; but because of the bad

record and activities of this man, it was understood

that his departure would be denied..... I talked to pedro

SALVADOR about this matter and upon mentioning this

man's background he told me that his interest was due

to a phone call he had received from a friend of his in

Miami.

He considers that, given the background in this

case,

his friend

was supposedly an instrument of

"other

interests".

secondly, regarding the other Spantardthe

we have no objection whatsoever to their departing

country.

Without anything of further consequence,....."

An official Spanish service from a source described as

sensitive and usually reliable.

1.

On 23

September 1969 the Cuban Minister to Spain,

Guillermo

Ru i z. Perez, called on Pedro

Salva

dor

de Vicente, the Special Delegate for Latill American Affairs

in the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs,

to discuss the

forthcoming trade negotiations in Cuba

• During the discussion

Salvador told Ruiz that the one and only question which

con-

cerns the Spanish Government is that of Cuban indemnifications

and pensions for Spanish employees,

and he asked Ruiz what the

latter

could say regarding this probiem.

(Field Comment:

The

indemnifications

refer to property owned by Spanish nationals

which was confiscated by the Cuban Government.)

Ruiz claimed

that he had no instructions on what he could say, adding that

the

claims were numerous and that the paperwork involved was

difficult and required a great deal of time.

2.

Salvador told Ruiz that the subject of indemnifica-

tions and pensions must be discussed during the forthcoming

negotiations, and that the Cuban Government must provide at

least an approximate figure of what

it is going to pay.

said

that the indemnification figure must be based on the

value of

the expropriated properties, less the amount of any

taxes levied

on the properties.

(Source Comment:

Salvador

did not say what would happen if the Cuban Government failed

to reach some agreement on the question but he implied that

negotiations would be delayed until the Spanish Foreign

Sinistry received the 'Cuban Government's reply to this

question.)

(Field Comment: Since the conversation between

Salvador

and Ruiz was held

before the recent change of the

Spanish Cabinet and other Government positions, there is no

raised by Salvador or the signing of a new trade agrcement

with Cuba.

As of 17' lovember 1969. Salvador was still

Special Delegate for Latin American Affairs.)

3.. (Field Comment:

Until recently, the indemnifications

and "pensions probien had not emerged as

i serious factor in

the nerotiations for a new trade agreement.

There has been

•a gradual detcrioration of Spanish-Cubin commercial relations

since the conclusion in May of preparatory negotiations for

a new agreemert, but this detcrioration ostensibly was the

result of a Spanish Government decision to reduce Cuban sugar

imports over the next three years.

The Cuban Government

apparently had not considered such decision in its analysis

of Cuban-Spanish commercial relations, and it was quite

upset when the decision was revealed during the preparatory

negotlations.

Some of the problems. causing the strain in

Spanish-Cuban relations were previously reported in

TDCSDB-315/2470-69, TDCSDB-315/02182-69, TDCSDB-315/03509-69.

Faraguayan Ambassador and former Dominican Ambassador

QUDOZE

Comments "of AMAUTO-l on Current Topics of Interest

ACTION REQUIRED. REFIRIALES

PROCISSING ACTION

MUSTED FOR CROIXING

ONLY ON ANILO DISA

MICROFILM

The following comments of AMAUTO-1 reflect Cuban thoughts

on the Czechoslovaquian situation, internal Spanish politics,

and the effects of recent changes

in the Spanish Government

on the impending trade negotiations between Spain and Cuba.

?.:

The Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia has

been a disaster; however, criticizing the Soviet action

would mean taking sides with the Americans.

A friend

may be criticized in private but publicly he should be

defended.

(QUDOZE, 19 November.). The Cubans have to

side with the Soviets for military and economic reasons

and because, whether right or wrong, they belong to

the

same ideological camp.

Cuba had and still has

enormous

discrepancies with the Soviet Union, China, and the

United States but weighing the diffcrences

Cuba is. with

Communism as opposed

to Capitalism. (QUDOZF, 3 November.)

b.

AMAUTO-1 was asked by his government to report

on the

new Spanish Government which Havana

calls "Opus

Dei".

To a visiting Cuban official he admitted that

he was at a loss to understand Spanish politics but

attempted to define them.

It is

not

true that the

Spanish Government is in the hands

of the Opus Dei.

There are some men

in the

government who lean. toward the

Opus Dei but there are others

of a very different leaning

because they come from the Falangist ranks.

These men

(the Falangists) may 50 along with the Opus Dei line

because they allow

themselves

to

be "carried by the tide"

but they are not of the Opus Dei. (GUDOZE, 19 November.)

the impending trade negotiations

with Spain, in ardition to the economic problem the

Cubans are now faced with another impediment which

further delays the negotiations:

in the Spanish goverument.

Itis difficult at this

time for the Cubans to approach any Spanish official

because of the climate

of confusion among them.

Spanish officials have no idea as to whether they will

remain in their posts or will be replaced.

it is futile for the Cubans to press them

Therefore,

on the negotiations.

The most they can do is wait

patiently until the situation is normalized.

negotiations are not held within the 30-day expiration

period of the agreement, it is possible that the present

agreement

can be extended for two months.

This would

be advantageous to the Cubans because during the first

two months

of the year they will be able to acquire all

the goods they will need for 1970. (QUDOZE, 19 November).

The idea of helping him in his work is apt and

As

a recruitaent target, horever, AHAUTO! seens to

present serious difficultles.

He is strong-ainded, opinionated,

idenligtic, and apparentlycommitted to the revolution.

On, the

other hand,

there are certain things about him thich could be

converted

Into rocruitsent vulncrabilitles.

First aorre theBo

18 big

15:

apparent belief that the regime (read:

the Revolution)

not making the best usa of his talents.

One cannot tell

precisely unether. this is the cause or result of his

apparent

basic emotional instability. During public appearances

he

displays pölished manners and a pro-regine attitude; in private

he frequently. complains to ble subordlantes that he

did

not ask

for a diploatie position, that he would prefer an industrial

Job, and that he believes

bis position to be more a handicap

than a promotion.

Secondly; he obviously desires personal

prestige and luxurious Aving.

While these traits do not mean

so wuch in the case of a Cuban as compared to a soviet or

Chinese, hardships and econonic mismanagement in Cuba do in

fact create a contrast with his basic impulses:

his

spinal ailment has been diagonsed as incurable. Mile

may be true, he should realize that further examination by

other medical men (while on a training mission in HOLADY,

perhaps) could help hin considerably. There may even be other

vulnerabilities which further targot study could expose.

5.

He present these thoughts at the same time that. "o

are fully aware of other operational pressures on ladrid's

time and assets..

Nevertheless, we would appreciate the Station's

comments

on

further development of AMAUTO:1 as an 1n-place

recruitnent target.

The firet need would be the proper access

agent, soneone with a Jesult-like intellectual training who can

deal with him in the reala of concepts and philosophy as required.

In any case, #e would like continued target reporting on AMAUTal,

as your time peraits.

1: On 23 September 1969 AMAUTO-1 called an unidentified

Spanish woman

who resided in Cuba

years before re-

turning to Spain. AMAUTO-1 noted that he visited the Spanish

woman's cousin;

identified as Esther CORRIPIO, while he vacationed

in PBRUNEN: and found everyone in good healtn.

The unidentified

Spanish

wosan asked AlAUTO-l if there was much food available

and the follöwing dialogue began:

AUAUTO-1:

yes,

everything is being resolved.

But

imagine to be free, one must pay

a high price and the price must be

paid. There is no other way.

ROHAN:

What one wants, one must pay:

ALAUTO-1:

It is very

logical, but look, when one

is a servant to the rich, the servant

usually lives relatively

well, but the

servant continues as a servant. However,

when one no longer wants to be a servant

to the rich, one has to begin saving and

the only way there is for the poor to

save is to reduce (the intake of essential

foods, change the essential and begin

to buy machines and to buy a series of

things (cuestiones) and one day, we will

• become rich together.

We can say we are

rich when we have resolved all the problems,

not only material problems, but spiritual,

cultural, that is, when everyone can do

and believe as he likes.

Oh! I don't do anything but talk of

country.

I have

a brother there who is

is fine.

AMAUTO-1:

Cuba gets into your blood.

When

Saw Esther

she was a little thin, but

waS

in good health.

We think the above is another good example of AAUTO-1's

passion for the good life.. While he appears patriotic and:

openly supports the regime,

we continue to believe that he would

prefer a return to the relative freedoms enjoyed by his country-

men before the

start of the revolution.
