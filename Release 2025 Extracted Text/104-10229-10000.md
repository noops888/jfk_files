roference dependents, are sumartzed below for station Managua

(IDEN A):

Subijoct was a SOFACT agent undor contract.

MOC provided payment of his $400 monthly salary to.

his dependent prents for two years following pos-

siblo death while engaged on a

WOFACT mission.

After Subject's execution in 1962 the parents received

hia regular monthly

salary until 28 June 1963.

that time Headquarters docided to liquidate the

remaining balance of $6400 and pald this enount in a

lump sum to the parents:

Headquarters considers that

all legal anú serai juligations bave been discharged

and is not inclined to assume any further financial

obligations to the parents.

There is no record of subject's mother being

In accordance with Chief of Station, JNWAVE and Stefan R.

LABANON's telephone conversation on 25 January 1967,-we do not plan

reconsideration of the cases, based on taformation obtatned from

Manuel GUILLOT Castellanos (201-281397)

with reference to

paragraph 2A' of Refcrence B., it ls recommended that Headquarters"

consider the following polnts in favor of the JWAVE proposal that no

further obligation exists to the dependents of Subject and that

payments should not be resumed.

Financial: The. I March 1901 MOC established a monthly

Salary of $200.00

per month, payable to GUILLOTiS parents curing

the time he was in Cuba. The 31 October 196l amendment to the

NOC provided for a salary of $400.00 per month, payable to.

Further, the

NOC provided for 2 years payment of salary to the parents. from

the date of death if due, to operattoral activitles.

for a bonue of up to $750.00 per

$6,400,00 was accepted by them as the final settlement.

There is no record of payments to dependents other than

It-is believed that the financial settlement is in

The last of several.

was arrested on 39 Nny 1902 and executed on

30 August 1962.

Other:

Subjoct wasa friend of Vanuel ARTINE prior

to carly 1950 when Subject Joined ARTINE to

Commande.

Subjeit resumud contat with ARTINE

following

Subject's' arriral in Miami in. 1960.

Re the ARTIME claim in

Reference B that the nother of Subject is in bad health, there

is nothing in the filo rewarding

the mother's health,

but mention

is made of an aunt, Mro. Eloisa CASTELLANO Rosales,

who was in

bad healthide to livor trouble.

According to JWAVE traces

Nrs. CASTELLATO enterod the U.S.A. on 3 July 1963 (A13319405).

In summary, I't is notod that Subjoct was considered as a valuable

asset during the period of his service.

However, it 1s belleved

that the dependents have boen wollapaid according to JAWAVE

policy, and there is no record of their dissatisfaction with

the final settlement.

it to further noted that a close and

Long-time association oxiated between Subject and Manuel ARTiME,

source of the current request for financial assistance to the

dependents.

3.

Jorge FlATORI (Hero and Martyr);

Reference is made to

parngraph 2.B. of Referenco B

which 1g concerned with the possible

increase of paynent to the widow,

Silvia HEREDIA. There is nothing

112; JNWAVE records to indicate that Subject ever worked for WOFACT.

However,

the original AlBUD arrangement for designation of dependents

ellglblo for benefit payments resulted in the addltion of certnin

non-wOFACT cases to the payment rolls. Further, a review of the

original HEW questionnire shows that Mrs. HEREDIA declared her total

income

to be the $175.00 a month AMBUD: payment.

No mention was made

of additional income from the uRR.

Unlöss Hendquarters has information

not available to JihAlT, we strongly recommend no increase in payments

be made.

Reference B.

Francisco ICHSVERRIA Texter 1e the Subject of paragraph 2.C.,

nothing in JIWAVE records to indicate that

Subject was ever employed by WOFACT.

Unless Headquarters has

additional information regarding this case it is recommended that

payments not be Initiated to the wife.

PROM: Nancyo Grats

In order to subalt accurate figures for the approved actuary

study wo bust immediatoly establish some dofinito criteria for survivor

payments in the event the principal dependent in teriinated for cause.

2o. I find it difficult to accept the inheritance formula that JHAVE

says has been SOP, 1. e. when the first dependent is torninated the second

dependent inherits the firet dependent's share and so un down the line.

In the first place, the Station hasn't been consistent in following thie

procedure and

the fact it was originally established by AMUD is no reason

for us to continue it. Regardless of the background for this unrealistio.

procedure it seens that the whole matter 1s now at a point where policy

governirs future pasments should be deternined at the feadquartors level

and the actuary study can't be started until is supply firm ligures that

are not subject to a varioty of changes over the years. Furthemore, the

Station vlovs and clarification of the background leading to the present

procedure, which was roquested ovor a weok ago, has not been forthconing.

3, I think we can live with the following formula as it isn't.

too inconsistent with BSC surylvorship provisions. I discussed the following

with ir. Millian who agroed the provisions seerod to be thoroughly practical

and realistic if you concur.

(b)

ok.

cases where the parents are the solo benoficiaries, in the

payments now received, which would be 3175 instead of the $225

noi recaived by both of them.

When a widou dies or ronarrios, her paytient will be divided

equally arong the surviving minor children in lieu of the praduated

paynents they are nou receiving. This may cost un a littlo more than

just lopping off the utdou's share and continuing the amounts

presently paid to the children but we will nininiza possible

repercussions fron the widow If she is still alive

and remarried.

It 1s also much sore equitable to the children thessolves to share and

share alike in the event the mother dios. An additional provision

should be that as each cliild reaches 21 or marries, his payment will

be terminated, exceut. in those cases where a child is physically or

mentally incapacitated for life. In such cases the child will be

paid for life.

In arisver to any possible static over these provisions we can always

fall back on the original cover story concerning availability of NeUD funda.

4o bay I have your opinion on the above proposal so that I can provide

Mit. Evans with the statistics necessary to start the actuary study without

further delay?

All numbors of the

Committoo nerd present.

Also attending bric tho Chief, Do

Division, the Committee Advisor,

the HUMUTUAL Secretariat (Evany

and Fielde), and Messes, Kenneth MillIon and Earl Willianson

and bris: Nancy Grate representing Wu Division.

The bH repre-

sentatives wore present in conJunction with Item 3 of the Agenda.

2.

Nir. Houston chaired the mecting, and the first iton of

business discussed was iton 3of the Aginda,

1.e.. Ol Division'g

proposal of NUNUTUN, annuities lor depundonts of th Cuban Bri-

rado. M. Million save a summary prosontation on thi Brirade

matter.

He Mentod that the paynents

to the dopendents of the

Cuban

Bricade have boon made since 1961 under Presidontial order,

which order in effect stated that the paynents were to be mado

until rescindod by the presidont.

Since that time, the Agency

has spont approximatoly s17, 000,000 on the overall

program, of

which $12,000,000 represents direct stipends to the beneficiaries.

Vill Division's ry 1967 budget for this matter Is 5397,000, and cur-

rently. 316 Individuals are recolving payments, most of whom aro

repondents of the Brigade. with

the balanco being dependents of the

leros and Martyrs Group and certain Garcia Line crowmen.

The

individuals are preschtly pald though a cover firm with no of-

11clal Government attribution.

It 1s Wil Division's position that

since this program must be continued until terminated by the

resident, it is a long range, overall Agency obligation which

hould not be budreted for nor administored by wn Division.

The

Division vould 1ike

to transfer total esponsibility for the pro-

fran to Project WUMUfUAL by a single premium purchase of anuities.

If the single prentum metliod is

too costly, they would still like

to have the responsibility transferied either by an installment

purchase "or' by the funding method.

Mr. Evans advised the Committee

that he

felt the matter should

be brought to the attention of the

Committoe before NUMUTUAL secured actuarial calculations, since the

l'eus for these calculations will be fairly expensive.

After con-

siderable discussion, the Committce concluded that while the

these raids are available but are not boing used. Ho did not specifically

ask for support to resumo hie activitios.

I told him that while his arguments had cortaln merit, thore were also

other considerations which should bo kept in mind, l.a., that hit-and-run

raids provido a pretera for Castro to turn the acrews of repression harder

on the Cuban prople and to place the blamo for his own failure on external

attacks. Artime acknowledged the validity of these arguments and did not

pursue the matter further.

Artiine said that he had reached the point where he had to think of finding

a job to support his wife and three children.

Ho indicated a preference

for a job that woüld permit him to travel throughout Latin America so

that he could maintair, his contacts in other countries, and asked that I

ict him know if I learned of any opportunities I said I would.

The rest of our conversation ranged ovar a series of points -- Cubela,

Rabel, Gutierrez Menoyo, Huber Matos, the status of political prisoners,

Cästro's security measates, mutual friends in Miami -- but he had nothing

significant to say.

Toward the end of our conversation, he returned to the subjectsof raida to

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH/Cuba

SUBJECT

Recommendations Concerning Paymerits to

Dependents of Brigade Members

1.

A review of the existing files falls to reveal

any

evidence. of a clear-cut policy concerning the duration

öf payments to dependents of Brigade members killed,

captured or missing in action despite the many recommenda-

tions made at various times to resolve this problem.

Thig

lack of policy is implicit in a memorandum from Mr. Helms

to the DDCI dated 23 May

1962 In which he referred to a

Presidential oral

directive that payments to dependents

were to be continued until termination by Presidential

order.

A later memorandum from Mr. Helms to the DCI, dated

S1 December 1962, contained recommendationg for terminating

these monthly payments with a lump sum death payment to

be made to dependents of those killed or missing in action.

Both memoranda are attached for your review.. A memorandum

from Mr. Sterling Cottrell to the Attorney General, dated

1 February 1963, concerning various agreements reached

between Brigade leaders, AUBUD and the Agency, also included

three possible alternatives for resolving the problem of.

dependency payments as follows:

A.

Follow regulations established by the Bureau

of Employment Compensation, 1.e. $1,000 lump sun payment

for loss of life.

Follow U.S. Army practice, 1.e. monthly

payments of $122 or more (depending on rank

of service) for as long as the widow survives and does

not re-marry.

This, Mr. Cottrell pointed out,

would be a

costly program to administer and would cost roughly $300,000

for an indefinite period. (This has proven to be

true):

---

## Page 147

14-00000

Ha: C20: 1-59-9

C.

#lump sum arbitrary payment of $3,000 which

would be a year's dependency at the

highest rite

(250 per

month):

2.

Obvlously. the above recommendations as well as

others proposed at various timos in an effort to terminate

this costly exercise were never acted on and due to the

ко th co

time lag are probably no longor practical.

Tentative

approaches to the probien were ulso made by exploring the

possibility of working out some mechanism by which HEW could

take over disbursements it a reduced rate and periodic

rulings and guidance were requestod from the General

Counsel concerning the legal and

seculily factors inherent

in the proposals.

3.

When the origiral cover mechinism

I was established

for disbursing these payments, the dependents were apparently

advised that such payments would continue

as long ns funds

wore available.

In view of the indefinite time stipula-

tion together with the long-standing demise of the AMBUD

organtention and its relationship to this program, dependents

could reasonably be expected to philosophically accept the

fact that these funds have finally been exhausted: In the

flight of

similar.past experiencos, some carping. and pro-

tosts

from dissident's

can bo anticipated with the usual

security hazards whenever the decision is made to terminate

'this project. These possibilities can hardly justify the

indefinite continuation of this enormous expenditure.of

funds which to date

amounts to approximatcly $2,000,000.00.

Any question that mai

arise as to who has really been foot-

ing this bill is unlikely to cause any

shock to the public

at large after being deluged with roams

of. Cuban postmortems.

4.

The revier and recommendations forwarded by JMWAVE

are comprehensive and appear to be more than generous in

the approach toward a tro-stage cut-off of payments.

I.

do believe the recommendations to immediately cease any

further payments to trustees should be submitted to the.

General Counsel for a ruling on the legal technicalities

Involved in such a step. This may also apply to any

attempt to remove existing funds

from trustees who are con-

sidered to be unreliable or ever dishonest in the administra-

tion of funds under this control.

These trustees were

specifically. designated by Brigade members and the written

authorization to. support such trusteeships are in the

custody of AMTIKI. It would seem that no one but the

principal himsolf or his heirs has the legal right to

revoke a trustecship even in the mishandling

ot lunds.

Based on a revicw of pertinent documents and " discussion

with Mrs. Evle Vidal, who is probably more knowledgeable

of the lacts and nuances of this problem than anyono else,

I have listed bolow some recommendations for your con-

sideration;

In line with recent IMWAVE rocommendations,,

payments to all principal dependents (wives who have not

remarried) be reduced

by 30 July, or as soon as fensible,

to i flat 9100 por month and all minor dependents reducod

to. $25 per month with notification that all paymenty will

coaso 6 sonths fron date of intial reduction.

All socundary

depondents,. such

as dependent parents who reccive separate

chocks of not more than $50 por. month, should be continuod

at the present rate until the final termination dato for

all dependents.

B.

Such adjustments as recommonded

above should

bo uniform and across the board with no attempt-to

evaluate

each case on an individual basis determined by

such factors as outside income, need, etc.

This would

not only tend to create an undestrable socurity hazard but

would couplicate the phasing out of an already complicated

situation.

Furthermore, individuals who have made an

cffort to raise their standard of living by nugmontation

of their income would be justified in fcoling they wore

penalized for having more ambition than some of the lazy

pensioner types.

Once we attempt to play the role of

Solomon as to who is the most worthy or the most noeay,

we lose sight of the fact that all dependents are oqual

as widows whose husbands died for the same cause and we

could expect: no end of recriminations..

Neither should

there be any distinction as is recommended in some instances

by JMWAVe that payments should cease because dependents

happen to reside in Cuba:

They are as entitled to the

samo benefits as those fortunate enough to reside in this

country.

The exception

to this may be justified in those

isolated cases where it is evident that nothing has been

heard Prom such

dependents and they have never received

any benefits from the money paid for their support.

In

these instances payments

to trustees should probably be

terminated immediately if such action is legal.

In the case of

the known prisoners, two

courses

of action could be pursued.

Either cut the prosent

Prior to submitting. recommendations to the

on all the logal and possible security aspects of any

proposal should probably be obtained from tho Genoral Counsol.

I have not explored in depth the background of

Heroes/Martyrs, the majority of which do not appear to

criteria cstablished for Brigade members.

such action could no doubt be defendod as not boing ap-

It has boen my understanding that your proposal

to subnit a memorandum to the 303 Committee

in the immediate

future concerns only recommendations for resolving the

Brigade dependency payments.

If I am incorrect and such

memorandum is to also cover the continued payments to
