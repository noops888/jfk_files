He thought the attached roports vould be of interest to Incoln

Stall tron a soviet roalities standpoint. We also felt that they should

be brought to the attention of Ditialon mongement because the M.O. out -

lined therein 1s boconing & usjor factor 1n doallag with sourcos who have

contact vith sorblos nationals. It has been our experience that the type

of activity outlined has been on a miked Increase, particularly since

the establlahment of the KOB 10th Directorate. Although such activity

by sor logals 1s taking place throughout the continental U.3., undoubtedly

Its greatest impact la being selt in the lier lork and Hashingtos, D.C.

arcan because of the larga sortot doverment establisherute ln both of

these cittes. Por this sranon It rould seen imperative that both HAFO

and NYFO be extremely vigalant for such activity 1n compantes and 1nst1-

tutions with vaich thoy are doaling 1n ardor that it may be rocognized

In order to assist otbor offices in this respect, vo plan to volto in the

noar future an articlo for the DiTIBIOn Newsletter, outllning some of our

axpatiences along these lines.

2. No vere somerbat aisappointed in CI Start's reaction to our

rocont request for asBistance in defensive brleting of the subject of

one of the attached reporte. It seems to be quite clear now that ou

artednel assumption conceraing hia being R.I.S. targeted vas quite cortect

and that there l0 a strong likelleood that hle current trip behind th

3. Judging by the attached material, It would appear that, despite

astabliahed Ball policy (dee our 16 May memorandum re Case 39,790), tbe

opposition:bas seen fit to deflover at least tro of Bell's scientifle

it would

appear that at least one or two Boll sclentists, and there are probably

nore, have been gluing the R.I. 8, more cooperation and reporting than the

In addition, ve stringently admonlahed Schroeder against any

notetaking or photography which could in any vay be conntrued as con-

promising.

Ho also alertod schroeder to the fact that some attompt

aight be rade to use his 'ille's family as leverage in a recrultment

attempt. In this connection, ve pointed out to Schroeder that there

was a strong Ilkellhood that the R.I.S. and/or Bulgarian sorvice vould

nake an approsch to hin during his forthcoming visit to Sorla. An

approach in Bulgarta vould fire the sors an opportunity for disavoral

and also voule provide the proper setting for maxinum utilization of

When Schroader mentioned that his sister-in-law, NU

Monockik, bad Indicated several times in the past that she vould l1ke

to leave Bulgaria, ve strongly admonlabed bin against baking any con-

altirenta to bor, polating out that she may porcibly be co-opted by

an exit thes for his slster-In-law ahould be channeled through the

Us Logation in Sorla: Schrooder vas told that, 1i any pressure vere
