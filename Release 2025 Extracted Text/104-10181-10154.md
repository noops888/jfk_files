He is married and has two.daughters

There is an MVD militia unit, called an internal

Source, thought that the term

"parasitism.

(tungyadstvo) had recently been removed from the USSR Criminal

Code and replaced by

"vagrancy begging and other parasttic types

of existence." But the official procedures remain the same.:

Soviet citizens not engaged in socially productive labor are

first given

warning, which they must sign at the departments

If they remain unemployed, their case is turned over to a court,

and the offense is punishable by a sentence of up to two years.

However:

there

are

ways to. get around the

law.

•Source says

that if

it can

be: shown that parents or a spouse are providing

support or if a person can get seasonal work, he can defend

himself before the department.

But most citizens are not aware

of these loopholes, according to Source.

After the Investigations

Department, this militia department turns over the greatest

number of

citizens to the courts.

Also,

this department and

the law that it enforces are frequently used against dissidents.

Source asked AXSENOV

who is selected

and for what reasons.

AKSENOV replied that the kGB

usually

uses spotters, who recommend people for recruitment. Back-

ground is

important.

A person from a peasant or worker's family is

considered a better choice, and he must either be a quiet

and colorless

type who blends into the circle of people in which he operates. or

else a conspicuous loudmouth who asks embarrassing questions:

The

latter would be more likely suspect of being a member of the opposi-

The average informant, according

to AKSENOV,

Source says that he was never recruited.

Both Source and AKSENOV think that

from the big cities the KGB is an all-powerful

instrument, and anyone who refuses just to report on the conversations

list is the discovery of the

last item would not be considered

can do very well

of the illegal

FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

Keeping of Large Sums of Money in the Soviet Union

SOURCE

(201 0948382), a foreign-language student from Minsk

who worked in numerous jobs throughout the USSR.

Born in 1949,

he emigrated in 1976.

Neither his bona

fides nor his reporting reliability has beep

established.

DATE OF INFORMATION: 1972-76

DATE OF INTERVIEW

26-28 April 1971

1::

unless you nave tron-clad proof that you got the money

legally;

the balance of your account in

any one savings bank

(sberkassa) should not exceed a thousand rubles. Each savings

bank has a militia representative who reports suspiciously large

accounts to the OBKhSS (Department for Combatting the Embezzlement

of Socialist Property and Speculation) of the militia for investiga-

tion.

Source got this information from a militia lieutenant who

was an OBKhSS öfficer in his rayon.

Since savings banks do not haveza centralized accounting

system,

another way of keeping large amounts of money is

accounts in several banks, as long as none of them exceeds the

thousand-ruble limit.

3..

One of the best ways of keeping money when traveling, or

at home, is in the form of an akkreditiv (a personalized

cashier's check).

An akkreditiv can be bought. at any bank or

savings institution and can be cashed anywhere at any time but

only by the person to whom

it is made out and only or presentation

of án internal passport.

without

the passport, the akkreditiv

cannot be cashed, thereby making it a safer form of keeping money

than currency.

4.

If money is to be kept at home, it is somewhat less

suspicious.to have. it in the form of.three-percent government loan

bonds (trekhprotsentnyy zaem)

These are not personalized and can

be cashed at any.

small discount. They also have the

advantage of

Most of this

lieutenant of the KGB, and

other friends and classmates of Source who are at present KGB

and

militia officers.

AKSENOV was at that time in charge of

the KGB unit in the Yubileynaya Hotel, Minsk.

In each tourist hotel in Minsk there is a so-called

militia unit whose purpose is to protect foreigners, maintain

order in the hotel, and prevent black-marketing.

Actually, this

unit is manned by KGB representatives in militia uniforms who

carry militia as well as KGB identification.

The militia seems

to be the favorite cover for the KGB.

3.

in the rubileynaya Hotel this unit always had four or

five persons on duty.

During the

day it had

persons had access to the hotel:

All other Soviet citizens

would

An offiger from such a unit once stopped Source

He released

AKSENOV'S KGB subordinate..

The KGB also

and Source continued drinking in the room.

Source did not pay

too much attention to detalls, but. at one

point, apparently in order to impress Source with KGB capabilitles.

AKSENOV showed the Source a tape recorder, which was of foreign

or Baltic republic make,

and let him listen through the earphones

to what was being recorded. from.a room

Source

claimed

that he could-hear all the sounds In

Source

was unable to.recall whether there was more than one tape recorder

in the room or how

one recorded segment was distinguished from

another on

the tapes.

He presumed that it was done by voice

announcement, but he

did not remember seeing a microphone which

would be used

for this.purpose.

None of these technical details

were.explained. either then or later by AKSENOV.

AKSENOV:

never mentioned any phone surveillance and Source

presumed that this

is done in

a different location, outside

the hotel.

"6.

In subsequent conversations, AKSENOV told Source that

all rooms occupied

by foreigners are

listened to by a spot check

from the time that the occupant enters his room. There is apparently

a device which indicates when this occurs.

The running of water

as an audio hindrance

is a useless measure. AKSENOV said, as

are able to eliminate this as well as many

other extraneous:

noises in order to make the conversations

SAG Memo Dated 8 April 1977

1:

Reference alerts us to provide OT require

ments for SE/SAG/OP's scheduled debriefing of two

Soviet emigres--Sergei UZLOV and Boris PALANT. ' We are

keenly interested in what these two persons have to

say about the young

French interpreters People who graduated from the

faculty and proceeded to posts

in Africa, as several of these names are familiar.to

us as leads.

We are even more interested in background

and

assessment data on the three military instructors

TARASENKO, LIPIN,

and VOROBEV, who are currently in

Africa and of interest to this branch.

addition to straight bio and assessment

data,

we would like answers to the following:

A.

What were

the career and personal

objectives/goals of these young persons who

accepted assignments in Africa?: Were they

aware of the climactic/sociological/anthro-

pological differences/difficulties they would

encounter. in Africa?

Did they accept their

assignments primarily to save money?. Were

any of them looking upon their African assign-

ments

as a forn of "'escape" from the Soviet

Union?

Had any of them ever mentioned suffering

mistreatment by the KGB or the Party?

B.

Did the two sources have the oppor

tunity

to talk to any. Soviet interpreters

who had returned from tours in Africa? sIf so,

what did these persons have to say about the

climactic/sociolosical/anthropological problems

they had encountered there,

and how they handled

them: African assignments are parricularly

difficult for Soviets who do not adapt easily

to conditions in Africa.

Bécause this rnabrity

adaptito African conditions is operationally

exploitables we would like to learn as muer

about it as possible. We would also be inter-

ested in what they said about their duties as

interpreters.
