Operational Exploitation of shrushcher Visit to Cuba

l. Jala memorandum is for the Director's information only and doas

not scquire action.

An Invitation by the Government of Cuba to Khrughcher to visit

that country has bean ofilcially accepted, but as yet no definite time has

been sot. There has been speculation that Khrushchow wcald arrive in

Habana for the 26ta of July calebrations, wbile a preas report, confirming

a statement of the Soviet Ambaasador in Mexico, predicts the arrival for

ragust.

Earlier reports had suggested December 1450 or Jazuary 1961

as possible dates.

3. Is 1s felt that a successful vialt by ahrushcher io cubs would ascist

furthor in the stablishment of a soiid Soviet understanding with that country,

with disturbing overtones on the possible establiahmeni of closer Soviet

relationships in other parta of Latin America, For this reason it le

desirable so prevent the visit or to counteract it by a show of massive

opposition by tho Cuban poople.

4. On 21 3une the Habana Station was ashed for its viewy on possure

plans.

In the exchange of cables that has followed, the Statios and Menagumor!

aro now in agreement that the best course of action lies in luo operationi.

First, a massive church manifestation or rally to be called for some othor

purpose would afford the peoplo oi Cuba an obvious way to expresa their

protest, Second, the inatigation of sumors that Khrushcher's life will be

in danger while in Cuba from a vell-planned assassination attempt would

be propagated from other latin american countries.

5. Eecause of the nead of avolding action is Cuba di: this trator tuni

would imperil Station assets, it has beon detercined that such assets wowdi

be uned only an a reons of dustigating the church to hold the sally.

Subject: Khrushchev Visit to Cuba

1.

Bäckground. An Invitation to visit Cuba has been extended

to Khrushchev by ibe Goverment of Cuba. The invitation has been

accepted, but do definite time has been set..

There has been sons

spoculation that Khrushchey would arrive in Havana in time for the

celebrations of the 26th of July. The press has reported that he

will arrive in August (a date confirmed by a statement of the Soviet

Ambassador in Mexico). Other reports say the visit will not take

place for several months, probably in December or January. In any

event we must plan for the possibility of the July visit.

It has been stated from several sanguine quarters that we

should "do the same thing to Khrushchev. that the Japs did to Eisen-

hover". This 1s a complataly unrealistic arean.

It is tive that & successful Khrushcher visit to Cube

would be the final sure in the construction of a solid Soviet

base in Cuba, with disturbing overtones for the possible construction

for more Soviet ideoligical bases in all of Istin America, For that

reason we are trying to do what we can to prevent the visit, or at

least to show a massive set opposition to it.

2. Exploitationplane.

On 21 June Hqs sent a cable to Havarz

asking for views on possibility of a major effort to force cancellation

of the visit. A resulting series of cables shows that the station and

headquarters are now in agroement that our best hope lies in

thout cali ed

a. A massive Church manifestation or rally, which

though called for some other purpose, would be to the perple

of Cuba an obvious way to express their protest. Ana

Do Iron outside cuba, instigating of runors that

Khrushcher's life will be in danger fas frch a well-plannoa

assassination attenpt.

3. Mr. Helms has told a us that he wants CIA to undertake no

action that will imperil Station essets.

This injunction was placed

on us while we were exchanging cables with Havana. The result is that

station assets are actively Irstigatiry the church to hold the rally.

A Filikrant cable from Headquarters has instructed the station to

continue this course of action as long as there is "safety in nunbers""

1.0., as long as it is a church action rather that an AMPALM one.
