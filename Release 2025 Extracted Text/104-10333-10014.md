Re:

Proposal for a Multi-Agency Declassification Review of Joseph Califano's Army

Papers under the JFK Act

Gentlemen:

The Assassination Records Review Board would like to make arrangements with you to

declassify six boxes of Army records from the files of Joseph Califano. The files date

rincipally from the period 1962-63, during which Mr. Califano served as Army Gener

ounsel and as Special Assistant to the Secretary of the Army. The records had bee

Deadlines

Due to the volume of the records, and the Review Board's current sunset date of

September 30, 1997, it is important that we proceed expeditiously in our review of the

records.' We have slated the Califano papers for review by the Board at its August 5-6, 1997

meeting. The Review Board staff is prepared to assist you in making arrangements for a

prompt and efficient review of the Califano papers.

Preliminary Review of Calijano Papers

The Review Board staff has conducted an initial review of the records and has

tentatively reached the following conclusions: first, the records are very similar in

subject manner to many other records that already are a part of the JFK Collection;

second, although the vast majority of the records technically remain classified, there is

little remaining sensitivity due to the passage of time and to the release of much of the

information in other contexts; and third, the Califano papers contain equities of

numerous military and non-military agencies, which, under the standard referral

process, would be very difficult and time-consuming? Thus, the logistical problem in

declassifying the records is not the continued sensitivity of the records, but the number

of agencies that will need to review their own equities in the records. For this reason,

and for the short time-line on which we are now operating, we believe that there is an

urgent need to make acceptable arrangements for the review and referral of records.

Proposal

each other and quickly to resolve questions.

is. lon Bowie, of the Army Declassification Activity, spent three day

eviewing some of the records and making recommendations for referrals to othe

gencies both within and outside of the military. Although Ms. Bowie worke

nergetically for three days, it was our sense afterwards that, if we continue at the same

pace, the agencies with equities will likely not be able to complete their reviews before

the August deadline arrives.

Department of Defense are agreeable to such an arrangement, the Review Board will

take the responsibility for contacting all non-military agencies with equities in the

records while Army and DoD make arrangements for all appropriate military entities to

be present.

We are, of course, very willing to consider other ideas or suggestions that you might

have. However, because the clock is ticking, it is important that we promptly develop a

plan that will provide all agencies with equities in the Califano papers to have an

opportunity to review and declassify their equities.

I look forward to discussing this issue with you.

JOSEPH CALIFANO PAPERS (6 boxes)

identified by Steve Tilley at NARA, these 6 boxes of papers, almost exclusively fron

1962-63, were either generated by, or addressed to Joseph Califano, who at this tim

was Department of the Army General Counsel and Special Assistant to the Secretary of

the Army. Most of the documents are short summaries of proposed policy positions, or

letters of transmittal, with voluminous appendices attached. Each of the 6 boxes

contains approximately 1500-2000 pages of material.

Representative Topics:

(1)

ICCCA (Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee of Cuban Affairs-the

"Cottrell Committee") meetings on future U.S. policy toward Cuba. Thes

documents are generally background papers prepared prior to meetings

minutes of meetings, or follow-on discussion of action items assigned at

meetings of the ICCCA.

(2)

Contingency plans for Cuban invasion by the U.S. military in the event of

a Cuban uprising.

(3)

(4)

Psychological warfare against Cuba.

Diplomatic initiatives intended to increase isolation of Cuba.

(5)

Biographies, and evaluations of Cuban exile leaders.

(6)

(7)

Intelligence reports and estimates on reported events inside Cuba.

Summaries of clandestine paramilitary actions taken against Cuba, and

suggestions for possible future actions.

Apparent Equities:

Ninety-five per cent of the documents appear to have multiple-agency equities,

usually 4 to 6 agencies per document. Based upon staff review, it is estimated

that 80% of the documents have State equities, 60% Joint Staff or OSD, 60% NSC,

60% CIA, 15% Army, Navy or Air Force, perhaps 10% DIA, and a small

percentage of USIA, Justice, Treasury and FBI.

JOINT STAFF PAPERS (147 documents)

Using broad topic guidelines provided previously.by ARRB staff, the Joint Staff at the

Pentagon has reviewed 40 boxes of records of Joint Chiefs Chairmen Lyman Lemnitzer,

Maxwell Taylor, and Barle Wheeler for 1961-1964, as well as JCS central files for 1962

and 1963, and has flagged 147 documents which will enhance the historical

understanding of the Kennedy administration, and which some scholars will believe

may be relevant to the assassination.

Topics:

(1) ICCC (Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee of Cuban Affairs)

meetings regarding future U.S. policy toward Cuba.

(2)

Special Group (5412 committee) meetings and decisions; and covert

paramilitary operations against Cuba.

(3) • Cuban coup planning.

(1)

(5)

Vietnam coup planning, and discussion of Diem and Nhu.

OPLAN 34A (covert actions against North Vietnam).

U.S. military strength levels in Vietnam.

Apparent Bquities:

Multiple agency equities appear to apply to virtually every document-usually

State, OSD and/or NSC. The Joint Staff has stated in writing that it is prepare

o expeditiously process these documents for declassification in collaboratio

with agencies which have equities, and then accession the declassified

documents to NARA. Currently the Joint Staff is awaiting guidance from ARRE

staff on which of the tabbed folders we desire to have placed in the collection;

upon receipt of that guidarice, they will commence declassification review.

"The Joint Staff's Initial Statement of Compliance to the Review Board, dated

February 6, 1997, identified in detail the process by which these records were located-

McBride, Chief of the Joint Staff Information Management Division, indicated in this

statement that the Joint Staff was standing by to expeditiously process these records for

declassification in collaboration with other agencies when the ARRB was ready. ARRB

staff has only recently completed its initial review of these records, which constitute

selectively flagged folders within 40 boxes of JCS and Joint Staff records.

agencies for their review. It has been our own experience that sessions of this sort

greatly simply the review process by giving agencies the opportunity to speak with

each other and quickly to resolve questions.

Because these papers will need to be reviewed by the Board at its August 5-6 meeting,

we believe that an arrangement such as is proposed above will provide all agencies

with a full opportunity to identify their equities in the records and to make

1. Operation SMASHER:

a. Objective: The objective is to disrupt/disable military and

commercial communications facilities in Cuba.

Concept: This to be accomplished by the clandestine introduction of

a "special" vacuum tube into selected communications equipment. The tube,

which is available, is virtually undetectable inasmuch as its effectiveness is

due to the insertion of a chemical compound in the base of the tube. The

chemical, when heated becomes a conductor, when cool a non-conductor.

2. Operation FREE RIDE:

.?.

a. Objective: The objective is to create unrest and dissension amongst

the Cuban people.

b. Concept: This to be accomplished by airdropping valid Pan American

or KLM one-way airline tickets good for passage to Mexico City, Caracas,

etc. (none to the U.S.). Tickets could be intermixed with other leaflets

planned to be dropped.

The number of tickets dropped could be increased

The validity of the tickets would have to be restricted to a time period

3. Operation TURN ABOUT:

a. Objective: The objective is to create indications to Fidel Castro that

his value to the revplutionary cause has diminished to the point where plans are?

being made for his "removal".

b. Concept: This to be accomplished by the use of intelligence means the

crecendo increasing until it culminates in Castro's discovery of the mechanism

Operation DEFECTOR:

Objective: To induce elements or individuals of the Cuban military to

defect with equipment.

b. Concept: This activity when properly planned and implemented has the

effect of decreasing military capability. In a totalitarian system the immediate

reaction is increased security accompanied by decreased activity. It also

creates havoc in security and intelligence agencies. Could be accomplished

by intelligence means and promise of rewards.

•5. Operation BREAK-UP:

Objective: To clandestinely introduce corrosive materials to cause

aircraft, vehicle or boat accidents.

b. Concept: This activity, if possible should be aimed primarily toward the Eer:

Soviet-provided aircraft. I properly accomplished it would degrade confidence

in the equipment, increase supply and maintenance problems and seriously

affect combat capability.

6. Operation COVER-UP:

a. Objective: The objective is to convince the Communist government of

Cuba that Naval Forces ostensibly assigned to the MERCURY project is merely

b. Concept: It should not be revealed as to what the cover is--this should

be left to conjecture. This could tie in with Operation DIRTY TRICK.

7. Operation DIRTY IRICK:

a. Objective: The objective is to provide irrevocable proof that, should

the MERCURY manned orbit flight fail, the fault lies with the Communists

et al Cuba.

b. Concept: This to be accomplished by manufacturing various pieces of

evidence which would prove electronic interference on the part of the. Cubans.

8: Operation FULL-UP:

Objective: The objective is to destroy confidence in fuel supplied by the

Soviet Bloc by indicating it is contaminated.

"Concept: This to be accomplished by introducing a known biological

agent into jet fuel storage facilities. This agent flourishes in jet fuel and

grows until it consumes all the space inside the tank.

9. Operation PHANTOM:

a. Objective: The objective is to convince the Castro Government that

clandestine penetration and resupply of agents is being regularly conducted.

b. Concept: This to be accomplished by use of BJ, UDT, AND JJ capa-

bilities to create the impression that landings have been made on beaches

and air drops have been made in other areas.

10. Operation BINGO:

a. Objective: The objective in to create an incident which has the appeazanceun:

of an attack on U.S. facilities (GMO) in Cuba, thus providing the excuse for

use of U.S. military might to overthrow the current government of Cuba.

b. Concept: This to be accomplished by the use of SNAKES outside the

confines of the Guantanamo Base. SNAKES simulate an actual fire-fight and

upon hearing such a sound it is entirely feasible that the immediate reaction

on G'Mo would be that the base is being attacked. This would, with proper

preparation,

until other forces, which had been previously alerted, could attack in other

areas. It is envisaged that a schedule of operations similar to the following

would overwhelm the Cuban military and cause its defeat:

(1) Simulated attack on Guantanamo.

(2) Word flashed to the President..

(3) President orders counterattack to include:

(a) Immediate launch of alerted aircraft whose targets are Cuban airfields.

(b) Immediate launch of counterattack down strategic lines in communi-

cation in Cuba.

(c) Fleet force standing by on alert would make way toward pre-selected

targets/landing areas.

(d) Immediate embarkation of airborne troops previously alerted to

pre-selected targets.

(e) Launch of additional combat aircraft to clear drop areas and

further interdict lines of communication.

(f) Ships and aircraft would land/airdrop troops and secure airfields,

road/rail terminals, etc.

(g) Resupply and replacement activities.

Properly executed, the above could overthrow the Cuban Government in a

matter of hours, providing the plan is implemented within the next six months.

11. Operation GOOD TIMES:

Objective: To disillusion the Cuban population with Castro image by

distribution of fake photographic material.

b. Concept: Prepare a desired photograph, such as an obese Castro

with two beauties in any situation desired, ostensibly within a room in the -

Castro residence, lavishly furnished, and a table briming over with the most

delectable Cuban food with an underlying caption (appropriately Cuban) such as

I'My ration is different. " Make as many prints as desired on sterile paper and

then distribute over the countryside by air drops or agents. This should put

even a Commie Dictator in the proper perspective with the underprivileged

12. Operation HEAT IS ON:

• a. Objective: To create the impression with Castro Government that

certain dyed-in-tbe-wool Red pilots are planning to defect, thus causing a

detrimental tightening of security.

b. Concept:. It is known that many Cuban refugee pilots are personally

acquainted with many of the present CRAF pilots. Accordingly, by utilizing

all sources available, determine by name those pilots considered to be dedicated

Castro Reds. Then by use of agents, communications, etc. inject into the

Castro intelligence system the fact that these pre-designated Reds are planning

to defect for monetary and/or ideological reasons. Security crackdowa should

help destroy Castro image and also impose unacceptable restrictions on

routine training activities.

CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS:

The Air Force can utilize the operational characteristics of F-101

or other Century series aircraft to create the impression that anti-Castro

opposition is continuing. The aircraft operational characteristic to be

exploited is the "sonic-boom. "

3. The "sonic-boom" can be employed in several different ways such

as an individual boom at selected spots or a continuous boom and performed

t either high or low altitudes. It will cause not only apprehension bu

arying degrees of malicious damage as well, i.e. break all the window

on a street in Havana.

Operation TRUE BLUE

1. Objective: To degrade Castro and his government in the eyes of the

Cuban peoplf by communications intrusion.

Concept of Operations:

2. By utilizing high powered transmitters in the vicinity of Cuba

(Florida, Inagwa, Jamaica,

aboard Naval ship) which have the capability of

overriding commercial Cubay radio and TV stations, periodically degrade

Castro and other government figures in the minds of the Cuban people.

3. The technique of communications intrusion could be exploited by pre-

taping or live broadcasts of anti-communist and anti-Castro propaganda at

station breaka, Castro speeches, etc. This idea envisions the u8e of a

Cuban refugee to make such broadcasts and naturally would require close

monitoring of stations to be worked. Any number of thoughts could be

injected such as:

a.

"Cuba Si, Russia No."

Communism exploits the masses.

c. Communism is ruthless totalitarianism.

d. Castro and henchment feast off the land while we are rationed.

e. Castro and his reign of terror.

Castro is a lunatic and should be put away.

Castro is the cause of all our troubles.

h. Rise up against the pig Castro, etc. etc.

4. If approved this operation could become a continuous project, perhaps

under control of USIA.

1. Objective: To confuse and harrass Castro Cuban Pilota by use of

radio conversations.

2. Concept of Operations: Fly Cuban refugee pilot in sterile aircraft

in proximity of Cuba at periodic intervals while communication monitoring

Cuban air/ground frequencies utilized for airdrome control. Cuban refugee

pilot in sterile aircraft would personally know many of the pilots still flying

for Castro. Refugee pilot would get into argument with Castro pilots over

radio thus distracting confusing, etc. Would be real trouble for Castro

pilots in actual weather conditions. Argument could go, "I'll get you you

ONE SAID

I. Operation SMASHER.

1. Objective: Disrupt or disable military and commercial communications

facilities in Cuba.

2. Technical Requirements:

a. Detailed information on both commercial and military communi-

cations facilities and capabilities, to include inside and outside plant

construction, system networks, equipment details (i.e. circuitry, tubes, etc.)

location and type of repeator stations. This information is required to

construct a refined device.

b. A vacuum tube modified in such a manner as to cause a short

circuit.

This is possible by inducing silicon carbide (?) into the base of the

tube.

When the tube becomes hot the silicon carbide liquifies and becomes

a conductor; when the tube cools the matter returns to a solid non-conductive

state. Such a device (vacuum tube) is available.

3. Targets:

2. Cuban Telephone Company. The company provides local and long

distance telephone service throughout Cuba and also international telepbone

service.

b. Radio Corporation of Cuba Avenida Carlos. The company provides

radiotelephone service to American and European countries. It also provides

radiotelegraph service and includes leased teleprinter channels. In conjunc-

tion with AT&T the company inaugurated over-the-horizon microwave radio

service between Cuba and Florida in 1957. This latter made available two-way

TV channels.

C. Cuban American Telephone and Telegraph Company. Founded by

IT&T and AT&T, providing six (6) submarine cables linking Havana and Key

West. Facility operates in conjunction with microwave link.

d. Commercial Radio and Television Stations.

• Military Radio and Land-line Facilities. These include point-to

point command and administrative systems, air/ground facilities, navigationa

aids. Obviously certain commercial facilities provide service to the military

therefore disrupting or disabling commercial facilities will affect militar;

communications capabilities.

PACTS EBARING ON THE PROBLEM

2. It is recognized that any action which beoomes pretext

deoiaion which then would lead to military aotion.

3. Cognizande has been taken of a suggested course of

aotion proposed** by the US Navy relating to generated

4. For additional faots see Enolosure B.

DISCUSSION

5. The suggeated coursegof action appended to Enolosure A

are based on the premise that US nilitary Intervention will

result from a perlod of heightened US-Cuban tensions which

place the United States In the position of suffering Justir-

lable grievanoes.

as yet no bilateral mutual support agreement binding the USSR

to the defense of Cuba, Cuba has not yet becone a member of the

Warraw Pact, not have the Sovlets established Soviet bases

In Cuba In the pattern of US bases in Western Europe. Therefore,

since time appears to be an important factor in resolution of

the Cuba problem, all projects are suggested within the time

frame of the next few months.

CONCLUSION

..7. The suggested courses of action appended to Enclosure A

satisfactorily respond to the statement of the problem. However,

these suggestions-should be forwarded as a preliminary submisaion

suitable fof planning purposes, and together with similar inputs

from other agencies, provide a basis for development of a single,

Integrated, time-phased plan to focus all efforts on the

objective, of Justification for US military Intervention in Cuba.

RECOMMENDATIONS

8. It is recommended that:

a. Baclosure A together with 1ts attachments should be

forwarded to the Secretary of Defense for approval and

transmittal to the Calof of Operat10n8, Guba Projecte

...-..b- This paper NOT ba, forwarded to commanders of unified

Exploding a few plastio bombs in carefully chosen spota, the

additional provocation. Harasiment of 01v1l alr, attacks on

surface shipping and destruction of US military drone airoraft

by MIG type planes would be useful as complementary aotlons..

An F-86 properly painted would convince aff passengers that they

saw a Cuban MIQ, especlally if the pilot of the transport were

to announce such faot. The primary drawback to this suggestion

appears to be the seourity risk inherent in obtaining or modify-

Ing an aircraft. However, reasonable copies of the MIG could

be produced from US resources in about three months.

Their mission will be to reverse course and simulate fakin

atroraft for an air defense exeroise in southern Florida.

These airoraft would conduot varlations of these flights at

frequent intervals. Crens rould be briefed to remain at

least 12 miles off the Cuban coast; however, they would be

required to carry live ammunition in the event that hostile

actions were taken by the Cuban MIce.

D. on one such flight, a pre-briefed pilot would sly

tall-end Charley at considerable Interval between airoraft.

While near tha Cuban Ioland this pilot rould broadoast that

he had been Jumped by Mids and was going down. No other

oalls would be made: The pilot would then fly directly

west at extremely low altitude and land at a

seoure base, an

Eglin axlllary. The atroraft would be met by the proper

people, quickly stared and given a new tall number. The

pilot who had performed the mission under an allas, would

resume his proper identity and return to his normal plaos

of business. The pilot and airoraft would then have

disappeared.

o. At precisely the same time that the aircraft was

presumably shot down a submarine or small surface craft

would disburse F-101 parts, parachute, eto., at approximately

15 to 20 miles off the Cuban coast and depart. The pilots

DISCUSSION

INTRODUCTION

1. Purpose. This report is in response to a request from

the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staif, to consider the desira-

bility and reguirements of a fomented revolt in Cuba. It

includes an examination of engineering an incident or a series

of incidents as, a cause for invasion and consideration of

pertinent comments received froM CINCLANT.

2. Summary. Study of the desirability and the requirements

of a fomented revolt in Cuba and of the advantages of

engineering an incident of a series of incidents rather than

trying to generate and coordinate action from inside Involving

many Cubans of doubtful reliability leads to the conclusions

that:

a. It 1s unlikely that an effective spontaneous revolt

will occur in the near future.

b. Any uprising without US overt. support is likely to

be short-lived because of the improved Cuban/Soviet •

military capabilities presently in Cuba and Castro's.

Increasingly efficient internal security operations.

c. There appears to be little likelihood that the Castro

communist regime will risk a direct provocation that

could be used as a pretext for US intervention.

d. Unless the United States Intervenes militarily, the

Castro government will become more firmly entrenched and Its

efforts and ability to spread international communism s1ll

increase.

e. The Unlted States should Intervene militarily in

Cuba and could (a) engineer provocative incidents ostensibly

perpetrated by the castro regime to serve as the cause of

Invasion or (b) foment a revolt within Cuba which would

call for Us military intervention.

s. Engineered provocation would provide greater advantages

In control, timing, simplicity, and security than would a

fomented revolt. It would be most difficult to generate a

widespread effective revolt. However, the staging of a local

uprising as a contrived incident should not be precluded.

g. The United States should:

(1) Initiate a coordinated program to create a pre-

text for US military Intervention in Cuba.

(2) In support of the above, undertake a flezibly

phased effort to büild Cuban resistance potential, com-

menairg with the;intensification of intelligence collec-

tion and sabotage in Cuba, and the creation of a frame-

work for guerrilla activity.

(3) At a propitious time, launch appropriate military

aotion to remove the Castro communiat government.

h. Implementation of the above would involve many

agenoles of the United States Government.

It would appear

necessary that one governmental organization should. be

given the primary responsibility for developing such a

national plan. The Joint Chiefs of Staff should participate

in the development of this national plan.

1. The broad concepts herein and the views of the Joint

Chiefs of Staff should be forwarded to the Speciai Group

(5412 Comnittee) for consideration under the provisions of

NSAM 57.

J. CINCLANT's concept for fomenting a revolt in Cuba

while containing much merit, should be re-examined both

for 1ts tining and for the large-scale guerrilla activity

1t envisages.

b. Conduct physical and psychological military harassuent

of the Cuban regime and covert and clandestine operations as

directed.

c. Undertake military action in Cuba In accordance with

contingency plans approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and.

directed by the President. The primary purpose of the Us

milItary Intervention would be to assure the overthron of

the castro communist government and to assist in the establish.

ment of a new, non-communist government acceptable to the

United States.

20. The Implementation of any of the suggested courses of

action 1, this study would Involve many agencies of the United

States Government. It would appear necessary, therefore, that

one single governmental. organization be given the primary

responsibillty for developing a national plan.

21.. Beause of the extensive military operations involved,

the Joint Chiefs of Staff should participate in the development

of this national plan.

In addition, for a contrived revolt,

they should be assigned the specific responsibility for develop-

ing the milltary and paramilitary aspects of the plan. Ih1s

would require the Joint Chiefs of Staff to seek a determination

under NSAM 57 when a revolt contrived by the United States were

an operation large enough to warrant control of covert forces

by the Department of Defense and that CINCLANT be designated as

the DOD agent. In this connection, CINCIANT has developed a

вpec1f1c concept for political and milltary action in Cuba.

CINCLANT CONCEPT

22. The CINCLANT concept provides for inciting a revolt in

Cuba, followed by overt, large-scale US military operations.

The proposed timing of operations permits completion in 15-18

months. Supporting operations by CIA, State, and USIA will

be required.

23. Preliminary operations require the introduction by CIA

as soon as practicable of assets into Cuba for thè development

of Intelligence, the organization by State of a Free Cuban

Government (FCQ), the development of a propaganda plan by USIA, and

the development of a suitable cover plan.

24. Actual operations would commence with the execution by

CINCLANT of OPIAN 380-63 about 15 January 1964. This plan calls

for Infiltrating of UN forces into Cuba for area assessment,

establishing guerrilla bases, developing military units,

establishing escape and evasion nets and conducting subversion.

On about 15 June 1964, UW forces would be augmented and would

accelerate subversive operations to create conditions favorable

for establishing a Free Cuban Government on Cuban soil and for

employnent of conventional forces.

25. CINCIANT then proposed that on about 15 July mobilization

of forces for US conventional operations would begin. Exeaution of

•CINCLANT. OPLAN 312 would comnence on 26 July 1964 followed by

D-Iay OPIAN 316; about 3 Auguot 19€4..

26. Although the foregoing schedule is approximate, it should

be noted that the Free Cuban Government would be required to

exist at least for 18 days in the face of the Castro government's

excellent counterguerrilla ability. This time requirement appears

to be excessive, but. it could be shortened.. The criteria for

United States recognition of a new government could be met in

this period. The Free Cuban Government could claim it:

a. Has in actual possession of the governmental machinery.

b. Mas administering it with general acceptance by the

population; and,

c. Was prepared to honor international obligations:

activation of a separate headquarters. In this case, CINCIANT

would re-evaluate his staff capabilities and submit appropriate

recommendations to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

30. CINCIANT In a related outline concept recommended, con-

cerning the use of Cuban nationals in UW operations, that "AB

practical, the Military Services should Initially form their

Cuban nationals Into Integral, all Cuban units...". It 1s

considered that the oreation of a "Cuban Expeditionary Force" In

antioipation of 1ts employment in the execution of OPIAN 316 18

& risk nich cannot be Justifled and should not be undertaken.

There appears to be no reason, however, why Cubans could not be

formed Into small teams for use In Ul activities. It 18 estimated

that from two to four hundred carefully selected Cubans could be

used In this role. It rould be appropriate for the CIA In a

supporting role to select and train'the individuals forming them

Into teams of appropriate alze to be made avallable for joint use

by CINCLANT or by CIA, as necessary.

31. For other details of training Cuban nationals, see

JCSM-350-63:

32. The force levela in CINCIANI OPIANS 312 and 316 are adequate

to cope with the Improved Cuban nilltary capability and the

presence of Soviet troops on the Island.

33. The experience of the JUWIFA during the Cuban crials In

October 1962, Indicates that the present military supply system

In the CONUS w1ll be unable Immediately to provide equipment and

34. The conceptual outline submitted by CINCLANT does not.

provide an exact plan in detail for contriving a revolt in

Cuba. However, his general concept rould provide for:

"a. Incremental steps in replacing the present communist

donnated government of Cuba by infiltration, subversion,

unconventional warfare, limited conventional actions and

finally full-scale invasior in that order, if necessary.

b. The capability of US to withdraw at any point. in the

process 11 unfavorable international reactions or pressures

require it; or .1I the Cuban people thewselves, in a successful

revolt, overthrow the present regime and form a government

lavorable to US Interests.

c. An ambiguous atmosphere during the critical phases

In its development which would not present the Sovlets with

a direct. confrontation of power until events would preclude

timely action on their part to prevent our intended result

in Cuba.

d. Utilization of the OAS Form and support without being

dependent upon DAS approval or disapproval for the necessary

Intermediate steps leading up to OAS recognition of a Cuban

Government in exile and the final, decisive military action.

e. Maximum utilization of the Cuban refugee elements

in the US for political and military support without

depending upon their effectiveness for the ultimate success

of the plan.

I. No maldeployment of US forces, affecting the over-all

US military posture, until the final decisive stages of

the plan are ready for execution, thus reducing maldeployment

time.

g. The most economical use of US resources to accomplish

the defeat of Castro communism.

ho A definite tiue scale of events culminating in the

defeat of Castro's communist government and establishing

the groundwork for the Installation of a government compatible

with the alms of the OAS and friendly to the US by 1 October

a. The President was must intercuted in economic dental

actiong.

Lie was informed that tallis would ba undertaken in the

iinmediate future with represchiztives of the Canadian and Britich

governments relative to the cupply of spare parts and critical materials

by Canadian and British firms to Cubi. It vas stated that Spanioh firme

-re likewine activo in this area, as well as a number of essentially

ily-by-night firs located in a number of foreign countries. No

.:putable inexican firms arc ergagce in supplying Cuba and, in fact.

rave been halpul in proventing their foreign affillates from engaging

i this craific.

Apparently, Stats regaids the Canadian, the Britich

and the Spanish efforts as being the real trouble spots.

The President.

firecteó that State undertake talks, as appropriate, with the governmente

us firma concerned to disuade them from this practice.

b. Under questioning. Mi. FitzGerald stated that exploitation

of Cuban military disaffectlod in a long term undortaking. While there

aro disaffected Cuban military men in important pouts, they have not.

to date, made any contacts with each other nor formed any sort of group.

However, Mr. FitzGerald considers that any successful operation tu

overthrow Castro emanating from within Cuba will have to be supported

by the Cuban military if it is to have any real likelihood of succesa.

c. During the discussion on sabotage and harrassment, the

-rosicient expressed his reluctance to undertake high risk actiong at

this time for two reasons:

(1) Current attarapto to get OAS agreement to various

ations directed against Cuba might be jeopardized; and

(2) The soviets secm to be watching closely the new

administration's policies toward Cuba, and it might influence unfavorably

the sucuess of vur efforte to achieve further reductions in Soviet military

personnel in Cuba..

1. Mr. Helms briefed on the significance of the arms cache.

¿he OAS survey group now in Venezuela and the results, to dato, of

neir survey. He stated that the group apparently had accopted that

ite arris had been introduced for subversive purposos, but that the

survey group was asking of the Venezuclan government further informa-

tion regarding propaganda activities directed against the Vonezuelan

government; itc. He does not expect that the commission will report

MEMOR ANDUM FOR THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF, ATLANTIC

Subject: A Contingency Plan for a Coup in Cuba (S)

1. Transmitted herewith is a conceptual proposal, subject as above,

which has been developed jointly by the Department of State, the Depart

ment of Defense, and the Central Intelligence Agency.

2. This concept envisions a coup occurring in Cuba which may, if

supported by the United States, achieve US national objectives by the

elimination of the. communist regime and establishment of a. Cuban

government acceptable to the United States.

3. The proposal provides for US military intervention in a flexible

manner covering a spectrum ranging from provision of logistic support

to full execution of OPLANS 312, and:316. Conditions under which military

intervention at a level LESS than that of OPLAN 316 might be undertaken

are generally in consonance with those described in JCS Message 89,70:

.DTG: 0701552 March 1963.

4. It is desired that CINCLANT prepare a separate contingency plan

to support a coup in Cuba within the context of conditions. described in

the attachment hereto.

A CONTINGENCY PLAN. FOR A COUP IN CUBA

1. Problem. To provide planning guidance for US response to a coup in

Cuba In'order to assure that US intervention, 1f undertaken, results 1n

replacement of the Communist goverment with one acceptable to the United

States:

2. Assumptions.

a. The leaders of the coup may of may not be aware, from previous

contact with CIA, that 1f they agree to and appear capable of meeting

certain specified conditions (see paragraph 2.d, below), their revolt

will be supported by the US 1f a Us "special team" (see paragraph 3.b. (1)

below) confirms that the criteria for support have been adequately met.

Thus, the coup could be triggered in one of two ways: The leaders, in

secure radio contact with CIA, implement their plan with US concurrence

and establish a Provisional Goverrment In full expectation of forthcoming

Us support barring a complete and immediate crushing of the uprising; or,

less acceptably, the lcaders, in the belief that they can meet probable

criteria for US aupport, Initiate the coup without consulting with or

obtaining the concurrence of the US but establish & Provisional Govern-.

ment, hoping that the US will intervene.

b. If the US had prior knowledge of the coup, up to forty-eight

hours would be required after Initiation of the action to introduce into

Cuba and receive reports from a "special team" which would obtain in-

formation to assist in maling a decision to support the insurgents; 1f the

US did not have prior knowledge, a longer time would be required.

TOP SECRET ASTIVE-

c. US intervention would be based on:

URELASSIRED

(1) A pre-arranged call for help from a Provisional Government

set up by the insurrectionists (preferably to the OAS, although US action

would not await formal OAS approval), or

(2) A call for help from the incurrectionists after a coup had

started uithout prior US concurrence, if the US determined that the in-

surgents met generally the criteria for support, or

• (3)

Intervention by local Soviet farces.

d. A coup should meet the following criteria to be supportable,

recognizing that specific

criteria will depend upon the situation exist-

ent at the time:

(1). Have some pover base in the Cuban army of militia 1n order

to survive.

(2) Be prepared to establish a Provisional Goveriment, however

rudimentary, with some sort of public claim to political viability to

provide an adequate political basis for overt US action (not required 1f

Soviet troops were clearly fighting Cuban patriots).

(3) Neutralize the top echelon of Cuban leadership.

(4) Seize and hold a significant piece of territory, preferably

Including favana, long enough to permit the US plausibly to extend support

and some form of recognition to the Provisional Government.

e. Policy Considerations. For purposes of this paper, US policy al-

fecting US support to a revolt in Cuba is surmarized below.

(1) The US does not contemplate either a premeditated full scale.

invasion of Cuba (except in the case of Soviet intervention or the re-

introduction of offensive weapons) or the contrivance of a provocation

which could be used as

a pretext for such action.

UNGLASSIFID

• (2) By the same token, it 1s not US policy to encourage un-

organized and uncoordinated mass uprisings since these would be too

easily crushed by indigenous Cuban military forces. The likelthood of

any spontaneous uprising surviving long enough to receive adequate US

aid is small unless it is a part of, or followed immediately by, a

planned and coordinated revolt led by a significant element of the Cuban

military forces.

(3) Once a revolt begins, the involvement of Soviet forces,

either itactical formations or troops manning air defense installations,

would result in Immediate implementation of OPIANS 312 and 316.

3. Sequence: Of Operations. The concept of operations set forth in this

paper 18 based on the following general sequence of events:

a. Upon receipt of word that the dissident leaders have agreed to

and appear capable of meeting the criteria for US support, approval

would be given to commence the coup at the earliest practicable time.

(In theevent that a coup were initiated without prior Us knowledge,

the US tould proceed as described below but introduction of the special

team into Cuba would probably be delayed and its task of gathering in-

formation nade more difficult. Consequently, it might not be possible

for the US to make a decision to support the coup in time to commit

forces needed to sustain it.)

b. Upon receiving word that a coup had been initiated, either on

a pre-arranged la 81s with CIA or as a surprise to the US Government, the

US would:

(1) Introduce into Cuba a "special teem" is obtain information

which would assist in making a decision to support the insurgents.

This'

tear, composed of several persons

representing DOD, State, and CIA, would

meke contact with the coup leaders ulthin twenty-four hours of the start

of the coup if the US had prior knowledge

of the plan, probably later if

not. The report ofthe findings

should be received by CIA within twenty-

four hours after the team's arrival on the island but this might not be

possible without prior knowledge of the insurgents' plans. In any event,

American

reliable reports from trained observers in Cuba Hould be of great value

to making a decision to intervene in

order that the Us would not commit

its prestige to the support of an uprising which might collapse prior to

the point at which Us help has become effective enough to sustain and.

expand it. (The special team, augmented as appropriete by CINCLANT,

would remain in Cuba as a liaison element with the Provisional Govern-

ment if the US Intervened and would be directed to report immediately

to CINCLANT for operational control at the time the decision was made

to intervene.) .

(2) Order forces needed to establish an air and sea blockade

of Cuba to take assiened stations in preparation for Implementing the

blockade; commence generating and positioning forces required for the

implementation of CINCLANT OPIANS 312 and 316.

c. A recommendation to intervene, based on a multiple source in-

telligence assessment including the special team's report, would be

made to the President. This would be the critical. decision because,

once made, certain actions would ensue inmediately and, henceforth,

the US would be cormitted to the ultimate success of the coup.

These ac-

tlong would Include:

(1) The assumption by CINCIANT of conmand of all military

and para military operations in Cuba.

(2) Prompt introduction of small groups of personnel: for the

purposes of intelligence, reconnaissance, communications and liaison

with the Insurgents, and provision of unattributable logistic support

by airdrop or submarine. In the event that the US delayed public an-

nouncement of the decision to support the coup, this assistance would

be provided in such a manner as to minimize public knowledge of active

US involvement In Cuba.

(3) When authorized by the President, direct the special team

to have the coup leaders proclaim a Provisional Goverment, 11 one has

not already been established, and request US and OAS assistance in order

to provide justification for a blockade and consultation within the oAs.

As soon as the request for belp is received, the President would announce

publicly that the US will isolate Cuba by means of an air and sea blockade

to become effective at (time, date). The justification for this unilateral,

interim action would be based on Paragraph 3 of Resolution 2 of the Punta

del Esta meeting of Foreign Ministers until such time as the COAS/OC es-

tablished a collective basis for the blockade, as well as to insure that

support for either side is not provided from external sources. Actually,

the announcement would be designed to immobilize the Cuban Navy and Air

Force, encourage indigenous support for the insurgents, and reinforce a

warning to the Soviet Union not to intervene. (See Paragraph H.a. below).

(4) Complete positioning, of forces

for implementation of por-

tions or all of CINCLANT OPLANS 312 and 316.

d. The US uculd have the ontion of replying to a formal call for

help by either publicly announcing immediately its intention to support

the Provisional Goveriment and initiating overt military operations, or

responding by establishing a blockade without admitting other support

for the coup. In the latter case, the US would, between the time of the

Presidential announcement of the blockede and public announcement of the

other forms of support, employ small groups of intelligence and recon-

naissance units, thereby providing visible evidence to the insurgents

that support is forthcoming and yet providing a facade of non-uitervention

while the US consults with its allies to gain their political support.

At the same time, the US would be generating and positioning forces re-

quired for significant overt illitary operations: Upon publicly announc-

ing US intent

to support the Provisional Government, the US would initiate

overt logistical and air support to the insurgents. There 1s a possibility

that this level

of assistance and demonstrated US intent would be suffi-

cient to bring down the Castro restme, if the coup carted with it a

significant element of the Cuban armed forces.. However, It le probable

that the US would have to introduce conventional forces incrementally as

required to sustain the uprising and should be prepared to and would im-

plement portions or all of CINCIANI OPLANS 312 and 316, as required.

3.

This plan,

US military

Intervention.

Such a plan would enable a

logical build-up

of incidents to be combined with other

seemingly unrelated events to camouflage the ultimate

objective and create the necessary impression of Cuban

rashness and irresponsibility on a large scale, directed

at other countries as well as the United States.

The plan

would also properly integrate and time phase the courses

of action to be pursued.

The desired resultant from the

execution of this plan would be to place the United States

in the apparent position of suffering defensible grievances

from a rash and irresponsible government of Cuba ana to

develop an international image of a Cuban threat to peace

in the Western Hemisphere.

4. Time is an important factor in resolution of the

Cuban problem.

the plan should be so time-

PRETEXTS TO JUSTIFY US MILITARY INTERVENTION IN CUBA

(Note: The courses of astion which follow are a preliminary.

submission suitable only for planning purposes. They are

arranged neither chronologically nor in ascending order.

Together with similar Inputs from other agenoles, they are

Intended to provide a point of departure for the development

of a single, Integrated, time-phased plan. Such a plan would

permit the evaluation of Individual projeots within the context

of oumulative, correlated aotions designed to lead Inexorably

to the objective of adequate justifloation for US ullltary

Intervention in Cuba).

1. Since it would seem desirable to use legitimate

provocation as the basis for US military Intervention in Cuba

a cover and deception plan, to Inolude requisite preliminary

aotions such as has been developed. in response to Task 33 0,

could be executed as an 1n1t1al effort to provoke Cuban

reactions. Harassment plus deceptive aotions to convinoe the

Cubans of imminent invasion would be emphasized. Our milltary

posture throughout execution of the plan will allow a rapid

change from exercise to intervention 1f Cuban response justifles.

2. A series of well coordinated incidents will be planned

to take place in and around Guantanamo to give genuine

appearance of being done by hostile Cuban forces.

a. Incidents to establish a credible attack (not in

chronological order);

(1) Start rumors (many). Use clandestine radio.

(2) Land friendly Cubans in uniform "over-the-fence"

to stage attaok on base.

(3) Capture Cuban (friendly) saboteurs Inside the

base.

(4) Start riots near the base main gate (friendly

Cubans).

(5) Blow up ammunition Inside the base; start fires.

(6) Burn airoraft on air base (sabotage).

(7) Lob mortar shells from outside of base Into base.

Some damage to installations.

(8) Capture assault teams approaching from the sea

or vioinity of Guantanamo City.

(9) Capture militia group which storms the base.

(10) Sabotage ship In harbor; large fires -- napthalene.

(11) S1nk ship near harbor entrance. Conduot funerals

for nook-vlotims (may be lleu of (10)).

b. United States would respond by executing offensive

operations to secure water and power supples, destroying

artillery and mortar emplacements which threaten the base.

o. Commence large soale United States military operations.

3. A "Remember the Maine" Incident could be arranged in

several forms:

a. We could blow up a Us ship in Guantanamo Bay and

blame Cuba.

b. We could blow up a drone (umanned) vessel anywhere

In the Cuban waters. We could arrange to cause such Incident

in the violnlty of Havana or Santiago as a spectacular result

of cuban attack from the alr or sea, or both. The presence

of cuban planes or ships merely Investigating the Intent of

the

vessel could be fairly compelling evidence that the ship

was taken under attack. The nearness. to Havana or Santiago

would add credibility especially to those people that might

have heard the blast or have seen the fire. The US could

follon up with an aix/sea resoue operation covered by Us

fighters to "evacuate" remaining members of the non-existent

orew. Casualty lists In US newspapers would cause a helpful

wave of national indignation.

4. We could develop a Communist Cuban terror campaign in

the Miami area, In other Florida oities and even in Washington.

The terror campaign could be pointed at Cuban refugees seeking

haven In the United States. We could sink a boatload of Cubans

enroute to Florida (real or simulated). We could foster attempte

on lives of Cuban refugees In the United States even to the

extent of mounding In Instances to be widely publiolzed.

Exploding a few plastio bombs In carefully chosen spots, the

arrest of Cuban agents and the release of prepared documents

substantiating Cuban Involvement also would be helpful in

projacting the idea of an Irresponslble goverrment.

5. A "Cuban-based, Castro-supported" f1llbuster could be

simulated against a neighboring Caribbean nation (1n the vein

of the 14th of June InVaBion of the Dominican Republic). We

know that Castro 18 backing subversive efforts clandestinely

against Halt1, Dominican Republlo, Guatemala, and Nicaragua at

present and possible others. These efforts can be magnified and

additional ones contrived for exposure. For example, advantage

oan be taken of the sensitivity of the Dominican A1r Force to

Intrus10ns within their national alr space. "Cuban" B-26 ox

0-46 type airoraft could make cane-burning raids at night.

Soviet Bloo Inoendiarles could be found. This could be coupled

with "Cuban" messages to the Communist underground in the

Dominiian Repüblio and "Cuban" shipments of arms which would

be found, or Intercepted, on the beach.

6. Use of MIG type airoralt by US pilots ovuld provido

additional provocation. Harassment of o1v1l air, attaoks on

surface shipping and destruction of US military drone aircraft

by mit type planes would be useful as complementary aotions.

An F-86 properly painted would convince alr passengers that they

saw a Cuban MIC, especially 1f the pllot of the transport were

to announce such fact. The primary drawbaok to this suggestion

appears to be the security risk inherent in obtaining or modify-

Ing an aircraft. However, reasonable coples of the MIa could

be produced from US resources In about three months.

T. Hijacking attempts against o1vil air and surface oraft

should appear to continue as harassing measures condoned by the

government of cuba. Concurrently, genuine defections of Cuban

o1v11 and milltary alr and surface craft should be encouraged.

8. It is possible to create an Inoident which will demonstrate

convincingly that a Cuban atroraft has attaoked and shot down

a chartered o1v1l airliner enroute from the united states to

Jamaloa, Guatemala, Panama or Venezuela. The destination would

be chosen only to cause the flight plan

route to cross Cuba.

The passengers could be a group of college students off on a

holiday or any grouping of persons with a common Interest to

support chartering a non-soheduled flight.

a. An airoraft at Eglin AFB would be painted and

numbered as an exaot duplicate for a civil registered

airoraft belonging to a CIA proprietary organization in the

Miami area. At a designated time the duploate would be

substituted for the aotual olvll airoraft and would be

loaded with the selected passengers, all boarded under

carefully prepared allases. The actual registered

alroraft would be converted to a drone.

D. Take off times of the drone alporaft and the aotual

alroraft will be scheduled to allow a rendezvous south of

Florida. From the rendezvous point the passenger-carrying

aircraft will descend to minimum altitude and go direotly

Into an auxillary fleld at Eglin AFB where arrangements w111

have been made to evacuate the passengers and return the

alroraft to 1ts original status. The drone airoraft

meanwhile will contime to fly the filed flight plan. When

over cubs the drone will being transmitting on the Inter-

stations in the Western Hemisphere to tell the US what

has happened to the aircraft instead of the us trying to .

"sell" the inoident.

9. It Is possible to create an Inoident which will make 1t

appear that Communist Cuban

MIGs have destroyed a USAF alroraft

over International waters in an unprovoked attaok.

a. Approximately 4 or 5 F-101 atroraft will be dispatohed

1n tra1l from Homestead AFB, Florida, to the violnity of Cuba.

Their mission,will be to reverse course and simulate fakir

alroraft for an air defense exercise in southern Florida.

These airorart would conduct varlations of these flights at

frequent intervals. Crens would be briefed to remain at

least 12 miles off the Cuban coast; however, they would be

required to oarry live ammunition in the event that hostile

actions were taken by the Cuban MiGs.

• b. On one such flight, a pre-briefed pilot would fly

tall-end Charley at considerable Interval between atroraft.

While near the Cuban Island this pilot would broadoast that

he had been jumped by MIds and was going down. No other

calls would be made. The pilot would then fly direotly

west at extremely low altitude and land at a secure base, an

Eglin auxillary. The airoraft would be met by the proper

people, quiokly stored and given a new tall number. The

pilot who had performed the mission under an allas, would

resume his proper identity and return to his normal place

of business. The pllot and airoraft would then have

disappeared.

o. At precisely the same time that the aircraft was'

presumably shot down a submarine or small surface craft

would disburse F-101 parts, parachute, eto., at approximately

15 to 20 miles off the Cuban coast and depart. The pilots

returning to Homestead would have a true story as far as

they knew, Search ships and arcraft could be dispatched

and parts of atroraft found.

THE PROBLEM

1. As requested* by Chief of Operations, Cuba Project, the

Jo1nt Chiefs of Staff are to Indioate brief but preoise

description of pretextawhich they consider would provide

justifloation for US milltary Intervention In Cuba.

FACTS BEARING ON THE PROBLEM

2. It is recognized that any aotion which becomes pretext

for US milItary Intervention in Cuba will lead to a polltical

decision which then would lead to military aotion.

3. Cognizande has been taken of a suggested course of

action proposed** by the US Navy relating to generated

Instanoes In the Guantanamo area.

4. For additional facts see Enolosure B.

DISCUSSION

.5. The suggested coursegof action appended to Enolosure A

are based on the premise that US military Intervention will

result from a perlod of heightened US-Cuban tensions which

place the united States in the position of suffering justif-

lable grievances. World opinion, and the United. Nations

forum should be favorably affected by developing the inter-

national image of the Cuban goverrment as rash and Irresponsible,

and as an alarming and unprediotable threat to the peace of

the western Hemisphere.

6. While the foregoing premise can be utilized at the

present time 1t will continue to hold good only as long as

there can be reasonable certainty that US milltary Intervention

In Cuba would not directly Involve the Soviet Union. There 18

In Cuba in the pattern of US bases in Western Europe. Therefore,

since time appears to be an important factor in resolution of

the Cuba problen, all projects are suggested within the time

frame of the next few months.

CONCLUSION

7. The suggested courses of action appended to Enclosure A

satisfactorily respond to the statement of the problem. However,

these suggestions-should be forwarded as a preliminary subnission

While we generally concur with the paper prepared by the

Department of State, we do not belleve that the proposals contained

therein present a sufficiently wide spectrum of options of activities

to Impede and stop Castro/Communist subversion in Latin America.

Specifically, we recommend the following additional actions:

(1)

Measures to attrit Cuban resOurces:

(a) Purchase the defection of personnel,

aircraft, ships, boats and other valuable items.

(b) Conduct non-attributable actiong against

petroleum resources, upon which much of Cuba's economy depends.

These actions should extend all the way from direct destruction to

sabotage through chemical and bacterial contamination of carriers

and storage.

(c) By means of intelligence indications (aircraft

flights, agents, clear radio transmission, beach jumpers) cause Cuban

military forces to stand continually at high alert level and thus: to

consume supplies which could otherwise be dedicated to subversive

training.

(d) Consider introduction of counterfelt currency

in large quantities, to distort the Cuban financial posture, ánd to

undermine confidence.

2. Objectives of the Communists within

3. Communist methods of operation.

1. Facts on the decrease in living standards

within Cuba since the rise of Castro.

5. Facts on terror and repression in Cuba.

(b) Develop a Pro-American Anti-Communist Press

Many Latin American papers, even the anti-

communist ones, are infiltrated by communist agents and many of their

columnists, proof-readers and linotypers are bought with communist

money. Circulation of these papers is artificially inflated by low prices

and underwritten by communist funds. The United States must match

(c) Distribute Anti-Communist Literature

Booke and pamphlete, in large numbers,

exposing the reality of communiem should be printed in Spanish and

Portugnose and distributed through inexpensive commercial sale.

Greatly expanded trajing and orientation in the

Undted States for key segments of each Latin American country's

population, such as:

(a) Enlisted as well as officer military personnel

(b) Police personnel to be schooled in Panama

(c) Newspaper personnel to be schooled within

the United States.

(d) Nurses (male and female) to be trained in the

United States.

(e) Civillan technicians to be trained in United

Stater training schools.

The thrust of such an expanded training program,

taking place in the United States, is not just to enhance the slall and

IX.A.3.d.: Ceneral Pressures to Create a Contingency

In order to accomplish the overthrow or reorientation of the Cuban

regime without harming the United States Image and with minimm distortion

of bilaterel US-USSR relationships, there must be careful coordination and

phasing of our future actions and demeanor. There must be a plan capable

Of getting us from where we are now to where we want to go, by gradually

Increasing pressures until the objective 1s achieved. These pressures

should be desigoed to create opportunities and contingency situations

for further exploitation, along the way.

The optimm orchestration of such e Cuban program mist obviously be

developed as the future unfolde. But in order to provide overall guidance

within this Government, a plan tracing the mainstreams of effort 1s required.

This plan Is divided Into eight headings with a gradually increasing level

of effort described under each of these headings. The progress through

the various phases 1s visualized as taking place in a coordinated but not

necessarily symmetrical manner. In other words, we may be in the most

vigorous phase of propagands while not yet baving reached the final phase

with regard to subversion but nonetheless the decision to proceed to the

respective phase in either category would be coordinated as ipart of an

overall govermental orchestration.

A program scenario capable of producing a decisive change or

exploitable contingency over an 18-month period follows.

Us Posture - - Initlally the US image should be that of willingness

to do all that is necessary to keep Castro's military threat nil end his

subversive threat to the lestern Hemisphere at an acceptably low level.

It should be characterized as one during which the USG, baving beez.

extrenely reasonable despite Castro's Intransigence, 1s walting for signs

of more favorable change In Cuba.

• Inter the US Image should change to one in which the US 1s being .

"Zed" by the majority of the DAS Into OAS Initiated and sponsored

pressures against Cuba. These would consist of meisures less than those

certain to overthrow Castro but going beyond the earlier measures, 1n

the expectation that resulting internal pressures might eliminate Castro

or provide an occasion for decisive ection. Pressures would be applied

In such fashion as to represent both a carrot to the Cuban people to get

rid of Castro regime and a stick toward the present regime. Still later

the US stance should become publicly, "at last" to join the OAS majority

In seeking vigorous pressures on the Castro regime without yet Irrevocably

committing US prestige to decisive action.

FInally, If and when the orchestration and circumstances have

brought the US position to such a point that decisive action 1s possible,

be an Invasion by US forces and could be re-imposition of total blockade

or & disarming airstrike, dependent on the circumstances.

OAS Action - - The UBG will need to devote major attention to the

strengthening of the solidarity of the OAS as a source of regional

opposition to the Castro regime. These efforts should go forward openly

along several lines, quite apert from the covert effort to organize the

majority on specifle Issues. This effori to achieve solidarity should

consist of frequent brieflngs of the OAS nations through all appropriate

channels, Consultative Meetings of Foreign Ministers of the CAS, efforts

to set up an OAS milltary organization with occasional commitment of troops

for training, and all other feasible developments of regional themes, such

as Intensive efforts to build up the counterinsurgency capabilities of the

regdon.. It 1s very necessary, in view of the general LA situation to

continue all measures necessary to isolate Castro.

Initial DAS action should be the enlargement of the bases for the

Invocation of the ido Ireaty, This broadening should be against the con-

timed presence of Soviet troops (unless negotiations with the USSR indicete

that this aspect should be deferred) and/or against Castro's continued

subversive activity. Concondtantly, the recent study of the Special

Consultative Committee on Security should be given uide publicity and

the US should press for Implementation of its recommendations,

The OAS, In the near future, probably after publication of the results

of the foregoing study and energement of the basis for Involong the Rio

Treaty to include subversion, should again formally vara Gube against

promotion of any more subversive activities. The OAS should formally

..state that should Cuben subversive activities rise above some (unspecified)

level, & "new condition" would exist which voild justify decisive action

agatnet Cuba. All episodes of subversion or sabotage which could be

attributed to Castro should be highly publicized. The majority DAS support

should be organized to neutralize the Brazilian co-existence theme.

Bilateral approaches and econome quid pro quos should be used to win

Brazil to the U.S. view within nas.

St1ll later, at an appropriate time, the DAS should make an official

finding, from Its studies Initiated earller, that the Castro regime has

continued, despite warnings, to conduct aggressive and subversive ections

1n Latin America. A summary publication of subversive activities or

---

## Page 137

13-00000

Wiste Paper should be promulgated througa the DAS. Later a "new condition"

should be found fornally to exist, following which the US would state

that the earlier US-USSR modus vivendi regarding Cuba has come to an end.

Following the above, an OAS vote should call for the remaining. LA natiöns

to sever diplomatic relations with Cuba and for all members to restrict

their nationals from travel to Cuba. Castro should be officially labeled

as a major threat to the hendsphere and to the objective of the Alliance

for Progress.

The QAS might then declare that Castro's subversive activity constitutes

warlike activity and proclaim a prohibition against any varlike activity

being conducted by Cuba within an ocean and lend area around the entire IA

continental and Caribbean area. Intervention of aircraft and ships

carrying arus, subversive egents, propaganda materials, eto, could be

uthorized.

Is World Actinte

St111 later at an appropriate time the OAS should vote, under the

Rio Pact, to punish Castro's aggression. This action could take the

forn of a resolution for all members to take such action Including the

use of force as individually considered appropriate or to endorse any

specific decisive action to which the members had agreed.

The USG should brief its Allies on the views of the lAS and warn that

the sitiation may get worse, Inter, as & result of "OAS Insistence" the

Free Horla should be urged to extend or re-affira trade embargos to all

Items except food stuffs, medicines, and medical supplies; to apply shipping

restrictions; NATO should be persuaded to Include Cuba on the l1st of

countries to which shipment of COCOM List (strategde) items 18 prohibited;

crucial spare parts and equiyment which are not on the cocal list.

St1ll later the US should Increase the vigor with which she seeks,

through briefings, pressures, etc., to increase the effectiveness of all

economie measures and should seek to persuade all non-bloc nations to

Limit their airline services to Cuba and to withhold transit rights to

Soviet aircraft serving Cuba.

At an approprlate point in the orchestration,

food stuffs should be added to the prohibited trade list, with US using.

Its Influence to estend this embargo throughout the Free World. .

The ultimate extension of economic actions, would be the application

of a blockade to Cuba.. This could be a phased weapon consisting or a:

blockade on POL, with the prospect of total blockade to follow.

Survelllence over Cube -- Unt11 It becomes apparent that the Soviet

Union has no intention of removing any additional militery personnel,

Beral survelllance should be limited to appropolate biga altitude

coverage with low level survelllance avoided except for thoroughly

suspicious Indications.

Later, at a suiteble point 1n the orchestration, occasional low

altitude surveillance of "suspicious" areas should be undertaken in such

fashion as to be clearly visible to the Cuben people; while avolding

AA defenses:

$t11] later, sultably timed, the Unlted States/DAS should initiate

very frequent low altitude surveillance. This should be Increased in

Intenelty to the point at which our aircraft would literally seek out

AA defense sites In search of provocative nots or, in the absence of

Cuban reaction, to deflate Castro's image.

In any decisive action at the end of the road, surveillance should

be at saturation levels.

Regional Surveillance - The DAS or the Caribbean nations should take

the Initlative in organizing, as a part of a Carlbbean security arrange-

rent, a-surface ship and aeriel surveillance of the coastal and offshore

waters of the Caribbean nations. These patrols should be progressively

moved out from the shore's of the nations being protected into the Caribbean

Propaganda - There should be established Immediately a redio station

regularly scheduled Cuban broadcasts available to all Cuban political

groups. Its content should be the middle converse between van and

Of Alliance for Progress. Remind the Cuban people that Castro came to

power or-a pledge to provide political freedom. Remind them of the social

goals he held up while he destroyed that freedom. Contrast their present

economic chaos with those economic goals of land and housing reform..

Remind them that he preached nationalism while delivering their country

to the Soviet military occupation. Point out how each shift of goal was

accompanied by the destruction of earlier ones. Ask what Castro has left

to offer. Conclude that only the mitual fear of retribution among

his elite remilns to hold them in pover. Use slogans such as "I, 64""

Subversion - There should be an initial perlod of no Increase In

affair 1s completed and 1t 1s clear that the Soviet Union Wit remove

It should se emphasized to the rei.el leacess that the U.S. does not expect

the clock to be turned back with refard to social conditions.

Still later & complete orchestretion should be woven together,

coming to a crescendo through the optimal exploitation of all the min-

streatis discussed in the categories above. Propagenda should reach the

maximun denunciation of the regime, exhorting to revolt, holding up the

prospect of peace and a better life should the Cuban people join their

resistance leaders. Subversion should be stepped up by introduction of

all avallable externally trained sesistense fighters, provision of maximmm

logistic support, etc. At the sy "opiict: ime, 11 this resistance novement

needs the assistance of external jorces there should be an AS structured

alr strike, related to an appropriete Castro mis-step, to diserm Cuban:

offensive and defensive pover and to destroy all POL, storage. This attack

should be coordinated with all-out sabotege.

An Invasion force should be kept in readiness for use, 11 re-

quired to save the resistance, once the all-out internel resistance

efforts has been initiated.

Criteria -- The pressures discussed in all categories sbove should

. be appropriately coordinated. The period of moderation should end aîter

one or two months when it is apperent that no further Soviet nilitary

personnel are to be removed. Moderate pressures should then commence,

lasting for a perfod of two to three months, until some episode of

escalation by Castro or ober appropriate event, nakes further pressures

feasible. If such an event is not forthcoming, OlS major Insistence should

lead to escalation of pressures. After enother short period, again pre-

Perable triggered by an appropriate Castro episode or alternatively by e

majority OAS vote still more vigorous pressures should be initiated.

ERONI:

Coordinator of Cuba Affairs

SUBJECT: Psychological Program in Support of U.S. Poliey on Cuba

Obiectives

The basic program adopted by the Executive Committee on January

25, 1963 sets forth major objectives for our policy toward Cuba. It all

conmits us to "be prepared to increase the political, economic, psycho-

logical and military pressures, as appropriate opportunities present

thenselves. or can be created."

This memorandum outlines a program that will meet the psychologica:

requirements of our overall policy.

Role. of Psychological Operations

A successful psychological campaign cannot be viewed solely as a

propaganda exercise or an informational program. It should cover actios

and statements--all that is said or done solely or primarily for psycho:

logical effect.

This definition sets off psychological activities fron

those actions undertaken primarily for thelz direct value--whather in ti

fields of Intelligence, military, political, or economic action.

One of the tasks of psychological operations is to exploi. other

¿i-vities to maximum advantage, or to seek to minimize any ne ative as.

to balance possibly conflicting intarests and to determine which, in any

given circumstance, shall have priority.

Strategy and Tactics

wa must keep in mind constantly the relationship between what happens

in Cuba and the overall struggle between ourselves and the Communisto.

We should seek to insure that the Cuban situation will develop in a way

that will:

a) lead to the collapse or overthrow of the Castro regime;

b) demonstrate to the Cuban people and to the world at large that

communism 1a not a solution for the problems of a developing

country;

c) discredit Castro and his associates and their methods of opera-

tion throughout the Americas;

d) Insure that the burden imposed by Cuba on the Soviet Union and.

the satellites adds substantially to the mounting evidence that

efforts to export communist revolution are unsuccessful and ax-

cessively costly.

Our focus should always be on the first of these objectives--the

end of the commnist regime in Cuba. But pending achievement of inis,

wa can love toward the other objectives. And they, after all, are of

major importance to our overall strategic purposes.

gos sense.

ni:

## Page 167

13-00000

Wa have the possibility of insuring that so long as Cuba remains

Conmunist it will serve as an open, bleeding wound that will weaken the

Communist cause generally. This stratagic concept is one which the

Communists have triad to use against us.

Our tactical approach should be designed to fit this overall concept.

It calls for the utllization of every available weapon in our aresenal

and engagement, day-in and day-out, in a multi-faceted struggle at all

levels.

Our inttial aim should be to weaken steadily the capability, con-

fidence and will of the enemy (inside and outside Cuba) and, correspond-

ingly, to strengthen our side. We jeed not, indeed ought not, stake every-

thing on one great effort. Nor should we concentrate on simply building

up our forces and husbanding them "until the right time comes" for a final

showdown..

Instead, our effort should be directed toward achieving an inbroken

series of small successes, encompassing gains on the part of anti-Castro

elements and failures on the part of the regime Itself. Our aim should

be that the end of each day would see the position and prospects of the

Castro regime and little worse than they had been at sunrise.

A factory breakdown because of a shortage of spare parts or sabotage,

an increase in absenteeism, lengthened queues at the food stores, failure

to get a field planted--whether because of neglect or lack of seed,

crestion of suspicion in a minor but key official, the sudden appearance

of antiregime alogans on walls, a defection from the armed forcest-these

and sinilar things, whether major or minor, and over and over azain on

a mounting scale, will have a cumulative impact, In the long run, they

can be equivalent to a major victory.

The important thing is to keep-the pressure on, to never give the

regime a respite, to see that the series of small defeats and setbacks

1a unbroke and unendiage

Ouz purpose is to create a situation in which

the regime and its supporters steadily lose hope and heart, in which thes

coma to accept the certainty of eventual defeat.

Meanwalle, repercussions would be felt throughout the Communist

world. hasistance to the regina would increasingly be regarded as a

"cat hole" operation. The "example of Cuba" would become the reverse of

expactations; fidelismo would become a term of opprobrium.

In short, the goal is to bring about the elimination of the Castro

regime without resort to direct and massive force. We cannot rule out

the possibility that some reliance on force may become necessary to. insw

final victory for anti-Castro forces. But the greater and more effec-

tive is the effort herein outlined, the more we are likely to insure thai

over: force requirements will ve minimal.

Spacific programs to carry out this kind of approach to the

Cub an

probien are submitted in Annexes A and B.

facilences and Targets

• The psychological program should be directed at the following primary

audiences or target groups:

1) the Cuba people. Our goal should be to encourage dissatisfaction

with the present and hope for the future once Castroism is el1-

ainminated. It should be made clear that the next chapter of Cuba's

history must be written by the Cubans. But they should know that

they will have fxiendly aupport from others.

2) the Castro regime. Our goal should be to create dissension, doubi

and hopelessness inside the ruling clique.

3) Latin Americe. In programs directed at the peoples and govern-

ments of the henisphere, our goal should be to weaken the influ-

ence of the Cuban regims and its propaganda, to encourage solid-

arity within the OAS family, to counter Cuban Influence in key

groups (youth, labor, Intellectuals), to encourage actions that

counteract Cuban programs of subversion and Insurrection.

li) the Soviet Union and other. Conmunist stetes. To picture Cuba

as a steady drain on already limited resources, to insure that 1

Is such a drain, to encourage the Soviets to limit and eventuall

eliminate their involvement in Cuba.

## Page 170

13-00000

5) Other countries. To insure understanding of what is involved

in the Cuban situation, to use Cuba to disprove that communism

provides useful answers to the needs of developing countries,

to espose. the continuing danger of communist efforts to export

revolution.

6) the Home Base. To provide the American people and the Congrass

with the full facts of the Cuban situation within the limits of

legitimate security considerations.

issets

The psychological program toward Cuba should utilize the full range

of she Gsvernment's capabilities for action and infornation. These in-

cluda, anong others: a) public statements by the President and other

officials;

b) informational assets such as the public affairs ant

Congressional relations agencies of State,

Defense and other agencies;

c) the Covernment's research and analysia facilities;

d) overseas information programs in all media,

especially the facilities of the U.S. Information

Agency;

e) the diplonatic mechanism for both formal and

informal contacts;

E) capabilities for unattributed programs of action

and information.

Coordination and Guidance

I: carrying out the kind of many-sided offensive described herein,

it will

ba necessary to provide fox coordinating various programs. We

mist de sure that what wa do in one area reinforces what we do elsewhere.

It will be necessary to provide careful end regular policy guidance to

those responsible for action. This task 1s assignad to the Coordinator

for Cuban Affairs. He should establish the necessary nachinery on an

Inter-departmental basis.

U.S. Posture towerd Cube

The picture we should seek to create 1s one of a confident and de-

cisive United States noving forward in cooperation with Its other fttands,

dealing with the Cuban situation but not exclusively preoccupied with

Castro. We should not appear to be in doubt or confusion, We should take

note of developments in Cuba promptly and react to them quickly. Our

answer to claims, charges or attacks should be swift. Our machinery mist

be gearad' to permit answers to Castro and his herichmen lmediately and

effectively. If he makes a speecin tonight, our reply should be on the

alrwaves tomorrow at the latest.

Cur approach should not be defensive. We should not confine ourselve

to caswering Castro but as much as possible force him onto the defensive.

We could insure that he is required to do the answering, the explaining,

the disagreeing as much as possible.

Guidelines for Attributable Programs

Darrent Requirements

I. There should ja & statenent, preferably by the President, ex-

-lairing overall U.S. policy toward the Cuban question. It would provide

cisrification of where we stand on Cuba and how we hope to see the future

develop. It would provide the basis for statements, private and public,

for all other officials concerned. It would inform the Cubans how we re-

gard their future; tell Latin Americans how we see the problem and our

view of their role; underline' to the Soviet bloc our determination to

oppose communism in this hemisphere; further clarify for our own people

the seriousness of the problem and our determination to support the cause

of freedom in Cuba with all feasible means.

The Coordinator should arrange for preparation of such a statement

and submit a draft tö the White House.

2. It 1s our policy to seek elimination, or at least material re-

duction, of the Soviet military presence in Cuba. Efforts now underway

to achieve this end should be given a reasonable chance. If they fail

to produce the desired result within a reasonable time, we should be pre-

pared to nova forward along other lihes. The Coordinator should develop

§ progian to nest this contingency. Meanwhile, the continuing presence

of Soviet forces should be descrited as in exacerbating influence in

East-west relations and a symbol of foreiga domination and control in Cuba.

3. Clarification of our position on "non-invasion" would be desira-

sagard invasion of Cuba by the United States as a desirable or useful

couria. But the possibility of such action in given circumstances cannot

bu clininated. The doox should be left open for any action that we and

our allies in the hemisphere may regard as necessary in the future to

counter aggressive moves by the cuban regime.

4. We need to have clearly in mind our position regarding a possi-

bie Intarnal revolt. Ints, too, could be covered in 1 above. We should

evoid statements for the present which could reasonably be expected to

encourage in open revolt. We should avoid for the present anything that

could ba read as a fian pledge to come to the aid of anyone who moves

support and cooperate with any elements. who succeed in ending communist

dominance in Cuba and who are cormitted to establishing in Cuba a free

ard democratic government responsive to. the destres of its own people.

5. We should exploit by available means all evidence of internal

discontent and opposition. Defections from the Cuban regime should be

"exploited extensively and quickly as soon as security considerations are

b) U.S. capabilities in this field with a view to exposing any

obvious remediable gaps in our resources for conducting a sigal-

ficant psychological effort against Cuba;

c) Castro's propaganda machine--how does it work? how wich effort

goes into 1t? how can wa weaken it?

ã) major lines of the Cuban propaganda offensive--favorite themes,

UN or among the Cuban people.

Themes for Infornation Programs

Information nedia should exploit the following themes to the max-

in extent practicable. Hard data supporting these themes should be

spotted on a day-to-day basis and used. Connentaries and discussions

shouid be scilored to take full advantage of these attitudes.

event no pressing requirement exists, it is suggested that this

handled on a closely held basis.

REASON FOR PROPOSAL

Following ate listed a number of indications that the leader-

ship question will be addressed in the near future:

Revolutionary & l to nation of U.9 rest to the Cuban

exile groups in the U.S. and elsewhere will be vying for recogaition

and support in an attempt to fill this void.

b. There has been constant pressure on the U.S.

of this political and psychological pressure.

c. This proposal could serve to reduce the bickering

among exile groups and may serve to resolve some of the problems

of Cuban exile unification.

3. This proposal could permit the U.S. on a progres.

influence the platform of a future Cuban Government.

The publicity associated with the prolonged existence

of a resistance in Cuba can serve to delay the furtherance of the de

facto recognition of the present Cuban Regime.

OBJECTIVE

To create an imaginary leader of image of resistance in Cuba.

This image would serve as a focal point for resistance directed against

Castro by Cubans or Latin Americans.

of any such name which is acceptable and meaningful in Spanish

could suffice.. Over a period of several months the name could be

"dropped" or leaked through U.S. officialdom, in diplomatic channele,

in intelligence channels of within the Cuban exile community. Specific

acts against the Regime could be credited to this individual of mem-

bers of his group. Communications could be arranged between thie

individual and his subordinates to be picked up elther by Castro's

censors of by, radio intercept in Cuba or in the U.S.

fter a period of time, all unexplained incidents and action

or which credit has not been seized by some other exile group woul

automatically be ascribed to our imaginary friend. At some point ir

ime it could be leaked that the U.S. is, in fact, supporting thir

imaginary persos. Similarly, other Latin American countries may,

without inducement, publicly follow the U.S. pattern.

During the course of this operation it is quite possible that the

Castro Regime could indicate that the activities of this individual were

terminated, that the individual was captured, that he was being pur -

sued, or that he was an imaginary faker or fraud. Such action would

only serve to further publicize the actions of the individual and so long

as resistance in general continued the fame of our "Cuban Kilroy"

would spread. Humorous antica could be credited to our imaginary

friend and rumors of his exploite of bravery (ala Zoro) could be

circulated.

At some point in time it may be wise to indicate what this

individual stands for.

(It will become obvious that he is opposed to

the Regime in Cuba.) It could be possible to indicate little-by-little

his political platform in very general termas - realizing that the

mistique and the "generalness" connected with his operation is, in

fact, the power behind the operation. Ultimately, Cubans and othera

may demand that be proclaim his complete political views or even

that he present himself physically. Since this is not desirable,

through his disavowals.

While this scheme is replete with gimmickery, it imple-

mentation could be undertaken in a relatively short period of time.

Sensitivity of this scheme is such that the knowledge should be hel

on the tightest basis and if implemented, those proposing shoul

not be informed. In the event the scheme is compromised, (unless

knowledge is widespread) there is little need for plausible deniability;

however, once used and compromised the scheme can hardly be

reinstated. A major advantage in that this image can be created

over a long period of time or developed rapidly without a political

or economic commitment on the part of. the U.S. There may be a

point at which the U.S. could no longer disavow collaboration with

this imaginary person. This point, however, is so distant that

Juring any point in the intervening period it would be possible fo:

he U.S. to disengage easily without suffering embarrassment o

loss of prestige.

CONCLUSION

Based on a consideration of factors indicated above, it

appears that the U.S. should immediately undertake to implement

this proposal, determining at 30 to 60 day future intervals what

additional action should be taken to improve, reduce, or change

the image during the subsequent 30 or 60 day period.
