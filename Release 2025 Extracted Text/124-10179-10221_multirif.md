The Attorney General

NOTI:

The Attorney General, on 8/8/75, and the Deputy

Attorney General, met with Associate Director Nicholas P. Callahan,

Assistant Director W. Raymond Wannall, and Inspector John B. Hotis

to discuss the request of the Senate felect Committee for the identities

of sources utilized to effect Cointelpro activities. The Attorney General

indicated prior to discussing this problem, which relates to the over-

all contidentiality of FBI sources, with senator Church, Chairman of

the Committee, he desired to be furnished information which would

enable him to insure himself there were no Cointelpro activities of a

scandalous or infamous nature which at a later date could cause em-

barrassment to the Department. The attached memorandum was

prepared during the period 8/8-12/75 by personnel of the Internal

Security Branch of the Intelligence Division. It represents a careful

review of all Cointelpro actions where results were known. It is

pointed out in the majority of authorized Cointelpro actions results

were not recorded. Also, because of the wide variety of Cointelpro

actions, results in many areas are not subject to racasurement.

For

example, there is no way of determining how many individuals left the

Communist Party as a result of our documented mailings relating to

Soviet anti-semitism.

true. The Goverment had no other intormants to uncover.

asked fi the scheduled lecture for October 41, 1960, was a communist

meeting, Mr. Strong pointed out that a check of "Who's Who in America"

determined that Harvey O'Connor was listed as an author and to have

been connected with a number of "anti-organizations" and "civil rights

The speech appearance was cancelled by officers of

Wayne State Univeraity. The cancellation caused consternation

amongst the Communist Party (CP), which was sponsoring the meeting,

and Helen Winter, CP Headquarters, sought an injunctlot. Wayne Cir-

cuit Judge George E. Bowles granted the injunction and ordered Wayne

State University to permit the meeting. The meeting was held

October 21, 1960, at Wayne State University and about 100 persons

leaders to be of questionable character and living in luxury through the

large amount of meney taken as contributions from their membership. The

extreme nature of NOI teachings was underscored. As a result, NOI leaders

displayed concern and attempted to rebut the program at each opening meeting

of the NOI (per Bureau source).

• Brooks then went on to explain that the Foundation, which was attempting

to raise a large sum of money, could not risk unfavorable publicity as the.

How long have you been in

the Bureau?

Iwenty-four years as of

Where have you been assigned?

In Boston, Baltimore, New

York, Tampa, and San Diego.

The Bureau has indicated that

you were a coordinator of the

COINTELPRO in San Diego.

such, what were your duties?

The duties for the most part

consisted of preparing letters

to the Bureau asking for

authority to take some specific

action in the program; awaiting

the reply from the Bureau; and

then, if any action was taken,

to advise the Bureau of the

results of such action.

is noted that many of the re-

quests to take specific action

were turned down by the Bureau.

Were you the focal point of

the program?

Yes, in the sense that any

Idea for action to be taken

in the program was trans-

mitted to the Bureau for

approval by me and if approval

was received, it would be re-

lated to whomever had suggested

the activity.

I would then

report any results to the Bureau.

I do not see how it would

anyone could determine whether

I cannot recall whether or

not Wallace was removed while

I was coordinator of the program.

Was COINTELPRO successful?

I was not too impressed with

its success in San Diego while

I had it assigned to me be-

cause it was a new program

and it took some time to get

it established and working.

Most of the success was probably

due to information obtained

regarding criminal violations,

mostly local in nature, which

was furnished to local

enforcement officers, causing

the arrest of BPP members.

This would have been done

whether or not we had a

to prepare a letter to the

Were the BPP and US, Inc. both

Yes.

Do you think anything done in

Because of the extreme antagonism

between the two groups, anything

we did would have had about the

same effect as a gnat biting an

I do not think COINTELPRO

had that kind of impact.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

Formerly Known As

Black Panther Party for Self-Defense

The Black Panther Party (BPP), organized in December,

1966, at Oakland, California, by Huey P. Newton and Bobby

George Seale, has the publicly-stated purpose of organizing

black people

to take control of the life, politics and destiny

of the black community.

The Party, operating the Black Panther

Intercommunal News

Service, publishes a newspaper called

"The Black Panther," which

at one time openly advocated the

use of guns and guerrilla tactics in a revolutionary program

to end the oppression of the black people but since early

1971 has spoken for a survival program pending revolution.

BPP national headquarters, aka Black Panther Intercommunal

Headquarters, is located in Oakland, California.

While openly advocating direct overthrow of the

U. S. Government by force and violence until 1971, leaders

have since avoided extreme statements in favor of

calling

for action within the established order. Newton, in an

interview appearing in the May, 1973, issue of "Playboy"

magazine, stated the Panthers"

chiet

ambition is to change

the American Government by any means necessary but that

ultimately such change will be through armed violence.

Despite its claimed dedication to community service,

indicators

• Of the BPP's continued attraction to violence persist.

Since July, 1974, Newton and other BPP members have been

arrested in Oakland, California, for threatening police officers,

murder

of a 17-year-old female

and the pistol whipping of

Newton's tailor. Newton failed to appear on these charges

and is now a local fugitive.

Additionally, one died and

three were wounded as a result of a shooting at

a BPP-sponsored

dance in

Oakland, California, in October, 1974.

"US"

Also Known As

"US", Incorporated

"US" was chartered by the State of California as

at 8211 South Broadway,

American cultural organization.

During the spring of 1968, however, a source

advised that MAULANA RON KARENGA, true name RONIE MC KINLEY

EVERETT, Founder-Chairman of "US'

, published a booklet

entitled

"The Quotable Karenga", in which he talked of

revolution, black power, and condemned Christianity for the

plight of the black man.

In this booklet, KARENGA stated "

... You must have

a cultural revolution before the violent revolution.

The

cultural revolution gives identity, purpose, and direction.

... The revolution being fought now

is a revolution to win

the minds of our people. If we fail to win this, we cannot

wage the violent one. ... When the word

l is given, we'll

see how tough you are. When it's 'burn', let's see how much

you

blow up. And when it's 'take that white girl's head

too', we'll see how tough you are..."

The above source advised that "US" members are

required to study and memorize this booklet. "US" members

are also assigned Swahili names which they use in lieu

of their given names.

A second source advised that KARENGA had

spoken at various meetings in Los

Angeles at which time he

talked of creating an "US" army of 1,000 men, obtaining

weapons and ammunition, guerrilla warfare tactics, and

revolution. KARENGA also stated "The only way to

life is to take a life and as we get stronger, we will

take what we want from

the white man's United

States."

He also

stated that if the police killed any "Us" members,

the "US" organization would kill some of them. '

APPENDIX CONTINUED

The first source above advised that KARENGA

also stated that race riots throughout the country

were not riots but were actually revolts or revolutions

and that the black people were going to win their

freedom by violence, if necessary.

A third source advised that KARENGA stated

that a revolution would take place in the future and

that no one can believe in black revolution without

believing in armed conflict because the two go hand in hand.

A fourth source advised in August, 1974,

that the

US Organization has been

evicted from its headquarters at

4302 south crenshaw boulevara, Los Angeles, ana because

of lack of funds,

has been unable to locate a new meeting

place.

The organization has terminated all public meetings.

NATION OF ISLAM (NOI)

CHARACTERIZATION OF SUBVERSIVE ORGANIZATION

EXTREMIST MATTER

The Nation of Islam (NOI) is a black nationwife

organization headquartered at Muhammad's Temple #2: 7351

South Stony Island Avenue, Chicago, Illinois. Elijah

Muhammad, self-styled "Messenger of- Allah" and divinely

appointed leader of the black race in America, was leader

of the NOI until his death on February 25, 1975, at which

time his son, Wallace D. Muhammad, became Supreme Minister

of the NOI.

The NOI seeks a separate black nation, espouses

its own version of the Islamic Religion, and has considered

all "whites"

to be devils; however, Wallace D. Muhammad

in an interview published in "Muhammad Speaks"

, March 21, 1975,

same being a weekly and the official NOI newspaper, stated

there would no longer be stress put on the white people's

status as

"devils"; that whites have "begun to reform" and

"The past

is the past until it is dug up. We will not

dig it up." NOI official policy instructs members to obey

laws of the United States that do not conflict with NOI

laws; to defend NOI officials, property, women, and them-

selves at all costs, if attacked; and to disarm any

attacker and use the attacker's weapon against him.

The NOI body is broken down into: 1) the Fruit of

Islam (FOI), an all male military-type group, to which

which has as

its mmission security of officials, membership, and

property

of the NOI, and enforcing discipline in the NOI; and 2)

the Muslim Girls Training (MGT), an all female quasi

military-type group which has

as its mission homemaking and

child guidance in accordance with NOI teachings.

NOI activity is widespread among black inmates in

many prisons in the United States.

In recent years internal

dissidence and difficulties with

• rival. Muslim groups and

other adversaries have produced considerable violence, some

involving physical confrontations and acts of violence with

law enforcement agencies.

Wirick:

You understand that this is an informal interview

and is in connection with the Bureau's COINTELPR

as it relates to the FBI investigation of the BPP?

Yes, but for what purpose is the Senate conducting

this survey?

To aid in formation of new legislation so that the

FBI and other Government agencies will have more

definite guidelines to follow.

I believe the Congress already through lack of

information, Isolated instances and some hysteria

has enacted too many restrictive laws that prevent

the FBI and other Government agencies from protecting

the law abiding element of our society from the

"bad guys".

(He was in general agreement) Did you handle the

COINTELPRO from 1970 through March, 1971?

Yes, but I believe the BPP ceased to function Locally

about November or December, 1970. As I recall my

function was to write a progress type letter regarding

progress which described the illegal activities of

nembers of the BIP and to report that this incormatior

had been furnished local police agencies but informatio

generally emanated from confidential informants.

What type of illegal activities and did your program

in any way instigate illegal activities on the part

of the BPP?

Criminal acts committed by local members of the BPP

áre what I was

referring to. I don't believe it was

ever necessary to instigate.

any illegal acts or in

any way entrap BPP members in criminal acts. The

majority of local BPP members were thieves,

narcotics

addicts, lazy?

unemployed and were hero worshipers of

the BPP

in Oakland, Calitornla.

They wanted to emulate

the Oakland organization, but their own dishonesty,

et cetera, was a constant source of turmoll amongst

the local

group.

I recall, date unknown, information was received

regarding Kenny Denmon (Kenneth Lee Denmon), one time

head of the local BPP, that he was using stolen credit

cards.

Information was received that Walter Wallace

(Walter Carl Wallace, Jr.) was on narcotics and that

he and his wife, Velma, were

stealing to get money

for narcotics and that Velma's mother was also involved

in local thefts.

All above information was furnished local law agencies

and local arrests were made.

Furnishing the

above type of information is a function and responsibility

of the FBI.

criminal activities were not restricted to the examples

I've given.

Did the COINTELPRO try to disrupt the BPP Breakfast

Program?

No, not to my knowledge. I recall that soon after

the Breakfast Program was started that other members

of the BPP accused Ken Denmon of stealing money from

contributions made to the Program.

On second thought I believe we did disrupt the BPP

Breakfast Program in that we received complaints

from several dairys and bread companies, et cetera,

that they had been approached by BPP members with

veiled threats of extortion it they did not donate

quantities of food, et cetera, to the BPP Breakfast

Program.

The FBI and local police investigated and

I believe as a result their practices were discontinued,

but the investigation failed to establish a prosecutable

After thought, no. Because the paper itself was

so vile and anti-white that the odor would neve

top BPP members from reading same. I've alway

hoped that a large segment of the population.

especially the

"do-gooders" could or would experience

the nauseous reaction I have felt after reading the

illiterate, foul-mouthed,

anti-white, anti-Government,

BPP paper.

I think everybody should read a copy of

the BPP paper so that they will know the type and

character of BPP members.

What do you think about anonymous letters sent to

spouses of BPP members saying the husband was sleeping

with

a white girl, et cetera?

Most wives of the members I recall were also BPP

members and/or common-law-wives.

Many BPP members

did have liaison with white girls but I doubt if

such a letter would bother most spouses of Bit members.

such a letter might be of value under certair

we made certain requests to conduct some types

of counterintelligence against the BPP

do not recall that the Bureau ever authorized any

counterintelligence act which might be productive.

Change?

COINTELPRO is not being utilized to the

best of my knowledge and has not been for some time.

I believe that in about two or three years Congress

will be frantically asking the FBI why we did not

furnish them intelligence, advance knowledge of a

demonstration

a riot and other civil unrest and

elimination of the COINTELPRO has been another step

in the direction of placing the FBI and other law

enforcement agencies in a position where we cannot

react to the activities of groups

such as the BPP

which have been tormed with the main purpose

of overthrowing the United States.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

Formerly Known As

Black Panther Party for Self-Defense

The Black Panther Party (BPP), organized in December,

1966, at Oakland, California, by Huey P. Newton and Bobby

George Seale, has the publicly-stated purpose of organizing

black people

ото 217-5

to take control of the life, politics and destiny

of the black community.

The Party, operating the Black panther

Intercommunal News Service, publishes a newspaper called

"The Black Panther," which at one time openly advocated the

use of guns and guerrilla tactics in

' a revolutionary program

to end the oppression of the black people but since early

1971 has spoken for a survival program pending revolution.

Bi? national headquarters, ala black Panther intercommunal

Headquarters, is located in Oakland, California.

While openly advocating direct overthrow of the

U. S. Government by force and violence until 1971, leaders

have since avoided extrème statements in favor of

calling

for action within the established order. Newton, in an

ambition is to change

the American Government by any means necessary but that

ultimately such change will be through armed violence.

: Despite its claimed dedication to community service,

indicators of the BPp's continued attraction to violence persist.

Since July, 1974, Newton and other BPP members have been

arrested in Oakland, California, for threatening police officers,

murder of a 17-year-old female and the pistol whipping of

Newton's tailor. Newton failed to appear on these charges

and is now a local fugitive.

Additionally, one died and

three were wounded as a result of a shooting at a BPP-sponsored

dance in

Oakland, California, in October, 1974.

MI. Baker replied that this was not true but

that Special Agent Burns had been assigned the COINTELPRO

case because his case load was such that he was able to

handle the program.

1r. Seidel inquired whether Special Agent Roy

Burns was transferred to the Butte Office of the FBI for

disciplinary reasons.

r. Baker replied that Special Agent Burns wa

riginally from Washington State and had wanted to be trans

ferred to that area.

Mr. Seidel asked if the Bureau encouraged Agents

Mr. Seidel asked what Mr. Baker's definition of

the COINTELPRO was.

Mr. Baker replied that the COINTELPRO was a

disruptive type program.

Mr. Seidel stated that the FBI had apparently

written a letter regarding a white girl friend of Kenneth

Denman, a BPP leader in San Diego. He inquired as to why

this letter was written.

Mr. Baker stated that Denman was considered one

of the stronger leaders of the San Diego Branch of the BPP,

and if it was possible to keep him from becoming a strong

Leader, It would be disruptive to the party.

The fact that

Denman

was living with a white girl was considered derogatory

toward him by BPP members in San Diego.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether such activity.

would have been taken against a leader in an organization

such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC)

(see description) if the leader of such a group had been

living with a white woman.

Would such a letter be appropriate?

Mr. Baker replied that he did not feel that such a

letter would be appropriate in this case because this organi-

zation involved

a religious leader and our program was not

directed at religious groups but was directed toward black

nilitant and extremist groups.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether Mr. Baker recalled

individuals in the BPP named Tate, Wallace, Denman and Bell.

Seidel then mentioned an incident wherein the

San Diego Office of the FBl had furnished information to the

Los Angeles Office of the FBI for transmission to local auth-

orities concerning a group of BPP members from San Diego who

were traveling to Los Angeles to attend a funeral.

Mr. Baker stated that he could recall that such an

incident occurred and that information was furnished stating

that BPP members from San Diego would be carrying concealed

weapons. He said he thought the furnishing of this information

resulted in some of the BPP members being arrested in Los

Angeles.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether Mr. Baker could

recall someone from the FBI in San Diego visiting the mother

of a girl who was an alleged member of the BPP in San Diego,

and whether the FBI went to the mother to put pressure on

another member of the family.

Mr. Baker stated that he vaguely recalled such a

case but could not recall the details and could not be

certain this had occurred.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether the FBI had any

technical surveillances on the BPP in San Diego.

Mr. Baker stated that he knew of none and added that

Mr. Baker stated that he believes he would have known of any

such installations covering the BPP in San Diego.

Mr. Seidel asked if Mr. Baker knew of San Francisco

Mr. Seidel then stated that these cartoons were

Mr. Baker stated that he did not recall.

Mr. Baker advised Mr. Seidel that US, Incorporated,

nd the BPP were led by and made up of people with extensive

criminal records,

and because of this and their genera.

demeanor, the FBI did not really have to provoke or dis-

rupt them because they kept themselves in a constant state

of turmoil.

He stated that Special Agents connected with

the COINIELIRO did not devote much time to the program be-

cause of heavy case loads of other matters and because they

assisted in working criminal matters such as bank robberies

and other criminal violations.

Mr. Baker advised Mr. Seidel that a great deal of

time was spent by the Special Agents working with their

sources because they had to be extremely careful that they

were protected. If a crime was planned and a source

knowledge of it, the source would try to keep the crime from

being committed. If it was not possible to prevent the crime,

the source might be forced to participate, and if arrested, a

problem would becreated in attempting to get the source out

COMMUNIST PARTY, USA

Title 50, U. S. Code, Section 781 (Internal Security

Act of 1950) Stated that, as a result of evidence adduced

before various committees of the Senate and House of Representa

tives, Congress found the existence of a world communist

revolutionary movement, whose purpose is to establish a

communist totalitarian dictatorship in the world's countries

through the medium of a world-wide communist organization.

Communist action organizations in various countries endeavor

to carry out the objectives of the world communist movement

by bringing about the overthrow of existing governments by

any means.

The communist organization in the United States -

the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA) - pursuing its stated objectives,

presents

"a clear and present danger to the security of the

United States." The Subversive Activities Control Board,

established by Section 791 of the above Act, found the CPUSA

to be a communist action organization.

This finding was

upheld by the United States Supreme Court in June, 1961. The

CPUSA has continued to be an arm of the international communist

movement dominated by the Soviet Union.

The CPUSA, in its

dependence on the soviet union, has never knowingly adopted a

position contrary to Soviet policy.

Its

leaders frequently

confer with Soviet leaders to receive guidance and direction

on the policies the CPUSA is to follow. There has been no

evidence that the primary aims of the

NATION OF ISLAM (NOI)

CHARACTERIZATION OF SUBVERSIVE ORGANIZATION

EXTREMIST MATTER

The Nation of Islam (NOI) is a black nationwife

organization headquartered at Muhammad's Temple #2, 7351

South Stony Island Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.

Elijah

Munammad,

self-styled

"Messenger of Allah" and divinely

appointed leader of the black race in America, was

leader

of the NOI until his death on February 25, 1975, at which

time his son, Wallace D. Muhammad, became

Supreme Minister

of the NOI.

The NOI seeks a separate black nation, espouses

Its own version of the Islamic Religion, and has considered

all "whites" to be devils; however;

Wallace D. Muhammaa

in an interview published

in "Muhammad Speaks"

, March 21, 1975,

same being a weekly and the official NOI newspaper, stated.

there would no longer be stress put on the white people's

status as "devils";

that whites have "begun to reform" and

"The past is the past until it is dug up.

We will not

dig it up."

NOI official policy instructs members to obey

laws of the United States that do not conflict with NOI

laws; to defend NOI officials, property, women, ana them-

selves at all costs, if attacked; and to disarm any

attacker and use the attacker's

weapon against him.

The NOI body is broken down Into: 1) the Fruit of

Islam (FOI), an all male military-type group, to which

instruction in judo and karate is given, and

which has as

its mmission security of officials, membership, and property

of the NOI, and enforcing discipline in the NOI; and 2)

the Muslim

• Girls Training (MGT), an all female quasi

military-type group which has as its mission homemaking and

child guidance in accordance with NOI teachings.

NOI activity is widespread among black inmates in

many prisons in the United States.

In recent years internal

dissidence and difficulties with rival Muslim groups and

other adversaries have produced considerable violence, some

involving physical confrontations and acts of violence with

law enforcement agencies.

SOCIALIST WORKERS PARTY

The Socialist Workers Party (SWP) is a revolutionary,

Trotskyist-communist organization, which is headquartered in

New York City. Its purpose, as stated in its Declaration of

Principles, is the overthrow of

the U. S. Government and the

institution of a dictatorship of the working class and the

eventual achievement of a

communist society.

It was founded

in 1938

and maintains close association with international

Trotskyist organizations as a "sympathizing" group, but it

denies formal menbership in any foreign group to escape

application of the Voorhis Act, which regulates certain

types of organizations subject

to foreign control. While

the SWP does

not openly advocate the use of violence at the

present time

to overthrow the U.s. Government, it believes

that eventual violent revolution in the u. S. is inevitable.

Its objection to the cursent use of violence is based on the

ground that it believes violence is premature at this time.

The siP seeks

to precipitate a revolution when conditions

are ripe and to seize control of the revolution and to direct

it when it occurs.

Re:

Samuel. Adason Jaffe

105-28333

advised that Jaffe was

recruitea by the susan apout 19ce while he was in loscow,

through his relationship with a Soviet fenale. Soviet de-

fector

"Shamrock" has confirmed that Jaffe was approached but

does not believe the approach was successiut. catie reported

to the New

York Office

in 1963 what he interpreted as

a recruit-

ment eifort, and he was extensively reinterviewed in 1969

concerning his association with KGB officers in Moscow. There

is no information in

Jaffe's file that he was ever reported on

by Col. Penkovskiy,

as Jaife reportedly has claimed.

the interviews with Jaffe, he denied any overt acts heluring

to the KGB, although he admitted a continuing relationship vith

several KGB officers.

Both the New York and Washingion Field

Offices came to the

conclusion that Jaffe was a KGB agent while

in loscow,

but that there was doubt as to whether he continued

in that role aiter he was expelled.

Our relations with Jalfe were tempered by sany ally

allegation, and Bureau Agents in contact with him were circum

spect in

any dealings with him thereafter.

Jaffe very likely

detected a change in the Agents' attitude which accounts for

his statement that he felt his relationship with them

had

cooled off.

There is no evidence contained in Jaffe's file that

either New Yoris or Washington Field or the Bureau has ever taken

an1y

action which vould affect Jaffe's livelihood. Folloving

his return from Hong Kong, Jaffe told his handling Agents that

he was experiencing difficulty in finding a job. He several

times mentioned his concern

that ris association with the FBI

mighe be the reason.

On each occasion, he vas assurcd that

FBI had never divulged his confidential relationship and

would not do so any time in the fucure.u

Jaife's file does disclose that during an interview

with Washington riold Agents in 1969, he said that he had

learned Ircm a British Ininliigence contact in long Kong that

his

cecall from that city was caused by his refusal to coop

loraie with CIA. He also relited that he later montioned this

7776-1978

NW 88608 Docld: 32989640 Page 242

• On August 1915, Assistant Director Robert E.

Gebhardt, Los Angeles Division, was interviewed in the Los

Angeles FBI Office by Mr. Lester Seidel, Staff Member of

the Senate Select Committee, United States Senate.

Gebhardt's rights were not explained to him by

Seidel although Seidel did explain the purpose of

the

the Cointel Program of the FBI as it

s investigation of the Black Panther Party

when Gebhardt was the Special Agent in Charge of the San

Francisco Division from 1970 to 1972.

The interview lasted from 9:05 AM until 10:30 AM,

and it was not necessary for Gebhardt to consult with any

Bureau representative.

Gebhardt had previously been advised by a Bureau

representative of his right to counsel, the privileged areas

of information, consultation privileges, and the parameters

of interview.

Seidel inquired at the outset as to whether Gebhardt

was aware of the Cointel Program relative to the Black Panther

Party investigation on a day to day basis being specifically

advised details of the investigation as it relates to the

Cointel Program.

It was explained to Seidel that as Special

Agent in Charge of the San Francisco FBI Office wherein

over 500 employees were located at the time, Gebhardt had

many responsibilities in the operation of that division and

therefore, relied upon the experience, expertise, and judgment

of the various supervisors assigned to the office for the

day to day direction of the various matters under investigation,

including the investigation of the Black Panther Party.

It was further explained that if a problem was

encountered or a particularly unusual situation developed,

Gebhardt was, of course, consulted and was available for

such consultation to resolve

any particular problem areas.

Gebhardt was next asked if he recalled being SAC

when the electronic coverage of the Black Panther Party and

the various officials at BBP was instituted and eventually

terminated.

Seidel was advised that the electronic coverage

was

does recall receiving a phone call after the

already in effect upon Gebhardt's arrival, Keive Decision"

was handed down instructing that all electronic coverage of

the BPP and the various members of the BPP be discontinued.

The call was received from Bureau Headquarters and the

discontinuance was effected immediately.

Seidel Inquired as to whether Gebhardt felt the

intelligence type investigations should be completely removed

from

the criminal investigations which investigations would be

looking toward eventual prosecution.

Seidel was informed by Gebhardt that even in criminal

investigations looking toward prosecutions, much intelligence

information is obtained from time to time which really has no

value from a prosecutive standpoint, but does have possible

value with respect to the direction of the investigation.

some criminal investigations a great deal of intelligence

information may be obtained and in other types, very little.

Insofar as the FBI is concerned, however, every effort is

made to make certain there is some Federal law which would be

a basis for an investigation which procedures would include

matters commonly referred to as security investigations.

In some instances, in such security investigations

a great deal of intelligence information would be obtained

therefore, it was Gebhardt's opinion that so-called intelli-

gence type investigations should not be removed from or

differentiated from criminal type investigations looking

toward prosecutions since intelligence information is an

outgrowth of the basic investigation.

Gebhardt was asked if he. felt the Cointelpro was a

separate entity distinguished from the basic investigation

and it was explained that the Cointelpro was a phase of the

overall investigation in any particular organization or

individual.

Gebhardt was asked if he felt Congress should enact

legislation which would set forth specitic investigative

cechniques that could or could not be utilized by the FBI or

other Federal investigative agencies. He was advised in

Gebhardt's opinion, such legislation

should not be enacted,

and in reply to the question as to why such legislation should

not be enacted, it was pointed out that as an investigative

agency, there must of necessity be allowed

bility

because no two

investigations are exactly alike and

circumstances of such investigations could possibly not be

a certain flexi-

related to such Federal law.

In answer to the question as to how Congress should

assure the American public that questionable activity such

as the Cointelpro, was not being engaged in by an investigative

agency such as the FBI, Seidel was informed that the Congress

and the American people must rely upon the integrity and

honesty of the Director of the FBI and the Attorney General.

It was pointed out that both the Director of the

FBI and 'the Attorney General are nominated by the President,

hearings are held before the various Congressional Committees

and finally approved by the Senate.

It was further pointed

out that Director Kelley has recently stated in connection with

the publicity relative to Cointelpro, that he has no intention

of permitting this program to be reinstituted in the FBI and

if circumstances ever arose which circumstances he could not

contentiate not die time, when to to outta the personal

approval of the Attorney General prior to such instituting.

Seidel was informed that Gebhardt was in total agreement with

this statement of Mr. Kelley.

Gebhardt was asked as to what his feelings were

relative to what the relationship should be between the FBI

and Congress.

He was informed that a Senate Oversight

Committee was recently established and it was felt that this

was a good start and that this Committee should formalize and

NW 88608 Docld:32989640 Page 244

## Page 245

standardize their oversight responsibilities and make regular

inquiries of the Director and other officials of the FBI as

to our activities.

He was informed that there should be

either a joint oversight committee between the House and

Senate or if the Congress decided on two oversight Committees

in both the House and Senate, these committees should be the

entities through which all information relative to the

activities of the FBI should flow.

It was emphasized however, that there should be

regular consultation between these representatives and the

FBI.

Inquiry was made as to Gebhardt's opinion relative

to the relationship between the Department of Justice and

the FBI and Seidel was informed the relationship, in Gebhardt's

FBI and the Department

of Justice.

of the

FBI with due regard to the confidentiality of many

of the FBI operations and investigations and must assure

itself that the members of the Committee and its staff will

maintain the confidentiality where necessary.

Secondly, in the areas of investigative matters

usually referred

to as national defense, national security

or intelligence operations, all of the FBI investigations

must be based on the application of the facts toward a

particular Federal statute and if the facts are so oblique

that they cannot be clearly applied to a particular Federal

statute, consultation with the Department of Justice shoul

be had in all instances.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SPECIAL AGENT

ROBERT S. BAKER BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

Staff Member Seidel identified himself to Mr.

Baker, stating that the interview would be in the form of

an informal discussion and that information furnished by

Mr. Baker would be placed in a memorandum for the SSC.

Seidel stated that he did not intend to use the names

of individuals interviewed in his memorandum.

He stated

that Mr. Baker did not have to talk to him, and that any

information he furnished would be furnished voluntarily.

Mr. Seidel asked if Mr. Baker was a supervisor

with the San Diego Office of the FBI from sometime in 1968

through April, 1971.

Mr. Baker advised that he was a supervisor of the

security squad but could not. recall if the dates mentioned

by Mr. Seidel were correct.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to the nature of matters

supervised by him,

to which Mr. Baker replied that matters

such as investigation of the Communist Party (see appendix),

the Socialist Workers Party (see appendix), the Black Panther

Party, Us, Incorporated (see appendix), the Nation of Islam

(see appendix), Espionage, Sabotage matters, and other investi-

gations were conducted on the squad supervised by him, which

consisted of from 12 to 15 Special Agents.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether Mr. Baker

supervised the COINTELPRO.

MI. Baker advised that he did supervise this pro-

gram which was initiated by FBI Headquarters and not on the

field office level. He stated that as he recalled, a letter

was submitted either monthly, quarterly or semi-annually.

The letter was submitted by a Special Agent whose case loac

was such that he could take the time to prepare the letter.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether Special Agent

Roy Burns was more of a young,

eager, type Agent.

case because his case load was such that he was able to

handle the program.

Mr. Seidel inquired whether Special Agent Roy

Burns was transferred to the Butte 'Office of the FBI for

disciplinary reasons.

Mr. Baker replied that Special Agent Burns was

originally from Washington State and. had wanted to be trans-

ferred to that area.

Mr. Seidel asked if the Bureau encouraged Agents

so participate in disruptive, programs and then rewarded them

financially for their efforts.

Mr. Baker replied that the Bureau had an incentive

award program, and if an Agent did a good job in any field, he

could get recognition through an incentive award. • Mr. Baker

stated that he could not recall any award being given as a

result of COINTELPRO activity.

Mr. Seidel asked Mr. Baker if he could recall any

information concerning the Free Breakfast Program of the BPP.

Mr. Baker stated that he recalled that the operation

of the Free Breakfast Program of the BPP was followed through

sources.

They advised that some of the BPP officials were

stealing money from funds which were to be spent on the

breakfast program.

The breakfast program was served at a

local Catholic church.

Mr. Baker advised Mr. Seidel that

an official of the Catholic church in San Diego was contacted

regarding the priest in charge of the church where the break-

fast program was being held, who was reportedly an alcoholic.

Mr. Seidel was advised that the priest was transferred from

the church.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SPECIAL AGENT

ROBERT S. BAKER BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

Mr. Seidel asked what Mr. Baker's definition of

the COINTELPRO was.

Mr. Baker replied that the COINTELPRO was a

disruptive type program.

Mr. Seidel stated that the FBI had apparently

written a letter regarding a white girl friend of Kenneth

Denman, a BPP leader in San Diego. He inquired as to why.

this letter was written.

Mr. Baker stated that Denman was considered one

of the stronger leaders of the San Diego Branch of the BPP,

• and if it was possible to keep him from becoming a strong

leader, it would be disruptive to the party.

The fact that

Denman

was living with a white girl was considered derogalory

coward him by BPP members in San Diego.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether such activity.

would have been taken against a leader in an organization

such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC)

(see description) if the leader of such a group had been

living with a white woman. Would such a letter be appropriate?

Lotter rould so

Mr. Baker replied that he did not feel that such a

be appropriate in this case because this organi-

religious leader and our program was not

directed at religious groups but was directed toward black

militant and extremist groups.

Mr. Seidel Inquired as to whether Mr. Baker recalled

individuals in the BPP named Tate, Wallace, Denman and Bell.

Mr. Baker stated that he could not recall anything

specific about any of these individuals, except what he had

previously stated concerning Denman. He said he could recall

the names but nothing more concerning these individuals.

Mr. Seidel then stated that these cartoons were

Mr. Baker stated that he did not recall.

Mr. Baker advised Mr. Seidel that US, Incorporated,

and the BPP were led by and made up of people with extensive

criminal records, and because of this and their general

demeanor, the FBI did not really have to provoke or dis-

rupt them because they kept themselves in a constant state

of turmoil.

He stated that Special Agents connected with

the COINTELPRO did not devote much time to the program be-

cause of heavy case loads.of. other mattersand because-they...--

assisted in working criminal matters such as bank robberies.-

and other criminal violations.

Mr. Baker advised Mr. Seidel that a great. deal of

sources because they had to be extremely careful that they

being committed. If it was not possible to prevent the crime,

the source might be forced to participate, and if arrested, a

problem would becreated in attempting to get the source out

SA Lawrence F. Wirick at the San Diego Office of the FBI.

No Advice of Rights was furnished SA Wirick and it was not

included the following discussion in the form of questions and

answers:

Seidel:

Wirick:

Seidel:

Wirick:

You understand that this is an informal interview

and is in connection with the Bureau's COINTELPRO

as it relates to the FBI investigation of the BPP?

Yes, but for what purpose is the Senate conducting

this survey?

To aid in formation of now legislation so that the

FBI and other Government agencies will have more

definite guidelines to follow.

I believe the Congress

already through lack of

Information, Isolated instances and some hysteria

have enacted too many restrictive laws that prevent

the FBI and other Government agencies from protecting

the law abiding element of our society from the

"bad guys".

Seidel:

Wirick:

(He was in general agreement) Did you handle the

COINTELPRO from 1970 through March, 1971?

Yes, but I believe the BPP ceased to function locally

about November or December, 1910. As I recall my

function was to write a progress type letter regarding

progress which described the illegal activities of

members of the BPP and to report that this intormation

had been furnished local police agencies but intormation

generally emanated from confidential informants.

What type of illegal activities and did your program

Criminal acts committed by local members of the BPP

is what I was referring to. I don't believe it was

ever necessary to instigate

any illegal acts or in

any way entrap BPP members in criminal acts. The

majority of local BPP members were thieves,

regarding Kenny Denmon (Kenneth Lee Denmon), one time

head of the local BPP, that he was using stolen credit

cards.

Information was received that Walter Nallace

(Walter Carl Wallace, Jr.) was on narcotics and that

he and his wife, Velma, were stealing to get money

for narcotics and that Velma's mother was also involved

in local thefts.

All above information was furnished local law agencies

made.

The BPP in San Diego was very effective in causing

I've given.

Did the COINTELPRO try to disrupt the BPP Breakfast

Program?

No, not to my knowledge. I recall that soon after .

the Breakfast Program was started that other members

of the BPP accused Ken Denmon of stealing money from

contributions made to the Program.

Was COINTELPRO successful?

I was not too impressed with

its success in San Diego while

I had it assigned to me be-

cause it was a new program

and it took some time to get

it established and working.

Most of the success was probably

due to information obtained

regarding criminal violations,

mostly local in nature, which

was furnished to local

enforcement officers, causing

the arrest of BPP members.

This would have been done

whether or not we had a

I am referring to Page 91 of a

BPP COINTELPRO summary which

indicates that a BPP leader was

living with a white girl and an

anonymous letter was written to

others in the BPP saying that this

individual was living with a white

Mr. Seidel:

SA Petersen:

Diego was teaching children to

hate and kill police officers.

They planned violent criminal

acts and were making plans to

take over the established govern•

ment at the first opportunity.

It a leader of such a group could

be discredited and removed, it

would help to keep the group from

becoming stronger, as they would

have to select a new leader, and

he would have to get the group

reorganized. Denmon had many

additional weaknesses which could

be used in a counter-intelligence

program.

Do you recall a letter being sent

to BPP Headquarters saying a

leader of the BPP was cooperating

with the police in Los Angeles?

I do not recall such a letter.

Do you recall some cards being

sent to San Diego from Los Angeles

saying, "Ron Karenga is impotent"?

No, I do not recall such cards.

Ron Karenga was a leader of US,

Do you recall that cartoons were

credit the leaders?

recall whether they were set to

Attn: K. William O'Connor

SUBJECT: PROPOSED PROCEDURES FOR ACCESS

TO DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TILES

DATE:..

.."

July 18, 1975

in response to your memorandum dated July 18, 1975,

captioned as above, we observe that the "substantial negotiations"

which produced the proposed procedures did not include participation

by a representative of the FBi and that the request for our views

concerning disclosure of highly sensitive FBI material was first

réceived at 11:14 a.m. today with a reply expected by 2:00 p.m.

today. We respectfully suggest that not only should you afford greater

opportunity for an expression of our views on this matter, but that

any such proposed procedures should be presented to the President's

Counsel for concurrence and for an expression of the Presidenc's views

as to the general policy of the Executive Branch in this regard. Further,

you may want to consider addressing the problem of the impact such

general disclosure of files would have on pending criminal investigations.

A preliminary review in the time available revealed that

certain items require considerable modification. For example, Item (3)(c)

should be reconsidered with the following language:

1II

"An exception to (a) and (b) above is made for information

that would tend to identify sources to whom the FBi has

an obligation of confidentiality as to which no access

will be furnished unless the identity already has been made

known to the Committee, or unless the Attorney General,

the Chairman and the Vice Chairman jointly agree on the

limited disclosure of such identity to the Chairman and the

Vice Chairman. "

Item (6)(b) should be reconsidered with the following language:

"If the Task Force Leader has any objections to the

excisions or paraphrases, the FBi will furnish a

written statement of the grounds for its position to

the Special Counsel who shall resolve the matter by

negotiation within 24 hours."

Item (8) should be reconsidered with the following language:

"The Staff and the Members of the Committee may examine

the original materials to which the Staff is given access

as extensively as necessary between the hours of 8:00 a.m.

and 5:30 p.m,, Monday through Friday, in the r'BI J. Edgar

Hoover Building at Room 4171. "

In light of the difficulties described, it is my strong

recommencation that such procedures shoula not be hastily agreed upon

with the Committee and that full discussion should be had concerning this

matter by representatives of the FBI, the Atiorney General, the Committee

and the Counsel to the President.

COMMENTS ON PROPOSED PROCEDURES

I. 48 hour lead time is very short and may create problens; 24 hour

reaction time may be unreasonable for Attorney General.

2. The provision seems a little odd, out of context of negotiations.

3. Suggest that in 3(a), last line, word and should be or and

"peculiarly sensitive" read to modify both foreign intelligence

sources and ongoing operations.

4. No comment

5. No comment

6. Time frames are very restrictive; there should be a stated

opportunity for THL to nock out any objections with FBI, before

raising to Special lounsed."

...It. the issue is not promptly

resolved between the TFL and the FBI, the materials in issue

will be conveyed..."

BITE

Washington, D.C. 20530

Dear Mr. O'Connor:

I have received your letter of July 15 regarding

access/delivery of documents requested in the Committee's

letter of July 9, 1975.

The following relates specifically

to the procedure

suggested for handling documents on the

so called "Kissinger 17"

surveillance, which is also applied

in your letter to materials relating to electronic sur-

veillance of the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic

City in August 1964, materials relating to the electronic

King, and

jussibly the ôà fiies.

I regard this suggested procedure as a major step

forwara

and a recognition that

previous arrangements were

too cumbersome and time-consuming.

Nevertheless, there

are certain practical problems with the procedure which may

be resolved by interpretation. For example, I assume that

application of the procedure to the Atlantic City conven-

ко из a0

tion matters does not foreclose the Committee from receiving

for use at its offices actual documents or portions of

10 get a document at

documents, as well as summaries.

I understand that the

FBI has no objection to providing such documents on this

matter to the Committee for use at its offices.

Therefore, in order that the procedure you suggest

may be applicable

to all areas of Committee inquiry claimed

by the Department to involve particularly sensitive matters,

it should be interpreted

as follows: the Committee staff

will have direct access to all files and materials at FBIHQ:

the Committee start shall select certain documents from the

files which it deems pertinent to the Committee's inquiry

and necessary for the examination of witnesses or the es~

tablishment of certain facts during the course of the

inquiry; the FBI shall at that time designate specific

portions of such documents which might jeopardize par-

ticularly sensitive sources or methods; with respect

to such specifically designated portions of documents,

the Committee staff will prepare appropriate excisions

or summaries of the information; the summaries will be

checked at that time with senior Bureau executives to

ensure the protection of particularly sensitive FBI

sources or methods; thereafter, the excised documents

and summaries will be removed to the Committee's offices;

the Committee staff may check back to the original documents

as extensively as necessary; staft notes on the designated

specific portions of documents will not be removed from

FBIHQ; and Committee members may, of course, at any time

see the documents which the staff has seen.

I believe this interpretation can serve as a work-

able framework for Committee access to particularly sensitive

FBI materials. You may be assured that the Task Force shares

your concern for the need to provide sharial handling tech-

niques to convey or secure any particularly sensitive

information or materials, as indicated in the Outline for

Inquiry Procedures.

we nope this interpretation wili

facilitate the mutual effort by the Committee and the

Department of Justice to accomplish this purpose.

I would appreciate receiving your immediate advice

to me as to whether any further interpretation of this

matter is required. Any public discussion of these arrange-

ments and interpretations should be cast in such terms as

will not jeopardize particularly sensitive FBI sources.

you and specific appropriately cleared staff in Room 4171 of the

Hoover Building. These documents may be reviewed and studied there,

and you and such staff may take such notes as you deem appropriate;

we have agreed that the notes are to be left in the secure room of

the Hoover Building during your study, When your study is completed,

you may prepare a summary of the information which you consider to be

appropriate for Committee use.

The summary must be checked with

senior Bureau executives to ensure the protection of national security

matters, protection of confidential sources of infornation, and

observation of privacy considerations.

Thereafter, the approved

surmary may be removed to the Committee's office and all the staff

notes will be destroyed. You may check the summary back to the

original documents as extensively as necessary, in Room 4171.

that the word "implerentation" in line 2 of paragraph E(1), does not

We will furnish to you, for your study at Senate Select.

underlying any particular surmary in A-E will be extracted from the

This statement formally confirms

my previous discussions with you of this fact when we met with

Mr. Schwarz and Mr. Smothers on July 2. Be advised that the docu-

ments which have been transmitted to the White House for clearance

will be forwarded to you, or made available for access, if appropmate,

upon our receipt of the White House directions.

After you have reviewed that analysis, I will discuss with you

an appropriate further step with regard to the 0 & C files if such is

indicated; such an agreement would be generally sinilar in terms to

concerning disclosure of highly sensitive F'Ell material was first

received at 11:14 a.m. totay with a reply expected by 8:00 p.m.

today. We respectfully suggest that not only should you afford greater

opportunity for an expression of our views on this matter, but that

any such proposed procedures should be presented to the President's

Counsel for concurrence and for an expression of the President's viewe

as to the general policy of the Executive Branch in this regard. Further,

you may want to consider addressing the problem of the impact such

general disclosure of files would have on pending criminal investigations.

A preliminary review in the time avallable revealed that

certain items require considerable modification. For example, Item (8)e)

should be reconsidered with the following language;

"An exception to (2) and (b) above is made for information

that woald tend to identify sources to whom the F'ES has

INTERVIEW OF SUPERVISOR RICHARD H. BLOESER

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

On August 5, 1975,

Supervisor Richard H: Bloeser

was interviewed by SSC Staff Member Lester Seidel at the

Los Angeles FBI Office regarding the COINTELPRO/Black Panther

Party (BPP) .

MI..

Seidel advised Supervisor Bloeser that the

interview was voluntary, but did not advise Supervisor

Bloeser of his rights

in this matter.

Mr. Seidel inquired of Supervisor Bloeser as to

how many offices he had served in, his length of service in

the Bureau, and how long had been spent on intelligence

investigations.

Supervisor Bloeser replied that he had

served in Philadelphia, El Paso and Los Angeles, had been

in the Bureau approximately 24½-years, and had been assigned

to intelligence work for 22 years.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether Supervisor Bloeser

believed that

the Bureau had placed undue pressure on the

field to come up with counter intelligence proposals concerning

the BPP and was it difficult to come up with a proposal.

Supervisor Bloeser responded that there was no undue pressure

placed on the field vy the Bureau, that the COINTELPRO/BPP

was merely another case assigned to an agent and that agent!

as in any other case, had the responsibility of handling the

matter whether it concemed the solving of a case or the

submission of proposals.. Mr. Seidel was also informed that

it was not unduly difficult to come up with a proposal and that

a number of proposals were rejected at the field level and.

Mr. Seidel inquired specifically as to counter

intelligence proposals involving cartoons ridiculing the BPP.

INTERVIEW OF SUPERVISOR RICHARD H. BLOESER

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

Supervisor Bloeser responded that he vaguely remembered such

proposals but without reviewing the file had no definite

recollection. Mr. Seidel did not request that the file be

reviewed.

Mr. Seidel inquired specifically about a business

card which allegedly had been prepared by the Bureau bearing

the phrase "Karenga is impotent."

Mr. Seidel requested

Supervisor Bloeser's views on

the distribution of this

card

by the FBI.

Supervisor Bloeser responded

that he

vaguely

remembered the card, that he thought it was humorous, and

that the word impotent had various meanings.

Mr. Seidel then inquired about the blood feud

which existed

in the past between the US Organization and

the BPP and the efforts of the Bureau to keep this feud.

n the past betra

alive. and thus promote violence.

He specifically inquired

as to the personal feelings of

Supervisor Bloeser concerning

any counter intelligence proposals

which, if placed in

operation, could lead to violence between the two groups.

Supervisor Bloeser responded first that personally

he had no apologies for the counter intelligence program as

a whole,

that proposals submitted six or

seven years ago

were believed necessary at that time due

to the circumstances,

specifically that at that time the EPI and the us Organization

were involved in violent activity against the community as a

whole. Mr. Seidel was informed that the feud between the US

Organization and the BPP occurred long before the FBI

COINTELPRO became involved in the feud and that any proposals

approved by the Bureau had relatively little effect on the

violence

committed by either group.

Mr. Seidel was also

reminded that six or seven years ago the Congress of the

United States fully supported the war in Vietnam in which

thousands of people were killed but that under today's

circumstances no support has been given to South Vietnam.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) ;

INTERVIEW OF SUPERVISOR RICHARD H. BLOESER

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

Mr. Seidel then posed a hypothetical question

involving the

following factors: Would Supervisor Bloeser

now or in the past approve a counter intelligence proposal

whereby one extremist with a criminal record of violence

be anonymously informed that another extremist with a

record of criminal violence was an informant for the FBI,•

knowing that the alleged informant might be injured or

killed. Supervisor Bloeser replied that under the present

conditions such a proposal would not be approved, but

that he could not give an answer as to what his feelings

might have been six or seven years ago under any given

situation.

Mr. Seidel was again reminded that Congress

in the past has not hesitated to support wars which kill

thousands of people but that recently they have critizedcized

the CIA for allegedly plotting to assassinate one individual

whose death might prevent a war. Mr. Seidel was also informed

that it was ironic that. Congress was investigating another

agency of the Federal Government which was attempting to

prevent revolutionary violence in this country.

Mr. Seidel:

then inquired into the counter

intelligence proposals approved by the Bureau in relation

to the actress Jean Seberg and Raymond Hewitt, a leader

of the BPP.

This proposal concerned the fact that Seberg,

who was then married to a French producer, admitted being

pregnant by Hewitt who was also maryled at the time...the

Bureau approved anonymons ly leaking chis intormation to a

Hollywood

columnist.

Mx. Seidel inquired as to whether

Supervisor Bloeser did or did not believe that this was an

invasion of privacy. Supervisor Bloeser responded that the

item was news worthy and that it would have been any. fair game

for any newsmen had they come across it in the course of their

a newspaper for

printing such an item or claim it to be an ivasion of privacy.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to the purpose of this particular

operation and he was informed that Miss Seberg was giving

support to the BPP and that it was hoped that such publicity

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

He was further advised that it was the responsibility of the

FBI to determine who was funding revolutionary groups in this

country.

Mr. Seidel then inquired as to whether or not it

was difficult to conduct intelligence investigations under

present statutes and under the Criminal Rules of Procedure.

He was informed that it was somewhat difficult to conduct an

effective intelligence operation under present circumstances

and that perhaps new legislative or executive orders would be

helpful to the FBI in order to allow the FBI to continue its

investigations in the Domestic Intelligence field. Mr. Seidel

inquired as to whether it would be helpful to have specific

legislation which might completely separate criminal and

ntelligence operations so one would not taint the other..

He was informed that if such legislation could be enacted

that it would undoubtedly help the FBI.

The interview lasted approximately two hours and

it was not necessary to consult with another Bureau

representative during this time.

advised Seidel that he had only been assigned the

Cointelpro/Black Panther Party matter for three

months and had no knowledge that would be of value

to Seidel. The Cointelpro/Black Panther Party matter

SA Ward advises that he is aware that the

Director waived his employment agreement with certain

exceptions regarding privileged areas.

With this

mind, sA ward reviewed his employment agreement and

concluded, after noting the following quotation, that

he could not disclose any information without following

the prescribed procedure:

"The burden is on me to determine, prior to

disclosure, whether intormation may be disclosed, and

in this regard, I agree to request approval of the

FBl in each such instance by presenting

the full text of my proposed disclosure in writing to

the Director of the FBI at least thirty (30) days prior

to disclosure"

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

I am writing to call your attention to a mat-

ter which may be a cause of concern to you and to the

Select Committee at some time in the future.

As you may know; a special unit has been estab-

iu IDi Intelligeno Divisica Lo bandle Lic

Committee's requests for materials and to handle certain

arrangements for the Committee staff's interviews. The

Special Agents assigned to this unit accompany Bureau

witnesses to the Committee offices, travel to out-of-town

locations where Committee staff interviews are conducted,

and apparently "de-brief" interview subjects after the

interviews.

One possible problem has arisen with this arrange-

ment.

As you are aware, one of the alleged abuses which

the Committee is examining pursuant to S. Res. 21 Involves

the FBI's activities with respect to the late Di. Martin

Luther King, JI.

As the inquiry has proceeded, informa-

tion has been developed to indicate that one of the

Special. Agents who has been handling Committee staff inter-

"de-briefing" witnesses, and, presumably, compiling

materials with respect to the king matter was also the

supervisory case agent during the time that some of the

alleged FBI improprieties regarding Dr. King took place.

Moreover, as a logical step in our investigation, it was

recently necessary to interview this Special Agent to

determine the nature and extent of his involvement in and

knowledge of the alleged abuses at the time when he served

as supervisory case agent with respect do the King case.

During the interview

he did provide detailed information

concerning his substantial participation in this matter.

The Committee in no way intenös at this juncture

to pre-judge the propriety of the FBI's activities with

respect to Dr. King, and it would be inapropriate to

characterize

the conduct of any of the Bureau's personnel

regarding this case until all the facts are in.

Neverthe-

less, I am concerned that in this kind of situation, the

interests of the FBI and the Department of Justice might

best be

served, from the standpoint of appearances, by re-

considering the assignment of this Special Agent to the

King matters.

It is possible that some may conclude that •

there is a conflict between the Special Agent's personal

interest, and the interests of the FBI and the Justice

Popertment in encuring that full disclose to the commit-

tee is made with respect to this case..

has no evidence that the present arrangenent has prevented

the Committee from obtaining the full asclosures sought;

but it seems to me that it would be mutully beneficial

for appropriate steps to be taken so that we will both be

able to assure the American people and the Congress that

our oversight responsibilities were fulfilled in an objec-

tive and impartial way.

I hope you will share my view that this course

will best serve our respective interests

and, of course,

the interests of the country.

(PURSUANT TO 5. RES. 21, 81TH CONGRESS)

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20510

August 28, 1975

Honorable Edward H. Levi

Attorney General

U. S. Department of Justice

Washington, D. C. 20530

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

I would like to bring to your personal attention

a situation which has severely restricted our efforts to

establish the relevant facts with respect to one. of the

areas of alleged abuse which is the subject of inquiry.

pursuant to S. Res. 21.

I have been informed by the staff that numerous

materials which have been requested during the past several

weeks which pertain to the FBI!s activities with respect to

DI. Martin Luther King, JI., have been withheld from the.

Committee by the Department because of concern expressed

by Mr. Harry Wachtel, the attorney for the King family and

estate,

as to the appropriateness of the Department's

"disseminating" to the Committee contents of conversations

monitored during electronic surveillances of Dr. King.

han a the do one ones

Upon reviewing the lists of materials requestea,

I am at a loss to understand how most of those items could

conceivably be encompassed by the issues raised by Mr. Wachtel,

especially in view of the fact that our letters of request

have specifically pointed out that tape recordings and trans-

cripts should not be supplied.

Accordingly, I want to take this opportunity to

place the Committee formally on record as reaffirming all of

the outstanding requests for materials relating to the King

matters, with the limited exception of (1) Mr. DeLoach's

August 24 - 27, 1964 memoranda which pertain to the 1964

Democratic National Convention, and (2) those portions of any

other requested materials which actually sumnarize or quote

from conversations monitored during any electronic surveill-

ance of DI. King.

agreement between the Department and the Committee which

governs all Committee
