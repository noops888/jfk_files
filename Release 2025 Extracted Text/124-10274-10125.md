Everyone inside said the feeling about this demonstration

fulfill those commitments.

And that atmosphere of res-

It helps me through the rough times and all

the ideological hassles and struggles we go through.

You really have a sense that everyone really wants to work

The source related that Sara LNU and Naomi INU,

has no common politics and no common political direction

at this point and the WBF could become a defense committee,

not because it would be desireable, but because of a lack

of any other direction.

The source advised that.on the same day, Clark

was in touch with Amy Lobenstine, from the WßF at telephone

DATE:

Re New York airtel and IHM, 8/28/72, and captioned

as above.

on 11/28/72, INFORMANT advised the Women's Bail Fund,

(WBF) is not a leading element and lacks any influence in the

movement in New York City.

A review of the subject file discloses there is no

structure to the WBF and that it is a coalition of women who

belong to various groups in the New York City area,

, whose main

purpose is to raise funds for selected women in jail.

It is noted that Weatherman subjects have contacted

those involved in the bail fund.

However, have decryed the

lack of political diréction of

the WBF and would like to turn

it into a defense committee because of a lack of any other

direction. There is no indication, that this has occurred, and

the bail fund still remains a loose coalition oi like-minded :.

individuals irom various groups seerino to suise duids for

various purposes. Because of its lack of common political, dir.

ection, it has had no influence and presently is ineffective in

the movement.

In view of the above, the NYO is discontinuing investi-

gation in thies. matter

as a structured group for a common political and ideological

purpose.

Re: Vincent Hallinan

Vincent Hallinan was candidate for President

or tne united states on the Independent Progressive Party

ticket in 1952.

This party was formed in California in 1948

and ceased to exist in 1954, when it failed to poll sufficient

votes to remain on a California ballot.

The California

Senate Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities in

its 1955 report on page forty-six, states in part that the

Independent Progressive Party in California was quickly

A source advised on April 20, 1966, that Vincent

Hallinan was the Treasurer for American Institue For Marxist

YOU CANNOT HAVE

WARS WITHOUT

WOMEN

Women must use their minds, their voices, and

their bodies to stop the killing in Vietnam; to do

less is to ignore our special responsibilities to

the human race.

"10, 000 women have sat back and let their sons

be killed in Vietnam. If we had 10, 000 women

willing to go to jail if necessary we could stop

the war in Vietnam. You cannot have wars with-

out women. "

Jeannette Rankin made the above statement in

May of this year. Fifty years ago, as the first

woman elected to Congress, she voted against

World War I. She has consistently maintained

her struggle for peace, and at 86 she is as coura-

geous and vigorous as ever--an inspiration to all

women.

The presence of the United States forces in the int

•ernal struggle of Vietnam is immoral and illegal.

There can be no possible justification for our inte

ference in the domestic affairs of this tiny distant

land.

This 86-year-old woman has stated that she is wil

ing to stay in jail until the bombing is stopped. N

all women are free to join her, but we can assure

her' that thousands of women will march peacefull

beside her. Some will picket, others will go to ja

with Miss Rankin. Every woman's participation i

equally valuable. We are confident each one will

the maximum of which she is capable.

On January 8th, women from all over the land wil

converge on Washington to demand the end of this

dishonorable wai. We shall come as individuals,

or as organizations, but we shall join together as

concerned women under the aegis of Jeannette Rai

INFORMATION CONCERNING

(INTERNAL SECURITY)

The San Francisco Office has reported that an

organization known as the Jeannette Rankin Brigade has sent

out a call for women from throughout the Nation to demonstrate

at the White House on 1/8/68.

This call also urges partici-

pants to "enter the U.S. Congress" to present demands for an

end to the war.

Jeannette Rankin, who is the Chairman of the

Brigade, is an 86-year-old

resident of Watkinsville, Georgia.

She was a Congresswoman from Montana from 1917 to 1919 and

served one term in 1940. She voted against U.S. involvement

in World Wars I and II.

Rankin has publicly protested the

war in Vietnam and has asserted her willingness to go to

jail in protest of the bombing.

The Secretary of the Brigade has been identified

as Vivian Hallinan, the wife of Vincent Hallinan who was

identified in 1966

as the Treasurer for the American Institute

of Marxist Studies, a communist front organization.

The above information has been furnished to the

White House, the Department of State, the Attorney General

and military intelligence.

In view of the Bureau's responsibility to identify

subversive elements which may participate in the demonstration

sponsored by this group and to keep the White House and other

agencies advised of developments, it is felt that the field

should be notified of the proposed demonstration and furnished

with instructions for handling information concerning it,

including the need for informant coverage of participating

groups.

BRIGADE FORMED TO CONFRONT CONGRESS

Helena, Montana

November 27, 1967

To all American Women:

I an proud of the fact that my first

vote cast in Congress was a vote

against war. It was the first oppor-

unity for a woman to vote, because I

was the first woman to be

elected to

Congress.

I believed then, as I do today,

that women are the ones that must be

concerned with the needs and develop-

ment of the human race.

I have always

fought for the dignity of all human

beings - for those of the present

as

well

as those of future generations.

I will continue to struggle as long

as I live. I hope all women will res-

pond to

the following call and join me

in Washington on January 8, 1968, the

opening day of Congress.

Jeannette Rankin

A CALL TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN whO

are outraged by the ruthless slaughter

in Vietnam and the persistent neglect

of human needs at home TO COME TO

WASHINGTON ON JANUARY 8

AMERICAN WOMEN represent 51% of the

voting population of out country.

AMERICAN WOMEN have the power to a-

chieve peace and a decent life for

every Amarican.

This is woman power!

Demonstrate it to the Congress of the

United States! Come to Washington on

January 8 as Congress opens in joint

session.

Support Jeanette Rankin as

she leads a representative delegation

of American women to the Capitol to

demand that:

*Congress, as its first order

of business, resolve to end

the war in Vietnam and imnedi-

ately arrange for the with-

drawal of all American troops.

*Congress use its power to make

reparations for the ravaged land

we leave behind in Vietnam.

*Congress listen to what the

American people are saying and

refuse the insatiable demands of

the military-industrial complex.

WOMEN OF AMERICA, our power is un-

limited. On January 8, American women

will:

*PETITION the United States Con-

gress

• *CONVENE a Congress of American

Women that afternoon to develop

programs to meet the crisis in

America - programs which will

express our political power,

reason and conscience.

form a contingent of the JRB from Southern California. They

are making office space and telephones in their Los Angeles

headquarters, 5899 West Piço Boulevard, Los Angeles available

for this purpose.

Spearheading the local committee are

Mary Clarke and Eva Korn, both of whom are active in WSP.

Mary Clarke is currently a member of the JPE's National

Source Three reported during November 1947, that

Eva Korn was a member of the Los Angeles County

Communist Party (ASCCP.) during the years 1946

To give publicity to the proposed activity of the

JRB, the local WSP office is circulating a reprint from the

"San Francisco Chronicle"

page nine, which contained a feature article regarding the

opposition

to wars by former Congresswoman Jeannette Rankin,

for whom the JRB has been named.

Rankin Brigade should be made up of only those women who

volunteer to participate with the prior understanding that

they should be ready to spend at least two months in jail

for the commission of civil disobedience while in Washington,

D. C.

Sunderland also suggested that a good way to recruit

women to join the brigade would bento make a pitch for

recruits when Mary Clarke, Dagnar

United States since their return from a trip to Nosth Vietnam,

Source Four advised during the summer of 1965

that June Sunderland, 3730 Hollister Avenue,

Santa Barbara, California, had attended a 1967

"peace conference" in Helsinki, Finland, at the

invitation of the Communist Party (CP),

and that

funds to cover her expenses were raised in pari

by the CP; and that following her attendance at

the Helsinki affair she went on to Russia for ten

days at the invitation and expense of the Soviet

Government.

Source One learned that a communication was re-

ceived from eastern sponsors of the JRB on December 7, 1967,

indicating that the JRB march on Washington might not

held on January 8, 1968, but possibly would be set back until

either the 15th or 22nd of January 1958, depending upon

the date that the United States Congress would reconvene.

The communication indicated that since the entire purpose

of the Brigade would be to coniront the opening joint session

of Congress that it would be futile to schedule the march

prior to the date Congress would reconvene, The suggestion

was made that recruitment of local omen to participate in

the ERB be held in abeyance until a confirmation had been

obtained indicating the date on which Congress would reconvene.

Source One, had indicated that although the "Call"

of her son, RONALD LOCKMAN. . .

HALLINAN originally had wanted WILLIAMS to be at

the launching of the Brigade at a press conference to be held.

in Washington, Do Co, on Veterans Day, 11/11/67, along with

mothers, sisters,

and widows of men killed in Vietnam.

HALLINAN desired

WILLIAMS to furnish her with the names of

mothers and wives of men killed in Vietnam who felt their

loved ones should not have been there at. all.

Since Mrs. WILLIAMS did not return until after

11/11/57, she did not know of the event, and therefore, did

not participate.

Additionally, she did not get around

to

reading all her

mail until much

after she returned to

This was the reason the source did not learn of this

Brigade until December.

Jeannette Rankin made the above statement in

Way of this year.

Fifty years ago, as the first

woman elected to Congress, she voted against Torld

War I. She has consistently maintained her strug-

gle for peace, and at 8e she is as courageous and

vigorous as ever - an inspiration to all women.

The presence of the United States forces in

the internal struggle of Vietnam is immoral and

111egal.

There can be no possible justification

for our interference in the domestic affairs of

this tiny distant land.

This 86-year-old woman has stated that she.

is willing to stay in jail until the bombing is

stopped.

Not all women are

we can assure her that thousanas of women Till

march peacefully beside her.

Some will picket,

others

will go to jail until bail is arranged,

and others will stay in jail with Hiss Rankin.

Every woman'e participation is eoually valuable.

Te are confident each one will do the maximum of

which she is capable.

On january 8th, women from all over the land

will converge on Washington to demand the end of

• this dishonorable war.

PORTLAND, OREGON 97213

December 18, 1967

Dear Friend:

We are sending this letter to you and others from whom we have not heard much

recently, in the hope of re-enlisting your efforls in the Women for Peace

movement.

It has been too long since we last heard directly from many of you,

and our meetings with those of you whom we have seen recently have been brief.

Of course, we know the paralyzing sense of frustration we all feel occasionally,

as ie learn of the mounting horrors in Victnam.

But this feeling is only

temporary, and quickly gives way to activity.

As women, we bear the major

responsibility for the preservation of life, and thus a major responsibility

in the peace movement.

Inclosed you will find an announcement of the latest national women's effort

for peace. Several peace groups in Portland are cooperating in raising funds

to send representatives to hashington. We hope that you will also support this

effort, to insure representation from Portland Women for Peace. The coupon

on the enclosed notice is for your use in this effort.

In addition, we will have a supportive peaceful demonstration

in Portland at

NOON, Monday, JANUARY 15th

Pioneer Post Office

5th and Morrison

We are asking participants to wear black, and to bring a black

(or dark colored) umbrella.

We shall carry the umbrellas opened,

min or shine. Placards (to wear) and leaflets (to distribute),

expressing suppet to the deannette Rankin Brigade, will be

available.

We shall march around the Post Office block for one hour

from noon to 1 p.M., leafleting as we walk.

He hope, It you cannot go to lashington, yoursell, that you will contribute to

neup someone else to go, and that you will also join with us at the Pioneer

fost Office at noon Monday, January 15th.

In addition, please let us hear from you on your ideas of what more we might

do locally.

We have some ideas too, which we hope to share with you, and on

winich we shall need much help.

Please get in touch with one of us soon. Your help, ideas, and efforts are

urgently needed.

Yours for Peace,

To all American Women:

CONFIDENTIAL

• November 27, 1967:

I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress was a vote against war.

It was the first opportunity for a woman to vote, because I was the first woman

to be elected to Congress.

I balieved then, as I do today, that women neu the ones that must be concerned

with the needs, and, development of the human race. I have always fought for the

dignity of all human beings - for those of the prosent as well as those óf future

generations. :::

:.i.

I will continue to struggle as long as I live.

I hope all women will respond to

the following. call and join me in Washington on

participating who are opposed to such civil disobedience.

However, she further stated that individuals are not going to

be discouraged who might elect

COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF THE

FIRST UNITARIAN CHURCH OF LOS ANGELES

A source advised on May 22, 1967, that the

premises of the First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles, 2936

West 8th Street, Los Angeles, California, have been utilized

for meetings by Communist Party members and sympathizers

a period of years.

Speakers and lecturers at the church

frequently espouse Communist causes or follow the Communist

Party line.

Communist front group literature is distributed

at the church. The church is used by some Communist Party

members for

"mass concentration" work.

This same infiltration extends to adjuncts of

the church such as the Unitarian Public Forum and the Fellow-

ship for social Justice, formerly known as the Unitarian-

Universalist Fellowship

for Social Justice.

STEPHEN H. FRITCHMAN has been minister of the

church since 1948.

Rubin, CPUSA National Organizational Secretary, stated the Party•

believes the DCA should have a working-class outlook and be a mass

organization favorable to socialism, socialist countires and

Marxism, and ir April, 1907, advised that Gus Hall, CPUSA General

WOMEN FOR PEACE aKa

Women Strike for Peace

The "Berkeley Daily Gazette,"

a daily newspaper of

general circulation published in Berkeley, California,

contained an article in

the November 19, 1965, evening

edition reflecting that in November, 1961, when con-

cern mounted over radioactive fallout from nuclear

testing, a group of women in Washington, D. C. started

Women Strike for Peace. The idea spread rapidly through-

out the country and now embraces 900 groups, including

Women For Peace groups in the San Francisco Bay area.

These groups support programs to achieve goals such as:

(1) Continued disarmament negotiations.

(2) A strong and flexible United Nations.

(3)

Planning now at state and national levels for

conversion to peace-time economy and positive

efforts to ease world tensions.

Ihe women act as

individuals and as a group, with specific

actions suggested by individuals and groups from all over

the world.

Decision to participate jointly on any given

suggestion is democratly arrived at by members of the Co-.

ordinating Committee. Effective cooperation with other

peace groups is encouraged. Monthly Coordinating Committee

meetings and general meetings, as warranted, are open to

all and announced in mailings to members.

There are no

dues or membership forms nor conditions for membership.

To stir an awareness of the need for peace, Homen for

Peace encourage public education in peace objectives at

local schools and sponsor peace-oriented demonstrations

the group attempts to influence government officials

by letters and conferences.

"First Annual Report CCASF," an undated publication which

stated that the Chicago Council of American-Soviet Friendship

(CCASF) was incorporated in July, 1943. This document stated,

"The Council's affiliation with the National Council of

American-Soviet Friendship (NCASF) was validated August 11,

(1943). The present name was adopted to conform to standard

national practice.

It should be noted, however, that the

Chicago Council is entirely autonomous; the government of its

affairs rests exclusively in the hands of its Chicago Executive

Board,"

On April 8, 1965, a source furnished information to

the effect that as of March 11, 1965, this organization would

be known as the Chicago Council of American-Soviet Relations

(CCASR). MANDEL TERMAN continued to be listed as Chairman of

the

neW

organization.

During April, 1965, a second source advised that

MANDEL TERMAN had arbitrarily dissolved the Board of Directors,

assumed all financial and other functions of the organization,

and was maintaining existing records of the organization at

his residence, 660 West Irving Park Road, Chicago, Illinois.

The aims and purposes of this organization continued to be

to work for peaceful coexistence and friendship with the UssR.

While it claimed to be an autonomous organization, its program

followed the NCASF and it was in frequent contact with the

NCASF.

On November 5, 1958, a third source advised that in

the early 1940s, MANDEL TERMAN was a member-at-large of the

Communist Party (CP) of Illinois.

November, 1958, where he had gone to discuss the treatment of

Jews and

to discuss Jewish culture in the USSR with the

leadership of the Soviet Union.

CHICAGO COUNCIL OF AMERICAN

SOVIET RELATIONS

January, 1960, a fourth source advised that the

CCASR went out of existence in the

spring of 1965 due to

health condition of MANDEL A, 'PLIN.

The offices oi the

CCASR, formerly located at 32 West

Randolph Street, Chicago,

were for a short time carried at HANDEL TERMAN's home

resi-

dence,

660 West Irving Park Road,

Chicago.

During the Fall

of 1965 due to the defunctness of the cCash, the CP of Illinois

found it necessary to sponsor a rally honoring the 48th

anniversary of the Russian Revolution under a temporary

committee called

• "The Chicago Conmittee for American-Soviet

Friendship Rally." This rally was held on November 7, 1965,

and once the rally was held this temporary committee went

out of existence.

The fourth source advised that as of the present

time the CCASR is defunet in the chicago area and any future

rally to be held on the

American-Soviet friendship theme will

have to be organized by the CP of Illinois on a temporary

basis.

The NCASE has been desigratso pursuant to brecutive

Order 10450.

NATIONAL LAWYERS GUILD

CHICAGO CHAPTER

A source advised on May 9, 1967, that it was

his

understanding that the National Lawyers Guild (NLG) was

formed around 1936 in New York City, and that the Chicägo

Chapter of the NG (CCNLG), which is affiliated with the

national

group in New York, was formed shortly theresiter:

possibly in 1937 by a group of liberal progressive lawyers

in protest against activities of the American Bar AssoCa&ülOn

which they claimed was a non-liberal,

non-progressive

organization. The CCNLG has no established headquarters bat

occasionally

uses the return address of its officials in

TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN,

I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress

was a vote against war. It was the first opportunity for a

woman to vote because I was the first woman to be elected

to Congress.

I believed then as I do today that women are the ones who

must be concerned with the needs and development of the

human race. I have always fought for the dignity of all

human beings -- for those of the present as well as those

of future generations.

I will continue to struggle as long as I live.

I hope all women will respond to the following CALL, and

join me in Washington on January 8, 1968, the opening

day of Congress.

With highest hopes,

Jamiete anten

A CALL

AMERICAN

WOMEN

who are outraged by the ruthless slaughter in Vietnam

and the persistent neglect of human needs at home

TO COME TO WASHINGTON JANUARY 15. & 16 ..

AMERICAN WOMEN constitute 51% of the voting population, yet a high percentage of us don't vote. .

It is time for women to break out of their societal molds and take their place as effective, vocal citi-

zens. WOMEN CAN ELECT the President they want; Women can determine the political, social and

economic direction of the nation. WE HAVE WOMEN POWER. Let's use it to demonstrate our

opposition to this war to the Congress of the United States.

We are a broad coalition of women from many areas of American life. We shall meet in Washington

on January 15 for the opening of Congress to demand the following:

1. CONGRESS, AS ITS FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS, RESOLVE TO END THE

WAR IN VIETNAM AND IMMEDIATELY ARRANGE FOR THE WITHDRAWAL

OF ALL AMERICAN TROOPS.

2. CONGRESS USE ITS POWER TO HEAL A SICK SOCIETY AT HOME.

3. CONGRESS USE ITS POWER TO MAKE REPARATION FOR THE RAVAGED

LAND WE LEAVE BEHIND IN VIETNAM.

4. CONGRESS LISTEN TO WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SAYING AND

REFUSE THE INSATIABLE DEMANDS OF THE MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL

COMPLEX.

After we petition the United States Congress, we will hold our own congress to articulate our position

on the basic problem of achieving peace. We declare our intention to return to our communities and

mobilize women to dedicate ourselves to reshaping American society, and restoring our country to a

position of honor in the community of nations.

On January 15, we will meet at the Union Depot in Washington, D.C., at 11:30 A.M., and walk behind

our delegation which will present our petition to the U.S. Congress.

On January 16, many of us will stay in Washington to begin implementation of these demands by

presenting them to our Congressmen and Senators. We hope you can stay.

WIA - see appendix are the two major organizations in

Southern California working for the success of the January 15,

1968, activities of the JRB both locally and in Washington,

D. C.

Subcommittees of the JRB have been meeting in the

headquarters of WSP at 5099 West PiCo Boulevara, and Wit at

5009 West Pico Boulevara, Los Angeles. During the most

recent of these subcommittee meetings, held during the first

week in January 1968, at the latter location, much of the

discussion was related to proposed action in

Southern California

by women who would be unable to travel to Washington, D. C.,

for the January 15th confrontation with Congress.

Minor changes in the previously announced schedule

of local activities for January 15, 1968, were agreed upon

at this meeting, as follows:

Southern California area began

1tg operations in the late fall of 1961, as an affiliate

of the national organization formed in Washington, D.C.

It

1s a peace oriented women's organization which is opposed

to the present American foreign policy in Vietnam.

It has

also sought legislation which ould bring about the abolition

_...of the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUA). In

recent months the organization has sponsored demonstrations

protesting

the United States Involvement in Vietnam and

calling for the complete withdrawal of all United States

from Vietnam.

In the spring of 1966, 1t was instrumental

In originating and

putting into effect

support for "

peace candidates"

elections.

The same source stated that WSP. is a non-membership

organization and has no officers.

The organization is open

to women of all political opinions who are interested in world

peace.

It makes no effort to exclude from its activities

members of, or persons sympathetic to, the Communist Party.

and related groups.

The gulding force behind the Southern California

WSP groups is MARY CLARKE.

A second source advised in July,

that CLARKE was dropped from the Western Division, Los

in favoring or opposing legislation. usually parallels the

position of the Comrunist Farty and related groups. It also

supports legislation to abolish the House Committee on Un-

nette Rankin Brigade demonstration originally scheduled for

January 8, 1968, at Washington, D.C., had been postponed until

January 15, 1968, when Congress reconvenes. The source made

available a leaflet concerning the event. A reproduction is

attached.

On January 9, 1968, a second source, who has

nished reliable information in the past, reported TATul HALONEN

and possibly others planned to go to Washington, D.C.,

for the

demonstration and would probably travel via United

Air Lines.

TAIMI HALONEN was reported by the first

source in December, 1967, as being a mem-

ber of the Communist Party (CP) at that

time.

On January 9, 1968, WENDELL C. WOODARD, Reservations

JEANNETTE RANKIN

HELENA, MONTANA

November 27, 1967

TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN,

I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress

was a vote against war. It was the first opportunity for a

woman to vote because I was the first woman to be elected

to Congress.

I believed then as I do today that women are the ones who

must be concerned with the needs and development of the

human race. I have always fought for the dignity of all

human beings - for those of the present as well as those

of future generations.

I will continue to struggle as long as I live.

I hope all women will respond to the following CALL,, and

join me in Washington on January 8, 1968, the opening

day of Congress.

With highest hopes,

Dear WSPER:

Women Strike for Peace nationally is supporting the Jeannette Rankin Brigade.

Planeloads, trainloads and carloads of women will be coming into Washington on Mon-

day, January 15th, from all over the country.

He are particularly pleased with this action because it represents for the first

time a real coalition of women's peace groups, church groups, theatre personalities, .

and community leaders.

The Day is envisioned as a solemn, dignified confrontation of those who should be

representing the ever growing opposition to the war.

We ask that you write your Con-

gressmen urging that they support the four points listed in the enclosed Call as Con-

gress reconvenes.

Later in the afternoon at our Women's Congress we want to be able to

report on Congressional responses.

We will all meet at Union Station in Washington at 11:30 All and slowly walk to the

Capitol. We ask the women to wear black.

We will be led by Jeannette Rankin who will

proceed to the top of the Capitol steps with a representative delegation of 50 women to

resent our petition to the two men who represent the whole of Congress, Senator Mike

ansfield and Speaker of the House McCormack. The delegation will read the demands be

ore the assembled women and the two Congressmen.

Leaving the Hill, the women will enter

juses for a motorcade to a Congress of American Women (place to be

announced).. Women

rill present an analysis of the current crisis on the war front and the domestic front,

Leading to suggestions for program and actions to be taken back to our comnunities for

,lementation.

Women may choose to remain in lashington the next day to meet with their Congressmen.

I you wish to stay and wish help in securing accommodations, contact the Hospitality Com

ittee, 2140 P. St. N.W. Washington, DC (293-2020). We regret that in order to get the

owest

train fare we had to guarantee return the same day; therefore you would have to

inance your own trip back on the loth.

Our hope is that 10,000 women will converge upon Washington. We urge you to parti

ipate.

Yours for Peace,

Ethel Taylor

TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN:

I am proud of the lack that my first vote cast in Congress

was a vote against the war.

It was the first opportunity

fox a woman to vote, because I was the first woman

to be

elected to congress.

I believed then, as I do today, that women are the ones that

must be concerned mith the needs and development of the

hunan race. I have always toughi for the dignity. of all

human beings - foi those of the present as well as those.

of future generations.

I will continue to struggle as long as I live. I hope all

women will respond to the following call

and Join me in

* Today, January 15,

Ungress

reconvenes in Washington.

Women from all over the United

States have gathered there to

petition the Congress in the

name of the Jeanette Rankin

Brigade.

Jeannette Rankin,

the first woman to serve in

Congress and the only person

to vote against U.S. entry

into both World Wars, leads

the women there, along with

such other sponsors as Mrs.

M.L.King, Mrs. Harry Belafonte,

Mr's. John C. Bennett, Mrs.

Benjamin Spock,

Mrs Judith

Morse Eaton, The Brigade is a

national coaliti

of women.

antiwar groups mobilized

against the war in Veitnam.

As the cost of the war in lives

and money mounts daily, the

women of this country call upon

congress to take action against

it.

To support the senators and

Congressmen who oppose the war,

to encourage those who are troubled

but silent, to speak out, and to

make our position known

to those

who still support this immoral

war, we, as women of Hawaii, are

gathered here.

Our messagè to

Reps. Mink and, Matsunaga, to

Sens. Fong and Inouye, is that

women will no longer give their sons and loved ones to a government

waging a genocidal war...

women will no longer accept a government which represents a military

and industrial

machine rather than its people...

women will no longer consent to raise their children in the blight

and neglect of a society geared to profit and war...

women grieve for suffering people all over the world and will no longer

remain silent while the gap widens between the rich and the poor...

We ask our government to design and carry out a domestic program

commensurate with the needs of the American people; to foldow a

policy of non-intervention in the affairs of other countries; to

pursue our official committment to disarmament, and to respect

international law.

American women who, as women everywhere, are the bearers and conservers

of life, will not stand idly by as life is destroyed. in our name.

About two hundred Oahu women have signed the following petition to

Congress:

As Congress reconvenes, we urge that its first order of business

be to put an end to the war in Vietnam and arrange for the withdrawal

of. American troops; and that the Congress turn its attention to

ameliorating the crisis in America.

We urge the Congress to heal a sick society at home, to make reparations

for the ravaged land we leave behind in Vietnam and to refuse to

listen to the insatiable demands of the military-industrial complex.

the plans of captioned organization, a nationwide group of

women who are opposed to the war in

Vietnam, to stage a

demonstration in Washington, D.C. on 1/15/68 and present a

petition to Congress demanding

an end to the Vietnam war.

This demonstration was held as scheduled on 1/15/68.

The demonstrators marched from Union Station to

Union Square at the foot of Capitol Hill by way of Louisiana

Avenue.

The group was

preceded by several individuals

carrying a banner which read "End the War in Vietnam and Social

Crisis at Home."

Several women followed the marchers

carrying another banner which

read "United States Women

Unite, End the War in Vietnam."

other

Initially, the group carried

placards which read "End the War" and "LBJ Eats

Imperial Margarine."

However,

at the request of authorities,

these placards were discarded.

to the Capitol where they presented a petition to

Representative John W. McCormack, Speaker of the House of

Representatives, and to Senator

• Michael J. Mansfield.

The

petition entitled "A Petition to the 90th

Congress" pointed

out the opposition of women of the United States to the

ruthless slaughter in Vietnam and the persistant neglect to

human needs at home and demanded Congress as the first order

of business

resolve to end the war in Vietnam and immediately

withdraw all Americatroops.

It called for Congress to use its

power to help a sick society at home, to make

• reparations for

destruction in Vietnam and to listen

to what the American people

are saying and refuse the insatiable demands of the military

industrial complex.

Memorandum to Mr. W.C. Sullivan

RE :

JEANNETTE RANKIN BRIGADE

This petition was read to the demonstrators

assembled at Union Square by Swedish film actress, Viveca

Lindfors.

Following the assembly at Union Square, the marchers

were bussed to the Shoreham Hotel where they convened a

congress of American women from approximately 2:30 p.m..to

5:40 p.m.

During this time, speeches were made by Vivian

Hallinan, who has been described by her son, Tergence

Hallinan, as being willing to join the Communist. Party if her

husband would join.

Hallinan described the Brigade's goal as

"world without war" and "life with dignity and opportunities

to develop our maximum capacity."

Mrs. Martin Luther King, Jr., stated that women must

use all of their power to stop the war in Vietnam.

She

described present challenges as "militarism, racialism and

wantonism.

Jeannette Rankin welcomed the participants and stated

women must see that the military system is destroyed. She

recommended that women everywhere become candidates for political

offices.

Mrs. Dagmar Wilson, Chairman of the Women Strike for

Peace, a national pacifist group, spoke concerning United States

policy in Vietnam.

She stressed

the need for education in order

to change United

States policy and stated that their demonstra-

tion was the beginning of a revolution.

While this assembly was taking place a small group.

calling themselves Radical Womens Group met in a room across the

hall.

This group was very disorganized and was held without

apparent objective.

Sympathy demonstration were held in Miami, Florida;

Boston, Massachusetts; Seattle, Washington; St. Louis, Missouri;

presented a petition to the Mayor who agreed to transmit it to

Washington.

In Los Angeles, the continent attempted to speak

before the

City Council, but their request was denied.

DEMONSTRATION PROTESTING U.S.

POLICY IN VIETNAM

SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA

JANUARY 15, 1968

Chairman of the Brigade, announced to the demonstrators that this

local demonstration was principally gathered to support women

from around the. United States who were gathered in Washington,

D.C. today,

as part of a nation-wide demonstration sponsored by

to petition Congress to resolve

the conflict in Vietnam.

the Jeannette Rankin Brig Bridges stated that inasmuch as it

was not possible for the demonstrators to personally contact

their congressmen,

most of whom were out of town; that following

the presentation of a petition to Mayor Joseph Alioto, the

demonstrators would then proceed to the Western Union Office on

10th and Market Streets in San Francisco, so that the women

protestors could send wires to their congressmen, protesting

United States policies in Vietnam.

Bridges indicated that the

petitioners

would request Mayor Alioto to convey to Congress

their petition, which among other things urged Congress, as its

Ilnst order of business, to resolve to end the War in Vietnam and

immediately arrange for

withdrawal of all American troops from

Vietnam; for Congress to use its power to heal the sick society

at home and to make reparations for the ravaged lands left

behind in Vietnam.

source advised March 2, 1967, that Mrs. H.

Bridges, also known as

Nikki Bridges, 35

Kronquest Court,

San Francisco, California, was

listed as a recipient of a new yearly subscription

to the "People's World" (PW), expiration date.

March 4, 1968.

The PW is a west coast communist newspaper, •

published weekly in San Francisco.

The next speaker was identified as Aileen Hernandez.

She spoke

for approximately five minutes and briefly explained

to the demonstrators who Jeannette Rankin is and what the purposes

of the Jeannette Rankin Brigade

are. She stated that the group

has no principal spokesman and it is principally a group of

women who are involved and committed in a fight for peace.

Several of the demonstrators, led by Nikki Bridges,

then proceeded to the Office of Mayor Joseph Alioto to present

their petition.

SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA

JANUARY 15, 1968

Approximately ten minutes later the Mayor of

San Erancisco appeared on the steps of the City Hall and announced

to the demonstrators that he would gladly transmit their

petition to Congress.

Mayor Alioto stated that he fully

believed in the constitutional right of peaceful assembly.

He indicated, however, that because he had consented to

transmit the demonstrators' petition to Washington, he did not

necessarily agree with it.

The Mayor then stated that it

was his personal opinion that the United States Government and

the Johnson Administration had done all in its power to attempt

to come to a peaceful and honorable

solution in the Vietnamese

War.

He related that he felt that it was now up to the other

side to make the same attempts to arrive at a

peaceful solution

in the Vietnamese conflict.

At approximately 12:45 p.m., the demonstrators proceeded

to the Western Union Office located at l0th and Market Streets

in San Francisco, so that wires could be sent to their congressmen

in Washington.

A Special Agent of the fBI observed one plaine

the demonstration Yoneda was observed to return to her employment

at the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union

(ILWU) - Pacific Maritime Association, Pension Fund, at 150

Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco.

A second source advised on December 4, 1967, that

Elaine Yoneda is a current and active member of the Communist

Party, (CP) . .

On January 15, 1968, a Special Agent of the FBI

observed a silent protest by a

group of women on the lawn

of Colton Hall, Monterey, California, between 3:00 and 5:00 p.m.

These women

were ostensibly gathered to support the demonstration

being held in Washington, D.C., sponsored by the Jeannette Rankin

Brigade.

There were no speeches given; the demonstrators merely

conducted a silent vigil.

A one page leaflet captioned "Women To Take First

Step to End The War" printed by the Jeannette Rankin Brigade,

at 150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, California, was handed

out at the above demonstration.

A Xeroxed duplication of this

leaflet is appended to this memorandum.

INFORMATION CONCERNING

Reference is made to a memorandum,

captioned as

above, dated December 28,

1967, at Miami, Florida. The memorandum

concerned a call issued by the Jeannette

Rankin Brigade for American Women to travel

to Washington, D. C. on January 15, 1968,

to petition the United States Congress to

end the war in Viet Nam.

A sourse, on January 15, 1968, advised that the Miami

Chapter of the Women's International League for Peace and

Freedom (WILPF) had scheäuled a demonstration to take place

January 15, 1968, at Miami, Florida.

The demonstration

would be a support activity for the Jeannette Rankin Brigade

that would be in Washington, D. C. on that date to petition

Congress to end the war in Viet Nam.

The January 16, 1968, issue of

the "Miami Herald,"

a local Miami, Florida

newspaper, contained an article entitled

"FIve Thousand Women Join Viet Wir Frotest."

The article, identified Jeanette. Rankin w

as an 87 year old woman pacifist and

former member of Congress who voted in

Congress against the American entry into

both world wars.

A Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investi

gation (FBI) on January 15, 1968, observed an anti-war

demonstration take place in Miami, Florida. Approximately

70 participants, mostly elderly women, assembled at the

Torch of Friendship, Bayfront Park, downtown Miami, at

2:00 p.m. They stood in silent vigil, some wearing black

to participate in the demonstration in that city being

sponsored by the Jeannette Rankin Brigade although no firm

to fly to Washington from the, southern

California JRB Committee.. They were Bobbie, Hodges, Althea

and Glory Roberts. Two women affiliated

thex peace-oriented Pasadena Chapter of the Women's International

League for Peace and Freedom; Cathy. Hofer, and Marian Beardsley,

were also to join the above women for the flignt to Washington,

according to Source One.

On January 15, 1968, Special Agents of the Los Angeles

Office of the Federal Bureau of

Investigation observed a

group of women assemble in front of the Old State Building, 217

West First Street (First and Broadway, in the downtown Civic

Center), Los Angeles, Califomia, at approximately 9:30 AM.

The women were carrying placards indicating they were the

local representation of the JRB.

They also had two leaflets

for distribution (Xerox copies of which are appended to this

memoranäum) which called for women to participate and which

indicated that a voting block of American women had the power

to put an end to the war in Vietnam. These leaflets bore the

address of the JRB as 5899 West Pico Boulevard, Los Angeles,

California (90019), which is the address of the headquarters of

the WSP in Southern California.

Starting shortly after 10:00 AM, the women proceeded

to hold a rally on the south steps of the Old State Building,

with the speakers utilizing an electronic amplification system,

which was' held by actress Leslie Parrish.

Source One indicated that Parrish had originally been

scheduled to fly to Washington, D. C., to participate in the

JRB action at the Capitol, but

changed her plans at the last

minute in order to remain in

Los Angeles.

The rally was headed by Tina. Iomash, who acted as

the local JRB organizer and answered some of

the questions

regarding the JRB from members of the news media on the scene.

Veronica Sissons acted as mistress of ceremonies.

Speakers

Included Mary Henry. Negro civil rights and poverty worker;

Margaret fright who has been identified by Sources One and

Two as a militant black nationalist, who has been extremely

active in recent months in disturbances at Manual Arts High

School, Los Angeles, which resulted in a court injunction to

prohibit her entering those school grounds); and television

actress Ellen McRae.

The speakers all called for a coalition

of women to form a

strong voting block which could produce

legislation to end the war in Vietnam, end poverty and "legislated

injustice"

some youngsters

and infants.

The mother of one of the children

had a cardboard sign, depicting a bomb and the caption, "I'm

Glad I'm Not Vietnamese"

strapped to the back of her son who

appeared to be less than four years of age.

to influence legislation and bring an end to

war in Vietnam. She also called for support of other "liberal

radio broadcasters on our side"

William Winter.

, west coast

William Winter as chairman of a local citizens' committee to

safeguard the Joint Anti-Fascist Refuge Committee, which

organization has been cited pursuant to Executive Order 10450) •

Charlotte Sherman was introduced as the wife of

"Laurence Shernan, it being pointed out that he was an "

unsuccessful

candidate for public office, on a peace slate,

during 1907; but that both he and his wife were continuing

the

fight for an end to the war in Vietnan.

She said,

"It is time

Thoreau, indicating they were as timely today, as when he wrote

them.

Margaret Wright stated that werees the majority of

women in the demonstration were wearing black to denote mourning,

that she and her non-Caucasian associates who feel, "Black is

beautiful" were dressed in white to indicate their attitude of

mourning.

She called for the elimination of ROIC (Reserve

Officers Training Corps) from local high schools and junior

colleges, adding,

"They have got to get

live bullets out of the

schools,

and get

some live teachers in."

She repeated these

same statements during the arternoon when the JRB moved to

the Los Angeles City Board of Education.

As the rally was breaking up, Wright grabbed the

public address system and said that it had been learned that

the City Council was in session inside the City Hall Building.

She urged the women not to. disperse, but to join her and....

others in invading

Chambers with a demand

that the JRB be allowed to speak to the Council even though

they had not made previous arrangements for a place on the

agenda that day.

Some of the women were already out of range

of the public address system and did not hear this announcement

by Wright, having already been dismissed by. Sissons and told to

reconvene at the Board of Education following luncheon.

Approximately 200 of the demonstrators did enter

the Council Chambers.

They got word to the councilmen; through.

one of the staff members, that they wished to be heard.

They got

A motion to allow a JRB representative to address them was

put before the Council, and defeated by a vote of six to five.

Immediately following this vote, there was a unanimous vote

that the Council adjourn. As the councilmen filed out of the

room, Tima Tomash rushed

to the front shouting demands that

retur, while other of the women hissed and booed the

city legislators.

During the noon hour some of the women distributed

leaflets in the City Hall and on the surrounding streets in

the downtown Civic Center.

At 1:00 PM, the women, whose numbers had by that

time been reduced to 125, massed in the patio of the Los

Angeles City Board of Education, 450 North Grand Avenue,

Los Angeles. Sissons, Wright and Tomash addressed-the ...

assembled demonstrators, pointing out that money spent in

Vietnam could be better

spent in education.

Wright claimed

that many of the so-called student "drop-outs" are in reality

"push-outs"

, claining that she herself was one of the latter.

She said,

"We need books, not bonos.

We know this is

a racist

war and

we blacks are not going to fight a racist war"

* :She.:

indicated that rather than fight overseas, the black people

would remain at home and fight the racists. She also said,

"Just because I'm pro-black doesn't necessarily mean I'm anti-.

white."

Wright said,

"I'm not political, but I am honest. I

can't honestly get up and say the pleage of allegiance to the

American flag, because I really don't have liberty and justice;

so I just get up and stand and won't repeat the pledge.

Later, when she observed a photograph of President Johnson

hanging from a wall in the Administration Building at the

Los Angeles City Board of Education, she told the JRB women

with her,"

"We shouldn't have to look at such pornographic

pictures.

Wright said that her arrest at the hands of Los

Angeles City School Security Oilicers, during the recent

Manual Arts High School disturbance, had at least one bright

result. She said that at the time

of her arrest it had been

necessary for the arresting officers to drag her down the

hall as she was too heavy for them to carry.

Then she added

that the next time she is arrested the officers will not have

that excuse as she has lost thirty pounds in the meantime.

I'he speeches in the patio ended at 1:30 PM and many

of the women left immediately. Seventy-eight women remained

and attempted to enter a special committee meeting being attended

by some of the School Board members.

They were inforned by a

member of the administrative staff that the public meeting of the

School Board would not be held until 4:00 PM, the regularly

scheduled meeting time.. The women milled around in the hallway

outside the meeting room, until finally a staff memoer came out

and told them that two members of the School Board, Reverend

James E. Jones and DI. Julian. Nava, had agreed to grant them an

audience. The women were then ushered into the public board

room of the School Board where they waited until 2:00 PM at

which time the above-named Board members granted the demonstrators

a short audience and answered some questions put to them by the

One question, as to how much longer the members of the

School Board were going to permit recruiters from the armed

forces to interview students at local high schools and junior.

colleges remained unanswered, but Dr. Nava pointed out to the

women that he had seen nothing wrong in entering the armed

forces to fight for this country himself when he was 17 years

of age; and he could see nothing wrong in other young men who

wanted to do the same today. The demonstration was cancluded

by 3:00 PM. There were no incidents and no arrests. '

Placards carried during this demonstration in Los

Angeles bore the following captions:

"Eat Texas Beef, Not L.B.J. Baloney"

"Woman Power is Vote Power is Peace Power"

"Draft Beer Not Students"

"Where Have All the Men Gone-To Graveyards"

"Jeannette Rankin Brigade-Women's Votes Count, End

In the

"The southern Patriot" was cited

as an

"organ" of the SCHW.

An amendment to the charter of the SCHW dated

April 26, 1946, changed its name to the Southern Conference

Educational Fund, Incorporated (SCEF) and stated its purpose

to be to improve the educational and cultural standards

of

the Southern people in accordance with the highest

American democratic institutions, traditions and ideals.

The masthead of the April, 1967, issue of

"The Southern Patriot" indicates that it is the publication

at 3210 West Broadway, Louisville, Kentucky,

Eastern office of which

is located at Suite 412, 799

Broadway, New York City. New York.

"The Southern Palriot"

SCEF (Continued)

continued as an independent organization, rallying support

for integration and democracy and helping to stimulate

and nurture new movements of the early 1960's. The SCEF

maintained headquarters in Louisians for twenty years, but

in 1966 moved its headquarters to Louisville, Kentucky.

A

source advised on March 2, 1961, that Claude

Lightfoot, a Communist Party functionary, stated at a meeting

of the Communist Party in Baltimore, Maryland, on February 25,

1961, that the Communist Party is not connected with any

progressive movement but indirectly they do have some influence

in the SCEF.

A second source, who is familiar with some phases

of Communist Party activity in the New Orleans area, advised

on June 3, 1966, that during the time that the SCHW

was in

existence, members of the Communist Party were members of

and worked actively in the SCHw; however, since the formation

of the SCEF, Communist Party members have not been encouraged

to work in the SCEr.

The source stated that the SCEF is

a progressive, liberal organization, which he considers a

Communist Party front organization because it has gone along

with the Communist Party on certain issues, particularly

on the racial issue.

A third source advised on May 25, 1965, that

George Meyers, a Communist Party functionary, expressed

great admiration for Carl and Anne Braden and the SCEF,

with which they are affiliated, and expressed the view

that the SCEr is the best organization in the south

as far

as doing effective work is concerned and that they have a

better idea of what they are doing, where they are heading,

and influence other organizations for the better.

The second source also advised on June 3, 1966,

that many people who are officials and supporters of the

SCEF, while liberal in their views,

are by no means Communists.

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE

The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York Times"

newspaper contained a

full-page advertisement captioned

"What Is Really Happening In Cuba," placed by the Fair Play

for Cuba Committee (FPCC). This advertisement announced the

formation of the FPCC in New York City and declared the FPCC

intended to promulgate

"the truth about revolutionary Cuba" to

neutralize the distorted American press:

"The New York Times" edition of January 11, 1961,

reported that at a hearing conducted before the United States

Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on January 10, 1961,

Di. Charles A. Santos-Buch identified himself and Robert Taber

as organizers of the FPCC.

He also testified he and Taber

obtained funds from the Cuban Government which were applied

toward the cost of the aforementioned advertisement.

On May 16, 1963,

a source advised that during the

first two years of the FPCC's existence

there was a struggle

between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Forkers Party (SWP)

elements to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby

influence FFCC policy. This source added that during the past

year there had been a

successful effort by FPCC leadership to

minimize the role of these and other organizations in the FPCC

so that

their influence as of

May, 1963, was

negligible.

The SWP has been designated pursuant to Executive

Order 10450.

On May 20, 1963, a second source advised that Vincent

"Ted" Tee, FICC National Office Director, we inen formulating

FPCC policy and had indicated that he had no intention of

permitting FPCC policy to be determined by any other organization.

This source stated that lee believed that the FPCC should .

advocate resumption of diplomatic relations between. Cuba and

the United States and should support the right of

Cubans to manage their revolution without intezterence from

othei nations. Lee did not advocate supporti?; the Cuban

revolution per se.

The November 23, 1963, edition of "The New York Times"

reported that Senator Thomas o.

Dodd of Connecticut had called

FPCC "the chief public relations instrument of the Castro network

in the United States." It is to be noted that Senator Dodd was

a member of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee which

twice conducted hearings on the FPCC.

_UBA COMMITTEE (CONT' D)

The December 27, 1963, edition of "The New York World

regram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-Castro FPCC

-was seeking to go out of business and that its prime activity

during its lifetime had been sponsorship of pro-Castro street

rallies and mass picket lines, and the direction of an active

propaganda mill highlighting illegal travel-to-Cuba campaigns.

Its comparatively briei span of life was attributed to mounting

anti-Castro American public opinion, the 1962 Congressional

hearings which disclosed FPCC financing by Castro's United

Natiors Delegation, and ultimately, the bad publicity which

the FPCC received from disclosure of activities on its behalf

by suspected presidential assassin Lee H. Oswald.

On February 6, 1964, the previously mentioned second

source advised that V. T. Lee had recently remarked that the

FPCC was dead and that there were no plans to organize another

similar urganization.

On April 13, 1964, a third source advised that there

had not been any FPCC

activity in many months and that the

FPCC had been dissolved.

Following dinner, the Washington State delegation

California. Several California women were there to hear

instructions for Monday.

Rumors were rampant. One person

the line of march to create scenes which would result in

arrests. It was aiso stated police had prepared for five

hundred arrests; that all telephones into the demonstration

headquarters were being monitored; and that permission to

march was still being withheld.

After the California group

had been briefed, the following instructions were read to

the Washington delegates by MALVINA REYNOLDS of California:

(1) Maintain silence throughout the march.

(2) Maintain strict discipline; walk to the right

on the sidewalk.

(3) Follow the instructions of monitors in blue

armbands who will be under orders from white arm-banded marshals.

(4) Surround and isolate any trouble makers.

$25.00.

hours on the Seattle conference to be held Saturday, January

20th at Mt. Zion Baptist Church in Seattle at which

Seattle delegation would report. HALONEN made the observation,

however, that the women working on the program were all very

experienced leaders and she trusted they would formulate a

satisfactory program.

On Monday, January 15, 1968, the delegates including

the group from washington State, met at the Union Station in

Washington, DC: It was learned here that the instructions

which had been given the day before at the Shoreham Hotel were

evidently for the California group only, because many California

people had been badly beaten in previous demonstrations and

they were very cautious and somewhat apprehensive.

The

official pattern was different.

Mimeographed

sheets headed

"Jearrette Rankin Brigade - Information and Instructions" were

passed out and

these appeared to be the official instructions.

A reproduction is attached.

The Washington State delegation was enlarged when a

Mrs y BACKUP from Tacoma arrived.

RADER said some of the money

usually received from wealthy contributors had been collected

by Mrs. BACKUP.

Reverend HAROLD BASS of Tacoma collected

,.—

$1?0. 00, and wanted someone eise to go instead of ZErRa

( STUDAMIRE) •

RADER defended herself when TAIMI HALONEN criticized

her for bringing ZEFRA along since ZEFRA is at least six months

-pregnant.

-

After the demonstration, HEALY and RADER spent much

of the time urging the speakers to include in their talks some-

thing about the status of the American Indian.

ELLA BAKER from

New York did inciude a paragraph irom the paper the Washington

State delegation submitted to Congress.

This

was entitled,

"American indians and the Struggle for

Peace". It had been

prepared by LONNIE HEALY although at its bottom it carried the

notation

"(Prepared by the Jeannette Rankin Brigade Delegation

from Washington State)."

RADER, HEALY, and CORR became indignant because the

audience did not give a standing ovation to Mrs. MARTIN L. KING,

Jr. or any of the Negro speakers.

HEALY expressed great dissatisfaction with the

basic organization i:

the gathering.

She wanted an organi,

zational meeting instead of a rally type meeting which

occurred. HALONEN

and ROBEL agreed somewhat. HEALY implied

the whole thing was a waste of her time.

In the workshop section of the meeting, HALONEN

worked in the legislative action section; HELEN

FRENCH and

ELAINE HORSLEY in the electoral campaigns; and HEALY and

CORR in racism.

too, the younger women were very

critical. HEALY, particularly, resented having men as

'nesource people" for the group.

She said she thought this

was a women's congress. TAIMI said she found herself in a

situation that was quite different in that she was working

very broad spectrum of politically and economically

oriented

individuals and it was a real

learning experience.

HORSLEY was anxious to get back home and work for peace while

the spirit of JEANNETTE RANKIN was still fresh.

She and

HELEN FRENCH expressed

the view the congress met the needs

of American women in giving a concrete program on which to work.

Tuesday, January 16, 1968, was for lobbying. The

Seattle and Tacoma people were

told

to meet at the Methodist

Building, 100 Maryland Avenue.

HALONEN, ROBEL, HEALY, HORSLEY,

and HELEN FRENCH arrived before the appointed time. After about

an hour, EMELIA CASSIDY arrived stating RADER had an eye problem

and would be unable to attend.

Mrs. BACKUP joined the group.

but they were not in their offices.

After leaving a copy of

the women's petition and a questionnaire prepared by the

Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (see attachment)

they called on Washington State's Congressmen FLOYD HICKS and

BROCK ADAMS. Mr, HICKS WaS OUT OI TOWn: MIS. HORSLEY knew, the :

Congressman personally and her son knew two of the office

personnel.

She asked that they relate to him that she was

vitally interested in peace and social justice.

Congressman BROCK ADAMS was in his office and spent

about twenty minutes talking with the group concerning his

political views and some of

the political machinations of his

party.

The

group

then began to disintegrate. ELAINE HORSLEY

left to get a 2:30 flight to Boston where she would visit her

held at Tacoma, Washington, on

January 18, 1968, at which EMELIA CASSIDY, also known as

MILLIE

She stated she stayed at DONNA ALLEN's home there. She said

MARJORIE RADER got an eye infection which kept her from going

RADER remained at ALLEN's residence.

She added

ZEFRA STUDAMIRE shouldn't have gone because she

troubles might be attrituted to the fact STUDAMIRE is expecting

a baby in April. Crocill stated there were too many rules to

follow.

The delegates weren't premitted to carry a nail file,

wear peace buttons, or exhibit RANKIN buttons.

They had to walk

six abreast and were not allowed to march around the White

House.

She said a suit will be brought in court for this

denial of their rights. She went on to state each person had

or was given $10.00 to carry on his person so he could not

be arrested for vagrancy.

CASSIDY said a nurse, Mrs. HELEN M., COOK, had been

very helpful to the group.

COOK told CASSIDY she could be reached

at 719 Beechwood Road, Media, Pennsylvania, if more information

is desired concerning

Veterans for Peace, which was not further

described.

GUY RADER, a CP member at this meeting, tried to stop

CASSIDY when the latter complained ZEFRA STUDAMIRE was too

immature to have been sent to the conference, but CASSIDY wasn't

easy to stop.

She was incensed over the fact money had been used

for STUDAMIRE's trip and the latter refused to cooperate.

RADER

and STUDAMIRE remained in Washington, D.C. after the conference

to handle some business

with the Student Non-Violent Coordinating

jistori as indicsiive of racist America.

The National Congress of American

Indians opposes inis distortion of history. Beatings and murder of Indians

in raine go unchallenged. Congress voted in 195 to open up Indian land

reservations to state jurisdiction.

In actuality, this rides established

tribal courts and federal jurisdiction. It gives local bigoted authorities

more opportunity to harrass and open the way to ternination of our treaties

and in several places resulted in actual loss of land.

It Is as deadly to be an Indian in America as it is to be a soldier

in Viet Nam.

In che three years before 1907, more Indian children below the

age of lû had died in this country than the 6,628 U. S. combat casualties of

tle entire Viet Nan War (as of the end of 1960). Most of these were children

below the age of six.

The price we pay is the built-in racism our children are taught in

school, over television, in cartoons; the Indian has become a joise, to white

Anericans. We pay because we don't know our own history,

!

The thread of struggle for self-determination runs through the history

of Indian-Americans.

When a few Indian youth speak of Red Power, the roots go

deep into their history in

finding nourishment for this demand.

Just as some

Negro leaders today speak of W.E.B. DuBois as having raised the same issue of

identity long before the level of struggle, which is Black Power, arrived.

This struggle has gone on for 400 years.

The Indian people have been sending spokesmen to bring their grievances

and their positions before the power structure of this country for two hundred

They have fought in the courts since at least 1830 when the case of

the Cherokee Nation vs. Georgia tested the ability and the willingness of the

United States to protect an Indian Iribe in its efforts at self-determination.

The Vietnamese war is a continuation of the whole racist war we have

waged ajainst the Indian People. Understanding this is a part of understanding

the Viet Nam war.

We respond to what is happening to Vietnamese children, yet

the Indian people have suffered from the same policy of extermination and

destruction of their identity.

We must unite with the strivings of those who have had to deal with

United States' genocide for 200 years!

We can help io push the United States to ratify the United Nations

Resolution, "Ireaty Against Genocide", that the United States should correct

the history and policy of genicide against the Indian people.

Today this

refers to the destruction of their identity as a people and lintie with the

struggles of people for their identity all over the world. To stop the policy

of genocide, of racisin, to develop compensatory steps to undo the effects of

the crimes

Upon informing the Capitol Police of their planned march to the Capitcl building

to present their petition, the wmon were threatened with arrest wier 40 U.s.C.

193 (a) et. seg. which, after defining the area considered Capitol Grounds, states:

"It is forbidden to parade, stand, or move in processions

or assemblages in said United States Capitol Grounds, or to

display therein any flag, banner, or device designed or

adapted to bring into public notice any party, organization,,

or movement......

The statute further provides that exceptions from these prescriptive provisions

Will be made in the discretion of certain Congressional leaders and/or Capitol

Police.

The exceptions are allowed on "ocassions of national

interest becoming

the congnizance and entertainment of Congress."

The petition of the Jeannette Rankin Brigade apparently does not become "the

entertainment of Congress" and arrests were threatened. Therefore the suit which

was files prays for the convening of a three-judge Federal District Court which

is requested to enjoin the operation and enforcement of the statute and to •

declare it unconstitutional.

We have asked the Federal District Court for the

Districtof Columbia to grant us this relief on an emergency basis prior to

January 15tb. Our request was denied.

The same request was made to the District

of Columbia Court of Appeals and was likewise denied. As it was then impossible

to obtain relief prior to January 15th the Brigade's attorneys are continuing the

appeal on a non-emergency basis in the Court of Appeals and have every confidence

of ultimate victory.

This is far from the last time that these women of any other Americans intend

to appear in their nation's Capitol to petition their government. Hopefully this

will be the last time that they find it so difficult to do so.

Police.

The exceptio

are allowed on "ocassions of

tional interest becoming

• the congnizance and envertainment of Congress."

The petition of the Jeannette Rankin Brigade apparently does not become "the

entertainment of Congress" and arrests were threatened. Therefore the suit which

was files prays for the convening of a three-judge Federal District Court which

is requested to enjoin the operation and enforcement of the statute and to •

declare it unconstitutional.

We bave asked the Federal District Court for the

Districtof Columbia to grant us this relief on an emergency basis prior to

January 15th. Our request was denied.

Ine same request was made to the District

of Columbia Court of Appeals and was likewise denied. As it was then impossible

to obtain relief prior to January 15th the Brigade's attorneys are continuing the

appeal on a non-emergency basis in the Court of Appeals and have every confidence

of ultimate victory.

This is far fron the last

time that these women or any other Americans intend

to appear in their nation's Capitol to petition their government. Hopefully this

will be the last time that they find it so difficult to do so.

Tr 1937.

the Washington Legislature repealed the Erupors Low of 185iy and

enacted a State social security Law. "Welrore" has boen a bone of

contention ever since.

Greenleigh Report

In 1963, the Washington Legislature appropriated $20,000 for a study

of the state's public assistance programs.

The study was nade by

Greenleigh Associates, and the Greenleigh Report was presentod

Dacembar, 1964.

report stated that public assistance grants in

Washington, with standar s based on 1959 prices and

12% ratable reductions, 1? e 40% below the minimum

standards for health and decency. Speaking of child

welfare needs, the report sald: "There 1s an excessive

and increasing rate of referral of children to the

Juvenile Courts, both for dependency and delinquency.

There 1s an excessive and increasing trend for children

to be removed from their natural families and cared

for olsewhere."

WHAT ABOUT RATABLE REDUCIIONS?..

The 1965 Legislature removed the ratable reductions. The 196?

Legislature ordered the Dept. of Public Assistance to bring 1t's

pricing standard's up to 1967 levels.

New standards were put into effect July first. Increased allowances

for rent vary from county to county.

Other allowances were increased

an average of 10-3/4%aIn King County the total Increase was 16%.

Thus, King County grants have been increased by 28% since 1964,

but the cost of llving has increased by at least 5% Grants are st1l

17% less than acceptable levels.

The maximum grant for a Seattle family consisting of

two adules, a boy 13, and a girl o, 1s $205.80 a

nonth--$3,429 a year.

But recent changes in the

Federal Social Security Law cast a shadow on even

The local welfare officials will not

offer any guess as to what may happon nest.

NEW RATABLE

REDUCTIONS ARE ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY.

There is much talk of getting people off welfare by putting them to

work.

«CRES ACT FOK PEACE (SWAP)

A source reported on May 17, 1952, a meeting of the

Ballard-Greenwood CP Club was held in

Seattle, April 25, 1962,

at which TAIMI HALONEN was nominaïed to be the new Chairman of

this Club. Along with other business of the evening, HALONEN

said she expected to devote a good portion of her time to SWAP,

an organization of peace forces that met recently with seven

members.

She said four of the seven were from the "left" but

did not go into detail. She said the group had problems of an

organizational nature

because it was new, and she thought she

could help.

on April 5, 1963, a second source stated a meeting of

the University CP Club was held at Seattle on April 2, 1963.

KEN ROSE, a member of the Club, reported the most influential

peace organization in Seattle was SWAP.

on July 31, 1964, a meeting of the North Central CP

Section Committee was held at Seattle.

WILL PARRY, Section

Chairman, said attention should be placed

on three

political

questions - peace, civil rights, and labor. Under peace, he

said CP clubs shoula inject the

Women Act for Peace campaign

into the election campaign. At another Section meeting,

February 5, 1966, TAIMI HALONEN was praised for effective

peace work and for her help in developing unity among the peace

forces.

Section-wide concentration was urged in assisting

SWAP to visit 1,000 workers on the Vietnam

issue.

A third source advised on February 24, 1966, a

Northwest District CI Committee meeting was held at Seattle

February 12, 1966.

After lunch, the entire group participated

in passing

out leaflets pertaining to racial matters and the

Vietnam war which carried the name of SWAP, 5411 Ravenna Avenue

Northeast, Seattle, Washington 98105, which address has been

used consistently by SWAP and is that of ANCI kOPpEL, also known

as Mrs. CHARLES KOPPEL. KOPPEL has been and continues to be

the coordinator and apparent prime motivating force of SWAP

as of May, 1967.

A fourth source reported in 1945

ANCI KOPPEL waS a member of the

Professional Group of the Communist

Political Association (CPA), also

known as the Rogers CP Club at

Seattle, Washington.

The CPA has been designated by the

Party (CP), Northwest District

corruces at a meeting in

January, 1960, decided to prepare for opening a cooperative.

bookstore and directed the CP State Board to set up a Party

committee for this purpose:

The above source also reported that at a state-wide

CP conference held on August 27, 1960, CP District Chairman

BURT NELSON reported on the WCC.

NEISON announced the committee

was determined to have the bookstore opened by the earliest

possible date, probably October 15, (1960). He urged support

of the woo.

A second source in February and March, 1960, advised

a committee of CP members during those months commenced organi-

zation of the WCC with authorized capital of $2,000 which was.

to sell shares and make other plans for operation of a bookstore

selling "progressive" literature at Seattle.

In May and June,

1960, this source reported BURI NELSON, On May 18, 1960, stated

the CP District Literature Commission would concern itself with

the bookstore and other types of literature to be sold.

May 31, 1960, BURT NELSON suggested October 1, 1960, as the

tentative opening date of the bookstore.

A second source advised on November 2, 1960, the

principal aim of the WCC is to establish a bookstore in the

Seattle area inasmuch as this need has long been recognized by

the Washington State CP due to difficulties encountered in main-

taining a Party literature apparatus, and it is desired to have

available public facillties to attract supporters and sympathizers.

This source stated the WCC has obtained a location for its

bookstore at 710 Stevart Street, Seattle, and operations

commenced at that location on November 5, 1960.

A third source advised on May 1, 1967, that the wCC

held its annual meeting of shareholders at the Roosevelt Hotel,

Seattle, on April 30, 1907. As a pari

of the business at this

meeting, a report was made on the financial status of "co-op

The train arrived at Washington, D.C.,

at about

10:45 a.m. The group remained at Union Station, Washington,

for about an hour waiting for women arriving at the

station from other points, so that the march could begin.

When all were assembled, the group marched in orderly

fashion to Union Square near the Capitol. Prior to the march

it was announced that a small group of women would present

their petition to Congress,

Re San Francisco airtel and letterhead memorandum

to the Buneau, dated 1/16/68.

This matter was opened by the San Francisco

Office

on November 1?, 1967, on receipt of information from sr 1773-5

that an organization

known as the Jeannette Rankin Brigade had

sent out a call for a demonstration to be held at the White

House, Washington, D. C., on January 8, 1968, in protest of

the war in Vietnam.

As noted in referenced San Francisco

communication, the above efforts culminated in a demonstration

at Ser. Francisco, California, on January 15, 1968, and a companion

ciemonstration held in Washington, D. C., on January 15, 1968.

A review of the San Irancisco files in the above matter

reflects that NIKKI'BRIDGES, San Francisco Chairman of tha Seisque

was

on Manch 2, 1967, listed as a recipient of'a new yearly sub-

scription to

GOW/ sms :

On January 31, 1968, at a mectie of the Marin

Peace and Freedom

a general discussion concerning ine brigade, it vas felt

that the group did not want the Brigade to become another

formalized group, but rather keep the Brigade as a loose

organization, and as an umbrella group for the WILPF.

San Francisco files in addition reflect that:

there has not been at any time a known group of members

of the Brigade; rather the organization has been sponsored

by women on both a local and national level, many of whom

ano nembers of varied women's peace groups.

In view of the above information, indicating a lack

of specific membership and future activity, no further inves-

tigation is being conducted by the San Francisco Office under

the Jeannette Ranti: Iriguie caption at the present time, VACB.

This matter will be closely followed and should any

future information received by the San Francisco effice arzaar

to varrant additional investigation, this matter will be reopened.

advised that all information

which had been developed by that

agency regarding the Brigade was concerned directly with the

January march on Washington and the supporting local demonstration

in Chicago January 15, 1968. They had no knowledge that any

meetings or other activitios have boon hold subsequent to that

time andrare of

the opinion that the organization as a continuing

affair did not "get off the ground" in Chicago.

Information concerning the January demonstrations vas

received at that time from numerous Chicago informants.

and others in a position to learn of any subsequent activity were

alerted through frequent contacts and have advised they have no

knowledge of continuance of the Brigade as an active organization.

about the health of the people.

We march against the

organized crime, which makes

heroin a big business--silently endorsed by

those who

'govern us'.

to channel our frustration into a

public statement calling for

a women's march on Washington, D.C. on April 10.

We all felt

the urgency to show how we as

women feel oppressed by the same

U.S. system that needs the dominance of men over women, white

over black, brown and, yellow, heterosexual over homosexual, and

over poor to support the aggressive war policy that is killing

our Vietnamese sisters and brothers.------

"We are making this march one step in showing the

world our solidarity. as women with all our sisters in Vietnam

who are fighting for their lives. The Committee to Defend the

Right to Live, a South Vietnamese women's organization, has

called for our support."

there to arrange permits, speakers,

et cetera, for the womens march on the Pentagon on April 10,

for a march from the Justice Department to the Pentagon,

than Irom the pentagon to the Justice Department, but that

no permit had been obtained as yet.

It was pointed out that

a march from the pentagon to the Justice Department was

preferred as there would be less chance of losing marchers

en route to the Justice Department than from marching

from the Justice Department to the Pentagon. It was stated

that no buses had been chartered at NY, but it was hoped that

on September 16, 1909,

a second source, who

has furnished reliable information in the

past, advised that the Law Commune

is not an

organization in the usual sense of the word.

It is rather a law firm comprised of a group

of lawyers interested and sympathetic to the

New Left and Black Power organizations, and who

counsel and defend individuals in these groups

as the occasion arises.

place for these organizations and distribute

some of their literature.

on March 25, 1971, the second advised that as of

now there is much confusion

over the mechanical aspects of

the Women's National March on April 10, 1971, and that the

people in Washington, D.C. will make the ultimate decision

regarding the route of the march.

The source stated that

in NY, information concerning buses for washington, D.C.

will be available at the Upper west Side Women's Center,

627 Amsterdam Avenue, NYC, telephone number 874-6696.

on March 24, 1971, the second source made available

a piece of literature

sent out by the "April 10 Women's

Committee" concerning the national women's march on the

Pentagon on April 10. This literature contained in part as

follows:

"We are going to the pentagon on April 10 to

serve notice on our enemies that women are moving against

them.

Our urgency and our fury at the expansion of the

Indochinese war and our rage at the repression of our black

and brown sisters and brothers needs expression right now.

We are joining with other women to struggle for the everyday

things we need and against whatever and whoever prevents us

from getting them.

"We need and want our sisters around the country

to build for this action in their own ways, and to communicate

with other sisters their ideas,

suggestions and criticisms.

"Dear Mme. Binh,

"On April 10, many of us American women will be

marching on the Pentagon. You know already of the other

actions being planned here against the

war.

As women, we

are coming out from separate cities and roles, trying

create reality out of what we once held looked up in our

imaginations.

In marching on the pentagon, we are joining with

all people inside and outside of Amerika, who fight against

Amerika's attempt to control us.

"We've been conditioned so long to accept Amerika's

definition of us as weak, passive, and powerless, and to deny

all our feelings of love

and strength, that it has been a

struggle for us to turn towards each other and fight for our

freedom.

"Your own long struggle in Indochine, and

the struggle

of third world people here at home, awakened us to the

destruction that Amerikan power represents all over the world.

Your many victories against that power have been an inspiration

to us.

But it wasn't until we joined together to examine and

share

our own experiences as women in Amerika

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

Students for a Democratic Society, commonly

known as SDS, came into existence at a founding convention

held during June, 1962, at Port Huron, Michigan. From an

initial posture of "participatory democracy," Marxist-

• Leninist ideology of various shadings became predominant

during 1968-1969 with debate centering on how best to create

a revolutionary youth movement.

SDS moved from involvement

in the civil rights struggle to an anti-Vietnam war position

to advocacy of a militant anti-imperialist line linking up

the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America

with the black liberation movement in the United States.

All major factions within SDS embrace Marxism-Lenism

and identify internationally with China, Cuba and North

Vietnam as countries leading the worldwide struggles

against the United States.

However, the Soviet Union

was regarded as imperialist and with the Communist Party,

United States of America, "I-visionist" in nature.

SDS operated under a national constitution which

called for an annual Nationa. Convention (NC) and quarterly

National Council meetings wherein programs were initiated

and debated. Three national officers were elected

annually

with a National Interim Committee to run the organization.

Regional offices and college chapters elected delegates to

the national meetings but each functioned independently on

local matters.

Its official publicition "Fire" (formerly

"New Left Notes") last appeared in lecember, 1969.

Internal factionalism of serious proportions

developed during 1968 - 1969 and tie following three factions

evolved as a result of a split at he June, 1969, NC:

Weatherman, Worker Student Alliance (WSA), and Revolutionary

Youth Movement (RYM) •

effect of the split on SDS chapters

throughout the country was divisive.

Some aligned with one

of the other of the three major factions.

Others, unable to

identify with any faction, disassociated with SDS

completely

and changed names.

The SDS national office in recent years was

located at 1608 West Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois. It

was closed in February, 1970.

WEATHERMAN

A'PENDIX

-.

Initially called the "Action Faction," Weatherman

came into being inmediately before the June, 1969, Students

for a Democratic Society (SDS) National Convention (NC).

At this iC Weatherman won all. three national officer positions

and a majority of the National Interim Committee as well.

subsequently, they took over the SDS National Office (NO)

in Chicago, and controlled its funds, paper and national

records. Although internal struggle existed until late 1969,

weatherman for all major purposes controlled soS nationally

from June, 1969, until its 1:0 closed in rebruary, 1970. At

this time it no longer considered itself part of

SDS.

The term Weatherman emerged fron an ideological

paper prepared by its leaders entitled

"You Don't weed a

weatherman to know Which Way the Wind Blows" /"New Left

stance of Weatherman: Marxist-leninist in content but with

strong advocacy that

action not theory would bring about

revolution in the United States.

This posture was complemonted

with an international identification to

the Cuban revolution

and CASTRO's statement that the duty of a revolutionary is

to make revolution.

During October, 1969, Weatherman riots in

Chicago resulted in more than 260 arrests for nob action

anâ related charges.

A program of armed struggle was

finalized during a December, 1969, "War Council" wherein

terrorist tactics and political assassination were

contemplated.

The basic strength of Weatherman was then

revealed to be some 300 - 350 nationally and geographically

apportioned to the Midwest, New York, and some Northwest.

As its rhetoric of violence escalated, Weatherman

leaders increasingly discussed the necessity of

an underground

operation wherein more than 90 percent of the organization

would be submerged; "affinity groups" of three - five members

would function independently.

In February, 1970, Weatherman

leaders announced a program of "strategic sabotage" with

In

February, 1970, Heathernan abandoned

WORKER STUDENT ALLIANCE/

PROGRESSIVE LABOR PARTY

A source advised durig August, 1969, that at

the National Convention (NC) of Students for a Democratic

society (SDS) held in Chicago, Lilinois, during June, 1969,

) hexa in chicago,

a split arose between the Progressive Labor Party (PLP) ano

the National Office (NO), the N) becoming known as the

Weatherman faction.

The PLP fastion drew the largest

support among those in attendance at the NC.

Source further advisel that during late Summer,

1969, the PLP faction of SDS established its National

Headquarters (NH) on the second floor of a loft-type

building at 173A Massachusetts Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts.

The campaign on which the PLP faction

centered was to build

a worker student alliance or a sampus worker student

alliance. Thus, they adopted the names of Worker Student

Alliance (WSA) or Campus Worker Student Alliance.

Source stated that the "New Left Notes," printed

in New York City, is the official publication of the WSA

faction.

A second source advised during January,

1970,

that within the SDS, the WSA is a caucus of which the PLP

constitutes the leadership.

A third source advisel during July, 1970, that

during demonstrations staged ir the Boston area during the

Spring and Summer of 1970 by the NH, the main theme of

previous demonstrations staged

oy the NH shifted from

protestations of the Vietnam War and other United States

foreign policy matters to attac sing domestic issues such

as racism and unemployment and lemonstrating support of

the

"workers' struggle."

REVOLUTIONARY YOUTH MOVEMENT

A source advised that the Revolutionary Youth

Movement II (RYMII) faction of Students for a Democratic

Society (SDS) held a national conference at Atlanta, Georgia,

from November 26 to 30, 1969. At this conference it was

decided to form a new organization to be known as Revolutionary

Youth Movement (RYM), characterized as a mass anti-imperialist

youth organization, said organization being proposed rhe

separate and distinct in form and content from SDS.

"principles of Unity" adopted by the conference included a

struggle against white supremacy and male supremacy: fights

against imperialism, anticommunism, fascism and oppression

of youth; and support of the right of self-determination of

all "oppressed nations," also support of the right of all

"oppressed and exploited"

peoples "to armed self-defense."

It was agreed that RyM would not be a Marxist-Leninist

organization; however, source said this was decided in order

to indicate an organization broad enough in form to

be

acceptable to everyone. A temporary National Steering

Committee (NSC) made up of eight females and two males was

elected to govern RYM until national officers could be

Spring de%

elected during the Spring of 1970.

RYM publications have listed the RYM National Office

(NO) at Post Office Box 5421 and Post Office Box 77012 C,

both Atlanta, Georgia, and a second source has advised that

the NO has no office space but would probably be considered as

located at Apartment 27, 1067 Alta Avenue, Northeast, Atlanta.

Second source advised that women dominated the

founding conference and have continued to dominate NSC

meetings to the point that "women's liberation" has apparently

become the RYM's principal issue - also that RYM's poor

financial condition has resulted in its failure to publish

a paper.

During early 1970, RYM has decided to cater to

the working class rather than youth, since the potential for

social revolution lies in workers.

A third source has stated that it was decided at

the March, 1970, NSC meeting that RYM women had decided the

organization will be molded into a "working class, Marxist-

Leninist, revolutionary, anti-imperialist, problack

nationalist, people's women's liberation organization."

A characterization of the SDS

is set out separately.

Movement was founded in 1962, by MILTON ROSEN and MORTIMER

SCHEER after they were expelled from the Communist Party of

the United States for assertedly following the Chinese

Communist line."

According to information received from the Washington Field

Office and Domestic Intelligence Division, the y'April Tenth Women's Committee"

of New York City, a recently formed group of women's protest organizations,

plans a "'March on the Pentagon" on Saturday, 4/10/71, as an anti-war protest.

Plans call for the protesters, who may number as many as 5,000, to assemble

at L'Enfant Square, Constitution Avenue, between Seventh and Ninth Streets,

Northwest, between 11:00 a.m. and noon, and thereafter march to the Pentagon

via Constitution Avenue and Memorial Bridge. The demonstration is scheduled.

to end around 5:00 p.m. The Committee has reportedly chartered 14 busses

capable of carrying 630 passengers from New York City to Washingto. The

busses are scheduled to unload at the Justice Building, where it is reported the

women will demonstrate. It is noted that L'Enfant Square, the assembly point

for the demonstrators, is within one block of the Justice Building. The protesters

are then scheduled to march to the Pentagon, where they will hold another

demonstration and will be picked up by the busses at the Pentagon.

General Services Administration (GSA) and Department security

officials are cognizant and plan to reinforce the guard force at the Tenth Street

Auto Entrance, which is the only Justice Building entrance open on Saturday.

Since we do not conduct tours on Saturday, no adjustment in our tours is neces-

sary.

Boston file 100-38735 entitled "EVAN PATCHEN

DELLINGER, aka PATCH DELLINGER; SM - ANARCHIST (BUFILE

100-450998)" reflected that DELLINGER was subject of

Boston investigation based on his participation in a

"Teach-In"

and Rededication Service on 1/29/68 at the

Arlington St. Church, boston. During the above activity,

DELLINGER made a statement in support of the "Resistance

Group" and turned in what was reported to be Selective

Service cards.

The primary function of the Resistance Group

was to aid, abet, and counsel young men faced with the

draft.

EVAN PATCHEN DELLINGER graduated from Swarthmore

College, Swarthmore, Pa., on 6/6/66 majoring in economics.

He was arrested at Chester, Pa. on 4/1/54 and was charged

with disorderly conduct.

The 1968-59 Harvard University Directory of

Officers and Students reflected that DELLINGER was enrolled

in the School of Medicine, Harvard University, Cambridge,

Mass.

It had been reported that PATCH DELLINGER was

present at a Socialist Workers Party (SWP) Street Meeting

in New York City on 7/21/64.

The file further disclosed that inasmuch as the

Boston office had no current information associating DELLIN-

GER with the SWP or the Young Socialist Alliance and that:

his activities on behalf of the New England Resistance were

pacifist in nature, it was felt that DELLINGER did not

warrant inclusion on the Security or Agitator Indexes main-

tained at that time; and thus, the case was placed in a closed

status.

based on his participation in the previously mentioned

Rededication Services at the Arlington St. Church in Boston

on 1/29/68 at which 23 individuals turned in either a

Notice of Classification and/or a Registration Certificate.

Two other individuals turned in some other type of document.

It was determined that DELLINGER had turned in a Selective

Service Registration Certificate and two Notices of Classi-

fication issued by LB #28, Flemington, New Jersey. Also,

a two-page statement signed PAICHEN DELLINGER supporting

the Resistance movement was turned in.

In April, 1972, AUSA, Boston declined any prosecu-.

On 8/21/72, personnel of the Office of the Mass.

SUBJECT: DEMONSTRATIONS, WASHINGTON, D. C., AND

SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, NOVEMBER 20, 1971,

SPONSORED BY THE WOMEN'S NATIONAL ABORTION

ACTION COALITION.....

This memorandum advises of demonstrations being scheduled in

Washington, D. C., and San Francisco, California, on 11/20/71 to build

public support for the repeal of antiabortion laws.

The Women's National Abortion Action Coalition was formed at a

conference held at Columbia University, New York City, in July, 1971, which

was attended by approximately 1, 000 women from 29 states. The conference

voted to make a woman's right to abortion a national and political issue.

Subsequent to its formation, the coalition called for demonstrations in

San Francisco and Washington on 11/20/71 to build public support for the

repeal of all antiabortion laws, to protest forced sterilization, and to call

for an end to restrictive contraceptive laws. A source of the Washington

Field Office has advised that the march in Washington is supported by the

: Young Socialist Alliance, the youth group of the Socialist Workers Party

(SWP). Carol Lipman, who is a member of the SWP, is Project Director

of the Washington march.

D.C

Coalition leaders in requesting permit for the demonstration have

jestimated that participation in the Washington march will range between

/10, 000 and 20, 000 persons. The Washington Field Office has developed

information that 46 buses have been chartered to bring participants to the

demonstration. Participants will represent some 80 cities. The Metropolitan

Police Department anticipates participation will be in the vicinity of 5,000 person:

REC-23.

Demonstrators are scheduled to assemble at the Ellipse between

¡ 10 a.m. and 12 noon and will march via 17th Street to H Street, dowl H Street

¡ to 15th Street, down 15th Street to Pennsylvania Avenue, and then easton

Pennsylvania Avenue to the west steps of the Capitol. A rally will be held

at the latter site between 2 and 6 p.m.

LOOMINGTON. ABORTION COALITION

...--

As. the youth organization of the Socialist Workers

Party (SWP), the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA) serves

ag the main source of recruitment into that organization.

The YSA is described in the masthead of its official

publication, "The Young Socialist Organizer," as "A

multinational revolutionary socialist youth organization."

The SWP has been designated pursuant to Executive

Order 10450.

On November 18, 1971, the confidential source listea

above and a second confidential source who has furnished

"reliable information in

the past advised approximately. 15

individuals would be attending the demonstration in

washington, D. C., from Indiana University, Bloomington,

Indiana.

The individuals traveling were to represent tha

BAC headed by Paula Savich, Chairwoman and YSA member.

Included in those scheduled to travel were approximately five

or six members of the YSA from Indiana University and plans

were for individuals to travel in two Ford Econoline vans

rented from U-Haul,. Bloomington, Indiana. ' Original plans had

called for a bus to be chartered; however, the lack of

individuals signing up to attend the demonstration resulted in.

the cancellation of tha bus:

On November 16, 1971, an article entitled "Abortion

Repeal March Plans Set"

appeared on page 12 of the "Indiana

Daily Student", a local cannua daily newbager. The article

indicated approximately 40 student, were to travel to

Washington, D. C., and that Student Body President Mary Scifres

had been invited by the WONAAC to speak at a rally on the

Capitol steos in Washington, D. C. According to the article,

Seifres had not: decided whether or not to accept the

invitation. Paula Savich; Chairwoman for the local comnittee,

according to the article, stated,

"It is important that this

march be really big"

She indicated that they were taking

reservations for the bus trip to washington.

On November 24, 1971, the first confidential source

mentioned above advised that the BAC in Wakington, D. C.;

participated in the demon-tations as scheduled.

The article stated that less

than the forty students who had been expected to attend the

demonstration actually attended.

The article indicated that

the large number of persons expected to attend the

Washington, D. C., demonstration from all over the country

did not materialize.

The article. also stated that student

Body President Mary Seifres, who had had to decline an

invitation by the demonstration sponsors to abeak at the

march because of obligations at Indiana University, preparea

a statement to be read.

Her statement and several

other

statements, however;

ware not read because of the lack of time

due to frequent breakdown of gound equipment delaying speeches.

According to

the article, Paula Savich had expected a better turn-

out from Indiana University..

On January 17, 1972, the second confidential source

mentioned. above advised that the BAC was not currently active.

and

that it was not expacted to be active in the near future

unless other demonstrations such as the demonstration held in

Washington, D. C., on November 20, 1971, called for support

RE:

WOMEN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE OF MARYLAND

INTERNAL SECURITY - COMMUNIST

(TROTSKYIST)

minus initidnt siter

On November 13, 1971, a source advised that the

Women's National Abortion Coalition (WONAAC) planned to

hold demonstrations at Washington, D. C. and San Francisco,

california on November 20, 1971.

The purpose of the

demonstrations were to call for

the repeal of all abortion,

contraception and forced sterilization laws.

The" Women's

Right to Choose of Maryland, the Baltimore, Maryland

affiliate of WONAAC was to organize busing and housing

arrangements for out-of-state women.

On November 22, 1971, a source advised that the

Women's Right to Choose of Maryland, working from 3028

Greenmout Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland, were unsuccessful

in attempts to generate enthusiasm for the WONNAC demonstration

among Baltimore area women.

Therefore, the plan to charter

a bus for the purpose of transporting

• demonstrators to the

Washington, D. C. rally was cancelled.

On November 30, 1971, a second source advised

that the Women's Right to Choose of Maryland had been

formed as an

"ad hoc" group for the specific purpose of

supporting the November 20, 1971 Washington, D. C. demonstra-

tion. The source furiner stated unau the women's Right

to Choose of Maryland ceased to exist, following this

demonstration, and is now efunct.

On February 18, 1972, source, who has furnished

information:

A Women's National Abortion Action Coalition

(WONAAC) Convention was held on the Boston University campus,

Boston, Massachusetts, during the period of February 11 -

13, 1972.

Approximately 1,000 persons were in attendance

at this convention which was held to determine future action

Of WONAAC and to allow diverse factions within the Women's

Abortion Movement to join ranks under one issue.

Female members of the Socialist Workers Party (57P)

and Young Socialist Alliance (YSA) fron all over the county

were requested by the national office of the SWP and YSA

to attend this convention in order to insure the effective

control of the convention by the SWe.

forkers the youth organization of the socialist

Party (SHP), the Young Socialist Alliance.

(ISA) serves as the

main source of recruitment

into that organization.

The YSA is described

in the masthead of Its official publication,

"The Young Socialist Organizer

‚" as "A multi-

national revolutionary socialist youth organi-

zation,"

The SWP has been designated pursuant to

Executive Order 10450.

Re: WONAAC

The SWP specifically wished the convention to

adopt a one-issue position, that being the complete

control of the fenale

body by the individual female.

This specific issue,

"women control their bodies" was

adopted by the women's organizati on and all other propo-

sals were rejected.

Workshops were organized for each of the many

separate racial and ethnis groups represented at the

conference.

Workshops were based on appeal to the speci-

fic group intended and all were supposedly controlled by

the SVP.

A Black, Raza, Asian-American women's workshop

was held on February 12, 1972, with 35 persons attending.

Among the issues discussed at

the workshop were the

attempts of democratic and republican presidential candi-

dates to capitalize on minority group attitudes in regard

to the abortion movement and the fact that minority groups

all to often find themselves without a voice when real

issues are involved.

of particular importance to the group was the

La Raza Unida

Party, a legitimate political party in Texas

equal impor-

tance was the Gay Liberation movement, which the group

nore of serian вocot.

felt expresses the plight of gay females who do not want

children and are forced to live with men because of the

Attendees agreed that the one issue of abortion

law. repeal will serve to unite women under one banner and

more effectively serre

the woren's Movement.

The convention adjourned after an

agreement that

an "Abortion Action Week" would be held May 1 - 6, 1972.

This action would serve to keep public attention focused

on the need to legalize abortion and to seek effective

support from

the many thousands of women who want to right

to choose.

II. ACTIVITIES

A. Conferences and Demonstrations •

1. WONAAC Founding Conference was held in New York

City, New York, July 16-18, 1971.

This conference called for

on gordon aston Cal formal, ront the theme of ironel

(WF I-1, 7/21/71)

a. On November 20, 1971, approximately 1,500 romen,

representing womens liberation grouds from the East

Coast and

Mid-West, gathered on the Ellide in TDC, in response to the

call by WONAAC to march on the United States Capitol to demand

the redeal of all abortion laws. This grouD dearted the

Ellipse at approximately 10:30 a.m. on that date and marched

along Pennsylvania Avende, M.W., to tue rest side of lie Capitol

Building.

There the marchers assembled for a. rally which

concluded at approximately 4:00 p.m. on the same date. There

were no incidents of violence and the march and rally were

Deaceful throughout.

(WF I-1, 11/23/71)

b. On January 13, 1972, & WONAAC sponsored demonstra-

tion was held from 4:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.M. in the vicinity of

## Page 734

WFO 100-55420

and the demonstration ended without incident.

(Physical observation, Special

Agents, FBI, 1/13/72)

2. Second WONAAC Conference was held in Boston,

Massachusetts,

February 11-13, 1972. Approximately 1,300

women attended the conference, which once again re-established

and reiterated WONAAC's call for abortion on demand.

It was

noted during the conference that WONAAC had been unable to

create anything like a national campaign and that local meetings

across the country had been disadpointingly small. It was

pointed out that WONAAC had failed to attract the large numbers

of working women, housewives, and students concerned with the

abortion issue, including the majority of women's liberationists

and abortion reform activists. It was felt that the movement

could not succeed without the support of the working women.

At the close of the conference, WONAAC strongly endorsed

the "Abortion Rights Act of 1972," walch is to be introduced in

the U. S. Congress by Congresswoman BELLA ABZUG From New York.

This bill would override all laws which impose sanctions upon''

those who choose to exercise their individual right to an abortion.

(WE I-1, 2/14/72)

a. Proposed Actions

It was moved and adopted during the above conference

that WONAAC sponsor a week of local abortion activities, May 1-6,

1972, consisting of educational programs, legislative

support,

judicial action, and culminating

• in local

or regional demonstra-

tions on May 6, 1972, around the demand for redeal of all anti-

abortion laws and restrictive contraception laws and an end to

forced sterilization.

(WF I-1, 2/14/72)

In addition, the following secondary pronosals were

adopted during the conference:

NW 88321 Docld:32989545 Page 137

## Page 735

CONFIDENTIAL

WFO 100-55420

1. That a telegram be sent to the New York

State Court of Appeals and New York Governor

NELSON A. ROCKEFELLER, condemning the court's

February 10, 1972, decision denying women on

Medicaid

the right to abortions on demand.

2. That the coalition continue to organize black,

Puerto Rican, Chicano, native American and Asian

American participation in their activities.

3. That members of local coalitions confront

candidates for office and force them to take a

stand on abortion, and that they publicize those

who oppose abortion so that the voters can see

where these politicians stand.

4. That the coalition make a special effort to

reach out to

and involve "gay" women in their

activities.

(WF I-1, 2/14/72) 1

YSA and SWP members of WONAAC felt the conference to

be a success in that opposition proposals submitted were turned

down

in favor of those proposals backed by the YSA-SWP women.

REWFOReD OF SA ARLAND A. NOSEL, 3122/92066

For the information of the Bureau and New York,

sainesville,

Florida, which recently sponsored an

Abortion Action Week

rally, however, none of the

individuals associated with this Women's Lib group are

connected

with any subversive organizations such as

Young Socialist Alliance or Socialist Workers Party.

They are merely Women's Liberationists, who support

the repeal of

all abortion laws.

In view of the above, no active investigation

is being conducted by the Jacksonville Division of the

Nomen's Liberation group at the University of Florida, as

there is no present indication they are connected and/or

interested in subversive activities.

and the University at Binghamton has an enrollment of

approximately 7,500

students.

The student newspaper

published at the University twice weekly during the school

year in its issue of 10/15/71 carried a brief ad in the

classified section as follows:

"Women who have had abortions needed to relate

their experiences to other women, educate all women

about abortion at abortion speak out October 21. Contact

Linda L., extention 4130."

The 11/12/71, issue of the "Pipedream", student

newspaper published at the State University 'of New York

at Binghamton, carries an announcement that the Binghamton

Womens Abortion Coalition was selling bus tickets. for the

Womens March on Washington for repeal of all abortion laws,

repeal of all contraception laws and no force sterilization

for 11/20/71. Women and men were invited to attend and

tickets were on sale at the student center.

Cars and

volunteers were needed and they were to contact LINDA LOEW

at extention 4129.

Former At 3487-PSI, who is familiar with New

Left activities on the campus of the State University of

New York at Binghamton was contacted regularly during the

school year of 1971-72 and he stated that he id see

This source was contacted 5/16/72. He stated

also at that time that LINDA LOEW has been a close

associate of BETTY, SACHS who is the leader of the Young

Socialist Alliance Chapter on campus at the University.

Informant stated that there was no organization formed

his knowledge of a Womens Abortion Action Coalition in

the Binghamton area.

Other sources familiar with New Left activities

on the campus of the State University of New York at

Binghamton, were contacted during May, 1972, and two

sources advised that they knew of no organization of

Womens Abortion Action Coalition on the campus or in the

Binghamton vicinity during the past year.

Albany Division has had an investigation pending

on LINDA LOEW and a report is being written with appropriate

recommendation for administrative action on LINDA LOEW.

In view of the lack of activity of an Abortion Coalition

organization in the Binghamton area, no further investigation

is being conducted by Albany.

I. ORGANIZATION

A. Origin and Objectives

The Boston Women's Abortion Action Coalition

(BOWAAC), the local affiliate of the Women's National

BS T-1

November 17, 1971

BONAC was originally a subconmittee of FL

in the Greater Boston

Area but as of January, 1972, had

grown into a separete group whose specific interest was

in abortion reform. Individuals active in BOWAAC are

also active in other FL work; however, all individuals

active in FI work are not active in BOWAAC, with BOWAAC

being the smaller of the two groups.

2S T-1

January 12, 1972

WONAAC has been pubiioly described

as an organization of groups whose

a im

is to effect the overthrow of existing

abortion laws and to establish free

abortion on demand.

in Boston, in its February 13, 1972 edition, carried an

article entitled "Abortion Strategy Discussed" which in

part reported that more than 800 women from accoss the

country had gathered for a confarence at Boston University

the weekend of February 11-13, 1972 to plan a strategy

to win repeal of all laws that prohibit abortion.

Accord-

ing to the article, it was expected that the conference

would endorse the latest Federal bill to nullify all

state laws restricting abortion. "The Abortion Rights

AcE of 1972"

, to be introduced by United States Congress-

WOman BELLA ABZUG from New York.

YOU CANNOT HAVE

Women must use their minds, their voices, and

their bodies to stop the killing in Vietnam; to do

less is to ignore our special responsibilities to

the human race.

"10, 000 women have sat back and let their sons

be killed in Vietnam. If we had 10, 000 women

willing to go to jail if necessary we could stop

the war in Vietnam. You cannot have wars with-

out women. "

Jeannette Rankin made the above statement in

May of this year. Fifty years ago, as the first

woman elected to Congress, she voted against

World War I. She has consistently maintained

her struggle for peace, and at 86 she is as coura.

geous and vigorous as ever--an inspiration to all

women.

The presence of the United States forces in the in

ernal struggle of Vietnam is immoral and illegal.

There can be no possible justification for our inte

ference in the domestic affairs of this tiny distant

land.

This 86-year-old woman has stated that she is wi

all women are free to join her, but we can assure

her that thousands of women will march peacefull

beside her. Some will picket, others will go to ja

organizational nature because it was new, and she thought she

could help.

On April 5, 1963, a second source stated a meeting of

the university CP Club was

held at Seattle on April z, 1963.

KEN ROSE, a member of the Club, reported the most influential

as Vivian Hallinan, the wife of Vincent Hallinan who was

identified in 1966

as the Treasurer for the American Institute

of Marxist Studies, a communist front organization.

The above information has been furnished to the

White House, the Department of State, the Attorney General

and military intelligence.

In view of the Bureau's responsibility to identify

subversive elements which may participate in the demonstration

sponsored by this group and to keep the White House and other

agencies advised of developments, it is felt that the field

should be notified of the proposed demonstration and furnished

with instructions for handling information concerning it,

including the need for informant coverage of participating

groups.

BRIGADE FORMED TO CONFRONT CONGRESS

Helena, Montana

November 27, 1967

To all American Women:

I ain proud of the fact that my first

vote cast in Congress was a vote

against war.

It was the first oppor-

unity for a woman to vote, because I

was the first woman to be elected to

Congress.

I believed then, as I do today,

that women are the

ones that must be

concerned with the needs and develop-

ment of the human race.

I have always

fought for the dignity of all human

beings - for those of the present as

well as those of future generations.

I will continue to struggle as long

as I live. I hope all women will res-

pond to the following call and join me

in Washington on January 8, 1968, the

opening day of Congress.

Jeannette Rankin

A CALL TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN who

are outraged by the ruthless slaughter

in Vietnam and the persistent neglect

of human needs at home TO COME TO

WASHINGTON ON JANUARY 8

AMERICAN WOMEN represent 51% of the

Demonstrate it to the Congress of the

United States! Come to Washington on

January 8 as Congress opens in joint

session.

Support Jeannette Rankin as

she leads a representative delegation

of American women to the Capitol to

demand that:

*Congress, as its first order

of business, resolve to end

the war in Victnam and imnedi-

ately arrange for the with-

drawal of all American troops.

*Congress use its power to make

reparations for the ravaged land

we leave behind in Vietnam.

*Congress listen to what the

American people are saying and

refuse the insatiable demands of

the military-industrial complex.

WOMEN OF AMERICA, our power is un-

limited. On January 8, American women

will:

*PETITION the United States Con-

gress

*CONVENE a Congress of American

Women that afternoon to develop

programs to meet the crisis in

America - programs which will

express our political power,

reason and conscience.

every American. This is woman power!

Angeles). She has formerly been a member of the American

Federation of Radio and Television Artists, and is currently

a member in good standing with the Screen Actors Guild,

Hollywood, her dues being paid through May 1, 1968.

According to source One, the Southern California

Council of WSP 1s presently coordinating local activity to

form a contingent of the JRB from Southern California.

They

are making office space and telephones in their Los Angeles

headquarters, 5899 West Piço Boulevard, Los Angeles available

for this purpose.

Spearheading the local committee are

Mary Clarke and Eva Korn, both uf whom are active in WSP.

Mary Clarke is currently

a member of the JRE's National Steer-

ing Committee.

Source Three reported during November 1947, that

Eva Korn was a member of the Los Angeles County

Communist Party (ASCCP) during the years 1946

and 1947.

JRB, the local WSP office is circulating a reprint from the

Rankin Brigade should be made up of only those women who

volunteer to participate with the prior understanding that

they should be ready to spend at least two months in jail

for the commission of civil disobedience while in

washington,

D.: C.

Sunderland also suggested that a good way to recruit

women to join the Brigade would be, to make a pitch. for

recruits when Mary Clarke, Dagmar Wilson and Ruth Krause

• are making their respective speaking engagements across the

United States since their return from a trip to North Vietnam,

which they visited as representatives of WSF during the d

fall of 1957.

Source Four advised during the summer of 1965

that June Sunderland, 3730 Hollister Avenue,

Santa Barbara, California, had attended a 1967

"peace conference" In Helsinki, Finland, at the

Invitation of the Communist Party (CP),

and that

funds to cover her expenses were raised in part

by the CP; and that following her attendance at

the Helsinki affair she went on to Russia for ten

days at the invitation and expense of the Soviet

Government.

Source One learned that a communication was re

ceived from eastern sponsors of the JRB on December 7, 1967,

Indicating that the JRB march on Washington might not

held on January 8, 1968, but possibly would be set back until

either the 15th or 22nd of January 1968, depending upon

the date that the United States. Congress would reconvene.

The communication indicated that since the entire purpose

of the Brigade would be to confront the opening joint session

of Congress that it would be futile to schedule the march

prior to the date Congress would reconvene.

The suggestion

was made that recruitment of local women to participate in

the uRB be held in abeyance until a conficmation had been

obtained indicating the date on which Congress would reconvene.

Source One, had Indicated that although the "Call"

as reproduced in "La

actions across the country at the same time as the action

February 5, 1966, TAIMI HALONEN was praised for effective

peace work and for her help in developing unity among the peace

forces.

Section-wide concentration was urged in assisting

SWAP to visit 1,000 workers on the Vietnam issue.

A third source advised on February 24, 1966; a

WOMEN FOR PEACE aka

Women Strike for Peace

The "Berkeley Daily Gazette," a daily newspaper of

general circulation published in Berkeley, California,

contained an article in the November 19, 1965, evening

edition reflecting that in November, 1961, when con-

cern mounted over radioactive fallout from nuclear

testing, a group of women in washington, D. C. started

Women Strike for Peace.

The idea spread rapidly through-

out the country and now embraces 900 groups, including

Women For Peace groups in the San Francisco Bay area.

These groups support programs to achieve goals such as:

(1) Continued disarmament negotiations.

(2) A strong and flexible United Nations.

(3)

Planning now at state

and national levels for

conversion to peace-time economy and positive

efforts to ease world tensions.

The women act as individuals and as a group, with specific

actions suggested by individuals and groups

from all over

the world.

Decision to participate jointly on any given

suggestion is democratly arrived at by members of the Co-

ordinating Committee.

Effective cooperation with other

peace groups is encouraged. Monthly Coordinating Comnittee

meetings aid general meetings, as warranted, ara open to

all and annunced in nailings to nemoers.

There are no

dues or membership forms nor conditions for membership.

To stir an awareness of the need for peace, Women For

Peace encourage public education in peace objectives at

local schools and sponsor peace-oriented demonstrations

the graup attempts to influence government officials

by letters and conferences.

TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN,

I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress

was a vote against war. It was the first opportunity for a

woman to vote because I was the first woman to be elected

to Congress.

I believed then as I do today that women are the ones who

must be concerned with the needs and development of the

human race, I have always fought for the dignity of all

human beings - for those of the present as well as those

of future generations.

I will continue to struggle as long as I live.

I hope all women will respond to the following CALL, and

join me in Washington on January 8, 1968, the ppening

Women must use their rinds, their voices, and

You cannot have wars without ronsn."

Jeannette Rankin made the above statement in

May of this year.

Fifty years ago, as the first

woman elected to Congress, she voted against World

Far I. She has consistently maintained her strug-

Ele for peace, and at 8e she is as courageous and

vigorous as ever - an inspiration to all women.

The presence of the United States forces in

the internal struggle of Vietnam is immoral and

1llegal. There can be no possible justification

for our interference in the domestic affairs of

this tiny distant land.

This 86-yeax-old woman has stated that she

is willing to stay in jail until the bombing is

stopped.

Not all women are free to join her, but

we can assure ner that thousanas of women will

march peacefully beside her.

Some will picket,

others will go to jail until bail is arranged,

and others will stay in jail with Hiss Rankin.

Every woman's perticipation is eoually valuable.

Dear Friend:

We are sending this letter to you and others from whom we have not heard much

recently, in the hope of re-enlisting your efforts in the Women for Peace

movement.

It has been too long since we last heard directly from many of you,

and our meetings with those of you whom we have seen recently have been brief.

Of course, we know the paralyzing sense of frustration we all feel occasionally,

as ie learn of the mounting horrors in Victnam. But this feeling is only

temporary, and quickly gives way to activity.

As women, we bear the major

responsibility for the preservation of life, and thus a major responsibility

in the peace movement.

Enclosed you will find an announcement of the latest national women's effort

for peace.

Several peace groups in Portland are cooperating in raising funds

to send representatives to lashington. He hope that you will also support this

effort, to insure representation from Portland Women for Peace.

The coupon

on the enclosed notice is for your use in this effort.

In addition, we will have a supportive peaceful demonstration

in Portland at

To all American Women:

GSNFIDENTIAL

I an proud of the fact that my first vove cast in Congress was a vote against war.

It was the first opportunity for a woman to vote; because I was the first woman:

to be clected to Congress.

I believed then, as I do today, that women are the ones that must be concerned

with the

needs, and, development of the human race.

I have always fought for the

dimity of all human boings -- for those of the présent as well as those of future

generations..

I will continue to struggle as long as I live. I hope all women will respond to

as ive learn of the mounting horrors in Vietnam.

But this feeling is only

temporary, and quickly gives way to activity.

is women, we bear the major

responsibility for the preservation of life, and thus a major responsibility

in the peace movement,

Inclosed you will find an announcement of the latest national women's effort

for peace.

Several peace groups in Portland are cooperating in raising funds

to send representatives to Washington.

We hope that you will also support this

effort, to insure representation from Portland Women for Peace.

enclosed notice is for your use in this effort.

In addition, we will have a supportive peaceful demonstration

of the United States Capitol Police on January 2, 1968,

concerning details of the proposed demonstration.

These

individuals were advised by the United States Capitol Police

that they cannot demonstrate on the Capitol grounds in

a group or carcy placards, as such activity is prohibited

by rules of Congress.

Forer, as attorney fos the group,

advised the officials that these women will be coming to

the Capitol as individuals and although they will be walking

together they

can only be kept out of the Capitol building

if the police

exclude

Forer argued that such a demonstration on the

participants but a violation of the United States Government

in refusing to allow its citizens to present their grievances

to Congress,

Captain Krahling advised that in addition to

Joseph Foxer,

CHICAGO COUNCIL OF AMERICAN-SOVIET

TOLATIONS, Formerly known as Chicago

council of American-Soviet Friendship

EDWIN GORDON FOX, 7147 Jeffrey Avenue, Chicago,

Illinois, (now deceased) made available in January, 1954,

the

"First Annual Report CCASF," an undated

publication which

stated that the Chicago Council of American-Soviet Friendship

(CCASF) was incorporated in July, 1943.

This document stated,

"The Council's affiliation with the National Council of

American-Soviet Friendship (NCASF) was validated August 11,

(1943). The present name was adopted to conform to standard

national practice.

It should be noted, however, that the

Chicago Council is entirely autonomous; the government of its

affairs rests exclusively in the hands of its Chicago Executive

Board,"

On April 8, 1965, a source furnished information to

the effect that as of March 11, 1965, this organization would

be known as the Chicago Council

of American-Soviet Relations

(CCASR) • MANDEL TERMAN continued to be listed as Chairman of

the new organization.

During April, 1965, a second source advised that

MANDEL TERMAN had

arbitrarily dissolved the Board of Directors,

assumed all financial and other functions of the organization,

and

was maintaining existing records of the organization at

his residence, 660 West Irving Park Road, Chicago, Illinois.

The aims and purposes of this organization continued to be

to work for peaceful coexistence and friendship with the USSR.

While it claimed to be an autonomous organization, its program

followed the NCASf and it was in frequent contact with the

NCASF.

On November 5, 1958, a third source advised that in

the early 1940s, MANDEL TERMAN was a member-at-large of the

Communist Party (CP) 0f Illinois. TERMAN was in Russia in

November, 1958, where he had gone to discuss the treatment of

Jews and to discuss Jewish culture in the USSR with the

leadership of the Soviet Union.

The offices ci the

CCASR, formerly located at 32 West Randolph Street, Chicago,

were for a short time carried at HANDEL TERMAN's home resi-

dence,

660 West Irving Park Road,

Chicago.

During the Fall

of 1965 due to the defunctness of the CCASh, the CP of Illinois

found it necessary to sponsor a rally honoring the 48th

anniversary of the

Russian Revolutio, under a temporary

committee called "The Chicago Committee for American-Soviet

Friendship Rally," This rally was held on November 7, 1965,

and once the rally was

held this temporary committee went

out of existence.

The fourth

source advised that as of the present

time the CCASR is delunet in the Chicago area and any future

rally to be held on the American-soviet friendship theme will

have to be organized by the CP of Illinois on a temporary

basis.

The NCASE ins been

desirated pursuant to Executive

Order 10450.

..

TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN,

• ... •..

I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress

was a vote against war. It was the first opportunity for a

woman to vote because I was the first woman to be elected

to Congress.

I believed then as I do today that women are the ones who

must be concerned with the needs and development of the

human race. I have always fought for the dignity of all

human beings - for those of the present as well as those

of future generations.

I will continue to struggle as long as I live.

I hope all women will respond to the following CALL, and

join me in Washington on January 8, 1968, the opening

day of Congress.

With highest hopes,

A CALL

TO AMERICAN WOMEN

who are outraged by the ruthless slaughter in Vietnam

and the persistent neglect of human needs at home

TO COME TO WASHINGTON JANUARY 15. & 16

AMERICAN WOMEN constitute 51% of the voting population, yet a high percentage of us don't vote. •

It is time forewomen to break out of their societal molds and take their place as effective, vocal citi-

zens. WOMEN CAN ELECT the President they want; Women can determine the political, social and

economic direction of the nation. WE HAVE WOMEN POWER. Let's use it to demonstrate our

opposition to this war to the Congress of the United States.

We are a broad coalition of women from many areas of American life. We shall meet in Washington

on January 15 for the opening of Congress to demand the following:

1. CONGRESS, AS ITS FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS, RESOLVE TO END THE

WAR IN VIETNAM AND IMMEDIATELY ARRANGE FOR THE WITHDRAWAL

OF ALL AMERICAN TROOPS.

2. CONGRESS USE ITS POWER TO HEAL A SICK SOCIETY AT HOME.

ri

CONGRESS USE ITS POWER TO MAKE REPARATION FOR THE RAVAGED

LAND WE LEAVE BEHIND IN VIETNAM.

4. CONGRESS LISTEN TO WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SAYING AND

REFUSE THE INSATIABLE DEMANDS OF THE MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL

COMPLEX.

After we petition the United States Congress, we will hold our own congress to articulate our position

on the basic problem of achieving peace. We declare our intention to return to our communities and

mobilize women to dedicate ourselves to reshaping American society, and restoring our country to a

position of honor in the community of nations.

On January 15, we will meet at the Union Depot in Washington, D.C., at 11:30 A.M., and walk behind

our delegation which will present our petition to the U.S. Congress.

On January 16, many of us will stay in Washington to begin implementation of these demands by

presenting them to our Congressmen and Senators. We hope you can stay.

Re New York letter to the Bureau, 6/6/72; Bureau 0-7

to New York, 1/12/72; and Philadelphia letter to the Bureau,

2/28/73.

As outlined in referenced New York letter, the

New York Office noted, as far back as June, 1972, it

recognized that, although several leaders

of WONAAC were

known to be SWP members,

their activities, as pertaining

to

"ONAAC, had been directed tora the legal

repeal of all

restrictive abortion laws, and investigation had disclosed

no indication that WONAAC, as an organization, had engaged in

any subversive or vidence

prone activity.

Referenced Bureau O-7, referencing the aforementioned

as office of origin, had overall responsibility for captioned

case and submit semi-annual reports.

A review of the results of the continuing investigation

Of WONAAC, together with all indices and references pertaining

thereto, since dune t912, reflects no apparent change in the

activities or the organization o its membership from that

outlined above.

The New York Office Is in accord with the view of the

Philadelphia Division, as set forth in its referenced letter,

that WONAAC represents basically a social change vehicle which,

despite disparate political views of its leaders and membership,

deals with the single issue of abortion rights!

Re :

National Women's Political Caucus (NNPC)

Policy Council Meeting

Source, who has furnished reliable information in the

past, provided the following information on July 3, 1972:

A POliCy Council. Meeting of the National Women's

Political Caucus

(NVPC) was held in Washington, D.C. during

the period June 24, 1972 - June 25, 1972.

The NWPC is a legitimate, loosely-knit, open

organization of politically motivated women

seeking equal recognition

in the American

community.

During the Policy Council. Meeting there were no

overt attempts by any organized aroup to influence the policy

meeting and there were no individuals present who identified

themselves as members of any organization which might be construed

as subversive and/o supporting any cause except legitimate

change.

Of

significance, however, was the fact that literature

of the Women's National

Abortion Action Coalition (WONAAC) was

present in brochures and pamphlets located throughout the meeting

area.

All of the WONAAC material was geared to the abortion

movement and specifically the WONAAC conference scheduled for

Hunter College, New York, July 15 - 16, 1972..

WONAAC was founded in July, 1971. for the purpose of

forming a national movement of groups scattered

throughout the United States who favor and

now work to legalize abortion.

The Young Socialist

AdLlance lIsA and Socialist Workers Party (SWP)

are playing a major role in toNAAC.

The SWp has been designated pursuant to

Executive Order 10450.

Re:

NVPC Policy Council Meeting

As the youth organization of the SWP, the

YSA serves as the main source of recruitment into

that organization.

The YSA is described in the

masthead of its official publication, "The Young

Socialist Organizer:" as

"a multinational

revolutionary socialist youth organization."

During the council meeting on June 21, 1972, Mary

Clarke, who is associated with the Southern California WPC,

an affiliate of the NWPC: advised a group of policy council

members that WONAAC had been using the Southern California WPC

name as an endorser of WONAAC. Clarke also stated that MONAAC

had passed out propaganda at a caucus rally in California

and

vere very effective at taking control of small gatherings:

The Chairwoman from Nassau County in New York, whose

name was not recalled, defended

WONAAC stating that "they were

a good groupi

This woman's position was not supported ana,

in general, WONAAC literature was not accepted bu those persons

present,

Jill ruckelshaus, a new member of the Policy Council,

is reportedly concerned about the SWP's

attempts to align

itself with the abortion movement and will be using her newly

gained position to fight SWP attempts at control of local

MPC groups.

The NWPC organizing brochure Duhlished by the NIPC

has been written to assist individual PC groups in organizing.

The brochure lists political parties and para-political

organizations to be contacted br caucus organizers when

forming

the nucleus of a PC. Among those listed was the SWP. After

discussions at the caucus it was determined that the swp should

be removed from the list.

The new edition of the upC organizing

brochure will not list the SWP; it has been replaced by National

Peace Action Coalition (NRAC) .

The NPAC was

founded in 1970 by members of the SuP.

Its basic objective is to unite masses of people

including labor unions: CIs, and the black

community

• in the struggle to end United States

intervention in Southeast Asia through orderly and

peaceful tactics.

The Women's National Abortion

Action Coalition

Confidential sources one, two and three, all of

whom have furnished reliable information in the past, advised

on. July 1o, 19, and 20, 1972, respectively, that a Women's

National Abortion Action Coalition HONAIC, Conference was

nela at hunter college, Park Avenue and o9th Street, on

July 15 and 16, 1972.

Confidential source number one advised that

New York City was picked for the site of this convention

because this city is considered to be the center of the most

powerful anti-abortion effort so far.

The WONAAC Conference was open to all women

Who supported the Abortion Law Repeal Movement.

Registration

was $3.00 per person.

Housing and chila care facilities were

available.

There were approximately 800 women in attendance

at this conference.

Discussions held at this conference centered on

plans for (one) future activity in the campaign to repeal

all anti-abortion and contraception laws and (two to end

forced sterilization.

A discussion was held concerning the attacks

being made by the Catholic Church Flerarchy and other

anti-abortion groups against women's rights to their

own bodies.

WONAAC is aware of the fact that progress for

these matters will not come easy, that it will be fought by

various groups step by step all the way, therefore, this

conference was called to aiscuss all the different approaches

and to decide on the major direction for WONAAC to take..

A National VONAC structure proposal was

presented, which

siated in part as follows:

"All women are welcome in HONAC: Black,

Labina, Chicuna, lative Americon and Asian women, tay

women, high schost, college, and

working women, women

from political orgonizations, trade unions, the militarys

and communities across the country. We are united in un-

compromising struegle for our connon goal: the right of

all women to control fully their own reproductive lives..."

"The National Conference shall be the highest

decision-making body of MONAC, and shall operate on the

basis of one woman, one vote.

"There shall be a National Coordinating Committee

(NCC) composed of one woman from each national organization,

area coalition, and group supporting and building WONAAC...

There shall also be a Working Committee (WC),

which is a sabaconmittee of the NCC and which is composed

In addition to the above, a proposal "that the

National Office of the Women's National Abortion Action

coalition establish an emergency cach fund, from which to

contribute significant amounts of money to organizations

and individuals who are

working to achieve goals compatible

with those of WONAAC...

"That the National Office of WONAAO, as Its first

act of financial support, pledge $2,000 to the Kennedy-Schulder

suit against the tar-exempt status of the Roman Catholic Church,

since the Church has violated restrictions on its political

activity by lobbying for anti-abortion legislation.

confidential source number two related that the

evening plenary

session of WONAAC occurred on July 15, 1972,

and it was immediately apparent that the Socialist

Workers Party - Young Socialist Alliance (SWP-YSA) group

dominated the meeting. Independent women who wanted to make

statements during this session were voted down by SWP floor

leaders and these same

persons continued to vote as a bloc

on all issues.

The group of independent women fron various geogra

phic areas, that is those women who were not associated with the

SWP or YSA, went together after the plenary session was adjourned

and considered the problem of. how to handle the SWP leaders.

While these women were not political realists in their goals,

they did believe In working throughout the existing system

rather than functioning with the SWP in their eventual goal

of revolution.

It was decided that the independent feminists would

no longer continue hassling within WONAAC.

They did not want

to have decisions for them being structured by a male dominates

group. They also decided that money being collected by WONAAC

in the name of abortion law change was not being used for that

purpose, but rather to sustain members of the SiP-ySA.

The sunday morning session, July 16, 1972, was

labeled "Meeting to Discuss Internal.

Hassles.

About 35

independents attended and a few number of SWP-YSA members and

sympathizers were present.

Independents there were from New

Haven, Boston,.

Detroit, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and

San Francisco.

There were approximately 700-800 women in attendance.

at the afternoon session.

According to one of the SwP

leaders, these women were from 31 states and three countries-

Canada,

Italy and' Sweden.

The states that had more representation

than others were Ohio, Illinois, New York, and Massachusetts.

Most of the problems and differences between the

independents and the SWP centered around approaches to abortion

law reform.

The SWP was charged with always having demonstra-

tions and

sallies and

never doing any work through the legis

lative process.

The independents stated that they were tired of this

hassle and that they believed there were more effective ways

to change abortion laws

than carrying placards in the streets.

After the independent women publicly resigned in

Iront of the plenary session, two other coordinators announced

they were staying on. One was Barbara Roberts, the other's

name is unknown.

Linda Jenness made a final plea for the independent

women to reconsider. The removal of the independents from WONAAC

has debilitated the organization and most independent representa-

tives will be going back to their own cities to work for abortion

law change in organizations which have no connection with the

SWP.

The concern still exists, however, that WONAAC wilL

be able to collect monies in the name of abortion reform and

there is also the concern that women new to the movement will

join in a mistaken notion that they will be furthering

abortion law reform.

Independents vowed before leaving New York that

they would try to publicize activities from the Swp in an

effort to prevent this.

As the youth organization of the Socialist

Workers Party (SVP), the YSA serves as the

main source of recruitnent into that organ

The YSA is described in the masthead

of its official publication, "The loung

" as "A multinational

revolutionary socialist youth organization."

The SiP has been designated pursuant

to Executive Order 10450.

Abortion Rights (WUAR), 1115 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, Pa.,

telephone WA-2-0301, is the local affiliate of Women's National

Abortion Action Coalition (WONAAC) and that about two weeks ago

WUAR decided to change their name from WUAR to Philadelphia Women's

National Abortion Action Coalition (Philadelphia WONAAC) and that

they intended to utilize the same office space at 1115 Walnut

PH T-l added that this

change was made inasmuch as the name WAR was found to be unwieldy

and awkward and that it did not convey the group's affiliation with

WONAAC as well as the new name Philadelphia WONAAC.

An article in "The Sunday Bulletin," Section 2, pages

6 and 7, issue of October 31, 1971, listed the various candidates

for political office in the City of Philadelphia in connection with

in the city

the forthcoming elections.

Photographs of the following individuals

which reflected that as of that time the coordinator of WUAR

PH, T-3 advised on January 14, 1972 that kM n

PH T-I advised on May 25, 1972 that it is difficult

to determine the actual degree of SWP participation in the affairs

Of WONAAC in the Philadelphia area and

that he was not aware of

any information which would reflect that Philadelphia WONAAC was

substantially controlled by the SWP. Source explained that the

abortion rights issue had frequently been discussed at many of the

recent public forum type meetings sponsored by the Philadelphia

SWP and held at the Philadelphia SWP Headquarters at 1004 Filbert

Street in Philadelphia.

The discussions held on the abortion

rights issue indicated

that the SWP felt that the capitalistic

system had used the dual issues of abortion and women's liberation

to keep women in a position of inferiority, whereas the socialistic

system being promoted by the sw would be in favor of abortion anc

women's liberation, and WONAAC would therefore naturally attract

to their organization.

NEW YORK SUBMIT SUCCINCT IHM SETTING FORTH RESULTS OF CONFERENCE

IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAC LETTER SEVENTY-THO DASH THREE (C) RE

NOTE:

WONAAC was founded in New York City 7/71 for purpose

of forming a national

movement of groups throughout U. s. who

favor legalized abortion.

This organization is dominated by

Socialist Workers Party '(SWP) and Young Socialist Alliance

(ISA).

VONAAC scheduled to hold conference at Hunter College,

New York, New Yorks,

7/14-16/72. Detroit in teletype 7/13/72

requested authorization for DE 2831-S a valuable source who

has been paid under SAC authority, to attend national conference

in New York City.

Detroit advised delay in submitting request was

due to lack of information as to whether source would be able

to attend conference.

DE. 2831-Slis member of Detroit Women's

Abortion Action Coalition (WAAC) and has furnished coverage on

SWP influence in her chapter, and she has been successful in

thwarting complete SWP takeover. Based on informant's position

to discuss with persons in leadership capacity matters concerning

Sp infiltration of WONAAC, it appears highly desirable for

source to attena WONAAC conference in New York City, Betroit

being authorized to advance source $135 in connection with

travel to this conterence.

Detroit and New York also instructed

to coordinate re source maintaining contact with New York anc

to insure FD-306 submitted and LHM submitted setting forth

The Young Socialist Alliance-Twin Cities

Group is the Youth Branch of the Twin Cities

Branch-socialist Workers Party (TCB-sWO), an

affiliate of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP).

As the youth organization of the Socialist

Workers Party (SWP), the Young Socialist Alliance

(YSA) serves as the

main source of recruitment

into that organization.

The YSA is described in

the masthead of its official publication,

"The

Young Socialist Organizer, " as "A multinational

revolutionary socialist youth organization."

The MWAAC rally held May 6, 1972, began at the

residence of the governor of the State of Minnesota,

1006

Summit Avenue, St. Paul, Minnesota, at approximately 3:30P.M.

and proceeded

to the State Capitol

Building where the rally

calling for the repeal of all abortion laws and emphasizing

the demand for the right to legal abortions was held. The

included representatives from the YSA-TCG and the TCB-SWP.

Jane Van Deusen was the principle speaker for the MWAAC

MP T-1 on

The principle speaker in favor of legal abortion

in the State of Minnesota at the rally held in St. Paul,

The MWAAC held a meeting July 25, 1972, at 100

A report was

presented concerning a national WONAAC conference held in

decided that an International Tribunal was planned for

October 21, 1972. The International Tribunal would be

held in New York City, New York, and it was hoped that

plans could be made for a local tribunal scheduled to be

held October 13, 1972, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, after

which individuals would be designated

to attend the inter-

national meeting scheduled for New York City. This July,

1972, meeting was the first activity on the part of the

MWAAC as a ned organized effort following the May 6, 1972,

rally.

MP T-1 on

August 9, 1972

Individuals known to be involved in the women's

liberation movement in the Twin Cities area of Minneapolis

and St. Paul, Minnesota, have, during the past six months,

shown little or no interest in the organization known as

MWAAC.

Former leaders in the women's liberation movement

have become aware of the SP influence among the leaders of

the group, and have adopted a hands off policy from active

participation in the affairs of this group. While the

May 6, 1972, rally in St. Paul, Minnesota, was attended by

some 200 individuals, their attendance was considered to be

the in to abortan

due to individual interest in the abortion issue.

MP T-2 on

August 17, 1972

SWP INFLUENCE

The MWAAC is not a committee of the TCB-SWP, nor

is it a part of the YSA-TCG.

Women's liberation is a

topic

of general interest and concern to the membership of the

TCB-SWP, and the anti-abortion standard taken by MWAAC is

one aspect of the women's liberation movement of continued

interest.

Members of the YSA-TCG have in the past, expressed

interest in the support of women's liberation as a matter of

policy.

The anti-abortion, or so called legal abortion

movement, is one aspect of this women's liberatión movement

which continues to be of concern to members of the YSA-TCG,

both male and female.

While the vast majority of women in

the State of Minnesota support either the repeal or changes

in present state laws on abortion, supporters of this repeal

or change also include professional women, medical doctors,

lawyers, municipal court judges, and individuals from all

walks of life.

in New York City (NYC), details of which will be set out

more fully hereinafter.

As the youth organization of the

SWP, the YSA serves as the main

source of recruitment into that

organization.

The YSA is described

in the masthead of its official

publication, "The Young Socialist

Organizer", as "a Multi-National

Revolutionary Socialist Youth

Organization"

The SWP has been designated pur-

suant to Executive Order 10450.

I.

ORGANIZATIONAL DATA

A. Origin and Scope

NY T-2 on July 21, 1971, and NY I-3 on October 1,

1971, furnished information that over 1,000 women met in

conference at Columbla University, NYC, NY, on July 16;

1971, through July 18, 1971, to form a National Movement

of independent groups scattered throughout the United

States (US) who favored and had worked to legalize abortion.

As a result of this conference, WONAAC was founded.

B. Aims and Purposes

In the WONAAC national newsletter, dated September 16,

1971, WONAAC was

self-described as a nationally coordina-

ted abortion law repeal campaign including legislation;

legal action, and nationally coordinated mass demonstrations

in Washington, DC, and San Francisco, on November 20, 1971,

for the repeal of all anti-abortion laws and corollary

demands of no forced sterilization, and the repeal of all

restrictive contraception laws.

WONAAC claims to reach

all women, black; Chinaca; Latina; Asian; Puerto Rican;

native American women; campus women; gay women; high

school women; housewives; professional, welfare, and

working women; young women; women from churches, political

organizations, trade unions, the military, and communities

across the country:

On November 22, 1972, a Special Agent (SA) of

the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), utilizing a

pretext, contacted an individual self-identified as CAROL

D. When Meetings Held

According to CAROL EATON, regular NY Coalition

meetings of WONAAC are held every other Wednesday evening

at Religious Center at New York University, 2 Washington

Square North, NYC, NY. EATON stated that most MY State

staff members are

present at these meetings and at least

one or more National Staff members also try to be in

attendance.

Other than this, state and national staffs

meet periodically, as business demands.

Membership and Finances

According to EATON, WONAAC does not maintain a

formal membership, as such,

and financially exists only

through voluntary contributions.

She stated that all

staff memöers, National and NY State, serve on a voluntary

basis, receive no salary, and get only a small "subsistance

allowance" which the staff has found necessary to supplement

with their own personal funds in order to get by.

G.

WONAAC Affiliates

CAROL EATON stated there are presently 36 WONAAC

affiliates, also called "coalitions" throughout the us, and

that most states of the union are represented by an affiliate

or coalition.

II.

YSA-SWP INFLUENCE AND CONTROL

OVER WONAAC

NY T-1 provided information on July 22, 1971,

that the First National Womens Abortion Conference was

held at Columbia University, NYC, NY, from July 16, 1971,

to July 18, 1971, which resulted in the founding of WONAAC.

NY I-1 stated that it was immediately apparent that this

conference was taken over and influenced by YSA-SWP members

who infiltrated the various conference committees and

workshops which were established to help formulate the

main direction the Coalition would follow in the future.

NY T-I stated that it seemed certain the YSA-SWP would,

in the future, dictate policy for this organization and

would be able

to control the utilization of WoNAAC funds.

On August 5, 1971, NY I-4 provided a leaflet

captioned, "What Every Woman Should Know". This leaflet,

which was

published by Feminist Organization for Communi-

cation; Action and Service (F.O.C.A.S.), related the following:

"The

• Womens National Abortion Coalition has

been called and organized by the Swe and its aftiliate,

the YSA, including women supposedly representing Women's

Liberation groups, who in truth represent, first, the

4

NW 88321 Docld:32989545 Page 447

## Page 1045

NY 100-174481

SWP and YSA. These women attach more importance to their

political movement than to the Women's Liberation Movement.

And when 77% of the women in this country are for reform

of abortion laws, there is fertile soil for a political:

party to build itself on. The SWP/YSA realizes this and

is taking advantage of it."

On August 5, 1971, a leaflet

captioned "F.0.C.A.S." revealed

in part as follows:

"A nucleus of about eight feminists

have formed FOCAS, Feminist

Organization for Communication,

Action anâ Service.

FOCAS evolved

from the Women's Strike Coalition

(WSC), which the Socialist Workers

Party abruptly abandoned on May

25th in order to form the committee

for WONAAC.

Since that time a

nucleus of women from WSC together

with like-minded feminists pre-

served the WSC in order to main-

tain and expand a multi-issue

action-oriented Women's Libera~

tion coalition in the NYC area.

Assisted by loans from supporting

feminists, the new WSC paid

back nearly a thousand of the

three thousand dollars of debts

incurred by the SWP women who

had controlled the old wSC.

The "Militant" issue of August 6, 1971, page five,

in an article entitled, "Abortion Campaign Counters Red-

Baiting", revealed in part, with respect to the founding

WONAAC conference in July, 1971:

"The Militant" is a weekly news-

paper of the SWP.

conference, and SWers and YSAers are among those who

have worked most consistently for

NY I-5 advised on November 12, 1971, that a Ny

Planning Meeting of WONAAC was held at LOIB Student Center,

NY University, NY, on November 11, 1971, to lay plans

for a scheduled November 20, 1971

demonstration in Washington,

According to this source, this meeting was completely

dominated

and controlled by members of the SWP.

NY I-6 related on November 16, 1971, that the Upper

West Side Branch of the YSA planned to send a

contingent

of its members to Washington, DC, on November 20, 1971,

in order to participate in the planned demonstration there

on that date. •

NY I-6 stated that practically all the members of the

uptown branch of the YSA, NY, were expected to participate

in this activity.

NY I-5 related on January 20, 1972, that the scheduled

November 20, 1971 march in Washington was "crucial" to

all SWP and YSA branches in that it afforded an opportunity

for selling of "The Militant"

and other SWP/YSA literature,

and also afforded an opportunity for "intervening " in the

action via distribution of SWP Election Campaign literature.

NY T-8 on February 11, 1972, and NY T-9 and NY T-10

on February 14, 1972, provided information that a WONAAC

convention was held February 11, 1972, to February 13, 1972,

. at Hayden Hall, Boston University, Boston, Mässachusetts.

The general theme of this convention was

"How to Win

Abortion Law Repeal". NY I-8 stated that approximately

30 members of the YSA or SWP Boston Chapters were observed.

in attendance at this convention.

NY I-7 related on February 14, 1972, that because of the

de-escalation of the Vietnam War by the NIXON

Administration,

NW 88321 Docld:32989545 Page 449

NY 100÷174481

Committee (SMC) and NY National Peace Action Coalition

(NPAC), both of which organizations they dominate, would

also concentrate in the area of the Women's Liberation

Movement through their influence in WONAAC.

The SMC is controlled by the

SWP and its youth affiliate,

YSA.

SMC initiates and supports

public demonstrations against

the war in Southeast Asia.

NAC was founded in 1970 by

members of the SWP.

Its objec-

tive is the immediate, total

and unconditional withdrawal

of all US forces and material

in Southeast Asia.

NY I-7 advised on various dates, March 23, 1972,

through October 17, 1972, that activities of WONAAC were

dutifully reported

and included on the agenda at regular

meetings of the Upper West Side Branch, YSA-New York Local

(NYL) during that period.

NY T-5 advised on April 18, 1972, that the leader-

ship of WONAAC was then dominated by the SWP.

NY I-7 related on July 7, 1972, that at a WONAAC

meeting held June 27, 1972, at 706 Broadway, NYC, NY,

starting at 6:40 PM, it was announced that even though

WONAAC previously had accused various female activists

working along with them in the Women's Liberation struggle

of red baiting because of the stand they had taken against

the SWP-Young Socialist Alliance (YSA), at present they

forced to work with these individuals to help strengthen

the WONAAC cause.

At this meeting, certain WONAAC StalI members

walked out and voiced their disapproval of the meeting

being taken over by a majority of SWP-YSA members.

They indicated that the SWP-YSA has no right to be in a

policy-making position in WONAAC.

7

## Page 1048

NY 100-174481

NY T-7 on July 18, 1972, and NY I-ll on July 19,

1972, provided information that a WONAAC conference was

held at Hunter College, Park Avenue and 69th Street on

July 15, 1972 and July 16, 1972.

NY T-7 stated that NYC was picked as the site of

this convention because this city is considered to be

the center of the most powerful anti-abortion effort so far.

Discussionsheld at this conference centered on

plans for (one)-future activity in the campaign to repeal

all anti-abortion and contraception laws and (two)-to

end forced sterilization.

•A discussion was held concerning the attacks

being made by the Catholic Church Hierarchy and other

anti-abortion groups against women's rights to their own

bodies:

NY T-11 related that the evening plenary session

Of WONAAC occurred on July 15, 1972, and it was immediately

apparent that the SWP-YSA groups dominated the meeting.

Independent women who wanted to make statements during

this session were voted down by SW 'floor leaders and

these same persons continued to vote as a block on all

issues.

The group of independent women from various

geographic areas, that is, those women who were not

associated with the SWP or YSA, went together after the

plenary session was adjourned and considered the problem

of how to handle the SWP leaders.

While these women

were not political realists in their goals, they did

believe in working throughout the existing system rather

than functioning with the SWP in their eventual goal of

revolution.

It was decided that the independent feminists

would no longer continue hassling within WONAAC.

They

did not want to have decisions for them being structured

by a male dominated group.

They also decided that money

being collected by WONAAC in the name of abortion law

## Page 1049

NY 100-174481

change was not being used for that purpose, but rather

to sustain members of the SWP-YSA.

The Sunday morning session, July 16, 1972, was

labeled "Meeting to Discuss Internal Hassles.

About 35

independents attended and a few number of SWP-YSA members

and sympathizers were present. Independents there were

from New Haven, Boston, Detroit, New York (NÝ), Chicago,

Philadelphia,

and San Francisco.

The independents did not waiver in their firm

opposition to SWP-YSA control of WONAAC. Six national

coordinators of WONAAC were independents and decided to

resign publicly at the afternoon plenary session.

They

also decided to combat SWP control of the feminist move-

ment through the various publications.

"I.... The six national coordinators who resigned wer

JUDY SIPHERS, San Francisco; ANN C DAVIDSON, Philadelphia

ROSEYWEBER, NY; VICKIESLINGER, Columbia, South Carolina;

NANCY, ROLE, NY; and ELLENASHAPIRO, NY.

There were approximately 700-800 women in atten-

dance at the afternoon session.

According to one of the

SWP leaders, these women were from 31 states and three

countries-Canada, Italy and Sweden.

The states that had

more representation than others were Onlo, Illinois, New

York and Massachusetts.

Most of the problems and differences between the

independents and the SWP centered around approaches to

abortion law reform. The SWP was charged with always

having demonstrations and rallies and never doing any

work through the legislative process.

The independents stated that they were tired of

this hassle and that they believed there were more ef-

fective ways to change abortion laws than carrying placards

in the streets.

NW 88321 Docld:32989545 Page 452

## Page 1050

NY 100-174481

After the independent women publicly resigned in

ront of the plenary session, two other coordinators announcec

they were staying

on.

One was BARBARAXROBERTS, the other's

name is unknown.

EDER OF SUBJECT CECANISATION

MANDER OF SUBJECI COALITION

LINDA JENNESS made a final plea for the indepen-

dent women to reconsider.

The removal of the independents

from WONAAC has debilitated the organization and most

independent, representatives will be going back to their

own cities to work for abortion law change in organizations

which have no connection with the SWP.

The concern still exists, however, that WONAAC will

be able to collect monies in the name of abortion reform

and there is also the concern that women new to the move-

mond sh m

ment will join in a mistaken notion that they will be

furthering abortion law reform.

Independents vowed before leaving NY that they

would try to publicize activities from the SWP in an

effort to prevent this.

III. OBSERVATION OF CURRENT NATIONAL

STAFF MEMBER REGARDING YSA/SWP INFLUENCE

When contacted under pretext on November 24,

1972, CAROL EATON, self-identified as a current National

Staff member, and previously mentioned in this report,

related that she has been

inception. EATON, While averring in wovAAc since its

she is definitely not a

YSA, SWP, or member of any "radical group",

acknowleaged

there always have been SWP, YSA and "radical" elements

in WONAAC.

She went on to state, however, that WONAAC

has never allied itself politically with any organization

or individual, including any of the political candidates

in the recent

political election and, despite its diverse

makeup as too ideological beliefs of its membership,

WONAAC is basically an organization which strives only

to the objectives for which it was originally founded.

To this end, she went on, WONAAC would accept help from

whatever source offered.

10

NW 88321 Docld:32989545 Page 453

---

## Page 1051

NY 100-174481

EATON admitted there were some problems in

the past with regard to friction within WONAAC about SWP

and YSA influence.

She stated, however, this matter, to

her observation, never seemed a serious one,

and is quite

minimal today.

With regard to the "walk out" of six

national coordinators at the July, 1972 conference in NYC,

she stated the walk out did not occur, in fact, because:

of the SWP/YSA influence question, but rather because

those who walked out believed WONAAC should be a "referral

agency"*

, while those who stayed felt it should not.

By

referral agency, EATON statedshe means an agency which would refer

callers to a specific location or place where abortions

could be obtained:

IV. PLANNED PROJECTS

CAROL EATON advised that WONAAC plans an inter-

national Tribunal march to be held in NYC, NY, from March 9, •

1972, to March 11, 1972. She stated plans have not yet been

finalized, including the exact location or site this event

will take place.

However, she noted that SIMONE/BEAUVOIR,

a Parisian, well known in the Women's Liberation Movement,

would be honorary chairwoman.

WOMEN'S NATIONAL ABORTION

ACTION COALITION (WONAAC)

During the latter part of february, 1973, a confidential

source, who has furnished reliable information in the past,

advised that the Washington, D.C. (WDC) Chapter of the Women's

National Abortion Action Coalition (D.C. WONAAC) is scheduled

to participate in an "International Woman's Day Solidarity

Meeting"

scheduled to be held in New York City, New York on

Saturaay, March 10, 1973, place to be announced.

The national office of WONAAC is located at

150 Fifth Avenue, New York City, New York.

WONAAC goals are

self-defined as

"working

on a national scale to make abortion legal,

to end restrictive contraception laws, and

to end forced sterilization."

According to the above source, a flyer distributed

by D.C. WONAAC disclosed that among those individuals

scheduled to speak at the meeting are; GISELE HALIMI, described

as a leader of "Choisir," a French abortion rights organization;

MICHELE CHEVALIER, described as a defendent in a French abortion

trial; and CLAUDE

SERVAN SCHREIBER, described as

a feminist

journalist and as a leader of "Choisir".

According to the above source, members of the

WDC Locals of the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA) and the

Socialist Workers Party (SWP) have been urged to participate

in the International Womans Day Solidarity Meeting•

As the youth organization of the SWP, the

YSA serves as the main source of recruitment

into that organization.

The YSA is

described in the masthead of its official

publication "The Young Socialist Organizer",

as "A multinational revolutionary socialist

youth organization."

The SWP has been designated pursuant to

Executive Order 10450.

NEW YORK

RePElet 2/28/73.

The Women's National Abortion Action Coalition (HONAAC)

has been

the subject oi a separate investigation by the Bureau

in nunerous offices.

In referenced letter, Philadelphia pointed

out that WONAAC represents a lasic social change desling with

abortion rights and that in view of the fact the U.S. Supreme

Court upheld the right of abortion, the continued investigation

Di WONAAC at this tine does not appeaz to be desirable and

should ba discontinued. Philadelphia also suggested that

continued investigation of the Socialist Workers Party (SMP)

2 to 304918

and its youth group, the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA), should

determine pertinent activities of MONAAC.

After caraiul consideration of this ratter, the Bureau

agrees with the observations oi the Philadelphia Office that the

investigation of WONAAC should

be discontinued.

However, in view

pursuant to Executive Order 10450, it is the responsibility of the

Bureau to investigate and report pertinent information relating

to the extent of STiP domination and control of captioned

organization.

Re Philadelphia letter to Bureau dated 1/31/73-

to be taken which could in any way be construed as infringement

by the FBI on academic freedom at the University of Pennsylvania.

The case file of captioned organization has been

reviewed as well as all indices references to captioned

organization and it has been determined that while some of

the individuals associated with WONAAC in the Philadelphia

area are also known to be affiliated with the Socialist

Workers Party (SWP) and for the Young Socialist Alliance

(YSA), the majority of WONAAC supporters appear to be

individuals interested in

tionary political chagri05 social change rather than revolu

In view of the fact that woNAC represents basically

a social change vehicle dealing with the single issue of

abortion rights and the fact that a recent U. S. Supreme

Court decision upheld the right to abortion, thereby reducing

the political value of this issue, it would appear that a

continued investigation of WONAAC at this time is not

desirable.

based on the 1/22/73 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court

wherein it was ruled that the states cannot prohibit abortions

during the first six months of pregnancy..

The decision of the Minnesota Supreme Coartas

resulted in several Twin Cities area hospitals in Minneapolis

and St. Paul, Minnesota, offering facilities and providing

necessary proceduros for state nembers to portory abortions 1s

under these court rulings.

MP 2851-PSI)

who has furnished reliable information

in the past,

has advised that the object of the captioned

group was to remove anti-abortion laws from the books in the

state of Minnesota, as well as in the United states.

on 2/16/73 this source further related that the

Women's Liberation Movement supporters in the Twin Cities

area have generally reacted favorably to the court decisions

relating to abortion laws and now that the principal object

of the Minnesota Abortion Action Coalition has been achieved,

the influence of its spokesmen is expected to decline.

In regard to your request to continue attempts

must be conducted in a most discreet manner and limited

to established sources.

No action is to be taken by you

which could in any way be construed as infringement by the

It is noted by the Bureau that the above

your request was not submitted to the Bureau until 1/31/73,

through, which women won the. right to vote, ciatise, iral.

atrial Today, in every corner of the earth, laws deny

women the right to abortion, the right to decide whether of

not to have children.. Now a new generation of women has

begun to stand up for our rights.

"The coalition, which comprises about 30 women's

•groups, will also demonstrate against forced

and restrictive contraception laws and plans to hold

national abortion hearings in Washington before the march."

First source advised on October 15, 1971, that the

November 20, 1971, rally. has received mixed

support from

various Washington, D. C., women:'s liberation groups.

Several radical vomen's groups refused to endorse the November

20, 1971, action because they view it as a Young Socialist

•Alliance (YSA) /Socialist Workers Party (SVP) Front which will

use these rallies to further its own recruitment drive.

Furthermore, they considered YSA/SWP to be "non-feminist".

Main support for the November 20, 1971, demonstration will come

from. the WSA Women's Fraction Group.

Subcommittees of the JRB have been meeting in the

headquarters of WSP at 5899 West Pico Boulevard, and WIA at

5009 West Pico Boulevara, Los Angeles. During the most

recent of these subcommittee meetings, held during the first

week in January 1968, at the latter location, much of the

discussion was related to proposed action in Southern California

by women who would be unable to travel to washington, D. C.s

for the January 15th confrontation with Congress.

TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN,

I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress

was a vote against war. It was the first opportunity for a

woman to vote because I was the first woman to be elected

to Congress.

I believed then as I do today that women are the ones who

must be concerned with the needs and development of the

human race. I have always fought for the dignity of all

human beings -- for those of the present as well as those

of future generations.

I will continue to struggle as long as I live.

I hope all women will respond to the following CALL, and

join me in Washington on January 8, 1968, the opening

day of Congress.

With highest hopes,

Dear WSPER:

fomen Strike for Peace nationally is suoporting the Jeannette Rankin Brigade.

Planelois, trainloads and carloads of women will be coming into Washington on Mon-

day, January 15th, from all over the country.

'le are particularly pleased with this action because it represents for the first

time a real coalition of women's peace groups, church groups; theatre personalities, .

and community leaders.

The Day is envisioned

as a solemn, dignified confrontation of those who should be

representing the ever growing opposition to the war. We ask that you write your Con-

gressnen urging that they support the four points listed in the enclosed Call as Con

gress reconvenes.

Later in the afternoon at our Women's Congress we want to be able to

report on Congressional responses.

We will all meet at Union Station in Washington at 11:30 AM and slowly walk to the

Capitol. We ask the women to wear black.

We will be led by Jeannette Rankin who will

croceed to the top of the Capitol steps with a representative delegation of 50 women to

resent our petition io the two men who represent the whole of Congress, Senator Mike

ansfield and Speaker of the House McCormack. The delegation will read the demands be

ore the assembled women and the two Congressmen. Leaving the Hill, the women will enter

puses for a motorcade to a Congress of American Women (place to be announced). . Women

pill present an analysis of the current crisis on the war front and the domestic fxont,

-eading to suggestions for program and actions to be taken back to our communities for

Lementation.

Women may choose to remain in Washington the next day to meet with their Congressmen.

I you wish to stay and wish help in securing accommodations, contact the hospitality com

ittee, 2140 P. St. NoW. Washington, DC (293-2020). We regret that in order to get the

owest

train fare we had to guarantee return the same day; therefore you would have to

inance your own trip back on the 16th.

Our hope is that 10,000 women will converge upon Washington. We urge you to partiv

ipate.

Yours for Peace,

Ethel Taylor

reconvenes in Washington.

Women from all over the United

States have gathered there to

petition the Congress in the

name of the Jeanette Rankin

Brigade. Jeannette Rankin,

the first woman to serve in

Congress and the only person

to vote against U.S. entry

into both World Wars, leads

the women there, along

with

such other sponsors as Mrs.

M.L.King, Mrs. Harry Belafonte,

Mr's. John C. Bennett, Mrs.

Benjamin Spock, Mrs Judith

Norse Eaton. The Brigade is a

antiwar groups mobilized

against the war in Veitnam.

As the cost of the war in lives

and money mounts daily, the

women of this. country call upon

congress to take action against

it.

To support the senators and

• Congressmen who oppose the war,

to encourage those who are troubled

but silent, to speak out, and to

make our position known to those

who still support this immoral

war, we, as women of Hawaii, are

gathered here.

Our message to

Reps. Mink and, Matsunaga, to

Sens. Fong and Inouye, is that

women will no longer give their sons and loved ones to a government

waging a genocidal war...

women will no longer accept a government which represents a military

and industrial machine rather than its people...

women will no

longer consent to raise their children in the blight

and neglect of a society geared to profit and war...

women grieve for suffering people all over the world and will no longer

remain silent while the gap widens between the rich and the poor...

We ask our government to design and carry out a domestic program

commensurate with the needs of the American people; to foltow a

policy of non-intervention in the affairs of other countries; to

pursue our official committment to disarmament, and to respect

international law.

American women who, as women everywhere, are the bearers and conservers

of life, will not stand ídly by as life is destroyed in our name.

About two hundred Oahu women have signed the following petition to

Congress:

As Congress reconvenes, we urge that its first order of business

be to put an end to the war in Vietnam and arrange for the withdrawal

of

American troops; and that the Congress turn its attention to

ametiorating the crisis in America.

We urge the Congress to heal a sick society at home, to make reparations

for the ravaged land we leave behind in Vietnam and to refuse to

listen to the insatiable demands of the military-industrial complex.

I want to be kept informed about women's peace activities.

JANUARY 15, 1968

Chairman of the Brigade, announced to the demonstrators that this

local demonstration was principally gathered to support women

from around the United States who were gathered in Washington,

D.C. today, as part of a nation-wide demonstration sponsored by

the Jeannette Rankin Brigade, to petition Congress to resolve

the conflict in Vietnam.

Bridges stated that inasmuch as 1t

was

not possible for the demonstrators to personally contact

their congressmen,

most of whom were out of town; that following

the presentation of a petition to Mayor Joseph Alioto, the

demonstrators would then proceed to the Western Union Office on

10th and Market Streets

in San Francisco, so that the women

protestors could send wires to their congressmen, protesting

United States policies in Vietnam.

Bridges indicated that the

petitioners would request Mayor Alioto to convey to Congress.

their petition, which among other things urged Congress, as its

first order of business, to resolve to end the War in Vietnam and

immediately arrange for

withdrawal of all American troops from

Vietnam; for Congress to use its power to heal the sick society

at home

and to make reparations for the ravaged lands left

behind in Vietnam.

A source advised March 2, 1967, that Mrs. H.

Bridges, also known as

Nikki Bridges, 35

Kronquest Court, San Francisco, California, was

listed as a recipient of a new yearly subscription

to the "People's World" (PW), expiration date.

to the demonstrators who Jeannette Rankin is and what the purposes

of the Jeannette Rankin Brigade are. She stated that the group

women who are Involved and committed in a light Ior peace.

Several of the demonstrators, led by Nikki Bridges,

then proceeded to the Office of Mayor Joseph Alioto to present

their petition.

JANUARY 15, 1968

Approximately ten minutes later the Mayor of

San Francisco appeared on the steps of the City Hall and announced

to the demonstrators that he would gladly transmit their

petition to Congress.

Mayor Alioto stated that he fully

believed in the constitutional right of peaceful assemdLy.

He indicated, however, that because he had consented to

transmit the demonstrators' petition to Washington, he did not

necessarily agree with it.

The Mayor then stated that it

was his personal opinion that the United States Government and

the Johnson Administration had done all in its power, to attempt

to come to a peaceful and honorable solution in the Vietnamese

War. He related that he felt that it was now up to the other

side to make the same attempts to arrive at a

peaceful solution

in the Vietnamese conflict.

At approximately 12:45 p.m., the demonstrators proceeded

to the Western Union Office located at l0th and Market Streets

in San Francisco, so that wires could be sent to their congressmen

in Washington.

A Special Agent of the fBl observed one blaine

Yoneda. participating in the above demonstration and following

the demonstration Yoneda was observed to return to her employment

at the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union

(ILWU) - Pacific Maritime Association, Pension Fund, at 150

Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco.

A second source advised on December 4, 1967, that

Elaine Yoneda is a current and active member of the Communist

Party (CP).

On January 15, 1968, a Special Agent of the FBI

observed a silent protest by a group of women on the lawn

of Colton Hall, Monterey, California, between 3:00 and 5:00 p.m.

These women were ostensibly gathered

to support the demonstration

being held in Washington, D.C., sponsored by the Jeannette Rankin

Brigade.

There were no speeches given; the demonstrators merely

conducted

a silent vigil.

A one page leaflet captioned "Women To Take First

Step to End The War" printed by the Jeannette Rankin Brigade,

at 150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, California, was handed

out at the above demonstration.

INFORMATION CONCERNING

Reference is made to a memorandum,

captioned as above, dated December 28,

1967, at Miami, Florida. The memorandum

concerned a call issued by the Jeannette

Rankin Brigade for American Women to travel

to Washington, D. C. on January 15, 1968,

to petition the United States Congress to

end the war in Viet Nam.

A source, on January 15, 1968, advised that the Miami

Chapter of the Women's International League for Peace and

Freedom (WILPF) had scheduled a demonstration to take place

January 15, 1968, at Miami, Florida.

The demonstration

would be a

support activity for the

Jeannette Rankin Brigade

that would be in Washington, D. C. on that date to petition

Congress to end the war in Viet Nam.

The January 16, 1968, Issue of

the "Miami Herald,"

a local Miami, Florida

newspaper, contained an article entitled

"Five Thousand Women Join Viet lar Protest."

The article identified Jeanette Rankin

as an 87 year old wonan pacifist and

former member of Congress who voted in

Congress against the American entry into

both world wars.

A Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investi-

gation (FBI) on January 15, 1968, observed an anti-war

demonstration take place in Miami, Florida. Approximately

70 participants, mostly elderly women, assembled at the

Torch of Friendship, Bayfront Park, downtown Miami, at

2:00 p.m. They stood in silent vigil, some wearing black

"Join Our Silent Vigil For Peace In Viet Nam"

"Vietnamese Are Our Brothers Whom We Kill"

"For A World Without War"

Literature distributed identified the sponsor of

The participants, following the vigil, continued

their demonstration by walking in single file with the

anti-war signs through the downtown city streets to the

Federal Building where they dispersed at 3:15 p.m.

No incidents were observed to occur.

Source also advised that at least six people from

greater Miami had considered traveling to Washington, D. C.

to participate in the demonstration in that city being

sponsored by the Jeannette Rankin Brigade although no firm

plans had been made. Among these individuals was Greta

/Lynch.

A second source in April, 1951, advised

that Greta Lynch that year stated she

Three women representing the black community wero

also scheduled to fly to Washington from the Southern

attornia iRs committee they were bobbie hoagesarthea

and Glory Roberts. Two women affiliated with

the peace ortented Pasadena Chapter of the Women's International

League for Peace and Freedom; Cathy Hofer and Marian Beardsley,

were also to join the above

women for the flight to washington,

according to Source One.

On January 15, 1968, Special Agents of the Los Angeles

Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation observed a

group of women assemble in front of the Old State Bullding, 217

West First Street (First and Broadway, in the downtown Civic

Center), Los Angeles, Califomia, at

approximately 9:30 AM.

The women were carrying placards indicating they were the

local representation of the JRB. They also had two leaflets

for distribution (Xerox copies of which are appended

to this

memorandum) which called for women to participate and which

indicated that a voting block of American women had the power

to put an ena to the war in Vietnam.

These leaflets bore the

address of the JRB as 5899 West Pico Boulevard, Los Angeles,

California (90019), which is the address of the headquarters of

the WSP in Southern California.

Starting shortly after 10:00 AM, the women proceeded

to hold a rally on the south steps of the Old State Building,

with the

speakers utilizing an electronic amplification system,

which was' held by actress Leslie Parrish.

Source One indicated that Parrish had originally been

scheduled to fly to washington, D. C., to participate in the

JRB action at the Capitol, but

changed her plans at the last

minute. In order to remain in Los Angeles.

The rally was headed by Tima Tomash, who acted as

the local URb organizer and answered some of the questions

regarding the JPB from members of the news media on the scene.

Veronica Sissons, acted as mistress of ceremonies. Speakers

Included Mary Henry. Negro civil rights and poverty worker;

a militant black nationalist, who has been extremely

active in recent months in disturbances at Manual Arts High

School, Los Angeles, which resulted in a court injunction to

prohibit her entering those school grounds); and television

actress Ellen Micrae.

The speakers all called for a coalition

of women to form a strong voting block which could produce

legislation to end the war In Vietnam, end poverty and "legislated

Injustice"

At 10:50 AM, the women marched to the steps on the

First Street side of the Los Angeles City Hall for a second

A count made as the demonstrators marched between the

Old State Building and the City Hall revealed that 250

adult Caucasians (majority of whom were women dressed in

black), and eight non-Caucasian adults were involved, plus

some youngsters and infants.

The mother of one of the children

had a cardboard sign, depicting a bomb and the caption, "I'm

Glad I'm Not Vietnamese"

strapped to the back of her son who

appeared to be less than

four years of age.

With Veronica Sissons again acting as mistress of / y

ceremonies; the rally was addressed by Chamlobte Sherman,

Margaret Wright, Tima Tomash, and Jily Schary.

The latteri

was introduced as a radio commentator employed by Los Angeles

Radio Station KUAC.

She joined the others in calling for a

coalition of women

• to influence legislation and bring an end to

the war in Vietnam. She also called for support of other "liberal

radio broadcasters on our side"

, one of whom she named as

William Winter.

(The "Daily People's World"

, west coast

communist newspaper, in its edition oi June 11, 1940,

described

William Winter as chairman of a local citizens!

committee to

safeguard the Joint Anti-Fascist Reîuge Committee, which

organization has been cited pursuant to Executive

Order 10450).

Charlotte Sherman was introduced as the wife of : .

i:: " Laurence Sherman,

it being pointed out that he was an

- -

unsuccessful

candidate for public office, on a peace slate,

during 1967; but that both he and his wife were continuing

the

fight for an end to the war in Vietnan.

She said,

"It is time.

for us to re-examine our role. as women.

Women are a vehicle

We will not be a vehicle for perpetuation

them.

Margaret Wright stated that wherees the majority of

women in the demonstration were wearing black to denote mourning,

that she and her non-Caucasian associates who feel, "Black is

beautiful" were dressed in white to indicate their

attitude of

mouring. She called for the elimination of ROIC (Reserve

Officers Training Corps) from local high schools and junior

colleges, adding,

"They have got to get

live bullets out of the

schools,

and get

some live teachers In."

She repeated these

same statements during the afternoon when the JRB moved to

the Los Angeles City Board of Education.

As the rally was

breaking up, wright grabbed the

public address system and

said that it had been learned that

the City Council was in session inside the City Hall Building.

NW 88321 Docld:32989545 Page 694

She urged the women not to disperse, but to join her and...

others in invading the City Council Chambers with a demand

that the JRB be allowed to speak to the Council even though

they had not made previous arrangements for a place on the

agenda that day.

Some of the women were already out of range

of the public address system and did not hear this announcement

by Wright, having already been dismissed by. Sissons and told to

reconvene at the Board of Education following luncheon.

Approximately 200 of the demonstrators did enter

the Council Chambers. They got word to the councilmen, through

A motion to allow a JRB representative to address them

was

put before the Council, and defeated by a vote of six to five.

Immediately following this vote, there was a unanimous vote

that the Council adjourn. As the councilmen filed out of the

room, Tima Tomash rushed

to the front shouting demands that

they

retur, while other of the women hissed and booed the

city legislators.

During. the noon hour some of the women distributed.

leaflets in the City Hall and on the surrounding streets in

the downtown Civic Center.

At 1:00 PM, the womén,

whose numbers had by that

time been reduced to 125, massed in the patio of the. Los

Angeles City Board of Education, 450 North Grand Avenue,

Los Angeles. Sissons, Wright and Tomash addressed-the

--....=

assembled demonstrators, pointing out that money spent in

Vietnam could be better spent in education.

Wright claimed

that many of the so-called student "arop-outs" are in reality

"push-outs"

, claiming that she herseli was one of the latter.

She said,

"we need books, not bombs.

We know this is

a racist

war and

we blacks are.not going to fight a racist war"

indicated that rather than fight overseas, the black people

would remain at home and fight the racists. She also said,

"Just because I'm pro-plack doesn't necessarily mean I'm anti-.

white."

Wright said, "I'm not political, but I am honest. I

can't honestly get up and say the pledge

of allegiance to

the

American flag, because I really don't have llberty and justice;

so I just get up and stand and won't repeat the pledge.

Later, when she observed a photograph of President Johnson

hanging from a wall in the Administration Building at the

Los Angeles City Board of Education, she told the JRB women

with her, "

"We shouldn't have to look at such pornographic

pictures.

Wright said that her arrest at the hands of Los

Angeles City Concol Security Officers, during the recent.

Manual Arts High School disturbance,

had at least one bright

result. She said that at the time of her arrest it had been

hall as she was too heavy for then to carry. Then she added

that excuse as she has lost thirty pounds in the meantime.

The speeches in the patio ended at 1:30 PM and many

of the women leit immediately.

Seventy-eight women remained

and attempted to enter a special committee meeting being attended

by some of the School Board members.

They were inforned by a

member of the administrative staff-that the public meeting of the

School Board would not be held until 4:00 PM, the regularly

scheduled meeting time.. The women milled around in the hallway

outside the meeting room, until finally a staff member came

out

and told them that two members of the School Board, Reverend

James E. Jones and Dr. Julian. Nava, had agreed to grant them

an

audience. The women were then ushered into the public board

room of the School Board where they waited until 2:00 PM at

which time the above-named Board members granted the demonstrators

a short audience and answered some questions put to them by the

One question, as to how much longer the members of the

School Board were going to permit recruiters from the armed

forces to interview students at local- high schools and junior

colleges remained unanswered, but Dr. Nava pointed out to the

women that he had seen nothing wrong in entering the armed

forces to fight for this country himself when he vas 17 years

of age, and he could see nothing wrong in other young men who

wanted to do the same today. The demonstration was concluded

by 3:00 PM. There were no incidents and no arrests.

Placards carried during this demonsuration in los

Angeles bore the following captions:

-"Eat Texas Beef, Not L.B.J. Baloney"

"Woman Power is Vote Power is Peace Power"

"Draft Beer Not Students"

"Where Have All the Men Gone-To Graveyards"

continued as an independent organization, rallying support

for integration and democracy and helping to stimulate

and nurture new movements of the early 1960's. The SCEF

maintained headquarters in Louisiana for twenty years, but

in 1966 moved its headquarters to Louisville, Kentucky.

A

source advised on March 2, 1961, that Claude

Lightfoot, a Communist Party functionary, stated at a meeting

and worked actively in the SCHw; however, since the formation

of the SCEF, Communist Party members have not been encouraged

to work in the scEF.

The source stated that the SCEr is

a progressive, liberal organization, which he considers a

Communist Party front organization because it has gone along

with the Communist Party on certain issues, particularly

on the racial issue.

A third source advised on May 25, 1965, that

George Meyers, a Communist Party functionary, expressed

great admiration for Carl and Anne Braden and the SCEF,

with which they are affiliated, and expressed the view

that the SCEF is the best organization in the South as far

as doing effective work is concerned and that they have a

better idea of what they are doing, where they are heading,

and influence other organizations for the better.

The second source also advised on June 3, 1966,

that many people who are officials and supporters of the

SCEF, while liberal in their views, are by no means Communists.

APPENDIX

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE

The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York Times"

newspaper contained a

full-page advertisement captioned

"What Is Really Happening In Cuba," placed by the Fair Play

for Cuba Committee (FPCC). This advertisement announced the

formation of the FPCC in New York City and declared the FPCC

intended to promulgate "the truth about revolutionary Cuba" to

neutralize the distorted American press:

"The New York Times" edition of January 11, 1961,

reported that at a hearing conducted before the United States

Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on January 10, 1961,

Dr. Charles A. Santos-Buch identified himself and Robert Taber

as organizers of the FPCC.

ot the rPG. He also e

He also testified he and Taber

obtained funds from the Cuban Government which were applied

toward the cost of the aforementioned advertisement.

On May 16, 1963, a source advised that during the

first two years of the FPCC's existence there was a struggle

between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers Party (SWP)

elements to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby

influence FPCC policy. This source added that during the past

year there had

been a

successful effort by FPCC leadership to

minimiza the role of these and other organizations in the FPCC

so that

their influence as of May, 1963, war merligible.

The SWP has been designated pursuan: to Executive

Order 10450.

On May 20, 1963, a second source rivised that Vincent

"Ted" Tee, FDCC National Office Director, wes then formulating

FPCC policy and had indicated that he had no intention of

permitting FPCC policy to be determined by any other organization.

This source stated that Lee believed that the IPCC should.

"..

advocate resumption of diplomatic relations between Cuba and

the United States and should support the right of

Cubans to manage their revolution without intesierence from

other nations.

Les 21d

not advocate supporti.; the Cuban

revolution per se.

The November 23, 1963, edition of "The New York Times"

reported that Sensic: Thomas J. Dodd of Connecticut had called

FPCC "the chief public relations instrument of the Castro network

in the United States."

It is to be noted that Senator Dodd was

a member of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee which

twice conducted hearings on the FPCC.

VITTEE (CONT' D)

The December 27, 1963, edition of "The New York World

augIam and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-Castro FPCC

seeking to go out of business and

that its prime activity

during its lifetime had been sponsorship of pro-Castro street

rallies and mass picket lines, and the direction of an active

propaganda mill highlighting illegal travel-to-Cuba campaigns.

Its comparatively brief span of life was attributed to mounting

anti-Castro American public opinion, the 1962 Congressional

hearings which disclosed FPCC financing by Castro's United

Natiors Delegation, and ultimately, the bad publicity which

the FPCC received

from disclosure of activities on its behalf

by suspected presidential assassin Lee H. Oswald.

source advised that v.

on February 6y. 96t, the previously mentioned second

had recently remarked that tha

FPCC was dead

and that

there were no plans to organize another

simiiar urganization.

On April 13, 1964, a third source advised that there

had not been any FPCC

activity in many months and that the

FPCC had been

dissolved.

TAIMI HALONEN and THORUN ROBEL were midiy self-

critical about not working for the programs the younger women

were promoting. TAIMI said she was tired after working long

hours on the Seattle conference to be held Saturday, January

20th at Mt, Zion Baptist Church

in Seattle at which

Seattle delegation would report. HALONEN made the observation,

however, that the women working

on the program were all very

experienced leaders and she trusted they would formulate a

satisfactory program.

On Monday, January 15, 1968, the delegates including

the group from Washington State, met at the Union Station in

Washington, D.C.

It was learned here that the instructions

which had been given the day before at the Shoreham Hotel were

evidently for the California

group only, because many California

people had been badiy beaten in previous demonstrations and

they were very cautious and somewhat apprehensive.

The

official pattern was different.

Mimeographed sheets headed

"Jearrette Rankin Brigade - Information and Instructions" were

passed out and

these appeared to be the official instructions.

A reproduction is attached.

"The Washington State delegation was enlarged when a

Masy BACKUP from Tacoma arrived.

RADER said some of the money

usually received

from wealthy contributors had been collected

by Mrs.

$120.00, and wanted someone else to go instead of ZEFRA

(STUDAMIRE) :

RADER defended herself when TAIMI HALONEN criticized

her for bringing ZEFRA along since

ZEFRA is at least six months

~pregnant.

After the demonstration, HEALY and RADER spent much

of the time urging the speakers to include

in their talks some-

thing about the

status of the American Indian. ELLA BAKER from

New York did include a paragraph from the paper the Washington.

State delegation submitted to Congress.

"American Indians and the Struggle for

Peace". It had been

prepared by LONNIE HEALY aithough at its bottom it carried the

notation

RADER, HEALY, and CORR became indignant because the

audience did not give a standing ovation to Mrs. MARTIN L. KING,

Jr. or any of the Negro speakers.

HEALY expressed great dissatisfaction with the

basic organization of the gathering.

She wanted an organi,

zational meeting instead of a raily type meeting which

occurred. HALONEN and ROBEL agreed somewhat. HEALY implied

the whole thing was a waste of her time.

In the workshop section of the meeting, HALONEN

in the legislative action section; HELEN FRENCH and

ELAINE HORSLEY in the electoral campaigns; and HEALY and

CORR in racism.

Here, too, the younger women were very

critical. HEALY, particularly, resented having men as

'resource people" for the group.

a women's congress. TAIMI said she found herself in a

situation that was quite different in that she was working

with a

very broad spectrum of

politically and economically oriented

individuals and it was a real learning experience.. ELAINE

HORSLEY was anxious to get back home and work for peace while

the spirit of JEANNETTE RANKIN was still fresh.

She and

HELEN FRENCH expressed

the view the congress met the needs

of American women in giving a concrete program on which to work.

Seattle and Tacona people were

to meet at the Methodist

Building, 100 Maryland Avenue.

HALONEN,

ROBEL, HEALY, HORSLEY,

and HELEN FRENCH arrived before the appointed time. After about

an hour, EMELIA CASSIDY arrived stating RADER had an eye problem

and would be unable to attend.

Mrs. BACKUP joined the group.

LINDA CORR and ZEFRA were too tired to get up so early.

The

group called on Washington State's Senators JACKSON and MAGNUSON,

but they were not in their offices.

The delegates weren't premitted to carry a nail file,.

reservations to state jurisdiction. In actuality, this rides established

cribal courts and federal jurisdiction. It gives local bigoted authorities

more opportunity to harrass and open the way to termination of our treaties

and in several places resulted in actual loss of land.

It Is as deadly to be an Indian in America as it is to be a soldier

in Viet Nam.

In che three years before 1907, more Indian childien

below the

age of lu had died in this country than the 6,623 U. S. combat casualties of

tle entire Viet Nan War (as of the end of 1960). Most of these were children

beior the age of six.

We pay because we don't know our own history,

The thread of

struggle for self-determination runs through the history

of Indian-Americans.

When a few Indian youth speak of Red Power, the roots go

deep into their history in finding nourishment for this demand. Just as some

Negro leaders today speal of W.E.B. DuBois as having raised the same issue of

identity long before the level of struggle, which is Black Power, arrived.

This struggle has gone on for 400 years.

The Indian people have been sending spokesmen to bring their grievances

and their positions before the power structure of this country for two hundred

years. They have fought in the courts since at least 1330 when the case of

the Cherokee Nation Vs. Georgia tested the ability and the willingness of the

United States to protect an Indian Tribe in its efforts at self-determination.

The Vietnamese war is a continuation of the whole racist war we have

waged against the Indian People. Understanding this is a part of understanding

the Viet Nam war.

We respond to what is happening to Vietnamese children, yet

the Indian people have suffered from the same policy of extermination and

destruction of their identity.

We must unite with the strivings of those who have had to deal with

United States' genocide for 200 years!

We can help to push the United States to ratify the United Nations

Resolution, "Ireaty Against Genocide", that the United States should correct

the history and policy of genicide against the Indian people.

and unconstitutional infringement of their first Menuent Tagio to does

free speech and the right to petition their government for a redress of

grievances.

Upon informing the Capitol Police of their planned march to the Capitol building

to present their petition, the women were threatened with arrest under 40 U.s.C.

193 (a) et. seg. which, after desining the area cousidered Capitol Grounds, states:

"It is forbidden to parade, stand, or move in processions

or assemblages in said United States Capitol Grounds, or to,

display therein any flag, banner, or device designed or

adapted to bring into public notice any party, organization,.

or movement...

The statute further provides that exceptions from these prescriptive provisions

will be made in the discretion of certain Congressional leaders and/or Capitol

Police. The exceptions are allowed on "ocassions of national interest becoming

the congnizance and entertainment of Congress."

The petition of the Jeannette Rankin Brigade apparently does not become "the

entertainment of Congress" and arrests were threatened. Therefore the suit which

was files prays for the convening of a three-judge Federal District Court which

is requested to enjoin the operation and enforcement of the statute and to •

declare it unconstitutional. We have asked the Federal District Court for the

Districtof Columbia to grant us this relief on an emergency basis prior to

January 15th. Our request was denied.

The same request was made to the District

of Columbia Court of Appeals and was likewise denied. As it was then impossible

to obtain relief prior to January 15th the Brigade's attorneys are continuing the

appeal on a non-emergency basis in the Court of Appeals and have every confidence

of ultimate victory.

This is far from the last time that these women or any other Americans intend

to appear in their nation's Capitol to petition their government. Hopefully this

will be the last time that they find it so difficult to do so.

WELFARE HACTS

* 1

corn welfare programs in the United states began with passage of

Sroial Securlty Act---in 1935, authorizing feueral grants to

states for fullic arsistance and child welfare programe.

352937,

the Washington LeGialrturo canialod the Paupers Law of 1654 and

enactea a State Social Security Law. "Welfaiu" nur teen a bone of

contention ever since.

Greenleich Report

In 1963, the Washington Legislature apporriated $20,000 for a stuay

of the state's public assistance programs.

The study was made by

Greenleigh Associates, and the Greenleigh Report was presentod

112

Decembar, 1964.

Tils report stated that public assistance grants in

Washington, with standals based on 1959 prices and

12% ratable reductions, 1? e 40% below the minimum

standards for health and decency.

Speaking of child

welfare needs, the report sald:"There 1s an excessive

and Increasing rate of referral of chilaren to the

Juvenile Courts, both for dependency and delinquency.

There is an excessive and increasing trend for children

to be removed from their natural families and cared

for olsewhere."

WHAI ABOUT RATABLE REDUCTIONS?

The 1965 Legislature removed the ratable reductions. The 196?

Legislature ordered the Dept. of Public Assistance to bring 1t's

pricing standard's up to 1967 levels.

standards were put into effect July first. Increased allowances

for rent vary from county to county. Other allowances were increased

an average of 10-3/4%aIn King County the total increase was 16%.

Thus, king county grants have been increased by 28% since 1964,

but the cost of living has increased by at least 5% Grants are stll

17% less than acceptable levels.

The maximum grant for a Seattle family consisting of

two adults,

a boy 13, and a g1r1 8, 1s $285.80 a

month--$3,429 a year.

But recent changes in the

Federal Social Security Law cast a shadow on even

this figure.

The local welfare officials will not

offer any muens as ta what man hangon porte

NEW FATABLE

REDUCTIONS ARE AIWAYS A POSSIBILITY.

There 1s much talk of getting people off welfare by putting them to

work.

Yet who will take care of the children?

Child care costs from

$60 to $80 per child per month in Seattle.

Some examples of women's wages:

Nurses Aid - $1.40 per hour

On April 17, 1959, a confidential source advised

that on February 12, 1959, a Socialist

Workers Party (SWP)

minority group under the leadership of National Committee

member SAM BALLAN, split from the SWP.

The source stated that this minority groud,

referred to as the Marcyites, after many years of program

and policy differences on varied issues concerning tactics

and interpretation of political events:

split from the swe

grounds that the Party was liquidating itself b

departing from the Marxist precepts of LEON TROTSKY and

retreating from the fight for the world socialist

revolution.

The final issue which ultimately forced the

split was

the minority's opposition to the SWP regroupment

policy which involved cooperation with the Communist Party.

(P) periphery-individuals characterized by the minority

as petty-bourgeois.

the minority program, according to the source,

advocated unconditional defense of the Soviet Union and has

as its goal the building of a revolutionary party with a

complete proletarian orientation for the purpose of overthrowing

capitalism in the United States and throughout the world.

On May 12, 1960, source advised that this minority

group had chosen the name Workers World Party.

• On May 1, 1967, a second confidential source

advised that the Workers World Party, which maintains head- :

quarters at 46 West 21st Street, New

the People's Republic of China in its ideological dispute

with the Soviet Union.

The SWiP and CP have been designated

agency regarding the Brigade was concerned directly with the

January march on Washington and the supporting local demonstration

time andwre of the opinion that the organization as a continuing

use these rallies to further its own recruitment drive.

• SUBJECT: DEMONSTRATIONS, WASHINGTON, D. C., AND

SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, NOVEMBER 20, 1971,

SPONSORED BY THE WOMEN'S NATIONAL ABORTION

ACTION COALITION

This memorandum advises of demonstrations being scheduled in

Washington, D. C., and San Francisco, California, on 11/20/71 to build

public support for the repeal of antiabortion laws.

The Women's National Abortion Action Coalition was formed at a

conference held at Columbia, University, New York City, in July, 1971, which

was attended by approximately 1, 000 women from 29 states. The conference

voted to make a woman's right to abortion a national and political issue.

Subsequent to its formation, the coalition called for demonstrations in

San Francisco and Washington on 11/20/71 to build public support for the

repeal of all antiabortion laws, to protest forced sterilization, and to call

for an end to restrictive contraceptive laws. A source of the Washington

Field Office has advised that the march in Washington is supported by the

Young Socialist Alliance, the youth group of the Socialist Workers Party

(SWP). Carol/Lipman, who is a member of the SWP, is Project Director

of the Washington march.

Coalition leaders in requesting permit for the demonstration have

lestimated that participation in the Washington march will range between

/10, 000 and 20, 000 persons. The Washington Field Office has developed

information that 46 buses have been chartered to bring participants to the

demonstration. Participants will represent some 80 cities. The Metropolitan

Police Department anticipates participation will be in the vicinity of 5,000 persons

REC-23,

Demonstrators are scheduled to assemble at the Ellipse between

10 2.m. and 12 noon and will march via 17th Street to H Street, đown H Street

to 15th Street, down 15th Street to Pennsylvania Avenue, and then east on

¡ Pennsylvania Avenue to the west steps of the Capitol. A rally will be held

at the latter site between 2 and 6 p.m.

RE:

WOMEN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE OF MARYLAND

INTERNAL SECURITY - COMMUNIST

Kretiti

- Aura du a -bride i

On November 13, 1971, a source advised that the

Women's National Abortion Coalition (WONAAC) planned to

hold demonstrations at Washingtön," D. C. and San Francisco,

callIornia on November 20, 19/1.

The purpose of the

demonstrations were to call for the repeal of all abortion,

contraception and forced sterilization laws. '

The "Women's.

Right to Choose of Maryland, the Baltimore, Maryland

affiliate of WONAAC was to organize busing and housing

arrangements for out-of-state women.

On November 22, 1971, a source advised that the

Women's Right to Choose of Maryland, working from 3028

Greenmout Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland, were unsuccessful

in attempts to generate enthusiasm for the WONNAC demonstration

among Baltimore area women.

Therefore, the plan to charter

a bus for the purpose of transporting

demonstrators to the

Washington, D. C. rally was cancelled.

On November 30, 1971, a second source advisea

that the Women's Right to Choose of Maryland had been

formed as an "ad hoc" group for the specific purpose of

supporting the November 20, 1971 Washington, D. C. demonstra-

tion. The source furiner stated that the Women's

Right

to Choose of larylana ceased to exist, following this

demonstration, and 1s now defunct.

A Women's National Abortion Action Coalition

Approximately 1,000 persons were in attendance

at this convention which was held to determine future action

Of WONAAC and to allow diverse factions within the Women's

Abortion Movement to join ranks under one issue.

Female members of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP)

and Young Socialist Alliance (YSA) from all over the county

were requested by the national office of the SWP and YSA

to attend this convention in order to insure the effective

control of the convention by the sip.

"women control their bodies" was

adopted by the women's organization and all other propo-

Massachusetts, February 11-13, 1972.

Approximately 1,300

women attended the conference, which once agair, re-established

and reiterated WONAAC's call for abortion on demand.

conference on

It was

noted during the conference that WONAAC had been unable to

create anything like a national campaign and that local meetings

across the country had been disappointingly small. It was

pointed out that WONAAC had failed to attract the

large numbers

of working women, housewives, and students concerned with the

abortion issue, including the majority of women's liberationists

and abortion reform activists. It was felt that the movement

could not succeed without the support of the working women.

At the close of the conference, WONAAC strongly endorsed

the "Abortion Rights Act of 1972," which is to be introduced in

the U. S. Congress by Congresswonon BELLA

ABZUG from New York.

This bill would override all

laws which impose sanctions upon

those who choose to exercise their individual right to an abortion.

(WF I-1, 2/14/72)

a. Proposed Actions

...

It was moved and adopted during the above conference.

that WONAAC sponsor a week of local abortion activities, May 1-6,

1972, consisting of educational programs, legislative sunport,

judicial action, and culminating in local or regional demonstra-

tions on May 6, 1972, around the demand for redeal of all anti-

abortion laws and restrictive contraception laws and an end to

forced sterilization.

(WF I-1, 2/14/72)

In addition, the following secondary pronosals were

adopted during the conference:

Informants-

For the information of the Bureau and New York,

•advise that there is a

Women's Liberation group at the University of Florida,

Gainesville, Florida, which recently sponsored an

Abortion Action Week

rally, however, none of the

individuals associated with this Women's Lib group are

connected with any subversive organizations such as

Young Socialist Alliance or Socialist Workers Party.

They are merely Women's Liberationists, who support

the repeal of all abortion laws.

In view of the above, no active investigation

is being conducted by the Jacksonville Division of the

Nomen's Liberation group at the University of Florida, as

there is no present indication they are connected and/or

interested in subversive activities.

Re report of ARLAND A. MOSEL dated 3/21/72 at

Washington Field.

The State University of New York at Binghamton

is part of the University system of the State of New York, *

and the University at Binghamton has an enrollment of

approximately 7,500 students.

The student newspaper

published at the University twice weekly during the school

year in its issue of 10/15/71 carried a brief ad in the

classified section as follows: .

"Women who have had abortions needed to relate

their experiences to other women, educate all women

about abortion at abortion

speak out October 21. Contact

Linda L., extention 4130."

The 11/12/71, issue of the "Pipedream"

, student

newspaper published at the State University of New York

at Binghamton, carries an announcement that the Binghamton

Womens Abortion Coalition was selling bus tickets for the

Womens March on Washington for repeal of all abortion laws,

repeal of all contraception laws and no force sterilization

for 11/20/71. Women and men were invited to attend and

tickets were on sale at the student center.

Cars and

volunteers were needed and they were to contact LINDA LOEW

at extention 4129.

INFORMANT

who is familiar with New

Left activities on the campus of the State University

New York at Binghamton was

contacted regularly during

of

the

school year of 1971-72 and he stated that he did see

some signs on bulletin boards in the Fall:of 1971 about

abortion organizations, but never knew them to be of much

success on campus.

He stated that he did not see any

of approximately January, 1972 until school closed in

May, 1972.

This source was contacted 5/16/72. He stated

also at that time that LINdA LOEW has been a close

associate of BETTY, SACHS who is the leader of the foung

Socialist Alliance Chapter on campus at the University.

Informant stated that there was no organization formed

to

his knowledge of a Womens

Abortion Action Coalition in

the Binghamton area.

Other sources familiar with New Left activities

on the campus of the State University of New York at

Binghamton, were contacted during May, 1972, and two

sources advised that they knew of no organization of

Womens Abortion Action Coalition on the campus or in the

Binghamton vicinity during the past year.

Albany Division has had an investigation pending

on LINDA LOEW and a report is being written with appropriate

recommendation for administrative action on LINDA LOEW.

In view of the lack of activity of an Abortion Coalition

organization in the Binghamton area, no further investigation

is being conducted by Albany•

Synopsis:

Informants advised the Boston Women's Abortion Action

Coalition (BOWAAC), the local affiliate of the Women's

National Abortion Action Coalition (WONAAC), was formed

during the late summer, 1971, out of the local-Female

Liberation (FL) group.

Its headquarters is located at

552 Masa. Avenue, Cambridge. BOWAAC is Fot a formal

membership group

but there are approximately a total

of 20-25 females regularly involved in the group's work.

The Young Socialist Alliance of Boston (ESA-B) and the

Socialist Workers Party (SWP), 'Boston faction within

BOWBAC, which comprises abouc

half of the activists,

were the controlling force. However, recent reports

indicate this faction has apparently alicnated itself

from other activists and door not nor bailova BONAAC

can be built into a successful supporter group for the

YSA and SWP locally.

November 17, 1971

BOWLAC was originally a subconnittee of FL

in the Greater Boston Area but as of Jenuary, 1972, had

grown into a separate group whose specific interest was

in abortion reform. Individuals active in BOWAAC are

also active in other FL work; however, all individuals

active in Ft work are not active in BOWAAC, with BOWAAC

being the smaller of the two groups.

January 12, 1972

WONSAC has been publicly deccribed

as an organization at groups whose

aim

During early March, 1972, TOBA SINGER reported

that at an increasing rate abortion vik was becoming a

more important area of work than Fl and that a

number of SWP and YSA female members were being trans

ferred into the abortion work.

The stress of the SHP/YSA femalo members in the

general Boston area who are active in female matters con-

tinues to be away from Fl and into BONAAC with only two

or three remining on the fringes to follow FL activities.

May 10, 1972

Recent reports concerning SWP/YSA faction work

within BOWAAC disclose that, as previously occured with

the Party's work within Fl, those in the Party faction

have apparently alicnated themselves from the other

females active in BOWAAC and for the most part love lost

any support from others not in the Party faction.

Any

suggestions now offered by those of the Party faction in.

.: :

BOWWAG, which comprises approximately half of the activista

in the

group, are no longer accepted, cause considerable

argument and there is evidence of "red baiting"

• As a

result, the Party faction does not now believe that they

can -build. BOWAC into any successful supporter type

organization as had resulted through Party work in the

Student Mobilization Committee (SMC).

The "Boston Globe"

, a daily newspaper published

in Boston, in its February 13, 1972. edition, carried an

article entitled "Abortion Strategy Discussed" which in

part reported that more than 800 women fron across the

country had gathered for a conference at Boston University

the weekend of February 11-13, 1972 to plan a strategy

to win repeal of all laws that prohibit abortion. Accord-.

ing to the article, it was expected thut the conference

would endorse the latest Federal bill to nullify all

state laws restricting abortion • "The Abortion Rights

Act of 1972"

, to be introduced by United States Congresse

woman BELLA ABZUG from New York. The article reported

that discussion at the conference had centered

around

•or to focus on a

single issue - repeal of the abortion laws. It further

reported that & proposal was presented for an Abortion

Action Week, May 1 to 6, 1972, to incluce educational prom

grams: legislative support, judicial action and local or

regional denonstrations centering around the demand for

repeat

ot all anti-abortion and anti-contraception laws

and an end to forced sterilization.

JANE ROIAND, identified in tue article as

coordinator of BORAAC,

ras reported to have stated that

whatever the conference does nationally her organization

would be acting at the local level,

The Febiary 13, 1972, session of the WONAC

Conference at Boston University was in the form of

workchops held in approximately eight classroons with

The workshops primarily related to the building of HONAÀC

throughout the United States, fund raising and regional

to strengthen

Re :

National Momen's Political Caucus (NNPC)

Policy Council Meeting

Source, who has furnished reliable information in the

past, provided the following information on July 3, 1972:

A Policy Council Meeting of the National Women's

Political Caucus

(NVPC) was held in Mashinaton, D.C. during

the period June 24, 1972 - June 25, 1972.

The NVPC is a legitimate, loosely-knit, open

organization of politically motivated women

seeking equal recognition

in the American

community.

During the Policy Council Meeting there were no

overt attempts by any organized group to influence the policy

meeting and there were no individuals present who identified

themselves as members of any organization which might be construed

as subversive and/or supporting any cause except legitimate

change.

Of significance, however, was the fact that literature

of the Women's National Abortion Action Coalition (WONAAC) was

present in brochures and pamphlets located throughout the reeting

area.

All of the WONAAC material was geared to the abortion

movement and specifically the MONAAC conference scheduled for

Hunter College, New York, July 15 - 16, 1972..

WONAAC was founded in July, 1971. for the purpose of

forming a national movement of groups scattered

throughout the United States who favor and

now work to legalize abortion.

The Young Socialist

Alliance (YSA) and Socialist Forkers Party (SWP)

are playing a major role in moNANC.

The SWP has been designated pursuant to

Executive Order 10450.

## Page 1618

Rẹ: NWPC Policy Council Meeting

As the youth organization of the SWP, the

YSA serves as the main source of recruitment into

that organization.

The YSA is described in the

masthead of its official publication, "The Young

Socialist Organizer,"

"a multinational

revolutionary socialist youth organization."

During the council meeting on June 24, 1972, Mary

Clarke, who is associated with the Southern California PC,

an affiliate of the NWPC, advised a group of policy council

members that WOMAAC had been using the Southern California WPC

name as an endorser of WONAAC. Clarke also stated that MONAAC

had passed out propaganda at a caucus rally in California and

were very effective at taking control of small gatherings:

The Chairwoman from Nassau County in New York, whose

name was not

recalled, defended WONAAC stating that "they were

a good groupl

This

woman's position was not supported and,

in general, WONAAC literature was not accepted bu those persons

present.

Jill Ruckelshaus, a new member of the Policy Council,

is reportedly concerned about the SWP's

attempts

to align

itself with the abortion movement and will be using her newly

gained position to fight SWP attempts at control of local

WPC groups.

The NHPC organizing brochure nuhlished by the NiPC

has been written to assist individual MPC groups in organizing.

The brochure lists political parties and para-political

organizations

to be contacted bv caucus organizers when forming

the nucleus of a WPC. Among those listed was the SWP. After

discussions at the caucus it was determined that the sWP should

be removed from the list. The new edition of the NPC organizina

brochure will not list the SWP; it has been replaced by National

Peace Action Coalition (NPAC) .

The NPAC was

founded in 1970 by members of the SUP.

Its basic objective is to unite masses of people

including labor unions, GIs, and the black

community in the struggle to end United States

intervention in Southeast Asia through orderly and

peaceful tactics.

PHILADELPHIA WOMEN'S NATIONAL

ABORTION ACTION COALITION

PH T-I advised on May 25, 1972, that women United for

Abortion Rights (WUAR), 1115 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, Pa.,

telephone WA-2-0381, 1s the local affiliate of Women's National

Abortion Action Coalition (WONAAC) and

that about two weeks ago

WAR decided to change their name from WUAR to Philadelphia Women's

National Abortion Action Coalition (Philadelphia WONAAC) and that

they intended to utilize the same office space at 1115 Walnut

Street and the same telephone number.

PH T-1 added that this

change was made inasmuch as the name WUAR was found to be unwieldy

and awkward and that it did not convey the group's affiliation with

WONAAC as well as the new name Philadelphia WONAAC.

An article In "The Sunday Bulletin," Section 2, pages

band T, issue o1 october 31, 1911, listed the various candidates

for political office in the City of Philadelphia in connection with

which reflected that as of that time the Coordinator of WUAR

tIme SAMARA/JAROSH was a

member of the SWP.

PH T-1 advised on May 25, 1972 that it 1s difficult

to determine the actual degree of

SwP participation In the affairs

Of WONAAC in the Philadelphia area and

that he was not aware of

any information which would reflect that Philadelphia WONAAC was

substantially controlled by the SWP. Source explained that the

abortion rights issue had frequently been discussed at many of the :

recent public forum type meetings sponsored by the Philadelphia

SWP and held at the Philadelphia SWP Headquarters at 1004 Filbert

Street in Philadelphia.

The discussions held on the abortion

rights issue indicated

that the swe felt that the capitalistic

system had used the dual issues of abortion and women's liberation

to keep women in a position of inferiority, whereas the socialistic

system being promoted by the SWP would be in favor of abortion and

women's liberation, and WONAAC would therefore naturally attract

members of the SWP

to their organization.

"That the Natlonal Office of WONAAC pledged

time It raises sufficient capital to maintain the dally

Confidential source number two related that the

evening plenary session of WONAAC occurred on July 15, 1972,

and it was immediately apparent that the socialist

workers Party - Young Socjalist Alliance (SWP-YSA) group

dominated the meeting. Independent women who wanted to make

statements during this session were voted down by SWP floor

leaders and these

same persons continued to vote as a

• bloc

on all issues.

The group of independent women from various geogra-

phic areas, that is those women who were not associated with the

SWP or YSA, went together after the plenary session was aujourned

and considered the problem of how to handle tne Sw leaders.

While these women were not political realists in their goals,

they did believe in working throughout the existing system

rather than functioning with the SWP in their eventual goal.

of revolution.

It was decided that the independent feminists would

no longer continue hassling within WONAAC.

They did not want

to have decisions for them being structured by a male dominates

group.

They also decided that money being collected by WONAAC

in the name of abortion law change was not being used for that

purpose, but rather to sustain members of the SWe-YSA.

The sunday morning session, July 16, 1972, was

labeled "Meeting to Discuss

Internal Hassles.

About 35

Independents attended and a few number of SWP-YSA members and

sympathizers were present.

Independents there were from New

Haven, Boston,.

Detroit, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and

San Francisço.

The independents did not waiver in their firm opposition

tO SUP-YSA COntrol di WONAAC. Six national coordinators of

the afternoon plenary session.

They also decided to combat

N.y

There were approximately 700-800 women in attendance.

at the afternoon session.

According to one of the SWP

leaders, these women were from 31 states and three countries-

Canada,

Italy and Sweden.

The states that had more representation

than others were Ohio, Illinois, New York, and Massachusetts.

Most of the problems and differences between the

independents and the SWP centered around approaches to abortion

law reform.

The SwP was charged with always having demonstra-

tions and callies and never doing any work through the legis

Lative process.

The independents stated that they were tired of this

hassle and that they believed there were more effective ways

to change abortion laws

than carrying placards in the streets.

After the independent women publicly resigned in

front of the plenary session, two other coordinators announced

they were staying on. One was Barbara Roberts, the other's

name is unknown.

Linda Jenness made a final plea for the independent

women to reconsider. The removal of the independents from WONAAC

has debilitated the organization and most independent representa-

tives will be going back to their own cities to work for abortion

The concern still exists, however, that WONAAC Will

there is also the concern that

women new to the movement will

join in a mistaken notion that they will be furthering

abortion law reform.

Independents vowed before leaving New York that

they would try to publicize activities from

the SwP in an

effort to prevent this.

As the youth organization of the Socialist

Workers Party (SVP);

the YsA serves as the

main source of recruitnent into that organ

The YSA is described in the masthead

of its official publication, "The Young

The SWP has been designated pursuant

ReAL letter to New York, dated 0/30/72, wherein

Albany asked to be advised of any active investigation being

conducted pe WONAAC, or if any active investigation is

warranted by Albany, FBI.

For the information of the Albany Division, the

New York olfice is the olice of orign, concerning captioned

organization. The Bureau has advised that as the socialist

Workers Party and the Young Socialist Alliance play a major

roll in WONAAC throughout the United States,

and inasmuch

as information has been provided that WONAAC is, for the

most part, totally controlled by socialist Workers Party/

Young socialist Alliance,

the activities of this aganization

should be followed, for

the purpose of determining the

extent of influence and control: by individuals who are

members of Socialist Workers Party/ Young Socialist Alliance,

and who are acting on behalf of these organizations.

Based upon Bureau instructions, in light of

information set forth in referenced Albany letter, concerning

DIANESPARRY, an Socialist Workers Party organizer in the

Utica, New York area, and her reported communication with

national headquarters of WONAAC in New York City.

It would

appear advisable for the Albany Division to institute such

investigation,

as it deems appropriate to ascertain the extent

of Socialist

Workers Party/Young Socialist Alliance activity

in its division in connection with WONAAC.

The Young Socialist Alliance-Twin Cities

Group is the Youth Branch of the Twin Cities

Branch-Socialist Workers Party (TCB-SHO), an

atIlllate of the socialist Workers Party (SWP).

As the youth organization of the Socialist

Workers Party (SWP), the Young Socialist Alliance

(YSA) serves as the main source of recruitment

into that organization.

The YSA is described. in

the masthead of its official publication,

"The

Young Socialist Organizer, " as "A multinational

revolutionary socialist youth organization."

The MWAAC rally held May 6, 1972, began at the

residence of the governor of the State of Minnesota,

1006

Summit Avenue, St. Paul, Minnesota, at approximately 3:30P.M.

and proceeded

to the State Capitol

Building where the rally

calling for the repeal of all abortion laws and emphasizing

the demand for the right to legal abortions was held. The

rally was held without incident and speakers identified

included representatives from the YSA-TCG and the TCB-SWP.

Jane Van Deusen was the principle speaker for the MWAAC

at this rally which ended at approximately 5:30 P.M.

decided that an International Tribunal was planned for

October 21, 1972.

The International Tribunal would be

held in New York City, New York, and it was hoped that

plans could be made for a local tribunal scheduled to be

held October 13, 1972, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, after

which individuals would be designated

to attend

• inter-

national meeting scheduled for New York City. This July,

1972, meeting was the first activity on the part of the

MWAAC as anen organized effort following the May 6, 1972,

rally.

MP T-l on

August 9, 1972

Individuals known to be involved in the women's

liberation movement in the Twin Cities area of Minneapolis

and

St. Paul, Minnesota, have, during the past six months,

shown

little or no interest in the organization known as the

MWAAC.

Former leaders in the women's liberation movement

have become aware of the SWP influence among the leaders of

the group, and have adopted a hands off policy from active

participation in the affairs of this group. While the

May 6, 1972, rally in St. Paul, Minnesota,

was attended by

some

• 200 individuals, their attendance was considered to be

due to individual interest in the abortion issue.

MP T-2 on

August 17, 1972

SWP INFLUENCE

The MWAAC is not a committee of the TCB-SWP, nor

is it a part of the YSA-TCG.

Women's liberation is a topic

of

general interest and concern to the membership of the

TCB-SWP, and the anti-abortion standard taken by MWAAC is

one aspect of the women's liberation movement of continued

interest.

The anti-abortion, or so called legal abortion

movement, is one aspect of this women's liberatión movement

which continues to be of concern to members of the YSA-TCG,

both male and female.

While the vast majority of women in

the State of Minnesota support either the repeal or changes

in present state laws on abortion, supporters of this repeal

or change also include professional women, medical doctors,

lawyers, municipal court judges, and individuals from all

in New York City (NYC), details of which will be set out

more fully hereinafter.

As the youth organization of the

SWP, the

YSA sErVes as

the main

source of recruitment into that

organization.

The YSA is described

in the masthead of its official

publication, "The Young Socialist

Organizer", as "a Multi-National

Revolutionary Socialist Youth

Organization"

The SWP has been designated pur-

suant to Executive Order 10450.

ORGANIZATIONAL DATA

A. Origin and Scope

NY T-2 on July 21, 1971, and NY I-3 on October 1,

1971, furnished information that over 1,000 women met in

conterence at Columbia University, NYC, NY, on July 1o;

1971, through July 18, 1971, to form a National Movement

of independent groups scattered throughout the United

States (US) who favored and had worked to legalize abortion.

As a result of this conference, WONAAC was founded.

B. Aims and Purposes

In the WONAAC national newsletter, dated September 16,

1971, WONAAC was self-described as a nationally coordina-

ted abortion law repeal campaign including legislation,

legal action, and nationally coordinated mass demonstrations

in Washington, DC, and San Francisco, on November 20, 1971,

for the repeal of all anti-abortion laws and corollary

demands of no forced sterilization, and the repeal of all

restrictive contraception laws.

WONAAC claims to reach

all women, black; Chinaca; Latina; Asian; Puerto Rican;

native American women; campus women; gay women; high

school women; housewives; professional, welfare, and

working women; young women; women from churches, political

organizations, trade unions, the military, and communities

across the country.

C. Headquarters

On November 22, 1972, a Special Agent (SA) of

the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), utilizing a

pretext, contacted

an individual self-identified as CAROL

EATON at telephone number 675-9150, located at 150 5th

Avenue, NYC, NY.

EATON, who stated she is currently a

National Staff member of WONAAC, advised that the National

and NY Staffs of WONAAC are headquartered at this address:

D. When Meetings Held

According to CAROL EATON, regular NY Coalition

meetings of WONAAC are held every other Wednesday evening

at Religious Center at New York University, 2 Washington

Square North, NYC, NY. EATON stated that most MY State

staff members are present at these meetings and at least

one or more National Staff members also try to be in

attendance.

Other than this, state and national staffs

meet periodically, as business demands.

E. Officers

EATON identified the following individuals as

current officers of WONAAC:

National Staff

SUSAN LAMONT

National Coordinator

CAST NIKATEON

NY State Staffl121:

Coordinator

(MARILY MARKUS

## Page 1669

NY 100-174481

F. Membership and Finances

According to EATON, WONAAC does not maintain a

formal membership, as such,

and financially exists only

through voluntary contributions.

She stated that all

staff members, National and NY State, serve on a voluntary

basis, receive no salary, and get only a small "subsistance

allowance" which the staff has found necessary to supplement

with their own personal funds in order to get by.

G. WONAAC Affiliates

CAROL EATON stated there are presently 36 WONAAC

affiliates, also called "coalitions" throughout the US, and

that most states of the union are represented by an affiliate

or coalition.

11.

YSA-SWP INFLUENCE AND CONTROL

OVER WONAAC

NY T-1 provided information on July 22, 1971,

that the First National Womens Abortion Conference was

held at Columbia University, NYC, NY, from July 16, 1971,

to July 18, 1971, which resulted

in the founding of WONAAC.

NY T-l stated that it was immediately apparent that this

conference was taken over and influenced by YSA-SWP members

who infiltrated the various conference committees and

no infiltrated

workshops which were established to help formulate the

main direction the Coalition would follow in the future.

NY I-l stated that it seemed certain the YSA-SWP would,

in the future, dictate policy for this organization and

would be able to control the utilization of WONAAC funds.

On August 5, 1971, NY I-4 provided a leaflet

captioned, "What Every Woman Should Know"

This leaflet,

which was

published by Feminist Organization for Communi-

cation:; Action and Service (F.O.C.A.S.), related the following:

"The Womens

National Abortion Coalition

has

oeen called and organized by the SWP and its affiliate,

-he YSA, Including women supposedly representing Women's

Liberation groups, who in truth represent, first, the

4

NW 88321 Docld:32989546 Page 293

## Page 1670

NY 100-174481*

SWP and YSA. These women attach more importance to their

political movement than to the Women's Liberation Movement.

And when 77% of the women in this country are for reform

of abortion laws, there is fertile soil for a political:

party to build itself on.

The SWP/YSA realizes this and

is taking advantage of it."

On August 5, 1971, a leaflet

captioned "F.0.C.A.s." revealed

in part as follows:

"A nucleus of about eight feminists

have formed FOCAS, Feminist

Organization for Communication,

Action and Service.

FOCAS evolved

from the Women's Strike Coalition

(WSC), which the Socialist Workers

Party abruptly abandoned on May

25th in order to form the committee

for WONAAC. Since that time a

nucleus of women from WSC together

with like-minded feminists pre-

served the WSC in order to main-

tain and expand a multi-issue

action-oriented Women's Libera-

tion coalition in the NYC area.

Assisted by loans from supporting

feminists, the new WSC paid

back nearly a thousand of the •

three thousand dollars of debts

incurred by the SWP women who

had controlled the old wSc.

The "Militant" issue of August 6, 1971, page five,

in an article

entitled, "Abortion Campaign Counters Red-

Baiting", revealed in part, with respect to the founding

WONAAC conference in July, 1971:

"The Militant" is a weekly news~

paper of the SWP.

NY I-5 advised on November 12, 1971, that à NY

Planning Meeting Of WONAAC was held at LOEB Student Center,

NY University, NY, on November 11, 1971, to lay plans

for a scheduled November 20, 1971

demonstration in Washington,

DC.

According to this source, this meeting was completely

dominated and controlled by members of the SWP..

NY T-6 related on November 16, 1971, that the Upper

West Side Branch of the YSA planned to send a

• contingent

of its members to Washington, DC, on November 20, 1971;

in order to participate in the planned demonstration there

on that date.

NY T-6 stated that practically all the members of the

uptown branch of the YSA, NY, were expected to participate

in this activity.

NY I-5 related on January 20, 1972, that the scheduled

November 20, 1971 march in Washington was

"crucial" to

all SWP and

YSA branches in that it afforded an opportunity

for selling of "The Militant"

and other SWP/YSA literature,

and

also afforded an opportunity for "intervening " in the

action via distribution of SWP Election Campaign literature.

NY T-8 on February Il, 1972, and NY I-9 and NY I-10

on February 14, 1972, provided information that a WONAAC

convention was held February 11, 1972, to February 13, 1972,

at Hayden Hall, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts.

"How to Win

Abortion Law Repeal". NY I-8 stated that approximately

30 members of the YSA or SWP Boston Chapters were observed.

in attendance at this convention.

NY I-7 related on February 14, 1972, that because of the

de-escalation of the Vietnam War by the NIXON

Administration,

the YSA-New York Local (NYL), while continuing on with

anti-war work through the NY

Student Mobilization

NY 100-174481

Committee (SMC)

and NY National Peace Action Coalition

(NPAC), both of which organizations they dominate, would

also concentrate in the area of the Women's Liberation

Movement through their influence in WONAAC:

The SMC is controlled by the

SWP and its youth affiliate,

YSA.

SMC initiates and supports

public demonstrations against

the war in Southeast Asia.

NPAC was founded in 1970 by

members of the sWP.

Its objec-

tive is the immediate, total

and unconditional withdrawal

of all US forces and material

in Southeast Asia.

NY I-T advised on various dates, March 23, 1972,

through October 17, 1972, that activities of WONAAC were

dutifully reported

and included on the agenda at regular

meetings of the Upper West Side Branch, YSA-New York Local

(NYL) during that period.

NY T-5 advised on April 18, 1972, that the leader-

ship of WONAAC was then dominated by the SWP.

NY T-7 related on July 7, 1972, that at a WONAAC

meeting held June 27, 1972, at 706 Broadway, NYC, NY,

starting at 6:40 PM, it was announced that even though

VONAAC previously had accused various

female activists

working along with them in the Women's Liberation struggle

of red baiting because of the stand they had taken against

the SWP-Young Socialist Alliance (YSA), at present they

are forced to work with these individuals to help strengthen

the WONAAC cause.

At this meeting, certain WONAAC staff members

walked out and voiced their disapproval of the meeting

being taken over by a majority of SWP-YSA members.

They indicated that the SWP-YSA has no right to be in a

policy-making position in WONAAC.

## Page 1673

NY 100-174481

NY I-7 on. July 18, 1972, and NY I-ll on July 19,

1972, provided information that a WONAAC conference was

held

at Hunter College, Park Avenue and 69th Street on

July 15, 1972 and July 16, 1972.

NY I-7 stated that NYC was picked as the site of

this convention because this city is considered to be

the center of the most powerful anti-abortion effort so'far.

Discussionsheld at this conference centered on

plans for (one)-future activity in the campaign to repeal

all anti-abortion and contraception laws and (two)-to

end forced sterilization.

A discussion was held concerning the attacks

being made by the Catholic Church Hierarchy and other

anti-abortion groups against women's rights to their own

bodies.

NY I-ll related that the evening plenary session

of WONAAC occurred on July 15, 1972, and it was immediately

apparent that the SWP-YSA groups dominated the meeting:

Independent women who wanted to make statements during

this session were voted down by SWP floor leaders and

these same persons continued to vote as a block on all

issues.

The group of independent women from various

geographic areas, that is, those women who were not

associated with the SWP Or YSA, went together after the

plenary session was adjourned and considered the problem

of how to handle the SWP leaders.

While these women

were not political realists in their goals, they did

believe in working throughout the existing

system rather

than functioning with the SWP in their eventual goal of

revolution.

It was decided that the independent feminists

would no longer continue hassling within WONAAC.

did not want to have decisions for them being structured

by a male dominated group.

They also decided that money

being collected by WONAAC

change was not being used for that purpose, but rather

to sustain

members of the SWP-YSA.

The sunday morning session, July 16, 1972, was

labeled "Meeting to Discuss

Internal Hassles.

Aböut 35

independents attended and a few number of SWP-YSA members

and sympathizers were present. Independents there were

from New Haven, Boston, Detroit, New York (NY), Chicago,

Philadelphia, and San

Francisco.

The independents did not waiver in their firm

opposition to SWP-YSA control of WONAAC. Six national

coordinators of WONAAC were independents and decided to

resign publicly at the afternoon plenary session.

They

also decided to combat SWP control of the feminist move-

ment through the various publications.

Pr

_The six national coordinators who resigned were

JUDYSIPHERS, San Francisco: ANN Cy DAVIDSON, Philadelphia:

ROSE WEBER, NX: VICKIXESLINGER, Columbia, South Carolina;

NANCEKROLE, NY: ANd ELLENESHAPIRO, NY.

There were approximately 700-800 women in atten-

dance at the afternoon session.

According to one of the

SWP leaders, these women were from 31 states and three

countries-Canada, Italy and Sweden.

The states that had

more representation than others were Ohio, Illinois, New

York and Massachusetts.

Most of the problems and differences between the

independents and the SWP centered around approaches to

abortion law reform. The SWP was charged with always

having demonstrations and rallies and never doing any

work through the legislative process.

The independents stated that they were tired of

this hassle and that they believed there were more eI-

fective ways to change abortion laws than carrying placards

in the

streets.

After the independent women publicly resigned in

they were staying /on.

One was BARBAR# ROBERTS, the other's

name is unknown.

Mu?.

BER OF SUDEOT CHUABEEEZION

LINDA-JENNESS made a final plea for the indepen-

dent women to reconsider.

The removal of the independents

from WONAAC has debilitated the organization and most

independent representatives will be going back to their

own cities to work for abortion law change in organizations

which have no connection with the SWP.

The concern still exists, however, that WONAAC will

be able to collect monies in the name of abortion reform

and there is also the concern that women new to the move-

ment will join in a mistaken notion that they will be

furthering abortion law reform.

Independents vowed before leaving Ny that they

would try to publicize activities from the SWe in an

effort to prevent this.

III. OBSERVATION OF CURRENT NATIONAL

STAFF MEMBER REGARDING YSA/SWP INFLUENCE

When contacted under pretext on November 24,

1972, CAROL EATON, self-identified as a current National

Staff member, and previously mentioned in this report,

inception.

EATON, while

she is definitely not a

acknowledged

in WONAAC.

She went on to

state, however, that WONAAC

has never allied itself politically with any organization

or individual, including any of the political candidates

in the recent political election and, despite its diverse

makeup

as too ideological beliefs of its membership,

WONAAC is basically an organization which strives only

to the objectives for which it was originally founded.

To this end, she went on, WONAAC would accept help from

whatever source offered.

10

NW 88321 Docld:32989546 Page 299

---

## Page 1676

NY 100-174481

EATON admitted there were some problems in

the past with regard to friction within WONAAC about SWP

and YSA influence.

She stated, however, this matter, to

her observation, never seemed a serious one,

and is quite

minimal today.

With regard to the "walk out" of six

national coordinators at the July, 1972 conference in NYC,

she stated the walk out did not occur, in fact, because

of the SWP/YSA influence question, but rather because

those who walked out believed WONAAC should be a "referral

agency", while those who stayed felt it should not.

referral agency, EATON stated she means an agency which would refer

callers to a specific location or place where abortions

could be obtained.

IV. PLANNED PROJECTS

CAROL EATON advised that WONAAC plans an inter-

national Tribunal march to be held in NYC, NY, from March 9,

1972, to March 11, 1972. She stated plans have not yet been

finalized, including the exact location or site this event

will take

place.

However, she noted that sIMonE, BEAUVOIR,

ERNE

a Parisian, well known in the Women's Liberation Movement,

would be honorary chairwoman.

(00: NY)

Re New York letter to the Bureau, 6/6/72; Bureau 0-7

to New York, 7/12/72; and Philadelphia letter to the Bureau,

2/28/73.

As outlined in referenced New York letter, the

New York Office noted, as far back as June, 1972, it

recognized that, although several leaders

of WONAAC were

known to be SWP members,

their activities, as pertaining

"IONAAC, had been directed toward the legal

repeal of all

restrictive abortion laws, and investigation had disclosed

no indication that WONAAC, as an organization, had engaged in

any subversive or vidence

prone activity.

Referenced Bureau O-7, referencing the aforementioned

communication, nevertheless instructed that the New York Office,

as office of origin, had overall responsibility for captioned

organization, and directed the New York Office to reopen its

case and submit semi-annual reports:

A review of the results of the continuing investigation

Of WONAAC, together with all indices and references pertaining

thereto,

since June 1972, reflects no apparent change in the

activities or the organization or its membership from that

outlined above.

The New York Office is in accord with the view of the

Philadelphia Division, as set forth in its referenced letter,

that WONAAC represents basically a social change vehicle which,

despite disparate political views of its leaders and membership,

deals with the single issue of abortion rights!

In view of instructions set forth in Bureau

memorandum 10-73, dated 3/6/73, paragraph G, wherein the

Bureau reiterated its policy that the FBI has no interest

in individuals and organizations involved in legitimate

dissent and the recent United States Supreme Court decision

upholding the right to abortion, It appears continued

investigation of WONAAC as such

is not justified.

The New York Office further concurs with the

Philadelphia view that continued investigati on of the SWP

and/or YSA would produce the desired coverage and information

concerning its members who are associated or active in WONAAC.

UACB, the New York Office is closing the investigation

of this organization.

RePElet 2/28/73.

The Wonen's National Abortion Action Coalition (HONAAC)

has been the subject of a separate investigation by the Bureau

in nunerous offices.

In referenced letter, Philadelphia pointed

out that WONAAC represents a basic social change dealing with

abortion rights and that in view of the lact the U,S. Supreme

Court upheld the right of abortion, the continued investigation

DE WONAAC at this time does not appear to be desirable and

should be discontinued. Philadelphia also suggested that

continued investigation of the Socialist Workers Party (SYP)

and its youth group, the Young socialist Alliance (YSA), should

determine pertinent activities of WONAAC.

After careful consideration of this matter, the Bureau

agrees with the observations of the Philadelphia Office that the

investigation of VONAAC should be discontinued,

However, in view

of the fact that wONAAd is doninated and controlled by the swe, a

trotskyise communist organization Cited by the Actorney General

pursuant to Executive Order 10450, it is the responsibility of the

Bureau to investigate and repori pertinent intornation relating

to the extent of SWP donination and control of captioned

organization.

Therefore, recipients should close separate

investigations concerning MONAAC.

In the future, report above-

described infornation regarding WONAAC under appropriate subheading

in the SHp semiannual organizational reports.

"Women March on

Washington! This article reflected, in part; as follows:

"Out of the outrage against the war that was the unifying

force of the Ann Arbor conference, the women's caucus decided

to channel our frustration into a

public statement calling for

& women's march on Washington, D.C. on April 10.

We all felt

the urgency to show how we as women feel oppressed by the same

U.s. system that needs the dominance of men over women, white

over black, brown and, yellow, heterosexual over nomosexual, and

over poor to support the aggressive war policy that is killing

or Vietnamese sisters and brothers.------

"We are making this march one step in showing the

world our solidarity. as women with all our sisters in Vietnam

who are fighting for their lives. The Committee to Defend the

Right to Live, a south Vietnamese women's organization, has

called for our support."

The confidential source mentioned above on March

15, 1971, furnished information that on March 11, 1971, a

"women's meeting"

was held at Washington Square Methodist

church, I3y west

Women's National March

dated March 16, 1971.

On March 24, 1971, a source, who has furnished

reliable information in the

1971, a "committee for April 10%, advised that on March 22,

held a meeting at the Law

Commune Office, 640 Broadway, New York City (NYC), which

was attended by 30 to 40 females. It was learned

that a

woman from the New York (NY) group was already in Washington,

D.C. working with others

there to arrange permits, speakers,

et cetera, for the womens march on the Pentagon on April 10,

1971. It was stated that it was easier to obtain a permit

for a march from the Justice Department to the Pentagon,

than Irom the pentagon to the Justice department, but that

no permit had been obtained as yet.

It was pointed out that

a march from the pentagon to the Justice Department was

preferred as there would be less chance of losing marchers

en route to the Justice Department than from marching

from the Justice Department to the Pentagon. It was stated

that no buses had been chartered at NY, but it was hoped that

15 buses would be needed.

Law Commune

On September 16, 1969, a second

past, advised that the law Commune is not an

organization in the usual sense of the word.

It is rather a law firm comprised of a group

of lawyers interested and sympathetic to the

New Left and Black Power organizations, and who

counsel and defend individuals in these groups

as the occasion arises.

They likewise permit

their premises to be used on occasion as a meeting

place for these organizations and distribute

some of their literature.

On March 25, 1971, the second advised that as of

now there is much confusion

over the mechanical aspects of

the Women's National March on April 10, 1971, and that the

people in Washington, D.C. will make the ultimate decision

regarding the route of the march.

The source stated that

in It, information concerning buses for washingion, D.C.

will be available at the Upper West Side Women's Center,

627 Amsterdam Avenue, NYC, telephone number 874-6696.

on March 24, 1971, the second source made available

a piece of literature

sent out by the "April 10 Women's

Committee" concerning the national women's march on the

Pentagon on April 10. This literature contained in part as

follows:

"We are going to the pentagon on April 10 to

serve notice on our enemies that women are moving against

them.

our urgency and our fury at the expansion of the

Indochinese war and our rage at the repression of our black

and brown sisters and brothers needs expression right now.

We are joining with other women to struggle for the everyday

things we need and against whatever and whoever prevents us

from getting them.

"We need and want our sisters around the country

to build for this action in their own ways, and to communicate

with other sisters their ideas,

suggestions and criticisms.

This is a temporary contact list which came out of the Ann

Arbor Conference:

APPENDIX

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

Students for a Democratic Society, commonly

known as SDS, came into existence at a founding convention

held during June, 1962, at Port Huron, Michigan. From an

initial posture of "participatory democracy," Marxist-

• Leninist ideology of various shadings became predominant

during 1968-1969 with debate centering on how best to create

a revolutionary youth movement. SDS moved from involvement

in the civil rights struggle to an anti-Vietnam war position

to advocacy of a militant anti-imperialist line linking up

the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America

with the black liberation movement in the United States.

All major factions within SDS embrace Marxism-Lenism

and identify internationally with China, Cuba and North

Vietnam

as countries leading the worldwide struggles

against the United States.

However, the Soviet Union

was regarded as imperialist ind with the Communist Party,

United States of America,

"Irvisionist" in nature.

SDS operated under

a national constitution which

called for an annual Nationa

Convention (NC) and quarterly

National Council meetings wherein programs were initiated

and debated.

Three national

officers were elected

annually

with a National Interim Committee to run the organization.

Regional offices and college chapters elected delegates to

the national meetings but each functioned

independently on

local matters.

Its official publicition "Fire" (formerly

"New Left Notes") last appeared in ecember, 1969.

Internal factionalism of serious proportions

developed during 1968 - 1969 and te following three factions

evolved as a result of a split at he June, 1969, NC:

Weatherman, Worker Student Alliance (WSA), and Revolutionary

Youth Movement (RYM) •

effect of

the split on SDS chapters

throughout the country was divisive.

Some aligned with one

or the other of the three major factions.

Others, unable to

identify with any faction, disassociated with SDS

completely

and changed names.

The SDS national office in recent years was

located at 1608 West Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois. It

was closed in February, 1970.

WEATHIERMAN

APPENDIX

Initially called the "iction Faction," Weatherman

came into being immediately before

the

June, 1969, Students

for a Democratic Society (SDS) liational Convention (NC).

At this iC weatherman won all three national officer positions

and a majority of the National Interin Committee as well.

Subsequently, they took over the SDS National Office (NO)

in Chicago, and controlled its funds, paper and national

records.

Although internal struggle existed until late 1969,

Weatherman for all major purposes controlled sos nationally

from June, 1969, until its i0 closed in February, 1970. At

this time it no

longer considered itself part of SDS.

The term Weatherman emerged fion an ideological

paper prepared by its leaders entitled "You Don't need a

Weatherman to know Which Way

the Wind Blows" ("New Left

Notes" June 18, 1969). This statement outlined the basic

stance of Weatherman: Marxist-Leninist in content but with

strong advocacy that action not theory vould bring about

revolution in the United States.

This posture was conplemented

with an international identification to the Cuban revolution

and CASTRO's statement that the duty of a revolutionary is

to make revolution.

During October, 1969, Weatherman riots in

Chicago resulted in more

than

260 arrests for nob action

and related charges.

A program of armed struggle was

finalized during a December, 1969, "War Council" whercin

terrorist tactics and political assassination were

contemplated.

The basic strength of licatherman was then

revealed to be some 300 - 350 nationally and geographically

apportioned to the Midwest, New York, and some Northwest.

As its rhetoric of violence escalated, Weatherman

leaders increasingly discussed the necessity of

an underground

operation wherein more than 90 percent of the organization

would be submerged; "affinity groups" of three - five members

would function independently.

In February, 1970, Weatherman

leaders announced a program of "strategic sabotage" with

police and military installations as primary targets.

In February, 1970, Heathernan abandoned the

SDS NO, 1608 West Madison Stroet, Chirar, Illinois, and

throughout the country erterid an in errround status.

A characterization of the lus

is set out separately.

WORKER STUDENT ALLIANCE/

PROGRESSIVE LABOR PARTY

A source advised during August, 1969; that at

the National Convention (NC) of Students for a Democratic

society (SDS) held in Chicago, Lilinois, during June, 4969.

, hexa in chicago,

¿ spilt arose between the Progressive Labor Party (PuP) anc

the National Office (NO), the N) becoming known as the

Weatherman faction.

The PLP fastion drew the largest

support among those in attendanse at the NC.

Source further advisel that during late Summer,

1969, the PLP faction of SDS established its National

Headguarters (NH) on the second floor of a loft-type

building at 173A Massachusetts Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts.

The campaign on which the PLP faction

centered was to build

a worker student alliance or a campus worker student

alliance. Thus, they adopted the names of Worker Student

Alliance (WSA) or Campus Worker Student Alliance.

Source stated that the "New Left Notes," printed

in New York City, is the official publication of the WSA

faction.

A second source advised during January, 1970,

that within the SDS, the WSA is a caucus of which the PLP

constitutes the leadership.

A third source advisel during July, 1970, that

during demonstrations staged ir the Boston area during the

spring and Summer of 1970 by the NH, the main theme of

previous demonstrations staged y the NH shifted from

protestations of the Vietnam War and other United States

foreign policy matters to attar ring domestic issues such

as racism and unemployment and lemonstrating

support of

the

"workers' struggle."

REVOLUTIONARY YOUTH MOVEMENT

A source advised that the Revolutionary Youth

Movement II (RYMII) faction of Students for a Democratic

Society (SDS) held a national conference at Atlanta, Georgia,

from November 26 to 30, 1969. At this conference it was

decided to form a new oiganization to be known as Revolutionary

Youth Movement (RYM), characterized as a mass anti-imperialist

youth organization, said organization being proposed as

separate and distinct in form and content from SDS.

The

"principles of Unity" adopted by the conference included

struggle against white supremacy and male supremacy; fights

against imperialism, anticommunism, fascism and oppression

of youth; and support of the right of self-determination of

all "oppressed nations," also support of the right of all

"oppressed and

exploited"

peoples "to armed self-defense."

It was agreed that RYM would not be a Marxist-Leninist

organization; however, source said this was decided in order

to indicate an organization broad enough in form to be

acceptable to everyone.. A temporary National Steering

Committee (NSC) made up of eight females and two males was

elected to govern RYM until national officers could be

elected during the Spring of 1970.

RYM publications have listed the RYM National Office

(NO) at Post Office Box 5421 and Post Office Box 77012 C,

both Atlanta, Georgia, and a second source has advised that

the NO has no office space but would probably be considered as

located at Apartment 27, 1067 Alta Avenue, Northeast, Atlanta.

Second source advised that women dominated the

founding conference and have continued to dominate NSC

meetings to the point that "women's liberation" has apparently

become the RYM's principal issue - also that RYM's poor

financial condition has resulted in its failure to publish

During early 1970, RYM has decided to cater to

the working class rather than youth, since the potential for

social revolution

lies

in workers.

A third source has stated that it was decided at

the March, 1970, NSC meeting that RYM women had decided the

organization will be molded into a "working class, Marxist-

Leninist, revolutionary, anti-imperialist, problack

nationalist, people's women's liberation organization."

A characterization of the SDS

is set out separately.

PROGRESSIVE LABOR PARTY

The "New York Times" city edition Tuesday,

April 20, 1965, Page 27, reported that a new party of

"revolutionary

socialism" was formally founded on April 18,

1965, under the name of the Progressive Labor Party (PLP),

which had been known as the Progressive Labor Movement.

According to the article, "The Progressive Labor

Movement was founded in 1962, by MILTON ROSEN and MORTIMER

SCHEER after they were expelled from the Communist Party of

the United States for assertedly following the Chinese

Communist line."

A source advised on June 3, 1968, that the PLF

held its Second National Convention in New

York City, May 31,

to June 2, 1968, at which time the PLP reasserted its

objective

of the establishment of a militant working class

movement based on Marxism-Leninism.

The source also advised that at the Second National

Convention, MILION ROSEN was unanimously re-elected National

Chairman of the PLP and LEVI LAUB, FRED JEROME, JARED ISRAEL,

WILLIAM EPTON, JACOB ROSEN, JEFFREY GORDON and WALTER LINDER

were elected

as the National Committee to lead the PLP until

the next convention.

The PLP publishes "Progressive Labor," a bimonthly

magazine, and "Challenge-Desafio,"

a monthly newspaper,

Source advised on May 25, 1970, that the PLP

utilizes an address of General Post Office Box 808, Brooklyn,

According to information received from the Washington Field

Office and Domestic Intelligence Division, the 'April Tenth Women's Committee"

of New York City, a recently formed group of women's protest organizations,

plans a "March on the Pentagon" on Saturday, 4/10/71, as an anti-war protest.

Plans call for the protesters, who may number as many as 5,000, to assemble

at L'Enfant Square, Constitution Avenue, between Seventh and Ninth Streets,

Northwest, between 11:00 a.m. and noon, and thereafter march to the Pentagon

via Constitution Avenue and Memorial Bridge. The demonstration is scheduled

to end around 5:00 p.m. The Committee has reportedly chartered 14 busses

capable of carrying 630 passengers from New York City to Washingta. The

busses are scheduled to unload at the Justice Building, where it is reported the

women will demonstrate. It is noted that L'Enfant Square, the assembly point

for the demonstrators, is within one block of the Justice Building. The protesters

are then scheduled to march to the Pentagon, where they will hold another

demonstration and will be picked up by the busses at the Pentagon.

General Services Administration (GSA) and Department security

officials are cognizant and plan to reinforce the guard force at the Tenth Street

Auto Entrance, which is the only Justice Building entrance open on Saturday.

Since we do not conduct tours on Saturday, no adjustment in our tours is neces-

sary.

Women's Bail Fund

Unless otherwise stated, all sources in

this memorandum have furnished reliable

information in the past.

on March 30, 1971, a first confidential source

furnished literature, concerning the Women's Bail Fund, which

was picked up at the

Upper Westside Womens Center, 627

The literature captioned,

Women's House of Detention, in New York City (NYC), should

not exist and that "the Women's House of Detention, along with the

prisons and jails across the country, is a weapon used by the

power structure here

in America to oppress and exploit the people

of poor communities."

It further relates that "women have come

together in New York from many different organizations to form a

women's

Bail Fund for all the sisters inside the House of

Detention. The Bail

Fund is also working to prepare simple

pamphlets on law because of the total lack of any legal

resources in

the House of Detention and secure legal assistance

where needed." The address is listed as the Women's Bail Fund,

P.O. Box 637, Cooper Station, NY, NY 10003.

on August 26, 1971, the first source furnished

literature on the Women's Bail Fund which stated, "The Women's

Bail Fund is a coalition of Third World and white women who are:

.....raising bail to release women prisoners from

Rikers Island.

...establishing communication with women inside.

... assisting women who are bailed out in meeting

their needs.

....providing legal information for prisoners.

... making public the torture these women undergo.

....supporting prison struggles everywhere."

On April 12, 1971, a second confidential source

made available a flyer on the Women's Bail Fund which was

distributed at the National Womens March on the Pentagon on

April 10, 1971.

"Victory to the NLF and All

Oppressed Peoples" states

The flyer "women in Vietnam and in the United

States are fighting for the right to live: for the very right

to exist..... the U.S. is now dotted with concentration camps

for

the poor and non-white: the jails.... But imprisonment doesnt'

break the spirit of the sisters in jail. They resist!

When denied

their dignity, they organize and fight back. When one sister is

beaten they

organiz

and resist. In the coldest part of winter

when the boilers had broken down,

the women worked in freezing

temperatures in cold water to do

the laundry-not 'because the

pigs made us do it - but for our 'own beautiful sisters.' .....We

Vietnamese, Black, Latin, White and Asian-american women are

united in our struggle -

we share common goals and face a common

enemy .

We express our complete solidarity with the NLF and shall

work to bring the victory there."

On May 14, 1971, Special Agents (SAS) of the Federal

Bureau of Investigation (FBI) observed a demonstration in front

of the NYC Women's House of Detention sponsored by the Women's

Bail Fund and Youth Against war and Fascism (YAWF).

demonstrators chanted slogans calling for release

of their

"sisters" from jail and expressed opposition to a proposed move

of the inmates of the Women's House of Detention from its

downtown site to the Rikers Island Prison

Facility.

demonstrators called this proposed move an attempt to isolate

the "sisters from their supporters."

By means of a loudspeaker, the demonstrators called to

several inmates of the House of Detention who appeared in the

upper storey windows, obtained their names and place of arrest.

This information allegedly was to be used to obtain bail for the

prisoners in question.

Thereafter, several speakers denounced

the jails as concentration camps and called for the release of the

"political prisoners." in the House of Detention. Among the

The WWP was founded in 1959 by individuals who

disagreed with policies of the socialist workers

Party (SWP). The WWP dissidents advocated

unconditional support of the Soviet union ard the

building of a revolutionary party geared to the

overthrow of capitalism.

More recently the WWP

has called for peaceful solutions to Sino-Soviet

disputes, however, the wwP generally supports the

People's

Republic of China in its ideological

differences with the soviet Union.

The SWP has been designated pursuant to

Executive Order 10450.

A third confidential source advised on May 10 the

1971, the Women's Bail Fund has called for victory for

Vietcong and is setting up a "phone chain" to be able to call

for "action against the transfer of women from the House of

Detention to Rikers Island."

on June 6, 1971, the third source advised the Women's

Bail Fund will have

"major bail out of women" from the women's

House of Detention from June 10 to June 13, 1971 at the Washington

Square Methodist Church.

It will include four

days of "discussions, films, counseling and information services"

the "Liberated Guardian

Organizing Our Anger"

, written by five unidentified members

of the Women's Bail Fund Collective..

The article relates "The Women's Bail Fund is a

group of about 35 women in New York City that bails women

out of jail (150 so far).

They have been organized for over

a year and a half and did their first bailout on December 20,

1970.

They have been active in supporting other groups

involved in the prison struggle.

They do legal follow-up

for bailed-out sisters who want it and have been talking

with people about the prison struggle, why jails exist, who

the real enemies are, etcetera."

The article is introduced by the following

statement:

"For this article we wanted to talk about ourselves.

So five of us volunteered to collect different thoughts from

as many women as possible in our group and then pooled these

reflections in this article, using the words from their raps."

The article, being reflections of the various

members of the group,

is a series of quotes by unidentified

members

concerning the WBF.

Women's Bail Fund

The following are reflections of some WBF

members carried under the subcaption "Our Roots - Why

We Started - Why We Joined"

"There was a woman in my consciousness-raising

group who was in the bail fund when it was first getting

started and she talked with others about it.

To some of

us it was a very exciting idea.

To others it was

frightening - connecting to political activity as women.

Ultimately it ended in a split of my small group on

whether we should carry our newly raised consciousness

to any sort of feminist political

• action or not.

"In the past, I was politically frustrated because

I was only involved in one-shot actions.

I saw what was

happening in terms of how this system functions to oppress

black people and that resulted inalot of pain for me.

felt I had to reflect my stands in a day-to-day struggle.

I had the sense that the women in the WBF were also aware

of that need.

"When sisters want us to, we go to court with them.

When I go to court I find that it can do bad things to my

head.

I make judgements like this jude is better than another

but it's all shit.

judges are pigs. Or like

Feeling good that a sister got six months instead of five

years when she shouldn't have gotten anything at all.

"I was in the House of Detention when there was the

bail fund demonstration on December 20, 1970. The whole

tier was so excited. When someone saw the first people she

let out a scream and everyone rushed to the windows.

the chanting increased outside we started to sing and chant.

They locked us in our cells so each person would be isolated

and intimidated about chanting.

But all the women kept it

up. Everyone inside said the feeling about this demonstration

was different than other demonstrations. There had been more

contact.

The women saw Afeni and Joan and another woman

that they had known inside outside in the demonstration.

That was real important.

"A lot of it was the bail fund. The bail fund

banner with the address made it real that people were serious

about supporting people inside. It wasn't going to be a

one+shot deal.

following are reflections carried

sub-caption here on are tale i teen a one the

revolution.

So much of what we do is short-term support

stuff that can be seen as reformist.

When prisoners raise

hese demands it's understood to be revolutionary: wher

people on the outside raise them, they are felt to be

reformist.

I have done a whole lot of courtroom work,

both in the bail fund and before too. In fact, the whole

is why it

is so hard for me to deal with all this

social work thing is what I come out of, "cause I obviously

reflect a lot of that

back in the late 1800's and Social work when it started

early 1900's came out of real

radical circles, the radicals and feminists and such. And

when you read MAO, he talks about service to the people

as a revolutionary thing.

But for us it feels weird

because it has been co-opted.

I think that the movement

now,

trying to recoup the revolutionary aspects, that

original sense of service to the people, trying

to help

people survive.

out of the rut of being social workers is to engage in

more political education among ourselves and to ask other

groups how they've dealt with this question. Also we

should be more involved in educating other people.

"We should be doing more for women inside. We

need to really work on facilitating communications

between the sisters inside the jail. Women prisoners

have been slower to get organized but I'm sure this is

because there is so much isolation in the women's jail.

Concretely, we need to write more letters

to find out what

es coins on, send literature, but also tell the women about

other,

about what other women are thinking and feeling.

This would stop the sense of isolation and increase the

sense of solidarity.

"I think much of the movement is guilty of

ultra-leftism. In China the Communists worked on a lot

of things that were a lot less than what they ultimately

wanted.

We're too afraid of being contaminated by being

involved in reform movements.

We too often define our

enemies too broadly and our allies too narrowly.

It helps me through the rough times and all

the ideological hassles and struggles we go through.

you really have a sense that everyone really wants to work

things through, search for solutions, wants to hold

together because we feel responsible for the work. "Even

the way people ask for leaves of absence when they are

sick or too busy, that they feel they want to explain

Re New York airtel and IHM, 8/28/72, and captioned

as above.

on 11/28/72, WY 7615-S advised the Women's Bail Fund

(WBF) is not a leading element and lacks any influence in the

movement in New York City.

A review of the subject file discloses there is no

structure to the WBF and that it is a coalition of women who

belong to various groups in the New York City area, whose main

purpose is to raise Iunds Ior selected women in jail.

It is noted that Weatherman subjects have contacted

those involved in the bail fund.

However, have decryed the

of political direction of

the WBF and would like to turn

it into a defense committee because of a lack of any other

direction. There is no indication that this has occurred, and

the bail fund still remains a loose coalition of like-minded :

individuals from various groups seeking to raise funds for.

various purposes.

Because of its lack of common political dir-: '

ection, it has had no influence and presently is ineffective in

the movement.

In view of the above, the NYO is discontinuing investi-

gation in this matter to be reopened upon receipt of pertinent

information from sources that the bail fund is being redirected

as a structured group for a common political and ideological

purpose.

Boston file 100-38735 entitled "EVAN PATCHEN

DELLINGER, aka PATCH DELLINGER; SM - ANARCHIST (BUFILE

100-450998)" reflected that DELLINGER was subject of

Boston investigation based on his participation in a

"Teach-In"

and Rededication Service on 1/29/68 at the

Arlington St. Church, Boston. During the above activity?

DELLINGER made a

statement in support of the "Resistance

Group" and turned in what was reported to be Selective

Service cards.

The primary function of the Resistance Group

was to aid, abet, and counsel young men faced with the

draft.

EVAN PATCHEN DELLINGER graduated from Swarthmore

College, Swarthmore, Pa., on 6/0/06 majoring it economics.

He was arrested at Chester, Pa. on 4/1/64 and was charged

with disorderly conduct.

The 1968-59 Harvard University Directory of

Officers and Students reflected that DELLINGER was enrolled

in the School of Medicine, Harvard University, Cambridge,

Mass.

It had been reported that PATCH DELLINGER was

present at a Socialist Workers Party (SWP) Street Meeting

in New York City on 7/21/64.

The file further disclosed that inasmuch as the

Boston office had no current information associating DELLIN-

GER with the SWP or the Young Socialist Alliance and that:

his activities on behalf of the New England Resistance were

pacifist in nature, it was felt that DELLINGER did not

warrant inclusion on the Security or Agitator Indexes main-

tained at that time; and thus, the case was placed in a closed

status.

A review of Boston file 25-25585 (Bufile 25-569484)

based on his participation in the previously mentioned

Rededication

Services at the Arlington St. Church in Boston

on 1/29/68 at which 23 individuals turned in either a

Notice of Classification and/or a Registration Certificate.

Two other individuals turned in some other type of, document.

It was determined that DELLINGER had turned in a Selective

Service Registration Certificate and two Notices of Classi-

fication issued by LB #28, Flemington, New Jersey. Also,

a two-page statement signed PATCHEN DELLINGER supporting

the Resistance movement was turned in.

In April, 1972, AUSA, Boston declined any prosecu-..

tion concerning DELLINGER.

On 8/21/72, personnel of the Office of the Mass.

Commissioner of Probation, Suffolk County Courthouse, Boston,

a central repository for all traffic and criminal conviction

records within the Commonwealth of Mass., advised that their

The

most members of the CCL are youthful lawyers and the CCL

was organized in June; 1969, to work for reform of the legal
