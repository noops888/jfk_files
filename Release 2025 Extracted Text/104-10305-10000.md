MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation with Gordon Novel

Gordon Novel called the New Orleans office on 13 August 1981.

Ronald Farris was away on Annual Leave and had arranged to have his calls

forwarded automatically to the Houston Field Office's listed telephone

number.

When the call was answered with the Houston number, Novel indi-

cated that he was calling the New Orleans office.

He was told that Farris

was out of the office for a week and his calls were being relayed to

Houston.

Novel asked how he would go about obtaining his personal Agency

file under the Freedom of Information Act.

He was told that he should

address a letter to Freedom of Information Coordinator with his request.

He then indicated that he had done this already, and the information sent

to him was so severely edited and sanitized that it was difficult to make

sense of it.

He did, however, discover. that it contained information that

and he asked how to go about refuting the misinformation

and/or correcting the file. It was suggested that he write a letter

detailing the discrepancies and request that a change be made. He did

not seem interested in doing that and promptly changed his line of

questioning.

He asked how he would go about contacting the Director of

the Agency directly. He was told that he should use the local represent-

ative, Mr. Farris, to relay any information he might wish to get to the

Director.: Novel

indicated that he had only talked to Farris once, but

was anxious to bypass the usual channels to avoid having his information

mishandled or misconstrued. He was told that Farris was a highly qualified

representative of the Agency and the proper individual to contact regarding

information he wished to get to the Director's attention. He gave a small

sinister chuckle and replied, "We'll see about that," then hung up.

SUBJECT

Pending Litigation - Gordon Novel

1.

Gordon Novel is a somewhat notorious figure

who first came to the attention of this Agency during the

- Garrision

Investigation into the assassination of

President Kennedy. From time to time he has claimed. to

He has never been employed by the Agency and has had no

contacts with the Agency except for occasional visits to

Domestic Collection Division offices.

He has been in

several scrapes with the law, most recently in October

1976

when he was on trial for conspiracy to firebomb

several buildings in New Orleans.

Mr. Novel has now

filed a civil suit claiming alleged violations of his

rights and interference with his personal affairs.

is not suing the Agency but he has named Mr. Howard

Osborn as a defendant.

Mr. Osborn has been in touch with

the Office of General Counsel seeking representation by

the Justice Department since he feels his being named in

the suit probably resulted from his official duties with

the Agency.

On 27 April 1977 Mr. George Jameson of the

Office of General Counsel contacted the undersigned to

inquire whether we had a file on Novel and if the file

showed any reason why Mr. Novel should have named

Mr. Osborn as a defendant in the suit. Mr. Jameson was

given a rundown on the nature of the information in

Novel's file and was also provided with Mr. Osborn's

retirement date, 26 February 1974.

Mr. Jameson mentioned

that most of the

alleged activities complained about by

Novel occurred in 1975 and there is no apparent reason

for Novel having singled out Mr. Osborn as a defendant.

Mr. Jameson also requested traces on two individuals

these individuals.

Mr. Jameson indicated that we would probably

be receiving.

a formal request for pertinent information

as this case

develops, but he merely needed a preliminary

reading in order to determine if Mr. Osborn should be

defended by the Department of Justice in this litigation.

Aside from indexing the names of Blanscett and Pfiffer to

Novel's file, no further action is contemplated by the

undersigned.

MEMORANDUM FOR:

Director of Personzel

FROM

John K. Greaney

Associate General Counsel

SUBJECT

: Gordon Dwane Novel

1. Gordon Novel is scheduled for rosecution in New Orleans

on 27 October on charges stemming frot = conspiracy to firebomb some

buildings on Canal Street. He was mentoned extensively in the James

Garrison investigation of the Kennnedy assassination in 1967. Subse-

quently, Novel filed suit against Garriso= and later against Playboy

Magazine for an article they published wich identified Novel as a CIA

employee. In 1969 the Agency submitted a certificate signed by the then

Director of Personnel, Robert S. Wattles, which certified that Gordon Novel

had never been employed by the CIA (cc=; attached). It may be necessary

to submit a new certificate for the upcoring tial in New Orleans. You

are requested to search your files to determine whether there is any

record of employment.

2. There are two additional defense witnesses that we would

appreciate a search as to any employmer i relationship:

(a) Lawrence B. Rohde

It is my understanding that these names have all been traced as a request

from the Domestic Collection Division with negative results. However, I

would appreciate a written response to those traces by close of business

20 October so that certificates can be prepared.

3. It is possible that a witness from the Office of Personnel may be

required to appear in New Orleans as a rebuttal witness to testify that

there was no employment relationship with Gordon Dwane Novel, but this

is subject to negotiation with the prosecutor.

1. On 31 August 1976, Major Robert Foster, Defense

Intelligence Agency (telephone 11-50418), contacted

MI. Robert Hopkins, Office of Security Liaison Officer,

seeking information concerning subject. He explalned thai

the Subject, while residing, in a local motel, had Sverheard

a telephone conversation Wha girl. They discussed large

amounts of money with

the indication it was illegally obtained.

Also, in this discussion, Subject mentioned that due to this

girl's information, he was arrested by the CIA in February 1976.

2.

On 1 September 1976, Major Foster was contacted by

the undersigned and advised that the CIA had knowledge of the

Subject,

but that he had never in any way been connected

with the CIA nor had we ever arrested him.

Major Foster

was informed that the Subject has a long history of imper-

sonating CIA agents or abusing the CIA's name during his

activities.

It was explained that based on our information,

Subject appeared to be somewhat irrational.

3.

Major Foster advised that he also felt the Subject

was

a "nut" and appreciated the information offered by the CIA.

REFERENCES

: Domestic Collections Division Memoranda

dated 25 February 1976 & 1 March 1976

1. According to the referenced Domestic Collections

Division (DCD) memoranda, the New Orleans DCD Office had con-

sidered proposals: from Subject in October 1975 and on

9 February 1976 which were rejected.

During the last contact,

the DCD representative requested Subject not contact him again.

2. DCD requested Office of General Counsel (OGC) guidance

if they should be contacted by the press concerning Subject's

arrest for conspiring to detonatesincendiary devices in a down-

town New Orleans building.

OGC recommended that they acknowledge

receiving a proposal

from

• Novel which had been rejected. DCD

was also informed that Subject had never been employed by the

Agency, with the understanding that this might also be made

known to any inquiring reporters or United States Attorney.

DCD stated that

they were pleased with this guidance, since

it allowed them to respond candidly to any immediate inquiries

and also serves to disassociate the Agency from the difficulties

in which Subject now finds himself.

It appears that the only

action taken in this case is the OGC guidance supplied to DCD

and the only CIA interest in Subject is based on his contact

with the New Orleans DCD Office.

1.

The US Attorney in New Orleans, Gerald Gallinghouse, called

the Hew Orleans Resident Office on 24 February 1276 to advise me that

Gordon M. D. Novel had been arrested by agents of the US Alcohol, Tobacco

and Firearms Bureau (AIT) for conspiriog to detonate incendiaxy devices

In a downtown New Orleans building on Mardi Gras, 2 March 1976. Novel

had apparently described such a plot in a conversation he unwittingly

hold with an undercover ATe agent.

2. I confirmed to Gallinghouse that I had had a number of contacts

with Novel since October 1975 concerning a proposal which lovel had offered

for CIA consideration.: I told Gallinghousa that the proposal had been ta-

jected by the Agency, but that I had again seen Novel on 9. February 1976

to accept additional naterial in support of his proposal.

At that time,

I also asked Novel noi to contact me again. I assured Gallinghouse that

at no time had Novel baen an Agency employee, not had he ever bad any

fornal relationship with the Agency. Gallinghouse thanked ne for ex-

plaining the nature of our relationship with Novel, and he suggested

that he might recontact me later if necessary for nora details.

3.

In the referent telecon, I briefed the Doputy Chief of Operations,

Ed Watts, on the development and asked him how I should respond if Galling-

house sought access to the office file on Lovel. Mi. Watts recommended that

I try to avoid glving the US Attorney direct access to the file, but that

11 Callinghouse should ask io review the file, I should refer the request

to Headquartars for resolution.

4. Mrs. Gordon Novel called shortly after my conversation with

Messrs. Gallinghouse and Hatts.

She said that her husband had asked

her to call ne to insure that federal authorities were aware that ber

husband had been actively discussing a proposal for the Agency with me.

Mrs. Novel said that her husband had been denied boud, and that he hoped

his contacts with a DOD oificer night somebow convince federal authorities

that he could be safely released on bond after all. Otherwise, sho said,

he might be detained through the Mardi Gras holiday as a precaution.

She

assured me that Novel had made no effort to persuade the authorities that

he is a CIA officer or employee.

Reportedly, Novel and two other men

were supposed to meet with Gov. Edwin

Edwards last Saturday in Baton Rouge

to discuss the possibilities of getting a

world's fair for New Orleans.

"I had a luncheon scheduled (last)

Saturday at the mansion with some peo-

ple to talk about the exposition," the

governor said.

"But the name Novel

doesn't ring a bell.

"Only one man showed up Saturday.

He said the others couldn't make it and

asked if we could re-schedule the meet-

wing. I didn't even ask why thay couldn't

make it.

An aide to the governor said the gover-

nor's office was trying to determine if

one of the three men was Novel.

He said records of the appointment

show only the time and subject matter of

the meeting.

The aide added that Novcl may have

been one of the three, but he could not be

certain.

According to the documents, the ATF

Bureau received information "from a

confidential informant" of the alleged

plan.

Grafton, posing as a prospective "hit

man," made arrangements to discuss

the plans with Novel on Feb. 4.

The affidavit for a, search warrant

signed by Johannesen _ said Grafton

was told by Novel that Novel "had

several buildings he wanted destroyed in

the New Orleans, La. area..•.

The papers also show that on Feb. f,

Grafton met Novel at Novel's home, 1718

Lakeshore Drive, where Novel allegedly

said "he had made a firebomb for an

individual to burn the first building he

wanted destroyed, but that man failed to-

do the job. : .

The identity of that person was not re-

vealed in the documents.

Novel said he "had a few problems,

with some of the property located within

the (downtown) project area and that

wa's where Grafton would come

in .

" according to the affidavit.

The documents showed that Grafton

met Novel again at his Plaza Tower of.

fice on Feb. 11d the two "discussed

the firebombin,

five buildings within

the down(own area." •

At that time, according to the docu-

ments, Novel allegedly showed Graiton

the equipment as well as what Novel

supposedly described as "illegal sire-

tapping equipment:"

At that meeting, the papers claim.

Novel allegedly agreed to give Graiton

"the contract"' to destroy the five bullo-

ings:

That same day, the documents indi:

cate. Novel supposedly pointed out the

first building targeted for the alleged at-

tack, and later look Gralion to "the

building locaied between St. Charles and

Camp Street."

According to the papers, Novel al-

legedly explained to Grafton

"how

difficult it would be to get inside the

building.

At another meeting Feb. 13 between

the two in Novel's office, the documents

said, Novel drew a diagram of the first

targeted building which was described

as being "accross the street from One

Shell Square."

Presumably, that building was the

•On that same date, the records allege,

Novel told Grafton "the fire should be on

the second floor in order for the roof and

floor to burn completely."

It was then, according to the affidavit,

that Grafton agreed to the plan for $1,000

and the free apartment.

Accerding to the records, Novel also

presented Grafton a nolebook, contain.

CLV-121-75

DATE: 17 July 1975

1. On 15 July 1975, an agent of the Cleveland FBI contacted the

Cleveland Resident Office concerning the attached correspondence. The

Bureau had received the letters the same day, and because there were

several references to the Agency, the agent thought that our office

should be informed.

Copies of the correspondence are attached for

your information and retention.

The FBI agent who discussed this matter with us stated that

he had been told that the author of the four-page letter was a

"professional wiretapper", had previously been convicted to transporting

illegal wiretap equipment across state lines (into Nevada), and was

suspected

of illegally obtaining and

selling "classified information".

Cleveland FBI plans no action at this time other than further in-

vestigatory work on the individual.

The Cleveland RO plans to do absolutely nothing about this

matter other than forwarding the information to Headquartexs.

agent was informed of and agreed to this course of action, he was

thanked for his concern and the matter was dropped.

" Dear Mi. Doherty:

Enclosed is a Xerox copy of a letter received by special

messenger on July 7, 1975, from Gordon Novel, making certain demands

on Southwestern Bell, AT&T and companies serving Colunbus, Onzo, Reno,

Nevada and Washington, D. C. (See page 4, paragraph 3)

Mr. Novel's letter has been reviewed by our company Legal

Department and a decision has been made not to reply in writing.

MT. Horak, the

manager handling Novel's account, "is to contact Novel

and advise him verbally that his letter has been referred to higher

management; and that copies of this letter have been forwarded to

the telephone companies serving the cities he mentioned for any

action they, deem

appropriate.

Mr. Novel's propensity for filing

suit was one of the mair considerations for choosing this cöurse of

action.

Should any of the recipients of this letter decide to

contact or write Novel I would appreciate being notitied prior to

your doing so. Our Legal Department wants. to be kept abreast of any

response made to his demands as it might affect the company's. course

of action.

very truly yours,

Enclosure

Genülemen:

Due to the rapidly accelerating national

sensitivity

of my historical personal interests, as well as the

magnicude of political, intelligence and financial involve-

ments for wnich I am legally responsible to my associates,

I deem It wise to contact your office for the following

reasons:

It Is imperative that your files be revised in order

to case reflecting surposeful disinformation, slanderous

Irregularities and obvious Inconsistencies about my activities.

This data has been maliciously aceunulated by your business

and security offices during the past seven years while

1llegally, Intruding and Interfering In hichly sensitive

Industrial and political counterintelligence research in

which I was involved. To accomplish this, 1.

T.&T. has

used misrepresentation and a

fraudulent legal technicality

covering

anticipated" financial loss to the phone company.

(My phone bills have always been paid promptly.)

The police tactics used by your offices--harrassnent,

Intimidation,

threats, extortionary denands--have been

veilfied throughout jexas and in kashington, D. C.

however,

the highly sensitive nature of the work in which we are

currertly Involved could, concelvably, pose a threat to

national security because of this invasion of privacy where

our phone calls are concerned.

Immediately.

Relative to the recent meeting in my private study

at my Dallas

residence,

July.

2, 1975, I have reviewed my

records: and do. not find a willine nor direct acknowlearment

or the R. B McMasters billing responsibility, alleged by

Mr. Horak in his letter of the sane date, written on plain

watermarked stationery bearing questionable signature.

That purportedly official telephone company document claims

that I owe jour company $1,041.42.

I deny any responsibility

for the reason that Mr. McMasters personally effected the

Installation of the phone at 3055 Leahy (243-6382), In his

name and as an officer of the now-defunct Genesis Corpora

tion.

I have caused approximately $20,000 to be paid to

Mr.

Mcmascers, privately and corporately. for his unsuccess

ful business vertures and I have no intention of assuning

responsibility for something else I do not owe in Mr.

McMasters behalf. He and the Genesis Corporation were

personally and corporately responsible for the bills for

that phone and I am certain your records will reflect same.

My records reflect that hundreds of

vindictive;

disparaging and slanderous long-distance telephone calls

were placed by your company's collection operalors alleging

that I did owe, the bill.

These calls caused me and my

associates severe personal and tinancial damages. I derang

that the mistake be corrected in wilting. I will furrest

you the list of names and radresses.

The bills for this number are current and have been

prompily pald, in cash, on time since it was installed last

•year.

but only in accordance with the following terms:

Upon instructions fron my attorneys, I am formally

dcinanding

assurance, In affidavit form, that neither your Dallas

office nor 1ts Columbus, Ohio, Reno, Nevada, and Washing-

ton, D. C., counterparts has at any time within the past

seven rears surreptitiously intercepted or monitored by

wire any aural conversation of Gordon Novel/G. N. Rose

without the authorization of a rederal, State or Judicial

Municipality Legal Court Order, in accord with the provicions

of latle-114 of che Omnibus Crine Bill of 1900.

If such legal written assurance is not forthconing

from your office within seven (7) working days, we have

instructed our lashington, D. C., attorneys to file

appropriate federal civil actions personally achinat some

todivldual security and management officials and against

Southwestern Bell and M.T.&f

I further request thai the outgoing call service at

Walter Sheridan first came into national promi-

stories about Clay Bertrand that the truth was dif-

Sheridan interpreted for

Bribing and Attempting to Bribe Witnesses

In addition to bribing and attempting to bribe

witnesses, Sheridan also had meetings with one of

Garrison's part-time investigators, William Gur-

vich. Garrison found out about the meetings and

did not give Gurvich all of the information he

wanted.

Jim Garrison said about Sheridan and the NBC

Unsettling, Disturbing, Critical

Computers and Automation, established 195l and

therefore the oldest magazine in the field of com-

puters and data processing, believes that the pro-

fession of information engineer includes not only

competence in handling information using computers.

and other means, but also a broad responsibility.

in a professional and engineering sense, for:

- The reliability and social significance

of pertinent input data;

- The social value and truth of the

output results.

In the same way, a bridge engineer takes a pro-

fessional responsibility for the reliability and

significance of the data he uses, and the safety

efficiency of the bridge he builds, for human

beings to rist their lives on.

Accordingly, Computers and Automation publishes

from time to time articles and other information

related to socially useful input and output of data

systems in a broad sense. To this end se seek to

publish what is unsettling, disturbing, critical

- but productive of thought and an improved and

safer "house" for all humanity, an earth in which

our children and later generations may lave a lu-

ture, instead of facing extinction.

The professional information engincer needs to

relate his engineering to the most important and

serious problems in the world today:

nuclear «capons, pollution, the population explo-

sion, and many more.

ALLEGATION:

CIA CONNECTION:

Gordon NOVEL, former

owner of a French Quarter Bar

in New Orleans, was subpoenaed

by GARRISON as a material

witness in March 1967 but

NOVEL moved to Columbus, Ohio

and has avoided extradition.

GARRISON charged NOVEL

with burglary of the Houma

and AROACHA-SMITH. NOVEL,

claimed this was a CIA

operation but later his

attorney denied the story.

CIA HISTORICAL REVIEW PROGRAM

RELEASE IN FULL 1998

Numerous news items, the

latest dtd in October 1967.

OS INDICES RESULLS:

Subject's file contains newspaper clippings dating from March

1967 when GARRISON charged him with conspiracy in connection with

a burglary of a munitions bunker at Houma, Louisiana in 1961 together

with David FERRIE and ARCACHA-SMITH. To avoid arrest, NOVEL left

New Orleans, first going to McLean, Virginia where he was given a

lie detector test by Lloyd B. FURR, a private detective.

(See summary

on FURR). This incident tended to give credence to NOVEL's initial.

claim that he was working for CIA because of the Agency's promimity to

McLean, Va.

After NOVEL vacated his New Orleans apartment in March 1967

a letter written by him was found under the linoleum on a sink

drainboard by the new tenant, a girl who turned it over to her boy

friend, who gave it to a professor at a New Orleans university who in

turn gave it to

a reporter on the New Orleans STATES-TIM, Hoke MAY.

SLON

Hoke MAY was granted a Covert Security Approval in April 1958

for unwitting use by Project FJINDULGE. MAY was not to be directly

employed by FJINDULGE but was to be used in connection with his

position with a provate firm which handled work for the Project.

The letter was presumably written to a "Mr. WEISS" in CIA and referred

to classified DOUBLE-CHEK activities in 1961 in which NOVFL claimed

he was involved. This matter was reviewed by CIR&A at the time the

matter received publicity and it was determined that DOUBLE-CHOK

was created by the Agency for the sole purpose of making payments to

the widows of American flyers who participated in the Bay of Pigs.

No connection with NOVEL, could be established. NOVIL knew Sergio

ARCACHA-SMITH who was New Orleans head of the Frente Revolucionario

Democratico, an Agency created and supported anti-Castro organization.

Although ARCACHA-SMITH had no Agency clearance, NOVEL could have gained

an impression from him that he was employed by CIA.

In October 1967 NOVEL, was granted immunity from arest by GARRISON

on the Houma Bunker burglary charge and returned to Louisiana to

testify before the East Baton Rouge Parish Grand Jury in their probe

on crime and labor troubles in the State of Louisiana.

DETAILS:

The Agency had no connection with the Houma Munitions Bunker.

However, an Agency training site was located at Belle Chasse, Louisiana

and Colonel Thomas BURBANK, State of Louisiana Police Superintendent, was

one of the Louisiana officials witting of Agency affiliation with

Belle Chasse. It is noted from news items concerning NOVEL's testimony

before the Louisiana Labor probers in October 1967, that Colonel BURBANK

was also a witness at the same time, although, there is no mention that

BURBANK and NOVEL knew each other.

BURBANK testified that every Louisiana

sheriff was notified to "clean up" gambling and other vice in Louisiana.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Gordon Novel

#526113

1. On 20 May 1969, the Director of Security advised that

he had received a call from Mr. Bienvenu, Director of Security,

National Security Agency, regarding a possible impersonation

by subject. According to Mi. Biehvenu, an ex-Federal Bureau of

Investigation agent, Mr. Rusself H. Aufrance 3256 South Union

Avenue, Alliance, Ohio, 44601,

had called Mr. Mathison and

advised that a contact of his had stated that Subject had shown a

CIA credential and indicated that he was employed by the Agency.

Mr. Aufrance advised he called the National Security Agency to

bring this matter to the attention of the highest security officials

in Washington and that if anyone wished to contact him they should

call him before 5:00 p.m., this date.

2. After reviewing Subject's file and confirming that Mr.

Aufrance was an ex-Federal Bureau of Investigation agent, I briefed

the Director of Security who requested that I call Mr. Aufrance and

advise him that we were knowledgeable of Subject and that on other

occasions he had inferred he was employed by CIA. In addition, that

we intended to turn this information over to the Federal Bureau of

Investigation for investigation since the FBI had jurisdiction on such

impersonation cases.

3.

I later briefed Mr. Fred J. Cassidy, FBI/Liaison, who

suggested that I advise Mr. Aufrance to report the information to

local FBI agents.

In Mr. Cassidy's presence, I called Mr. Aufrance

who repeated what he had told Mr. Mathison.

He also stated that

Subject's wife is now separated from him and is suing him for divorce

in Columbus, Ohio. She has stated that Subject is armed, carries a

SECRET

tear gas weapon and some kind of a . 22 caliber pistol, concealed as a

fountain pen. She stated that Subject is leaving Columbus for Reno,

Nevada, where he intends to open a gambling establishment. In further

discussion with Mr. Aufrance, he indicated his source was a friend of

Subject's wife and from other statements he made, it is believed that his

source is Thomas F. Hughes, Jr., who was interviewed by the Chicago

Field Office on 18 April 1969.

4. After further discussion with Mr. Aufrance during which he

indicated he was leaving for a fishing trip in Canada and would not

return until Sunday, 25 May 1969, it was agreed that he would contact

the local Federal Bureau of Investigation and brief them regarding

Subject and that I would, meanwhile, alert FBI Headquarters/Washington,

which could follow-up with the local office.

5. I then provided Mr. Cassidy with all pertinent information

regarding Mr. Aúfrance's telephone call and all information on Subject.

Mr. Cassidy will keep us advised.

above telephone call, but he was unable to

add to, or clarity the details of thecall. Agent FAY said

Mr: HUGHES said he has suspected all along that

one Gordon NEVIL, NEVILLE OF NOVEL (HUGHES professed only

phonetic spelling; however, Headquarters, after an indices

check, later said that it was probably Gordon NOVEL, wha

had previously owned a bar in New Orleans and who had

previously claimed

an affiliation with the Agency)

Mr HUGhes said that he has a little background on

Gordon NOVEL and it

may have a bearing on the recent events

a lot of fights and arguments and have been separated on

wits and is not to be trusted; that NOVEL engages in

taps telophones, "bugs" rooms and takes photographs, all ot

which are in connection with questionable activities; and that

Abbey, has claimed working

prepared special radic commercials used on 300 stations

in the U.S. ais Cahada. Their cryptographic messages, he

claims, were to älert agents to the invasion date. The com-

mercials advertised aluminum Christmas trees, he says,

and the key aiert code names were "Star Christmas Trees"

and "Holiday Trees."', In late 1960, $72,000 worth of radio

time was placed by the agency.

On the day the munitions were picked up, he says, he

was called by his CIA contact and told to join a group which

was ordered to transport munitions from the bunker to New

Orleans. The key to the bunker, he says, was provided.

HE SAYS HE MADE THE TRIP in his own automobile,

lincoln, and met several people there - all of them al-

-gedly acting for the CIA. He identifies them as Ferrie,

Arcacha, several Cubans, and another figure in the case.

They loaded the bugs of ordnance on trucks, he con-

nes, and raurned to New Orleans where the explosives

•ew Orleans he saw 50 to 100

boxes of munitions in Banister's: Lafayette st. office early

Banister was a private detective then, operating. a com-

pany called Guy Banister Associates. His friend said he

saw the munitions in a stereroom-office, in boxes marked

with ine name "Schlumberger."

HE SAYS FIVE OR SIX OF THE BOXES were open.

Inside, he says, were rifle grenades, land mines and some

"little missiles" of a kind he had never seen before.

The friend said he remonstrated with Banister because

"fooling with this kind of stuff could get you in trouble."

He added: •

'"Banister said no, it was all right, that he had approval

from somebody He said the stuff would just be there over-

night; that somebody was supposed to pick it up. He seld

a bunch of fellows connected with the Cuban deal asked: 10;

leave it there overnight."

Banister's friend said this happened well before the

April Bay of Pigs invasion.

The munitions, Novel says, were picked up and con-

solidated soon after the New Orleans drops. He says they

eventually were taken by boat to Cuba for use in a diver-

sionary operation staged in conjunction with the Bay of

Pigs attack.

Cuban sources in New Orleans say the cadre of Cubans

trained by the CIA on the city's West Bank in 1961 was

sent to Varacoa. to make a diversionary assault. The at-

tack did not come off because. Castro militia was waiting.

and took the group prisoner.

NOVEL'S ACCOUNT OF THE explosives caper sharply:

conflicts with Garrison's charges against Arcacha and

Novel. The DA's accusation says the burglary took place

after Aug. 1, 1961-three months after the Cuban disaster.-

The DA accuses the two men of conspiring to burglarize

a bunker at an abandoned military base at Houma. Gar-

rison's bill of information' says the hunker was leased by.

the Schlumberger Wel services Co. of Houston.

Schlumberger officials say they know nothing of any

CIA operations in conneetion with their magazine, where

oil field service equipment and certain low yield explosives

As to the date the Houma burglary happened, no one

seems to know or will say exactly when it took place.

Schlumberger says it has no records. The Houma police say.:

their records are missing, and the Terrebonne Parish DA,

Wilmore Broussard,) will not reveal the date he charges

Arcacha and Novel burglarized the Houma bunker. He said

it is "material evidence" in his case.

PLOTKIN SAYS HE MADE A TRIP to Houma to get

Shaw, a tall white-haired retired New Orleans business-

man, who stoutly denies participating in a plot to kill

Kennedy, was managing director of the International Trade

Mart. He was with the organization for 19 years and in a

favorable position to observe the movements of international

commerce through Ametica's second-ranking seaport.

On March 4, Paese Sera, an afternoon newspaper in

Rome, carried a story. Which said Shay is a director of a

firm known as World Trade Center Cory. The newspaper,

which is leftist in its political leanings, claimed the com-

pany was a CIA front operation.

It said the company moved its operations from Switzer-

land to Rome and has since transferred its offices to Johan-

nesburg, South Africa, where it is still in existence.
