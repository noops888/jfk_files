ARTHUR A. LTFALL, Case Officer

"COMMENTS:

WIROGUE called at approximately 0945 hours on the Stage I

Ops phone and asked for Mr. Murmann

C.0. took the call and was

advised that the caller was Davele and that he destred to speak

to a colleaguezof Mr Murmanö at the earliest possible time.

C-0: made arrangements. to. meet him in front of the safe house

at 51 'Kuhwaldstr

which WIROGUE occupied during his 1 1/2 year

association with

HARVARD (this is no longer a HARVARD safe house).

C.O. did not tell Dave his name over the telephone and indicated

that ne would be able to recognize "Dave". C.O. picked "Dave"

up on the corner of Volta and Kuhwaldstr and drove a cöuple of

blocks. to a parking place where the conversation took place.

C.O. learned that WIROGUE was no longer employed by the

Bochler Company in Munich.

He apparently has had a couple of

factory jobs since thai job and is currently unemployed.

According to

"Davel he is without work, without friends, without

money and" only contacted Murmann's old office because he is

at the end of his rope"

Subject stated that he had tried bard

to find suitable employment in Germany, but that there was

absolutely nothing available which he could do. It was obvious

that WIROGUE wished to renew. his association with the AIS änd that

"intelligence work" was the only kind of employment for which he

felt himself really gualified.

When C.O. Indicated to him that tbe

employment possibilities had not changed since WIROGUE was told

there was no possibility of future employment with the Agency,

Subiect said.

us of his plans to so po ports i ate on to contact the advise

French Intelligence-Service-to-which he would offer-his services.

He wished to find

out if we would have any objections to his

secking employment from the French or possibly the British since

we are apparently unable to utilize him further C.O. said that

obulously HIROGUE would do what he would do and that while we

had no control over his actions

it would seem a bit surprising

that he would delibertely place himself in the hands of the

French authorities where he was known to have a criminal record.

WIROGUE

implied that hewould obviously tell.all: to the French

and indicated that he was

not concerned

about. any actions

they would

rake against him. He appeared sure

that

in

an

vague: and confused way that

extremely

the French Intelligence Service could

use him.

---

## Page 4

In the course of the lenythy discussions WIROGUE let it

be known that he was not very happy about the treatment he

had received from the Ancricans--that he felt he had been

dropped, and it appeared obvious. to. C.O. that if we had no

further work for him he was threating to tell his story to the

Prench authorities--a story which he presumably feels

we would

nöt like the

French to know about: It should be stressed that

at no time was the

"blackmall threat" bluntly presented

It was

merely that he wished to advise us of his plan to leave

for

Parts this date with this intention in mind and that he wished

to determine if ve hadady "objections".

sarasEd reviewed with WIROGUE the considerable efforts

which bad been made to assist him in establishing a new life here

In the rEDREP a new lite story, legal documentation, the spaxte

task opportunity to

look for employment for a period of more than

a year while

receiving subsistence from us, etc. C.O. told

Subject that be obvlously had a good mind and was in good health

and

that if heras unable ito find some type of employment in

the thriving West German economy that appealed to him thare and

satisfied hin--he would probably be unhappy wherever he goes.

C.C. discounted Subject's belieft that "intelligence work" was

the only thing for which he was suited.

C.O. ap expressed the view

hat he should get his head out of the clouds and hi,

feet on

the ground--that he should find a job,

however men'ttr,

and throw

himself into it.. At this point WIROGUE said that to at one time

he had told Mr. Murmann of his desire to become a driver or

chauffer but that Mr.. Murmann told him'he could find much more

suitable employment.

With a certain amount of disbelief C.O.

pursued this topie with him telling WIROGUE that-Bif he nasa

was

really serjous thatxha in belleving that this kind of employment

would be satisfying to him, that it was the first sensible thought

he had expressed in the course of the discussions and that c.O.

would determine whether it would be possible to assist Subject

in

obtaining a West German driverss license (Subject indicated that-

he had a Congo drivers license when he arrived in Frankfurt

although it was issued in another name).

While Subject pretended

to have a genuine interest in obtaining

such employment-- and

used this to refute C.O.'s

accusation that he only wanted to start

at the top and considered most kinds of honest employment as

being beneath him--C.O. is highly skeptical of Subject's motives.

WIROGUE was told to call Makaarxathias Mac (this is the only name

-which C.O.gave_to WIROGUE) on the following day (Thursday, 1

October) and C.O. would sa let him know whether he could help

him obtain a Nest German license. HIROGUE was quick-to-point-out

that

brought the contract with him and promised to show it to c.o.

Subject thanked C. O. for all the

help he had given him

wanted the lunch to be a small token of his appreciation.

He

also paid C.O. 20 Dy which had been loaned him a year and a half

rememberance.

C. O. dropped Subject off "downtown and suggested

On 25 February 1964 the undersigned met with Clarence

Schmidt and Art Stimpson of OA Bonn to apprise them of the

Status of the WIROGUS case. Since Clarence S. was preparing

to départ PCS, C.O's discussion was primarily with Art S.,

Clarence's replacement:

c.

O. briefed Art on WIROGLI's background prior to

recruitment and his activities while associated with KUBARK.

C. O. reviewed HARVARD's attempt to prepare Subject for

resettlement and said that we are now in a position to quit

claim him and close the case and that we wanted to bring OCA

up-to-date on the status of Subject's case and to find out if

there are any loose ends from. Bonn's point of view

or HARVARD's

which should be tightened

up prior. to cutting Subject loose.

C. O. explained that since December 12, 1962 when OCA

received a query from the BFV regarding Subject,

HARvard had

been trying to reach the point where Subject could be ön his

OwD:

.C. 0.

explained that we had realized that after the

original political recognition iaterview fiasco had brought

Subject to the attention of the BFV, that to enable Subject to

emigrate from Germany or to stay bere without continuing

problems in the future would require preparing a complete life

history for Subject with a nes political recognition interview

story.

Both the Lebenslauf and

a new. interview story were

prepared. and copies of the old story were removed from the

various files and replaced by the new.

C. O. said that HARVARD

bad two questions for Bonn and that (1) at the time of the

original BFV interest in Subject had OCA promised Subject EOLD

be-resettled outside Germany? and (2) would-OCA know-if-the

BFV in Cologne had a copy of Subject's political recognition

interview

story?

Art brought. out. OCA's file on the case and

said to answer the: second question first it would appear from

COMMENTS:

C. O. met Subject as a result of a telephone call

requesting C. O's assistance. Subject told C. O. that 'he

bad gone to the local police revier and had tried to register

but that since he had neglected to take along a filled-out

Anne-debestatigung signed by the landlord he had been told

to go get the form, fifi it out property and then return. The

police had looked at his deregistration slip with the 2 March

date indicated and had told him to waste no time since an

Individual is required to deregister and re-register within a

pertad of 8

days and it was now the lOth of March.

Subject

said that since his rental contract dates from January 1 and

that date is indicated on the registration slip, the police

will question why he waited so long to register. C. O. told

him that the answer was simple and that he wished Subject would

not bother him

with such

small problems.

C. 0. told Subject

to get an Anmelda forn and

fill it out and have his landlord

sign that he moved into the apartment on I March and explain

to tan dandlard that he had been deregistered as of 2 March.

Subject said

that he had already figured this out but that he

wanted an excuse to meet C. O. and talk to him.

He showed C. O. a Munich Konto check for 4,000 D$ which

had received for developing a device reported in previous

contact reports and went on to say that his business trip to

Munich had been reasonably successful. He had discussed the

development of several new devices with the director of the

Munich firm and was now in the process of working on another

device for the firm.

He had made arrangements whereby he would

-The firm had also asked Subject if he would be willing to

He was told to go to the local Police Revier and register.

Subject was given a copy of his new political recognition

interview story and was asked if he had any questions regarding

his legend. Subject replied that the story was so long he

could not possibly memorize it completely. C. O. told him that

the intent was to provide in detail any and all facts which in

the future might be of importance to him in the conduct of his

affairs.

-Subject was asked about his plans for the future. His

answer was that the Director of the firm (reported in contact

report 17 February 1964) had invited him to come to Munich on

3 March 1964 to discuss, among other things, the possibility of

employing Subject in the engineering department.

This plus the

fact that Subject has signed an agreement with BOHLER & CO.

OPTICAL FACTORY, FF/M to act as an engineering consultant might

chable him to realize his ambition, i.e. to have a position

rather than an ordinary job.

c. O. quitclaimed Subject and wished him luck.

Subject asked that C. O. be sure to let the higher echelon

know

he appreciates all that has been done-for him.

Subject sald that although official contact is at an end

that C. 0. would not reject an invitation for a friendly

get together from time to time.

C. 0. replied that if business

matters permitted he would be glad to mect Subject.

Subject jovially announced

that they would probably meet

that he first learn Russian if he is to pass himself

could see no reasop

to prevent Subject from visiting any country

or even entering as a technical representative. c. O. told him

that he is soundly, if not perfectly, documented and that we can

do no better and that he should never forget that his fingerprints

are the weakest. links.

C. O. sald good-by and parted company. Case closed.

C. O. laughed in @turn and said he would indeed be glad to see

Subject on his own and added that he had no doubts re:

Subject's ability to get money but that he is only hoping Subject

would use methods acceptable to society (chuckle).

Since Subject had both English and German versions of his

legend, C. O. took the English

if Subject should submit a Lebenslauf, in connection with a

Subject this conns fridas but there were a few loose ends which

mac to be cleared up before we could take this final step.

C. Osald that in revlewing the new political recognition

ve had noted that the new story did not

Sanders to Frant Simon Sanders.

C. O. asked if the new copy

would have to be changed or replaced.

John made a

the change of nane should really be and told C. O ku have all

the new copies changed to read Frank Simon Sanders.

John said

that this sort of thing happens from

time to time; that it is

just a simple error and will raise no eyebrows.

2.C. O. then brought up

the point that Subject's

Reiseausweis will expire

in October 1964 and we and Subject were

wondering if Subtett would run into any problem when be went

to the Polizel Presidum to get a Reiseausweis rencwal. -John

said that there rould be no problems that he could see: but to

make sure that there is no slip-up, we should pick up Subject's

current Reiseaus els and

if Sam prepares the necessary Antrag,

John will get us a new Reiseausweis within one of two days, dated

with a current date.

C. 0. said he would pick up

Subject's

Reiseauswels and give it to Sam this week and Sam will prepare

the necessary papers for a new Reiseauswels, plus a 1964

Lohnsteurkarte, ard a deregistration slip.

interview story. C. O. went on to say that we were wondering

if a copy of the story might have gone to the BFV in Bonn, and

that Wilms had missed one of the old copies when he recalled

all copies recently and replaced them with the new story. John

said that Camp Zirndorf processes 50 to 100 cases a month, one

half of which arezinterest in one way or another to the BFV.

He said that what

had gone to Bonn was very. likely an excerpt,

that the entire story would not have been sent to Bond. John

went on to say that with the new copy in the file, if this

excerpt should come to light in the future, a check would merely

indicate that someone had made a mistake and the matter would be

dropped. John added that he knows ve are concerned about this

case, but that he sees no reason why there should be any trouble

of any kind. He said that the only problem will be if Subject

himself comes to tbe attention of the authorities because of

some ShAnanigans on his part.

The director also asked Subject, if the company supplied alm

his ideas for improving the machine in time for the Hanover

Fair. Subject claims that he told the director he would

modify the machine by the end of March and if the device

works properly he would expect payment of 20,000 DN.

C. 0. told Subject

that as soon

the varlous files and the one remaining copy of the old story

removed from its file, Subject would be

Chief, Resettlement Branch

LEGEND MATERIAL REQUIRED FOR HIROGUE S

RESETTLEMENT

Since May 1962 HARVARD has been attempting to

work out a sound resettlement for WIROGUE. Headquarters:

had authorized HARVARD to assist Subject in his desire to

Imigrate to South America.

As the first step in this

program, Subject was interylewed at Camp King and a story

adequate to insure West German political recognition was

presented to the German interviewer.

Certain details of this

stors aroused the interest of the German government and it

was necessary for steps to be taken to kill this unwanted

interest.

This development would not in itself have been

too much

of a problem,

but in subsequent investigation of

the procedure to be followed for immigration to South America,

HARVARD learned that applicants are screened very thoroughly,

given aptitude tests, etc. etc. This screening is performed

by ICEM who is charged by the South American countries with

the responsibility for insuring that any immigrant is

thoroughly desirable. It became obvious to HARVARD that

Subject would reguire a legend sufficient to withstand detailed

interviews and sufficient to qualify him in some profession

on the basis of his actual ability- - the

existing political

recognition story does not provide this.

2.

In discussions with Wilms and wagner of the 513th,

it

sas. decided that a detailed life story should be prepared

by CABEZONE

and on the basis. of this story a new political

recognition interview should be written which would replace

those copies of the old interview now in the varfous files:

A reasonably complete legend previously prepared by Alex

Lembersky is attached and with additional information can

be used almost as is.

Since this life story will be notional,

it will have to be written up in sufficient detail and

plausible enough to provide Subject with the information

needed for the filling out of various future job applications;

to stand-up under detatled interviews to whick he may

in the

future be subjected and f imtsration ever takes place, to:

satisfy those requirements. HARVARD feels that this cap only

properly be prepared by a native born Russian. HARVARD, there-

fore, requests Chief, Stage I to assign a Stage interrogator

knowledgeable on the Soviet Union to prepare a life story to

Include a detailed escape from Georgia to Turkey.

work but due

We realize that this request could involve considerable

to the peculiar problems inherent in the wiROGUE

cases it is vitai that we prepare Subject for a new life as

a completely different person.

Only by doing the job properly

now will we be able to place ourselves

in a position to

satisfactorily sever subject's dependence upon KUBARK and

reduce to a minimum the need for future contacts.

Case Officer noticed that on the patent application,

Subjert was ilsted.as

an ensincer living at Kuhwaldstr 51.

When Case Ofricer questioned him regarding the use of this

Kuhwaldstr address Subject said that he felt it was necessary

for the following reasons:

1. While riding with Naegele to the Taunus

one day and passing Camp King, Herr Naegele

had remarked that the Camp was the place where

Americans trained commandos and others for

work of a secret nature.

Since Case Officer had told Subject many

months ago: that we intended to give up the

Kuhweidst apartment and he subject wanted to

do everything he could to make arrangements to

establish bimself on his own he bad decided it

would be best to use the Kuhwaldstr address

because he would be receiving mall and did not

want to inconvenience Case Officer by having

him be a delivery boy.

3.:

Subject felt that the use of this address

would not break

security since he would pot use

that address for any official reason, eg:,

police matters, etc., etc.

Case Officer still reamed Subject out thoroughly and told

him that even though our attempts to maintain maxinum security

were probably

successful we should at least try.

rould succeed in antagonizing:

and told Subject they might as

Subject kept insisting that he would

do nothing to jeopardize what Case Officer's organization was

trying to do for him and assured Case Officer he thinks out

very carefully what the results of any particular course of

action might be

Case Officer told Subject that he is trying to complete

his legend and once everything is in order with the German

that he spoke German and could probably get a good job here

but that if he went to S. A. he had few real prospects and

the fact that if he did not speak Russian he would be suspect

in the eyes of the russian emigrees there.

C. O, told him that it was his opinion we should prepare

that it would not require that he know a great deal of Russian

1.

Subject could stay right here in Germany, find

2

Subject would have to study Russian for six months,

since it is impossible for anyone to have been

in the Soviet Union without knowing

some Russian.

At the end of that time he would try

to process him for S.A. (Subject was not told this but

it is obvious that if he does not know Russian,

once he gets to S.A., the first Russian he comes in

3.

There is a possibility he could be gotten to Chile.

(John Wilms has suggested that through his contacts

three possibilities

Blake rau told trat we have a case which de wish to helo itsigrate

Blake was told that we had hoped to send Subject

directly to ICE(Subject canrot lacigrate directly to South gerica

but cust have all arrangements handled through I Cad) cut that lo

exploratory talks

With Gus Emendorf (Chief, ABRP) Gus had been of the

opinion that our case would be thoroughly Investigated, Irterviewed,

tested, etc., procedures which we wished to avoid since ther right

bring to light the fact that our caße was not the person he clained

to be.

Blake agreed that Gus was correct in his thinking trat if subject

went to ical on his own he would 'be interviewed and trade tested for

a special program set up by ICEl to supply SA witn certain higher

types of skilled specialists, out. At*raph foreren, snop peragers,

etc.

Blake suggested

that re make our case USEP sligible through AFR

and then refer him to ICE.

This procedure would

prob bly give Subject

nore status in ICEM's ejes and eliminate sone of the background

investigution. Subject would also be referred as a self-pajer ceaning

he wouid nave the funds to pay his own

transportation.

Blake asred if Subject would have a job waiting for him and was told

that he mould hube no job but would hive a letter attesting to the

fact that there waa 83,000.00 being held for him insalary ard bonuses

which he had reeived while working for the Army. Blake thou this

Blake feels that coring to ICEM as a USEP case through APRP

Subject would probably be accepted without question since he no la

have been thorougly clacked out by Camp Kirg and APRF thua eltrinating

the need for irvestagatory action by ICEM.

C/O told

SECRETA

MEMORINDUN FOR THE RECORD

29 January 1963

-SUBJECT: WIROGUE

On this date George List and the undersigned discussed

CO's plans and thinking regarding WIrOGUE's immigration to

South America. Case Officer explained that since Subject is

an exceptional case and not a bona fide refugee, we will not

be able to take advantage of the normal immigration channels

without taking the chance of being involved in fraud. Case

offfcer further explained that since WIROGUE's contact with

the Consulate of his choice will not in any way be controlled

by us, this immigration attempt will be a one shot operation

and if it fails, we will not have

a second chance because if

he is turned down for immigration,

any subsequent.attempts he

makes to immigrate will bring to light the fact that he had

previously applied for immigration to another country. It is

essential therefore that we plan for every contingency. Case

Officer feels, based on HARVARD's experience, that when WIROGUE

applies for immigration he will be required to give

(1). the name and address of his present employer and

probably the name of his supervisor and telephone number.

(2) what type of work he has been doing;

(3) proof that he will be able to support himself for

a minimum of two years at the rate of$125 a month.

(4) proof of his professional qualifications.

(5) birth certificate.

(G) detailed information regarding his employment and

residence addresses in the Georgian SSR

(7) details of the war-time military service.

Case Oificer said that early next week he will meet with

Wagner and wiilms of the sigth and explain the above. if it

is possible he will get them to agree to provide the details

of (1) above in the event the Consulate should call as part

of the routine immigration processing. (2) above will be taken

care of in the same manner. Regarding (3), Headquarters has

given us authority to expend up to $3,000 and Case Officer will

he Sisth of this.

They will be asked to provide a letter

if required, stating that Subject has been associated with

them (whatever cover organization they wish to use) since his

defection In July 6a and has roughly $3,000 in salary and bonuses

being held for him. Regarding (4) whether or not is is adviseable

to provide Subject with proof of his professional qualifications

will be discussed with the 513th. (5) above, a birth certificate

will probably not be necessary since so many defectors do not

have these documents with them.

Information on employment and

residences will be worked up by the Case Officer from past.

(6) above -

this information may also be acquired through facilities of SR 6.

After discussions with the 513th, Case Officer will tell

WIROGUE that we have been informed by Headquarters that if

Subject still desires to immigrate to South America and is

successful in immigrating, we have authority to provide financial

assistance during the transistion period up to $125 a month.

Since Case Officer knows WIROGUE, the next question will be,

"How long will I receive this $125 a month? Case Officer will

Case Officer

opened the letter and found it to be from aLt. Zircle of the

Transportation Corps

The lt mentioned that he and his friend

had enjoyed their conversation with Subject at the Bahnhof a

short time ago and had found him very interesting. The Lt.

sald he received a great deal of pleasure from meeting people

such

as Subject with such interesting backgrounds.

He suggested that he and Subject meet for dinner in the

near future.

case micer took ith letter to Bob Bullock, told him a

little btt about Subject's past and suggested that something

be done to prevent the Lt. from continuing his friendship with

Subject, since Case Officer felt that WIROGUE would probably

use the Lt. for whatever he could get out of him. Bullock

said he would have CID contact the Lt. and tell him to lay off

for his own good. Bullock promised to find out if the Lt.

success of his invention is not forthcoming,

is to get a patent on his

Invention so he can negotiate at a later date from South America.

Case Officer feels that this is about the best we can expect from

Subject.

Case Officer has discussed

this situation regarding the patent

with John Morrison of

the legal staff, who says that he will at least try

to find out if this patent attorney is qualified and successful.

NOTE: Case Officer has learned that the patent laws in Germany are somewhat

peculiar in that a patent attorney is a technical qualified man who can

obtain patents on subjects in which he cas specialized and for waich he

has received a specialized education but he is not an attorney in the sense

tat he can deal with any legal questions which arise in the course of

patent procedures or litigation in patent matters. Normally, an Individual

who intends to get a patent will hire an attorney who will contact a patent

attorney. Between the two of them they can handle all problems and procedures

involving a patent.

This also can de worked in reverse.

This dispatch covers the WIROGUE case from Nay. 1962

to March 1964.

Subject arrived in FRANKFURT/MAIN on 22 May 1962 and*

immediately made telephone contact with CABEZONE:

who, he had been told, would explore KUBARK employment

possibilities for him. He in the meantime would be attempting

to market a telephone answering device which he had invented,

milion francs which had been misappropriated by members of

the Congolese Defense Ministry: KUBARK's reasons for establish-

ing contact were dictated, however, by the need to relieve

Subject ofthis KUBARK supplied false Austrian passport in the

name of Reiner, the need to institute

action which would encourage him to establish himself as a

contributing member of society and, above all, prevent his

return to the Congo.

and

put up in a safehouse. He was relieved of his documents

under the pretext that they were to be photographed and he

would not need them for the time being since he would be given

an

identity document. for use during the period of time. he would

be in KUBARK custody:

LACKLEN explained that as an administrative

officer he was interested only in taking care of nis immediate

needs but soon

however he would be introduced

to one who's

business would be to work with him in an attempt to resolve his

problems.

Since it had been decided that Subject was primarily a

resettlement problem, Orme K. DARONNAT Of HARVARD WaS

introduced to Subject...

DARONNAT told Subject that he would be

working with him during his stay in Frankfurt while we were

awaiting word

on whether or not his services were needed by

the Government. Subject stated that his greatestwish was to

work for the

"Company".

If this was not to be,

he hoped he

would be helped to legalize and immigrate to South America..

He emphäsized his obligation to complete his mission for the

C.D.F. and claimed also he had to retürn

to the Congo to

conclude his contract even if we decided to emplohim.. c. O.

told him our first

order of business was to establish

the need

for his services

and

in -the

meantime he could

to

market his invention.

HaRvARD needed time to establish Headouarters Interest

in the amount and type of assistance Subject should be given.

Also he sas still an unknown quantity, restless, and from

early cable traffic a potential troublemaker.

In view of these

considerations we

were anxious to make his stay in Frankfurt

reasopably pleasant. and reduce.

his desire to return to the!

Congo, therefore, he was provided with subsistence and

confortable quarters.

Frontedic the free subes was issue e thered at the place

Therefore,

Frendenpass might well be a short range solution unless Subject

could get an immigration visa to desired country of resettle-

ment in a short time.

on the other hand the issuance of a

Retseausteis could compietely legalize Subject,

but would

have to be issued on the basis of a false defection story and

should not be done unless absolutely necessary.

Subject

stated that he hated Germans and no matter what happened would

not Stay in Germany He suggested that he be helped to

immigrate to the U.S., Canada, England, Australia, etc. C. O.

told him that with his criminal record of arrest and

imprisonment in France

immigration to other than S.A. was out

of the question and even this was in doubt.

He stated if

KUBARK: employment was not possible he would hope to get legal

documentation in the name of. de Panaskhet (his brother's

name) and take up legal residence somewhere.

By this time (June) HARVARD C.O. had an inkling that

Subject was not eager to return to the Congo but surmised

that his nuisance value might be such that he could parlay his

position into something better.

HARVARD C.O. felt that

Subject's dislike for the Germans was real but was emphasized

by him in order to benefit as

much as possible from a

prolongation.of his new association with KUBARK. He also

stated that he was willing to discharge any responsibility

to the Congolese by mail, thereby confirming C.O.'s suspicion

that he did not in fact want to return to the Congo and was

only interested in

prolonging his stay in FF/M and benefiting

therefrom.

## Page 102

In July 1962 Headquarters advised HARVARD to provide

Subject with resettlement assistance including help in

immigrating to South America. Consequently, he was told

that although we appreciated his past service the economy

drive in Washington precluded employing him in any capacity.

He was bld that we were authorized to help him realize his

stated desire to immigrate to SA. but that we would not be

able to "wave a magic wand" and have him settled there with

a job and a rosy future.

he was told we would help him in

whatever areas

seve to the pe blend hat rep ould be s to tedure to the

Subject at this point wasso discouraged by his inability

to sell is lovention, the realization that his services were

not needed by KUBARK.and weeks of inactivity that he willingly

agreed to forego returning to the Congo and give up all

documentation in the name of Reiner if something could be

done to give him hope for the future.

Headquarters had recommended that Subject be resettled on

the basis of a backstopped Fremdenpass; however,

Clarance

W. LEIBROCK (MKTOPAZ) and DARONNAT after much discussion of

the relative merits of the types of documentation available,

decided' that only a Reiseausweis would stand up under thee

investigation of immigration authorities d

in addition, 'it

was felt

that there was no guarantee Subject would be going to

South America.

Therefore,

if he were required to stay in

Germany for a prolonged period of time, it would be best to

provide him with complete FEDREP recognition processing

resulting in a Reiseauswels. A subsequent discussion with

ODIBEX Camp King reps confirmed this reasoning and, with the

concurrence of

Acting Chief

AD/FI, Subject was briefed by

Camp King representatives and then interviewed for political

recognition.

He received political recognition on the basis

of a fabricated story in which he purported to be a Georgian

who defected from East Berlin while with a tourist group.

HARVARD felt that progress was now being made but a

temporary setback resulted from a query initiated in December

1962 bj. CAVATA, to OCA Liaison Officer Bonn requesting full

traces;

Interrogation reports and

all information available

on Subject.

David R. REINBOLD of HARVARD informed OCA by

cable and in a subsequent visit to Bonn that Subject's name,

George SANDERS, story submitted for recognition, etc. were

complete fabrications

to insure that WIROGUE received political

recognition and a Reiseausweis. It was explained that WIROGUE

---

## Page 103

was strictly a HARVARD agent resettlement case of no AIS ops

interest and not a routine CABEZONE case.

OCA stated that

the political recognition interview story had naturally drawn

the interest and attention of CAVATA:

OCA

advised REINBOLD that CAVATA would be kept out of the case

by being told Subject was of continuing AIS ops interest and

HARVARD could go about its resettlement efforts.

Subject by this time had agreed to immigrate to any

South American country with the exception of Argentina, where

he claimed he had acquaintances who were not kindly disposed

toward him At first Subject suggested that he go on a

tourist visa and apply for immigration status after his arrival.

Although this sugsestion was quite sensible

and valid DARONNAT

knew that his reasons were: 1) with a tourist visa, he had

SonS of haves KUBARK finance him from country to country

until he found exactly what would please him, and 2) he knew

that with a tourist visa he could return

to Europe without

having comnitted himself irrevocably to immigration status

with all its attendant responsibilities.

Available South American immigration data indicated that

a prospective immigrant would have to have personal qualifications

sufficient to make him an attractive prospect plus proof of

financial solvency sufficient to provide self-support at the

rate of $125 per month for two years. Headquarters approved

the expenditure of $3,000-for this purpose and discussions

with UKTOPAZ and Camp King resolved the necessary documentation

problems.

Fully documented and armed with the assurance that there

would be financial assistance available during his first

months in South America, Subject applied at the local Colombian

Consulate for permission to immigrate.

HARVARD had hoped that

letters of sulvency and letters of recommendation would be

sufficient to enable Subject to process with a minimum of red

tape. This was not to be and Subject was informed he could

only

immigrate by processing through the Intergovernmental

Committee for European Migration (ICEM).

This problem was discussed with a cleared officlal from

Refugee Migration Section AMCONGEN,

Munich, and the Chief

CABANTILLA. HARVARD was informed that European refugees

of

immigrating to South America are processed through ICEM thereby

eliminating

the need for individual countries to

maintain

immigration

offices and welfare staffs.

Unfortunately, since

---

## Page 104

÷5-

ICEM is responsible for the immigration processing,

it is

determined to pass only high level types and,

therefore,

-conducts stiff

security investigations and gives detailed

interviews and job testing to all prospective immigrants:

By now it was apparant that if the disappointments and

frustrations connected with

this case were ever to end a

reappraisel must be made to decide whether or not to go ahead

and subject WIROGUE: to several possibly very searching

interviews.

There was also the possibility he would be inter-

Viewed In Russian (practically non-existant) and Georgian

Jess than fluent). With these language deficiencies we.

knew he would be immediately suspect if interviewed by any

recent refugee from the Sovtet Unions he were hampered by

not beies able tonsure Subject's sooth processing through

ICEM, and by the fact that if we did help him to process ve

would be making USEP, ICEN and CANANTILLA a party to esaud

with the danger of aby slip-up causing embarrassment to KUBARK,;

and to the Federal Republic.

We were not sure that

the aforementioned risks were worth taking and the problems

worth trying to resolve when it was obvious to HARVARD C.O.

that if Subject did get to South America and became disenchanted,

his first stop would be the local U.S. Consulate or Embassy

where he would

ask to see the KUBARK representative

force KUBARK to become directly involved in his personal

problems

In spite of the hundreds of hours of Case Officer time,

many discussions necessary to pull

together adequate information

regarding immigration, etc,

HARVARD was faced with the realiza-

tion that to prepare Subject for South American immigration

could take many more months. We were faced with the fact that

until Subject was provided with a detailed life history

containing the information required by prospective employers

and/or immigration authorities he was not in a position

resettled anywhere, let alone South America.

We knew a new

approach would have to be tried if HARVARD was ever to be in

a position to satisfactorily sever Subject's dependence upon

KUBARK and reduce to a minimum the need for future contacts.

HARVARD C.O. felt that Subject should be told outright that

immigration to South America was not practicable under the

present circunstances and what

would be done would be to

provide him with a detailed life history with enough factual

information needed for the filling out of any future job

applications, to stand up under detailed interviews,

immigration ever

took place, to satisfy immigration requirements.

## Page 105

DARONNAT told Subject that any South American imigration

thoughts should be shelved,

that he should work and establish

himself in Germany and if he interded to immigrate in the

future he would have to do it on his own

It was pointed

out that he would have to study and learn Russian, that aby

professed Soviet refugee arriving in South America without

Russtan would be immediately suspect by the emigres there:

ODIBEX authorities at Camp King had readily agreed that

Subject's original political recognition interview story did

HARVARD's problem was explained to Chief, Stage I, CABEZONE

who assigned Gerald H. BESDINS to prepare a life story to

include a detailed escape from the Georgian S.S.R. to Turkey.

By

1964, an excellent legend had been

written, a new political recognition interview story prepared

and substituted for the old and to HARVARD's satisfaction for

the first time since Subject had arrived in HARVARD's custody,

the way was clear for a final resettlement.

DARONNAT informed

Subject that the time had come to part company, that he was

completely legalized and documented and was now in a position

to take his place in society. Subject was given his legend

In German, complete legal documentation, one month's final

subsistence and, since he had taken over

a dropped CABEZONE

safehouse, was given dishes and varjous items to set up

housekeeping.

He was quitclaimed and warned that he

should

always keep in mindithe consequences of any action on his

part which would result in having his fingerprints taken.

(Subject has often expressed the wish to immigrate to the

U.S. or even Canada or Australia and with his new identity

could probably do so. He has been told that these countries

do thorough security investigations and a check with Interpol

would disclose his true identity.

HARVARD has established

that Interpol has no interest in

Subject but we feel his

ignorance

of that fact provides us with some control over

any steps he might take to emigrate from Germany. Subject

has been told however that there is nothing to prevent him

from visiting other couptries of even

entering as a technical

I paid no tuition and was given

a small stipend just enough for a bare living.

The hostel

accommodations where I shared a room with three other students

were free.

On the first floor of the technicun building,

near the

HISTORY OF ARRESTS:

22.

In June 1962, Iwas approached by the rayon militia at w

place of work and was

taken to the militia offices where

was accused of being a long standing member of a

Georgian resistance group and of making anti-government

statements.

Although 1 bad actually made such remarks on

occasions.and was therefore guilty.cf the latter charge, I

noticed that the militia did not have sufficient information

on this subject and I denied all accusations:

I could not

figure out who was behind the report.

After prolonged

interrogation, durips which I was extensively questioned on

my biography, parents, army service, contacts, etco, I was

released with the warning that I was not to leave the

area for the time being and that I would be contacted in the

near future by the militia. Except for this case, I was

never arrested or detained by militia or security organs.

MEMBERSHIP IN POLITICAL PARTIES OR ORGANIZATIONS:

I never belonged to the Communist Party.

I was urged to

Jo1n the Konsomol in 1937 while at the Tbilisi Elektro-

Technicum, and was sponsored there by two of my class-nates,

each of whom had more

than two years of Komsomol standing.

I submitted the application to the local Komsomol yacheyka

(ceil) and at a general meeting of the cell members my

application was discussed and I told my life story and answered

questions put to me by the members. After I was accepted,

I received my membership card in about two months fron

the

city rayon committee of the Koasomol in Tbilisi

after which

I had to attend meetings. and pay

very

small dues

I never

held any official position with the Komsomol organization.

When I left Tbilisi, I had to deregister from the Tbilisi

organization and register with the local organization at my

new place of residence in Mikha Tskhakaya (usually referred

to by the local population siply as 'Tskhakaya'). The same

proceedure had to be repeated upon my departure to and

discharge from the army (deregistration from the old

organization and registration at the new place).

Upon ny

return from the army to Tskhakaya, I never registered with

• the local organization again.

When I started to work

in Tskhakaya, I was automatically

enrolled, in the prof-soyuz (trade unions) where I was a

passive.

member paying my dues (something like l% of my salary)

to the trade union organizer of MTS (prof-org) and attending

the obligatory meetings

from time to time:

I: never took

"any advantage of trade union sembers privileges such as the

cut-rate

accomnodations in rest homes (putevka v dom otdykha).

23. CONNECTIONS WITH ANY INTELLIGENCE SERVICES:

I never had auy

contacts with intelligence services.

never approached to serve in any capacity for Soviet security

organs:

24. DEFECTION AND ESCAPE:

A. s

MOTIVATION:

In spite of being born and raised in a Communist country,

I,at an early age began to understand that real freedom

did not exist for the individual. It was also clear to

me that personal advancement did not depend on talent and

integrity but on the degree of one's political activity.

I analyzed the Communist lies seeing reality so different

from the official propoganda.

During and after the war,

I met people

who visited Western countries and was able

to benefit fron the particles of truth about a different

life there from the even sometimes very carefully worded

reports

O1, those

people.

After I purchased a good radio

of Mir' make in

1956, I started to listen intensively

to

foreign broadcasts.

For a long time I cultivated the

idea of eventual escape from the USSR where I had no

relatives, no family, no possibilities for advancenent

and a decent life. My anti-government sentiments which

developed as time passed became stronger and stronger,

and it became more and more difficult for me to

hold

myself back and not to express them openly, which I did

anyway on several occasions.

My Involument with the

militia and the unfavorable developments in my personal

life accelerated my plans for defection.

B.

TECHNIQUES OF ESCAPE:

On 25 June 1962, three days after my experience

with the

militia, I left my residence at 0700 as I normally would

to go to work.

I walked out of town toward Samtredia.

I wore my regular clothing, had 80 rubles and

small

hand bag.

I did not want to take the train being afraid

of militia surveillance. After I walked two or three kilo-

meters on the highway, I got a ride on a truck from a

near-by collective farm which

was headed in the same

direction.

I got off the truck downtown in Samtredia and

paid the driver one ruble, then walked toward the railroad

station.

Here. I

purchased the ticket

for Batumi and

boarded the train

at 1150 arriving in Batumi at 1415.

I

found safe place and slept until dark. I started off

on toot

from Batumi and followed the sea shore until I

reached the old shooting range about i 1/2 or 2 kn to

the south. Here l'entered the water at about 2200 hours,

after destroying my passport (the rest of my documents

were left at home) and burying my clothing and bag. I

knew from prevlous study of a map at home that I had to

swim some 18 km. to Turkish territory. I swan all night ei

and was not sure if I had reached Turkish soil, but l

being exhausted, I came ashore at about 0300 or 0400 hours.

The point where i stepped out was on the gradient of a

steep slope. There I saw the Silhouette of a hut and

went in. There was an old discarded electric notor 1b

the hut. From the Russian description on the motor,

understood that I was still in Russia.

I hid in the

underbrush near-by and spent the rest of the night and

the following day there

When it was getting dark, I

climbed the slope to observe the area.

I walked for a

while hearing voices in Russian coming from the shore.

I saw a dark object on the sea which resembled a submarine.

I continued walking near the shore and around 2200 ör

2300 hours I entered the water and started to swim 3 kmi

off shore and then parallel to it.

When I came into the

range of a search light which swept the sea, I submerged.

When I came to the surface the search light

swept over me

but nothing happened and I knew I had not been discovered.

I continued to swim until I was completely exhausted, and

several hours before dawn went ashore and hid in a cave

opposite two big rocks in the sea near the shore. I

remained

there

until morning.

The next morning I climbed

up the

slope where I saw a stone structure resembling a

grave.

I went in and observed the land around me from a

Small

opening. I say a large village which I later learned

was Kemal-Pasha. I thought at first that a minaret was

an observation tower.

I also presumed that this was the

village of Sarpi, still on Soviet territory.

I was

very

thirsty

and climbed down the hill to a near-by stream

to

drink water.

I met an ll or 12 year old boy whom I

addressed in Russian but the boy drew away from me.

Being

still not sure as to where I was, I walked in the stream

for a while to hide my footprints. Then I hid in the

underbrush.until it grew dark.

I came out and went around

the village to its opposite end

There I entered the town

and knocked on the door of a house

situated on à hillside.

I called out in Russian.

Even though

I heard voices and

footsteps in the house

Meanwhile, some persons carrying sticks and axes came.

into the courtyard. I again tried to explain that i came

from Russia and wanted to remain in Turkey. The men

took me to the military authorities in Kemal-Pasha..

When I dived into the sea in Batumt, I was wearing swimming

trunks, a belt and a pair of fins.

There was a clasp

knife in my belt, a sack peedle for stinging myself 10

case of a cramp, my money in a nylon bag,

three bars of

chocolate, a compassand two Phenamin tablets to increase

my energy

in a separate nylon bag. Except for the

occasional search light in the

sea, which I avoided by

diving, I did not encounter any other obstacles on my way.

I did not inform anybody about my escape plans and díd not

receive any help from anybody.

From Kemal-Pasha where I was given some clothing, I was

taken by car to Erzerum and from there by train to

Istanbul refugee center. I was there about a week and

was taken to Germany with the assistance of US authorities

on Friday 6 July 1962.

DOCUMENTS:

A: PASSPORT:

I received my first three-yeär passport at #17 militia

(passport desk) office of Molotovskiy rayon of Tbilisi,

where resided at that time. The passport was a single

sheet of paper with my photo and biographic data on it.

In 1939 I exchanged it for a new five-year passport at

the Mikha Tskhakaya rayon militia.

This passport was of

= a regular booklet form and along with my photo and bio

data,

had a stamp of propiska (registration with militia)

which stated the date of my arrival in this town and my

residence address.

sben I was drafted to the army,

turned in my passport and military booklet to the

servoce nont that tie e receded onew cive-year passport

from the same militia office with the propiska showing

my

new

address.

In 1951, I exchanged my passport for thé

new one which was valid for 10 years and which was

exchanged for another 10-year passport in 1961.

him that since he did not have a patent this would jose a problem and offered

bim 5,000 DM for ilis idea.

Subjeci told then he wouid give it to them outright

for $10,000.

Although they did not refuse his request, they told him they

would think it over and discuss it with the boss and would have to make a

patent search which would take up to 4 veeis.

Subjeci told them to go ahead

but not to try to pull any funny husiness since there were ways of proving

that the Idea was his and he. could offer it to otier firms..

He asked if there was some way of finding

COMMENTS

LACKLEN introduced DARONNAT as Mr. Murnann and explained

that he would now be working with Subject.

On the way to

lunch DARONKAT explained that he and Subject would be working

together to resölve whatever problems Subject might have.

During lunch, conversation was limited mostly to Subject's

Views on the

Congo situation and the

solutions. He also

expounded at great lengths on the fitttl of the Congoled and

the Belgians whom he would appear to dislike intensely.

Upon return

to the apartment. Subject was told that we

would

like to get him West German

documentation with political

recognition.

He was told that if we are successful he would be

documented as legally as possible under the circumstances and

would be in a position to begin a new life.

Subject was very

pleased but a bit skeptical that

we could accomplish this.

He

was asked to think carefully about his desire to use the name

David de Panaskhet since, if he

was wanted for breaking

1n France,

there could be a watch list for that name and it

paroll

could be assuned that since Panaskhet was his brother's name,

Subject might assume that name some day.

Subject stated that

someone was confused about his status in France, that he was

therefore, not done anything wrong in

leaving

not on parol and bad, He said that the worst that could happen

the country.

if he returned there would be for the authorities to ask him why

he had left the town he had been confined to.

His answer would

be that since they had restricted his movements he had left the

country (C. O. doubts that this is true but wored

not raise any

questions).

Subject was

name of David de. Panaskhet.

Since HARVARD is awaiting

proposal regarding Subject's resettlement, C. O. suggested that

he investigate the possibility of marketing his telephone

answering device.

Im Juni 1962 kam diemilitia zu nir und bracht nich von meinem

Arbeitsplatz

zu ihrer Pienststelle wo 1ch beschuldigt wurde

ein langJahriges Mitglied einer georgischen Widerstandsgruppe

zu sein und regierungsfeindliche Ausserungen gemacht zu haben.

Obwohl ich solche Bemerkungen bei verschiedenen Gelegenheiten

gemacht hatte und deshalb schuldig im Sinne des letzteren Teils

der Anschuldigung war, konnte ich fühlen, dass die Militia nicht

genügend Informationen besass und ich verneintealle Anschuldi-

gungen. Ich konrite mir nicht derken wer dahinter steckte. Nach

langen Verhören, bei denen ich uber alle Einzelheiten meines

Lebens, Eltern, Militardienst, Kontakte, u.s.Me befragt wurde,

wurde ich mit einer Warnung entlassen das Gebiet nicht zu

verlassen und es wurde mir gessgt ich würde wieder von der

Militia hören. Mit dieser einsigen Ausnahme bin ich nie ver-

haftet oder verhört worden, weder bei der Militia oder anderen

Sicherheitsbehörden.

mehr als zwe1 Jahre Mitglied. Ich reichte nein Gesuch bei

der lokalen Konsonol jatschejke (Zelle) ein und bei einer

Zusammenkunft der Zellenmitglteder wurde mein Aufnahmege-

such besprochen, ich erzahlte meine lebensgeschichte und

beantwortete Pragen. Nachden ich-aufgenonnen worden war,

erhielt ich meine Mitgliedskarte In ungefähr zwei Monaten

von Stadt-Rayon Konitteo dos 1b11131 Komsonol; darauf hin

besuchte ich Versannlungen und zahlte kleine Beiträge. Ich

streichen lassen und mich an neuen Wohnort Micha Zchskaja

( bei der Bevolkerung gewöhnlich nur "Zchakaja" genannt ),

neu eintragen lassen. Dasselbe geschah als ich in die Armee

eintrat ( Ausstreichen aus der ilten Organisation und Ein-

schreiben an neuen Wohnort). Als ich nach der Entlassung von

der Armee wieder nach Zchakaja zurückkehrte liess ioh mich

nicht wieder in die lokale Organisation eintragen.

Als ich in Zchakaja zu arbeiten begann wurde ich automatisch

1n die (prof.-org ) Gewerkschaft eingeschrieben, in der ich

ein passives Mitglied war, das seine Beiträge ( etwas wie

1, meires Gehaltes ) an den Organisator der Gewerkschaft

von NTS bezahlte und von Zeit zu Zeit einer Pflichtversann-

der Mitgliedschaft wie ermässigte Preise in Ernolungsstätten

FLUCHT

A.

GRUNDE :

Trotzdem ich in einem konsunistischen land geboren

und erzogen worden war begann ich doch schon pruh-

zeltig zu verstehen, dass fur die Einzelperson keine

Préthelt bestand. Es war mir auch klar, dass person

licher Aufstles nicht von dem Talent und der Rechte

schaffenheit elnes Menschen abhing, sondern von dem

Ausness der politischen Betätigung: Ich sah durch die

konmuntatischen Lügen, da die Wirklichkeit so verschte-

den von der offiziellen Propaganda war. Während und

nach den Krieg traf ich lenschen die westliche lander

besucht hatten und ich war in der Lage Bruchstucke

der Wahrheit über den Unterschied in den Lebensarten

aus diesen Erzählungen abzuleiten, obwohl diese Be-

richte sehr vorsichtig vorgebracht wur den. Nachdem ich

1956 ein gutes Radio der"Wir" Marke kaufte hörte ich

sehr

oft ausländischen Stationen zu. Lange Zeit trug

ich mich mit der Idee aus den USSR zu fliehen wo ich

keine Fanilie, keine Verwandten und keine Aufstiegsnög-

I1chkeiten hatte. Meine feindliche Einstellung zur Re-

glerung wurde stärker und stärker mit der Zeit und es

wurde für mich immer schwieriger mich zu kontrollieren

und diesen Gefühlen nicht offen Ausdruck zu verleihen,

was ich dann doch einige Male tat. Meine Erfahrung mit

de= Militia und die Entwicklung meines persönlichen Le-

bens beschleunigte meine Fluchtpläne.

TECHNISCHE EINZELSITEN DER PLUCHT:

Am 25. Juni 1962, drei Tage nach meinen Erfahrungen

mit der Militia,verliess ich meine Wohnung un 7 Vor

fruh wie Jeden Tag un in die Arbeit zu gehon. Ich

verliess die Stadt zu Fuss in Richtung Santredia.

Ich trug meine normale Kleidung, hatte 80 Rubel bel

wir und ölne Handasche. Ich weste nicht den Zug zu

nehmen da ich. Angst hatte von der Militia überwacht

zu werden. Wechden ich 2-3 ku auf der Landstrasse ge-

gangen

war

murdo ich von einen Lastwesen eines nahe

gelegenen Kolchos mitgenommen, der in der gleichen Rich-

tung fuhr. Ich vorliess den lastwagen in der Stadtnitte

von Santredia, zanite dem Pihrer einen Rubel und ging

zur Elsenbahnstation; hier kaufte ich eine Fahrkarte

nach Batuni und nahn den Zug un 11.50der um 14.15 in

Batuni ankam. Ich fand einen sicheren Platz und schlief

bis zur Dunkelheit. Ich verliess Batumi zu Fuss entlang

des Seeuferg bis ich 1 1/2 oder 2 km südlich die alte

Schiess-Stätte erreichte. Hier cing ich un ungefähr

22 Unr ins Wasser, nachdem Ich meiren Pass zerstört

hatte ( die anderen Dokumente lless ich au Hause)

und vergrub reine kleider und Tasche. Ich wusste durch

das Studium einer Landkarte, dass ich ungefähr 18 km

zu schwimnen hatte un türkisches Gebiet zu erreichen.

Ich schwamn die canze Nacht und ich war nicht sicher

ob ich schon türkisches Gebiet erreicht hatte , aber

ich war erschöpft und schwann ungefähr un 3 Uhr oder

4 Unr. früh zum Ufer. An dem Punkt so ich ankam began

das Ufer steil anzusteigen. Ich sah die Silhuette einer

Hutte und ging hinein. Da fand ich einen älten elektri-

schen lotor, sussisch beschriftet, woraus ich ersah, dass

ich noch in Russland war. Ich versteckte mich in der Nähe

Im Gebüsch und verbrachte dort ale Nacht und den fol-

senden Tag. Als es dunkel wurde, kletterte ich den Ab-

hang hinauf um das Gelände au uberblicken. Ich sing

ein Stuck und hörte russische stimmen die von Ufer kamen.

Ich sah einen dunklen Gegenstand auf dem Wasser, welcher

wo ein Unterseebot aussah. ich ging weiter am ufer

entlang und un ungeführ 22 oder 23 Uhr ging ich ins

Wasser und schwamm 3 km hinaus und dann parallel zun

Uter. Als ich In die Reichweite eines Suchlichtes kam,

anwese aber nichts geschah und ich wusste, dass ich

wendeckt geblieben war. Ich schwamm bis zur Erschöpfung,

einige Stunden vor der Morgendämmerung schwann ich zum

Ufer und versteckte nich in einer Höhle zwischen zwei

Felsen in Meer in Ufernähe. Da verblieb ich zum Morgen.

Am nächsten Morgen kletterte Ich den Abhang hinauf, wo

1ch ein

steinernes Gebilde sah, das wie ein Grab aus-

Bah. Ich sing hinein und schaute mir die Umgebung durch

eine kleine Öffnung an. Ich sah ein kleines Dorf, später

lernte ich, dass es Kemal-Pascha war. Erst dachte ich

ein Minarett wäre ein Beobachtungsturm. Ich nahm an,

es wire das Dorf Sarpi noch immer auf russischem Boden.

Ich war sehr durstig und kietterte den Hügel hinunter

zu einem Bach um zu trinken. Ich traf einen ll oder

12 jährigen Buben den ich russisch ansprach, aber der

Bub lief weg. Ich war noch immer nicht sicher wo ich

war, ich Eing ein Stück im Bach un meine Fussabdrücke

zu verbergen. Dann versteckte ich mich 1m Gebüsch bis

zur Dunkelheit. Ich fing dann un das Dorf herum zun

anderen Ende. Ich betrat das Dorf und klopfte an die

Tur eines Hauses, das am Abhang eines Hügels lag Ich

rief in russischer Sprache. Ich horte Stimen und Fuss-

tritte im Haus, aber nenand offsete. Ich klettere auf

das Dach eines Stalles in Hof und verbrachte dort die

Nacht. Pruh an nachsten korgen rurde ich durch Gerausche

im Hof Geweckt. Ich sah einige Frauen und zwei Manner.

Ich näherte mich ihnen und versuchte mich aurch Zeichen-

sprache zu verständigen und zu erklären, dasa ich aus

Russland kam. In der Zwischenzeit waren yenschen mit

Stocken und Xxten aur den Höf gekoen. ich versuchte

weder zu erklären, dass ich aus Russland kine und in

der Turkel verbleiben nochte, Die Manner nahmen mich dann

zu den militarischen Behorden in Kemal-Pasche.

Als ich in Batunt ins Wasser ging,hatte ich Schwinnhosen

an, einen Gürtel und ein paar Schwm-flossen. Ich hatte

ein Mappmesser in Gürtel, einen Sack. Nadeln um nich zu

stechen im Falle eines Krampfes, rein Geld war in einen

Nylonsack, 3 Tafel Schockolade, ein Kompass und zwei

Phenamin Tabletten un meine Bnergie su heben, 1rfinem

anderen Nylorsack. Mit Ausnahme des Suchlichtes auf den

Wasser, das ich durch Tauchen zu ungehen suchte, gab es

keine anderen Hindernisse.

Ich hatte niemanden von deinen Fluchtplänen erzählt und

niemand hat mir dabel geholfen.

Von Kemal-Pascha, wo 1ch Kleider beken, wurde ich mit dem

Wagen nach Erserun gebracht und von dort mit den Zug nach

Istanbul ins Flüchtlingslager. Dort war ich eine Hoche

und wurde dann mit Hilfe von US Behörden am Freitag den

6. Jull 1962 nach Deutschland gebracht.
