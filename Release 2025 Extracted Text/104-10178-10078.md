*AMICE-3I invited to be delegate at ninth CLASC Consejo planned for

May 13-17 in Santo Doningo.

A-31 could be useful as reporter

and/or action agent since he is opposed to CLASC alliance with

Marxist groups and in opposition to Emilio Maspero.

**Based on recollection of A-31's previous performance ât Bogota

CLASC meeting,

in which AMICE-31

seemed inclined to Maspero,
