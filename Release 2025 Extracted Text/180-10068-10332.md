AGENCY FILE NUMBER

December 8, 1995

Status of Document:

Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 6

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors

including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United

States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 2

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could

reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and, that invasion of

privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

JUNE 14, 1977

CLARENCE DAY - INVESTIGATOR

It is my recommendation that

Clarence Day be hired as an investigator

for the JFK Task Force. His resume is very

impressive and his long career as a law en-

forcement officer certainly qualifies him

to be an investigator for this Committee.

Equally important were his re-

actions to the questions I posed to him.

He

came across as an intelligent man who is well

versed in the law as it applies to the rights

of individuals, and he impressed me as a man

who would be a valuable member of our task

force.
