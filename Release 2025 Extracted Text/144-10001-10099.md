29 Nov 63

The following transcription is the text of the note presented

on Tuesday night to the Mexican Embassy for the maltreatment of

the employee of the Cuban Consulate in Mexico City, SILVIA DURAN,

in relation to the request for a transit visa made by LEE HARVEY

OSWALD.

Regards,

I have the honor of addressing myself to Your Excellency

in order to expound the following:

Our embassy in the Republic of Mexico has informed this

Ministry that the employee of our consulate in Mexico City,

Mrs. SILVIA DURAN, of Mexican nationality, was detained by

agents of the Federal Police of your country, and also her

husband, on the night of Saturday, 23 November, and that,

furthermore, her home was violated, a search having been made

of it.

She was kept in prison until approximately midnight

and during her detention she was submitted to a violent and

coercive interrogation in relation to the request for a transit

visa made to our consulate in the month of September by

the United States citizen, LEE HARVEY OSWALD, accused of the

assassination of President KENNEDY.

Mrs. SILVIA DURAN told the aforesaid agents all she knew,

adhering strictly to the truth; in spite of which she was the

object of censurable treatment, going as for as to make

despicable insinuations and asking her about supposed personal

relations, even intimate, with Mr. OSWALD.. Furthermore, she was

physically mistreated by the agents of the Federal Police of

your country; as a consequence of which, she bears bruises on

her arms.

The Revolutionary Government feels that the gross, illegal

and unjustifiable manner in which the police arrested and

maltreated Mrs. DURAN corresponds to the plan of the reactionaries

that, in the United States, planned the assassination of KENNEDY

to promote a policy of retrogression and was continued on

infamous accusations against Cuba and other countries.

The gravity implicated by the conduct of the aforementioned

police agents cannot be dismissed by the Government of Cuba,

which considers this act a flagrant complicity of the members

of the Mexican Police with those who treacherously tried to

involve our country in the filthy crime.

The dispicabilities, coercious and physical aggressions

of which an employee of our consulate in Mexico City has been

the victim, constitute not only a criminal act which challenges

the judicial authorities of your country, but also the ignoring of

the minimal guarantees to which are accredited all the officials

and employees of a consular office. The transpired events are,

besides, totally unfriendly toward Cuba.

Therefore, the Revolutionary Government of Cuba feels

itself in the right and with the duty of presenting before

the Government of the United States of Mexico this protest

on stating

and stating to your illustrous government that the perpetration

of these acts damage the friendly relations between both

Governments, the maintenances of which have been of profound

and demonstrated interest to the people and the Revolutionary

Government of Cuba.

I take this opportunity to reiterate to Your Excellency

my highest esteem.
