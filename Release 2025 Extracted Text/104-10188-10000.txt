1. Station fully agrees with Headquarters concerning the value of
concentrating LIFEAT or LIENVOY coverage on suspected and/or known
Soviet, Satellite and Cuban agents residing in Mexico City. The Station
in the past has undertaken this type coverage and will continue such
coverage in the future as LIFEAT and LIENVOY facilities become avail-
able for assignment to these targets. As lieadquarters is aware, this Station
can and will cover any possible target Headquarters considers of high
enough priority to cover.
2. For example, Carmen BRUFAU Civit was covered for 1956, 1957,
1960 and 1961; the results were not considered of sufficient value to continue
the coverage.
3. Presently, Elena VASQUEZ Gomez, one of the persons referred
to in reference, works for General Lazaro CARDENAS del Rio, pro-
Communist former President of Mexico. Coverage of CARDENAS by
LIENVOY means a certain amount of coverage of VASUEZ Gomes.

(Audio Operation)
1. FI/INT files contain 37 positive information
disseminations attributed wholly or in part to Project LIFEAT
during the year 1 July 1961 through June 1962. They were concerned
principally with contacte between Maxican Communists or leftists
and Cubans or individuals of the Soviet Eloc, and with the travel
of Latin Americans to the Soviet Bloc and Cuba. Six reports of
particular interest consisted of information on Transcontinental S.A.,
a company allegedly engaged in the illegal transshipment of US goods
to Cuba. Other reports of significance dealt with the contacts and
activities of former Guatemalan President Juan Jose AREVALO Barmeja,
now living in Mexico. There was reporting on Kicaraguan and Spanish
exile activity in Mexico and on the revolutionary sentiment and
expectations of other Latin American nationals.
2. LIFEAT has provided positive intelligence of value and of
relevance to customer requirements and to objectives of the PNIO.
It has been pointed out in the renewal request that the production
of positive information is incidental to the projects primary function
as a support and CI/CE operation.
3. RENEWAL IS RECOMMENDED.

LIFEAT Project Renewal Request
1. It is requested that the attached LIFEAT Renewal Request
be approved for the period of 1 July 1962 through 30 June 1963 in
the amount of $99,000.00, all of which falls within FY 1963.

2. This Project provides the Mexico City Station with a
unilateral telephone tap operation which has been in existence
for the past 11 years.
3. While the primary object of this Project is not the pro-
duction of positive intelligence, it was in whole or in part the
source of 30 positive information disseminations. In addition to
thio production and support of other Station operations, it
provides ODENVY with information concerning the American Commu-
nist Group in Mexico.
4. Emergency recontact instructions have not been estab-
lished for the agents of this Project since it is believed the
operation would cease in case a situation should arise where they
would be applicable.
5. No training programs for any LIFEAT personnel are
anticipated during the renewal period.
6. W Division recommenda renewal of the LIFEAT Project
based on the attached field request. WH Division has cut the

I. Product of the Project
A. Soviet Coverage
PROJECT LIFEAT
PROJECT REVIEW
As noted in last year's Project LIFEAT renewal request, LIFEAT coverage
of the official Soviet installation was discontinued on 22 June 1960 when the
parallel Itatson project LIENVOY assumed coverage of this target. In early
January 1962 LIFEAT undertook coverage of the home phones of three of the
most active Soviet Intelligence officers. This was in response to the con-
tinuing Station Cl program which includes the monitoring of Sov let contacts,
and the guidance received from KUDESK Staff at the time of the last LIFEAT
renewal, As of this date, this coverage has not been active for sufficient
time to fully evaluate its usefulness. However, It is believed that such
coverage has the potential to add materially to the Station's effort in the Cl
field. Although not designed to provide positive intelligence, some by-product
of this type has been obtained, Samples are as follows:
HMM-6364, 8 May 1962 (Briefing of Mexican Pro-Marxist Journalist
by Soviet Embassy)
HMM-6382, 15 May 1962 (Mexican Traveller to the USSR)
HMM-6376, 11 May 1962 (Refutation of Rumors that Soviet Cosmonaut
TITOV will visit Mexico)
B. Polish Embassy
LIFEAT has remained the primary source of information on this target and the
only successful, continuing penetration of the target. The information provided
to the Interested Case Officer has in the past been described as "unique" and
"invaluable". This description holds with equal emphasis for the present as
well as the past. Selective examples of the valuable positive intelligence pro-
duct of this coverage are:

ΗΜΜΑ-17647, (LIFEAT/LAURICLE), 25 August 1961-

C. Cuban Coverage
LIFEAT was able to provide coverage of major firms dealing in U.S. goods
transshipment via Mexico to Cuba. This technical operation not only pro-
vided initial leads witch alerted the Station to these companies, but also
was able to provide continuing Information on the daily activities of the com-
pantes Involved. Coverage of certain Cuban personages arranging for illegal
transshipment of U.S. goods to Cuba was also provided including their con-
tacts and general activities. Samples of the positive intelligence production
from this Cuban commercial coverage are as follows:
ΗΜΜΑ-18073, 31 October 1961 (Ruben SAUREZ Y Alvarez,
Representative in Mexico of the Cuban Bank of Foreign
Commerce)

HMM-6220, 27 February 1962 (Lorenzo L. SAUNDERS, Vice President
of Transcontinental, S.A.)
D. American Communists in Mexico
:
:
As in the past, most of the targets in this group have been covered at the
'request of ODENVY, and the raw take has been partially processed by them.
During the period July 1961 through May 1962, approximately 680 reels of
take were passed to local ODENVY for their processing. The most valuable
information gleaned from the targets in this field continues to deal with con-
tacts, travel, and general activities of the American Communist Group in
Mexico (ACGM).

Typical examples of the reporting based on LIFEAT coverage of the ACGM
are:

ΗΜΜΑ-18827, 10 April 1962 (Albert MALTZ/Noah SEBORER/

E. Exile and Revolutionary Activities
LIFEAT continues to provide information on the exile and revolutionary groups
active in Mexico, which information is of the greatest value to the Station and
not available from other sources. The emphasis of the LIFEAT effort in this
area has been directed toward coverage of Nicaraguan, Guatemalan, and more
recently Spanish Republican exiles. The product has been most rewarding in this
coverage. Examples of productivity in this past project year:
ΗΜΜΑ-17489, 4 August 1961 (Alejandro GALINDO)
ΗΜΜΑ-18420, 5 January 1962 (Teodora MARTEN Rodriguez)
ΗΜΜΑ-18468, 16 January 1962 (Travel of Salvadorans to Cuba)
HMM-5920, 26 September 1961 (Activities of Nicaraguan Exiles

Albornoz, President of the Council of Spanish Republic, and
Juan Simeon VIDARTE, Spanish Exile in Mexico)
HMM-6379, 11 May 1962 (Opinion of Spanish Republican Exiles on
Current Strikes in Spain)
F. Counter-Intelligence Information
By Its latest Related Mission Directive, Mexico City Station's major respon-
sibilitles continue to lie in the field of CI/CE matters. LIFEAT was able to
provide a valuable contribution in the attainment of the Station's objectives. In
this field, Coverage included that on Carlos Humberto ILLESCAS, who is
acting in a covert liaison capacity between the CP and the Soviet Embassy in
Mexico City. Besides the continuing operational support in the CI/CE field,
the following informational reporting was provided:
HM-5742, 7 July 1961 (Travel of Mexican Leftists Behind Iron
Curtain)
HMM-5836, 18 August 1961 (Activities of Mexican Student of the
University of Peoples' Friendship)
HMM-5977, 24 October 1961 (Interview of Prominent Marxist with
Polish Conselor)
HMM-6322, 20 April 1962 (Contacts between Carlos FUENTES Macias,
Mexican Communist Writer, and Polish Diplomats)

Bolivian Ambassador to Mexico)
HMM-6377, 11 May 1962 (Scholarship for Study in Warsaw to Jorge
TAMAYO, Jr., Mexican Marxist Intellectual)
G. Operational Support and Leads Provided other Station Operations
During the past project year LIFEAT continued actively supporting Mexico City
Station through production of leads unobtainable through other assets and gen-
erally providing other Station operations the secure support only available
through a unilateral telephone tap operation. The following is a selected list,
together with a brief description, of major contributions of operational support
and leads provided through LIFEAT:

(Audio Operation)
1. FI/INT files contain 37 positive information
disseminations attributed wholly or in part to Project LIFEAT
during the year 1 July 1961 through June 1962. They were concerned
principally with contacte between Maxican Communists or leftists
and Cubans or individuals of the Soviet Eloc, and with the travel
of Latin Americans to the Soviet Bloc and Cuba. Six reports of
particular interest consisted of information on Transcontinental S.A.,
a company allegedly engaged in the illegal transshipment of US goods
to Cuba. Other reports of significance dealt with the contacts and
activities of former Guatemalan President Juan Jose AREVALO Barmeja,
now living in Mexico. There was reporting on Kicaraguan and Spanish
exile activity in Mexico and on the revolutionary sentiment and
expectations of other Latin American nationals.
2. LIFEAT has provided positive intelligence of value and of
relevance to customer requirements and to objectives of the PNIO.
It has been pointed out in the renewal request that the production
of positive information is incidental to the projects primary function
as a support and CI/CE operation.

LIFEAT Project Renewal Request
1. It is requested that the attached LIFEAT Renewal Request
be approved for the period of 1 July 1962 through 30 June 1963 in
the amount of $99,000.00, all of which falls within FY 1963.
$99,000.00 was programmed for FY 1963 in the WHD allocation.
2. This Project provides the Mexico City Station with a
unilateral telephone tap operation which has been in existence
for the past 11 years.
3. While the primary object of this Project is not the pro-
duction of positive intelligence, it was in whole or in part the
source of 30 positive information disseminations. In addition to
thio production and support of other Station operations, it
provides ODENVY with information concerning the American Commu-
nist Group in Mexico.
4. Emergency recontact instructions have not been estab-
lished for the agents of this Project since it is believed the
operation would cease in case a situation should arise where they
would be applicable.
5. No training programs for any LIFEAT personnel are
anticipated during the renewal period.
6. W Division recommenda renewal of the LIFEAT Project
based on the attached field request. WH Division has cut the
