DRAFT BRIEFING NOTES

18 February 1963

FUNDING

I. Cuban financing of subversive operations in Latin

America is easy to ascertain and hard-to document.

Our evidence shows that it is generally effected

by couriers carrying cash.

A. A Venezuelan politician, Fabricio Ojeda, re-

turned from Cuba in March of 1962, and was seen

by several witnesses to have large quantities

of Us currency stuffed in a false-bottomed com-

partment of his suitcase:

There is no law

against bringing currency into Venezuela, so

that authorities

could not even determine how

much he had brought in. Ojeda later was cap-

tured, tried, and sentenced for guerrilla ac-

tivity.

B. A Nicaraguan exile, Julio Cesar Mayorga Porto=

carrera, was flying from Mexico to Honduras in

September, 1961, when weather forced the plane

to overfly Honduras and land in Nicaragua. He

was found to be carrying $3,600 in cash from

Cuba for Nicaraguan rebels in Honduras.

C. Last March Ecuadorean troops raided a guerrilla

training camp in the mountains west of Quito and

arrested some 48 members of the URJE (Union of

Revolutionary Ecuadorean Youth) The leaders, of

the group admitted having received guerrilla

training in Cuba, but there was no other evidence

at the time of any Cuban involvement.

The URJE;

however, was a Communist-front group whose leaders

had thrown off the discipline of the regular Con-

munist party, and this January the Communists man-

aged to have a URJE convention, run by Young Con.

munists, expel the leaders.

They were

accused,

according to published accounts, of having wasted

$44,000 supplied by Cuba for guerrilla activities.

One of our reliable sources in the Communist Party

((a regional Communist leader in contact with the

Cuban chargé in Chile, and a member of the PCE

inquiry commission)) has informed us that the

next-to-last Cuban chargé in Quito blamed the

fiasco on the fact that his successor had passed

the money to the URJE without coordinating with

the regular Communist party.

D. A highly placed Guatemalan Communist who defected

last November has given us a specific account of

procedures by which Cuba sent cash to Mexico to

buy weapons which were then smuggled into Guate-

mala.

We also have considerable evidence of involved

bank transfers by which Cuban money eventually

reaches latin American front groups to pay for

political and propaganda activity. In some

countries where the Cubans still have diplonatic

missions, we have obtained photostats showing

that Cuban diplomats paid for printing of front-

group propaganda

Just last month, one of the first Brazilians to

receive guerrilla warfare training in 1961 was

picked up with a suitcase full of ammunition he

was carrying to some of those same guerrilla

training camps exposed when the Varig plane

crashed in Peru. Interestingly enough, the

Brazilians believe that the money Cuba had beep

providing for the camps actually came from Com-

munist China:

Since the exposure of the Varig

documents--and probably since the guerrillas

first reached the Cuban embassy in Rio with

their complaints about mismanagement, confusion,

and corruption--the Cubans have apparently

stopped financing this operation; but the evidence

shows it is still limping along. The man with

the suitcase full of ammunition said that a woman

attorney in Rio had given him the money to buy a

large hacienda as a new guerrilla camp. We know

that this woman is a cut-out in the communica-

tions between the pro-Communist Peasant Leagues,

which have run the camps, and the Cuban embassy.

II. The principle that guerrillas must be self-sustain-

ing has obviously been applied to finances as well.

Connunists have staged waves of bank robberies in

Venezuela, Peru, and Argentina,

•A ..

The most spectacular hold-up was that of a bank

in a Lina suburb last year which netted alnost

$100,000. Some of the participants have been

caught and are being tried in the mass trials

of more than 200 Communists just starting in

Peru. We know that the hold-up was carried out

by a combination of guerrillas and ordinary

criminals, who divided the loot fifty-fifty.

Some of the share of the common criminals has

been recovered, but the Communist half is be-

lieved to have reached the sizeable guerrilla

forces of Hugo Blanco in the Cuzco Valley.

B.

Just last week a bank in an outlying Venezuelan

töwn was robbed of $25,000 by men wearing FALN

armbands

C:

Argentine police last July raided a Buenos Aires

warehouse and found evidence that it had been

the headquarters for a gang of terrorists--ap-

parently working with both the Peronists and the

Communists--responsible for a wave of hold-ups,

to obtain funds, weapons, and explosives.
