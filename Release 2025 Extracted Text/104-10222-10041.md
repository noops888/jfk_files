Ben -

: Stan Archenhold, x 7264, one of the Agency's drug coordinators

with DEA, called me yesterday afternoon. DEA had requested a memo

verifying employment of Mr. Lucien E. Conein, whose name has

appeared frequently during the Watergate hearings. The attached

memorandum is what Archenhold wants.

Conein's service wag verified with ROB; his ''honorable service"

was cleared with SAS. Since he was under cover as contract, I dis-

cussed the cace with Dick Biladeau of Central Cover. CCS had

pened up Conein last year and Biladean approved relcase of th

nformation to DEA. We had verified this service to a Justice Depart.

ment investigator approximately one year ago when Conein was being

Archenhold offered to carry the memorandum to DEA.

GENCE ACTIVITIES IN VIFTNAM SINCE 1945.

IN ADUITION,

HAS JUDGED. THAT HIS BEST UTILIZATION HAS BEEN AS À REPRESENTATIVE

IT WOULD BE BOTH IMPOSSIBLE AND COUNTER-PROSUCTIVE IN

SCHWICKRATH'S CASE TO ATTEMPT TO MICE COMPLETELY HIS AFFILIATION

WITH KUBARK.

DURING HIS CURRENT TOUR, SCHWICKRATHi HAS ACQUIRED IN-

CREASING SKILL AND FAMILIARITY IN THE INTRICACIES OF KUBARK STAFF

WORK, BOTH AT THE. INTER-STATION LEVEL AND THE INTGU-MISSION LEVEL.

IS A NEW CAPACITY FOR SCHWICKRATH WHO HAS MERETOFORE BEEN

KNOWN AS A VERY AGGRESSIVE ACTION OFFICER.

SCHWICKRATH HAS PER-

FORMED THESE NEW DUTIES WITH CONSIDERABLE FINESSE DESPITE A VERY

RAPID BUILDUP OF PARAMILITARY ASSETS WITHIN VIETNAM AND AN EXTREMELY

FLUID COMMAND RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMMANDER OF THE U.S. MILITARY

ISSISTANCE COMMANO, VIETNAM.

IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT SCHWICKRATH

NAS THE ONLY STATION REPRESENTATIVE IN A RECENT CONFERENCE CONVOKED

BY CINCPAC IN ¡LAWAII TO RECOMMEND PROCEDURES FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF

A TEN MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT INVOLVING A YEAR-LONG TURNOVER OF

CIVILIAN IRREGULAR ASSETS IN VIETNAM FROM THE STATION TO MACV.

SCHWICKRATH'S PERFORMANCE AT THAT CONFERENCE RESULTED IN THE CON-

FERENCE'S ADOPTING ALL STJIVON RECOMMENDATIONS IN RESPECT TO ITS

FUTURE ROLE IN CIVILIAN IRREGULAR ACTIVITIES.

THE SAME TIME

SCHWICKRATH'S PERFORMANCE WAS SUCH AS TO MAINTAIN CLOSE, HARMONIOUS

RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN KUBARK, CINCPAC AND MACV..

I HAVE PERSONALLY FOUND SCHWICKRATH TO BE AN INVALUABLE

OUR STAFF WITH AN INDISPENSABLE DEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE AND

BACKGROUND ON SOUTH VIETNAM AND ON ALL MATTERS PERTAINING TO

GUERRILLA WARFARE.

IT IS A DISTINCT PLEASURE TO HAVE HIM WORKING

HERE AS A MEMBER OF THE STATION.

Employment of Lou Conein.

1. At my request, General Lanadale has quietly checked

on the status of Lou Conoin's retirement from the Army, Me la

presently in Iran and is alated for return hime and retirement in

• August. He has made an effort to return sooner but the Iranian.

Government protestud that it would be an act of bad faith (apparently,

he is doing a good job with them).

2. At the moment, Conein belongs to ACSI and Linadalo

fools that any move on our part to accelerate his return would be

misinterpreted, or perhaps I should say correctly interpreted,

by ACSI. I ain getting his addross and will establish contact with

him by personal letter.

Lansdale feels that Conein is very anxious

to come back to work for the Agency,
