Source DE LOS HEROS is the husband of BERTA

BARRETO,

340 East 80th St., NYC, who has in the past

acted as

a Cuban contact of attorney JAMES DONOVAN in

his negotiations for the release of various Cuban

prisoners.

DE LOS HEROS advised that in April, 1963,

one DAN CHAPPEL was released from a Cuban prison.

CHAPPEL is reputed to be a cattle breeder in the

Miami,

Florida area and was alleged to be a politician in

some way in that area. In 1960 and 1961, CHAPPEL was

engaged in gambling enterprises in Cuba and reportedly

a great deal of money in this venture, which

money had been given to him for use in the

gambling

venture in Cuba by an unknown syndicate of individuals

in the United States.

CHAPPEL is the only individual

that DE LOS HEROS felt might fit the description

of the American citizen formerly in a Cuban prison

who was financing raids on Cuba and who was a friend

of the subject.

NY sources familiar with anti-CASTRO

activity in the NY area, although advising that the

subject was unknown to them, stated that from time

to time they would make appropriate discreet inquiries

through other sources of theirs in the anti-CASTRO field

in the United

States in order to determine the subject's

identity and that if any information of value along

these lines is developed, they will immediately notify

the NYO.

A review of the files of the NYO reflects

no information identifiable with the subject; however,

it was noted in NY file 105-55031-164 that a letterhead

memorandum datea 3/25/63, at Miami, Florida, captione

"HAITIAN REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES; IS-HAITI"

â€¢ on pages

3, 6 and 7, contain information relative to one ALBERTO

BAYO, aka Captain Bayo, who was formerly connected

with Alpha 66 and whose identity inreality is EDUARDO..

PEREZ, residing 351 Southwest 6th St., Apartment 2,

Miami, Florida.

on page 13 of this letterhead memorandum

PEREZ is described as a Cuban exile who was very

talkative, unpredictable and undependable.
