Warren Commission Report: Article on the Investigation Conducted by

District Attorney Garrison

ACTION REQUIRED • REFERENCES

We are forwarding herewith a reprint of the article '"A Reporter At Large:

Garrison"

• published in THE NEW YORKER, 13 July, 1968.

It was written by

Edward Jay Epstein, himself author of a book, ("Inquest"), critical of the

Warren Commission Report.

2. The wide-spread campaign of adverse criticism of the U.S., most recently

again provoked by the assassination of Senator Robert Kennedy, appears to have

revived foreign interest in the assassination of his brother, the late President

Kennedy, too.

The forthcoming trial of Sirhan, accused of the murder of Senator

Kennedy, can be expected to cause a new wave of criticism and suspicion against

the united states, claiming once more the existence of a sinister "political

murder conspiracy"

• We are sending you the attached article--based either on

first-hand observation by the author or on other, identified sources--since it

deals with the continuing investigation, conducted by District Attorney Garrison

of New Orleans, In. That investigation tends to keep alive speculations about the

death of President Kennedy, an alleged "conspiracy", and about the possible

Involvement of Federal agencies, notably the FBI and CIA.

3. The article is not meant for reprinting in any media. It is forwarded

primarily for your information and for the information of all Station personnel

concerned. If the Garrison investigation should be cited in your area in the

context of renewed anti-U.s. attacks, you may use the article to brief interested.

contacts, especially government and other political leaders, and to demonstrate to

assets (which you may assign to counter such attacks) that there is no hard

evidence of any such conspiracy. In this context, assets may have to explain to

their audiences certain basic facts about the U.S. Judicial system, Its separation

of state and federal courts and the fact that judges and district attorneys in the

in office as long as his constituents re-elect him. Even if your assets have to

discuss this in order to refute-or at least weaken--anti-U.s. propaganda of

sufficiently serious impact, any personal attacks upon Garrison (or any other public

personality in the U.S.) must be strictly avoided.
