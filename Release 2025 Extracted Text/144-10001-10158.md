indicated, I take the liberty of informing you below in detail, of

the charges which have been brought against Counselor JAIME CALDEVILLA,

proved in an authentic and irrefutable manner, and which compel

us to formally and expressly request his immediate departure from

the country persona non grata.

of ideological diversionism and the recruitment of agents and

counterrevolutionaries for the Central Intelligence Agency, tasks

in which he has availed himself of the very close collaboration of

his secretary, Miss CARMEN_JTMENEZ GOMEZ((A) .

"Since February 1959, Counselor CALDEVILLA has undertaken the

job of recruiting members of the then Rebel Army, among them the

traitor ALDO VERA((A)), MARIO MARRERO((A)), and AGUSTIN RARRADA((A)).

The latter, once his activities were discovered, found it propitious

to flee the country to avoid prosecution.

"Along this same line, he also used the aforementioned Miss

CARMEN JIMENEZ GOMEZ, instructing her to infiltrate student

organizations for the purpose of creating diversionism in the

Ideological order, and she established, for this purpose, intimate

relations with Mr. PEDRO LUIS BOITELL (A)): ex-President of the

arrested and sentenced to imprisonment on the Isle of Pines,

Miss JIMENEZ GOMEZ went there and carried out military and political

espionage activities. The data and information that she obtained

on that occasion were transmitted to Counselor JAIME CALDEVILLA,

and included microfilms.

"In February 1960 Counselor CALDEVILLA conceived a plan for

an attempt against the life of the then First Deputy Chairman of

the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Mr. ANASTAS MIKOYAN,,

a guest in Cuba, for which purpose he delivered arms to a group

of counterrevolutionarly elements. It was not executed, according

to what Counselor CALDEVILLA himself claims, because of

the

cowardice of the assassins. He also sought refuge and protection in

the home of his collaborator JOSE LUIS RODRIGUEZ ((A)), for MI. ISRAEL

TAMORA PEREZ ((A)), a fugitive from Cuban authorities

for plotting

an attempt against the life of the Vice Prime Minister and Minister

of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces, Conmander RAUL CASTRO RUZ,

as well as a plan to create an incident at the United States Naval

Base at Guantanamo. Later, Counselor CALDEVILLA arranged for the

mentioned ISRAEL ZAMORA PEREZ to take asylum in the Colombian

Embassy in Havana.

"In May 1962 he instructed his agents

CARMEN

JIMENEZ GARCIA

and ALFREDO SERRA ECHEVARRIA((A)), an accountant at the Embassy,

well as other individuals, to infiltrate different organizations

and offices of the Cuban State. The former went to work in the

offices of the National College of Architects, where she established

contacts with numerous professionals to induce them to desert, as

well as to obtain data and intormation from the Congress of the

International Union of Architects, where she worked as a simultaneous

interpreter.

"The latter worked at the National Institute of Agrarian Reform

where, if a break in diplomatic relations between Spain and Cuba

occurred, he would be in charge of obtaining confidential information

for the counterrevolutionary organization, the Revolutionary

Student Directorate with which he maintained close relations

through BLANCA MARTINEZ DEL HOYO((A)), JORGE MEDINA BRINGUIER ((A)),

and LUIS FERNANDEZ ROCHA((A)). The first two were national coordinators

for civic resistance and strengthening of the Revolutionary Student

Directorate, and the latter, a CIA agent.

"It has also been proved that Counselor CALDEVILLA's wife,

at his suggestion, has maintained relations with relatives of

political prisoners and counterrevolutionaries, inciting them to

send letters of protest to foreign embassies and international

organizations.

to recruit him and give him training in arms and explosives, even

within the Spanish Embassy, and instruct him in organizing an

espionage network for the illicit procurement of military, economic

and political information and in penetrating the Cuban-Spanish

Friendship Society, whose building he was to occupy in the event

the United States Government launched an armed aggression against

Cuba. He was to be given arms and equipment at the opportune

moment. In like manner FOLGUEIRAS was instructed by the former

to distribute arms and relay guidance to counterrevolutionary

groups in the event of this aggression. The espionage ring organized

by the aforementioned is made up of eight persons who receive for said

task the amount of 250.00 US dollars monthly and the promise of

a deposit of 500.00 Us dollars in an account in their names in a

Miami bank.

Counselor CALDEVILLA. In June of the same year, photostatic copies

pouches and enciphered Embassy cables to receive and transmit

instructions, reports, requests for information, and correspondence

related to illicit activities and is personally

in charge of

deciphering messages in an office on the second floor of the chancery,

Both were exposed by leaders of counterrevolutionary organizations,

having offered, on one occasion, to supply to one group rifles

with telescopic sights.

The authorities have proof that one or

the other maintains relations with the well-known counterrevolutionary

leader MANUEL ARTIME, whom Mi. VERGARA visited in Miami sometime

before the mercenary invasion was crushed at Playa Giron, in

April 1961, with the knowledge of Counselor JAIME CALDEVILLA.

•"It has been known that Counselor JAIME CALDEVILLA has been

dedicated, furthermore, for some time, to the illegal removal from

the country through the diplomatic pouches of the Spanish Embassy

of jewels and foreign currency delivered to him by different persons,
