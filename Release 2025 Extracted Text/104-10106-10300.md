APPROVAL

- 190d

NOSENKO, Yurily Ivanovich, a Soviet

KGB officer who defected in 1964 and

was subsequently involuntarily con-

fined in the U.S. by the Agency for

a period of approximately three

years.

NOSENKO first contacted Agency per-

sonnel in Switzerland in June 1962

and subsequently defected in January

1964. NOSENKO was brought to the U.s.

and after a period of relative freedom

he was involuntarily confined in

April 1964.

From April 1964 to

August 1965, he was confined at an

Agency controlled site in Clinton,

Maryland.

From August 1965 to

October 1967 NOSENKO was confined

at Camp Pearyff Virginia. In October

1967, he was returned to the Washington

area, given increasing amounts of

freedom until he was given total free-

dom in April 1969.

NOSENKO became a

U.S. citizen in April 1974. NOSENKO

was employed by the Agency as a

consultant in March 1969 and continues

under contract to date. His present

salary is $23,500 per year.

(1) The legal basis to confine NOSENKO

against his will was discussed by

Mr. Richard Helms, DD/P, and others with

the Deputy Attorney General on 2 April

1964 (Tab 1). On 3 April 1964, the

Agency General Counsel, Mr. Lawrence

горе сta6 2, .

Houston, advised the Director of Security

by memorandum that such confinement was

(2) There are a series of letters from

the DDCI, DCI and others to various

agencies, including the Department of

Justice

covering

awareness of these agencies of the

NOSENKO affair (Tab 3).

(3) The conditions of NOSENKO's confine-

ment were established by the Office of

Security (Tabs 4 & 5).

RESULTS

TERMINATION

COMMENTS

:

By memorandum dated 2 October 1968,

the Director of Security forwarded

two reports to the DDCl summarizing.

the results of the NOSENKO case to

that date.

The reports are voluminous.

One was prepared by the Office of

Security and the other by the FBl.

Both reports conclude that NOSENKO

was a bona fide defector.

A draft

memorandum attached to this file,

dated 21 October 1968 and prepared

by the Cl Staff,

raises question

regarding NOSENKO's bona fides

and challenges the above two reports.

NOSENKO continues under contract to

the Agency: He is brought to Washington,

periodically to consult on matters

germane to his background and experience.

Various reports are available in the

files of the Office of Security which

detail financial aspects of this case.

No final accounting has been made since

the project continues.

(1) While the Office of Security files

do document the rationale for the original

confinement of NOSENKO, they do not

document the rationale

for his continued

confinement over so long a period of time.

A memorandum dated 5 August 1969 states

that various congressional staff officers

were briefed on NOSENKO and states that

concern for his safety, as well as con-

cern regarding his bona tides, prompted

the prolonged confinement. (See Tab 6)

(2) Office of Security files document

a period in 1969 during which a mail

cover was placed on NOSENKO.

(3) During the above period, NOSENKO

was allowed

a pleasure trip

to Florida.

During this trip, Agency personnel, with

apparent Headquarters approval, obtained

the services of prostitutes.

apparently occurred on at least two

occasions.

NEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

SUSJECT:

Discussion with deputy Attorney.

General on Nosento Case ..

Mr Helas, Nr. Houston and Mr. Nurphy net with

the Daputy Attorney General and neabers of his staff to

discuss subjoct case. Present fros Mr. Katzenbach's-

Z. MT. Helas axplained the Mosenko case briefly

and indicated that shortly ve would be faced with what

we at least considerad to be two problens on which ve

would like the advice of the Department of Justice.

First, He would seoon feol compelled to begin hostile

interrogation of losenko in odor to arrivo at the truch

with respect to his aission for the KGB and we wondered

what the legal position would be in circuastances in

which ve datained Nosenko against his will for this pui-

pose.. Second, He would have to be ready after deterin-

ing: that we could obtgia no additional infomation iron

Nosenko to deport hin. Me had thought of taking his to

Gormany and transferring his to Soviat custody in Borlin

whero this has been done a nunder of times in the past.

There was sons discussion of whether deportation.

to another country might be a consideration. Mt. Helms

explained to would probably. face publicity problens in

deporting to a third country of the kind we would

counter if ho vero fros in the U. S. Nr. lelas noted

there were many itens of information which we and the

FBI toaliza are of no significance because of the file

holdings:ne have but which an unscrupulous norspaper dau

could use to creato sischiei.

This aspect was then dropped

and it was the consensus that

Berlin was probably the best

place.

The quostion of the basis for datention was agzin

raised and related by HI. foloy to the conditions under

which Nosenko is in this country. He is hore as an "or-

clusion and parole case" which neans he has not been

acnitted and

has been parolod to the Agency shich is

responsiblo for bia while ho is in this country. This

parolo can bo interpreted to mean parole to a spacific

MEMORANDUM FOR:

Director of Security

SUBJECT:

Parole Status of Defectors

1. On 2 April 1964 we had a discussion with the Department

of Justice on the status of aliens whose inspection by I&NS is deferred

upon arrival at our request and who are then paroled to this Agency. :

It was the position of the Department of Justice that we were responsibla

for taking any action necessary to carry out the terms of the parole.

• 2. As you know, a basic parole agreement was executed by the

Attorney General and the DCI on 10 February 1955. After setting up

conditions for authorizing parole in any one case, the agreement states:

"After parole of such aliens, the Central Intelligence Agençy will assume

responsibility for care, supervision and control of a kind and degree it

believes consistent with the internal security needs of the United States

during continuance of their parole status." This means that tine

responsible Agency officials must take the minimum action necessary

. to protect the internal security needs of the United States. The word

"'minimum" is not necessarily a limitation. It merely means that good

judgment must be used as to what kind and degree of action is necessary.

3. The agreement further provides that upon completion of the

parolee's intelligence or operational purposes in the United States or if

internal security reasons so require, the alien will be removed from

this country through arrangements made by the Agency and, in such

case, the Agency will inform the Service in advance of each proposed

departure,

be required to count the silverware in and out; that.

the silverware be placed on the tray in a manner

where it could be observed before the guards enter

the room, etc.).

(5) Subject is to receive one cigarette on 12 May 1964.

LINOTE These changes with regard to the bath, haircut,

cigarette are not to be considered as something to be

done on regular schedule. We will await specific

instructions from SR Division as to when these items

are to be accomplished in the future.)

(7).

Subject only on Tuesday each week.

radation to the above, it mast be emphasized that

our attitude toward the Subject will remain precisely

the same.

and our security procedures, including

searches, will continue to be at maximum control:

It was further ascertained that we will have custody of

the Subject until at least July. It was suggested that perhaps we may

wish to explore some modifications in the assignment of personnel

or schedule of assignments. In addition, the Acting Chief, Support

Branch has suggested that immediate consideration be given to

devising necessary procedures to be followed in the event of an

emergency involving loss of control of the Subject.

This should

be discussed immediately with the responsible DFO supervisors

and specific procedures devised, and all guards properly informed

as to-their responsibilities in this matter.
