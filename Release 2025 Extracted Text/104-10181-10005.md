MICROFILM

1.:

On 16 January 1969 QUTIMID reported a discussion

between

Subiect and-the-Chief.of the Rumanian Trade. delegation

in Spain, during which the rumanian asked when they could meet:

Subject invited the Rumanian to his home where, he said,

has set up a small office and was beginning to work more at

home than in the office, because of

the added comfort.

wouldn't be surprised if this was suggested by his wife-who

is very jealous of her husband.)

The meeting was arranged

for 1130 hors on 17 January.

AMAUTO-1 commented that he is

up quite early in the morning, presumably to begin work in

his office.:

2.

The above report is the first we have received on

Subject's

use of his

home as an office.

invitation

the Rumanian, of course, casts suspicion on the nature of the

conversation.

3.

Since his move to new quarters, AMAUTO-l's home is

about 50 yards from two WOFIRM staffers - Martin B. CRYMM and

Conrad B. FALAGIARO.

(See attached sketch) ..

Edwin B. RATTEREE

lives approximately 200 yards from the AMAUTO hume.

This

proximity to AMAUTO-l'S home by three staffers brings up the

question of the use of an RF device to monitor conversations.

in ANAUTO's office at home, assuming at this time, that he.

has a phone

in the office,

most likely an extension of the

home. phone:

For planning purposes, we would appreciate from.

NIKNOVA a list of requirements for a target study in the use:

of an

RF

device.

If other means are available for external

penetration of his home we would welcome your suggestions

and comments.

Please

advise us also if the PF device is still

a controlled

item, which cannot be discussed with or released

toliaison. Your earliest reply would be appreciated.

M00r0-1 Discussion of Missiles

•On 10 January 1968, AILUTO-1, in one of his many daily

discussions. with his subordinates, refireted on the international

pusition of his country,

and arong the things he said,

the folloring which may

be of possible interest to audrissces.!

Although part of the discussion was not hürd because of the

inflcction of the speaker, we feel that the jist of

the discussion is clear and understandable.

"We are denonstrating to the wild that cuba..•1s

cavorably disposed to do whatever... (AMAUTO-l begins

to talk against the United States) that when the

Americans have to raise the white flay..: because the

sir'st plane that appears on rdar. Alurol is

speaking excitedly and itis vory

difficult to miderstand

wnch.word but it appears that he is talking about the

positions of missiles in Cuba), Havana, Las Villas and

Camagucy. and that with these nissiles,

the Americans say they are going tu

sia ton coat on anosa, we will one then to

they (Americans) say they are going to invade us, the

first plane that concs to invade.. (AlAViO-l's sub-

ordinate remarked that 15 October

62 marked a point

in international politics, when the Yankees ordered

the Soviets to withdraw their missiles).

• (AMLIUTO-1

injected) "they (the Sovicts) prescuted

them" (the

Cubans) with ten bombs".

2.

Our reason for reporting this fragmentary information is

that AMAUTO-1 might be contirming the presence of offensive nis

siles in Cuba.

On Yonday, 4 December 1967, the day after his arrival,

RUIZ ordered tho Cuban conguls in Barcelona, seville ano

The order was couched in terms

of "wanting to scot" them, but after their arrival on

Hednesday, 6. December, all parties settled down to a detailed

meetlög in which primary attention was given to administrative

matters, trade and propaganda.

The lattes two subjects will

be dealt with in separate dispatches:

On the administrative

concluded by asking

for a monthly report on receipts and

expenses and a report on the consuls' current needs, thelr

that kept recurring throughout the discussions.

4. By the end of the week, RUIZ had prepared a report

on the situation he found in the Chancerry and the mission

He started by assuring

that he had

"found great cooperation among all the

Enough exiles have responded to this pressure to

During that time, the QUDOZE/QUTIMID

and outlook

than the other members of the local Cuban mission.

the political and cultural fields.

He"later commented

on thie: tact that Cuba is practically unknown. in Spain,

tand Cubal products are never seen in the local stoics

and that the viewlof Cuba of the average Spanlard has

lie has .continued to discuss the

need for advertising

Cuban products and considered

decorating his office and his home with Cuban items and

furnitüre

so he could show a little bit of Cuba to his

Spanish and forcign contacts.

Another conscquence of

this desire to put Cuba's best foot forward is a certain

harshness in dealing with the shortcomings of his

colleagues

and fellow Cubans outside the mission, calling

in a QUDOZE report of 13 July he was complaining that the

•Cubans seem to have lost:the elegant touch in their

public functions.

3.: RUIZ's attitude toward money follows logically

from his

desire. that Cuba's prestige increase and he is

quite willing to spend money where it will show.

The

Embassy's 6 January reception was an expensive affair,

the Embassy-and .Commercial officers take their Spanish

contacts to the best restaurants,

he and his wife pay

30,000 pesotas (approximately $ 130.00) rent per month

for a house deemed suitable to his position and buy new

clothes without hesitation for the various diplomatic

functions.

Before he went on home leave on 6 August 1968,

he was encouraging his stafi to rent better apartments

that would more nearly match their status as diplomats

and his wifo was looking for a different house for them,

one with fewer maintenance headaches and with rooms large

enough for small receptions of as many as 10 people.

/ All of this

is quite in accord with RUIZ's own bourgoisa

tastes, reflected more than any thing else in his great

Interest in

clothes and in being well dressed. Yet the

Cuban mission operates on a

slim budget and the salaries

are not high.

Station Madrid has no information on

whether Cuban mission personnel reccive a housing

allowince but assumes they

must as otherwise RUIZ, at

RUIZ earns a gross

salary of $681.50 per month and all his living expenses

including clothes, food, medical expenses, education for

the couple's 5 children and perhaps utilities must come

from this sum.

RUIZ also expects to be able' to invite

cuban officials transiting Madrid and his Spanish and

foreign contacts home for lunch or dinner at any time.

There

is no

indication that he receives a representation

allowance yet he will allow his wife to charge nothing

except

the salaries of two maids to the Embassy and she

can't economize on food when they are alone because he

will go out to a restaurant rather than eat rice and beans.

RUIZ is plainly cautious in his dealings with Havana over

money. even while wanting to live as well as possible

in Madrid. The difference in the couple's manner of

living between Havana

and Madrid must be striking since

RUIZ had i good position in the Ministry of Foreign Commerce

prior to becoming Charge d'Affaires and yet his wife told

vera, the Embassy secretary and her closest friend,

that

she did not have a refrigerator in Cuba and would like

to take one back

with her if they did not return to Madrid

after home leave!

RUIZ's political idens are contered in the Cuban

unquestioned regime supporter.

However: his approach

is different from that of

the younger,

less. intelligent

men who have known nothing else.

RUIZ has had a

sufficient breadth of education and experience to make

a choice, to have reached his own decision that the

Castro regime is good for Cuba and that Marxism as

interpreted by the Cubans

foundation for life.

in spite of having

a mark of Narxist principles it has many variations

These variations are unknown

In a QUDOZE

Report of 23 June,

he commented on certain features of

the Cuban system

as "very difficult to understand unless

one is of the left"!.

The QUDOZE Report of 4 July quoted

extensively

in OSMA-24,112 of 9 August 1968 showed

most

clearly RUIZ's view of Cuba and the revolution as

one entity and to see himself within that structue, a

part of it and serving it.

Bejond that, his mind runs

in business and public relations rather than political

channels and he has shown less interest in the policies

At the time the referenced dispatch was prepared,

the QUDOZE Reports were showing the beginning of a full

fledged fight between Guillermo RUIZ Perez, the Charge

d'Affaires of the Cuban Embassy in Madrid and his first

Secretary, Hector GALLO Portieles.

As so often happens in

human relations, less important issues proved the vehicle

for expressing

deeper conflicts and problems.

the primary problem can be simply summarized.

members of RUIZ's staff operate Independently of their

chief and he feels he is neither congulted nor informed by

his subordirates

This is particularly

true in relation

to GALLO.

The specific issues which

sparked their quarrels were RUIZ's dispute with Emilio

ROMERO, editor

of the newspaper Pichlo, and the distribution

subordinates should back him by taking the

same positions

in public that he takes, a not unreasonable demand

the part of a Chiel of Mission.

RUIZ bluntly

told GALLO

that he, GAlLO, had commilted an error and GALLo just as

bluntls. disagroed. GALLO'S vicH way that RUIZ had come in

in a bad humor and rothing pleased hin whercas Ruiz felt

GALLo should try putting himselt do RUIZ's place, sonething

he: claims GALLO Is incapable of doing.

Finally,

particular argument ended in a form of compromise with

GALLO agreeing to call ROMERO the following day and remind

him that he "should call the Minister".

3...

On 4 July the battle was renewed over

the

distribution of Che's Diary.

At that time the Embassy

only had 6 or 7 copies which were being loaned out on an

overnight basis.

RUIZ said he wanted to send the Diary

"to a mountain of people" while GALLO was also offering

-it freely and without consulting Rulz about the action or

his list of recipients.

RUIZ scolded him roundly for this

and, InorinE GALLO's attempts at self-justification ford

him he had to respect the instructions he received.

one point in his

tirade, RUIZ even went so far as to

suggest it would be better for onc of them to leave and go

to work

in another country,

for example Rumania.

Several

interesting items emerged from this long quarrel:

CALLo has some undefined problem" which Station

Madrid assumes is related to his personality and his

approach to his fellow workers.

Ruiz said,

GALLO, here everyone knows

the problem you

is necessary to be hard, because unfortunately all

the comrades, that have come here

through many years

Rutz then insisted on the

importance of discussing problems among the comrades

and said "for example in your case,

you have been

foolish in not outlining the problem.

and ESPINO was waiting and PILOTO'.

RUIZ commented that now he can understand

the attitude of CALZADILLA:

Before, de had thought

CALZADILLA was in error but now he feels the same way.

He mentions "an ambivalence" and says he will not

react the same way, "that CALZADILLA was wrong in

limiting himself ton reduced group of persons whereas

I will.continue.to/go.forward-.but with. everyone, not

just a few."

commenting on the weekly

study circle for members of the

Party, he set forth

his opinion that all the comrades of

Mission should participate even

though. they may not

be members because

in his eyes it is as if they all

really were members.

RUIZ repeated a statement he has made on

prerious occasions

- the great interest of his life

is foreign commerce.

However, in this 4 July QUOZE

RUIZ will soon be going on home leave.

However, the forner

close association noted upon RUIz's arrival is gone and

they

his subordinates

American command mad. He added that this Chinese says that

they failed the first time and can fail the

second time but

that in the end the victory will be theirs.

that Vietnam had been at war with the Chinese for thousands

of years, that the Chinese have a demonic power that is their

The nature of the QUDOZE Report does not permit

further amplification of the above information which, even

though fragmentary and obscure,

is being forwarded for

whatever use Headquarters may

wish to make of it.

any clarifying information appear in future QUbOZE reports,

it will be forwarded.

It is interesting to note that,

although Station traces do not show the information,

in North Vietnam

as a member of a trade mission.

ANAUTO-T Discussion of Missiles

1.

discussions

On 10 January 1968, ANaUT reflected on the Internattonal

with his

subordinates,

in one of his many: daily

position of his country, and among the things he said, we quote

the following which may be of possible interest to addressees.

Although part

'of the discussion

was not heard because of the

not dose done eat the sues a feel that the fist.or

the discussion is clear and understandable.

"We are demonstrating to the world that Cuba...is

favorably disposed to do whatever... (AMAUTO-1 begins

to talk against the United States) that when the

Americans have to raise the white flag.. because the

first plane that appears on radar... (AHAUTO-1 15

speaking excitedly and itis very

difficult to understand

each word but it appears that he is talking about the

positions of missiles in Cuba), Havana, Las Villas and

canaguey and that with these missiles,

we can cover

Miami, New York, and all their bases and all of their

"mierda".

•.if

the Americans say they are going to

send them (missiles? planes?), we will send

them; if

they (Americans) say they are going to invade us, the

Ill'st plane that comes to invade... (AMAUTO-l's sub-

ordinate remarked that 15 October

62 marked a point

in international politics, when the Yankees ordered

the. Soviets to withdraw

their missiles). • •(AMAUTO-1

injected) "they (the Soviets) presented

them (the

Cubans) with ten bombs".

2.

Our reason for reporting this fragmentary information is

that AMAUTO-1 might be confirming the presence of offensive nis-

siles in Cuba.

JAN 30 19631. When Guillermo RUIZ Perez, the new Cuban Charge met

with the Cuban consuls following his arrival in Spain, the

Due mc five o instate mater roar areasandavas

subject of propaganda will be dealt with in this dispatch.

2.

The Castro regime has always attached great

importance to propaganda activities of all kinds and when the

new Cuban Charge d'Affaires began to re-organize the work of

his subordinates, propaganda matters were not overlooked.

According to the QUDOZE and QUTIMID operatioN types of

provincial consulates have been receiving four

propaganda for distribution,

two of which were identified.

One was the propaganda put out by the organizations created

by the Castro regime,

for example "The Voice of Vietnam".

The other is newspapers.

PACHECO, Consul in Sevilla,

mentioned Granma,

he claimed many people read,

added that lately he had been receiving Juventude Rebelde.

RUIZ's ideas apparently go beyond hand-shaking and

the distribution of propaganda.

He asked the consuls to

make & list of all the institutes and all the scientific

centers in their territories including the special positions

of these centers and any other relevant information.

are to use these lists to develop a systematic work

of visiting each one, making friends,

trying to obtain

scholarships for Cuba, trying to obtain publications and

propaganda of every type, free if possible or by subscription

if necessary.

The consuls were told to go with the attitude

of

"looting"

4.

Even while he was lajing these responsibilities

. on his

consuls, RuIz was busy within the Embassy.

In

discussions

with. Andres

MARtinte, a Spanis. inproyce hiio

works on cultural matters. and is

responsible for publication

of the Embassy

bulletin,

RUIZ mentioned

that he is

interested

in offering Cuban documentaries to Spanish Cine

(Movie) Clubs as they now have a largè number,

"an infinity",

of documentaries showing both Cuban technical

application

and how the people live.

RUIZ also asked to see copies of

the Embassy bulletin and in the meantime suggested IRTINEZ

do a bulleiin drawing a parallel between Gibralter and

Guantanamo.

Finally, according to a QUDOZE report of

11 December 1967, Hector GALLO Portieles had been ordered

to prepare a work plan for cultural notivity.

In this

context

cultural activity is not limited to art, music and

literature but also includes public information media. The

Cuban Embassy has already built up a series of press contacts

over the past jears and

the 'Cuban Revolution seems to draw

a ready response in Spanish intellectual circles as

cvidenced by the Spanish delcgates attending the Cultural

Congress held in

Havana from 4-ll January 1968.

An expense-

paid trip is always attractive to be sure but the delegates,

many of whom

were not communists, were

also, sympathetic to

the host.

Accordingly, within the limits imposed by the

Spanish

government, Station Madrid expects an increase in

the

propaganda and political action activities of the Cuban

official establishment.

CALZADILLA, RUIZ's predecessor häd not been a strong

administrator and

had let the various components of the

Cuban official establishment in Spain run their own affairs.

This fact plus the inevitable tendency of a new chief to be

"new broom" and rearrange things according to his own

led Station Madrid to expect some changes particularly

the Embassy.

the QUDOZE and QUTINID operations

have shown RuIZ at

least initially to be an aggressive and

well organized individual with ideas of his own that clearly

reflect his background in commercial affairs and prepared to

make changes that promise to go beyond the superficial

swreping of a new broom.

Underlying RUIZ's actions and

proposals is the clear implication that he came to Madrid

with the specific task of upgrading the Cuban mission in

Spain both in terms of prestige and effectiveness.

Madrid will transmit to the addressees the relevant

information on this program as it becomes available from the

and QUTIMID operations along with information on the

official Cuban personalities administering the program.

A striking difference between RUIZ and his

predecessor was noted in the QUDOZE and QUTINID reports of

that first week.

RUIZ has no inhibitions over spending

the Enbassy cars, a Peugeot was replaced with

a new model and there was discussion of replacing the other

two Peugeots with new ones.

Nilda, RUIZ's wife, was picked

up by the wife of GOVIY who turned

shopping at the Corte Inglesa, one of Madrid's two best

Nilda declared that the apartment where CALZADiLLA and

had lived economically was inadequate and they

decided to look for a chalet, something very spacious and

well-priced.

They subsequently seriously considered one

The order. was couched in terms

printing and telephone bills were the

two items of expense

that kept recurring throughout the discussions.

By the end of the week, RUIZ had prepared a report

that he had "found great co-operation among all the

The new Ambassador concluded his report with three

recommendations:

Reit another building where. the Chancillary,

the Commercial Office,

the Consulate and the

Cubana Offices can all be housed instead

of

being dispersed in separate buildings as they

are now;

b.

Rent or preferably buy a residence for the Chief

adequate;

c.

Send another person from Cuba who has the.

background to take care of scientific work plus

continuing the contacts the Mission will have

already made.

statement on the completeness of the staff, such

RUIZ concluded his remarks by saying that in Spain
