July 11, 1970

Alexandria, Virginia

By Dennis J. O'Brien

For the John F. Kennedy Library

O'BRIEN:

I think a logical place to begin in anything

like this is just simply with the question;

when did you first meet President Kennedy,

or Senator Kennedy, if you met him before

he was

President?

LANSDALE: I don't recall meeting him before he was

I talieves

Presidento. The first meeting, was I-belteve

the first Saturday following the inauguration,

whatever date that was. I was called into a

meeting in the white House by (Robert S.

McNamara. It was a meeting, on actually, on

a report that I had written for (Dwight D.

Eisenhower® It was sort of an I'm not sure.

the personnel that were attending. There were

several Secretaries: Defense, State, and his -

National Security people were there.

tion, before they actually assumed office?

LANSDALE: Just before, that is, a day or so before. I'd

been in Vietnam for a brief visit and got back

just before the inaugural, maybe two or three

days, and at that time both McNamara and

Gilpatric were in Defense getting briefed for

their new jobs. I met them at that time.

The outgoing Deputy Secretary of Defense asked

me to start working with Gilpatric, and so I

got

Gilpatric rather than McNamarao

I gathered that there was some opposition to

my going out, and he insisted on it..

I'd like to come back to that. I wonder if

we could go on to talk about one of the major

problems, which is Cuba. When is the first

time that you hear about the Bay of Pigs

not the Bay of Pigs, but the plansto

Sometime in the fall of sixty I think that

at the time, for Special Operations and used

to accompany the Deputy Secretary, who was a

Inton, it was. Initially, it was very differ.

on a premise that many people in Cuba were very

way it was turning away from the initial

revolutionary objectives and the capture of the

revolutionary movement by the Communist Party,

which surprised many of the supporters of

Castro as a guerilla and as & revolutionary

of, Cubans who either had been supporters of

Castro or were very unhappy, were still resident

in Cuba, and to cause some overturn at the time.

borrowed some military personnel to help with

who had been attached to CIA for temporary

duty on other matters, and they hadn't come

in initially for this specific planning. In

December, when the planning had obviously

started coming in with a beach landing and so

on, the way it turned out, I urged at that

point to get military planning in on the

thing. I was worrying about it. "as a matter

of fact, Allen Dulles brought his planners

to a policy meeting, a policy group meeting,

and they were explaining the concept and my

questioning was such that Allen Dulles pleaded

He was, chairman of the JCS Joint Chiefs of

Staff at the time, and he backed up my urging

a special section to plan along with the

(Central-Intelligence) Agency on that. And who

the hell headed that?

This is yet in the

Eisenhower administration.

This is all back in 1960. This was still in

the early planning stagedo This was before

training or anything like that was put forward.

When the JCS got into the act, I asked to be

disassociated with the project. I was

critical of the concept, and it was just too

so this would be well after the candidates

had been nominated and so on. I imagine that

at the time. At least, the rest of us certainly

didn't know it. I forget exactly when I first

heard it, but it would be possibly October,

but it might have even been November. by the

time I heard about it. As I say, I heard.

about it when it was surfaced with the inner.

circle of our administration executives.

O'BRIEN:

Well, I suppose you had some conversations

with Dulles and with Bissell and some of

these people about it.

LANSDALE:

Yes.

O'BRIEN: What's their feeling?

You already discussed

O 'BRIEN:

hoid your criticism..

Well, Bissell definitely felt the same wayo

Bissell was a very hard-working, intenseperson,

almost high-strung type of individual. He

became rather impatient with my questioning

of the changed concept when it took place. I thought

fastsally, is they had the correct personnel?

and they had a correct reading of dissent

inside of Cuba, that was a fair chance to do

something. My only concera at the time was?;

did. the CIA have the Americans who could work

with such a situation? I just didn't know

yes,

of any, but I was assured that there were such

Americanso but I'm not certain that there were.

Did you question the kind of intelligence that

was coming out about Cuba and the expected

reaction of Cubans to an invasion/ and the

reaction to Castro in general?

¡ LANSDALE:

•Just in very general terms. !:I didn't have

enough concrete and specific information

myself that was separate from theirs. Most

of the intelligence take at the time, avail-

able inside the U.S. government, was pretty

colored with this dissatisfaction and state-

ments of 1t. so? I had no real way of

determining the accuracy or inaccuracy of it.

Some of the adjectives used in describing this

in briefings to us alerted me a little bit.

It Just sounded, too much, iled a sales job on

a viewpoint. I'd question that, whether that

was an accurate thing, so. this is about as far

as I went

•O'BRIEN:

How does a guy like Douglas react? Do you

recall?

LANSDALE:

Well, he approved of the plan, so he and the

others at the policy level approved of going

ahead with itland developing it. I was his

advisor on this thing? that was my stars job),

and I told him to be certain to get the JCS

to give it a real hard scrutiny and to come

up with details of whether it could succeed

or not.

That was my last advisory role with

him. I was taken off advising on the project

after that, actually by my own request because

I was apparently causing too much trouble and

-cks of progress.

the reaction of the Joint Chiefs, people

like Lemnitzer, towards this? Is there an

institutional rivalry or bureaucratic rivalry

here in their minds?

sard hussy. Later, I know, when the Jas got

11 on the actual planning of this, they became

much more serious on it because they had a

share of it.

O'BRIEN:

Well, do you get involved in the informing

of McNamara and Gilpatric about this? Do you

get any way of sensing what their reactions

are on first being informed?

lower than that and go along with ito I'm not

but they'd sure know a military landing, whether

it would succeed or not. Given some of the -

unknowns in this thing, jayde by 10 percent

they had given it a high chance of success,

in the decision making process, of making d of

policy, and asked me if I had any ideas on

how better the President could be served in

the policy decisions and arriving at them.

and I had come up with a proposal for him

which he put to. Kennedy. I just told them?

questions.

O'BRIEN:

How were his questions?

Was he fairly naive

about the problems?

government would operate at a decision level,

It was a traumatic experience at top levels throughout

such

nan

istonsefully sore subject among all of these

people. I felt that almost all of the key

executives in the administration must have

arcant about it at night of something, and

during the daytime working hours they just

didn't even want to, contemplate it. And yet

they were honest enough people that they knew

they had to face up and look at it and would do

s0, but it was an oxtremely emotional subject

with them, very much so.

Well, in terms

of the Agency, there's a number

of programs and, of course, involvements in

operations that they have. Do you see any

shift in these, any attempt on the part of the

Defense Department to move into some of these

areas which they felt were traditionally theirs

LANSDALE:

rather than the Agency. I guess what I'm

trying to say is, can you see any decline in

the asthat influence

the Agency it decisions?

Yes, I think so.

I'm not certain that it was

well

the military as such. It might have been the

t::

and

n?..: Ke McNamara personallyn

ids encouragement of some of the military who

were somewhat interested but wouldn't really

have expressed the interest unless they were

diroctly asked and there always had been some

feeling of unease. I think would bo the best

word to describe it/-among the military about

type of

any clandestine, operations. They felt that

once it got over into guerrilla type of operations

or anything that would involve a military subject,

that it would be far better to let the military

establishment of the U.S. handle it."

But that

would be sort of a dinner-coctail party type of

a gambit on their part, rather than sitting and .

planning and so on of "We must grab some of

that

this," Even though among themselves they talked

that way. They didn't express it in terms of

their attendence at policy councils or even in

## Page 21

talks with people like the secretary of Defense

os the civilian, executive side of Defense. "on

this, I think that McNamara himself probably

well,

started thinking initially that this was a

military operation and just to be more efficient

and effective, the military should take over

such things. I imagine that he talked that way

to some of the military poodle that vese seeing

him from the JOS, and the Chiefs, and from the

intelligence community, the military intelligence

community. I know that DIA [Defense Intelligence

Agencyl got its great start under McNamara, and.

I feol almost certain, I've got a strong hunch,

that the Bay of Pigs and the misreading of the

temper of the people in Cuba gave McNamara

great impetus in setting that up initially.

sort of dealing with them, of categories of

work, and where the boundary lines of who did

what on the thingo and this is where their

jealousies and emotions and everything would

come up over almost nitpicking of boundary lines

of who would do what. It wasn't a thing of

we'll do it all, and you go out of business that

looling hadn't come up but intele after the.

Bay of Pigs, the DIA and its creation, a lot of

the people in that who were civilian employees,

Defense Department employees, had an idea, "We

can do a better job than CIA," and in a much.

wider fiold than the service intelligence agencies

have done.

people who were very sensitive on my presence

abroad initially. Since I didn't just stick

in a regular military category but would get

over into their own subject matter, this made

them very uncomfortable, and I can understand

it while it happened, but it was carried to

too great an emotional length. At times I

would suggest certain individuals be sent to

look into a situation in a given

would arrange their transportation and so ono

and I would get backing throughout the U.s.

government for this thing and have an individual

approved by the secretary of State

Defense and up at the White House and so on,

a means of communicating

back so that we would get reports back. There

would be times when these individuals would

military attache very kindly picked up

this

he'd worked, and he said, "In the Pentagon)"--

he was a

that he worked for me, and the attaché got

all excited, called the ambassador, and he

was given two hours to come out of the country:

he asked me to just wait outside, and they

You

Well, did Nolting ever

try to get you back to

Vietnam, in an advisory position?.

I think so. There were a number of attempts

by the Vietnamese themselves, and unfortunately,

some of them werecouched in terms of wanting

me to come out as ambassador, by the Vietnamesed

but Nolting and I had very friendly relations,

and I think he had proposed that I come on

out several times. But these things would

recommencations come out of that task

Well, I was only in on the very original one,

which was to undertake some things such as

changing the specific types of things to

meet a situation inthere. One of them was,

we would get a political section that would

work out better relations with the Vietnamese

government, a political section in our embassy,

and that the foreign service would go and

search through, their own personnel for people

with some real political sarry to get into

guide, rather than control or belabor or have

confrontations with the Vietnamesa government

to carry out essentially political reforms,

and getting some of the just criticism of

the opposition considered in the governing

body. "

Another thing was on the police, of

getting police training done

so that they

could cope with meeting enemy units, rather

then doing urban police work. In this, I

was begging them to ât least get to a state

level

constabularynas far as American advisors were

concernedo and I wasn't certain that the U.s.

Army's military police could cope with it, but

maybe they could get a team of them in and

then I was pointing out that there were

constabulary officers and officers from other

countries, including South America and the

old Philippine constabulary, who knew the.

law-and-order conditions--quite similar to

Vietnam--and bring them in if they wanted to

go international. I was trying to. get them

to get very realistica solving problems by

changing the quality and the approach that

we had.

We drew up an original draft that

Rusk's insistence, the task force went over

to State and became a general, regular body
