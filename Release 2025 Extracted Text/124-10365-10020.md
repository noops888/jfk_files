I. PREFACE

A. Purpose of Paper

This paper has been prepared to compare the results

of the 1967-68 interrogations of YURI NOSENKO with a CIA

paper dated February, 1968, entitled "The Examination of

the Bona Fides of a KGB Defector." This CIA paper was based

on previous interrogations of NOSENKO and concluded that

NOSENKO is not a bona fide defector

$ (4)

According to the paper, in arriving at this

conclusion the lengthy interrogations of NOCENKO, analysis

of KGB operations

which he related and comparison of his

assertions with collateral information from - ther sources

were considered.

B. Background

For convenience in assessing these papers, the

following chronology of events is set forth: (u)

NOSENKO first made contact with CIA in Geneva in

June, 1962. After several meetings he returned to Russia

and was not again in contact with CIA until his return to

Geneva in January, 1964.. On his return to Geneva he indicated

Significant inaccuracies were detected in the CIA

paper regarding the KEYZERS, MORONE]and ABIDIAN cases.

concrazy to statements in the paper, [REYzERSas see inter:

viewed about homosexual activities before he left Moscow;

MORONEj did have contact with a girl at American House posing

as a West German Journalist; the Soviet maid TATYANA FEDOROVICH

did have access to ABIDIAN's living quarters within six months

after his arrival in Moscow.

COMMENT :

A number of previous CIA conclusions

regarding this period were based on deficient

interrogations of NOSENKO and inadequate

collateral inquiries. These conclusions have

been invalidated by current interrogation and

collateral inquiries and there is no substan-

tial basis for doubting NOSENKO's basic claims

regarding this period.

1962-64 Period

It is concluded in the CIA paper that NOSENKO's

claims of being Chief of the American-British Commonwealth all

is alleged that NOSENKO did not indicate the sources from

which he obtained the information regarding the cases.

4)

During current interrogation NOSENKO provided

or logical explanation for his knowledge in sixteen of the

sources

nineteen cases referred to above. He also provided adequate

clarification regarding three of the other five cases which

were subjects of CIA criticism. In addition a current review

of his notes by NOSENKO provided the translation "ECTOR",

instead of "ACTOR" or [PROcTOR'prevlously obtained, as the

name of an agent. Collateral investigation has developed

a logical suspect by this name.

(logical suspects named

"ACTOR" or "'PROCTOR')

were not previously identified.)

COMMENT :

Previous interrogations of NOSENKO in

which information was not obtained regarding

the sources for these cases were obviously

Inadequate. Current interrogations have

provided significant clarifying information. sU)

I.

New Cases and New Information

The current interrogations of NOSENKO have developed

six new cases involving nine people which were previously not

uncovered during his interrogations. Collateral investigation

has identified six of these persons and one (DOMENICO CANALA)](S)

has been interviewed and admitted the allegations. This case

is considered significant corroboration of NOSENKO. 3O

Additional significant data was developed on three

cases previously mentioned by NOSENKO. Data in one case (the

Brussels case) may assist in the identification of a KGB agent

Who supplied NATO codes. * 4)

Considerable interesting, new and confirmatory data

was obtained during the current interrogations. Twelve examples

are cited

COMMENT:

The new cases, new information and

confirmatory data obtained in the current inter-

rogations and collateral inquiries also clearly

establish that the previous interrogations were

deficient and collateral inquiries inadequate.

Failure to acknowledge significance of NOSENKO'S

personnel identifications and organizational data

denotés lack of objectivity in ClA paper.

KARLAMOVA and the other was his arrest in

1954 when he used a KGB cover document to

obtain treatment for venereal disease. As

a result he was removed as Komsomol Secretary.

In addition the "Characteristic" which was prepared

on him in early 1955 was critical of him and his

mother had

interceded with FETR FEDOTOV, Chief

of SCD, who transferred NOSENKO to the 7th

tages 76-90 relate to NOSENKO's assignment to

that although NOSENKO could give a breakdown of the network

type of agents, he had forgotten their true names and could

not provide personality information on any of them

which he turned over to PHILLIP VASIIYEVICH KISLITSYN

On page 88 it is stated that Colonel EARl L.

the Soviet Union which NOSENKO did not report.

COMMENT :

recall specifically the arrest of MICKELSON out

stated that there were many "akts" against U. S.

military attache personnel in which they were

detained and written descriptions.of their so-called

"violations" were prepared. He indicated that the

described the chambermaid and furnished her code

first name was probably MARIYA but recognized DORA

probably July, and had appeared in the newspapers on

The CIA paper also relates that the KGB agent: GEORGE

BLAKE furnished to KGB in 1959 a 19 page document covering a

conference held in London between British and CIA representatives

outlining British and American use of tourists for intelligence

purposes. The KGB was therefore fully aware of the use of

tourists and it was stated that the substance of this informa-

tion, if not the document itself, would have been brought to:

the attention of the Deputy Chief of the American-British

Commonwealth Section.

of SCD wrote the final report about overall

American Intelligence operations against the USSR,

but NOSENKO's portion regarding use of tourists was

considered good and was accepted as written.

'(4)

NOSENKO stated that there was an analysis each

year regarding use of tourists for intelligence and

even in 1955 there were some indications of tourist

use by Americans including "little facts'' - how the

tourists acted, trying to get military information,

trying to find drops, studying candidates for

recruitment, etc. Each year they had good examples

for the analysis including the use of other

nationalities by the Americans. NOSENKO, however,

could not remember any of the specific examples

used in the analysis.

that this case, at the beginning, was

a task for the

7th Department. ("MC GUIRE"

was an "aspirant" (student)

"and he arrived in Russia having several tours and

had about 30 or 40 days." He was young and alone

and although there was no information on him in the

Archives he was suspected because of his "legend"

(stated reason for coming to the USSR). He, therefore

was the subject of coverage which detected his mailing

of a letter in Minsk. This was reported to Moscow by,

KGB in Minsk, apparently directed to GRIBANOV, who

turned the case over to the First (American) Department

which thereafter handled the investigation.: This

happened in the late 1950's but NOSFNKO could not

recall the year. NOSENKO stated that the letter

mailed by this MC COMAN - MC GUIRE]

passages. from a document which was in possession

of SCD and which related to discussions in London

the names of foreigners against whom KGB was working

or planned to work. The document was prepared in

1960-61. NOSENKO participated in discussions of

the content of the document after GOLITZYN's defection

and some cases mentioned therein were considered

compromised and "i'd out." He did not believe the

document contained the names of any persons who had

been recruited but mostly related to suspects.

He

he could recall in the document. However, on:

March 7, 1968, (N-159), he was shown a list of 26

It is considered probable that the 1961

communication referred to by GOLITZYN is identical

with, or related to, data furnished by SHAMROCK in (s)

1967 which indicated KGB was emphasizing operations

against code clerks in 1961. The contents of the

document made avatlable by SHAMROCK undoubtedly (S)

emanated from JOHN DISCOE SMITH, a former State

resigned in December, 1959, left the United States

In May or June, 1960, and whose whereabouts there:

after were unknown until he was publicized as a

defector by the Soviets in the Fall of 1967.

(u)

In this connection it is not clear how GRYAZNOV

of the SCD would have knowledge of SMITH in the Spring

of 1960. If SMITH was an agent prior to that time he

would have been antagent of FCD. NOSENKO has reported,

however, that another friend of GRYAZNOV!s, NIKOLAY

The possibility exists that GOLITZYN obtained

Information regarding the "'real agent" from SKVORISOV

rather than GRYAZNOV. SMITH could have arrived in

Moscow or otherwise have been in contact with

SKVORTSOV during the period April - July, 1960,

which GOLITYN Indicates in the period he talked

to GRYAZNOV. At any rate, there is no certainty that

an American code clerk assigned to Moscow in the Spring

included data indicating that a female KGB agent TATYANA

FEDOROVICH was used to place "metka" (an odorless substance)

on ABIDIAN' clothing. Later this substance was found on

letters mailed by ABIDIAN and traced to him. It is stated

that ABIDIAN had no maid until 16 months after his arrival

in Moscow and FEDOROVICH did not become employed by him until

July, 1961. It was concluded therefore that FEDOROVICH could

He stated that in 1961 the First Department had initiated

which was to contain some special equipment. This

equipment was to be provided by the Department of

KOSLOV pointed out the building where the Ministry

of Defense monitoring post was located. This post

had been set up prior to 1961.

the opinion that the new installation which was

Americans for contiming the BELTTSKIY operation

On August 1, 1968, (N-213), NOSENKO stated

ARTEMEV was selected as Security Officer. For the

delegation because he knew English and French. The

2nd Section did not have anyone with language

capabilities. This may explain why an officer of

the ist Section, would have been given the task of

directing BELITSKIY in Geneva rather than an officer

of the 2nd Section which handled the case. It is also

noted

that BELITSKIY was the subject of investigation.

However, NOSENKO in the current interviews does not

claim that ARTEMEV was inexperienced or that he

(NOSENKO) exercised any supervisory functions of

ARTEMEY's handling of BELITSKIY.

COMMENT:

On September 2, 1968, (N-218), NOSENKO stated

that he did not know about the girl friend of fBRAUNS.JG)

He said this was probably known to KRUPNOV, his

subordinate, who was the case officer. Considering

NOSENKO's limited participation in the case, his lack

of knowledge of the girl friend does not seem unusual.

10. PAVEL FEDOROVICH SHAKHOVE

On page 291 it is concluded that NOSENKO did not

direct the investigation of PAVEL FEDOROVICH SHAKHOV in Geneva

in 1962. The SHAKHOV case is discussed on pages 276-278 and

it is noted therein that NOSENKO claimed SHAKHOV was not and

never had been a KGB officer. It was

stated that RASTVOROV had

identified him as a KGB officer, PETROV and DERYABIN reported

that his photograph was familiar, BOURBON identified him as an

"employee", of KGB, an FBI source said he was a pure diplomat

(и)

COMMENT:

NOSENKO was interviewed concerning SHAKHOV on

February 24, 1968, (N-108), and related that he was a

diplomat in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from the

1930's and before that had worked for the Young

Communist League in leningrad. In the 1940's he

had worked for the Soviet "Embassy" in the USA and

was an FCD agent with the code name "RICHARD". In the

1950's KGB stopped work with him as an agent and put his

file in the archives. He participated in many meetings

and conferences relating to disarmament. In the late

1950's KGB started a "checking file" on him because

he was suspected of connections with American

Intelligence and there was a "signal" indicating

a connection with the American diplonat (MARK.](5)

Because of these suspicions, in 1962 a plan was prepared

to check him and NOSENKO was sent to Geneva as security

This suspicious behavior was somehow connected with

In addition, SHAKOV was close to one

employed by the United Nations) who was suspected

of connection with American, British, and Israeli

Intelligence and was also at one time connected wich

Soviet Intelligence. Investigation of SHAKHOV had

been initiated before 1962, possibly 1960 or 1961.

After NOSENKO's 1962 report regarding coverage in

Geneva, PETR IVANOVICH MASSYA was later sent to

Geneva with a delegation and also checked SHAKHOV

negatively.

NOSENKO commented that, although the file was

closed, any KGB officer who would be present at any.

_an eye on him. Also SHAKHOV would never be trusted

With regard to the identification of SHAKHOV

by the defectors mentioned above it is noted that

accurate knowledge of his connection with KGB and

both identified him as a former agent rather than an

COMMENT:

This case has not been clarified but no

were not true. His insistence can only raise

questions concerning the accuracy of his

recollections.

discredits his claim to complete knowledge of all aspects of

the

KGB relationship with OSWALD.

it is noted that NOSENKO alleged that a telegram had been

received by the KGB Residency in Geneva on February 4, 1964,

ordering NOSENKO to return to Moscow: Eventually NOSENKO

retracted this assertion and stated that there was no recall

telegram; that he invented the telegram to hasten his defection.

This case was referred to in notes brought

1967, (N-60), NOSENKO translated the name "ECIOR"

but acknowledged it could be "ACTOR." He related

that he had noted this name when a representative

of the FCD had complained to the 7th Department,

SCD, that this name had been included in a

connunication sent by Intourist through the

F'CD was afraid its valuable agent would be

IV. NEW CASES AND NEW OR CONFIRMATORY INFORMATION

Information set forth above regarding the cases

discussed in the CiA paper has clearly indicated that the

current series of interrogations of NOSENKO in 1967 and

1968 have been much more thorough and have produced

voluminous information clarifying data obtained fron him

in previous interviers. Of particular significance,

however, in addition to that set forth above is information

obtained during the current series of interviews which is

completely new. Some of the information relates to new cases

and some of it is new information on cases mentioned previously.*

Set forth below is a summary of the most significant data

in these categories and additional new and confirmatory data

obtained during the current interrogation. This material not

only suggests that the previous interviews were inadequate

but also appears significant in assessing the bona fides of
