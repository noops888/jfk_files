THE 201 SYSTEM
Rescission: Annex B of Chapter III, 70-1-1, 27 October 1966
INTRODUCTION
1. INTRODUCTION/
The 201 system provides a means for identifying a person of specific in-
terest to the and filing all pertinent
information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying
subjects of 201 files from various categories of information about them and for
producing lisits of 201 personalities according to those categories. Only a rela-
tively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify
opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and
CI investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi-
zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a volume of corre-
spondence has accumulated.
2. THE 201 SYSTEM
The principal features of the 201 system are:
a. The 201 Number: a unique number, i.e., 201-1234567, assigned to each
individual in the system to serve as identifying file number for reporting on that
individual.
b. The 201 Dossier: an official file containing the 201 opening form (Form
831) and all biographic reporting on and references to the individual, i.e., per-
sonal history, current status, and prospects.
c. The Master 201 Record: a machine record generated by the opening of
a 201 file. This record produces the master 201 reference for the Main Index and
stores the pertinent information which may later be retrieved for special listings.
d. Main Index Master 201 Reference: this reference, printed in reply to an
Index Search Request, is printed as illustrated below. When data are absent
within the record, succeeding data items or lines will be moved up and the ref-
erence consolidated.

e. Ol Code: a two letter symbol used in conjunction with the 201 per-
sonality records in the 201 system to record the association of an individual
with organizations or activities of operational intelligence interest. Of codes cover intelli-
gence and security service affiliation whether staff or agent, or known or
suspect, as well as activities of continuing target interest. There are two categories of OI
codes for use by components (Attachment 2).
(1) general OI codes
(2) OI codes assigned to a specific component for intelligence services
or other specific organizations.
À component may request an OI code be established by submitting a mem-
orandum to the DDO/RMO through the component Records Management
Officer.
A 201 personality may be assigned two OI codes. An OI code may be assigned
when the 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) is initiated (see
paragraph 3b below) by filling in Box 13 or a code may be assigned or added
at a later date by a Form 831 amendment.
The 201 system has the capability of producing machine listings of 201
personalities by OI codes. For example, if an OI code has been opened for the
security service of a certain country a listing may be compiled of all members
of that service.
f. 201 Machine Lists: produced from the mechanized 201 Index, based on
names or other identifying information of personalities on whom 201 dossiers
exist.
3. OPENING A 201 DOSSIER
a. General
The opening of a 201 dossier is the prerogative of an operational com-
ponent, in coordination with the Information Services Group (ISG). The opening creates
a master 201 record and the occasional closing of a 201 dossier are
controlled jointly by desks and ISG. 201 dossiers may be opened on
persons who meet the criteria described in Chapter II of this
handbook, when there is a reasonable expectation that additional information
will be acquired and filed in such a dossier. Generally dossiers are opened on
persons about whom counterintelligence information is being reported, and per-
sons of operational interest to the Operations Directorate, specifically those
persons for whom provisional operational approvals and operational approvals
are requested (see exception below). 201 files are not to be opened on staff
employees, staff agents and most categories of contract employees. Files on

persons who are only of local interest to a field station or Headquarters desk
and on whom no DDO records correspondence exists are not a part of the DDO
records system and are to be maintained by that unit. Some desks levy require-
ments on ISG for automatic 201 openings on certain categories of persons whose
names appear in incoming dispatches. These are listed in Attachment 2. 201
dossiers should be opened to the following categories:
(1) Subjects of provisional operational approval and operational ap-
proval requests. However, a file need not be opened when a POA is requested
for persons being trained for a foreign liaison service and who are of opera-
tional interest for training purposes only.
(2) Persons for whom the field requests a 201 opening.
(3) MHFIXTURE personalities: bonafide diplomats of other than
denied area countries, in close association with staff personnel.
(4) Subjects of a Personal Record Questionnaire Part I.
(5) Persons on whom a Main Index search reveals information in five
or more documents (see DOI 70-20).
(6) Subjects of Interagency Source Register memoranda from LSN/
ISR (opened only by IP/RMS).
b. Requesting a 201 File Opening
Headquarters desks may open a 201 file by filling out and submitting
a 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) to the Records Main-
tenance Section (IP/RMS). Form 831 is also used to create or amend the
master 201 record and produces the 201 machine listings and to register the assign-
ment of a cryptonym to the 201 personality. Attachment 3 consists of sample
201 Personality File Action Requests for opening and amending 201's. A field
station may request the opening of a 201 file by writing 201- in the Head
cross-reference box on the subject's name in the body of the dispatch. A telepouch
request for a 201 opening is made by indicating 201- in the file number line. A cable
request is made by placing 201- after the term "File" on the last line of the transmission. IP/AN
will open 201 files as requested by dispatch or telepouch but it is the responsi-
bility of the desk to respond to cable requests. Field stations are notified of
201 openings through receipt of the field master 201 record.

4. CONTENTS OF THE DOSSIER
Information about a 201 personality should be filed or cross-referenced into
his dossier. When additional information is discovered on a 201 subject through
a name trace or other process, i.e., review of predecessor documents, it must
be consolidated into his personality dossier in accordance with established
procedures.
Material which is filed in the 201 personality dossier includes, but is not limited to:
a. 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831).
b. Biographic information, including photographs, fingerprints, and
handwriting samples.
c. Personal Record Questionnaire Parts I and II.
d. Operational and other security approvals.
e. Name check replies, requests, clearances, and approvals.
f. Acknowledgement of pseudonym.
g. 201 personality assessments and evaluations.
h. Copy of contract and termination papers.
i. Secrecy agreement.
j. Agent Duty Status Report.
k. Training and evaluation.
l. SGSWIRL Reports.
m. Newspaper clippings.
n. Any information which will provide a better understanding of the
subject and our interest in him; this may include operational reporting.
5. MAINTENANCE OF 201 DOSSIERS
The 201 personality dossier contains, in document date order, papers which
have been made a part of the Central Records System as well as those which
have not. Record documents may range from newspaper or magazine articles
on the subject to finance and other administrative papers.

6. Purging
Purging a 201 dossier is the responsibility of the desk officer. It requires
discrimination in recognizing operationally useful material, rather than the
simple distinction between official and unofficial papers; it will therefore take
place under the supervision of a Records Officer. Purging should be done
periodically. A 201 dossier being forwarded to Central Files for retention should
be purged. A 201 dossier should be purged of the following:
(1) Duplicate material.
(2) Name trace exact copy(s) of a document.
(3) All abstract slips.
(4) All document restriction notices (Form 1884) unless it has been the basis for
the opening.
(5) The disseminated version of positive intelligence information if
a copy of the raw report is contained in the 201 file; the dissemination number
then must be transferred to the first page of the raw report.
(6) Routing slips, routing and record sheets (Form 610) and dispatch
cover sheets unless there are remarks such as coordinations or comments.
(7) Record copy documents which only repeat substantive information
contained in other documents in the file; authorization for destruction is
by the Records Officer.
(8) Top Secret documents are not retained in a 201 dossier. To downgrade a Top Secret
document, an authorized officer in the originating office or the Records Officer having jurisdiction
over the contents of the material must possess Top Secret classification
authority. If the document cannot be downgraded the file should be retained
at the desk or the copy of the TS document should be removed, retained
in a desk TS file or forwarded to the Top Secret Control Officer, and a
cross-reference sheet (Form 867) placed in the 201 file giving the location
of the TS document.
(9) Deferred documents (see 5b(2)).
b. Maintenance Procedures
(1) All material in a 201 dossier will be filed in document date order.
In the case of document attachments which have been classified into a 201

dossier and separated from the basic document by the assignment of a slash
number, the attachment will be filed by the date of the basic document.
(2) Deferred documents will not be filed in a 201 dossier. If they are
to be retained in the dossier they should be sent to IP/RMS for classification
into that 201.
(3) Field index cards (held by some desks) and area desk cards may
be retained in the 201 as part of a consolidation procedure. These cards
should be mounted on a sheet of paper for filing in the 201.
(4) A 201 dossier previously opened on a person who becomes a staff
employee and which contains Record Copy documents will be restricted to
the ISG/DIP unless the desk retains the restriction. The dossier should be
closed if there are no Record Copy documents in it.
(5) A 201 opened in pseudonym should be consolidated into the true
name 201 if one exists or converted to the true name.
(6) Field and duplicate (shadow) 201 files no longer of active interest
should be incorporated into the official 201 after the duplicate material
has been purged by the desk officer and the remaining information classified
to that 201 by the Analysis Section (IP/AN).
(7) Any document with a predecessor organization cover sheet or an
OPC (Office of Policy Coordination) cover sheet from the Archives and
Disposition Section (IP/ARD) must be returned to IP/ARD for processing
to the 201.
(8) Desk memoranda (without a document source number) containing substantive
or derogatory information on the subject of the 201 should be sent to
IP/AN for classification officially into the 201 file.
(9) An attachment which should be separated from its basic document
for inclusion in a 201 Personality Dossier will be forwarded with the basic
document to IP/AN for reprocessing into the 201.
(10) To retain the P&L, RYBAT, or KAPOK sensitivity of a document
remaining in a 201 dossier being retired to Central Files, place that document
in an envelope sealed with black tape (see DOI 70-17). Any RYBAT, P&L,
or KAPOK document sent to Central Files not in a black-taped envelope will
automatically be handled as desensitized. A black-taped envelope may con-
tain only one document and must be filed in chronological order within the
file. If there are numerous documents of this type the desk officer may black-
tape the entire dossier rather than individual documents (see DOI 70-10).

8. REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION ON 201 PERSONALITIES
The Automated Index Section (IP/AIS) will provide the identity of the
subject of a 201 number unless the 201 file is restricted, in which case the
requester will be referred to the restricting desk.
IP/AIS will also provide the 201 number assigned to a name, unless the 201
file is restricted, or state that there is no 201 number assigned. Requesters should
supply identifying information whenever possible for each name submitted.
Requests pertaining to five or fewer names or numbers may be made by
telephone by calling the IP/AIS red line extension; IP/AIS will provide the
information by return call to the requester's extension as listed in the Badge
Table. Requests for more than five names or numbers must be listed and sent
by tube or courier to IP/AIS; IP/AIS will reply by return mail.
9. 201 DOSSIER CANCELLATION
A 201 file may be authorized for cancellation by a Records Officer, after
appropriate coordination. The file should be forwarded to IP/RMS which will
destroy the folder and the cards leading to it and will remove the name and
number from machine lists. Any Record Copy document contained in the folder
will be reclassified to another appropriate file or sent to the Destruction Unit
(IP/DU) as directed by the desk Records Officer.
10. 201 MACHINE LISTINGS
Machine listings provide field stations and Headquarters desks with names
and 201 numbers in the requester's particular geographic or functional area of
interest. If a component wishes to exclude a sensitive 201 personality from its
alphabetic, numeric, and cryptonym listings, this may be done when opening
the 201 or later by a 201 amendment. On the 201 Personality File Action Request
(Form 831) leave the country of location (Box 15 and interest desk (Box 16)
blank, use the non country code 900 in the action box (Box 14), and indicate
permanent charge to the responsible desk. The only listing which will include the
201 number is the IP/20k record for the Vital Records program. 201 listings are
categorized as standard or nonstandard and as scheduled or special.

CHAPTER III, ANNEX B
15 November 1974
All standard listings are cumulative; previous editions must be destroyed
upon receipt of current editions. These listings are by their very nature extremely
sensitive compilations of information and must be given every possible safeguard.
b. Non-Standard Listings
Based on one or more of the following selection criteria:
(1) Country of birth
(2) OI codes (organization or intelligence affiliation)
(3) Citizenship
(4) Year of birth (plus or minus a given number of years)
(5) Occupation.
These selection criteria may be used singly or in combinations. For example,
a user could obtain a list of all 201 personalities who have been assigned the
OI code of XX or codes of XX, XY, or XZ. A 201 personality list could also be
produced of all persons who were born in Germany between the years 1915
and 1920, with the occupation computer specialist, who are now citizens of the
United States, located in Mexico, and who had been assigned the OI code AA.
Note however that the listing would contain only those personalities with an
OI code AA. Those personalities with an OI code other than AA and those
with no OI code would be excluded
