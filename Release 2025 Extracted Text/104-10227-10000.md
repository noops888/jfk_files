Yurily Ivanovich NOSENKO

IDENTIFICATION:

BACKGROUND

NOSENKO, Yurily Ivanovich,

i soviet

KGB officer who defceted in

wis subscquently involuntarily con-

In the U.s. by the Asency

i period of approximately three ycars.

NOSENKO first contacted Agency per-

sonnel in switzerland in sune 1962

and subsequently defected in January

NOSINKO was brought to the 11.5.

and after i period of relative freedom.

he was involuntarily confined in

April 1964.

from April 1964 to

August 1065, he was confined at an

Agency controlled site in Clinton,

Maryland.

From August 1965 to

October 1967, NOSENKO was confined

at Camp Peary, Virginia.. In October

1967, he was

returied to the Washington

area, given increasing amounts of

freedom until he was given total free-

dom in April 1969. NOSENKO became a

U.S. citizon in April 1971. NOSESKO

was. employed by the Agency. as a

consultant in March 1969 and continues

under contract to dutc.

His present

salary is $23,500 per year.

(1) The legal basis to confine NoSEiKo

against his will was discussed by

Mr. Richard Heins, DD/P, and others sith

the Deputy Attorney Ciencral on 2 April

1964 (Tab 1) •

On 3 April 1204, the

Agency General Counsel, Mr. Lawrence

Houston, advised the Director of Security

by memorandum that such confinement was

proper (Tab 2).

RESULTS

COMMENTS

SAN

Ry memorandun

dated 2 Decober 1908,

the Director of socurity fornarded

two reports to the DUCt summarizing

the results of the NOSiNo case to

that date.

The reports are voluminous.

One was prepared by the Office of

sccurity and the other by the FBi.

Both reports conclude that NOSENKO

was a bona fide defector.

A draft

memorandum attached to this file,

dated 21 October 1968 and prepared

by the Cl Staff, raises question

regarding NOSENKO's bond fides

und challenges the shove two reports.

NOSENKO continues under contract to

the Agency.

He is brought to Washington

periodically to consult on matters

germane to his background and experience.

Virious reports are availible in the

files of the Offico of Scourity which

detail financial aspects of this case.

No final accounting has been made since

the project continues.

(1) While the Office of Socurity files

do document the rationale for the original

document the rationale

confinement of NOSENKO, for his continued

confinement over so long a period of timo.

A memorandum dated 5 August 1909 states

that various congressional staff officers

were briefed on NOSENKO and states that

oncern for his safety, as well as con•

cern regarding his bona fides, prompted

the prolonged confinement.

(See Tab 6)

(2) Office of Security files document

a period in 1969 during which a mail

cover was placed on SOSENKO.

3) During the above period, NOSENKO

Wils

allowed a pleasure trip

to florida.

During this trip, Agency personnel, with

apparent Headquarters approval, obtained

the services of prostitutes.

This

apparently occurred on at least two

occasions.

MEMORANDUM FOR:

Director of Security

SUBJECT:

Parole Status of Dofectors

1. On 2 April 1964 we had a discussion with the Dapartment

of Justice on the status of aliens whose inspection by I&NS ia deferred

upon arrival at our request and who are then paroled to this Agency.

it was the position of the Department of Justice that we were responsibla

for taking any action necessary to carry out the torms of the parole.

•2. As you know, a basic parole agreement was executed by the

Attorney General and the DCI on 10 February 1955. Altor setting up

conditions for authorizing parole in any one case, the agreement atatos:

"After parole of such aliens, the Central Intelligence Agency will assume

responsibility for caro, supervision and control of a kind and degree it

belioves consistent with the internal security needs of the United Stales

during continuance of their parole status. " This means that the

responsible Agency officials must take the minimum action necassary

. to protect the internal security needs of the United.Staies. The word

"minimum" is not necessarily a limitation. It merely means that good

judgment must be used as to what kind and degree of action is necessary.

3.

The agreement further provides that upon completion of the

parolee's intelligence or operational purposes in the United States or if

internal security reasons so require, the alien will be removed from

this country through arrangements made by the Agency and, in such

case, the Agency will inform the Service in advance of each proposed

departuro.

Effective immediately or as soon as practicable, the following

procedures. will apply with regard to the handling of the

Subjecte

(1) Subject will receive a regular diet with modest regulated

portiong.

He is to have no dessert or "trimmings, "

but may have the necessary silverware with which to

eat properly. (CAUTION--Extreme care should be

exerciged with regard to controlling the silverware,

and it was suggested that at least two of the guards

be required to count the silverware in and out; that

the silverware be placed on the tray in a manner

where it could be observed before the guards enter

the room, etc. )

(2)

Arraugements are to be made for the installation of

adequate air-conditioning equipment to ingure that a

comfortable temperature is maintained. (It is under-

done on a regular: schedule. We will await specific

instructions from SR Division as to when these items

are to be accomplished in the future.)

Subject only on Tuesday each week.

(7)

In addition to the above,. it ratist be emphasized that

our attitude toward the Subject will remain precisely

the same, and our security procedures, including

searches, will continue to be at maximum control.

- 3.

wether ascertained that we will have custody of

the Subject until at least July, It was suggested that perhaps we may

wish to explore some modifications in the assignment of personsel

or schedule of assignments. In addition, the Acting Chief, Support

Branch has suggested that immediate consideration be given to

devising necessary procedures to be followed in the event of an

emergency involving loss of control of the Subject. This should

be discussed immediately with the responsible DFO supervisors

and specific procedures devised, and all guards properly informed

as to their responsibilitios in this matter.

The St

Division

(then SR) was the

responsible office for the confinement of Nosenko until late

October: 1967 when total responsibility was transferred to the

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO

In early or mid-1967, the Agency General. Counsel was

provided a summary of the Nosenko case. The nemorandum

sought an

advisory opinion from the General Counsel on the

Agency's legal basis for its handling of liosenko through

that date and on the legal aspects on the eventual disposi-

tion of Nosenko. Shortly subsequent to this senorandum to

the General Counsel, Nosenko took

up residence in October 1967

in an apartment in the Washington area and was reminded that

should he wish, he could travel freely anywhere at anytime.

He gradually created a new life for himself in the United

States and has indicated on several occasions that he holds

no ill feeling about his handling by the Agency at anytime.

Background

Nosenko voluntarily established contact with CIA repre-

sentatives in Geneva in 1962. He identified hisself as a

staff officer of the KGB's internal security directorate and

offered to sell counterintelligence information. This offer

was

accepted and he was recruited as

an agent in place and

debriefed

on counterintelligence matters during five meetings

in Geneva. He then returned to the USSR. He came to Geneva

again in January 1964 as the security officer for the Soviet

disarmament delegation. After a number of mectings with his

CIA handlers he defected on 4 February 1961 and was secretly

taken to Frankfurt, Germany, crossing the Swiss-German border

on the night of d/5 February with

alias U.s. Army identity

documents. In Geneva and again upon arrival in Frankfurt,

Nosenko wrote out

an asylum request, requesting political

asylum

from the U.S. Government.

Because serious doubts about Nosenko's bona fides had

arisen on the basis of the information he had provided both

in 1962 and in the meetings in Geneva in 1964, it was orig-

inally planned to do a detailed bona fides debriefing and

assessment in Germany before making any decision about moving

Nosenko to the United States. However, unprecedented action

by the Soviet. Government in respect to the defection of one

of its citizens forced a change of plans. On 9 February,

unidentified Soviet sources in Geneva leaked the news to the

press that

Nosenko, described as an "expert attached to the

Soviet Delegation to the Disarmament Conference" had dis-

appeared, and that it was presumed that he had defected.

2

## Page 50

14-00000

SECRET

Because of mounting

pressure from

the press, which

included

much speculation that Nosenko was a

high level scientist or

disarmament expert, it was decided

that the State Department

would make a brief announcement acknowledging Nosenko's

request for asylum in the U.S. and identifying him as a

member of the KGB. This was done on 10 February. On 1l Feb-

ruary, the Soviet Covernment delivered a note to the American

Embassy in Moscow

asking how Nosenko left Switzerland and

requesting an immediate interview with him and his release.

On 12 February, Soviet Anbassador to the Disarmament Confer-

ence TSARAPKIN held a press conference in Geneva in which he

accused the Swiss Government of failure to cooperate in

locating Nosenko: Although the Swiss categorically rejected

these charges, the American Ambassador to Switzerland recom-

mended that Swiss authorities be allowed to interview Nosenko

to convince themselves that Nosenko had left Switzerland of

his own free will.

On 12 February 1964, on the instructions of the Director,

Nosenko was brought to the United States. He travelled by

commercial air, again using alias U.S. Army

identification,

and was admitted to the country. at New York City (in true

name) on parole under the provisions of Section

212 (d) (5)

of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

of the U.S. in Nosenko's case.

the U.S. of kidnapping Nosento. On the afternoon of 14 Sep-

tember, at two separate interviers, he spoke first to Swiss

Embassy and then to Soviet Embassy

represcntatives..At

these interviews, which were also attended by State Department

and INS officials, Nosenko confirmed that he left Switzerland

of his own free will to seel asylum in the U.S. In addition,

he replied

to questions of the Sovict Embassy representative

to the effect that he was renouncing his Soviet citisenship.

On the evening of 14 february, the.U.S. State Department made

a brief formal reply to the Soviet protest, then issued a

brief statement to the press noting that the interviews had

been held and that Nosenko had confirmed his desire to remain

in this country.

he was most insistent that we should proceed with immediately,

involved the compromise of a very senior Soviet official.

Beginning in April 1964, hundreds of hours were devoted

so interrogations

of Nosenko

(in which he willingly cooperated)

and a great deal of time was

spent on exhaustive collateral

investigations. We concluded that it had been established

beyond

reasonable doubt that Nosenko was a liB agent who.

established contact with CIA, subsequently defected on KGB

instructions, and that he came to the United States on a

deception mission.

The implications of this mission had a

grave und direct

bearing on U.S. national security. Although

our findings were

supported by the results of two polygraph

examinations, the nature of the evidence was inadmissable in

a court of law. In any case, it is clear that Nosenko had

not been in a position to perform any overt act of transgres-

sion of U.S. espionage laws since 4 April 1964 when he was

placed in a restricted area and deprived of any conceivable

means of communication with the KGB.

Nosenko did not admit that he defected on KGB orders

or that he came to the U.S. on a KGB mission. He has admitted,

however, that he made numerous lies about his personal history

and about the details of his KGB service to U.S. officials,

both before and after

arriving in the United States.

Coordination with Other U.S. Government Agencies

USIB Members. In accordance with the DUCI's ruling

relating to a defector who has been a member of a hostile

intelligence service, Nosenko's status and handling was dis-

Nosenko defecred on d february 1904, and the

Secrotary of State, the Attorney General, the Special Assis-

tant to the President on National Security Affairs, McGeorge

Bundy, lieneral Carroll, Director of the befense Intelligence

Agency and the fBI. were

all notified inmediately. On s lebru-

ary 1904, General Carter reported the defection to in executive

session of Usiß and followed this up with formal statements to

USIB members on 11 and 19 Fobruary 1964, which stated that

Nosenio's bond fides had not yet been established. It was

agreed that no DS number would he issued to sosenko, and that

he would be handled on a special basis by this Agency. In

fact, normal USIB interest in losento as a defector dropped

off drastically as

it became quickly apparent that he had no

positive intelligence interest of value to any part of the

communit).

The President was informed of the full extent of our

suspicions about Nosenko's bona fides by the then Director,

Mr. Mccone, on 11 February 196%. Vr. Patrick Coyne, Executive

Secretary of the PFIAB, was given i similar briefing by

Mr. Helas on 19 February 1964.

Generals Carroll and Fitch of DlA here also subsequently

informed

of the problems about losinto's bona fides.

The secretary of State, Ambassador Thompson, and other

senior officials in the Department of State vere informed of

our reservations about Nosenko's bond lides and our fears that

he might be i dispatched KGB agent. In discussions about the

possibility of Nosenko's eventual deportation, the Sccretary

of State expressed serious concern

about the adverse. resction

that such

il move might have on other

potential defectors.

The Director of Security, State Department, was informed

of the bona fides problem at an carly date. We have worked

closely with this office since then on the problem of cral-

uating the significance of rosenko's information as it affects

the security interests of the State Department.

•Becausc so much of Nosenko's information affected u.s.

internal security matters for which the FBl bears primary

responsibility, and because the possibility that Nosenko nas

a X0P plant had a direct bearing

on the validity of cortain

FBI operations, the FBI was kept fully informed on our views

about losenko's bona fides and our progress in interrogating

and investigating him from

the moment of his defection.. The

FBI liaison officer was told of our reservations on vosento's

bona fides as

carly as 5 February 1964. The Director öf the

F31 and his dcputy for Internal Security, Milliam Sullivan,

aspecas of our handling dosenko with them. After a long

to revicw

Vosenko's case on 1 April 1964, the IBl interposed

no objec-

tions 10 our proposal to restrict Nosenko's movements and

commence hostile interrogation.

Subsequently.e.the FBI for-",

mally agroed with

our findings on Nosenko, at least to the

excess that "On considering carefully the results of your

interrogations of luriy Nosenko and your anälysis of sis

statements and activities, it does appear he is not what he

purporis to be. While this Bureau is not in a position to

draw any conclusion in this case, we do recognize it is

possible that

Nosento could be a Soviet plant or agent pro-

vocateur."

Tae then dering Attorney General Mr. Hicholas Katzenbach

(and sereral members of his staff) were apprised of our res-

ervations

about rosenko on 2 April 1964 ind an opinion was

sought from him both as to interpretation of the exclusion

and parole agreement, and as to how we should proceed in the

event that it proved necessary to deport losenko from this

country.

Litones to Keep the Nik from Learning of Our Awareness of

Noserto's True Status

From the time ne learned that dosenko had been sent to

this country

on i dil mission it was obvious that if we bere

10

SESHET

## Page 58

SECRET

to have the time to analyce and resolve this case, and to

plan and execute appropriate countermeasures, it was essential

that de attcmpt to keep the NGB fron learning of our awareness

of Nosenko's true status. Consequently, detailed knowledge

of the depth and scope of our suspicions about Nosenko, and

the implications thercof, was restricted tu a very few people

in the Agency and the intelligence community.

Nonetheless,

we did advise key policy echelons and principals in the intel-

ligence community, even though this carried the incvitable

risk of leakage.

Soviet Inspired Inquiries

In 1966 there were several indications that the Soviets

were making a serious effort to find out what happened to

Nosenko and to force him to the surface. The most blatant

and unusual of these was the approach by a Soviet journalist,

Yuriy KOROLEV (a known NCB agent), to the Frerch

magazine

Paris Match with an offer

to provide photographs and materials

for an exclusive story of Nosenko and his family. According

to Korolev, Nosenko's wife was considering an approach

to an

international juridicial organization in an effort to obtain

compensation from Nosenko for damages caused by his abandon-

ment of her and her children.:

In responding to this approach

we quoted a statement, purporting to be fron Nosenio himself,

•11

SECRET

---

## Page 59

4-00000

SEGRET

to the effect that Nosenko considers this approach

to repre-

sent blatant and cruel manipulation of his family by the KGB

and that he will not lend himself to the schene by agreeing

to an interview or in any other way.

Nosenko's Status

To recapitulate, Nosenko entered the United States on

12 February 1964 on parole to the Agency under the provisions

of Section 212 (d) (5) of the Immigration and Nationality

Act.. Parole responsibility is delegated to the Agency by

the Attorney General under the terms of an agreement executed

by the Attorney General and the ICI on 10 February 1955,

which states:

"After

parole of such aliens, the Central Intel-

ligence Agency will assume responsibility for

care, supérvison and control of a kind and

degree it believes consistent with the internal

security needs of the United

States during con-

tinuance of their parole status."

In accordance with our understanding of this agreement, and

because we had reason to believe that Nosenko was a conscious

and willing agent of a hostile intelligence service, we

ensured that he was under our direct observation and control

at all times from the moment of his arrival in the United

12

SECRET

States. From

12 february to a april 1904 it was possible to

keep Nosenio at a location where he could

enjoy a certain

amount of movement and of contact with

the outside world.

After & April 1964, for reasons explained above, it was

necessary to keep him incommunicado at a location which is

known to no one outside of the agency land to very few within

it). Authorization for Nosenko to remain in this country

under the special Agreement Procedures was periodically

extended by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

Although his freedon of movement had been severely

restricted, Nosenko was not maltreated and he made no com-

plaint about his treatment. Un the contrary, we had several

written statements from him in which he stated that our.

handling of him was justified and even beneficial.

Disposal

Iron the time that dosenko was brought to this country

we thought about the possibility of his eventual deportation

as a contingency measure. In carly 1964, we thought that it

might be possible to mitigate the political and propaganda

drawbacks of a forced deportation by announcing that Nosenio

has confessed his true KGB role.

With the passage of time,

however, and in view of our much firmer conclusions about his

real role and mission

and our clearer understanding of what

13

SECRET

---

## Page 61

4-00000

SECRET

this implied, it was apparent that great practical problems

stood in the wily of his deportation to either the USSR or a

third country.

USSR: Nosenko has categorically stated on numerous

occasions that. he will never contemplate return to the USSR,

and, although we suspect that. he might secretly

welcome such

is move, we would expect him to act out his part to the end

with loud protests that he was being shipped to his death,

etc.

when the possibility of expulsion was discussed with

Departnent of State officials in 1904, both the Secretary of

State and Ambassador Thompson expressed their concern for

the adverse effect this might have on other potential defec-

tors.

Forcible repatriation of political refugees is against

long established U.s. policy, and would be cortain to arouse

violent reaction

from

ethnic minority groups in the United

States.

Under. these circumstances an alleged "confession"

by Nosenko would have come under very close scrutiny, and

right have backfired very

badly. Another point that had to

be considered was

the possibility that the Soviets, again

playing their part, might have refused

to accupt Nosenko on

the grounds that he has renounced his Soviet citizenship.

Third Country: Although we believed it likely that

Nosenko would accode to deportation to a third country,

14

SECRET

---

## Page 62

there is certainly no country in the free world

on which we

could

conceivably have unloaded Nosenko without first inform-

ing them of his true status. Even if ve considered this a

desirable objectivo, it seemed certain that the Department

of State would veto such à piece of intergovernmentil duplic-

hey on the basis of the politienrisks involved.*

: Office of Security reports on PARAGON,

NOSENKO, AELADLE, CELOTEX I and Il

and MOCKINGBIRD

Forwarded herewith is a 31 December 1974 memorandum

from the Acting. Director of Security on subject activities. The

material represents responses to questions posed by your office.

Obviously, the next phase of the investigation will require more

detailed reviews of each activity.

2. Questions that occur to us in reading the attached, are:

PARAGON

We should spell out what is meant by the

statement that the FBI "deferred further coveragé

to the Office of Security," how it was expressed and

what form it took.

The taping of two conversations does not seem

to constitute "electronic surveillance" in the usual

sense. It certainly is not trespatory surveillance.

A little more detail on the equipmeni will be wanted.

NOSENKO

We will go to the DDO for any record of DCI

knowledge, and report such information as we get.

AELADLE

We will want to verify DDCI's approval of entry.

... 3d)

## Page 68

CELOTEX I

We will want more detail on the actual

surveillance, including possible higher approval.

This is responsive to the DCI's request for

newspaper articles that led to the surveillance.

CELOTEX II

Questions similar to CELOTEX I.

-We may want actual copies of newspaper

stories for display, in addition to memos, should

DCI wish to use it..

* MOCKING BIRD.

No recorded (in CIA) formal approval by

Attorney General. It may be that Justice will

have a copy.

Does this raise a question of surveillance

John Torpats,

an ex-CIA employee, and one Eduard Oun, an Estonian defector.

Torpats was born in 1898 in Estonia, and became a

naturalized U.S. citizen

in 1926.

Torpats was employed by

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

Rockefeller Commission Contact

Mason Cargill told me today that the reference

in the Commission report to an employee wno was

fired

because he abused a defector came from a deposition by

Dick Helms:

•Helms could not

but from the description which he

none sere an exact position,

it is clear that. the employee who was fired was John

Torpats. He was discharged by Allen W. Dulles in 1960.

Torpats, himself a Lithuanian refugee, was working

in the Defector Reception Center in Frankfort,

In the course of interrogating another Lithuanian

defector; Torpats beat him.

After Torpats was fired,

he sued the Director (then Mccone).

He lost the case:

Nosenko: In Endand I was NIKOLAYEV and in your country I was NIKOLAYEV.

Q: ---first and middle name?

Nosenko: Yes, Yuriy, Yurly, also Yurly.

Q: And in England you also were for a short time?

Nosenko: In England I was for ten and fifteen days.:

Nute: During the interrogation of Nosenko in 1964, he denied that he ever

said that he was in the United States.

2. You stated previously that while traveling to England and Cuba, you were

documented as Nikolayev. Undor what cover did you traval to those countries?

What was your Legend-Biography?

Note: Any KGB officer going abroad under another name and under

cover propares a Legond-Biography.to cover up his real

identity.

Il Nosenko travelled as Nikolayes, then his legend

omitted "the fact" that he was a son of a Minister because.

there was no Minister of Shipbuilding Industry with the name

of Nikolayev, etc., erc.)

. 3. You stated previously that in January 1960 you were processed to go to the

US with the Sovict Automotive Delegation. You obtained a passport in your

true nario, Nosento, bat the date was postponce, then cancelled. Who

selected your candidacy for the trip?

What were you supposed to do in

the USA? Why was the trip postponed? Why were you processed in your

III. Sovic visas and other regulations for tourists traveling to the USSR.

1. 1. Didn't you know or remember how. Oswald's visa was processed and

from what country Oswald entered the USSR? Is it possible that he

entered the USSR on a "podvisnaya" visa?

V 2. You previously said that you saw Oswald's visa application, but you could

not say from what country Oswald came to the USSR. In your opinion, is

it possible that Oswald received his visa application in some other European

country, then went to Finland and through Finland entered the USSR without

contacting the Sovict cossulate in Helsinki? Did you hear any talk about the

possibility that is described above? I su, when did you hear it and from

whom?

V 3. On 3 July 1961 you siaird that you have seen Oswald's anteta (visa

application). Do you reinember what was in that anketa? Did you read

the anketa? What did jou mean that you saw the anketa? Was it in the

naine Lee Harvey Oswala, or was there another name? Did you see the

name of the person usa signed the ankera?

Ao lore you there iny infermation do this offred flane Ornadle might not have

comes 10 the 50969 consulate or to the Soviet Embarry in Helsinki lo

stasin his visi! Could he hive allained is vine in Switerland ur Sweden

seen nase corne lo deininti and, without reporting lo the Soviet conculate

is Helsinki, have licen a train to beringrad and then lo Mencow?.

l 5o decordling to your previous inforrnation, "imy tourisl - he luyn a lour

10 the Soviel Union, makes out the anbolie, and lim comes lo Moscow."

. In what country did Onwald buy i tour to the USSK? in whit country did

Oswald fill in the arkota? I the ankola ques lo Moscow, lo what offico

in Moscow does it go? To MID, KGB? Is it possiblo that all the data on

Oswald from his ankcia was sent to Muscow by a cable? Did you see and

read Oswald's ankets or a telegrarn that Ouwald is coming to Moscow?

If you did not read the anketa, who arnong the KGB officers of the Second

Chief Directorate or the First Chief Directorate read the ankola or had

access to it? Who would logically have acceas lo tho anketa?

vil. According to your previous information, any person who wants to visit the

USSR has to buy a tour in a foreign touriat firm in his home country or any

other country, and the tourist firm will make arrangements for his stay in

the USSR. It is understood that he must fill in tho ankota, and in addition to

the general questions, the common tourist should mako requests for the

cítico he intends to visit and for the accommodations he wants. The tourist

would know in advance when he receives his visa his date of arrival in

Moscow; in what hotel he is going to stay, and what kind of accommodations

he would be given. The question, then; is do you know when Intourist

received Oswald's sequest and application and when it answered him that

his dernands are met and that he is welcome in Moscow?

17. From your knowledge, when Oswald arrived in Moscow, was he handled by

the Intourist Agency or by Sputnik, the Youth Tourist Bureau of the USSR,.

or toy the Central Council for Tourism of the Soviet Trade Unions?

Note: The Contral Council for Touriom of the Sortet Trade Unions organizes

exchanges of tourists between trade unions of the USSR and othor

countries. Sputnik was organized in June 1958 for the exchange of.

of tourists (students and other youths).

Soviet Intourist representative in that connery ville look Oswall's visa

application do the Sovice Barbiessy?

Jo, You nited proviously that Oswald win not considered i defector. If he

was not a defector, then what wils he?

Note:

Is the KGB did nut consider Oswald to be a defector, then it is

possible that Oswald was known to the KGB long before him arrival

in the USSK as i tourist and Onwald was angured that when he

arrived in the USSR he would be given Soviet citizenship or-at

least a perinancht residence permit. Although he would be a defector

anyway, it could be that Oswald did not like the word defector

and the KGB decided not to call him à defector but, let us say, a

volunteer.

The Soviet Constitution states that the USSR grants the

right of anylun to all foreign citizens "uto are persecuted for

Bifeguarding the interests of the working class or who are porsecuted

for scientific activities, for national-liberation struggle. " (Article

129 of the USSR Constitution of 1936.)

V 10. You stated previously that "since about 1960, every Sovict ambassador

- can give a visa in throe to five days. Il do, what was so special for the

Soviet government that the ambassador would be personally involved in

issuing a visa to Oswald?

Note:

It is known that in 1957 the Soviet government adopted some measures

to improve travel for foroign touriats in the USSR.

They mostly

concerned currency eschange.

The 1957 regulations said nothing

about visas. Nosenko should be questioned about the 1957 decision

of the Soviet government to determine if he is not mistaking the 1957

decision with that of 1960.

• 11. You stated previously that since about 1960, every Soviet ambassador

can give visas in from throc to five days. The available information

published by the Sovicts unmistakenly states that a visa cannot be obtained

in less than seven days (in somo cases il takes five to seven days). Following

are excerpts from a book entitled Moscow, A Tourists Companion, published. =

in Moscow in 1969, anú from the magazine Sovict Life, May 1978, p. 59.

Soviet Life stateil that "visas are issued within 10 days of receipt of

application at a Soviet consulate."

2.. What do you know about Alcksandr Nikilorovich Aksenov?

Note:

(a) Aksenov was Deputy Chairman of the KGI of Belorussia

from 1959 to 1960. It is assumed that when Oswald arrived

in Minsk in January 1960, Aksenov was Deputy Chairman of

of the KGB and would definitely know about the Oswald case.

From 1960 to 1965, Aksenov was MVD Minister of Belorussia.

Therefore it would be under his direction that Oswald's passport

and the departure of Oswald and Marina from Minsk was

arranged. If Nosenko had access to Oswald's file, he must

know about Aksenov. From 1965 tu 1971, Aksenov was First

Secretary of the Vitclsk Obkom of CP Belorussia, and since

1971, Aksenov has been Second Secretary of the Central

Committee of the Belorussian CP. He has been a member of

the CC CPSU since 1976, and he is also a deputy to the USSR

Supreme Soviet. On May 9, 1978, Aksenov arrived in Columbia

¡le headed the Soviet delegation on the invitation of the Columbian

Communist Party.

13. Dirl you linow or know of Arkadiy Denisovich Rudak?

Note: Rudak was Deputy Chairman of the KGB during 1959 lo 1960 and

might have takch part in the Oswald case while. Oswald lived

in Minsk.

1.. Did you know or know of Major General Stepan Alekscyevich Smorodinskiy?

Note:

Smorodinskiy was Deputy Chairman of the KGB for Belorussia in

1962 and most likely know about the Oswald case.

His name

would most likely appear in the Oswald file.

J. 5.. Do you know It. General Vasiliy Ivanovich Petrov?

Note:

Pctrov was KGB Chairman for Belorussia from 1959 to 1973.

Thereforc, it would be his agency, the KGB, which would watch

Oswald in Minok. It is safe to assume that after the aysassination

of President Kennedy in 1963, Petrov, ae Chairman of the KGB

of Belorussia, would review the Oswald file and send it to Moscow.

He would also have been called to Moscow KGB heariquarters to

take part in the preparation of the spravka (summary) of the

Oswald file.

, 6. What do you know about Lit. General Aleksandr Ivanovich Perepelitsyn?

Note: Perepelitayn was Chairman of the KGB of the Belorussian Republic

from 1954 to 1959. Nosenko should know him or at least about him.

Nosenko should be asked if Perepelitsyn took any part in the

investigation of Oswald. (Perepelitsyn was Deputy Chairman of

the KGB of the USSR from 1959 to 1967. He died in Moscow.)

%. What part, if any, was played by General Sergey Grigoryevich Bannikov

in the Oswald case, especially after the assassination of President Kennedy?.

Note:

Bannikov was mentioned by Nosenko as one of the Deputy Chiefs of

the Second Chief Directorate and later on as one of the Deputy

Chairmen of the KGB of the USSR,

From 1968 to 1978, Bannikov

was Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Supreme Court.

V. Nosenko - Mikolayev

~ I. Can you explain why you went to England and Cuba under the name Nikolayev

and to Geneva using your true name, Nosenko? What would have happened

if some Englishman or English intelligence officer had met you in Geneva

in 1962 or in 1964 and grecied you in the presence of the other dolegates

15

## Page 113

with the words, "Oh, dir. Nihologer! How are you?

remember you.

You visited England with the sean of lovers."

11. Fromwere did you lours that the fill was ner informed abode Oswal's

presence in the USSR? Wouldn't the GRU officer in Intourist, whom you

mentioned carlier, have known about Oswald's presence in the USSR?

Did you ever hear that Oswald possibly had contact with the Soviet

intelligence during his service

in Japan?

2. You stated previously that there was no information that Oswald offered

to give information on the US Marine Corps. You did not read the file.

Then how do you know this to be the case? How do you know that the KGB

and GRU made no attempt to debrief Oswald about his service in the

US Marine Corps?

/ 3. Previously you mentioned one Coloncl Voloshin as an officer of the

Defense Ministry of the USSR. Can you provide any additional information

on this Voloshin? Could it be possible that he was a KGB officer instead

of in the Defense Ministry?

Note: (a) Accoïding to Epstein's book, one Pavel T. Voloshin was an

administrator at Patrice Lumumba Univergity and was a KGB

officer who accompanied a group of Russian dancers to Los Angeles

in 1959 at just about the same time that Oswald was making

weckend trips there to get his passport and possibly to make other

arrangements for his trip to Moscow. A few weeks after Oswald

decided to return to the United States, he received a letter from

Patrice Lumunba University Signed by Voloshin. (page 111)

(b) P.D. knew one KGB officer by the name of Voloshin (first

and middle name forgotten) who used to work in SMERSH

(military CI) and later in the late 1940's and beginning of the

1950's in S & T Department of the KGB.

VIL. Marina.

i. I. From where did you pick up the information that Marina was a "simple.

obyvatel" (a politically unaware person) and that she was not anti-Soviet

if you did not read the Oswald file?

16

## Page 114

14-00000

Lo You stated previously that Marina Man in Obstel! Do you lose any

comments on the following: "He knew each time you had i date. No

knew when you applied for youg marriate licenue...

We knew the date of

your werlding." Those were the words of the locomol recredy in

Mingl: when Marina was expelled from the Komsomol.

"3. Do you have any comments on Marina's statement when she said,

"Our governinent (Soviet) knows every move I make." She make this

comment shortly after her expulsion from the Konsomol.

• 4. Did you know that while in Minsk Marina belonged to a group of youths

who gathered together to listen to Voice of America and BBC? Would

that be enough for the KGB to have Marina in its card files? Is it

possible that Marina was the KGB agent reporting on them?

~ 5. You stated that if Marina had been recruited by the KGB, you would

know about it and it would be in the file. But you did not rend the file.

How then do you know that she was not recruited?

V 6. You said that among Marina's relatives thero was an officer of the Minsk

Militia, a Lt. Colonel. Do you have any comments on Marina's

revelation that her real father was a traitor and that he was shot? If

her father was a traitor and he was shot, would his name be in the KGB

card file? Would the name of Marina's mother be in the KGB card filo

as the wife of a traitor? Is it then possible that Marina's name also

would be in the KGB card file somewhere?

v 7. You stated previously that KGB had no interest in Marina prior to her

meeting Oswald and that the KGB investigated her only after Oswald

applied for permission to register marriage with Marina. How do you

know that? Did you read a special file on Marina? Marina revealed

lately that while she was living in Leningrad in 1958 or 1959, she met

a diplomat from Afghanistan who lured her to his hotel room and tried

to make love to her.. Do you think the KGB in Leningrad would know

about this diplomat and whom he lured to his hotel? Is it possible that

8. You slided previouly that you san Ornald's file only brielly and you

read only a sunmary. Then how would you know that Marina was novor

used by. the KGB? Did you personally make a direet check on whother or

not Mirina was a KGB informant?

9. In your previous testimony, you categorically denied that Marina was a

KGB-MVD agent or informor. Do you have any comments on Marina's

statement to Lifo Magazino that she was a "Soviet agent"? la thoro any

possibility that the KGB or MVD in Iclorussia or in Leningrad, whore

Marina had lived previously, had recruitted her as an agent or informor

and she continued to work for the KGB or the MVD until her departuro lo

the US? Did you have any information about the possibility that there was

another file in the KGB on Marina, a file for an agent or informer of the

KGB or MVD? ll such a file existed, it must be reflected in the Oswald

file, as well as in the surnmary which you read.

10. Did you hear or know that while in Leningrad Marina dated one Oleg

Tarugain, a student who had ambitions to enter tho Soviet diplomatic

service and who had some trouble with the authorities over a minor

political incident?

11. Was there any information in Oswald's file to show that after Oswald

married Marina, Marina was in the hospital for about five days?

v.. 12. What do you know about Marina's vacation in Kharkov shortly altor

she married Oswald?

Notc: She may have been in Moscow instead of Kharkov.

13. Did you know that while in Minsk Oswald was in the Fourth Clinical

Hospital for surgery on his adenoids?

(Oswald go: special attention from

the doctors.)

Notc: Marina's Aunt Valya, whose husband was an MVD Colonel, sent

eggs to Oswald while he was in the hospital.

case and the death of the American Predident in Geneva.

V4. Are you sure that there was no file on Oswald in the KGB before he.

arrived in the USSR? How do you know this? Did you personally check it?

¡ 5. You previously told American authorities that on the cover of Oswald's

file "there definitely was a 'klichka'. " But you said you did not remember

the klichka. Do you remember

whether the klichka was one word or two. As you did not read the file,

is it possible that it was an old file, opened a few years previously by

the First Chief Directorate or by the GRU?

of the USSK? Did you know that Kimma Shirokova visited Oswald In

Minsk?.. (Sue Epstein's book, page 124.)

Notc:

Oswald and Shirokova allegedly talked.about the possibility of

Ouwald sturlying at Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow. It

also should be noted that Shirokova visited Minsk shortly after

Oswald and his wile Marina docided to go to the United States.

%. How did you know that Officor Krupnow wrote a roqueat and opened a case

filo on Oswald? Did you see when Krupnov was writing it? Did you read

the request or hear about it from somebody? If you saw it, who approved

and sanctioned the roquest? If the KGB had no intorest in Oswald, then

why was a file opened?

10. Previoualy, on many occasions, you stated that the KGB had no interest

in Oswall, that he was not normal, and that he should leave the country.

Who among the KGB junior and senior officera made the decision that the

KGB had no interest in Oswald and that he should leave the country?

Describe in detail how you learned about it, from whon, from what

documents, and when.

not interest in Oswald because it was concerned only "with internal

matters." Isn't it true that the Second Chief Diroctorate is the intornal

counterintelligence organization and is responsiblo for foreigners who

enter the Soviet Union for any reason? Isn't it true that the tourist

departruent of the Second Chief Directorate is responsible for foreign

tourists such as Oswald?. Then why wasn't the Second Chief Directorate

interested in Oswald? Do you see any contradictions in your statement?

¡ 15. You stated that there was no attempt made to exploit Oswald for

propaganda purposes, such as Radio. Moscow broadcasts, TV, lectures,

etc. How do you know this? Do you have any comments on the following:

"On October 19 (1960), Lee (Oswald) was interviewed in his room at the

Hotel Berlin by a correspondent of Radio Moscow, Lev Setyayer, who

was ostensibly seeking his impressions as a tourist to use in propaganda

broadcasts overseas." Was there an officer in the KGB bj the name of

Setyayev? Was this interview organized by the KGB?

16. Do you have any information that Oswald might have been met in

Leningrad by Intourist and then made all the arrangements to fa to Moscow?

government office contacted the American Embassy and informed them

about Oswald's presence and the suicide attempt in Moscow?

v 22. Was the only reason that the Soviet Government did not inform the

American Embassy of Oswald's alleged suicide attempt that it was fearod

that he might try it again?

= 23. You

stated that there was no psychological assessment of Oswald by the

KGB nor by the hospital, and that there was no report of that nature.

You did not read the file. You read only summaries. Then how could

you know that there was no such report? How long was the summary--

100 pages?

Do you think the KCB monitored Oswald's conversations with tho

American Consulate officers or reccived reports from the American

Embassy (from Soviet employees there or Soviot agents there) about

Oswald's denunciation of US citizenship? Did the KGB instruct Oswald

to denounce hle American citizenship at the American Embassy before

no would be permitted to apply for Soviet citizenship?

" 26. You stated that the decision to give Oswald a stipend was mado by the

Red Cross.. Explain in detail how the Red Cross learned that Oswald

arrived in the USSR. Who informed the Red Cross that there was an

American who needed help? Why was it decided to give halp from the

Red Cross and not from the Trade Union? It is understandable that

Oswald might not have had enough money to start a now life in the USSR,

::

but he was not a poor leggar who needed to be turned to the Red Cross

instoad of the Trade Union. How did you find out that it was the Red Cross

that made the decision? According to available information, the Red

Cross does not assign money to anybody without the recommendation of

some other Soviet office. Which office was it: the KGD, MVD, the

officers, then this should te poted in the Oswald file which was sent to

about it, Then hon and hy was Dewalt

permitted lo hase a shotgun

which he kept in his apartntent in Minsk!

I 32. Do you have any information that while in the USSR, especially during

the joar 1960-1961, Oswald might have been visiting Cuba?

Note: Nosenko claimed that during Octuber-November 1960, he (Nosenko)

went to Cuba with a group of STATE LANNING COMMISSION'S

METALURGISTS headed by Ivan Strigen. He stayed in Cuba for

two months.

¿33. Do you have any comments on the statement made by Marina's uncle,

the MVD colonel: "I thought that Alik (Oswald) had not only given up

his American citizenship but had become a citizen of the USSR."

Note:

The question is that if an MVD colonel thought or could be fooled

by the KGB that Oswald was a Soviet citizen, it is possible that

he rcally was a citizen or that the KGB spread the rumor that he

waS.

V34. What do you know about Oswald's association with the Foreign Language

Institute in Minsk?

~ 35. To your knowledge, what KGB, GRU, and other intelligence schools

or training courses were in Belorussia during your work with the KGB?

j36.: What do you know about Oswald's application to attend Patrice Lumumba

University in Moscow? Why was Oswald denied entrance to the University?

Nute:

At that time, Colonel Yerzin, senior KGB officer, was a

deputy director of Patrice Lumumba University. (P. D.)

137. Did you know that Oswald took with him to the American Embassy

a letter from his friend Ziger in Minsk? Oswald left that letter at the

American Embassy.

i. 38. What do you know about the fact that Oswald, while in Minsk, received

American magazines and other publications? Do you think the KGB knew

about it?

39. Did you know that Oswald was helped to study Russian at the Minsk plant

by one of his co-workers and by one of his friends, Erich, and by a girl

al the Foreign Larguage Institute?

Do you know the names uf those people?

10. Whul do you kans abour Briald's issociation and friendship with foreign

students in the USSK in Minch and Moscows? Do the names blary laminey

Patter sonand Mrs. Roberto Camachd mean anything to you?

41. What do Oswald's files show about his contacts with Culen studenta in Minsk?

Note:

McMillan's book stilled that Oswild began do sook out the Cuban

students in Minsk, of shur there were 300 or so, to learn what

he could of Castro's revulution.

(See page 127.)

12. You stated previously that Oswald was a poor shot and that during his

hunting trips he did not kill anything. Was this information in the summary

you rcad? Do you have any comments on the fact that according to the

Warren Commission Report and the records of Oswald's service in the

Marines that he, Oswald, was a sharp shooter and marksman? Was

the "fact" that Oswald was a poor shot mentioned in the summary?

43. You stated previously (27 and 29 July 1964) that you saw the file on

Oswald only briefly and that the file was at the Seventh Department

for only 35-40 minutes. Then how do you know that nobody in the

Sovict Union, including KGB officers, ever sat down with Oswald and

got all the information on Oswald? Was everything that you told to*

US authorities about Oswald picked up from the summary during those

35-40 minutes?

44. Describe in detail how you and other officers of the Seventh Department

of the Second Chief Directoratc worked together on writing the firet

Spravka (summary).on Oswald. You also stated that this spravka

(the first one) was prepared in Moscow before the Oswald file from Minsk

arrived in Moscow. What material did you use in preparing the spravka?

Was there another file on Oswald in Moscow

or was it a control file

(Kontrolnoye delo)?

Note:

In important cases the real file is in the place where the subject

lives and works.

In this case,

the Oswald file was in Minsk.

Moscow would have an almost identical file on the subject for

control purposes and for instructions on how to handle and

develop the case.

This headquarters file is called the Control

File.

This file exists on the person sho is already an agent or

who is under development of training.

officerg

redosegos and Molicyer of the first Department of tis Second:

Chief Directorare look the file and you nerer sill again. Because the

file mies in your department only 20-30 minutes (in other places Nosenko

said 35-10 minutes), the S praka could not be wrilton in such a short

tinc, and because the file wis taken away to the higher authorities of

the Second Chief Directorale and to the KGB chairman, you had no chance

to see the second Spritia. Then again the question is which summary

did you read--the second or the first or both? Describe in detail how

long the summary was, what was in it, and how long it took for you to

rcad-it.-Did-you-make any notes -from the summary in case later on you

had to report the "facts" to US intelligence?

46. What do you know about Oswald's visit (from Minak) to the American

Embassy in Moscow on July 8; 1961?

Notc:

Oswald flew from Minsk to Moscow allegedly without permission

from the Soviet authority.

What do you know about Marina's visit to Moscow on July 10, 1961?

What part did the KGB play in the arrangements of Marina's visit to

the American Embassy in Moscow without checking her papers and

without stopping her at the gates.

In what hotel in Moscow did Oswald

and Marina stay at that time?

147. You stated previously that the First Chiel Directorate provided no

information about Oswald before Oswald went to Mexico. What

information did the First Chief Directorate give to the Second Chief

Directorate before he went to Mexico? Did you read this information?

If you did not personally read it, then how did you learn the contents of

the First Chief Directorate information?

Who from the First Chief

MEMORANDUM FOR: :

SUBJECT:

Diractor of Security

Parole Status of Dofectors

1. On 2 April 1964 we had a discussion with the Dapartment.

of Justice on the status of aliens whose inspection by I&NS is defarred

upon arrival at our request and who are then paroled to this Agency.

It was tho position of the Department of Justica that we were responsible

for taking any action necessary to carsy out the torms of the parole.

2. As you know, a basic parole agreement was executed by the

Attorney General and the DCI on 10 February 1955. Aftor setting up

conditions for authorizing parole in any one case, the agreement states:

"After parole of such aliens, the Central Intelligenco Ajency will assume

responsibility for care, supervision and control of a kind and degree it

belioves consistent with the internal jecurity neads of the Unitad Scatoo

during continuance of their parole starus. "' This means that the

responsible Agency officials must take the minimum action necessary

, to protect the internal security needs of the United States. The word

"minimum' is not necessarily a limitation. It meroly means that good

judgment must be uoed as to what kind and degroo of action is necessary.

3. The agreement further provides that upon completion of the

parolee's intelligence or operational purposes in the United States or if

interaal security reasons so require, the alien will be removed from

this country through arrangements made by the Agency and, in such

case, the Agency will inform the Service in advance of each proposed

departure.

Effective immediately or as soon as practicable, the following

procedures will apply with regard to the handling of the

Subject:

(1)

Subject will receive a regular diet with modest regulated

portions. He is to have no dessert or "trimmings,"

but may have the necessary silverware with which tö

eat properly. (CAUTION--Extreme care should be

exorcised with regard to controlling the silverware,

and it was suggested that at least two of the guards

be required to count the silverware in and out; that

the silverware be placed on the tray in a manner

where it could be observed before the guards enter

the room, etc. )

(2) Arraugements are to be made for the installation of

adequate air-conditioning equipment to insure that a

comfortable temperature is maintained. (It is under-

stood that there is quite a bit of equipment available

through Logistics channels.)

(3)

Subject is to receive a bath; change of underwear;

change of uniform; and a change of linen for his bed.

SWORET

(1) Subject is to receive a haircut, the shorter the better.

• (5) Subject is to receive one cigarette on 12 May 1964.

(NOTE--These changes with regard to the bath, haircut,

cigarette are not to be considered as something to be..

done on a regular: schedule.' We will await specific

¿ instructions from SR Division as to when these items

are to be accomplished in the future.)

22702

(6)

Effective immediately, Di. Bohrer will visit the

Subject only on Tuesday each week.

(7) In addition to the above, it ratist be emphasized that

our attitude toward the Subject will remain precisely

the same, and our security procedures, including

searches,

wil' continue to be at maximum control.

3. It was further ascertained that we will have custody of

the Subject until at least July.. It was suggested that perhaps we may

wish to explore some modifications in the assignment of personnel

or schedule of assignments. In addition, the Acting Chief, Support

Branch has suggested that immediate consideration be given to

devising necessary procedures to be followed in the event of an

emergency involving loss of control of the Subject. This should

be discussed immediately with the responsible DFO supervisors

and specific procedures devised, and all guards properly informed

as to their responsibilities in this matter.

in regard to this question.

responsible office

for the confinement of Nosenko until late

Octobor 1967 when total responsibility was transferred to the

Office of Security by the deI.

It is presumed that the DCl was

Answer:

Nosenko is currently employed at his personally owned

1973, Nosenko was compensated by mutual agrecment for salary

not received during the 1 April 1904 to 1 March 1909.

SUBJECT

: The Nosenko Case

Attached please find i summary of a document written in

to the Cieneral Counsel outlining the Nosenko case and

explaining to him actions which had been taken with regard to

As noted in the first paragraph, in October 1967

Nosenko took up residence in the Wishington area and wis

idvised that,

should he wish to leave the apartment for any

location whatsoover,

he was free to so do.

In other words,

essentially a totally free man.

That he chose not to flee in any

way may be indicative of his

attitude toward the manner in which he was handled prior to

October 1967.

While one can criticize the fact that Nosenko was kept

incommunicado for approximately three ycars, and therefore

presumably denied full civil rights, the attached document

does indicate, ve believe,

of a dilemna

in this regard.

There were logitimate douvts

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO

In early or mid-1907, the Agency General Counsel was

provided a summary of the Nosenko case.

The negorandum

sought

an advisory opinion from

the General Counsel on the

Agency's legal basis for its handling of losenko through

that date and on the legal aspects on the eventual dispost-

tion of Nosenko. Shortly subscquent to this memorandum to

the General Counsel, Josenko took up residence in October 1967

in an apartment in the Washington area and was reminded that

should he wish, he could travel frecly

anywhere at anytine.

He gradually created a new life for himself in the United

States and has indicated on several occasions that he holds

207.5

no ill feeling about his handling by the Agency at anytime.

Background

Nosenko voluntarily established contact with CIA repre-

sentatives in Genevi in 1962. He identified hisself as a

staff officer of the KGB's internal security directorate and

offered

to

sell counterintelligence information. This offer

was accepted and he wis recruited as an agent in place and

again in January 1961 as the security officer for

CIA handlers he dofected on 4 February 1964 and was secretly

taken to Frankfurt, Germany, crossing the Swiss-German border..-

on the night

of 1/5 February with alias U.S. Army identity

documents.

In Geneva and again upon arrival in Frankfurt,

Nosenko wrote

out

an asylum request, requesting political

asylum from

the U.S. Government.

Because serious doubts about Nosenko's bona fides had

arison on the bisis of the information he had provided both

in 1962 and in the meetings in Geneva in 1964, it was orig-

inally planned to do a detailed bona fides dobriefing and

assessment in Germany before making any decision about moving

Nosenko to the United States. However, unprecedented action

by the Soviet Government in respect to the defection of one

of its citizens forced a change of plans. On 9 February,

unidentified Soviet sources in Geneva leaked the news to the

press that Nosenio, described as an "expert attached to the

Soviet Delegation to the Disarmament Conference' had dis-

appeared, and that it was presuned that he had defected.

Because of mounting pressure from the press, which included

much speculation that Nosenko was a high level scientist or

disarmament expert, it was decided that the State Department

would make a brief announcement acknowledging Nosenko's at"

request for asylum in. the U.S. and identifying him

as a

member of the KGB. This was done on 10 February. On I1 Feb-

ruary, the Sovict Government delivered a note to the American

Embassy in Moscow asking how Nosenko left Switzerland and

requesting an immediate interview with

him and his

relcase.

On 12 February, Soviet Ambassador to the Disarmament Confer-

ence TSARAPKIN held a press conference in Geneva in which he

accused the Swiss Government of failure to cooperate in

locating Nosenko. Although the Swiss categorically rejected

these charges, the American Ambassador to Switzerland recom-

mended that Swiss authorities be allowed to interview Nosenko.:

to convince themselves that Nosenko had left Switzerland of

his own free will.

On 12 February 1964, on the instructions of the Director,

Nosenko was brought to the United States. He travelled by

commercial air, again using

alias

U.S. Army identification,

and was admitted to the country. at New York City (in true

name) on parole under the provisions of Section 212 (d) (5)

of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

On 13 February, representatives

of the Swiss and Sovict

desired

Moscow, Soviet Foreign Minister GROMYKO called in Ambassador

KOHLER and protestéd "impermissable activities" on the part

of the U.S. in Nosenio's case. Sovict press spokesmen took

an even harder line to lestern correspondents, and accused

the U.S. of kidnapping dosenko. On the afternoon of l4 Sep-

tember, at two separate interviers, he spoke first to swiss

Embassy and then

to Soviet Embassy representatives..dt

these intervicws, which were also attended by State Department

and INS officials, Nosenko confirmed that he left Switzerland

of his own free will to seek asylum in the U.S. In addition,

he replied

to questions of the Soviet Embassy representative

to the effect that he was renouncing his Soviet.eitisonship..ü

On the evening of 14 February, the V.S. State Department made

a brief formal reply to the soviet

protest, then

issued a

brief statement to the press noting that the interviews had

been held and that l'osento had contirmed his desire to remain

in this country.

out for evening and weck-end excursions, Nosenko was at all

times accompanied by O/S personnel. In addition, he took a..

two-weck vacation to lawaii, again accompanied by cusc offi-

cors and socurity guards. Evidence continued to moiint that

he was il KGB plant, and at the same time it becano obvious

that it would be impossible to proccoy further to resolve

the many suspicious points and contradictions that had arisen

without changing the conditions in which he was being held.

Nosenko was growing increasingly uncooperative, especially

when sensitive areas were touched upon, and constantly pressed

for the legalization of his status in the U.S. and the issuance

of an alien registration card. At the same time, Nosenko's

heavy drinking and other unruly personal habits were causing

increasing difficulties to the security personnel charged se

with

keeping him under control and out of trouble at all times in

accordance with Agency local responsibility. It was clear

that it was only a matter of time before he created a public.

in a position to communi-

cate with the KoB since physical control could

not

be absolute.

On 4 April 1964, Nosenko voluntarily underwent a polygraph

examination. The results of this examination indicated deception

his penetration of the Agency and its operations. It was

decided, therofore, that the physical circumstances of Nosenko's

stay in this country would have to be drastically changed if

the diency were to carry out

its counterintelligence responsi

bilitias ind idhere to the torms of the parole agreement. As

a result, he was moved to quirtors where his movements could

be more casily controlled, and his outing privileges vere

suspended pending resolution of bona fides.

It is worth noting that had we not taken the above action

to have the time to analyse and resolve this case, ind to

plan and exccute appropriate counterneasures, it vas essential

that

lic attcupt to keep the doB fron learning of our awareness

of Nosenko's true status.

Consequently, detailed knowledge

of the depth and scope of our suspicions about Nosenko, and..

the implications thercof, has restricted to a very few people

in the Agency and the intelligence community. Nonetheless,

we did advise key policy echelons and principals in the intel-

• ligence community, even though this carried the incritable

risk of leakage.

Soviet Inspired Inguirics

In 1966 there were several indications that the soviets

were making a serious effort

to find out what happened to

Nosenko and to force him to the surface. The most blatant

and unusual of these was the

approach by a Soviet journalist,

Yuriy KOROLEV (a known KGB agent), to the Frerch magazine i

Paris Match with an offer to provide photographs and

materials

for an exclusive story of losenko and his family. licording

to korolev, Nosenko's wife was considering

an

approach

to an

international juridicial organization

in an effort to obtain

compensation from losenko for damages

caused by his abandon-

ment of her and her children.. In responding to this approach

we quoted a statement, purporting to be fron josenko himself,

"..

SECRET

---

## Page 183

to the effect that Nosenko considers

this approach

to repre-

sent blatant and cruel manipulation

of his fanily by the KGB

and that he will not lend himself to

the

schene by agrecing

to an interview or in any other way.

Nosenio's Status

To recapitulate, Nosenko entered the United States on

12 February 1964 on parole to the Agency under the provisions

of Section 212 (d) (5) of the Immigration and 'ationality

Act.

Parole responsibility is delegated to the Agency by

the Attorney General under the terms of an agreement executed

by the Attorney General and the Fil on 10 February 1955,

which

states:

"After parole of such aliens, the Central Intel-

ligence Agency will assume responsibility for

care, supervison and control of a kind and

degree it believes consistent with the internal.

security needs of the United

States during con-

tinuance of their parole status."

In accordance with our understanding of this agreement, and

because we had reason to believe that josenko was a conscious

and willing agent of a hostile intelligence service, we

ensured that he was under our direct observation and control

at all times from the moment of his arrival in the United

SECRET

States. From 12 february to & April 1904 it wis possible to

keep dosendo it a location where he could enjoy a certain

amount of movement and of contact with the outside world.

Aftor i April 1964, for reasons explained above, it was

necessary to leep him incommunicado at a location which is

known to no one outside of the dyency land to very few within

it). Authorisation for Nosenko to remain in this country

under the Special Agrcement Procedures was periodically

extended by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

Although his freedon of movement had been severely

restricted, Nosenko was not maltreated and he made no com-

plaint about his treatment. On the contrary, we had

several

written statements from him in which he

stated that our

handling of him was justified and even beneficial.

Disposal

From

the time that Nosenko was brought to this country

we thought about the possibility of his eventual deportation

as a contingency measure.

In carly 1964, we thought that it a

might be possible to mitigate the political and propaganda

drawbachs of a forced deportation by announcing that Nosenko

has confessed his true KGB role. With the passage of time,

however, and in rich of our much firmer conclusions about his

real role and mission

and our clearer understanding of what

13

SECRET

---

## Page 185

14-00000

SECRET

this implied, it was apparent that great practical problems

stood in the wily of his doportition to cither the USSR or a

third country.

USSR: Nosenko has categorically stated on numerous:

occasions that he will never contemplate return to the USSR,

and, although we suspect that he might secretly welcome such

is move, we would expect him

to ict out his part to the end

with loud protests.

that he was being shipped to his death,

etc.

when the possibility of expulsion was discussed with

Departnent of State officials in 1904, both the Secretary of

State and Anbassador Thompson expressed their concern for

the adverse effect this might have on other potential defec-

tors. Forcible repatriation of political refugees is against

long established U.S. policy, and would be certain to arouse

violent reaction from ethnic minority groups in the United

States.

Under these circumstances an alleged "confession"

by roscnko would have come under very close scrutiny, and

right have backfired very badly, Another point that had to

be considered was the possibility that the Soviets, again

playing their

part, might have refused

to accept Nosenko on

the grounds that he has renounced his Soviet citizenship.

Third country: Although we believed it likely that

Nosenko would accode to deportation to a third country,

-.

there is certainly no country in the free world on which we

could conceivably have unloaded Nosenio hithout

first inform-

ing them of his true status. Even if we considered this a

desirable objective, it seemed certain that the Department

of State would veto such a plece of intergovernmental duplic-

it! on the basis of the political rists involved.

1. Forwarded herewith is a 31 Dacember 1971 memorandum

from the Arting Director of Security on subject activities. The

material represents responses lo questions posed by your office.

Obviously, the next phase of the investigation will require more

detailed reviews of each activity.

2. Questions that occur to us in reading the attached, are:

PARAGON

We should spell out what is meant by the

statement that the FBi "deferred further coveragé

to the Office of Security," how it was expressed and

what form it took.

The taping of two conversations does not seem

to constitute "electronic surveillance" in the usual

sense. It certainly is not trespatory surveillance.

A little more detail on the equipment will be wanted.

10222255nn

NOSENKO

We will go to the DDO for any record of DCI

knowledge, and report such information as we get.

AFLADLE

We will want to verify DDCI's approval of entry.

CELOTEX I

We will want more delail on the actual

This is responsive to the DCI's request for

newspaper articles that led to the surveillance.

CELOTEX II

Questions similar to CELOTEX I.

We may want actual copies of newspaper

stories for display, in addition to memos, should

DCI wish to use it.

MOCKINGBIRD

No recorded (in CLA) formal approval by

Attorney Gencral. It may be that Justice will

whether the following case is identical to the referenced

case on page 170 of the Commission Report, but the facts

appear to be quite sinilar.

Information developed by this Office of possible in-

an ex-ClA employee, and one Eduard Oun, an Estonian defector.

S.

Torpats was born in 1898 in Estonia, and became a

naturalized U.S. citizen in 1926.

Torpats was employed by

CIA in February 1949 and was terminated 30 January 1961. . The

Torpats was later terminated in accordince with the

authority granted the DCI under Section 102(C) of

Security Act of 1947, as ammended, effective 30 January 1961.

Later in 1961, Torpats filed suit

against the DCI contesting

his dismissal, and the U.S. District Court for the District of

Columbia granted the government's motion for summary judgment

against Torpats.

Torpats appealed the decision, and the U.s.

that Torpats' termination was legal.
