Mrs. Knohl also stated that she talked to Jay Knohl on

Writer had a discussion with Piccerelli and it was learned that
up until a few weeks ago he was a bouncer at Fran O'Brians
Anthony House. Piccerelli stated that he knew Richie McCaleb,
McGowan, Joe Nesline, Becky Sutton; and without any prompting
Charlie Tourine. Piccerelli stated that the aforementioned

as reported in a media article - The Washingtonian.
When I inquired of Piccerelli what he was presently doing, he
stated that in two weeks he and two partners were going to
open a bar in Detroit called "The Three of Us". When I
remarked that Joseph Zerelli might be around, Piccerelli
stated that Joe was too old and his brothers, Tony (Anthony),
and another name, were in jail. Writer commented that some
of Zerelli's family appeared to be moving to New York and he
replied, yeah, they all married into the New York families.

as the numbers she possessed were relative to lot and number
of pairs of pants she boxed in a garmet house where she worked.
Mrs. Knohl further stated that she brought her down from
Brooklyn and got her an apartment in Rockville. Maryland
telephone directory lists one Jennie Saviano, 199 Rollins Ave.,
Rockville, Md., 770-6784; and it is noted that she is the only
Saviano in the book.
At approximately 1930 hours David P. Knohl called writer,
having returned home; however he could not furnish any infor-
mation. Knohl did say that this was a double shock for Mr.
Piccerelli as he burried his wife two weeks ago.

Brokers Wholesale, Inc., rear of 5102 Georgia Avenue, N.W.,
Washington, D.C. (202) 723-4100 and (202) 291-6400.
Writer contacted MSP Trooper Burns reference the three classical
cars reported stolen by CARRAFA on 07-22-76 to 07-23-76, and
he stated that CARRAFA refused a polygraph three times; and
CARRAFA told him that the reason was that he was into other
things. Burns feels that the theft of these vehicles was
staged by CARRAFA as he showed Burns one point of entry and
a United States Fidelity & Guarantee Insurance Adjustor another
point of entry. Burns also related that there were no tire
marks in the dirt road that led to Gino's Classical Car's
garage. USF & G adjustor is one Sharon Kohler, (301) 547-3569.
Burns noted that a vacationing Pennsylvania police officer, on
07-21-76, two days before the theft, observed a blue GMC Tractor
with a yellow trailer operated by two negro males at the Union
76 Truck Stop in Colesville, Pa. The truck was being followed
by a negro male in a maroon Rolls Royce. The yellow trailer
was loaded with six classical cars, a white over black Cadillac,
a Mercedes, what appeared to be a Rolls Royce but could have
been the Packard and three other cars.
Lastly, Burns related that one Investigator Jones, Maryland
Motor Vehicle Administration, assisted CARRAFA in going into
business. Burns and Hones inspected Gino's numerous times and
found violations such as un-notarized titles, but Jones took no
enforcement action.
