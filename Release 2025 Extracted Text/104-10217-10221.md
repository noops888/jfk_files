To explain Katzenbach's

telephone calls to his home (K. identified ninself to S/l's

This will help

explain some of his inone to his wife, but will not be used

with others.

The above skeletal dover will hosefully be reinforced in

for his many contacts there.

His visits to Grippa and Andersson

on his way to Algiers will also help to fill out his ostensible

sources of income, though s/t has agreed not to overplay this

angle.

In other words, he will not pretend that these two have

given

him any funds, but if others want to nake the assumption,

so much the better.

On 1 and 2 June, Tiffany expounded at some length on the

Importance of S/l trying to get an Opposition (Soviet, Cuban,

Igerian or ChiCon) sponsor for any further cover

to an ICFLUITOR exanination and his simpature on a Secrecy Agreement

on 2 Juno, TIffany introduced him to Podigast, undor the allas

"Pawl weller" on the norning of 3 June. It was explained that Rodigast

volid serve as S/l point of contact in the future. S/l and Rodigast

Hit 1t alf woll fran the outset, the laiter's laouledge of Paris and

Tanglers-based Averican beatniks and other Intollectuals serving biz

neeting S/l at least twice during the sunner outside hlgiers. Final

agreesent on a nid July nesting will be sade in Paris to conforn to a portal

pattera by s/1 and

anax arzangerents which S/1 succeeds in developing in Lausanne and

Paris. In tia process of discussing ca munications Rodigast is also

Rodigast will instruct s/l in the use of Sil in Paris. Hopefully,

Rodigast will be able to spend a day of two with S/1 in Paris, even

though we vant S/1 to gei to Alglers as soon as possible.

5o Financial Arrangements. After discussing all possible alternatives,

"It was decided that the nost secure arrangenent kould be to give S/1

da advance of the equivalent of $200 for his-travel Londor-Brussels-

Izusanne- Paris and per dies and jis an advance of the equivalent of

$600 for his JaDe BalaTy plus non-accountable expenses. These advarces

were sade and signed for on 3 Juno. One status important reason for

the large cash advance was the fact that S/l teenarently was completely

broke, and he had to pake sone funds availab la to his wife to seet

expenses and pay alf a 65 pound Sterling debt to his brother-in-laits befare

leaving on his trip. (5/1 will explain the funds as the last of the

advances and payments for articles by Ercounter and other publications.)

that this was necessary to head off the security and morale problens

6. In the course of bls Indtlal talk with S/), Rodigast pursued the

matter of the allegations rade at various tines in the past to the

effect that S/i1s or vas à "CIA agent"" or "FBI agent, S/a explained

volto an apology to Farrington, confessing to the forgery.

D. S/1 believes that jacques Vergès obtained the

told the cubans a tall tale which ha hopes they believed (anong those

ho spoke to kas Roa): he said that during the French drive against tibe

signing prouisent names to then, and that the Harrington forgery vas

bad as Its or1gln their anger that Verges had given S/1 a job that

should have gons to an Englishman (or tonan); they felt that Africa

was a probies of the British CP; and so they spread the story about sa.

•. Rodigast recalled that hillian Gardner Saith had

once vritten a letter to the Paris Herald Tribune denying that &

pro-Castro lottor which appeared several days earlier signed i G Srith

•had been sent by him. At the time (perhaps 18 nonths ago) Sulth told

Rodigast, who questioned him on the natter, "Oh, that's an old story. "

Without indicating that he knew Suith, Rodigast raised the question

of Suith's Berald Iribune letter to S/1, who said he had never seen 1t

or heard of it before.

1. Rodigast gave S/l the recent clipping from Le Mande

which indicated that Patricia MacGonan's husband or lovar Carlos Lansa

had been arrested by the Algerians in connection with the investigation

of the Delgado killing. Rodigast warned S/I that we did not know whether

& charze rould be nade, or indeed whether Lansa had already been released

along with others arrested at the sare time. Nevertheless S/1 thought

the clipping would be useful to show to those not terribly fantliar

with the details, but who sight be favorably influenced by a repart

showing that the people who denounced 5/1 an a "CIA agent" bad also

sent Dalgado to his death.

of the undesirable nature of his activities; the swiss told Nils

he would be allaged to stay. Following his departure on what s/1

JAGUAR Report on STEBONY 1

ACTION REQUIRED- REFERENCES

JAGUAR had nado the following available to us, in responso to our

roquest for infornation on a continuing basin relating to STEBONY/ 18

"In mid-kay STEBONY/1 was still trying to arrango a viait to

Algiers this sunner

on the strength of help ho has received

fron 'sone conrades".

"Robert WILLIANS in Havana has given STEBONY/ 1 the impression

that ho nay visit Algiers as a member of a liban dologation.

Also, STEBONY/1 understands that Willian WithY, mao has coen in

Hanoi, will be going to Algiers.

STEBONY/1 arpoots to meet a

sunber of his frienda there and his sain reason for wishing to

nake this trip is to disouss his problems, paat and present,

with these friends and other interested parties. He hopes to

alear up doubts and uncertaintion and, in this context, he has

commented that one of the reasons for much of the hostility show

to hin has been the reluotance of others to involve themselves

in the differences which arose between himself and Jaoques VERGES

booguso the latter vas olearly more influential and more iuportant

than STEBONY/ 1.

"STEBONY/1 had heard that VERGES was still insisting that

STEBONY/1 wes & KUBARK agent and that File ANDERSCN and Jacques

TRIPPA were 'ODYCKE double agenta'.

GRIPPA, who is leader of the

pro-Chinese Conmniet group in Belgiun, is planning to bring up

toriate his book "Karxisn-Leninian or Revisionism', publissed two

years ago, by adding a new chapter. STAbONY/l is looking into the

positillty of its publication in the JK Or PBPRIME and,

in this

context, he considers "Lonthly Revier' to be the only possible

nediun although Leo HuBErMar, one of the publication's editors,

1s not enthusiastic about the idea.!

1o Areas of Knovledgeabllity. A reading of the transcription of

Gibson's taped debriefing clearly underlines KATAJIBACH's EBBEBEMent

that Gibson possesses an encyclopedic knowledge of personalities and

Broups ranging from Zanzibar to the U.S. It 18 not always clear from

the debrieling to shat extent libson enjoys elther a first-hand or-

Ledge or even a friendly relationsbip vita specific individuals or

втонов.

Hoat is clear is that Gibson noves in & willeu on which ve

presently have very l1ttle coverage; that he 1s already a member of

this 200se15 defined society and thus can be presumed capable of de-

veloping nen contacts or strengthening old ones by means of present

sid past associations.

It 1s difficalt to categorize or devine what this allieu 18.

It Is not the vorld of commist parties - although it contains a pre-

ponderance of communists; and 1t does not seen to be a society walch

necessarily revolves about the Chinese. The primary comm denouira-

tor covering sost of the personalities involved In GibBon's reporting

Is some association with the revolütionary noverent 1n AtrICa -- part1-

cularly Algerla. A secondary seans of characterizlag these contacto 1a

a correlation vith the radical French and Belgden left which lles out

side such organized party structures as the PSU, PCF, BCP. (His sain

aCCess to Chinese communists runs through Jacques GRIPPA 1n Belgium and

NIlS ANDERSSON In Switzerland with rhom he clalms to be on good teras at

the present time.) Another common thread, alnost as general, 1s assa

elation with Brotalylan, although the neaniag or clarlfication of this

political description i8 never spelled out. In general, Gibson displays

& good and often personal movledge of target areas which sight be

lestiot circles 1n Barope.

2. Access and Limitations on Access." There appareatly has been

circulated a charge that Gibson 1s a CIA agent.

(Inis 1s reflected 1n

his 201 as dating from his days uith the FPCC.) In dealing with this

question, however, KATZBIBACE cites Gibson's own belles that he 18 still

able to operate in the circles which vould be of interest to us. It 18,

at course, difficult to tell Iron his debriefing the extent and serious-

Dess of this charge against GloBon, Insofar as 1t affects his bons fides.

It does seen that in Gibson's Illleu, gosaiD, personal attacks, muddled

loyalties and an aura of conspiratorial confusion are everyday facto of

Iife and that personal contact and effectiveness in bullding rapport

would far outweigh such critfeal personal charges - wbich, Indeed, pro

bably circulate about sost people. At the present time, for reasons not

entirely clear, Gibson feels that he would be unveloone and restricted

vere he to visit Ghans, and, In fact, would not like to make such a

trip. He has indicated, on the other hand, that he has friends in Al-

geria and believes he could probably get some klad of job there or at

Least find a receptive and generally friendly reception. He also appeara

to have sose contact and standing with the Indonesian government, since

he clains their london Embassy offered hin employment.

It 1s not know

to uhat extent he sight be able to parley such a contact into emoloyment

1n Djakarta oI some fOrm of official association in Europe, although

these questions could be explored further. The termination of his asso-

ciation vith Revolution and Verges vould not, according to his account of

1t, discredit him in the eyes of those who might have been partisens of

the 1deologdcal line walch this nagazine purveyed. According to bis

account, Verges 18 not in good standing with the pro-Chinese like Grippe

or even the Chinese, and that his (Gibson's) quarrel with Verges over

upaid salary 18 vell knows.

waile this may not be unbiased, It 18

apparently true that be has lodged a claim for payment against Verges,

and thus 1s not in the position of having been expelled fron Revolution

for Ideologacal deviation. As Gibson secounts 1t, 1t 18 Verges, not be,

so 1s discredited.

30

Motivation and Readiness to Cooperate. The debriefing reflects

betveen the lines what KATZENBACH judges in his covering dispatch to be

a readiness to collect information for us howlag that ve are an offictal

agency and probably suspecting that ve are KUBARk. His professed soti-

vation 1s monetary, and frankly so, although e certals degree of fatigue

vita his past profession of ideological punditry 18 discernable.

there

are also & number of Indications that Gibson would I1ke to rebabilitate

hinals lest be be forced to nake his living for an Indefinite perfod of

time in an enviromant that be finds both unpleasant and materially un-

renarding. It is not possible, of course, to make an intelligent judge-

mnt from this debriefing on the firmess and consistency with which be

unusual area of uncertainty vith & new sgent and one vhich a proba

tlonary period should dispel. (It should be noted that in one instance,

he volunteered a name as an operational lead - 1.e., as someone uhom ve

night find it northwhile to look up.

He also provided hat 1s apparently

an accommodation address in Bogota for Chinese sallings.)

4. Long-Range Usefulness and Initial Targetting. Gibson's long-

range usefulness, of course, would depend not only on his effectiveness

and dependability, but on the opportunities vhich vill emerge and take

shape 88 8 result of his 1n1t1al activity. As a general proposition, be

can be vieved as an intelligence collection asset targetted at radical

independence novements, pro-chinese personalities and organizations,

and official persozalities 1n newly energed countries, primarily in

AtTica. Specifically, these targets would Include:

The best Ikely assigment to fulfill these requirements 1s that of a

journaliat, preferably operating prom Europe, capable of credible travel

1n Europe, Africa and even Asla, with some associations which will pre-

sErVe his bone fides vith target Afro-Asian crouço.

Assuming the doral-

opment of adequate cover, he could then spend an initial period this

spring and summer In Algeria to cover the Second Bandung Conference

(29 June) and the World Youth Pestival (28 July). (Other international

conference, including followp AAPSO meetings to the Ghans Congress 1n

MaY, an ATTO-ABIan Jounalists Conference or further PAJU meetings can-

not be anticipated as targets at present either because of Indefinita,

planning or because of unsuitable location. There 1s little doubt, bor-

ever, that additional nestings will take place in Alglers and Atrica

bringdng together Interesting target personalities from Africa and Asia

uhom Gibson might attempt to report on.) In addition to his contrlbu-

than in coverage of these meetings he night also attempt to develop bis

access and contact anong the official Algerian coumunity at least vita

the value of developing biographical and operational support data.

1. Ref forwarded the tapes and a rough transoription of the debriefing

session with Subjeot, which were held on February 17,

19, 19, 23, 1965.

2.

In accordance with Feadquarters' instructions, these meetings

were kept on a don't-call-g-se'll-call-jou basis - in laot GIBSON usa given

no seans for calling us.

Also in accordande with leadquartera' instruations,

did not pay GIBSON at & constant rate of over $100 per hour.

The first

(9300) payment to GIRSON was in laot more than ne had originally intendad to

give big as a "binder", but in light of the imminense of his trip to Pirope

wi advanced him that sun to bely him to meet his expenses.

This nioely

ooinoided with our om time table, since the time he vas gone - some three

vooks - should have provided adequate time for the initial tape to be

revieved and for requirements to be prepared and pouoted to the fiold. At

any rato, the total

sun given to GIBSOl, for hig time and e shot at hia

nailing list, nas 8700.

3. ICHARVEST may vell feel that it has been done out of 8700 in co

funde.

The information obtained on Chicon contacts of GIBSON, or on any

* Chicons at all, nas slight.

GIBSCH claims not to have had nore than very

little contaot

with there,

and not to know too much about then.

Unless there

1s hard into to the contrary, we are inclined to believe that GIBSON vas

telling pretty much the truth in this resject, as indeed seema to bave been

the oase almost all of the time.

While this is a bit of a disappointment,

in a ray, and seems to lessen the immediaoy of LOYARViST interost, 1t

certainiy does not appear to elininate GIBSOK's potential worth.

40

The London Station continues to feel that GIBSON has considerable

potential as a source of positive inteiligence on a ride range of targets -

taigets that appear to be only lightly covered otherwise, although we are

not alvays able to judge this. A revier of this debriefing can only cause

GIBSOr and security, to this coints GIBSON has net only

mysell, under alias, and under the infression that I vas here temporarily.

this ides vas apparently made to stiok, throughout our conversations.

he would propose that, if GISSON be recruitsd in faut, he be handied in

allas and at a good, safe diatance - nore than arm's length.

ouffiolent operational testing had been carried.out, ve rould suggest

that he not have a "resident oase officer" anywhere - 1.e, neither

here nor in Algiara.

Control of GIPSON is partly exercised by the

dooumento we have received from him (receipts, meno of understanding)

plus the voluninous tayed comments.

These,

are sufficient to do him considereblo professional and forsonal danago

noto partioularly that his vife, acoording to hin, nould not approve of

any of our contaots,

and this appers to bo quite meaningíul to hiu.

Financial control rould be a continuing laotor.

we feel that GIBSON vould feel considerable

unusually bigh degreela.e., KUBARK) rescied hin from hig present and

gratitudo to whoever

difficult position,

"foreiving all", and providine hin with a measure of

respectabilty (at least in bis own eyes) that he has henceforth been, …i"

unablo to achieve and raintain.

In sum, ve feel that a reasonably

strong combination of control factora exist, and can be continued for

as long an GIBSON vould be properly handled.

15.

Wa should also like to comment on the reliability of GIBSON's

comments in the course of our meetings to date.

He have found hin to

bo thoroughly consistent in his consents and attitudes throughout.

we found no indication of dollberato deception or serioue attenpts to

niBlead.

He may hivo provided some erroneous materials, or he ray have

erroneously interpreted

some events; but his comments and attitudes

remained suffioiently consistent to lead us to believe that he vas

being reasonably honest all the ray.

He played down sone itens, no

doubt, and played up othere.

In the course

of a debriefing suon as this

was there seened little or no point in pushing hard at such points

tesides, his knowledge of the areas covered so fax outdistanood

nine

that I could not lavo attenpted to probe or pin hin down on spedifice.

(Note also bis tendenay to nake corrections in the debriefing questionnaire,

as when the: wrong nane vould appoar for a politioel group in Saitserland.)

16. GIBSON's present status is that he la out of vork, in debt, and

althout any prospects of reasonable employment in the near future.

in somewhat occupied with an article he is writing for Encounter;

this

will probably keep his frcu taking another job for the next fow weeks.

Beyond that, nothing is definite.

If ve nould like to give him a try,

then, some move should be made to fornalize natters with him before he

accepts some job that will put hin out of the neriet.

17. Recognising that there are risks involved, it nevertheless seens

nost undesirable to pass up what has the earmarks of being a highly

useful asset.

therefore, that Headquarters review and consider

the entiraty of our knowledge of GIBSON to this point, and give us &

reading on his potential worth, as vieved by Lolarvist, li division,

KUDISK/ICG and other'interested parties.

If, fci reasons of which

bo a market for his talents and capabilitios, ve should nove ratber

rapidly to pre-empt hin.. His present flexibility is not likely to last

for long, and any plan to use hin should taié this into acoount. As

W/BC 18 anzIe, he are not in a pusition to pit this into the fora of a

London Station projest.

This should not be

the reason for negleoting

what appears to be such a potentially rewarding asset for fubaik, doweveI.

On 11 February KUBARK Staff Agent Errol 8. KULPA, who had

contact ulth GIBSON in 1363-64, listened to reference tape and made

the following comments, which may be helpful to Katzenbach.

felt that the GIBSON that he was bearing on the tape had indeed

changed rather radically since the last time KULPA had any contact

KULPA reDenbers GIBSON aB anti-white

and probably (because ol this racíal orientation) anti-U.S.

1s therefore quite suspicious of GIBSON's notivations and advises

that extreme precaution be taken in the hundling of GIBSON.

?. KULPA's vien of Gibson's notivations:

KULPA hag strenuous doubts as to any idealogical motivation

on the part of GIBSON.

He recognizes the obvious monetary

notivation and feels that this probably plays a large part

1n the man's being willing to talk to ODYs.

Another very

possible notivatioa 1s GIBSON's disaffection with VERGES.

Parenthetically, KULPA added that in Algiers and probably in

Paris, GlISON was really nothing nore than a name that Vskais

wanted on the masthead.

GIBSOX's prinary duties as "editor"

vere probably in the area of translatios.

XULPA feels that perhaps sons legitimate information of value

can ba obtained in the area of the Revolution.

Again, paren-

It might be noted that KUapy felt that GIBSON

thetically " rided istic" as his wife. There GIRSON night adhere

to the aspects of karxist Leninian that called for revolutionary

change (probably because of his dissatisfaction with a world

In which the black man had to enduro a certain amount of

discrinination), he is not a strict doctrinaire in any

On the other hand, KULPA pointed out that

GIBSON's wife (who by the way is a Central European by

not British is idealistic in the sense that she feels her

brand of leftien aust be internally and idealogically

consistent.

(This is why she objected to GIBSON's writing

for incounter and why she probably vould get upset i1 she

knew exactly what type of game her husband was currently

playing with ODYOKE.)

OBLY - 21868

In line with the need to put the debrieling on a businesslike

(ratber than a "flexible") basle, it night be & good idea to start

by getting Subject to supply a personal history statement from the

time of bis first entry into leftist political novements to tha

present day. (This can be presented to Subject as a basis IOr us

to formulate meanlogiul questions,

not a8 any sort of personal

"confession" on his part.)

In addition to providing us with a

chock on his veracity,

this will set the stage for a debriefing

conducted on KUBARK'& terms, not subject's.

It is laportant that

1t be made clear to Subject

at the outset that we wast facts, sot

spoculation, cormestary and analysis.

A. Please charge payments to subject for the debriefing to

Acet. IT. 5137 - 1468 (Hqs. LCHARVEST OOA).

Three hundred dollars

I0r the initial 24 hours talk with Subject is on the steep side.

Honore thinking in terns of $700 for five days debriefing with a

bonus for a copy of the Revolution mailing list.

Borg: Log Angeles on 13,5.31

dress: , stockleiga hall,

Frince Albert Road, London, ii. w. 8.

GIBSON has been cornected with the pro-chinese Cossunist publication

"Revolution" and its predecessor, "Afrioan Revolution", st least since

April, 1963. He nado available the following intornation about biaself as

pert of a publialty caspeiga planned for "Africen Revolution" in the first

ha18 0f 19633-

1959-528

worked in Rone for the Mediterranean News

Bureau of the "Christian Science Monitor";

1955-583

editor with the English language service of

"Agence Frence Presse" in Paris;

1958:

arrested by the irench authorities because or

his work for the algerian National liberation

Front;

1959-60:

returned to the U.S.to and amployed by the

G.B.S. News in New York until dismissed because

of his pro-cuban activities;

ararded a C.B.S. fellonship in African Studios

at columbia University;

1960-Sopteabes, 1962:

Breoutire Socretary of the "Pair Play for Cuba"

Conmittee in the U.S.A.

In 1963, GIBSON lived 1n Lausanne, where "African Revolution" and

subsequently the Inglish edition of "Revolution" mere printed, but he paid

frequent visits to "Revolution's" Paris office until the end of the year

when "Revolution" was banned in Switzerland and he as refused permission to

continue to live there.

He then settled in Paris where,

according to one

report, he and his sife lived in "quite a luxurious flat".

It would, however,

be wrong to infer fron this that GIBSON's means enabled his to enjoy biga

Living standards, as another source subsequently reported that he had sot

pold any rent for the flat fron May to October, 1964.

30

As far back as August, 1963, there mere runours in Coamunist circles in

London that GIBSON was an daerican agent and that he hed provided United

States Intelligence with the nanes of certain unidentified United States

negroes in accordance with a brief receiveù fron the Americans.

Inforestion

fron a vell-placed source suggests that these rumours nay have originated

sron the jealous reactions of tro persons, comected with "Revolution", whose

asporations with the publication were cut short when GIASON becare Editor

of the English adition.

Fowever, by n1d-1964, VERGES, tin Bditorial Director

of "Rerolution", was claising that complaints about GIBS...'s activities had

been received not orly 'fros london, but also from cuba, iaericen negroes in

New York and a relative of GIESON's who was working for the sagasine "Spark"

In Ghana.

As a result, GIBSON nas dismissed fron the editorial staff of

"Revolution", Charges nado against him include the folloting-

Although GIBSON has denied the charges nade against his, he realises that

they have stuck and that 1t «ill be sue years before he will be acceptable

to any loft wing organisation.

Having felled to flad employaent in Paris after learing "Revolution"

1n July, 1964, GIBSON went to the United Kingdon on 7th October and was

joined later by his British ulfo, Joy Marjorio, and his tro children. be

hoped to find work in lordon, but at the end of November, he was still

witbout a job and dependent on his nife's fasily, who were paying the rent

of bis flat at 30, Stockleigh Hall, Prinoe Albert Road, Londor, N.W.8. It

Is now known whether GIBSON has been able to find employsent.

5.

Nothing is know at present about GIBSON's contacts in the United

Kingdon.

Although during the tine he worked for "Revolution" he nas in

touch with meabers of the pro-chinese Connunist splinter group in the

United Kingdon - the Contittoo to Defeat Revisionian, for Corrunist Unity -

It Is not known whether he has resumed contact.

ABSTRACT

REF'8 LOHD 5706, 21 January 1965

lo Attachod 1a the tapo of the intervior rith ulisoi, rodorded in an

Embaasy offloo, using & ther 4000 Report - 5 recorder, rocordisg at a spood

of 15/16 s09t: por slanto.

'Thö iatervioner used the alido of fari Wilson.

Gibaon arrived at 1745 and departed at about 2030.

Ve aro not attenpting to sunmarise or analyse GIBSOl's commento in

this dispatab.

tapa provides a muoh nore ravealing ploturo than our

aubjootiva comments could. A lennotos, hoverer, appear to be in order.

3.

Speaking of his departure, GIBSOY said he plannad to loave london

on 24 or 25 January.

As of noon 24 January, at least, he vas still in London

bgoause I saw him walking on St. John's Hood Jigh Street. (A potential

problom erists heres GIBSON and I live within a fox blocks of one another

and not infrequently ride the sano bus lino.

Thia problem oan only be not

when 1t nanifests 1tsol1.) JAGUAR, incidentally, has alortod its inmigration

controts (prior to ouI neeting with GIBSCH) and raquested that his name be

put on a natob list.

They said that thoy rould inform us 1f they learn that

he has left the country.

He have not yet heard that he bas left.)

GIBSON was given money amounting to 8300. Inder the circurstanoes

of hia plans, as he exprossod thes, it seoned reasonablo to do so, to ensuro,

that he would cone back to talk nore. He nas noro than

ullling to tako the money and relaad the initial suggustion of $200 to $300

obvious ahift in his line rogarding dollars (as opposed to

pounde) la farther indicative of his villingness to got mbat ho could.

the considorablo number of sanes nentioned by GIBSON sakes the

transoription of the notes a sizablo chore, and in order to lesson this

burden a listing bas boon compiled of almost all of the sanes, in the ordor

in whiah they appent in the tape, with the excoption of VaRDES and the Free

Play for Cube Conmittno, CBS and a few others.

The namas appear only one

time onch os the list, although sany of thes arop up repeatedly in the tape.

KOBIRD/LCHARVISI/UNION - Identity A, fomerly exployed by Identity B

REFERENCE: PARI 8052

NOTE:

The follo.ing round-up and commentary on Iden A had been rafted

before PAL? 3017 of 6 January 1965 and later traffic presented tie

case in a soze hat differeat ligit.

ie forard the follo.ing any-ay,

as sone of the background and sugrestions still sece pertinent.

Several questions raised belo. have now been resolved, notably the alleg-

ation of an Iden A/UBAki lini: (explained by the ODEVY letter of 1

December 1904, not available Jen the following was written). Copies

of recent PA.P correspondence oa Iden A, passed to us on 13 Jacuary

1965,

are attacied as Attaciment 3, USC.

i. Upon receiving the senorancum cited in tie reference, we requested

¿artier details fron C.niOU.D, stressing our interest in tie report that Crus

nembers had given IDii C documents which snowed Iri a belonged to

"the services

D/5986 of 30 December 1964, UBOUiD's answer to our query, merely

reiterates that the U:BOUD source, a good one, baseú tie report on a

"corenmi-

cation of docusents" by American Communists to

IJa: C, mica supposcily

established that IDEN A belonged to KUBARK: UNBUUD states that the source is

not in a position to identify the persons in question. UNBOUND's reply suggests

the information aigit have come from an audio operation; we sight mention nere

that LiBi A nas appeared occasionally on UPKY, but never in an informative

нау.

A nail Intercept mignt also be the source of lOUD's report, or it

120

way bave cove fron a third service (conceivably JAGUAl or S:i01il) •

2. Our continuing preoccupation ta the IDaii A question is three-fold:

(a) his expulsion fron IDií 8 (and cuus from acceptance by pro-Peiping groups)

opens the door for uis possible recruitment; (o) we would llke to determine

shether his ouster was engineereá by personal enemies or wether he actually

did voris for an intelligence service, and wnicu one; (c) as Peiping regaras

tine USA as its privary target,

the Chinese can be expected to continue prop

GIBSO, Robert iranklya WILLAiS, and Halcola X, all ooviously inteacied to

prejudice readers against the USt on ground of racial injustice. ill three

men are of have been involved with foreiga Communists: GIBSCi and WILLiLIS

with the Chinese and tie Cuoans, notauly, and Malcoln & with tie Cainese and

African governments to nake representatioas in the jojo agaiast cue Usa's

treatuent of its legroes. Inis may de a foretaste of lainese plans for ioreiz

exploitation of this issue; ilalcolia was interviewed by "Revolution" in Cairo,

which bas since proved its enthusiastic aati-cricanisa.

Vincent I. LEE of "all worlds Publications" in new York City takes suscriptions

for "Revolution"). It is iard to say were Liti A enters into the clouced

picture of Averican Commist partisanship in the Sino/Soviet rift, but in

view of his snifting allegiances he may nave divulged to pro-soviet CPUSà

neapers, or to the Soviets themselves, infornation on Chinese subversion ir

IDEN C's denunciation of IDEll A nay have been at least partially

One of the most violent reactions came from the heirt-

land of capitalism, fron the amall American faction wilci pre-

duces the monthly Hammer & Steel Newsletter in Boston.

Tie

October issue of the

mineographed bulletin vengefully gives

list of eight reasons why Khrushchev fell - rach one a vin-

dictive crow of triumph, and many attacking not only Khrush-

Pointa 2, 3 and 8 will serve as illus-

trations:

?. His German policy -- Khrushchev sought to ingratiate

himself with

West Germany.

He was obvrously ready

to sell out the German Democratic republic...

The declining influence of the CPSU among the Social-

ist countries and the Communist Parties.

The pro-

posed Moscow gathering was shaping up as a conference

of only those Party leaders ready to openly serve

U.S. imperialist aggression against the national 110-

eration struggles.

For example, Aslan supporters 01

hrushcher could have gathered in a telephone booth.

8.

The nuclear success of People's China. Khrushchev

had

maintained that nuclear power was

the exclusive

responsibility of revisionists and imperiallete

of white nations.

Khrushchev'a great poner chauvin-

inn was blown sky high in Sinkiang Province.

Although there is no evidence that the politically insig-

nificant Hanner & Steel group enjoys any direct support from

the Chinese (as the Russians alleged in their "Open Letter"

of July 14, 1963), it has always offered its allegiance to

Peking in

the most extreme form.

This is expressed agair in

the claim that "Khrushchev's failure to recognize the contra-

diction between the oppressed peoples and iuperialism as the

focal contradiction of our time resulted in blindness concern-

1ug the leading sôle of the Chinese Party "8 Inis is a cialm

that the Chinese themselves would not want to nake, expecially

at this juscture.
