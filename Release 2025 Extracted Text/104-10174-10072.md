uss100/week plus expenses plus money to pay IDEN A's agentg. He said

this monay would not be reportable as incoue. When IDEN A asked about

the effect of his own ex-BErRALD status, IEN G replied BKHERALD does

not want of need to kno of this arrangement. IDEN & acknowledged that

US$100/week was a suall payment, but said any Infornation resulting in a

setzure of drugs, the arrest of drug traffickers, or damage to drug rings

will be assessed by a board within LiCOLLAR, and money (thousands of

dollera) rewarded for this assistance.

IDEN A would then be free to split

the money with hia agents.

ithin a year IDEN A should be able to afford the best and largest looster

boat availabie.

of his

assignment.

They stressed cover as the most important consideration,

"I don't want in go to any nore funerals". Thay added

that 1f WEN A got into trouble, tere were 150 LNCOLLAR agents in Miami

who would come to his ald instantly. MEN A was given emergency telephone

numbers and code uames, and was told INCOLLAR would arrange for his

airlift out (through she LNTUCK Air Station) 1f needei.

If his INCOLLAR

affiltation was blown, IDEN & said there would be compensation provided

up to US$40 thousand, as well ai relocation assistance.

The relocation

assistance was not specified, but IDEN A assuned this meant six months

Ilving expenses and assistance in job search aitivities, as well as

reimbursement for noving expenses. IDEN J and IDEY L, another ex-BIHERALD

official, were to come tu Key West one week later to brief IDEN A on the

local situation. In the meantime, IDEN A was to prepare a report on what

he knew about drug traffickers in the Key West area.

Two weeks later,

the two did appear in Key West.

activities was included in IDEN A's report, which also contained mich

additional data.

DATZ:

14 January 1976

1.

January 1976 at his home in Tampa, Florida.

97 at his home A Tape FOLD A had playes, d the

meeting through contact with an attorney in IDEN B.

IDEN A spoke for

several hours about his life since retirement in 1971. What follows 1s

a long suumation of his comments, and at the nero's corclusion his reasons

for bringing this situation to our attention. [Forwarded under Separate.

Cover]

2. IDEN A, who had a major role in the Bay of Pigs activities, and

who was associated with MWAVE during the period 1961-68, has maintained

many contacts within the Cuban community in Florida: LNCOLLAR, which

was aware of

drug importation business, had been unable to penetrate this group in

the period to late 1973:

IDEN A, in the neantine, had moved to Key Nest,

Florida, purchased a lobster fishing boat and equipment, and become a

respected member of the community.

3.

In late 1973, a former BKHERALD asset (ANTABY Project) who had

been terminated in 1963, IDEN C, came in IDEN A in Key West, claimed he

had

escaped from jail in Cuba in 1970 (where he had been jailed for drug

running between Cuba and WODUAL), and said he had information on drug

traffic. He

asked IDEN. A to contact someone in LNCOLLAR and indicate

IDEN C's willingness to be of assistance.

IDEN A replied he was retired

and could not help. A few months later, IDEN D (AMTABY-27), another

former asset, flew to Key West from Miami. He met IDEN A and informed

him LNCOLLAR had sent him down to check on IDEN C.

IDEN D identified

his L#COLLAR contaci as IDEN E, an ex-BHERALD asset and former BKHERALD

contract employee.

At about this time IDEN F, a former BKHERALD staff

employee, moved

to Key West and infocmed IDEN A that LNCOLLAR was being

with BHERAID employees in its Intelligence Division, and that

the leader of the division was IDEN G, another BHERALD staffer.

4. A few months later, IDEN A received a call from IDEN H, another

BKHERALD retiree, who asked about IDEN A's access to boats IDEN H wished

to purchase for a relative of his wife, the relative residing in Venezuela.

de photographed every boat in the Key West harbor, and it was apparent to

IDEN A he was INCOLLAR-involved. Later, IDEN F approached IDEN A and said

two BKHERALD people in Miami wanted to meet with IDEN A.

IDEN A agreed

io a wettins, aid

IDE" Fluirruced IDEN I and IDEN E.

IDEN A knew

IDEN I, but was aware of IDEN E only by reputation, which was unsavory;

IDEN E claimed to

be

a BHERALD employee, as did IDEN I. IDEN A, of

course, knew otherwise;

but said nothing.

In March 1974, IDEN A got a

call from IDEN J of the IDEN K, Miami.

He was an ex-BHERALD officer,

and he said IDEN G wished to speak with IDEN A 1n Miami on an urgent

basis.

5.

IDING told IDEN A that he wanted the latter to wori for INCOLLAR

to establish intelligence netwörks in the Cuban community in Key West.

He

said no one else could do it, and he promised to provide at the start

US$100/week plus

expenses plus money to pay IDEN A's agents. He said

tinis money vould

not be reportable as income. Wien IDEN A asked about

the effect.of his.own. ex-üKHERALD status, IDEN G replied BKHERALD does

not want of need to know of this arrangement.

IDEN G acknowledged that

US$10)/week was a snall payment, but said any information resulting in a

seizure of drugs, the arrest of drug traffickers, or damage to drug rings.....

will be assessed by a board within LNCOLLAR, and money (thousands of

dollars) rewarded

for this assistance. IDEN A would then be free to split

the noney with his agents.

IDEN J, who was at the meeting, added that

within a year. IDEN A should be able to afford the best and largest lobster

boat available.

6. IDEN G and IDEN J impressed IDEN A with the dangerous nature

uf his assignment.

They stressed cover as the most important consideration,

and IDEN & said,

"T don't want to go

to any more funerals".

They added

that if IDEN A got into trouble, there were 150 LNCOLLAR agents in Miami

who would come to

his aid instantly.

IDEN A was given emergency telephone

numbers and code names, and was told INCOLLAR would arrange for his

airlift cut (through the LNTUCK Air Station) if needed. If his LNCOLLAR

affiliation was blown, IDEN & said there would be compensation provided

up to US$40 thousand,

as well as relocation assistance.

The relocation

assistance was not

specified, but

IDEN A assumed this meant six nonths

living expenses and

assistance

in job search activities, as well as

reinbursenent for moving expenses.

IDEN J and IDEN L, another ex-BKHERALD

officiai, were to come to Key West one week later to brief IDEN A on the

local sitiation. In the meantime,

IDEN A was to prepare a report on what

he knew about drug traffickers in the Key West area.

Two weeks later,

the two did appear In Key West. The little they knew about Key West drug

activities was included in IDEN A's report, which also contained much

additional data.

7.

IDEN A subsequently set up an intelligence net, and began sending

back reports..

IDEN A was frequently summoned to Miami for meetings with

IDEN G.

Often: these meetings were a waste of time, and or

occasion IDEN G

would not even show up.

At one point IDEN J asked IDEN A towejie.s

paper on the capability of ex-BHERILD assets who were drug traffickers,

and who had been trained in infiltration and exfiltration, to penetrate

WODUAL coastal defenses with drugs.

IDEN A showed how the assets could

circunvent any government effort to stop the drug traffic. The paper

"scared LiCOLLAR to death," according to IDEN 1. At the end of June 1974,

IDEN J asied IDEN A to journey to Washingion to brief top LiCOLiAR

officials on his conclusions: It was to be an all exponse paid trip, and

MEN A flew up and stayed one week.

Total remuneration received for the

journey was

During the week, IDEN A had many meetings with

IDEN & and his deputy, IDEN M, a former IDEN N staff employee. IDEN G

indicated at that time he was impressed with IDEN A's reports and access

in Key West.

8.

Later, WEN A told IDEN G he had sent lots of reports, but there

had been ro arrests, and therefore no bonuses.

IDEN A said he would no

longer work for just US$100/week.

IDEN G replied he might be able to

make IDEN A a LNCOLLAR. consultant to protect his retired status.

He also

promised IDEN A a large lobster boat (taken from those confiscated in

LNCOLLAR raids), and

an additional US$500/month to meet expenses and

agent payoffs.

IDEN G also spoke of using IDEN A in LNCOLLAR activities

• in Jamaica and South America.

Nothing ever was forthcoming on any of

these matters. During this period, IDEN A also provided LNCOLLAR (at its

request) with the names of potential sources of information in the Miami

area.

Several persons were approached by LNCOLLAR using IDEN A's name,

and a number of former BHERALD assets were picked up in this manner.

Included in this group are IDEN O, IDEN P, and IDEN Q.

9.

In May 1974, IDEN F came to LEN A at a party and, while drunk,

said he had heard IDEN G wanted to recruit IDEN A for LNCOLLAR activities.

In June he made similar comments while at another social gathering.

IDEN A

made no

comment (other than requesting that IDEN F shut up).

When IDEN A

was recruited by IDEN G and IDEN J, they had made quite a point of saying

only they would be aware of IDEN A's LNCOLLAR ties.

Later in June 1974,

IDEN F said he linew IDEN A was working with LNCOLLAR.

In July 1974,

IDEN G said he did not like having IDEN L, who was IDEN A's handling

officer

in Miami, dealing with hin since IDEN L was known to be an

INCOLLAR officer.

IDEN G wanted to have IDEN A deal directly with him

in Washington, but IDEN A objected, saying the arrangement was too

cumbersome.

In late July, IDEN G introduced IDEN A to his new contact,

IDEN I.

In November 1974, it became apparent the drug ring in Rey West

on which IDEN A's group was reporting was becoming spooked and overly

cautious. Through several of his agents IDEN A learned this resulted

from a direct approach to the

violators by INCOLLAR officur IDEN E, who

had cuse to dey test unbeknownat to IDEN A.

Through friends In Miant,

IDEN A fOUnd out IDEN E was in charge of IDEN l's operation In Key West,

had a homosexual relationship with IDEN f which went back for many years

(and was responsible for the breakup of lUEN E's first Barrlage), had big

real estate deals going in Miand, had a Swiss bank account, and was still

using SHERALD cover In Miami.

11.

IDEN P, who was aware of IDEN E'S LNCOLLAR connection, and tho

other LNCOLLAR asset?

iri the Miami area, hid agreed to assist LNCOLLAR

only it LICOLLAR officials could guarantee IDEN E would never know of

their relationship or see any of their informant reports.

IDEN I arranged

for this througi iDEN G, and the three agents' files were placed in

IDEN M's safe.

IDEN A subsequently has

learned IDEN E routinely saw

all of IDEN P's reports.

Later, when the revelations in the preceding

paragraph vere known. IDEN I told IDEN A there were many allegations about

IDEN E,

and that he had mentioned this to IDEN G.

IDEN & had assured

him he would be brought to washington to discuss the watter, but nothing.

ever came of it.

Ironically, IDEN E was taken into LNCOLLAR

on the orders

Of LNCOLLAR Director IDEN R,

and it was specified that no clearance or

background check would be undertaken on him.

12.

IDEN I and IDEN A decided to approach IDEN E to learn more about

IDEN E:

During

a one hour discussion, IDEN F said he had been appointed

the recruiting officer within BKHERALD for persons who would go to

LNCOLLAR. IDEN F said he had known IDEN E for'a long period of time, and

had brought him alung in BKHERALD hierarchy. IDEN A believes IDEN F

also engineered the tbsence of a security check on IDEN E by LNCOLLAR

since he did not want his homosexual relationship with IDEN E revealed.

At that point IDEN A called IDEN 6 and filled him in on what had been

learned, including IDEN F's adaission that IDEN E had told him IDEN A

was an LNCOLLAR asset.

IDEN & denied knowing IDEN F, but said he would

check on IDEN E.

IDEN A met wich IDEN G the next day In Miami to fill

him in further, and IDEN G ordered a full investigation.

In the meantime,

IDEN F COld IDEN E of his meeting with IDEN I and IDEN A, and IDEN E

wrote a menorandum

saying a fellow LNCOLLAR officer (IDEN I) had over-

stepped the bounds. of propriety in his relationship with an LNCOLLAR

asset (IDEN A), and that IDEN I and IDEN A were running an investigation

On IDEN E.

IDEN E described the situation as "intolerable".

The LNCOLLAR

inquiry, then, turned from IDEN E to improper actions by IDEN I in

discussing an LNCOLLAR employee with an asset.

The Internal Affairs

section of LICOLLAR did cuntinue the IDEN E prove and concluded by May 1975

that the charges agalnst IDEN E were accuraic.

In the meantime, IDEN I

was interrogated by IDEN M on his relationship wich IDEN A.

13.

In August 1025, IDEN G Informed IDEd & that control of lis

operation was being

transforred to the Miami regional office,

and that

his financial relal lonip with LNCOlIR would be terminated and ther

re-established locally following I September 1975. "On 9 September 1975,

a state-federal tasli force arrested 39 persons in Key best.

IDEN A knew

nothing about the arrents in advance.

He called IDEN & to find

was happening, and IDEN & sald he also was unaware of thee.

IDEN A to continue

reporting on chese developments.

The next day. IDEN A

met with a source win told him someone had blown IDEN d'S LICOLLAR

affiliation to the drug ring.

He described the leak as coming from an

ex-BKHFPALD officer who hated IDEN A. IDEN d's source, who was in touch

with drug ring members, told IDEN A the codename of his LiCOLlAR operution

(IDEN S), sad IDEN A Iearned IDEN F had spread this word all over town.

IDEN A subsequently received telephone death chreats (one of the ring

member's girl friend called to tell him a white LNCOLLAR informant (IDEN A)

would not get out. of town alive).

There had been eight informant deaths

In Monroe County (Key West) in 1975, oll unsolved murders.

There vas...

every reason, then, to take the threats serlously.

IDES A informed

INCOLLAR about the threats. INCOLLAR replied that IDEN A was pushing the

panic button, and awked for more information.

IDEN A requested that the

emergency evacuation apparatus be used, but INCOLLAR refused.

INCOLLAR said

"We don't know what you espect us to do since you've been

terminated".

IDEN A, who lad been terninated by LNCOLLaR/Washington,

up subsequently by the Miami Regional Office.

IDEN A, deniring to keep a low profile, could not talk to many

of his agents in Key West, but the

few he did reach were expecting a

portion of the reward money since the

ring that was rolled up was one the

agents had reported on for many montis.

IDEN A checked with LNCOLLAR

on this, and was Informed his net's information was not used as the basis

for the arrests.

IDEN A learned that IDEN F had passed the word around

Key West that IDEN

A was not an LNCOLLAK staff employee, which made IDEN A

fair game for removal:

He also learned plans had been made locally for

his murder.

At that point, IDEN A then made his escape with his wife.

In Miami, he met with IDEN M.

IDEN M claimed IDEN E had not caused any

of the problems IDEN A had experienced.

Concerning money assurances,

IDEN M first denied

any promises had been made.

Later he said any

that

had been made (by IDING) were unauthorized.

He reiterated IDEN A's

reporting, although accurate, was not used in the arrests., LNCOLLAR

agreed to provide IDEN A wich US$1800 for all his probless; and raised

the sum later to US$) thousand.

IDEN A accepted the money, but did not

indicate he was satiofled with this sum.

let us know what has happened to many of its former employees and assets.

IDEN A believes BKHERALD should know of the false promises that were used

to lure some BKHERALD employees to work at LICOLLAR. As documentation,

he provided IDEN l's grievance letter to LNCOLLAR which 19 attached* and

for retention.

IDEN 1 has, incidentally, been taken out of the Intelligence

One Item of Interest to Lynch

-conseras a book ha slahas to urire on Cuban operationa durina tha

period 1961-67. Lynëh currandly la In the process of preparing one

book' (on tha Bay of Plga) for publication. Recently, havever, ba

spoke with George Crile, ino 1a exiting a book on haresgate burglare

Eugento Martines and Bernarl Barker.

Crile Indicated his and co author

Taylor branch plan to follow that book with one on che Ajency'a Cubas

operations,

and focue on Lynch and Willlam Robertson, two Enjor figures

1i tha Bas of Plga Invasion. Since Martines van deeply Iavolved with

Lach as a ship esptain during the Bay of Pigs and In subsequent

operstions ágainst Cuba, he uill he cho primary surce for the book.

2.

wach ballaves the story Martines will provide will be somewhat

Insccurate becauss ba only saw developnentg from the vantage point of

a ship captain.

Lyacia (shose cohort Robertion 1a daceased) ballaves

only ba ear provide an accurate recounting.

Tha Martines book 18

scheduled for printlag lis the sumar of 1974. Lynch would Ilka to

beat Colla and Branch to the punch.

Indeed, he belleves they sill not

publiss thelr book 11 tney knou ke 1a going to publish one on tha denia

subject.

What Lynch vishes 1s an Indication of ganeral Ageney reaction

to asy samiscript be light write on the period.

3. Lynch wishes to urite about the operations of the AALILAC

group (Comsandos Momblse1) duriag the perlod 1961-67, when Lyoch

condueted about 100 Infiltration and exfiltration operations in Caba.

Any asiancilpt he drafts will, of coures, ba submittad to tha Agency

He does not wish to get lato the vilting job, bouver,

If thera 1a a blankar prohibition on describing Agency operations

unich occurred, In that period and place.

He notus that Marines, Dot

fattared ly Agency rastretions, uill proulde Crile and Branch with

1. John Greaney, OGC, called this date to advise that ex-cla

natone wants re consult ays a bit officer on some under tele protes

concerning other ex-CIA employees..

it seems that Lynch, who was

involved in

the Bay of Plas operation and is an open protagonist of

CIA, is writing a book. He is in contact with Greaney with respect

to OGe's need to revier the book before it is published.

Greaney, who belleves that Lynch may be connected with

Dave Philips: Ex-CIA Employces Association, asked if we could have

a DCD officer from the Miant Field Office visit Lynch In Tampa,

some importance and urgency to his request and indicated that it :

would be advantageous for the Agency to remain on nood terms with Lynch.

I told him I would pass his request on to higher DCD

authority and let him krow what is decided. Lynch's address 1s:

8709 Bay Point Drive, Tampa, Florida, telephone: 813-884-8610.
