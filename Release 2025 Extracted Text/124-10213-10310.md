GoNZALEz stated that they knew they were under

He said

the only evidence

against ORLANDO BOSCH AVILA during

his trial for extortion

was that the threatening notes had

been typed on a type -

writer to which BOSCH had access.

For this reason, when

Cuban Power had sonething to write, they rented a type-

writer at the cost of $30.00 for the purpose.

GONZALEZ

said that different persons rented typewriters from

different places in

order

to elude the investigative

efforts of the FBI (S8)W)

GONZALEZ Said that Cuban Pover was preparing news

releases which would be sent to the local news media that

night (February Y). According to GONZALEZ, the MIRR and

ORLANDO BOSCH AVILA were preparing an important work

about Cuba" which would reaffirm the position of the MIRR

so that there would be no connection between the MIRR and

bombings which had

occurred in Miami. FELIPE RIVERO,

of the

CNII,

commented regarding the

recent bombings in Miami

that the only thing a

bombing such as occurred recently in

Miami does is to take the medicine from the elderly and the

children.

RIVERO further stated that when he does

something

he signs his name to it.

JORGE MASCANOSA, representative of

RECE, would not talk against the bombings, however, at the

same

time LUIS CONTE AGERO also refused to make

any comments

regarding the bombings.

CONTE stated, however, that he was

against sending any packages to Cuba except medicine.

The following investigation was conducted by

SA EDWIN PETER KRIEGER:

On January 26, 29 and 30, 1968, HM 1264-C was

contacted regarding Cuban Power and the recent bobings in

the

ared.

Informant advised

that he heard that a young group

of Cubans

in the age

category of 18 to 20 years

of age have

been actually

or personally involved in the local bombings

in

the Miami area.

He felt that Cuban Power was using these

young individuals inn

that they have no fear

and they crave

excitement.

He further

said that he heard that ORLANDO

BOSCH is the leader of the Cuban Power group.

He further

that he believes it is this same group that is

responsible for the bombing

of B25

cargo aircraft at Miami

International

Airport on January 20, 1968.

Informant continued by saying that

a source for

the Cubans

obtaining powder for any homemade bombs could be

through Maule Industries,

Miami, which handles explosive

powder and this company hires many Cuban employees.

Informant said that he does rehabilitation work

with young Cubans and Puerto

Rican male individuals and

FERRER said

He stated

"DOMEC" is possibly identical with ROBERTO DOMEQ RODRIGUEZ,

DOMEQ is a member of the group of

ATON has reportedly told the Miami
