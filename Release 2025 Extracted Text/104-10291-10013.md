you in your retirement planning.

3.:

possible on the general subject of retirement, your annuity estimates, life

and health insurance protection in retirement, opportunities for other

employment, Social Security benefits, and other additional matcrial which is

vice should be made available and, hopefully, will be used by employees well.

Mr. Noel is much too experienced and practiced a hand for his performance

to vary very much from year to ycar.

He has continuertif * Bin the hight

reditable performance in San Francisco that has been standard for hin fo

many ycars: He has managed hia subordinates well and has exorcised uni-

formly good judgment in directing their opcrational efforts. Of particular

value has been his stcadinees in the faco of administrative adversity disrupting

the organization of his Base. Mr. Noel insured that the work of the Bage

continued uninterrupted and demonstrated his capacity to keep on top of

all details and report them to Headquartors as appropriate. It is a credit

to Mr. Noel that in the post-Ramparte exposure period there was not a singlo

instance of an academic asset withdrawing from a relationship with the Base.

The performance of his officers atteststhe careful guidance and wise

leadership which has enabled them to oporate securely and woll in sensi

tive areas. His realtions with the FBI and DCS aro excollent. He is

appropriately economy mindod. In short, he is a decidedly strong aupor-

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT.

SUBJECT:

James A. Noel, Employee Serial No. 055292

Fitness Report for the Period 1 April 1964

to 31

March 1965

1.

Subject, who was born 19 March 1911, 1s a GS-16 and

has, been assigned to Madrid as Chief of Station since

October 1961°

As Chief of Station, he is charged with the organ-

tzation and management of the station and is responsible

the planning, direction, and supervision of all its

activities:

He also exercisos general supervision of the

Barcelona base:

Assisting him and under his general super-

vision äre 24 staff employees and 15 contract employees:

3.

Subject serves as the Ambassador's principal intel-

ligence officer,

as chairman of the Embassy Defector Committee,

as the Agency representative on the Embassy Country Team,

and as

the coordinator. of U.S. clandestine intelligence opcra-

tions in Spain.

Accredited as the Agency's representative to

the Spanish Intelligence (AEM) and Security (DGS) services,

he plans, directs, and supervises all aspects of the station's

multi-level liaison with these services and personally handles

the liaison with the service chiefs and a number of their

sentor officers:

On the operational side,

subject handles

BISHAD/L, CITIZEN and QUWIND/1:

He recruited QUIP/l during

the rating period,

arranged a new cover job for HARRIOTT

through QUW-IND/1, and

participated in the handling of QUALT

and QUilOPS.

1.

subsect 1s an experienced and mature olficer,

possessing an excellent coumand of Spanish.

Highly motivated,

conscientious, and

he rcadily accepts responsi-

bility and is

not thorn and relate need a peo

his duties.

'Even

tempered and affable,

he holds the confi-

dence and friendship of those whom he directs and those to

whom he is responsible,

and the morale of his station is.

noticeably high.;

'He is alert to the operational possibilities

Ta: 100.

of any given situation, evidences sound and objective judgment,

and works well under pressure.

He writes lucidly, speaks

articulately, and

exhibits a high degree of cost consclousness

in the use of government funds and property.

His delegation of

responsibility to others is meaningful and well delineated.

5.

Subject's performance has been strong throughout the

rating period.

He has given the

station purposeful direction

ard competent management and as an effective supervisor who

commands the loyalty and respect of those whom he supervises, he

has succeeded in obtaining a maximum effort fron the station

personnel.

He enjoys the confidence of the Ambassador and other

principal officers of the Embassy, soveral of whom have expressed

their appreciation of subject's work and commented on the value

of the station's contribution to the functioning. of the Embassy..

The fact that the Ambassador arrived in Madrid with definite

prejudices regarding

the Agency but was of quite

another mind

upón his departuré is testimony to subject's skill and tact.

6.

Subjéct has conducted the Agency's liaison with the

Spanish services most competently,

as evidenced by the rela-

tionship he established with Captain General Munoz Grandes, his

ability to persuade

in Cuba; and the

the AEM to undertake sensitive

operations

fact that this

liaison did not suffer following

the attack on the Spanish ship "Sierra Aranzazu".

Marked

progress has been

achieved in joint CE and CP operations, and

subject has developed QUANTUM/30 to the point wherein the

latter's collaboration far exceeds the cooperation normally

expected

anofficial liaison relationship.

7.

In addition-to his considerable executive and liaison

duties,

subject has carried out the previously cited opera-

tional

assignments with

marked ability.

He is a convincing and

persunsive agent handler, and his oporational reporting is

prompt and

thorough.

8. The only criticism I would make of subject is that I

believe the station should berking a greater effort to develop

internal assets who will be able to report on and influence

developments in Spain following the departure of Franco.

SUBJECT

Mr. James A. Noel

Fitness Report Covering the Perlod 14 August 1961 to

31 March 1962

Mr. Noel assumed his dutles as Chies of Station, Madrid on

23. Boptember 1961. The Station, as constituted when Mr.

Noel arrived,

• Included sone 21 staffers plus numerous contruct personnel, as well ag

ä, tho man base in Barcelona:

The Madrid Station proper

not only includes

the Pnasey installation but an outaide operations section as well.

• Since

Mr. Hoel arrived the Station has been launched into a Cuban opcrationa

progran of conuiderable scale and on a crash basis.

In addition; In this

period, one State cover slot was witharain,

and the experlenced

Chief of

Base, Farcelon hud to be brought home due to a family energency.

2.

to date Mir Noel has given every evidence of a particular soillty

to cope with the crash program and the acute shortage of personnel with

judiciousness and maturity.. While 1t 1s too early, jet, to pass judgement,

there are Indications that Mr. Noel has been preoccupied with Cuban

problems (an arca of apecial interest to hun) to the detriment of lower

priosity but, nonetheless, necesaary Spanish targets (for example, contact

with the local opposition and a budding, celort aginat the Spanish Connunlot

Parts):

3.

As Indicated above,

Mi. Noel har not been in place as Chief of

Station long enough to justify firm reserratlons

concerning hid punagenent,

nox to permit neanineful criticion.

Aiso, as indicated above, hie out-

standing noticeuble strength to date has been his ability to cope with a

heavy operational progran, a shortage of personnel, and a sonctimes alffleult

operational climate, with judgement, calmness and autience.

James A. Noel -

Manorandüm In Lleu of Fitness Report

Mr. Jamas A. Noel arrived in Esvans, in September of 1958, a triflo

more than three montha before Fidel Castro assumed power on 1 Jaruary

-1959. With the advent of that sew government Cuba becans, so far 88

U.S. economic and polltical interests are concerned, one of the most

Important spots In the vorld, as well as increasingly nore difficult

to conduct CIA business.

As a result, with the constant worsening of

cuban-loSe recationap, at le doubtrul taat there de so the present

timo: a nore difficult asalgament than Havana in this Division. Never-

theless, with an extremely linited staft, Noel had been able to con-

tinue, and even extend, his operatione to the point where almost over,

significant phase of Cuban l1fe. 1s covertly, covered.: When the Increase

of antl-Us reoling is considered, to say nothing or the Inerease of

effectiveness of the Cuban counterintolligence resulting from Its

direction by soviet professionals, it lo enzing that Noel has been:

able to produce the great

volume of important reports which he has. sent

He has conducted some extremely delicate operations in the face of

almost

certainty

"ot diseovery.

In all this, however, he has offered

leadership of a high quality to his staff and has been a fine example

of good morale, which is reflected in the attitude of every member of

his staff, all of you respond readily and without complaint to the

demands nade of them by their surrounding circunstances. Mr. Noel

deserves to be varily conmended for a job well done.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

James A. Noel

1. - Chief, DO and I talked to Jim Noul this morning about

tie possibility.of his converting from staffer to career agent.

After considerable discussion, Jim agreed to the conversion. He

is obviously doing this reluctantly, but he appreciates the situation

within the DDP in which the encumbrance of senior grades by long-

lime employees is blockirg the promotions of junior officers.

2.

Jim urged that he be retained as a career agent until

he reaches the age of mandatory

retirement (about three years).

Chief, DO stated that the need in the San Francisco area for handlera

of contacts and assets is such that there would be a continuing need

for experienced career agents on the outside of the small San

Francisco Base. I told Jim that unless he pulled something stupid,

he was virtually assured of career agent status until he reached

age 60, and perhaps could be employed as a retired annuitant alter

that time if his performance was productive and if operational

requirements remain as they are at present.

3.

Jim explained why he could not retire -- the next five

years will be difficult for him financially with two teen-age boys to

put through college.

Chief, DO and Jim will work out the details and timing

oi his conversion to career agent.

Retirement Information

1.

There are a few altuations in which en employee ot

the time of

retirement may have

so many years of service (almost 37) that tre would

recelve a higher annulty under the Clvll Service Retirement Byatew. than

under the Organization System. Because of this, the polloy

decision has

baen made that a participant in the Organization System who would

receive

a higher annuity under the Civil Service Syalen may, not later than eight

een monthe prior to his retirement, apply

to be removed, frura our system

ind "transferred to the Civil Service System.

Since you will complete 37

years of Federal service in Innuary of next year 1t 18 felt that you

should be advised of your reiirement status under the Orzanizallon §yatem

and also 1f returned to the Clull Service Systen. The following Infor

mation l8 being submitted lo assiat you in determining which course of

action you desira to follow:

a. During the period from 15 Auguat 1944 chrough 19 October

1946 there were no retirement deductions withheld from your salary.

In order for chia time to be credited in cou. ilni, total service

under the Organization Syatera 1L would be necessary fur you to make

a depoait, with inlereal, lo cover thia perlod.

The laxious annulty

under our system 1s 70 per cent. based on 35 yeara of creditable

BerVIce.

If you should return to the Civil Service Syaten In order

to receive the maximum annulty it would be necessary for you to nece

& daposit, with Intereat, to cover that perlod fur which no contri-

butions were made; however, you may receive full credit in counting

total service without making a deponit but your anudly will be

reduced by one-tenth of the amount due as deposit.

b. As you are avare, you are presently enuitled to apply for

voluntary retirement under tho Organization Retirement and Disah11-

1ty System.

The annulty eatinate siven below as

of 31 October 1967

would be applicable if a deposii were wade to cover the perlod for

which no deductions were withheld.

The annuity estimate alien for.

31 March 1968 would be appllcable without a deposit since you would

have completed 35 years of creditable service at that time without

this period of service.

Memorandum in Lleu of Fitness Report for Cecil J. KLOBUKAR

for the Perlod 3i March 1969 to 31 March 1970

Cecil J. KLOBUKAR, a career agent, hay boon primarily targeted

against the local

consular community during

1od.

thly reporting per-

For this purpose he has maintained membership in two

local orkanizations concerned with foreign affairs.

More than

that, hu has been an active contributor to their programming

and has participated in mogt of their social and. cultural

functions.

This has onabled him to como in contact with a rela-

tivoly largo number of consulato officers.

During the past year

he has met, on one or more occasions, thirty consular members.

He is concontrating, however, on the ten consulates which have

reprosentation in tho donied and semi-denied areag. Within this

ared ho is further rofining the target by attempting to contact

tho moro junior. officors who give promise of a longer future

caroer and a greater chanco of being posted to an area of opora-

tlonal interest.

To date, he has succeeded in establishing such

contacts in the

Japanese,

Finnish and Indian Consulates.

In taig

last cars he has successfully passed the target to another Brse

officor for further development and hopes to accomplish the same

with hiy Japanese and Finnish contacts.

In addition to

this primary responsibility, KLOBUKAR also handles

a support asset who is targeted against the academic community.

He 1s directing this assot's efforts in the cultivation of two

promising leads -- one,

Japanose and the other, Vietnamese.

Both of there cases are progressing very well due in great part

to the direction and guidance which KLOBUKAR gives to the support

asset.

KLOBUKAR also played a very important and direct role in the

assessment and intermediate cultivation of TWPARROT/1 and

IWPARROT/2 who were subsequently successfully recruited.

1g now developing a local QKWAFER student who is an interesting,

but difficult, recruitment prospect.

KLOBUKAR 1s cost consclous in the expenditure of operational

funds; he does not have supervisory responsibilities.

Coc11 J. KLOBUKAR was the Chief of thia Base untll

July 1968 at which time he was assigned new dutles as &

career agont, targotod primarily against the San Prancisco

consular community.

Until that time thore was no specific

It was

KLOBUKAR's responsibility, thoroforo, to broak

those which were

of priority intorest because of

their rep-

resentation in donied and

semi-donied areas.

Ho then started

looking for

a means to get information and

gain access to

members of this targot group.

To assist him in this endeavor

ho recruited two mombors of the consular community, repre

senting Latin American countries.

Since their performance

did not live up to expectations,

KLOBUKAR took the initiative

by Joining three local organizations relating to forelgn

affairg in order to onhance his cover and possibility of

direct accoss as a retired LNGOLD officer.

By participating

in the gatherings of these organizations, KLOBUKAR 1s aiming

at direct contact with at least a few of

the officorg

from

target consulates.

KLOBUKAR has demonstrated excellent initlative in pur

suing.ag many avenues of approach as possible to this rather

diffloult target.

It is not a cohesive community and does

not experience the usual mixing and contact that one finds

in normal diplomatic circles.

It is fragmented and cliquish

and for

this reason KLOBUKAR has had to show both imagination

and perseverance in probing for access to those specific

consulates in which the Base has priority interest.

now demonstrating his dotermination to get at this target

by exploring another possible means of approach of his own

devico.

In addition to his primary responsibility against the

consular target, KLOBUKAR also handles one support asset

Subjact's performance has been strong throughout the

and 'compotent management and as an affective supervisor who

conninde the loyalty and raspect of those whon he supervises, ho

has succeeded. In obtaining a maximun offort from the station

porsonnel.

He enjoys the confidence of the Ambassador and other

principal officers, of the Embassy, several of whon have exprescod

their appreciation of subject's work and commented on the value

of the station's contribution to the functioning of the Embassy.

The fact that the

Ambassador arrived in Madrid with defialte

prejudices regarding the Ayency but was of quite another uind

upon his departuro 18 testinony to subject's skill and tact.

8. Subjoct has conducted the Agency's laison with the

Spanish servicos most competently, as evidenced by the rola

tonahip he established with Captain General Munoz Grandes, hig

ability to persuade the AEl to undertake senaltive operations

In Cuba, and the fact that this llalson did not suffer following

the attack on the Spanish ship "Sierra Aranzazu".

Marked

prOgIess has been achloved in joint CE and CP operations, and

subject has developed QUANTUM/30 to the point wherein the

lattor's collaboration far excoods the cooperation normally

expocted in an official 11a1s0n rolationship.

7. In addition to his considerable executive and liaison

dutles, subject has carried out the previously cited opera-

tional assignmenta with marked ability.

He is a convincing and

persuasive agent handler, and his operational reporting 15

The only criticism I would make of subject is that I
