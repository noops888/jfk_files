WE ARE STILL GETTING ONLY TANGENTIAL GLIMPSES -

3. THE GENERALS MEANWHILE ARE NOW PRESSING PRESIDENT NGO DINE DIEM FOR A :

REPLY TO THE DEMANDS MADE SEVERAL WEEKS AGO DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE MARTIAL :

LAW PHASE. AS DESCRIBED BY GENERAL TRAN VAN DON, THE LIST OF DEMANDS ARE QUITE

EXTENSIVE, INCLUDING THE ASSIGNMENT OF MILITARY MEN: TO THE POSTS OF MINISTERS:

OF DEFENSE, INTERIOR, CIVIC ACTION AND EDUCATION. THEY ALSO ASKED FOR CONIROL.

OF THE SAIGON/CHOLON POLICE AND. THE PLACEMENT OF THE CAPITAL REGION UNDER A F

PERMANENT MILITARY GOVERNORSHIP. DON SAYS THAT HE AND HIS FELLOW GENERAL: OFFICERS

DO NOT EXPECT DIEM TO ACCEDE TO THIS PACKAGE OF PROPOSALS, ACCEPTANCE: OF WHICH.

WOULD INDEED AMOUNT TO A VIRTUAL SURRENDER ON. THE PART OF DIEM AND NGO DINH NHU.

THE LATTER WILL PROBABLY GO PART WAY, HOWEVER, IN MEETING THE DESIRES: OF THE

MILITARY IN AN EFFORT TO DETER THE LATTER FROM ATTEMPTING AN EARLY COUP: THEIR

TACTIC IS LIKELY TO BE ONE OF SEEKING TO ENMESE THE GENERALS: IN TIME-CONSUMING

NEGOTIATIONS RELATED TO THE PROSPECTIVE REVAMPING OF THE GOVERNMENT WITH A VIEW.

TOWARD GAINING TIME IN WHICH TO MONITOR AND BREAK UP ANY COUP COMBINATION WHICH

MAY BE DEVELOPING. THE OUTCOME OF MANEUVERING BETWEEN DIEM AND NHU AND THE

MILITARY DURING THE COMING FEW WEEKS, OR POSSIBLY EVEN DAYS, IS LIKELY TO BE

OF DECISIVE IMPORTANCE TO FUTURE COURSE OF EVENTS IN SOUTH VIETNAM.

4. DESPITE THE IMPRESSION OF THE RETURN IO NORMALITY THAT IS FEING FOSTERED

BY THE REGIME, THE ATMOSPHERE IN SAIGON CONTINUES TO BE PERVADED TO A CONSIDERABLE

DEGREE BY FEAR AND UNCERTAINTY. ARRESTS REPORIEDLY ARE CONTINUING, AS WELL AS

THERE ARE SCATTERED INDICATIONS THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM (GVN) IS

PLANNING TO SPRING SOME SURPRISES ON TRE 26 OCTOBER NATIONAL, DAY CELEBRATIONS:

NHU, FOR EXAMPLE, IS REPORTED IO HAVE TOLD THE GENERALS THAT IN A FEW WEEKS HE

WOULD UNDERTAKE AN UNSPECIFIED ACTION OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL NATURE. WHICH NEITHER

"THE WEALTHY NOR THE AMERICANS. WOULD LIKE." WE ALSO HAVE A REPORT THAT SWEEPING

CHANGAS IN THE POLICE AND CIVIL INTELLIGENCE COMPLEX WILL OCCUR MORE FRIVOLOUS

BUT PERHAPS SUGGESTIVE OF THE DESIRE BY THE REGIME TO EASE THE CURRENT AIMOSPHERE

IN SAIGON ARE THE RUMORS THAT THE BAN ON DANCING WILL BE LIFTED, NATIONAL DAY

WOULD BE THE LOGICAL TIME FOR DIEM TO ANNOUNCE REVAMPING OF HIS GOVERNMENT, PROVIDEI

THIS DELICATE OPERATION CAN BE COMPLETED IN TIME.

6... A SIRIKING. THING ABOUT THE ELECTIONS WAS THE FACT THAT THEY WENT OFF

VIRTUALLY WITHOUT INCIDENT, EITHER IN SAIGON OR IN THE COUNTRYSIDE. THERE HAD

BEEN SEVERAI INDICATIONS THAI THE VIET CONG (VC) INTENDED DISRUPTION AS A COMPANION

TACTIC TO THEIR PROPAGANDA CALL FOR THE BOYCOTT OF THE ELECTIONS: NEITHER DURING

THE ELECTIONS, NOR DURING THE PRECEDING BUDDHIST CRISIS, DID THE COMMUNISTS SEEM

ABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON THEIR IMMEDIATE OPPORTUNITIES. ESPECIAILY LACKING WAS TRE

EXERCISE OF THEIR MUCH VAUNIED CAPABILITES FOR TERRORISM, RAISING SOME QUESTION

IN OUR

MINDS AS TO WHETHER VC ABILITY IO USE TERRORISM IN CITIES/ AS GREAT AS WE

HAD BEEN LED TO BELIEVE. IT WAS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE IO MEASURE THE SUCCESS OF

THE VC BOYCOIT APPEAL SINCE THE GVN, IN MANY AREAS MORE OR LESS FORCED THE ELECTORAIE

TO VOTE AND IN AREAS WHERE ITS CONTROL WAS NOT THAT. STRONG, THE RECIME AIMOST..

CERIAINLY FALSIFIED THE PERCENTACES OF THE VOIE.

7. ONE INDICATION OF

'THE REGIME'S INCREASED CONFIDENCE THAT IT HAS THE:

SITUATION UNDER CONTROL IS THE FACT THAT COLONEL TUNG HAS RELEASED TWO COMPANIES

OF SPECIAL FORCES TROOPS FOR OPERATIONS AGAINSI THE VC.

8. ALTHOUGH MOMENTARILY QUIESCENT BECAUSE OF THE HEAVY GN SECURITY CONTROLS,

THE STUDENTS CONTINUE THEIR ORGANIZATIONAL. ACTIVITIES AND ARE DEVELOPING. PLANS FOR

FURTHER ACTION AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT. THERE APPEARS TO BE CONSIDERABLE DIVISION

OF OPINION AMONG THE VARIOUS STUDENT GROUPS, SOME OF WHICH EXISTED PRIOR TO THE

BUDDHIST CRISIS AND SOME HAVE SINCE EMERGED. REPORTING RECEIVED TO DATE WOULD

INDICATE THAT THE VC HAVE NOT YET MADE SIGNIFICANT INROADS INTO THE STUDENT MOVE-

MENT, ALTHOUGH THIS IS OF COURSE AN INCREASING POSSIBILITY IF RELATIONS BETWEEN

THE STUDENTS AND THE GVN LONG REMAIN IN THEIR PRESENT UNSATISFACTORY STATE. IN

PARTICULAR, WE HAVE LITILE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE THESIS THAT THE STUDENTS ARE:

TO .

FLEEING/THE COUNTRYSIDE TO JOIN THE VC ALTHOUGH SOME REPORTEDLY DID LEAVE SAIGON

AND HUE TO AVOID ARREST DURING THE PERIOD OF THE GOVERNMENT CRACKDOWN. : Vis

9. A REPORT FROM A VIETNAMESE TRADE UNION OFFICIAL PROVIDES ADDITIONAL:

BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE NHU-MANELI MEETING IN EARLY SEPTEMBER AND ON THE

GENERAL SUBJECT OF POSSIBLE GN-DRV RAPPROCHEMENT. ACCORDING TO INFORMATION

RECEIVED BY THE SOURCE FROM A FRENCH EMBASSY OFFICER, HO CHI MINH HAD AT ONE TIME

INDICATED TO A FORMER FRENCH REPRESENTATIVE IN NORTE VIETNAM HIS DISCOURACEMENT

OVER CASUALTIES SUSTAINED IN THE WAR IN THE SOUTH, HIS DISTASTE FOR THE CHINESE

PRESENCE IN THE DRV, AND HIS RESTIVENESS OVER SOVIET "INTERFERENCE" OF AN

UNSPECIFIED NATURE, LALOUETTE. WAS REPORTED TO HAVE PASSED THIS ON TO NHU WHO,

ACCORDING TO THE FRENCH, LEAKED IT TO JOSEPH ALSOP, THUS BETRAYING THE CONFILENTIAL

FRENCH CONVERSATION WITH HO. THE FRENCH ALLEGEDLY FEEL THIS PUT LALOUETIE IN AN

UNTENABLE POSITION; HENCE, HIS FATLURE TO RETURN TO SAIGON. IT IS DIFFICULT TO

BELIEVE THAT THE FRENCH REALLY CONSIDER NHU'S "INDISCRETION" AS SERIOUS, AS THEY LET

ON. SOURCE CLAIMS, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT MANELI TOLD NHU PRRCTICALLY THE SAME STORY

ABOUT HO'S PREOCCUPATIONS.
