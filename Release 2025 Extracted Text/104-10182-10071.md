It is from this base of operations that.

it appears, Mitch Werkell has been ned-

dline aeria. his time in the affairs of the

alrut-lo-ertüme surereign neute of the

Bahamas.

His activities - although no one is

completely sure just what they entail -

have prompted Bahamas Prime Minister

Lynden Pindling to denounce WerBell

and attorney Edwin Marger, an associate,

on the Moor of the

Bahamian

Parlia-

ment. Pindling called them "internation-

al fortune hunters"

with "designs on the

territorial sovereignty of the Bahamas."

Verbell's involvement in the Bahamas

—as an advisor to a faction that wants

the island of Abaco either to remain a

Crown Colony or lo become a separate

nation when the rest of the Bahamas be-

cones fully independent on July 10 -

has also prompted some concern by the

U.S.

Stute

Department's

Caribbean

Affairs Desk.

It is not a completely unfamiliar expe-

rience to Werkell to have elements of the

United States government at least con-

cerried

maneuvers.

He relishes recalling how a

raided the training area for the would-be

invaders, seized their arms and arrested

them in January, 1967, about two months

after WerBell hid gone home. Seven per-

sons were indicted for conspiring to vio-

late U.S. neutrality laws - including

Wier Beil.

Charges against

SVerBell,

however, were dropped

on orders

of

then-Attorney General Ramsey Clark.

WerBell now declines to discuss the

mechanica

of how the charges

ngoinst

him were dropped, except to say that he

was "in constant contact with the govern-

ment" during his participation in. the in-

vasion altempt and that he "did nothing

wrong." In 1970, however, Werßell told

an.Aliante magazine writer.

"When you

work for the company, they take care of

you."

"The company" is generally used as a

euphemism

for the Central Intelligence

Agency — an arm of goremment WerBell

says now he has never had anything to do

with, except to sell it some guns.

The

compary he was talking about, he says,

was CBS. Over the years, however,

Wer-

Bell has spoken often. of his association

with the Company. Producer MeMollen

quoted W'erBell to the congressmen as say-

ing he had "previous experience" with "the

company:"

•And when I asked him what

company he meant, he said the CLA," Me-

Mullen said.

"Everybody always pets that impression

prepared for the final vote endorsing Baha-

WerBell let

it be

known in a reporter for the London Daily

Muror (circulation five

was: 1) four-square for the cause of the

Council for a Free Abaco, and 2) recruiting

British mercenaries "for a project I have in

mind."

Abaco? "Who said it was Abaco?"

said WerBell. The fruit of the interview

was a front page story headlined: "Mutiny

Stay British ... A Call Goes Out fur Mer-

• Such were the initial tactics in the Bat-

fle of Mbaco, a cause that, for awhile in the

British press, seemed second in anticipated

While there are some penple who admire

others who don't. Among those others are

WerBell's former business associates, a

who bought WerBell and

Bennett B.

Armament Corp. (MAC) that the pair had

founded. "He's been headline press all over

Reeves, however, says he doesn't dislike

WerBell

— he just doesn't want to be

"I like him a great deal. He's amusing and

he's a character. But letting him run Colt

W'erBell and his associales in Powder

was introduced to Markins. There is also

sume talk about apprisching the Organiza-

tion of Americen States and the United

Nations.

And about a referendum

on

Anaco July 5 - the day before Bahamian

independence - un whether to unilaterally

declare Abaco a free natien. "We are pur-

ting to bear all our activity and friends to

tel! the world: 'Here's a rountry

that

duesn't want to go this way,' " says Wer-

Bell.

The accuracy of that assessment of feel..

ing on Abaco can he questioned. Many of

the

Abaconians who

originally opposed

separation from the Crown abandoned the

movement as fruitless in December, when

the British government decreed that the

Baharas - all of the Bahamas - gould

become independent. Nor was there ever

complete opposition throughout Abaco to

the Pindling

one other than Watkins is a Pindling sup

porter and a backer of independence. The

impetus. for the Free Abaco movement,

hoth Pindling and Minister of Extenial

Affairs Faul Adderly have charged, comes

from outside the Bahamas.

"I still think

that what they are basically involved in is

the,stealing of land,"

Adderly

said in a

recent interview. And indeed. the majority

of the people on Abaco know very little of

WerBell and Mareer outside of whut they

rend in the British press.

WerBell says his motivations are strictly

anti-communist. A far right winger - he

nism.

"Every goddam single symptem that

was present in Cuba exists in the Bahamas

" he says.

WerBell's opinion of the Pindling gov.

mate is one which meny observers of the

Bahainas do not share.. Although the over-

whelming majority of the islanders are

As Stated

in laragraph Three

Port Louis 12011, 17 May 1973.

There are no Headquarter's traces on Dr. George A. linkler,

but there are traces on the Military Armament Corporation

Board Chairnan, Mir. Mitchell Livingston HerBell Ill (201-259910).

In 1967 WerBell organized a firm called SIONICS, Incorporated

(Studies in Operational Negation of Insugency and Counter Subversion);

Quantum Ordnance Bankers and the new firm was named the Miiitary

Armament Corporation with herbell as Chairman of the Board.

2.

WerBell was born on 8 #arch 1918 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

te served in: the OSS, and was of interest to BKHERALD in 1959 when it

was discovered-that he was involved with anti-Castro plotters in

the Dominican Republic. He was granted a POA in August 1959 but this

was cancelled in October 1959 when his information proved to be of

little value and it was suspected that he was using BHERALD funds

to promote personal interests.

He has subsequently attempted to

pass hinself às LNBUZZ connected and as a BKHERALD employec.

•Mr.

herBell's lengthy 201 file shows a long history of his appearing in

areas: and

situations where he can make a fast buck.. He is character-

ized as unscrupulous, a "wheeler dealer"

, and a promotor of grandioso

schemes.

NOTACK advises that the arms WerBell offers for sale are

of good

quality, bit that the selling price is considered excessive.

in that Me. Herßell is a WODUAL citizen, the above infor-

should not be. passed to CGPAT/1. •tiowever,

the Station could

inform CGPAT/l that the Military Armament Corporation has

although it may have permission from NVIDEA to export

connections and that any dealings with the

corporation should be approached with extreme caution.

Chief, Miaul Field Oftice

Mitchell Livingston Werbell, III

1. On 9 Mar 71 we received a long distice call, presusably fren Powder

Springs, Georgia, from subject, who is an old and unsavory contact of this

office dating fron 1959.

herbell has been involved in a variety of scrapes,

the latest of which conceraed an abortive invasion of Haiti which John Greany

was very such concerned about a jear or so ago.

Werbell stated that the Departeent of Defense had just revoied his

secure, clearance on grounds of herbell"a "frivolous behavior" in the llaittan

caper. herbell stated that he intended to "fight it to the Supreme Court", as

he had always kept us and other elecents of the US Governsent informed coi

cering developments in the laitian matter.

3. Herbell asked if there was anything that we could do for hin in the

way of interceding for hin with the dob, and we inforned his bluatly and in

no uncertain terus that he was strictly on his own, and he could do nothing

ie then asked if it would be worthwhile to subpoena Bart Gonzales.

He. inforacd hin that it was up to his attorney to make such recorrendations.

4..

herbell seered to get the message, and then offered to keep us auvised

regarding an alleged forthcoming attempt on liaiti which is being sponsored by

Rolando Kasferrer-even through Vasferrer is currently incarcerated in a federal

prison. he told werbell that if he wished to pass any inforation along he

would accept it but under no circumstances should ha attent to elicit any

information an our behalf. He agreed that he would operate on this basis and

said he night be in touch with us again.

5. In view of Werbell's record we felt that this latest contact should

be a matter of record and that OGC should be inforced of developients.

Systematic Introdustion of Military Judgement

Ly uefinition the neutralization or defeat of

communist terroris: consists of the sociulized application

of inunter insurgency operations by tie exployment of intelli-

yence: aspeinlogical operations; hunter-tiller operations to

include jungle, nountain, sir, riverina, border, and village

scuiit; operations: communications: logistics; specialized

training ani equivrent, and other techniques. SIONICS; Inc.

considers that the technigues designed by our Corporation to

neutralize communist terrorism in the border areas of Thailand

is based on sound past experience in this field and would lead

to the development of a wide-spread organization and system

within the royal Tliai Armed Forces (PaRE), the Border Patrol

FOLiCe (BEP)e and the Thai National Police (TVP) to counteract

this threat throughout the country.

204002642226p4 25

establishmentros a syston ant organization to neutralize

the Communist threat cannot be accomplistied without reliance

on sound and informed military judgement based on proven

techniques. SIONICS, Inc. has pioneeres in the development

of these technigues which permit the systematic development and

use in analysis ant. exccution of

military and technical judge-

m-ment.s

The techniques and equipten: developed for this purpose

are resigned and operate for the "usual of normal" case in which

they will be usedsunder combat conditionse The capability that

accrues fron the employment of these techniques and equipment in

unusual or peculiar situations should te considered a bonus

effect rather than an

expected mode of creration.

6. luture Operations

st the end of phase y the ictay should have proved

itsell as one of thie rost effective counter-insurgency programs

available to tic RIG. My an example, in 6 months operations

the 72 snipers

of the U.S: 9th Division attained over 600

confirmed hills, the majority of which were made at night with

the M-14 rifle/Starlight Scope/SIONICS-il:-A2 suppressor combin-.

ation:

In effecting this admirable record, 1.37 cartridges

were expended per kill. Ati the current cost of 284 for one

National iatch cartridge, this averages to 384 per kill. This

is obviously an oversinplification, but it highlights an extrerely

successful and economical rethod of countering connunist terrorism

along the borders of thailand.

is a final note, this type of operation is as yet

in its nascent stages.

Complete operational techniques that will

result. from execution of the 12 month NCTTT will

undoubtedly

disclose additional and more effective techniques of killing or

neutralizing communist terrorists in Thailand and will contribute

inneasurably to bringing stability and RTG control into its

border areas.
