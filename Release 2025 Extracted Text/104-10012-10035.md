Mr. Blackshire told me he will give the telegran to Department

MI. John M. Price

District Attorney

Sacramento, California

Dear Mr. Price:

This is a retyped letter.

I visited Mr. Ferry, Deputy District

Attorney, on August 16, 1977;

•I told in the office

that F.B.I. agente and

Secret Service use police department to harass me.. Police department do

supply pencil of anesthesia

gas to the manager of the building I live. The

manager do.or use certain people, to freeze me by anesthesia gas - then pusti

drugs, poison in my mouth to torture me

- to take my aleep away - or bleed

by rectal and they use many other chemicals to brainwash'me to use me in

political assassination which I refused, On January 20, 1976 in Sacramento on

8th and I Streets, man cane to me from police or post office, U.S. Department

of Justice and freeze me by gas and told me to take gun, pistol and we will

tell you where to go to shoot - to kill - Mr. Sargent Shriver.:

I refused.

Manager, Mr. Sisel, of Marshall Hotel, call on the man to tell me this on

the street.

In February 1976, police intelligence told me that assassination

will not happen here..

How about to move to Maryland state.

In this letter I ask you to get report from DI. Frederick

• So

Baker,

M.D.

- colon and rectal surgery on January 31, 1978. His phone - 452-4095. I do

bleed today very much and I am weak, In this letter I ask you to give re

strain order or respond to me what could be done. The right wing in America

made record to use me in assassination. I refuse. I an human and I like to

be treated as human. Police put frame up on me - just to take advantages on

me. Police use lie, police use mental case to take advantages on me and tell

me that right wing do use such people like me.

To prove I enclose copy nid-

night June 14, 1976. Also I enclose copy letter I sent to Mr. Ted Sheedy,

Supervisor, on January 26, 1978 and copy of his reply to me.

Please respond to me. Thank you.

Very truly court
