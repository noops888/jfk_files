HIMLA • 345311

According to reports subnitted to Wallace B. ROSTON by

LIRING 3, the latter set Carlos Nanuel Persaval Marcue origizally

through the latter's sister-in-law, CarmeriLozada de Ranirez,

who had been carrying on an extra-marital affair pith LIRIiG3

since early jorcaber 1927.

On the evening of 3 Karch 1960,

Persaval approacned LIRISG3 in connection

with the difficulties

that a young Guatenalan wonan living in lexico City vas having

in ostaining false documentatior to enable her to travel to

Guatemala

to recontact her husband,

whon Persaval described as

"an iportant

guerrilla leader"

Persaval revealed to LIBISG?

that he had been assisting the FAR in propaganda work in lexico

for some time and

gave LIRING3 several copies of a paaphlet

"Violencia en Guatemala" which Persaval said had been

published on one

of his uncle's presses and sas being sold at tie

nominal price of three lexican pesos to help raise money for itke

favorably to this initial appras's,

and finally, on

that he vas in touch with tho

"i=p==*==1

in returning

clandestinely to Guaterala.

asked LIRING-3 to arrange

to guide these persons across the Guatenalan border south of

Chiapas, an

area LIRING3 had previously told Persaval be was very

faniliar with fron his previous residence in San Cristobal.

Persaval made no further reference to the

"young Guateszlan nife

of the FAR leader®

LIRING3 surmised to ROWTON that this person

might actually have been the wife of Francisco Lara Barrios, but

that plans for her return mere discarded in favor of the trip

by lara himself.

At ROATO''s urging, LIRING3 insisted on seeting the tro

and in talking to then before undertaking

such a mission.

Persaral finally introduced LIRISG-3 to Francisco

Lara Barrios on 17 March 1968, and the latter presented LIRING-3

nane ofySandoval.

Francisco Lara Barrios confided to LIRING3

that he had in his possession a false Guatenalan passport in the

nare of Jose Maria Oliva Carranza and that he had obtained legal

residence in Mexico with his wife and children through the efforts

of ex-Hexican President Lazaro Cardenas.

He also naned a certais

y Eskenazi and LIREBEL-1 as persons voo assisted Guatenalan exiles

• in lexico.

Station believes Eskenazi nay be identical with

Luis David Eskenassy Cruz, a former agent of the Guatenala City

With the approval of ROSTON, LIRING3 agreed to help

the above-mentioned persons to cross the Mexican/ Guatemalan border

and to accompany them to Guatemala City.

This latter extension of

the original trip was nade by Lara at the suggestion of LIBING 3

so that the latter could neet with the FAR voran responsible for

logistics.

LIRING3 reported to RONTOY subrequently that just

before their departure, Lara also offered to arrange for LIRING3

to travel clandestinely to the Sierra de las Minas to neet directly

with FAR and 13th of lovember leaders to discuss further support

that LIRING 3 might be able

to provide through his comercial

contacts in Chiapas and northern lexico.

LIRING 3 fabricated a false Nexican Identity document

Education) for Francisco Lara Barrios in the

name of Jacinta Rangel Cervantes with Lara slightly disguised so

could nore about more unobtrusively on the besican

side of the border just prior to crossing.

inforned LIRISG3 that their autual friend Rodolfo Sandoval.

would not be accorpanying then since he was too well known and

his mission mas not important enough to justify the risk and the

expense involved.

7.

LIRiNGS did not depart as

he had hoped on 5 April 1968,

because Lara unfortunately accidentally shot himself in the ankle

on the norning of that day while clening his gus and had to be.

given medical attention before he could make the trip.

LIRING4

told RONTOY that LIRISG3, Francisco Lara and Rail Storeno, a

friend of LIRISG3, finally left lexico City in the personal

car of Paul Moreno

on 10 april 1958. but that Moreso had returned

to Mexico City two days later as a result of an accident that

disabled the car sorewhere in Chiapas.

LIRING, did not report

anything concerninz the subsequent intolvesent of Carlos Persaval

Marcue,

stating that she ind not received any ccinication

fron

LIRING3 after his telegram of 12 April, in which de reported

the return of Raul Moreno.

RONTOS surnises that rien Raul

Moreno tad to return to lexico Ciïy. LIRING3 a=d Lara asked

Carlos Persaval Marcue to join then and drive then to the border

1=11=

and that porcaval continued on with them torard

Guatemala City.

8.

Guatemala City Station advised on 22 April 1968,

the story of

the arrest of Lara, Persaval and LIZING3 had reached

the local press and that they would se turned over to the appro

priate courts

this indicates

that LIRIIG3 may

eventually be

released and bence be arailable to BONTON for

complete debriefing.

9.

The only significant nare that had surface as a result

of LIRISG3'S involvement with the Guatemalan reseis in Mexico

City is that of Rolando kendez Aguilar,

whon frascisco Lara

Barrios contacted on 45-60-30 extension 27, in early April from

the home telephone of LIRIJG3.

"Publicaciones

(This number corresponds to the

e Impresiones Mexicazas, S.d. - Diario Ovaciores,

From the LIFEAT coverage

On LIRING3 it

is apparent that Mencez is a close contact of

both Lara and

Sandoval

and say be providing of tave provided

emplorent for them in

The Station is zitempting to

determine the home address of

kendez in the hope that further

details of his possible collaboration may be uncorered.

On 8 March 1968 PERSAVAL told LIRING-3 that two (2)

Guatenalan revolutionaries had need to travel to Guatemala

LIRING-3 commented that there was limited

possibility of obtainirg false docusents, but that he could

brief the Guatemalans so as to facilitate their illegal

crossing of the Mexican/Guatemalan border, or if they desired,

he would guide them.

On 9 March 1968, PERSAVAL again discussed the

Since the other person has no such

The group is of the opinion that LIRING-3 should also go to

Departure was delayed because LARA sustained a self-

and LIRING 4 did not really know what to expect

from LIRING fros one meeting with its representatives to the

The Station

would like to point out in passing that, in

addition to

cable reporting and dispatches transnitting

contact reports, the operations in which LIRING-3

and LIRING-4 are

involved in are reviewed in sone detail in

the over-all nouthly report submitted by the PBALiEN Section

of this Station.

The last time LIRING 4 accompanied LIRING3 to PBRUMEN,

she obtained an entry visa in a few days.

LIRISG4 thus felt

that as an ex-enployee of LIRING with good connections in

PBRUMEN and LIRING

she would obtain a new PBRUNEY entry visa

Estry visas are now quite a bit more difficult

to obtain, however,

for PPRUMEN nonofficial citizens abroad.

It also appears that the LIRING staff did not really know

what to make of LIRING-4's stated desire to return to PBRUMEN

for an extended period of time, as this was obriously based

on a domestic quarrel.

LIRING-3 and LIRING-4 have had other

quarrels,

one would subside and that LIRING4 would postpone or cancel.

convince

the LIRIG employees, particularly LIRISG2 and

openly question LIRING 4's right to take their child with

Specifically, how did LIRING-3 hear of

the arrest of the LIRING member involved in a subversive case

in 1966, how did he learn of its proposed publication in the

To all these questions LIRING-3 replied by saying that

he had good sources in Vexico and Cestral America and that he

was not about to divulge them to ine Parubmiers.

that he

old cliche, LIRIVG3 "got their message."

RONTOY's introduction to LIRING2 and other LIRING

members by Rodolfo REYES Cortes and his subsequent meetings

with LIRING-2 were bound to make the latter sosewhat curious

about this wealthy Greek businessman and proclaimed friend of

LIRDIC/4 Report of Questioning by LIRIiG/2 re

Rowton

("Ihe üreek";.

1. at 1030 on 17 February, 1963, iIKIIG/4 inforsed Forton that she had

aropped into the Ilatio offices at about 1230 on 15 lebruary and again

on the norning of the folloving day to checs with IIRLiG/2 concercine

her entry permit for travel to javana. Co the first occasion IIRI'G/2

asked her casually bether she had seen anything of the "Greek friend"

lately. IInIiG/4 told noton that she replied that she and LIRIiG/3 heard

fron bit fron tine to time, mainly by telephone, and that he had invited

her out cocasionally, but she,lIR:.G/4, bad turned hin down.

2. De the enoona anceedda, ducáro the late maming de la Poltuary 1029;

LIRT'G/2 saw I/4 again on the prerises and asked to not to leave until

she lad seen him, siace he wented to discuss sonething with ber. wuen ste

fibaliy sa: him in his office some 30 minutes later, he again asted whetaer

she had seen the "freel", not rentioring Bouton by his alias (farris).

Sinse I/2 ned mentioned I/4's Greek friend woon he had net through sodolio

Reyes on a previously occasion, IIfI.G/4 felt she could not preterd 'ot to

knon about whom be ras talking. She therefore replied again that occasional-

15 she neard from his when he was on a trip to Mexico. WNING/2 asked

what Ij4 thought of ain (the Greek), to dico she replied that she

him pleasant and very generous (bondacoso). I/2 replied, "Yes, but

does that generosity come fron?" He thea added that he had many question-

merks concerning that person. He gave as an exazple the lact that ben be

telephoned his nunter on a bolidey, 31 December or 1 acuary, his "secre-

tary" replied. It seened very strange, continued I/2, that the Greek's

telephone was manned at all times, nigkt and day, and even fon holidays.

He then further expressed doubts about where this person lived and bow

he earned his money, and why se was so interested in Cuoa.

3. LIRIIG/4 stated to Reston that she was st first quite taken aback by

this direct "interrogation", even thougb it was nade in a friendly tone,

and replied as best she could by ear. She stated that she assumed the

Greek was carryine on lucrative business and lived in aurope alóbough she

could not supply any specific answers. she was aware that he had brought

some of LIKING/3's paintings at an excellent price and took hisgenerosity

for granted since she enjojed living fron the good business IInING/3 tained

through ain. LInDiG/y then asted If2 why he hinself didn'tido sone checking

too zany other trines to do, and angray, wuen scething smelled bad

("apesta") he jeeps away fron it. illuG/4, coatinuing to take tbe of-

fensive, stated that on several occasions lnthe yast the Greek had invited

her out but sie had not accepted, but teat sie easily could accept on the

next occasion aLd possibly even obtain a photo of some kand for LIu:g/2.

I/2 replied that a paoto would not be of any use, all he could do ita

it teing to send it to Eavana. He added that he had many suspicions,parti-

cularly as a result of the telephone, but hac nothing concrete "i= his

hands", and that what te needed was "datos".

4. LixIiiG/2 then asked 1/4 whether she kned then dodolfo Reyes was return-

ing and where be would be living? she told sowton that she replied in the

negative, cormenting sinply that she had hesid thet he. rould be sovine

to chile to work in the national ballet there. Il2 returning again to the

Greet rondered say ke was so generoas with gifts and entertainment. 1/4

stated that she never looked a fift sorse in the south, to which unliG/?

replied that sie aust be careful, if not for ber oin sake at lease for the

sake of LIRIG/3 woo, ke felt, was not treading on firm ground( "terreno

about wiich be told her almost. nothing. If2 then commented "Invesitigate

the Greek and Jou'il feel better." (iverizua lo del friego). He then added

that toat supposed letter from fico falán vas sot considered autbestic,

and also the case of orozco definitely involvea the police. Il-Ise, since

she was aware that i/3 had discussed both these cases with L/2, except

that 1/3 had not to ber knowledge sentioned the arrest of Crozco, stated

that she felt Is had acted in conpletely 500d faith, even though ie night

have been somewhat inpalsive ("precipitado").

Subject:

SaSalet Exarination of iIaIlG/3.

1. Fros about 1330 artil 1530 on 29 September, 1957, WRING/3 was

given an SiS"IRl examination. Rowton arrived at the safehouse (Tacu-

baya) with the SfüxIRi operator at 0930 that zuruing and remained vith

the operator until the examination was completed. Me had not fiven II-

RIiG/3 any previous notice of the nature or exteat of the 'examination,

but siaply asked his, on 2? September, to keep the entire day of 29 Septen-

ber free for a lezzthy dicussion with Bouton. Zorton introduced the SG-

SwI3L operator as señor ilbertini, a trusted "sccio", and spent the first

hour or so reviering his relationship sith iInIiG/3, ostensibly for the

doubts that he hah in the past concerning iIR:s/3's reporting, stated

that Albertini had a neans of checking scientisfically the trutbfulness

of LIRIXG/3's statenents. Roston explained that be was particularly con-

cerned about the possiblity of LIRI:G/3 having doubled back with inaliG

andraintaining with then a secret agreement of some sort to report on

Rowton and his activities.

2. MIRIIG/3 wet into a state rf visible snock at this and stated that

even the thought of betraying Rowten bad never occurred to hin at any time.

When the SGS"IRL operator explained the scienti?ic means he was to use on

LIRniG/3, the latter stated that he could not pessibly acuept this hunili-

ating means of testing him since it was diarentrically opposed to bis

principles. He pointed out that he had accepted sorton at his word and be

could not see of uderstand by Rowton colld not do the same for his, adding:

that the whole thing snacked of nethods used by «CAJ and LIRIiG. He added

that if this neant that he rould have to breai with Rowton, then regret-

fully he would have to accept this alternative. He explained that submit-

ing to the SGS.iIRe exanination would inevitably destroy the idealistic and

profound relationship which be had previously lelt he enjoyed sita Bouton.

3. Roaton and the girlfl operator spent the next two bours calming LIRING/:.

down and finally convincing him that he would not be compronising vith his

deeply-felt prisciples by taking the test. He at last consented to be ques-

tioned on his lojalty to Routon and insisted that he be asked, "Do you ba-

lieve in kowton?"

4. After a brief break for lunch the exaiination was given inone of the bed-

ro:me «lf the apartment while Roston vaited in the living room. LIaING/3

appeared to be in reasosably good spirits after the test, although

he was obviously enotionally strained by the experience. Rowton made

a date to see him again that evening at 2100 tn talk things over in

a clater atrosphere.

5. ht that neeting with WIRit,3 howton explained that he had felt it

necessary to ascertain as oujectively as possiblg the extent of LIRIliG/3'8

loyalty to him and he was happy to have scientifi. proof that LIRIIG/3

bad not berayed his to the IIRIliG's. LIPIiG/3 statea that after it vas

all over he felt letter and admitted that he agreed with Rowton on the

necessity for such an examiliation, husiliating as it night at first baze

De confeered that any lennone" feebstentione and matceton)

that he had nade in the fast, were due to his intense desire to produce

for Roston, since he still felt very sensitive about having to accept soney

Iron Boston dithout being able to render commensurate services.: He stress-

ed, however, that at no time bad he ever been disloyal to Rowton or done

anything against horton's interest, as señor Albertini could prove with

the results of the SGS.IRL. LIRING/3 promised in the future to follow Row-

ton's direction strupulously and assured Rowton that he no longer feit.

wades any compulsion to exaggerate or fabricate anything to impress Borton.

6. Headquarters and the Station may find the SGStIRL examination disappohn-

ting in its limited coverage, but it lust be realized that LIRING/3's..

initial reaction das entirely negative and at one point be treatened to.

break off completely with Routon because of the insult to his "dignity".

Although the SGsit?I operator felt that from a professional standpoint it

would be better to administer the exasiration at another time when LIBING/3

vas less enotionally upset, Rowton asked both him and LIRärG/3 to 50 thru

with it on the spot, feeling that psychologically it was' essential to

nake IIFING/3 sub=it, even for a limited test. Rout:n also feels that the

test did serve as a very favorably deterrent over üRlliG/3 in the future,

Maen a second one can be more painlessly aduinistered, la a calmer atros-

phere. It, of course, also covered the very pertinent question of whether

WIRING/3 had been an LIRING double agent or betrayed Rowton in any way.

Until recently REYES has received the

thousand pesos from the Cuban government,

government personalities in Cuba.

As pointed out in Reference:

ROWTON found REYES to be apolitical, a superficial sympathizer of

the Cuban revolution and a great admirer of American choreography

(he told ROKTOY he would very much like to go to Jew York to see

some of the shows there.) REYES complained about the relatively

low salary he is currently receiving from the liexico City Belies

Artes for organizing a Cuban Ballet Folklorico show to be held

in Mexico City next December. He readily agreed to ROWTON's offer

At a private lunch with Carmen HOLINA, 28 Cctober,

RONTON explained that he was a Greek leftist (although not a

Report of LIKING/3 Suspect Affiliatior with leziam.

1. LIRING/3 reported to dorton at 6900 on 30 Cote: er, 1967, that be

had finally tenged to have a private talk with Rodolfo! Reyes fortes,

his Mexican chereographer friend, ou the afternoon of 27 October, 1967;

and that, it the course of conversation, rodolfo dejes had revealed

to LIRING/3 in confidence tart the reason way the ilLiNGS had assuned

a rather cool attitude toward LIRIlG/3 over the past year.

Zodolfo

Reyes explaised that the last time he was in avana be bad heard rumors,

arong his frienas in the Mexican colony, that LIRIJG/3 was working

"either for MurI'M or the Cubans". Rodolfo went os to

say that the

oragan of tois rumor, as lar as he could ascertain, was the fact that

WRiG/3 had nade two trips into Havana for no know specificreason and

at his own espense. Rodolfo Reyes, indicating that de himself did not

believe the runors of, at least, did not care whether they kere true or

not, commented to LIRING/3 that other menbers of LIPING/3's profession

were naturally jealous of the success of anyone of their group and vere

always quick to draw their own couclusions.

2. LIRIN:/3 co-mented to Ronton that, although this news had shaken bii

and LIRING/4 badly at the time, neither of them cared particularly wast

the LInIliGs thought of them, since their en conscience meg cleer.. II-

RING/3 added that it was important, however, to continue to develop his

comercial activity in Chiapas ( especially since accolfo Reyes' home is

by coincidence

Locateà in San Cristobal) so that "ord would gradually.

filter back to the lliliûs that he actually did have financial resources

outside his art production. LIRIlG/3 continued that obviously the LIRIüGs

did not have any specific proof or they would long ago have cut off all

contact with him as well as LIRING/4. He concluded that since the LIliGs

hao

certain suspicions, they navurally warned all bis friends and forzer

contacts (iscluding, of course, irnol Rodriquez)

to avoid close contact

with him until their doubts could be resolved.

3. In reply to howton's query LIRING/3 stated that dodolfo Rejes and Caruen

Molina (separately) had commented to hin that they ¡ere favorably impresseu

by Routon ard did not voice any suspicion of ñowton's bona fides (as a

Greek leftist businesswan). Caruen Mohina, in fact, had gone so far as to

dealing with him. Carren Holina connented to LIlu/3 that sae felt

sure she could belp loston in his business acd political problems and

at the Baüe time make a little auch-needed money for ker own living

expenses.

4. IIRIiiC/3 continued that he had been maintaining jiscreet personal

contact with Carmen Lozada over the week-end (he commented that iIRlNG/4

has already shown sone signs of lealousy and there?ore he iad to be careful

not to_give ber-cause to-distrust.him). IIII3/3 stated_-that-carmen.I0--

zada had told bin that ber father, a well-to-do Mexican doctor residing

in Coyacan, had renarried tand that her step-nother vas a Cuban sicentist

m i tri Mexico. She added that both her father and

step-ustber dere on excellent social terns with Ambassador Herzández Armas.

She revealed that she nad already notified her husbard, inrique Ranirez,

th-t she intended to divorce him, and she expected a storm of protest both

fros him (in Havana) and her father and step-nother, both of whos were

"puritanic" despite their "progressive" convictions. She added that she

expected Enrique Ramirez to rush over from Havana as soon as he received

her letter and to appeal to her father and step-other to save his nar-

riage. She, however, insisted to LIRING/3 that she had sade up her mind

that she would so through with the divorce. She added taat for this reason

she did not wish to live with her father and had decidel to stay with:

her friend, Carnen Molina, until the divoce papers sere through and the

store had blow over. She added that she did not particularly like being

a house-guest in the suali aprtment of Carmen riolina, but at the sonent

she had no choice.
