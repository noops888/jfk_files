MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

PDLADLE: Outside Lawyer to Draw Up

Deed of Trust

1. PDLADLE is a high-level defector residing in New York who has

had advanced to him a number of large "loans" over the years, in addition

to his "salary." Some of these monies have gone into the purchase of

some real estate in the State of New York. The Agency now wants a

Deed of Trust executed in favor of one of its nominees on the New York

real property.

2. Possible lawyers to handle drafting the Deed of Trust are:

a. (Natalie Koether), a cleared N.Y. lawyer, on whom FR

Division has an operational approval.

They have an active

interest in using her and her husband. If Ms. Koether is

used on the Deed of Trust, FR would lose an asset. Were it

not for our rule of no operational use of cleared attorneys,

ER apparently (accordingly to Eric Sowers) has no objection

toMs. Koether's drawing up the Deed of Trust;

b.

another cleared lawyer. The clearance on any such lawyer

would have to be updated by Security. The best candidate

Bill Ashbaugh and I were able to locate off the Cleared Attorneys

Panel was Richard C. Kullen, Jr., OS #651 162), last cleared

21 March 1975;

06,08

c.

the case officer for PDLADLE, MONCURE, who is apparently

a practicing N.Y. lawyer who at one time worked for the Agency.

This idea was suggested by Vasia Gmirkin of CI Staff, the

client component on the Deed of Trust. The idea would be that

since MONCURE already knows that PDLADLE and MONCURE

would be used only on this PDLADLE job, the security and cover

problems normally associated with allowing cleared attorneys

to become involved in operations would not be as pronounced as

d.

usual. On the other hand, his prior association with the Agency

could jeopardize PDLADLE if drafting the Deed of Trust exposes

MONCURE to more scrutiny than his present association with

PDLADLE already does; and

an attorney from OGC. N.Y. mortgage law would have to be

researched to try to make the Deed of Trust freely assignable from

one CIA nominee to another. N.Y. form books should be easily

locatable in the D.C. law libraries. If the Deed of Trust follows N.Y.

form, would the fact that the OGC lawyer is not licensed in N.Y.

in any way throw doubt on the document? When might the name

of the lawyer who drafted the document come to light?
