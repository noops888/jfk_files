Mights to worth Pole 12 were undertaken earlier than those

to Norta Pole 10 probably because the airstrip was ruady sooner.

October, personnel responsible for directing flights, arrived at worth Pole

12 aboard II-2 Cu205.

On 19 October It was roported that the airstrip

reasured 2952 & l64 feet and was ready to receive a trial flight by an IL-ll

in the daytina. On 20 Cetober two IL-l's began resupply operationg frun

Mgg Shmidts and Sonitelnaya.

Supply flights to North Pole 10 by LI-2 04205

commenced on 20 October.

On 25 October, Il-lus woro schoduled to fly there from

Mys Koristy and Chaluskin.

Itsappears, judging from the usage of cover

numbers, that the drift stations each have two airstrips, and that to dats,

all are capable of taking il-ll aircraít..

In September the Sorieto repo-ted that preparation of an airstrip at

orth Pola 10 capable of taii z neary alrcraft vasto be undertaken.

The

description hear; aircraft

typo, hut it 1s evident, to ate at least, that no such aireraft has

visited the drift station.

turing the past i days, five fA Ials

hara been jerrying supplies to tie ice islands at a very higi: rate.

The transports carried furl, food, instruments and persounel to orth

Pole 10 fron Hus Chelriskin and to worth Pola 12 Dras lus Suridla. JiA

support of the fall high latitude expediion exceeds that of any previous

expedition. On 1B Hoverber the Insation si the drift stations were:

terinated. The alort, ap-

parently prompled by Presiilent Kennedy'g death on 22 Notember, was possibly pre-

scheduled to teminate on ::5 lorenter. There have been two orders wich subest

that the alert tas destived to be concluded on 25 November: They ares

1) Access to the coastal observation post at Punta Naisi (20-151 74-09w) was

restricted until 25 itovember because of tbe alert.

2) Subordinatry of Banes, Isadquarters Eastero Naval Mistrict, vere to raceive

further orders on the 25th, presumably concerning their alert ststus; so such orders

bave boon noted in communications.

There bave been no furthor referancos in intercepted communications to tha

alert since 02222 on 23 Hovember.

It is possible that the restricted access to tie observation post at Punta

lalsi extends to other observatior posts in (rienta Province such as reported on

2? lovenber when first Army Coastal Observation Posta vere placed in alert status,

and that the restriction was to be lifted = 25 November by all those posts.

Further indications that the alert was terminated is the fact that the Cuban

lary was en aged in an island-udde connunications exorcire on 25 November. It 13

considered unlikely that such an exercise would be conducted under aiert conditions,

There have been no furthor references to the alert status of the (D Percent

Santlajo de Cuba) units bich was first obsorrod on 23 November. All CRAF and

Sordet Forces Cuba Communications appear to be normal during this perfod,
