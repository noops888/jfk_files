OCCURRENCE: The Special Group heard Mr. Merchant state his opinion that the only

solution is to move the Guatemalan train activities to the United States even though

the U. S. could probably not get away with this either.

A number of alternative

base sites for the training of the Cubans was considered both in the United States,

in Puerto Rico, lat the CA site on

or in the Panama Canal zone. Mr. Douglas

felt the "U. s.'

capability for interven

ion in Cuba will probably not be effective

enough unless there is more overt participation than has been contemplated to date."

"Mr. Grey supported this general position, stating that when the current Cuban

plan was approved, the situation in that country was different than it is now.

Since then, the Cubans have received sizeable amounts of bloc arms and have or-

ganized

a malitia.

Mr. Gray wondered how a few hundred exiles could be."

"Mr. Mann expressed the opinion that the way to proceed is to seal Cuba off from

the rest of Latin America and settle down for a one- or two-year wait..."

"The Attorney General inquired

The AG and Johnson emphasize need to obtain hard intelligence on subversive activities

by Castro in the hemisphere.

A complete review of MONGOOSE was set toward the end of

OCCURRENCE: President Kennedy's visit to Mexico greatly enhanced U.S. goodwill in

Mexico.

It fulfilled U.S. plans to impress upon Castro that Mexico is solidly with the

United States and the West.

State believes this should ease the way for future discussions

about Cuba with the Mexicans.

Re: Operation MONGOOSE, the joint communique issued by

President Kennedy and President Lopez Mateos included a phrase which was

'They proposed

to respect and maintain the principles of non intervention--whether this intervention

may come from a continental or extracontinental state--and of self-determination of

peoples." In response to a Lansdale query, the Department of State noted that "There

were no developments resulting from the President's trip to Mexico including the text

of the joint United States-Mexico communique which alter the basic guidelines which govern

the Cuba Project." Lansdale noted that the CIA now had 45 Asians in Havana operating.
