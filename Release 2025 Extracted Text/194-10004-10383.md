ment concerning Manuel MARTI.

Source, who was associated with MARTI as

a co-worker at Mutual Insurance Advisory Association from April 1965 to

May 1968, stated substantially as follows:

Source first met SUBJECT in April 1965, when he interviewed MARTI

for employment at Mutual Insurance Advisory Association, and maintained

daily business contact with SUBJECT throughout HIS period of employment

with the aforementioned organization. Source had no social contact

with SUBJECT,

and last saw MARTI in May 1968 when HE departed the organi-

zation on military leave.

SUBJECT was employed at Mutual Insurance Advisory Association

from 5 April 1965 to 20 May 1968. HE was originally hired as a Utility

Clerk. HE was subsequently promoted to Utility Clerk Supervisor and later

to Tabulating Machine Operator.

MARTI enjoyed an excellent reputation

among HIS associates at HIS place of employment and everyone was sorry to

see HIM leave. Source would be happy to re-employ SUBJECT upon termination

of HIS military service.

SUBJECT was single and resided with HIS parents in Bronx, New York,

further details unknown.

SUBJECT'S mother, name unknown, died in

late

Source

SUBJECT'S personal background, but believed that SUBJECT was of Puerto

Rican decent.

42

SUBJECT is of excellent character, integrity, discretion and morals.

HE is financially

responsible,

and had no

known difficulty with law enforce-

ment agencies during the period of association. SUBJECT manifested no un-

desirable personal habits, nor any sign of immaturity or emotional instability.

by HIS parents.

MARTI was never heard to express any radical political

views, and Source considers HIM to be pro-democratic in HIS political views

and loyal to the United States. SUBJECT has no known organizational

affiliations, and Source had no knowledge concerning HIS foreign travels,

foreign interests or relatives residing abroad.

Cassidy highly recommends that MARTI be favorably considered for

a position of trust

and responsibility with the unitea tates overnment.
