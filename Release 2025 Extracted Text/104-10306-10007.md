.?.

1 October 1963

NOTES FOR MR. McCONE:

98

1. DDP has prepared for your information a summary of General

Chiang Ching-kuo's visit to the U.S. Attached to this summary

are the four most important papers as follows:

a.

Your position paper;

b. CIA commitments paper;

c. Memorandum for the record on DDP briefings;

d. Record of conversation with the President.

The visit is considered to have been a success and Chiang Ching-kuo

returned with an understanding that any abrupt move by his govern-

ment to recover the mainland with military force would not be

supported by this country. Chiang Kai-shek has accepted the position

paper and CIA's commitments paper, and our station is now working

out cooperation on intelligence and operational activities against the

mainland. ]

2. In commenting on the proposal to send Dr. Cavanagh

Rome, Bill

Harvey suggests that Cavanagh be certified to the Vatican as your

personal representative, and suggests you might do this through

Cardinal Cicognani or Archbishop O'Connor. Request your guidance.

3. DDP has run another assessment of the reliability of the documentars

naterial provided by Penkovskiy and see no reason to change their

statement of 31 May to USIB that it was "a most serious penetration

of Soviet officialdom and one that will hurt them for years to come"'.

Helms suggests you have this assessment checked with DDI and OSI

and if they concur, re-assure USIB along the above lines.

4.

Dez FitGerald briefed the Joint Chiefs recently on his overall program

against Cuba. In the discussion the main thing that emerged was

General LeMay's view that the present program was far too small to
