MEMORANDUM FOR:

FROM:

SUBJECT:

Executive Director

Assassination Records Review Board

John F. Pereira

Central Intelligençe Agency

Reconsideration of Releases in Scelso

Testimony and Lopez Report

(We request that this memorandum be returned to CIA

once the Board has completed its deliberations on the issues

discussed below.)

1 e-

(S) Issue. This memo is to request that the JEK

Board reconsider its decision to release certain information

contained in the HSCA testimony of John Scelso and in the

Lopez Report.

Specifically CIA requests that the phrases

"political action program"

pg. 64 Scelso Testimony, pg.

177, 178 Lopez Report) ; "Mexican police" (pg. 85 Scelso

Testimony); and "is exposed by Agee in his book" (pg. 141.

Scelso Testimony (be postponed from release.

We also offer

some suggestions

"for substitute language which we believe

will not detract from the JFK assassination story, yet still

protect the information at issue.

I. Mexican Political Action Program

"We were running, at that time, a vast political action

program in Mexico City to try to swing Mexico around from

its Leftist direction to a middle of the road direction and

it succeeded. I don't know whether you informed yourself

about the magnitude of our political action program there at

the time -- absolutely enormous"

(Scelso, 64; Lopez, PP. 177, 178)

2.

(S) From the early 1950's to the mid-1960's,

Mexico City Station conducted a political action campaign to

minimize leftist influence on and within the Mexican

Government. The campaign utilized student groups, a front

group of progressive businessmen, and Catholic lay group

writers and operatives in political action and media

placement efforts.

The Station currently does not have a

political action program designed to influence Mexican

politics, nor has it undertaken such activity anytime in the

recent past. Nevertheless, any public confirmation by the

U.S. Government of those activities would risk an adverse

reaction.

Such adverse reaction would impact on current

Mexico City Station operations and be harmful to U.S.

interests.

3. (S) As has been described to the Board in previous

briefings by the temierVeranch chief, Mexicans guard their

sovereignty carefully.

Nothing will infuriate them more

than allegations of CIA meddling in their internal politics.

In fact, earlier this year,

the Mexican Government postponed

a visit to Mexico by the DCI for fear that it might be

perceived (and exploited) by the Mexican media and political

opposition as the CIA being called in to assist with

handling the problem of the Peoples' Revolutionary Army.

4 .

(S) The fact that the CIA activity to which the

Mexicans would object occurred more than 30 years ago will

not lessen the reaction. Release of the Scelso comments

would risk an adverse reaction from the Mexicans, which

would likely include calls for an examination by the Mexican

Government of current CIA activities.

This could lead to

increased scrutiny of Station operations and personnel and

could jeopardize our unilateral activities.

It could also

have a chilling effect on activities conducted jointly with

the Mexican services, who will be reluctant to engage in

programs that could become subject to public scrutiny and

political debate.

(S) Furthermore, the fact that these statements

were made by scelso

amounts to an official confirmation of

the underlying facts, making it very difficult for ClA to

protect the same or similar information from further release

in the future. Speculation in books, articles, and other

publications, or disclosures by Congress are often perceived

by the public as evidence that that information is in the

public domain and therefore is no longer classified.

The

CIA has nevertheless been able to legally protect the

information from unauthorized disclosure.

The courts have

held that because there has been no official confirmation,

the information at issue even when there has been widespread

public discussion on the issue in question.

(S) In this case, should there by

as to the classification status of documents on the

question raised

political program referred to by Scelso, it would be

difficult to convince a court that such information had not

been declassified because of the release by the Board.

Scelso was a long-time CIA employee who was in charge

of the

investigation by the Agency into the assassination of the

President, and his testimony was taken under oath, with the

knowledge-of the Agency, and in a classified setting.

Furthermore, the attached letter to Louis Stokes, Chairman

of the Select Committee on Assassination from former Acting

DCI Frank Carlucci also indicates that Scelso was acting as

an official of the CIA. The DCI states that any classified

testimony made by Agency staff before the Committees would

be considered "authorized provision" of the information.

This was to ensure that "all persons respond fully and

truthfully" to the Committee.

Carlucci's letter,

especially

taken together with the first few pages of Scelso's

testimony, make it clear

that Scelso was speaking as an

official of the CIA.

scelso's statemento were not

A court would, therefore, probably find that

just merely speculation by a

former Agency employee, but in fact, were official

confirmation of the political action program.

Anything

suggesting official confirmation of classified information

would lead a judge to the conclusion that the information at

issue had been declassified by the CIA.

This would make it

very difficult for CIA to continue to protect this

information from unauthorized disclosure.

When confusion

arises as to the classification status of information, it

could lead to complicated legal proceedings and protracted

and unnecessary litigation at great expense to all parties.

II. Liaison with Mexico

"We did not have any source of Cuban employees. We only had

Mexican police"

...We had a whole reporting set up there with

that, two of them, who watched things like that. (Scelso pg.

185).

8.

(S) Release by the Board of Scelso's comments about

the Mexican police in conjunction with surveillance coverage

of the Mexico City airport could similarly have a chilling

effect on our current liaison relationship with the Mexicans.

The Station has worked, and continues to work, with liaison

against compatible targets, including tracking the arrival

and departure at the Mexico City airport of targets of

interest.

Although the targets have obviously changed since

the time that Scelso is speaking of, these surveillance

operations are ongoing.

The success of these current joint

operations could be threatened by any revelation today of

Mexican cooperation with the CIA in the past.

9.

(S) CIA objects to this release on similar grounds

as stated in the prior section - disclosure of the: Scelso

comments would constitute official acknowledgment by CIA of

the assistance provided by Mexican liaison to the Agency.

Such acknowledgment could affect not only current operations

described above,

but also result in reluctance by Mexican

liaison to provide similar assistance in the future.

The

Mexican Government would likely be subject to criticism by

groups and individuals opposed on nationalism and

sovereignty grounds to such close cooperation with the U.s.

Government and, even more so, with the CIA. The continued

success of CIA cooperation with the Mexicans, whether it be auy ulter

with the Brasident, the intelligence service, or tire pottee,

depends on the fact that those relationships

are, and

continue to be, secret.

10.

(S) CIA requests that the Board continue to

withhold this phrase from release and substitute in "other

cutty

sources" or something similar to this.

Omitting the fact

that the airport information was obtained from Mexican

counterparts would probably leave the impression that the

information was obtained unilaterally.

Although this still

presents some risk to national security, it does achieve

some level of protection to the Station's equities with

liaison.

III. Phillip Agee

(S)

"That is, the variety and number of telephone

taps, surveillance teams, photo operations and other

technical operations is exposed by Agee in his book. That

exceeds anyplace else that we had in the world by a

lot..."

(Scelso, pg. 141)

11. (S) CIA objects to the release of the highlighted

phrase because, for reasons described in Section 1, it

amounts to official CIA confirmation of the existence of a

teltap operation conducted jointly with the Mexicans and

with close collaboration with the President of Mexico.

this Board is well aware, CIA has consistently requested,

the protection of liaison involvement in this teltap

operation. As the Board has agreed with CIA's position on

this matter, the only issue is whether this statement

reveals what we have agreed meets the criteria for continued

protection under the JFK Act.

12.

(S) For the Board's convenience, several relevant

pages from Agee's book (Inside the Company: CIA Diary) are

attached.

These pages explain in great detail the teltap

operation and the fact that it was conducted jointly between

the CIA and the Mexicans.

former employees are disturbing, they do not amount to

official confirmation of the underlying information.

Standing by itself, Agee's book can be dismissed by the

Agency as speculation, and do not compromise CIA's ability

to keep the information classified.

Scelso's testimony,

however, amounts to official confirmation of Agee's book,

and does effect the Agency's ability to protect the

information from-further release.

Equally troubling is the

fact that Scelso's testimony could be read to confirm not

only what is accurate in Agee's book, but also what is

inaccurate.

12. (S) Furthermore, the language used by Scelso is

clear.

does

The use of the phrase "exposed by Agee in his book"

not allow for any other interpretation except that

Agee's description of the teltap is accurate.

If Scelso had

used other language, such as

"has been written about

elsewhere", the existence of the joint teltap operation

would be protected.

We request that the Board protect the

phrase as it is and use the above substitute language.

Such

substitute language would not alter the story of the JEK

Assassination, yet would still allow for the protection of

the joint operation.

13. (S) While the connection between Agee's book and

Scelso's testimony may at first seem attenuated, anyone

involved in the review process conducted by this Board will

know that it is not.

Many individuals follow the decisions

of this Board closely, and Agee's writings about the CIA are

also well known.

It is to be expected that those who read

the Scelso report would then turn to Agee's book.

wording changes so as not to offend "the Board" so you may not notice much change. The biggest substantive change was on my FOlA

section (I have skillfully crafted this section to avoid the use of that four letter word!). Please note there is one more paragraph now

Meeting with ARRB Staff

1.

Thursday afternoon I met with Dave Marwell,

Executive Director for the ARRB, and two of his staff,

I briefed them on the four

releases in the Lopez Report and Scelso Testimony that had

been identified as potential appeal items, and on the

Agency's concerns re the Australian documents?

I requested

that the Board reconsider the release of the

statements; on

Mexico City political action programs,

Scelso's comment on

Agee, the reference to the Mexican Police as a source and

Warrenton as site of the Agency's Record Center.

2. Marwell agreed to send a "staff recommendation" to

the Board recommending that they delay the release of these

four items to hear additional evidence from the Agency.

The

rest of the Lopez Report and Scelso Testimony would be

released on schedule.

If the Board accepts the staff's

recommendation, the four items will be addressed at

the next.

Washington

meeting

(27 September).

If the Board rejects the

staff's recommendation, then we have the option of appealing

to the President.

Marwell and Gunn seemed confident that

the Board would agree to delay the release.

3. Gunn requested that the Agency's additional

evidence on these four items (if provided in writing) be to

the ARRB staff by 23 September.

The Agency can also brief

the Board members at the

septemoer meeting.

As "I"""

issues and OGC (Linda C.) will take the lead on

Agee. I will contact the DA/IRO (Don Hatch) on the[ Warrenton

issue.

4. Concerning the Australian documents, Marwell agreed

to delay Board action until the 16 October meeting.

The

Agency's proposal on these documents should be sent to the

ARRB staff as soon as possible.

Mr. Scelo.

Yes.

Now, why did they not report everything they found out?

MI. Goldsmith. Answer your own question.

Mr. Scelo. The telephone center envoy was manned by

principally Mexican supervision

san american, or Mexican- o

American.

These people were just inundated with information

and apparently did not extract this and transmit it back to

Washington.

The later contacts with the Cuban Embassy, and so on,

which only were divulged after the assassination. It is

an

enormous problem. Mexico had one of the biggest and most!

active telephone intercept operations in the whole worla

and the job of processing this material is just impossible.

Mr. Goldsmith. Let's go through this step by step,

although I was not going to do this at this time. I am going

to modify the line of inquiry somewhat.

Do you know how many telephone intercepts there were

in the Mexico City station?

Mr. Scelo. How many lines were being tapped?

MI. Goldsmith. Yes, at the Cuban and then at the soviet.

Mr. Scelo. I think there are about 80?lines being tapped

altogether. That is just the number that sticks in my mina.

MI. Goldsmith. Thirty meaning a total of thirty from du

both the Soviet and the Cuban?

MI. Scelo. And various security suspects.

MI. Goldsmith. Would the security suspects to related

to the Soviet or Cuban?

Mr. Scelo. Some of them were American Communists

living there whom we tapped at the specific request of J.

Edgar Hoover.

Mr. Goldsmith. Of those thirty lines now many, at your sle

best estimate, would have been for the Soviet and Cubans?

Mx. Scelo. However many outside telephone lines they

had.

MI. Goldsmith. You think just about every outside

phone?

MI. Scelo. I think they tapped all the outside lines.

Mr. Goldsmith. How certain of that are you?

Mr. Scelo. Well, this is just based on my recollection,

going back 15 years.

Mr. Golasmith. In any event, your ea-lier comment was

that the telephone surveillance operation in Mexico City

was one of the most extensive in the world?

Mr. Scelo. Yes. And of course, they taped a great

deal which they could not exploit. They could not later

listen to it; they did not have time. They used to listen

to it sort of spottily, you see, and attempt then to expioit

what was the most important.

ME. Goldsmith. Is the Mexico City's station's operations

one of the most sensitive of all of the stations at the

Agency?

MI. Scelso. It was then. That is; the variety and

number of telephone taps, surveillance teams, photo operations

and other technical operations

is exposed by Agee inthis

book

That exceeds anyplace else that we had in the world

by a lot. There is no other station in the world that has

that good operations.

Then came Caracas.

That got to be real good. Nothing

like it in Europe.

Mr. Goldsmith. I would like to draw your attention to

cable which, unfortunately, I do not have with me.

The cable

is referred to in Book 5 of the Senate report, written by

Thomas Karamessinas to the Mexico City station in which he

indicate and said the arrest of sylvia Deran would jeepordize

U.S. freedom of action.

Do you remember that cable?

Mr. Scelso. Yes. *

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know why it was sent?

MI. Scelso. At that time, we were not sure that oswald

miget not have been a Cuban agent, and the arrest of a

foreign consular person was quite a serious matter under

international law.

Although Sylvia Duran was a Mexican citizen, I believe,

nevertheless, I did not think -- Karamessinas may not have

Another important operation directed against the Cubans fi

for Stan Archenhold,f the case officer who conceived it h

operation consisted of a series of letters sent to the Cuban intell,

gence service in their Mexico City Embassy from a person v

purported to be a CIA officer trying to help them. The letter

purport to implicate Joaquin Ordoqui, a respected, old-gus.

leader, of the Cuban Communist Party and a high-ranking mit

tary leader, as a CIA agent. The letters are based on informatio

irom Carlos Manuel Pellecer, the Guatemalan exile and penetr

tion agent, who was closely associated with Ordoqui and Marcos

Rodriguez when all three lived in Mexico City during the late

1950s. The letters continue to be sent to Cuban intelligenoe al

though Ordoqui was arrested in 1964, and the desired contro

versy and dissension in the Cuban revolutionary leadership

followed.

As the cover of Sherry, the chief of the Cuban operations sea

tion, is in the Embassy consular section, he has been able to mod

several of the Cuban consular officers directly. However, his main

agent for direct assessment of the Cubans is Leander Vourvoulias,

Consul of Greece and President of the Consular Corps.

Support Operations

The support operations must also be detailed. The joint opera

tion for telephone tapping, LIENVOY, is effected in cooperation

With the Mexican authorttes aud has a capacity for about fort

lines. The station provides the equipment, the technical assistance,

couriers and transcribers, while the Mexicans make the conne

tions in the exchanges and maintain the listening posts. In add

tion to monitoring the lines of the communist diplomatic mission

and those of Mexican revolutionary groups, LIEN VOY also cove

special cases. For years the telephones of ex-President Cárdena

and his daughter have been tapped, and recently tapping ba

started on that of Luis Quintanilla, a Mexican intellectual whos

planning a trip to Hanoi with the publisher of the Miami Ne

and with a fellow of the Center for the Study of Democrati

532

institutions in Santa Barbara. Reports on plans for this trip are

tent immediately to the White House.

¿ The station also has its own unilateral telephone tapping

operation which is limited to special cases where the involvement

of the Mexicans is thought to be undesirable. Connections for this

coperation are made outside the exchanges by telephone company

engineers who work as station agents, as in the case of the bugging

of the Cuban Embassy (LISAMPAN). However this is restricted as

far as possible in order to avoid damaging relations with the

Mexicans in the event of discovery.

Travel control, general investigations and occasional surveil-

lance are the duties of a six-man team called LIFIRE. They obtain

fight-travel lists from the airport, which are passed daily to the

station and take photographs of passengers to and from com-

munist countries and of their passports as they pass through

immigration.

Another eight-man surveillance team, known as LIEMBRACE,

has vehicles (including a Volkswagen photo-van) and radio-

communications equipment and is mainly concerned with Soviet/

satellite and Cuban targets. It is administered by Jim Anderson, #

who also controls another eight-man team (LIRICE), similarly

equipped, which deals with the Mexican revolutionaries and other

miscellaneous targets.

Postal interception is mainly directed towards the mail from

communist countries, but can occasionally be used to get corres-

pondence from selected Mexican addresses.

As in every station, a variety of agents assists in support tasks

which they perform in the course of their ordinary jobs. For

processing the immigration papers for station non-official cover

personnel, for example, Judd Austin, I one of the US lawyers in

Goodrich, Dalton, Little and Riquelme (the principal law firm

serving American subsidiaries) is used. The Executive Vice

President of the American Chamber of Commerce in Mexico

City, Al Wichtrich, I channels political information to the station

that he picks up in his normal work with American and Mexican

businessmen. For technical support the station has an officer of

IS under Embassy cover with a workshop and qualification:

in audio, flaps and seals, and photography.

that they were engaged in political activities. The Chinese had t

lact, been using the NCNA ofice for propaganda and support t

pro-Chinese revolutionary organizations in Mexico and Centr

Amacrica.

Central American Exiles

Mexico has traditionally been a haven for political exiles from

Central American countries including communists and other

extreme leftists. Several Central American parties, including the

Guatemalans, maintain liaison sections in Mexico City in order

to keep lines open to the Soviets, Cubans and others. They

operate semi-clandestinely for the most part in order to avoid

repression from the Mexican government.

Washington DC

20 December 1966

Because of the strategic importance of Mexico to the US, its size

and proximity, and the abundance of enemy activities, the

Mexico City station is the largest in the hemisphere. Altogether

the station has some fifteen operations officers under State

Department cover in the Embassy political section, plus about

twelve more officers under assorted non-official covers outside the

: Embassy. In addition, a sizeable support staff of communications

officers, technical services, intelligence assistants, records clerks

and secretaries bring the overall station personnel total to around

fifty.

Liaison Operations

Dominating the station operational programme is the LITEMPO!

project which is administered by Winston Scott, I the Chief of

Station in Mexico City since 1956, with the assistance of Annie

Goodpasture,‡ a case officer who has also been at the station for

some years. This project embraces a complicated series of opera-

tional support programmes to the various Mexican civilian

security forces for the purpose of intelligence exchange, joint

524

operations and constant upgrading of Mexican internal intelli-

fence collection and public security functions.

At the top of the LITEMPo operation is the Mexican President,

Gustavo Diaz Ordaz, $ who has worked extremely closely with the

station since he became Minister of Government in the previous

edministration of Adolfo Lopez Matcos$ (1958-64). Scott had

aso developed a very close working relationship with Lopez

Matcos, and, since Diaz Ordaz became President two years ago,

Scott has been working closely with the current Minister of

Government, Luis Echeverria. Thus the LITEMPO project

focuses at the top on the President and the current Minister of

Government who will be the second consecutive choice of PRI

kaders to pass from internal security to the presidency.

Scott's chummy relationship with Diaz Ordaz none the less has

its problems. In 1964 Fulton Freeman went to Mexico City as

Ambassador to crown a Foreign Service career that had started

in the same Embassy in the 1930s. He is expected to retire after

the 1968 Olympic Games. At the time of his assignment to Mexico

City Freeman's expectations of meaningful diplomatic relations

with Diaz Ordaz collided with the President's preference for deal-

ing with Scott, and Freeman was relegated to protocol contacts

with the President while his diplomatic talents focused on the

Foreign Minister. The problem of who would deal with the Presi-

dent was confused somewhat by the Ambassador's insistence, not

long after arrival, on a detailed briefing about the station opera-

tional programme, which Scott refused. Eventually both Scott

and the Ambassador visited the White House, where President

Johnson settled matters according to the wishes of the Agency

and of his friend Diaz Ordaz. Scott continued, of course, to work

with the President and the Ambassador never got the full briefing

he had demanded. Since then the relations between Scott and the

Ambassador have warmed, but the Ambassador forbids any

station operations directed against the Mexican Foreign Ministry.

While Scott frequently meets the President and the Minister of

Government, two non-official cover case officers handle the day-

lo-day contact with the chiefs of the security services subordinate

lo Echeverria. One of these officers is a former FBI agent who

worked in the legal attaché's office in the Mexico City Embassy

- the legal attaché is usually the FBi office in an American

ment for a new secret communications network to function be?"

tween Diaz Ordaz's office and principal cities in the rest of the

country. Other joint operations with the Mexican security ser

vices include travel control, telephone tapping and repressive

action.

The station also prepares a daily intelligence summary for Diaz

Ordaz with a section on activities of Mexican revolutionary orga-

nizations and communist diplomatic missions and a section on

international developments based on information from head.

quarters. Other reports, often relating to a single subject, are

passed to Diaz Ordaz, Echeverria and top security officials. Thes

reports, like the daily round-up, include information from station

unilateral penetration agents with due camouflaging to protect the

identity of the sources. The station is much better than are the

Mexican services, and is thus of great assistance to the authorities

in planning for raids, arrests and other repressive action.

....

Liaison between Scott and the Mexican military intelligence

services consists mainly of exchange of information, in order lo

keep a foot in the door for future eventualities. The US military

attachés, moreover, are in constant contact with their Mexican

military intelligence counterparts and their reports are received

regularly by the station.

Stan Watson, the Mexico City Deputy Chief of Station, has

been meeting with a South Korean CIA officer who was recently

sent under diplomatic cover to monitor North Korean soundings

for establishment of missions in Mexico and Central America

Communist Party Operations

The station CP section consists of two case officers, Wack

Thomast and Ben Ramirez, I both under Embassy cover, plus

526

i two case officers outside the station under non-official cover: Bob

Driscoll, i a retired operations officer now working under con-

¿ tract, and Julian Zambianco who was transferred from Guayaquil

10 Mexico City about a year ago. These officers are in charge of

agent and technical penetrations against the revolutionary organi-

rations of importance. The quality of this intelligence is high,

although not as high as it was before 1963. In late 1962 Carlos

Manuel Pellecer, I the station's most important communist party

penetration-agent, broke openly with communism by publishing

a book. He was a leader of the Guatemalan Communist Party

(PGT) and had been Minister of Labor in the Arbenz government

during the 1950s. However, after the Agency-sponsored over-

throw of the Arbenz government Pellecer made his way to Mexico

City where for years he was the station's best source (cryptonym

LINLUCK) on all the revolutionary organizations in Mexico, not

just the Guatemalan exiles. His book, of course, was financed by

the station and distributed by the Agency all over Latin America.

Pellecer is still being used by the Mexico City station as a propa-

ganda agent, as with other former penetration agents who form-

ally break with communism without revealing their years of work

as spies - Eudocio Ravines, f the well-known Peruvian defector

from communism is a parallel case. Another book by Pellecer,

aiso financed by the station, has just appeared. This book is a

continuation of CIA exploitation of the Marcos Rodriguez and

Joaquin Ordoqui cases in Cuba, and is aimed at denigration of the

Cuban revolution.

The station also collects information about communists from

the US living in Mexico. Many of them arrived during the Mc-

Carthy period and some have subsequently become Mexican

citizens. Information about them is mainly of interest to the FBI,

which calls them the American Communist Group in Mexico

City (ACGMC). Information collected about them includes that

obtained through the LIENvOY telephone tapping operation des-

cribed below.

The station also receives copies of reports from FBI penetration

operations against Mexican revolutionary organizations. Mexico

is the only country in Latin America, except Puerto Rico, where

the fBi continued operations against the local left when the CIA

look over in 1947. The fBI intelligence is of high quality.

Soviel/Satellite Operations

The largest section in the station is that covering Soviet/satelins

operations. It has four case officers, three intelligence assistant

and a secretary, all under Embassy cover, and four case offioe:

under non-official cover. It is headed by Paul Dillont and th

other official cover case officers are Donald Vogel, Cynthi

Hausman and Robert Steele. # A number of sensitive operation

are underway.

The station has two observation posts in front of the Soviet

Embassy, which cover the entrances, plus a third observation post

in the back of the Embassy to provide coverage of the gardens?

The LICALLA observation post in the back is the closest of five

houses bordering the Embassy property - all five are owned by

the station. Several years ago films were made of Soviets con-

versing in the garden, but attempts by Russian lip-readers to dis-

cover their conversations were unsuccessful. From one of the

front of's, radio contact is maintained with the LIEMBRACE

surveillance team for signalling when a particular Soviet surveil

lance target leaves the Embassy, his route and other data. Photos

are regularly taken from all the Op's of Soviets and their families

and all visitors to the Embassy. When visitors use vehicles, photo-

graphs are taken of their licence plates for tracing. Occasionally

the LICALLA OP is used for electronic monitoring, since it is

close to the Embassy, but so far attempts to pick up radiations

from Soviet cryptographic equipment have been unsuccess.

ful.

In addition to the LIEMBRACE surveillance team, several other

support operations include coverage of the Soviets. Through the

CIENVOY operation, Soviet telephones are constantly monitored,

and through the LIFIRE travel-control operation photographs of

travel documents are obtained along with data on arrivals and

departures. Monitoring of Mexican diplomatic communications

reveals requests for Mexican visas by Soviet officials, including

the diplomatic couriers. In addition, NSA is also monitoring

several communications systems involving 'burst' transmissions

from the ussr to as yet unidentified agents believed to be in

Mexico - possibly Soviet intelligence officers assigned abroad as

"illegals', with false identity and non-official cover.

528

The station runs between fifteen and twenty access agents

rainst the Soviets with varying degrees of effectiveness and

Miability. Several of these agents are suspected of having been

Ficruited by the Soviets for use as double agents against the

dation. Two of the most important of the current access-agents

are Katherine Manjarrez, I Secretary of the Foreign Press Associa-

tion, and her husband - both of whom are targeted against the

Soviet press attache and the Tass correspondent. Others are

LCowL-lIand LIOVAL-1.$

LICOWL-l is the owner of a tiny grocery store situated in front

of the Soviet Embassy where the Soviets buy odds and ends in-

duding their soft drinks - TSD is studying ways of bugging a

wooden soft-drink case or the bottles themselves. More import-

ant, LICOWL-1 is involved at the moment in an operation against

the Embassy zavhoz (administrative officer), who spends consider-

able time chatting with the agent. Because Silnikov, the zavhoz,

has been on the prowl for a lover - or so he said to LICOWI-1 -

the station decided to recruit a young Mexican girl as bait: An

appropriate girl was obtained through BESABER,‡ an agent who

is normally targeled against Polish intelligence officers and who

runs a ceramics business specializing in souvenirs. By loitering at

LICOWL-I's store the girl attracted Silnikov's attention, and a

hot necking session in a back room at the store led to several

serious afternoon sessions at the girl's apartment nearby -

obtained especially for this operation. Silnikov's virility is as-

tonishing both the girl and the station, which is recording and

photographing the sessions without the knowledge of the girl.

Although promiscuity among Soviets is not abnormal, relation-

ships with local girls are forbidden. Eventually it will be decided

whether to try blackmail against Silnikov or to provoke disrup-

lion by sending tapes and photos to the Embassy if the blackmail

is refused.

LIOVAL-II is not as interesting a case but is more important.

The agent is an American who teaches English in Mexico City

and is an ardent fisherman. Through fishing he became acquain-

led with Pavel Yatskov, the Soviet Consul and a known senior

KGB officer - possibly the Mexico City rezident (KG B chief). Yats-

kov and the agent spend one or two week-ends per month off in

the mountains fishing and have developed a very close friendship.

529

## Page 25

13-00000

When Yatskov is transferred back to Moscow - he has alre

been in Mexico for some years - we shall decide whether to try la

defect him through LIOVAL-1. Recently Peter Deriabin, I thi

well-known KG B defector from the 1950s who is now a US citize,

and full-time CIA employee, went to Mexico City to study the

voluminous reports on Yatskov written by LIOVAL-1. He con

cluded that there is a strong possibility that LIOVAL-1 has been

recruited by Yatskov and is reporting on Paul Dillon, the station

officer in charge of this case. Nevertheless, the operation con!

tinues while the counter-intelligence aspects are studied further

The station double-agent cases against the Soviets, LICOZY-1;y

LICOZY-3I and LICOZY-S,I are all being wound up for lack,

of productivity or problems of control. One of these agents,.

LICOZY-3, is an American living in Philadelphia who was ro

cruited by the Soviets while a student in Mexico, but who reported

the recruitment and worked for the Mexico City station. Hé

worked for the fBI after returning to the US - the Soviet case

officer was a UN official at one time - but recently Soviet interest

in him has fallen off and the FBI turned the case back over to the

Agency for termination.

Against the Czechs and the Poles many of the same types of

operation are targeted. Acoess agents, observation posts, tela

phone tapping, surveillanoe and travel control are continuous

although with somewhat less intensity than against the Soviets.

In the Yugoslav Embassy the code clerk has been recruited by the

CIA as has one of the Embassy's secretaries.

Until the New China News Agency (NCNA) office was closed

last month by the Mexican government, the Soviet/satellite sec.

tion of the station was responsible for following the movements

of the Chinese communists. Telephone intercepts through

LIENVOY and occasional surveillance by the LIRIcE team were

directed against them, but the most important intelligence col-

lected against them was from the bugging of their offices. The

audio operation was supported by the Far East Division in head-

quarters, who sent an operations officer and transcribers to

Mexico City. Now that the NCNA offices are closed, the audio

equipment will be removed and the station will continue to

follow up the many leads coming from the bugging operation.

530

than Operations

She Cubân operations section consists of two case officers,

rancis Sherry and Joe Piccolo, and a secretary under Embassy

över and one case officer under non-official cover. An observa-

cion post for photographic coverage and radio contact with the

LEMBRACE surveillance team is functioning, as well as LIENVOY

telephone monitoring and LIFIRE airport travel control. Through

he LIFIRE team the station obtains regular clandestine access

to the Prensa Latina pouch from Havana, and copies of corres-

pondence between PL headquarters in Havana and its correspon-

dents throughout the hemisphere are forwarded to the stations

concerned.

Through the LITEMPO liaison operation the Mexican immi-

gration service provides special coverage of all travellers to and

from Havana on the frequent Cubana flights. Each traveller is

photographed and his passport is stamped with arrival or depar-

ture cachets indicating Havana travel. The purpose is to frustrate

she Cuban practice of issuing visas on separate slips of paper in-

sead of in the passport so as to obscure travel. Prior to each

Cubana departure the station is notified of all passengers so that

name checks can be made. In the case of US citizens, the Mexican

service obliges by preventing departure when requested by the

station.

The most important current operation targeted against the

Cuban mission is an attempted audio penetration using the tele

phone system. Telephone company engineers working in the

LIDENY tapping operation will eventually install new wall-boxes

for the Embassy telephones in which sub-miniature transmitters

with switches will have been cast by ISD. At the moment,

however, the engineers are causing deliberate interference in

Embassy telephones by technical means in the exchange. Each

time the Embassy calls the telephone company to complain of

interference on the lines, the engineers report back that every-

hing in the exchange is in order. Eventually, as the interference

continues, the engineers will check street connections and finally

arrive to check the instruments in the Embassy. They will find the

wall-boxes "defective' and will replace them with the bugged

boxes cast by ISD. Right now, however, this operation (crypto-

in a purge of Mexico City Station files and that the

folders for the destroyed material were reused to

forward more recent photographic material to

Headquarters

for retention. "143/ The folders which

once contained the production were located at the

National Archives' Warrenton Records Center but,

according to the CIA's explanation, the folders

contained production material from 1967.144/ Because

the CIA has not provided the photographic production

3. Telephone Lines Covered

This Committee has made an attempt to determine

which telephone lines at the Soviet and Cuban

diplomatic compounds were subject to this electronic

intercept operation in September and October of 1963.

the month of september lists the following phones

(9) Format of Transcripts

The format of the transcripts that Mr. Tarasoff

produced was much the same as those of the Spanish

language transcripts described above.294/ Mr.

Tarasoff's transcripts were from Russian into English. 295/

Many of Mr. Tarasoff's transcriptions bear the notation

conversation.297/ Mr. Tarasoff indicated that this

notation meant that the conversation had already been

transcribed from a tap on another embassy phone:

I went to the embassy first and the embassy

number was 605055.

One CIA employee who was involved in Cuban

taps on the telephone of the Cuban Consulate. 213/ It is

possible that the employee, Mr. Phillips, who was stationed

in Mexico City from 1961 to 1966, was incorrect, after

a fifteen-year hiatus, in placing this tap in 1963.214/

As the above notes, an examination of the project

files fails to support: Mr. Phillips' memory,

although those files do show that the Consulate

telephone was tapped in 1964.

if it had been

sent to CIA headquarters, would

his case prior

to

the assassination have been

handled in any different manner?

A: It would have been in the case of dissemina-.

but I do not

think that any operational action would have

taken to apprehend him or to contact him or

to try to force him back to the United States.

Q: ... how would the dissemination have been

treated

differently?

A: Well, it simply means that we would have dis-

seminated any

additional

information that we

got. 657/

It cannot be determined with exactitude whether or

not this additional information about Oswald was reported

to Headquarters. In all likelihood it was not. The Chief

of the Mexico Desk was asked whether or not the Station

was ever criticized for this failure to report in the

face of a specific request to do so by CIA Headquarters.

He said:

No. That was not because we were trying to go

easy on them, it is simply because it is in the

nature of the

business.

What you are trying to

do is engage, as 1 used to say, in important il-

legal

manipulations of society, secretly.

he was asked how he

Attached is an MFR summarizing my meeting with Mr. Whitten. On a more personal note, Mr. Whitten is an extremely

charming and interesting gentleman. The meeting with him went much better than I had hoped, but it was also rather emotionally

distressing for both Jeremy and I. Mr. Whitten broke down several times during the meeting and was obviously feeling very scared.

Although Jeremy is sure that the Board will do the right thing here, we both agreed that Mr. Whitten is withoüt doubt someone who

should be protected even if it means going to the President.

I OBJECT VIOLENTLY TO THE REVELATION OF MY NAME REGARDLESS OF

BACKGROUND. 3I USED MY RETIRED STATE COVER BOTH TIMES, THEREBY>

LIVING SINCE RETIREMENT IN AUSTRIA FROM 1971 TO 1980 AND FROM

1983 TO THE PRESENT, I HAVE ACHIEVED HIGH POSITIONS IN VIENNA'S

MUSICAL BODIES, BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE JOHANN STRAUSS SOCIETY AND

VICE PRESIDENT OF THE VIENNA MEN'S SINGING SOCIETY, AND/I AI

PERSONALLY KNOWN TO SEVERAL RECENT AUSTRIAN PRESIDENTS, MANS

REPORTERS AND RADIO FIGURES. I SUFFERED A DISABLING STROKE IN

DECEMBER 1993 AND MY WIFE AND I, BOTH 75, CAN CONTINUE TO EXIST HERE

BECAUSE OUR 2000 SQ. FT. APARTMENT IS WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF 2

POST OFFICES, SEVERAL SMALL SUPER MARKETS, MY FAMILY PHYSICIAN, OUR

DENTIST, MY UROLOGIST, AND AN EYE DOCTOR AND OPTICIAN.

WITHIN WHEEL CHAIR DISTANCE OF THE CONCERT HALLS AND THE OPERA.

WHERE CAN YOU DUPLICATE THIS FOR ME?

DURING MY ACTIVE CAREER

IN VIENNA AROUND 1959 I INTERROGATED AND

BROKE AN INTELLIGENCE SWINDLER WHO HAD BEEN A NAZI ASSASSIN.

PROMISED HIM SECRECY IF HE CONFESSED, BUT THE US ARMY PUT OUT A

"BURN NOTICE" ON HIM, FORCING HIM TO MOVE TO GERMANY. I AM SURE HE

WOULD LOVE TO FIND ME AND SHOOT ME...

¿VIENNA IS FULL OF ISLAMIC TERRORISTS.

THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL

ASSASSINATIONS, EVEN OF A CITY COUNCILMAN, BY THEM IN RECENT YEARS.

UNDER AUSTRIAN LAW, I, AS A FOREIGNER, CANNOT EVEN GET A PISTOL

LICENSE.

KNOW ABOUT THE KIDNAPPING AND KILLING OF OUR

COLLEAGUES AROUND THE WORLD.

I HAVE TWICE TESTIFIED BEFORE HOUSE AND SENATE COMMITTEES ABOUT

THE KENNEDY ASSASSINATION.

THEIR FULL REPORTS SIMPLY CALLED ME THE

"DESK OFFICER" AND THAT HAS SEEMED TO SATISFY EVERYONE.

SAY, IF YOU DO EXPOSE MY NAME, I WILL NOT EVER TALK TO ANY

JOURNALISTS OR SO-CALLED HISTORIANS.

IF MY NAME IS EXPOSED, I WILL OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO LEAVE VIENNA,

NITH THE WHOLE HOUSE FULL OF FURNITURE, PICTURES, LIBRARY, CLOTHING,

CTC. WHICH I PACKED AND PAID TO HAVE MOVED OVER HERE IN 1983.

BECAUSE OF MY STROKE, I WILL BE UNABLE TO DO ANY PACKING AND THE

MOVE WILL BE VERY EXPENSIVE.

WHERE CAN I RESETTLE IN A 2000 SQ FT.

MY WIFE AND I LOVE LIVING HERE FOR MANY REASONS, AND LEAVING

WOULD BE A CRUEL AND NEEDLESS FATE.

RIN THE LATE 1960'S WHILE SERVING IN VIENNA UNDER TOM

KARAMISSINIS, I WAS ORDERED BY HQ TO REVEAL TO AUSTRIAN MILITARY

-INTELLIGENCE THAT A LOW-RANKING AUSTRIAN DIPLOMAT SERVING AS THEIR

INFORMANT IN BUDAPEST HAD ALSO BEEN RECRUITED BY US AND WAS REPORTI

NG TO US.

I REFUSED TO CARRY OUT THIS ORDER AND OFFERED MY

RESIGNATION.

TO ME, IT WAS DISHONORABLE TO BETRAY A YOUNG AGENT WHO

HAD ACCEPTED OUR RECRUITMENT AND PUT FAITH IN OUR PROMISE OF

TO MY MIND AN AGENCY WITHOUT PRINCIPLES CANNOT SURVIVE AND

INDEED SHOULD NOT SURVIVE.

TOM KARAMISSINIS, PERHAPS ONE OF THE

LAST HONORABLE MEN TO SERVE WITH US IN HIGH POSITION, FIRED A STRONG

CABLE BACK AND THE SHAMEFUL ORDER WAS RETRACTED.

I HAVE INVESTED ABOUT $50,000 IN MY APARTMENT, IN KEY MONEY AND

I WILL LOSE ALL OR MOST OF THIS.

LAST MOVE TO VIENNA COST ME ABOUT $15,000 IN SEA FREICHT AND

INSURANCE.

I WILL NEVER GET ON MY KNEES AND ASK TO BE MADE WHOLE IF

YOU EXPOSE ME, BUT I MAY REPORT TO THE COURTS.

I AM A RETIRED

MEMBER OF THE VIRGINIA BAR.

10. LET ME REGALE YOU WITH AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE HISTORIANS

MINDLESS DRIVE TO KNOW EVERYTHING CAN LEAD TO A PROUD COUNTRY'S

DISGRACING ITSELF. DURING WWII WHEN WE WERE INTERROGATING GERMAN

POW'S, WE PROMISED THEM NO ONE-WOULD EVER LEARN THEY HAD "SPILLED

THEIR GUTS," AND WE ALL BELIEVED WE WERE BEING HONEST.

25 YEARS AFTER WWII THE BRITISH DECLASSIFIED ALL THE ADI(K) REPORTS

(THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE CALLED, AND EVEN THE "ROOM CONVERSATIONS,"

TRANSCRIPTS OF THE CONVERSATIONS POWS HAD IN THEIR ROOMS, EVEN

INCLUDING THE EXTREMELY VALUABLE SPEECHES MADE BY HIGH-RANKING

LUFTWAFFE OFFICERS TO THEIR HIGH-RANKING FELLOW POW'S AT

"COCKFOSTERS" MANSION.

NEWCOMERS WERE VISITED BY THE OLD HANDS FOR

A MONTH TO MAKE SURE THEY WEREN'T STOOL PIGEONS, BEFORE THEY WERE

GIVEN THE PRIVILEGE OF ADDRESSING THEIR FELLOW OFFICERS ON SOME

IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE WAR. THE EXCELLENT BRITISH MIKES PICKED IT

ALL UP.

IN RECENT YEARS, AT LEAST ONE LUFTWAFFE VETERAN ASSOCIATION,

THAT OF J.G.2, THE RICHTHOFEN GESCHWADER,

SENT PEOPLE TO LONDON TO

GET COPIES OF

THE INTERROGATION REPORTS OF THEIR PILOTS. THEY DID

IT CHRONOLOGICALLY AND WERE SO SHOCKED AT THE VAST AMOUNT OF VITAL

DATA REVEALED BY THEIR BUDDIES THAT,

IN ACUTE REVULSION,

STOPPED LOOKING. I ASSUMED THEN THAT "EVERYONE" HAD "TALKED, " WHICH

IS TRUE.

11. I AM 75 YEARS OLD PARTLY PARALYZED ON MY LEFT SIDE FROM A

STROKE IN DEC. 1993..

I WAS NEARLY FULLY REHABILITATED WHEN, IN MAY

1994, I WAS HIT BY CONSTANT MUSCLE SPASMS ALL UP AND DOWN MY LEFT

THIS RATHER RARE CONDITION, BASICALLY A SUDDEN SUPER-HUMAN

TIGHTENING OF ALL THE MUSCLES, WITH AFTER EFFECTS LASTING UNTIL THE

NEXT SPASM, HAVE MADE IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO STAND UP,

WALK, OR EVEN SIT UP FOR VERY LONG.

IN A FEW DAYS, WHEN ALL THE

MANY MEDICINES ARE HERE, WILI BEGIN A 20-WEEK HOMEOPATHIC CURE FOR

THE SPASMS UNDER DR. SCHRAMM, A LEADING SPECIALIST HERE. I CAN'T

VERY WELL LEAVE FOR

20 WEEKS.

YOU WILL BE CONTACTED MOMENTARILY BY ONE. OF MY ATTORNEYS. I

WILL ALSO BE IN TOUCH WITH MY CONGRESSMAN AND SENATORS.

WITH BITTER RESOLVE,

Subj: EX-CIA Agent Adds Fuel to Kennedy Assassination Fire

EX-CIA Agent Adds Fuel to Kennedy Assassination Fire

By Michael Dorman

(c) 1996, Newsday

The chief CIA investigator of President John F. Kennedy's assassination has

testified that another high ClA official - noted for seeking conspiracies -

disobeyed orders in repeatedly conferring with the Warren Commission shortly

after the murder. The witness also sald a colleague once told him that the CIA

official, the late

James Angleton, "has ties to the Mafia"

Almost 33 years after the assassination, the identity of the witness, who held

various top-secret ClA jobs, is considered so sensitive that federal authorities

insist on withholding his true name. He is known only by the alias "John

Scelso."

While Scelso testifled before the House Select Committee on Assassinations in

1978, his 192-page testimony was kept secret until now. It has just been sent to

the National Archives by the Assassination Records Review Board, a federal .

agency that screens assassination documents and makes public those that do not

endanger national security.

Sceiso's testimony, which criticized operations of the CIA, FBi, Secret Service

and other agencies, likely will renew debates, especially among conspiracy

theorists, on the assassination and how it was investigated

When Kennedy was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963, Scelso was chier or a CIA

branch

responsible for operations in Mexico and Central America. Richard Helms, the ClA

chier of clandestine services and later the agency's director, placed Scelso in

charge of the assassination investigation. Angleton, a counterintelligence

official with close ties to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, "immediately went

Into action to do all the Investigating," Scelso testified, criticizing the

move sharply.

"Helms called a meeting at which Angleton and a lot of others were present and

told everybody that I was in charge and that no one should have any

conversations with anyone about the Kennedy case without my being present -

which was violated from the word go by Angleton, who dealt with the FBI and

the Warren Commission and (Warren Commission member and former CIA Director

Allen) Dulies himself.... Angleton ignored Helms' orders. I tried to get Helms

to make him obey and Heims said, "You go tell him.'"

Angleton, who died in 1987, spent much of his career searching for conspiracies

- belteving that there was a Communist mole in the CIA - and was presumed by

other ClA officers to have tried to press a conspiracy theory on the warren

Commission. The commission found no evidence of a conspiracy. Angleton. was

fired

in 1975. Years later, a mole was found - Aldrich Ames - but he had entered the

CIA after Angleton's dismissal.

At one point in the 1978 House testimony, committee attorney Michael Goldsmith

asked, "Do you have any reason to belteve that Angleton might have had ties to

organized crime?"

"Yes," replied Scelso, who is now retired and lives abroad, government sources

sald. He said the Justice Department once asked the ClA to determine the true

names of people holding numbered bank accounts in Panama because the Mafia was

hiding Las Vegas "skim" money there. "We were in an excellent position to do

this and told them so - whereupon Angleton vetoed it and said, 'That is the

bureau's (FBI's) business.' " Scelso said he discussed the situation with

another CiA officer. "And he smiled a foxy smile and said, 'Well, that's

Angieton's excuse. The real reason is that Angleton himselr has ties to the

Maria and he would not

want to doubie-cross them.'"

On another subject, Sceiso gave Kennedy conspiracy theorists a slight plece of

ammunition. A Soviet defector, Yuri Nosenko, was known to have told

investigators that Lee Harvey Oswald - Identifted by the Warren Commission as

Kennedy's assassin - was not a Soviet agent. But Scelso sald: "! later heard

that Nosenko was discovered to have been dissembling, not being on the level.

That Information was imparted to me by ClA officers."

Based on the information ClA headquarters had on Oswald before the assassination

- chiefiy that he had been in the Marine Corps and defected to the Soviet Union,

then returned - Scelso said he saw no reason to pay him special heed. "Oswald

just seemed to me to be a small-potatoes defector," he said. But he conceded

that significant information about Oswald - known to CIA agents in Mexico City,

for example - had not reached headquarters before the assassination.

It dealt chiefly with Oswald's visits to the Soviet and Cuban embassies In

Mexico City and his attempts to obtain a Cuban visa two months before the

assassination. Scelso said the information failed to reach Washington because of

simple overwork and bureaucratic delays in the Mexico CIty office. He revealed

that all the outside telephone lines at the Soviet and Cuban embassies were

tapped by American agents and that calls Oswald made to them were recorded

After Oswald was arrested, Scelso revealed, agents compared audiotapes made

while he was in custody with the wiretaps and determined that he was the same

man who had visited the embassies.
