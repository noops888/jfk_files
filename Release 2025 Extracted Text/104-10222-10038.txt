MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Retirement. - Tennent H. Bagley
30 June 1972
1. The retirement of Subject, effected as a result of a
memorandum from the Head of his Career Service stating that
he is surplus to the needs of the Service and that his retirement
will be recommended to the Director under the provisions of the
CIA Retirement and Disability System pertaining to involuntary
retirement, in no way implies an adverse action. Subject signed
an application for retirement of his own volition in order to
qualify for an immediate retirement annuity. The liberalized
criteria for such separations waz established by the Agency to
parallel similar actions under the Civil Service Retirement
System in accordance with FPM Letter No. 831-23, dated
10 December 1969.

separation of Subject from the Agency should be confirmed simply

:
Recommendation for Promotion to GS-17 -
Mr. Tennent H. Bagley
1. It is recommended that Mr. Tennent H. Bagley be pro-
moted to GS-17. He has been in grade as GS-16 since June 1965
and has served as COS in Brussels since August 1967. His
previous assignment was as Deputy Chief, SB Division.
2. The reasons for this promotion are amply covered in my
fitness report of this same date. I have just returned from an
extensive trip through the European area, during which I had a
chance to see and talk with a very large number of officers
under both official and non-official cover. Pete Bagley is one
of two whom I am recommending for promotion as a result. He is
one of our very finest station chiefs, possessed of imagination,
intellect and ability personally to handle operations which very
few of his colleagues can match. He is one of those on whom
the future of the Organization is going to depend, and I believe
that the promotion is more than justified.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Robert W. Sheay
SUBJECT:
Mr. Tennent H. Bagley
Promotion to GS-17
1. Mr. Bagley was promoted to GS-16 on 6 June 1965.
At that time he was Chief, CI Group, SR Division. On
1 September 1965 he was appointed Deputy Division Chief,
SR Division. As his fitness 'reports attest, his perform-
ance in that position was outstanding and when in May 1966
the Soviet Bloc Division was created he was named Deputy
Division Chief of the new Division.
2. Thore is little that need be added to previous
fitness reports in my evaluation of Mr. Bagley's current
performance. It continues to be that of a dedicated and
gifted officer whose energies and extensive substantive
knowledge make a vital contribution to one of the top
priority programs of the Clandestine Services. Much more
important, in considering Mr. Bagley for promotion to the
next level of the supergrades, is his potential for addi-
tional growth and responsibility. He would be capable now
of taking charge of a field station, particularly one with
special opportunities for work against the Soviet Bloc and
the Chinese targets. With time (he is forty-one) he will
bé capable of assuming the senior position in any division
or staff in the CS. He is clearly one of the outstanding
officers in our service.
