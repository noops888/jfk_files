2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

SECRET

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Varmatt

Re:

Samuel. Adason Jaffe

105-28333

soviet detector sammy has advised that Jalte was

recruited by the nobin about 1962 while he was in Moscow.

through his relationship with a Soviet lenale. Soviet de-

fector "Shamrock" has confirmed that Jaffe was approached but

does not believe the approach was successful. calle reported

to the New York Office in 1963 what he interpreted as a recruit-

ment effort, and he was extensively reinterviewed in 1969

concerning his association with KGB officers in Moscow. There

is no information in Jaffe's file that he was ever reported on

by co1. Penkovskiy, as Jaite reportedly has claimed..

â€¢ During

the interviews with Jaffe, he denied any overt acts

to the KGB, although he admitted a continuing relationship vith

several KGB officers.

Both the New York and Yashington Field

Offices came to the conclusion that Jafle was a KGB agent while

in Moscow,

but that there vas doubt as to whether he

allegation, and Bureau Agents in contact with him vere circum

spect in any dealings with him

thereafter. Jaffe very likely

detected a change in the Agents' attitude which accounts for

his statement

that he felt his relationship with them had

cooled off.

There is no evidence contained in Jaile's file that

either New York or Washington Field

or the Bureau has ever taken

any action which would affect Jaffe's livelihood. rolloving

his return Ixon Hong Kong, Jaffe told his handling Agents that

he was experiencing difficulty in finding a job.

he several

tines mentioned his concern that ris association with the FBI

night be the reason.

On each occasion, he was assurcd that

the IBI had never divulged his confidontial relationship and

would not do so any time in the future.u

Jalfe's file does disclose that during an interview

with Washington Field Agents in 1969, he said that he had
