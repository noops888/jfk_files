that what he know about the riddle fast wouldn't do anyono any good. Ho

then went on to say he had suent his first weekend in Moscow with his son,

who shortly thereafter left for hto summer job in "Siberia." He said ho

gent the second weekend (10-11 Juno) with his daughter. The daughter.

according to KAZANSEV, had planned to do "south" for a 2-3 weck vacation in

early June, but postponed the vacation when she learned her father was

coming: (Tha Implication, according to. Subject, was thut KAZA'SEV's trip:

about, however, was the fact he had unexpectedly had had to take his English

of his stay for the test, which can often take that long. The ftrst day

"Is takon up by an oral test, and li one passes that, ho goes on. to the written

MEMO OF CONVERSATION

Lolla BELAVAL. Visa Officer of U.S. Embassy

I talked to Lella today about her contact with the Sovier who brought

BAZAROV's pussport in for a visa yesterday. She Identified the Soviet from

a photograph as Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV, and sald that he is always

the one who comes to the U.S. Embassy for visas. She did not recognize:

the photograph of Vladislav Sergeyevich KORMUSHKIN, the Vice Consul,

Actually, Lella believed that LOGINOV was a Vice Consul, said she always

asks for him as such when she has to call the Sovict Embassy.

A 2. Apparently yesterday was not the first time that LOGINOV has tried

to make a date with Leila. She says that he always asks her what she does

In her free time, and that she has put him off by saying that she is very busy.

Once sheir he asked her wliether she spent her free tine with other people

ax from the Embassy and was surprised to hear that she usually spends her

off bours with non-Embassy friends.

Yesterday LOGINOV again asked hér

what she did in the evenings, and she said she was especlally busy now

because she lias started taking guitar lessons.

He mentioned some Soviet

dance group that was coming to Mexico in a month. or so and said he would

like to invite her to go to see them with him. He also told her he was nọt

marrled, Lella sald she did not refuse the invitation outright but said that

she did not know whether she would be free when they carne or not.

3. I told Leila a few of the facts of Sov let life: that all Soviets have to

be marrled in order to go overseas, that LOGINOV Is a KGB. officer and

was obv lously trying to get his foot in the door of the U.S. Embassy through

her, that he was unisubtedly disappointed to hear thät she did not spend

all her free time with other Embassy people, etc. Leila has evluently been

unsure about how to react to LOGINOV's advances, has not wanted to be

rude to him, and seemed relleved when I suggested that she simply decline

his invitations by always being busy. She says she does not like his slick

manner at all, and gather that she has felt uneasy in having to deal with

him,, but now that someone has told her how to react she will have no problem.

4. Lella mentioned that LOGINOV knows English but-ls reluctant to

use it. He once read off the visa stamped in a passport in peffect English,

and he also read a copy of the new visa regulations in English (to himself,

but evidently understanding ir all). According to the new regulations,

Sovlets no longer need visas for continuous iransit of the U.S. (i.e.,

same flight), but LOGINOV insisted on getting a visa for BAZAROV in spite

• of this. (This is confirmed in LIENVOY.) --

Local supporters of the extreme left such

as Cordero Amador, the

exhibition of a film, a ruasian film at the embassy the next

day, he also whahwe were leaving said that we had to go to hle

house soon and have a real russtan dinner. This kind of invitation

1a most unusual. I do not remember any other sovietico surgesting

On sunday 11 June, valentin Loruinor was able to obtrin for us

two food ticketa for the Ballet Holaho1 nt Bells Artes and

niterwards we went to have sonething to eat at Lady Baltimore In

Madero Street.

Very few people were there, which is not; surprising

In view of the bad naality of their food and poor service. But:

1t, was the nearest spot

for a quick bite.

Loguinov was very much interested in knowing what my us

friende thought about. the situation in the Middle Fast

i and what

they would do about it. He was insistent about the possible help

that the us would give to Israel, he naid that the US had alrendy

given Israel a considerable amount of ammunition and planes, and

specially money, the URSS had to give some help to the arabe in

view of the help siven to Israel. According to him there was not

the slighest doubt that Israel had been the agressor. The URSS

would never consent to any territorial gains by Israel..

During our conversation about food, specially about seafood

he lot 1t be know/that he had been in Mazatlán several times.

He said that everything which had taken place in the Middle

East had been plotted in advance by the US and Israel.

Miriam AVILA Katz

- P-581

CATE OF HUNTING. 11 May 1967

1 liy last meeting with Subjoct was on 23 larch, at.

which time she agreed to provide information on LoGINOv

obtalned during their normal business contact and iny further

zocial contact initiated by him.. She was to call mé after

their next date.or

any other cienificant contact she hnd with

him. Sinco I had not heard from her, I called her at her

apartment about 2115 on 11 May. I apologized for calling so

Late, but

sald I had juit got out öf work and had a package

for her I had brought back from the States which I wanted

to deliver before the contents got stale. Could I drop over

that night or perhaps another evening.

Subject. Immedlatelj

recognized the "package" as the Benson and Hedges cigarettes

I had promised her; gently protested, and then told me she

whe not feeling well, but the doctor had told her she had

to eat, and It so happened she was just going out for a bito

when I called. I consequently suggested we have dinner together,

which we did from 2145-1215 at the Gondola. Afterwards, wo

went

around the corner to her apartment for a nightcap until

0200.

?. Subject had lost 8 or 10 pounds and looked a bit thin

and not as attractive as I had remembered her. She told me

she was simoly working too hard and not eating and sleeping

properly. I had some fear that she might have had come second

thoughts in the seven weeks since she had agreed to cooperato,

but it proved unfounded. She this time was relaxed from tho

start, was very friendls, and

seemed to onloy the opportunity

to set out. (She later told me in her apartment that she didn't

so out much, liked to spend her evenings at home reading,

listoning to records, tending to her dwarf trees, ete.) Sho

wide it clear from the start that she hadn't changed her mind

by warning me half-geriously and half-nlayfully that I shouldn't

think I could "buy her with sifts..

"You've bought me up here,"

she sald, tapping her head with her forefinger. "That's

the only way you'll get anywhere with mo." Most of the evening

was spent in general and (especially back at her apartment)

Increasingly fuzzy discussion of Israel, the Jews, her Job,

the Russians "as people," her very humanintic philosophy about.

lice and I don't

exactly remember what else.

She is definitely

a smart airl, but I think less profound and sophistleated than

she tries to appear.

Otherwise, she seems to be a very sincere

person, and she has liven me no reason to doubt or suspect

angthing she has told me.

3 Contact with TOGIOV, Subject sald she hadn't been

out with LOGINOy since our last meeting and had had on?y one

face-to-face contact with him.

She said this was a little

over & month

ago (early April) and was

occasioned by for

cfrorts to help a client of the name of or. jury SUaTIR set

She said iThin 1s & dentist and definitely

an official Soviet Invitation to visit the USSR. As 1t turred

out, however, he nau a nard lure evei getting

a Soviot visa.

Subject finally called: LOGINOV herself to try to push thingà

Blong, but OGINOV showed no willingness to facilitate things.

(LIENVOY has subject on the phone to LOGINOV on 5 Apr1l.

After disoussing KUTTLER's case,

subject, remarked to LOGINOY

that she understood that "you. (ustedes) must have some reason

not to want to give him (KUTThSR) the viar." LOGINOV repliod

that there were "reasons enough.")

4o A day or two after her telephone conversation with lourior,

Subject said

she went over to the Soviet Imbagss personally to

see is sho could got anywhere with locINov. Loarnoy received

her cordially, and for the first time asked her into his

offico. (she said it was the first office off.

the outside

Reception Room): She again asked LOGINOV. to try to greedsty

speed up the granting of KUrTLER's visa. LOGINOY herned and

hawed, indicating that he wasn't even sure the visa would bo

granted.

He finally told Subject that look, he had gore to

sUTTLER for dental work once, and UTTER had charged hin ruoa

too much. Consequently, he said, he wasn't going to sivo bin

a visa. Subject said shé could not tell it the destist piil

was the real reason for LOGINOV's negative attitude, but ubea

she persisted; LOGINOV finally relented and the following

exchange ensued:

LOGINOV:

"All right, Mriom,

zve MUTTiR tro visa.

But you knöw, & favor

must be repaid by a favor."

Subject:

"All right....in

that case, let me in the name

of the company invite you to dinner:

LOGINOY:

"No, Miriam,. I don't mean that."

rodINoy then went on to say that as he had mentioned to her

before, he would like ker to introduce him to "someone sno

would be simpathetle to us" (i.e., to the soviets). LOGINOV

emphasired that he realited subject might not agree with this

"someone's" Ideas, hut stated that he knew subject was the

type of person no "had respect for other people's views."

Subject said that she replied in a casual, almost flinpant

ranner that "well, sure, if she met such a person, she'd

introduse them."

with this the eibject was dropped and Subject

left.

LICODY-5• Subject on her own initiative began telling

me what a terrific guy her boss 13..

He according to her, has

one of the most winning personalities of anyone she has

ever

net.

it the same time he is extremely intelligent and shrewd.

"'"If he can't get what he wants through cham, he does It by

pure shrewdness." This is why he is such a successful businessman.

In reply to a question about LICOZi-5'g background, Subject

sald he had ken born in toland, has imprisoned by either the

roles or Germans just before or during world war II lako was

rather vague on this point, and I confined myself to listening),

sorehow got out and joined the Russians, taking part in the

The conversation was the most relaxed as well as the

funklest back at Subject's apartment; where de finished a bottlo

of vodka LOGINOY had given LIColly and LIcOli-S had given her.

Back on the subject of LoGINov, subject said she "supposed"'

he had tried to cultivute a lot of girls like herself... "hadn't

her?" (I had told. subject at our last meeting that young woren

were among toshtoves cavorite targets, but hadn't been ablo to

tell what offect this "revolation" had on her. Now it appeared

that it had hit home and that it had wounded her pride to

think he not only had had ulterior rotives in dating her, but

had dated other girls the same way.) I didn't reply directly,

but said something about LOGINOV bring as smooth as they come.

subject warn't satisfied with this, however, and pressed me:

"lie has tried the same thing. with other giris, hasn't ke?"

"Yes, Mirian, several,"'I finally said. Inis seemed to satisfy

June 1966, LIENVOY Indicated the existence of something nor

Then 1n

January 1967, Paul Dillon ellelted Cron LICOZY-5 the Information

that subject definitely had a social relationship with LoGryoy,

as well as some baato blographto data: she was about 25 or 25

jears old, a Mexican citizen with a Mexican father and "Jewish"

rother; Intelligent, definitely not pro-soviet, and had gone to

collese for two rears in the united States.

The probler In

arranging a meeting with her was to do so in juch a way that she

would bo either disinclined.or unable to say anything. to LI602-5

or anyone olse about the meeting before it took nace. It has

hoped that at the meeting she could be persuaded to keep the

contact to herself.

2o Learning on 23 March that lundos. Tours was closed

which turnod out to perfectly express her personality. Sho

w1ll meet at the ontraner to the Pergola at the time and date

specified. I gave her tao 870 extension and asked that she use

the name

"Hary" when

calling.

12. There are alcarly two essentials 1f Subject 1s to

develop into a worthwhile asset. First she is going to havo to

come up with wore Interesting observations than simply that

LOGINOV 19 smart.

She may be able to do this by becoming a

more dillgent and careful observer--which I think sho 1s

capablo or on at uny requero an etcort on ber part to develos

a closer relationship with LOGINOV. One possibilty in the

latter direction 1s to prevail upon her to becomo more intimate

with LOGIOV than she now appears to be. On the basis of

LICOZY-S's opinion that

she probably sleops around, this might

be possible, although 1t 1s much too early to sat. second,

Subject must provo cooperativo.

Sho strikes me

as a very independent

and strong-willed person; and there is no guarantee

she won't

change. Hartet her mind

or do only what sho reold l1ke doing..

It 1s also possible that In a moment of reconsidoration, she

might confido In Licord-s, In which case her credibility would

become tangled with his.

and thanked her.. He then asked if she were going on the Consular

Corns tour of the lexican Home Show, on 3 March. Well, no,

subject replied, why would she be, she wasn't a consul or married

to one, and consequently hadn't been invited. LoGINOV reniled

that he thought she should go and therefore he was making her

an honorary Soviet consul. Subject sold that was fine with her

and she'd see him at the Home Show. (I told Sibicot on 28

February to be careful with TOGINOV, because he was an experienced

KGB officer ard one of the most able men in the Soviet limbassy.

also met for the

first time Jan Jakowiec of the Polish Embassy

who

was introduced to undersigned by LOGINOY.

As usual LOGINOY spent most of the time conversing

with

undersigned provocating him on a

number of issues.

undersigned answered, making a few similar comments about the

Chinese Civil War.

Nhẹn

LOGINOV mentioned Vietnam, undersigned

felt it would be nice if the Soviet helped the U.S. to

bring peace to that area so they could concentrate more on

the Chinese Communist danger..

At one point in the conversation

undersigned Jokingly asked LOGINOV if there were Soviet

nationals in North Vietnam.

The latter said,

"sure, we have

many advisors there."

The understanged said,.

"no, what he

meant was behind guns or.'in the seats of airplanes." LOGINOV

•said absolutely not.

It also seems that LOGINOV has been

keeping track of the people he sees undersigned talking with

at cocktail

parties.

For example, LOGINOV was curious to

know if undersigned has seen

"his Haitian friends."

Undersigned

asked whichlone - the black one or the white one.

LOGINOV

said.thel

watte one, referring to the Haitian Vice Consul whom

undersigned occasionally talks to

Undersigned said he had

seen the Haitian at the Haitian National Day about a month

ago but noted that the only Soviet present at that party was ..

ANDREYEV; not LOGINOV. The latter, incidentally, corners

the Haitians anytime he has a chance to, although he officially

poo poos the Hattian regime. LOGINOV once more asked under-

signed. when he would

promised to do.

One of the topics that LÖGINOV mentioned

at some of the exchanges between LOGINOV and the undersigned:

Both Mr. and Mrs: JAKOWIEC appear to speak fluent Russian.

At one point 1i the conversation undersigned mentioned there

is hardly a Pole in Poland who does not bave a relative in

the United States; JAKOWIEC agreed and commented that while the

Poles are close to Americans in many things they are not so

pleased at other things that the U. S. does.

Undersigned

deferred this discussion of this point for another meeting.

'Ag many of the .Consular.Cor members know that undersigned

served many years in Vietnam,

the latter felt that he should

not hide this fact to the official bloc representatives as

they would find out about it anyway.

This came out for the

first time on the occasion of this cocktail party when

JAKOWIEC somehow mentioned Yietnam and the efforts of the

Polish members of the Armistice Commission there..

The

undersigned, who has known a number of these people quite well,

told JAKOWIEC that they speak French better than Polish 2s

they were sons of Polish emigrants to France who returned to

Poland after Gomulka took power.

When JAKOWIEC started to

Imply that this indicated how wonderful

things were in Poland,

undersigned pointed out that the parents of the returnees,.

will probably

be held

of the Association told

be expected at the next get-together.:

PERSONALITY ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRE

1. This is a new, experimental version of the Persônality Assessment

Questionnaire (sometimes informally called the PRQ Ill) which has been in

use for several years.

This new form is largely a checklist and thus requires

far less essay-type reporting than the previous form.

2. For a number of years, our operational psychologists have been de

eloping a system for indirect assessment of target personalities

The

system employs, in lieu of psychological tests and interviews-observations

of appearance, manner, and style of behavior. .Such observations are

used as it they were items in a psychological test, and like, test items, are

weighted and analyzed to yield a personality profile. Working from the

profile, operational psychologists describe the target personality's basic

aptitudes, attitudes, motives and susceptibilities.

The goal of the assess-

ment is to identify feasible means of influencing the target person.

3. Reliability is vastly increased when two or more observers complete

this questionnaire independently.

All items need not be completed; in fact;

it is a rare case where contact is sufficient to complete it fully. You are

encouraged to guess where complete information is lacking: Mark such

items with a "G," instead of the customary check mark or "X." Thus, an

observer with very limited contäct can be expècted to enter more "G's'

than

"X's."

Overall impression of eating and smoking behavior. (Check the

most appropriate description.)

A hearty eater with well defined preferences. He eats and smokes

with considerable gusto but tends to be ä little on the coarse ánd

boorish side. It is rather easy to imagine him eating huge sand-

wiches and drinking beer with the boys it the neighborhood bar.

A heavy eater with limited preferences. He eats and smokes

with gusto but his manners are definitely coarse and boorish:

It is rather easy to imagine him becoming quite sharp with a

waiter who serves him unfamiliar fonil or a dish prepared in

an unfamiliar way.

A sensual eater who knows all the restaurants and their native

specialties. He is very anxious to have others try dishes he

has discovered. He eats with obvious pleasure, savors his

smokes,.and though rarely gauche, he is more aware of his

food than his manners. It is easy to imagine him cooking and

serving special dishes to his friends.

A sensual eater who tends to eat by himself when possible.

He seems to eat all types of food and has something of the

air of a glutton about him. He eats with obvious pleasure,

savors his smokes and afterwards will linger alone at a table

with self-satisfaction; It is easy to imagine him hovering

alone over the buffet at a cocktail party savoring the tidbits.

A conventional eater who usually goes along with the crowd.

He probable has food allergies that prevent him from eating

certain foods.. He gives the impression. of enjoying smoking

more than eating but his table manners are adapted to what-

ever situation he is in. It is easy to imagine him taking an..

indigestion pill in the privacy of his room.

A conventional eater who always goes along with the crowd.

He eats with little relish and rarely mentions anything about

his likes or dislikes. He smokes at every opportunity, but.

more mechanically than with pleasure. He usually tries to

adapt his manners to the situation but may be a little awkward

and obvious in doing so.

It is. easy to imagine him grabbing a

bite at a sidewalk stand at any time of day.

A gourmet eater who has marked and varied sophisticated

food tastes. Dining is quite a ritual with him, and atmo-

sphere and service are almost as important as the food. Me

is graceful and cultüred at table and smokes in the same

manner. It is easy to imagine him dressing for dinner, en

joying fine wines and food by candlelight.

An unconventional eater, a man who "eats like a bird."

He eats in a preoccupied way, obviously indifferent to

his food and surroundings. It would not be surprising to

learn he was a food faddist (vegetarian, health foods?.

etc.) .

None of these descriptions really fit.

I would describe him as:

he can be somewhat charming when diunk and can get away

still remains part of the crowd, however-that is, he gives

few signs of being disgusted or bored.

tends to. become aloof and distant. Is likely to continue to

talk about his work even when it is inappropriate.

A light drinker who tapers off as the evening progresses.

others. Often singles out and associates with someone

terous. Often becomes quite sarcastic about others'

behavior..

A very light drinker who either drinks only because he

has to or refuses to drink at all. Is usually not reully

(Check the most appropriate description.)

A hactive, alert individ un with a purposeful stride who appears

to have a very practical mind. He enjoys. "fixing things,

pears fo have sound knowledge of automobiles, and drives in c

relaxed efficient manner.

An active individual who is somewhat standoffish (or negative)

toward others. His stride is fast and intent. He appears to

have a practical mind, is quite possessive and protective and

is reluctant to share his possessions with othiers.. He "Fixes

things" in a matter.-of-fact way, appedrs to have good know

ledge of automobiles, and drives in a determined (sometimes

even hostile) but efficient monner.

An active, alert individual with a free-ard-easy stride who

appears most of the time to be in good humor. Seldom tries

to fix things, but is often quite good at getting others to fix

things for him. He appears to have little knowledge of auto-

mobiles büt drives in a relaxed, efficient manner.

An active individual who has a cautious linge to his walk as

though he is easily embarrassed or easily startled. He appears

rather helpless and awkward when he has to "fix things." He :

evidently has little knowledge of automobiles and drives in à

careful (sometimes tense) but efficient manner.

A well-controlled and attentive individual who walks in

something of a clipped, formal manner. Although generally

practical, he seldom will do anything by "feel." He must

read up and prepare himself when required to "fix things."

He appeais to have acquired considerable knowledge about

automobiles but. drives in a somewhat mechanical or highly

controlled manner.

A well-controlled individual who is often somewhat preoccu-

pied even in his walk. When he takes time to "fix things" he

does so with intensity and precision. He is often very well

read about automobiles and cares for his cor or sees that it is

cared for meticulously. However, when involved in conver-

but usually krows the best places to get things done and is

inclined to be quite particular in how things are done for

the mechanics of an automobile, but appreciates and takes

good care of a good automobile. He drives with confidence,

but usually at o fast pace with nor too much awareness of

À rather nervous and temperamental person who walks rap-

idly and rather awkwardly. He has little or no interest in

"fixing things" and is inclined to ignore or throw away

loud, he is rarely unpleasant or objectionable. Most of the

time, his good humor is contagious.

He is a hearty fellow who, when he laughs, does so with con-

siderable gusto. However, he is frequently dour and sometimes

He is a good-humored fellow who sometimes can be corsidered

jolly and carefree. His humor is clever and well timed: He is

quite sensitive to the moods and feelings of others and often

con do a good job appropriately livening up a party: Although

something of a tease, he is never cruel or insensitive.

He is generally a rather quiet and somewhät complacent person

who, at times, con be surprisingly gay and corefree. However;

when gay, he sometimes overdoes it and causes some strain for

those around him. His humor is often clever but he con be

quite sarcastic and even biting on occasion.

He is an urbane fellow, generally quite conventional and appro

priate. He does not necessarily appear to be a humorléss, persón,

but hè seldom displays his sense of humor. It is sometimes diffi-

cult to tell whether he is in a good humor, because of the way...

he covers or controls his feelings.

His humor is more studied

than spontaneous yet it is never crude or inappropriate.

He is a dour and húmorless person, always serious and intense.

It is difficult to joke around him partly because he is not re-

sponsive and partly because he seems to disapprove.

He is a sensitive, sophisticated fellow. with a subtle wit. He

can be quite charming and amusing in the right sort of setting.

However, there is something of an aristocratic quality to his

sense of humor and he.can be quite condescending towards

peoplé who do not understand or appreciate his sense of humor.

He is an arty, somewhat cynical person who can be quite

flippant at times. His humör tends to be a bit far out. He

seems to have private jokes he shares with intimates. It is

sometimes difficult to tell whether he is being amusing or

subtly hostile:

None oi these fit. I would describe him as:

He is prone. to hold a woman's hand overly:

long when talking to her. and frequently puts his arms ground

women he admires.. He often. use's flattery and compliments

but does so rather graciously. Most women usually like his

oftentiveness.

He is a sensual person, but is embarrassed and insecure about

it.. He is a rather soft. man who tries hard to be inoffensive.

However, he will frequently follow altractive women with his

eyes when he thinks no one is looking: He is also prone fo.

brush against or touch women "accidentally" whenever he gets

a chance.

He is a self-confident, rather polished person who is proper

and conventional with either men or women.

He is always

considerate and polite with all women and it is difficult to

ascertain what his sexual attitudes and interests might be.

In.a.group, he.always.behaves @ccording to protocol and

usuälly can be quite efficient in doing so.

He is a self-confident and precise person who has something

of the air of á professional man äbout him. 'He is polite;

almost to a fault, and is inclined to go out of his way to

light a woman's cigarette or see that she is properly token

care of. Nevertheless, he shows considerable distance in

his relations with women. Somelimes his formality is out

of place, but he will rarely, if ever, change his manners

or procedures to fit the situation.

He is a charming, urbane person and both friendly and

sophisticated. He deals with women in a cultured way.

but shows little sensuality or sexual inappropriateness.

He is neat, even dapper, and can, be quite fastidious.

Most of his relations with women appear. to be quite pla-

tonic. He is the kind of person who likely has several

very close friends who are women.

He is a somewhat shy and indifferent person whom soime

people consider odd'or unusual. He shows little or no

interest in women in public. In general, he is a preoc-

cupied.person who only seeks out people with similar

• interests. There is al ascetic, asexual air about him

most of the time.

Subject initially

refused to cooperate on the grounds that he does not want to got

involved in this type of business and that he had given the same

ansver to "the other aide."!. He readily admitted that he has boon

under intensive development by Valentin LOGINOV (201-285412) to spot

Mexicia students who eventually may go to NOLADY; he denied, however,

that he has ever accepted the money LOGINOY continually offorg him.

Subject volunteered that Yurly. CHIRNYSH (201-825743) is currently

developing one of Subject's students (which we knew), and that Subject

woüld like to foll CHERNYSH's attempt.

2., In spite of Subject'e expressions of réluctance to be recruit.

ho

anawerod a number of questions put to him by KARTASUK and he

agreed to a 10110w-up meeting

on February. At that meeting; he

submitted to more intensive questioning about his background, family,

and his association witb the"

FISTEAL community.

There were no sttempts

at evasion and many of his answers were corroborated by information

that was already known tron other sources. Subject agreed to continue

meeting clandestinely with KARTASUK and to provide additional

Information

on his contacts With LOGINOV and other menbers-ot the KGB.

Subject's activities inzediately following the pitch voro

monitored closely by LIEMBRACK and by LIFEAT for the week between tha

The second meeting sas counter-surveilled with negativo

results.: Although the recruitment 1s still tenuous,

we beliove that.

It can be firuly cemented and that Subject is committed whether or

to Subject and I from the beginning have had a vory friendly

and Informal relationship. He 1s an Intelligent person with a

sense of humor.

Politically,

he 1s pro-American to the point that he magnifies our strengths

and positive qualities and tends to minimise or overlook negative

factors in our socioty. Subject knows I am with the Political

Section of the Embassy and that I häve been in the Soviet Union.

LOG: "OK, until the next thon."

6 From this conversation, it appeared that GAZIYEV was

probably talking about subject, since:

(a) GAZIYEV had been taking Spanish at the Mexican-North

American Institute and I knew from Subjoct that subject had had

• GAZIYEV in one of his classes, that Subject occasionally chatted

with GAZIYEV after class, and that GAZIYEV had once given Subject

an invitation to a Consular night at the Soviet Embassy (although

Subject told me he had not gone).

(b) Subject had gotten married that month.

(c). Subject had just returned to Mexico with his bride.

(d) subjoct and his wife were looking for an apartment.

(a) Subject normally arrived at the Instituto at 1800.

to teach evening Spanish classes.

7 Prior to this reported telophone conversation, I had

considered using Subject as an

access agent against GAZIYEV;

but had decided not to approach

Subject on the matter unlesg

there was evidence that his relationship with GAZIYEV was

developing Into something more than occasional chats between

classes.

I did not see much potential in approaching Subject.

such a busy and hectic life that I would get very littlo out

of him. Prior to bla marriage, ho wis kreping such a hectic

schedule botween his Institute and private classes that ho

wasn't sleeping or eating proporly and was having increasing

probiens with his health. If anything, his pace and health

problems increased after his marrlage and hile taking of the

Job with the Amorican School (although he gave up most of his

private Classes)

8. Since the GAZIYEV-LOGINOV conversation made Subject's

rolations with the Soviets look much more interesting, I

attempted,

to find out what I could about them from subject.

Por a number

of reasons, however--including my, going to the States in June

wo were not ablo to get together, until ll July. On that date

I took subject to a belated "bachelor'e lunch" at a ilttio

Spanish restaurant downtowns

9, The lunch was disappointing and, for mo, misleading.

I was certain that if given the opportunity, Subject would

voluntarily tell me if his relationship with GAZIYEY had

developed any further.. When I casually brought the conversation

around to GAZIYEV, however, Subject simply told me that GAZIYEV

was still studying at the Institute and that he stil? occasionally

chatted with him' in the halls or over a cup of coffee in one.

of the near-by coffee shops during the 20-minute break between

the two evening classes.

Subject commented that he enjoyed

talking with GAZIYEV, as he was a simpatico, interesting guy,

as well as an outstanding Spanish student. He also added that

they never talked polltics.. In reply to an offhand question

about whether he had not any other Soviets through GAZIYEV, Subject

## Page 205

said that ho had

_not. My inclination was to bellovo Subject, and

I went away thinking that other GAZIYEV and LOGINOV had been

talking about someone else over

the phone. or that they had

never gone boyond the stage of simply talking about Subject.

20.

On 1 Nromber 1967, I ran Into Subjoct and his brother

Javlor In Sanborns-Insurgentes. They were about to have a

quick

lunch and inoisted that I join then for a cup of coffoe:

As soon as we sat down, Subject told me he had a problem and

would Liko my advico. Ho said GAZIYEV had given him an invitation

to the 7 Novembor colobration of the Rovolution at the Soviet

Embassy, and although he would like to go for the experienco,

he was very concerred that his name would be put on "the black

Ilst" at tho U.S. Embassy If he went.

He said that he had

tried to call me at the Embassy after he got the invitation to

ask my advice, but had been told I was out of town. (I was In

El Paso from 25-29 October.

He stated that if he had not been

able to reach me in the next day or tho, ho was going to simply

walk into the Embassy and ask to see someone from the "security

department" about his predicament. what did I think he should

do?

11. I told Subject to relax and forget about going to the

U.S. Embassy, as the Embassy would not give him any advico

other than to tell him that it was entirely his own business

whather he went to the Soviet reception or not. Besides, I

asked, what

made Subject think his name would be put on a

"black list" if he went. Subject replied that he didn't know

how the U.S. Embassy did it, but "everyone knew" the Ves.

Embassy obtained the names of everyone who went in and out of

the Soviet Embassy. Moreover, he said, evon 1f the U.3. Embassy

rafused to siro him uny advico, at least it mould makpurecare

of into risit and anyone who was aver interested would he

hoart was in the right place. He simply did not want and couldn't

afford to got into any trouble with the U.S. Embassy, he said.

Artor all, ho had an American idfe, he might want to go to the

States to study sometime; and thoy might even want to go to

tho Statos to llve someday. Seeing that subject was indeed very

sorious; I becamo more sorlous myself and told him that just so

he wouldn't worry, I'd write a memo to the propor Embassy

department stating for the sake of the rocord that subject had

told me he planned to attend a Soviet Embassy roception, but

wished the U.S. Embassy to know ho was doing. it sololy out of

curlosity and was in no way th sympathy idth the Soviet Union.

Subject

seemed greatly relloved and thanked me very much.

Iz, seizing of the fact that GAZIYEV had givon subject the

Invitation, I asked If Subject saw much of him anymore. Subject

replied that yos, he still saw him occasionally, as GAZIYEV was

now studying English at

the Institute. subjoct added, on his

own initiative, that he had also been to GAZIYEY's apartment

twice and had met another Soviet there on one occasion. He said

that the first time he went to GAZIEVes was shortly before he

(Subject) got married (Subject ma was married about mid-April

1967) and the second time was shortly after his marriago, as he

and his wife had gona to dinner at the CAZIYEVS'.. Subject finished

eating about this time; and since he was in a hurry and had

his brother with him, I didn't try to question him any further,

but decided to walt and have à second go at him alone anothar

13.

My wifo and I entortnined subjoct and his wifo at our

home on 27 November, but the eventig was not mennt to and did

not afford an opportunity to discung the Soviets any further:

Subjoct did tell me, howover, that he had not gone to the

7 November Soviet recoption afterall, because, despito by

assurances that there wás no reason for him not to 60, ho

folt it. was simply safer to stay away foon the Soviet Embassy

altogether.

At my suggestion, we agreed to got-togother for

lurch sometimo in the near future.

14. For varlous reasons, Including the poor state of

SubJect's health when I called him one day in January, wo did

not got together for the lunch until 7 Narch, This time, I

played it straight with subject, told him that I was interested

In anything he could tell me about GAZIYEY and the othersoviet

he had met, and questioned him closely regarding the details.

Subject was completely cooperative; and I am satisffed he answered

my questions to

the best of his ability. It seemed to me, and

still does, that there was only one possible reason why Subject

had not told me on ll July what he subsequently told me on

I November (1.e., that he had been to GAZIYEV's home twice and

on one occasion had met another Soviet there).. This was that

he falt, somewhat guilty about going to GAZIYEV's and meeting

the other Soviet there, and as long as I didn't push him too

hard (which I didn't on 'll July), he felt more comfortable

ignoring it. The reason he so readily mentioned the two visits

and the other Soviet on l November was, I think, that he was

genuinely concerned not to "get into any trouble" with the U.S.

Embassy over attenline the Soviet Embassy reception, wished to

Impress me with his sincerity about whose side he was on, and

folt obliged to complotoly clear the rocord by montioning the

visits to GiZIYEV's home and meeting the other soviet there.

15. Subject stated that GAZIYEV had invited him to his

apartment for dinner about a month before he (Subject) wont to:

Chicago to get married. This means that the dinner took place

about mid-March 1967. Subject said he had expected to find

only GAZIYEV and his wife in the apartment, but that a third

person was there when Subject arrived. _ Subject said. GAZIYEV.

introduced the third person as Valentin "something." When I

asked if the last name were LOGINOV, Subject Immediately reacted

and said he was almost positive that was It. Subject's description

of the Soviet also fit LOGINOY. GAZIYEY stated that LOGINOV wag

with the Embassy (Subfect couldn't remember in what capacity) and

described LOGINOY as a good friend. Subject said that the evening

started off very casually, with LOCINOV expressing interest

In the Spanish courses at the Mexican-North American Institute.

LOGINOV, who Subject noted spoke almost as good Spanish as most

of the Spanish teachers at the Institute, said he'd like to get

a certificate in Spritsh from the Institute and asted Subject 15

he could help him enroll, choose the best course for him to.

start with, ote.

Subjuct replied that he'd be happy to, although

It didn't seem to him that LOGINOV needed much instruction in

Spanish. LOGINOV simply laughed this off, and it was agreed

LOGINOV would drop around to the Institute sometime soon.

LOGINOV, who took the lead in the conversation most of the

evening, then began to ask subject questiong which loft subjoct

most.of LOGINOV's questions, but he did rocall that LOGINUV.

began the feeling-out procedure by asking Subject if he didn't

find that the Americans were much poorer at learning Spanish

than other nationalition. Ho also mado various derogatory

remarks about the extent of American Influence in Mexico. Subject

said that after about ten minutes, LOGINOV's purpose became so

blatantly obvious; that he (Subject) stopped the conversation

and told LOGINOY that bofore they went any farther, he thought

LOGINOV should know that ho was talking to convone who was

"100, capitalist, " completoly pro-merican, and had absolutely

no sympathy with communist. (hile this gounds awfully blunt

and Subject was unquestionably trying to make himself look good

in my oyes, the fact of the matter 1a that subject does tend to

be ast a bit blunt at times, and khowing his ideological leanings,

I would not put it past him to have said exactly this.) Subjoct

said that LOGINOV tried to backtrack a bit after this, but the

conversation heated up again a few minutes later when Subject

conmented that he had a pretty good idea of what the Soviets were

up to in Mexico. When LOGINOV asked what Subject meant, Subjoct

related the story he

once told me about having been in Veracrus

a few years ago when a Soviet ship was actually or virtually put

under arrest there.

Subject toid LOGINOV that feveryone knew

the ship was loaded with Communist propaganda."

16. After about twenty minutes, according to subject, politica

were dropped and the conversation turned to nore innocuous toples.

## Page 210

210

Subject said. that LOGINOY secmod somewhat. irritatod with him, but

on the wiole kopt his composuro very well and treatod Subject

politaly for the two hours or logs subjoct remilned. lo subjoct

was leaving, LOGINOV again said ho'd come by tho Inatituto to

sub jnot in the neur futuro, but ho novor did.

"Ono day to

lato 1967 Subjoct say LOGINOV. at tho gas station on tho corner

of Tacubaya and Juanacatlan, and LOGINOV greeted Subject by

nams.. However, thoy did not converge with each other.

17:

Subject

said that GAZIYEV loft most of the politically

related part of the conversation to LOGINOV and nevor referred

to the ovening again. Howover, a fow woeks after Subject

returnod to Moxico with his bride, GAZIYEV had Subjoct and his

wifo over to dinner (thie would place the secönd dinner in

about mid-Mar)...

This time GAZIYEV and his wife were the only

others present, and the ovening

passed ilthout any roference

to politics.

Subject shated that he still occasionally goes

across the street for a cup of coffee with GAZIYEV betweem

ovening classes at the Institute, but that he has not been

to GAZIYEV's apartment again and has never had GAZIYEV to his

home •

18.

Although Subject was very aware that LOGINOVes purpose

in meeting him was to assosa his exploitability, he did not seem

to fully appreciate that GAZIYEV had both fingered him for

LOGINOV and set up the situation for LOGINOV to meet him. I'

spelled this out for Subject and also informed him that LOGINOV

swas an exceptionally capable Soviet intelligence officer. I

also explained that It was very possible GAZIYEV was using the

Institute: to spot other candidates for interviows with

Sovlat

intelligenco officers, and questionod subjoct about GAZIYEV!s

activitlos and contacts at the Institute. However, Subject said

that as far as ho could toll GAZITEY probly much atuck to himself

at the Institute and did not have any particudas friondo there

whom subject knew about. Subjoct sald he would keep his oyes .

open for the type of thing I was looking for, however, and would

let no know 1f he came onto anything interesting. Subjoct also

offered to "play up tor GAZIYEV and/or LOGINOV under my guidanco

If I wished, but I doclinod the offer with appropriato expressions

of appreciation

19. The question that reming unanswered after all this 1s,

of course, why LOGINOV and GAZIYEY wore talking about subjoct

over tho phone on 24 April 1967: According to. Subject, tho

dinner which LOGINOV attended took place in March 1967, whilo

LOGI NOY did not attend GAZIYEV's second dinner, which took

place about mid-May: Since I am satlafled Subjoct told me the

truth, it would appear that the "certain things" which LOGINOV

told GAZIYEV on 24 April ho wished to discuss with GAZIYE

concerned hoy to handle Subject in the light of the LOGINOV-

Subject encounter in March. Whatever LOGINOV had in mind on

24 April, It would appear that it was finally decided that

GAZIYEV and his wife should simply have Subject and his wife

over to a peaceful dinner in order to at least partially erase.

the memory of the first dinnor.

delivered a package sont by

his Acapulco friend and managed to

navo one or two mectings with representatives of the LIRING

commercial Section (to discuss the possibilits of "trading"

with PBRUMEN),' it was decided in the end that LIfELIC-l's

access to LIRING was too superficial to be of any grent benefit.

This decision was bolstered by the departure. for PBRUNEN in

April 1968 of LIRELIC-I'S PBRUMEN friend, who left for what

ippears to be an extended visit to try to solve complicated

personal problems.

Thus, with the "shelving" of possible

oporational activitios asainst LIRING, LIOGLE became LiRELIC-l's

only target in April of this year.

Unlike his contacts with the French, LIREILN-1!s

dealings with LIRELIC-l have bech completely clandestine.

RONTON spoke with FRADIER for about two

minutes in the corridor after receiving the

envelope containing

the money.

In reply to

FRADYER's queries,

RONTON stated that LIREALN-1

was somewhat disippointed that he could not

provide him with some sort of written contract

for. LIRELIC-1 and also because of the delay in

reimbursing him for operational expenses (some

-of which had been disallowed).

RONTOS then

revealed to FRADYER

that LIREALM-l was waiting

for him at the Sanborns bar so that he could

pass him the money without further delay.

FRADYER then regretted that he had been unable

to see LIREALN-1 personally to explain the

disallowance of some of the expenses.

suggested that FRADYER might take thịs

opportunity to say a few words to LIREJLN-1,

especially since the

FRADYER agreed but said

that he preferred the gift section of Sanborns

ROWTON explained

that he was late because of

LIREALN-1

then paid the bill and accompanied ROwTOY up

only in ROUTON's home,

the main Mexico City bull ring) beticon regular meotings to.

pass him funds.

'ROWTON. hnd never met with LIREALM-I at

Sanborns or in any other public place prior to this. meeting.

LIREALM-I also amplified his written report sub-

sequently in one significant dotail.

In rcforence to the

remark of LoGIlOV to the offect that he had scen' him with his

boss at Sanborns two Wednesdnys previously when "you had a

drink in the bat and then talked to your boss,'

LIREALN-1 told

ROWTON on reflection that LOGINOV had also stated that "you

were having a drink at the bar and a man came up to you and

brought you to your -boss."

This indicates

that FRADYER was

meant as the person described as LIKEALN-l's boss.

With regard to where and now often ROWTON ánd

LIREALM-1 have hid'operational mootings in the past,

requested in paragraph 3 of jeference B, Station

thät between 20 October 1967 and 16 Janualy 1968 ROWTON met

with LIREALM-l at his home ten times.: Besides these meetings

with LIREALN-1

at his home, ROWTON recalls only two other noctings

with LIREALN-1, when ho picked up LIREALN-1 in his can for briel

meetings to pass him funds.

Since the LOGINOV/LIREALM-1

ROWTON has met. with LIREALN-1 at obscure bar's to avoid

possible positive identification of ROWTON in the event.

LIREAiN-I was under surveillance.

'LIREALN-1 has passed his

reports to ROWTON between their wookly meetings via a P.O.

letter drop taken out previously by LIREALN+} under allas.

The only telephone contact that has existed between them has

been brief calls to ROWTON's home by LIREALN-l alerting ROWTON,

double talk, that he has left an envelope at the drop.

With regard to the frequency of LÍREALM-l's meetings

LOGINOY, mentioned in paragraph 4 of reference B,

LIREALN-1's contact reports

list only four meetings during

the same period,

all of which occurred at the French Club,

one of which, on 2 November 1967, was a casual encounter at

which very few words were exchanged.

It is significant to note,

that at the 12 November 1967 meeting, while LIREALM-1

and LOGINOV were chatting

in the showers after the match,

his continuing conticts with LoGItor were at the latter's

intliative and that LIREALinl Hould not make

any altongt to

LIREALN-1 did not

toport sceing LOGINOV again until 13 January. 196S (tro months

late'), this timo, as usual; on the tonis court.

Headquater's will socall that the LIkEALN-l relation-

with the Soviets

dates back many months pilor to the

date ROWTON took over his handling.

The file reveals that

LIREALN-1 first met LOGINOY ou 22 April 1907, and that at.

that timo. LOGINOV proposed to LIRFALN-1 that

they meet

regulaily,. every Wednesday, for tennis and occasionally take

In n movie with their wives.

This leaves no

doubt that the

paco was set by LOGINOV himself since he undoubtedly sau

in

LIREALN-1 a potential target.

The situation

was further

complicated by the character and modus operandi of LOGINOY,.

as woll as the limitations of LIkEALl-l's cover situation at

the time...

A principal dilemma facing tho Case Officer with

regiud to LIREALi-l's exposure to the soviets has been his

regular attendance at the French Club. Since the French

has boon one of the min ones

left to LIREALN-1 after the

olimination of the sovict,

Indonesian, and VAR operations, it

was considered necessaiy for LIREALN-I to continue his nornal

contacts with the French.

He could have dropped his menbership

in the club to avoid further involvement with the Soviets,

but this would lave broken a long established pattern and

deprived him of his principal access at that time.

It was

therefore ruled out as counterproductive:

• Subsequent developments appear to confiim the

Station's view

that LOGINOV based his provocative remark on

a hunch ox, at most,

on a strong suspicion concerning

LIREALN-1.

As- mentioned in paragraph 1 of reforence B, such

prolonged social contact between an American and a Soviet

nis almost inevitably

construed on both sidos to have intel-

ligence.connotations." The Station wishes to emphasize,

whatever suspicions were aroused in the mind

of LOGINOV concerning LIREAL!-l were already generated months

before he joined the PBRUNEY Section in late October 1967.

10: In conclusion,

the Station feels that nothing has

been noted in the subsequent operational activity of FRADER

or ROWTON to indicate that either of them has been identified

as an intelligence operative. ROWTON has had no contact of any

kind with Soviets in this area, nor has he detected any

surveillance, either physical or technical, of his person

or home.

Both he and FRADYER, however, will continue to

maintain maximum

security to avoid any

further exposure to

such persons as LOGINOV:

LIRE LN-1, on his part, has been

able to

improve his cover by opening an office and making his

overt activity as plausibly commercial as possible.

reimbursement of those expenses alloved by the Station.

brush contact was arranged for this purposo in the passage-

way leading to the Koala Restaurant, as ROWTON indicatod that

LIREAL-l. needed the moncy as soon!

as possiblo.

At the agreed

time the undersigned passed an envelopo to Routon, whos

informed the undersigned that LiRALN-T was walting in the

downstairs cafeteria of the Sinborns building:

The undersigned,

who had not seen LIREALM-1 at Christmas time and schuinely

regretted the lact that the latter had to pay for oporational

expenses out of his pocket, agreed to seo LIneALN-l for a

few minutes..

When the undersigncd refusod to go to the

downstairs Sanborns cafeteria,

RONTON suggested that he fetch

LIREALN-l and bring him to tho silver shop upstairs in the

same building.

A 15-minute mooting (longer than expected)

The meeting started a

Tho following is a verbatin extract of the report

written by LinEAkill on this meeling:

I had joined Val and my wife on her

thé court for small talk with val.

He apologized

foi interrupting our game and suggested we go back:

to playing and he would watch us.

We had made. a

date for tennis Wednesday.

He would call me if his

•leg still bothered him or for ay other reason he

was unable to play.. Now he said he wanted to study

my game so that he

could beat me Wednesday:

walked with me as far as the net where he stopped

me and the following conversation took place.

"I saw you talking with your boss the other

day," Val said with a slight grin."'"

"My boss?" I asked. I suspected nothing and

serlously considered the question:

I recalled that i had once pointed Val

out tó him..

The conversation proceeded too rapidly,

my own question.

The fact is:

"Two Wednesdays ago...

At Sanborns?

You're mistaken.

My boss left about six weeks ago--

almost two months ago.

Val and I laughed.

Until this moment I was

By TO A TATe TA The Mace To do one into:

by. mo or

thint ho stood watching us:

The undersigned reported the rbove to his superiors

as soon as ho received LIRAL-i's report. A check of the

LIEMpTY log for 17 January showed that LOGINOV had left the

Sovlot Embassy at 1404 and had returned at 1708 hours. This

mado his prosence at Sanborns at the time of the mecting

between LIREALM-l; ROWTON, and the undersignod impossible,

as it would have given him about 10 minutes to leave the site

of tho mooting, got into lils car, and divo to the Soviet

an impossible feat even in light traffic. It is

Embassynon that LOGINOV was not present at the time of the

möeting but was told that LIREALM-I met with two. Americans.-r

It way-and still is the undersigned's conviction that whoever

saw LIREALM-1 was unable, to positively identify ROWTON or

tho undorsigned.

The undersigned reasons that had LOGINOV

known that ho, the undersigned, had talked to LIREALi-1,

LOGINOV would

have, montioned his name after failing.to

,,obtain

iny reaction

from, LIREALM-I from mentioning the

latter's "boss!"

The undersigned believes that LOGINOV, who

is not completely stupid, would have either said nothing or

would have gone all the way in his statements to LIREALI-l

had ho known the undersigned's name.

By the same token it

appears that LOGINOV failed to identify ROWTON.. The

undorsigned had only mot with one othei Soviet besides

LOGINOV at the time of the meeting, and that only once; and

that Soviot was no longer in Mexico City when the meeting

with LIRALM-I took place. RONTOV has never had any contact,

social or otherwise, with any of the soviets.

The undersigned is the first to recognizo that meeting

with LIREALM-I at the Sarborns silver shop vas a thoroughly

unwise move: He wishes

to emphasize that this was the only.

meeting at the time that he had held with LIrEALM-1 outside

of a satehouse.' All meetings between the undersigned and

LIREALM-I have

since been held under the most secure con-

ditions on the edge of the Federal District and, in one case,

beyond.

while this does not make this decision

any wiser, he

also wants to emphasize the fact that' it was made on the spur

of the moment, to quote the old cliche, because the undersigned

"felt sorry" for LIREALM-1 because ot

the latter's financial

difficulties with the Station over his last accounting.

The

undersigned unwisely put LIREAL-l's morale for a brief moment.

over basic security considerations.

He is not in the habit

of doing this

as a matter of course.

The day before his nest

scheduled tennis meeting with LIREALM-l the following Wednesday,

LOGINOV called LIREALN-1 and asked to be excused as his leg

had worsoned.

The week after that LOGINOV showed up for his

regular

tennis game with LIREALN-l but made no mention of

his previous

conversation with him two weeks before.

The

undersigned waited to complete a review of this case until

he met LOGINOV face to face at one of the Consular Association

functions.

Because of the visits of Soviet athletes

and

artists which kept LOGINOV busy, however,

this meeting did not

materialize until 28 March.

Although the undersigned and

LOGINOV talked to each other off and on for more

than two hours

on this occasion during a visit to the local Home Falr, LOGINOV

never mentioned anything about the Sanborns meeting.

He has

never brought LIREALN-l's name to the attention of the

From her account it was obvious that she was extremoly

Impressed with LOGINOV both physically ("ho 1s such a handsome

From her conversationa she corcluded that he liled

Americany and was Interested in meating them, that he is really

Interested in learning English so that be can go to the United Statos

In the course of approximately 125 visits to the

occasion has seen as many as three guards in

the gatchouse .at one

but there has usually been only one guard presont when he

has entered and exiled the gale (usually auout 0915 and 1145,

respectively, on Mondays and Fridays prior to mid-January 1907,

and 1800 on Tuesdays and Thursdays fron mid-January

to mid-lay 1957):

Even when more than ore guard has been present,

(201-271103), Ivan Fedorovich SOLOMATIN (201-307933), and Nikolay

Ivanovich ZAKHAROV (201-779285) •

"To gain entry through the foot gate;

the would-be visitor

presses the white doorbell button

to: the left of the loot gate..

button rings a buzzer inside the gatehouse.

The guard on duty

promptly looks through the observation

Window which directly faces

the footgate.

If, presumably,: the guard is satisfied that the

callers do not look dangerous or suspicious, he disengages

the gate: latch electronically by pressing.one.of. the two release

-buttons inside. the

gatehouse:

'After the gate latch disengages; it-

is up to the caller to push (or, when the caller is leaving, pull)

the gate open and then

close it

behind him.

The gale locks

automatically when closed.

According to LIROCKEl-1, there is a

keyhole on the inside of the sate, but there definitely is no keykole

•on the outside. LIROCKET-1 has never seen anyone opcn the gate

with a key.

LIROCKET-1 has been present in only about five instances

when

non-soviets in vehicles have. sought. admittance through the

vehicle gale, which is adjaceni to the coot gate.

In each of 'the

five

instances; the callers have been delivery men whose trucks

have apparently been recognized by the guard. In cach instance,:

the truck has pulled up with its nose to the rehicle bate and the

guard has walked to the gate and opened it manually... The vehicle

gate consists of two doois which open inward.

It is secured by

one dead bolt: frón one door to the other. -LIROCKET-l has never

noticed a padlock. on the gate.. After being admitted to the Embassy

the trucks in each

case have driven unaccompanied to and

parked under the portecochere on the north side of the main Embassy

building. After closing the gate, the guard has returned to the

gätehouse,

where - although LIROCKET-l has never actually

observed

a guard doing so

- he has evidently telcphoned

someone inside the

main building to give notification of the truck's arrival:

LIROCKET-I has been present perhaps 25 times when pedestriah

callers. (delivery men, students, persons on

rung the foot gate buzzer, and in each instance the guard has

routinely let them in without going

or observe them more closely.

to the gate to question them

On one occasion,

as many as four

young Mexican males who appeared

to be university students rang

the buzzer while LIROCKET-I was inside the gatehouse, and the guard

let them in in the routine manner..

Once Inside the gate,

the pedestrian caller is exfected

to present himself at the gatehouse door,

which is usually left

open, and state his business.

then either goes next

door. to summon an Embassy official from one of the two offices oft

the Reception Room, or, as in Subject's case, uses the inteiphone

someone inside the main building.

(In LIROCKET-l's case,

che guard calls one of his Soviet students.)

Il instrucled to have

the

caller wait, the guard shows him into the Reception room.

LIROCKET- hinsolf has been asked to wait in the Reception Room

about 55

times. On approximately 15 occasions, he has

been invited

into the gatehouse by the guard on duty lu chai.

On the latter

occasions, he has either remained in the gaicinuse until one of his

Soviet studenls has appeared io escort him into the main building

or has loft the gatchouse after a fes minutes and gone

Offices off

Reception Room•

There ile

tro offices ufi

the licception loom.

The first office is known tro

uther.sourccs

to be used for visa inteivions.

The second office is presumably

used for the same púrpose. The first offico. opers directly into the

heception room.

The sccond office is at the back of the 'itst

office and is entered either through the first office or through

an outside door.

(LIROCKET-] has never secn

the outside door used,

however.

One or both'or the offices vere occupied by Snviets

about 20 of the roughly 10 times LIROCKIT-l was in the leception

rom prior to mid-January 1967 (usually on Monday and Friday

mornings betwcon. 0915 and 0930).

The Soviets Ircquently left. the:

dour to the first office, and somewhat less ficquently to the

second oifice, open when they were present.

The first door or both

doors were sonetimes also left open when no soviet was present.

When the door to the first office or the doors to both offices

were open and LINOCKIT-l sat opposite the door to the first office,

he could

see about a quarter-of the interior of the first oifice

and a small part of the interior of the second office.

11 though

official soviet visa hours are only ou Tuesdays ind Fridays

(from 1100-1300), LIROCKET-l saw Soviets in both offices with

about

equal

frequency on lionday

and: Friday mornings.: From that LIROCKET-I

could sec,

the Soviets rarely seemed to be busy with desk work,

but confined themselves to looking uver newspapers, opening mail,

chatting with each öther,. etc.

Frequently sovicts

went into one

of the offices for just a moment and then left.

Since LINOCKIT- 1

has begun going to the Imbassy about 1530 on Tucsdays and Thursdays,

however,

he has always found the door to the first office shut and

-both offices evidently empty..

(COMMENT:

This is probably explaine:

by the fact that the Imbassy lunch break is

iron 1100-1000).

LIROCKET- recently had occasion to visit Valentin

stepped into the first office

•to.see

¿UGINOV at 1830 on a Tuesday,

but LOGINOY was just leaving

and LIROCKET-I did not stay.

LIROCKET-] has never been inside the

second office.

His sketch

of the second office is based on what

he'has been able to see from the Reception Room and the first office

In order not to scen curious, he purposcly did not 100k around the

first office when he was' in it and consequently-does not know what

kind of furnishings, if

ans, are on the far side of the first office

From January 1966

to January 1967, LINOChiel was in the

kcception Room on 8-10 occasions when

other non-soviet visitor's

came in.

The Soviet intervicker ushered

the visitors into one of

the offices and closed the door to the first oifice

on about four

of these occasions.

On tro occasions,

the sovict intervivner

ushered the visitor into the first oifico und did not bothet iu

close the duor.

On four or five occasions,

the soviet interviewer

came out into the leceprion Room to talk with ile visitor in

LINOCKET-l'S presence.

In each of the sir or seven

boon approached by folACT, but this tes clearly the lapilestion.

Subjoct told the INPURs officor that he vas willing to supply informa-

tion he considerod unusual or especially. interesting, but vas not.

willlag: to supply, luformation on a routine insis.

The Station had no contact. gith Subject botreen 6 January

and 28 Septonber 1966. On 20 September..

the station learned fros

LICOZY -5 thit Subject

ha: boen invited along sith soveral other

dexican travel agents to attend an Intourist conference in Moscoy

Irom 24-29 Cctober: A meeting was consequently arranged with Subject

for 28 Septender through the INPUR& officer.

1. " Subject told the statton officer who net his that de had

been meaning to

contact the Station about his forthconing trip,

which,

he said,

he

rosaned. was what the case officer wanted to talk about.

He gave the case officor a copy of his lavitation to the Intourist

conference and ou his own inftiative offered to prövide the Station

with &

full report of the conference when he returned.

Horayer, he

stated that he was not intorested in vorking for the Station on a

permanent,

"agent" basis, in heeting under clandestine circunstances,

or taking noney.

He was willing to help to the extont he ras, he

explained,

bocause he belloved basically what he did about current

vorld problems and, after all, had lived in YOLADY for many gears and

regarded 1t ng his

"second home".

On the basis of this interyles

and a review of Sübject's file, Subject Impressed the case officer

as a sonewhat disingenuous egost who,

despite a gonuine sympathy.

LOS MOLADY,

segardos his cooperation uith the Station primarily as a

moing of insuring his business contacts with lupure and as sosething.

bich bad to be kept to a mintnun lest it limit his Independence or:

detract him in any way fron his business and personal interests.

This impression served as the basis for the evaluation of Subject

contained In Reference A.

5..

The case officer's impression.of subject changed considerably

with the next

which was hold on 18 October.

At this seeting,

-the case officer gave

Subjectin defensive briefing for his trip and

-went over general roporting requiresents.

'Subject surprised the case

öfficer with his

friendliness and cooperativeness, and vent to great

cooporate with the

Station as long as he did not becono so deeply involved in Intelligence

work that his bustness or personal iife was adversely affoctod..

case officer was impressed by Subject's apparont sincerity and got

the definite impression that ever since recelving the Intourist invita-

Subject lad been feariul he

was again golng to be asted to

accept a double agent role which, if it materiallzed, would require

him to becone far more deeply inyolved in Intelligence work than ho

wished.

Sensing

both Subjoct's rellef at not being asked to under-

take. a

more denanding assignment and his concern to nake it clear that

his heart ms nevertheless in the right place, the case officer used

tho opportuaity

to again pose

the question of

be willing to report on a routine basis. on persons who booked travel

through his agency to the USsR.

The case officer told Subject that

this information could be formarded to the Station through the INPURE

officer and assured him that his cooperation in supplying such infor

mation would not involve hin in a sortes of escalating intelligence

assignaente.

Evidently satisfied that his role would renain a limited

one,

Subject agreed to report the desired infornation ou a regular

basis.

horeover,

he volunteered to check with other trayel agencies

in order to fulfill specific requirements for informition on travelers

to the Soviet Union who did not book their travel through his agency.

6.

Subject was thoroughly dobrioled upon his return Iron the

USSR In early November 1066, nt shich time he continued to exhibit

the sano Iriendlinoss and cooperativeness noted in paragraph live.

Be reported that he was

avare oi no allort to assess, cultivate, or

compromise biu in the USSR.

He provided inforantion

both on the

formal proceedings of the conference and on individual Sovlet and

sorelga participaito,

as où a Spanish businessaan he not in

Moscow.

This information resulted in three Fleld Intornation Reports

(HN-10,870, 30 Novomber 1966,

HNH-10,871, 30 November 1968, H44-

10,875, 30 November. 1966), one dispatch to Madrid

(HиMA-30725,

1 December 1966),

and a second to Santiago (UHMA-30749, 2 December

1966). Since furnishlog Information on his trip to the USSR,

Subject has provided information on the travel

of the Bolshol

Ballot in Mexico, on a Mexican traveler to the USSR, and

On 'a

Sovlot student kroup which was slated to visit lexico, but which

for unknown reagona falled to arrive at the last minute.

. The only Soviet Subject his recently been in contact with

1$ LOGINOY, whom he occástonally sees on visa matters.

According to

Subjoct, their relationship during the past year hag-been strictly of

s business nature and LOGINOV has shown no interest In extending it

beyond this.

Subject consequently appears to have little to offer

in tho way of an access agent to the Sovlets in the foreseeable

future.. However, as tho manager of one of five Mexican traväl

agencies represorting Intourist and because of his apparently

excellent contacts with key personnel of the other lour travel agencies,

he promises to be a useful referent on persons who book travel in.

Mexico to the Soviet Union and other Communiat countries.

Despite the regularization of our relatlonship with Subject

and his increased cooperativeness, we do not feel ve are currently

in a position to ask. him to undergo an SGSWIRL intervlen.:

The

relationship between the case officer and Subject at this time 1g

ossenttally one of equals li which Subject is voluntarily assisting.

INTORT öut of Ideological motivation..

It 1s true that his atroug

bustress interest in maintaining friendly relations with INFORT

and INPURE provides us with a degree of control, but we feel

that' at

prosent it is better left as a foru of tacit control than brandished

even subtly. It 1s our opinion that Subject would rogard an soSwIRl

intervley as an effort both to tacrease our control over bin and to

drat him deeper into the Intelligence business.

Such a reaction

could in all probability undo much of our recent progress with

Subject. Consequently, we would prefer to postpone an SGSMIBL

intervlou until oither

we further solidly our relationship with

Subject ar we

wish to use his in more sensitive fork.

BESABER first set LOGINOV casually on 14 December 1965

at a polish Embassy reception for a vialtieg Parliahentary

delegation..: No plans

were made for recontact, although cards

were exchanged and BESABER reported that LOGINOY was gulte

friendly:

2.

it was not until October 1966, almost a year later,

that BESABER again ran into LOMINOY at another Polish Embassy

roception,

this one in honor of the departing Polish Ambassador

On that occasion LOGINOV expressod an interest in buying some

of the mosates that BESABER produces

When LOGINOV: found out

that Nrs. BESABER was an avid tennis player, he let it be

known that he was too, and would enjoy getting together for

a game. (Parenthetically, he mentioned that he played rogularly

at the french Clubs

but that he did not enjoy the atmosphere

there because there were too many Germans

Finally, when

BESABER mentioned that he very much liked Russian yodka;

LOGINOV said he would

sell him some at sobassy dissount prices

3. On 13 October 1966 LOGINOV trted unsuccessfully to

contact BESABER by phone to purchase cone porales

for the

Russian athletes. ho verein. town in connection with the

ite olympices" BESABER unfortunately never. got the

message that LOGINOV. left (although ve picked it up on LIENFOY).

Per
