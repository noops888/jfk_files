INTRODUCTION.

In Reference E,

JMWAVE forwarded a review

of the nature of its relationship with

AMCARBON-2.

This review

indicates that the relationship with AMCARBON-2 evolved from that

action which was taken in September 1962 to insure that a security

breach would not occur as a result of an investigation which was

being carried out by the Identity 1 relative to the fact that the

establishment of the Identity 2 was being kept from the

South Campus as a result of security restrictions which were in some

way related to JMDUSK.

the relationship with AMCARBON-2

stemmed from the remedial action which had been taken in a crisis

situation

the establishment of a working relationship with the

Identity'' was an objective which

JMWAVE had always hoped to obtain.

As a matter of façt,

in Reference A, the recommendation was made

that JMWAVE be given approvalto contact the major South Florida

media in an attempt to work out a relationship with these news

media which would insure that they did not turn the publicity

spotlight on those KUBARK activities in South Florida which might

come to their attention. • Thus,

when a relationship was established

with AMCARBON-2, it was

carefully cultivated in order that JMWAVE

might be able to use this contact at the Identity 3 as a means of

achieving the objective of having a relationship with the Identity 3,

which would simultaneously insure the security of JMWAVE's operations

and give JMWAVE an outlet into the press which could be used

surfacing certain select propaganda items. In the period October to

As a result of this initial meeting on

12 December 1962, an operational relationship has developed with

IMCARBON-1, and it is believed that this rolationship contributes

to the fulfillment of the over-all JMWAVE mission.

a special activities report is being submitted to cover the

nature of JMWAVE's relationship with

AMCARBON-1 during the

period December 1962 to March 1964.

FRAME OF REFERENCE FOR JMWAVE'S RELATIONSHIP WITH AMCARBON-1

When AMCARBON-2 introduced AMCARBON-1 to RNUTEMAN,

AMCARBON-2

reviewed the ground rules under which he had been

This review was conducted for AMCARBON-1's

benefit, in order that he might clearly understand the frame of

reference which should prevail in his relacionships with REUTEMAN.

In this review,

AMCARBON-2 pointed out thai it was the policy

of the Identity 3 that it would take no action which would

purposely, embarrass KUBARK or its South Florida operations.

a result,.

if any embarrassing items relative to KUBARK's operations

in South

Florida did come

to the attention of the Identity 3, this

material would be brought to REUTEMAN's immediate attention.

AMCARBON-2 made it clear to AMCARBON-l that such items should be

discussed with REUTEMAN in a frank manner.

In addition, AMCARBON-2

made the point that:

after in item was discussed, AMCARBON-1

should follow REUTENAN's guidance relative to how any particularly

a padentially embar pete to sells attention and

if AMCARBON-1 brought

remedial action on the matter was not taken by REUTENAN within

a reasonable period of time,

the Identity 3 would feel free

to expose any ineptness on KUBARK's part.

AMCARBON-2 pointed

out that in return for this cooperation

from the Identity 3,

REUTEMAN had agreed that he would be available

for contact by

telephone or periodic personal meetings at which

AMCARBON -1

and ANCARBON-2 could discuss broad trends and developments in

Latin American affairs.

AMCARBON-2 advised AMCARBON -1 that this

arrangement did not mean that AMCARBON-1 could expect to obtain

any classified information from REUTEMAN.

The point was also

made that AMCARBON-L should not press for the obtaining of

classified information, but he should be alert to steering tips

which REUTEMAN might furnish him on fast-breaking news stories.

AMCARBON-1 indicated that he understood the frame of

reference

which had been

outlined by AMCARBON-4•

This frame of reference

has prevailed throughout JMWAVE's relationship with AMCARBON-1

during the period December 1962 to March 1964.

Headquarters' interest in

discrediting BANDIN was also stimulated by the fact that BANDIN's

irresponsible publicity stunts were causing problems for AMBIDDY-1.

As a result of Headquarters' interest in this matter,

REUTEMAN had

a luncheon session with AMCARBON-1 on 24 September 1963,

AMCARBON-1 was advised that the BANDIN faction of the MRR was less

than accurate in its claims relative to its

activities in Cuba.

JAWAVE that MY WAVEr PaRtSER, in assoclate editor sor the

to research a story regarding the possibility that strategic

missiles were hidden in Cuban caves.

This information enabled

JMWAVE to keep Headquarters informed on sensational-type articles

AMCRAB-1. The AMCRAB-1 defection story originally

surfaced ir the Miami area on 13 October 1963 via the Diario de

las Americas, which played up an API release from Montevideo.

The API Mortevideo

story highlighted AMCRAB-1's information

relative tc GOC activities in Uruguay.

The story in the Diario

de las Americas had an extremely limited impact on Spanish readers

in the Miani area.

As a result, it was decided to du a series

of feature stories on AMCRAB-I pointing up the fact

that AMCRAB-1

who felt

they had been betrayed by CASTRO and had been relegated to positions
