MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: SSCI Request for Document re Antonio Veciana

30 December 1976

In response to the inclosed 20 December request from

the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, on this date

I showed the NSA product on Antonio Veciana, 3/0/TRIG-CUI/T23-62

dated 29 November 1962, to SSCI staffers

Tom Moore and Howard

Liebengood.

They were quite interested in this message and

a reference to "Serafin."

They indicated that the Committee

would request a

review of all Cuban material for the period

1961-1965.

22 December 1976

MI. Burke,

Attached is a request from the SSCI.

I have talked to Fred Cassedy at the FBI

and he says that the Committee is looking

into the Kennedy assassination and that

the SSC provided Veciana's name.

I intend to contact Howard Liebengood

next week and will probably arrange for

the SSCI to review the document out here

at that time.
