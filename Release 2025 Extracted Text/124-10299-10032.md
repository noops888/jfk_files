His Excellency has received your cable.

You have left His Excellency's office with the impression

(B val that he) was willing to offer the new Ambassador the

most loyal and frank collaboration.

However, a certain stiffening has characterized the first

contact between TIMMONS and Foreign Minister CHALMERS and

Deputy Foreign Minister RAYMOND at the Foreign Ministry

Building.

The Foreign Ministry's general opinion is that he is the

least qualified at the present time and that his presence could

be fatal for the resumption of relations.

(B val Anticipating) the Ambassador's arrival, NORMAN

WARREN, JOHNACEY and (B val company) have redoubled their

ardor against the President.

I believe that it is preferable to make these transfers

without the opinion of any unfriendly person. This action

is always considered unfriendly.

President DUVALIER has asked for these recalls to permit

Ambassador TIMMONS to be the [1 gr G] of a Haitian-United States

rapprochement. Therefore, as we say, the departure of JOHN

HACEY (B val and company) is imperative.

We are expecting your immediate reply.

You have seem, My dear IRVING, that the recall of

WARREN, WARNER, HASSEY, MOSS and TIMMONS must be obtained.

JACQUES FOURCAND. "
