I. "A further development which i

may be of Interest

1s that In early January 1952 WYNIE-ELLIS recelved & further

Letter fros his fugslan pen friend giving him a fairl:

preasing invitation to vigit him (lE-ELLIS,, who was not

aware os AFLADLE'e defection, wrote to AELADLE telling him

that he had now receives the Invitation, and 1nvlting him

to coffee at his houge!

2. "We thought that the arrival of this letter (it

was dated 25.12.61) 80 shortly after AELADLE's defection,

long gap in the correspondence between (WYNNE-BLLIS)

and his pen friend, might indicato that the R.I.S.

auspected

that WyNNE-ELLIshad had a hand in AtladLe& defaction.

06 WYNNE-ELLIS) was nover aware that AlLADLE was an R.I.S. officer.

thia cas® /WYNNE-ELLIS)18 a most unsatlafactory charadtes

to doll with, and we bellove that the Rod.S. have round him

aqually unastlalaotory! no have no reason to suppose that

24 Che has doublo-crossed us since he was turned,) but wa would

not exclude this an a poasibility - or at least would not

exolude the poosibility that ho might have conaldored this.

*Our questiona on the WYNNE-ELLIs) document suppliad

by AELADLE ASO aS SOlLONS:

"What 1o the manusoript word at the top of the

§fret pago, and what 18 148 aignll.canoe?

b.

"The two typed words, one immediatoly below

the manusoript word on page 1 and

the othor to the lost, aro

not leg1bio on our copy.

"Is thoro any signifioance in the date 11th

November being in Inverted commas, thus

"12"p

"Wo are puzzled by what at sirat sight appeared

to be a date, 22.XII.1901, In the neading immediately above

the text on page l.

In fact the Roman numerals xin: are

the cyrillic letter XIT, but we do not understand their

moaning, Can ALLADLE explain this?

"What 18 the name In which the dooument 18

signed, and does AlLADLE know the true identity of this persons

I.d'We are a little surprised at the cyrilllo trans-

literation of WYNNE-ELLIS's name.

We should have expected tho

KOB to have a gystem which would enable them to get back to

the correct English spelling.

Admittedly WINNE-ELLIS)s name

18 an awkward one to deal with.

"We should have expected that dElndLe would havo

Bent a trace request to his Headquarters shortiy aiter the

f1r8t meeting with WYNNE-ELLIS 1n Jul5 1951.

Yet the reply

was apparently sent only on I1th November.

Can AFLADLE

comment on th18?

"we do not wish to suggest by these comments that

no suspect that this dooument might be a forgory, but we

would be gratelul for your confirmation thet you do not

consider this a possibillty.
