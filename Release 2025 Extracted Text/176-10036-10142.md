PLUS AIRBOR:VE, MARINE, AND ARMOR ELEMENTS READY TO PARTICIPATE IN

THE COUP. BRIGADIER GENERAL DO CAO TRI IS ALSO WORKING WITH THE

GROUP.

2, LANG MADE THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS ON THE STATUS OF THE COUP:

A. IŸ IS TO BE INITIATED BEFORE 5 OCTOBER, POSSIBLY ON 26

OR 28 SEPTEMBER. TROOPS WILL BE BROUGHT INTO SAIGON ON 26 SEPTEMBER

FOR THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ELECTION. MILITARY UNITS WILL REHEARSE

ON 28 SEPTEMBER FOR THE 26 OCTOBER NATIONAL DAY PARADE, AND THESE

TROOPS WILL REMAIN UNTIL 5 OCTOBER. GENERAL KHIEM WAS TRYING TO

ARRANGE THAT HE TROOPS BROUGHT TO SAIGON WOULD BE THOSE WHO WOULD

SUPPORT A COUF.

B. NO COUP HAS BEEN INITIATED AS YET BECAUSE EVERY EFFORT

IS BLING

TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT IT BE RELATIVELY BLOODLESS.

LONE ATTEMPT WAS CANCELLED AT THE POINT OF EXECUTION BECAUSE IT

WAS THOUGHT THAT FURTHER PREPARATION WOULD PREVENT BLOODSHED.

C. & MAJOR PROBLEM IS THE LACK OF SUITABLE EXPLOSIVES TO

BLAST A CONCRETE BUNKER WHERE PRESIDENT DIEM IS EXPECTED TO HIDE.

THE OLY OPENING TO THE BUNKER, OTHER THAIN A HEAVY DOOR, IS THE

VENTILATION SYSTEM AND THE COUP GROUP HESITATES TO USE FLAME

THROWERS OR POISON GAS BECAUSE THEY PREFER TO TAKE DIEM ALIVE.

D. THE REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE NOW INCLUDES LANG AND GENERALS

KHIEM, KHAN,

AND DUONG VAN MINH. GENERAL TRI HAS AGREED TO JOIN
