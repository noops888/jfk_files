MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE

SUBJECT:

Meeting of the President's Foreign Intelligence

Advisory Board, January 25-26, 1963

The Board convened In executive session at 10:15 a.m.

January 25,

1963,

on the first day of a two-day meeting in the

Board's öffices,

Room 297, Executive Office Building.

vere Board members Gray, Baker, Land, Clifford, Pace, Doolittle,

Murphy, and Langer; and

Messrs. Coyne and Ash.

Mr. Gray presided as acting Chairman In place of Dr. K1111an

whose arrival was delayed by bad flying weather.

Mr. Gray noted

that the DCI, Mr. McCone, had been called to testify before a

Congressional Committee and would therefore be unable to meet

with the Board at 11:30 as scheduled.

The acting Chairman then

called for a general discussion of the Board's pending review and

dräft report on

the Intelligence aspects of the circumstances

leading to the Cuba crisis.

Dr. Land expressed the view that although tidying up 1s an

obligation, and although looking back 1s a useful technique, the

Board's responsibilitles go beyond the conduct of post mortems

for the purpose of identifying past mistakes in the foreign Intel-

ligence fleld. Without detracting from the Importance of the

Board's after-the-fact review of the Cuba situation, Dr. Land

thought 1c equally important that the Board: become fully informed

on current developments as well.

Mr. Coyne called Dr. Land's attention to the fact that pre-

vIously, In Dr. Land's absence, the Board had submitted a December

28, 1962, report to the President which was Interim in nature, and

which contained recommendations looking ahead to the strengthening

of U.S. foreign Intelligence capabilities in matters not necessarily

confined to the Cuba situation. Taking note of this, Dr.

nevertheless thought that the Board should make sure that It knows

what 1s going on In Cuba today and what are the intelligence and

related actions which are being taken by the U.is. Intelligence

community with respect to the Soviet presence In Cuba.

Dr. Baker, referring to theBoard's December 28 Interim report

on Cuba,

that this is one of the most searching and far sighted

that the Board has produced, and he noted that the DCI's written

TOP SECRET

oold 2

- 2 -

response to this report was devestatingly empty and inadequate.

Dr. Baker saw no excuse for the fact that the DIA had been afforded

only two days notice to comment on the Board's report prior to the

submission of views by the DCI.X (Dr. Langer

thought It incredible

that the DCI had given DIA only two days to comment on the Board's

December 28 Interim report.) It was Dr. Baker's thöught that such

a procedure was contrary to the general agreement which had been

previously reached with Mr. Bundy. (in a discussion between Messrs.

Bundy, Baker and Coyne) that white House action memoranda flowing

from Board recommendations would go directly to the agencies pr1-*

marily concerned. with regard to the latter point, Mr. Coyne

observed that Mr. Bundy had in this instance acquiesced with the

DCI's request that the DCI obtain and report the coordinated views

of the varlous U.S. Intelligence agencies concerned with the

matters covered in the Board's report:

Dr. Langer pointed out to Dr. Land that at the Board's last

(which Dr. Land had been unable to attend) the Board had

been briefed on current aspects of the Cuba situation.

Dr. Land',

pursuing the point which he had raised, hoped that the Board would

be able to avoid the submission of a "boiler plate" report on the

errors made in the intelligence handling of the soviet bulld-up in

Dr. Land said he thought that the draft of the final Böard

report now before he Board was a good effor, but he hoped that

It would not draw from the agencies involved a book covering past

errors.

It was Dr. Land's view that in the intelligence system there

should be someone who knows

the whole story and can inform the Board

fully about 1t. Dr. Land's concern was that the intelligence ele-

ments involved may have been inept and that a year from now they

would be repeating the errors spotted in the Board's report, unless

the Board can get the agency heads, to accept the Board's help in

profiting. from lessons learned so that mistakes can be avoided in

the future.

Mr: Cliffora observed that there 1s a question of timing 1n-

volved in the Board's present Cuba review, because the Board was

under a special assignment from the President to prepare a report

Mr. Clifford thought that the Board would do a better service ir

It made a hard hitting report and recommendations, and then after

an appropriate interval the Board should ascertain whether the

recommendations were being put into effect and urge action on

those which the Board might find were not being Implemented.

Dr. Land

suggested that the Board should complete its work

on the present draft of its Cuba report and then take steps..

to get to

the heart of things with respect to intelligence plans and programs

regarding Cuba. He added that the Board's responsibilities go to

the effectiveness of the institution and framework within which

the U.S. Intelligence community operates,

the meeting of day-to-

day concerns which arise, and a determination as to whether re-

creation or reorganization is needed based on the "macsive approach"

represented by the draft report which the Board had before It.

Mr. Murphy expressed agreement with points made by Dr. Land.

It was Mr. Murphy's vlew that the intelligence community apparently

does not know enough about what is presently happening in Cuba, He

thought that photographic coverage was not enough and what was

needed was deep cover clandestine agent coverage of Cuba. Dr. Land

added that It was not enough for the Board to make recommendations

but there should also be a "violent surveliiance of their imple-

mentation.

Noting the agenda for the day, Mr. Murphy wondered what the

Charman had in mind as to the nature and purpose of the Board's

scheduled visit to the Secretary of State.

Mr. Gray recalled that

when Mr. Bundy had met with the Board previously he had suggested

that: In the course of the Board's Cuba review lt might well be use-

ful to discuss with the Secretary's of state and Defense, and the

Chairman of the JCS,

their views regarding the U.S. Intelligence

coverage given to the Soviet buildup In Cuba. Mr. Gray added that

1t was his impression that Mr. Bundy's suggestion had been basea

not only on the obtaining of facts pertinent to the Board's review

for Intelligence purposes, but also in anticipation of a Congressional

Investigation which might be made of the cuba experience.

Mr. Murphy thought It Important that the Board organize its

Interview to be had

with the Secretary of State. Mr. Gray suggested

that without going Into a re-hash of the chronological summary of

the Intelligence aspects, the Board's questions to Secretary Rusk

should Include those which would determine the Secretary's views on

what would have been done differently, from the vantage point of

hindsight, with respect to intelligence handling of the cuba devel-

opment; whether there was a proper weighing of the risks and the

incelligence advantages involved in overflights of Cuba, whether the

intelligence analysis and reporting processes were hindered by pre-

concelved views of U. s. "Sovietologists"

and whether raw intell1-

gence reports were adequately communicated to the white House Mr.

Gray recalling that Mr. Bundy had expressed to him the bellef that

the President should have been informed of the contents of some of

these reports regarding the sightings of offensive missiles in

prior to the photography of October 14):

MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE

SUBJECT: Cuba

In the course of the Board meeting of January 25, 1963,

the Board members and Mr.

Coyne met at the State

repartment

with the Secretary of State, Assistant Secretary Alexis Johnson

and Mr. Roger Hisman, Director of Intelligence and Research,

Department of State:

Utilizing the memorandum (copy attached) which contained a

series of questions which had heen drafted earlier In the day by

the Board, the Board members elicited Secretary Rusk!s views on:

a variety of Intelligence subjects pertaining to the pre-bulldup

and post-buildup period in Cuba

At the outset Secretary Rusk stated that the two Administra-

tions must share the responsibility for Cuba and

that cäch in turn

has taken full responsibillty for what was done or what was not

done during their

respective Administrations. He noted that Cuba

1s a national problem; that because of 1t

"we came up to the edge

of Incineration in the Western Hemisphere"'; and that he personally

has a deep anxiety over the question as to where we go from here.

He observed that in the case of a Communist take-over in Cuba or

anywhere else, It'Is easier to prevent the occurrence than it 1s

to correct 1t once 1t has taken place.

The Secretary was queried as to whether he agreed with the

Board's present finding that from October 14 onward there was an

effective performance by the Intelligence community In supplying

support in the policy decision process with respect tence comma

situation.

The secretary agreed stating the intelligence community

performance from October 14 onward was superb. He stated that this

performance enabled the panels of the NSC Executive Committee to

recommend the establishment of positions on which the Government

as a whole could and didyact.

Secretary Rusk was next queried as to whether he agreed with

the Board's present findings that, prior to October 14. the intell1-

gence performance was clearly deficient and that perhaps this de-

ficlency was not fully known to the Department of State at the time.

The Secretary observed that this was a complex question and aw

difficult one to answer.

• He felt it was terribly important that

as an outgrowth of the review of how the intelligence community

acquitted Itself, we not paralyze the community

as was done by

the Robert's Commission on Pearl Harbor day":

He observed that

from the point of view of high policy we have got to depend on

people who see a great Inflow of information and we must depend

on them to give us balanced judgments, particularly In such a

large area of operation as the Department of State wherê over

thousand cables are received and dispatched dally.

The Secretary stated that it was his impression that in mid

September 1962 the intelligence

community did not expect the soviet

Union to put MRBMs or IRBMs in Cuba; that this was the impression

at higher policy-advisory levels; and that because of this over-

all judgment 1t 1s possible that intelligence analysts were

diverted from the main point, namely, that offensive missiles:

were going In.

He thought this diversion might also have beent

based upon the September 19 estimate of the intelllgence community

and that that estimate might have had the effect uf the analysts

feeling that they should pursue

a hands off attitude"

anything that came up which concerned the UssR's introduction of

offensive missiles..

He sald the lesson to be learned from this is

that some means must be found to assure that we do not take any-

thing for granted in these areas. Also a means must be found for

stimulating the expression of reservation at pollcy levels, noting

that 1t 1s not easy to make these reservations operaticnal

The Secretary staled that 1f one looks: at the problem'of

intelligence

in terns of the time factors Involved he thought

one would find that even before October l4 our intelligence was

"pretty good"

He observed that except for two of the long-rangen

sites, overflighis ten days earlier than October 14 would, have

seen nothing.

Mr. Murphy noted that the last observation of the Secretary

seemed to suggest exclusive dependence on photographs.

To this

the Secretary observed that in 1ts interim report the Board had

called attention to the need for re-enforcing classical intell1-

gence means,

The Secretary said that he agreed with the Boardys

point and that he considered ite tremely important. He said the

Department 1s prepared to provide rover to the CIA, but that

other means must be developed as soon as possible; otherwise 1f

there 1s undue dépendenceon diplomatic cover embarrasments -would

become greatly increased. He noted that already the United States

Government has had "

many problem cases! Involving CIA cover. He

noted also that a good rule is now being followed In this area,

a rule which precludes a CIA agent to target in his country of

assignment une Secretary emphasized the view that our government

has "under-played old fashioned espionage".

He observed that it

1s easy to fly U-2s but that such flights inevitably bring up

international problems since they violate sovereignty; and there-

fore the Department of State welcomes the idea of beefing up

traditional esplonage activities which are not dependent upon

diplomatic cover.

The Board next inquired as to whether the Secretary belleved

that the interests and requirements of the intelligence community

were aggressively spoken for at the policy level during the pre-

October 14 period.

He responded that the United States would have

been better off with more intensive air (U-2 plane) coverage during

the period beginning October l, but at that time reports were

sketchy,

there was the problem of the stand-down of the U-? because

of the Chinat loss, weather conditions were not optimum, etc. Re-

verting to the principal question asked of him the Secretary expressed

the view that the Special NSC 5412/2 Group operated adequately and 1s

now operating adequately.

He said that he is in touch with the Group

from time to time on its plans and he noted that on the matter of in-

telligence collei ion flights we have run 2500 peripheral flights

around the Soviet Union and every one of them is to some degree

dangerous.

He said that the President and he personally examine

the particularly sensitive flights that are proposed.

that in the State Department Intelligence requirements of the

community are accepted in this area and that the Department goes

along with the overwhelming number of flights proposed.

He said

that in the case of Cuban overflights he personally made two sug-

gestions during the period in question.

The first involved the step-

up of peripheral flights around Cuba as a cover for putting flights

over the island when we wanted to and he said that he had told the

OAS representatives about this noty that the "rioks of strays"

of such peripheral flights was

His second suggestion

Involved breaking up one or two proposed flights into segments of

four flights (the Board members were fully cognizant of this.

Mr. Gray made reference to the delays which necessarily resulted

from breaking the proposed mission into a four-segmented one. He

inquired of the Secretary as to whether he had been advised of the

fact that delays would necessarily result from his suggested amend-

ment of the mission.

The Secretary replied in the negative.

At this point Dr. Land observed that there is not enough

personified

pressure from intelligence; that a concentrated

statement of intelligence requirements and purposes should be

constantly served up to the policy level from suspicious intelli-

gence personalities and that these, of course, should be subject

to ultimate decision by the Secretary of State and others of high

authority.

The Secretary took issue with a portion of Dr. Land's

statement on the grounds that it assumed that there is no one in

the intelligence community who has any polloy responsibility.

The Secretary sald that he thought this was incorrect because

the Director of Central Intelligence frequently acted as one

having volicy responsibilities.

The Secretary observed that while the intelligence needs are

great there are other requirements which the United States must

take into account and that these must all be balanced out. Her

emphasized again at this point that overflying another country

in peacetime is a difficult thing.

The Secretary

then reverted to the question of traditional

espionäge and expressed the view that "we have gotten a little s

lazy on espionage".

He noted that during World War II excellent

espionage results were obtained by virtue of a "most fabulous:

combination of blue bloods and thugs"

"The Secretary favored

resumption now of this world War II practice.

At this point Dr.

Killlan Inquired of the Secretary as to

whether he was satisfied that Mr. McCone's report on Cuba dated:

December 26th reflects a fair statement of the state Departments

The Secretary said he had been unable to examine theo

report fully; that he had complete confidence in the relationships

which his Department has with Mr. McCone, but that he would take

exception to

"the juxta-position of things on the four-flight

Mr. Hilsman Joined the Secretary In this view.

Secretary urged that the Board members be as analytical as pos-

sible in examining the Cuba situation. He encouraged them to

remember the

"atmosphere of the times

He hoped the Board would

las precise as possiblel in examining the overflight matter

stating that

"iffyou think the U-2 1s not serious, you are on the

wrong track"

Gray indicated that it was the Board's understanding that

the President approved all overflights recommended, and he then

suggested that apparently there were some flights that were not

rejected, but neither were they made.

To this the Secretary

stated that what ought to be looked at were the flights that

were laid on from September 20 to October 5 or 6.

He noted that

during this perlod, following the September 19 estimate of the

Intelligence. community on Cuba, there was some deay. in distrib-

uting reports from refugee and agent sources on the sightings fof

long-range missiles in Cuba.

He again noted that just prior to:

this period there was a loss of a Chinat overated u-2 over the

On the latter point Dr. Langer

Inquired whether the Secretary felt that flights over Cuba were

in the same category as flights over the Soviet Union or over

The Secretary responded in the negative noting: that "we

felt much greater freedom of action in the case of Cubal Mr.

Hillsman added on this point that the USIB felt that two U-a

flights a month over cuba were adequate.

The Secretary recalled that early in October he was requested

to authorize overflights based on indications of two specific sites

and he sald he immediately approved.

Mr. Gray observed that there appeared to be some confusion as

to whether we had a pollcy of not overflying SA-2 sites, and

Secretary Johnson responded that the matter of overflying SA-?!s

Invariably came up in the Special Group but that he could not recall

prohibition on overflying such sites:

Secretary Johnson added

that in the Spoclal Group he could not recall any kind of operation

ever being recommended where the atmosphere was as relaxed as it

was In the case of recommendations pertaining to the cuba problem.

Mr. Hisman stated that at the operational level there was

concern about losing a pilot over cuba.

Consequently a CORONA

Mission was programmed for Cuba from September 21 to September 24

The Secretary was asked whether he was satisfied with the

national estimating process and whether he considered that State

Department participation therein was provided for adequately

The Secretary thought that State Department participation in the

preparation of national Intelligence estimates was adequately

provided for. He said that from the point of view of the polloy

officer it is essential that he know what the intelligence people

Intentions with respect to Cuba,

The Secretary responded that

he did not belleve that the "Sovletologists" did what has been

claimed. He did not belleve that they had much influence on

estimates:: He thought,

however, he detected an insufficient

alertness on their part to the possibility that the estimates.

ofthe intelligence community were wrong. He expressed the

on this point that the direct indicators came in

after the September

19 estimate was prepared.

The Secretary was next queried as to whether we are currently

informed in an adequate manner about Soviet objectives and activ

1ties in Cuba today. The Secretary responded that the principal

gap 1s our inability to prove the negative because of the absence

of on-site inspections.

He said we are running overflights regu

larly; that we have improved our cooperation with allied govern-s

In Cuba; but that we do not know for certain what the Soviet

objectives are Insofar as Cuba is concerned.

When queried as to U.S. Government knowledge as to the

purpose of Mikoyan's stay in Cuba and as to what Mikoyan accom=

plished, the Secretary stated that he thought we know a great

deal about the Mikoyan mission. He noted that for ten days:

Castro would not talk to Mikoyan.

He said that we are getting

mụch better Information regarding Castro and particularly Castro's

efforts in inspiring other Latin American countries. The Secre-

the thought that the soviet Union may be deciding

that Cuba is not the proper base from which to launch their Latin

American operations. He said rewarding gains have been made ing

attempting to obstruct travel between Cuba and the Free World.

He conceded, however, that we do not have the Cuba-Russian plan

adding that we have not penetrated the Cuban regime

hopes we might be able to later.

The Secretary was asked with reference to the Monroe Doctrine,

whether the Department of State has urged an aggressive intelligence

collection effort to define any new violation of the Doctrine. The

Secretary thought it would not be too profitable to concentrate on

this pointend it would be more profitable to concentrate on the

Rio Pact.

He agreed, however, that the Doctrine 1s violated by

the presence of the Marxist-Leninist system in the Western Hemis-

phere for he said there is no question whatever about the Soviet

presence in Cuba:

In conclusion the Secretary stated that he thought "our

intelligence on Cuba today is not complete but it 1s not deficient.

N1'. Pace Inquired as to why Guantanamo had not been used

more extensively as a base for the acquisition of intelligence.

-General Taylor responded that "we may have viewed it as a Sacred

CON.

He had a feeling that the Navy might consider enlarged

intelligence activitles at Guantanamo as prejudicing the u.s.

Naval base there.

Mr. Pace Inquired as to whether the intelligence community

had been sufficlently agressive in placing 1ts requirements on

the Special Group and on the Mongoose Committee. General Taylor

responded to the effect that he knew of no intelligence requests

emanating from the community that were not supported fror higher

levels.

In an aside General Taylor mentioned that when the

missiles were discovered in Cuba

Vi was a hawk"

meaning that

he favored the launching of the U.s. military

strike agalns.tsn

the missile bases in Cuba,, General Doolittle asked whether at

the present time General Taylor feels he is getting sufficient

Intelligence on Cuba. General Taylor responded "obviously not"

adding that "photographir Intelligence is practically all we are

getting today.

General Taylor stated that

"Most of us are

well aware of the trailty of our intelligence system - we can

beat the DoI over the head but he just can't produce the:

Intelligence we need.

Dr. Killian elicited General Taylor's recommendations on

the Special NSC 5412/2 Group asking whether the General had anv

constructive suggestions to make in light of his having chalred

the special Group prior to his appointment as Chalimon of the

Joint Chiefs of Stafr. General Taylor had no specific suggestions

He noted that as Chairman of the Special Group he d

what the intelligence community was doing both in the intelligence

and covert action field. He said that this activity on the part

of the Board gave him a good feeling a feeling of insurance a

in his capacity as Chairman of the Special Group. General Taylor.

added that "If your Board didn't exist we would häve to invent you.

Mr. Clifford stated that he had the Impression that relations

between defense and CIA were not too close and General Taylor

expressed the hope that that was not in fact the case. General.

Taylor recognized, however, that there was a feeling of consider-

able rivalry between CTA and Defense, particularly SAC, when

responsibility for U-2 reconnaissance over Cuba was transferred

General Taylor sald he favored the transfer of

the flights,that CIA was really Cassandra-like on this issue and

that is where the animosity arose.

General Taylor volunteered the view that the creation

of the DIA will Improve rather than

between Defense and CIA although he acknowledged that there

w117 always be some rivalry between civilian intelligence

collectors in CIA and military Intelligence collectors in

DIA and the services.

To this Mr. Pace observed that some

rivalry is good and healthy.

Finally, when queried about the posture of service attaches

General Taylor noted that he had recently returned from a lengthy

trip in the course of which he visited with a number of the:

attaches and he had found that they had "improved enormously"

of resistance groups, should be deferred pending

a broader review of the entire situation.

General Taylor

specifled, however, that if an ungent need arose for air supply

at any time,

achieved.

In anever to a question frum the ittorney General,

Lansdale said that intelligence Indicated that although

there was widespread dissatisfaction with Castro, there vas

The Attorney General and Mr. Johnson emphasized the need

for an effort to obtain

by the Castro regime in

the Hemisphere,

Mr. McCone noting

that such efforts to date had

been fruitless.

Dr. Cline showed the Group the extent of reconnaissance

coverage of cuba.

Mir. Mccone emnhasized that his program has

developed complete information on deployments and facilities

for the army, Navy, and Alr Force, and he particularly noted

that these missions have verified

that there is sufficiens

logistic support for a

"No missile

sites have been found.

The Group agreed on a complete review of MONGOOSE toward

end of July, with participation by the secretaries of State

General Taylor enphasized that in the preparation

for such revier, there mould be a need for summaries of results

to date, of Intelligence developed, and of future

alternatives opened to the United States

including possible

activities in other parts of Latin Americal.

Johnson said that the State Department 1s Inves 1gating

not renuired in view of the meager results obtained, especlally

1n. the

"massive activity" within

the entire MONGOOSE

framework.

General Lanadale thought that another attempt should be

made against the major target which had been the subject of

three unsuccessful missions and he sald that six new missions

were in the planning stage.

Mr. Johnson sald that the "massive activity" would have

to come from within, and he hoped to be able tu present soon

to the Grono a plan for giving Cuban exiles more of a free hand,

fully reallzing that this will give additional

VIsIbll1.ty. to

thelr activities.

Mr. McCone reserved Judgment on the feasi

bility and

desirability of such a program; and Mr. Johnson

agreed that he nad reservations

as well.

Mr. McCone said that he had received the Impression

that although. h1gh levels of our Government wanted. increased

activity, they still want to keep it at i low nolse level,

but Mli'.

Mecone did not belleve this would be possible and

felt that any sabotage would be blamed on the United States.

Mi. Mecone cited the enornous number of telephone calls

directed at CIA at the time the skin divers landed in east

and the time that the cuban exile students. shot up the

apartment house..

McCone therefore urged that responsible

orsicals be prepared to accent a higher noise love: if they

want to get on with operations.:

The Attorney General,

n partial rebuttal, said that the

reasons people had such concern were. (a) the fact that the skin

c..vers were Anericans, and (b) the fact ühat the stucent activity

was Irresponsible and

fool1sh-- and if either of these had

In fact been engineered by the United States it would, have

been a sreat mistake.

The Attorney General also related

possibility of attributabllity to the importance of the

particular undertaling, and he questioned whether we are going

right road

whether more

were not

Indicated.

He urged that alternative and imaginative plans

be developed.

that internal uprisings would surely be brutally suppressed.

Mr. McCone and General Carter explained the tremendous

efforts necessary. to insure that operations such as the sabotage

operation previously authorized cannot be pinned directly on

Mr. Gilpatric Informed the Group that the Defense Depart-

ment

was hard at work on establishing a Cuban brigade. Recrults:

D. Scoville and Colonel Steakley were present at this

It was pointed out that the CIA 1s

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Reconnaissance of Cuba

Following is a chronological resume of considerations by

the Speclal Group (5412) and the Special Group (Augmented) of U-2

reconnaissance activitles over cuba.

This summary begins as of

1 May 1961 (1.e., after the Bay of Pigs).

It was agreed that pollcy approval for U-2

flights over Cuba is still in effect.

February 1962. The Cuba missions were stepped up from

one per month to two.

14 June 1962.

A COMOR recommendation: that two additional

flights be

authorized for June was approved by the Group.

12 July 1962.

(Augmented Group.)

Mr. McCone emphasized

that reconnaissance of Cuba has developed complete information on

deployment and facilities for the Army, Navy and Air Force, -and

that 1t has verifled the fact that there is sufficient logistics

support for a 75,000 man military force. No missile sites have

been found.

12 July 1902.

The Group agreed to continue with the

presentiy authorized schedule of two flights per month.

19 July 1962.

Cuba was considered as part of a set of

proposals covering reconnaissance world-wide.

The two flights per

month pattern was reiterated. (This was later approved by higher

author1ty.)

the Immediate situation with respect to soviet materiel justifies 1v.

It was noted that this would use up existing authorizations for

month, it should be considered on its merits at triat time.

NOTE: Coordinated with Reber,

30 August 1962.

In connection with the

Agency's monthly

forecast, General Carter mentioned that there might be an additional

requirement for flights over Cuba.

10 September 1962.

At a special meeting attended by thes

Secretary of State,

the Attorney General, the Acting DOI and others,

the Secretary expressed concern over the Agency's planned coverage

of Cuba. He objected particularly to the proposal to combine ex-

tensive overflying of international waters with actual overflights.

As a result of this discussion, 1t was agreed that the Agency's pro-

posed coverage would have to be broken into four parts - one over the

Isle of Pines, one over the eastern end of Cuba, and two legs along

the coast - one north and one south. Within this franework higher

authority later gave approval for three flights in addition to those

already authorized, with priority to the overflights. (NOTE: The e

gency Later securea agreement to continue the Isle of Pines leg over

che Bay of Pigs area, after considerable negotiation with State

capabilities for low-level coverage of certain targets in Cuba.

was noted that the Secretary of Defense did not wish this operation

considered further until the results of Agency reconnaissance. in the:

same area became available. General Carter said that special efforts

will be required to identify certain installations, the nature of

which is not clear at present.

27 September 1962. An additional mission for cuba was

approved.

4 October 1962 (Augmented Group•

The DOI pointed out

that the Agency is now restricted to using the U? in the south-

eastern quadrant of Cuba, because of the SAM sites, It was questioned

whether this was a reasonable restriction at this time, particularly

since the SAMs were almost certainly not operational.

9 October 1962 (Augmentea: Group:

The Group discussed the

spectrun of possible reconnaissance activities.

It was agreed that

fIrst priority should be glen to one U-? in the western part of the

Island, Depending on the results of this, a number of similar sorties

might be mounted. (Higher authority later approved the one mission,.

leaving the second proposition open.

15 October 1962.

At a special meeting,

two U-2 missions,

designed to cover all of Cuba, were approved.

These were concurred

In by higher authority.

After the 15th of october, additional coverage

agreed

on at other meetings.

purpose.

motives behind the recent Soviet economic and military shipments

This analysis stated In part: "In addition to training and

arming Castro's forces, the Soviets may be establishing some kind of

overt military presence with Soviet-manned installations in Cuba.

But we belleve at present such activities are likely to be limited

to the setting up of unacknowledged Intelligence collection and de-

believe that the soviets would rule out.

For the foreseeable future.

In sum, we think there 1s some possibillty

that intelligence and defensive Installations may be set up at least

temporarily undei purely Soviet control, while offensive installations

would not be likely, certainly for a considerable tline.

The State

Department analysis stated at this point "It should be noted in this

connection that presently available Information makes 1t extremely

difficult to assess Soviet Intentions In this field and that a harder

estimate must await more clear cut

evidence."

Union to bolster the milltary power of the Castro regime in Cuba.

These restrictions did not apply to the Checklist, but the Checklist

writers drew. largely on the Cuban Daily Summary

Since the Surmary was affected by the restrictions, this practice, imposed by the

sheer volume of raw material coming in on Cuba, had the effect of cutting the

Checklist off from Information on offensive weapons.

Checklist group, nor any otber current Intelligence officers, knew that the

possibility that a Sovlet strategic missile base might be established in Cuba

had been raised by the DCI and seriously discussed by the President and his

advisors more than a month earlier (see Item No. 57, above). In other words,

the thrust of NSAM 181 had been so watered down by time and bureaucratic processes

that it reached the working level only in the form of SNIE 85-3 which held that

establishment of such a base was most improbable (see Item No. 117, above).

"It is difficult to say whether information from ground sources would have

9/29-10/2/62 - Pursuant to the 9/20/62 request of DIA, a

pass over Cuba was made by the Corona vehicle launched on 9/29/62.

The resulting photography was good by Corona standards but not of

sufficient quality to reflect significant photographic intelligence

on MRBM Or IRM developments un the island.

When this CORONA photog-

raphy was checked against the photography obtained from the SAC-

operated U-2s it was possible to relate some of the earth scratchings

appearing In the CORONA photography to the construction at some of

the long range missile sites which were detected beginning October 14.

Without the U-? photography however, these scratchings could not

possibly be identified as being assoclated in any way with MRBM or

IRAM construction.

The photograplic interpreters at the strategic

Air Command believe that 1f all nine sites had been completed at the

time of the CORONA pass, the CORONA photogr. ohy might have resulted

1n the identification of the IRBM sites but not of the MRBM sites.

Dr. Charyk, In commenting on this subject to Board Member Gray,

noted that this experience makes It obvious that satellite photography

cannot be wholly relied upon when 1t provides negative evidence; and

The DIA

"Intelligence justification" pointed to the bulldup of

which was to be supported by FLINT collection aircraft off the coast, also was

designed to pans over one of the 8A-2 sites which was thought to be most

nearly operational. Thas the secondary objective was to determine the status

of SA-2 defenses in order to measure the risk involved in getting ccuplete

U-2 coverage of Cuba as rapidly as possible. NRO's second recommendation was

therefore conditional: If there 1s no SA-2 reaction to the initial U-2 sortie,

mission was limediately mounted. It was delayed by weather, however, froin 10

11/5/62 - Dr. Charyk, Under Secretary of the Air Force

expressed to

Board Member Gordon Gray the opinion that the following

lessons were learned from the cuba situation:

(1) There is a need for a group at the policy level, having

access to all pertinent intelligence, which can perform the task o

rapidly identifying intelligence requirements and objectives. Dr.

Charyk belleved that in this Instance USIB did not perform the function

he had in mind.)

(2) There 1s need for a focal point to ensure the availability

of Intelligence-related resources for use in contingency sicuations

(e.g., f:lm for photographic recontaissance purposes).

(3) Comparisons of CORONA and U-? photography of Cuba reveal

significant Instances where u-2 photography was rositive, whereas

CORONA photography of the same targets had been interpreted as nega-

tive. Dr.

Charyk felt that based on this experienca 1t 1s obvious

that satellite photography cannot be wholly relled upon when 1t

provides negative evidence.

He observed that this gives one pause

when we consider the reliance which has been placed on satellite

photography for evidence of missile Installations In the USSR. (Dr.

Charyk added

that recent satellite photography shows a new missile

site at Tyura Tam which 1s not served by rail facilities heretofore

as an Identifying character1st1c of this type of in1ss1le 1n-

stallation - suggesting the possibility that our readings of sat-

ellite photography have failed to locate other missile sites because

of the absence of rail or other characteristics we have assumed for

them.)

report of Fernando Garcia Chacon;

that Soviet missiles have

been placed in seven caves and other underground installations in

ported that the underground sites are strongly guarded by Russians

and that no Cubans have been allowed to approach them since the sites

Garcia's student group Issued a statement in Mlami

claiming that "The free world is on the verge of being a victim of

a new swindle of the soviet Union.

We have in our hands sufficient

Information that there exist on Cuban territory bases of missiles

greater range in subterranean

graphed by reconnaissance aircraft

"The photo planes have localized on Cuban territory nearly 30

launching pads while our information assures us that there are many

more missiles in Cuba.

The Soviet Union can take out of Cuba and

permit the inspection of more than 50 missiles, but there are on

Cuban territory sufficient missiles to destroy half the continent.
