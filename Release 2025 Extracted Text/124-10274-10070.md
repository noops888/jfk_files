Dear Mike:

This will confirm our telephone conversation con-

cerning the procedure whereby we will make available to

you, or your designee, copies of draft reports relating

to the Justice Department.

As we discussed, the pur-

pose is so that any classification (or other

such

problems, e.g., the identity of informers) which may be

inadvertently raised in our reports can be identified.

The first two drafts relating to the FBI are ready.

They are:

1. "The Use of Informers in FBI Domestic

Investigations"; and

2. "Domestic CIA and FBI Mail Opening Programs"

(Substantial portions of which relate to the

FBI.)

I would appreciate it if someone very promptly could con-

tact Frederick D. Baron, my assistant (224-1746), who

will arrange the details of location and time for the

review.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Bill:

Senstudy

L053 a to ra labe

Thank you very much for the two tetters you sent a 142

to Jim Adams about the remarks made by Senator Morgan.

I have seen him brietly since he mace these remarkg and

plaz to see him next week again to talls over the reason for

these remarks at some length. As noted in his response to

you, apparently he has come to this feeling as a result oi the

so-called "'unchallenged" matters which be has had reported

to him as a member of the Senate Select Committee. It is

true that some mistakes of the Bureau were brought out, but

the over-all performance of the Bureau has, as you said, been

well above that which could even be expected of us and cer-

tainly has been most contributory to the saiety of this nation

throughout the years.

I'o categorize us as "rotten to the corg''

and to indicate that we are a great threat to the United States

miss the mark tremendously and are compietely without foun-

datlon." I will so inform him, but apparently he has made up

his mind and there is little likellhood that we will have a

convert.

PURPOSE:

Executive

Session was held on 2/13/76, where the role of the FBI in past

"domestic intelligence investigations" as well as the role that

the fBI should play in intelligence type investigations of

domestic subversive organizations in the future was discussed.

SSC requested copy of instructions sent to field by rBIH®

regarding Privacy Act matters which has a bearing on

investigations of domestic groups.

DETAILS:

Reference is

made to Cregar to Nr. Wannall memorandur

dated 2/9/16, concerning SSC Executive Session held on 2/6/75,

at which time it was decided that an additional Ixecutive Séssion

would be held at

a future date, regarding "domestic intelligence

investigations."

An SSC Executive Session was held from approximately

10:55 a.m., until 12:45 p.m., 2/13/76. Representing the SSC

were Chief Counsel Frederick A. 0. Schwartz,

Jr., who acted as

Chairman, John Illiff, Mark Gitenstein and Michael Epstein. No

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re:

Senstudy 75

62-116395

and the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) had been involved in

planning or organizing numerous large demonstrations in the

country and he desired to continue this discussion. A list of

major demonstrations with resulting damages and arrests which

occurred in the U.S. during the past ten years involving

subversive groups was furnished by Mr. Shackelford. A

discussion followed

regarding the role of the FBI in gathering

intelligence information concerning the demonstrations as well

as the dissemination of the information which had been obtained.

Mr. Schwartz questioned the authority of the FBI in investigating

infiltrated groups such as the National Peace Action Coalition

(NPAC) and the Peoples Coalition for Peace and Justice (PCPJ)

even though both groups were either dominated or influenced'

by the CPUSA or the SVP.

A discussion then followed as to what effect the

enactment of the Privacy Act has on the investigation by the

FBI of domestic subversive groups. A request was made

concerning instructions which have been sent to the field by

IBIHO concerning this matter.

The Session then turned to investigation of extremist

groups and the use of informants in these groups to obtain

place informants into these extremist groups without the

ingredient of violence present.

This Executive Session was adjourned at approximately

12:45 p.m. and no request was made at that time for another

Executive

Session.

OBSERVATIONS:

From statements made by Mr. Schwartz and other SSC

Stalt members present, with the possible exception of Mr. Mark

Gitenstein, it appeared that these individuals continue to be

opposed to legislation authorizing Bureau investigations in the

domestic intelligence area unless the threat of violence is

imminent. Mr. Gitenstein in his discussion concerning the use

of informants in extremist groups appeared to want to

include in the record acts of violence which have been

prevented because of infiltration by informants in these

groups.

It does appear, therefore, that he may be more

favorably inclined towards the Bureau's position in these

matters.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the SSC Unit, Intelligence Division, communicate

with a member of the SSC stait regarding Privacy Act material

and/or instructions desired by the Committee.

This is to call to your attention a most serious

breach of the confidentiality that must be afforded the

material and information that this Bureau has furnished to

Enclosed

for your approval and delivery, preferably to SSC Chairman

Senator Frank Church personally, is a memorandum which sets

forth this incident in detail for the SSC, states the

seriousness with which this matter is viewed and which

requests the sse to advise whether they did, in fact,

publicly disclose the identity of former FBI informant

George F. Dorsett as alleged and if so, the basis for such

disclosure.

IN

OF

AND

COPY

George F. Dorsett was an FBI informant fron

January, 1959, to October, 1970. He was discontinued as an

informant when his activity in the Klan ceased, at which time

his relationship with the Bureau continued to be excellent.

He

has not been disclosed publicly as an FBI informant. Dorsett did

in fact separate from the United Klans of America (UKA) and

form the Confederate Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (CKKKK) • He

formed the CKKKK on his own initiative; however, we utilized

this opposing Klan organization through Dorsett as a means

of disrupting and causing confusiOR dissension ithin the

The handling agent assisted Dorsett in

preparing a letter announcing his resignation fron the UKA

and his formation of the CKKKK.

This letter invited Dorsett's

friends in the Klan to join him in the CKKKK. A total of

41 chapters of the CKKKK were chartered; however, all of them

did not become effective operating chapters.

The documents delivered to the SSC were excised to

delete Dorsett's name as an informant. Charlotte airtel dated

sugust 22, 1967, and C. D. Brennan memorandum to W. C. Sullivan

dated August 24, 1967, set forth the recommendation and

approval for the mailing of a letter from Dorsett to all Klan

units in North Carolina announcing his resignation fron the UKA

and the formation of the CKKKK. Dorsett's name is deleted from

these documents; however, it is clear that the informant was

preparing the letter. Charlotte altel to the Director

September 13, 1967, refers to the August 22, 1967, Charlotte

airtel and states that the referenced airtel recommended Bureau

approval for a letter to be mailed over the signature of

Reverend George F. Dorsett under the above conditions. Dorsett's

name is not deleted fron this document. From the above

documents Dorsett's identity can readily be established as the

FBI informant.

In the December 6, 1975, issue of the "Charlotte

Observer'' a daily Charlotte, North Carolina, morning

newspaper there is a front page article captioned "FBI Started

41 North Carolina Klan Units, Morgan Says." In this article,

North Carolina Senator Robert Morgan, member of the SSC, said

the FBI organized 41 KKK units in North Carolina during the 1960's

as part of its campaign against the white supremacist group.

liorgan was also quoted as saying, "The vast majority of

people in the Klan in North Carolina were law-abiding eitizens.

about that now." Morgan is further quoted as saying, "There

Is nothing basically wrong with having an informer in any

organization but when these informers do more than just listen,

when they instigate trouble, that's wrong." Morgan also said

the FBI financed the operations of the Federally organized

Klaverns.

As set forth in the enclosed memorandum, Mr. Dorsett

was intervlewed on December 12, 1975, by Charlotte, North

Carolina, FBI Agents at which time he expressed his concern

for his personal safety and for his family as well, as well as

concern for the safety of his personal property.

As stated above this matter is considered to be a

most serious breach of the confidentiality that must be afforded

the material and information that this Bureau has furnished to

the U, S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. It is

respectfully requested that the enclosed memorandum be

delivered to Senator Frank Church, Chairman of the SSC,

personally. Please advise what action is taken concerning

this matter.

Ine December 10, 1975, issue of the "Greensboro Daily

article captioned "Greensboro Man Named As FBI Klan Informant,"

by Jack Betts, Daily News Washington bureau.

The article

states in part:

"Washington - A Greensboro man long active in the

Ku klux Klan has been identified as an informant for the

Federal Bureau of Investigation's campaign to disrupt the

KKK in North Carolina during the latter 1960's.

"A Senate Intelligence Committee source said Tuesday

that George F. Dorsett, former Imperial Kludd (National Chaplain)

of the United Klans of America, was a paid FBI informant who,

with the FBI's assistance, broke away from the Klan in 1967 to

form a rival group.

"FBI documents obtained by. the comnittee indicate

that Dorsett, who was disenchanted with KKK Grand Dragon

J. Robert Jones of Granite Quarry and with Imperial Wizard

Robert Shelton of Tuscaloosa, Ala., was encouraged by the FBI

to leave the Klan in the summer of 1967 and form the

Confederate Knights ofthe Ku Klux Klan. The FBI helped

Dorsett draft letters recruiting for the new group, according

to the committee source.

"According to the documents, the FBI's plan was to

harass the KKK and to dilute the influence of the United Klans

and to keep closer tabs on the new group.

"Sen. Robert Morgan, D. N.C., a member of the

committee said last week that charters

for some 41 new Klaverns

or chapters of the Confederate Klan were issued, but that not

all charters resulted in active new Klan groups."

A review of meterial delivered to the staff of the

Committee has determined that Committee Staff Member Barbara

Banoff accepted on August 28, 1975, copies of 212 serials

releting to White Hate matters under the COINTELFRO requests

of the Committee.

The following documents were included

among these 212 serials:

A careful reading and comperison of these documents

would lead to the identity of Dorsett as an FBI informent in

the manner described in the above article. The factual materiel

set forth in the article is contained in the above documents.

It is noted that the documents as delivered to the Committee

do not identify Mr. Dorsett as an FBI informent; however, his

identity can be deduced from the combined documents. Our

records do not indicate that Mr. Dorsett's identity as an

informant has been disclosed in eny other menner. Mi. Dorsett

was interviewed by FBI Agents of the Charlotte, North Caroline,

FBI Office on December 12, 1975. Mr. Dorsett

stated that

he felt "betrayed" by his

government concerning the public

disclosure in the news media of his identity as en FBI source.

He recalled that he had always been assured that his identity

would always remein confidentirl and known only to the FBI.

He further stated

thet as a result of the public disclosure of

his identity as an FBI source in the "Greensboro Daily News"'

on December 10, 1975, he has experienced great consternation

among his close frlends and members of his family. He has

received harassing telephone calls. During one of these calls

the caller stated, "Tell that pimp to get his casket ready."

Mr. Dorsett expressed his concern for the personal safety

of himself and members of his family, as well as concern for

the safety of his residence and personal property.

RE: U.S. SINATE SELECT COMMITTEE TO STUDY

GOVERIMENTAL OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT

TO INTELLICENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

The disclosure of the identity of FBI informants

places these informants' lives in serious jeopardy as well

as subjecting them and their families to the likelihood of

embarrassment and harassment within their communities.

Such disclosures have a most serious and detrimental effect

on other informants, who have just cause to question the

security of their past or present association with the FBI.

Fersons who might otherwise be inclined to furnish information

to the IBI, expecting their cooperation to be kept in

confidence, are reluctant to do so when they see such

violations

of the sanctity of FBI files and information.

The TBI has endeavored to cooperate fully and

candidly in making available to the Committee the documents

and information requested by the Cormittee. We have

insisted that the confidentiality of informants be

maintained. In view of this most serious breach of the

confidentiality of infornation furnished by the FBI to the

Cormittee and in an effort to determine the nature of it,

you are requested to advisé whether the U. S. Senate Sclect

Gormittee on Intelligence or any member or staff member thereof,

is responsible for the public disclosure of former FBI

informent George F. Dorsett as alleged and if so, the basis for

such disclosure.

Director Sec'y —

At 2:45 p.m. on 1/27/76, Michael Epstein, Staff Member

of captioned Committee, requested

that Harold N. Bassett, Assistant

Director of the Inspection Division, or some other Bureau official

familiar with inspection procedures be made available for a briefing

with that Committee on 1/28/76 and to appear in executive session at

10 a.m. on 1/29/76.

The topic of the briefing and testimony will be

the Bureau's inspection procedures.

Epstein contacted SA Paul. V. Daly of this Division on

1/28/76 and indicated he would desire that the briefing take place

in the Committee's space at 1:30 p.m. on this date. He stated it

would not be necessary for Assistant Director Bassett to be familiar

with any particular matters reviewed by the Inspection Division but

rather address, in

general, the inspection policies and procedures.

Epstein stated

the executive session which was to begin at 10 a.m.

on 1/29/76 would consist of Assistant Director Bassett and former

Acting Associate Director W. Mark Felt appearing in a panel ar-

rangement.

Assistant Director Bassett would be asked questions'

at the executive session concerning inspection procedures.

Scheduled to follow Assistant Director Bassett as

witnesses before the Committee in that same executive session at

i1 a'.m. are Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., in his role as Counsel on

Professional Responsibility and Glen E. Pommerening, Assistant

Attorney General for Administration.

On 1/28/76, Epstein advised SA Daly that Assistant

Director Bassett's appearance in executive session before that

Committee was being rescheduled for 2 p.m. on 1/29/76 because of

a schedule conflict.

He subsequently advised that the Staff

briefing had to be postponed because Epstein determined he had a

prior commitment. Epstein, in the late afternoon of 1/28/76,

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams

RE: SENSTUDY 75

advised that he had to again postpone the executive session

testimony of Assistant Director Bassett because of scheduling

conflicts and that the testimony would be sometime during the

week of 2/2/76. He could not

give a definite time nor assure

that the testimony would take

place during that week.

On the morning of 1/29/76, Epstein requested that

Assistant Director Bassett appear in executive session at 2 p.m.

on 2/3/76 to give his requested testimony.

with Assistant Director Bassett, Epstein

sistant Director Bassett had delayed his departure fxom Washington,

D. C., to conduct Bureau business in order to be available for

testimony and that on two separate occasions the Committee had

found it necessary to reschedule his testimony.

He was advised

that Assistant Director Bassett would be available during the

week of 2/9/76

and that we requested he be given the opportunity

to testify during that week or some other mutually agreeable time.

Epstein stated that it was the intention of the Committee to go

forward on 2/3/76 without Assistant Director Bassett and mentioned

that former Acting Associate Director W. Mark Felt who had been

head of the Bureau's Inspection Division would be available to

testify concerning this matter.

It was pointed out to Epstein

that Mr. Felt is no longer with the FBI and is not in a position

to act as spokesman for Bureau inspection policies and procedures

which are currently in existence under Director Kelley. Epstein

again indicated that the Committee would

'go on without a Bureau

representative.

John I. Elliff, Director of the Domestic Task Force of

the Senate Select Committee, was immediately contacted and advised

of Epstein's decision and the background concerning this matter.

Elliff was advised that the Committee certainly would want all the

information available concerning inspection procedures in the

Bureau to

get a fair picture of this area of Bureau operations.

Elliff agreed and stated he would insure Assistant Director Bassett

would be given the opportunity to testify as to the Bureau's current

inspection procedures and policies. This testimony, however, may

not be at the same time

as the appearance of W. Mark Felt, et al.

relating to the Secret Army Organization (SAO) that

appeared in a series of articles beginning January 1l,

1976, in the

"San Diego Union" Newspaper.

These articles

alleged the FBI created and financed the

SAO and controlled

the activities of this group through an informant, Howard Barry!

Godfrey, who was a leader of this organization.

You were

also advised the inquity being conducted concerning these allega-

tions had thus far indicated they were unfounded.

This is to advise you that our inquiry into

this matter has been completed.

This inquiry which

included a review of all pertinent court records and

FDI Headquarters and San Diego Field Office files reveals

allegations against the rBl, concerning our investigation

of the SAO, are without merit and clearly shows the FBI

did not organize, control, or tinance the SAl. Intormatior

planned by the SAO was immediately disseminated to

appropriate law enforcement agencies.

In the above-mentioned series of articles

there were certain allegations made by former S10 members

and

associates when interviewed by newspaper reporter Patrick

Dillon. These individuals previously expressed a desire

to the news media to discredit Godfrey, or had been found

guilty following legal proceedings in which Godfrey was

an important witness.

The Attorney General

(1) Godfrey assigned SAO members to kidnap antiwar

demonstrators during the 1972 Republican National Convention

school offices, firebombing vehicles, and making threatening

calls.

One individual who made allegations against Godfrey,

when interviewed by Mr. Dillon, also testified during the trial

of an SAO member that he was responsible for the sale of between

$10,000 and $20,000 worth of weapons and explosives to Godfrey.

This person later entered a guilty plea in court, State of

California, for the charge of perjury in connection with this

testimony.

The extensive review of pertinent FBI and court

should be noted no information to document or substantiate

these allegations has been produced.

In view of the above we contemplate no further inquiry

in this matter.

NOTE:

advised of articles appearing in

against the FBI and former informant Howard Barry Godfrey were

refuted. These allegations appeared primarily in the "San

Patrick Uillon, which commenced 1/11/76. Allegations included:

The. SAU Was an extension of the Counterintelligence Program

(COINTUL'RO), the FBI gave Godfrey between $10,000 and $20,000

and get local activists on the run; the FBI

organized, financed and controlled the SAO, end Godfrey conspired

and attempted to commit murder.

Instant memorendum relates to certain allegations

made by former SAO members and associates when interviewed by

newspaper reporter Dillon in preparation of the above-mentioned

series of articles. Extensive review of all pertinent Bureau

and San Diego Field Office files as well as pertinent transcripts

of court and grand jury proceedings: regarding SAU members has

Re: Secret Army urganization (SAO)

(4) Godfrey had an obsession with regard to long haired,.

New Left types. He talked of bombing them with an airplane,

dropping mortar rounds on them, and beating them up.

These allegations were made by individuals who

had previously expressed a desire to the newe media to

discredit Godfrey and those who were found

guilty following

legal proceedings in which Godirey was an important witness.

Additional inquiry is not warranted since information to

document or substantiate these allegations has not been

produced and all vailable files and documents have been

reviewed.

In a letter. dated 1/21/76, the Attorney General (AG)

vas advised that the FBI was conducting an inquiry into

ellegations thet the Bureau acted improperly while investigating

the SAU. The AG will be advised of results of the inquiry

into all allegation: by separate communication.

This is to advise of our interpretation of analytical infor-

mation relating to our discontinued Counterintelligence Programs

(Cointelpros) prepared by the Senate Select Committee (SSC).

On 2/2/76 the Department made available for our review

a number of FBI documents the SSC intends to publish in connection

with its forthcoming report. Included with the material were three

SSC prepared charts (copies attached) analyzing the same five basic

domestic Cointelpros which were reviewed in 1974 by the Department

Study Co amittee on FBI Cointelpros (Petersen Committee). The

statistics utilized by the SSC in compiling the charts differ from

those reported by the Petersen Committee, and the SSC has also

established ditferent categories for characterizing Cointelpro actions

than used in the Petersen report. The following is a description of

the three SSC charts.

1. Cointelpro Composite (SSC Exhibit 10). 'This chart

lists seven basic categories for the 2, 679 total Cointelpro actions

tabulated by the sse, it being noted this is 310 more actions than

calculated by the Petersen Committee. The iirst three categories,

(4) Attacks on Speaking, Teaching, Writing, and Meeting; (2) Inter

ference w/ Personal and Economic Rights; and (3) Abuse of Government

Processes, place approximately 925 of the Cointelpro actions in an

area indicating FBI violation of constitutional rights with possible

criminal and civil liability. The fourth category, Third Party Hostile,

apparently indicates Cointelpro actions directed to cause hostile

action to a target, probably by third parties. Categories 5 and 6,

dissension within organizations or to expose through publicity the

activities of a targeted group or individual. The seventh category,

Comintil, undoubtedly is a reference to F'3I efforts to expose or

disrupt communist efforts to infiltrate a noncommunist organization,

it being noted this category is only tabulated for the Communist Party,

USA, Program.

The SSC categories differ from those of the Petersen

report in that the first three clearly are in terms indicating a viola-

tion of First Amendment rights with possible criminal and/or civil

liability. The four other categories do not necessarily indicate

criminal or civil wrongdoing, but probably indicate actions outside

the charter of the FBI, Regarding the Comintil category, the SSC

has been critical of our use of "Communist Infiltration" which the

Committee views as a pretext for such investigations as those

involving the Southern Christian Leadership Conierence,

Martin Luther King, Poor Peoples March, and Women's Liberation

Movement.

2. Cointelpro Categories by Program (SSC Exhibit 11).

This chart consists of five individual charts representing the basic

domestic Cointelpros and graphically illustrates the characterizations

of actions conducted in each program.

The five charts illustrate the differences in the figures

for Cointelpro actions as tabulated by the Petersen Committee and

the SSC. These are as follows.

3. Cointelpro Activity (SSC Exhibit 22). This chart

endeavors to tabulate the number of Cointelpro actions for each pro-

gram on a quarterly basis for each year from 1956 to 1971. The

chart indicates approximately 60 percent of all Cointelpro actions

were conducted in the Communist Party Program which in two

quarters reached approximately 75 actions and which was most

active during the period 1960 to 1967. The chart also indicates all

the programs except the Black Nationalist commenced to taper

down in terms of actions beginning in or before 1969. The Black

Nationalist Cointelpro was active up until 1971 with some 40 actions

effected in the last quarter of 1970.

OBSERVATIONS:

While the Petersen Committee report attempted to place

Cointelpro activity in 12 descriptive categories, the SSC, according

to the Cointelpro composite chart, obviously is endeavoring to

characterize the actions to highlight alleged abuses and possible

criminal or civil liability. Categories I, 2 and 3 place approximately

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re: Cointelpros

62-116009

34 percent of all Cointelpro actions within areas of constitutional or

statutory violation, obviously indicating possible criminal or civil

liability. This indicates the thrust of the forthcoming SSC report,

as relates to our discontinued Cointelpros, will either criticize the

Petersen Committee report as an inadequate review or one possibly

based on incomplete information. The SSC very likely intends to

dispute the Petersen Committee report conclusion that the "over-

whelming bulk of these activities were clearly legitimate and proper

undertakings, within the scope of the F'BI's ongoing responsibilities, "

and to characterize the activities as criminal or civil violations of

individual rights or outside the mandate or charter of the FBI.

We may expect the SsC, in its forthcoming report, as

was done in public hearings, to highlight FBI Cointelpro abuses using

selected documentation from FBIfiles to support its conclusion. It

is likely the SSC will recommend legislation to preclude future

Cointelpro-type activities and it is possible it will recommend

criminal or civil prosecutions. As was done with the Petersen

Committee report, the subjective characterization of an action as

falling within one of several arbitrarily described categories is not

only a matter of individual interpretation, but raises questions which

cannot be objectively answered. Whether or not these actions are

truly thought to be prosecutable offenses, the innuendo arising from

their characterization is in itseli damaging.

ACTION:

None. For information.

Senator Mondale explained at the outset that

drafting legislation outlining Bureau responsibilities in

the domestic intelligence area. He requested that Bureau

representatives highlight. operations in this field and

support,, by specific examples, why the Bureau believes

there is a contimuing need for this type investigation.

Between the approximate hours 10:00 a.m. to

112:00 noon, Bureau representatives offered statements

and answered questions concerning the following topics:

suggested legislation based on both the "Stone" language

and the proposed Attorney General guidelines; cetinition

bf Governmental interests as basis for "Domestic

Intelligence Investigations;" extent of terrorist activity

(both foreign and domestic oriented) in this country;

value of intelligence-type investigations in deterring

terrorist activity; and assessment of potential for

terrorist activity during the forthcoming year.

At approximately 12:00 noon, Senators Mondale

and Morgan departed because of other commitments. Before

departing, Senator Mondale stated he believed the Session

to be helpful but noted the discussion had not included

intelligence investigations of so-called subversive

domestic organizations and individuals who do not appear

to pose an immediate threat to this country's internal

security. Senator Mondale proposed, and it was agreed,

that discussion in this area would continue with Staff

Members during the week of 279-13/76 and conclude with

Re: Senstudy 75

62-116395

Upon Senator Mondale's departure, SSC Chief

Counsel Frederick A. 0. Schwartz, JI., acted as chairman.

Mr. Shackelford read into the

record a

statement concerning

the need for continued Bureau investigations of domestic

organizations and individuals calling for illegal

overthrow of the Government even though the threat is

not imminent. Following numerous questions and answers

in this area, the Session was adjourned at 1:00 p.m.,

with no date set for further discussion.

OBSERVATIONS:

While present, Senator Mondale from his comments

appeared to acknowledge that in any proposed legistation

some verbiage would have to be Included allowing for,

Investigations in the domestic intelligence area. He

seemed most concerned, however, and expressed cognizance.

of the difficulty in drafting legislation permitting such

Investigations yet preventing

ng investigations based upon

political beliefs and also preventing the FBI from being

misused by Government officials at some future date in

this sensitive area.

Senator Morgan verbally claimed he

recognized the need for intelligence-type investigations

that, in investigations of organizations calling for

violence, such investigations should be limited only to

that segment of the organization which actually participated

in or advocated violence.

Senator Morgan was critical of

Bureau investigations of the Klan and certain COINTELPRO

actions against Martin Luther King, JI., and other segments

of the black nationalist movement. He was also critical

of current Bureau leadership and expressed the belief this

DATE 11/7/00- BY 3P.2 ALMIEAL ALMIEAL:

'Senator Frank Church

A year ago the Select Committee on Intélligence began its

investigation of the American intelligence service. Since then,

the road we have traveled has been long and hard. But now the

end of the journey is near. Soon the Committee wili present its

final recommendations. -

We have sat neither as judges nor jurors in this inguiry.

It has not been

our function to act as a Grand Jury. Our purpose,

rather, has

been to obtain information to aid the legislative

process.

particular, we have sought the knowledge and under-

standing, based

on a close review of intelligence activities over

the

past three decades, which could help us develop sound legis-

lative remedies to reform the intelligence agencies and prevent

abuses of power in the future.

The criminal investigation and prosecution of officials

within the intelligence service who may have violated the law

is not the task of this, or any other, Congressional committee.

all Members of Congress, and the citizens they represent,

should be concerned that justice takes its proper and impartial

• course in this matter.

The Senate Select Committee has spent the better part of a

yeax ferreting out the facts and has established that many laws

have indeed

been violated. The list is extensive:

From 1956 to 1971, the Federal Bureau of Investigation

carpied

out five counterintalligence programs, or "COINTELPROS,"

against a variety of organizations involved in

peaceful protest.

Among these organizations were the Southern Christian leadership

Conference, most black student groups, and various antiwar groups.

The FBI program against the. New left was the most wide-

sweeping of all. Its targets included underground newspapers,

students protesting various university policies, the antiwar

Inter-University Conmittee for Debate on Foreign Policy, and

several colleges and universities.

The FBI tactics included the use of anonymous letters and

telephone calls designed to disrupt families, friendships.,

careers, and organizations; the use of agents provocateurs to

sow dissension and fragment groups; the dissemination of fake

information about individuals to employers, credit bureaus,

and

creditors; the instigation of tax investigations against certain

citizens for harassment purposes, alone; the investigation of the

private life of group leaders for whispering to the press;

and

an

almost endless list of equally deplorable assaults on First

Amendment rights.

From 1962 until his death, Dr. Martin Luther King was the

target of a vicious campaign by the FBI to discredit him as the

most prominent black activist in America. The full array of the

Bureau's

sophisticated devices of technical surveillance was

turned against Dr. King. He was illegally bugged, tapped, and

followed.

Information on his

private life was then delivered by

agents

of the FBI to clergymen, Members of Congress, the White

House,

United States Ambassadors, newsmen, the National Science

Foundation, and the British Government, among others. Agents

were sent to colleges to persuade them not to grant Dr. King

honorary degrees.

•. •

Infornation obtained fren microphone coverage of Dr. King

was hand-carried to prominent clergynen

throughout the country.

As one agent

recalls:

palian

that we could have done a much more honorable

out there, and I'm inclined

to think that he was right.

Thirty-four days before Dr. King was to fly to Norway to

receive the highest honor an American can earn, the Nobel Prize

for Peace, the Federal Bureau of Investigation even sent hima

message urging him to take his own life. The unsigned note read:

King, there is only one thing left for you

to do.

You know what it is.

You have just

34 days in which to do it.

(This exact number

has been selected for a specific reason.)

It

• has definite

practical significance.

You are

done.

There is but one way out for you.

The FBI has engaged in a host of other questionable activ-

ities, including the collection of intelligence on critics and

political opponents of incumbent Presidents.

In 1969,. the Internal Revenue Service established a Special

Service Staff (SSS). For the next five years the SS Staff was

used by the IRS and, indirectly, the FBI to gather intelligence

on dissident groups. Its 11,458 files included dossiers on anti-

war leaders, black

political leaders, writers, labor organizers,

tax

reform groups; civi: rights groups, women's liberation groups,.

clergymen, and many more.

In 1967, a Special Operations Group was formed in the Central

Intelligence Agency. Its purpose was to explore possible ties

between hostile foreign nations and domestic dissent within the

United States. The project received the codename "Operation CHAOS."

Over a six-year period, CHAOS accumulated more than 13,000 files,

including 7,200 on American citizens. Through this program the

CIA became

storehouse for the stockpiling of large quantities

of data on citizens of this country.

From 1940 to 1973, various illegal mail-opening programs

were conducted intermittently by the CIA and the FBI. The CIA

program ran -- off and on -- from 1952 to 1973, and involved the

opening of mail to and fron American citizens. " This mail was

intercepted in five major cities within the United States, with

the larges operation taking place in New York City. In that

metropolis alone,

9,000 letters were opened and read by CIA agent's

NW 88608 Docld:32989578 Page 59

in the

year of the program. Among the

dividuals and

• organizations whose mail was examined were' Arthur Burns, Mrs.

Martir. Luther King: ür., Richard Nixon,, Senators Hunphrey and

Kennedy, the Ford Foundation, Harvard University, and the

Rockefeller Foundation.

The FBI mail-opening program ran from 1940 to 1966, with

Federal agents

in seven American cities reading and photograph-

ing letters written by citizens of the United States. The FBI

also cooperated with the CIA mail progran in New York City, re-

ceiving copies of more than 50,000 intercepted letters from the

Agency between 1958 and 1973. Military intelligence units

shared the CIA take, too.

In the Summer of 1970, the so-called Huston Plan was drafted

for and approved by the President. Based on a sweeping review of

intelligence collection

nethods prepared by officials of the CIA,

• the FBI, tha

rational Security Agency (NSA), the Defense Intelli-

cations of U.S. cizizens; intensify the electronic surveillance

of domestic dissidents; lied the mail of American citizens; break

into the homes of comestic dissenters; and increase the coverage

of college students.

Althoug: the Plan vas viscinded five days after its initial

approval, several of the programs continued - just as they had

gone on before the Presidertial annointment.

They had a life of

their

own, apart from higher

whose names appeared on the watch list were automatically sorted

out and monitored by NSA computers. The messages were also

dis-

seminated to the CIA, the FBI, and the Secret Service.

Throughout

the 1960's and early 1970's, over 16,000 American names were

placed on the NSA watch list.

Moreover, since 1945, three international telegraph comp-

anies provided the United States Government with copies of

telegrams sent abroad by American citizens. This program was

turned over to the National Security Agency, when that agency

was established in 1952 and it became known as "Operatio."

SHAMROCK. " American

names on the NSA watch list served as '

computer indexes or signals for the private companies to sort.

from their large volume of messages those which were of interest

to the government. These messages were then circulated to the

Bureau and the CIA.

This is, by no means, a comprehensive list of unlawful

conduct by the intelligence agencies. The possibility of perjury

by intelligence officers before the Congress is not the least of

several questions which have yet to be resolved by a thorough

investigation of the evidence.

This is an issue of utmost im-

portance, since the Congress cannot hope to arrive at useful

remedial legislation on

the intelligence service -- or any other

public policy concern -- if it is not told the truth.

• The issue, then, is not whether laws. have been violated,

but rather when and how justice will be served. The "when" ought

to be as soon as possible; the "how" is a more tangled problem.

An argument can be made in favor of allowing the usual

processes and institutions to take their course. The justice

Department has begun to

conduct criminal investigations of several

cases uncovered by the Rockefeller Commission and the committees

of Congress. It can be argued that these investigations should

not be interrupted since they

have

already begun.

Certainly, the present Attorney General is a man of

integrity. He has voiced his concern several times over re-

garding the abuses which have come to light through the inves-.

tigations of the past jear. He has been helpful to the Select

Committee by providing documents and other information. I'have

full confidence in his good intentions and his respect for the

zaw .

Nonetheless, the Attorney General faces an unfortunate

dilemma. Since the Federal Bureau of Investigation is a sub-

division of the Justice Department, it lies within the adminis-

trative responsibility of the Attorney General. He is thus

placed in a position of investigating the very house over which

he must preside.

It is not only the actuality of impartiality which is at

stake. The appearance of impartiality is just as important.

The American Bar Association Standards for Criminal Justice provide

that a prosecuting officer should have no conflict of interest

or the appearance of a conflict of interest. As Chesterfield

Smith, past president of the ABA, has noted, "Under the Standards,

it would be improper for an investigation...of the Executive

Branch of the Federal Government to be conducted by a prosecutor

subject to the direction ánd control of the President."

The fact that the FBI is a part of the Justice Department

is not the only troubling aspect of this situation -- though it

is serious enough since, over the years, senior FBI officials

and Justice personnel have had close contact in their daily work

and have shared knowledge of the dubious activities brought to

light by the Select Comnittee inquiry. The Justice Department

and the CIA have also had a unique relationship. A secret agree-

ment between the

two was in effect for twenty years which exempted

the Agency from the usual requirements of reporting to Justice

any violations of the law anong CIA personnel.

Moreover, it is the Justice Department which is supposed

to

represent intelligence officials who may be sued for civil

damages as a consequence of the disclosures brought about by the

Congressional investigations. How can the Justice Department

investigate and prosecute these officials, on the one hand, and

defend their interests in civil suits on the other? It just will

not work:

It is obvious that the public is deeply troubled by the

findings of the investigations into the intelligence service.

• :

In a recent Harris Survey, 80 percent of those interviewed agreed

"it was wrong for the FBI to send a note to Martin Luther King

suggesting that he commit suicide." 74 Percent agreed "it was

wrong for the CIA to work out a deal with Mafia characters to

try to assassinate Castro.". And 6l percent agreed "it was a

violation of basic rights for the CIA and FBI to conduct spying

on prominent Americans here at hone."

The government must move decisively.

To avoid charges of

a whitewash, it is in the best interests of the Justice Depart-

ment to disqualify itself in this case.

What is vital now is to guarantee a full, thorough and

independent investigation. A special prosecutor should be en-

listed for this purpose, and given sufficient authority to fully

perform the task.

Last year, the American Bar Association Committee to Study

Federal Law Enforcement Agencies addressed itself in

a prelimi-

nary report to the question

of

a special prosecutor.

The

• Committee rejected the establishment of a permanent special

prosecutor, but noted that "the public must be assured that crimes

comnitted in high places will be investigated and prosecuted

fearlessly and with integrity."

To this end, the ABA Comnittee

properly concluded:

-7-

NW 88608 Docld:32989578 Page 63

## Page 64

There may be exceptional circumstances

requiring a special prosecutor from

side the Department of justice who is

not dependent on the Attorney General

or the President for future promotion

or other preferment.

The primary obli-

gation to

appoint such an attorney should

in the Attorney General.

The relationship between the Justice Department and the

intelligence service unquestionably presents us with an excep-

tional circumstance.

The person chosen to perform the task

of special prosecutor

must possess the same impartiality and strength of resolution

which Leon Jaworski demonstrated during his appearance before a

committee of Congress in 1973. The following exchange occurred

that year in hearings before the Senate Committee on the

Judiciary:

Senator Tunney. So as I understand your

statement today, you feel that if there

criminal activity which is

indictable, that you would be prepared to

nove ahead

an investigation and in-

distments despite the fact that the defen-

lants involved might be prepared to clain

security required them to

do what they did?

Mr. Jaworski.

hat is right, sir

And

hey would have the burden of sustainin

that position.

I would not assume the

burden.

I would contest it.

The special prosecutor, mcreover, should be imbued with the same

faith in the law that possessed john Adams, who knew that the

law "without any regard to persors, commands that which is good

and punishes evil in all, whether rich or poor, high or low --

'tis deaf, inexorable, inflerible."

The basic machinery of a special prosecutor's office is

already in place as a legacy

of the watergate affair. It should.

not be too difficult to modify this machinery in the appropriate

manner to carry out the investigation of unlawfulness

in the

intelligence agencies.

0-8-

NW 88608 Docld:32989578 Page 64

## Page 65

It may be argued that we should concentrate on the reform

of the intelligence agencies for the future, not or the punish-

ment of individuals for misdeeds of the past. This is a be-

guiling argument.

But the truth is that we can ill-afford to

overlook the lawlessness of the past if we wish to avoid a

repetition

in the future. As two scholars from the Center for

National Security Studies, Jerry J. Berman and Morton H. Halperin,.

noted in a recent New York Times article:

One key element in bringing the intelligence

agencies under democratic control is to

insure

that officials of intelligence agencies are

prosecuted when they violate the law.

Unless

there is a thorough investigation by an impar-

-tial prosecutor followed by indictments and a

report,

the threat of criminal penalties will

not deter future abuses.

I find it utterly deplorable that the President in his

• State of the Union message failed completely to say even

a word

about the need to make our intelligence agencies obey the lai.

As the journálist Anthony Lewis has comnented, "It is easy to

denounce private crime, as ir. Ford did. But it is more important,

now, for Government to commit itself to law."

And so I must conclude that, in the present situation,

resort to a temporary speciai prosecutor is both proper and

necessary. Leon Jaworski, a former Special Prosecutor himself,

and others

in the legal community agree with this conclusion.

In this regard, Bauman has requested SA Brooke D. Roberts

Re:

Senstudy 75

62-116395

SA Andrew J. Duffin, through Mr. Walter Elder,

CIA Review Staff, on 2/10/76, determined that CIA was

in fact to participate in an interview of Bauman with

an SSC Staff Member in the near future. He is to be

interviewed regarding his prior contact with E. Howard

Hunt and Project Merry Mack, acronym for CIA's efforts

to prevent any electronic penetration of their building

during its construction. CIA hopes that interview will

negate the necessity of Bauman having to answer SSC

subpoena, as they feel it will show he will not be the

"hot" witness that SSC anticipates.

Subsequently, Hagerty was advised of above and

that Roberts should not participate in interview, as it

was an SSC interview and only concerned them and CIA.

ACTION:

None. For information.

Elliff concluded by saying that he intends

to present, on 1/29//6, to SSC Members a typed agenda

for the scheduled Executive Session and, when approved,

he will furnish the Bureau a copy of same on 1/30/76.

OBSERVATIONS:

A large segment of the above briefing was

consumed by Elliff expounding on his personal views

(and Bureau rebuttal thereto, where applicable) concerning

domestic intelligence investigations. Elliff stated

that such investigations should only be conducted when

a criminal violation or a distinct potential for same

Vis present. For this reason he believes that informants

should not be targeted against domestic organizations

or individuals unless the potential for criminal

violence is present, and that investigations of domestic

'organizations and individuals should be removed from

the Bureau's Intelligence Division and transferred to

the Bureau's General Investigative Division. The

Intelligence Division would then become the Counterintelligence

Division and would handle only intelligence investigations

having foreign ramifications which he said would include

the Communist Party but not organizations such as the

Socialist Worker's Party. Continuing, he stated his

belief that valuable intelligence-type information

naturally flow from our criminal investigations in

these areas. With regard to determining the potential

for civil unrest, Elliff postured that accurate infor-

mation in this field could be obtained through overt

chis t411

contact with civic leaders and not through covert use

of informants. To support the latter position, Elliff

quoted unnamed former officials of the now defunct

Interdepartment Information Unit (IDIU) who readily

stated the majority of the Bureau information furnished

that Unit emanated from public sources. In essence,

Elliff made the observation that he was opposed to

domestic intelligence-type investigations as currently

conducted by this Bureau and he advocated that any

investigation of a domestic organization or individual

¡be based upon criminal statute. It was noted that

Elliff, though not equating "potential" with probable

cause, had difficulty specifically defining "potential"

in the above context.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) That Legal Counsel Division maintain

close liaison with John Ellift to obtain formal copy

of approved agenda for scheduled 2/2/76 SSC Executive

RE: Criticisns af-FBI BJ U.S. Senator,

Robert B Morgan of North Carolina

Reference my letter of January 23,1976 addressed to you and

enclosing data concerningpublicly uttered adverse remarks about

Morgan dated January 24.

Since then the "Asheville Citizen" Asheville N.C. printed

a portion of my rebuttal in its January 30,k976 issue, in an

artiche titled:"Retired Agent Questions Morgan's FBI position".

A copy of this

news item is enclosed.

Also I've received replies from U.S. Senator Jesse Helms,

(R),N.C. and from U.S. Representative, Roy A.laylor, (D),D.C.

who represents the Eleventh Congressional District

and which

includes the Ashevill and Spruce Pine areas. I'm enclosing

copies of their replies which you will find

sapportive

and encouraging. In fact, Mr. laylor went out of his way to

support the FBI in his remarks of January 22,1976 in the

Congressional Record. Acopy of his remarks is also enclosed.

Finally, on February 5, 1976 I received a reply from

Senator Morgan, dated February 3,,976 which was less_ than

favorable. A copy of his letter is enclosed. Today I

am replying to Mr. Morgan in the form of a retter to him

dated February 7, a copy of which I'm enclosing for you.

Dear Senator Morgan:

DATE L/7/0O BY SPa ALMIEHL

Reference my letter to you dated January 24, 1976 and your

thoughtlul and sincere reply dated February 3, 1976.

I can apprediate your due concern with what you sincerely

belleve to be past abuses and errors of the FBI. I'm sure.you

have heard some sordid testimony, and I'll be the first to agree

that the FBI has had its faults when compared with some theoratical

perfedtion.

I submit however, that you heard only the worst, the most

glaring

and most shocking incidents which can only reptesent the

most infinitesenal number of cases,

taken Izom hundreds of hous

ands of investigations. Much of the testimony heard by you

anated irom disgruntled, sometimes disillusioned and less than

candid individuals, many of whose sense of values and objectivity

has

changed, Ibr various reasons, with the passing of time:

What you didn't hear was the testimony of thousands of

seLIless citizens, many of whom risked their lives and personal

Safety to work undercover or semi-covertly in a sincere effom

to assist the fBI in protecting this country, it citizens and

their civil liberties.

You dida't bear of the interminable and consistent FBI

investigations which scrupulously went the extra steps to protect

one legal rights of individuals under investigation. Nor did you

neas the testimony of thousa,ds oi rearius and concerned citizens

parents and other close relatives of persons whose warped minds

and actions were aimed at destroying our government and thereby

the civil liberties of their victims, both black and white.

Exon a philosophical as well as a prag matic standpoint perhaps:

we can agzee that the potential harm to privacy must be weighed

against the necessity lor law enforcement action in relation to

social and security needs at any given time,

If only one or the other of these interests is to be consid-

ered to the exclusion of the others irrationality results-and,

should this irrationally persist protractedly, in either direct

jon, our nation would tend to tyranny, namely,

the

one side or tyranny of police agencies on the other.

For this reason-alone some flexibility is paramount.

Another perplexing issue comes to mind. Will Congress be

accoustable if it is the ultimate judge or decision maker for ouz

Intelligence and counter-intelligence operations?

In raising these questions I'm confident that Congress will

ulimately pass some guideline legislation for our intelligence

agenciesand will include therein a certain amount of oversight

provisions stipulating some sort of prior restraint on proposed

tactics or intelligence strategies.

With this in mind we have to recognize that internationally

there has

always been a need for this country to learn things that

people would not ordinarily tell a foreigner-or that domestically

there are things that a criminal or revolutionary would not ordin

arily tell a public official; nor would this type person lay his or

her activities bare to public scrutiny. It follows thatthese narurau

This is a sincere and searching question.

Isn't out main paradox perhaps that of the imperfection of.

hunan beings and, therefore, human instituions which means

that

we never get the choice between pure virtue and pure vice?

This is particularly true in the intelligence zield. The

system must be realistically viewed as a proximate solution to

a2 insoluble problem.

There has always been and there always will be some sing

sone wrongaoing and some errors of judgement in high places,

including intelligence agencies. But it follows that the same

imperfections exist

and will continue to exist in the remainder

o1 society. lt is illusory to wait for a perfect solution. There

perseverence can fight for the better cause lest it lose out to

theworse, Once weaccept this understanding perhaps some of our

Imperfections will not occasion the cynicism and self flagellation

of our sociaty that exists today:

With this in mind let us assume that the FBI and CIA did,

on occasion exceed their authority. Let us not in our efforts

to correct the problem think that we can, by a streke of legislation

eliminate any need for covert intelligence operations. For we

can rest assured that neither the Russians nor the Chinese will

join us in this quest for a Utopian and nobler less secretive

international os domestic community. Any hasty,

of so-called purification on our part will not

in closing, while you and I do nou currently see eye to eye
