AGENT'S NOTES: Attention is invited to Court Order in the Spanish lan-

guage, dated 12 February 1963, by which SUBJECT'S father legally changed his name

to Manuel Marti, (EXHIBIT TY

_), which was subsequently translated into the

English language (EXHIBIT

â†’. Attention is further invited to the discre-

pancy between the spelling Of SUBJECT'S father's surname on the Court Order and

on the Certificate of Birth Registration. Source advised that the spelling Martir

was a typographical error, and that the surname would be changed to read Marti.

Attention is further invited to tle fact that the term natural child is a term

used in Puerto Rico, when a child's birth is registered at the Bureau of Demo-

graphic Registry by someone other than the parents of the child. The chila takes

the name of the mother and the father's name does not appear on the record, in-

asmuch as the parents are not married

to each other.
