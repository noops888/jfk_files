Mr. William E. Colby
Director of Central Intelligence
Central Intelligence Agency
Washington, D. C.
Dear Mr. Colby:
On May 27 and June 2, the Senate Select Committee informed
the Central Intelligence Agency of the Committee's plans
for examining the field of foreign intelligence and the
subject of covert action. In the area of the domestic
activities of the Central Intelligence Agency, the Select
Committee intends to address a wide range of issues,
including the domestic aspects of CIA's foreign operations.
The Committee intends to approach the issues of the CIA'S
domestic activities with a broad perspective, realizing,
as I am sure you agree, that the threats to United States
security and the need to protect sources and methods of
intelligence, as well as CIA installations and personnel,
cross our national borders.
Basically, the subjects of investigation fall into the
following five headings:
1.
Counterintelligence activities at home and those
counterintelligence activities abroad which involve
American citizens, including activities undertaken
pursuant to the Director's authority to protect intel-
ligence sources and methods.
2. Foreign intelligence activities at home and those foreign
intelligence activities abroad which involved American
citizens.
3.
The domestic operations of the CIA undertaken in sup-
port of activities abroad.

4.
Relationships between other organizations, public and
private, and the CIA.
5.
The use of CIA personnel, funds, or facilities for pur-
poses unrelated to its intelligence missions.
Within these broad subjects of investigation, the Committee
will examine "questionable activities" by the CIA. These
activities are those where there exist, in the words of the
agreed upon Outline for Inquiry Procedures, "specific alle-
gations of Agency or Executive Branch abuses or other con-
troversial specific matters where there is reason to believe
improprieties may have occurred". The following categories
are believed by the Committee to be among those in which
questionable activities have taken place: mail openings;
electronic surveillance; equipment testing within the United
States; surreptitious entries; penetration of dissident
groups; use of cover and false documentation; security inves-
tigations, including those initiated as a result of or in
connection with news leaks; use of polygraphs3 political
misuse of the CIA; assistance provided CIA by other agencies
or private companies and CIA's assistance to them; CIA
management of its investments; CIA use of proprietaries,
notional organizations and devised facilities; CIA experi-
ments with drugs on unwitting U. S. citizens3; CIA detention
of individuals within the United States.
In regard to each questionable activity chosen for study,
the Select Committee will examine the nature of the activity
and will attempt to evaluate the results. The Committee
will also look at the CIA's authority to undertake the
activity, the relationship between the activity and the CIA'S
missions, the internal mechanisms for initiation and review,
and the external mechanisms for control of such activities.
Though the initial focus will be on the specific question-
able activity, the Select Committee's inquiry is designed
to reach fundamental issues which bear directly on the ade-
quacy of the administrative organization and procedures of
the CIA, and the legislation presently controlling the
Agency. Among the major issues which the Committee will
address are:

and counterintelligence activities within the United
States or directed at U. S. citizens abroad? How were
these objectives set? Were they appropriate? Should
they be modified?
4.
What is the origin and purpose of the charge to the
Director, Central Intelligence, to protect intelligence
sources and methods? What actions have been taken pur-
suant to it? Were those actions appropriate? Should
the charge be clarified or revised? Should the DCI be
provided with additional authority in order to carry
out the charge?
5.
What is the origin and purpose of the prohibition on
CIA in respect to police and law enforcement powers,
and internal security functions? Has this prohibition
interferred with the DCI's charge to protect intelli-
gence sources and methods? To what extent has this
prohibition interferred with other duties and missions
of the CIA? Should the prohibition be clarified or
revised?

CIA and other governmental bodies? To what extent did
CIA coordination and cooperation with other government
agencies result in questionable activities by the CIA;
to what extent did the failure to cooperate or coordinate
activities result in questionable activities by the CIA?
How did the cooperation or coordination of activities
with other governmental agencies relate to the prohibi-
tion on the CIA's exercise of police and law enforcement
powers or internal security functions? Should the pro-
cedures and practices involving other governmental
agencies be clarified or revised?

and obtained the CIA's assistance for political pur-
poses or personal advantage? To what extent have

activities? What measures have been or should be taken
to ensure that the CIA is not misused in such ways?

ATTACHMENT I.
DOCUMENTS REQUESTED FOR STAFF REVIEW
This attachment lists files and other documentary
materials which the Select Committee hereby requests be
made available for staff review.
In the first instance, all of the specified material
will be reviewed in unsanitized form by staff at CIA head-
quarters.
The Committee will continue to select particular
documents to be transmitted to the Committee's offices in
Washington to be used in preparing for hearings and the
Committee's report.
In order to expedite production of the requested
materials we have indicated, where known to the Committee,
offices within the CIA which would be appropriate starting
points to search for the materials. This effort to
expedite matters does not limit the CIA's responsibility
to search for such materials throughout the Agency, using
as appropriate, lists and indices of CIA projects and pro-
grams.
This request calls for "all files" of various programs
or projects, and "all files" regarding particular incidents
or entities. Requests for "all files" are intended by the
Committee to include 'all subject, correspondence chronological
Photocopy from the Gerald R. Ford Library
NW 50955 DocId:32112856 Page 7
2
and all other files or unfiled documentary materials in
the office, or storage repositories, of the organizational
unit which managed the program or project in question.
The requests also include all such files in the
offices or storage repositories of the responsible Division
Director, Office Director, and Directorate Deputy Director,
in the DCI office, and in any other part of the Agency which
had significant involvement or connection with the program.
Where the Committee requests "documents" or "docu-
mentary materials", those terms are defined as all corres-
pondence, memoranda, notes, working papers, buck slips and
routing slips, studies, reports, charts, films, tapes, and
all other writings, printings, typings, or drafts, and
copies or reproductions.
When files for a specific project or program are re-
quested under the best known designation of that project
or program, the request includes files of any earlier or
later versions of that project. Thus, the request for
Project MHCHAOS would also comprehend files for the ante-
cedent MHALPHA and MHPASHA projects and for the subsequent
MHVAPOR.
When any files, portions thereof, or particular docu-
mentary materials are no longer available, the Committee
Photocopy from the Gerald R. Ford Library
NW 50955 DocId:32112856 Page 8
3
requests that they be specified with an accompanying
explanation of when and under what circumstances they were
destroyed. If no information regarding their destruction
is available, please specify the earliest time, and under
what circumstances, CIA first became aware the items were
missing.
We expect that staff representatives of the Committee
and of CIA will expedite compliance with these requests,
and indicate priorities for production through preliminary
review of this notification and discussion of the files
involved. It would also be helpful if CIA identifies those
persons within each Directorate and Division or Office who
are actually in charge of reviewing and assembling material,
so that Committee staff can also discuss these requests with
them and resolve rapidly any questions or difficulties
which might arise.
We also expect that a good deal of this material will
be readily available in view of the reviews already done
by CIA in this area over the past two years. As soon as
some portions of any requests are available for review, the
Committee staff should be notified in order that they may
begin their inspection while the remainder is being assembled.

Finally, it should be noted that this document re-
quest does not supersede any earlier requests for material
in this area which are still outstanding. If CIA staff
encounters overlap in responding to this and earlier re-
quests, the Committee staff should be promptly notified.

FILES
The following files are requested. In order to expedite
their location, the Committee has indicated offices which
appear to be the best starting point for a search. This does
not limit, nor supersede the general guideline that all files
throughout the CIA relating to a project be procured. If pro-
jects herein identified are not CIA projects, but are identi-
fiable as projects of other agencies with which CIA had some
connection, the request is for all CIA files regarding such
projects.
In the first instance, all of the specified material will
be reviewed in unsanitized form by staff at CIA headquarters.
The Committee will continue to select particular documents to
be transmitted to the Committee's offices in Washington to be
used in preparing for hearings and the Committee's report.
