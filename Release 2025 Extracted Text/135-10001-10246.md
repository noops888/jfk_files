Joseph Selzer of the Inspector General staff made

available to me all the materials he has been able to assemble

from CIA sources concerning Project MONGOOSE. These consist

of three file. folders and one loose-leaf binder.

I have

examined them to determine if any reference is made to assassi-

nation, liquidation, or elimination of Castro.

The first document in this pile is a copy of the

minutes of the August 10, 1962, meeting of the special group

augmented, prepared by Tom Parrot. They were forwarded to

Dr. Chamberlain, the CIA Inspector General, by Robroy Ratliff,

a CIA employee detailed to the National Security Council. A

cover memo of April 18, 1975, was attached, may be of some

interest, and reads as follows:

"FYI,

We received a request from Belin

of the Vice President's Commission to

examine our files on MONGOOSE and other

Cuban and D.R. files.

While this request

has not been resolved, the preliminary

response is not to allow this access.

Signed Robroy Ratliff."

The minutes of the August 10, 1962, meeting

c√∂ntained no mention, implicit or explicit, of assassination.

The first complete file examined

was a long green

cardboard file without a title on it.

Inside, however, it is

no reference to assassination, either explicit or implicit.

The next file examined

is marked. "Cuba Special

Subject." This file also contains miscellaneous papers

relating to Project MONGOOSE, none of which contain any

references to assassination.

The last item of this MONGOOSE package consists

of a bulky loose-leaf binder of papers assembled for General

Carter's reference of significant things that happened during

the period of August to October, 1962. In this notebook, the

Inspector General has already flagged entries which refer in

any way to Operation MONGOOSE. I have examined all such

entries.

Mason Cargill MC

Subject: PROJECT ZRRIFLE AND QJWIN

On April 25, 1975, I was given three file folders

containing material on the

above subjects by Mr. Joseph Selzer

of the Inspector General's

staff. According to Mr. Selzer, his

review of these files indicates

that the basic purpose of

ZRRIFLE and its asset QJWIN was the burglarization of premises

outside the United States for the purpose of obtaining crypto-

logic materials.

He assures me that there is nothing in these

files which refer explicitly or implicitly to assassination or

"executive action" in any form. His opinion is that clandes-

tine operatives of the type who wrote the documents contained

in these

‚Ä¢ files would never commit to writing anything having

to do with the subject of assassination.

The first file reviewed is entitled "ZRRIFLE/QJWIN/

RYBAT OPERATIONAL."

The following entries in this file seem

to have some potential relevance:

The file contains several documents apparently

describing various Italians in the area of Trieste who have

Cable con-

tains the following statement:

"Would like restrict JWIN to

coming mission Dakar and possibly elsewhere (e.g., Milan) for

whom initial contact has been made in Leopoldville.

12. Cable, dated January 19, 1961, from Director to

Luxembourg.

This cable apparently indicates that the Agency

plans to use QJWIN in Leopoldville for more than one particular

mission. It contained the following statement:

"Inform

QJWIN we planning use him Leopoldville indefinitely as dis-

cussed

with him there."

13. There follows a series of cables reflecting the

fact that QJWIN proceeds to Italy to recruit other assets.

One cable admonishes field agents to tell QJWIN not to give

reason to any of the candidates to be recruited in Italy to

believe that ODYOKE or PBPRIME is involved. I get the

impression that ODYOKE refers to the U.S: CIA, and PBPRIME

refers to the intelligence service of some other nation.

However, no document uncovered so far confirms this. Cables

which follow seem to indicate that the people QJWIN was to

recruit were intended to be professional burglars. There is

no indication that they are intended to be assassins.

There

are many other indications that these recruits were intended

for safecracking and breaking and entering. QJWIN told them

he could offer a job for a large firm which wanted certain

commercial documents stolen.

14. Subsequent cables and dispatches indicate other

efforts

on the part of QJWIN to recruit safecrackers in

France and Italy.

15. Dispatch dated June 7, 1961, from headguarters,

Chief, KUTUBE/D to the Chief of Station in Luxembourg.

contains a long discussion of the Agency's relationship with

QJWIN and his main purpose as an agent.

This dispatch makes

it clear that the primary purpose of QJWIN's employment by

the Agency is to recruit burglars and safecrackers for use

by the CIA.

This dispatch contains the first reference I

have found to the code word ZRRIFLE.

The one thing that seems

rather unclear is why QJWIN was initially sent to Leopoldville,

and apparently was contemplated to return to Leopoldville, when

all of his recruiting of safecrackers and burglars takes place

in Europe.

The fact that his return to Leopoldville was con-

templated may be easily seen from paragraph one of this cable.

The releasing officer on this cable was Mr. William K. Harvey.

16.

Correspondence and cables indicate that one James

Rabney from CIA headquarters visited Europe in April and

March of 1961 for the purpose of meeting with Mankel to discuss

possible recruits for safecracking operations.

Station in Luxembourg to Headquarters, Chief, KUTUBE/D.

discusses the efforts of QJWIN to recruit two safecrackers in

Switzerland. dIt indicates that two French citizens, name

b Santelli and (Garioni) were asked to come to Switzerland under

false pretenses by QJWIN for the purpose of being interviewed,

The following passage in the dispatch indicates clearly these

men were to be recruited for the purpose of the safecracking

and surreptitious entry. "During the interview with (Santelli),

06 Garioni observed that for a night job he would neea an

assistant to help him with carrying the equipment and to act

as lookout.

He said he would prefer to do the job during

working hours; for this he would get three or four others to

help him and force someone in the office to open the safe."

18. Dispatch dated February 2, 1962, from Chief of

Station Luxembourg to Headguarters, Chief, KUTUBE/D. It

discusses the efforts of the Luxembourg station to provide

acceptable cover for Mankel in Germany, where the Agency has

decided to locate him.

The plan

seems to be for Mankel to

develop a business as an art dealer in some German town selling

French paintings.

It is contemplated that the Agency will

supply the initial capital for the formation of his business.

The final sentence in this dispatch asked headquarters for

projected operational plans for QJWIN.

19. Cable, dated March 17, 1962, from Director to

Luxembourg indicates that the Agency still contemplates

activity for Mankel in Leopoldville. Paragraph 2 of this cable

reads as

follows:

"Tell him will at same time discuss

Leopoldville assignment and have him sign contract."

The

cable directs Luxembourg to tell Mankel to meet James Rabney

at certain locations in Germany on the 28th and 29th of March,

1961, telling him to be prepared to travel in Europe for about

two weeks.

20. Cable dated April 18, 1962, from'Headquarters to

Luxembourg states that another agent (@JBANNER-5) had informed

the Agency that QJWIN is going on trial after Easter on charges

of cobalt smuggling from 1957 or 1958 and could receive up to a

six-year sentence.

Paragraph 2 of the cable states, "Please

contact QuWIN for ald details including specific charges and

name prosecutor. If, QJBANNER-5) info true we may wish attempt

quash charges or arrange somehow salvage QJWIN for our purposes."

Paragraph

3 states, "Still do not have basic decisions but

fully anticipate we will need QJWIN."

21. Cable, dated April 26, 1962, from Luxembourg to

Headquarters indicates that JWIN's trial will be completed on

April 29.

He expects to be fined but not subject to a jail

sentence. Some indication of the Agency's intents with

respect to JWIN may be discerned from paragraph 4 which

reads as follows:

"While we do not know present long-term

plans for QJWIN, he has no lead to other candidates.

His

potential appears restricted activation to candidates OLLA:

1426 or personal spot action.

Suggest either could be done

from Leopold base and question if not preferable move him to

Leopold assignment now."

There is

a handwritten notation

beside the first sentence of paragraph 4 which states,

"Not

the point."

Beside the last sentence of this paragraph is

the handwritten notation, "How?"

22. Cable dated May 24, 1962, to Luxembourg from

Headguarters

indicates that the Agency has changed its plans

about assigning QJWIN any duties in Leopoldville.

Paragraph 2

reads, "Decision made keep QJWIN Europe.

Leopoldville assign-

ment canceled."

Cable also indicates that headquarters

approves of Mankel's proposed move to Germany, probably

Baden-Baden.

23. Memorandum dated July 3, 1962, WKH Ipresumably

William K. Harvey] from AMS, re ZRRIFLE.

This memo discusses

possible future uses for QJWIN. It seems perfectly consistent

with the use of WIN merely for the purpose of recruiting

safecrackers and burglars.

Paragraph 4 of this memo refers to

some ZRRIFLE authorization paper:

"I have already given you

the ZRRIFLE authorization paper signed by Helms and Skip has

been given QJWIN contract, including the extension to 1

March 1963."

An attachment to this memorandum gives details

on two possible candidates for burglary and safecracking. In

this attachment there are two references, however, which

may

be somewhat disturbing:

One candidate is stated to be "willing

to use gun"; the second "wanted to know if he should be armed

for job--ready to go to the end."

24. Immediately following a dispatch dated

December 7, 1962, from Luxembourg

to headquarters, there

appears in the files two pages of penciled notes on yellow

"buck-slip" type paper which are difficult to read but may

be relevant.

At the top of the first page appears the word

QJWIN.

On this page appears the following words, which are

barely legible:-""In 1961 by Bill H or Bissell used Arnold

astale lor Estate)direct action capability established ins

B [illegible] QJWIN Luxembourg principal prelim capability

for fourth country. QJWIN spotted three or four--moved to

Italy..."

25. Dispatch from Luxembourg to Headguarters Chief,

KUTUBE, dated February 14, 1964, indicates that JWIN has

been

terminated. Paragraph 1 reads in part, "QJWIN has been

terminated. "Rozeney told him on 21 April that the operation

in which he was to play a role had been shelved and therefore

his contract, which ran out on 29 February, was not renewed.

He was reassured that this action did not result from anything

he had done and his past cooperation was appreciated.

It was

mentioned as conceivable that the operation might have been

off and running if he had been able to establish his cover

last year."

Another file examined was

entitled "ZRRIFLE

Administrative/Financial"; it is a long manila-type file.

The following items of possible interest were noted in this

file:

1. Memorandum dated January 11, 1961, to the Finance

Division from

William K. Harvey, Chief FI/D deals with the

payments for Mankel's trip to Leopoldville.

Paragraph 2 of

this memo states, "In order to avoid any misunderstanding,

completed. Although future use of QJWIN is not precluded, it

was not deemed fitting during this one use of him to enter

into a continuing contractual relationship or to have him sign

any memorandum of understanding."

2: Memorandum, dated January 31, 1961, for Chief,

Accounts Branch, Finance Division, from Justin E. O'Donnell,

Subject: Payments to QJWIN.

Paragraph 1 of this memorandum reads

as follows:

"QWIN was recruited in Frankfurt 1 November 1960

to undertake a one-shot mission to the Belgian Congo. Because

the mission potentially involved great personal risk to him

and he was obliged to separate himself from his business affairs,

it was agreed orally by this writer with QJWIN that his com-

pensation would be at the rate of $1,000 per month, plus his

expenses, for a period of not less than one month and not more

These two financial memoranda, numbers l and

2 here, seem to indicate a one-shot purpose for QJWIN in con-

nection with a Congo operation, which seems inconsistent with

many of the papers in the operational file reviewed above,

which indicated an ongoing relationship with JWIN for the

purposes of recruiting safecrackers and burglars. These

Ilnancial memoranda are certainly quite consistent with a plan

to use QuWIN for a one-shot assassination attempt in the

Belgian Congo. It is unclear that merely recruiting safe-

crackers and burglars or even performing safecracking and

burglary missions, would have involved "potential great

personal risk" to

QJWIN.

3. Memorandum, dated March 24, 1961, for Cable

Secretariat from William K. Harvey, Chief, FI/Division D,

subject:

"Distribution of ZRRIFLE Traffic."

Paragraph 1

of this memorandum reads, "Two copies of all cables bearing

the RRIFLE indicator are to be delivered in a sealed envelope

, ';

directly to Chief, FI/Division D, 1502 L Building. No other

distribution is to be made without the specific approval in

each instance of the Chief, FI/D."

Paragraph 2 reads, "The

above has been personally approved by the Deputy Director

(Plans)."

I question whether such close handling of cable

traffic

is not unusual even in a case involving safecracking

and burglary.

Perhaps Harvey intended traffic of more

sensitive issues to be passed

1 through the ZRRIFLE channel.

4.

In a large manila envelope filed immediately

after a dispatch to Luxembourg from the Chief, KUTUBE, dated

September 30, 1963, is a large manila envelope marked

"Documents in Receipt Supporting ZRRIFLE Activities."

Within

this envelope are several smaller manila envelopes, one of

which is entitled "ZRRIFLE, Receipts for Accounting Submitted

by WK Harvey, Receipt for Operational Phone Calls May 15, 1963."

Within this

envelope are two sheets of yellow legal size paper

which contain lists of operational expenses submitted by W.K.

Harvey covering the period April 13-21, 1963, all of which are

to be charged as operational expenses

to QJWIN/ ZRRIFLE.

These

expenses cover hotel expenses in Miami and Perine, Florida,

long distance hotel calls for these locations, plus $75 for a

boat chartered for operational purposes at Islamorada, Florida.

A hotel receipt indicates Harvey paid the bill of a Mr. John A.

Wallston of 56510 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles, California,

for the nights of April 17, 18, and 19, and a Miami hotel,

probably the Eden Roc.

These documents are the first indication

of any activities within the U.S. with respect to ZRRIFLE.

Apparently they did not involve JWIN but rather other

activity, perhaps directed at Cuba because of his location in

Miami.

Perhaps Harvey should be confronted with this listing

and asked to explain it.

A third file was examined, which was marked "ZRRIFLE- "

QJWIN Project/Contract. The following items of interest were

found:

1. A long memorandimwritten in ink' in longhand on sheets

of yellow, legal size paper at the very back of this file

entitled "Project ZRRIFLE." This is apparently justification

material submitted for the project.

The first portion of this

memorandum seems to end abruptly at the end of the second page:

perhaps the subsequent pages are missing.

These first to

pages portray the objective of ZRRIFLE to be that of pro-

curement of code and cipher materials by burglary and safe-

cracking.

However, subsequent pages, particularly the last

four legal size pages in this file, contain what appears to

be the outline of something which could be the establishment

of an "executive action capability," although these words are

not mentioned nor is the word "assassination."

A copy of these

pages should definitely be obtained.

Paragraph I of these

pages reads as follows,

subparagraph 3b reads:

Paragraph 3c reads as follows: "Max. security cable COMMO

sibility of one man overseas (Europe) control base with own

Paragraph

3f reads as follows, "No use of any agent

who ever worked for a U.S. government agency. Tracing by

opposition would reveal.". Paragraph 3i reads,

"Pretext:

D. Exclude organizations; e.g,

instability of purpose as criminals.

E. Staffers involved--

selection."

Paragraph 5 reads, "Cover:

include provision for blaming Soviets or Czechs in case of

blow. "

This seems to indicate ZRRIFLE is not limited to

burglary of embassies; how could you blame the soviets or

the Czechs for burglarizing their own embassies?] Paragraph

9 reads, "Should have phoney 201 in records to backstop this

Ireferring to blaming the Soviets or the Czechs], all documents

therein forged and backdated.

Should look like a CE' file."

Paragraph 11 reads, "Silverthorne."

of paper containing the following notation in penciled hand-

4. A memorandum dated June 27, 1963, for Chief,

Foreign Intelligence, from William K. Harvey, Subject: QJWIN.

This memo states that QJWIN is currently not being used for

any operational purposes.

It discusses whether or not he

shoula be retained as an agent.

Paragraph 2 seems to indicate

that the executive action portion of QWIN's project, if any,

has been terminated.

This paragraph reads:

"As far as the
