CONFIDENTIAL

In addition to the "category II" Items, there are

a nunber of additional subjects largely geographic in nature

for which the DCI feels CIA should assume responsibility

for preparing comprehensive papers.

In view of the

apparent adversary relationship between the Senate Select

Committee Staff and the agencies under investigation; it may

be that preparation of papers dealing comprehensively with

specific subjects will deflect some of this cross-agency

probing and

result in a positive solution to problems before

they arise.

The Chairman reminded the group of the responsibility

which exists to keep Mr. Cotter of the Post Office Department

Informed on matters resulting from the Congressional investiga-

tions which will clearly impact on his agency's affairs.

At

present, the cross-agency character of the interviews now

under way indicate a possible

communication gap in adequately

coordinating on postal matters.

• 6.

The Chairman explained the DCI's action taken in

late May to separate the responsibility for CIA's response

üu che congressional seitiu Commitees from chose responsi

bilities of the IC Staff. Both Dr. Clarke and Mr: Elder

emphasized the very close relationship which exists in the

two efforts.

Hoc sessions henceforth.]

7.

The Chairman questioned Mr. Elder, the CIA repre-

sentative, whether or not the Senate Select

Committee had

yet furnished the Agency with a list of subjects with which

they plan to deal in depth. Mr. Elder reported they have

not yet done so, but it is apparent that three items

priority interest at the moment:

assassinations, the Phoenix

program, and covert action; that it appears clear the Committee

Is currently pursuing the question of authorities, approvals,

and support from other agencies.

Copies of a memorandum which set forth the action

Items resulting from the Policy Steering Group session of

last week were provided. to the Ad Hoc members for their

information.

10.

Mr. Elder reported that the House Committee has

Indicated to CIA its intent to concentrate on specific

issues, but as of now are not adequately organized to be

specific in their requests. The one extant request forwarded

to the CIA was posing some problems because of the lack of

cleared personnel, approved storage facilities, and determina-

tions on the ultimate disposition of records.. The Chairman

noted that concurrent with this meeting, a meeting of Community

legal representatives was taking place with the purpose of

commenting on the House Select Committee's proposed security

regulations which have not yet been adopted.

11. LCIA reported its success with the provision of

reading room for SS Staff at CIA headquarters] State

reported there were no comparable facilities anticipated

there.

Defense has provided badges to Staff members and

reading facilities are available.

The same accessability of

materials is true at NSA and FBI.

12. The last subject on the agenda was the implementa-

tion of

the Community Central Index.

In the material provided

group was a letter reaffirming the purposes of the

Central Index and a list of 40 key words to be used in

identifying material furnished the Index.

A printout of the

Index content was provided to the group as a review document

only. The final format of such periodic reports has not yet

been refined.

Group members are encouraged to comment if

they

detect any problems with items in the printout..

for inputting information to the Central Index were also

provided to the Group.

This is a service of common concern

which will assure the uniformity of information received and

should serve to lighten the workload of the individual

agencies.

The telephone number of Mrs. Young of the Central

Index was provided for agencies' convenience in accessing

the Index information:

This records the results of contact with Central

Committee (SSC) of two documents pertaining to Appendix C,

Paragraph 24 of the sSC request to the Department of 5/14/75,

which requested "all memoranda and other materials reflecting

conversations, contacts or communications between the FBI and

the CIA on the subject of the establishment or creation of

'notional' Marxist-leninist organizations withinthe United States.*

No information has been developed indicating this Bureau

conferred with CIA regarding the establishment or creation of a

Bureau-sponsored "notional" Marxist-Leninist organization.

Although the FBI did, in fact, direct several such organizations,

no information has been developed indicating the FBI consulted

with CIA regarding their establishment or creation.

In one instance,

CIA advised in 2/70 it had established

a notional organization with post office box aadresses in Boston

Massachusetts and Philadelphia, Pennsivania.

This notional

organization, to be known as the Union for the Revolution, ha

the objective of developing penetrations and/or sources in

revolutionary Arab groups in the Middle East. It was CIA's

intention to circulate propaganda from the post office boxes in

anticipation of interesting Arab groups.

Thereafter, it was

CIA's plan to use its personnel under "suitable" cover to

contact the Arab groups.

Appendix C, I, 24

Please provide: all memoranda and other materials

reflecting conversations, contacts, or communications between the

FBI and the CIA on the subject of the establishment or creation of

"notional" Marxist-Leninist organizations within the United States.

No information has been developed indicating this Bureau

conferred with CIA regarding the establishment or creation of a Bureau-

sponsored "notional" Marxist-Leninist organization. Although the FBI

dia, in fact, direct,

several such organizations, no information has been

developed indicating the FBI consulted with CIA regarding their

establishment or creation.

In one instance, CIA advised in 2/70 it had established

a notional organization with post office box addresses in Boston,

Massachusetts, and Philadelphia, Peonsylvania. This notional organization,

to be known as the Union for the Revolution, had the objective of developing

penetrations and/or sources in revolutionary Arab groups in the Middle

Fast.". It was CIA's intention to circulate propaganda from the post office

boxes in anticipation of interesting Arab groups. Thereafter, it was

CIA's plan to use its personnel under "suitable" cover to contact the

Arab groups. (See memorandum dated 2/13/70 captioned "Union for the

Revolution, " 100-456409-2, copy attached.)

By letterhead memorandum dated 3/23/70, the FBI

indicated information had been received indicating the Union for the

Revolution had been in contact with a domestic Marxist-Leninist organization -

requesting literature. This memorandum set forth an analysis of a

"Statement of the Union for the Revolution" indicating the document lacked

credibility as a revolutionary document. (LHM dated 3/23/70 captioned

"Union for the Revolution, " 100-456409-4, copy attached. )

LAs the Union for the Revolution was strictly a creation of

CIA, it is recommended before any information be disseminated outside

the FBI relating to this organization, clearance be obtained through CIA.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams

Re: Senate Select Committee

reason and for the reason that the Director desired to be cooperative with

the Committee, we would request a meeting with Senator Church and

Senator Tower to arrive at an understanding as to procedures. I told

Mr. O'Connor that I would consider such a letter ana/he would discuss

the matter with the Deputy Attorney General and with James Wilderotter

at the White House.

At approximately 9:05 a.m. on May 23, 1975, Mr. O'Connor

called me and said that he had discussed the matter with Mr. Wilderotter

and the Deputy Attorey General. He said that both had agreed that it was

inopportune at this time to seek special guidelines for irt erviews of FBI

personnel and former personnel with the Committee. He said that a meeting

has been scheduled for Tuesday, May 27, 1975, at noon in a final

eitort to resolve an understanding with Committee representatives. He

said at the present time it is proposed that the meeting be attended by

Wilderotter and Roderick Hills, representing the White House; Hoffman, A*

representing the Defense Department; Warner, representing CIA; and

O'Connor representing the Justice Department.

Committee representatives

would be Schwarz, Chief Counsel, and John Elliff. He said that at this

time it was his thought that the Deputy Attorney General and I should not

attend the meeting.

He gave as his reasoning the thought that "should

something go wrong" the Deputy Attorney General could disassociate himself

from any agreement arrived at, and that I would similarly be in a position

of saying that we have not been a party to the agreement.

I reminded Mr. O'Connor that meetings have been held frequently

in the past and that tentative understandings made at such meetings have dis-

appeared shortly after the meeting was concluded. I told him that was

significant to us because we now understand that two more former

employees of the FBI have been contacted and may be interviewed in the

near future. I told him that former SA Sam Papich and former Agent Nichols

have been contacted. I told him that the extent to which we should release

these two former employees from their obligation of secrecy could not be

intelligently evaluated unless we.: knew the subject matter of the interviews

and that we plan to contact the Committee to inquire as to the subject

matter. I pointed out to him that such pending interviews make it imperative

for the FBI to consider action in addition to meetings that may be planned

to discuss guidelines.
