but the truth, so help you God?

MI. Tweedy. I do.

MI.Baron. Mr. Tweody, are you aware that you have

the right to counsel here today?

Mr. Tweedy.

I am.

Mr. Baron.

And are you appearing voluntarily here

today without counsel?

Mr. Tweedy. I am.

(At this point, the hearing was removed to room 608,

Carroll Arms Hlotel.)

Mir. Baron.

Are you also aware that all of your

constitutional rights are intact before the Committee, Includ-

ing your Fifth Amendment rights?

Mr. Tweedy. I am.

Mr.. Baron. Mr. Tweedy, are you aware that you have

Are you willing to do so?

Mr. Tweedy.

I have no intention of not cooperating.

Mr. Baron. And you are willing to continue to testify

to the truth as best you can?

Mr. Tweedy. Indeed I will.

MI. Baron.

Perhaps we should begin by putting on the

record a bit of your background in Agency activities leading

to the point at which you assumed the position as Chief of

the African Division.

TESTIMONY OF BRONSON TWEEDY

Me. Tweedly.

I come aborad the Agency in the first o:

May, 1347 and after training was sent to switzerland.

returned in 1950 and did a series of desk jobs

in what was karin

as the Central European Division, I quess, and went through

a number of different assignments at that time, until say?

15-14

0f 1953 when I went out as Chief of station to Vernadostria

I was there until the middle of 195g and returned very

15+1

briefly to the sentes, went to tondo as Deputy chief of

Station there. I took over as Chief of Station there in the

middle of 1958 and was then replaced by Frank Wisner, in

15-1

Conlon, early in October 1959, and I took over the

African Division I should think somewhere around between the

15ch and 18th of lovember 1959.

That brings me up to date.

Mr. Baron. And how long did you sorve as Chie fof

the African Division?

MI. Tweedy, Until september of '63.

MI. Baron. In that pogition did you consult frequent

with people in policy-making positions at the State Department?

- MI. Tweedy.

Well, as I was explaining to you as we

were strolling around, the aimple answer to that is yes.

These consultations would take many, many different forms.

On the Congo, for example, the State Napartment

obviously was just

as involved as praculeally the rest of the

U.s. Government and they

had a Congolear: task force.

would attend their meetings or a representative of mine would

attend their meetings.

They took place almost daily,

sometimes I guess even

more than once daily.

MI. Baron. During what period of time?

Mr. Tweedy.

oh, boid, from the time the congo thin;

really hotted up, and I am talking

then varticularly

under thin

Kennedy Administration, when Mionnon Williams organized the

tast. force and Wayne Fredericks was

his deputy; thosc meer-

ings were State's

meetings, they weren't CiA mortings, thri

weren's nectings primarily to discuss the CiA policy, but

No had to be there to maintain, to keep abreast of what the

policy was.

Mr. Baron. If we could focus our attention on the

period hotween the indopondence of the Congo in June of '60

and the announg prop stickEt" Luminba in february of '1.

Mr. Tweedy.

Whe that the month of his death?

Mr. Baron.

The month the death was announced.

As you know, there is a lot of mystery surrounding his

death and the probable cause of his death. AS far as the U.".

Investigation was concerned it was January 17 or perhaps

January 18, 1961.

Mr. Tweedy. Yes.

MI. Baron.

What was the nature of your contact with

the State Department during that period of time?

MI. Tweedy, My recollection of thin

is far less

Congo and far more gencral, is I was mentoning to you as

we strolled, and

particularly my talks with Jim Penfield, tr.

whom Joe Satterswate was

dedicated.

Toe Satterswate, who was Assistant Secretary for

African Mifairs, and

Penfield and

were colleagues in Vienn

together. He had the minister.

But we did a great deal c

talking together about CIA deployment in Africa. I was

professional contact with MI. Merchant. I knew him mostly

alightly socially.

MI. BaIon. When you met regularly with Mi. Satterawate

or MI. Penfield did you discugs Lumumba with them?

ME. Tweedy. I am sure we discussed Lumumba in the

sense of which would be all the time, assessing the situa-

tion, assessing where Lumumba was heading, where the Congo

was heading. I did this with, you know, alnost all of the

African situations, Individual African country situations.

We would spend a great deal of time, their pointa of

view, our point of view, cu: perspective, their perspective,

but never as an action matter that I can recall.

Mr. Baron. Was the assassination of Patrice Lumumba

ever contemplated or raised in those meetings?

Mr. Tweedy. Never.

MI. Baron. Did you meet regularly in this period

between Congolese independence and the announced death of

Lumumba w1th people at the NSC level or people in the white

House?

MI. Tweedy.

I don't recall so at all. For example, i!

President Eisenhower had an African representative the same

way President Kennedy later had, then I can't recall who he

was.

President Kennedy had two. The first name escapes

me. He later went on down to South Africa as Ambassador

Administration when eventa in Congo wore heatingup, after

Congolese Independence, what was the goneral atmosphere in

the State Department and at the CIA in relation to Lumumba,

the general attitude toward Lumumba?

MI. Ireedy. Well, I think you would have to start by

saying what was the general assessment of the situation in

the congo. Lunumba was really sort of the last thing you

came down to.

The worry in WAshington about the situation in the

Congo was that here was the largest geographical expression

In Africa that thretened to go up in amore, up because the

Kremlin was about to march in and take it over, not because

it was about to break up tribally and do all the things that

those African countries in their early yoars were at least

vulnerable to.

The only trouble with the congo was if it

happened there the side effects would have been infinitely

greater than, of course, if it had happened

anywhere else.

Mr. Baron.

What would

those side effects have been?

Mr. Tweedy.

All one culd do was assess those, but it

would have set a precedent, for example, the neighboring

country by which great store was set by the west wag Nigeria

and if the game infection crossed

that border one was afraid

that this would go up in smoke and that in effect there

was a possibility of the continent disintegrating before it

really had had a chance to get under way under its own aegis.

This was the concein.

Mr. Baron. Wero these political side effects only

that were being taken into account or vere thera also

fears for American business interests in the Congo that

5

were part of the side effects?

MI. Tweedy, Insolar as my assesamenta were concerned,

and those of the Agency and any conversations I can recall

with the State Department, American business was juat not a

great factor.

1C

If you want to talk about business, the big factor, of

course, was Katanga and eventually when Tachombe threatened to

succood resulting in tha grans anvolvanant of both the u.No anl

the U.S. In the congo altair, the lear there was that 11 you

put together the Congo without Katanga It was like construct-

ing a Cadillac and purposely omitting the gas station.

Mr. Baron.

That is because

Kutanga is the home of

most of the natural resources that are

In the Congo.

Mr. Tweedy. That is the only thing that keeps that

country going.

Now, I don't say there weren't a lot of economic con-

siderations in back of that but these vere political

stability in Africa.

MI. Tweody, Yes, political stability in Africa.

In

a quick phrase you put your foot right on that.

Mr. Dawson.

During the summer of 1960 you mentioned

earlier that in the time frame you did not think the

Kremlin was ready to march in there, as that was a fear with

you but -

Mr. Tweedy.

I don't mean to say this was nothing that

anybody was worred about but it was not the primary concern.

Mr. Dawson. But there was significant soviet interest

In infiltrating and taking advantago of the situation in the

Congo?

MI. Tweedy, I think it would be much more accurate

to say it was our assumption, we were not privy to soviet

intentiona with respect to Africa, which I suspect in those

¿days like a great many other things about African culture

round the globe were ill informed at that point, and un-

doubtedly secking their own polcies in Africa just the way this

country was. It was obviously a worry.

МІ. вагоп. .

Was it also our assumption if the Soviets

moved into the Congo they would move on the side of Lumumba?

MI. Tweedy. Oh, yes, I think there would have been

little doubt in our

minds that that would have been the case.

MI. Baron, And is it also true that the general perception

at the Agency and in the State Department was that Lumumba

posed the threat in the congo beyond the mere threat of

political instability because of his closeness to the Soviets

or his willingness to accept aid from the Sovlets?

Mr. Tweedy. It made the cheese mora binding but I

don't think we had any Information indicating there was

any close umbilicus between the Soviets and Lumumba but it

was potentlally there.

Mr. Baron. And that potential -

MI. Tweedy. Thia increased one's nervousneas about the

situation.

Mr. Baron. In your capacity as Chief of che African

Division to whom did you report and from whom did you receive

orders?

Mr. Tweedy, Well, the normal chain of command was

through DDD, Dick Rissell and --

MI. Baron. Hould you meet regularly with Richard

Bissell during this period of time?

Mr. Tweedy.

Regularly would be a big word.

Not

necessarily that often.

We might talk on the phone. To

say that I saw him all the time, how often I don't know. It

would go in fits and starts, undoubtedly but

Mr. Baron. In formulating actions to be taken in the

congo, would you consult with Bissell before you undertook

any major operatlon.

MI. Tweedy.

major operation. Major operation per so, if you are not

talking about juat intelligenco operations, call for in-

structions and formalization elther inside the Agency or out-

side.

Мг. Ватол. .

So any major covert action would be

formulated in consultation not only with Bissell but with the :

DCI, Allen Dulles at that time, and probably higher levels

than that.

Mr. Tweody.

I suppose the DCI, 1f Bissell felt that

was necessary, and, of course, he used to talk to the

DCI without my being present, and undoubtedly certain instruc-

tions i would receive from time to time undoubtedly stem from

conversations that Bissell would have had with the DCI and

funnelled down to me.

I didn't always know who talked to whom before I re-

ceived instructions.

MI. Baron. So if you received an instruction from

Richard Hissell as DDP you would proceed to implement that

instruction on the asgumption

it was fully authorized above

the level of DDP?

MI. Tweedy. I think I would proceed with it on the

basis that he was authorized to give me instructions

and it was up to him to bloody well know what he was empowered

to tell me to do.

I couldn't run his affnirg for him to that extent, but

by and large I recton the Agency worked and that was the way

It was set up to work and that is the way it worked, but to

say every time Bissell talked to me he always talked to

Allen Dulles firat I would think is nonsense.

MI, Baron. You didn't consider it your duty to question

Bissell about the source of authority for some covert: action

he was asking you to undertake?

MI. Tweedy.

I would have never hesitated to do if

I felt that lt was necessary to do so.

I can't recall having done so.

He and I used to have

aisagreements philosophically on operations. We were very

good friends and I never had any hesitation about telling him

i when I thought he didn't make any sense but --

MI. Dawson. Could you describe that philosophical

difference, or is it describable?

MI. Tweedy. Well it varied a lot. I think Dick was

by and large inclined to feel that almost anything

was

possible, you know, in the clandestine service, if they put

their minds to it, and my view was this wasn't the case.

Mr. Dawson.

Thank you.

• Mr. Baron.

Did you ever discuss the question of

assassinating bumumba with Richard Bissell?

MI. Tweedy. Yes, this was the way the whole thing

came up in the flist instance.

I can't remember how it came

up except undoubtedly we had a conversation,

MI. Baron. Do you recall when it came up?

Mr. Tweady,

No, I don't. It obviously must have

come up, i assume, what, the fall of 1960. But I have no

way of putting a date to it.

MI. Baron. And what was said during that discussion or

perhaps I should backtrack firgt and ask whether this was one

discussion or a series of discussions?

Mr. Tweedy. Oh, we must have diacussed it more than

once.

I chink it came up in the sense that Dick would have

said we probably better be thinking about whether it might

Mr. Baron.

Do it, meaning carry off an assassination?

Mit. Tweedy. Yes, but it was never discussed with him

in any other

sense but a planning exercise, but a planning

exercise which, in other words, never were we instructed

to do anything of this kind. "We were

instructed to agk whether

such a thing would be feasible and to have the Chief of

:

Station be thinking along those lines as well.

Mr. Baron. So, in effect you were asked to move

ahead at least as far as developing the capability to

Mr. Tweedy. Well, or to examine the potential for

doing that.

Mr. Dawson.

I know that you have indicated you

won't be able to put a precise date to this conversation

with Bissell

or conversations with Blssell, but maybe ve can

naTIOw it down a littlo bit.

Would you assume that it would be after the proclama-

tion of the Congolese Independence on June 30, 1960?

Mr. Tweedy, Oh, yes.

Mr. Dawson. Hould you assume it would be before

Lumumba's being put into U.N. protective custody on

September15, 19607

MI. Tweedy. I think it must have been, yes. I

didn't realize he had gone into custody that early.

Mr. Baron.

so then it would

be sometime during the

summer or early fall of '60?

MI. Tweedy, What happened to Lunumba after that?

MI. Baron.

He was in protective custody at the United

Nations force from mid-September until late November and

it was in late November that he left to. go traveling

towards Stanleyville and he was captured by Mobutu's troops

at that point in very early December and from early December

until mid-January he was in the custody of the Congolese in

prison and then it was in mid-January 1961 that he was

flown from a prison in Tysville to Katanga where his death

was announced shortly thereafter.

Mr. Baron. When you say "after" -.

MI. Tweedy,

After you put September 15 the day ho

came under. The only

thing is I have no recollection that

it would have happened as early as, say, darly August or

early September.

MI, Baron. It was In August or carly September that

Lumumba was Premier of the Congo?

MI. Tweedy.

Yes.

botween Lumumba and Kasavubu going on.

MI. Dawson.

I guess. the crucial question.

Mr. Tweedy, You

have really got me at this point.

Mr. Dawson. It would be whether of not you would have

considered the plan had he been in U.N. protective custody.

If you assume that would be the case, then I don't think

any more precision in the date would necessarily be productive.

MI. Treedy. My whole recollection of the thing would

be that only purpose of the exercise would have been to have

a plan when he was in nobody's custody.

Mr. Baron. That would have been before --

MI. Tweedy. That is the only thing that makes sense

to me, September, because -

Mr. Baron. Well, I will go on.

MI. Tweedy. In retrospect nothing makes sense to me

Mr. Daron, -- that this initial conalderation of the

feasibility of the assassination of Lumumba between Bigsell

and yourself?

MI. Tweedy. I should have thought that would have

been during the period!

when

he was in effect in power. I

should have thought, but the record may prove me wrong.

Mr. Baron.

Did you have any discussion with Bissell

where he indicated that his own consideration of the assassina-

tion of Lumumba had moved beyond the realm of

possibility to

an actual plan that he was prepared to carry out or taking

stepa to carry out.

Mr. Tweedy.

I cannot recall a conversation with

Bissoll where in effect he said, lat's move from A to B or c

to D or something like this. I do not rocall that. My

recollection of the whole interval when this was under con-

sideration was that

would say go, (a) we never came up with a plan that was

always my assumption that at the time anything like this should

occur there would have been some kind of real focus on the

problem at probably a very conaiderable policy level within

the Agency at which somebody would have said something

more about it and it never occurred to me I would get a call

or Biasell would ask me to come down to his office and say

go to it.

Nor were we ever in position where he said that I would

merely implement plan so-and-so.

We never got that

fat.

Mr. Baron.

You didn't have any action plane for

assassination of Lumumba that you had prepared or were aware

Mr. Tweedy. No. Planning, yes, but nothing that ever

got anywhere.

Мг. Baron.

What kind of planning was done?

Mr, Tweedy. It was mostly the kind of thing where one

asked the Chief of Station to keep in mind what sort of

accers onr might cher have

lied to lumumba

sor whatever purpose.

It was this kind of thing, as best i recollect.

MI. Baron. Did you send cables raiging the question of

gaining access to Lumumba for the purpose of assassinating

him?

It would be up to the Chief of Station

what was in the cable and the degree to which he felt he

needed to maintain a record for quick reference purposes in

the future.

But, he was perfectly capable of keeping a file

which would be accessable only to him and the station and

if he was sure of his own

It was a serlous ansver. It wasn't argu-

cons of policy, at least I don't recall it did, but what it

¿was that ha might be able to do. It was a disciplined reply

MI. Baron.

he had of gaining access to Lumumba?

Mr. Twoody.

At the time that you were requesting the

Chief of Station to report back on means of gaining access

to Lumumba for the purpose of eliminating him, was this

access made any more explicit in terms of the kind of

personal access that would be needed?

MI. Tweedy, I am sure that must have been covered

at some point, i.e., in perhaps a series of types of accesses.

MI. Baron. Hould this be access to shoot him or would

this be access to his personal food or drink or toiletries?

Mr. Tweedy, I suppose all those types of things might

have been considered.

Mi. Baron. But this was not access in the sense of -

In your discussiona with Richard Bissell

off Lumumba, not in those words.

Mr. Baron. When you say examine the thing on the ground

you mean he would send O'Donnell to the Congo to take a

firat-hand look at the means?

MI. Tweedy. Yes, conceivably I suppose this all

might have resulted in a climax there but at loaat my recollec-

tion certainly was never that he told me that I am sending

¿ Donnell, to the congo to knock off Lumumbe in those worde

but that he, I am sure the philosophy was that if anything

was done you would want to keep it as separate from the

station as possible and thus a man from the outaide.

It was Bissell's idea that Quonnell might be the man.

Mr. Baron. The man from outside?

MI. Tweedy. Outside the station.

Mr. Baron.

The CIA station in the Congo?

Mr. Tweedy. Right.

Mr. Baron. That such a man would be necessary to

carry out an asgasgination operation if one were to be mounted?

MI. Tweedy.

That if one was mounted it would

obviously be desirable to do it under auspices which would

protect the security of the station or involvement of the

station.

that he was using it and going around me, no. But that he

did, but he might have done it, I wouldn't gainsay 1t, he

certainly had the right and capability to go into it.

MI. Dawson, Can wo go into how the right was able to be

exercised?

MI. Tweedy. All he had to do was send a cable. He

could establish his own channel to Leopolduille with his own

set of slugs which would exclude the Chief of African Division.

He has the right to do that.

Mr. Baron.

It would not be improper for a DDP to send

a cable or messenger to the Chief of Station in another

country?

MI. Iweedy. I wouldn't comment on the approprlateness.

He obvlously had the authority. My relationahipa with

Bissell were such that I do not belleve it.

they would have been sent through the pouch with the whole

the Chief of Station although he did say that he was not anxious

practical or wise and he probably would have gone back

to headquarters to congult with them if he thought he

was in a position to move immediately to carry out the asgass-

Ination plan, but it was his opinion that the polloy decision

had been made and that he had authority to move ahead

although he doubted

MI. Tweedy. My recollection doesn't go

that far.

cabling back to headquarters saying, this guy has made himself

me, bocause once again I would be very surprised, I wouldn't

were in more narrow cryptic terms, for instance, 1! it had

said aimply I have seen your messenger and received instruc-

confirmation for such a sensitive operation would be requested?

MI. Iweedy. I don't know because I never saw one be-

This

1s the way, this would be

the way I should have thought any

wasn't the case.

here as someone experienced.

Mr. Dawson. You had been the person responsible dor

promoting this Chief of Station or at least appoliting him

Mr. Tweedy. That in actual fact isn't true. His

appointent was already in the works when I came aboard and

I had met Hedgman in London on his previous assignment which,

1f I remember correctly, wag in Brussels and he

came to lon-

don to discuss an operational matter with me which had

nothing whatsoever to do with that and we had a very good

discussion. It was only, I think, when I yot back to

headquarters as it were, took up the reins after the division

that

I learned that he had been appointed Chief of Station

in the Congo, a decision with which I took absolutely no

exception whatsoever, but as a number of aggignments may be

Мг. Baron. But, because the feasibility of this

assassination of Lumumba had been discussed, this was not such

a tightly held subject that the DDP would have been circum-

vented?

Mr. Tweedy. DDP as far as I was concerned was the

person with whom the division first discussed the matter an-

tirely. I don't recall ever having discussed it with Allen

Dulles. I am aure when I say I am sure I assumo Biggell dis-

cussed it with Allen Dulles but, this was never a matter

which was between the DCl's office and the Leopoldville

station insofar as I was awarc, and to this day I don't

believe it ever was.

Mr. Baron. Just to clarify something we talked about

earlier when I think we were jumbling two questions together,

it is your expert opinion, expert in the sense of your knowl-

edge of the Agency, and your opinion as a participant at that

time that the testimony, the basic testimony we have received

instructions to use them in the assassination of Lumumba.

MI. Tweedy. Only way I can answer that question, Mr.

belleve that you would have been lied to on this point.

Mr. Baron. We have receivod testimony from the Chief

Rome to meet with Richard Bissell and he belives that he also

met with yourself and Mr. Karamessines at Mr. Karamessines'

house.

Mr. Tweedy. I doubt if he saw Mi. Karamessines.

It

would only be because Mr. Karamessinco was host

But I am sure he was not discussing any

policy problems with MI. Karamessincs who had absolutely no

jurisdiction over them in those days whatsoever.

but if, as he has testified, that he met with MI. Bissell and

yourself, you wouldn't dispute that testimony?

Mr. Tweedy, Absolutely not.

Mr. Baron. And that would be due to the intenaity of

was the main Isason that I am sure I went to the Congo

at that point was the fact that 1t obviously was going to become

a major personnel drain, 1f you like, on the Division

and a major commitment both at headquarters and in the

fleld, thus it was important I sort of look the thing over.

MI. Baron. Having refreshed your recollection about

this moeting between the Chief of Station and Mr. Bissell and

yourself in Rome, do you recall what was discussed when you

were together?

MI. Tweedy.

I can only assume that some of the things

that we discussed by cable traffic were diacussed.

The other thing I am

sure must have been discussed was

what I would call the general

assessment of the Congolese

situation and what the station might be required to do, thus

the soit of support headquarters was going to have

to give

the Station.

of Lumumba or the prospect of --

Lumumba was actually dead?

MI. Tweedy, I don't recall. You probably are much more

Mr. Baron.

MI. Tweedy. If 1t was still on, it was atill on

off the agenda then no, but I honestly don'e remember.

Mr. Baron. Let me show you now some cable tinffic

series of cables

that begins shortly before Lumumba was placed

into U.N. custody, then continues after he wag placed in U.N.

Mr. Tweedy. Correct. As I said, he might not have

drafted it but it certainly would have been his sign off.

Mr. Baron.

And let me direct your attention to

the portion of the cable that says in high quarters here it is

the clear-cut conclusion that if lll continues to hold high

This containa referancos to the faet that

"the station wa flooded with reports te outcony Mobutu coup".

And the cable goes on to discuss the fact that U.N.

troops had interferred with Congolose troopa and prevented

them from arresting Lumumba.

Now, this cable was sent to the CIA headquarters

from Leopoldville one day after Lumumba sought protective

custody from the United Nationa and two days after the lobutu

coup where Mobutu took over the government.

In the cable as it has been sandelzad by the Agency

it now reads:

"Station advised two moderate Congolose politician

try work with key Congolese contact in elfort eliminate

Lumumba, Fear U.N. protection will give Lumumba opportunity

to organize counterattack. Only solution is remove him

from scene soonest*.

WAs that the attitude of the Agency at this point,

as far as you understood it, that the fact that bumumba

was in U.N, protective custody did not eliminate him as a

threat in the Congo?

MI. Tweedy, I don't really recall but I think the

chances are that we feared that U.N. protective custody

might very well result in his early release or his ability sui:

to control matters. I should think that is very probable.

MI. Baron. Back on the record.

Although the top of this cable does not indicate where

the cable was sent to and from, because we don't have the

cover sheet for the cable, you have indicated to me by looking

at the designations that this cable must have been sent from

Leopoldville to headguarters, in that correct, Mr. Treedy?

Mr. Treedy. That ie correct.

Mr. Baron. Let me direct your attention to paragraph

7 which aaya:

"Station checking recurring reports of Kasavubu Lumumba

reconcilation. Kanavubu denies Bolikango failed deny

possibility of Lumumba entering new government, possibly

as vice Premier. Believe some aubstance to rumor but will

do best prevent 1f Lumumba allowed even minor role he most ap:

come out on top".

Does that indicate to you that the Chief of Station

in the Congo at this point continued to be extremely concerned

that lumumba should not be allowed even a minor role in the

government of the Congo?

Mr. Tweedy, That is what it says.

Mr. Baron. Next, as Exhibit 4, we have a cable dated

who caused his death?

Mr. Tweedy. I must say I have a hard time following the

question.

This moans that Lumumba arrived under the Congo-

lese auspices in Rutanga and that Elizabothville, the bage di

Elizabethville didn't know he was coning, our base, didn't

know very much, didn't presumably know very much about what

occurred, and reported very briefly on what they had heard.

Mr. Baron. Let me put the question in context.

On January 17, Lumumba had been flown to Mutanga?

Mr. Tweedy. Yes.

Mr. Baron. And later United Nationa Investigationg co..

cluded that. 1t was the 17ch or perhapa the 18ch chat Lumumbo

was actually killed in Kucanga.

I was asking you before whether this cable would indi

cate that the United States would have been involved in

bringing about the death of Lumumba?

Mx. tweedy. I would have thought that it merely in-

dicates that this part of the Agency, 1.0., Elizabethuille

had no idea he was coming, knew nothing about his fate

except these few phrases that he put down here and would imp:

although it certainly doesn't say yo, that he was adding a

little information to what was perhaps an anormously ignoran:

Leopoldville which, of course,

is the fact of the matter.

We didn't know how all this was occurring and wore not able

to follow the event except after the event.

Mr. Baron. CIA was not involved in a plot to fly

Lumumba from hia previous place of imprisonment in tysville

out to lutanga where the authorities vere known to be so

hostile to him that he would probably neat his death there?

Mr. Tweedy, The fate of Lumumba in the end vas purely

an African event.

Mr. Baron, At what point did you laarn of Lumumba's

death?

Mr. Tweedy. I suspect probably about the time that the

world did. No one had a beat on this.

MI. Baron. You had so advanced warning that Mobutu in-

tended to fly Lumunba to Katanga?

MI. Tweedy. Not that I recall, and I am aure the cable

traffic would reflect it if I had.

MI. Baron. Mr. Tweedy, do you recall an asset who was

sent from Europe, where he had been recruited by nola 2S

MI. Tweedy. I think Iwas reminded of chis when I talked

Mr. Baron.

Here you aware that the CIA had a project

Mr. Tweedy, You mean just generically?

Mr. Baron. Yes.

MI. Tweedy. No.

Mr. Baron. Aside from the discussions that you had

with Richard Bissell about the feasibility of assassinating

Lumumba, did you participate in any other discussions at the

Agency about assassination capabilities?

Mr. Tweedy.

Never.

MI. Baron. Did you bring anyone else connacted with

the Agency into the discussion of the feasibility of

assassinating Lumumba, other than the Chief of Station in

Congo?

None at all. It doesn't ring a bell

to wosk for him and act as his general assistant.

Mr. Baron. That was the way Mr. ÖlDonnell described

1t, although in this lengthy mano which apparently precedes

the dispatch of QJWIN to the Congo there de no mention ofcMr.

CorDonnell.

MI. Tweody.

This I don't think

necessarily has anything

to do with(O'DonnElTy » minaton whatsoever. Thia, I think, in

generic mission, seems to indicate that he is going to

muck around with Coreicans. I don't recall Corsicans, I

know

dubonnell in the Congo at all.

Mr. Baron. Would this kind of dispatch have been

written by the Chief of Staff D without consultation with the

Chief of the African Division?

Mr. Tweedy. He did consult, that is to say, he wrote

the dispatch. I haven't read the whole thing but I gather

from thia - you see there is also a reference here. I don't

know what the reference 1a about. But I gather that Dakar is

brought into this activity because they wanted to act in a

support capacity to this

headquarters activity.

Me. Baron. You don't have any recollection of a mission

in Dakar Senegal about this time that headquarters was con-

cerned

with?

MI. Tweedy. No, I surely don't. On the contrary.

Mr. Baron. Mould it have been proper for the Chief of

Staff D to arrango an operation in the Congo directly without

going through

the African Division although keeeping the

African Chief informed?

MI. Tweedy.

Well, the two are mutually exclusive.

You can't have one without the othar. To anner your first

question, it would be guite improper and wouldn't have occurred

that the Chief of Staff D was operating in an African Station

without the African Division being informed. This, however,

makes it amply clear that that was not the case, the African

Division was informed. In what depth in terms of terma of

headquarters purposes I don't know but it would have been

sufficient for Harvey to have done what he did and coordinate

this with the Division and if the Division had perceived

any objection or saw any problems they would have raised it .

before the dispatch went out.

Also I noticed Dakar is also Invited to find problems

with this, st it did, and say so..:..

Mr. Baron. What kind of missions generally would

Staff D have been carrying out in Miriça at this time?

Mr. Tweedy. Hell, you know what the role of

Staff D was.

MI. Baron. Hould it be surprising to you that QJHIN might.

have been used in some manner in connection with an assassina-

tion plot against Lumumba and have been directed or supervised

by Nilliam Harvey without your knowledge?

Mr. Tweedy. It would have surprised me exceedingly and

would today. To put it differently, I am sure it didn't occur.

Mr. Baron. After reading this memo, you told me a

moment ago that you thought thin might indicate that OWIN

was being recruited for ZRRIFLE activitios.

MI. Tweedy.

Well, you mentloned IRRIFLE, which frankly

I hadn't heard before.

This sounda as if he was going to

have some kind of generic assignment. I merely put those

two together but I know nothing about it at all.

Mr. Baron, The dispatch says, "In view of the extrene

sensitivity of the objective for which we want him to perform

his task, he was not told precisely what we want him to do."

Do you have any knowledge of what it was preciaely that

OJHIN was asked to do?

MI. Tweedy. I do not.

MI. Baron. Then, on page 3 of the dispatch it says:

"The operation we have in mind is too sensitive

to risk blowing it in this phase and the search for assets

must be conducted with truly" . which is underscored --

"minimum risk".

MI. Tweedy. I don't recall that at all and don't recall

any aspect of the mission or its completion.

My best recollection is that In the long haul he stayed

somewhat useful intelligence source, but lledgman would

quite well his dispatch. He had been

of things in the Congo by Hedgman.

Mr. Baron. Would one of those things for which he was

qualified have been an assassination mission against Lumumba?

Mr. Tweedy. An I told you previoualy, told you and Mr.

Wides previoualy, absolutely not, for the simple reason he was

basically dispatched, asseased and dealt with by the balance

of the Division, not by me personally, Glenn Fielde person-

ally, and he was in elfect a station au set mounted by the

Division.

The Division knew nothing about the balance of this

thing.

MI, Baron. You are saying that Division porsonnel out-

Mr. Iweedy, I will put it differently, As far as

I know he was never considered for an assaasination mission

at all.

He thought he was presumably being sent ouf for deeds

of daring in the PM "lold and began to talk rather lusty when

he arrived, but I think he was soon put straighe.

Mr. Tweedy. Yes, I know that.

This la the one we dis-

cussed two months ago and this happens all the time.

MI. Baron.

We are referring specifically to WIN's

report that "HIROGUE had offered him $300 per month to par-

ticipate in intel net and be member".--I am sorry - "member

€ ¡ 'execution squad'".

Mr. Tweedy, Yes; I remember all of this as a result

of your having previoualy brought it to my attention and I

recall 1t, It was a typical example of an agont or asset

: full of plas and vinegar exceeding his brinf and he was

certainly put back on the track very early on.

But in this business do not confusr execution aquad

with anything to do with the assassination of Lumumbo or any-

thing else. It had nothing to do with that.

MI. Baron.

You are saying even

though you would

assume that Mr. Hedgman's testimony about poisons coming to

the Congo and instructions to carry out an assassination

coming to the Congo was true, the approach that NIROGUE made

to QJWIN was probably not a part of that mission.

Mr. Tweedy.

it was quite specifically not a part of

that mission. There was a chapter of accidents. You have

Again, why are you no sure that this would

not have been connected in any way to the assassination

misalon?

Mr. Tweedy.

I thought I made that clear because

this man want out up to a point through what I would call

¿ . the open channel, it was developed by the Division, giving

training by the Division and was sent out. This had nothing

to do whatsoever with the other thing and wouldn't have been

handled that way.

Mr. Baron. Could he have been instructed by Mr.

ledgman, after he got to the congo, that he was to underrate

recruitment of assets for participation in an assassination

mission as part of his general duties in the Congo?

Mr. Tweedy. It is purcly a speculative question.

He

could have been but Hedgman would also have been required

and would have told headquarters what he was doing with him.

That was

not the purpoge for his being

sent.

The purpose for

which he was sent out was unspecific at

the time, generally

in the PM field.

Mr. Baron. Did this icport cocate a flay at headquarters

an element of the Agency ao totally Involved in a matter which

clearly had the highest policy approval. I am not talking

"about Lumumba, I am talking about the congo.

Mr. Baron.

There was an extreme sense of urgency at

that time?

Mr. Tweedy.

Not only an extrone sense of urgency. +

the U.S. was supporting the U.l., the Agency was supporting

the U.S. Government, the U.S. Government requests. What the

Agency was doing was very closely coordinated appropriately

with any organs of government that need to be covered, mostl:

State, the White House.

I must say the Executive Department

was very much working as a team during these days. AGain for-

get Lumumba. I am now talking the whole Congo action. And

I never felt that anything we were doing was wandering off in-

to left field or that I didn't know

the white House wis

thinking about things, or the State Department was thinking
