2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

SUBJECT: Robert A. Mahou

MI. Robert A. Maheu was born on 30 October 1917 in

Haterville, Maine.

He graduated from Holy Cross College in 1940

and is narried with four children. Ho was employed as a

Speciel Agent with the FBI from 1940 to 1947, and upon re-

This ventura culminated

in bankruptcy in 1952. He then re-entered Government service

witis the Small Business Adninistration in liashington, D. C.,

and was appointed Special Assistant to the Administrator with

the specific duty of Director of Security. In February of

1954, he was forced to resign fron SBA because of political

reasons,

determined to be the result of backing the wrony

political party in the election. He then set up his own

investigative organization known as Robert A. Mahou Associates.

Mr. laneu was recruited by the Office of Security in

March of 1954. He was previously known to kir. Robert i.

Gunningham (deceased) who sas,

at that time, Chief, Special

Security Division, through their mutual employaent by the

FBI.

Cunninghan saw in Mahes a covert asset sho could be

utilized by the Office in extrenely sensitive cases. "iti

the approval of the Director of security, Subject was offered

a proposition wherein he was to receive $500.00 per monta,

with the stipulation that he nove into his on office and

that he he on call for any assignments by the Office of

Security. He agreed to this and innodiately took steps to

move out of his grea, where he rented desk space in a suite

occupied by Carnine S. Bellino, a forner PBI agent and CPA.

In July of 1954, Maheu was engaged by 'British shipping

interests" to check on Aristotle Onassis' activities while

in the United States.

aris trea

This included technical coveraga of

Onassis' New Yorl office. It was later learned that the

principal "British interos?" was Stavros Niarchus and that

the ultimate

this to rese

goal of this task was to scrap the Onassis/

Saudi oil doal. Maheu took the job but conditioned his

accaptance with the fact that he would do nothing ininical

to the li. S. Goverament.

Any infornation developed of interest

to the inited States was to be passed by liaheu to the appro-

priate fovernment azency.

During this operation Maheu had his staff prepare a

paper citing dangers to U.S. economy and trade resulting

fron the Onassis deal. Through contacts in FOA, Maheu

had Harold Stassen read this paper in the National Security

Council on 22 June 1954. During this same perica Maheu

briefed Scott McLeod, Assistant Secretary of State for

Security and Consular Affairs on the project.

to Join Foster Dulles' approval. Additionally, Maneu

briefed J. Edgar Hoover and Vice President Nixon.

tionship with Niarchus.

is a result of the Onassis Niarchus matter, and as a result

of Niarchus claining Governnent privilege in the case, the

Agoncy was subsequently identified as being the Government

agency involved.

Files of this Office reflect extensive

correspondence furnished us by the Office of General Counsel

in 1956 regarding the Onassis matter.

On 16 August 1954 Subject was granted a covert security.

clearance for utilization as an agent under Project TWIXT

in the Near East.

On 30 August 1954 he was granted a sinilar

clearanco to permit his use in the United States as a covert

associate under Project LPHIDDEN. In November of 1957, a

cable fron Ciudad Trujillo indicated that Mr. Maheu had

allegedly been involved in a violation of tha Name Act in

procuring and transporting prostitutes

during Sukarno's state visit to the United States in 1956.

NI. Maneu contacted this Office to advise that the allegations

were without foundation and stated that he would take steps

immediately to have his attorney see that appropriate

Dominican officials would retract the charges.

This was

subsequently done.

Edward Bennett Willians acted as Maheu's

In this matter.

In 1957 information was raceived indicating that during

President Sukarno's visit to Moscow in the fall of 1950, he was

Introduced to a soviet woman within the Kremlin. He had

an affair with

her against the adnonitions of his advisers.

It was reported

that the Soviets took detailed filns of the

Al Ulmer and Sanuel Halpern, FE Division, contacted the

Director of Security and outlined a project wherein they .

envisioned a filn being made sinulating this affair. It

was planned that clips frow this filn would be inseriod in

a leaflet for distribution throughout Southeast Asia sug-

gesting that Sukarno was compromised by the Soviets. In

July of 1957, Robert Mahen was given this assignnent. He

utilized a trusted male employee of this organization (since

deceased) and his fiancs.

Maheu after an intensive nake-up

course, auninistered the nate-up to the participants himself,

utilizing available pictures and descriptions of the subjects

as a guide. He hired a studio where he was given detailed

instruction on

the use of the lights and canera. imen the

film was taken, only Haheu and the

two participants were in

the studio.

The project known as "Happy Days," as never

copleted and the film was not distributed..

Files of this Office reflect that during the 1955-1959

period, FE Division was put in touch with saheu by this

Office

for assistance in another operation relating to

President Sanarno.

This project was orizinated in May 1258

Men PE Division initially contacted the Director of Security

and briefed his on the project known as HARPSIAR. Basically,

phone call on 12 April 1961 when she called on 1 sterile line

She advised

that one wo

men had asked her to give a

party for President Sukarno who would be in Los Angeles on

21 April 1951. miles wanted to know whether the Agency was

interested in sponsoring this party. A negative response

was given.

In june of 1959, a covert security approval wes issued

for the use of Mahen

by I0 Division in ordor for hin to be

approached and advised of Agency interest in Interuational

LabOr.

Files of this office do not refleci whether or noi

this was done.

On: 7 October 1959 a covert security approval

was granted for Mir. Maneu's use in the United States. The

request for approval indicated that Subject might be employed

by the

King of Jordan to handle Jordanian public relations in

the United States.

Mr. Maheu's later involvenent in the pIo-

curenent of feninine companionship for King Hussein during

the latter's state visit to the United States, is set forch

In August of 1969, Richard M. Bissell, the then DD/P

contacted the Director

of Security regarding the Roselli

In 1960 information was received by the Agency indicating

that the Senate Administrative Practices Subconnittee,

In July of 1960, Senstor Long was alerted to the fact thai

the Agency had had sensitive operational contacts with Maheu.

Senator Long was told that the Agency had used waheu over

the years on a number of occasions but that he had never

been asked to engage in any viretapping and had nover
