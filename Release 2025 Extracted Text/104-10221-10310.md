purposoly embarrass Rubark of its South Florida gporations.

untorial would bo brought to ruThwa inmodiate attention.

ANCARDON -2 nade it clear to MICARDON-l tliat such 1tems should br

discussod with REUTSEW in a frank manner.

In aduition, ACARIN-2

mado the point that,

aftor in itom was discussed, ACARION-1

should folion REUTEN'a guidanco relative to how any particularly

ombarrassing ten might be hindied by the Identity 3, do that 1t

could not expose KuBiK operations and,

at the game

not jeopardizo the Journalistic reputation of the ldchtlty. 3..

In addition, AlCARION-? pointed out

that,

• potentially embarrassing iton to RULiN's attention and

remedial action on the matter ung not taken by REUTiN within

then

the Identity 3 would frel frce

to expuge any ineptness on KUbRi's part.

ANCARDON- pointed

out that in return for this cooperation

tron the Identity 3,

REUTEN had agreed that he rould bo avallablo for contuet by

telophone or periodic porsonal metings at which ANCARBON-Y

and ANCARBON-2 could discuss brond trends and dovelopmonts in

Latin Auerican affairs.

ABCARDON-2 advised MCNNON-l that this

arrangement did not moan that ANCARDON? could expect to

obtain

any classified information from REUTEIN.

The point was also

made that ALCARDON -l should not press for tho obtaining of

classified inforration, but ho should he alert to stcoring tips

ANCARBON-1 Indicated that lo understood the framo of rotorenco

This frano of roference

has prevailed throughout JAVAVE's relationship with ASCARDON-1
