Cap tain Despain 1s planning on goinE

to join t:

U. So Army. He is definitely strongly suspected of giving everythi

of Intelligence to Castro and is tied in with the Conmunist and Car

groups here.

He may even soon plan to disappear from the scene and

should not be allowed to get off easily. Ho has been keeping Dr.

Jose Julio Fernandez from organizing his anti-Castro and Anti-Comi

files due to lack of funds (says Despain).

It seems

that this was

an excuse before and was done to keep the ball functioning as shoul

be.. I think that this Dr. Jose • Jullo Fernandez is very

sincere w

is innocently giving everything into the hands of Despain without

knowing. How Despain got into this position is not known by us jet.

As far as we are concerned he is a Castro penetration into the Freni

and U.S. activities.

The above 1s the, result of being
