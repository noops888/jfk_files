SOLACE

Us citizen, a former intelligence officer who is employed

wich a fimi that conducts business on a worldwide scule.

A representative of a US company wich contracts in Algerta

in early March 1974 held a personal conversation on

business

matters with a high level Algerian Foreign Ministry Offiçial

(other wise unidentified) in Algiers.

The Algerian montioned

that his

government has become increasingly concerned with

the expanding presence in Algeria of US citizons, who are

in the country as a result. of the growing number of US

business contracts.

Alrost in passing, the Algerian noted

trad nis governient is suspicious that many"or the Arericans

miant be US intelligence agents.

In fact, he claimed that

Siperian security authorities

"already have identified six

CA Agents",

and that these individuals "are under close

Surveillance"

The us businessman did not want to appear

too inquisitive, and so he did not probe for any further

infomation on this matter.

He is not able to provide the

runes of the individuals who are under suspicion.
