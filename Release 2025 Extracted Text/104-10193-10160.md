The sub-source ig an NPD

official who had ccess to the

information.

The executive committee of the lost German National

Democratic Party (NPD) will mect on

18 larch with officials

of the Baden-wuerttemberg NPD oranization and attempt to

persuade the land organication not to contest the 23 April

land election.

The exocutive committee will point out that

If the NPD does not, run candidates in this election, the

chances for the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) to

majority in

the Baden-Wuerttemberg election will be enhanced.

This would enable the CDU to retain 1ts Bundesrat majority

and improve the chances of defenting the Eastern treaties of

the Social Democratic Party/Free Democratic Party government.

The background'of the exccutive committec's desire

to avoid contesting the Baden-Wuerttenberg election is its

estimate that

the YPD would capture only two per cent of the

vote this jear

compared with g.f per cent in the last

clection,

a result which the executive connittee is most

anxlous to avoid.

IN HIS ANALYSIS OF THE TYPE CE WOrLD ECONONIC

SYSTEM WHICH SHOULD FOLLOW THE CURRENT AMERICAN CONTROLS

AND FLOATING OF THE DOLLAR, VON THADDEN DRAWS HEAVILY FROM

THE 23 SEPTEMBER PRESS CONFERENCE OF FRENCH PRESIDENT POMPIDOU..

HE SAYS THAT THE DOLLAR CAN NO LONGER BE CONSIDERED THE

SINGLE WORLD CURRENCY. THE PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY OF EUROPE

MAKES IT NECESSARY THAT A EUROPEAN RESERVE CURRENCY BE

AVAILABLE AS A SECOND WORLD CURRENCY. THIS CANNOT BE

THE BRITISH POUND AS MANY PEOPLE AT ONE TIME WOULD HAVE

BELIEVED, BUT MUST BE A CURRENCY ACCEPTED BY BOTH FRANCE

AND GERMANY AND ADMINISTERED BY A COMMON GERMAN-FRENCH

BANK SUPPORTED BY GOLD. ALL EUROPEAN STATES WOULD USE

THIS BANK FOR INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS.

VON THADDEN VIENS POMPIDOU'S SPEECH AS A SIGNAL TO THE

UNITED STATES THAT THE FRENCH ARE NOT WILLING TO STAY

PERMANENTLY UNDER ECONOMIC PRESSURE FROM WASHINGION, AND

AS PROVIDING AN OUTLINE OF THE TYPE OF ECONONIC ORDER

EUROPE SHOULD HAVE IN THE FUTURE. HE CRITICIZES THE WEST

GERMAN GOVERNMENT FOR NOT TAKING A SIMILAR STAND, SAYING

THAT WHEN IT IS POSSIBLE FOR ONE STATE TO PUT ECONOMIC

PRESSURE ON OTHER STATES, THE SITUATION CAN LEAD TO

At. the congress, several prominent NPD leaders emphasized

the need for party unity; these

There are many unresoired questions and problems, how-.

For instance,

the

"national conservative" concept,

which was adopted in the manifesto

issued by the congress,

came under strong attack.

One group, which

A medium-lovel West German

governmont official who follows

the

activities of the National Democratic Party and who had

access

to the study during his official duties.

The informa-

tion was extracted from

the original document and is believed.

to be an

accurate summary of its highlights.

Summary:

In June 1968, the West German Ministry of the Interior

prepared a basic study of the prospects of banning the west German

Nätional Democratic Party (NPD): The summary of this study given

below

describes the major charges which the government could bring

against the NPD, the defenses the NPD could be expected to make

against these charges, and the probable political results which

would follow both a successful and an unsuccessful case agalnst the

NPD.

According to the source, this study is still considered the

basic Interior Ministry evaluation of the case against the NPD and

1s being studied by senior federal government and

state (Land)

officials...

End of Summary.

1.

(Field Comment:

For several years, West German political

and government

leaders

have debated seeking a constitutional court

ban

on the NPD.

On 13 November 1968, Ernst

Benda,

West German

Interior Minister,

advised Chancellor Kurt Georg

Kicsinger

that there was sufficient evidence to warrant bringing a suit against

the NPD.

Klesinger, however,

opposed bringing a suit,

and the sub-

ject became embroiled in West German politics.

Cn 23 April 1969,

the Federal Cabinet decided not to seck

i court ban of the NPD, at

least until after the September elections; This decision was

prompted by evidence that the NPD was making no membership guing

and apparently was losing popular support.)

the study, it: is'clear. that: the nuthors belleved that the courts

(Pteld Comment: If the study is still consideredicurrent,

it 1s

unclear how It fits with Benda's November 1968 statement that there

was sufficent evidence to obtain a ban against the NPD.)

The study summarized the case which could be brought

agalnst the NPD as follows:

a.

It could be shown that there was a simllarity

between the NPD and the National Socialist German Workers

Party. (NSDAP) which has been outlawed.

It could be argued that the goals, and parts of

the party platform, of the NPD are contrary to the prin-

•ciples of a free democratic state.

The study concludes that a sufficiently strong case could be pre-

sented to prevent the case being thrown out by the courts without

a hearing..

The study lists the following points which the NPD could

be expected to use in its defense:

2 :

The party could prove that it has given firm instruc-

[tlons to its members not to engage in rowdylam or violence.

b. It could show that a sizeable number of former

NSDAP members have been forced out of the party as part

of the Selbstreinigung (self-cleaning) process.

which are in accord with democratic principles.

It could point out many features of its program

d.

It could show that its elected representatives

have worked with other parties and have not. disrupted the

Landtage

(state diets) and othar elected bodies in which

they participate.

It could point out that other political parties

have many ex-Nazis and ex-communists as members and could

claim that the majority of the 28,000 NPD members are not

• opposed to the concept of the Federal Republic.

f.

It would charge that the government's charges were

one-sided, unfairly presented, and out of date.

It would claim that not all of Professor Ernst

Anrich

points were included in the party plat-

form.

"(Field Comment: Anrich is a former university

professor-from Darmstadt whose proposals were apparently more

extreme than those incorporated in the party platform.)

The study states that it would de very difficult to re-

fute these NPD defenses In court.

The government would have to

admit that since carly 1968 there lave been vory low statements

made iby NPD leaders, or incidets

caused by the NPD,

be used to support the government's case.

Objectively, It would

have to be admitted that many

incidents

of violence in

which the

NPD has been involved were initiated by opponents of the party.

6.

The atudy predicts the following probable results should

the government. win its case

against the NPD:

The NPD would probably respect the prohibition.

it is very unlikely that the NPD would attempt to so under-

ground as the Illegal Communist Party of Germany (KPD) did.

b. NPD members and sympathizers would not change their

opinions because of

Many would Join other groups

or partles and continue to work for their political bellels.

C.

NPD and rightist sympathizers would begin a cam-

paign for the banning of the new German Commundat Party

(DKP) and other leftist groups.

A ban of the NPD would be well recelved in foregn

countries.

The study concludes that if the government should lose a

case against the NPD, it would be the result of the lack of valid

evidence (Beweleschwiertgkelten). In such an event, the following

adverse effects would occur:

publicity.

The NPD would receive a new impetus and valuable

b.

The policy of Selbstreinigung which has had some

success in keeping former Nazis out of key positions would

be halted..

Many middle-class persons who sympathize with the

NPD, but who have refrained from open support because of

the

stigma of being associated with a party which could be

declared illegal, would join the party or become active

supporters.

The party would undoubtedly attract more members.

(Field Comment:

The NPD leadership is known to be worried

because the party's membership has not increased sigalfi-

cantly during the past 18 months.)

Summary:

The Berlin NPD has been plagued by n split between the

and the

"Loyalists

hended by the Berlin district leaders, who oppoged

von Thadden

in October 1968:. Court action led to the thwarting

of the plan for dissolution.

In an effort to keep the Berlin Party

alive, in mid March von Thadden ordered a cessation of open Party ac-

•tivities until after the september parliamentary elections.

Subse-

quently, von Thadden arranged a postponement of a scheduled Berlin

Party convention unti! October, because of the possibility of a ban

on the Berlin NPD by the Allles

and the

threat of trouble from the

militant left.

At the end of March, Berlin City NPD Chief Rudolf

Kendzia resigned

in an effort to promote party unity in Berlin,

but

he remains active behind the scenés.

Since carly April, the Berlin

NPD leadership has

followed von Thadden's guidelines.

The iniluence

of the Loyalists has been greatly reduced, and in accordance with

von Thadden's

instructions party

activities have been circumspect.

Both the Berlin and the National leadership are hoping that the NPD

will obtain 25 to 35 Bundestag seats in September, which, they feel,

will

make the party more acceptable to right-wing voters

in Berlin

and enhance NPD chances during the 1971 Berlin communal elections.

Berlin is planning to send volunteer workers to campaign for the NPD

in West Germany, especially in North Rhine-Westphalia, the NPD strong-

hold.

WEST GERMAN'SDITIONAL DEVOCRATS IND THE GRANUCOALITION

Gernas!''s far-right National Democratic Party

(NPD) showed another increase

in strength in recent

elections 'in Baden-Wuerttemberg, while the Social

Democrats (SPD) lost heavily.

This outcome in a

traditionally liberal and prosperous state appears

to stem in part from the dissatisfaction of many

Socialists

and trade unionists

in

the SPD with

their party's cabinet cooperation with the Christian

Democrats (CDU) .

Another

factor was the discontent

of farmers. and refugees with the policies

Consern over student dis-

orders contriblited to

the teJ gains, but this was

not

as -decisive

as

some have

supposed.

Despite -

these gains, the NPD

is unlitely

to

achieve

growth comparable to that of she lazi Party in the

early 1930s.

The outcome in Baden-Huerttemberg confirmed

the belief of many Socialists

that their coopera-

tion with

the CDU at both

the rational and state

level is proving to be unprofieaole

for the party.

As a result,

they have

already decided at the

state

level not to renew

cabinet cooperation with the

CDU in Bader-wuerttemberg,

thus

making prospects

for the Bona coalition appear less favorable.

Nevertheless,

SPD leaders in sorn rerain cormitted

to the Grand Coalition and

setious instability at

the federal level seems unlikely.

Over the long

that

THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN WEST GERMANY

The poor showing of the ultranationalistic

National

Democratic Party (SPD) in

recent elections

in several West German

disproves the

party''s

claim of providing

an acceptable alternative

to the policies and programs of the country's major

parties:

The NPD's failure to maintain the

mamen tum

suyuested by the successes scored in two state

elections last fall is directly. attributable both

to its own well-publicized internal dissension and

to voter preference for the Christian Democrats and

Socialists deriving from the image of vigor anjo

however, the resulting .concern

in the major parties might prompt

a reconsideration of this policy:

Interior Minister Luecke favors

banning the party as soon as

"enough evidence can be obtained

It is also possible that new

NPD gains would motivate the

established parties to make pro-

posed changes in the electoral

law that would make it more dif-

ficult for the NPD to obtain

Bundestag representation.

Although the NPD program is

strongly reminiscent of Hitlerian

National Socialism, the party's

electoral supporters in Messe

• who have no prior Nazi aifiiia-

tions or any particular suscepti-

bility to Nazism per se. It has

estimate that

no more than

2 percent of armed forces members

are card-carrying NPD members.

Since :the NPD is a legal political

organization, military leaders

are

constrained from openly in-

fluencing members of

the armed

forces to oppose it.

Many Germans are probably

reluctant openly to admit their

support for an organization like

the NPD..

It is significant, how-

ever, that only 6 percent of

respondents to a national opinion

poll in January 1967

indicated a

preference for the NPD.

Leadership Problems

The most notable single

handicap confronting

the weakness

of

the NPD is

its leadership.

None

of its leaders possesses any

great talent

or

stature.

Cer-

tainly no individual with Hitler's

demagogic

genius has yet ap-

neared.

The absence of strong

leadership in what has been called

"fuehrer-oriented party" has

left it divided and weakened by

factionalism.

This was clearly

demonstrated in March 1967 wher.

then party chairmar. Fritz

Thieien

and Deputy Chairman Adolf von

Thadden engaged in a public feud

which further damaged the party's

reputation.

An outgrowth of long-

standing personal antagonism, the

dispute was triggered by Thielen's

resistance to Von Thadden's at-

tempted take-over as party chalr-

man

in

Lower Saxony.

Thielen

claimed that Von Thadden's elec-

tion to the state chairmanship

had been illegal and would

hurt

the party's reputation.

The par-

ty's

federal executive, however,

turned the tables on Thielen and

not only voted to reinstate Von

Thadden but also to diop Thielen

from the national chairmanship and

expel him from the party. Thielen

clung to the helm under a temporary.

court order until finally throwing

in the sponge in early May with

an announcement of his formation

of a new, rival part',

the Na-

ional Peoples Party (NVP).

More of an archconservative

than a neo-Nazi, Thielen was

never

more

than a figurehead.

Real au-

thority and leadership--as well

as

ideological guidance--was provided

by Von Thadden.

Von Thadden is.

a 45-year-old native of Pomerania,

a member of a prominent and

aris-

tocratic Prussian family, a number

of whose members were

prominent

in the anti-Nazi resistance.

Al-

though von Thadden

applied

for

Nazi party membership he appar-

ently was nover formally admitted.

An ardent nationalist, Von Thadden

aspires to become a German De

Gaulle rather than a re-creator of

the German Reich.

ence include Otto less, parts

the NPD is its inability as jet to

NPD feeds upon nostalgia for an

The party puts forth slogans

proclaiming

"Germany for the Ger-

nans" and "Europe for the Euro-

peans."

Indeed, 'the NPD favors

a united Europe somewhat along the

lines advocated by De Gaulle.

Europe, it

holds, should be com-

pletely independent of

the US,

and possess it's

own nuclear deter-

rent:

It should be

built on a

Franco-German alliance that smaller

European countries sooner or later

would

have to join.

The NPD would

welcome the decay of NATO as

sig-

naling

the end of sterile policies

which

do not serve Germany's Ical

interests.

In socking to gain the broad-

est popular acceptance, the party

avoids affirming the more extreme

aspects of Nazi ideology.

for example, no obvious anti-

Semitism in the party program

and Jews technically could become

leadership, however,

are said to resemble traditional

Nazi anti-Semitism closely.

NPD makes vague references, *9100

rejects evidence relating

to the Nazi

extermination policy,

makes derogatory references

the Jews in

the party press, and

denounces aid to Israel.

In recent campaigning in

shifted tactics somewhat by no

longer stressing issues

obviously

associated with

the Nazi period

such as war guilt and reparations.

Instead, they sought to exploit

current grievances including

economic recession, unemploy-

lack of progress on reuni-

fication,

and, what they called

the

unreliability of NATO.

Future Prospects

The NPD's failure to main-

tain the momentum of last fall's

successes in this year's state

elections in Schleswig-Holstein,

Rhineland-Palatinate,

and Lower

SaNony

is a serious

blow to the

party's hopes.

The squabble

among

the leadership apparently

reinforced the

celing among

un-

committed elements

that casting

a protest

vote

for the NPD was

not worthwhile under present cir-

cumstances.

The videspread dis-

content among farmers over 90v-

ernment economy measures did not

result in a significant shift of

votes to the NPD.

Moreover,

there has been a strony

resur-

gence of general confidence

in

the

Bonn government.

Although

the NPD benefited last fall from

the popular dissatisfaction with

the Erhard government, the grand

coalition headed by CDU Chancellor

Kiesinger has displayed vigor and

decisiveness which

has been re-

warded at the polls.

Even if the NPD were to fol-

low its forerunners into oblivion

it would not mark the end of right-

ist extremism.

A portion of the

German electorate

will remain re-

ceptive to

this kind of appeal.

In the absence of a party such

as

the NPD, right-wing voters tend

to give

their

support to one of

the insignificant splinter par-

ties, or to one of the more con-

servative established parties.

such as the FDP, when they vote

at all.

It is possible--although in-

creasingly-unlikely--that the NPD

could turn out to resemble other

parties of a national-conserva-

•tive stamp.. Despito the radical

views of some of thoir members;

such groups have.managed.to..op-

erate without subversive mani-

festations.

The 'German Party (DP),

for

example, which had been

rep-

resented in

several North German

state legislatures and in the

Bundestag conducted itself. in a.

responsible fashion.

The NPD at present draws. a

good deal of this traditional

right-wing vote from the old Refu-

goe Party, the DP, and small con-

servative

regional parties such

as the Bavarian Party.

The total

extremist vote, however, has in-

creased very little since the

establishment of the NPD.

Es-

timates of the extent of hard-core

ultranationalist sentiment in

Germany vary between 5 and 15 per-

cent of the electorate.

Under

present conditions this does not

constitute a threat to German dem-

ocratic institutions and is not

greater than the degree of ex-

tremist sentiment in other West-

ern. European countries.

Outlook

Assuming

the NPD survives

the current period of internal...

strife, its potential for further

growth beyond its present 6- to

8-percent range appears to be

limited under conditions now pre-

vailing in west Germany..

The NPD

is still capable of capitalizing

on circumstances which might pre-

sent themselves as a result of a

protracted economic recession or

mujor political blunders

which

would

discredit the present gov-

ernment leadership.

The outcome

of recent state elections, how-

ever, tends to confirm that the

overwhelming majority of German

voters continues to prefer the

moderate, albeit increasingly

independent and nationalist, pol-

icies of the major parties and

the government,

and rejects the

radical alternatives advocated

by the NPD. (SECRET)

chairmen and in six Laender have access to the minutes

The BfY has also penetrated

Through its penetration of the national organization, the

BfV has been able to outain and photograph

the entire mem-

bership rolls, which currently contain about 20,000 names.

The national list has been augmented by additional member~

ship applications obtained via ponotrations of the

Land organizations.

of tracing all of these membership applications against

to counter the NPD in Rheinland-Pfalz urior to the libcoming

All of the parties have agraed

to participnte and this activity is moving ahead. Recently

at a two-day conference chaired by the BIV in'a village

on the Mosel River, it was decided not only to counteract

NPD. propaganda during the election campaign, but also to

undertake orientation lectures for all officials in the.

Rheinland-Pfalz and other local governments who have shown

NPD leanings.

These courses will be launched as soon as

councils.

The BiV has also

established contact with the

German Industrial Institute

in Colögne,

which is sponsored by the German equivalent of

the U.S. National Association of Manufacturers.

The BfY

used as an argument with the industrialists the fact that.

Increasing influence of the NPD in Geruan industry would

have. a negative.effect.upon foreign trade.

The BfV undertook a survey of

the election results at the

village and county

level in Land Ressa.

This surrey showed

that the NPD had substantial success in areas containing

Geran military installations. It was further

determined

that the NPD had considerable appeal among non-cornissioned

professional soldiers who feel they have failed to find

acceptance in the postwar German society.

This negative

attitude has been

less among Bundeswehr officers and draftee

than anong: non-commissioned officers, who feel themselves under-

The BfV has contacted
