CIA JFK Collections
1) Oswald 201 file: 17 boxes (Aug 93/Jan 94 Release)
JFK hard copy, 63 boxes (Aug 93/Feb 94 Release)
1)
2) JFK microfilm, 72 reels (currently under review)
The Microfilm Reels contain the files that the HSCA staff
either requested or had access to. A great deal of the
material is duplicative of that found in the 63 hard copy
boxes including the complete Oswald 201 file. There are
also files not related to the assassination story and files
not reviewed by the HSCA.
HGR has reviewed all the microfilm material (page by page)
with the exception of the Oswald 201 file. The Microfilm
collection has been divided into to two parts:
1) documents reviewed for release and being prepare
for NARA (records related to the assassination, the
investigations, or the various conspiracy theories),
2) documents reviewed but being held pending
discussion with the board (see attachment).

Microfilm Material Not Processed for Release (Pending
Discussion with the Board):.

Oswald 201 File
this appears to be a duplicate of the hard
copy 201 file reviewed in 1993. 12+ Reels/approximately
30,600 pages
CIA Staff Employees' Personnel Files Approximately 10,800
pages located on 7 different reels. Request that these file
not be considered part of the JFK collection as a matter of
privacy. Only a small portions of these files have any
relevance to the JFK investigations and we believe that the
documents related to their roles in the JFK story were
released in the JFK hard copy collection. We have reviewed
each of the OP files and prepared a classified summary for
the Board.
Non-Related Material
three major categories:
Most of these documents fall into
Individual 201 files : These files cover the entire
period of agency interest or contact with a person. For
individuals who are not "key figures" in the JFK story,
those sections of the file that are outside relevant time
frames or can not be linked to Oswald, the assassination,
the various investigations, or any of the conspiracy
theories have been treated as non-related.
Project/Operational Files: Many of these cover the
complete life of a project. Sections of these file deals
with operations which have no connection with the
assassination or fall in only part of a relevant time frame.
For example there are over 3000 pages on the Mexico City
Photo operation covering the 1960's and 1970's.
related material is that falling in the time frame of
Oswald's visit to Mexico City and the investigation
following the assassination.
The only
The anti-Castro

However, some
Cuban Exile Groups/Operations:
activities of the Cuban exiles in the US during 1960
are considered relevant to the assassination.
of the organizations and individuals members continued to
run operations against Castro into the 1970's. The exile
activities after the assassination are generally not
considered related unless they involve plots to assassinate
Castro, the continuation of pre-assassination projects or
the Garrison Investigation.

Notes:
I did not address the financial records of the CRC that we
are replacing with a summary (need to review again); we will
probably have to wait until we meet with the full board to
get their thinking on summaries.
For
There are other categories/types of documents that are non-
related but do not fit in the above categories.
example, the HSCA requested files on 29 on defectors; they
chose only 11 for their defector sample to be compared with
Oswald. We treated the 11 as related and the rest as non-
related. However, the number of pages involved is small
compared to the above three categories.

Assassination Review Board
Second Public Meeting, 12 July 1994
Room 105, NARA
Official Attendees: Members of the Board, Steve Tilly, NARA.
Public:
Purpose:
25/30 in attendance including four from FBI (Terry
& Grant), Lesar, and Newman. Also one network
(ABC?) rep.
Transact official business, briefing form Tilly on
recent releases; discuss future board activities
Selected items of HRG Interest:
I spoke with Jack after the meeting. Ex. Director MARWELL
will be on board 8 Augusts; they expect to be in new offices
by 15 August and have a core staff in September. Jack said
(after meeting) he would like to meet us last part of
August/early September.
Tilly said that the CIA would be releaseing 70,000 pages
later this summer (he ask me before the meeting if July was
still a good date I said "no"). He also mentioned the
20,000 pages of HSCA material in our files that we would be
reviewing this summer.
FBI received praise from the board; not much discussion of
CIA.
DOD agencies are now the "bad boys". Hall ask several
pointed questions about the "small" DOD releases then Newman
blasted NSA and DIA during the question period.
Items/Issues addressed by the Board during the meeting:
Announced appointment of Executive Director David G. MARWELL
(see bio sheet) Will be on board 8 August.
Passed resolution extending the Board to October 1995
MOA signed with the White House funds through Sept. 1994
Discussed status of items before Congress (extending the
Board to October 1996 and funding). Funds included in House
version of appropriation bill/deleted from Senate. They
assume that the funds will be restored in Conference;
however, could be reduced which would impact on number of
public meeting to held outside of Washington.
Expects to move into new office space by mid-August and have
a core staff in place in September. The bulk of the staff
would come on board in October.
14-00000
Plans to begin public hearing on defining an assassination
record in Sept. Anna Nelson commented on the importance of
identifying what is a record before beginning to address
specific issues/documents.
William Joyce reported that he had sent letters to 55
agencies asking about the quaintly of records still held by
the agency and had received 20 responses several which had
identified additional sources for documents (no specifics)
Steve Tilley gave a briefing on status of releases.
Releases since last meeting include tapes of telephone calls
from the Johnson Library, the FBI files, Church Committee (7
boxes), and DOJ'S FOIA litigation files. This month an
additional 10 boxes of Church Committee and some Pike
Committee Files (only a small part deals with JFK). Expects
a release from the CIA of approximately 70,000 pages later
this summer (mentioned the 73 Reels).
Tilley also described the 20,000 pages of HSCA material in
CIA files and that NARA would be acting as House agent on
these record.
Questions (to Tilly) by the Board:
Size of the NARA collection?
per foot)
1200 Cubic Feet (2500 pages
(Jack) what was the number of documents with redactions?
Steve said he could not give a figure, would guess less than
50%
(Graff) any problems with agencies' willingness to release
documents
The
None, considers the work be the various
agencies as a remarkable effort to turn over records.
problem was the volume of material and the time it takes to
review.
A question about Senate and House Committee reviews
procedures led to a discussion where it was clear that
neither the Board nor Tilly had a good fix on that part of
the review. The point was made that CIA information in
those documents (and in our HSCA material) would be reviewed
by CIA reviewers; the originator of the information was the
key reviewer)
(Jack) how were the agencies doing in defining
"assassination records? Tilly described some of his
discussions about assassination records within NARA and with
other agencies. He mentioned that the "major agencies" had
records that they felt fell outside the scope which they
planned to discuss with the board.
14-00000
:
(Hall) how was the cooperation of the DOD intelligence
agencies including NSA / how much had they withheld ?
Tilly said he found them cooperative but that the release
was small. Did not know off hand how much was withheld.
Hall considered so few record as "suspect" and ask if NARA
had followed up. Tilly said no. NARA did not have the
authority to question the agencies about their searches.
He
indicated that the Army among others had not responded to
NARA's initial request. (During the public comments part of
the meeting Newman and Lesar returned to the question of DOD
compliance.)
Several members of the Board had questions about the
Presidential Libraries; Tilly described his role and the
process.
He
When Jack open the meeting for public comments, Newman
returned to the question about DOD releases. He clamied
that NSA had release only one true document and that most of
the DIA files was administrative or news clipping. He said
he had seen at least 30 DOD documents in CIA and FBI files
that did not appear in the DIA release.
Newman then ask if the agencies could withhold documents
from the Board; Jack responded that under the law thar only
Board had the power to withold a document.
Lesar ask if the Board had given consideration to his letter
concerning the definition of an assassination record. Jack
thanked him for the letters but the Board would not be able
to address the issues Lesar raised until they had a staff to
do the research.
A third "expert" named Mark Zaid ask a question about Post
Office files that had been released before and how they
compared with recent Post Office files found by NARA.
responded that such questions require a staff.

information was assembled in response to HSCA requests. Three categories
of information must now be disposed of under terms of the HSCA/DCI
itemorandum of Understanding.
Category la: Classified material from Agency
holdings, requested by the HSCA, which HSCA staff
members reviewed.
Category lb: Classified material from Agency
holdings, requested by the HSCA, but which HSCA
staff members did not review.
Category 2: Material generated by the HSCA from
Agency classified holdings made available to the
HSCA in response to the latter's request. (Note:
This HSCA material is considered by the HSCA as its
property and, therefore, not releasable to the
public under the Freedom of Information Act. An
inventory of this material received from HSCA has
been completed.)
Category 3: Classified correspondence and certain
unclassified correspondence exchanged between this
Agency and the NSCA.
2. The HSCA has indicated its desire that copies of these three
categories of material be held in sealed and segregated storage to
ensure the preservation of all relevant records pertaining to the
phase of the investigation involving this Agency. In order to accom-
modate the HSCA, but also leave our own records accessible for routine
purposes, a photographic copy should be made of each official Agency
document made available in response to a specific request by the HSCA
(Category la and lb).

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
BETWEEN THE DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE
AND THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS
19 August 1977
ப
"
I. Preparation of Materials
A. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) will cooperate fully
in the investigations conducted by the Select Committee on Assassinations
(Committee) by providing access, as requested, to classified information
within the releasing authority of the CIA, and held by the CIA, that bears
upon the study and investigation authorized by H. Res. 222. CLA will
notify the Committee of any requested information held by CLA not
within the releasing authority of the CIA, and notify the Committee of the
proper authority to contact to obtain the information. No document or a
portion of the document in the possession of CIA will be withheld without
written notice of that action to the Committee. Access to all classified
information designated for protection from unauthorized disclosure by the
Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) and currently held by any federal
agency or department shall be governed by this memorandum.
B. Documentary material will be made available as expeditiously
and completely as feasible, subject to the responsibility of the DCI to
protect sensitive intelligence sources and methods. The Committee and
CLA will periodically agree upon a list of identities that will not be excised
from materials turned over to the Committee. Subject to the list of
identities that will not be deleted, CIA will appropriately sanitize, including
excising if necessary, information to assure protection of information
identifying sensitive sources and methods. When an excision is made,
CIA will indicate the nature of the source or method excised, including the
functional intelligence discipline which was the source of the intelligence.
C. The Chief Counsel of the Select Committee on Assassinations
and a designated representative of the DCI shall meet monthly to discuss
a random sample of the complete and unsanitized materials selected by
the Chief Counsel for the purpose of verifying the appropriateness of the
sanitizing done by the CIA. Those matters on which they do not agree
shall be referred to the Chairman, Ranking Minority Member, and the
DCI for resolution.
