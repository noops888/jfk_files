A. REPORT OF FINDINGS

On 4 February 1972, Robert M. Greed, Sp4, 514-54-4745, Security

Guard, & Team, 66th USA Artillery Detachment, Datteln (L68424), Federal

Republic of Germany (FRG), APO New York 09078, was interviewed at his place

of duty regarding an incident of possible Counter-Intelligence interest,

and

stated substantially as follows:

At 1200 hours on 3 February 1972, Creed received a telephone call

unit from John the Dee Jay.

Source his last name, saying that he had a difficult time getting a hold of

could and asked John if he wanted him to return the Air Force parka he had

borrowed from him the previous evening John said that it was not necessary

to return the jacket and that source could hold on to it for a while if he

wished.

John said

"You didn't have a chance to get to the man at the photo

shop yet, have you?" Source said that he had not. John said that it did not

matter, it could be done later. John asked Source if he could meet him at

the Lord Nelson at 2000 hours, to which Source replied that he could. The

conversation ended.

Source met John the Dee Jay at 2000 hours, 3 February 1972,

in the Lord Nelson, Datteln. John was very interested in the Military

Police that were in Datteln, wanting to know why they were in town.

John

stated that he knew they had come from Westkirchen (MC3549), FRG, and wanted

to know where they were going next.

John was extremely interested in the

Military Policemen.

John was interested in the jeeps that the Military Police

had with them, two of which were parked in the parking lot near the lord

Nelson. John wanted to know what the numbers written in chalk on the jeeps

meant. Were they call numbers or code numbers as to the point of origin of

the jeeps. John mentioned that the radios in the jeeps were nothing, that

he knew where he could get a radio that could reach Brazil. John mentioned

Julius and said something about Julius having some military photographs.

John was not clear on this point and Source was unable to determine exactly

what John had meant. John said that he was going to have his photograph

taken at the Althoff Photo Shop, Datteln, which was across the street from

the Western Bar, where John resided. John asked Source to bring him some

war and Army books.

John said all he wanted were some war stories, nothing

about NORAD or SANRAS (Special Ammunitions Recognition and Authentication

System). Source was not positive that John had said SANRAS because John

had said it quickly, but Source was fairly sure. John offered to pay for

all Source's drinks if Source did not have any money. Source returned

the borrowed Air Force parka to John who was very suspicious about it and

evening and would be unable to meet him.
