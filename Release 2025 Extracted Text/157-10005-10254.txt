Cuban airborne brigade that eventually was parachuted into Cuba
six hours in advance of the landing at the Bay of Pigs. This
training was conducted at a site in the Guatamelan jungle called

(phonetic spelling).
During the time this training was conducted, i.e. from
1959 to the Bay of Pigs invasion, Mr. Stephens recalls there
were two occasions when he and/or members of his 4-5 man train-
ing cadre were told to give parachutes and weapons to individuals
who were to be parachuted into Cuba to attempt to assassinate
Castro. Mr. Stephens stated that he did not precisely recall
whether he was expressly told these individuals were going to
Cuba to try to kill Castro, but he said he was clear that from
either the instructions he received or the nature and details
of the particular situation that this was the mission.
I asked Mr. Stephens to describe what he would do after
being told to outfit the individuals who were to be dropped
into Cuba for these assassination efforts. He stated that he
or members of his cadre (he declined to specify whether he
personally outfitted these individuals or whether it was done
by his co-workers) would provide parachutes and whatever
weapons the individuals desired. He referred to an "assassi-
nation package." Such a "package" would contain a variety
of weapons, grenades, and other armaments, including a special
"assassination gun." This gun, Mr. Stephens said, was a 9 mm.
