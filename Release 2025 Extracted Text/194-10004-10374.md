COURT OF HEARING OF PUERTO RICO

SUPERIOR COURT

San Juan Court

) Civil Case Num. CS-62-6720

) Concerning:

) Ad Perpetuam Rei Memoriam

RESOLUTION

This case was held before the undersigned Judge on 31 August 1962, with

the intervention of the Prosecuting Attorney, having proved tothe satis-

faction of the Court the following: that the petitioner was born on 11

August 1910, in Utuado, Puerto Rico, the natural son of Juana Marti; that on

birth certificate 636, page 237, book 44, for the year 1910, in Utuado, the

petitioner appears with the first name Adrian; that this circumstance consti-

tutes an error because the true and authentic first name of the petitioner

is Manuel, which first name he has used since his birth; that the petitioner

has two legitimate sons named Ivan and Manuel, who appear on their respective

birth certificates with the surname Sotomayor, which constitutes an error be-

cause the legal surname of the aforementioned minors is Marti; that the peti-

tioner used the surname Sotomayor erroneously because he believed that he

had been recognized by his father.

In support of the allegations of the application, the petitioner pre-

sented attested and documentary proof to the complete satisfaction of the

Court.

The births of the aforementioned children, Ivan and Manuel, are filed

in San Juan, Puerto Rico, under numbers 213 and 2765 of District 164, file

numbers 12969 and 36046, years 1945 and 1946, respectively.

Considering and analysing the evidence in this case, the Court, by the

present, declares the application made by the petitioner to be in order and

orders the Bureau of Demographic Registry and Statistics of the Department

of Health of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to proceed with the correction

of the petitioner's first name in order that it appear on his birth certi-

ficate with his true first name of Manuel and in order that his two afore-

mentioned minor sons appear in their respective birth certificate with the

paternal surname Marti, and also to correct the name of the father of the

said minors so that it appears as Manuel Marti instead of Adrian Sotomayor;

all this in accordance with what is set forth in law 119, approved on 26

April 1950.

Given in San Juan, Puerto Rico, today the 12th day of February 1963.
