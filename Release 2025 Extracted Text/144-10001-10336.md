The UN was in adjournment today. Tomorrow morning there

will be a meeting of the plenary to pay homage to the memory

of President KENNEDY. For the afternoon therefare scheduled

meetings of the Security Council on apartheid and some other

committees, but not the Fourth Committee. Therefore this

will give the Secretariat of State in Lilbon more time

to make demarches to governments concerning the forthcoming

vote in the Fourth Committee.
