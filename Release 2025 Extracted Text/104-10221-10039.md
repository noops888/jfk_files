the source the tollowing information concerning plans

which allegcdly reflect Subicet's interest

"and

Subject has discussed plans to establish a Cuban Govern-

ment in cile on Angolan soil with the help of Holden

ROBERTO, ENLA:

Subject is prepared on recoipt of agree

ment from Roberto to provide food, medical toams and

other forms of

assistance to the ENLA. Ostensibly, this

would be a first

step following recognition by Roberto

of a Cuban

Exilc Gore mment.

'This government would then

attcinpt.

toraise troops ands

among other things, capture 15

many Castro soldiers

as possibir in order to use them as

an exchange or trade

instrument.

The funds for such an

cuterprise ostensibly would come from Cuban Communities in

Brazil, Nicaragua, Panama, Mexico,

Venezuela and the United

States.

One aspect of the proposed unconventional war is

the

use of counterfeit Angolan moncy.

Aiso allegedly

involved is planning to secure Angolan aid for Panamanians

who oppose Torrijose

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:

SUBJECT: Frank Anthony STURGIS (201-242256)

1.

This morning I received a phone call

from the COS, Miami who

advised me that yesterday

Frank Sturgis called the DCD, Niami Offico,

and

expressed a desire to meet with one of the DED

officers.

Sturgis claimed to have new information

on the movement

of

narcotics through Nexico and

other information which he did not specify.

The DCD Miami Office thanked Sturgis for

calling and referred him to the FBI and DEA,

who would be the most interested recipients of

the information he has:

Sturgis was very pleasant

on the telephone and the DCD people obviously

responded correctly.
