POSSIBLE CHANGE IN MEXICAN POSITION TOWARD CUBA

FR Washington: WEIDMANN

TO Buenos Aires: Foreign Ministry

Msg Nr: 501

It is known that the Mexican Foreign Minister was obviously

disturbed by the knowledge of the note sent by the Cuban

Government to the Mexican Government attributing to it partici-

pation in a plot aimed at involving the CASTRO Government int

the plan for the attack on KENNEDY. Because of this, it is

felt that there may be a change in the well?known Mexican

position toward the Cuban problem.
