The Liaison Agent commented that working relations

are good, but there was an area which might not be getting

proper attention.

The Agent stated that there was reason

to be concerned

regarding effective coordination on those

cases which are of interest to both FBI. and CIA because there

appeared to be developing an atmosphere where people in both

Agencies felt that there was now wide-open liberty to conduct,:

operations and activities of a joint nature. The Agent

stated that he wished to emphasize that such an atmosphere

The Agent commented that work in
