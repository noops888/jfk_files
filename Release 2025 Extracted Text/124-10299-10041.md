following highly confidential message:

"The Haitian Government has had to request of Charge

d'Affaires CURTIS the recall of three United States Emassy

DEFICIALS, JOHN WE WARREN, MiLitary Actache, STANLEY D. MOSS

Cultural Attache, and JOHN MASEC ((C)), Political Counsellor.

The State Department replied that the new Ambassador has been

Instructed to discuss this question after he presents his

credentials, but that these officials will not be recalled

unless they are declared personae non grata, and that the State

Department will make reprisals.

Please explain to you know who the necessity of making

The three officials have figured in the arousing of a

frankly hostile feeling toward the Haitian Covernment.

Military Attache WARREN has talked with high-racking officers

of the Haitian Army in an effort to corrupt them and hatch

a plot against this covernment.

noon and night. We suspect that he has some special assignment.

He has talked about it in the course of conversations at the

Hotel El Rancho. Cultural Attache MOSS Is a declared enemy of

the Haitian Government.

The latest number of the magazine

"Actualites", edited by the U.S. Embassy Cultural Service in

memory of KENNEDY'Is an illustration of his spirit of

hostility. At his clear choice only Intellectuals who are

enemies of this Government collaborated on this number. It

contained cables of condolence from many chiefs of state, but

not that of President DUVALIER. There was no mention of the

manifestations of numerous organizations in memory of KENNEDY,

as, for example, the three days of nourning, the funeral

service, ete.

We are requesting the departure also of NORMAN WARNER

because of the categorical position of opposition to this

Goverment which he took during the events of April and May.

Ambassador TIMMONS has produced a bad impression.

He

seems to be the man least fitted to work for a Haitian United

States rapprochement on a durable basis.

We believe It would

be advisable that he be recalled even before he presents his

credentials and that a political personage of blended spirit

who is capable of understanding be designated.

Report Immediately on the result of your demarches."

THEARD is requested to explain to Mr. IRVING the United

States position on recall and reprisals and to keep the Haitian

Government informed constantly

Please (translate Into Englion for Mr. IRVING. [75]
