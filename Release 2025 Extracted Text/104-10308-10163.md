2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

SECRET

10 July 1963

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:

SUBJECT: Requirements Briefing to FBI Informant Going to Cuba

1. In accordance with arrangements previously made with the FBI by

SAS/CI/Liaison, the undersigned went to New York onl8 July to brief an

FBI informant who is going to Cuba for two weeks. I had a short session

at the FBI office in NYC with Dale Schwant, the case officer, and we then

met with the informant for about two hours in a room at the Prince George

Hotel. The informant had been told that I would be at the meeting and that

I represented the Agency, but I was not introduced to him by name.

2. The EBI informant - Victor Thomas * Vicente - is an American-

born Puerto Ricanborn in NYe in f930. He has been under FBI control for

nearly 3 years penetrating the three pro-Castro organizations in NYC: the

Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPCC); the Casa Cuba, and the Jose Marti

Club.: Through the first two years Subject was only a marginal asset, in the

ast six months he nas become a valuable penetration Ior the PB. into th

bove 3 organizations as well as the Cuban UN delegation having apparentl

won the complete confidence of the pro-Castro leaders and Cuban officials

in NYC. Recently he was asked to join the CPUSA. Subject works as a

o triling l acon a ste bale in ant, in that he a earro ce volutionary.

The Cubans have expressed an interest in his moving to Cuba to work. He is

willing to go but his wife is against it, but idea is still alive.

Cuban Sponsorship

3. Subject is leaving NYÃ‡ for Mexico City on 13 July and he expects to

go on to Cuba illegally on 15 July.

The Cuban Ambassador to the UN, Raul

Primellas, has arranged for a Cuban visa to be ready at the embassy in

ir:

armed with a letter of introduction from the National Director of the FPCC,

Vicent Theodore Leel On 6 July the 3 pro-Castro organizations named

above held a party for Subject and raised $100. 00 for his trip.

Informant's Contacts in Cuba

4 Subject will contact several friends in Cuba who are milicianos, one

of them in Santiago, Oriente Province. They were fellow activists in pro-

Castro organizations in NYC who have returned to Cuba. He also has been

given (by his Cuban friends) the address of a family whose son is the chauf-

feur of Carlos Rafael Rodriguez. Arrangements have also been made for

Subject to talk to the American Communist in Habana, Robert Williams.

Subject, who will be accompanied by his wife on this trip, has been instructed

by his Cuban superiors to take a camera with him to take pictures of Cuba for

showing at organizational meetings in NYC. Something similar had been done

previously by the head of the FPCC on his trip to Cuba in December 1962. The

note-taking in connection with the photos will be a device enabling Subject to

record intel information difficult to remember.

5. I briefed Subject during a two hour period using as a guide the attached

requirements outline, prepared withHenry Kitchens, SAS/Intel/Requirements,

and Antia Potocki, SAS/CI/Sov-Sat. I had also discussed Subject's mission to

Cuba with SAS/SO/Rodriguez and DC/SAS/EOB. I stressed, as did the FBI

case officer, that while fully exploiting his militia and other contacts for the

desired information, he must always be guided by security considerations.

After an agent role for three years, Subject expressed confidence in his ability le

a carryig out his mission successfully.

6. I should add that I was very cordially received at the NYC FBI office

and that Mr. Schwant was most cooperative. I referred to our memorandum

to his headquarters indicating that the Agency had a world-wide program to 24

send controlled CP and front penetrations on missions to Cuba, and I expressed

the hope that this might be only our first joint eifort. He agreed wholeheartedly,

adding that he personally would be particularly happy to cooperate if Subject

informant should move permanently to Cuba and play the role of resident agent.

As soon as Subject returns from Cuba Mr. Schwant will let us know and arrange

for the debriefing.
