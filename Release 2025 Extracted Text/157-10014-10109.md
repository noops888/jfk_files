HARVEY passes the pills to ROSELLI in Florida. (47)

Roselli was to give the pills to Varona, who had an

asset in Cuba with access to Castro's restaurant.

At this point Roselli is using Tony VARONA and

"MACEO" as contacts with Cuba rather than Irafficante.

(47-8)

HARVEY, with help of Ted SHACKLEY (Chief of JMWAVE

station in Miami, loaded arms and equipment in a

U-Haul truck which was left in a parking lot for

Roselli, who delivered it to a Cuban contact. (49-50)

Intense contact between HARVEY and ROSELLI. Roselli

reports that pills are in Cuba at the restaurant

frequented by Castro awaiting the opportunity to

use them. (50)

EDWARDS and HOUSTON brief ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERT F.

KENNEDY on PHASE I of the assassination operation. (62a)*

Edwards tells HARVEY of the briefing of RFK. (65)

Harvey says that he briefed HELMS about this and

advised against briefing McCone (DCI) or Carter

(DDCI); Helms agreed. (65)

HARVEY is told by EDWARDS that the "tacit approval"

of the DCI should be obtained if Roselli was to be

used any further. (65) Harvey told Edwards that

Roselli

would not be used any more.

(According to

Edwards' memorandum of 5/14/62.) (42)

ROSELLI tells HARVEY that VARONA has sent three men

to Cuba to recruit others for the pill plot. (51)

Special Group (Augmented) meets on OPERATION MONGOOSE.

HARVEY and MC CONE said that McNAMARA raised the

subject of assassinations at this meeting in regard

to new plans.

General LANSDALE'S memorandum assigns to HARVEY the

drafting of an outline of intelligence, political,

economic, and paramilitary activities for the

implementation of MONGOOSE. The task includes

planning for "splitting the regime, including liquida-

tion of leaders"

* RFK asks to be told before the CIA works with the Mafia again. (62a)

HARVEY writes a memorandum to DDP HELMS saying

that he advised Lansdale's aide FRANK HAND to

excise the words "including liquidation of leaders"

from the LANSDALE memo because of "the inadmissibility

and stupidity of putting this type of comment in

writing in such a document". Harvey also tells Helms

that he has "careful notes"

on MC NAMARA'S discussion

of assassination at the Special Group meeting of

August 10.

Pills still in place; HARVEY learns that VARONA is

ready to send another team to Cuba. (51)

1. In early April Mr. William Harvey asked me to arrange

a contact with Subject. The meeting in New York City was arranged

take no part in future operations proposed for Subject.

2. In the interim I have kept Mr. Harvey fully informed

MEMORANDUM EOR: Deputy Director (Plans)

SUBJECT

: Operation MONGOOSE

1. Action. None. This memorandum is for your information.

2. Reference is made to our conversation on 13 August 1962,

concerning the memorandum of that date from General Lansdale.

Attached is a copy of this memorandum, excised from which are

four woids in the second line of the penultimate paragraph on

page 1. These four words were "including liquidation of leaders."

3. The question of assassination, particularly of Fidel Castro,

was brought up by Secretary McNamara at the meeting of the

Special Group (Augmented) in Secretary Rusk's oifice on 10 August.

It was the obvious consensus at that meeting, in answer to a

comment by Mr. Ed Murrow, that this is not a subject which

has been made a matter of official record. I took careful notes on

the comments at this meeting on this point, and the Special Group

(Augmented) is not expecting any written comments or study on

this point.

4.. Upon receipt of the attached memorandum, I called

Lansdale's office and, in his absence, pointed out to Frank Hand

the inadmissibility and stupidity of putting this type of comment in

writing in such a document. I advised Frank Hand that, as far

as CIA was concerned, we would write no document pertaining to

this and would participate in no open meeting discussing it.

I strongly urged Hand to recommend to Lansdale that he excise

the phrase in question fiom all copies of this memorandum, in-

cluding those disseminated to State, Defense, and USIA. Shortly

thereafter, Lansdale called back and left the message that

he agrced and that he had done so.

Project ZRRIFLE

K371

1

1977

1. Identification: The purpose of Project ZRRIFLE is to spot,

develop, and use agent assets for Division D operations. Agents will be

spotted in

several areas, including the United States, but for operational

security reasons will probably not be used in their countries of residence.

Present developmental activity is being conducted in the WE and EE areas,

but it is anticipated that this will be extended to other division areas. The

project will be operated against third-country installations and personnel.

2. Objectives: The objective of this project is the procurement of

code and cipher materials, and information concerning such materials,

in accordance with requirements levied on the Clandestine Services,

primarily by the National Security Agency. Since these requirements are

subject to frequent revision, no listing. of targets would be valid for the

duration of the project. Specific operations will be mounted on the basis of

need

and opportunity. The project will be conducted by Division D with

assistance from area divisions and stations

as needed.

3. Background: In response to the increasing requirements for the

operational procurement of foreign code and cipher materials, Division D

in 1960 began the spotting of agent assets as a developmental activity.

During the same period requirements from NSA became more refined and in

many respects more sensitive. Because most

stations are not equipped to

conduct this type of operation and because of the desirability of completely

control over this entire effort, it was determined that Division D, which is

in closest touch with NSA on procurement requirements, could best conduct the :

activity.

The spotting activity has now advanced far enough to justify

removing from the OOA category.

4. Operational Assets:

(1) Personnel: QJWIN is under written contract as a principal

agent, with the primary task of spotting agent candidates. QJWIN was first

contacted in 1958 through the Chief of the Luxembourg I.S. by the Chief of

Station, Luxembourg, in connection with an illegal narcotics operation into

the United States. For a

period of a year and a half he was contacted

sporadically by COS, Luxembourg, in behalf of the Bureau of Marcotics.

Files

of this Bureau reflect an excellent performance by QJWIN. In
