Mr. Muldoon contacted Agency employee E. James 03

Mclighe on 22 May 1974.

Mr. Muldoon told Mr. McTighe

that he was nominal Vice President of a Washinoton-based

firm called "Security Consultants

International."

He presented

Mr. McTighe with a report containing the essential data he

possessed concerning WER BELL and other members of FOA whon

ne had met on 17 and 20 May 1974 in Washington,

D.C.

According

to Mr. Muldoon, WER BELL had hopes of establishing gaming

casinos, hotel

and other tourist facilities in Abaco catering

to the U. S. tourist crowd. As a consequence of some run-in

with Prime Minister Pindling of the Bahamas, however, WER BELL

is apparently persona non grata in the Bahamas; hence his

ambitions appeared to be contingent on Abacan independence.

Mr. Muldoon reported that at least on two occasions WER BELL

made a concerted effort to involve persons formerly affiliated

with the Agency in the activities of the FOA in support of

its independence.

On several occasions, WER BELL introduced

Mr. Muldoon and Mr°3(Roussos) as active Agency officials, implying

that either the Agency or the United States Government

supported

and economic terms.

study was to include interviews with citizens of Abaco prior

to an alleged "plebiscite" on independence to take place in

Abaco on 28 June 197403 In default of the collaboration of

elther Muldoon or Roussos, WER BELL hired Mr. Walter Josep!

Mackem, a former Agency

According to WER BELL's file, Mackem later in 1974 contacted

the Agency in an attempt to get an official policy on the

activities of the FOA.

Mackem was informed that the case

comes under FBl Jurisdiction, that this Agency has no official

involvement, and

that

all informatior

we had

on the matter had

been made available to the FBI. He was advised at that time

to report his contacts and any information he had to the FBI.

• On 24 March 1975, Mr. (Joseph P. Hayes) assigned to

SE/PCH, reported that during the week of 9. March 1975, he

talked with Mr. Wesley Dyckman.

Mr. Dyckman is a former Agency

employee employed by the Drug Enforcement Agency. According

to Dyckman, former Agency employee Walter Mackem was employed

in the Washington area as a private investigator.

He is alsc

involved with

a paramilitary activity funded by some unnamed

British source.

The activity, which Dyckman referred to as

is supposedly involved in the paramilitary training of forces

who would participate in this

adventure.

According to Dyckman,

the paramilitary training supposedly was to take place in

Georgia, where WER BELL is based.

8. On 31 August 1974, Mr. (RousSos) met with Mr. K. Michael

Absher, who at that time was AC/E/GC, and told him that

WER BELL was leaving

for Athens on 31 August to sell

arms to

the Greek Government. WER BELL wanted Roussos, to be his

advisor in this venture and to go to Athens 3 (Roussos) told

MI. Absher strongly advised against

•3 (Roussos getting involved in this deal (Roussos, told Mi. Absher

that he understood and agreed not to get involved. (Roussos);

said that WER BELL would probably call him from Athens and he

would give WER BELL a final negative reply.

9. On 22 July 1974, the FBI reported that WER BELL may

be in possession of a one-line note from former CIA Director,

William Colby stemming from a chance meeting with the Director

at an Oss alumni dinner, reading something like "Good to see

you again."

This note was apparently used by WER BELL to

suggest that he and Mr. Colby were good friends. This infor-

mation was passed on to Mr. Colby on 9 August 1974.

10.

According to reporting from several Stations, WER BELL

and

Arthur L. Smith (a cohort of WER BELL'S)

several

Central American countries during August and early September

1962.

Their principal activity appeared to be contacting

officials of the governments of Guatemala, Nicaragua, and

El Salvador for the purpose of obtaining recognition of a

de facto Cuban Government in exile called the "United

Organization for the Liberation of Cuba."

In discussions with

Nicaraguan Government representatives,

WER BELL claimed the

proposed Cuban Government in exile had

the support of 90

separate Cuban exile organizations and 186,000 Cuban exiles.

WER BELL offered

a representative of the Nicaraguan Government

$100,000 to obtain that government's recognition of the Cuban

Government in exile. The group claimed to have its headquarters

at 1025 Connecticut Avenue

NW, in Washington, D.C.

While in

suatemala, smith claimed that the group had a

man in the

Department of State in Washington, D.C., whom they pay $6,000

per year "to keep them advised."

11. In December 1965 WER BELL contacted a Miami DCD

asset and told him that he and six Cuban exiles in the U.S.

had organized a group, including approximately 20 Cubans

inside Cuba, to perform a commando operation in Cuba during

early January 1966., Their primary mission was the assassination

of Fidel Castro, with the secondary mission of blowing up the

generators that

supply electricity to Havana, Cuba.

WER BELL,

at the time, stated that he was trying to get a "green light"

from CIA to proceed with the mission, and inferred that the

mission would be called off if such approval was not obtained.

12. On 7 February 1966 the Miami office of the FBI

reported that WER BELL had been in contact with various news

agencies concerning an alleged plan to assassinate Fidel Castro,

and reportedly also had discussed the plan with Mr. Richard

Phillips, Public Affairs Officer, Department of State, Washington,

D.C. WER BELL claimed to have a

group of some 500 men infiltrated

into Cuba and said that they were ready for action to overthrow

the regime immediately following the assassination of Castro.

According to the FBI, WeR BEll gave the impression that he is

acquainted with many

high government officials, both in the U.S.

and other countries, and implied that his assassination plan

had been approved by CIA.

13. According to a memorandum in WER BELL's file, on 7

February 1968, one Bruce Arman Baker telephoned an employee

of this Agency and said he had been in contact with WER BELL.

Mr. Baker said that WER BELL was in the weapons manufacturing

business and delivered them by air throughout the world.

Mr. Baker said that he understood that WER BELL does this for

CIA.

Mr. Baker said that he understood from WER BELL that he

would have to get a CIA security clearance to fly for WER BELL.

Baker said that he was afraid that his past smuggling record

might keep him from getting a CIA clearance.

13-5

14: WER BEll came to the attention of the Bangkok Station,

in early 1969 when he went to Thailand representing himself

as Vice President of Sionics, Atlanta, Georgia.

He described

himself as a counterinsurgency expert,

had a variety of weapons

to display, claimed to be a retired colonel, and introduced

himself at

a local nightclub as Chief of CIA

in Thailand.

WER BELL attempted

to sell arms to the Thais and

also to a

variety of U.

S. military elements?" (Station

Bangkok passed

the gist of his reputation to key personalities in the U. S.

mission and the Thai Government stressing that he was not

sponsored in any way by the

U. S. Government.

15. WER BELL was also the subject of two memorandum

signed by Lawrence R. Houston.

Mr. Houston, answering a

request from Joseph J. Liebling, Deputy Assistant Secretary

of Defense, on 23 February 1971, denied WER BELL's alleged

affiliation with the CIA.

On 28 October 1971, Mr. Houston

wrote Mr. David H. Henretta, Jr., of the Industrial security

Clearance Review Division, to return notarized Interrogatories

previously sent by Mr. Henretta.
