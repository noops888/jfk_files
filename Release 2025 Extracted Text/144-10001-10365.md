A plot exists to assassinate PAK CHONG-HUI, President

of the Republic of Korea (ROK). on 17 December, the date

of the presidential inauguration. The ROK Central

Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the National Police Bureau are

investigating the plot uncovered by the ROK CIA which holds a

recording of a conversation between two individuals in which

the planned assassination was discussed. No decision has as yet

been reached on whether the two individuals will be arrested at

Army units in the Rio de Janeiro area were placed on

alert on 11 and 12 December and a high command radio

net was ordered to maintain a continuous 24-hour watch.

The "PLANALTO" net, used by high ranking government officials

including the President and ministers of the armed forces,

received its watch orders on 12 December from the Chief of the

Military Cabinet in Brasilia. Very urgent messages from the COS,

First Army and the Commander of First Military Region to various

subordinate units declared situations, "AFIR" and EXAPRES".

B1 Comment:

The above actions probably portend some kind of forth-

coming controversial official statement. On 4 October when

GOULART requested that a state of siege be declared, the Army

declared situations "CRUZ" and "EXTRAORDINAIRIO" •

CAMBODIA

3.

Prince SIHANOUK is highly incensed with the U.S.

Government according to a British report of 12 December

out of Phnom Penh (2030.1). He has drafted a stinging

reply to the American Ambassador's protest over official celebra-

tion by the Cambodian Government of Marshall SARIT's death, which

by implication was linked to that of President KENNEDY. SIHANOUK

also intends to break off U.S./ Cambodian negotiations over the

termination of economic and military aid, giving AID and MAAG

personnel five days to leave Cambodia, withdraw Cambodian Ambassador

NONG KIMNY from Washington, and abandon his proposal for a

conference to guarantee Cambodian neutrality and independence.

(TDCS-3/567,264,12 December 1963 NOFORN: 3/0/CED/T215-63, 1215232)

B2 Comment: SIHANOUK carried out one of the above intentions on

11 December, when the Cambodian Foreign Ministry instructed NONG

XIMNY to immediately return all but one of the embassy personnel.

NONG KIMNY is to leave on the next ship, while the one member of

the embassy being left behind to handle Cambodian students will

stay at the Ambassador's residence while the Chancellery is put

up for rent. It was stated, however, that the withdrawal of

embassy personnel was not to be interpreted at a breach in dip-

lomatic relations with the u.s.

CHINESE COMMUNIST

4.

The British Military Attache in New Delhi has received

reports that the Chinese Communists have pulled back

from the Sino-Indian Border, and the Indian Director

of Military Intelligence continues to send indications of "quiet".

A return to more routine communications within the Tibet Military

Region is substantiated by recent reappearance of practice traffic

on groups serving military authorities in the area. Practice
