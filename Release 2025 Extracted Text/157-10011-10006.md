OCCURRENCE: In discussing the possible methods of accomplishing the mission, sam

Gold suggested that they not resort to firearms, but that"if he could be furnished with :

some type of potent pill that could be placed in Castro's food or drink.

Sam indicated

that he had a prospective nominee in the person of Juan Orta, a Cuban official, who had

been receiving back payments from the gambling interests who still had access to Castro,

and was in a financial bind. Cornelius Roosevelt, Chief, TSD was consulted and assigned

Dr. Raymond Treichler to develop a pill that had the elements of rapid solubility, high

lethal content, and little or no-traceability. Six of these items were produced and-

after being checked out for their effectiveness by Dr. Edward M. Gunn, three pills were

ultimately turned over to Sam for the mission. Neither TSD nor Dr. Gunn was briefed on

the ultimate use of the pills.

base in Nicaragua; (3) the necessity for the Defense Department to supply 38 military

men to CIA. "Mr. Douglas questioned whether the present concept of 600 or 700

Cubans is any longer practicable.

He said that it had been his understanding that

the current thinking contemplated figures more on the order of 3,000."

Mr. Barnes

replied that the CIA believes what is required is enough individuals to serve as

a rallying point for the anti-Castro elements in Cuba and thus 600 is as useful as

3,000.

The CIA justified the request for 38 military men because it now believed

it was necessary to train the Cubans in infantry tactics involved in a defense, in

addition to the guerrilla warfare training previously contemplated.

was to taken an unusually spectacular sea shell that would be certain to catch

CASTRO's eye, load it with an explosive triggerto blow when the shell was lifted,

and submerge it in an area where CASTRO often went skin diving."

FITZGERALD explored this idea at several sessions with SAM HALPERN and BRUCE

as impractical. (77).

When HARVEY was asked if the multipurpose-use included assassination, he stated-that-if

he had ever been directly ordered to perform an assassination, he would have considered the

neople spotted by &.J.Win as possibilities. (50)

He testified that before someone would have

actually been approached to carry out that operation, there would have been a long period of

assessment and cross checks. As far as he knew, the particular spotting mechanism never went

that far.

So far as HARVEY

certain steps to have an assessment of assets in that connection. (57) Harvey

clarified that the wording of the memo probably meant that consideration should be

given to the question of how, whether and under what circumstances the DCI should be

officially advised of his program, "I want to make it clear that this in no way

means he should be advised.

In response to the increast noireen sothe operation tent

code and cipher materials, division d in 1960 began spotting of agent assets as

ity. During the same period requirements from NSA became more

refined and in many respects more sentative because most agencies are not equipped

to conduct this type of operation, and because of the desirability to completely centralize

control over this entire effort, it was determined that division d which was the closest-

touch with NSA on procurement requirements, could best conduct the activity. The spotting

activity has now advanced far enough to justify removing from the OOA category. (exhibit

EARMAN's cover memorandum the ribbon copy, which was the only text of the report in existence, thi

interrogation of Pedro Roig, the Cuban economic official who defected to Mexico,where

he can be surfaced to mäke public charges of Cuban Communist operations against Latin

American nations. Harvey was to generate a story from Cuban refugee sources that the

original Cardenas incident consisted of a demonstration concerning the shortage of food.

This was to cause ridicule of the Communist regime's use of MIGs, tanks and troops against

the unarmed people of Cardenas: "The-Cuban-source to story-need not-await your determina-

OCCURRENCE:

With regard to paragraph 2 of Lansdale's memorandum to SGA dated 14 Nov.

1962 Harvey states:

"The statement that Operation Mongoose had had no intormation on

this operation since early October was patently false. Specific references made to the

pen ultimate paragraph and Lansdale's memorandum concerning a report for the CIA which he

used as a basis for memorandum dated 31 Oct. 1962 to Oswald Kirkpatrick. This refers to

a telephonic conversation on the evening of 30 Oct. 1962 between Lansdale and Cheever

which is referred specifically in paragraph 2 on pages 7 and 8 of my reference memorandu.

I have discussed this matter in detail with Cheever and clearly recollects that his

conversation with Lansdale on that date took place as reflected in my reference memorandum.

During this conversation there was no discussion of previous operations except a brief

Jiscussion of the COBRA and AMTORLD/teams and Lansdale did not ask, according to Cheever's

recollection, any specific questions concerning assets inside or prior operations which

as or ording on Cheever's
