MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE

SUBJECT:

The Board convened In meeting at 9:00 a.m.,

on November 3,

Board members Gray, Doolittle, Murphy and Clifford vere present as

were Mr. Coyne and

the writer.

(Messrs, Pace and Langer were out

of the country at the time of this meeting. Illness prevented Dr.

Land's

attendance.)

Dr. Baker inforned the Board that Messrs. Coyne and Ash had

a unique assembly of material for the Board's use in considering

the intelligence aspects of the sovlet missiles tailaup In cuba.

Dr. Baker expressed the view that the materials which had been

far too complicated for the Board to consider in the

course of only one day, and therefore the Board would look to

Mr. Coyne and Mr. Gray

for selective reporting to the Board con-

cerning the highlights of the coverage which had been

accomplished

thus far in the Board's review of the cuba situation.

Dr. Baker observed thai the contlict involving Cuba 1s an

the SA-2 sites in Cuba. Furthermore,

such elementary things as the support facilitles which serve the

SA-2 Installations:

tained, it appears that except for Moscow and Leningrad the island

of Cuba

Is now equipped with the best air defense system in the

world.

It is possible that cuba is now on the verge of insuring

against invasion by reason of its possession of an assembly of the

nost dangerous armaments which have heretofore been collected In

Dr. Baker said that he

does not know how much the president is aware of these things, but

there is a serious proposal being discussed which would contemplate

one of two Inspections a month, whereas we well know that within

72. hours there can be made operational a most dangerous offensive

capability.

Mr. Murphy wondered what spectfically had caused the d cision

to be made to transfer from CIA to SAC the responsibility for re-

connaissance of Giba.

Mr. Miphy thought that an undirstanding of

responsibillty is: important because

the Board 1tself seemed to have been oblivious to developments

which were of such a nature as to warrant the stepped-up coverage

Mr. Gray's comment on this was to the effect that he had

noted an uncertainty In the past with regard to whether the problem

of Criba had been removed from the Board's area of responsibility.

Vr. Gray recalled remarks by. the Chalrnan at a Board meeting last

Indicating that the Cuba situation was being looked at else-

Therefore, Mr. Gray thought that If In fact

be made clear

for the benefit of the Buard.

In Mr. Gray's opinion If the Board

In fact had such a responsibillty, then the Board should have been

addressing Itself to the implications of public statements

such as

those being made by Senator Keating and others, and particularly

statement by.

Senator Keating on October 10: 1962, that ballistic

missile installations

were being constructed in Cuba.

Acting Chairman Baker Informed

the Board that he had confirmed

wi.th

the Chairman that the Chairman's remarks at the last summer's

Board meeting were intended. to convey that It was only in the

NSC. 5412/2 area that Cuba matters where being handled outside the

purview of the Board.

Continuing,

Mr. Gray said that it was a matter of personal

regret to him that

the, public statements by Senators Keating,

Humphry and others had not served to flag the situation.

Mr. Coyne said that following that line of reasoning he him-

self could be said to have been at fault.

Mr. Coyne went on to

poirt out in this connection that senator Keating and others were

speaking from:the benefit of Executive Branch briefings which they

hid received,

Including General Carter's briefing of the Republican

Policy Committee.

In any case,

the Senators had only Information

which was in

the possession of the Executive Brarch.

Insofar as

this information was based on foreign Intelligence acquisitions,

Mr. Coyne pointed out that all of the U.S, foreign Intelligence

agencies are under instruction and have an obligation to furnish

the Board witl: all significant information derived from the

foreign Intelligence effort, and If such instructions and under-

standings were not in effect the Board would be in the position

of having to dig out: the Intelligence Information which the

agencies are obligated

to provide to the Board on a systematic

In the case of the developing Cuban situation, however,

Coyne pointed out that a top level decision was made to give

limited distribution of intelligence information on Cuba and

Board was excluded from those elements of the government which

were designated to receive 1t.

He described this particular recommendation as being a "ross.

suggestion.

this point Mr. Cllfford, reverting to the discussion

on the Hanson Baldwin matter,

asked whether a separate Investi-

gative unit 1s being established as recommended by

in lleu of the referral

of leaks for Investization by the FBI.

Mix. McCone responded that this natter 1s still under considera-

tion; that in his own office he 1s prepared to set up such a

unit; that he and the President feel this action must be taken;

there 1s growing concern in some quarters that the

creation of such a unit might ultimately lead to the establish-

ment of some kind of internal Gestapo.

Mr. McCone next turned to the subject of Cuba.

late July there was first witnessed an increased tempo

of soviet bloc shipments to Cuba, and by August the rate of

shipments had more than doubled.

On August 10, 1962 there was

held a meeting of Principals (the President not participating)

to discuss Cuban operations which had taken place during the

preceding months of 1962.

Up to that time there had been an.

exploratory intelligence

effort primarily aimed at providing

a basis for deciding what covert actions could be taken

against the Castro regime.

The results of this Intelligence

effort had been reflected in reports appearing in the Central

Intelligence Bulletin and in Items which were set forth in the

Presidential Check List.

At that time, Mr. McCone said, he

analyzed: the develooments in Cuba as Indicating .1 the establlsh-

ment of a sophisticated SIGINT operation to be directed against

our space activities at Camp Canaveral, (2, the establishment

of a comprehensive air defense system, or (3) the introduction

of a MRBM capability,

or possibly alt

However, no one

shared Mr. Mclone's feeling that the soviet activities in cuba

were directed toward the establishment of a ballistic missile

capability:

On the contrary, the Department of State and the

Office of National Estimates

within the CIA considered that such

action by the Russians would be a departure from establlshed

soviet policy.

Mr. McCone

said that throughout August a careful watch

was maintained with respect to developments in cuba, and in

late Aurist the construction of SAM sites was detected.

By August 23, when er. Necone left the country (on his

moor.) , there

obtained photographic evidence of the

construction of seven SAM sites together with evidence of

extreme security measures being taken with respect to the

unloading of ships at Cuban ports.

These developments, Mr.

MoCone, related, gave ris to considerable worry on his part,

and prior to his departure from the country, on Auzust 23,

he took the occasion on August, 21, 22, and 23 to express

worry to

the president and to the

Secretary of Defense.

Mr. McCone acknowledged

that he had no positive evidence to

support his concern, but he reasoned that the extensive air

defense buildup which was underway in Cuba had as-its Immediate

purpose the denial of the surveillance by the United States of

the Sovlet missile buildup in Cuba.:

The U-? photography which

was being obtained reflected that

26 SA-2 s1 tes would be

Installed. In Cuba.

Mr. McCone observed that while the photo-

•graphy obtained at the time did not provide evidence of misslie

sites, a current review of that photography indicates the

presence of tents and some construction equipment.

Mr. Mc-

Cone said that when he left the country on August

23, he

instructed that a dally CIA bulletin be initlated at once with

respect to Cuban developments,

and he Initlated. Issuance of

this reporting after consultation with the USIB.

When in September

an Incident was created by the U-? which

"wandered" over soviet

territory, and also when the U-? was shot down over Communist

China on September &, these incidents caused Mr. MeCone to be

Nevertheless, overflights were ordered. It developed,

however, that from September 17 to September 20, weather con-

At about that time the Speclal NSC 5412/2 Group, as well

as the ClA, became convincea

that some risk was Involved In

she conduct of U-2 operationg over-Cuba:

for that reason,

Mr. McCone

said, the flights which were scheduled were of

peripheral nature. Four flights were authorized and flowm

1n late September and in early October, but because of their

perichera, or semi-peripheral character they did not cover the i

area of Cuba.

Mr. McCone recalled that in early

October there had been seen refugee reports concerning mysterious

shipments being transported over Cuban roads, and there were

other things of this nature reported by refugees.

As reflected in the SNIE dated September 19, 1962, Mr.

McCone said that the USIB dismissed the possiblilty that MRBMs

were being Introduced Into Cuba, and this view was based on

the bellef that such introduction would confront the USSR with

so many difficulties that the action would not be undertaken.

Mr. McCone sald that he was in France when he received a sum-

mary of the SNIE,

and he disagreed with 1ts conclusicas because

he could not see why the Soviets were establishing such 'a

comprehensive air defense system In Cuba unless this was being

done to shield the 1sland agalrist U.S. surveillance and to

protect the conduct of some clandestine operation.

was later obtained as a result of the October 14 mission.

Mr.

McCone said that on September 7 he made a recommendation

that more frequent flights be conducted, and it continues to

be. Mi.

McCone's view that there should have been more in-

tense U-2 coverage during September.

Mr. Clifford

asked why and from where was there concern

a possible U-2 Incident Involving Cuba.

Mr. McCone said

that this vlew was held within the NSC 5412 Group and In CIA

Mecone said that he held a different view but

at the time. He cited as a current example of

concern attaching

to the possibillty of U-2 Incidents the fact

that today the Speclal Group considered a U-2 flight over

China-India border, and great concern was expressed in the

Group because the mission would have to include an overflight

of Burma,

and the prospect of the Burma overflight creating

U-2 Incident was a matter of considerable sensitivity

within the Group.

Mr. McCone said that such concern with respect to

Cuba does not exist today and, as

a matter of fact, on that

missions against cuba.

Mr. Cilfford made the comment that he feared that, the

Board might pussibly be subjected to criticism in the light

of the fact that there was no photographic reconnaissance over

Cuba between September 5 and October 14, despite the DCI's

own suspicions. and. the content of refugee reports with respect

to a soviet missile buildup in cuba.

Mr. Murphy: Inquired of Mi. McCone as to whether clandestine

answered by saying that there have been three rather Ineffective

teams operating in Cuba with the principal objective of organizing

dissidence against the Castro regime rather than obtaining

Intelligence. He said that there are approximately 40 third-

country agents plarted in various foreign embassies In Cuba, but

we obtained no hard intelligence from them regarding the military

bulldup.

ports.

Mr. Murphy wondered what had been the inspiration for

the commitment not to Invade Cuba.

Mr. McCone supposed that

this resulted from a Russian offer to do certain things In

return for things which they asked for.

Mr. Clifford asked whether 1t 1s possible for the United

States to develop Intelligence sources In Cuba which would

relleve our dependence upon photographic intelligence.

McCone sald that this 1s difficult to do primarily because

Castro had Instituted a police state in Cuba and, as an example

of this, Mr. McCone cited the practice of the Castro regime

and he has hau under review the question

as to whether

and consideration 1s being given as

At this point Mr. McCone's visit with the Board terminated

and the Board recessed for lunch.

At 1:45 p.M., General Carroll, Director of the Defense

Intelligence Agency, joined the Board meeting.

General Carroll

said that In an attempt to anticipate the specific matters

which the Board might be interested, he had prepared some

materlals regarding the cuban situation

over the period from

last summer up to October 14 and thereafter.

He sald that

the extreme pressures which had prevalled,

the requirement

for da!ly presentations to top level officials. concerning the.

progress of the cuban situation, had made 1t impossible for

him to complete a detailed survey up to this time, out that

a survey was in process within the dIA.
