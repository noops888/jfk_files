SUMMARY OF AGENCY EMPLOYMENT
JAMES W. MCCORD, JR.
Service with the Central Intelligence Agency began on 22
Angust 1951 and continued through-31 August 1970. During his
career there was a variety of assignments involving investigations,
research and report writing, technical and physical security programs
and a two year tour overseas.
"As an investigator during the first two years of employment,
there was wide involvement in a variety of support activities requiring
initiative and ingenuity.
During the seven years engaged in research and report writing,
there was much independence of action and success depended on
initiative, imagination and resourcefulness in pioneering new areas
of interest. Beginning in May 1957, managerial responsibilities
began with appointment to a Deputy Chief position of a research staff
of some six professional and clerical personnel.
When serving overseas, responsibilities were managerial in
nature as Chief of a regional staff of some ten professional and
clerical personnel providing a full spectruin of security support.
From August 1964 to June 1965 he attended the Air War
College as representative of the Agency.
Since 1965 two vital line positions were held involving the
Agency's programs in the technical and physical security fields.
In heading up the technical security division, from 1965 to
1963, he had primary supervisory responsibility for some 40
professional and clerical personnel, preparing the budget and pro-
grams for the Agency's technical security program, and managing
the obligating of authorized funding to assure that approved programs
and goals were met. He was instrumental in guiding the development
of new approaches, in establishing new training concepts and in
bringing the Agency to a position of recognized leadership in this
fielć.

Since October 1968, as Chief of a division responsible for
the Agency's physical security program he had primary responsibility
for the supervision of some 70 professional and clerical personnel,
together with the programming, budgeting and implementing of the
total physical security program of the Agency. As a result of his
technological experience, he developed and implemented physical
security programs which produced for the Agency a physical security
posture of pre-eminent quality within the US Government.

From early December 1965 through May 1966, Messrs. James W. McCord,
Jr., Alan F. Petit, and William M. Marcy of the Technical Division, Office
of Security, conceived and developed a unique technique for the use of a
small portable X-ray machine which has been placed in extensivo use in
the Agency's Audio-Countermeasures Program. Experimentation during these
months indicated that X-ray combined with a fluorescopic screen had distinct
advantages in terms of time and effort over the considorably more expen-
sive X-ray film and processor. Along with this, they designed an innova-
tion in the form of a fluoroscopic cloth which has the distinct advantage
of flexibility over the fluorescent screens currently available on the
commercial market.
The combination of the X-ray and the fluorescent cloth make it pos-
sible to rapidly scan in "real time" large wall surfaces and furnishings,
a capability the Agency has not had before.
The Technical Division has greatly enhanced the world-wide use of
this equipment in that they designed and developed a packaging plan whore-
by using two attache cases they are able to easily transport the X-ray
fluoroscopic equipment, wall racks, and motor units making it possible to
inconspicuously carry it into offices, residences, and safehouses.
These men have shown initiative, ingenuity and great imagination in
the application of fluoroscopic scanning with X-ray.
This technique, much of which required many off-duty hours to develop,
has greatly enhanced the Agency's capability to detect clandestine micro-
phones and other devices
