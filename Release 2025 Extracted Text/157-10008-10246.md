Interview Summary:

Bissell "out of the blue" asked P.D. to read

and comment upon Zoogby's Cuban operations paper.

P.D. told Bissell that the paper/proposals "stunk"

(... "much like another Bay of Pigs"). Appar-

ently, Helms also read and liked P.D. 's comments.

After Bissell "left", Helms requested that P.D.

come on board as his staff assistant.

P.D. stressed that he was not in the opera-

tional line of command -

"I provided an interface

for intelligence information."

A typical day in

P.D. 's life:

- Screening cable traffic (7 - 9 a.m.).

Primarily cables relating to positive in-

telligence, to prepare Helms for his daily

9 a.m. hour-long meeting with DCI McCone.

"one of the strongest proponents of compartmentali-

zation and need to know"

In addition, Harvey had

a law degree and a successful FBI stint prior to

joining the Agency.

Harvey had a thyroid problem.

As one of the

"CIA's most interesting characters", Harvey was

often talked about; P.D. has difficulty separating

personal experience from rumors.

Describing

Harvey as a "four martini man at lunch"

which, coupled with Harvey's thyroid medicine,

caused Harvey to be sleepy, etc., after lunch.

In

fact, P.D. told us that this was the "last straw"

in McCone's eyes; i.e., apparently when McCone

called Harvey in to

"discuss" the Kennedys' com-

plaints about Harvey's utterings, it was immediately

after lunch and Harvey either fell asleep or failed

to pay attention.

("McCone did not have an audience."

P.D. added that there was general "bad chemistry"

between McCone and Harvey.

"D. noted Harvey's intense loyalty to "his people'
