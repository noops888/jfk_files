SECRET

SUBJECT: Release of Information on Mexico City Teltaps

1. Protection of sources and methods and liaison equities

require that references to the Mexico City Station teltap

activity be excised from

any documents released under the

auspices of the JEK Assassination Record Collection Act of 1992.

While the teltap activity mentioned in the documents under review

occurred some thirty plus years ago, the joint tetap operation,

with Mexican liaison has never been terminated; it continues to?

this day in a slightly different form.

Release of any information that would constitute

official USG acknowledgment of the existencerof the joint teltap.

operation would have a serious adverse impact on current

operations.

Relations between the Station and the liaison

service would be affected, with the likely outcome of a

discouraging liaison from cooperating in similar ventures in the

future with Mexico City Station.

Official acknowledgment of the

existence of the joint teltap in the 1960's would embarrass the

liaison service given Mexico's strong brand of nationalism and L

sensitivity towards the issue of sovereignty vis a vis the United

States.

The service probably would terminate its cooperation r

with the Station on the current joint teltap operation in order..

Â¿to be able to defend itself against domestic critics
