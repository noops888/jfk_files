FIDEL stated, "Events are demonstrating the sinister plot

behind the assassination of KENNEDY. Contradictions show that

OSWALD was made the culprit by the police or was prepared to

commit the act with promise of escape, and was assigned activities

so as to have responsibility fall on or be insinuated against

those whom the perpetrators wished. It is clear that United

States reactionaries tried to make Cuba and the world the victims

of their criminal designs, even at the price of assasinating

their own president.

They sent OSWALD to Mexico to request

requested from the nearest European country and not have to come

to Cuba to later go to the USSR, which is much farther."

He also said, "By 1970 we will be in condition to surpass

10 million tons of sugar and to export it. The economy begins

to improve solidly. We have sugar sold at close to 10 centavos

for 1965 and 1966. There shortly will be a notable increase in

meats and other articles.

At the year's end, nougats, wine

and grapes will reappear

as the result of the development of

foreign trade.
