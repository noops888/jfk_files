Henry Winston has said that Sixon's policy, aimed at expansion of the war in Cambodia
Laos and other areas areas of Indo-China, is actually the racialist policy of American

Henry Winston has has ezphasized tha that the policy of the present-cay government of the
United States becomes increasingly ly tenacing. Henry Winston said this policy leads to
intensification of racism and anticommunism as component parts of the programme, aimed
at elimination of the resistance to the governments line'.

Current reprisals against civil right fighters are only the beginning of a campaign
which was launched with with the aim of breaking the resistance of the Negro people.
This campaign is now spearheaded against Angela Davis, a symbol of struggle against
racism and anticommunism. These reprisals, if they are hot duly rebuffed, will
