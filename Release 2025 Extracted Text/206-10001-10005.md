MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE

SUBJECT:

Meeting of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory

Board, Apr11 23, 1963

Ine Board met

at 9:00 a.m., Apr11 23, 1963: in the Boora's

offices, Room 297, Executive OffIce Building, at the call of the

Chairman, Dr. Killian. Present were Board members Doolittle,

Murphy, Clifford, Gray, Baker, Pace, Langer and Land, and Messrs.

Coyne and Ash.

Dr. Killian opened the meeting with the observation that when

the DCI joined the Board meeting later In the day, Evard members

should be prepared to discuss with Mr. McCone the lutter's April 15,

1963, submission to the President of commento In response to the

14 recommendations made in the Board's March & report on Cuba.

The Chairman asked Mr. Coyne to give the Board a brief oral

summary of the DCI's April 15 submission to the President. Mr. Come

did so by reveating for the information

of the Board members the

comment's which he had provided to Mi. Bundy in a memorandum dated

AprIl 22, 1963, In response to Mr. Bundy's request that he be

furnished Mr. Coyne's own reaction (not that of the Board) to the

DCI's communication to the President.

Briefly referring to his visit to the NPIC quarters at

the Naval Gun Factory,

General Doolittle noted that the facillty has considerable room for expansion and

the activity 1s being carried on there under greatly Improved conditions. The f

Department of Defense personnel contingent which is housed at the facility operates

as a self-contalned unit. Mr. Lundahl, Director of the NPIC, reports that although

the facility does not possess ustficient manpower to handle a double load which might

be Imposed should two emergency situations occur simultaneously, he nevertheless

feels that the space and equipment expansion now under way at the new quarters would

accommodate the additional personnel who would be required in such

situation.

At the Chairman's request, Mr. Murry briefly informed the Board concerning

the meeting which he and Mr. Gray and Mr. Coyne had recently with Mr. Cord Meyer

•of CIA on the subject of covert action programs. Mr. Murphy pointed out that

Mi. Meyer's briefing covered operations In Latin American countries, but the subject

of Cuba was excluded Inasmuch as that subject was to bé covered at today's Board

meeting. Mr. Murphy said the briefing consisted primarily of light touches in-

cluding information on the China frontier situation. Nothing new was brougit up

with respect to Furope or the Middle East, Mr. Murphy said: The CIs briefing

reflected the existence of positive evidence that the entourage of the Brazilian

President Goulart 1s communist-penetrated.. Mr. Murpby observed that this briefing

had been presented by CIA at the request of Mr. Murphy und Mr. Gray, and It was

Mr. Murphy's Impression that the briefing was rather routine in nature, and therefore

seemed to downgrade the Importance which the Board attrches to the subject of covert

action operations and requirements.

DI. Land observed that fron his experience, every time that secrecy is used

as a cloak for an assumed efficient but sensitive operation, one may well later

find on removal of the cloak that there was nothing there.. Di. Land thought that

wish then the board should take steps to insure that it recelven full and digificant

brieflngs from the agencies concerned.

In this connection Mr. Clifford asked

whether there was any limitation at all on the Board's right to know about these

matters.

Di. Killian replied that there were no limitations and that this is well

established.

"r. Coyne Informed the Board at this foint about the telephone call which had

been received from the office of the DoI the preceding day, Mi. Kickpatrich of

CIA had conveyed the DCI's wish that the scheduled CIA briefing of the Boara today

on certain clandestine operations be conducted in the absence of Mr. Cottrell,

Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, Bureau of Inter-merican Iffairs, who kri MeCone

understood was

to join the Board meeting at the sane time the CLA briefing was to

ve siven. Tue basis for the DI's request was the fact that coriain aspests of the

CIA briefing to be given on clandestine óperations with respect to. Cuba involve

cövert action operntions which Mr. Cottrell 1s not privy to. No. Come noted that:

the Bue a's agenda had been revised to acconmodate the DoI's request, although

Mr. Corne found the request to be sonowat surprising in view of the responsiblities

which have been assigned to li. Cottrell by the Wilte house for coordination for

all matters relating to Cuba.

NI. Gray observed that if at today's meeting the Board in fact received a

full story concerning clandestine and covert actions being planned ana executed

under CIA auspicee, this would certainly constitute a milestone In the Board's

efforts. along this line. Dr. land thought the Board should tale the position that

unless the ClA briefing presents a full story, the briefers shoula be asked to

continue until the Board has received a full picture. Mi. Clifford thought thạt

the better procedure to follow would be for the Beard to listen to the CIA briefing

01l1ty that on the occasion of the Cin briefing today, pertinent questions regarding

Cuba should be pressed with the briefers. Mi. Clifford observed that If the Board

At 10:15 a.m., the Director of Central Intelligence, Mc. Mccone,

joined the board meeting, accompanied by Mesors, Kirkpatrick,

Fitzgeraid and Clark. Referring to events of the past twenty-four

nours, the DOI expressed satisfaction that

the u.s./Cuba prisoner

exchange nac included

the return to the U.s: of the 3 senior CIA

personnel who had been imprisoned in Cuba early In the Castro regime

when they were caught In the act of bugging the Chinese Communist

mission in Cuba.

Mr. McCone said that the exchange which the attorney

Donovan had worked out with Castro called for the relcase of 22

Americans

in exchange for the return to cuba of Molina (Castro body-

guard) who was in the custudy of Neir York authorities following the

slaying of an Argentine girl in a night club, and the 3 Cubans vino

were under federal indictment in New York on sabotage charges. The

DCI said that he personally negotiated w1th Governor Rockefeller

the release of Molina, and that the Attorney General handled the

release of the other three Cubans.

In answer to a questior: from Mr. Murphy, the DCI stated inat

the terns of the exchange agreement were not of a nature to illect the

conduct of present or future U.S. intelligence and covert action oper-

ations with respect to Cuba. Mr. Mocone added that Castrodid not

seek any conditions other than the release of the 4. Cubans being held

In the Ü.S. Mr. McCone thought 1t Interesting that Castro had pressed

for no conditions involving U,s. polley towald Cuba, and had sought

no assurances regarding U.s, aerial surveillance, espionage operations,

milltary policy, or anything else. Vallejo, Castro's assistant, told

to certain aspect of intelligence coverage of Cuba

Mr. Clark stated that during the perlod February 15 to Apy11 20, 1953 the

¿oviets have removed approximately 4,700 personnel from Cube.

Ci believes that most

of the 4,700 Sovlet personnel vere milltary people vecause of their age and appearance

und because there 1s little likellhood that the soviets rould be removing economic :

personnel from Cuba. CIA estimates that only 500 or 600 Soviets have arrived during

this pertod, and CIA reasons that the 4,700 sovlets who have been withdraw are

miltary personnel who have completed tours of dutj, Including some entire logistic

.CIl estinates that this leaves In. Cuba Suriet personnel totaling on the

order of "12,000 plus" Mr. Clark said that the vallalty of the later figure

depends on the validity of the original estimated total of 17, 500 Soviet personncì

1n Cuba, a figure which has arrived at on a strict table of organization basis,

taking Into account the estimaled number of persons logically required to operate

the equipment which has been doserved in Cube. In the opinion of l. Clark, the

estinated floure of 4, 700 sovicü witharavalo 1s far sounder than the previous

estimate of 17, 500 total personnel in Caba.

DIo Killian asted whether there is evidence of re-introduction of soviet

military personncl into cuba and their deployment end concealment by means of

camouflage.

Mi. Clark said that in view of the redundency of the high altitude

coverage and the fact that nothing has been seen In photography since November 1962,

evidence is to the contrary.
