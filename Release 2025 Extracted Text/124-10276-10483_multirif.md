The following represents the writer's

recollection

of testimony given this date before the Senate Select Committee

(SSC) pursuant to subpoena. The session commenced at 10 a.m.

former

5/21/75 in Room 607, Caroll Arms Hotel:

Present was Senator

Robert Morgan (North Carolina); Lester B. Seidel, Staff Member;

Mr. Jack Smith, Staff Member; Mr. John Bailey, Assistant

Minority Counsel, and a male reporter. Senator Morgan placed

the writer under oath. Approximately four or five minutes later

Senator Morgan excused himself with a general statement to

the effect he had other pressing matters. The entire proceedings

with only two exceptions were conducted by Lester B. Seidel.

Seidel explained the writer was entitled to counsel,

had the privilege of invoking provisions of the Fifth Amendment,

and would have the privilege of making an opening and closing

statement. Seidel inquired whether the writer understood his

G-rights and the Committee's rules and regulations, a copy of

which he had made available.

I !

The writer acknowledged receipt of the Committee's

rules and regulations as furnished by Seidel at 9:31 a.m.

5/21/75. He also acknowledged he had been informed of the right

'to

to constitute a grand jury and in the absence of any charges

or allegations of a violation of law on his part, he did not

insist on the presence of counsel

Seidel was advised as a former Special Agent the

writer had contacted the Bureau's Legal Counsel Division and

as of this date had been advised by Mr. Paul Daly thereof that

he had been cleared by the Attorney General (AG) to testify

to matters relating to investigation of Martin Luther King, Jr.,

Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and Stanley

Levison.

"Seidel was advised that during his interview of the

writer in Atlanta, Georgia, on 5/12/75 he had asked a question

as to how long after the assassination of King did the telephone

surveillance continue on the King residence. On 5/12/75 the

writer responded it was his recollection this coverage continued

until a short time subsequent to the assassination. Following

that interview, the writer recalled that either shortly before

or shortly after that case was assigned to the writer, the King

family had moved from one residence to another and that

continuation of the telephone surveillance from the former

residence to the latter one was not authorized. Secondly,

Seidel on 5/12/75 had asked when the King and SCLC cases were

2

## Page 4

assigned to the writer, the writer recalled such assignment

was in the early part of 1965; that it was now the writer's

recollection this assignment was made in May, 1965.

"Set forth below are questions asked by Seidel (unless

otherwise indicated) and the writer's answers. These questions

and answers are not set forth chronologically.

"Q. Why was continuance of the telephone surveillance

not continued to the Kings' new residence?

'A. Continuance was not authorized by the AG.

"Q. What telephone surveillance was there conducted by

Atlanta of Stanley Levison?

"A. There was no such coverage per se only such as afforded

by contacts made of King or members of the SCLC staff by

Levison.

•Q. Was there telephone surveillance of Levison in New York?

"A. Any contacts of King by Levison while in New York would

have been covered.

"Q. Did the New York Office maintain telephone surveillance

of Levison?

"A. I do not directly know.

iQ. During the Atlanta interview you indicated you had read

New York reports concerning Levison. Is that correct?

## Page 5

"A. Yes.

"Q. During Atlanta interview you indicated you presumed

these reports set forth information concerning Levison from

a telephone surveillance. Is that correct?

¡A. Yes.

Q. What was the basis for your presumption?

'A. The appropriate administrative portion of such report

would have so indicated.

"Q. What evidence of CP connections did your investigation

develop concerning Levison?

"A. None.

"Q. What information did you have establishing CP connection

re Levison?

"A. Such information as was set forth in what was then referred

to as a characterization of Levison. Such characterization was

a part of each report submitted to the Bureau.

Q. What was the nature of this characterization?

'A. I do not remember the precise language. It is my recollection

the statement was brief and set forth information establishing

past and/or present CP affiliation by Levison.

Q. Where did you obtain this characterization?

À. A characterization of an individual or organization at

that time was prepared by the field office concerned, submitted

4

to Bureau Headquarters for its approval, and such was made

available to offices having a need-to-know this information.

Q.

What was the source of this information regarding levison.

'A.

I do not recall that I was ever, apprised thereof. A

characterization would not indicate the source of the information,

unless public source information was utilized, otherwise the

reliability or lack thereof of the source or sources would be

indicated but not their identity.

"Q. What prompted you today to amend your answer on May the 12th

i75 as to how long telephone surveillance continued on the King

residence? Did you seek the advice or an answer from someone?

". A to tie extent that subsequent to May the 12th I conferred

with a former Agent, Charles Harding, Prior to that time which- it

had concerned me, that my initial ans to that guesson did not

impress me as being completely correct. I mentioned this to

Harding and he informed me that my answer was incorrect and

mentioned the change in the King residence and the fact coverage

had not been thereafter authorized. When he informed me of

this I immediately récalled the change in residence which

previously had escaped my memory.

Q. Why would Harding know this information?

:

MA.

For a period of time he was in a supervisory capacity.

IQ. Was he in a supervisory capacity when the change in

residence was made?

'A. He was in a relief supervisory capacity at that time.

"Q. Why did you rely on Harding's recollection? Is his recollection

better than yours?

"A. I am not suggesting his recollection is better or worse

than mine. What he said to me merely served to jog my memory

upon which I based my earlier statement today.

Q. You recall when I interviewed you in Atlanta most of

my questions were taken leum prepared notas?

"A. Yes.

"Q. You recall that I told you that I would make notes during

the interview in order that I might later refresh my recollection

7

as to your testimony.

"A. Yes, and Mr. Seidel, you recall that I did not take any

notes (to which he answered in the affirmative).

"Q. Did you make any recording of that interview at the time?

IA. I did not.

"Q. Did you make any subsequent written recording of the

interview?

I realize that you have the perogative of subpoenaing it.

In the absence thereof, I prefer not to make it available.

"Q. How long after King's assassination did the telephone

surveillance of SCLC continue?

"A, I cannot be certain It continued for a period of time

which may have been one, two, possibly three months. I simply

do not remember.

"Q. Who handled SCLC and Levison case after you left the Bureau?

who you understood to have some type of CP connections?

'A. There was Hunter Pitts O'Dell, Bayard Rustin, and Harry

Q. How did you know of whatever their CP affiliation may

have been?

"A. In the same manner as in regard to Levison.

teletypes in the file..

"Q.

What was the fist of such communications?

"A. Advisement that such installation had been authorized,

instructions to initiate the coverage.

"O. Who installed the surveillances, Al Miller; was he not a

technician, a wireman?

"A. Your answer to that question is not entirely correct.

Alden Miller was an Atlanta Agent who had certain technical

ability. It is my recoilection the surveillance was installed

by an Agent who was not from the Atlanta Office. I do not

remember his name.

Q. Did you monitor any of these surveillances?

"A.

No.

Q. Did you monitor any such surveillance during this period

of time?

during this period?

Bureau.

Qo William Sullivan, who was formerly connected with intelligence

conversation was held; during which reference was made to a

wonderful sermon they had preached together on somebody's

kitchen floor.

"Q. Kitchen floor?

"A. Yes.

"Q. What surreptitious entry was made in respect to the King

residence or SCLC headquarters?

'A. During the period I was concerned with these cases there

was none..

'Q. Supposing an Agent wanted some item from either location

to use against King of SCLC. Would he not have made a surreptitious

entry to obtain it?

"A. No such entry was made at any time to my knowledge. I say

• this very firmly because the Bureau policy before the late

1950s concerning such a technique had changed.

"Q. (By. Jack Smith) What do you mean by saying this policy

had changed?

'A. During my period with the Bureau, from the beginning, such

activity had to be approved by the Bureau, With reference to

surreptitious entry?

A. Mr. Seidel, as I stated earlier I have been informed that

I was released by the AG to testify before this Committee

concerning King, SCLC, Stanley Levison, and matters related

thereto.

"Q. Did you develop any information establishing CP connection

on the part of King?

"A. Not beyond his affiliation with Levison and the other

individuals previously mentioned.

y Q. What was the objective of the investigation of King and

SCLC?

?A. To determine possible communist influence of King and SCLC.

"Q. If, as you state, you did not develop information that king

•was a communist, was not this investigation in vain?

"A. Not in my opinion. It is correct it did not establish that

King was a CP member. It did establish that he was in contact

with individuals then having past or present CP affiliation which

was the objective of

the investigation.

any Bureau official..

"A. Mr. Seidel, as I endeavored to explain on May 12, your

use of that particular terminology did not register with me

at all.

Ripean officials

indicating this program began during the late 1950s and

continued to a fairly recent date. Did not your reports

regarding King, SCIC, or Levison include in their caption

COINTELPRO?

A. It is not my recollection that they did.

"Q.

What about a Klan organization?

A. I did at various times handle investigations concerning

individual Klan members. I•did not handle the Klan as

an

organizational matter. It is my recollection that in reporting

of the case would have been indicated as Ku Klux Klan - Racial

Matter.

I feel compelled to apologize if I appear particularly

dense as to the utilization of this phrase COINTELPRO. If it

was. a program operating over a period of years the only explanation

I can offer at this moment is that conceiably some field offices

intially

other than Atlanta were, involved therein. If this was the

case, Atlanta may well have been included therein subsequent

to my departure.

February 12, 1970

On the late afternoon of February 10, 1970, I was

emphatically told IODOROVICH that until he gave me

the name of the Agent who supposedly gave him and FRITZ, this in-

Iormation, that I would not believe that either he or FRITZ had

been given any information such as this by any Agent of this

Bureau and this was based on the fact that no Agent would have

any reason whatsoever to make such a statement sinee we had

not conducted any investigation in this matter nor did we

have any information concerning RIHA and, therefore, we would

not be in a position to make such a statement as to whether o

not RIHA was all right.

I then also pointed out to Mr. TODOROVICH that if he

gave the information to Mr. MC KEVITT and advised Mr. MC KEVITT

the information had come from an FBI Agent and

if Mr. MC KEVITT

contacted me I would certainly advise him that the information

did not come from anyone in the FBI. for the same reasons

as

set forth above.

I am enclosing, for the Bureau's information, an

article which appeared in the February 1l, 1970, issue of The

Rocky Mountain News, a

Denver newspaper.

Towards the end of the article it reports that

MC KEVITT had received an official denial from "a Washington source"

that any of the official agencles which have been named in

connection with the RIHA case actually had any knowledge of

where RIHA is now., The source, according to the article which

MC KEVITT refused to identify, also said RIHA was not involved

in espionage of any sort and that none of these agencies

have ever told anyone in Boulder, Denver, or elsewhere that

•RINA was alive and well.

The article points out the most frequently mentioned

agencies have been the fBI, ClA, Military intelligence agencies

and the U. S. INS.

On 2/10/70, SAC Werner, Denver, demanded that Mike

_Venver, identify Bureau Agent who allegedly told a CIA officer

that the subject's disappearance was merely a marital matter

and that subject, in fact, fas alright. Todorovich refused

to do so. The Director instructed that we protest to CIA,

regarding Todorovich's actions.

On 2-17-70, Llaison Agent Papich vigorously protested

'Todorovich's actions to CIA, charging the Agency with impeding

our inquiry. He pointed out that Todorovich's stubborn• refusal

to divulge the identity of the Bureau Agent involved was unac

attributed to our Agent.

As a result of Papich's protest, a

CIA officiaL telephoned Todorovich and demanded that he divulge

the identity of the Agent.

lodorovich retused and stated that

he considered this a matter of personal honor and that unless

there was reason to believe Bureau operations were being

OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR

26 February 1970

‹ Personal and Confidential

The Honorable J. Edgar Hoover

Director

Federal Bureau of Investigation

Washington, D. C.

Dear Mi. Hoover:

Mr. Papich has orally informed me that you wish to have the

identity of the FBI agent who was the source of certain information

communicated to an employee of this Agency, Mr. Michael Todorovich.

This information regarding the disappearance of one Thomas Riha was

in turn passed to Di. Joseph Smiley, then President of colorado"

University, Boulder, Colorado, now President of a university in El

Paso, Texas, and to the District Attorney of Denver, Mi. James

McKevitt.

In view of your personal interest in this matter, I instructed

MI. Todorovich to report to me in person.

I have reviewed this complicated case in detail with Mr. Todorovich

and have requested him to reveal the identity of his source. As a point

of honor and personal integrity, Mr. Todorovich was adamant that he

could not disclose the identity of his source. Under further pressure

from me, Mi. Todorovich maintained his position, stating that in de-

fense of it he was prepared to submit his resignation immediately.

Mr. Todorovich éxplained that the Riha/Galya Tannenbaum cases

had been given extensive news coverage, much of it being sensational

in nature. He stressed that there was embarrassing public speculation

as to the possible involvement of the CIA and the FBI in Riha's

disappearance.

The purpose of Mr. Todorovich's conference with the District

Attorney of Denver was to solicit his good offices to remove pres-

sures and the possible serving of a subpoena on Di. Joseph Smiley.

He also sought to orient the District Attorney properly so that he

would not continue to have an erroneous impression of the roles of

the CIA and the FBI, thereby eliminating further adverse publicity.

Mr. Todorovich affirms that before going to District Attorney

McKevitt he called upon the FBI Special Agent in Charge, Mr. Scott

Werner, and sought to coordinate with him our respective interests.

He also solicited Mr. Werner to accompany him to the District

Attorney,

Mr. Todorovich states that Mr. Werner refused absolutely to

cooperate in this mattei. Instead, Mr. Werner engaged in an oral

exchange during which he remarked that our representative in

Boulder was "lying" and then proceeded to challenge the veracity of

Mr. Todorovich.

Subsequently, Mr. Todorovich conferred with

the District Attorney alone.

He was successful in persuading the

District Attorney to make a favorable public statement which had

the effect of putting this issue regarding Dr. Smiley and other rumors

to rest as far as the public was concerned.

I have carefully reviewed the statements of Mr. Todorovich.

I feel that poor judgment was employed in passing the information in

question to Dr. Smiley and later to the District Attorney. This should

only have been done with specific EBI approval. I wish to assure you

that I do not condone violations of the third agency rule, and I am

taking steps to impress once again this elementary fact upon all Agency

officials.

With regard to Mr. Todorovich, I have no reason to doubt that

he has acted honestly. I believe that he has reported to me in good

He is sincerely interested in preserving a sound working.

relationship between the CIA and the FBI, Nevertheless, because a

situation of this sort adversely affects the relationship between the two

agencies, I am taking administrative action in this matter with regard

to Mr. Todorovich.

While the following is not pertinent to your request, my review

of this case suggests the advisability of a re-examination of Riha's

disappearance and past activities and, necessarily, the Tannenbaum

case.

Briefly, since 1958 we have communicated to your Bureau

significant information which relates to Riha's involvement with

Czech and Soviet intelligence services, when he was behind the Iron

Curtain. I attach for your information and convenience copies of

pertinent reports regarding this aspect of the case.

I hope sincerely that this recent incident will not impair our

mutual efforts in making certain that we have not overlooked factors

possibly having a significant bearing on U.S. intelligence and internal

security interests. I shall pursue this matter through our respective

liaison offices.

In closing. Mr. Hoover, Iw

_I wish to state that this Agency can only

fully perform its duties in the furtherance of the national security when

it has the closest coordination and teamwork with the Federal Bureau of

Investigation.

furthermore, it is necessary that we continue to con-

duct our business in an atmosphere of mutual respect.

I trust that we

can coordinate closely any future developments or actions in these cases,

in order to prevent the airing in public of conflicts or differences between

the two agencies.

I feel strongly that there are representatives of the

news media who are eager to exploit alleged differences on a national

scale.

Disturbing as this experience has been, I wish to thank you in

the interests of our common cause for having communicated with me

in such a forthright and candid manner.

...

1. The January 1970 receipt of information from

your Bureau that Mrs. Ruth Ann COOK,. Thomas RIHA's

mother, had mentioned runists of fer son's work for CIA

in letters to the SAC, Denver, caused us to verify the fact

RIHA has never been employed or used operationally by

this agency.

2. In 1958 and 1959 you were provided information

that RIHA, when transitting Prague en route to Moscow,

was contacted by Czech Intelligence and asked to remain in

the CSR. Later in 1958 Czech Intelligence introduced RiHA

to the KGB in Moscow and our source reported RIHA accepted

certain privileges from the KGB while asserting he would not

become a spy for the Soviets. Details reported by our source

about RIHA's KGB contacts did not emerge during a 1960 FBI

interview of RIHA.

3. This indication that RIHA may not have been truthful

in 1960, when added to our current knowledge about KGB interest

in recruiting American exchange students and RIHA's 1968 trip

10 the USSR, suggests the circumstances of RiA'S disappearance

might be re-evaluated. This Agency is reopening its file on this

case in view of the information disclosed in the attachments.

via Duesseldorf. During the trip Subject disclosed the

following to source which has been supplemented from

information from our files.

3..

RIHA, who was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia

17 April 1929, is one of the twenty American students

selected for the East-West Exchange Program

and will be

studying in the USSR for the 1958-59 academic year. Files

5. RIHA told our source that when he arrived in Prague

he was put into a Government hotel for three days before he

was allowed to stay with his relatives and friends. During

this time, and perhaps later, RIHA was accompanied through

the city by a guide whom he described as a "Government

Official" name unknown, who attempted to effect Subject's

repatriation to Czechoslovakia. RIHA told our source that

this man has set up an appointment (date and address unknown)

to meet him in Moscow to talk further.

Subject told our source that this "Government

Forces as such and that he (RIHA) is not too worried

concerning this contact. RIHA apparently feels that it

is the price he must pay in order to study in the Soviet

he feels that he can plead that he is too busy with his

‹ any officials. Our

source also stated that RIHA is in some kind of correspondence

with the Czech official. We have no description or name for

the Czech official.

SUBJECT

: RIHA, Thomas

•1. Reference is made to our CS CI 3/751,690 of

27 October 1958 concerning

an

attempt by a member of Czech

Intelligence to effect Subject's repatriation while the

Latter was in Prague in June of

1958 visiting relatives

route to study in Moscow during 1958-59 as

an Bast-West

Exchange Student.

The following report describes further

action taken by the KGB in Moscow to cultivate Subject, and

was recently submitted by a sensitive and reliable source.

2.

Sometime in December 1958, Subject again met the

Cuech Offivial

the CSR in Prague last summer.

According to our source, it

was apparently

an accidental

meeting at a Moscow railroad

station as the Czech

was returning to Prague.

The Czech

was

delighted to see subject, and introduced him to a soviet

official.

This Soviet identified himself only by

a first

name and

a telephone number, both unknown to our source.

The Soviet described his work as being in the American

Section of the MVD.

3. This Soviet Official has been cultivating Subject

(trying to see him as often

as possible, sometimes twice a

week) since their introduction in December, by offering such

blandishments as trips in a chauffered private limousine

into forbidden areas outside Moscow, tickets to any enter-

tainment,

access to material from previously inaccessible

archives,

the use of private country villas and all the

"beautiful, interesting and intelligent girls" he might want.

Subject has

further been promised the opportunity of returning

to the Soviet Union for as long as he wants at any future

date.

He would have to pay only his way over there; his

expenses

and return trip to the US would be paid by the

Soviets.

4.

Subject has

; taken advantage of this offer to take

several trips for sightseeing into forbidden areas around

Moscow in a private car with the Soviet Official, and has

also taken up a few offers for entertainment. Subject visited

one of these

villas, but refused the girls on the ground that

he wants a woman to like him for himself, and not because she

has been told to do so. The Soviet answered that "some of

them will really learn to like you for yourself, as well as

work for us," but Subject still declined to

get involved.

However, Subject has recently been taken up by a Soviet girl

who had previously tried to seduce another American student

and

subsequently blurted out that she was put onto the latter

American by the MVD, which she has also told Subject. Subject

is reported to be responding warmly to her approaches although

he has flatly told her he doesn't trust her nor any Russian

completely.

He claims he enjoys her company but will not

a serious attair with her, and suspects she may be tied

up with the other women offered him by the Soviet Official.

3.

In his reiaiionship

with the Soviet Official, Subjoet

is reportedly aware that he is playing a risky game,

and is

only utilizing the situation for the comfort and convenience

it brings him. He has told the Soviet frankly that he cannot

be wom over ideologically.

subject says he feels that the

Soviets' interest in him is to

cultivate him as a scholar of

possible future importance to insure that he will always be

Subject

has reportedly told

several other American students of his relationship with the

Soviet Official in order to cover himself "in case anything

happened".

6. This Soviet Official has evinced an interest to

Subject in many of the American Exchange students, with the

explanation that some would undoubtedly be back in Moscow

within two years

as Diplomats and that since this is his

area of responsibility, he wants to know as much as possible

about them.

The

Soviet indicated that he was

the pattern of the American Exchange students' trips to the

US Embassy and what they do in the university buildings, but

is not so sure of

their activitles around the city.

To

demonstrate to Subject his knowledge about the American

students, the Soviet Official mentioned an affair going on

within the American group of which Subject had been unaware.

The Soviet's information

turned out to be true.

Subject was described by a reliable source, who

nows him from group soclal gatherings at harvard, as mature

a clever and humorous conversationalist who likes to be

surrounded by people, make new acquaintances, and develop

friendships. Subject's patriotic motivation

was not known

on Michael Martin/LUTHER, one of the other

American Exchange Students at Moscow University. Subject was

asked to spend

as much time as possible with LUTHER, and to

report where he goes, what he does and with whon he

If Subject were to do this reporting, the Soviet Official

said he would make available certain

in this material is vital to his having a successful

year academically in Moscow.

Subject alleges he flatly refused this "deal"', saying

that if he ever got mixed up in such a dirty business, it would

be for his own side and not for the Communists. The Soviet

Official then told Subject he should engage in

such observation

Morley was asked if Denver had information concerning

Dr. Ioseph Smiley, former President at Colorado University

who was there when

Riha disappeared.

He said that Smiley

James "Mike" McKevitt interviewed 5/5/70 as to investigation of

Riha, Czechoslovak-born, naturalized, former professor of Russian

history at Colorado University, who departed Denver area 3/69

without notifying friends, associates or estranged wife. His

* to 3/23

disappearance has been glamorized and spiced up in newspaper

articles by references to Galya Tannenbaum, his paramour.

McKevitt

stated investigation at standstill, all leads being exhausted.

feels Tannenbaum may have killed subject since bad feeling developed

between them prior

to his disappearance due to her forging checks

on his account.

Further, Tannenbaum probably a nymphomaniac who

had constant sexual affairs with Riha and used this as a club over

his head to prevent disclosure of forgeries.

In NcKevitt's opinion

Riha is dead since he was close to his friends and if alive would

contact them.

Investigation indicates Riha abnormal in his sexual

desires and

could not leave wonch alone.. Pescibility exists one

of these involvements may have resulted in his death.

DI..

Joseph Smiley, former President, Colorado University,

where subject

employed, is now President, University of Texas,

fEl Paso, Texas.

Smiley after subject's disappearance stated

subject

was alive andrell.

When challenged by McKevitt to disclose basis

for statement he refused and appealed to CIA, his source, for help.

Bureau vigorously refuted CIA's claim that Bureau Agent was original

Isource for statement.. As result lickevitt publicly announced

statement was not true

and resulted from "honest mistake."

NO

indication Smiley has any facts to contribute concerning subject's

Icurrent whereabouts or basis for his disappearance.

Since Bureau

thas conducted no investigation into Riha's disappearance, interview

of Smiley could result

in impression Bureau entering case. However,

if Director so desires, El Paso will be instructed to interview

Dr. Smiley. Bureau files show subject attended Moscow University

19/58-9/59.

Our files

show CIA gave Riha a short briefing prior to

his entry into USSR in 1958. In 1958-59 CIA advised Czech intel

ligence attempted to persuade Riha to repatriate and later intro

duced Riha to Soviet intelligence which attempted his recruitment.

After leaving Boulder, SMILEY was advised by

Dean WILLIAl E. BRIGGS, College of Arts and Sciences,

University of Colorado, Boulder, that a letter

received by the University purportedly written by RIJA

In which he stated that he would not be returning to

the University.

BRIGGS advised SMILEY that in his

opinion, the letter was a forgery, since the signature

did not compare with that of RIJA.

• Alter the disappearance, SMILEY began receiving

a great many inquiries from

the news media and he ras

pressed for a statenent regarding his knowledge of RIJA

and whether or not he was alive.

THE FOLLOWING PAS FURNISHED BY DR. SMILEY

IN THE STRICTEST OF CONFIDENCE WITH THE UNDERSTANDING

THAT IT WAS FOR THE INFORIATION OF THE FBI AND NOT

FOR DISSEMINATION TO ANY OUTSIDE AGENCY SINCE HE WAS

BREAKING A COXFIDENCE WITH AN ASSOCIATE IN THE DENVER

OFFICE OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY:

Being hounded by the press for a statement,

he contacted a source in the CIA Office at Denver since

he, SMILEY, has formerly a member of the Office of Naval

Intelligence, thinking that perhaps that agency could

assist hin off the record with

any information it might

possess.

SWILEY was avare that the CIA had interviered

RIJA fOllowing a trip by RIJA to the Soviet Union. The

CIA source subsequently told Di. SMILEY to merely advise.

the press

that ha had information to the effect that

RIJA WaS

"alive and well".

This infornation was subsequently

released by Dr. SILlY to the student press at the University

of Colorado, and it appeared in print.

When the Office of the District Attorney in

Denver instituted investigation into the disappearance

Of RIJA, SMILEY Fas contacted by the DA's Office regarding

the source of his statenent.

Dr. SMILEY again contacted

the Denver CIA Office source and was advised that he

was to state nothing and that he would be recontacted.

Some days later, the CIA source recontacted

him and told hin that he would be receiving an inquiry

from the Office of the DA in tha form of a staterent,

and that he should agree with the statement even though

it "was not quite the truth". SMILEY did not question

2

NW 88614 Docld:32989606 Page 84

## Page 85

these instructions, since he felt that CIA knew what

should be done in this type of case.

He received a

telephone call from the DA's Office and a statement

was read to him to the effect that the infornation

which he had received and made public to the effect

that RIJA was alive and well was in error.

SMILEY

told the caller that he agreed with the statement and

nothing further came of this.

Dr. SMILEY does not know what part, 1f any.

the CIA has in this case, but since ho, SMILEY, 1s

himsolf

a former intelligence agent he did not feel

that he had the right to question something which

might be of vital importance to his country..

DR. SUILEY REQUESTED THAT NO HINT OR

INFERENCE BE GIVEN TO THE CIA WHICH WOULD INDICATE

•THAT HE HAS REVEALED TO THE FBI HIS CONTACTS REGARDING

THIS MATTER WITH THE DENVER OFFICE OF THE CIA.

He stated

that though he has no evidence to

substantiate his belief, he cannot get it out of his

mind that RIJA may have been a double agent for the

Soviets oi

: tha Cucchoslovaks=

He is aware that one

Mrs, TANNENBAU, a moRan indicted

for a number of frauds

and a suspoct in

two arsenic poisonings,

is considered

a suspect in the

disappearance of RIJA.

He never knew

to be associated

with any such wonan, but stated

that he was not acquainted with the personal life of

RIJA who was sonewhat of a "loner".

RIJA, when he joined

the staff of the University

of Colorado, was single but in 8/68, an individual

came

to visit RIJA ostensibly for the purpose of arranging

& marriage between RIJA and the man's sister.

The

intended bride was a Czechoslovakian girl who ras bocn in

Prague, Czechoslovakia, and this "brother-in-law" was

entertained by a member and colleague of alda in the

History Departrant. This individual indicated to situat

that although the

"brother-in-law" supposedly did rot

speak any English, and had RIJA translate every statement

Into Czech, it vas apparent from the gestures and expressions

of the "brother-in-lar" that he understood more than he

let on. Three weeks after the visit of this man, the woman

who became Airs. RIJA cane to Eoulder, Colorado, "bera ste

and RiJA vere married.

The nairiage

resulted in divorce .

a short time later and the girl reportedly returned to

the East Coast fron whence she came.

DE. SMILEY indicated that he has no further

BRIGGS, Colege of Arts and Sciences, University of

purportedly written Iron. Canada by RiJA, and may be ir

a position

to assist in answering any question the Bureau

might have regarding RIJA's association with the University

of Colorado, sinca BRIGGS would have possession of these

He stated BRIGGS is a trusted confidant of his

Attached is a proposed memorandum to the Attorney

of a memorand tetter head meto an Toastached ends no, a co

captioned 'Investigation of Ku Klux Klan and other Hate Groups."

It appears that we are proposing to give the copy of the Gale

memorandum to the Senate Select Committee in response to their

request by letter dated May 14, 1975, for a memorandum prepare

Gale relative to the subject matter of the 1964 memorandum.

by

My reading of the memorandum revealed that it is a purely

deliberative document which quotes personal views of Mr. Sullivan,

Mr. Rosen, Mr. Belmont, and Mr. Gale. I am concerned that the

release of such a memorandum containing not only the personal views of

Bureau officials, but also identifying them by name could have an impact

on individuals in the future who may be asked to furnish their opinions.

concerning policy matters in the FBI. As indicated by the Attorney General

in his speech in New York, it is essential that the Executive Branch have a

degree of privacy concerning policy discussions and expressions of

personal views by officials in order for the Executive to function properly.

I do recognize that we may not be able to resist giving the

Committee access to material documents that bear on particular issues

under investigation, however, I do recommend that when we are required

to produce deliberative documents, the names and other identifying data

relating to individuals furnishing views be deleted.

Former Special Agent Richard H. Davis of the

Atlanta Office telephonically contacted SA Paul V. Daly of this

Division on 6-4-75 at which time he explained that he had been

contacted. by Michael Epstein of captioned Committee at which time

Epstein requested that Davis make himself available for interview in

either Atlanta, Georgia, or travel to Washington, D. C. Davis informed

Epstein that he would have to obtain Bureau approval prior to submitting

to interview inasmuch as he had to obtain a release from his employment

secrecy agreement.

Mr. Davis informed SA Daly that he was reluctant.

to agree to being interviewed by captioned Committee concerning his

activities as an Agent. It was pointed out to Mr. Davis that the

decision as to whether to agree to interview was his, but he was

advised that captioned Committee has subpoena power and might attempt

to force him to furnish information through the use of a subpoena.

He was informed that the Bureau was cooperating with captioned Committee

and their inquiry into FBI operations.

It was explained to Mr. Davis that if he desired to

allow himself to be interviewed, the Bureau would make available

an employee at his request to be available but not present during

interview. He was also advised that this Agent would not represent

him as private counsel. Mr. Davis was advised that the Bureau's

concern was not of matters of historical fact but rather testimony

might be required which could impair the Bureau's efforts to discharge

its responsibilities. It was also explained that the Bureau representative

would assist him in making determination whether his response to a

particular question would indentify confidential informants, impair on-

going investigations, divulge information derived from other Government

agencies or foreign sources or expose sensitive investigative techniques

and, therefore, a response should not be given.

representative be made available during his interview and would request

the interview take place in Atlanta, Georgia. Additionally, he stated

Epstein had indicated that the topic of discussion in the interview

would be the Bureau's investigation of Martin Luther King, Stanley

David Levison, and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

Mr. Davis stated he would recontact FBI Headquarters as soon as

a date and place of interview had been determined. He indicated he

would set the date for interview so that the Bureau would have ample

opportunity to have an Agent available.

We have separately requested

Bureau approva! for the release of Davis from his employment agreement

for purposes of this interview.

President under the INLET Program) or do we know of any

submission responsive to this which illustrates interpretation?

There has been no amplification of this instruction,

nor any submission under INLET of an item on prominent

personalities that would show the interpretation of this

point.

With respect to the observation that this matter

should cause a congressional furor, it is noted that INLEt

has already been afforded considerable publicity, beginning

in February, 1973, after an office memorandum on the subject

reached the

news media. This publicity is why the Senate

Committee asked for documents on INLET. The White House and

Senator Bob Packwood inquired about the Program. A detailed

defense of INLET appeared in the Congressional Record.

By way of background, the INLET instruction that has

received the most publicity--items with an unusual twist or

concerning prominent personalities--was recalled by the author

of the INLET Program initiating letter as having been

specifically dictated by then Assistant Director W. C. Sullivan.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re: SENSTUDY

While we cannot say exactly what former Assistant

Director W. C. Sullivan had in mind when he added the

instruction about items with an unusual twist, we can

speculate with a hypothetical example.

If we learned that a trusted assistant to an

important government official--an official who had taken

a "hard line" with respect to dealings with the Soviet Union,

for example--was under development by Soviet intelligence,

this would be an unusual twist to an item of intelligence

interest to the President involving a prominent person.

In such a hypothetical case, we would, of course,

advise the goverment official involved, and The Attorney

General and the President. We would have done this under

INLEt and we would still disseminate this type of data.

INLET was only a vehicle for special dissemination.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

I. FOUNDING

The Black Panther Party, with head-

quarters in Oakland,

California, was

founded in 1966 by two Oakland Negroes

- Huey Percy Newton and Bobby George

Seale - both at that time at Merritt Col-

lege in Oakland.

The name and symbol

of the new party were taken from the

Lowndes County Freedom Organization,

an Alabama political party known infor-

mally in 1965 as the Black Panther Party.

From the writings of communists,

revolutionaries, and

black militants,

Newton and Seale allegedly selected

ideas around which they could build a

cold sected

HUEY PERCY NEWTON

revolutionary frame that suited the needs

of their party. Influential writings in-

cluded those of Mao Tse-tung, Chinese Communist

leader; Frantz Fanon, West Indian psychiatrist who

advocated

violence

for Algerian

nationalists;

Ernesto "Che" Guevara, one-time lieutenant of

Cuba's Fidel Castro and a principal architect of 20th

century guerrilla warfare; Malcolm X, American black

nationalist who advocated violence to obtain Negro

"'freedom"; and W. E. B. DuBois, Negro educator who

became a member of the Communist Party, USA, at

the age of 93.

• «**

The organization was at first called the Black

Panther Party for Self-Defense; however, the "Self-

Defense" was removed in 1968 in an effort to project

a more politically oriented image to prospective

BOBBY GEORGE SEALE

sympathizers and supporters.

As head of the new Black Panther Party, Newton assumed the title Minister of

Defense, and Seale was named Chairman. When questioned about the membership

of their organization, Newton and Seale gave the since oft-repeated reply: "Those

who know don't say. Those who say don't know." The militancy of the group,

however, had an immediate appeal to the discontented, restless youth of Oakland's

ghettos.

II. BLACK PANTHER OBJECTIVES

The Black Panther Party "Platform and Program" is repeated in each issue of

the official Party publication, The Black Panther.

October 1966

Black Panther Party

Platform and Program

What We Want

What We Believe

1. We want freedom. We want power to determine the destiny of our

Black Community.

We believe that black people will not be free until we are able to deter-

mine our destiny.

2. We want full employment for our people.

We believe that the federal government is responsible and obligated to

give every man employment or a guaranteed income. We believe that if

the white American businessmen will not give full employment. then the

means of production should be taken from the businessmen and placed in

the community so that the people of the community can organize and em-

ploy all of its people and give a high standard of living.

3

NW 88614 Docld:32989606 Page 126

---

## Page 127

3. We want an end to the robbery by the CAPITALIST of our Black

Community.

We believe that this racist government has robbed us and now we are

demanding the overdue debt of forty acres and two mules. Forty acres

and two mules was promised 100 years ago as restitution for slave labor

and mass murder of black people. We will accept the payment in currency

which will be distributed to our many communities. The Germans are now

aiding the Jews in Israel for the genocide of the Jewish people. The Ger-

mans murdered six million Jews. The American racist has taken part in

the slaughter of over fifty million black people; therefore, we feel that this

is a modest demand that we make.

4. We want decent housing, fit for shelter of human beings.

We believe that it the white landlords will not give decent housing to

our black community. then the housing and the land should be made inte

cooperatives so that our community, with government aid, can build and

make decent housing for its people.

5. We want education for our people that exposes the true nature of this

decadent American society. We want education that teaches us our true

history and our role in the present day society.

We believe in an educational system that will give to our people a knowl-

edge of self. If a man does not have knowledge of himself and his position

in society and the world, then he has little chance to relate to anything

6. We want all black men to be exempt from military service.

We believe that Black people, should not be forced to fight in the mili-

tary service to defend a racist government that does not protect us. We

will not fight and kill other people of color in the world who, like black

people, are being victimized by the white racist government of America

We will protect ourselves from the force and violence of the racist police

and the racist military, by whatever means necessary.

7. We want an immediate end to POLICE BRUTALITY and MURDER

of black people.

We believe we can end police brutality in our black community by or-

ganizing black self-defense groups that are dedicated to defending our

black community from racist police oppression and brutality. The Second

Amendment to the Constitution of the United States gives a right to bear

arms. We thetefore believe that all black people should arm themselves

for self-defense.

8. We want freedom for all black men held in federal, state, county

and city prisons and jails.

We believe that all black people should be released from the many

jails and prisons because they have not received a fair and impartial trial.

4

NW 88614 Docld:32989606 Page 12T

---

## Page 128

9. We want all black people when brought to trial to be tried in court by

& jury of their peer group or people from their black communities, as

defined by the Constitution of the United States.

We believe that the courts should follow the United States Constitution

so that black people will receive fair trials. The 14th Amendment of the

U.S. Constitution gives a man a right to be tried by his peer group. A peer

is a person from a similar economic, social, religious, geographical, en-

vironmental, historical and racial background. To do this the court will be

forced to select a jury from the black community from which the black

defendant came. We have been, and are being tried by all-white juries

that have no understanding of the "average reasoning rian" of the black

community.

10. We want land, bread, housing, education, clothing, justice and peace.

And as our major political objective, a United Nations-supervised plebis-

cite to be held throughout the black colony in which only black colonial

subjects will be allowed to participate, for the purpose of determining the

will of black people as to their national destiny.

When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one

people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with

another, and to assume, among the powers of the earth, the separate and

equal station to which the laws of nature and nature's God entitle them, a

decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare

the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal;

that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights;

that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That, to

secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their

just powers from the consent of the governed; that, whenever any form of

government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people

to alter or to abolish it, and to institute a new government, laying its

foundation on such prineiples, and organizing its powers in such form, as

to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Pru-

dence. indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not

be changed for light and transient causes; and, accordingly, all experience

hath shown. that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are

sufferable. than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they

are accustomed. But. when a long train of abuses and usurpations. pur-

suing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under ab-

solute despotism. it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such govern.

ment. and to provide new guards for their future security.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

III. RISE OF BLACK PANTHER PARTY

Proclaiming a legal right to bear arms, the Panthers by early 1967 had begun to

appear in public wearing black leather jackets and black berets, openly carrying

shotguns, rifles, or pistols, and shouldering bandoliers of ammunition.

Calling the police "pigs," the Panthers began a buildup in Negro areas of the

idea that police departments, especially that in Oakland, were dedicated to the

brutalization and harassment of minority groups, and, acting as an appendage of

white government authority, were working toward the eventual annihilation (geno-

cide) of the Negro race.

Invasion of California State Legislature

The first incident that brought national attention to this group occurred on May

2, 1967, as the California Legislature was in session in Sacramento. Approximately

40 members of the Black Panther Party, carrying loaded rifles, pistols, and shotguns,

and some wearing bandoliers of ammunition about their waists or draped over their

shoulders, burst into the Chamber. They were protesting a bill being introduced on

that date outlawing the carrying of loaded weapons in public and were proclaiming

their right to bear arms and criticize the police. Before they were arrested, they

passed out mimeographed leaflets calling on all Negroes to end the "terrorist"

oppression of colored races by white America and referring to the preparation of

concentration camps in the United States as a beginning of genocide.

Police Officer Meets Panthers--and Death

The Panthers became more militant with the passing of time. At 5:00 a.m.,

October 28, 1967, two Oakland, California, patrol officers, John F. Frey and Herbert

C. Heanes, made a routine traffic violation car stop. While the officers were a-

waiting the results of the car registration check by radio, the driver, Huey Newton,

got out of the car. Suddenly, shooting broke out. Officer Frey was killed; Officer

Heanes was wounded critically; and Newton received a stomach wound. He stopped

a passing automobile and had the driver take him to a hospital where he was taken

into custody and hospitalized. After a state trial, which began July 15, 1968,

Newton was sentenced on September 27, 1968, to serve from 2 to 15 years on a

charge of voluntary manslaughter.*

"Free Huey" Campaign

Two days after Patrolman Frey's death, the Huey Newton Defense Fund was

established at a meeting of a section of the Negro community of Oakland.

The cry of "Free Huey" became a clarion call. The imprisoned Newton was

built up in the public eye as "black and bold in defense of his people." Each

*It was ruled later that the presiding judge in this trial erred in instructions to the jury.

Newton was released August 5, 1970, and scheduled for retrial.

bringing Its own axe to grit

u, such organizations

as the anarchist New Left group named Students

for a Democratic Society; the Trotskyist Socialist

Workers Party and its youth group, the Young

Socialist Alliance; the Communist Chinese-

oriented Progressive Labor Party; the Communist

Party, USA, and its youth affiliate, the W. E. B.

DuBois Clubs of America; and militant campus

groups, black and white, began to gather in sup-

port of the Panthers, who were willing not only

to defy the establishment, but to destroy it.

Enter Leroy Eldridge Cleaver

LEROY ELDRIDGE CLEAVER

Early in 1967, the Panthers were joined by a

recent parolee from the California prison system,

author of a best-selling autobiography, Soul On Ice, staff writer for the magazine

Ramparts, and admitted Marxist - Leroy Eldridge Cleaver.

In Soul On Ice, Cleaver wrote: "I sought out his (Marx's) books...It was like

taking medicine for me to find that, indeed, American Capitalism deserved all the

hatred and contempt that I felt for it in my heart...."

After Newton was jailed, although he remained the undisputed leader, it soon

became apparent that Cleaver, designated Minister of Information, was projecting

a major leadership image. The Party began to further widen its publicity, nation-

ally and internationally, and enlarge its radical support and revolutionary intent.

As an example of this spreading influence of the Panther Party, the 1968

National Election ticket of the Peace and Freedom Party, a coalition of radical

groups, included Cleaver as candidate for the Presidential nomination; Newton as

candidate for the 7th Congressional District of Alameda County, California; Kath-

leen Cleaver, 18th Assembly District, California State Legislature; Bobby Seale,

17th Assembly District, California State Legislature. Cleaver received a national

total of almost 200,000 votes. Only a small percentage of the California elector-

ate cast their votes for Newton, Seale, and Kathleen Cleaver.

On the evening of April 6, 1968, Cleaver and several Panthers became involved

in a shoot-out with Oakland police officers. The incident resulted in the death of

a Panther, the wounding of two police officers, and the wounding and arrest of

Cleaver. Cleaver's parole was revoked immediately and he was returned to prison.

After much publicity, he was later released on bail by a Superior Court Judge who

ruled that the jeopardy of his parole status stemmed "from his undue eloquence in

pursuing political goals...offensive to many of his contemporaries." This decision

was overruled by the District Court of Appeals and upheld by the California Court

of. Appeals. Cleaver was ordered to return to prison by November 27, 1968. Elect-

ing to become a Federal fugitive, he disappeared in late November, 1968, going

first to Havana, Cuba, and later to Algiers, where he has established residence.

International Committee to Defend Eldridge Cleaver

Soon after Cleaver's arrest in the spring of 1968, approximately 150 prominent

individuals sponsored the establishment of an International Committee to Defend

Eldridge Cleaver. The committee intended to dispatch a team to Europe to gain

7

NW 88614 Docld:32989606 Page 130

---

## Page 131

international support and arrange for a European edition of Cleaver's book, Soul On

Ice.

Rise of the Black Panther Party

In May, 1968, the hard-core membership of the Black Panther Party was esti-

mated at only 125, and Panther activity was confined largely to the San Francisco-

Oakland, California, area.

However, because of the dramatic shoot-outs, the

"Free Huey" Campaign, the funds established for the defense of both Newton and

Cleaver, the widespread publicity, and the support given readily by white radical

groups and individual sympathizers, the Black Panther Party began to grow rapidly,

not only in membership but in militancy and influence.

Chapters began to appear

in major cities throughout the country. By the end of 1968, the membership had

reached nearly 2,000, with additional thousands of sympathizers and supporters.

National Committee to Combat Fascism

Set up to coexist with Black Panther Party branches in various cities in the

United States are chapters of another organization called National Committee to

Combat Fascism. In actuality, there is little difference between the two. This

group, a Panther Party front, was set up as the result of a revolutionary conference,

called National Conference for a United Front Against Fascism, held in Oakland,

California, in July, 1969. The conference, sponsored by the Black Panther Party

and assisted by the anarchist Students for a Democratic Society and the Communist

Party, USA, was called to form a coalition of black and white radicals, described

as "oppressed people."

The National Committee to Combat Fascism is considered by Party leaders to

be the "political organizing bureau" of the Black Panther Party. Its specific task

allegedly is to raise the political level of the people and educate them against

the system.

International Section

On September 13, 1970, the International Section of the Black Panther Party

officially opened in Algiers. Joining Cleaver on the staff were his wife, Kathleen,

and Field Marshal Donald Lee Cox, a fugitive from justice. Cox faces charges

of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution for conspiracy to commit murder, based on a

warrant issued on April 20, 1970, at Baltimore, Maryland. He also failed to appear

on May 14, 1970, in San Francisco, to answer Federal firearms charges.

This section, in its entirety, was expelled from the Black Panther Party by

Huey Newton on February 27, 1971. The expulsion resulted from tensions and

differences between Party hierarchy which led to disruptive factionalism.

V. FUNDS

The money by which the Black Panther Party operates comes from a number of

sources. There are substantial private contributions; fees for public appearances,

such as campus speeches, radio, and television appearances; payments for mag-

azine articles; collections for trials and bail funds in this country and abroad;

subscriptions and individual sales of the Party's official organ, The Black Panther;

fund-raising activities sponsored by sympathizers and supporters; sales of record-

ings of interviews and speeches; and financial aid from radicals and extremists.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

VI. "SOCIALISTIC" PROGRAMS

Panther Party leaders insist their primary aim is to serve the "people,"

meaning ghetto blacks. To establish good intent, Party officials have set up a se-

ries of community services aimed at recruiting members and sympathizers and

building Party influence in ghetto areas. These programs, described by the Pan-

thers as "socialistic" programs, are suppos.", tn be carried out by all Party

branches and include: "liberation schools" to giva."our people a knowledge of

self"; free health clinics, with money, medical supplies and professional serv-

ices donated by laymen and professionals in the community; free clothing programs,

with clothing donated by the community; Community Information Centers, to "an~

swer the basic needs of the people"; and a monthly free shuttle bus service for

families of blacks in prison.

Few of these programs actually are carried out, and

those that have been attempted have been mostly unsuccessful.

The program that has received the most publicity is the "breakfast program,"

devised as a further means of indoctrinating Negro youth in Panther teachings of

racism and rebellion. As expressed in The Black Panther, June 14, 1969, "The

youth we are feeding will surely feed the revolution." Breakfasts are held for

ghetto children either at churches, housing projects, Panther Community Informa-

tion Centers, or other space that can be obtained free of charge. Panthers usually

ask local businessmen to donate food or money to this program, boycotting stores

that refuse to participate. At these functions, children have been known to sing

such chants as: "I am a revolutionary. I am a revolutionary. There's going to be

some barbecue if Huey's not set free. Power to the people."

In 1969, Panther "Coloring Books" were printed and given out at these break-

fasts. The books contained 22 pages of drawings teaching the children to distrust,

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

VII. TACTICS

The Black Panther Party is a violent revolutionary group whose members pro-

voke confrontations with law enforcement officers and whose leaders incite racial

hatred and preach urban guerrilla warfare.

Target: Police

Panthers claim that black communities are occupied by the police in the same

way and for the same purpose that foreign troops occupy conquered territory and

that these forces, operating under "establishment" orders, are engaged in gradual

annihilation of the black race. Blacks, according to the Panthers, must, through

urban guerrilla warfare, use guns to liberate themselves from the ever-present

repressive enemy. Children in Panther schools" do their exercises to the rhythm

of: "There is a pig upon the hill — if you don't kill him the Panthers will."

Numerous claims have been made that the Black Panther Party is an innocent

victim of police persecution and genocide. This charge is rendered absurd by fact.

During 1970, 6 police officers were killed and 22 wounded through acts of violence

traced to the Panthers. One officer, in 1969, was killed by a Panther with a shot-

gun blast at point-blank range as the officer lay wounded and helpless on the

ground.

Out of 20 members named by the Panther Party as "killed in cold blood"' by

the police, four were killed by members of a rival black extremist group on the

west coast; one died of barbiturate intoxication; one was shot and killed by

a store owner during a robbery attempt; one was killed by his wife over a love

affair he was having with a female Black Panther; and another was allegedly tor-

tured

and killed by Panther Party members. Of the remaining twelve, two were

found dead on the street, the victims of unknown assailants, and ten were involved

in shoot-outs with police officers.

Attacks on Others

Panther attacks have not been limited to the police. While claiming their

intent to protect the black community, Panthers have assaulted and threatened

citizens who have tried to assist the police.

Neighborhood stores have been forced to "contribute" food supplies and

money under fear of Panther violence. Many other persons have also been victim-

ized, as shown by the fact that in 1969 alone 348 Panther members were arrested

for serious crimes, including murder, armed robbery, rape, bank robbery, and

burglary.

On April 21, 1969, 21 members of the Black Panther Party were charged in New

York in a 30-count indictment with conspiring to bomb public places and murder

policemen and with possessing dangerous weapons.

Weapons Caches

Stockpiles of machine guns, sawed-off shotguns, rifles, hand grenades, thou-

sands of rounds of ammunition, Molotov cocktails, gunpowder, and accumulations

of bayonets, swords, and machetes have been confiscated from Panther offices.

"Revolutionary Suicide"

On August 7, 1970, Superior Court Judge Harold Haley, the Deputy District

Attorney, and three other persons were tied together with piano wire and dragged

from a San Rafael, California, courtroom and taken as hostages by three armed

Negro convicts, one of whom was standing trial for stabbing a San Quentin prison

guard. The escapees were assisted by the defendant's 17-year-old brother who

supplied them with weapons for the escapade. Judge Haley, who had a sawed-off

shotgun taped to his neck, and the other hostages were forced into a waiting van.

When the authorities tried to stop the kidnappers, the judge was brutally murdered;

the Deputy District Attorney was injured seriously; and another hostage was

slightly wounded. Three Negroes were slain and one was wounded.

Immediately thereafter, Huey Newton declared the killing of Judge Haley as

being of "historical" importance to the Black Panther Party. This declaration was

based on the Panther belief that all black prisoners, regardless of their crimes, are

political prisoners and should be released.

CONFISCATED PANTHER WEAPONS

The perpetrators of the courtroom incident were lauded by the Panthers as

setting another "revolutionary example for black people." In commenting further,

The Black Panther of August 15, 1970, stated:

"The example that these brothers have set will be followed by

many and many will rise to choose revolutionary suicide rather

than reactionary suicide. Black people will unleash in great

numbers the Black kamakazi..."

In his eulogy at services for the slain Negroes, Newton said: "Our comrades

have taught us all a revolutionary lesson. They have intensified the struggle and

placed it on a higher level."

Panther "Justice"

Recalcitrant members of the Black Panther Party are sometimes victims of

Panther "justice." As one example, Panther Chairman Bobby Seale was brought

to trial in New Haven, Connecticut, for the torture-murder of Panther Alex Rackley.

Rackley, a Panther suspected of being an informant, was scalded, murdered, and

dumped in a swamp.

For a variety of reasons, many members have been purged from the Party.

These incidents are usually written up in The Black Panther in special articles

accompanied by photographs.

BOBBY SEALE:

"I AM THE CHAIRMAN OF

March, 1971

This is Brother Bobby Seale, from

the New Haven Courthouse, back in jail,

back here. And I just wanted to say to

the people, the masses of people, to all

eration Movement, Black hrothers and

sisters, Chicano brothers, the Puerto

brothers,

in the Black community, that

I've seen a lot of things happening;

and I've took time to analyse what's

happening.

And I see presently

that

there're some divisionary, counter-

revolutionary actions goingon. Now the

Party accepts constructive criticism.

Constructive

criticism! But the divi-

sionary, counter-revolutionary actions

and jive tactics of Eldridge Cleaver is

doing nothing but aiding the pig power

structure. Aiding the pig power struc-

ture in their attempt to put in gas cham-

bers and jails over 130 political prison-

ers, who are presently, like myself and

Ericka, caught up in these jails, and are

being railroaded to the gas chamber,

where we're fighting for our lives in

these trials. And this is the only thing

that Eldridge's actions are doing. This

is the only thing that I can see that is

going on. And my analysis shows this.

There is no split in the Black Panther

Party, at ail. But the main thing that we

want to get across, I want to get across,

to the people is that the Party is based

on Survival Programs to serve thepeo-

ple, and these

survival programs -

from

Breakfast for Children to the

recent programs that I'm designing

right here in jail, in my time that I'm

not in court, which is a decent housing

- these are survival programs - and

this program andall other programs

that all other revolutionary organiza-

tions have are survival programs, that

must sustain the people so the people

can

wage a revolutionary

struggle.

And

Eldridge Cleaver, who's de~

nouncing these types of programs and

carrying on with all those other divi-

survival programs come forth, and we

set up the survival programs to sustain

the

people's

Even the Vietnamese people, if one

have actual everyday, functional, con-

structive survival programs. In their

in their lands, and in their

everyday

operations in fighting the

capitalist pigs who occupy ther coun-

try, they have survival programs. And

those survival programs sustain the

ples of the world, and the socialistic

the

"'Revolutionary Art"'

The most prominent artist on The Black Panther staff is Minister of Culture

Emory Douglas. Although he prepares a large number of cartoons, other Panther

artists are also represented.

These cartoons characterize the Government and

local law enforcement as "pigs" and call for the overthrow of the Government

and the killing of Government officials, as well as police officers.

International News

Panthers profess to believe that American Negroes comprise isolated "col-

onies" in the heart of the "mother" country, and are part of the Third World,

defined as the nonwhite, undeveloped, and underdeveloped countries of the world.

The 10-Point Program of the Black Panther Party includes, as a major political

objective,

a United-Nations-supervised plebiscite to be held throughout the

black colony to determine the national destiny of American Negroes.

To internationalize their Party and enlarge their importance, Panther leaders

have sought acceptance, support, and funds from sources abroad. They have made

numerous trips to foreign countries, including Canada, Mexico, Cuba, Palestine,

Germany, France, England, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Soviet Union, North Korea,

North Vietnam, and the Chinese Mainland.

Both at home and abroad, Panther leaders loudly proclaim anti-American

sentiments and align themselves politically with the aims and tactics of enemy

lands. The international contacts most important to the Panthers are made with

revolutionary groups and communist countries, especially those that more closely

follow Maoist thinking.

The international news section of The Black Panther

reflects attempts by the Black Panther Party to attract such attention, support,

and aid.

ON CHAIRMAN MAO TSE TUNG'S DECLARATION

OF 20 MAY, 1970

In this declaration, Chairman Mac

Tse Trong has set forth a brillian

new acts of aggression launched by

fascist,

imperialist

Nixon-

Chinesepeoples.

This declaration pulls together into

clear focus the revolutionary struggles

and the liberation struggles of the peo-

sentiments of millions of oppressed

people inside the United States, it has

become

crystal clear

to us

that

rampant imperialist aggression on the

international scale and vicious fascist

repression on the domestic scale are

the two faces of the criminal govern-

ment of the

United States and the

calculated policy

of the American

ruling. circles.

For 400 years now,

Black people inside the United States

have been the long-suffering victims

of fascist violence and repression.

But under the Nixon-Pentagon clique,

this reactionary violence and repres-

sion has been escalated to new heights

of barbaric cruelty. At the sametime,

in order to put down the already gi-

gantic and still growing mass move-

ment among White Americans against

the wreckless

and sanguinary poli-

cies and imperialist adventures of

the

U.S.

government,

the cowardly

Nixon-Pentagon clique has unleashed

a bloodbath against the Americanpeo.

ple as

a whole, creating for itself

new enemies who have joined hands

with those who were already deter-

mined to carry out a struggle to the

bitter end against an economic, polit-

ical, and social system that is do-

minated by the

madmen

in the

entagon and that is responsible

e misery and bloodshed all over t

Chairman Mao Tse Tung captures

the trulk of the situation when he

points out the unprecedented isula-

tion

of the Nixon-Pentagon clique.

Never before

have these criminals

been so exposed and isolated as the

are loday.

And never before has i

been so

clear that this criminalits

can only be ended by the people rising

up to seize their oun destiny from

the handfull of willful exploiters and

murderers that now have the power

in their hands.

Coupling

a revolutionary

arms with revolutionary optimism in

the assurance of victory, Chairman

Mao Tse Tung, the great leader o

the Chinese Revolution, hero and tea

cher of the revolutionary people ‹

he world, has performed an inva

uable service to all mankind by step-

ping forward at this time to renew

the people's indictment of the commor

enemy of us all--U.S. Fascism and

Imperialist Aggression. These coura-

geous words of Chairman Mao Ise

Tung will give new heart to the peo-

ples in their lonely anddifficult strug-

gles to throw off the shackles and

chains of oppression now being held

in place by U.S.

Fascism and Im-

perialism.

Lastly, we wish to point out that

only the enemies of the people and

hose who shirk their revolutionar

luties and who are afraid of thei

own shadows will find fault with Chair-

man Mao Ise Tung's declaration. For

Tunstall, and Special Agent Paul Daly of the Legal Counsel Division

met with Jack Smith and Lester B. Seidel of the SSC staff.

At the outset Mr. Seidel indicated that SSC would do case .

studies on various organizations against which the COINTELFRO was

directed. Black Panther Party (BPP) had been chosen for the start

because many BPP members had been involved in and convicted of

criminal activity. He distributed copies of a document la copy of

which is attached) outlining the purpose of the meeting and setting

out requests that will be made of the Bureau through appropriate

channels in connection with this case study. Included in this

document, along with requests for various Bureau documents regarding

COINIELPRO as it pertains to the BPP, were requests for a list of

all local police departments and personnel contacted, a list of all

media persons contacted and a list of all FBI personnel

connected,

with this program and their present locations.

The investigative responsibilities of the Bureau, as

relates to the BPP, were described generally to Messrs. Seidel and

Smith highlighting the origin of this violence-prone organization

and the series of violent confrontations in which it participated in

the late 1960s. Mr. Seidel stated that he was specifically interested

in ascertaining the extent of COINTELPRO and how it related to the

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re:

SENSTUDY 75

62-116395

instances of institution of counterintelligence activities were

discussed, and it was indicated that these activities were minor as

far as the overall BPP investigation was concerned.

In connection with COINTELPRO, the Bureau letter to

SAC, San Francisco dated 5/11/70 captioned "Counterintelligence and

Special Operations" was discussed. Basically, this letter suggests

San Francisco consider a proposal that through the use of documents

subtly incorporating false information, attempt to give the BPP

the impression that the documents were stolen by a disgruntled

police employee who is sympathetic to the Panthers. This

document was presented to the House of Representatives Committee on

Internal Security in 1974 and was included in their publication of

hearings conducted by that Committee.

Messrs. Seidel and Smith

wanted to know if the activities outlined in this letter had been

implemented by the San Francisco or Los Angeles Offices. He was

advised that this letter was not implemented as it had

requested

comments and recommendations of the San Francisco Office, and that

Office had recommended against the proposals contained therein.

Mr. Seidel asked the identity of the SAC who recommended

against this proposal and was advised that the SAC there, at that

time, would not necessarily have had personal knowledge of the matter.

He then asked identity of supervisor who recommended against proposal

and was advised this information was available in the field office.

Concerning COINTELPRO in general, he inquired as to specific

techniques used against the BPP and whether forgery and wiretaps

had been a part of the program. He was advised that we were unable

to furnish that information without extensive file review.

• Mr. Seidel attempted to discuss Special Operations but

he was advised that the matter was not within the purview of the

current meeting.

Mr. Seidel explained that they would be traveling to

San Francisco and intended to interrogate personnel in that Office

as well as unspecified outsiders who may have been involved in

COINTELPRO. Mr. Seidel stated that he had asked for the meeting

with Bureau personnel to obtain background data to aid them in these

interrogations. Both Messrs. Seidel and Smith expressed

appreciation for the assistance given them at this meeting and

both additionally expressed their feeling that the Bureau had

done a good and proper job in its investigation.

During the course of this meeting a monograph on the

BPP prepared by the Bureau in March of 1971 was used for back-

ground data. Mr. Seidel expressed a desire to have a copy of this

document. This document, which is prepared from public source

The purpose of this memorandum is to advise that

a representative of captioned Committee requested to be given a

briefing concerning counterintelligence programs as applied to our

investigation of the Black Panther Party in San Francisco.

Lester Seidel, staff member of captioned Committee

who is assigned the area of COINTELPROS, advised that the

Committee is preparing what he termed case studies on COINTELPROS

in four separate areas. He defined these areas as the Black Panther

Party in San Francisco, White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan of Mississippi,

the Professor Morris J. Starsky incident, and the Fred Hampton case

(Black Panther Party leader in Chicago who was killed during a police

raid in Chicago, Illinois).

Seidel previously had requested the Bureau arrange

interviews of various Bureau personnel whom he considered familiar

with the San Francisco Black Panther Party investigation, and at that

time stated he intended to interview these individuals in two or three

weeks. Mr. Seidel requested that prior to conducting interviews

concerning this particular area, he desired to be briefed during the

week of June & concerning the Bureau's general overall investigation

of the Black Panther Party in San Francisco, along with the use of

counterintelligence proposals against that organization. In this regard

he desired that someone knowledgeable in this aspect be made available

to brief him concerning this matter.

On 6/9/75, Mr. K. William O'Connor telephonically

advised me that the Committee is interested in information concerning

certain electronic surveillance coverage instituted at the rèquest of the

White House concerning seventeen individuals. Mr. O'Connor said that

he understands that a letter was addressed to the White House by the

Bureau furnishing copies of documents that summarized the information

available to the Bureau concerning the alleged seventeen wiretaps.

Mr. O'Connor requested that he be briefed concerning this matter

in order for him to discuss the Committee's requests.

It appears that Mr. O'Connor may be referring to a letter

dated July 23, 1974, that was addressed to Mr. George P. Williams,

Associate Counsel to the President, at the White House. A memorandum

was addressed to the Attorney General also dated July 23, 1974, captioned

"Electronic Coverage Placed At The Request of the White House," which

advised the Department that pursuant to the authorization of the Deputy

Attorney General certain documents had been furnished to Mr. Williams

at the White House.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the Intelligence Division identify the materials involved

in Mr. O'Connor's request and provide him with an appropriate briefing.

it necessary to release these exhibits to the Senate Select Committee,

I requeat the enclised coples, which have been excised in an attempt to

avoid intrusions upon individuals' right of privacy and compromise of

of the Department of our objection and our desire that excisions be made

it we are overruled. Mr. O'Connor suggested the excised material be

prepared on an expedite basis. It appears the Department will make

available these exhibits to the Senate Select Committee but we feel we

should be on record as relates to FBI recommendations and objections.

This letter and exhibits A through E, which will be made

the interviewers had asked her concerning her knowledge of

what might have been in certain cartons which were reportedly

stored in the recreation room area of the late Director's

residence.

Mrs. Skillman stated that she thought these cartons

contained many of the gifts and mementos that had

been collected

by Mr. Hoover over a period of years.

After consulting with

Mr. Mohr, she realized that she knew

this only from comments

that had been made to her by Mr. Mohr and had no firsthand

knowledge of the contents of the cartons.

On Mr. Mohr's advice,

she advised the interviewers that she had no firsthand

knowledge of what was in the cartons but that she knew that

Mr. Mobr was aware of what was in them because he was present

when the appraisers of Mr. Tolson's estate inventoried the

entire house including these cartons.

At the conclusion of

the interview,

Mr. Gittenstein commented to Mr. Mohr that he

might have further questions to ask him concerning the contents

The purpose of this memorandum is to advise that

Newark office secretaries, Mary Ann Massa and M. Ann

Mierzejewski for interview by captioned Committee-and that

the Department and White House had instructed that they not

be made available until such time as the Committee decides

to allow Bureau representatives to be present during inter-

view.

By way of background, you will recall that these

employees were released from the Employment Agreement and

were made

available for interview on May 20, 1975, by

captioned Committee.

However, the Department in objection

stated that they were desirous that a Bureau representative

be present during the interview.

The topic of the interview

was to have been their dupies and responsibilities during

the period of July to September, 1964, in connection with the

Democratic National Convention, Atlantic City, New Jersey.

Ultimately, neither the Department nor the White House could

reach agreement concerning the interviews and the employees

did not submit to interview.

On June 3, 1975, Michael Epstein, staff member

of captioned Committee again requested these employees be

made available for interview on June 5, 1975, at 10:00 a.m.

The scope of the interview would be the responsibilities and

duties performed during the period of July to September, 1964,

in connection with the Democratic National Convention in

Atlantic City, New Jersey.

Memo from Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams

SENSTUDY 75

Mr. Epstein classified the interview as an "abuse"

type and agreed to allow agents to be available but not present

during interview.

On June 3, 1975, K. William O'Conner, Special Counsel

to the Deputy Attorney General for Intelligence Coordination,

was advised of the request and of the fact that an agent could

not be present during interview. He stated that the Department's

position was that unless the Committee consented to allow Bureau

personnel to be present, the interview would not go forth, and

that he would advise Epstein and F. A. O. Shwartz, Chief Counsel

of the Committee, of this decision.

Mr. O'Conner telephonically recontacted Special Agent

Daly and advised that he discussed the matter with assistant

to the Counsel oS the President, James A. Wilderotter.

Wilderotter told O'Conner it was the White House position that

these girls should not be made available for interview unless

the Committee allows Bureau personnel to be present. Wilderotter

stated these two employees had been cited as examples wherein

the White House felt interviews should not be conducted without

representatives of the particular agency or Bureau being present

as they are service personnel. According to Wilderotter, Shwartz

agreed to this position.

O'Conner telephonically contacted Special Agent Daly

on June 4, 1975,

at which time he advised that he had discussed

the interview with Shwartz, Epstein, and staff member Mark

Gitenstein, and they would hold in abeyance the request to

interview the employees pending a review of documents the Bureau

Dear Mr. Jones:

As you are aware, I have been concerned for some time about the nature of the

Bureau's involvement in local law enforcement attairs.

This concern has been

heightened by my appointment to the House Select Committee to Investigate the

U. S. Intelligence Community. In this light, I am requesting answers to the

following questions concerning FBI activity in Berkeley:

1. What is the size of the contingent of agents in the Berkeley field office?

2. What are the functional responsibilities in the field office, and what are

the percentages of agents involved in each, i.e., political, drug abuse,

criminal, etc.?

3. What are the titles of the agents, and how do these relate to their

involvement

in category two?

4. What is the ethnic and sexual breakdown of the staff and agents in the

Berkeley field office?

5. What are the interactions and working relationships between the field

office, the Berkeley Police Department, the University of California

Police Department, private security agencies and informers? How many

informers are utilized by the field office?

6.

Recent disclosures have raised serious questions regarding the Bureau's

involvement in political surveillance activities of organizations and

individuals over the past several years. What actions has the local

field office taken to correct the abuses of these actions, and what

political surveillance is being undertaken?

To clarify your inquirics, it should be noted

There are currently nineteen Special Agents

The function of a resident agency is to handle

This includes criminal, security and

As a matter of policy, the EBI advises other

governmental lay entorcement agencies of matters coming

jurisdiction of those agencies.

!

recommended that a draft of the proposed Memorandum of Understanding

concerning clearance procedures for Staff Members of the captioned

Committees be coordinated with Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and

other appropriate members of the intelligence community.

On 6/2/75 the draft Memorandum of Understanding was dis-

cussed by SA L. F. Schwartz with Mr. John M. Clarke, Associate

Deputy, Intelligence Community Staff, and Mr. Donald E. Moore,

Chairman, Security Committee, U. S. Intelligence Board, who advised

that the

draft had been reviewed by CIA and by the Security

Committee on behalf of the intelligence community. They requested

that the draft be revised in order to recognize the need for certain

Staff Members to be cleared for access to compartmented information

(a procedure already being followed by the Church Committee) and

the desire of the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) that it

be made clear that the DCI will only offer his advice upon the

request of the Comnittee Chairman and that in all cases the final

determination as to clearance is the responsibility of the Commitfee

Chairman.

•

Attached is a revised draft of the Memorandum of

Understanding incorporating the changes proposed by Mr. Clarkeand3

Mr. Moore which changes are underscored.

Both Mr. Clarke and

Mr. Moore were of the opinion that since Senator Church's Committee

was already following the procedures outlined in the Memorandum of

Understanding, and had completed the Committee Staff, it would be

inappropriate to furnish a gie-lou

of the Memorandum of Understanding

to Senator Church.

Mr. Adams memorandum to Mr. Callahan dated 3/7/75,

captioned as above, copy attached, reported our conversation with

Senator Church and Congressman Nedzi.

As indicated in Mr. Adams' memorandum, Congressman

Nedzi asked that we prepare a memorandum of understanding to be

approved by CIA, FBI, and the House Committee concerning

investigative and clearance procedures for members of the Committee's

staff. It appeared appropriate to us to coordinate a memorandum

of understanding to be drafted for the House Committee with that to be

drafted for the Senate Committee. Therefore, following our return from

the meeting with Senator Church and Congressman Nedzi, I called Bill

Miller and advised him of the request made by Congressman Nedzi for us

to prepare a proposed memorandum of understanding. I asked him whether?

it would be possible for us to coordinate the language of that memorandum

with the understanding that it will be drafted for use by the CIA, other

members of the intelligence community, and the Church Committee. Mr.

Willer said that the proposal to coordinate the memorandum was completer

acceptable to him and he requested that the draft memorandum being

prepared for Congressman Nedzi be furnished him for review and possible

adoption as the memorandum to be used by the Senate Committee.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the Intelligence Division discuss this matter with

Wannall

representatives of CIA and other appropriate members of the intelligence

community and prepare a draft memorandum of understanding that may be

used by both House and Senate committees.

On 3/7/75 Mr. Mintz and I called on Senator Church and his

staff director, Bill Miller, to further discuss the procedures for

investigating and clearing staff employees of the Committee, particularly

where information might be developed raising a question as to the propriety

of a clearance. It had previously been approved that the FBI would conduct

the background investigations, furnishing the results to Senator Church,

and after his determination that the individuals met the required criteria

for access to classified information he would notify CIA of his determination

and intent to employ the individual involved, at which time CIA would grant

the necessary clearance based on the certification by Senator Church.

In discussions between CIA and FBI representatives, we raised

the question as to whether CIA would review the results of the investigation

prior to granting clearances and CIA representatives indicated they did

not intend to and were reluctant to inquire of Senator Church as to whether

they could be furnished the results of any investigations involving derogatory

information.

In discussing this matter with Senator Church, I inquired whether

he had any objection to our bringing to the attention of CIA any questionable

cases in order that CIA representatives, who have the responsibility of

granting the actual clearances, would be in a position to advise and counsel

with Senator Church on those individual cases. He had absolutely no objection

to this and, in fact, felt there should be an open communication between

FBI, CIA and his Committee to insure that no one was appointed and cleared

who did not measure up in every respect from a security standpoint.

I discussed With him the particular case of stanley hawson sloan,

the results of which I had brought for delivery to Senator Church. Sloan was

Re: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

formerly employed by CIA and resigned in December, 1974, after his

clearance for sensitive compartmented intormation had been lifted as a

result of his marrying an alien. This marriage would not preclude him

from clearance for access to lesser degrees of sensitive material but

only for the more sophisticated clearances. Mr. Miller advised that Sloan

had not been appointed and was not going to be appointed because of other

reasons unrelated to a security clearance.

Senator Church indicated that he felt it would be wise to prepare

a memorandum outlining our security clearance procedures and his staff

would be glad to prepare such a document.

Following the meeting with Senator Church, Mr. Mintz and I

dropped by to see Congressman Nedzi, Chairman of the House Committee,

and delivered to him Mr. Kelley's letter congratulating him and offering

him our complete cooperation. Chairman Neazi Stated that he was very

appreciative of this offer and would consider Mr. Kelley's request to confer

with him as an open invitation and as soon as things had shaken down he would

be in touch with us.

We discussed with him the investigative and clearance procedures

we were following with the Senate Committee and Chairman Nedzi agreed

the same procedures should be followed with his Committee, including our

making available to CIA any derogatory information which might be pertinent to

a clearance determination. At first, he suggested that we send the results

of our investigations to CIA before coming to the Committee but then

concluded that it would be more appropriate for them to come to him first

since some of the applicants under consideration would probably not be

appointed. He specifically asked that we prepare a memorandum of under - i:

standing to be approved by CIA, FBI and himself.

I asked Mr. Nedzi whether he felt the formulation of his Committee

would serve to trim down the number of requests for information being received

from various House committees and it was his opinion that it would help in

some instances; however, in others committee chairmen would pursue their

own inquiries. He personally did not feel he had the clout nor the desire to

try to preempt this area entirely for his Committee. He also stated he

felt that CIA's problems had in the main been fully exposed and would soon be

of less concern, whereas the concern over domestic security policies of

the FBI would undoubtedly be greater in the future. He expressed his

appreciation for our cooperation and indicated he was striving for a

responsible approach to the inquiry.

Following the meeting with Mr. Nedzi, Mr. Mintz and I agreed

that it would be best for us to prepare a proposed memorandum of under-

standing concerning the investigative and clearance procedures for both

Committees in order to try to insure uniformity, and Mr. Mintz will get

in touch with Bill Miller to seek his concurrence in that regard. Our efforts

will be coordinated with CIA and the proposed memorandum as drawn up

will be submitted for the Director's approval.

ONINTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

On May 27, 1975, James A. Wilderotter, Associate Coursel

to the President, requested me and representatives of other agencies interested

in the arrangements concerning interviews of witnesses by the Senate Select

Committee to confer with him and Roderick Hills at 2:30 p.m. that date

at the White House. Mr. K. William O'Connor, Deputy Assistant Attorney

General, Inspector John B. Hotis and I represented the Department and the

FBI. Roderick Hills and James A. Wilderotter represented the President's

counsel; Bob Andrews represented the Defense Department; John Warner,

General Counsel, CIA; Roy Banner, General Counsel of NSA, and Mr. Hyland

from State Department as well as John Clark, Deputy to the Director of

CIA, attended.

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the latest version of

proposed procedures to be followed by the Committee staff investigators

during interviews of former and current employees. Roderick Hills presented a

document (copy attached) which he described as a counteroffer by Frederick

Schwarz, Counsel to the Committee. He called for general discussion of the

W

document after indicating that he had discussed this matter with Mr. Schwarz

at lunch on May 27th and felt that it was a workable document. I pointed out to

Mr. Hills that the document provides that there would be notice to the agencies

of the identity of witnesses a reasonable time prior to interviews or taking of

sworn testimony except where 'the committee or its appropriate delegee"

determines that prior notice should not be given. I told him that I was concerned

that that provision would be used by the Committee staff to permit individual

Memorandum to Mr. Adams

Re: Senate Select Committee, etc.

Mr. Hills was reluctant to seek a modification of the language

indicating that he had an understanding with Mr. Schwarz that the authority

would be limited to the senior counsel and to members of the Committee.

I told Mr. Hills I would request that the language be modified in writing

so that the authority would be conferred on specific representatives of the

Committee to avoid having staff authority which I thought would be abused.

Mr. His finally agreed that the language would be modified so that the

authority would be available only to both Committee senior counsel and/or

a combination of senior counsel and a Committee member. Further, the

language would be modified to require that the determination that an agency

would not be given prior notice of a pending witness interview would be

recorded in writing for the Committee's records.

I asked Mr. Wilderotter and Mr. Hills whether this agreement

was to be made between the staff and the agencies or whether it in fact would be

accepted by the Committee. After some discussion, we were advised by

Mr. Hills and Mr. Wilderotter that the document would be submitted to the

full Committee for their approval and incorporated into the Committee's

records.

I pointed out that I believed it was necessary for the understanding

to be made between the Committee and the Executive in order for there to be

some basis for restraining Committee staff investigators who may not

be inclined to follow the rules.

Other proposed changes discussed would require the Committee

represetative to furnish to a witness a copy of the Committee's rules which

includes advice concerning the right to counsel and a copy of the proposed

guidelines for witness interviews.

I recommended that the guidelines be expanded to address the

problem of existing secrecy agreements with former and present employees

and the procedural problem involved in Attorney General Order 501-73

which requires prior Departmental approval in order for a witness to

respond to a subpoena. As a result, Mr. Wilderotter advised on the

morning of May 28, 1975, that he would recommend the addition of a sentence

in the opening paragraph that would indicate the guidelines would not be

understood to impair the constitutional rights of individual witnesses, agency

agreements with employees or former employees, existing Departmental

orders or the Committee's own rules.

Other minor changes were considered and an effort will be made

to correct the language so that the agencies will be obliged to make reasonable

efforts to comply with all Committee requests instead of being required to

furnish "all information" absolutely.

Mr. Wilderotter advised on the morning of May 28th that the

comments described above will be discussed with Frederick Schwarz in an

effort to finally resolve this matter.

RECOMMENDATION:

For information.

Select Committee or some agency under investigation may have

reason not to follow these suggested guidelines.

Also, it is recognized that this ouiline is without prejudice

to the respective legal positions of the agencies and the Select

Committee as to the productiont e it information by way os

documents or testimony.

distinct natures.

cerning (A) the overall structure and functions

of any agency or its relationship with other

des ping.

Those primarily concerning specific allegations

of agency or Executive branch abuses or other

controversial specific matters where there is

reason to believe improprieties may have occurred.

An agency representative will be present, as a general rule,

at interviews/preliminary testimony in the first category for the

purpose of assisting the Committee's investigation and facilitating

the protection of information important to the national interest which

is pertinent to the investigation. Similarly, as a general rule,

agency representatives will not be present ai interviews/preliminary

testimony in the second category. The parties recognize, however,

that for special reasons exceptions can be made in either case: i.e.,

when good reason exists, endorsed by the Select Committee, agency

representatives may not be present for interviews/preliminary

testimony falling under the firsi category, and for good and sufficient

reason the agency may seek to have a representative present in the

second category subject to the approval, of course, of the Select

Committee

B. Procedures to be Employed in Category (2).

When the Select Committee has identified a specific subject

as a potential abuse or impropriety and has so notified the agency

involved of its designation, that agency will, subject to the second

sentence hereof, makelevery effort to provide the Select Committee

with all information and materials that it has on the subject. There

will be a mutual effort by the Committee and the agencies to provide

special handling techniques to convey or secure any particularly

sensitive information or materials as appropriate.

In abuse or impropriety interviews/preliminary testimony,

the following procedures will prevail.

(1) Witnesses wili be identified to the agency a reasonable

time prior to interviews or taking sworn testimony. This general

rule includes current employees, former employees or others who

have or have had a relationship with the agency.

to consult with the agency prior to his appearance, the Committee :

will not discourage or seek to interfere with that desire in any. way

(3) Whenever they are not present at interviews or the

taking of sworn statements, agency representatives will be

available for consultations regarding the handling of special

security matters.

(4) Whether or not an agency has notice of an interview

or sworn statement. the Committee will inform the agency of the

general substantive points covered as soon as possible thereafter,

unless disclosure of the substance of a particular interview would

make discernible the identity of a confidential source. In such

cases, the Committee shall, to the extent feasible without under-

cutting that decision, notify the agency in general terms of the

points of areas covered, and the fact that it has interviewed a

witness on such matters.

(5) Whenever an agency receives prior notice of a particular

interview or taking of a sworn statement, it will also be notified

of the general subject areas and periods of employment in which

the Committee is primarily interested. The agency will then check

the subject's personnel history file and advise the Committee of

any exceptionally sensitive aspects of the subject's employment

of activity which require special handling.

(6) If because of concern about security of sensitive infor-

mation,

a witness feels unable to give a responsive answer to a

particular question, the witness

shall so indicate to the interviewer.

facilitate the provision of pertinent information and its protection.

should be worked out forthwith and ordinarilv before

the close of the interview/testimony session.

(7) The Committee is responsible for providing special

handling of interview notes and other working notes in a manner

which will protect sensitive material. At the conclusion of the

Committee's inquiry, the Cornmittee will consult with the agencies

concerned regarding the appropriate disposition of any such notes

which have not been destroyed following the preparation of finished

Committee documents. The agencies will indicate which of these

notes it feels are too sensitive to be stored under the Archives
