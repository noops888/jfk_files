ramifications, and the Department still has a copy in its

possession."

Major Miles advised that the White House is in

possession of a copy of this document and it was his impression

that Mr. James A. Wilderotter, Associate Counsel to the

President, is aware of its existence. He also advised that

members of the ssc, with the knowledge of CIA Director Colby,

have had access to

this document if not a copy of same in

their possession. Major Miles, upon instruction of John Clarke,

is visiting the various members of the intelligence community

mentioned by CIA in the document for the purpose of briefing

them concerning its existence and those portions which may

pertain to those agencies.

He indicated that he had the

previous day briefed General Allen, Director of National

Security Agency (NSA), and Mr. Benson Buffham, Deputy Director.

From the document which Major Miles kept in his possession

at all times,

he cited numerous pages which made reference,

to the FBI. The following items? & which are deemed pertinent

for mention at this time and worthyroferesearchcare:

May, 1972, breakin in the Chilean Embassy,

stated that no investigation was being conducted by the

/FBI in view of lack of jurisdiction.

Pages 457-458 - Information concerning CIA counterintelligence

operation including forcible entry and removal of

documents in 1962 against an unnamed foreign establishment

in the United States. Top United States officials,

including President Kennedy, were briefed concerning

this operation. Then Attorney General Robert Kennedy

after being briefed stated the operation was not to be

called to the attention of the FBI unless FBI first

initiated inquiry. It is to be noted former Bureau

Liaison officer Sam Papich was queried concerning this

matter in recent interview by SSC representatives.

Page 459 - Information concerning controversy between former

CIA Director McCone and Bureau official Mr. Belmont

regarding Bureau's opposition to CIA recommendation that

there be an extensive broadening of counterintelligence

activities against diplomatic establishments in this

country.

OBSERVATIONS:

Contact this date with Department officials elicited

that four Department attorneys, including K. William O'Connor,

Special Counsel For Intelligence Caordination, OffIce SE

Deputy Attorney General,

reviewed the above 693-page

document and have furnished additional sanitized documents

of interest from a prosecutive standpoint.

From the above, it is obvious that this Bureay, in

order to be in a position to knowledgeably and accurately

reply to SSC inquiries and to fully identify operations listed

above, should first obtain a copy of the'

above 693-page
