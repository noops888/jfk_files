7 June 1966

SUBJECT: MAHEU, Robert A.

1. Robert A. Mabeu, a personnel relations executive and

former F.B.I. Agent, has been utllized by the Office of Security

on many sensitive ausigaments slace the early fifties. Ho has

also on several occasions been cleared for use by the DD/P is

various capacities. He does business a8 Robert A. Maheu, Asso-

ciates, and maintains offices in Washington, D. C.; and Los

Angeles, California, where he is now residing.

2. It has come to our attention that the Senate Subcommittee

inveatigating wiretapping activities (Long Committee) has expressed

considerable interest in Maheu. He has never been asked to per-

form any technical survelllance on our behalf.

3. The first inkling we had that the Long Committee was

interested in Maheu came to our attention through the OGC.

MI. Lawrence Houston advised that Walter Yeagley, Assistant

Attorney General, Internal Security Division, had casually mentioned

to him that he had bean advised by Raymond A. Taggart, an AlD

employee, that he may be called upon to testify before the Long

Committee regarding his activitios while employed by Maheu (1954-55).

4. The only significant association the Agency had with Maheu.

during that period involved the struggle between two Greek Industrial

giants, Stavros Niarchus and Aristottle Onassis. Maheu had been

retained as a trouble shooter for Niarchus. Onassis had just con-

cluded a pact with King Saud which would allow him to control approxi-

mately 90 percent of the oil shipments out of Saudi Arabia. In con-

sumating the deal, he allegedly employed every trick in the book.

His achievement caused much consternation among the British,

German, and American interests. Niarchus also realized as a

result of this the balance of power and influence weighed heavily in

favor of Onassis in their own private battle. It was this mutual

concern of the United States and Niarchus that set the stage for

a joint venture. Niarchus supplied the money, personnel, and

documenta; the Agency furnished the communications, courter

facilities, and disection in the form of our Commo channel, pouch

syatem, and the NEA Division's expertise and guidance.

5. Spyridon Catapodis, & Greek Broker, who had an ax to

grind against Onassis an & result of being manipulated out of a

handsome commiasion he belleved due bim for his interceasion

with certain Saudi officials to secure oil rights for Onassis, spear-

headed a campaign to publicize Onasals' high-handed methode of

operation. This triggered off all sorts of international litigations

which erupted into suits and countersuite by all parties concerned.

Of particular note was the case of Catapodis va. Onanals, which

suit was tiled in New York State. While Niarchus was being exam-

ined before trial by Onassis' attornay, he claimed Government

privllege in answering certain questions. This tact was challenged

by the attorney and pursued to the point that eventually it was re-

corded in the briafs filed by both the plaintiff and the defendent that

ClA was, in fact, the Government agency of interest. Close coor-

dination was maistained during this parlod with Justice and State.

At our requeat a representative of the U. S. Attorney's Offico in

New York monitored all of the Hearings. Mt. Houston is intimately

familiar with the actions la this case, and copies of his memoranda

pertinent to it are contained in his files.

6. The Security file on Subject contains a Covert Security

Clearance Issued 16 August 1954 at the request of NE/2. Att:

William Miller, for Maheu's use on Project IWIXT. Other inter-

osted DD/P personnel were identified as William F. Rowland,

Mr. Maheu was contacted to determine whether the Com-

mittee had been in touch with him.

He stated he was not aware of

their interest in him. When the Taggart conversation was men-

tloned, he promptly replied that it must be the Onassis operation

they are looking into. He recalled that he had Onassia' New York

office "covered" sometime during the period. John Frank, a

former stall employse, and then a private Investigator, was en-

gaged to arrange for the coverage. Maheu could only idently the

technician by the name of Leos. Presumably, thie coverage was

done as a routine technique to keep the Narchus interests Informed

on Onassis' movements. This was not initiated at the request of

any Agency component so far as out records indicate.

8. Subsequently, Maheu advised be had received a message

from one of the Committee's attorneys named Homme who wanted

to fly out to talk with him. Mabeu fended him off by saying ho was

tled up for the next several days. He then contacted his attorney,

Edward P. Morgan, of Washington, D. C.. and it was decided that

Morgan would meet him in St. Louls on 24 May for a conference.

9. On Thursday morning, 26 May, Maheu called to advise

that he was at the Madison Hotel, Washington, D. C.. and was

antlous to talk with us. At his request it was arranged to have

Colonel Edwards accompany a membes of this office to meet with

htos.

10. Mabeu opened the conversation by announcing that be bad

been selacted to be the star performer on a planned TV hearing

which is scheduled to open within the next few weeks. He went on

to give the basis for this statement in the following detall.

When he first talked to Ed Morgan of the possibility

of his being subpoenaed, Morgan assured bim that he

had nothing to be concerned about inasmuch as he was

a very close friend of Senator Long's personal attorney

who had considerable influence upon the Senator.. The

lawyer resides in St. Louls, and he suggested that they

both go out and solicit his assistance. After the preaen-

tation of the facts, all three flew to Washington where

the lawyer secured an appointment with the Senator.

Mr. Bernard Fensterwald was in attendance at the

meeting. He identified himself as the Chief Attorney

for the Committee. According to Maheu, Fensterwald

made it clear that Maheu was their ace in the hole and

without him the Hearings would have no appeal. He

implied that Maheu's clients and their opposition added

up to a very attractive package. Such headliners

as Niarchus, Onasals, Dave McDonald, and Howard

Hughes are hard to come by. Fensterwald further

referred to Maheu as the type who employed the

tochaique of cutting the Government in just enough

on his touchy operations to permit him to bide bebind

thelr akirts 1f be were caught. It is the opinion of

the lawyer that, unless the Senator can be convlaced

to the contrary, be will proceed with plans on schedule.

11, Mahou's most active account and, at this time, almost

exclusive client in Howard Hughes, La the past he did considerable

work fos Dave McDonald,. former president of the United Steel

Workers. So far as this office knows, the Agency never had any.

interest in either of these clients. However,. It should be noted that

the IO. Diviston was granted a Covert Security Approval on 4 June

1959 to approach Mahou and advise him of the Agency's interest in

international labor.. Mabeu claims ho never became involved la any

"bugging" operation for either of thens accounts.

12.

It is not believed that Mabeu wants of expects us to front

for him in

'the Onasais tap matter. As mentioned previously, to our

knowledge this was not Agency sponsored. However, If exploited,

it would probably eventually lead to exposing our part in the Onassis/

Niarchus feud.

As it is a matter of court record, it could not be

denied nor buried. Even though the detaile might be protected by

a doclaration that it involved classifled operational information, it

would set up a field day fos the press and critice of the Agency.

13. Mt. Mahou ls presently furnishing cover for a DODs stail

agent in his Washington, D. C., office. In this connection, two of

Maheu's employees have been cleared and witting. Other clearance

actions noted were: CSA granted FI/Plans, Cover Division on

30 August 1954 for use under LPHIDDEN; CSA issued to NE Division

on 7 October 1959 for Maheu's use In the United States and (Jordan) 1f

14. In 1958-59, Maheu was used by the FE Divialon in two

sensitive oporations targetod against Sukarao. Mr. Allen Dulles

was aware and approved of these operationn. Mr. Joseph Smith

who was then Chief/PMI, is knowledgeable of the actions.

15. While none of our interests in Mabeu relate to wire-

tapping, it is evident that the extensive and diversified use of him

makes us vulnerable to exploitation should he be interrogatod in

depth regarding his activities.

16. Mr. Maheu is maintaining a cooperative attitude and

has promised to do all in his power to protoct the Agency from

embarrassment or compromise.
