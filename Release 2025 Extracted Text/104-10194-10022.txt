MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Balmes N. Hidalgo, Jr.
SUBJECT
: Exceptional Service Emblem
1. Your request for consideration to receive the Exceptional
Service Emblem has been reviewed by this office to determine your
eligibility for the award. With considerable regret, I must concur in
the assessment that the injuries you suffered in the line of duty do not
fall under the special criteria governing award of the Exceptional -
Service Emblem. Hazardous duties, in the meaning of the governing
regulation, relate to duties performed in areas in which internal strife,
civil disturbances or hostile action by armed forces or persons un-
friendly to the United States were present at the time the injury was
Incurred, or, relate to duties performed in an assignment defined as
hazardous due to unusual geographic or other natural conditions.
2. You may be sure that this decision has been based upon
thoughtful deliberation. Please accept my personal thanks for a job
well done under difficult conditions.
