F. Interviews of Subject
Another Government agency that conducts security
investigations interviewed ROBERT SCHEER July 11, 1958,
August 10, 1961 and August 16, 1961, the last interview
being under oath. During the interviews, SCHEER stated
that while in college he attended a few meetings which he
felt were run by someone who could have been in the Labor
Youth League (LYL) and had attended one social event
which he felt was definitely sponsored by LYL, but explained
that he had gone to this affair to meet a girl. He said he
never attended a political meetings of LYL and added that
he has never been a member of the CP or any organization
cited by the Attorney General. SCHEER admitted having
read the "Communist Manifesto" frequently and studied it
as an example of ideological development.
SCHEER said under oath that he did not consider
the CP, USA to be a threat to the United States and had no
reason to believe that a person who joins the CP swears
allegiance to a foreign power or advocates the overthrow of
the United States Government. He said he believes that the
CP is not subversive because it claims to be interested in
bringing about its program through democratic process.
SCHEER refused to discuss his trip to Cuba in 1960 and
refused to discuss his membership, activities or associations
with the Student Fair Play for Cuba Committee (SFPCC) under
protection of the First and Fifth Amendments.
SCHEER stated under oath that he has never been
arrested and that he considers he owes his allegiance to
the United States, but does not believe in the philosophy

G. Birth of a Child
Records of the Department of Health, Alameda
County Courthouse, Oakland, were checked on April 29, 1968
by IC ROBERT L. GIBSON and a record was found of a birth
of a son named CHRISTOPHER WARREN SCHEER, born September
8, 1967 at Berkeley, California to ANNE BUTTERFIELD WEILLS
SCHEER and ROBERT SCHEER, 6468 Benvenue Avenue, Oakland,
California.
H. Marital Discord
ROBERT SCHEER has been living at his home, 6468
Benvenue Avenue, Oakland, California, since about September
7, 1968. On September 26, 1968, Mrs. ANNE SCHEER told some
of the neighbors that she and ROBERT SCHEER were separating
because they live different kinds of lives. ANNE SCHEER
said she was moving to an apartment somewhere near the
Oakland-Berkeley border where she planned to live with a
man named TOM, not further identified, whom she expected to
marry eventually. Mrs. SCHEER was busy removing her
belongings from the residence at 6468 Benvenue Avenue,
Oakland, on September 26, 1968.

ROBERT SCHEER was at his residence, 6468 Benvenue
Avenue, Oakland, on October 19, 1968 and had his infant son
with him. He also has a new girl friend who looks like a
"hippie" who has been at this residence quite a lot in
recent weeks. It is understood that SCHEER's son has been
residing with his mother at a different location.
Mrs. JOHN G. GWILLIAM,
6480 Benvenue Avenue,
Oakland, California
October 21, 1968
Mrs. GEORGIA SWILLIAM, 6480 Benvenue Avenue, Oakland,
California, reported October 14, 1968 that ANNE SCHEER had
been living with THOMAS HAYDEN while ROBERT SCHEER was away
on trips for "Ramparts" magazine and now appears to have
taken their child and both are residing with HAYDEN full
time at HAYDEN's apartment. The SCHEERs reportedly had
reached a mutual agreement to get a divorce.
ROBERT and ANNE SCHEER reside at 6468 Benvenue
Avenue, Oakland, California, and most of the neighbors refuse
to associate with them. There has never been any sign of
emotion or warmth exhibited between them. When THOMAS HAYDEN
arrived in early September 1968, it became very evident that
ANNE SCHEER was very strongly attracted to him in a physical
way. ANNE is believed to have met HAYDEN in Hanoi, North
Vietnam during the summer of 1968. When ROBERT SCHEER made
trips away from home, HAYDEN would move into the SCHEER
residence. During October 1968, ANNE SCHEER indicated she
intended to seek a divorce from ROBERT SCHEER and would move
into the apartment of THOMAS HAYDEN. Beginning about
Christmas, 1968, ANNE SCHEER returned home with the SCHEER
baby and has remained with ROBERT SCHEER for the past month
or more. THOMAS HAYDEN has not been observed in the company
of ANNE SCHEER or visiting the SCHEER residence in more than
one month. There are numerous visitors to the SCHEER
residence and it would appear that several men were living
at this residence regularly in addition to the SCHEERS.
While ANNE SCHEER was in Hanoi, ROBERT SCHEER received a
threat to his life that frightened him greatly. He moved

out of the house immediately and hired a private investigator
who moved into the house "armed to the teeth". It appears
that ROBERT SCHEER has been somewhat frightened ever since
this threat.

THOMAS EMMET HAYDEN was the original

to the "New York Daily News" of January
10, 1968, was one of a party of three
who travelled to North Vietnam in
defiance of US Department of State ban
on such travel.

"RAMPARTS" MAGAZINE
"Pamparts" in a letter to subscribers dated
May 1, 1968, announced that beginning June 1,
1968, it would be published biweekly at a
yearly subscription price of $15. In this
letter "Ramparts" described itself as follows:
"...the first national publication to consis-
tently reveal the ribbon of lies supporting
America's involvement in Vietnam; we stripped
the curtain from America's 'invisible government'
by exposing CIA's unlicensed intrusion into our
domestic lives; we dared to write about the
applications of the Catholic Church's political
power; we warned, years before the Kerner
report, that white racism was the base of
America's racial problems; we blasted away at
the corroded institutions of Cold War liberalism.
"
'Ramparts' is now the largest left-of-center
commercial magazine in the history of the United
States..."

Burning of Draft Card
The cover of the December 1967 issue of "Ramparts"
magazine contains a photograph of four right hands each
holding a burning Selective Service card. One of the cards
is a duplicate issued December 3, 1958 of the "Selective
Service Registration Certificate" for ROBERT SCHEER, 653
Britton Street, New York 67, Bronx.
The San Francisco "Examiner," daily newspaper
published in San Francisco, California, in its issue of
November 16, 1967, carried an article headlined "Ramparts
Editors Burn Draft Cards" which quoted "Publisher MARC
STONE" of "Ramparts" as saying the magazine cover is "a
very serious editorial statement," adding "there is a very
serious political crisis in this country and we want to
show that the bureaucracy of the Selective Service System
is unfair."
The San Francisco "Examiner" daily newspaper,
issue of June 13, 1968, carried a news article "3 Ramparts
officers Before Jury in NY." This article stated that three
top officers of "Ramparts" magazine were called to appear
before a Federal Grand Jury in New York City, June 13, 1968
to testify at an inquiry described only as "having to do with
Selective Service." The article continued by stating that
there was speculation that the investigation dealt with the
cover photograph of the December 1967 issue of "Ramparts",
which pictured the flaming draft cards of 3 top officials.
(Should be four officials.)
The August 24, 1968 issue of "Ramparts" magazine
carried a column entitled, "Apologia," which carried a
reprint of a news article from the "New York Times" news-
paper, issue of July 18, 1968. The article stated that
WARREN HINCKLE, III, ROBERT SCHEER, DUGALD STERMER, and
SOL STEIN, all officials of "Ramparts", appeared before a
Grand Jury in New York City on June 17, 1968, as a result
of the December 1967 cover of "Ramparts" containing a photo-
graph of four hands holding burning draft cards containing
the names of these four men.

J. Threat to Subject's Life
ROBERT SCHEER telephoned the San Francisco FBI
Office on July 8, 1968, to state the receptionist at
"Ramparts" magazine, San Francisco, received the following
telephone message from an anonymous male at 4:45 pm that
day:
"I just want to inform you that we
plan to destroy the Managing Editor,
BOB SCHEER, tomorrow night at 9:00."
SCHEER stated that the New York City Office of
"Ramparts" had received a threat about July 3, 1968 and
he felt that this call resulted from a recent article in
"Ramparts" regarding Cuban refugees. He said he had no
indication that the call was interstate.
The San Francisco "Examiner" newspaper, San
Francisco, California, in its issue of July 9, 1968,
carried a news article headlined, "Ramparts Threatened
By Bombs." The article stated that both the San Francisco
and New York City offices of "Ramparts" had been threatened
by bombs and "Associate Editor ROBERT SCHEER had received
calls threatening his life."
SCHEER advised SA CHARLES E. GALVIN on July 10,
1968, that no one had carried out the threat and that
he would immediately contact the FBI if any future threats
were made.
Records of the Bureau of Criminal Identification
and Investigation (CII), Sacramento, California, reveal
that a .25 calibre Beretta automatic pistol, serial number
415984, was sold to ROBERT SCHEER, 6468 Benvenue Avenue,
Oakland, California, on January 27, 1968, and that this gun
was purchased in Oakland.
Records of the Oakland Police Department were
searched October 17, 1968 by IC ROBERT L. GIBSON and it
was determined that ROBERT SCHEER did not possess a permit
to carry a gun.
