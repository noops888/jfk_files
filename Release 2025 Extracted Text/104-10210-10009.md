INTRODUCTION

The following summary and analysis is not intended to be

all inclusive, that is to contain a specific comment on all organi-

zational, operational, personality and case type information furnished

by Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO. To attempt to do so would be repetitious

and confusing to the reader and would not be of material benefit in the

formation of logical conclusions concerning the rather limited areas of

primary concern.

This summary will not contain a detailed psychological

assessment of NOSENKO nor will it contain a recitation of the numerous

theories which have been promulgated in the past concerning varying

aspects of the NOSENKO case. This summary will be primarily

directed toward the question of whether NOSENKO was or was not

dispatched by the KGB, whether his claimed KGB career is relatively

plausible and whether he has since late October 1967 been cooperative in

a reassessment of the entire case for or against NOSENKO. NOSENKO

has admitted certain lies and exaggerations in the past but claims that

these were of a personal nature, intended to enhance his own importance

SECRET

CLint t69 Eit

SECRET

but not to mislead this Agency in any material matters of an operational

or policy nature.

In order to avoid any misunderstanding of tbe phrase "bona

fides" as considered in this summary, NOSENKO will be judged primarily

on whelter he voluntarily defected to this Agency without KGB knovledge,

and whether his 1962 and early 1964 contacts with representatives of this

Agency were known to the KGB. Motivation and certain other pertinent

aspects will be considered, but his admitted previous errors, lies and

exaggerations will not per se warrant a conclusion that NOSENKO is not a

"uuna fide" defector.

There is not an accurate standard or scale of measurement

against which information concerning NOSENKO can be balanced or

correlated to determine if he is or is not a dispatched KGB officer.

For

purposes of this analysis and summary, an arbitrary list of areas

considered pertinent has been compiled. Readers may differ in regard to

whether this arbitrary siandard is a completely accurate standard, but it

is felt that the information from NOSENKO and information from other

sources derived through independent investigation will permit the reader

to assess the information in toto against any standard he considers

appropriate.

nation of the Bona Fides of a KGB Defector, " has been considered in

SUMMARY OF DEVELOPMENTS IN NOSENKO CASE

SINCE 30 OCTOBER 1967

Since 30 October 1967, interviews with Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO

have been conducted by one individual not previously known personally to

NOSENIO but who has been aware of the NOSENIO case since June 1962.

Interviews have been detailed and very extensive in scope, have

been recorded and transcribed, and have covered the entire life and caree:

of NOSENKO without regard to whether a particular aspect had been.

coverco during previous interview or interviews.

NOSENKO, although naturally apprehensive during the firet few

interviews, has been cooperative, has developed a relaxed attitude, and

the interviewer bas noted no significant reluctance to discuss any aspect

of his life, career, or activities. On occasion MOSENKO has indicated a

reluctance to make positive statements in certain areas previously

considered at a minimum extremely controversial. This reluctance

was understandable and when it became apparent to NOSENKO that the

fad)

interviewer would not dispule or disparage his statements without adequate

reason, this reluciance on ihe pürt of NOSENKO, in the opinion oi the

interviewer, totai; disappeared.

During the interviewing period, particularly in the first six monthe,

MOSENKO materially assisted ine interviewer by preparing approximately

sixty memoranda on such diverse subjects as his life, motivation ior de-

jection, individual cases, notes which he furnished to CIA in 1964, KGB

organization, and KGB officer and agent personalities. As an example

of the scope of this work by NOSENKO, four of the memoranda included

remarie concerning approximately [B75 KGB officers, [O0)KGB agents,

35 GRu nificera, and odother Soviet nationals. The ae lista were alpina-

beticaliy arranged and the above indicated cooperation of NOSENKO has

materially assisted in the organization and evaluation of iniormation

furnished by him during current interviews.

Copies of transcripts of interviews with NOSENKO and related

memoranda have been disseminaied to the FBI and the CI Stafi. Special

Agent Elbert Turner and Special Agent James Wooten of the Washington

Field Office/FBI in particular have given great assistance in research

and compilation of new or additional information and the FBI has inter-

viewed or reinterviewed a number of United States citizens concerning

whom NOSENKO has furnished pertinent information.

ANALYTICAL COMMENTS CONCERNING THE BOYA FIDES OF

YURIY IVANOVICH NOSENKO

As indicated in the irtroduction to this summary, information in

regard to Yuriy ivanovich NOSENKO will be considered against an arbi-

trary but realistic list oí areas considered pertinent to the question of

whether NOSENKO voluntarily defected to this Agency without KGB

knowledge; and whether his. 1962 and early 1964 contacts with represent -

atives of this Agency were known to the KGB.

It was noted that motivation and certain other pertinent aspects

would also be considered but that his admitted previous lies and exag-

gerations would not per se warrant a conclusion that NOSENKO is not a

"bona fide defector."

The following is a list of the areas considered pertinent and which

are being given specific consideration. Attached is a separate section

containing remaris in regard to the designated areas of A - H.

A. IS NOSENKO identical to the person winom he claime

to be?

B. . Is the claimed KGB career of NOSENKO plausible?

D.. Is ine information furnished by NOSENKO to CIA

concerning KGB operations, personalities, and organi-

zation reasonably commensurate with his claimed KGB

career?

E. Can the information furnished by NOSENKO be con-

sidered in toto as having resulted in material damage

to the KGB and/or has the information furnished by

NOSENKO been of significant benefit to Western Intelli-

gence?

F. Is there evidence of KGB deception or "give away" in

information furnished by NOSENKO which would warrant

a conclusion that NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB?

G. Is there evidence of a political or any other type objective

which could justify a dispatch of NOSENKO by the KGB

with permission to speak freely to CIA concerning his

knowledge of the KGB and without NOSENKO being given

a specific mission or missions?

During interviews NOSENKO has furnised detailed information in regard

to his family, his activities as a youth, the schools he attended, assoc-

iates of his father and riother, and his own associates. The period

under consideration in this section is the period preceding his. entry

into the First Department, Second Chief Directorate, MVD, in mid-

Information furnished by NOSENKO concerning his father and

mother and his early. life, together with other information such as a

comparison

2 of photographs of Mostle and photograph of his father

and confirmed travel of his mother to Western Europe in 195ó with

Madame KOSYGINA, conclusively establish that he is Yuriy Ivanovich

•NOSENISO, the son of Ivan Isidorovich NOSENKO, the Minister of Ship-

building in the USSR prior to his death in 1956. This is also satisiactorily

supported by personal-type information furnished by NOSENKO concern-

ing other associates of his father and mother.

Since, as indicated above, there is considered to be no doubt

that Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO is the son of the former Minister of

Shipbuilding, a detailed study of his life prior to 1945 (age 18) is of

little or no value in assessing tie bona fides or non-bona fides oá

NOSENKO. An expose of his yourniul irdiscretions, of wnich te sas

admitted a number, is of no import in a discussion of whether NOSENiO

was or was not dispatched b; lie KGB. Obtaining any collaterai first-

hand iniormation in regard to jOSENKO uciore 1945 would be of

negligible value, but there actually is supporting information from

Nikolay ARTAVONOV, a defector irom the Soviet Navy, concerning

the claimed attendance by NOSENKO at a military-naval preparatory

school in Leningrad.

NOSENKO, during current interviews, has stated that he grad-

uated from the Institute of International Relations in 1950 and had

attended the Institute since 1945. He has explained that he shouid have

graduated in 1949 since it was a four-year course, but failed the final

examination in Marxism and therefore was required to attend the institute

for a longer period of time and again take his final examinations.

Based on information furnished by NOSENKO concerning co-

students and the Institute, there is no reason to doubt inat he acrually

attended and graduated from the Institute of International Relations in

1950. The previous controversy in this matter was complicated by

NOSENKO who, in 1964 after his defection, stated in a biography that

he had graduated from the Institute in 1949.. Actually this statement

by NOSENKO in 1964 resulted in conflicting information since NOSENKO

on 9 June 1962 during his first contact with CIA had stated that he

"completed the Institute of International Relations in 1950." NOSENKO

has given the explanation that he changed the date of his graduation to

1949 because he did not wish to admit that he had failed to graduate in

1949. NOSENKO explained that this change in his date of graduation

caused him to pre-date his actual entry into Navy Intelligence to 1950

instead of 1951 and his actual entry into the KGB from 1953 to 1952.

The above action by NOSENKO is included in what NOSENKO has

characterized as hie "stupid blunders." The latter is a rather apt:

characterization of his now admitted lies and exaggerations but is not

evidence that NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB. It is evidence of

a certain personality trait of NOSENKO who has in the past by his own

admission tended to enhance his importance and astuteness by graphically

portraying his personal participation in KGB activities concerning which

be had knowledge but did not personally participate.

The claimed service of NOSENKO in Navy Intelligence during

March 1951 to early 1953 in the Far East and the Baltic areas has been

seriously questioned in the past. Specific comments on this period of

time are contained in a separate section of this summary, but it is

considered that the recent interviews of NOSENKO satisfactorily sub-

stantiate his claimed service in Navy Intelligence during March 1951

to early 1953.

Attached is a typed copy of a handwritten memorandum completed

by NOSENKO on 31 October 1967. This is a biographical statement con-

cerning his life and KGB career. No effort has been made to correct

grammatical errors or speiling since to do so would be in conflict with

the manner in which current interviews were conducted; namely, to give

NOSENKO an opportunity to recuunt his life and activities to permit a re-

examination of the entire case.

The comprehension and fluency of

NOSENKO in the English language was adequate for interview purposes

in October 1907 and both have materially improved since that time.

Interview's of and memoranda prepared by. NOSENKO since

• 31 October 1967 have not indicated any material discrepancies with the

statements of NOSENKO in the attached memorandum. One change that

has been made by NOSENKO is that he now dates his transfer from the

First Department, Second Chief Directorate (SCD), KGB, to the Seventh

Department, SCD, as occurring in the latter part of May 1955 rather

than June - July 1955 as indicated in the attached statement. NOSENKO

also now dates the period in which an unsatisfactory "characterization"

1955 rather than May - June 1955.

Since the unsatisfactory personnel

report was directly related to tir transier to the Seventh Department,

neither of the above changes are considered to be of a significant nature.

An effort has been made during current interviews to differentiate between

errors due to faulty memory and discrepancies indicative of deception by

NOSENKO.

In 1938 the father began to work in Moscow and soon I with the mother

went to live in iVoscow in the end of this, year.

In Moscow we were living at the St. Serafimovich, 2. Here

I was continuing to study at the school 585 (St. B. Polianka). In 1941

I finished oth class and went with parents to rest to the souza (Sochi)

but soon began the war and we returned in Moscow.

In October 1941 I with my mother went in the evacuation in

Cheliabinsk (Ural), where I finished 7th class in spring 1942. In

..Cheliabinsk I lived in the poselok ChIZ, beirg there I tried to run to

the front with my playiellow BUSKO, but we were caught and returned

home.. In 1942 (summer) I went with the mother in city Gorki and in

July-August we returned in Moscow.

In August I entered in the Moscowite military-navy special

school, which was evacuated in Kuibyshev, where I finished 8th class

in summer 1943 and after that I arrived on a leave in Moscow. This.

• school must be evacuated from Kuibyshev in Achins' (Siberia) and I

did not want to go there. With the help of father I was accepted in the

"Baku's military-navy preparatory school and in August went in Baku,

where I was studying at the second course (9th class). in this school

I'twice tried to be sent as a volunteer to the front but failed. Soon

All cadets of this school were sent to forest (about 200 km.

from Leningrad) to prepare wood for winter, where we have been two

months. In November I wounded by chance the left hand and was put

in the navy hospital. When I was in the hospital I decider-not to return

in the school but to finish l0th class in Leningrad about what I have

written a letter to my father asking his help and agreement with such

my decision. With the help of the father's friende I quited with the school

and entered in the shipbuilding college on the second course in January

1945 and studied there till the end of May. The WWil finished and I

decided to return to Moscow. The director of the shipbuilding college

had given me a document that I studied in this college at the second

course and finished this course (though I was not passing exams). in

Leningrad I was living in the hostel of this college (St. Tolmacher).

In May 1945 I arrived in Moscow and was living with parents

In summer 1945 there was created the institute of the inter

national relations in Moscow and in July I entered in this institute.

In july my father went in Germany with the group of engineers

and he took me (I received a temporary rank of a senior lieutenant,

documents and a uniform):

In 1945-1950 I studied at the institute. In 1946 I acquainted.

with a girl - Shishkov FLAVIA, student of the medicine insulture. I

was in close sclilions with this girl, because of the pregnancy i married

her and she made an abort. My parents were against the marriage and

we did not live together and we soon divorced.

In the end of 1946 I was

acquainted with Telegin AUGUSTINE and was going to marry her, re-

ceived a flat in 1947 (St.. Mira - former Ist Uecyehckad, 162/174). In

• November her father, General TELEGIN, was arrested, but I married

:;-her. The marriage was not successiul, I foundout about her close

relations with the brother, and the child-giri was born with patnological

changes. I was not the father of this child. After that I broke with her

and we were living separately (end of 1948 - beginning 1949).

In spring 1950 before state exams in the institute was working

the commission, which was deal ing with future works. of the students of

.,my 5th course. I expressed a wish to work in any military organization

and soon I was invited to visit personnel department of MGB (Ministry

of State Security). But MGB did not accept me. After that with the

help of the father I began to deal with the personnel department of the

intelligence of the ministry of military navy concerning my. future work.

Passing state exams I failed Marxism-Leninism and with a

group of faila I was passing state exams once more. In October 1950

I finished the institute and received a diploma.

I was accepted in the navy intelligence in the 13 of March 1951

and in March 17 went by a train to Soviet Harbour (inteiligence of 7th

13

Fleet, as an interpreter of the information department). Before going

In to the Far East I began my divorce with the former wife.

At the end of April 1952 I went on a leave in Moscow. Immediately

after returning in Moscow I had a blood cough out. I the middle of May

I went to a tuberculous sanatorium not far from Moscow. In July I

finished my treatment and returned in Moscow. Because of the health

I could not return back to the Far East and the personnel department of

¡ the navy intelligence sent me to Baltic Sea (as a senior interpreter of

the navy intelligence point of the intelligence of 4th Fleet - in Sovietak,

Kaliningrad'a district).

When I studied at the institute I as all the students received a

the rank of junior lieutenant when I was accepted in the navy intelligence.

In September-October 1952 1 received a rank of licutenani.

In Soviete' the work was not interested and for me it was nothing

to do.

Besides this the climite was not good for my health and I decided

to change the job. With this

purpose before new year at the end of 1952

I took a leave and went to Moscow. January 1 I was with my parente

at the evening farty at the cottage of General MGB KOBULOV, whom I

did not know before, but I knew his son-in-law Vahrushev Vasili - a

former student and my friend. I told him about my job and that now I

was thinking about change of the job. KOBULOV was speaking with me

on this theme and propose we work and his help in MGB, but nothing

more definite was said about my work. This month I reported to the

head of the personnel department of the navy intelligence KALOSHIN

about my decision and that I will be working in MGB.

In the end of January I went again in the tuberculous sanatorium,

where I was in 1952. In the days of funeral of STALIN I has come to

"Moscow and visited the ministry where my father was working. There

•I have seen General KOBULOV who has come to the father and he said

that he would settle my question concerning my job. After severa) days

SAVITSKI sent me to the Deputy of tie Chief of the Second Directory

SHUBNAKOV, who told me that thcre was signed an order and I was

accepted in the 1 department of 2 iuci direclory as a case officer.

SHUBNIAKOV invited the deputy of lie chief of l department GORBATENKO

(who was acting as the chiel of 1 Department because the chies of the

department KOSLOV, Anatoli, was appointed to the special department

of extraordinarily affairs (investigation) ). SHUBNIAKOV and

GORBATENKO said to me that I would be working in the l section of

the department. Then I with GORBATENXO went to the 1 department,

was acquainted with the chief of section KOSLOV, Veniamin. KOSLOV

told ine that I will be working against the American correspondents,

showed me room, my desk and acquainted with the officers, who were

working in this room: KUTIREV, RACOVSKI, GROMOV and TORMOSOV.

The last officer must give files on the correspondents and agents. I

was said to come next day and began to work.

When I was resting in the tuberculous sanatorium I acquainted

with KOJEVNIKOV, Ludmila, a student of the Moscowite University,

and in June 1953 we married. Before it I was living with my parents

In 1954 I contracied a disease (gonorrhea) and on the advice

of the friend IVANOV went to medic point at St. Negliunya. Doctors

asked to show a document, I had with me only MVD certificate and an

operative passport and showed them the passport. Doctors had given

me a treatment, after that twice they made tests and asked to come once

more, but I did not come. They wanted to see once more and sent a

letter to the place of work, which was written in the passport. The

plant with MVD found out about it. The deputy of the chief, SHUBNAKOV;

was speaking with me. I had written my explanation, and punished by the

chief of the 2 directory, PEDOTOV - 15 days of arrest. The komsomol's

B. Is the claimed KGB career of NOSENKO plausible? In the

past the theory has been advanced that NOSENKO was never an officer

in the KGB. information of a detailed nature from NOSENKO concern-

ing the KGB, particularly the Second Chief Directorate, has been so

extensive as to invalidate any contention that he was not a KGB officer.

It is considered that NOSENKO was a KGB officer in the claimed:

Departments during the claimed periods of time and served in the claimed

positions in each Department. It is interesting to note that NOSENKO has

not materially varied in his statements in regard to the above since his

original contact in June 1962 (with the exception of his change to 1952 as

date of his entry into the KGB and then later reverting to the date given

in 1962). There have been some variations in dates of a minor nature,

as indicated elsewhere in this summary, but these are of month or day

of transfer irom one Department to another and not considered critical

or evidence of deception. NOSENKO has admitted previously giving false

information in regard to rank and medals, but his basic story concerning

SECRET

0001043

Chic. 1

## Page 45

14-00000

his KGB career today is not significantly different from the fragmentary!

version he gave in June 1962.

Basically the following is now considered to have been the KGB

career of NOSENKO:

Mid-March 1953 - late May 1955, First Section,

First Department, SCD

. Late May 1955 - December 1959(1958 - December

1959 - Deputy Chief of Section) Seventh

(NOTE: The term. Deputy Chief is being used throughout this

summary, but the better terminology probably is "Deputy to Chief."

The position of "Deputy Chief" in United States Government parlance,

including CIA, is not synonymous with the term "Deputy Chief" as used

in Soviet organizations and more specifically in the KGB. As an example,

a Chief of Department in the KGB or the Chief of a Residentura abroad

may have 2, 3 or even 4 deputies, one of whom is given the titie oi

First Deputy. This particular deputy acts in the absence of the Chief

of Department and in general has supervisory functions over all tne

Department sections.

The exception to the latter is when the Chief of

Department retains direct supervision over what he may consider the

most imporiant section. Other deputies have supervisory functions only

over designated sections or organizational components. )

During current interviews and in prepared memoranda, NOSENKO

has furnished detailed information which it is considered substantiates

his claimed positions in the KGB.. Detailed remarks on these topics are

contained in separate sections of this summary.

It is realized that GOLITSYN, although confirming that NOSENKO

was a KGB officer in both the First Department and Seventh Department,

SCD, has stated that NOSENKO remained in the First Department until

circa 1958 and that NOSENKO was not Deputy Chief of the First Section,

First Department, in 1960. It is impossible to correlate this information

with the above indicated opinion that NOSENKO left the First Department

in late May 1955 and was Deputy Chief of the First Section, First Depart-

ment, in 1960, nor is an adequate explanation of these variances available

sure?

at this time. On the other hand, it is not Icasonable that NOSENKO

would lay claim to ine titie of Deputy Chief of the First Section, First

Department, if this were not true when he clearly knew of the visits of

GOLITSYN to the First Section in 1960 - 1961 and of his conferences

with officers ciosely associated with NOSENKO al that time.

NOSENKO has also mentioned a number of officers of the SCD

or former oificers of the SCD who transferred to the FCD with wnom

he was personally acquainted and who were also known to GOLITSYN.

A number of these officers were officers from whom GOLITSYN has

stated he obtained certain information or through whom he became aware

of certain activities inciuding Viadislav M. KOVSHUK, Gennadiy I.

GRYAZNOV, Vladimir Ivanovich PETROV, Yuriy I. GUK, Vladimir

A. CHURANOV, Yevgeniy GROMAKOVSKIY and Vadim V. KOSOLAPOV.

The statement of NOSENKO that although he had heard of

GOLITSYN he had never personally met GOLITSYN, stands in conflict.

with the statements of GOLITSYN that he, GOLITSYN, had met and

talked with NOSENKO in the SCD in the late 1950's. The description

of GOLITSY, of this meeting is that of a casual encounter in the halls

rather than a specific office visit. In light of this, the absence of any

reason why NOSENKO from his point of view should remember such

an encounter and the absence of any reason for NOSENKO to lie on this

divine

issue, it is eminently reasonable to conciude that the encounter took

place but that NOSENKO simply has no recollection of it. There is

no reason to attach sign. icance to this lapse of memory.

The previous opinion that NOSENKO did not hoid the claimed

pasition of Deputy Chiei, First Section, First Department, during 1960 -

1961 has had the most mer i in the controversy over his statements

relative to his KGB carcer. This particular aspect will be covered in.

detail in another section, but of note at this time is the controversy

over what duties the position of Deputy Chief of Section in the SCD, KGB;

entails or does not entail. It is a fruitless exercise to attempt to judge

whether NOSENKO was Deputy Chief oi the First Section in 1960 - 1961

on the basis of whether his knowledge of the total activities of the First

Section was

commensurate with the knowledge of a Deputy Branch Chief

in CIA in regard to the activities of the entire Branch.

Whether NOSENKO was a Deputy Chief of Seciion in ine SCD,

• KGB, must be judged on the basis of what were the duties of a Deputy

Chief of Section in the SCD and in particular what were his duties in

the particular assignment. The organizational structure of the KGB

may or may not have some similarities to the organizational structure

of CIA, but any similarities are surely not such as to permit a judgment

as to whether NOSINKO held à certain claimed position on the basis

of a comparison of his activities and

responsibilities with that inherent

in a somewhat similar position in ClA.

One of the most important difierences between United Siates

agencies or organizations, inciuding CIA, and the bureaucratic structure

of, agencies or organizations in the USSR, including the KGB, is the

salary structure. Pay oi a KGB officer is based on military rani and

on actual position held with an additional percentage increase for longevity

and language qualification. Actual position held is important from a

monetary viewpoint in addition to the prestige. As an example, the

difference in montaly salary between a Captain and a major is twenty

rubles and the difference in salary between a Senior Case Officer and

a Deputy Chief of Section is also twenty rubles.

An increase in miitary

rank alone has limited pay advantages, as for example a Lieutenant

Colonel who is orly a Senior Case Officer receives less pay thas a major

who holds the position of Chief of Section.

During current interviews, an effort has been made to obtain

from NOSENKO statements concerning his responsibilities in the various

claimed positions. The judgment on whether he held or did not hold

the various claimed positions, in view of the absence of any factual

supporting of refuting information, has necessarily been based to a

considerabie degree on the logic of the statements made by NOSENKO.

Admittedly this is not the most satisfactory way of resoiving the

• questions, out it is the only method possibie at this time.

C. Has NOSENKO given an acceptable explanation of his

motivation in contacting CL in 1962 and for his defection in 1964? Of

the eight listed categories which are being given specific consideration

in the matter of the bona fides of NOSENKO, this category is probably

the most difficult in which to present a logical position with actual

support. There are too many intangible aspects involved and although

motivation is an important factor, full resolution of the motivation

problem is not a paramoun: factor in deciding whether NOSENKO is or

is not a dispatched agent. NOSENKO could have contacted this Agency in

1962 and defected in 1964 withöut KGB knowledgé and yet even at this late

date have failed to disclose some important events of a personal nature

which actually were important ingredients in his ultimate decision.

Defectors are humans and have at least the normal reluctance to admit

unfavorable information weich-they consider of a personal nature.

On 31 October 1967 NOSENKO, following a reguest, furnished a.

handwritten memorandum on the topic of his motivation, a typed copy of

which is attached. The memorandum, although not grammatically correct,

is quite understandable and is worthy of review. The tenor of the memo-

randum is one of increasing disillusionment with the Soviet regime.

NOSENKO and others of his generation have lived in a Soviet society

throughout their entire lives. The envirorment is an important factor

of influence in the lie of an individual and true disillusionment is at

best usually a gradual process in wbich many factors, some recognized

and some not recognized by the individual, have played a role in varying

degrees.

NOSENO, until 1955 and possibiy until the deat of his father

in August 1956, could be compared to the profligate son of wealthy

parents in the United States who finally graduates from college and obtains

employment.perhaps in the firm of his father without actually earning any of

the luxuries he has enjoyed. The father of NOSENKO was not only wealthy

by Soviet standards but also held a higo government position. The

influence of his fatber and the name. of ais father undoubtedly was an

important is not the mosi important factor in NOSENKO even being

permitted to enter the Naval RU and the KG3 even though NOSENKO is

particularly reluctant to admit, perhaps even to himself, that this was

the primary reason.

The above should not be construed as any reflection on the

actual intelligence of NOSENKO, but rather as an explanation of how

NOSENKO could have even entered the Naval RU and KGB. His

periormance in both prior to 1956 by his own admission was such that

be probably would have been summazily terminated if he had not been

the son of the capable, respected Minister of Shipbuilding.

lí a certain amount of speculation is permitted, the

disillusionment of NOSENKO, who lost many personal advantages

following the death of his father including a personal automobile, may

have actually started soon after the death of his father. That NOSENKO

is undisciplined is supported by his admissions relative to his life in

¡the USSR and bis behavior both in 1962 in Geneva and for a period of time

after his defection in 1964. NOSENKO was addicted to women, liquor, and

the material things which can be purchased with money or obtained through

influence.

A question has been previously raised regarding his motivation

in contacting CIA in 1962, particularly his statement that he needed money

and would sell "two

pieces of information." NOSENKO has stated that he

wanted to make a contaci with the Americans, that he vas not emotionally

ready to defect, but that de subconsciously believed that if he made a

contact he would be making an ultimate commitment from which he could

„no longer retreat.

NOSENKO nas stated that he gave considerabie thoug'at to the

best way to contact the Americans so that he wouid be believed and not

rejected and came to the conclusion that he would offer to sell some.

information. NOSENKO staied that he thought if he approached the

Americans stating he was a "KGB counter intelligence officer who wanted

to give information, " he would not have been believed and would have

been peremptorily rejected. NOSENKO stated he had difficulty deciding

how much money to ask for and how to make the approach, but finally

ecided to do it arough pal Ailusiom the CB considered a with

American Intelligence.

The above statements by NOSENKO are not in conflict with the

record.. NOSENXO did offer to sell "two pieces of information, " almost

immeciately gave more information, made no significant demande for

money, and in fact his price for "two pieces of information" was

ridiculously low by American standards. NOSENKO has during current

interviews stated, as be first stated in 1962, that he had spent excessive

amounts of money in one or two riotous evenings. However, NOSENKO

has during current interviews stated that he could have covered his

expenditures by other means without receiving any money from the

Americans.

Operational Memo # N-4

SUBJECI: NOSENKO, Yuri Ivanovich

The following is a typed copy of a handwritten memorandum

furnished by Subject on l November 1967, following a request on

31 October 1967:

What were the motif and the reasons which have led me to

the decision to breake with the Soviet Russia? The only definite is an

understanding of the situation in the Soviet Russia, the knowledge of

the methods of the communiet regime, the knowledge.of.the real foreign

and interior policies of the Soviet government and the faith in the right

ness of the free world.

It was not a decision which was accepted or could be accepted

in a month or à year. This decision was slowly growing in me. I

think that the beginning was in the studentship.

Living with my parents and being in the circles of the parent's.

and my acquaintances I knew more then there was written in newspapers

and periodice and that was propagandized by radio and TV. Working in

the Far East and later being in trips in different regions and cities of

Russia I found out much better the life and conditions of the life of the

people of the Soviet Russia.

When I worked Il years in MVD-KGB i understood and found,

out very many things, details and the real deal of the existing regime,

about methods of the work of MGB-MVD-KGB and about their doings,

about hundreds of thousande of the people of Russia who were (and

still are) considered "politically" dangerous and around whom was

(and still is) going an active work of all organs KGB.

At the same time when I was

several times abroad I have

seen personally the so-called "decay" at the West. I have seen in

reality how is living people.

Several times when I was abroad I was thinking about staying

at the West and not returning in Russia, but only one thing was keeping

me -- my family.

In 1962 in Switzerland I made the acquaintance with the

• Americans. From my part "the sell of the information" was a real

show. I was thinking that they would not beiieve me otherwise. In

that period of the time there was going a big struggle in me to stay.

abroad or to return home till the last days of living in Geneva and even

when I was returning home in Vienna.

In 1962-1963 I decided definitely that i did not want and could

not live more in the Soviet Russia.. In this period of time I have done

all my best to go as soon as possible abroad.

D.. Is the information furnished by NOSENKO to CIA concerning

KGB operations, personalities, and organization reasonably commen-

surate with his claimed KGB career? The conclusion is that the infor -

mation furnished by NOSENKO concerning KGB operations, personalities,

and organization is more than reasonably commensurate with nis claimed

career in the KGB from mid-March 1953 to his defection in early February

1964.

" In: reaching the above conclusion, consideration has been given

to his claimed departmental assignments and claimed positions in each

department. Certain allowance has been made for faulty memory with

consideration being given to whether there is any indication of deception

or whether the failure to recall a particular item of interest can logically

be attributed to the vagaries of the human mind. There is, of course, no

accurate standard of measurement which would permit a positive deter-

mination as to whether inability to recall certain details or events is

actually due to the fact that the human mind cannot recall all past events

or could be attributed to willful deception.

An effort has been made to determine if there are any particular

patterns or areas where jOSENKO has indicated he did not recali

specific maiters or certain details, and no pattern or specific areas

have been noted.

NOSENKO, in fact, has an unusually good memory

as evidenced by the extensive information iurnished by NOSENKO purely

from recollection. In addition, there has been no material reluctance

on the part of NOSENKO io discuss his entire life, KGB officers he has

known, KGB organization and procedures, or other topice of interest.

NOSENKO has furnished considerable detail concerning KGB

officers whom he has known at various periods in his entire KGB career.

He has been very consistent in information furnished and has frequently

added certain details which he recalled at a later date.

Certain remarks will be made in another section in regard to

the volume and

scope of incormation furnished by NOSENKO. This in-

formation is not selective, but is an excellent indicator that NOSENKO

was assigned to the First Department and Seventh Department, SCD,

during the claimed periods of time and held the claimed positions. Con-

sideration has been given to his various claimed KGB assignments in

evaluating the information furnished in an effort to assess whether his

indicated knowledge was commensurate with his claimed position during

a particular period of time or suggested the possibility that he did not

occupy the position which he claimed to have heid.

It is considered that information furnished by NOSENKO supports

his claimed positions in the SCD. it has not been possible to substantially

confirm torough collateral sources that NOSENKO served in his claimed

positions.

Neither has it been possible to obtain from other sources an

applicable.description of the duties or responsibilities of an individual

holding any of the positions NOSENKO claimed to bave held after 1958. It

is felt thero can be no question that NOSENKO served in the capacities of

junior case officer, case officer, and senior case officer during 1953 - 1957.

As rogards the duties and responsibilities of a Deputy Chief of Section,

Chief of Section, and Deputy Chief of Department, and whether NOSENKO

held these various claimed positions, a considerable amount of personal

judgment has been necessary. This personal judgment has been made in

as judicial a manner as possible, with full knowledge that any opinion in

regard to the above is largely dependent upon information from NOSENKO.

NOSENKO has compiled detailed diagrams of the actual officês

he claims to have occupied and surrounding offices during the four pri-

mary periods of time: 1953 - 1955, 1955 - 1959, 1960 - 1961, and 1962 -

1963. He has prepared specific memoranda concerning his co-officers

3

and other personnel, ard changes of personnel, as well as diagrams

of the oifices

of the Chiaf and Deputy Chiefs of the SCD during 1956 -

1964. This material is internally consistent. Furthermore NOSENXO:

could not possibly have known that this detailed information could not

immediately be checked for accuracy, at least in part, with a source

or another officer who has defected since mid-1964. If these diagrams

and memoranda were not relatively correct, NOSENKO, who is quite

astute in matters of counterintelligence, would hardly have voluntarily

prepared the material in such detail. This sype of information is

peculiarly adaptable for analysis by a knowledgeable source or by another

defoctor and could, if not relatively correct, permit à rather positive con-

clusion that NOSENKO was lying or fabricating information.

NOSENKO has furnished quite specific information on KGB

operations during the 1953 - 1955, 1955 - 1959, 1960 - 1961,. and 1962 -

1963 periods of time. As might be expected, his specific knowledge is

less.for the 1953 - 1955 period; but his own personal situation and, attitude

until 1955 - 1956, which are mentioned elsewhere, should be given

consideration. In any event, he has furnished adequate information so

that his claimed assignment during 1953 - 1955 is considered sufficiently

substantiated even though his actual job periormance undoubtedly

deserved a low rating.

The knowledge of NOSENKO concerning

cases, KGE operations,

and other officers can consistently be related to his claimed department

and position assignment during the 1953 to January 1964 period. The

scope of his knowledge of his own department when considered in toto

is broader after 1957 than before, which is compatible with his claim of

increased responsibilities.

His knowledge of the work of other departments

of the SCD from the late 1950's on is also more extensive, which is also a

further indication that NOSENKO actually held the claimed positions

during this pericd of time.

SECRE:

F. Is there evidence of KGB decestion or "give away" in

incormation furnished by YOSENKO which wouid warrant a conclusion

that NOSENKO was dispatched by the KCB? The conclusion in this

summary is that NOSENKO was not dispatched by the KGi. in

reaching this conclusion, a full examination of the above que iion has

been both a necessary and integral part.

It is inherent that the volume of information furnished by

NOSENKO is only one of the factors which should be given consideration

in arriving at a conclusior. that NOSENKO was or was not dispatched by

the KGB. I NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB, the KGB would have

surely been willing to sacrifice certain iniormation of value to the KGB

in order to support the bona fides of NOSENKO. However, if NOSENKO

was dispatched, it must have been to accomplish or further a KGB

purpose or mission, the nature of which has been and continues to be

unknown.

An examination of the circumstances under which NOSENKO first

contacted CIA in Geneva in 1962 and his benavior during thèse contacts is

particularly pertinent since during this period of time NOSENKO would

have surely been under direct KGB control if there are any implications

of KGB dispatch in the NOSENKO case.

NOSENIO has staied that his original approach to "sell two

pieces of information" was his own idea as to what was most likely to

'be successful. NOSENKO has stated that he wanted to make a contact

with the Americans, was not psychologically adapted to defect at the

time, and felt that if he merely stated that le was a "KGB counter-

intelligence officer who wanted to give information, " he very possibly

would be rejected. It should be noted that NOSENKO even during his

first contact did not limit his remarks to the "two pieces of information"

and began to talk quiie freely on other matters.

IL NOSENKO was dispatched, it is felt that he, during his 1962

contacts, would have been very carefully brieied and that his remarks

or statements would have not been of a nature which could cause any

suspicion in regard to the bona fides of NOSENKO. Instead, a current

review of his statements and remarks during his five contacts in 1902

indicate that his many errors, exaggerations, and acial lies were quite

likely typical of a braggadocio element in the personality of NOSENKO

and may also have been evidence supporting the statement by NOSENKO

that he usually had a few drinks of liquor before each contact in

Geneva.

NOSENKO, during his five contacis in Geneva, made many

statements which in retrospect were impossibie,

and the investigation

of which could only have raised certain questions con arning NOSENKO.

The following is a list of the more obvious areas in wnich NOSENiO

made gross exaggerations or made incorrect or impossible statements.

(a) NOSENKO claimed he personally was with

LANGELLE was available for interview.)

STEVENS iao, according to NOSENKO, har! been recruited

by the KGB. (NOSENKO actually had never personaty met

(STEVENS and oniy bad seen rEVENionco at a distance.)

(e) NOSENXO dated the recruitment of "ANDREY"

in Moscow as 1949-1950. At ihe same time he furnished

information that "ANDREY" (who is considered identical to

Dayle Wallis SMIT*i) was in Moscow during a part of the time

that Roy RHODES, also a recruited agent, was assigred to

MOscow, 1951-1953. "ANDREY" (SMITH) was actuaily in

Moscow 1952-1954.

(1) NOSENKO said be, GRIBANOV, and anoicer officer

met Edward Ellis SMITH. (NOSENKO has since staied he did

not meet SMITH and loat his only role was obtaining a ioreign

typewriter and paper for a KGB agent involved in the SMiTH

operation. )

(g) NOSENIO in a number of instances spoke in the

first person, saying "We did this," or "We did that, " in

reference to a particular KGB activity in which he now aùmits

he was not involved but had some knowledge. (I

NOSENIO was under XGB control in 1962, both he

and the GB should have known that these indicated

exaggerations would eventually lead to a question

concerning the bona fides of NOSENKO. )

In 1962-1963 a number of similarities were noted between

information furnished by NOSENKO and information which had been

furnished by GOLITSYN prior to June 1962. These similarities were

quite striking and gave riseto certain suspicions of NOSENKO because

he provided information which the KGB would presumably have considered

already compromised as a result of the defection of GOLITSYN. Certain

of the similarities ai the time could only be explained in lerms of

NOSENKO being a dispatched agent. The following are some examples of

the similarities noted.

(a) Both furnished information in regard to

[Johan PREISFREUND] 06

(b) Both furnished information in regard to a

[military code clerk case (James STORSBERG) 08, 06

(c) Both furnished information in regard to a

trip of Vladislav KOVSHUK, under an assumed name,

to the United States. (GOLITSYN was sure it was

connected with a reactivation of an agent formerly in

assumed name which KOVSHUK used.)

(a) Both furnished information in regard to

microphones in the United States Embassy in Moscow.

(e) Both furnished information in regard to

Edmund STEVENS and Ja Honey SHAPIRO.

The above list is not complete nor does it indicate the actual

differénces in the amount of information furnished on any partic alar

topic by GOLITSYN and NOSENKO. To cite the above in detail in tais

summary is believed unnecessary since the only point of real interest

is whether the fact that NOSENKO was aware of certain events, cases,

or situations of which GOLITSYN was also aware raises a legitimate

question concerning the bona fides oí NOSENKO.

The above area of concerr has been thoroughly examined and

it is considered that the fact that NOSENKO furnished some information

on certain cases or situations previously mentioned in lesser or

greater detail by GOLITSYN cannot logically be construed as evidence

that NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB. NOSENKO has during

current interviews

satisiaciorily sourced his intormation in almo st

every instance. In a few insiances he has said he dia not recall

how he learned of a particular pieci of information but these

apparent lapses of memory were not large in number and are

considered to be in no way suspicious.

The general area in which there was a similarity between

information furnished by GOLITSYN in late 1961 - early.1962 and

information furnished by NOSENKO in June 1962 and which would have

been the most significant insofar as the security of the United States

Government was or is co-cerned related to certair activities centering

around or in the First Department, SCD.

It is the conclusion of this summary that NOSENKO was an

officer of the First Section, First Department, SCD, during 1953-1955

and was Deputy Chief of the same section in 1960 - 1961. Tberefore,

the fact that NOSENKO furnished information concerning certain cases

or situations in the First Department and the fact that GOLITSYN

furnished information concerning the same case or situation is not

unusual or necessarily suspicious. NOSENKO has stated that GOLITSYN

been noted and commenica on in another section of this summary.

GOLITSY" has furnished certain iniormation wrich he re-

ceived from officers of the First Section, First Department, SCD.

In each instance where this information, which was fragmentary, couid

not be immediately correiated with information from NOSENKO, it was

previously considered to be evidential of deception or lying on the part

of NOSENKO. This position, however, failed to allow for the possibility

that the discrepancies between the two sources were, at least in certain

instances, more apparent than real.

In certain instances it has now beer. possible to correlate irag-

mentary information from GOLITSYN with information from NOSENKO,

making it evident that in these instances the differences could rot be

construed as in any way refiecting against NOSENKO. The four examples

cited below represent two probable correlations, (a) and (b); one possible

correlation, (c); and one instance where no correlation is possible at this

time, (d):

(a) GOLITSYN furnisned information which he

received in April-May 1960 from Gennadiy GRYAZNOV

that an attempt had been made by the KGB to recruit an

that the woman had left Moscow by the time he learned of

the information but that the Soviets hoped she would return

to Moscow so that further work could be undertaken to

efiect her recruitment. He did not recall the name of the

secretary, but did recall ¿hat it was a long and "German 08

NOSENKO has furnished information in regard to a

the spring of 1960 that GRYAZAuV had deveioped an operation

against an American Embassy miliary code cleri. in wnich the

iGi was "99 per cent sure" that the target wouid be recruited.

This is believed to undrubiedly be a reference to the case oi

ment approach in 1961.

There is considered to be a good possibility that

GOLITSYN actually learned of the above information from

GRYAZNOV. in early January 1961 when he was again in Moscow

rather than during the spring of 1960 when GOLITSYN was

preparing ior his assignment to Helsinki, Finland. This

theory is supported by information on page 163 of the previous

summary that GOLITSYN has stated he learned in January

1961 from Vladisiav M. KOVSHUK (Chief of the First Section)

that Johan PREISFREUND had recently been used in the

successíul recruitment of an American employee of the

the above conversation. It is very possibic that KOVSHUK

exaggeraied a liitle in his conversation with GOLITSYN in the

matter of why GOLTSYN could not use PREiSFREUNSas an

NOSENKO has furnished extensive inforination in regard

to the James STORERO case and with due consideration to

the accuracy and recoilection of GOLITSYN, there does not

appear to be an adequate basis for questioning the bona fides of

NOSENKO on the basis of the differences between the report-

ing by GOLITSYN of information he received from GRYAZNOV

concerning what is considered to have been the James 06

STORSBERG case and detailed information furnished by

NOSENKO concerning the James STORSBERG case. The

GRYAZNOV in April or May 1960 that an American

employee of the Embassy in Moscow was either recruited

or prepared for recruitment on the basis of a homosexual

compromise beginning in 1959 and concluding in 1960.

The previous summary also states that according to

GOLITSYN, the KGB had photographed the American in

various homosexual acts, but SHELEPIN, who had just

become Chairman of the KGB, was at the time stressing

iceoiogicai rather than biacimail recruitments. SHiELEPiN

although the photographs were of a good quality, the KGB

was unable to use the photographs in 1959 because of a

general ban by the Central Committee on the recruitment

visit of President EISENHOWER to the Sovict Union.

Of NOSENKO. GOLITSYN stated that KOSOLAPOV came to Helsinici

to accompany an American Embassy code cierk on the train to

Nioscow and that KOSOLAPOV planned to strike up an acquaintance

with the code clerk which could be continued in Moscow.

The American Embassy code clerk referred to above was

undoubtedly John GARLAND and the train manifest lists John GARLAND]

NOSENKO, as Deputy Chief of the First Section specifically

charged with work against code clerks, showd have been aware of the

November 1960 trip of KOSOLA?OW to and from Helsinki. His laci of

knowledge may or may not be explainable in terms of his other activities

such as his trip to Cuba in November-December 1960 but it cannot be

interpreted as evidence NOSENKO was dispaiched by the KGB since, if

he had been, the KGB should have briefed NOSENKO on the trip of

A theury which has previously been given consideration and

Warranted full consideration was that if NOSENKO was dispatched,

his mission was to confuse leads furnishea to American intelligence

and/or to denigrate the value of information fuznished by GOLITSYN.

In connection with this theory, it should be noted that NOSENKO during

current interviews has not made any remarks which could in any way

be construed as derogatory to GOLITSYN. In addition, NOSENKO does

not claim to have any detailed knowledge of the FCD and frequently,

when some topic peculiar to the FCD has been broached with NOSENKO,

his immediate reply has been to the effect that "I didn't work in the FCD, "

or "You's

should ask GOLITSYN about that. "

In connection with any consideration of whether the contact of

NOSENKO wità CIA in Geneva in June 1962 could have been initiated by

the KGB as a result of the defection of GOLITSYN, the timing, oi certain

events should be noted.. GOLITSYN defected on 15 December 1961.

NOSENKO departed from Moscow in March 1962 for Geneva, Switzerland,

where he remained until 15 June 1962.

It is felt that it would have been practically impossible if not

impossible for KGB officials to complete an assessment of the actual or

potential damage which could result from the defection of GOLITSYN,

18;

seleci NOSENKO as the individual wno would be dispatched io counter-

act the possible damage, and appropriately brief "OSENKO prior to

his departure for Geneva in March 1962. Thereíore, it NOSENKO

was dispatched by the KG3, it would appear that pians for this would

have predated the defection of GOLITSYN and that any GOLITSYN

aspect could only be a related aspect and not the basis for the original

plan to dispatch NOSENKO. In addition, if NOSENKO was dispatched,

it would hardly seem necessary for the KGB to send NOSENIO to

Geneva two and one-half months before his first contact with CIA.

The theory has also been considered that NOSENKO could have

been dispatched to confuse and divert American intelligence and thus

'to protect an important KGB penetration or penetrations of the United

States Covernment, particularly CIA. This is a theory which should

and has been given full consideration, out it is not possible to factually

substantiate of refute this theory in the absence of specific information

that high-level KGB penetrations do or do not exist.

Actually, as regards NOSENKO, the primary area which should

be given consideration in the above matter is if all the information from

NOSENKO is accepted, what eftect would or could it bave on the efforts

of American counter-interigence to determine the identity of and

take appropriate action against KGB peretrations of the United

States Government. The only answer to this question seems to be

that there would be little consolation or assurance to American intelli-

gence even if every statement by NOSENKO was accepted at face value.

The only specific area in which NOSENKO could be even con-

sidered to claim full knowledge is the United States Embassy in Moscow.

In this area his statements could be construed as assurance that there

were no recruitments of American personnel in the United States Embassy

expressed opinion of YOSENKO is considered elsewhere in this summary

and analysts may differ as to whether a recruitment could have occurred

of which NOSENKO did not have knowledge, assuming that his statements

are made in good faith. It should be noted, however, that at this time

there is no specific information which is in direct conflict with the

expressed opinion of NOSENKO.

NOSENKO, as previously mentioned, has never claimed any

particular knowledge of ECD activities. In addition, he does not claim

to be aware of all recruitments of Americans by the SCD.

As an.

example, he has made it clear that his knowledge of SCD activities

against members oi deiegations, foreign businessmen, foreign students,

ard individuals in the ÜSSR on the invitation of a Soviet organization or

a component of the Soviet Government is extremely limised and at best

mainly of a collateral nature.

NOSENKO does not even claim any detailed krowledge of

activities of the Second Section (Active Line) of the First Department, SCD,

nor does he claim to know all of the cases of which the Chief of the Seventh

Department was aware. The latter is specifically supported by certain

notes brought out by NOSENKO which are short references to a number

o! Seventh Department cases which are identified only by the KGB code

name. These notes, according to NOSENKO, were made when he had an

opportunity to review a notebook held by the Chief of the Seventh Department

and constitute the only inowledge NOSENKO had of these particuiar cases.

H. Is there any evidence that the contucts of NOSENKO in 1902

or in 1964 with CIA were known to the XGB prior to his defection or

that NOSENKO was ever briefed by the KGB relative to his behavior

or KGB objectives during these contacis or aiter his defection? The

conclusion is that there is no evidence that the contacts of NOSENKO

in 1962 or in 1964 with CIA were known to the KGB prior to his

defection and that NOSENKO was never briefed in any manner by the KGB.

The basis for the above conclusion is substantially contained in

:: previous sections. It is being treated bere as a separate area of interest

since it is a sufficiently important area as to warrant individual consideration.

It is recognized that since positive factual confirmation such as

the KGB file on NOSENKO is not available, any conclusion concerning

whether NOSENKO was or was not dispatched by the KGB can only be

based on the full review of available incormation from NOSENKO,

collateral sources, independent investigation and the opinion of the

individual analyst concerning the significance or non-significance of

each item of available information.

The conclusion that the contacis of NOSENKO with CIA in 1962

and 1964 prior to his defection were not known to the KGB is

Schie.

necessarily based in pari on a judgment as to whether any of his

activities or information logically warrant a substantial suspicion

that they were or could be in any part the result of XGB direction

or control. One of the particular areas considered was his apparent

behavior during his contacts with CIA in June 1962 and the conclusion

was that it was incomprehensible that he could have been under KGB

control at that time.

Consideration has been given to the possibility that his 1962

. contacts with CIA were not known to the KGB, but became known to

the KGB later and NOSZKO was doubled by the KGB.

It was con-

cluded that there was no basis for or information which would warrant

serious consideration of the above possibility aside from the separate

conclusion that the IGB would be very unlikely to reward a traitor in

KGB eyes by sending him again to Geneva where he would be quite free

to defect.

Worthy of comment in this section is the fact that NOSENKO,

during his 1962 contacts, expressed considerable concern over his

personal security, requesting that knowledge concerning his identity be

kept to an absolute minimum, that no communications be sent to the

PREVIOUS CONCLUSIONS RE NOSENKO

AS CONTAINED ON PAGES 357 - 360 OF

"THE EXAMINATION OF THE BOYA FIDES OF A KGB DEFECTOR"

The following is a quote of the previous conclusions in the case of Yuriy

Ivanovich NOSENKO. (The specific conclusions have been given the designation

Of A - G for purposes of easier correlation with other sectiona oi this summary.)

"SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS

CONCERNING NOSENKO'S BONA FIDES"

"NOSENKO claims that he served for a decade in the KGB in

successively: senior positions of aunoriy from which he derived

extensive knowledge of the scope, character, and results of KGB

operations against Americans in the Soviet Union in the period

1953-1963. To substantiate his claim, he provides an impressive.

array of information about KGB personnel, organization and opera-

..

tions which, to the extent that it has been confirmed, is presumptive

evidence of his bona fides. Various Soviet officials, including

intelligence officers, have generally corroborated NOSENKO's

claims. According to some of these sources, NOSENKO was a

senior KGB officer who occupied a series of sensive positions, who

.!.

0001114

SEPRET

## Page 118

14-00000

enjoyed considerable autory and trust despite personal short-

comings, and whose acfection, 'ine greatest loss ever suffered

by Soviet Intelligence', paralyzed the work of em KGB Enta

• Legal Residency, and justified the formulation of plans to assas-.

sinate bim."

"The examination has compared each element of NOSENKO's

biograpay relevant io his claimed KGB service with known

facto and reasonable surmise. The examination reflects the

test to which his accounts were pul; whether his accounta are

internally coherent and consistent with known fact, and whether

he actually gained the information lie has from occupying the

KGB. positions he claims to have. held. In short, is he what he.

says he is, according to his own accounts?"

"This examination had led to the ioilowing findings, arrived

at independently:

A. NOSENKO did not serve in the Naval RU

in any of the capacities of at the places and times he

claimed.

B. NOSENKO did not enter the KGB in the

manner of at the time he claimed.

C. NOSENKO did not serve in the American.

he claimed.

liau....

D. During ine period 1955-1960, he was neither

a senior case oificer in, nor Deputy Chiei of, the Seventh

Department American-Brition Commonwealin Section.

E. NOSENKO was neither Deputy Chief of the

American Embassy Section nor a senior oificer or

supervisor in the Section during the period 1961-1962. (sic)

F. NOSENXO's claims, tnat in 1962 he was Chief

of the American-British Commonwealth Section and was

thereafter a Depudy Chief of the Seventh Department, are

not credible.

'" G. "NOSENKO has no valia claim to certainty

.. that the KGB recruited no American Embassy personnel

between 1953 and his defection in 1964.

These findings differ somewhat with respect io degree of probability

'or certitude, but they reflect the preponderance of available evidence

in each instance. "

"The above judgments, if correct, rebut presumptive evidence

Of NOSENKO bone fides. The contradictions in NOSENKO's accounts

of his life and KGB service are so extensive as to make sis claims

as a whole unacceptabie. While truth and fact in this case freguently

0001116

SECRET

---

## Page 120

4-00000

canrot be established with certainty, it is evident that truth and

fact are not what NOSENKO reiates. By almosi any test, virtuaily

any of NOSENKO's above claims are impugned by iact or probability,

or contradicted or retracted in his own statements. NOSENKO is

not what he claims to be, and thus he is not a bona fide deíector."

"Given the conclusion that NOSENKO is not a bona fide

defector, it is necessary to attempi to determine his true motives

for contacting American intelligence and for providing the iniormation

he has given. Here, it must be recognized that ine evidence, largely

consisting of NOSENKO's own assertions, does not permit unequivocal

conclusions. Neverheiess, the question cannot be ignored. The

character of the information NOSENKO has conveyed, the fact that

some of his false claims have been corroborated by Soviet officials,

and the necessity to ma'se decisions about NOSÉNKO's future all

require that at least a provisional judgment be made. "

"Of the reasonable explanations advanced ior NOSENKO's

misrepresentations, the chief ones are that he is a swindler posing

as a former KGB officer for reasons of personal advantage; that he

suffers from a deranged personality or unbalanced mind; that he has

greatly exaggerated his actual rani, status and access in the KGB, for

simply personal reasons; or, finally, that he is a dispatched KGB

agent.

divi

"The first two possibilities are easily dismissed.

That

NOSENKO is not sinply a swindler woo falsely claims for personal

advaniage to have been a KG3 officer is evident, we believe, irom

the confirmed details of KGB organization, personnel and operations

which he has provided and which couid only derive from within the

KGB itself."

"Second, as noted in the text, extensive psychiatric and

psychological examination by qualified specialists rule out the

possibility that NOSENKO's actions and testimony are the product

of a deranged personality or unbalanced mind."

"It is somewnat more plausible that NOSENKO is a KGB

officer who served in at least some of the components for some

or all of the time periods that he claims, but who greatly exag-

gerated his positions, rark and access to intormation, and

invented some matters outright, to achieve greater status with

American Intelligence. This explanation, however, fails to

accommodate the fact thai several KGB officers have asserted

that NOSENKO did in fact nold senior positions in the KGB. Also,

NOSENKO's assertions with respect to his rank, GRIBANOV's

patronage, the recall telegram, and the like, cannot be just a

product of his own invention, since these were the subject of

comment.by.other.sources."

"Because none of ine above explanations is consistent with

the data developed in interrogations and investigations, we are

left with the hypothesis that NOSENKO was dispaiched by the

KGB. While this explanation does not reconcile all the anomalies,

none of them renders it untenable. "

• •

"In the absence of further revelations by NOSENKO, or

other persuasive evidence to the contrary, CIA finds that the

evidence establishes a presumption that NOSENKO was dispatched

by the KGB, and believes that prudence reguires that he be

regarded as still responsive to KGB control, and that his infor -

mation should be assessed accordingly. "

A. NOSENKO did not serve in the Naval RU in any of the capacities

or at the places and times he claimed. (Previola conclusion)

The above is conclusion "A" in the previous summary in regard

to NOSENKO. The current conclusion is that the claimed servicé of

NOSENKO in Navy Inteliigence (Naval RU) during March 1951 to early

1953 in the Far East and the Baltic areas is adequately substantiated

and should be accepted.

The interrogations of NOSENXO prior to 1967 were complicated

by. NOSENKO changing the date of his graduation irom the Institute oi

International Relations from 1950 to 1949 because he did not wish to

admit that he had failed io graduate in 1949 with the majority of his class.

However, previous ejorts of NOSENKO to revert to his original 1962

statement that he graduated in 1950 were not accepted and an unwarranted

significance was given to the 1949 - early 1953 period of time.

It is considered that NOSENKO has adequately explained his

"stupid blunders" as they relate to the above and to certain other personal

matters and that his claimed service in Navy Intelligence from March

accepiabie. It is not considered necessary to comment concerning all

of the remarks in the previous summary regarding the claimed Naval

RU service of NOSENKO as reflected on pazes 49-59 and remarke will,

for purposes of brevity, be limited in scope.

The statement is made in the previous summary that "The sole

Headquarters RU officer NOSENKO identified was the Personnel Chiei,

Colonel KALOSHIN. He identified no ranking officers in either the Baltic

or Far East Intelligence Staffs. Some 30 GRU officers he did identify,

by his own admission, NOSENKO knew not from his Naval RU service,

but through social acquaintance, later, in Moscow, or through his visits

to. Geneva. "

Attached is a copy of a handwritten memorandum voluntarily

prepared by NOSENKO in late 1967 containing the names of a number

of GRU personnel of whom he had some knowledge. The attached was

not prepared as the result of any inquiry concerning his claimed Naval

RU service, but was only a small part of the material prepared by

NOSENKO at this time. The entire material included remarks by

Nosio regarding arosimarely 875 Ga officer, 20)/468 agesto,

35 GRU officers and 400 other Soviet nationals.

It is interesting to note that the altached list contains the names

oi approximately 20 GRU oilicers whom NOSENKO relates to the cariy

1950's period. In addition, NOSENKO has, during current interviews

and in other memoranda, furnished the names of additional Navy Intelii-

gence personnel whom he knew in the 1951 - early 1953 period.

Page 52 of the above summary anci other related pages question

whether NOSENKO ever served in the Baltic area with Naval Intelligence

and even question his geographical knowledge of the area. Attached is a

copy of a handwritten memorandum with certain diagrams prepared by

NOSENKO on 21 February 1968 concerning his assignment with Navy

Intelligence in the Far East and the Baltic area. The memorandum was

...compieted by NOSENKO without any reierence material and a review of

his diagrams indicates they are quite accurate.

NOSENKO had previously stated that his service in the Baltic

area was at Sovetsk Primorskiy and during current interviews recalled

that the former name of the place, an aimost deserted fisnermen's

village, was Fishausen. The previous designation given by NOSENKO

for this place as having the mail address of Sovets' Primorskiy had

caused the conclusion that his alleged place of assignment was non-

existent. A further check in the matter would have disclosed that the

place was not nonexistent, that it is currently known as Primorsk and

that the former German name of the fishing village was Fischhausen.

The previous summary diso stated that despite nis claimed

active commissioned service in the lavy, NOSENKO knew nothing of

Soviet Navy tradition, doctrines, of organization of procedures. It

snowd be noted that there is a considerable difference between being

a member of the Naval RU and being an actual member of the Soviet

Navy. The situation could be compared to a career civilian employee

of the Office of Naval Inselligence and a line officer in the United States

Navy.

SECRE:

B. NOSENKO did not enter the KGB in the manrer or at the time

Claimed. (Previous conclusion)

The above is conclusion "B" in the previous summary in regard

I NOSENKO. The conclusion in this summary is that NOSENKO entered

the then Second Chieí Directorate, MVD, in mid-March 1953 and that his

entry was not only facilitated by but due to the influence of General

Bogdan Zakharovich KC3JLOV.

Previous statements by NOSENKO and changes relative to date of

entry into the KGB have been mentioned in another section of the summary

and will not be repcated here. His statements during current interviews

that he entered on duty in mid-March 1953 as a case officer in the First

Section, First Department, Second Chief Directorate, MVD, are con-

sidered adequately substantiated and should be accepted.

The conclusion of the previous summary (pages 61-74) that

NOSENKO did not enter the KGB in the manner or at the time claimed

was primarily based on conflicting statements by NOSENKO as to when

he entered the KGB (MVD). In 1962 NOSENKO said March 1953 and in

1965 NOSENKO again said March 1953, soon after the death of STALIN.

in 1964, NOSENKO had given tvo dates in 1952 as ais time of entry into

the KGB in an eifort not to admit that he had failed to graduate from the

Institute of International Relations in 1949.

The previous summary gave considerable weight io the statemente

Of NOSENKO indicating that he did not enter the KGB (VVD) under what

are

considered normal KGB procedures.

Proper allowances were not

given for position of the father of NOSENKO, the Minister oi Shipbuilding,

and the influence.of General KOBULOV: An analyst can either accept or

reject the statement of NOSENKO that he entered the KGB (MVD) through

-the influence of General KOBULOV; but, if the statement is accepted, then

the failure of NOSENKO to be required to follow normal KGB procedures

....should also be accepted.. A Communist society or a Soviet intelligence

organization is not and could not be immune to induence by a bigh official.

General KOBULOV as of mid-March 1953 was. First Deputy io BERIYA,

the Minister of the then MVD.

The previous summary raises several points concerning the

eligibility of NOSENKO for the KGB (MVD). It points out on page 67

that other than his undistinguished period of service with the Naval RU,

he was no more eligible for a KGB appointment in 1953 than he was at

the time of his previous rejection in 1950. This statement is not contro-

vertible and is fully accepted with the qualification that in 1950 NOSENKO

•was not sponsored by any person of influence as was ine case in 1953

with General KOBELOV who in mid-Murch 1953 was the First Deputy

to BERIYA.

The previous summary also states that according to KGB

defectors familiar with the standards in jorce at the time, no candidate

was accepted who had ever had tuberculosis. This is a flat statement

which it is doubtiul any lefector or series of defectors could fully

substantiate; namely, that it never happered. Until and unless it is

medically proven that NOSENKO did not bave tuberculosis, it is accepted

that he did have tuberculosis in 1952 and was at a sanitarium -- rest.

place in Kubinka. It is also accepted that be was an officer in the KGB

after mid-March 1953. The influence of KOBULOV could undoubtedly

have permitted NOSENKO to enter the KGB even though he previously

had tuberculosis, but the flat statement that no candidate was accepted who

had ever had tuberculosis is not and cannot be sufficiently substantiated.

The previous summary contained a number of additional remarks

and conclusions intended to show that NOSENKO was not eligible for and

therefore could not have entered the KGB (MVD). Comments concerning

these will be brief since there is considered to be no adequate basis at

this time on which to contend that NOSENKO did not enter the KGB

(MVD) as an officer in mid-March 1953. A comment was made that

3.

Walad

NOSENKO did not take a physical examination in connection with his

processing for KGB entry, and that such a medical examination was

a routine and mandatory part of the processing of a KGB candidate.

This statement makes no allowance for the influence oi General

KOBULOV; but, in addition, does not consider the fact that the Naval

RU dossier on NOSENKO was available to the KGB (MVD).

The previous summary also failed to note that the MVD would

have had independent iniormation in regard to NOSENKO since the MVD

would have conducted any necessary inquiry in connection with the entry

of NOSENKO into the Naval RU. As of 1953, the iVVD undoubtedly also

had a dossier

un the father of NOSENKO since this was still the STALIN

era.

The summary also states that NOSENKO did not complete the

necessary lengthy Anketa before entry into the KGB (MVD) and did not

speak to any personnel officers or visit the personnel office. It would

seem that the influence of General KOBULOV could have permitted the

elimination of most if not all'of the necessity of complying with normal

procedures, but NOSENKO has during interviews

stated that he com-

pleted the Anketa while sitting at his desk after entry into the KGB (MVD).

Page 70 of the previous summary states that NOSENKO did not

know the designation of his own Directorate either at the time he allegedly

## Page 139

eniered on duty or during his first year of KGB

service. While

NOSENKO has claimed that the designation of his Directorate at the

time he entered the KGB (MVD) in mid-March 1953 was the Second

Chief Directorate and that it subsequently was redesignated the

First Chief Directorate, DERYABIN bas staied this reversal of

designations occurred in March 1953.

STALIN died in early March 1953 and that same month the

MVD and the MGB were merged under the name MVD with BERIYA

as Minister. BERIYA held this position until his arrest in early June

1953. BERIYA was succeeded by KRUGLOV, who held office for less

than a year. Yuriy RASIVOROV was recently queried concerning the

date of the reversal of the designation of the FCD. and SCD and places

it as the end of April or early May 1953. GOLITSYN has indicated that

• фро

the change occurred "soon aftei the advent of BERIYA as head of the

MVD in April 1953. " In the light of our inability to fix the eifective date

of the reversal of the designations of the SCD and the FCD, it is

unreasonable to impugn NOSENKO on his statement as to the designation

of his Directorate at the time of his entry into the KGB (MVD).

There is a disagreement between NOSENKO and others as to who

was responsible for the reversal of designations of the FCD and the SCD.

NOSENKO is of the opinion that it occurred under KRUGLOV, whick is

in cortici with ise staierthis of DERYABIN, RASIVOROV and

GOLITSYN, all o whom maintain that BERIYA was responsible for

the changes. As lor the issue of who was responsible ior toe reversal

of designations, it would appear that NOSENKO is in error. rowever,

the fact that be was a new junior officer and that this was a period of

upheaval in the KGB (MVD) effectively eliminates any significance in

this issue.

NOSENXO is criticized in the previous summary for not knowing

the location of the Chiel Directorate of the Militia or the hisiory of the

KI (Committee of Information). NOSENKO has stated that be had no

contacts with either office during 1953-1955 and there is no adequate reason

to disbelieve this statement. He is not aware of when the KI ceased to

exist (1951 given in the summary, but other information indicates the KI

continued to exist in a nominal capacity until the mid-1950'e), but care

should be used in stating wha: NOSENKO should know if he held a certain

position. Readers of this summary may wish to reflect on their own

memory concerning the location and their knowledge of Agency facilities at

any given period of time or when Agency components or relaied organizations

were organized of ceased to exist.

The poini has also been made that any career of NOSENKO

in the KGB snowid have ended or he should have at least encountered

difficulty when his benefacior General KOBÜLOV, together with the

brother of General XOBULOV, was arrested with the BERIYA group in

early June 1953. NOSENKO has during current interviews stated that he

encountered no difficulties but is aware that the KOBULOV connection

was discussed by an officer from the Personnel Directory with an

official of the First Department. Under other circumstances NOSENKO

would very possibly have encountered dilliculty; but, it should be noted

that the father of NOSENKO retained his position, that NOSENKO only

met General KOBULOV through his father, and that NOSENKO has stated

that although his father knew General KOBULOV, his father could in no

way be considered a member of the BERIYA group.

NOSENKO did rot serve in the American Embassy Section

throughout the 1953 - 1955 period as he claimed. (Previous conclusion)

The above is conclusion "C" in the previous summary. The

conclusion in this summary is that NOSENKO was an officer of the First

Section (American Embassy Section), First Department, from mid-Varch

1953 to late May 1955 when he was transferred to the Seventh Department,

SCD.

This period of time has been covered in detail with NOSENKO

during current interviews. The conclusion is that NOSENKO was an

officer in the First Section but was not a very effective officer and that

both his work and behavior were decidedly influenced by the fact that he

was the son of the Minister of Shipbuilding. NOSENKO is reluctant to

admit that he was other than slightly lackadaisical in his work during

this period of time, but is not hesitant to admit that his personal be-

havior was such as to cause him to be removed as Secretary to the

Komsomol unit in 1954 and to cause an unsatisfactory "characterization"

to be prepared in early 1955 which necessitated a decision as io whether

he would be fired from the KGB or transierred to some other component.

The influence of his family is quite apparent in the above since

- his father was advised of his difficulties in 1954 oy an official of the

KGB and his mother intercecied on his behalf in 1955 with the Chief of

SCD. The result in 1955 was thai NOSENKO was transferred to the

Seventh Department ard not fired from the KGB.

The question has been raised as to how NOSENKO could remaia

in the KGB when after 1954 he was not a member of the Komsomol and

was not eligible to become a candidate for the Communist Party. This

is a valid question but a plausible explanasion is again the fact that he was

the son of the then Minister of Shipbuilding.

NOSENKO has stated during previous and current interviews ira:

following his entry into the KGB and until circa mid-1954 he was respon-

sible for work against American correspondents in Moscow. He has not

claimed that he had any successes and has stated that the work with news-

paper correspondents already recruited was being handled by other officers.

NOSENKO has explained that during this time he was a "new officer, "

indicating he could hardly have been expected to act as an experienced

officer.. His knowledge of correspondents in Moscow during this period

: of time,: together. with-his knowledge of other KGB officers and his

14-00000

information concerning his own agents is believed of sufficient weight

to accept the statement of NOSEKO that work against American cor-

respondents was his assignmeni irom mid-Varcia 1953 to mid-1954.

From circa mid-1954 until his transier to ide Seventh Depart-

ment in late May 1955, NOSENKO ciaims and has claimed be was an

officer of the First Section with te responsibility of work against the

Military Attaches (Army) at the United Siaies Embassy in Moscow. It

is considered, based on his knowledge of she various Military Aitache

personnel and other collateral irformation furnished by NOSENXO, that

NOSENKO was an officer. of the First Section during the mid-1954 - late

May 1955. period of time, that his primary work was against members

of the Office oi the Military Attache, but that the quality of his work

undoubtedly left much to be desired.

In circa mid-1954, NOSENKO was removed as Secretary of the

Komsomol unit and by early 1955 his performance was such that at least

certain officials in the First Department desired his removal from the

First Department, if not the KGB. Under these circumstances,

NOSENKO could be criticized as having been a very poor if not

undesirable KGB officer, but his knowledge of the First Section during

tois period of time and his knowledge of the members of the Office of

the Military Aitache supporis the claira oi NOSENTO that he was an

officer of the Fir.i Section with the indicated assignment as related

by sin.

NOS2N%.0 has siaied that the work against the Military

Attacues was not primarily directed toward development oi recruitment

possibilities, but was direcied toward conirol of the Military Attaches

on trips in order to prevent observation of sensitive areas, sensitive

sives or sensitive activities in the USSR. This attitude by the KGB

would appear io be compietely plausible and NOSENiO noted as

exceptionai in this regard toe recruitment attempt against Captain Waiter

MULE. NOSENKO explained this exception as retaliation for approaches

to Sovieis in tao Unired Siaids in that period.

NOSENIO has been criticized because he did not know all the

deiails corcerning the Military Attaches which it was considered he

should have knovin il he had the specific responsibility for work against

the Military Araches during the indicated period of time, it is submiited

bona fides of NOSENKO if it is accepted that he actually was an officer

D. During the period of 1955 - 1960, NOSENKO was neither a

The above is conclusion "D" in the previous summary. The

current conclusion is that NOSENKO was an officer in the Seventh

Department, SCD, from late iVay 1955 to December 1959 and was

Deputy Chief of the American-British Commonwealth Section, Sevenin

Department from 1958 to December 1959.

During current interviews, NOSENKO has furnished extensive

information concerning his own activities in the Seventh Department

of KGB interest collaterally confirm that NOSENKO was personally in-

volved in certain claimed activities during 1955 to December 1959.

These activities include among others the recruitment of Richard BURG 06

In June 1956, contact with sir Allen LANE and Arthur BIRSE in the

August 1959, and the recruitment of Arsere

foregoing is not a complete list of all cases in which NOSENKO ciaims

personal invoivement, but is representative of casrs in which his alleged

participation has been confirmed by interviews with the individual who

was the KGB targel.

06, 06, 06

Sir Allen LANE, Arthur BIRSE, William Stanley iVILBY, and

David IAY LOR were British citizens and the other above-named indi-

viduals were United Stated| citizens. I'nis would acem to substantiate

the claim of NOSENKO that during 1955 - December 1959 he was an

officer engaged in KGB operations against American-British Common-

wealth tourists in the USSR.

in addition, NOSENKO has furnished specific information about

an operation against Vartin

DRIALIA, an American sourist wno was in

the Soviet Union from approximately September 1955 to December 1955.

istla|has not been interviewed andavid not be interviewed, so at thie

time no particular 1955 case in which NOSENKO claims involvement

or personal knowledge has been substantiated by interview of the

individual involved.

NOSENKO has furnished incormation on tre travel of certain

United States Government officiais, inciuding Congressional represent-

atives to ine ÜSSR in 1955 - 195ó; and the trip oi Supreme Couri Justice

William O. DOUGLAS in 1955 which, when consivered with the previously

mentioned specifics, adequately substantiate his

..imed service in the

Seventh Department and work against American-British Commonwealth

tourists during the late Vay 1955 - December 1959 period.

NOSENKO nas stressed that when he transierred to the Seventh

Department, the Tourist Section had just been established and an agent

network was not vailable for opcrations against American and British

tourists. This seems quite logical since the infix of tourists into the

USSR was ju t in,a jormative stage.

NOSENKO has spoken in dctail about an agent network he de-

veloped after 1955 which primarily consisted of Intourist personnel

and two homosexual agents, "SHMELEV" and "GRIGORIY" (KGB code

names), whose extensive use in KGB operations has been confirmed by

interviews with individuals who were the subject of homosexual com-

promise operations.

pages would be repetitious and in many instances superfiuous. Ii is

considered thât even in lie statemenis were accepted in soto, there

wouid stili noi be as adequaie basis jor a conclusion thai NOSENKO

was not an oilicer in ihe claimed positions in ine Sevenin Department

during she period of late Vay 1955 - Deceroes 1959. Nor is it con-

ceded that, i all the sub-conclusions and the interpretations oí various

areas of information were accepied without qualification, there is any

evidence that NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB. However, there

are certain assumptions and interpretations which appeared in ine

previous summary which are particularly worthy of comment and wnich

are considered erroneous or require additional clarification.

On page 1,45 it is stated that the evidence suggests that NOSENiO

was an English-speaking specialist in sexual entrapment, not a counter-

intelligence officer responsible for the identification of foreign ageris

among tourists or for the development, recruitment, and expioitation

of agents for the KGB. The Second Chief Directorate, KGB, and the

MVD have used homosexual and heterosexual compromise in numerous

known (and presumably irknowr) successiul recruitments and recruit-

ment attempts. This activity has noi been limited to the Seventh Depart-

ment, SCD; and the innuendo that NOSENKO was "only an English-

speaking specialist in sexual entrapment" and not a KGB galet-lelen

Page 145 oi the above surmary lists eleven operations which

were Seventh Depariment Cases prior to 1900 and wnich were included

in the notes furnished to Cli in 1964 by NOSENKO. The named operations

were those againe Bernard PECHTER, Patrick PRESSWAy, Join RUFE, 06, U6, 06,06, 06, 06, 06, 0k

Gerald SEVERN, Sofia SHATTAUER, (inu) KARLOV, Norman FISK,

Ralph VATLAW, Varvin KANTOR, Michael GINSBURG, and William 06, 06

was that NOSENKO could not describe the irdividual operations other

than to say that he had recorded the name of the target and such details

as he could acquire when he reviewed the activities of the Seventh Depart-

ment in 1962 following his return from the First Department.

The notes brought out by NOSENiO are considered in another

section of this summary, but it should be noted here that a full review

of all of the notes oi NOSENKO currently availabie indicates that his

statements as to how and why he obtained the information in the notes

are completely piausible. A detailed explanation of the notes furnished

by NOSENKO would almost necessitate a separate listing of the approxi-

mately 150 cases or names mentioned in toe notes.

During curren: inierviews, NOSENKO furnished specific

information on certain of the above eleven cases, including William

TA2AS4A, Bernard PaCHE Xichaei Michaei GiNSBUG and John Ruza, 06, 06, 06,06,06

It shouid aiso be noied that certain of the cases such, as Marvin KANTOR.

and am fRAska were carea in winich the tourist was siting

reiatives in the Soviet Union and that NOSENKO has given a satisfactory

expianaiion oi how he jearneà oi the KANTOR case. NOSENKO has, in

discussing his duties as Depusy Cilief oi the American-British Common-

wealtn Section, aiso explained that il a tourist indicated that he intended

to visit relatives in the USS.:, the case automaticaily was assigned to a

group of officers in the Section who reported directiy to the Chief of

Section and were, not under the supervision of NOSENKO.

NOSENKO has siated that he noted the names of three of the

individuals when retiring the files oi "GRIGORIY" and "SHMELEV, "

two homosexual agents of NOSENKO previously mentioned. NOSENKO

bas expiained that "SHIMELEY" and "GRIGORIY" had the assignment of

identifying American travelers with homosexual tendencies, that they

had contact with numerous Americans, and that they had homosexual

activity with individuals on whom they reported but on whom no overt

action was taken by the Seventh Department.

NOSENKO has aiso expiained how he learned of the Patrick

PRESSVANjand Gerald SEVERAcases; and, ine listing of the Soiia O6

SHATTAUER case in connection with the 1955 - 1959 period is in com-

plete error since page 427 oí the previous summary contains information

from NOSENKO on her recruitment in 1962. During current interviews

the notes which NOSENKO brought out in 1964 have been discussed in

detail with NOSENKO. He has given a detailed explanation of the material

which he brought out and his explanation of all aspects is very convincing.

The previous summary (page 144) suggested that the involvement

Oi NOSENKO in certain cases being handled by other Sections in the

Seventh Department or by ihe KGB Directorate of Moscow was unusual.

An examination of the cited cases does not incicate that his participation

was unusual, but rather that his explanation of why he was involved is

logical and normal. No consideration was previously given to the English

language capability of NOSENKO or the fact that his own homosexual agents

were used in two of the four cited cases.

The summary also noted that there was a question concerning

whether Gisella HARRIS jwas necessarily a Seventh Department case.

Iris question seems quite superfitious sincelia. Juan in the USSR

on a tourisi visa ard "real" tourisis are tie responsility of the Sevenin

Department. Deparunental responsibility within ine SCD ior an indi-

vicual traveling in tie ÜSSR is decided on the basis oi how the individual

is traveling; i. e., whether on a tourist visa, as a member of a dciegation,

as the invitee of an organization in the USSR, as a jormer diplomat

stationed in Moscow, as a dipiomat not previously stationed in Moscow;

as a member oi ine Cuitural Exchange program, as a student altending

a uriversity in the USSR, etc. There are also various other factors

which afiect the determination of which Department or organizational

component of the SCD has the responsibility for a tourist case. These

factors include whether the individual is already suspected of foreign

intelligence comections and whether the individual is a businessman.

In addition, certain actual tourists in the USSR may never become the

responsibility oi the SCD if the individual is of specific interest to the

ECD.

On pages 148 - 149, NOSENKO is criticized for not knowing at

least some of the substance of the information furnished by George

BLAKE in regard to the CIA-MI-6 program of utilizing tourist agents

in the ÜSSR. This criticism completely ignored the fact that NOSENKO

made several references in 1962 to the KGB having such information

althouga he did then and still suspects thai William VASSAiL was the

source. The reierences dy NOSENKO to the KGB having such inior-

mation were noi developed in 19ú2 or later interrogations, and it was

not until current interviews thai it was establisned that NOSENZO had

actually seen excerpis o iniormation passe by George BLAKE.

According to NOSENKO, the incormation which was covious iy only

partial was furnished to the FCI by the SCD and couid oniy have come

from an agent.

The previous summary (page 149) also notes that in 1961 CLA

acquired a lengthy Top Secret study on the subject of the use of tourists

by American Intelligence for espionage and operational support in the

Soviet Union (document was furnished by GOLITSYN following his de-

fection in December 1961). it was noted ihat the summary contained

references to certain 1958 - 1959 tourists whom the KGB counter-

inielligence identified as Amirican agents and notea that NOSENKO

claimed he was Deputy Chief oi the American-British Commonwealth

Section in this period of time and that he claimed the KGB identified

no American Intelligence agents during this period of time. What later

is described as a claim by NOSENKO is reither an accurate reflection

o what NOSENKO said prior to 1967 or has said since 1967.

quite aware that certain of the Americar iourists in 1958 - 1959 were

actig suspiciously irom a KGB point of view.

NOSENKO has stated he was aware that a document which the

Seventh Department had prepared and iurnished to the ECD in an effort

to obtain further assistance from the FCD in the work againsi tourists

had been compromised by GOLITSYN. NOSENIO stated he was not in

document had been compromised. The document furnished by GOLITSYN

has never been reviewed with NOSENKO to determine if it contained

aciditional information not in the document which he was aware had

been prepared by ine Seventh Department for the FCD.

F. NOSENKO's claims, that in 1962 he was Chief of the

American-British Commonwealth Section and was irereafter a

Deputy Chief of the Seventh Departmert, are not credible. (Previous

conclusion)

The conclusion of this summary is that NOSENKO was Cbief

of the American-British Commonwealth Section (First Section) from

January 1962 to July 1962 and that he was.a Deputy Chief of the Seventh

Department thereafter.

NOSENKO bas stated that, although be was offered the position

of a Deputy Chief of the First Department, SCD, by Oleg iM. CRIBANOV.

Chief, SCD, and although an order had been prepared and was in the

, Personnel Directorate, he declined ine profiered position.

According to NOSENKO, he knew that Sergey Mikhaglovich

FEDOSEYEV, the Chief of the First Department, did not want NOSENKO

as a Deputy Chief, but instead wanted to promoie Vladislav KOVSHUK,

then Chief of the First Section, to the position. FEDOSEYEV was

willing to promoie NOSEVKO to the position of Chiei, First Section.

However, GRIBANOV did not wish to promote KOVSiluK and NOSENKO

considered ihat under the circumstances it would be better for him to

return to the Seventh Department rather than to become a Deputy to

FEDOSEY EV who wanted KOVSriüKas a Deputy.

Vladimir Dmitriyevich CHELNOKOV had offered NOS ENKO the

position of Chief of the First Section, Seventh Department, pending the

reassignment of BALDIN to Germany at which time NOSENKO would

become a Deputy Chief, Seventh Department, replacing BALDIN. The

above explanation of NOSENKO seems plausible and credible and indi-

cates that GRIBANOV, the Chief of the SCD, for reasons best known to

GRIBANOV, was assisting NOSENKO in his career in the KGB.

This section actually covers two periods in the claimed career

Of NOSENKO; namely, January - July 1962 as Chief of the First Section,

and July 1962 - January 1964 as a Deputy Chief of the Seventh Depart-

ment. Since NOSENKO was in Geneva, Switzerland, irom March to

June 1962, he actually cannot be seriously faulted for not having de-

tailed knowledge of the activities of the First Section during January -

July 1962. The previous summary (pages 268 - 291) contains remarks

in regard to the January - July 1962 period, including the period of

March - June 1962 when he was in Geneva. Four specific tourist cases

are discussed in the previous summary; the cases of Wailace Everer 06; 06, 06,06

JOHNSON, William Carroll JONES, Natalie BIENSTOCK, and Horst

BRAUNS, Apparent conflicis between information from NOSENKO and

information derived from subsequent interviews with these individuals

were cited as evidence impugning NOSENKO. It is not believed that the

previous comments concerning these cases constitute any substantial

evidence that NOSENKO did not hoid the claimed position of Chief oi the

First Section, Seventh Department, during January - July 1962. That

there were KG& operations against JOHNSON, JONES, BlENSTOCK and 06, 06, 06, 06

BRAUNS has been confirmed through interviews by the FBI of all four

individuals.

A few additional remarks in regard to the above four cases are

warranted, not because it is considered that there are any substantial

discrepancies between what NOSENKO has said and whai each individual

stated when interviewed, but because they may provide additional clari-

fication.

In the Wallace Everett JOHNSONcase, it was previously noted

ibarJOinson arzived in Moscow on 31 December 1961 and that the KGB

operation against him occurred on 5 January 1962. The summary sug-

gested that the short lapse of time indicated that the homosexual tend

encies al jOHNson were known to the KGB prior to his arrival, contrary

to the statements of NOSENKO. NOSENKO during cur got in friews

In regard to ine William Carroll JONES]case, NOSENKO during

as an agent to work against JONES|and was used in another case. The other

with his claim to having been Chief of the First Section, Severth Department.

In regard to the Horst BRAUNS/case, in the previous summary

the criticism was levied that oSaiko did not know why leats wigied

met in the USSR. It was also stated that NOSENKO had explained that

the Seventh Depariment was noi concerned with ioreigners visiting

relaiives in the ÜSSR nor with Soviet expatriates. NOSENXO, accord-

ins to the previoia summary, was aware lar BRAinsivas a lormer

Soviet citizen and the summary stated that his plan to visit relatives

was information available to the KGB icrouga his visa application.

In regara to the staiement that the Seventh Depariment was not

concerned with foreigners visiting relatives in the USSR nor with Soviet

expatriates, this is rot in agreement with current information from

NOSENIO, * Cases of "true" tourists, which were normally the respon-

sibility of the Seventh Department, could become the responsibility. of

another department or KGB component where Soviet relatives were

involved. Howerer, if the case was not taken over or assigned by higher

responsibility of she Seventa Department. The laci that/BRAUNS,was a

former Soviet citizen could very wol bave made FAUNS or intoront to

authority, the case would remain toe responsibility of the Sevento Depart-

meat since BRAviSwas visiting the Soviet Vaions on a tourist visa. The

previous summary also indicated tha BRA Gris listed on big fisa appli-

relátive or relatives in Leningrad. Alhough BRAUNS, when interviewed by

the FBI, mentioned a number of items o wnich the KGB was aware concern-

ing his background and occupation iron his visa application, there is no

specific reierence in these interviews indicating his statement of purpose

in visiting ice ÜSSR.

Pages 282 - 286 of the previous summary reviews remaris by

NOSENKO on the Boris BELITSKIY case and states that nis claimed role

in the case was not plausibic. There are several ayecific points made in

the summary which imply that NOSENKO was lying about his knowledge of

the case. Taere is adequate reason to believe that NOSENKO exaggerated

his own 1962 role in that NOSENKO now states he was to give assistance

to Vladimir Lvovich ARTEMOV in the handling of BELITSKIY in Geneva

in 1962 and soi to supervise ARTEMOV.

The more important aspect and the primary one is the difference in

what NOSENKO specifically reported about the BELITSKIY case and inior-

mation from the aclual CIA record of the case. There are major differ-

ences and without going into all the details of the case which is very involved,

an effort has been made toward determining wether these apparent differ-

ences necessarily indicate that NOSENKO was or is lying or whether there

is a possibility he is relating the actual KGB version of the case.

NOSENKO has stated that BELITSKIY was a KGB agent whom

American Inielligence recruited in London in 1960 or 1961 and that the

0001223

SECRET

VIBR

---

## Page 227

4-00000

KGB purpose in running the operation was to lure American Intelligence

into meeting BELITSKIY insice ine USSR. The previous summary stated

that NOSENKO did not know when the BZLITSKI: operation started

(Brussels, Belgium, 1958), dic not know the rature of the British

involvement, did nit inow the operationai details and contact arrange-

ments BELITSKIY had with CIA, ard did not know BELITSKIY's pattern

of activity in Moscow or Geneva.

NOSENKO during current interviews has indicated an awareness

that the KGB (Second Section, First Department) had been trying to use

BELITSKIY against the British. However, he still has dated the recruit-

ment of BELITSKIY as 1960-1961 in Loadon and still states that the

primary purpose of the KGB was to involve American Intelligence in

contacts with BELITSKIY within the USSR. The latter was considered

completely inconsistent with the fact that BELITSKIY was recruited in

Brussels, Belgium, in 1958; that three letters bad been mailed to

BELITSKIY in the USSR in 1959 and early 1960; and that BELITSKIY

had an accommodation address for contact outside the USSR.

There are at this time suíficient unresolved questions in the

BELITSKIY case to preclude any conclusion that the apparent dis-

crepancies between the statements by NOSENXO on the BELITSKIY

case and the actual record are a reflection against NOSENKO U001 224

the other band, there is some reason to believe NOSENKO has

furnished the actial KGB version of the BELITSKIY case and that the

XGB, at least as of 1962, did not know the true story of the relation-

ship of BELiTSiSIY wita CIA. There is a distinct possibility the

KGB believed the BELITSKIY recruitment occurred in 1961 in London

and BELITSKIY dia not then nor has he since admitted to the KGB

vis association with CIA actually started in 1958 in Brussels, Belgium.

As a possible reason why BELITSKIY would have told the KGB in

1961 a partial story of his contact with American Intelligence, some:

at present unknown event may have occurred in 1961 which caused

BELITSKIY to believe his security was endangered and as a result

he told the KGB of certain events in London in 1961, relating these

events as being the original approach to BELITSKIY by CIA.

The following are certain of the points which suggest the KGB

actually considered that BELITSKIY was recruited by CIA in London

in 1961 and that BELITSKIY may have never told the KGB of the

developments in his case prioz to 1961:

(a) BELITSKIY was in London in April 1960 at which

time be was in contact with a British citizen who was also

reporting to MI-5. This individual reported information

received from BELITSKIY which may have been a lead to

0001225

SECRET

## Page 229

14-00000

George BLAKE, (It seems highly likely the KGB would

ever have directed BELITSKlY to iurnish information which

may have been a lead to George BLAKE, or at least could

have caused the employees of the unit in which BLAKE was

employed from June

1959 to Augusi 1960 to come under

suspicion as having passed information to Soviet Intelligence.)

(b) NOSENKO has staied thai BELITSKIY, aiter he went

to Geneva in 1962, managed to reinitiate contact with CIA

rather quickly because he met a girl he had previously known

whom he was sure was an American Intelligence agent and

that she must have reported his presence in Geneva to American

Intelligence. (I the BELITSKIY case had been controlled by the

KGB from its inception in 1958, the KGB would have known of

the internal mailings to BELITSKIY and the fact that BELTSKIY

had a cover address outside the Soviet Union through which to

initiate contact. However, if BELITSKIY did not tell the KGB

anything about his contacts with CIA prior to 1961 and then

gave only a partial story oi what happened in London in 1961,

BELITSKIY would not have told the KGB of the internal mail-

ings to BELITSKIY in the USSR or the fact that he long had

a cover address outside the USSR. BELITSKIY therefore

As previously indicated, the conclusion is there are a suíficient

number of unresoived questions in the BELITSKiY case so that discrep-

ancies between information f:om NOSENKO and the actual record in the

BELITSKIY case cannot at present be considered as a reilection against

NOSENKO, and there is a distinci possibility the KGB actually did not

know the true facts of the BELITSKIY case.

The previous summary noied on page 106 that Nataliya SHULGINA

was an Intourist interpreter recruited by NOSENKO in 1955. It also

noted that NOSENKO had stated Boris BELITSKIY "reported to the KGB

..that CIA had warned BELITSKIY agairst SHULGINA." The previous

summary stated BELITSKIY reported to CIA that SHULGINA was a KGB

agent and "CIA did not warn BELITSKIY. "

There appears to be no doubt at this time that the statement by

NOSENKO that BELITSKIY reported the "CIA had warned BELITSKIY

against SHULGINA, " is a rcasonably accurate description of what actuay

happened in May 1962 during Agency contacts with BELTSKIY in Geneva.

The record reflects that BELITSKIY stated SHULGINA had confidentially

told him of her status as a KGB agent, stating she had been doubled by

the KGB after having been forcibly recruited by American Intelligence

whie previously in Paris, France.

and BELITSKIY was warned SHULGINA may have been acting on behaif

of the KGB in stating to BELITSKIY she had been "forcibly recruited by

American Inteiligence" at a previous date. It was also suggested to

BELITSKIY that he should go to the KGB as a loyal Soviet citizen and

report the apparent indiscretion of SHULGiA.

Pages 282 - 286 of the previous summary, in connection with

the BELITSKIY case, made reference to Vladimir Lvovich ARTEMOV.

It was stated that ARTEVOV had been involved with a series of America.:

tourist agents in the Soviet Union and although NOSENKO was allegedly

familiar with ARTEMOV, he was unaware of the involvement of ARTEMOV

with American tourist agents in 1958 - 1959.

The summary noted this

was during a period when NOSENKO claimed to have been Deputy Chief

of the American-British Commonwealth Section of the Seventh Depart-

ment. Although not specifically stated, the above suggested ARTEMOV

was actually in the Seventh Department in 1958 - 1959 and that NOSENKO

was not even aware ARTEMOV was in the Seventh Department. NOSENKO

has consistently stated that ARTEMOV was assigned to the First Section,

First Department, from the time he entered into the KGB in approxi-

mately 1957.

A closer examination of the cases described in the previous

summary as "CiA American tourist agents," reveals there is no con-

flict in the invoivement of ARTEMOV in these cases and the statement

by NOSENKO that ARTEMOV was with the First Section, First Depart-

ment. As an example, one of the cases is ine case of Edivard MCGOWAN, 06

NOSENKO has furnished information concerning this case, stating it was

originally a Seventh Department case and that after the mailing of a letter

by the individual in Minsk, the case was immediately taken over by the

First Department. There is adequate reason to believe ARTEMOV only

became involved after the case was transferred to the First Department.

Another of the cases invoived the contact of ARTEMOV withla CIA

officer who waß under Department of State cover in Helsinki, Finland,

and visited the USSR on a tourist visa. Such an individua, would under

no circumstances be considered a true tourist or the responsibility of

the Seventh Department, particularly since apparently the individual was

even traveling under a diplomatic passport. it is, assumed the individual

was oi interest to the First Chief Directorate and if the First Chief

Directorate required or desired support from ine SCD, it would normally

request the First Department for such assistance and it is extremely ur-

likely that the FCD would request the Seventh Department for assistance

in a case involving an American diplomat.

Pages 332 - 333 of the previous summary contain the basis

for the previous conclusion thai the claim of NOSENKO that he was a

Deputy Chieí oí the Seventa Departnent from Juiy 1962 to January

1963 was not credible. It is considered that a detailed rebuital is

not necessary since this conclusion was apparently based on inadeçlate

information. During current interviaws, NOSENKO has furnished

details concerning his duties and other aspects of his claimed position

which substantiate his claim, to having been a Deputy Chief of the

Seventh Depariment from July 1962 to January 1964.

An example in support of the statement that the previous conclu-

sion was based on inadequate iniormation is the matter of the written

notes which NOSENKO brought out and furnished to CIA in early 1964..

The description of these notes on page 319 of the previous summary is

inadequate, inaccurate, and misleading. Prior to current interviews,

an effort had not been made to obtain from NOSENKO a detailed expian-

ation of his notes or of how he obtained the information in the notes.

During current interviews, NOSENKO has given detailed iníorma-

tion concerning ail aspects of his notes. This information supports his

claimed position of Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department and includes

collateral support to his claim of being Deputy Chief of the First Section,

First.Department, in 1960 - 1961.

Primarily the notes of NOSENIO can be categorized as

follows:

• (a) Snori case summaries by the Chiefs of the

First Seciion, Second Section and Sixth Section, Sevents

Department. NOSENKO has stied that he was in 1902 -

1963 responsibie for supervision over these Sections and

that Filip Denisovich BOBKOV, Deputy Chiei, SCD, who

supervised the Seventh Department, requested a list of all

recruited agents of the Seventh Department. According to

NOSENKO, the order irom BOBKOV was to only retain the

files (cases) of agents in tourist firms and that the files of

other recruited ageris should be sent to the FCD or Archives.

NOSENiO has siatca that he in turn levied on the Chieis of

the tree Sections the requirement of BOBKOV, but also ex-

panded the request to include ail 1960 - 1962 cases, nor

excluding previous cases or cases which had already been

given to the FCD. The noies of NOSENKO included hand-

written reports from the Chie of Acting Chief of each Section

on recruited agents, with information varying from agent to

agent and even including some human errors.

Many of the above cases had previously been trans-

ferred to the FCD, but the remarks of NOSENKO abou thejf0 U1232

inclusion support his statement thai he had expanded

the original request irom BOBKOV so that he would have

some "pieces of irformation lo give CIA."

(b)

Notes by NOSENKO on other cases which he learned

of during the 1962 - 1963 period. Certain of the notes were

made from a review of a noteboois kept by the Chief, Severth

Department, to which NOSENKO had access on at least two

occasions.

Most of his notes were not detailed but were

sufficient to refresh the memory of NOSENKO at a later

date and yet were somewhat innocuous to maintain before

his defection.

(c) Notes for lectures to officers of the Seventh Directorate

prepared while with the First Department, 1960 - 1961, and

the Seventn Department, 1962 - 1263.

(d) Drait report for the briefing of the new Chief, First

Department, in the latter part of 1961.

(e) One of three copies of an unregistered report pre-

pared by the Chief, Seventh Department, and two Deputy Chiefs,

including NOSENKO. This was a briefing paper for use by the

Chief (CHELNOKOV) in an appearance before the Collegium

of the KGB which was reviewing the activitieu of the Seventh

Drpartment.

According to NOSENKO, the prepared

report was never syped as a formal document.

The view has been

set forin thai NOSENKO took undue risk in

carrying written notes with him out of the Soviet Union. An examination

of this material suggests that NOSENKO was using extreme care in

collecting material and was not attempting to obtain documents, the

possession of which might be incriminating or which il he had brought

out would have been immediately missed. Instead, he collected a con-

siderable amount of valuable information which he could bring out with

little or no fear that a rearch of his effects in the KGB aiter his depart-

ure for Geneva would disclose that certain material was missing. None

of the material was registered and all could have previously been des-

troyed by NOSENKo.

The previous summary stated that NOSENKO brought three. KGB

documents to Geneva. These were typed papers but none was registered

or actually accountable. The reference to three documents was to:

(a) The drait report for the briefing of the Coliegium

which has been mentioned previously.

(b) A typed two-page report on several cases. Actually

a Chief of Section had typed his notes on cases instead of

submitting in handwriting as the others did.

G. NOSENKO :as no valid claim to certainty that the KGB

recruited no American Embassy personnel between 1953 and his

defection in 1964. (Previous conclusion)

The conclusion in tais summary is that NOSENKO is of the

opinion that taere were no KGB recruitmenis of United States Embassy

personnel in Voscow between 1953 and December 1963 with the exception

Of "ANDREY" (Dayle Wailis SMITH) and Herbert HOWARD] who actually

was aus) employee but did work part of she time in the Embagay.

The question bere is whether or not the expressed opinion of

NOSENKO is sufficiently based on actual knowledge so that this opinion

can be accepted as absolute evidence that there were no other KGB

recruitments of Embassy personnel during this period of time. The

only logical conclusion is that the opinion of NOSENKO cannot be

accepted as absolute fact and, therefore, there is a possibility that

a recruitment could have occurred and NOSENKO not be aware in any

way of the recruitment. This sould in no way be interpreted as a

suggestion that NOSENKO could be lying, but rather that an unbiased

observer without personal knowledge could and should be hesitant to

accept the expressed opinion of NOSENKO in this particular area.

The actual basis for the stated opinion of NOSE NIl lild be

examined and can be cited as follows.

(a) During Marcia 1953-jaie May 1955 NOSENKO

was a case officer in the Firsi Secion, First Department,

SCD. NOSENKO does noi claim that he would kave known

the detais concerning any recruitments (oteer than

"ANDREY") in this period, jut staies if there had been

be would have beard "sometaing."

(b) During late May 1955 to December 1959 NOSENKO

was in the Seventh Department, not the First Department,

but continued to have contact with certain officers in the

First Section, First Department. NOSENKO is of the

opinion that if there had been a recruitment in the United

States Embassy during this period he would have heard

"something" even though he would probably have learned

few details.

(c) During the January 1960-December 1961 period

NOSENKO was Deputy Chiei of the First Section, First

Department,

and he has made the categorical statement

that there were no recruitments by the KGB of United

States Embassy personnel during this period of time.

He has also stated that if there had been any recruitments

during the 1953-1959 period he is sure he would, during

1960-1961, have heard of learned some details of kg901239

excepi for tie periods of time that he was in the United

States to reactivaie "ANDREY" in 1957-1958 and a

period of time that he was Deputy Chief of the First

Department.

(d) During 1962-1963 NOSENKO was again in the

Seventh Department. However, he continued to maintain

contact with certain officers of the First Section, First

Department: in particular, Gennadiy I. GRYAZNOV,

who succeeded NOSENKO as Deputy Chief of the First

Sectión, then became Chief of Section, and in the laiter

part of 1963 became a Deputy Chief of the First Department.

According to NOSENKO his relationship with

GRYAZNOV was sufficiently close during 1962-1963 that

he is sure GRYAZNOV would have furnished NOSENKO

some information in regard to any successful recruitments

. of United States Embassy personnel. NOSENKO pointed

out that he learned of the existence of the Fierbert HOWARD]

case from GRYAZNOV in 1962, although it was not until

1963 that NOSENKO heard the name. NOSENKO actually

of NOSENKO, acceptance of the opinios of NOSENKO as being an

honest opiaton should not be converted into a statement that it 16

absolute proof that another recrultment could not have occurred.

NOSENKO may be completely correct in bla opinion, but since

NOSENKO was only in the Firel Dopartment 1953 - 1955 and 1960 - 1961

his optatos that he would have heard "something" about a recruitment

in 1953 - 1959 or 1962 - 1963 cannot be accepied as intallible.

POPOV in January 1959, this iriormasion should be considered as

possibiy information oí a deceptive nature unless an adequaie explaricion

The primary quesiion, however, as regards the Cherepanov

Papers is whether, even if it is presuned te KG3 obtained iniormation

identification of POPOV, suis Wouid be incorputible with information

in the papers and could orij icaù to tie concision thai ide japers contain

The conclusion in regard io the above is that te fuci the papers

attribute the exposure of POPOV to the KG3 to surveillance on WINTERS

when he mailed the leiter to POPOV in January 1959 is not incompatible

with the distinct possibility that the KGB had previously obtained infor-

mation from an FCD agent or agents which actually led to suspicion in

regard to POPOV or actual identification of POPOV.
