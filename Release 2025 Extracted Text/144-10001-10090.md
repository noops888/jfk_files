--

With reference to your enciphered telegram Nr. 52135((A)) ,

dated 23 August 1963, and my message Nr. 822((B)), dated

6 November 1963, I report that I presented a second plea in

the case of CARLOS ESPIN[XU] Y ESCALES ((C)) on the same day

that his sentence was pronounced.

The plea was submitted by Dr. RAUL ROA, Cuban Foreign

Minister, to President DORTICOS, who told Dr. ROA to inform me

that on that same day he [ESCALES] had been executed, before

Cuba knew about Mexico's note. In any event, the sentence of

capital punishment would not have been commuted, because he was

one of the principal persons responsible for an attempt against

the life of the Prime Minister, Dr. FIDEL CASTRO.

((A)) Available if required. IMXDN W/S 14989, dated 22 August

1963. Text similar to that contained in 3/0/MXD/T1204-63.]

((B)) Not available.

( (C))

Not identified.
