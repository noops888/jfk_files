WE RESEARCHED THE GYVAPOROUS PROMISE TO DELIVER FILES ON
*<LEE HARVEY OSWALD.> WHILE NOT MUCH ON THIS SUBJECT IS REFLECTED IN
THE FILES, WE DID COME UP WITH INFORMATION WHICH INDICATES THAT
THE ORIGINAL
THAT MATTER WAS TURNED OVER TO THE FBI FOR ACTION!

OCTOBER 1992, DC/CETF/W VISITED MINSK FOR FOLLOW-UP DISCUSSIONS

THOUGH WE COULD HELP FACILITATE THEIR PASSAGE TO THE PROPER USG
AUTHORITIES (THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT)

V/1 THEN TOLD OUR C/O THAT THE FBI'S LETTER SHOULD BE
SENT TO THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SUPREME SOVIET VICE THE PRIME MINISTER
AND WE AGREED TO SO INFORM THE FBI. THAT MEMO IS THE LAST
INFORMATION WE HAVE ON THE MATTER. THERE IS NOTHING TO INDICATE
THAT THE FBI DID INDEED SEND THE LETTER OR, IF IT WAS SENT, THAT
THEY RECEIVED A REPLY TO IT. BECAUSE IT WAS PREVIOUSLY DETERMINED
THAT THE FBI HAD PRIMACY IN THIS MATTER, IT IS OUR DETERMINATION
THAT WE SHOULD NOT REQUERY JYVAPOROUS. WE HAVE ASKED OUR REP AT
THE FBI TO CHECK (INFORMALLY) AS TO THE STATUS OF THEIR DIALOGUE
WITH THE JYVAPOROUS AND WILL LET YOU KNOW AS SOON AS WE RECEIVE
THE ANSWER. PLEASE ASSURE THE AMBASSADOR THAT HE WOULD LIKE US TO
PURSUE THIS MATTER WITH THE FBI THROUGH OUR CHANNELS, WE WILL BE
GLAD TO DO SO. REGARDS.
