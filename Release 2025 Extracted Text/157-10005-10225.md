Niarchos' ship captains named Katopodes brought a libel action

I believe it was, against Onassis for some letter he had written

about some activities of Katapodes, I can't remember the

details now.

We didn't know where this was leading. So this was in

the Supreme Court of New York State, and so I went to a fellow

I knew in the U.S. Attorney's office and asked him if he

could keep track of how this suite was developing to see if

it was leading into some of the connections we had, par-

ticularly with Niarchos.

And he got some of the pleadings and some of the pre-

trial evidence --

Mr. Wides. But you don't recall any contacts between

the Agency and the Justice Department resulting in Mr. Yeagley

going up to try and halt some aspects of the grand jury

proceedings in New York growing out --

Mr. Houston. :It strikes no valve.

Mr. Wides. Let me ask just one more question in this

area and then we will move on to the document I asked you to

look at before we started.

Mr. Maxwell.

I have just one other question.

employee.

And at the time Mr. Joost and the other fellows

were CIA employees of the station at Thailand in 1951

they were

alleged to have been involved in disposing of Mr.

Kilham's

body, and there was a serious question as to whether one or

both of them had been involved in his death.

And then I believe

in 1955 this was brought to the attention

of the Agency through

the efforts, among others, of Mr. O Donnell, who was then the

station chief, Justin O'Donnell.

Who came back and raised it

with Mr. Wiesner, and then I

believe it was raised with

Mr. Kirkpatrick and with

yourself.

Do you recall that

/incident and the eventual denouement

of the affair?

Mr. Houstono

I cannot remember the exact chronology.

I had thought

they had gotten the report on the problem a

little earlier than you suggested. But i can't argue it.

Mr. Wides. Do youknow if any action was taken earlier

than theftime in 1955 when MI. O'Donnell fifat zalsed it with

Mr. Wiesner?

Mr. Houston. I didn't know that Justin o donnell was

the

one -- at least I don't recall it, so I don't know exactly

how it first came to my attention. But when it did, tol the

best of my recollection, Lyman Kirkpatrick and I, and I elink

Frank Wiener was probably involved, tried to assemble all

the facts to find out insofar as possible what had gone

on's

It was a confused picture. All sorts of interpersonal feelings.

I don't know if it refreshes your recol-

Mr.. Houston.

And I said, there is no particúlar problem, because

it because there is no crime

against the U.S. that I canafind in this situation, it is a

crime against the Thai sovereignty.

And Allen said, that-well may be. But I still think

that I want to report this to Justice.

And he asked me to prepare a dètailed report on a

classified basis.

were that

kind of cases which CIA had with Justice, and the referrals,

and you had gone through one. And I wondered if you wanted

to go through the other two.

Mr. Houston. All right.

The second one was quite an interesting one. If I give

it in too much detail, excuse me.

Mr. Maxwell. Off the record.

(Discussion off the record.)

MI. Maxwell. Back on therecord.

Mr. Houston. The staff officer in Italy all of a

sudden disappeared from his post, and there was indication

that he had with him a considerable sum of money, something

in the nature of $30,000, I can't remember the exact amount.

This was promptly reported, and he disappeared into the blue.

The station started looking into it. And I believe we

sent people over to try and look into it, and found that

there had been a serious family problem between himself and his

wife.

Finally, through some sort of source in Mexico we got

word that this fellow was near Mexico City, and he passed word

to the station through a lawyer that he had written all the

operational details of what he had been engaged in in Italy,

which again were very sensitive, sealed them, and put them

in a vault which only thelawyers could get at, with instruc-

MI. Wides. Is there a file in the OGC office generally

regarding, not necessarily every one, but many of your --

which would contain many or most of OGC contacts with

Administrative agencies over the years?

Mr. Houston. No, because they weren't - there probably

is a substantial file on relations with Internal Revenue.

But those were to a large part either working out our own

tax equations on our own personnel with cover problems which

you probably know about, or the CAT situation, or Southern

Air Transport, and not interferring with IRS prosecutions,

although several times we were involved - here is the type of

case I guess you are talking about.

What is the fellow out in the Philippines -- I think his

name is Stenchill - who had one of the biggest tax assess-

ments made against an individual made against him, I think.

$2 million?

And Btorekill, very definitely tried to involve

us in his defense. There was some connection with Stonehin

in the Philippines, you couldn't be in the Philippines without

some connection with them. And yet gave IRS the full in-

formation, and said, don't bother with us, we are not

concerned.

Mr. Wides. What about such things as the contacts with

And incidentally, the outside investment counsel would

not know why we turned it down.

Mr. WideSo

Were all of the investment decisions

MOTUAL - and you use that in

the

broad

sense, I don't fully understand the relationships among all

the aspects of the complex -- but were all

the investment

decisions, the Eurodollars and the small

amount of stock and

the like made by outside counsel or were

there some invest-

ment initiatives which originated within the Agency?

Mr. Houston. For a while almostall of them were made

by this outside counsel. It was not

too happy a relationship,

not because of his fault. I

think he was doing his honest

best. But we took too long processing his recommendations and

often lost a market by taking too long through our own in-

ternal controls.

So, finally,

weydecided that while we had gone to him

for a good reason,

that is, so we could show thatifye had

relied on outside

counsel of known stature, that it as

• not fair either

to him or to us to be in circumstances where

we were really secondguessing him through our own internàl

procedures

and our own invetment sort of Board of Directors.

So we

left, I hope, on friendly terms.

(Discussion off the record.)

Mr.

Houston.

To go back to the start -- it may have

already been

the OGC office

told -- back in the last fifties we found in

that the hardest thing to cope with

were bene-

fits for death

disability insured under covert

circumstan-

ces, particularly

when, as so often happened, no

prior planning

had been made for this.

Even the prior planning is diffi-

cult, because if you are going to put an agent into certain

circumstances, and say you will get him

insurance through

Mutual of Omaha, if the circumstances

ox the Department are

later known to Mutual of Omaha,

they might say, well, that

is not a risky cover, and continually you wouldn't have

your insurance.

So, we came to the conclusion that we needed our own in-

surance business, and we started by buying two very small

off-shore insurance companies, and started writing death and

health policies. Now,

the business grew quitel capialy to

cover all sorts of covert operations. And we went to two

large outside insurence companies and asked if they would

• cooperate and take

some of the policies either on a

fully

pro-

tected basis

from us, or if they saw fit, for their own account.

And both of

them did both. They would take some risks for

their own account, and the only thing we would ask is that

they

protect the investigation in case it got into sensitive

fields.

GEtting back to the question I alluded

to while we

off the record, did any questions

arise about

whether the people

on the board, the investment board, or manag-

ing board of Mutual

who were from within the

Agency, would

have access to economie

intelligence or political intelli-

gence relevant to their own thinking on investments, and

where there was any question of a proprietary involved?

Mr. Houston. The membess of the board were always free

to bring up their ideas for investments, particularly in the

stock field, until more recent years. But mainly we were

consulting the economic experts

for

their general economic knowl-

edge on trends and any input

they could

give on basic invest-

ment policies.

Mr. Wides. That would include, I asgume, economic in-

telligence regarding

for example, the trend of whether there

was likely to be a

copper shortage, or the tread of

whether there was

Do you recall any policy papers/or reviews

generally as to the use of Agency knowledge in

the broadest

by outside?

Mr. Houston.

There were various basic general policy

them and put them before

the board -- in which this may have

been touched on. I don't

recall it specifically.

MI. Maxwell. The source of funds invested under the

Mr. Maxwell.

Were there other sources

went back into the investment fund?

MI. Houston.

They would all go into the central in-

vestment fund, and in the initial stages, particularly where

there was income from funds and

dividends -- until the stock

market broke there were some capital

gains registered. Then

the investment policy went more and

more, particularly as
