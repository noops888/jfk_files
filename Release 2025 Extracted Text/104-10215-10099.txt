SUBJECT: GENERAL OPERATIONS
SPECIFIC. Request for Project Authorization
REFERENCE: TZP-W-411
20 May 1949
1. Authorization is hereby requested for the project described
below, which we plan to initiate on 1 June 1949. In view of
the comment contained in paragraph 2 of referenced communi-
cation, we are assuming that commencement of this project on
a simple exploratory basis has already been approved by head-
quarters. No further commitments, other than those descriced
below, will be made.
4. Objectives
INDEX
APR 1947
ST-26
(1) Cutout services, as suggested by headquarters,
in an effort to test Subject's abilities.
(2) As a basic and continuing assignment to permit
and enccurage development of Subject's best
local contacts as well as in the hope of filling
a long-felt need in cur operational pattern, he
will be assigned to the general topic of labor;
specifically, communist penetration of local
non-communist labor groups and theoretical
developments which are of interest regardless
of group designation.
(3) Subject appears to be genuinely interested and
to possess an unusual appreciation for cperational
ways and means, which is seldom encountered.
For this reason, none of his assignments will
be exclusive, and he will be encouraged to follow
up such leads and opportunities as arise in the
course of his daily occupations regardless of
any objective and target assignments.

B. Targets
:
(1) Subject will commence by serving as cutout for
Hurger, who has always held out great promise but
never been properly developed or directed.
(2) In the labor field, the principal and only target
Lat the moment is the only labor federation, the
Rerum Kovarum.
(3) Subject will represent our only contact among the
student groups and certain allied "intellectual"
societies. Any activity in this category showing
promise may subsequently become an assigned target.
C. Cryptonym and Essential Data on Personnel
The designation "Hydropathic", heretofore applied to
subject individual, is hereby discarded. He will
hereafter be designated by San Jose Station Symbol
No. 26. For essential data on personnel, see TZP-A-365,
Part I and II.
D. Control and Contact
Judging by Subject's background data and his already
demonstrated cooperative attitude, we do not feel that
control and direction of his activities will be any
problem. Contact, owing to the nature of this project,
will be frequent and carried out in any convenient
manner, generally in one or the other of our respective
homes.
E. Cover
Subject had planned to and has established himself in
Costa Rica for entirely personal reasons, prior to any
contact with this office. He has a Costa Rican wife,
attends the university, and lives a perfectly normal
life which any assignments from us will net disrupt.
Our only anticipated problem is that of mutine contacts
between Subject and the Chief of Station. That matter
will be handled with care and discretion.
F. Cost
DESENSITIZED
For CC 13-23
Subject has agreed to serve for a salary equivalent to
$50.00 per month, to be paid in colones. To offset
this expense we plan to dispense with the services of
Hucklebone who is presently receiving $400.00 per month.

G. Timing and other Factors
Our preliminary interviews with Subject lead us to
believe that he will be the interested and relia ble
American cutout for which this station has long felt
a need. His greatest virtue in this respect appears
to be an understanding of operational methods and an
appreciation of relative values with respect to infor-
mation. It is hoped to make this a permanent project,
but our plans and our arrangements with Subject are
considered to be probationary, dependent entirely
upon his development and future usefulness.

1. The subject of TZP-A-365 Part I is HIDROPATHIC.
2. Subject is best qualified to serve as a cutout in hardling informants. He

As a result of the recent meeting between Elmer C. LERCER and Grover J.
WARIKO, Subject has been recruited for the specific task of acting as a
cutout in handling HYDE CCYST I, who can be handled more profitabl if
trasferred to the control of CEP's station. Subject to Home Office
approval, no definite commitments have been rade in this case.
3. Subject has a working knowledge of the following subjects:
a. Protocol
b. Liaison acthods pertaining to intelligence in
Latin American countries and inter-departmental
liaison within our own government.
c. Cornurications systems. Subject transmits and
receives about 12 - 16 words per minute in Lorse
code.
Ande
d. The political structure of Latin American governments.

e. Subversive potential and leading subversive personali-
ties of most Latin American countries.
f. Subject is trained in the use of Srearts, jungle war-
fare, and has studied and worked with mars and charts,
and is acquainted with surveilance and evasion pro-
cedures.
g. His primary activity after his arrival in the new area
ray of itself be useful. over, it is doubtful if
this man will be able to devote any large portion of
his tize to our work until such time as he is thoroughly
oriented.
4. Subject is best qualified to procure information in Latin American coun-
tries, particularly Panama and Costa Rica.
LAVIER OF CETATICH
5. After he has established hirself, Subject is interested in traveling in
Argentina, Chile and brazil.
6. He is willing to travel for us and subject to Home Office approval, it is
planned to introduce HYDROPATHIC to HIDROCYS? who will, in turn, introduce
HYDROPATHIC to HIDEOUEST I and, if approved, to HYDROCEST II. For the sake
of cover, this is to be done on the basis that HYDACCYST and HYCΗΟΡΑΤΕΙΟ are
lodge brothers. HIEROPATHIC will join that organization in order to build
up the cover. (Paragraph 3, TZF-2-565 Part I).
7. The number of people that will work for Subject is undetermined. Tenta-
tively we have in mind HILOCYST I and FILECOIST II and, if he recruits
then, the subjects underlined in red in Paragraph 15 of TZP-A-365 Fart I.
It might be well to start collecting biograrhic data on the latter three
individuals at this time.
8. Subject is employed by another agency, but that employment will be terminated
in the near future.
9. Subject has been recruited on an Embassy Intelligence Officer basis. It is
possible that he knows the ultimate destination of any information he may
submit.
10. As presently planned, HYDROCYST and FYEPOPATHIC will be acquainted with each
other. The turnover could be effected without these agents meeting, but
then it would be more difficult to build up the lodge cover story. It would
even be possible for HYDROPATHIC to communicate with RCCYST since toth
have a knowledge of Horse Coce. However, it is believed that future infor-
cation from HYLACCES? I will not have its primary value in this area.
11. Subject will be briefed to communicate by letter-drop. Here again, a lodge
connection night be used as this is the present system which HIDROCYST I
employs in forwarding communications to HYLEOCYST.
فه
12. Subject will be briefed to report in writing and to require his sub-agents
to do so wherever possible.

P-A-765 Part II
13. Subject cannot be expected to devote any major portion of his time to
our work: until he has built up his cover and is oriented in his new
surroundings. Athough Auent in the lanmuare, he will probably en-
counter a good deal of new terminolog.
14. Subject has entered into a tentative oral contract to perform services
for us for a salary of $50.00 per month. This can be rade into a written
contract at any tire.
15. Subject's tentative continuing project is outlined in paragraph 2 above.
16. Subject should be capable of initiating his om projects.
PAYEENT
17. Starting in February 1949, it will be necessary to pay subject $50.00 11.S.
dollars per ronth as indicated in paragraph 14 above.
18. Subject has been told that if his services prove satisfactory, he can ex-
pect an increase in salary. No specific amount was discussed.
19. It is contemplated that this station may be required to pay certain travel
expenses for Subject. If done, this will be charged against Project
Development.
20. No cost of purchase of information is involved at this time.
21. Subject's superiors regard this ran as highly dependable. He has had con-
siderable experience in writing reports and has remarked that his two
principal criticisms of intelligence reporting as he has observed it in
this area is that the reporting is inclined to be sensational rather than
factual and that cost people have nothing to report other than that which
the opposition is willing that they receive. He should have a fair con-.
cept of security. However, general security in this area is very lax and
he ray have subconscious bad habits.
22. In view of his background, Subject should only be good in semi-covert work.
23. If this man is kept under cover he wight eventually effect a penetration of
scholastic or parlor-pink circles. It is presumed that this would be on
a low level.
24. This individual could easily be recruited for a full-time job with our organi-
zation. Forever, it is believed that core is to be gained by starting him
off in this manner, perhaps giving hin periodic schooling and gradually in-
creasing his activities and responsibilities.
