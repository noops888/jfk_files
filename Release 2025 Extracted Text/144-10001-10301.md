Very Urgent

The police department informed us that a group of ultra

rightists were organizing a meeting and demonstration at this

embassy to deliver a so called "Note of Protest" to Cuba

accusing the Cuban Revolution of instigating the assassination

of KENNEDY.

They likewise placed [B val armored cars] to prevent

attack and a police guard at the residence and the chancery.

We stated that we would not permit entrance to the embassy

to any representative of the reactionaries, nor accept any noPaCE(s)

since Cuba estimates, and it is so evident, that the

assassination was perpetrated by ultrarightist and reactionary

intellectuals. This was transmitted by telephone to the Protocol

Directorate of the Japanese Foreign Ministry.

The demonstration has dispersed now with a possibility of

returning, since they want to deliver the note in any case.

We are keeping posted and and will inform you of events. ((A))
