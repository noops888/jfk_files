city of Philadelphia to haul trash and garbage from Philadelphia

via water.

On October 15, 1959, Philadelphia Confidential

Informant T-3 said that ANGELO BRUNO met on the evening of

to discuss.

Philadelphia for removal of trash.

T-3 said that BRUNO

had indicated that the land purchased, described below,

was about to be concluded and that POLLINAwho made the down

payment on the land was not DOMENICK POLLINA, Philadelphia

Top Hoodlum.

I-3 did not know if this POLLINA was the

relative of DOMENICK POLLINA.

On October 7, 1959, U. S. Game Management Agent

in New Jersey HARRYCE. GREENWALD advised SA IRVING R. DEAN

that an- 800 plus acre plot of land on the south side of

Mad Horse Creek in Salem County, N.J. was owned by RIESS

EWEN of Salem, N.J.

This land was

said to be surrounded

by a 2500 acre plot owned by THOMAS DICKSON, Clerk of the

County Court of Salem,

N.J. who is fighting

the sale of

the 800 acres owned by EWEN to one (FNU) POLLINA, described

as a South Philadelphian who had made a down payment of

$3500 toward a purchase price of $75.00 per acre for EWEN's

acreage.

It was said that the state

of New Jersey had

offered

EWEN $35.00 an acreffor his land as a proposed

public shooting grounds for wild ducks.

GREENWALD also said that the Salem, N.J. City

Council unanimously opposed the sale of EWEN's acreage

when it became known that the acreage was intended for a

garbage disposal area. Two weeks after this action, however,

it is alleged that the entire City Council of Salem, N.J.

reversed its decision and voted fort the sale of EWEN's

property, knowing that it was to be used as a garbage

disposal area.

The property was described as being only

accessible by water and that the only obstacle holding up

the sale of the land at the present time is the riparian

at the

rights to the land which is now in the process of litigation.

On October 19, 1959, GREENWALD advised SA DEAN

that THOMAS DICKSON,

described above, was contacted by an

individual, presumably a JOHN POLLINA, in an endeavor to

purchase his 2500 acre plot in Salem, N.J.

GREENWALD

allegedly was told by DICKSON that it was

demanded that

he set a price for his land and that DICKSON would be

contacted Wednesday evening, October 21, 1959, for his

answer.

GREENWALD said that DICKSON had called him and

related this information.

DICKSON was said to be extremely

worried over what may

happen to him or his family if he

does not sell the land.

By letter October 26, 1959, the Newark Division

advised that THOMAS PANCOAST DICKSON on October 20; 1959,

was interviewed by sa. ROBERT D. ALDRICH and advised as

follows :

DICKSON did not know other than from rumor who

was involved in the sale of land to the land adjoining

his property for the purpose of using it as a garbage

disposal area.

He had been approached to sell his land

by CHARLES ACTON, Swedesboro, N.J., a real estate dealer.

No threats were made to him but ACTON told him that the

people he represented

"had to have the land" and for him

to name his price and they would buy.

DICKSON has heard from sources unrecalled that

the POLLINAs were the persons behind the project but he

observed that there appeared to be a great deal of political

pressure coming from the State of New Jersey regarding the

matter. It appeared that the state wanted to use Salem

County as a dump ground for the whole state since dumping

on the North Jersey meadows has been stopped.

A. W. W. HOWELL, Box 459, Parsippany, N.J.: told

DICKSON that the state of New Jersey had made an official

investigation concerning the matter so he, DICKSON,

called a Detective Sergeant EMIL DALINT of the New Jersey

State Police at West Trenton,

J., who admitted.to.nim

chat such an investigation had been made and a file

existed but that he preferred that DICKSON talk to his

superior, Deputy Attorney General JOHN J.

BURGIN for any

official

information. DICKSON did not proceed further.

- 6 -

NW 78318 Docld:34489331 Page 11

## Page 12

PH 92-444

DICKSON said that local meetings have been held in

Salem in an effort to get an ordinance passed forbidding

any such dumping and an official of the City Health Department,

one JOHN ZEMHAMPSKI (phonetic) has appeared

and argued

strongly against passage of such restrictions.

In DICKSON'S

opinion this man had no business at such a meeting. DICKSON

said there had been many rumors around Salem concerning large

payoffs to New Jersey state officials but DICKSON cannot

substantiate any of these.

DICKSON said he would attempt

to cooperate with the FBI in every way should threats be made

to him as he definitely did not intend to sell his land for

a dump.

I'-3 on October 9, 1959, said that BRUNO had stated

that they were then ready to purchase land at salem, N.J.

but BRUNO furnished no additional information. It was also

said that BRUNO stated that all of

• the City Councilmen in

Philadelphia were going to get a

"cut" from this business

venture.

Councilmen SAMUEL ROSE and PAUL D'ORTONA were said

to be the most active in the proposed business venture.

It

was said that Chief Magistrate JOSEPH HERSCH had a definite.

interest in the matter.

HERSCH was a close, personal friend of

T-3 said

that the land in Salem, N.J. had been

purchased with a $20,000 down payment and had a $47,000

balance remaining.

It was said that the agreed price would

be $2.65 per ton for removal of garbage from the city.

MICKEY ROSE, a relative of Councilman SAMUEL ROSE, will be

the Iront for the group.

Itiis noted that i has previously

been reported

that the investment in this venture will be

approximately $400,000.

G. TRAVEL

on October 20, 1959, Lieutenant TOM CLOONEY,

Philadelphia Police Department, advised SA THOMAS F. CARRIG

that ANGELO BRUNO had been observed by him driving a grey

Pontiac sedan with New Jersey registration X/M 9530 J.

reversed its decision and voted for, the sale of WEN's

property, knowing that 1t was to be used an a garbage.

disposal

The property was described as being only

accessible by water and that the only obstacle holding up

the sale of the land at the present time 1s the riparian

GREENWALD advised SA DEAN

that THOMAS DICKSON, described above, was contacted by an

individual, presumably & JOHN POLLINA, in an endeavor to

purchase his 2500 acre plot in Salem, N.J.

GREENWALD

allegedly was told by DICKSON that It was

demanded that

he set a

price for his land and that DICKSON would be

contacted Wednesday evening, October 21, 1959, for his

answer,

GREENWALD said that DICKSON had called him and

related this information.

DICKSON was said to be extremely

worried over what may happen to him or his family if he

does not sell the land.

By letter October 26, 1959, the Newark Division

advised that. THOMAS PANCOAST DICKSON

on October 20, 1959,

was interviewed by SA

ROBERT D. ALDRICH and advised as

follows:

DICKSON did not know other than from rumor who

was involved in the sale of land to the land adjoining

his property for the purpose of using it as a garbage

disposal area.

He had been approached to sell his land

by CHARLES ACTON, Swedesboro, N.J., a real estate dealer.

No threats were made to him but ACTON told him that the

people he represented

"had to have the land" and for him

to name his price and they would buy.

DICKSON has heard from sources unrecalled that

the POLLINAs were the persons behind the project but he

observed that there appeared to be a great deal of political

pressure coming from the state of New Jersey regarains the

matter. It appeared that the state wanted to use Salem

County as a dump ground for the whole state since dumping

on the North Jersey meadows has been stopped.

A.

W. W. HOWELL, Box 459, Parsippany, N.J., told

DICKSON that the state of

New Jersey had made an off101al

investigation concerning the matter so he, DICKSON,

called a Detective Sergeant EMIL DALINT of the New

Jersey

State Police at West Trenton, N.J., Who admittedro hin

that such an investigation had

been made and a 1ile

existed but that he preferred that DICKSON talk to his

Deputy Attorney General JOHN J. BURGIN for any

official

supfeaT Intormation. DICKsON did not proceed further.

DICKSON said that local meetings have been held in

Salem in an effort to get an ordinance passed forbidding

any such dumping and an offloial of the City Health Department,

one JOHN ZEMHAWPSKI (phonetio) has appeared and argued

strongly againat passage of such restrictions.

In DICKSON's

opinion this man had no business at such a meeting. DICKSON

said there had been many rumors around Salem concerning large

peyoffs to New Jersey state offloials but DICKSON cannot

substantiate any of these. DICKSON said he would attempt

to cooperate with the FBI

in every way should threats be made

to him as he definitely did not intend to sell his land for

a dump.
