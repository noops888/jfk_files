The MRR, an underground movement formed in Cuba in mid-1959,

was composed primarily of three larger groups:

(1) the ACU, under

Manuel F. Artime Buesa; (2) a military group under Major Ricardo

de la Lorie Valls; and (3) an air group, without planes, of 13

experienced pilots under Major Antonio Michel Yabor.

The ACU was in

existence prior to the Castro regime as the Cuban Catholic University

(CACU) studente organization. In November: 1959, under Artime's

leadership, the majority of the CACU membership joined with the

Rebel Army Officer group to become the MRR. In February, 1950, a

coordinated movement of anti-Castro exiles outside Cuba was formed

in Mexico and named the MRR.

Artime and Lorie were joint heads of

this newly formed group. About the middle of 1960, Artime, who was

in the US, reportedly began to act without authority from the MRR

Directorate, which resulted in formation of the MRR splinter group,

As a result of nationwide press, radio, and television

coverage of President Kennedy's 12/29/62 activities at the Orange

now was better known and his position in the anti-Fidel Castro

movement was greatly increased. Generally among Cuban exiles Artime

was considered young, immature, and highly ambitious,

tractor exchange deal were the three leaders of the invasion -

The

Cuban Government proposed the exchange of Artime for Francisco

second-degree murder in NYC.

However, this proposed exchange failed
