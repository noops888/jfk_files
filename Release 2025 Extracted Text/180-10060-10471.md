: STAFF PAYROLL RECORDS

December 8, 1995

Status of Document:

Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 7

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors

including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United

States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 4

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could

reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of

privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

Memorandum

To: G. Robert Blakey, Chief Counsel and Staff Director

From: Robin Lindley

Date: November 24, 1978

Re: Request for Salary Increase

12-4.08

I would greatly appreciate a wage increase. As you are aware, my

responsibilities with the Committee have changed dramatically in the past

few months. Not only have. I assisted with ad hoc writing projects such

as narrations and staff reports that have been used in public session

one rate xopose that

hearings, but I am also responsible for writing and editing a substan-

tial part of the final report of the King

Task Force.

My background uniquely complements my present duties with the editori-

al staff. In support of this salary request, it may be useful to reac-

quaint you with mỳ experience. Following my graduation from the Univer-

sity of Washington School of Law in 1974, I worked for two years as a

full-time Instructor of Law. In that capacity, I taught a legal research,

writing, and analysis course, and had the opportunity to critically examine

hundreds of pieces of student work. I also developed a seminar in writing

about law for persons without a legal background, an effort to encourage

students to humanize and demystify their own legal writing, as well as

review possible examples of this sort of writing, such as legal journalism.

In addition, I am familiar with historicäl research and writing. I received

my Bachelor of Arts degree in history (with distinction), with an em-

phasis in United States and modern European history, and while attending

law school, I organized and taught a course concerning the role of vio-

lence in American history that was presented in the Department of General

and Interdisciplinary Studies at the University of Washington.

I have worked diligently for this Committee since October 1977. As a

research attorney, I did my best to research issues thoroughly and accurate-

1y, to analyze and cogently synthesize relevant material, and to present

the fruits of my efforts in a clear and concise manner. I also endeavored

to see that this information was used effectively in connection with the

King investigation, despite some obstacles posed by staff regimentation.

Furthermore, I have acted as a de facto staff counsel, notably with the

King investigation in England, as well as in the day-to-day dealings with

agencies and witnesses.

Consequently, based upon my work with the Committee and my unique

experience, I submit this request for a salary increase.

Specifically,

I ask that my wages be raised from the present level of $18,000 per

year to $24,000 per year.

I look forward to my continued work with Dick and the other members

of the editorial staff. "I find my duties gratifying, at times exhilarating,

and always challenging, and I do believe that I am uniquely qualified to

make a significant contribution to our final report.

Thank you for your kind consideration. I would greatly appreciate a

reply to this request.
