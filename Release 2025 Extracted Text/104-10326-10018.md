IS MADE DIFFICULT BY THE FACT THAT STATE COVER IS

SO WIDELY

DISCUSSED IN THE PUBLIC MEDIA INCLUDING THE MANY BOOKS AUTHORED

FORMER CIA EMPLOYEES; HOWEVER, THE USG HAS NEVER OFFICIALLY

RELEASED THE FACT OF STATE COVER. ALTHOUGH THE ISSUE WAS BRIEFED

IN DEPTH,

THE BOARD HAS REQUESTED ADDITIONAL CONCRETE DAMAGE

ISSUE--MOSCOW, PARIS, MEXICO CITY AND BUENOS AIRES.

ACCORDINGLY,

WE NEED YOUR SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT OF THE

DAMAGE THAT COULD ARISE IF OFFICIAL USG DOCUMENTS WERE RELEASED
