SUBJECT:

March 8 and 9, 1963 Meeting of the President's

Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board

The Board meeting of March 8 convened at 10:00 a.m.,

with

the following in attendance: Mesors. Killian, Baker, ClatTora,

Doolittle, Gray, Land, Langer, Ash ana coyne•

Mr. Pace was

unable to attend the two-day meeting because of absence from.

the country; Mr. Murphy was unable to join the meeting until

later in the day.)

As the first order of business, in executive session, the

Chairman reported on a number of Items Including the following,

The Chairman advised that on the previous day Mr. Murphy

had Informed Mr. Coyne that, he had received a telephone call at:

his offices in New York fron the Director of Central Intelligence.

Mr. McCone Indicated to Mr. Murphy that the President had talked

with him about the Board's final report on the Cuba situation

dated February 4; that the President had shown Mr. McCone a copy

of the report, indicating that no other distribution was being.

made of the report at this time.

Mr. Murphy advised that Mr. McCone

was quite emotional in discussing the Board's report, stating that

1f the Board 1s going to insist on submitting the report, the top

five people in CIA, including Mr. McCone, would have to resign

from the Agency. Mr. Murphy pointed out

to Mr. McCone that the

report had already been formally submitted to the President by the

Board.

ir. McCone then expressed to Mr. Murphy his concern and :

disagreement with the references in the report. to the fallure of

Intelligence. Mr. Murphy advised Mr. McCone that in his judgment,

and indeed he thought in the judgment of all of the Board members,

there was In fact a fallure of Intelligence and It was the duty of

the Board to so state in its report to the President.

Mr. Murphy

expressed the view that the report was really mild.

Mr. McCone

Indicated that even in retrospect there were only about seven of

the thirty-five indicators listed in the report of offensive mis-

siles in Cuba which might be considered valid. Mr. Murphy reiter-

ated that Mr. McCone was quite emotional in discussing the above

matter, saying 1f the report stood 1t could lead to resignations

from DIA as well as CLAd

At this point e mentioned to Mr. McCone

that he was in New York

at a neeting with others and didn't like

discussing this aspect on the telephone and suggested they discuss

the matter further when they next met.

the DCI said that he was concerned

about the prospects of a future nuclean explosion in Communist China,

and to a lesser degree he was concerneu about the prospects of such

a development in Israel. He thought that the prospects of these

developments brings up a most serious problem from the standpoint

of psychological effect upon other nations should these develop-

ments take place, although there does not seem to be anything we

Insofar as U-2 overflights of Communist China by Chinese

Nationalis pilots are concerned, these missions are being flown

"Category 3" weather (instead of Category 2 weather conditions

involving a maximum of 25% cloud cover) because there is a need for

frequent missions

The DCI sald that although these missions have

not produced evidence of a reactor in operation in Communist China,

there are some indications,

e.ga, a test area in Tibet, and the

President has been alerted to this possibility.

The DCI said that somewhat of a problem is presented in Israel.

Although we are close to the Israeli government, it appears to be

withholding information on the extent of its nuclear activities.

in the past France is assisting Israel and the French government 1s

helping the Israell government build a nuclear reactor at the pre-

sens time.

In a building next to the reactor there is an installa-

tion which could be a chemical separation facility, but the Israelis

deny that this 1s the case. Moreover, the DCI pointed out, the

Israelis refuse to submit to international safeguards prescribed by

the international atomic energy agency.

Mr. McCone stated that he

belleves that the development of a nuclear weapon capability by

Israel would have most serious effects on countries of the Middle

East and, therefore, Mr. McCone Is ready to repeat recommendations

which he previously made to President Eisenhover that unless Israel

Joins in the international safeguards we should take certain econ-

omic reprisals against Israel.

Mr. McCone observed that our govern

ment permits tax deductions on Israeli bonds, and we have given Israel

billions of dollars in ald. Despite this the Israelis could well be

proceeding without full knowledge on our part, on an atomic energy

program which could trigger grave trouble in the Middle East.

Finally, Mr. McCone reported that CIA has concluded that our

policy on intelligence collection within the United States is wrong

and particularly as it applies to Soviet Bloc Embassies and to tele-

phone intercept coverage as well as exploitation of official Soviet

Bloc personnel in the United States. Mr. McCone stated that he was

going to propose that the CIA intensify its activities on these

matters or that the FBI be directed to intensify their activities

in these areas.

He noted that basically this is an FBI responsibility

but that it is his own view that this responsibility could more

properly be carried out by the CIA. Mr. Cliflord inquired as to

whether the DCI would not encounter difficulty In trying to get

this function transferred from FBI to CIA; and Mr. McCone responded

that he does not care who carries out the responsibillty as long as

It Is appropriately done and he added that he belleves the CIA 1s::

qualified

to do 1t.

Dr. Land observed that this activity does. not

belong with the FBI; that coverage of an espionage agent is one thing

but that exploiting Soviet Bloc coverage for Intelligence collection

purposes 13 quite another.

Mr. McCone advised that there 1s another dimension to this

problem which Involves Increasing the number of CIA Intelligence

representatives in Moscow. He noted that CIA has only. three em-

ployees in the moscow embassy.

He pointed out that in Washington,

0. C. and New York city out of a total of 392 Soviet official rep-

resentatives ciA has identified 176 as Intelligence officers of the

KGB and GRU, a proportion of 45%. He added that 2360f the Soviet

official representatives in London are intelligence officers and

In France the figure 1s 36%.

Before departing the meeting Mr. McCone displayed to the Fuard

a photograph demonstrating the success of the latest Infrared photog-

raphy taken of terrain from an altitude of 3500 feet.

Dr. Killian asked the DCI 1f the Board could have a copy of the

new draft NRO agreement, and in response to this the DCI made a

copy of the draft avallable later on in the day.

Before Mr. McCone

left the meeting he suggested that if the Board had any questions

regarding the terms of the draft NRO agreement It would be appropri-

ate to raise them with the Secretary of Defense or Mr. Ailpatric or

Mr. McCone himself, rather than raising such questions at working

levels at the Defense Department or the CIA.

The DCI sald that he

did not want to inhibit in any way the discussions that the Board

might want to have at any level at any time, and he noted that

Dr. Land was to confer with Secretary Gilpatric the following day.

Dr. Land assured the Del that the scheduled meeting was to be con-

fined strictly to a technical discussion.)

This concluded the DCI's meeting with the Board and he and

Mr. Kirkpatrick departed the meeting at 12:30 p.m.

Mr. Arthur Lundahl of the NPIC, and Mr. W1111am

Tidvell Joined the Board meeting. (Before beginning their presen-

tations, Mr. Lundahl answered a question from a Board member by

stating that the NPIC moved into its new quarters at the Naval Gun

Factory on January 1, 1963, and it occuples the entire facility

except for the occupancy of a part of one floor by the U. s. Geo

logical Survey.) Mr.

Tidwell proceeded to give the Board a briefing

on the Internal situation in Cuba. In essence Mr. Tidwell said that

Cuba 1s a good example of Latin American Communism In action. The

Castro regime has established very good security, but the internal

political situation 1s considerably messed up in a controversy

between the Castroites and the old-line members of the Communist

Party of Cuba.

soviets will have to provide further substantial ald. Although

the rationing program is difficult to enforce in cuba, the people

have by no means reached a starvation level.

most of the imports into the island, and non-Bloc shipping 1s neg-:

Because of the

efficlency of the Castro Internal security

program, any significant organized revolt efforts have been pre-

Subject.: Board Meeting with the President, Marun 9, 1963

At 10:00 A.M., on March 9, 1963;

the Board met with the

Cabinet Room of the

white House for the

purpose of presenting the Board's report and recommendations

growing out of Its completed review of the foreign intel

ligence aspects of the Soviet military bu1ld-up In Cuba.

Those present were Messrs. Killian, Doolittle, Land, Langer,:

Gray, Clifford, Baker, Murphy, and Messr3. Coyne and Ash.

Mr.. MeGeorge Bundy was also present.

Killian informed the President that the Board had

recommendations to present based on the cuba episode.

recalled to the President that the Board had submitted. two

previous reports, one - an interim report dated December 28,

1962, containing

recommendations of such urgency that the

Board forwarded them prior to completing 1ts revier of Cuba;

and a more comprehensive report dated February 4, 1903, In

wnich the Board set forth its complete findings based on a

detailed investigation of the Cuba situation from the stand-

point of foreign intelligence coverage. Dr. Killian said

that the recommendations which the Board was now presenting

should be considered in the light of the two previous reports,

particularly the report dated February 4, 1963.

Dr. Killian then presented the Board's recommendations,

reading from the written report which was forwarded to the

President under date of March 8, 1963. In reading this report

to the President, Dr. Killian directed attention to the fact

that most of the recommendations which were being presented

were an outgrowth of the Board's study of Cuba, but that two

the recommendations dealt with major problems affecting

the over-all foreign intelligence effort.

Dr. Killian stated Fecommendations 1 thr. an 4 of the

March 8, 1963 report.

Following Dr. Killian'a statement of Recommendation 4

regarding low-level aerial surveillance, flights over Cuba,

the president observed that such flights had not been suspended

but were being reserved for coverage of particularly critical

Intelligence targets should the situation warrant, as, for

example, the February 9, 1963 low-level mission.

Mr. Bundy

commented that two or three important targets in Cuba have

been identifled since the February 9 low-level mission, but

the approval of low level coverage of these new targets is

being held in abeyance pending the completion of efforts by

Attorney Donovan to obtain the release of some twenty Amert-

cans held prisoner In Cuba, Including thres Individuals whom

the UnIted States Is particularly destro. of returning to

this country..:.

The President asked for elaboration on the

recommendation for the development of long focal

length cameras to be used in U-2 aircraft.

Dr. Land explained

that some time ago an effort was made to develop such a camera

but the earlier version was not a success,

and the development

efforts were suspended because there was not an Immediate.

posals for and the monitoring of unique intelligence operations,

tion 12 on the need for Improving national intelligence aya.

estimates, Mr. Bundy reiterated the point which the Board had

made to the effect that the present system for producing

national intelligence estimates 1s being run by the originators

of the system, and the present mechanism for producing such

estimates is a

"founders body." Dr. Langer said 1t 19 true

thai the estimative group has a highly trained staff which has

been in existence for many years, but the Board has not yet

conducted a specific study of its operations.

Dr. KIllian

summarized the tenor of this recommendation of the Board by

saying that a monolithic point of view is not necessarily the

best estimate.

the National Reconnaissance Office.

Following Dr. Killian's presentation, the President

expressed his appreciation for the Board's efforts and said

that he would follow through on the recommendations which

had been made.

Referring to the thirty-five intelligence reports.con-

taining indicator-type data which were dealt with In the

Board's February 4 report, the

The President observed that

first there was the Berlin Wall Incident and then the Cuba

development, and in retrospect the President found It extra-

ordinary that our Government had not obtained more advance

information with respect to those situations.

The President said that we should have accomplished

1n the Cuban Government.

Dr. Land stated that he and Dr. Langer had been engaged

in which our national intelligence estimates are produced.

Dr. Land thought that, under the present system, it seemed

Land said, that the chA see if there 1s

minded, but whose careers are devoted to fitting Intelligence

information into all possisle patterns. In the Cuba situation,

Dr. Land pointed out, there was a fixed pattern in the minds

of estimators to the effect that refugee reports concerning

offensive missiles were in reality reports concerning surface-

to-air missiles and installations. Dr. Land said that the

Board was not proposing a policy under which the President

would review raw intelligence reports, hut the Board felt

that the estimators should form the various alternative

patterns which can be relably derived from an analys1s. of

intelligence, in order that policy makers may have the benefit

of such niternatives. Dr Langer said that on the other hand

the estimators have to action rationality and cannot assume

that the enemy 1s acting on an irrational basis.

The President said that looking back on the Cuba situa-

tion 1t 1g now apparent that the SAM sites were related to

the deployment of offensive missiles.

The President observed

that there has not been made, to his knowledge, an analysis

the assumption under which the Soviety operated In Cuba,

and it would be of some academic interest, it least, to know

why the soviets did not use their SA-2's

against our over-

flight operations. Dr. Land observed that it the soviet

camouflage teams in Cuoa had been up to schedule along with

the Soviet schedule for deployment of offensive missiles,

we would not have round the missiles, and it was by the grace

of God that we did fina them.

Mr. Clifford, referring to earlier references to the

need for clandestine agent penetration of Cuba,

said that the

Board had concluded that the absence of clandestine coverage

1s attributable to a lack of Imagination on the part uf our

intelligence elements over a long period of years during which

we enjoyed close relations with the Cuban Government.

fore, Mr. Clifford said, the Board 18 concerned about the

adequacy

of such coverage at the present time in places 11ke

Brazil and Argentina.

Mr. Murphy observed that originally the

cIA set out to use U. S, dipiomatic establishments as a cover

for CIA intelligence operations only for an initial period,

but these cover arrangements became permanent.

Mr. Murphy

noted that in discussion with the Board the Director of Central

Intelligence has said that 1t 1s difficult to achleve deep

cover for clandestine agent operations, and while Mr. Murphy

agrees that this task 1s of course difficult, he nas seen no

evidence that concerted efforts have been made, for example,

to penetrate the Castro regime.

Mr. Clifford recalled that

on the preceding day Mr. McCone had directed the Board's

attention to the fact that whereasome ClA has three operatives

In Moscow, the Soviet Unton has 153 intelligence officei's in

the United States.

Dr. Killian Informed the President that

the Board lays great stress on the need for a real effort to

Increase our clandestine agent operations.

Referring again to the reports and findings of the Board,

the President said that one problem in reflected ir. the instance

where the Secretary of State had recommended that a particular

U-2 surveillance mission over Cuba be broken up into four over-

flight missions.

The President said he was not suggesting that

this was not a prudent suggestion by the Secretary of State,

but that this made him conscious of the fact that there 1s

perhaps a lack of expertise on the part of policy makers with

respect to certain inteligence operations.

The President

commented that one flight was flown over an area where the

aircraft could well have been shot down.

The President then referred to the fact that Dr. Killan

retiring as Chairman of the Board In May.

The President

expressed deep appreciation for the work which Dr. Killian

has done and the valuable contribution which Dr.

K1llian has

made to the country.

The President recalled that the Board

has conducted three post-mortems on intelligence situations.

and that these efforts of the Board have been most useful,

particularly in the case of Cuba.

The President added tha

he wished to express his appreciation for the effective manner

in which the Board has carried out its dutles in the past.

Me stated that the Board's contribution has been most valuable.

In addition to 1ts being valuable to the President,

the Roard

nas also contributed In an Important way through the awareness

which 1t has created in the intelligence community of 1ts

continuing operations and continuing review of intelligence

activities.

The President said that he was very much indebted

to all of

the Board members and is hopeful that the Board will

continue

present operations for he considered them to be

Invaluable.

Dr. Killian expressed his gratitude lui the Presidentls

comments, and then said that, as a'fostnote to the Board!s.

present report, the members wished to say to the President

that he has a right to expect high quality performance on they

part of the intelligence community, and the Board suggests

that the President see fit to emphasize to the intelligenceston

community the necessity for producing adequate information.

The President then referred to current criticisma and

Inquiries which have been received from various quarters ema

concerning the role of the Government In the Bay of Pigs

Invasion, and the President wondered whether the Board felt

that the

Administration should be more responsive to such ru

criticisms and inquiries. Mr. Murphy commented that we

would be well advised to follow the practice of Prime Minister

Macmillan who responds to such criticism and inquirtee with

a statement to the effect that we do not discuss our intel-

ilgence activities in public.

Di. Killian assured the President that memoers of the

Board feel that to the greatest extent possible the Admints-

tration should refrain from making intelligence disclosures

with respect to the Bay of Pigs incident.

ME. ClIfford thought

that the situation had been summed up humorously and accurately

in a recent statement by Congressman Mahon who questioned

whether the real problem was a lack of intelligence information

on the other hand, a lack of Intelligence on the part of

oF if-appointed critics.

The President stated that he too was

impressed with Congressman Mahon's statement and, in fact,

after the statement appeared in the press, he called Congressman

Mahon and commended bim on its content.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Diroctor of Central Intelligence

SUBJECT:

Interin Report to the Prenident by thin

President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory

Board, dated December 28, 1962

We have set down tho several paragraphs of the subject report followed

by our comments:

The recommendation of the Board. Groat uncertainties about

present soviet efforts in Cuba indicate the necessity of a continuing aggressive

intelligence effort to eguip our policy makers with timely and adequate infor-

mation to meet the possibility of continuing Soviet confrontation in Cuba. We

must resist any tendency : warda a let down in our intelligence eifor! against

Cuba in the wake of intelligench successes resulting from our military re-

connaissance misnions over the island. In making this observation we are

mindful that in a quite differeat atmoophere the Central Inielligence Agency

did not mount effective clandestine intelligence collection operations in Cuba

for an eight-month period following the Bay of Pigs invanion.

Comment.

We agree with the principle stated in the first sentence

of the recommendation and the need to continue an aggreosive intelligence

effort against Cuba. This view was adyanced by the Direcios of Contral

Intelligence at the meeting of the Freaident's Boaid on December 7, 1962 and

again at the meeting of the Board on December 28. The DCI Informed the

Board at thess meetings that it was Important that there be extensive intelli

gence opexations to find out the trend of uevelopmente in Cuba and that efforts

to get agents into Cuba were boing intensified. It should be noted, however.

that in clandestine intelligence operations the allocation of additional manpower

and funds to a task, although heipful, does not neccusarily, assure a corre-

sponding improvement in production or accomplishment.

Since early 1962 the ClA has increased its elfort to collect intelli-

gence information on Cuba. The operations for this purpose hay been

the Bay of Pigs, there was a decroaso in the clandestine effort againut Cuba.

Even 90, from April 15, 1961 through December 1961 the Clandestine

Services of CIA dissominated 608 information reports on Cuba,

of which 406 reporto camo from sourceo inalde Cuba. The Contact Livision/00

of ClA dissominated 1764 reports on Ciba during the period April 8 t) December

1961. During the porlod from April 1961 through December 1961, seventeen

difficutt one for the Agency.

The Taylor Committee, composed of General

Taylor, the Attorney Goneral, Nir. Allen Dulles, and Admiral Burke, began

its survey of the Bay of Pigs operation on April 22 and continued thrcughout

May and June. This Committee took much of the tine and ciort of precisaly

L'commerdation of the Board. We recommend intensified, hurd-

hitting eifort io increase our capability los obtaining significart intelligence

tirougn clandestine collection oporations (espionago). Despite noichorthy

intelligence results obtal nahle through scientific and technical means, we still

have as great a noed as ever for carefully selected, hurnan-resouice espiorage

operationa profensionally executed on the basis of the soundesi planting judgments

und the most competent target selection processes which the intelligence com-

munity can achieve.

The Cuban experience is a case in point, for wa nou have

faw meaningful espionage acts on the loland and without such asets e have

little hope of developing the kind and dogree of hard intelligence which is roquired

on such criticai marters an: a) the plans and intentions of ibe Soret Governnent

and the Castro regime for fuiure operations within Cuba or for future operations

launched from Cuba against other Latin American countrica; b) the alleged con-

calment of offensive weapons in caves or other locations which arc incapable of

being probed by technical intelligence mcano; and o) the actual numbers of Soviet

troops in Cuba, their precise deploymento, equipments, activities and objectives.

in numorous countries our serious lack of clandestine ageni resources

is compounded by beavy relianco on the use of official cover as a clair for our

Intelligence-gathering activities abroad. Again, Cuba proides animportant

lennon. When the ripture of diplomatic relationg in January 1961 forced the

intelligence activitica.

These advisory groups, which incidentally included

some of the membors of your present Board, have made specific rerommen-

dations on the subject. In 1954 the Doolittls Committee emphasized the need

for: a) developing nonofficial cover facilities; b) the placement of "dcop-cover

sleeper: agents" with à corresponding decrcase in dependenco upon official

i over; c) the crostion of a long-range, decp-cover planning system; and d) the

promulgation di cover doctrino and procedure. In 1955 the Technological

that "we should today bo laying the groundwork for extensive covert operations

in every country available to our agents", recommended that "a heary long-

torma investment should be made in the preparation of covert agents as eventual

sources of high-level intelligence." More recently, in ita report of July 2,

1961, your Board recommended that the new Director of Central Intelligence

consider the denirability und means of achleving a deeper cover for all

clandestine and coveri activities of the Central Intelligence Agency, and that

the disproportionaie number of ClA peroonnel operating under diplomatic

cover be reduced on an orderly basis, having in mind their replacenient by

agents under deep cover.

Comment. We agree with the principle of intonatijing hard-hitting

efforts to Increase the production of significant intelligonce information through

esplonage. This we will continue to do on a worldwide basis within the limits

of our resources. We strongly support the principle expressed in the second

sentence above. We agree that it is imporiant for those responsible for the

collection of intelligence information to bear in mind that there is much sorely

needed information that cannot be collected by scientific and technical means.

Such information is often in the human mind or the written word, Frequently

information collected by scientific and technical means mit be supplemented

by information derived from buman sources to interpret it or to give it true

significance. As Mi. Helme inforinod the Board on December 7, 1962, there

is an impressive illustration of this interplay of information from technical

and human sources in the identification of missilos and their sites in Cuba.

Material derived fron classic eapionage played a vital role in the community's

analysis of Soviet migaile activitien in Cuba last October. Specifically, Soviet

TOP SECRET documents acquired by a CIA agent concorning the preparation

cf R-12 MRaM's for launching, and the layout of nites for such missiles,

provided the primary basis for evaluating the degree of complation and the

state of readiness of the MRBM's in Cuba. These reporto ales complemented

photo intelligence by providing organizational facto on R-12 units, ana

We will never be satiofied that we have a sufficient nuraber of

decreaso in official cover an tha solution to mary of the problems of clas-

destine activity in foreiga areas.

Nonofficial covor as used in this sonso

means an arragement which provides a plausible reason for the American

reprosontutive being in the foreign area in a capacity otber than as a repre-

sontativo of the Government of the United States. The repetitive advocacy of

more nonofficial covor and less official cover is usually for roasons other

than the suporiority of nonofficial cover in the clandestine collection of

intelligence information.

We realise that there aro other important consider-

ations which make it undesirable to have a disproportionate number of intall -

gence operatives under diplomatic and consular cover.

We contend, however,

that only under propor and special conditions is nonofficial cover superior to

official cover in the clandestine gathering of information. By and large

official cover in more productive. The question of establishing and maintaining

under viable doep cover, sourcos of information who can survive and report

through clandestino channels is quite another matter and really has littio to

do with whether our American intelligenco officers are under official or non-

official cover. These deep cover sources muat be of foreign nationality, at

loast appoar to ba so, to operato effectively in a country hostilo to the United

States and ospocially in a polico stato after diplomatic relations bavn been

broken. But the recruitment of such sources and their organization can

sually be done more effectively by American representatives under official

cover than by Americans under nonofficial cover. Had all the ClA ropro-

sentatives in Cuba at the time diplomatic relations were gevored in i 961 been

there under nonoificial cover they would probably have been able to remain

only a shoit time longer than our ropresentatives under official cover and

those who did remain could not have operated effectively under the sarveillance

that would have undoubtedly been placed on them. We do agree, of course,

that seloctively we should make an effort to lay the groundwork for deep cover,

clandestine operation that can survive a break in diplomatic relationa and

other cilses.

It in in order to consider briefly the nature, advantaged and limi-

tations of nonofficial cover. It is to be noted first and foremost that the CLA

as a matter of avowed policy, in committed to the uno of sonofficial cover in

all inutances, whore it is availablo and ite use in justified. In many areas of

the world, however, nonofficial cover does not exist or, if it does, it exista

under such circumstances as to bave little use for the conduct of espionage.

This is true of the denied areas, moro particularly tho Bloc countring; the

quasi-donied areas such as Iraq and Egypt; and the undur-developed countries,

where thoro are no facilitica of science, commerce and education from which

cover might devolve within tho society. In those areas where nonofficial

cover may provide legality for an agent'o residence in the area and con-

cealmont of his ultimate objectivos, it atill may not givo him accoas to

dosignated targete. Unlens it doos, nonofficial cover la unproductive. Tho

Identification of a target and acceas to it through a viable cover instrumont

Is an ossential combination in the employment of nonoticial covor.

The more tactical operations (particularly in those countries whero

CA presonce is welcome or at least tolerated) are better done by individuals

under official cover. For example, liaison and joint operations are moro

effectively and more cheaply carried on from an official installation than from

a nonofficial one, for the simplo reason that secure files, work space and

communications are readily at band. It la poor economy of manpover and

overscas dollars to conduct this collaborative effort through the usage of the

much more expansive nonofficial cover uniess some clear advantage is gained

thereby,

No sweeping or general conclusion can be applied to a rolationhip

of official cover to nonofficial cover, except in those few places whore thiero

is relatively a free choice betweon the two. But since there are not very many

of those, each country must be considered as a problem in itself. Tbe augmen-

tation of sonofficial cover assets lies in closer examination of the operationl

pooalbilities of nonofficial cover in oach individual station to insure that it ie

employed in instances where it is available and will enable the represontative

to do his job or accomplish his task. We must start with a consideration of

our objoctive in a given area and determine if we can reasonably expect to

reach it through nonoificial cover.

To this end, some months ago the CIA Initiated a worldw.do

planning program, Each station and baso chief was asked to evaluate bis

operations, present and projected, to determino the most efficiont balance

between staff under official cover and staff under nonofficial cover, to bo

achieved, as a target date, five years hence.

Practically all of these plans

nave now beon received in Washington and are in process of Headquarters

ovaluation.

It was clear even befors the planning was undertaken, fbat

certain stations needed soasoned officers under nonofficial cover and that

there was a big void in the category of the officer who, an a young man,

might locate inder nonofficial cover in a given community and spend the

better part of his carear serving both the purposes of his cover and CLA.

During the past year there has been a gratifying improvement on both counts.

Those programs will continue to have high priority and be the subject of

Intonaiva efforto.

As evidenco of our concentration on this important subject we bave

recently establiabed in tho Clandestine Services of ClA a now component, the

Domostic Operations Division and Station (DODS), which will bo reaponsible

for the management of relations between the Agency and private enterpriso

in the United States. In this component has been placed responsibility for the

mardmum utilization of the facilities offored by business, education, foundations,

ete, in furthering and supporting the activition of the Agency. We expect that

the offort of this component will lead to improved nonofficial cover und more

extonsive assistauce by the nonofficial resources of the U. S. In many aspecta

of the Agency's activity.

The bost possibility of attaining intelligence assets after i broak in

diplomatic relations or a hostilo takeovor lies in the creation and maintenanco

of a dormant skelotal network prior thereto, with activation on signal from

witbout at some future date. This plan has actually buen followed in cooper-

stion with local Services in certain European areas and it has proved to be

burdensome and very costly in terms of both manpower and money. CIA does

ant have the capability in addition to its current operationa to create and

radintain this type of staybehine on a vory large scale. This does nut mean

that nothing should be done in those canes where a hostile takoover or a break

in relations appear probable. Efforts to penetrate the communist apparat

and communist cadres should be beavily augmented. Other minority groups

should also be penetrated. Individuals who have not been active in either

espionage or national politica and who might survive tho takeover should be

identifiod, clearod and even approached at a given point in the developing

estuatioo.

All in all, more snould and can be done in those cales.. The

answer to the problem of the survival of networks aftor takoover, homever,

does not lie in the deployment of mora Americans undor nonofficial cover.

In each of the last two years, the Department of State and CLA havo

jointly made a sarching examination of the officer manpower at all poats

An informod current estimato is that the Soviet Union employi

worldwido under official cover mora than 1300 operations officers (known oF

unidentifled),

312). There are about 370 Soviet permanent officials serving

In Now York City and Waahington, D.C. Of these 370 permanent Soviet

"officials", there aro 140 positively identifled intelliganco officers and 33

who aro suspects. In addition, there ars hundreds of Soviets who visit the

United Staton with the U.S. General Assembly or with other Soviet delogatione

and groups. Almost without exception, these groups contain Soviet intelligence

officers under official cover. While the Soviet ofúcial representation in the

U.S, has included 140 individuals known to be engaged in intelligence activities

the ClA has never had more than four on duty in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.

Overseas, the provent total of American operatives under non-

official cover is 1,000, plus or minus, including a hard core of 300 staff agents

and carecr agents. The figure of about 1000 compares with a figure of 550 in

1955, the first year the consolidated figures are available. Perhaps more

significant is the fact that the 'hard core" totals havo risen to 300 from a

total of 200 in 1959. When it comes to the employment of foreign nitionals,

figures aro mucà loss reliablo becauno the reco.ds of socondary agents often

exist only in oporational reports. Howevor, in terman of primary agenta of

foreign nationality on a worldwide basis, tho number i8 on the order of

10, 000.

There has not been a progressive loss of our capability in the field

of clandestine intelligence operations. On the contrary our capability has

increasod. As an example during the last half of 1960, 2514 sources produced

23, 034 positive information reports disseminated by the Clandestine Services

of CLA. During the last half of 1962, 2850 sources produced 22, 256 positive

information reports disseminatod by the Clandestine Services of the CIA.

The smaller number of raports during the second poriod resulted from a

concorted effor: to reduce marginal reporting and encourage sewer but botter

roports.

On the situation in Latin America, the South America Asacosment

Team in its report of January 10, 1962 stated that in general CLA had es-

emphasis on the collection of intelligence information in Latin Amorica during

sites and encryption machines in the ovent that oppostunities for such action

should be provided under circumstances of auccessful internal revolt or

invasion.

Comment. The collection of Signals Intelligenco from wi hia Cuba

han been under way for some time. The most sophisticated of Soviet equip

ments were not identified an being in Cuba until October 28, 1962, ind it has

not yet been possible to identify their precino location, through either electronic

nt agort means. Arrangements are now underway wbich may enable NSA to

provide the Clandestine Sorvices with considerably more accurate a applementary

P/F' results. An airborne D/F "homing" technique will be utilized to attempt

to pinpoint the locationo of tranomitters in otaer than beavily populaled areas.

The first target mission in now scheduled for approdmsely February 1, 1963.

Tinder most favorable conditions, however, it is not anticipated that this effort

would yield position accuracy of better than & kilometer. Further refinement

of such reBulte would be dependent upon a clandestine close-in effort to

determine the exact locations where the devices are being used. There is no

information availablo to ladicate that these installations are 'permanent",

although there is no doubt, as of this date, that they are under complete Soviet

control. Without question, Cubans are not permitted access to the areas in

which the machines are located nor are Cubans being trained in the use of tho

machinos. The identification of the more sopbisticated equipments comes

from Signale Intelligence, and the variety of ageni sources availablo to us in

Cuba has not reported on any aspect of this equipment, indicating that the

Cuban officials themselves with whom cur agonts are in touch are not aware

of the nature of the equipment the Soviets have put into Cuba.

or possible radiation charactoristica. Since it in virtually certain that the

Soviets aro awaro of the existenco i possibly compromising radiations from

cipher equipmento a well as from eloctromochanical printing dovices which

are at timos associated with them, it is not considered likely that a radiation

attact can be accomplished using simple detection devices. Additional

support la lent to thia opinion by the complote absence of Soviet uno of any

enciphoring equipment in any embassy or mission outside the iron curtain.

The only exception in the past has been the use of one or two ciphor equip-

ments by very special VIP parties on Soviet naval vesselo. In the ovent that

the machines do not bavo elecurical circuits, there would be in such case no

radiation or emanations which would be captureable at any distance from the

cantors in which the machines are located. Considorable research is currently

being conducted to overcome the technical difficulties la portability and sensi-

tivity which are inherent in an effort to intercept by means of clandestine

agents emanatione from Soviet equipments.

WASHINGTON

TOP SEGRET

27 Fobruary 1963

MEMORANDUM FOR:

SUBJECT:

Chairman, President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board

Interim Report to the President by the President's

Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, dated

December 28,

1962

At its last meeting the Special Group considered Recommendations 3

and 5 of your Interim Report to the President dated December 28, 1962,

along with comments on these recommerdations from the DCI, CIA,

State and Defense.

The Group agreed with the objectives of Recommendation 3, and it has

under continual review the question of adequate aerial reconnaissánce of

Cuba. With respect to satellite coverage, it appears that within the

reasonably near future the technical characteristics of these vehicles

will make it impossible to cover the intelligence requirements adequately..

Drones are available on a standby basis and could be employed i necessary.

The Group agrees further that on-the-growid photography in Cuba is highly

desirable,

and some clandestine agents wiil be provided with appropriate

equipment. It was recognized, however, that is is a highly risky

endeavor with limited chances of success under existing circumstances:

Recommendation 5 was noted by the Special Group.

The members agreed

completely with the view that unusually risky intelligenc, operations be

referred to the Presidential level for decision whenever there is a serious

need to balance opportunity against risk.

On natters of this kind the Group

frequently refers the decision to the President, and in such cases considers

itself simply as advisory to him. This procedure will continue to be followed.
