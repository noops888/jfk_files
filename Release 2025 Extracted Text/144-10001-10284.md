23 December 1963, the Philippine Ambassador offered His Royal

Highness the good offices of President MACAPAGAL to resolve the

Cambodian-American differences. Out of Cambodia's friendship for

the Philippines, His Royal Highness accepted the good offices offered,

but not mediation, as was reported in the Philippine radio and press.

Conditions: 1) Ambassador YOST, who termed an alleged declara-

tion from the Information Ministry barbarous, withdraw this expression

and apologize to the Royal Government. This condition was not

demanded of the State Department itself, but of Mr. YOST

2) Ambassador SPROUSE must stop his investigation to find out

whether the Royal Government and the Khmer people rejoiced over

the death of President KENNEDY.

--

Therefore, no American Cambodian negotiations are under Philippine

mediation.

The Royal Government was

not aware of the proposal to hold

the negotiations in Manila.
