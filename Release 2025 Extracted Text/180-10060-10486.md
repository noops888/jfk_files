December 8, 1995

Status of Document:

Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 21

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors

including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United

States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 6

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could

reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of

privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

Substitute Language: SSN

Dear Miss Mordana:

Thank you for your letter of October 19, 1976.

Although my schedule is kind of filled at the moment,

I would be able to see you on Monday, November 1, in

my office in Philadelphia at 4:30 P.M. I am sorry to

make it so late in the day. but I have to be in

Washington, Pa. earlier that day; and I am in

Washington, D.C. the rest of this week.

would you be good enough to let my secretary

know whether you will be able to come in for this

appointment. Her name is Miss Shenk.

Sincerely yours.

Richard A. Sprague, Esq.

1622 Locust Street

Phil., Pa. 19103

Dear Mr. Sprague:

I was so intrigued by your selection as Chief Counsel

and Staff Director of the Select Committee on Assassinations

that I had to write to you. I am an extremely bright and

capable graduate of Columbia Law School (May 1976) who hap-

pens to be one of your cousin Ziporah Mordana's daughters,

and one of Debora Horowitz's granddaughters.

I hope you will forgive me for thus invoking kinship.

but I am so eager to work with you that I am tempted to use

any and all reasonable means to help achieve that objective.

"Uncle" Louis heartily agreed that I should acquaint you with

my existence, and gave me your address.

My educational background includes being a Stone Scholar

and "VG" student at Columbia Law School, and a Phi Beta Kappa

at Barnard College (undergraduate division of Columbia Univer-

sity). While in law school, I persuaded the Columbia Graduate

School of Journalism to admit me to some of its professional

workshops. (in reporting, writing, editing, etc.), and completed

half the Master's Program in Journalism.

My professional legal experience has involved a great deal

of litigation practice, from doing research and discovery, to

writing complaints, interrogatories, pre-trial memoranda

and

appellate briefs, in areas ranging from anti-trust to customs

seizures.

My most challenging employment has been with the American

Civil Liberties Union, where I have been working since the

Summer of 1975. In my capacity as law clerk to the Legal Direc-

tor, I was given the responsibility for handling the pre-trial

NW 88326

Docld:32239494 Page 16

## Page 17

litigation (with occasional assistance) of a bipartite class

suit involving domestic intelligence activities-so far suc-

cessfully-and was assigned to work on a case with Ramsey

Clark (writing the successful brief in his challenge to a

district court gag order).

Given my interests and abilities, it would be an in-

credible opportunity for me to assist

in any way with your

investigation. Should you have any use for a very sharp

thinker and tenacious researcher, I hope you will consider rie.

me. And if there is any further information you would like

to have, I would be happy to send it, and delighted to bring

it to you.

Very truly yours,

Xari Mordana

P.S.

In case you have no idea who your cousin Ziporah is,

you might ask your mother if she remembers "Zipsy"

Horowitz from Vienna.

Dear Mr. Sprague:

Sari Mordana has told me of her interest in

working on the legal staff you are assembling as Chief

Counsel

to the Select Committee on Assassinations. I

am writing this letter to recommend Miss Mordana for

such a position.

Miss Mordana has worked as my law clerk for

over a year, and I am highly impressed with her ability.

She is extremely bright and capable, and her superior

work has made a significant contribution to the cases

on which she has assisted. She has a great deal of in-

itiative in taking on responsibility, and has handled

the legal research and writing in several phases of com-

plex litigation with a minimum of supervision, and a high

degree of professionalism.

In addition to her practical legal ability, she

is articulate in the law, and her writing is of an ex-

tremely high caliber. As to her personal qualities, she

is an unusually alert and hard-working individual, who

delights in tackling a difficult project, and pursuing

it to a successful resolution.

Dear Mr. Sprague:

I understand that Sari Mordana is applying for a

position on the legal staff which you are gathering as

Special Counsel to

the select congressional committee which

will be investigating the assassinations of Martin Luther

King, Jr. and John F. Kennedy. This letter is being written

to recommend Miss Mordana for such a position.

I am a member of the adjunct faculty at Columbia

Law School. Each

spring I teach a seminar on trial practice

and, this year, Miss Mordana was one of the 18 students in

my class. The seminar requires substantial participation by

each student in simulated courtroom events and in the critiques

which follow.

As a result, I believe I am able to make an

informed judgment respecting Miss Mordana's ability and person-

ality.

I found her extremely bright and hard-working. But

just as important I found that she had an intangible quality

which unfortunately few law students possess - a spark which

ignites when she is working on a project she enjoys.

This

facet of her personality made her a very effective advocate.

She could marshal facts: and present them in a manner which

attracted attention and was convincing.

Having recently been part of a congressional inquiry

myself, as an associate of John Doar, I recognize the diffi-

culties involved in the task you are undertaking and the

would be an asset to your staff.

I wish you well.
