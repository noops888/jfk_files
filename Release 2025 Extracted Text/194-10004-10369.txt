SUBJECT was born, and was originally
registered, as Manuel Adrian SOTOMAYOR-
BADILLO. HIS father was originally
recorded as Adrian Sotomayor. How-
ever, on 5 March 1963, SUBJECT'S
father changed his name to Manuel
Marti under correction number 249,
and changed his SON'S surname on the
same date.
AGENT'S NOTES: According to Spanish tradition, a person's surname is
sometimes compounded by using the father's surname followed by the mother's
maiden name in hyphenated form. However, many persons now omit the mother's name
in common usage.
Attention is invited to Agent Report, Birth-Father, dated 24 September
1968, reflecting the results of an examination of the Court Order, which effected
correction number 249, dated 5 March 1963 (EXHIBIT 211).
