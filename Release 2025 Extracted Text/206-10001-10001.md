The Board meeting was jolned at this point by

Raymond G. Rocca (substituting for Mr. James Angleton of CIA)

for a briefing of Board members on CIA's counterintelligence

program.

Mr. Rocca began his brlefing with the statement that

CIA does not have the entire world-wide responsibility

for counterintelligence (CI). To 1llustrate this point,

he exhibited a chart dated September 1962 entitled "U.S.

Organization for counterintelligence" showing the varlous

elements of the rumerous U.S. departments and agencies whose

functions and responsibilitles bear some relationship to

counterintelligence: within CIA Itself the CI function 13

The headquarters

staff consists of 85 officers and 66 clerical personnel

(although there 1s a large numbei of CIn headquarters personnel

assigned to other intelligence activitles which are related

to CIA's CI programs). At CIA stations overseas, CI functions

are performed by varlous CIA personnel in such areas

as Penetration;

Provocation, Double Agents, Technical Survelllances, Protective

CI Services, Interrogations, and Deception.

Mr. Rocca stated that studies and recommendationg made:

to the v.s. Embassy in Moscow. He said that there are sources in

the USSr who would be willing to work with the CIA If the Agency

had personnel on the scene to operate these bources.

Mr. McCone

noted that there are only four CIA people in thelmbassy, along

with some 17 US military personnel. In contrast, fir. McCone

noted, in the U.S. there are 185 Soviet and 93 Soviet satellite

Intellizence officials operating against the US In the washington

Do Co and New York (UN) areas. The DCI stated that on the question.

of placing additional CIA personnel under official cover in the

embassy

at Moscow, the Ambassadur has steadfastly held that the risk

of damage from exposure of such personnel is so severe that it is

not worth the gamble. Therefore, Mr. McCone said, CIA has only four

men in the Moscow Embassy and they would all have to work on any

one case.:

Recalling that several CIA operatives had to be taken

out of Moscow when the Penkurskly case blew up, the DCI empha-

sized that CIA needs to augment its personnel there, In answer

to Mr clifford's inquiry as to what steps were being taken by the

DCI to obtain authorization for the assignment of additional CIA

personnel to the Embassy In Moscow, Mr. McCone said that he has had

conversations with the head of the State Department, However, housing

for Us personnel is limited in Moscow and the net result of in

creasing CIA personnel there would probably necessitate the re

moval of a State Department political officer or some other state

Department representative.

Mr. McCone referred to the Vietnam situation as being very bad, with

a disintegtation of relations between the Diem regime and che, Vietnamese and

the U. So The situation is so bad we may have to get out of the war.. The

U. S could live with Diem's antagonism but he has lost popular support and

winning. the war would be a hollow victory. The U.S. has:had no guccess in

setting Diem to mend his policy. The shooting into a crowd of Buddhists and

the deaths of 8 of them began an Impossible situation, and the August raids on

the pagodas were the last straw."

If the Diem regine were to be disposed of,

there's no one to replace him, and even though a military coup were pulled

off; CIA does not belleve it could stay in power. CIA is maintaining contact

with the milltary to keep watch on them (but there is no ClA support as has

been publicly alleged).

The DCI sald that there have been recelved disturbing reports that thu

There are differences of

solution.

Some think if we can get diem to do reforms we can win the war and

get out:

Others think Diem should be overthrown.

In answer to Mr. Clifford, the DCI sald that State Department and CIA

collaboration is close on the vietnam sicuation. He added however that there

was no coordination of the hastily composed August 24 cablegram from the

State Department telling the Embassy to begin thinking about "unloading the

FOR SEGNES

Mr. Clifford Invited the DCI to take up any other matters he wished to:

cover. Mr. Mccone said there were a few that time didn't permit him to cover,

but he would furnish the Board memoranda on "Deep Cover" and "Soviet Irawlers".

As to scheduled CORONA launchings care should be taken as to

their

freguency having in mind that CORONA shots cost $9 million each and GAMBiT

$12 million,

Mr. Gray mentioned to the ICI a recent remark made by Alexis Johnson to

some of the Board members to the effect that although the U. S. can put a man

on the moor. for a billion dollars, we can't place an agent in Castro's office.

MI. Gray said that he would like to hear MI. McCone's comments to the Board

some time as to the prospect of ClA penetrating the USSR and Cuban Governments

If unlimited millions or billions of dollars were avallable. Mi. Clifford

agreed that the Board

should hear from the DCI on this at the next Board

meeting. Mr. McCone's visit completed, he departed the Board meeting at 12:15.

Following lunch, the Board resumed in executive session. Mr. Coyne

reported some infurmation just received in the Dunlap case. Dunlap's wife

produced another Government document which her husband had apparently removed

from NSA.

She said she found it in a strong box to which her husband was not

supposed to have had a key. NSA Director Blake had Informed MI. Coyne that

the document was from NSA to ovurseas stations on steps to be taken in tests.

of procedures with respect to intercepts of Soviet scrambler traffic.

Dr. Baker noted that this 1s serious, because our only hope for exploiting

Soviet scrambler: communications Is to take advantage of operator and encryption

mistakes, so any reminder to the Soviets that NSA personnel are iooking for

'"busts" will be very bad.

Dr. Baker said that the DCI's remark about Dunlap being at the cross-

roads of NSA Information 18 untrue, because in fact Dunlap had access only

bus largely the initiative is with State, Defense,

and CIA In making these:

current intelligence submissions.

In short, Mr. Bundy sald that che means of access to intelligence are

good, for policy purposes.

As to the

second ltem on the Board's list, Me, Bundy sald he would have

to.throw back.to

the Board the question as to any modificationa considered

destrable in providing Intelligence community support to the White House

(in the light of the Board's Cuba report). Me. Bundy thought that he would

not be as good a witness of the Board on this.

DI. Land remarked that this morning the Board heard optimisticallys

worded reports by CIA on the responsiveness of Cubans di small sabotage efforts,

but when the ClA representatives were asked about a long range plan for use in:

case of a coup in Cuba, they indicated that they lad none. De. Land also

wondered whether we would have advance intelligence on a coup in time for

our Government to act

on It. Mi. Bundy said that we do have

en intelligence

input on the question of whether a coup would result in unacceptable Sovlet

reaction, and the tentative judgment

That there would not be.

Mr. Clifford recalled remarka by the CIA representatives to the effect

that 1f agent teams now being sent into Cuba are caught, ClA will get the !"

blame as It does in the case of non-CIA covcrt actiona detected by the Castro

regime. Mr. Bundy agreed that this is not a very good defense when agent

teams are caught and their activitles are attributed

to. CIA by Castro.

Mr. Bundy said that the Scandlug Group:

file on Cuba 1s large and Mr. Coyne

might well look through it.

Mr. Murphy wondered whether the intelligence effort is adequately tied

In to the pollcy process, and he cited the August 24 State Department message

to Salgon representatives indicating a policy change. Me. Bundy sald that the

State Departuent message was not very well coordinated in Its preparation,

büt :

there was no failure of Intelligence Involved.

Nexi, as to the adequacy of intelligence comnunity production of timely,

cumulative assessments of current intelligence and indicator-type data, for.

example in the South Vietnam situation, Mr. Bundy said that the intelligence

record on problems developing there since last May is pretty 8o0d. The

difficulty is that when you get into a matter Involving dally operational-type

policy decisiong,

it is not

easy to keep track of the very latest developments.

From now on, Mr. Bundy

said

that steps will be taken to make sure that thei

Standing Group and Executive Committee of the NSC have the same dally "new news!'.

as their

various

intelligence officers do. The principal question regarding

Vietnam 1s what does Diem actually think he is doing. Raw.

intelligence

material 1s not lacking, Mr. Bundy said, but assessment is the problem.

As to the fourth question listed by the Board, Mr. Bundy said that it

would cause a problem. if the Board were to be made reciplents of the dili

CIA Presidential Check List, because the Board would then be setting something

to which the rest of the White House family does

not have acuess.

Mr. Bundy

said that he analyzes the Check List on a dally basis and this has resulted

In the President getting sharper Information. However, Mr. Bundy said that

It would be a good thing if Mr. Coyne would look over past Check Lists for

periods of perhaps a month, with a vlew to analyzing the submissions.

As to the fifth and last item in Me, Clifford's list iinviting

suggestions for Increasing the Board's access to covert action matters and

Spectal Group actlvitles) Mr. Bundy said that he frankly did not know the

Board's present method of covering NSC 5412/2 matters.

DI. Langer said that

the Board Panel on che subjece gets briefings from time to time on covert

scrion operations.

Mr. Bundy arated thar he himself looks to ClA for reports

But if che Board appoints a Panel to do a review of all covert

Mr. Clifford sald that he or Mr. Coyne would be in touch with Mr. Bundy

regarding the desired revlew of NSC 5412/2 activities.

Chairnan Clifford then turned to the subject of the Nuclear Test Ban

Treaty, noting that the Board had looked at U.S. Intelligence capability

to detect violations.

He said that 15 appeared thus far that the U.S.

capability 1s largely based on the acquisition and enlargement of detection

systens in the fucure.

Mr. Buncy said that he is concerned

about the U.S.

capability to apply intelligence safeguards against the treaty violations,

but is unwilling to sign a blank check for detection programs.

So the Board

should keep aware uf the question as to the worth of adopting certain additional

detection systems, and in Me. Bundy's view he need more than we now have.

all of the 13 or so under consideracion are probably not necessary. He added
