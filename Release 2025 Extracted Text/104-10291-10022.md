COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL (contd)

William M. Kent

Clandestine Service, one of my prime responsibilities is to try to

reestablish the integrity of the current letter evaluations used in

fitness reports and one of the first places for me to start is in my

own Staff.

With that said, I do wish to underscore the fact that Mr. Kent

is a responsible and responsive professional who knows what he has

co do, does it with a minimum of fuss, writes clearly and to the point,

Is dedicated and in my judgment fully warranta an overall evaluatio

prose which enables him to write crisp

with speed and precision, all aid him in carrying out his responsibilities

in a superior manner.

Subject does not become a victim of routine.

In addition to

(Several hundred NOC applicants and on-board

personnel have thus been listed by skills bank criteria.)

Subject constantly seeks to make the NOC Branch a more meaningful

and useful management tool.

I find him a thoughtful and canny colleague,

careful to observe in full the regulatory limits of our activity but

quick to perceive opportunities to support and

assist the divisions

within those limits.

He is a firm,

no-nonsense supervisor of

Branch personnel.

He speaks his mind, honestly but tactfully, when

differences occur between him and me.

It is my conviction that he is

ready to enter into the upper reaches of staff and supervisory echelons

of the Directorate and has by now proven that he is as adept at staff

responsibilities

as he was previously impressive in his field and

operational

responsibilities.

In short, a comer and a cherished

colleague.

COMMENTO OF REVITWINO DEPICIAL

I became C/CMS on 1 October 1976 and thus my comments must be restricted

to the October-December 1976 time frame. I have no basic disagreement with the

narrative comments but do challenge the letter evaluatione. While Mr. Kent's

performance has been strong and he has amply demonstrated he is a GS-15 level

officer capable of assuming greater responsibilities, I cannot concur that his

performance 'is so exceptional to requirements of the work and in comparison of

others doing similar work as to warrant special recognition'. On purely technical

grounds there is no other officer serving as DC/CMS/NOC and thus the comparison

is invalid. Secondly, as Chief, Career Management Staff and administrator of the

should

like to make a final comment on the performance of Mr. Kent

who has

served with me during the entire period of my

assignment and who,

SinCe March 1976

has been my deputy.

More specifically, the period since i January 1977 has beer

a trying

one fur this component and has culminated with its

sudden transfer from one component (CMS) to another (ADDO/D).

During this most recent period, Mr. Kent has

lemonstrated his capacity for growth and leadership.

He has

himself handled virtually all of the transition aspects for

involving briefings and counsel for his new

branch chief, given my fairly lengthy TDY absence abroad

during that

fitness report that

that Rent is a senate and mature supervisory

officer, very well organized in his work habits and capable

of making measured judgments and decisions.

His continuity

aspects of nonofficial cover

and its ramifications makes

him a valued and valuable staff officer. I would say his

future contribution lies in the hire noted the clear progress

quiciDE Directorate Dersonne!

ne has made in the past year in taking supervisory decisions

involving personnel, firmly and crisply.

3. Given his impressive field and Headquarters experience,

Kent should

be given

an opportunity to display his worth in

professionalism and maturity.

I give him an unquestioned "Strong"

for this final period he

has served with me.

COMMENTE OF REVIEWINO OSPICIAL

I am in basic agreement with these comments and with the overall rating of Strong.

Unfortunately, due to the physical separation of my office and that where Mr. Kent

labors, I find it difficult to provide meaningful substantive comments. I have served

as C/CMS only since 1 October 1976 and, while individual branches within CMS are

widely dispersed, I have been lucky in having each managed and run by a senior

experienced officer of supergrade rank. This was true in CMS/NOC and I am more

than willing to accept C/CMS/NOC's evaluation of Mr. Kent. In my own dealings with

Kent, I have found him to be responsive, informed, articulate and an excellent team

player. I am also aware of certain innovations developed by him and implemented

A good, solid officer with additional growth potential.

Section D (continued)

Kent, William M.

healthy skepticism enables him to contribute materially to the

smooth, still

on-going,

transition from the old to the new way.

In this context he has

made invaluable suggestions on how we

shall proceed in order to improve the operational efficacy of

a NOC officer,

as well as to ease the burdens imposed on the

private life of a NOC officer.

3. Worthy of

special note is the systematic and orderly fashion

in which he tackled each new problem.

These attributes resulted

in his solving many of the thorny personnel problems which have

confronted us of late. Mr. Kent's industriousness -- on the

average he spends 10 hours a day in the office -- together with

his legendary meticulousness have enabled him to set up an

effective referral system through which we control the flow-

through of both traditional and new NOC officers -- a most

difficult and at times frustrating task.

As a deputy and acting branch chief he has been a firm

his subordinates.

tempered by a judicious application of human

understanding

or compassion in cases of

"hard-to-place" NOC officers. His

advice in solving many of these cases to the satisfaction of

both the officer and the operational component involved was

most welcome.

In sum, Mr. Kent has been a most effective deputy.

As

noted above,

he has many outstanding traits and his overall

performance has been a solid strong.

Having been appointed

to my present position on 23 May 1977, this

report covers seven months.

In this time I have learned to appreciate

Mr. Kent's excellent performance in supporting and guiding the mission

of this branch.

Considering

the outstanding evaluation he received from

my predecessor,

it must have

been a great disappointment to Mr. Kent

that he was not advanced to become branch chief.

I make this observa-

tion because Mr. Kent has never demonstrated his obvious disappointment

On the contrary,

from the first moment he has shown extraordi-

nary and enthusiastic willingness in providing the needed continuity

run this branch which controls the career progression of the NOC officer

complement consisting of between 275 and 300 officers at any given time.

No doubt the reader is aware of the intricate, complicated and at times

confusing bureaucratic machinery which governs the NOC officer program.

Mr. Kent has done a superb job in helping me understand and cope with

this maze.

mitant issuance of new, precise and explicit regulations we now hope to

streamline and simplify

COMMENTA OF REVISMIMO OPTICIAL

I have not had the opportunity to observe Mi. Kent's performance as closely as

the rating officer.

However, the rater's comments strike me as being eminently fair

and accurate. Mr. Kent has certainly performed well and his thorough and accurate

presentations have indeed been impressive.

Despite my somewhat limited association

with Mr. Kent, but having full confidence in the rating officer's judgment, I have

no hesitation in concurring in the overall rating of Strong.

The nature of Mr. Kent's service to the

Agency during this period has been described more fully in

Mr. Kent served as Acting Deputy Branch Chief of

while concurrently continuing to direct the large and im-

competence.

Mr. Kent thus was

handling two

exacting jobs

simultaneously during the entire coup period.

time of particular tension for the Branch, since developments

in Chile were of international importance

and generated almost

daily requests for special papers and briefings for top U.S.

Government leaders.

Mr. Kent performed at a consistently

high level in both

his SA and managerial capacities: his

propaganda and political action guidance was timely, imagina-

Subject is a bright young officer who has made an outstanding contribution

to the operations of the Station since his arrival on duty. He is unusually

well motivated and energetic in his work.

he has shown a high degree of

Inagination and intelligence in his direction of KUCAGE operations. He has

handled his agents and other contacts in an exemplary fashion.

The only factor that has had to be discussed with Subject is his need

for greater patience, tact and understanding in his dealings with fellow

workers.

subject has great potential which should not necessarily be limitad to

¡UGAGE type activities. His abilities and attributes are of equal value to

time has demonstrated an unusual ability to provide tragitative, timely and useful

propaganda guidances for covert field use. He 1s very sensitive and perceptive

to the carabilities and limitations of WHD media operations and exploits their

possibilities to the maximum. He has been particularly effective in the exploita-

tion of leads provided by KUTUBE sources as the basis for "black" operations.

In this regard he has shows great initiative, Imagination and professional ability.

Kent regularly makes sound suggestions for Increasing the effectiveness and

security of WHD media operations, and with more time on the job, and an increased

bowledge of specific country operations, he should further improve his ability

to assess and review WHD projects.

This officer 15 admirably sulted for hispresent assignment; he is creative

and an industrious worker, producing quickly and with a minimum of supervision;

his guidances are well written and easily understood; and he has sole responsibility

for bio functional duties as part of a small three-man staff team. He bas a

friendly disposition and gets along well with his co-workers, although he 18 a

The risk, he said, is too great, adding

that where recruitment responsibilities are envisaged, a

devised facility cover rather than that of a real firm, is

provided.

He suggested that I call Mr. Will Burke, current

the Corporate Cover Branch in CCS, for further de-

tails and confirmation.

in essence, he said the same thing that Bladeaux had said,

allowing that there are occasional exceptions such as an

NARRATIVE COMMENTS

ugust subiect was transferred PCS to New Orleans where he was responsibl

for all aspects of the operation of proprietary foundation MCLIPPER. During

the reporting period, he has consistently demonstrated a High degree of enthusiasm

and operational initiative. Although operating under instructions not to expand

foundation activities too rapidly, he has not waited for an official "go-ahead"

but has shown unflagging energy in planning operations for the period when

JMCLIPPER could expand activities. He has shown an unusually keen perception

of areas of CA ope rational needs and of imaginative thinking on how to fill these

Subject has shown himself fully capable of exercising the self-disciplined and

self-motivation necessary in an unofficial cover position. His proficiency in

Spanish has been useful in meeting and entertaining Latin American travelers of

potential operational interest passing through his city. He has handled his

cover situation well.

The cover office has been well run with no significant

financial, administrative, or personnel problems having arisen during the period,

Subject has exhibited an above-average cost consciousness.

should be noted that his assessments are not in depth. It would be

preferable if he concentrated on a few good prospects, leading to

SUBJECT

Responsibilities During Assignment to

DO/Washington Base

(re fitness Report Jan 69 - Jan. '70)

FROM

:

Mr. William M. Kent

1. During the early days of my assignment to DO/Washington

Base, the matter of my cover was discussed

a number of times

with DO Personnel and CCS.

Eventually, CCS came up with World

Wide Information

services, Inc., of New York, as a legitimate

firm which would provide me with the needed cover. It came

out loud and clear during the discussions that this cover

would allow me to spot, assess and develop targets of interest,

and would allow me to handle recruited agents, but, because

of the high risk involved in the use of a legitimate firm for

cover purposes, I was not to engage in recruitments.

Despite its one limitation, the cover was ideal.

Among other things, I:

a. Handled a recruited Venezuelan agent assigned

to the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington;

Handled a recruited code clerk assigned to one

of the embassies in Washington;

Contacted and assessed a high official of the

soviet Embassy,

made arrangements to have him met by

another Base Case Officer under alias who continued

the development which

eventually was to lead to a re-

cruitment pitch;

Made contact with and developed two Arab

officials assigned to the Arab Information Office in

Washington;

Made contact with and developed officials

the Polish, Czech, Hungarian and other Embassies; was

on particularly good terms with the Poles;

Made contact and developed an official of the

Pakistani Embassy;

Made contact, developed and turned over to

another case officer

was subsequently recruited

and was to be sent to India

to work on the Chicom target.

Maintained my cover in a manner which was

completely devoid of suspicion during the entire period

I used it.

3. When the Base moved to its new offices in Waghingion,

the

COB gave me my instructions.

He told me that I should

avoid making or

maintaining contacts in the Church and Latin

American communities in Washington; that I was not being

assigned any geographical area on

which to concentrate but

would be expected to use

my judgment, seek out persons who

might be of interest, and take advantage of opportunities

which might arise; that I would be given recruited agents to

nandle as the need arose; that, per the limitation concerning

my cover, I was not to engage in actual recruitments,

but

was to spot,

assess, and develop persons of possible

interest

who would be

a position just vacated by the newly appointed deputy branch chief.

Despite

these, to him, minor obstacles, he called upon his close

association with Latin American affairs for many years, his wealth of

cessfully with people and situations in asserting leadership and quickly

bringing the Peru Desk under his own independent control.

clandestine activity. There islittle question that Covert Action is

equally noted that the FI and CI aspects of

In my capacity as Branch Chief during the period January to April 1971,

I had ample opportunity to observe the work of Mr. Kent and had the pleasure of

working directly with him on a variety of sensitive and important activities. In

addition to his highly imaginative yet realistic approach to the problem of Chile,

he amply demonstrated his ability to deal with persons who were out to sell bills

of goods to the Agency. His clear understanding of the role of the Clandestine

Service protected the Agency from disagreeable encounters that might have

resulted in compromises or embarrassments. His forte is clearly. in the field

of public relations and propaganda well-adjusted to the role of the Clandestine

It should be noted that during this period Mr. Kent served for

abilities in handling Branch-level matters. He showed similar

managerial ability in his handling of the two officers and secretary

shown a bigb degree of cost consciousness in all phases of hig work.

some of the Agency's objectives for influencing the meeting were

effort conducted by the Branch.

He turned in a very strong performance

report covers

approximately five and one half months since I

submitted the last report on Mr. Kent. Unfortunately, and I do mean

unfortunately, it will

be the last fitness report written on Mr. Kent

because he has elected

to retire on 30 June 1978.

Although his retirement was just around the corner, Mr. Kent did

slacken his pace.

On the contrary, in the last four months the NOC

Branch has been

besieged with a myriad

of statistical reports from DDO

management.

Had it not been for the legendary meticulousness of Mr.

Kent, coupled with his excellent tribal memory, the NOC Branch would

been hard-pressed

to come up as promptly and as efficiently with the

figures and facts as was the case.

Much of it Mr. Kent and his staff

accomplish while he was

acting for me while I was on a 4 week TDY.

He definitely excelled

at running the branch during these four weeks.

In closing I would like to say that CIA is losing one of its finest

officers in Mr. Kent.

This may not be the proper vehicle for making

the foilowing statement, but I would like to state nevertheless and with-

out any equivocation whatsoever, that seldom in my career of 31 years

did I receive the kind of support and loyal counsel I received from

Mr. Kent during the past 13 months.

BY REVIEWING OFFICIAL

COMMENTA OF REVIEWINO OFFICIAL

There is little to add to the thoughtful and accurate comments of the rating

officer. I share his sense of loss over the retirement of Mr. Kent.

Mr. Kent performed

in an exceptionally able manner throughout the period of time covered by this report.

He was always quick and willing to respond and the results of his labors, without

exception, were of a very high professional order. As indicated, he was of great

assistance to the rating officer and to me as well, during this time.

It 1s Indead un-

fortunate that the clandestine service is losing the experfence and talent of Mr. Kent.

However, he reached this decision on his own and, after careful consideration, opted

for early retirement.

I can only wish him

well in his new endeavors and hope

that everything works out for him as planned.
