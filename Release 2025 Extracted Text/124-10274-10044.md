with Kemper:

Live

Jatle has been on the Khrushchev trip, and he said it was the most

hectic thing he has ever had to do in his life. He said there was no question about

Khrushchev's anger in Los Angeles and that one of the aides told him, "Don't be

surprised if the old man doefn't suddenly get up and go home." He said the

I security of Khrushchev was badly handled and that Roswell Garst, Coon Rapids,

towa, the millionaire farmer, is no more than a publicity seeker and is a real

"corn ball."

He said one amusing thing happened in San Francisco. At about

7:15 in the morning Khrushchev decided to take & walk and, apparently, caught his/

bodyguards flattooted. He headed down the street with the guards streaming out

the dcors behind him, some of them buttoning their clothes as they ran.

Jaie is trying to get back to Russia (CBS lost their corespondents

after the television show that was critical of Stalin, et al.) and he has been working

with people at the embassy to try and get back. He said that he wanted to go back

and have a television interview with Khrushchev on his reaction to his trip and thai

he had been in touch with Viktor Osipov, who is a second secretary in the embassy

and attached to the Cultural Section.

He said that at the reception at the embassy

on Thursday night, Osipov told him to submit his list of questions and he would see

what they could do about getting him to Moscow to interview Khrushchev.

" Jaife said that he felt that the over-all trip by Khrushchev would be

beneficial, particularly in case of a hot war because Khrushchev, having seen the

(country and the people, inay hesitate before "pushing the button."

This morning Kemper took a call from Mr. Sam Jaffe,

CBS News--Television, New York, Plaza 1-2345, Extension 7801.

He wanted to know if it would be possible to interview the Director

in connection with the current juvenile delinquency problem in

New York City. Kemper told Jaffe that the Director had a firm

policy in not injecting himself into local matters; and accordingly,

the Director could not comply with this request:

Jaife then wanted to know if it would be possible to

interview SAC Foster on the problem of juvenile delinquency, but

that this interview would be general in nature and would not refer

to the specific New York problem, but would cover the broad

national picture.

Kemper advised Jaffe that again it would be injecting

the FBI into the local situation, and we did not deem this advisable.

Jaffe agreed. Kemper called SAC Foster and alerted him to Jaffe's

call and explained to him the reasons. Foster said that he would be

alert to keeping out of the situation as it developed in New York.

Informant's wife was briefly acquainted with the

Bureau's interest in the soviets as this interest stems

from the Bureau's jurisdiction in matters involving the

At the same time her attention

was called to recent publicity appearing in the "NY Herald

She

was also told that the Bureau wanted to be sure that its

Informant was interviewed on 5/12/59 at which time

he advised that it

is fairly certain that he and his wife

will be divorced and all possibilities of a reconciliation

have been exhausted.

Informant presumes that his wife will

obtain the divorce in Reno, Nevada on a date as yet un-

not anticipate any scandal in

connection with the divorce nor does he anticipate any

publicity unless it results from the inability of he and

his wire to resolve the problem of custody of their children.

During this interview, the informant advised that

he is still desirous of travelling to Red China as a news

reporter and toward this end he has written to the Chinese

Legation in London and forwarded three copies of "Face of Red

the Bureau.

Stability and Reliability

%..

Information furnished by informant has been found

to be reliable.

Much of this information has been substantiated

by other live sources who have, on occasion, furnished the

same information as informant,

or who have furnished information

with respect to informant's contacts with individuals about

whom he has subsequently furnished information. Information

furnished by the informant with respect to movement of

certain

individuals hase proved reliable, based upon known activites

of these individuals.

Informant has shown no signs of instability;

however, informant does have personal problems involving

marital difficulties which have caused him great concern of

late. He has been separated from his wife since 1/ 30/59,

and in spite of his desire to effect a reconciliation, his

wife is not interested in this. No legal action has been

started by informant or his wife, at this time, however, a

divorce will probably be sought by informant's wife in the not

too

distant future.

k. Indoctrination Against Disclosure

The informant has ben repeatedly reminded of

the necessity for keeping his relationship with the Bureau

in strictest confidence.

Informant in turn has repeatedly

expressed utmost concern about the possibility that it

might become known that he was furnishing information to the

Bureau.

Informant has said that if this became known, it

would jeopardize his career as a news reporter.

ReBulet, 1/28/597

JAFFE was interviewed by SAS JOHN F. MABEY and

EDWARD F. GAMBER on 2/12/59. (JAFFE's identity should be

i protected.) As usual, JAFFE was most pleasant and

' comperative.

During the interview, JAFFE was casually asked

If he had read the article about the FBI in the 10/18/58

issue of "The Nation."

The introduction of this topic

into the interview was very casual and the exact date of

the issue in which the

article appeared was not actually

mentioned. JAFFE said that he did not read this article

nor had he heard about the article.

Interviewing Agents then

told JAFFE that the article was written in an apparent effort

to "smear" the Bureau.

The Agents commented that the Bureau

always welcomes constructive criticism, and upon receipt of

same, has always taken expeditious stops to make any

warranted changes in its operations.

However, the article

appearing in

: "The Nation" contained no constructive criticism

and in fact, the criticism contained therein was based on

untruths, erroneous conclusions, and biased innuendoes.

JAFFE said that he would like very much to read

this article and asked who the author was.

When the

name of FRED J. COOK was mentioned, it meant nothing to JAFFE,

but when JAFFE was told that COOK

wrote for the "New York

World Telegram and Sun," he expressed amazement.

Interviewing

Agents expressed idle. interest in knowing whatever provoked

the writing and publication of such an article and this

evoked from JAFFE the comment that CAREY MC WILLIAMS,

editor of "The Nation," was undoubtedly the moving factes

behind such an article appearing in "The Nation.

Inquiry concerning "The Nation" was

made during an

interview with JAFFE which encompassed some casual

conversation,

as well'as inquiry concerning his association

with soviet nationals.

JAFFE's reaction to the casual

'inquiry about "The Nation" was such that no possible

embarrassment to the Bureau can result.

He is most

cooperative and anxious to assist the Bureau.

The Bureau will be kept,

JAFFE was initially interviewed on 9/12/50,

and

subsequent to that time he was interviewed on 11/0, 12/12,4,

10,31/58 and 1/9/59. During these interviews he has

been most cooperative, and has furnished information

concerning numerous Soviet and Satellite nationals with

whom he is acquainted. His acquaintance with these people

Stems from his employment as a news reporter with the

Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), in which capacity

he feels that he needs news sources in Soviet and Satellite

circles.

Included among his acquaintances are the

following Soviet nationals:

NIKOLAI S. KALININ, known Soviet intelligence

agent.

VLADIMIR P. SUSLOV, known Soviet intelligence

agent.

VLADIMIR B. BARKOVSKY, known Soviet intelligence

agent.

JAFFE's acquaintance with VLADIMIR B.

BARKOVSKY is of such a nature that it might possibly

result in a double agent operation.

BARKOVSKY has

made inquiry of JAFFE concerning individuals, groups

and business firms on the West Coast of the United

States who were interested in seeing trade restrictions

placed on trade with Red China eased: JAFFE furnished

some information concerning

this to BARKOVSKY, and the

extent to which BARKOVSKy's inquiries along this line will (C.)

to put in writing his impressions and ahalysis of the

political scene in the US, and told JAFFE that he

would pay him for doing this.

JAFFE refused the offer.

on 11/14/58;

• advised that during

the week prior to 11/14/58, JAFFE was sitting at a

that in any contacts which this office has with JAFFE,

"The Nation"

The WFO has not as yet advised this office

information concerning JAFFE. Accordingly,

this office

with JAFFE concerning "The Nation"

of contacts with JAirt, ne nas stated that in nis

employment with the CBS, he is prohibited from writing

articles for any newspaper of magazine, or doing work

Therefore, it does not appear that

JAFFE is presently affiliated

with "The Nation" in any

respect.

It is obvious through conversations which

'interviewing agents have had with JAFFE that he has the

utmost respect for the Bureau, and is extremely

interested in the Bureau's work. He has had contacts

with Bureau personnel on matters related to his

position as

a news reporter with CBS, and he has

spoken of these contacts in a manner reflecting the

utmost respect for the personnel with whom he has had

contact.

He shows a sincere appreciation for the

If the Bureau so desires, this office believes

that the subject of "The Nation" could be discreetly

and tactfully brought up in the course of a conversation

with JAFFE.

This may then be discussed in a

conversational vein serving the purpose of exploring

JAFFE's present knowledge of the staff of "The Nation"

This subject will not be brought up with JAFFE in

the absence of Bureau permission.

Every opportunity has been taken to acquaint.

JafFE with the fact that his relationship with the

Bureau must be held in strictest confidence at all

times. JAFFE has made known the fact on repeated

occasions that information which he furnishes to the

Bureau must be handled in strictest confidence, since if

it became known that he were furnishing information to

the Bureau, his position as a news reporter would be

jeopardized: JAFFE has been told to use the facilities

of a public pay station when telephonically contacing

this office, and that he should not have any personal

contact at the NYO. However, these latter instructions

were qualified to the extent

that if in his position

as a news reporter it is necessary for him to contact

this office concerning matters other than those on

which he is furnishing information to this office,

he

must of course feel free to do so. JAFFE has been

told

he is not to consider himself to be an employee of the

Bureau and that his cooperation with the Bureau is to

be on a voluntary basis at all times. The Bureau's

Labor policy was

explained to JAFFE inasmuch as he

is a member of a labor union.

JAFFE has been told that; under no circumstances

would the fact that he is cooperating with the Bureau

in furnishing information to the Bureau, place him

in the position of receiving preferential treatment

NW 88326 Docld:32989704 Page 43

## Page 44

• NY 134-3315

when news releases were made by the Bureau.

He was

advised that an inquiry which he might make through

this office in connection with his employment should

be made through normal channels, and not through

agents to whom he is furnishing information. JAFFE

fully understands that he is not to be the recipient

of any personal consideration in matters of public

interest being investigated by the Bureau.

Further-

more, he fully understands the necessity for this,

at no time has indicated that he expected to

recipient of any personal favors.

Inasmuch as JAFFE is being contacted on a

rather regular basis, and has been found to be most

cooperative, this office desires to take steps to

develop him as a psi. It is noted that some steps

along this line have already been taken in order to

capitalize on existing situations, as well as JAFFE's

very favorable attitude concerning these situations.

Bureau permission is requested for this

office to develop JAFFE aS a PSI:

The informant told subject that his father

furnished him the names of several individuals who have

spoken in favor of

trade with Red China.

Most of the conversation at informant's

home on the evening of December 31, 1958, was of a

social nature, however, subject showed a definite

Interest In the Information which informant gave to him

about business concerns interested in trade with Red

China, and accordingly, Informant arranged to have

lunch

with subject on January 5, 1.959.

on January 5, 1959, Informant did have

lunch with subject, and subject again brought up the

matter of Mikoyan's visit to San Frandsco, and

asked informant

for sone background Information

on the clubs which he montioned.

Informant told subject

that he conversed with his father on the telephone,

over the weekend, and his father agreed that Mikoyan

woula do well to

speak before the Commonwealth Club

and the san Francisco Press Club.

Subject asked informant about the Union

League Club in San Francisco, and informant told

him that this club merged with the san francisco Press

club, although not all members of this club are members

of the Press.

C

He told subject that the union League club

was one of the best clubs in San Francisco,

and that it and

whe commonwealth club have as members all of the Influential

people in san Francisco.

Subject told infomant that he

would pass this information to the Soviet Embassy in

washington, D.C., but that for the most parti, the

sovies were relying on Eric Johnston, President of the

Motion Picture Association of America, when arranging

Mikoyan's activities.

Subject told Informant that the Soviets

st1ll owned property in san Francisco, which he believed C

-2-

to Include a bulloing.

It was the subject's opinion

that somebody from Washington, D.C. would accompany

Mikoyan for the purpose of inspecting this property,

Inäsmuch as the soviets aid not get an opportunity to visit

San Francisco too often. Subject mentioned to informant

that he traveled through San Francisco on his way

from Japan to Russia during World War II.

During lunch, subject asked informant

about the information he had obtained concerning

business

concerns on the WestCoast of the United States

destrous of doing business with Red China.

Informant verbally repeated what he had

told the subject on the evening of December 31, 1958,

mentioning that there were over 700 organizations in

"the C

San Francisco area who favored trade with China. At

subject's request, Informant wrote on a piece of paper, the

names of individuals who have spoken in favor of trade

with Red China.

The names which he wrote on the paper were

those of James P. Wilson, Manager of the World Trade Department

of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce; George E. Talmage,

Vice President of Pacific Transport Line

and States

U

Leines; John S. Bolles, Head of the Chamber of Commerce's

Industry Committee and Malcolm W. Boya, Assistant

In addition, informant told subject

that "The Dispatcher", official organ of the International

United States than to pick these goods up elsewhere.. He

made no further request of Iniormant for information

concerning bustness concerns desirous of doing business

During lunch, subject also asked informant

what the reaction in the United States has been to the

visit of Mikoyan. Informant told subject that 1t 1s too

early to tell, as we do not even know why Mikoyan is here.

He told subject that there was too much of a mystery

surrounding Mikoyan's visit and subject then asked informant

if there was not any reaction at all.

Informant told

Barkovsky that there was none of which he was aware.

The records of the United States Department

of State reflect that Vladimir Borisovich Barkovsky,

"Life" and "Time" magazines in 1954. He contacted representatives of the

Soviet Embassy on this occasion and a representative of "I'ime"and "Iife"

Memorandum for Mr. Belmont

RE:

SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE, aKO.

105-28333

Background investigation of Jaffe was instituted as a result of

his interview on 9-12-58. No derogatory information has been developed

and it appears that all of his contacts with the soviets have been as the

the additional significance of Jaffe's former association with

result of his news-gathering assignments. The New York Office, "Ine

Nation," since publishing the article entitted he taT," in the 10-18-58

issue of this publication, has requested Bureau authority to maintain

contact with Jaffe pending coverage of one remaining lead involving

review of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) records in order to receive

information concerning the soviets with whom he is in contact and as a

follow up of our 9a12-58 interview.

(c)

OBSERVATIONS :

It is believed that we should allow New York to continue

contacts with Jaffe and and it is possible that this contacts if properly

handled, may develop a source of information of significance concerning

souzet officials in New york as well as prouiding a possible source oy

information concerning the article and general policy of "The Nation"

through such contacts as Jaffe may still have on the staff of that

(c)

publication.

RECOMMENDATION:

If you approve, there is attached a letter to New York

authorizing continuedcontacts with Jafje concerning information of

interest to us concerning soviet officials and instructing New York to

be alert in their contacts with Jaffe to develop any opportunity that

and personalities that Jaffe may have knowledge of who are presently

connected with "The Nation."

Place ca

during interview. Interview was based on a telephone call

which JAFFE made to this Office advising that he was taking

(05860%-VADIM A. BOGOSIOVSKI and BORIS N. IVANOV to dinner. Initially

and throughout the interview JAfFE was told of the necessity.

for respecting the Bureau's confidence at all times. He (e)

agreed to do this.

The Bureau's jurisdiction in matters involving

the internal security of the United States was explained

to JAFFE as well as the Bureau's interest in Soviet Nationals

which stems from this jurisdiction. Mention was made gi

-the

fact that a large number of Soviet Nationals have been

declared personna non grata in recent years because of

activities in which they have engaged while in this country

JAFFE talked quite freely and at length about

his association with Soviet Nationals.

He said that in

his capacity as a news reporter for the Columbia Broadcasting

System, it was necessary for him to have as many contacis

as possible in order to keep abreast of newsworthy incidents

and information.

He said that he has been very successful

in cultivating the soviets and other foreigners at the UN

as news sources. He first met VADIM A. BOGOSLOVSKI and

NIKOLAI KALININ

an a press: party at the soviet Mission to

the UN.

He has gobven. to know these soviets very well,

and in fact he has visited their homes and they have

visited his home. He said that he sees these two Soviets

very frequently and is particularly close to BOGOSLOVSKI,

whom he describes as being very much unlike other Soviets.

JAFFE said that BOGOSLOVSk. is very outspoken and in lact

gave him a 24 hour "feat"

on the decision of NIKITA KHRUSCHEV

to accept an invitation to a Soviet conference under UN

auspices.

He said that the Soviets are usefulx in giving

him the deersion on what is going to happen.

When the

Mideast problem was before the UN, KALININ told JAFFE

that it would resolve itself but that he should keep

his eye on China.

(c)

In addition to BOGOSLOVSKI and KALININ, JAFFE

is acquainted with the following Soviets:

-VLADIMIR B. BARKOVSKY, Counsellor at the Sovdel

BORIS N. IVANOV, Press Officer, Sovdel

JAFFE met KRESTYANOV on one occasion at a party

at KALININ's home.

During interview JAFFE said that he would be

willing to furnish information to the Bureau concerning

his contacts with the soviets.

However, he said that he

would have to be sure that his identity would be protected

at all times.

He said he did not want to become another

BORIS MORROS or HERBERT PHILBRICK as it would ruin his career

as a news reporter if he did so.

He was told, that the Bureau

would respect his confidence, but that he in turn would

have to respect the Bureau's confidence at all times.

JAFFE mentioned that at one time

Afro-American News Reporter, mentioned that the State

Department had asked him if he possessed any information

'indicating that JAFFE was a Communist. JAFFE mentioned

this by way of inquiry of interviewing agents to ascertain

if they knew of any such allegation. Interviewing agents

then asked JArrE li he had ever been a member of the Cr,

and he said that he had not been a member of the CP or any.

Communist inspired organization nor has he ever sympathized

with the ce.

He said that his uncle, with whom he has a

close association, is the actor SAMUEL CHARLES JAFFE Who

was active on behalf of Russian War Relief and sympathized

with what proved to be Communist inspired organizations.

JAFFE said that he does not believe that his uncle was

a member of the CP however, and that his uncle did testify

before the House Committee

on Un-American Activities.

on January 2, 22 and February 2, 1954 by Bureau Agents

and was cooperative.

He denied membership in the CP

but admitted membership in 14 Communist front organizations.

His file contains information reflecting alledged CP

membership.

SAM JAFFE, subject of instant airtel, is acquainted

with two known soviet agents in the person of BARKOVSKY and

KRESTYANOV, one potential soviet defector in the person of

BOGOSLOVSKI, and two other Soviets who are among the more

active Soviets in the NYC area.

All possible coverage

of these Soviets is desirable.

Should JAFFE fail to respect the Bureau's

confidence, he would jeopardize his own career and

certainly his contacts at the UN.

This is pointed out

as it is believed that this puts

the Bureau in a better

position to control JAFFE. than would be, true in the case of

the average individual.

It is not believed that JAFFE can be used in

connection with the penin at this time because

of his reluctance to do anything other than furnish

information to the Bureau. However, it is believed that

JAFFE can be used as an informant or source of information

furnishing information with respect to his contacts with

the soviets.

This Office realizes thät JAFFE's uncle presents

one very serious drawback to his use as an informant.

A review of the New York Office Indiçes

reflects numerous references to the name SAMUEL JAFFE;

however. based on the information from a

'it

would appear that the subject is identical with the

This identification is based

upon the following facts obtained from the previous

investigation of the subject.

According to:

JAFFE, on numerous

occasions during 1955 and 1956, had been in contact

with individuals at the Soviet Embassy in Washington,

D.C. in regard to visa matters pertaining to his contemplated:

travel to the USSR.

In April, 1954, according to

JAFFE was In contact with the soviet United Nations

Delegation in New York City.

At this time, it was

determined that he was employed as a culture researcher

for "Life" Magazine in New York City, and had contacted

the Soviet United Nations Delegation in connection

with some work he was doing on a story for this

magazine.

Subsequently, it was determined from

Inquiry at the offices of "Iife" Magazine, that

JAFFE waS born on 6/19/28.

Passport records of the Department of State,

reviewed on 7/27/55, (as set forth in WFO letter of 8/25/55),

reflect that JAFFE,

in a supplemental statement dated

6/22/55 in connection with his passport, indicated

that he wished to have his passport amended to allow

him to travel in Communist China as a professional

American journalist.

It was indicated further, that

he had excellent reason to believe that the Red Chinese

Government would allow him to enter their country as

a journalist in view of the fact that during the

Asian-African Conference at Bandung, Indonesia, he

obtained

an interview with Red Chinese Premier CHOU-EN-LAI.

on 4/30/57, Mr. M

200 East End Avenue, New

York City, advised SA

F. MABEY that the subject, who is presently an employee

of the Columbia Broadcasting System in New York City,

presently resides in an apartment at this address with

his wife and small child. -

In view of the information which is set forth

in the subject's investigative file reflecting numerous

past contacts on his part with various soviets attached

to both the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C., and

the Soviet United Nations Delegation, New York City,

and the fact that the subject has a history of employment

in the capacity of a news correspondent, the New York

Office feels that no contact should be initiated at

this time with the subject concerning his association

with GRUSHA. In addition, it is to be noted that

following a contact by the subject with KONSTANTIN G

Magazines

contacted the Bureau, alleging that he believed

JAFFE had been under surveillance by the FBI.

The New York Office feels that subject's

contact of GRUSHA possibly can be logically explained

as a normal contact in view of the subject's employment,

and it is felt that an interview with JAFFE would

possibly result in embarrassment to the Bureau should

the subject take exception to the Bureau's interest

in his activities.

Copies of this letter are being disseminated

to the Washington Field Office and San Francisco Office

for information in view of their past interest in the

subject.

Jaffe was

of

this Bureau on January 3, 1956, at his home 301 Fletches

Drive, Atherton, California.

He identiried himself as a

corraspondent currently representing the North American

He stated he was formerly employed by

"Jime"

and "Ilfe"

and in connection with this latter eu

ployment, had been assigned to wilting and research on the

articlos

published in

"Iito" magazine doaling with the various

religions of the world. Jarfe stated that in connection with

this assignment he made the acquaintance of Fedoseev (Konstantin

Go redoseer, counselor, soviet ambassy, washington, Do c.

Jaffe said he had contacted Fedoseev initially in his efforts

to obtain a visa to enable him to enter China. la commented

this had been a mistake to approach the soviets in this

sogard inasmuch as they could not or at least did not, do

anything to ald in the isquance of the visd. (o)

• Jaffe advised he had been attempting to obtain a

visa to enter tho soviet Union to write a serios of articles

on conditions existing there and in his efforts to obtain

this visa he had again contacted fedoseov.

After considerable

delay, be was advised that a visa would be issued for a period

not to excood two weeks.

Taffe said he contacted Fedosoey

in the hope thet he could obtain a visa for a longer period

of time, but Fedoseev advised Jaffe the Issuance of such e

visa would not follow, but that he could possibly obtain an

extension on the two weeks' visa. Jaffe stated he challenged

the statement of Fedoseer that his visa would be extended

and sinco he could receivo assurance of à visa for a period

not to exeeed two weeks, he had decided against making the

trip to the Soviet Union and he returned to his home in

Athorton from Washington, Do Gi, and New forko (C)

Jaffe commented that in discussing his desire for a

visa with fedoseer, the latter had indicated that should

Jaile write objectively concerning the Soviet Union he,

Fedoseav, felt certain Jafreis visa would be extended.

Jeffe

said he challenged this remark by Fedoseev and indicated to

the later he felt Fedoseev's remarks were equivalent to

blackmail and that in order for him to set an axtension on

his visa it would be noesssary for him to slant his enticles

in favor of the Soviet Union.

Fedoseer danied this intent

and stated only that they desired the articlas to be written

objectively.:.j

to obtain

à visa for a longer period of time but FEDOSHEV had advised him

that the issuance of such a visa would not follow but that he could possibly

obtain an extension on the tro weeks 'visa.

to the latter that he felt FEDOSEEVis remarks were equivalent to blacknail

and that in order for him is get an extension on his visa he would have to

slant his articles in favor of the Soviet Union. FEDOSEEV immediately

denied this intent and stated only they desired the articles to be written

objectively. JAFFE suated that during his conversation with FEDOSEEV he

had remarked that his, Jarli's, father had been born in the soviet Union.

inquired if JAFIE's fathes was still a citizen of the Soviet Union..

stated that when he advised FEDOSEE that his, JAFFEss, lather was an American

citizen that FEDOSEIV was apparently very disturbed concerning this and on

several occasions inquired of JAFFE if the latter had any relatives still

appointed when advised tat JAFFE had no relatives presently residing in the

Soviet Union.

The above is furnished for the information of the Bureau, Washington

He was issued Passport Number 36093, San Francisco series,

on 2/25/55.

This passport is not valid for travel to Albania, Bulgaria,

China, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Rumania, or the USSR unless

specifically endorsed by the Department of State as being valid for

such travel.

A letter dated 2/23/55 on the letterhead of the "Nation! 68

Post Street, San Francisco, California, signed by JAFFE as West Coast

Correspondent addressed to

the Passport Agency, Department of State,

San Francisco, Califomia, relates that his Far Eastern trip will be

made as a working journalist; that the trip will last approximately

three months and he will visit such countries as Japan, Burne, Pakistan,

India, Indonesia, Hong Kong, and Thailand.

A letter dated 2/25/55 on the above letterhead, signed by

JAFFE, as West Coast Bureau Chief, addressed to Mr. HARRY H. BOLDS,

Passport Agency, San Francisco, California, relates that as the "Nation"

magazine's West

• Coast Bureau Chief he is classed as a member of the

Publications Board of Editors. Thus, he is in the position of an

editorial executive. He wrote further that as he explained to BOLDS

those in authority at their home office in New York are on vacation.

While in the employ of Time, Incorporated, "Life' magazine, he made a

trip to Asia in an editorial capacity; that BOLDS' New York office asked

him to write a letter on "Life"stationery stating the purpose of his

trip abroad though at the time he was making the journey for some other

publications. He explained this and the fact that he was only a reporter..

This, JAFFE wrote, seemed to make no difference as long as the New Tort

agency had a letter on file.

An application for amendment of Passport Number 36093, San

Francisco series, as above, dated June 22, 1955, and signed by darfE,

Imperial Hotel, New Delhi, India, was forwarded by the American Consular

Service at New Delhi to the Department of State, Washington, D. C., for

consideration and decision. The application reflects that JAFFE desired

his passport be made valid for travel in Communist China. In the

application he referred to an attached supplemental statement.

The supplemental statement is dated 6/22/55 and is on the

letterhead of Hotel Imperial, New Delhi. It shows the following:

JAFFE asks that his passport be amended allowing him to travel

in Communist China as a professional American journalist and he understands

that he will personally assume all the risks in such an undertaking.

If this request is not within the pover of the Department of State to

approve, he desires to know if the Department of State would have any

objection if he deposited his passport with the nearest Embassy and

entered Communist China, assuming all risks, as a private citizen.

His purpose in visiting Conmunist China would be in the

capacity of a professional journalist for the "Nation" magazine of

America and other American publications to write on what is taking place

in Red China today. He would also seek an interview with Red China's

Leader MAO TSE-TUNG and other Communist officials. He would try to

interview the eleven American fliers held by the Reds and the Americans

who have deflected to the side of the Reds. He would deport himself

in the best interests of the U. S. and would provide information to

his Goverment upon his return.

He has excellent reasons to believe that the Red Chinese

government would allow him to enter their country as a journalist. During

the Asian-African Conference at Bandung, Indonesia, he obtained an interview

with Red Chinese Premier CHOU-EN-LAT through the good offices of Prime

Minister U NU of Burma. He filed a full report of this interview with the

American Enbassy at Rangoon, Burma on 5/20/55 and previously he had

informed the American Consul at Singapore of certain statements CHOU-EN-LAI

made to him during the interview. The Red Chinese know that Prime Minister

U NU thinks well of him.

He was also told by one KANG MAO-CHAO, Counselor for Cultural

Affairs at the Red Chinese Embassy in New Delhi that he stood an excellent

chance of being admitted to his country, as "ky Premier was impressed by

the way your story was handled." KANG MAO-CHAO added that also in his

favor was the fact that CHOU-EN-LAI knew him as well as do others in his

government. His request for admittance to Red China is presently being

considered by the authorities at Peking.

JAFTE concluded his statement by relating that he hopes that

in making a decision the Department will realize that it would be in the

best interests of our Coverment and our people that an American journalis

be permitted to visit Red China to report firsthand on the state of

affairs there.

An Application dated 7/31/52 at New York City for a passport

In connection with passport number 631887, as above, it is

noted that she was six years old when it was issued. WFO did not ask

the Passport Office to make the application for it available.

SAMUEL, ADASON JAFFE was searched through WFO indices with the

following results:

A report of SA MARTIN CAREY dated 11/2/51 at New York entitled

Ukrainian delegation, and also those Soviet nationalists attached io the

U. N. Secretariat, all of which are in New York City. Pages 1, 8, 9, and

-On 12/30/53, FEDOSBE contacted SAN JAPE in New York regarding-

the letter he had sent to Ambassador ZARUBIN on November 24th. FEDOSEEV

said per JAFTE's request ZARUBIN had sent this letter on to Moscow but

to date no reply had been received, and further in line with JAFFE's

letter of December 28th, FEDOSEEV would advise him when anything is

received. JAFFE went on to indicate that he is coming to Washington

tomorrow and that he is going to visit at the Legation of Yemen since

the King of Yemen has granted him permission to visit Yemen to do the

Islamic phase of the religious story. JAFFE mentioned that he is doing a

series of articles and stories on the various religions. FEDOSEEV will

contact JAFFE when anything is received from Moscow.

On 1/20/54 SAM JAFFE, "Life" magazine, asked SMIRNOVSKY

whether the Embassyld heard anything from Moscow about the thing he had

spoken to him and Ambassador ZARUBIN about. sMIRNovskY said they had

JArFE pointed out that they wanted to do a completely fair job

on all five religions, Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, Confucianism, and

Taoism, and they could not do justice to the last three without actually

SWIRNOVSKY was very friendly and said he would try to

see that the people in Moscow were reminded again.

On 2/5/54, SAM JAFFEY (phonetic); asked SMIRNOVSKY if he

received the letters and was told he had.

JAFFEY asked if any action

would be taken. SMIRNOVSKY replied that

the Ambassador was not here to

act upon it and as a result the matter will be decided upon in moscow.

JAFFE said he heard reports and has read in the newspapers that there

are Chinese advisors in Berlin at the present time.

SMIRNOVSKY replied

! that he had read this also. JAFFE expressed considerable concern about

receiving action on his proposal. and then asked if SMIRNOVSKY knew of

any place in the U. S. where one could buy Russian vodka and SMIRNOVSKY

said he did not.

On 2/18/54 SAM JAFFEY (phonetic), told SMTPNOVSKY that he

planned to be in Washington next Thursday

and wondered if SMIRNOVSKY

would have lunch with him.

SMIRNOVSKY said he would and suggested that

he call him when he gets in town. JAFFEY said he is working on a story

regardingthe Indian caste system; that he already has the Hindu story

•laid out covering about 40 pages; that at a conference yesterday it was

decided that photos would have to be taken in China, in, pictures of

temples but still they have not received an answer from the Peking

government.

JAFFEX wondered if Ambassador ZARUBIN could be of further

help in thismatter if a wire were sent to him in Gernany• SMERNOVSKY

said it would be all right to send the wire. They agreed to discuss

this further Thursday.

On 2/26/54 SAM JAFTE, "Life," tried to reach Ambassador ZARUBIN

finally spoke instead with FEDOSEEV, with whom he went over again "Life's"

project for photographic essays of religions of the world and their

desire to get into China. FEDOSEEV promised that he and the Ambassador

would do all they could, but that they just had not heard as yet. JAFFE

emphasized that all he wants is a definite answer even if it is no.

On 3/22/54, SAM JAFFE &

i, asked whether re

FEDOSEEV had heard any word from the Peoples Republic of China regarding

his request. JAFFE pointed out that the Chinese will be holding a big

Confucius ceremony in April and he would like to cover it to get material

for his story. JAFFE went into great detail explaining the importance

for covering the ceremony in China proper since it is the birth place of

Confucius. He said they would probably cover it in Korea and on Formosa.

FEDOSELY agreed to talk the request overagain with the Ambassador and

call JAFFE when something comes in.

this matter.

On 4/9/54 SAM JAFFE again attempted to reach FEDOSETY and was

told by SMIRNOVSKY that he was not in the Embassy. JAFFE said this

call did not pertain to the Chinese proposal but to a drawing published

in the end of the March issue of the "Red Starl of the "H Bomb."

SMIRNOVSKY said he had not received that issue as yet but to contact Mr.

TARASOV in the New York office and see if he has that issue. JAFFE said

he had contacted TARASOV regarding this matter and that TARASOV was

checking on it. JAFFE said he would then recontact TARASOV.

On 6/28/54 SAV JAFFE (phonetic), told FEDOSEIV that he was

calling to say hello. He was in Washington up at the "Life" office for

two weeks and he wondered if FEDOSEEV would like to have dinner with him

and his wife one day during his stay here. FEDOSEEV asked JAIFE for his

telephone number - REpublic 7-6050 - and said he would call JAFFI in a

couple of days.

FEDOSEEV asked JAFFE when it would be convenient for

him. JAFFE said he would be free any time.

On 7/2/54 SAM JAFFE asked FEDOSEEV if it would be all right

if they postponed their dinner because he was just notified that

EISENHOWER was making a trip this week and that he, JAFFE, was selected

to make the trip too.

He will probably be back on Monday. FEDOSHEV

said he would be working on Monday and will call JAFFE about noon. JAFFE

is living at the Mayflower Hotel, Room 877. He will be glad to have

dinner with FEDOSEEV Monday night if the latter can arrange it.

On 7/5/54 FEDOSEEV tried to reach Room 877 at the Mayflower but

no one answered at the room.

On 7/6/54 SAM JAFFE informed FEDOSEEV that he had expected

to call him yesterday but that the President had decided to stay

another day. JAFFE asked FEDOSENV when they could meet and gave him a

choice of Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday. JAFFE suggested that they

meet (did not say where) at 7 o'clock and. FEDOSEEV said he would call

him back at his office either today or tomorrow to make it definite.

FEDOSEEV asked JAFFE when he would be leaving Washington and JAFFE said

he thought it would be on Saturday.

On 7/12/54 SAM JAFFE told FEDOSEEV that he had just talked to

Mr. HUNT about getting a picture of the ZARUBINs either today or tomorrow

In the big room of the Embassy. FEDOSEEV promised to check with the

Ambassador and call JAFFE back either today or tomorrow.

On 8/19/55 SAM JAFFE, Nation magazine, calling from New York,

told K. G. FEDOSEEV that he applied for a visa to enter Russia on June

6th, in New Delhi, India, where he was during an Asian tour for the

magazine. He checked on the visa in Rome and in Paris, but got no word.

He checked in London, where they had no information, but Mr. MOLCHANOV

there promised to check with Moscow on it. Also, while in London, JAFFE

said he contacted KINGSLEY/MARIIN, Of the "New Statesman," who had just

In London, a First Secretary, My. DENCHINSKY (ph), who also talked to JAFFE

about the visa and promised

the U. So, he received word from DENCHINSKY that the matter was being

considered at the highest level, and word of the results would be given to

the Soviet Embassy in Washington, or directly to the magazine in New York.

JAFFE asked FEDOSEEV to help him. FEDOSEEV asked if JAFFE planned on

being in Washington, D. C., SOON. JAFFE said he hoped to be here next week.

It was arranged that he will call FEDOSEEV the day before coming down to

arrange to get together and FEDOSEEV will try to find out about the visa

Fedosee is a Counselor at the sovied Embassy and his wife

is in charge of the press Department which has replaced the defunct

Soulei Information Bulletin.

Both are important fiqures at the soulet

Embassy and are suspeted of soulet intelligence activities.

The

importance of identifying uninown individuals uno have personal contact

with officials of souiet establishments and in particular with persons.

like redoseev and his wife is an important and necessary part of our

coverage of soured activities. It becomes cuen more important to

identify such persons when they act in a suspicious manner or attempt

to detect a possible surueillance.

RECOLMENDATIONE

I. Asêt appears that the surveillance was conducted discreetly

under dufflould circumstances and no specific foot has been deucloped

indicating that the surveillance was in fact compromised, the statement

Of the trime" and lillfe" magazines representative would appear to re

Plect only taffe's suspicions that he was under surveillance. no

administrative action is recommended.

In view of the actions of darfe in the matter and as we

now know the reason fof his contacts with the souletss no further

consideration should de given to an interuiew with him for

possible

development as e source of information regarding soviet activities.

Re telephone call fromur. C. E. HENNRICH of the

Bureau today regarding this

matter.

Attached is a memorandum submitted by special Agents

ARTHUR J. ACHENBACH, KEVIN I. TLANAGAN, DONALD A. GRUENTZEL,

JOHN H.

KENOYER, ROBERT G. MCGEARY ANd JOSEPH E. SCULLY

describing the surveillance maintained by them on FEDOSEETA,

her husband, SAil JAFFEE and his wife on the evening of July 9, (e)

1954.

I have talked to the Agents wro handled this sur

veillance which was being conducted in accordance with in-

structions issued under the soviet intensification Program.

purpose of these surveillances is to determine whether the

subjects under surveillance are engaged in intelligence or

espionage activities and to identify any contacts which may be

obserued in the course of the surueillance.

.:(C)

As explained by the Agents, and as will be noted from

the attachment, the surveillance was initiated at 8:37 P.M., at

which time this party were observed walking from the chastleton

Hotel to the colony Restaurant.

During this period, which con-

stituted approximately twenty minutes, no activities whatever

on the part of the subjects under surveillance indicated añy

awareness

or any consciousness of being surveilled.

As the

party left the restaurant at 11:18 P.l., they were noted to

be

on the lookout for a surveillance,

even

going

to the extent of

scrutinizing passing persons and traffic.

The Agents noticed

this awareness immediately and proceeded

with appropriate

discretion.

It would appear that something may have been

said

during the time the party were in the restaurant about being

followed by the FBI,

which may account for the

sudden awareness

of a surveillance on the part of this group.

It has been

Re: Nonna Nikolacuna Fedoseeva

they have been told by the russions they probably would be

surveilled as a result of their contact with the Russians. (6)

The remarks made to the taxi driver, as reported

by him, plus the activities of this group, reflect a definite

effort on their part to determine whether they were actually

under surveillance.

The admission by the taxi driver that he

did not detect any surveillance seemed to indicate, that it was

handled properly and with discretion. This would appear to be

borne out further by the fact that when ur. JAFFEE and his wife

entered the Mayflower Hotel they looked out of the mayflower

Hotel onto the street and were obviously not aware of the fact

that Bureau Agents had them under surveillance in the lobby

the hotel.

The surveillance of Mr. and irs. JAFFEE was discon

tinued at 12:42 A.M., when it was learned jrom the cab ariver

that they possibly were "newspaper people"

, but thereafter in-

quiries were made in the hotel to determine the identity of the

JAFFEES.

In view of the difficult circumstances under nich

this surveillance was conducted, it does not appear that it.

was

handled indiscreetly and, therefore, no administrative

action is recommended.

The following summarizes the physical surveillance conducted

on July 9, 1954, concerning the ti

FEDOSEEV, 1 SAM JAFFEE, and Mrs. JAFTEE.

MRS. FEDOSEEV

At 8:37 P.M., SAS DONALD A, 'GRUENTZEL, and ROBERT G. MeGEART

observed Mr. and Mrs. FEDOSEEV and an unknown young couple, subsequently

identified as SAM JAFFEE and wife, leave the Chastleton Hotel, loth and

R Street, N. W., Washington, D. C. They walked directly to the Colony

Restaurant, 1737 DeSales Place, N. We, by way of 16th Street, N Street

the restaurant, because it was felt that this could not be done discreetly.

At I1:18 P.M., SAS JOSEPH E. SCULLY, DONALD A. GRUENTZEI

and ROBERT G. McGEARY observed the party

• leaving the Colony Restaurant.

These Agents, who were on foot, observed the group walk west on DeSales

Place, N. Wo, north on Connecticut Avenue to N Street, N. W. They

observed that FEDOSEEV and JAFFEE walked together very slowly and appeared

to be in deep conversation. It was also noted that FEDOSEEVA and Mrs.

JAFFEE were walking together about 10 feet behind their husbands and

were also conversing. The Agents noticed that the party on departing

the Colony Restaurant appeared to be scrutinizing passing traffic and

appeared to be oratin tog

other pedestrians in the area. Consequently, the Agents maintained a

(c)

discreet distance from the group.

On reaching Connecticut Avenue, SA JOHN H. KENOYER took over

the surveillance on foot and observed the party continuing to walk north

on Conneuticut Avenue, around Dupont Circle, N. We, at which time SA

DONALD A. GRUENTZEL rejoined the surveillance on foot.

The two Agents

observed the party walk northeast on New Hampshire Avenue, N. Wo, to

I6th Street, N. Wo, and then south on the west side of loth Street,

N. Wo, to R Street, N. W.

While walking from Dupont Circle to this

point, the Agents noticed that the party

carefully observed other

pedestrians and passing automobiles.

At no time did a Bureau automobile (C/

pass the party or come within its sight. The cars were utilized solely

Agents GRUENTZEL and KENOYER observed the party standing

on the corner of loth and R Streets, N. Wo, conversing for about three

minutes. At 12:04 A.M., Mr. and Mrs. JAFFE were observed entering

Skyking Taxi Cab #60.

At this time,

the Agents on foot brought up

a surveillance car occupied by SAs SCULTY and ACHENBACH. These Agents

observed the taxi proceeding south on loth Street to M Street, N. W.

At this point, SA MCGEARY, in another Bureau car, took over the

surveillance and observed the cab proceeding west on M Street to 17th

Street, No lo, then south on 17th Street, N. Wo, i0 I Street, N. Wos

at which point SA KEVIN E. FLANAGAN, In another bureau car, took over

the surveillance. SA FLANAGAN observed the taxi proceeding west on

I Street and south on 17th Street to E Street, N. W. At this point,

the first surveillance car took over the surveillance and observed

the taxi proceeding east on I Street, No Wo, then circle through the

Ellipse bacis to 17th Street, N. He At this point, SA McGEARY, in a

Bureau car, rejoined the surveillance, and the Agents in both cars

pbserved the taxi cab proceeding north on 17th Street, N. Wo, and

Connecticut Avenue to the Mayflower Hotel.

The Agents noticed that

from the time Mr. and Mrs. JAFFET entered the taxi cab until they

alighted at the Mayflower Hotel, they frequently lcoked through the

rear window of the taxi cab. The cab varied its speed noticeably

throughout the ride.

scully.

At 12:26 A.M., Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE were observed by SAs

ACHENBACH, FLANAGAN and KENOYER leaving the taxi in front of the hotel.

They looked up and down the street and then walked south on Connecticut

Avenue, almost to I Streets N. Wo, whereupon they turned around and

started back toward the hotel. At this time, SAS ACHENBACH and KENOYER

entered the hotel through the DeSales Street entrance and seated

themselves in the lobby. Agent FLANAGAN entered the hotel through

the Connecticut Street entrance and proceeded to the desk. About three

minutes later, Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE were observed by these Agents

entering the hotel through the Connecticut Avenue entrance. Immediately

after entering the hotel, Mr. JAFFEE and his wife were observed

standing in the entrance-way and looking up and down Connecticut Avenue.

They then proceeded to the center of the lobby where they separated.

Agents KENOYER and ACHENBACH observed MT. JAFFEE walk toward the 17th

Street end of the lobby and out of sight.

All three Agents observed

Mrs. JAFFEE walk to the hotel desk, at which SA FLANAGAN was filling

out a reservation form under an alias. After completing the form, SA

FLANAGAN walked out of the hotel. At this time, SAS ACHENBACH and

KENOYER observed Mrs. JAFFEE purchase a package of cigaretts at the desk.

She was then rejoined by her husband, and both Agents observed the couple

leave the hotel. During the time that Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE were in the

lobby, the Agents noticed that the JAFFEES were very observant of

persons in the lobby. In vier of the late hour, few people were in

the lobby:

At 12:32 A.Mos SA GRUENTZEL observed Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE

come out of the Connecticut Avenue exit of the hotel and, after looking

up and down Connecticut Avenue, walk south on Connecticut Avenue to

I Street, NoW. At this time, SA ACHENBACH joined the foot surveillance

of Agent GRUENTZEL.

They observed the JAFFEES crossing Connecticut

Avenue at I Street and disappear from view going west on I Street.

Approximately two minutes later, SA ACHENBACH observed Mr. and Mrs.

JAFFEE in a doorway located on the L Street side of a business establish-

ment at the intersection of L Street and Connecticut Avenue, N. W.

He observed that they were looking intently through the plate glass

windows of the store in the direction of the Mayilower Hotel. At this

points Agent ACHENBACH, who was standing on a streetcar platform at the

corner of I Street and Connecticut Avenue, N. We, boarded a south-

bound streetcar. Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE were next observed by SAs Seurty

gId GRUENTZEL running across I Street to the south side and walking

west on I Street to 18th Street.

After reaching l8th Street, they re-

crossed to the north side of I Street and returned to the Mayflower

Hotel via I Street and Connecticut Avenue, N. I.

They entered the

Mayflower Hotel at 12:42 A.M.

Surveillance was discontinued at this

time upon receipt of information from SA MCGIARY to the effect that

Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE were possibly "newspaper people."

After Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE alighted from the taxi cab in

front of the Mayflower Hotel, SA MCGEARY located and interviewed the

cab drivers ROBERT S. DAVIS, at 17th and M Streets, N. W. DAVIS

informed SA MCGEARY that imnediately after picking up the couple at

l6th & R Streets, N. W., they inforned him that they were "newspaper

people" and that they had spent the evening with a "couple of Russians"

and that they probably would be followed.

The cab driver stated

further that he asked the couple if he should try to "lose them."

Mrs. JAFFEE replied, "Yes, if you can." DAVIS also advised SA MCGEARI

that Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE were attempting to obtain license numbers,

but that he did not think they were successful. He stated that he

• After Mrs. JAFFEE had purchased the cigaretts in the hotel

and had departed with her husband, SA KENOYER asked the night manager

at the hotel desk whether he was acquainted with the couple and whether

they were registered at the hotel. The night manager replied that he

did not know.

Approximately 20 minutes after the couple had entered

the hotel for the second time, SA FLANAGAN, under suitable pretexts

interviewed the elevator operator, who advised that a couple

answering the description of Mr. and Mr's. JAFFEE had gotten off

the elevator at the eighth 1100r.

• Upon receipt of the information from SA MeGEARY, _as

obtained from the cab driver, that the couple were possibly associated

with the Press, SA KENOYER contacted the appropriate supervisor and

was instructed to discontinue the surveillance in view of the

possibility that the unknown couple were associated with the Press.

It was noted in the early stages of the surveillance that

the individuals involved were extremely surveillance conscious and

the Agents made every attempt to be very discreet. As set forch in

detail above, the automobiles and Agents involved were rotated as

much as possible to avoid detection by the persons under surveillance.

Even though it was apparent to the Agents that the parties under

surveillance were apparently looking for a tail, it was not felt

desirable to discontinue the surveillance until

the couple were

identified. The importance of identifying unknown individuals who

have personal contact with officials of the Soviet establishments

has been inpressed on the Field by the Bureau as a necessary part of (C

the Soviet Intensification Program.

On July 10, 1954s SA KENOYER ascertained that the files

of this office reflect that SAM JAFFER Of Life magazine on July 6,

2954, discussed with KONSTANTIN G. FEDOSEEV the prospect of having

dinner together. No definite plans were made for this dinner. The

files also reflected that JAFFEE was residing in Roon 877 of the

MayIlower Hotel, which is the same floor to rich the unknown couple

Refereace my memoraulum of 9-12-74 concerning contacts bill,

had obtained from Michael Canfield which Canfield believes are pertinent to

captioned matter.

Late on 9-12-74 Donahue advised Bowers he had learned from

Sam A.

Jaffe, free-lance writer in Washington who has been involved with

"Canfield concerning this matter, that Canfield apparently has made a deal with

Stern Magazine, a German publication described as the Life Magazine of Germany,

for its use of the photographs Canfield has collected and the information

concerning them.

This magazine allegedly has arranged for a Swiss phoiographic

expert to examine the pictures in an effort to determine if the three 'bums" shown

in the photographs might be identical to I. Howard Hunt, Frank Sturgis, and

Thomas Arthur Vallee.

(4).

Supervisor John Ruhl of Washington Field Office advised Bowers

on the night of 9-12-74 that he had received a call from Jaffe who was seeking an

FBI evaluation of Canfield's reliability and the information Canfield had regarding

the Kennedy assassination. Jaffe told Ruhl he had given Canfield $300 as an

advance toward a possible story which he might write regarding the photographs

and information Canfield has developed. Ruhl furnished Jaffe no information. He

is submitting a communication to the Bureau on 9-13-74 furnishing full details of

• his conversation with Jaffe. Ruhl also advised that Canfield had contacted him on

9-12-74 and promised to furnish him a set of the phoiographs he has obtaines in

accordance with a promise he had made to Ruhl some tine ago NOT RECORDED

that Laboratory examination of the photographs which were furmished to the bureau

J. J. McDermott to Mr. Jenkins Memo

RE: ASSASSINATION OF JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY

"'bums" in the photograph with the police officer. No photograph of Vallee was

available for comparison in this regard.

The Laboratory made copies of all

the information furnished by Donahue, and the originals of the photographs and notes

were returned to him on 9-13-74 by Bowers. Donahue had told Canfield he was

going to have a contact examine the pictures but did not identify his contact.

Donahue intends to tell Canfield that his contact does not believe the "bums" are

identical with Hunt and Sturgis and that he does not want to become involved in this

matter since he feels it is a situation which should be handled by the FBI.

RECOMMENDATION:

For information.

Sam Jaffe

A confidential source, who has furnished reliable

information in the past, advised a Special Agent (SA) Of

Al table

che Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), that the July

15: 1972 issue of "UPI Log"

the house organ of

united Press International,

reflected that "Sam Jaffe

Special UPI Correspondent has been granted

visit China. He will arrive in early August and will

file for the news wires, news pictures, and audio"

The source advised that

Jaffe is not on the

regular UPI staff, but has done free-lance work for the

UPI, such as covering the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA)

with a tape recorder. It was the source's opinion that

the visa from Mainland China was not arranged for Jaffe

by the UPI as they would have sent somebody of more

consequence, if theyhad been able to get a visa. The

source also noted that during the • UNGA, Jaile

leaned to the Soviet Mission to the United Nations for

"behind the scene". type news

rather than trying to be

friendly with the new Chinese delegatinn.

The source described Jaffe as a former Moscow

correspondent for the Columbia Broadcasting System,

who

is, or has had, numerous close contacts with soviet nationals.

Source statedthat Jaffe later worked as a correspondent

for the American Broadcasting Company in Southeast Asia

and also did free-lance work for UPI in New York.

Union affairs.

JAFFE recalled that some time ago DANILOFF

attempted to interest JAFFE in their pooling expenses and

arranging social affairs for Soviet nationals here. Purpose

of this was to give them an entre to the Soviets for background

information which might serve their correspondent careers.

JAFFE was not interested.

JAFFE stated that on the night of 2/25/71, DANILOFF

telephoned him and stated that he had turned down an offer to

become the head of the UPI office in Moscow. DANILOFF stated

the conditions were not right. JAFFE took this to mean that

the salary offered for the position was not enough.

SAMUEL, ADASON JAFFE

On February 25, 1971, Samuel Adason Jaffe,

• free

lance correspondent was shown photographs of Boris..

Yarochevskiy, a correspondent for the Tass News Agency, an

official Soviet news agency, and the latter's wife, Inna G.

Yarochevskaya. Jaffe recognized the Yarochevskiys and re-

called he had previously volunteered information concerning

them.

(On April 29, 1969, Jaffe advised he met the

Yarochevskiys at a Hungarian Embassy reception in Washington,

D. C. (WDC) on April 17, 1969. Yarochevskaya had looked

familiar to Jaffe. Yarochevskaya recognized Jaffe as having

formerly been a correspondent in Moscow, Union of Soviet Social-

ist Republics (USSR), and indicated that she had been one of

the translators for the Reuters News Agency in Moscow working

for John Miller, and that later she had been a translator for

Lares Bruger (phonetic), a Swedish newspaper correspondent and

a friend of Jaffe.)

(On April 29, 1969, Jaffe indicated that Yarochevskiy

was attending the Foreign Language Institute in Moscow while

Yarochevskaya was working for Reuters. Later, YAROCHEVSKIY

attended Mc Gill University in Canada, and his wife had flown

from Moscow to meet her husband in Canada and they then traveled

to the United States.

On April 17, 1969, Yarochevskaya indicated

that she and her husband had been in WDC for approximately

a month and a half.)

SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE

(On May 14, 1969, Jaffe advised that recently he had

had the Yarochevskiys to his residence for lunch, Present

also were an American correspondent and the latter's wife.)

On February 25, 1971, Jaffe stated he has had no

further contacts with Yarochevskaya, and has seen Yarochevskiy

only once since he had them to his residence for lunch in May

of 1969. Jaffe said he had seen Yarochevskiy in attendance at

an anti-Vietnam war demonstration in Washington, D. C., in

1969, date unrecalled. Yarochevskiy was walking alone and

carrying a camera, "and it was not until he was right on top of

the Soviet did Jaffe realize his identity. They exchanged only

greetings.: Yarochevskiy told Jaffe that they must get together

sometime.

Jaffe stated he had never known Yarochevskiy prior

to their meeting at the Hungarian Embassy reception on April 17,

1969.

He had known Yarochevskaya previously, but only as one

of a number of individuals whose services as translators,

chauffeurs or house maids were made available to foreign

COT-

respondents assigned to Moscow by a Soviet government agency

which Jaffe knew as "UPDK". It is Jaffe's impression now, that

Yarochevskaya had been assigned by 'UPDK, as a translator, to

Lares Bruger (phonetic), a Swedish national and a correspondent

for a Swedish newspaper, probably in 1965.

Jaffe recalled that both he and Bruger (phonetic) left

Moscow in 1965. Jaffe now has the impression that Yarochevskaya

was not married when he knew her in 1965. Jaffe did not know

her socially. He did not know her by her maiden nane.

He recog-

nized her at the Hungarian Embassy reception in 1969 but only

after Yarochevskaya had

refreshed his memory by recalling Moscow.

Jaffe said he believes that the ""UPDK" was controlled

by the KGB (Ministry of State Security); however, all of the

persons employed by "U'DK" were not necessarily connected with

Soviet intelligence. Jaffe stated he has no information that

Yarochevskaya is, or was, connected with Soviet intelligence.

. Jaffe offered his opinion that Yarochevskaya may be

connected with Soviet intelligence.

He stated his opinion is

influenced by the fact that in her

1965 employment as a trans-

lator in Moscow, Yarochevskaya had the opportunity of becoming

acquainted with foreign correspondents assigned to Moscow. His

opinion is influenced also by Yarochevskaya's subsequent

marriage to a personable and younger Soviet who received an

assignment to the United States as a Tass correspondent. Jaffe

stated Yarochevskaya is the only Soviet national whöm he knows

who was employed by "UPDK"' as a translator for foreign corres-

pondents, who later came to the United States.

Jaffe stated that when he served in Moscow he and

other foreign correspondents often heard references to a "Black

Tass''

The runors were that the Tass News Agency abroad per-

formed two functions.

One was to gather news for dissemination

to the Soviet people through Soviet newspapers and periodicals.

The other, "Black Tass", was a form of intelligence gathering,

the results of which were never made known to the Soviet people

but were furnished

directly to the KGB in Moscow for transmittal

to Kremlin officials. Jaffe stated that an example of the "Black

Tass" operation would be a Tass correspondent in Washington, D.C.

feeling out his contacts to ascertain what the thinking of gov-

ernment officials night be in regard to some phase of the United

States'

foreign policy. Jaffe said that "Black Tass" would not

necessarily relate to espionage.

Jaffe stated the only contact he has had in recent

months with Soviet nationals occurred approximately in the end

of January, 1971, exact date unrecalled.

Jaffe had just stepped

away from making a telephone call in the lobby of the Statler

Hilton Hotel, 16th and K Streets, N. W., Washington, D. C.,

when Oleg M. Sokolov, a First Secretary, Soviet Embassy, walked

into view. Sokolov greeted him warnly and asked Jaffe where he

had been keeping himself and why no one had seen him. Jaffe

replied that he has been in the Washington, D. C. area but that

Sokolov stated that that was not his (Sokolov's) fault and

added tbat there "are two people who like you, Bubnov and

I".

Sokolov gave Jaffe his business card and said that they

must get together.

Jaffe stated Sokolov was referring to Igor D.

Jaffe stated that he does not intend to initiate

any contacts with the Soviets.

On January 12, 1971, Jaffe arrived in Paris,

France, and contacted LE CHAN

at which time it was suggested

to Jaffe that the proposal first be discussed with THICK

THIRT CHAU, President of the

_Association of Vietnamese

Buddhists in France.

Jaffe met with THICK THIEN CHAU for a two hour

luncheon

engagement on January 12, 1971. THICK THIEN CHAU

was generally receptive to the proposal, however, he

suggested that the proposal be handled through the National

Liberation Front (NLE) representative in Paris, HA THANH

•IAM. Jaffe was not immediately receptive to this; however,

THICK THIEN CHAU indicated that the possibility of any

success with his proposal would depend on this course of

action.

On January 14, 1971, at 10:30 a,m. Jaffe met with

HA THATH LAN, Director of Information, NIF, Paris, France;

however, due to a language barrier further discussions were

arranged for 4:30 p.m. that day when each could obtain the

services of a translator.

At 4,30 p.m. Jaffe returned to the offices of HA

THANH LAM with Ann/David an acquaintance of his from Sorbonne

University, Paris, France.

"HA THANH LAM had at his office

a Buddhist nun, THICK MAN DAfLA, who spoke excellent English

and who appeared to be very influential during the course of

discussion.

= Frace

• Jaffe emphasized to HA THANH LAM the great concern

of the people of the United States for the U.S. prisoners of

war in North Vietnamese prison camps and the necessity of

allowing an unbiased group, including himself, of U.S. citizens

to visit all the prisoners in all the camps and not just a

so-called "representative number who may have been brainwashed."

According to Jaffe, Bruk, who claims

Boris (Sergeyevich) Burtor, former head of APN. Bruk added

In Jaffa's opinion, Bruk has always been a "nane-

Bruk indicated he had contacted, apparently tele-

phonically, Armand Hanner, head of Occidental Petroleum

tion of being a "girl chaser." During his cuzzent trip to

Bruk asked Jaffe about his current setivities and

*Jafie indicated he ras doing sone free-lance writlag and

giving lectures.

In response to Brul's questions, Jalfe said

hig

leccuzes are arranged by American Frogran Bureau, whose

made office is located in Boston, Massachusetts, and he nor-

mally moelves a lectuce fee of $750 less expenses but some-

times get $750 plus expenses per lecture.

When asked if he

lectures on the UsSt, Jalfe told Bruk very few people are not

Intorested in this topie and he generally lectures about

Souchence Asio, Vietnan and Canbodie.

Bruit appeared to be

greatly luprassed by the amount of Jalfe's lecture fees and

be aaked Jasta:

"Gould you arrange (speaking) tours for me?"

Then che

letter hositated, Exuli indicated he

felt sure that

even though he is a Communist, United States authorities

would pernic him to visit the United States for a lecture

Jaffe suggosted that Bruk contact the Anerican Program

Burezu of Boston and Colsen Lee of dew Yore Ciey, pointing

out that they are managers in this field. grue appeared

genuinely interested in lecturing in the United States and

Jaffe coumented he would not be at all surprised to see hin

appeazing as a gueat lectures at United

states universitles.

Bruic indicated he had visited the United States last year,

and

expected to come agein, possibly nast year; then he expacts

is make an inspection tour of all Novosei burcaus abroad.

In discussing Aleksands Saveytset, Jaife Indicated

he first met Shveytses a number of years ago in Helsinki

with tho assistance of Shveytsec during the Youth Festival. in

Helsink, Source described Shveytzer as head of the English

Department at the Foreign Language Institute; a "very nice

8uy," very humble and reserved in his conduct. Bruk, by

vidual hon ho finds quite distasteful.

with KCB (Soviet Comittee for State Security). Ic was

obvious to Jaffe that Shveytser was very much upset by hruk's

statement. Jaffe told Brue his statenent vas ridiculous per

se adding that Shveytser was a very scholazly individual who

rorely had contacts with foreigners, Brul replied facetiously

that this was the type of person KGB used; however, Jaffe got

the impression frik vas not sincere in his comments about

Shveytser.

Jaffe said he inquired of Brul concerning several

of hla Soviet contacts and the latter replied, "I don't see..

then any nore." Shveytser asked Bruk why be still ves

Ertendly with him (Shveytser) when be had failed to retain

mony of his other friends. Intron t replied: "Hell, you

don't goad me and don't ride all over me." Shreytser replied:

"I have let you have it on occasion wen you are wrong."

Jaffe added that although aruk is a sharp individual,

Shaveyter is on e much higher Intellectual plone, and expressed

the opinion that Eruk probably did not fully comprchend many

of Shveytser's conments.

Jaffe stated he has always been convinced that rul

was a member of or ryery close" to KGB and claims to have

frequently warned his American associates to be careful of

their contacts with Bruk since he was "always probing and pick-

ing your brains and reporting bacit to KGB.

Jaffe learned from Brule that Luduila Alekseyevna

Guishiant, daughter of Soviet leader Alexey Kosygin, would

not depart the United States with the captioned group but

would remain in the United States to do research. Jaffe

understood she sas a historian. He added that unlike some

members of captioned group, who reside in hotels during

their tour, Lyuanila vishiani lives at the Soviet Mission

to the United Nations (SMUl) In New York City. Jaffe learned

who has furnished reliable information in the past,

identified Mikhail Ilich Bruk as an employee of the

International Department of the Soviet Ministry of Health

and & KGB agent "of one of apparatus of one of regions

of hoscow."

Although not an agent of the Second Chief

Directorate (SCD), KGB, Bruk knew several doctors stationed

at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow and Bruk was used by officers

0f the First (American Enbassy) Section, First Department,

SCD, in their operations against American doctors stationed

at the U.s Embassy in Moscow.

WE I-2, another government agency which conducts

intelligence investigations, advised that WP T-l furnished

the following handwritten comments concerning his knowledge

of the KGB operation against Samuel Adason Jaffe:

"Sam Jaffee, an American correspondent, arrived

in Moscow in 1961.

The Chief of the ist Section, Ist

On April 29, 1969, a confidential source, who

he had been informed of the following information by

Samuel Jaffe, identified below: -S-

Samuel Adason Jaffe, American Broadcasting Company

correspondent, recently learned of Dr. Paul Lin, a professor

at McGill University, Montreal, Canada, Subsequently, Jaffe

obtained additional information

concerning LIN from a long-

Dickinson University, New Jersey, and from VAN LUNG, one

of the owners of the Yenching Palace Restaurant, 3524

Connecticut Avenue, Northwest, Washington, D. C., with whom

Jaffe dined in April, 1969..-sr

On April 8, 1969, Jaffe telephonically contacted

IIN advising Lin that he had recently seen a New York Times

article dealing with the restoration of Canada-China

diplomatic relations and in which LIN's name appeared.

Jaffe inforned IIN that he had been in Hong Kong for about

four years and was desirous of interviewing IIN. Additionally,

Jaffe informed LIN that he had interviewed CHOU En-lai in

1955 and was one of about 18 journalists invited to visit

the China Mainland in 1956. Jaife also advised LIN that he

knew one SZETO KUNG of the New China News Agency in Hong S

LIN advised Jaffe to contact him later at which

!

time he would have a definite answer as to a possible

interview.. -5-

!

On April 18, 1969, Jaffe recontacted LIN telephonically

at which time LIN indicated

a reluctance to grant an interview

with Jaffe, feeling that granting such an interview would

leave the door open to interviews by many other journalists.

IIN, however, indicated a'desire to talk with Jaffe and after

exchanging telephone numbers and addresses a luncheon

engagement was set for April 28, 1969, at the faculty lounge

at Mcfill University, Montreal, Canada. - 5-

On April 28, 1969, Jaffe flew to Montreal and met

LIN for lunch as previously

arranged. Jaffe expressed to LIN

his strong desire to visit the China Mainland as a correspondent

and suggested that it might be possible that the Chinese

Government would permit foreign jousnalists to enter the

China Mainland in connection with the October celebrations.

LIN expressed the opinion that the October celebrations

would make no difference in the Government's policy concerning

the admittance of journalists.

LIN suggested that Jaffe

write a letter by the first of June, 1969, to the Chinese

Government indicating that he desired to enter the China

Mainland as a private citizen, stating

that he had interviewed

CHOU En-lai in 1955 as an American journalist and that if

he is permitted to enter China, he would like to continue

to pursue his career as a journalist. -s ?

LIN indicated that the best way to establish contact

would be through the Chinese Imbassy in Paris; however, when

Jaffe indicated that he knew no one there and the possibility

existed that the letter would no le forwarded to the proper

channels LIN

stated he would "Be going East in early summer"

and he would be willing to see to it that the letter would

be properly dispatched. LIN also suggested that Jaffe's

letter be sent to him for perusal prior to its dispatch as

he possibly could be of assistance in wording the letter

correctly.

LIN emphasized that Jaife should indicate in his

letter that he was writing as a private citizen; however, he

should not try to hide that fact ": st he is a journalist

and state in the letter that he hid previously been a journalist

for "The Nation" and that he would like to write and produce

films about China. - 5-

LIN also stated that Jaffe should

include in his

letter the fact that he would be willing to leave his United

States Passport in Hong Kong and when Jaffe indicated to LIN

that he did not think that would be necessary, LIN stated

that maybe "they would not want you to come into China with

•a U:S. Passport."

=S.

Accosding to Jaffe, LIN is a very brilliant

individual well-versed in Soviet-Chinese relations and in

United States relations with China and the Soviet Union.

LIN appeared to be more concerned with Sino-Soviet relations

than with the United States.

LIN commented that Cyrus Eaton

is very much interested in bringing China and the United

States together and stated that baton had. sent him an article

from a Cleveland newspaper on anti-China hysteria whipping

up in the United States. -S~

•In commenting on the recent newspaper accounts of

the speech of LIN Piao, Vice Primier, Communist China, LIN

stated that he thought it was premature to make any judgment

on the speech in its entirety; however, LIN ranked MAO Ise-tung,

CHOU En-lai, and LIN Piao almost equally:: LIN stated that

he did not for a minute think that they believe the United

States or the Soviet Union would launch an atomic attack.

They do believe the Soviet Union is a serious threat but

they do-not think either the United States or the Soviet

Union plan to launch a premature attack. on them. In talking

about moderates, LIN stated that CHOU In-lai is not a

moderate; he is a. tactician. LIN stated that MAO probably

is the only man who seally understands the Chinese people

and believed MAO felt he had to start the Cultural Revolution

because there were people in China who were doing things for

their own self interest and MAO had to take action, including

the unleashing of the Red fuard to prevent this. LIN indicated

that he felt M40 has been successful. LIN stated that the

Soviet Union is much like the United States but MAO knew -5-

that if these people were allowed to gain

a foothold that

China would revert to the days of CHIANG Kai-shek when

there was unlimited corruption and he felt this had to be

settled once and for all.

LIN, stated that MAO, CHOU, and

LIN Piao were unanimous and there was no disagreement among

them. -s-

IIN stated to Jaffe that he would not set; foot

in the United States until the Vietnam war was ended; however,

later when LIN asked Jaffe if he was aware of the fact that

he (LIN) had been in Hong Kong in January, 1969, and Jaffe

replied in the affirmative, LIN stated "I am sorry, I am

not being completely honest.

You know that I was in 'Seattle."

LIN then explained that en route from Hong Kong to Canada

he decided to return through Seattle to Canada against the

advice of his friends in Hong Kong who indicated that there

might be trouble. LIN stated that he was detained at the

airpost (Seattle) for two hours, was interrogated, and all

personal effects were gone through. IlN stated he was sure

everything was photographed and he was furious. LIN stated

that he subsequently contacted an attorney, "the number one

professor of law at Harvard University,!' who was also incensed

• over the incident. - S

LIN inquired of Jaffe if he knew other news

correspondents, such as Harrison Salisbury, Doar Barnett,

or Frank Trader. LIN indicated that he knew Salisbusy well.

and stated that he was sure Salisbury would speak well of

him (LIN). LIN also discussed Mortin Schafer, Canadian

correspondent, who entered China as a tourist and who

apparently concealed

a camera in a cigarette lighter to take

• photographs in China. Jaife indicated. that that was

unfortunate as it has made it more difficult for foreign

journalists to obtain permission to enter China. In conmenting

on correspondent Milton Nash, LiN stated that he thought

Nash was "bright and understanding" S:.

LIN

I was shown a United States newspaper article

concerning China and LIN expressed a desice to have a copy

of that article. Jaffe promised to send him a copy of the

Reference, is made to memorandum dated April 29, 1969 C

of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Washington, D.C.

concerning captioned individual.

Intervier, April 16, 1969

On April 16, 1969, Samuel Adason Jaffe telephonically

furnished the following information to an Agent of the Washington V

Field Office (FBI).

..

Party Given by Jaffe, Attended by Hungarian and

Polish nationals

Jaffe stated he recently held a party at his residence

which was attended by a representative of the Hungarian News

Agency, the Hungarian Press Attache, and the Polish Press Attachi,

whom he identified as Andrej Konopacki and described as a "hard-

nosed" individual in his political outlook.

Attempts to Contact Boris Nikolayevich. Sedov

Jaffe said he had attempted on three of four occasions

to telephonically contact Boris Nikolayevich Sedov at the Soviet

Embassy, but was unable "to catch him in." He left word with the

Soviet Embassy on one or two occasions for Sedov to contact him.

(Sedov has been reported to be a KGB officer. Jaffe

previously advised that sedov told him that while

thumbing through "our photograph files" he found

a photograph of Jaffe taken in Moscow interviewing

a Russian. Sedov indicated he thought Jaffe might

want the photograph and suggested that they get

together

for lunch soon.)

C

Farewell Party for Vladimit Ivanovich Bogachev

Jaffe advised that next week he will attend the going-

away party for Vladimir Ivanovich Bogachev, Novosti Press Agency

(APN) correspondent.

(Bogachev has been reported as connected with

Soviet Military Intelligence (GRU). The Novosti

Press Agency was newly established in Russia

in February, 1961.)

Contact with Vladimir Nikiforovich Vashchenko

Jaffe stated he attended the Hungarian Independence

Day reception. He arrived late and spent considerable time

talking to Captain Vladimir Nikiforovich Vashchenko; Naval

Attache assigned to the Soviet Embassy, Washington, D.C.

Vashchenko indicated he did not think the dispute between

Russia and China will mean anything. He does not see any real

trouble now between the two countries. According to Jaffe,

Vashchenko did not "spout" the "Soviet line." Jaffe said this

was the first time be kas.able to get a Soviet military man

to talk to him for any length of time.

(Vashchenko has been reported as connected

with GrU.)

Intervier, April 22, 1969

On April 22, 1969, Jaffe telephonically furnished.

the following information to an Agent of the, HEO, FBI.

Contact with Vladimir Fedorovich Petrovskiy

Jaffe said he recently visited New York City in connection

with his interest in interviewing a Chinese professor at McGill

University in Canada and had a long conversation with Vladimir

Fedorovich Petrovskiy and his wife, Mira

Mikhailovna Petrovskaya.

He also had contact with a Soviet named Loginov who used to be

with the Press Department of the Soviet Foreign Ministzy in Moscow.

(Petrovskiy has been identified as connected

with KGB.)

Attempt to Contact Boris Nikolayevich Sedov

Jaffe also stated he "was invited up to the Hungarian

Embassy" and while there he asked a Soviet Press Officer, "Where

is Sedov? He said,

, 'He doesn't work for me. He is in the

Information Departnent.'" Jaffe continued: "They (Soviets)

just say he isn't in. He has been in New York."

Contact with new. Tass News Agency Comespondent

Jaffe also indicated he recently met a newly arrived

"Tass" correspondent whom he described as "sort of Ivy League,"

and his wife, whom he described as a "very attractive blond

girl who remembered me from Moscow." Jaffe initially did not

remember her but later recalled she was a translator for Reuters

News Agency in Moscow and later worked for a Swedish correspondent

in Moscow who is a friend of Jaffe.. Jaffe remarked this couple

has only been in the United States about a month.

Intervier. April 29, 1969

On April 29, 1969, Jaffe telephoned an agent of the

WEO, FBI and on the same date voluntarily appeared at the WrO

interview.

Farevell Party for Vladimir Ivanovich Bogachev

Jaffe advised he attended a farevell party for Bogachev

at the Aviation Club. According to Jaffe, Bogachev appeared to be

"very cold" and "a little stiff" in his contact with Jaffe. Jaffe

asked him what he intended to do and he replied: "I might go back

with git go back

to 'Tass.'" Jaffe indicated the Soviets gave Bogachev an

"atmosphere weather gauge" as a farewell gift.

Attempt to Contact Boris Nikolayevich Sedov

Jaffe said Sedov has not yet returned his calls. Jaffe

again indicated he met a Soviet Press Officer at a Hungarian

reception (later he said he met him at the Aviation Club party) C

who told him Sedov was not in his department but was connected

with the Soviet Information Department at the Soviet Embassy. The

Press Officer indicated Sedov had been in New York but was now

back in Washington, D.C. The Press Officer told Jaffe he would

tell Sedov to get in touch with Jaife. According to Jaiie, the

Press Officer, whose name he cannot recall, displayed great

interest in Jaffe and "practically begged"

Jaffe to invite him

to his home. The Soviet stated: "You haven't forgotten? You said

you would have me over. You are a great fellow. You will have me

over?" Jaffe said he replied in the affirmative. According to

Jaffe, the Soviet "made very sure I knew he was Jewish, which was

very obvious." Jaffe associates the Soviet's name with the Russian

word for "potato."

Boris Valentinovich Yarochevskiy, "Tass" Correspondent,

and his wife, Inna Grigoryevna Yarochevskaya

Jaffe said he attended a Hungarian reception April 17,

1969 which also was attended by several Soviet journalists. The

Soviets spent considerable time during the reception, which was

held just after the United States "spy" plane was shot down by

the North Koreans, in conversation with Bob McCloskey of the

United States Department of State.

Jaffe continued: "I met this young guy - the newest

arrival from 'Tass' • Boris. (last name unknown) (LNU) and Inna

(his wife)." Jaffe described Boris as "very, very Ivy League"

and "quite bright." Inna, who looked familiar to Jaffe, came.

over-to Jaffe and stated: "Sam, how are you? You don't remember

C

me? No? You are still a legend in Moscow. There is still talk

about you." Inna then indicated that she

was one of the translators

for Reuters News Agency in Moscow, working for John Miller. Her

last job was translator for Lares Bruger (phonetic), a Swedish

newspaper correspondent in Moscow and a friend of Jaffe.

Jaffe stated Boris apparently studied at McGill University

in Canada and Inna apparently joined her husband in Canada just

prior to his assignment in Washington, D.C. Inna indicated she and

Boris have only been in Washington, D.C. about one or one and one-half

months.

SAMUEL, ADASON JAFFE

Jaffe said Inna "is more outgoing than the others

(Soviets)." Both Boris and Inna speak good English. Jaffe

indicated

that Boris was going to the Foreign Language Institute

in Moscow while Inna was working for Reuters News Agency. He

said John Miller, Inna's boss, knew Boris. Jaffe stated Boris

followed up his studies at the Foreign Language Institute by

attending McGill University. He said Inna flew from Moscow to

meet Boris in Canada and they then flew to the United States.

Jaffe said Boris, while studying at Mckill University,

Chinese professor is closely connected with, if not a part of,

the Chinese Communist Government.

Jaffe said he learned from Inna that Yuri Nikolaevich

Vinogrador, a contact of Jaffe in Moscow and in the United States,

is now divorced.

Contact with Vladimir Fedorovich Petrovskiy and

(first name unknown) (FNU) Loginov (Possibly

Vadim Petrovich Loginov)

Jaffe stated: "I went to New York and called Vladimir

retrovskiy and his wife, Mira, whom I have known for year.. We

had lunch at 'The Plaza'

and had a long relaxing conversation."

SAMUEL ADASON JAFTE

Jaffe said he mentioned to Petrovskiy that Inna had

told him Yuri Vinogradov is now divorced. Although Petrovskiy

did not acknowledge that he was aware of this, he stated he.

was not surprised since he knew he had separated from his wife.

C

Yuri Vinogradov is now in the "Woild Organization Department"

of the Soviet Foreign Ministry as "an assistant to an assistant."

Jaffe got the impression that Vinogradov's job is not important.:

Petrovskiy mentioned that Viktor Mikhailovich Sukhodrev

and his wife also are now divorced. Jaffe said she had been in

"show business." Jaffe continuéd: "Viktor decided he wanted a

diplomatic career. He is working in the Foreign Ministry, but

whenever they need a translator, they grab him." Petrovskiy

indicated Sukhodrev is not happy with his new job because he

likes to travel and "be a big shot." While working at the

Foreign Ministry, Sukhodrev occasionally is used as an

interpreter in important cases.

Petrovskiy indicated that Vladimir Pavlovich Suslov

is now "what you would call policy planner for United States

affairs. at the Foreign Ministry. He has the title of Ambassador.

He has

a very important job now."

(Suslov has been identified by WE I-2, a former

KGB officer whose bona fides has not been

established but who has furnished reliable

information in the past, as a Soviet diplomat

who is an operative contact of KGb.)

Jaffe said he learned from Petrovskiy that Yuri

Nikolaevich Chernyakov, Press Officer, Soviet Imbassy, Washington,

D.C., might be recalled. He also learned that Mikhail

Nikolaevich

Smirnovskiy, who used to be Chier of the American Department oi

the Soviet Foreign Ministry "is ill" and has been replaced as

Ambassador to England. Jaffe got the impression it was a

"political illness."

Jaffe said Mira Petrovskaya is now working for the

Aeroflot Section of Intourist in New York because "she decided

she would keep herself busy."

SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE

Jaffe continued: "Petrovskiy was concerned because

'The Washington Post' is on a deliberate kick to defame him."

Jaffe indicated Petrovskly has been accused of being responsible

for the Soviet Union using the United Nations (UN) for its own

advantage. Jaffe stated: "He (Petrovskiy) admits he made a

mistake. He thought because it was made public and was given to

a group, he was able to publish it, and this has caused

embarrassment for the UN." Petrovskiy told Jaffe that "Robert

Esterbrook has had two articles sort of attacking me. I admit

I made a mistake.

I was wrong. I told the Secretary General

(of the UN) this. I didn't know. you had a group through which

this should be cleared. Why should this man continue to attack

me? Iwo articles in "The Washington Post' and one in the 'Los

Angeles Times.'" Jaffe said Petrovskiy indicated the Secretary

General of the UN was upset over the incident and Petrovskiy

wonders if he should try to "pull the book back" (from publication),

if it is still possible to do so.

Jaffe advised that the next day he visited the UN and

talked to Petrovskiy and (ENU) "Loginov,

who is (Soviet) Press

Officer here (Washington,D.Co) .and used to be Press Officer in

Moscow. We had a conversation. He said he would be in Washington

this week and would look me up. Loginov started to discuss the

Chinese. I said I would like to go there. He said he had been in

China and speaks Mandarin. He said he was very skeptical about one

point in (United States President) Nixon's press conference, why

he brought up Czechoslovakia in the press conference. 'Do you

(Jaffe) think it was a slam at

us (Soviets)?' He seemed to read

a lot of stuff into it."

(Vadim Petrovich Loginov was in the United States

October 27, 1959-November 25,1959 as a group leader

and member

of a Soviet delegation of students. He

was again in the United States September 4, 1967-

November 29,1967 as a temporary trainee at the

Soviet Embassy. He returned to the United States

February 12,1968 as First Secretary, Political

Division, Soviet Embassy, Washington, D.C.)

Identification of Soviet Nationals Employed in the

Press Department, Soviet Foreign Ministry, Moscow

Jaffe was shown photographs of several Soviet nationals

and he identified Leonid Mitrofanovich Zamyatin, Boris Dmitrievich

Pyadyshev, and Fedor Stepanovich Fedorenko as employees of the

Press Department, Soviet Foreign Ministry, with whon he had

contact while in Moscow. He was shown a photograph of Fedor.

Yakovlevich Semenov, but he did not recognize this individual

and stated he was not identical with the Fedor Semenov he knew

in Moscow as the Number Three Man in the Press Department of

the Soviet Foreign Ministry.

Jaffe was asked if he observed any indication that

any of these individuals were connected with Soviet Intelligence.

Jaffe replied in the negative; however, he stated Boris Fyadyshev

"is a very strange guy. A young man. Vladimir (Petrovskiy) told

me he had risen to Number Iwo man (in the Press Department)."

"affe recalled that on one occasion when he was accompanying-

N. K. Khrushchev on a trip, he invited Zamyatin to have a drink.

Although Zanyatin ordinarily did not drink with Jaffe, he

accepted his invitation on this occasion. Zamyatin indicated

he was very tired of his position in the fress Department and

planned to

retire and write under a pseudonym. According to.

Jaffe, Mira Petrovskaya said she went to school with Pyadyshev.

Jaffe said he found Pyadyshev to be a very bright, but very cold

individual. Jaffe stated: "I have always felt that Mira

Petrovskaya was connected with KGB;" however, she has never made

any intelligence approach to Jaffe.;

Jaffe then mentioned a Soviet national named Yuri

Bekov (phonetic) and stated: "There is no question that he was

KGB. (He was connected with) Press Department. He could do more

things. than the Press Department, but he was supposed: to be an

arm of the Press Department on trips. He knew all the overt

KGB men."

(Fedor Stepanovich Fedorenko has been reported

as connected with the Soviet Committee of

Information.)

Jaffe indicated he did not recognize the names of

and Mikhail Sagatelyan. He remarked that many of these individuals

have rather common Russian names. He made the following additional

remarks concerning individuals depicted in these photographs.

He said he is sure he met Ivgeniy Gromakovskiy; however,

this name is not familiar to him and he may have Inown him as

Granovskiy. He continued: "I think I knew him, possibly at 'Tass.

I don't think (I knew him) in Moscow." Jaffe stated he did not

have close contact with this individual.

In regard to Vadim Biryukov, Jaffe stated: "I always

thought that Vadim might have been with KGB. He got 'Life' into

fantastic places. Then he worked for'AN Novosti.' Now I under

stand he is no longer with 'APN.' He.was really close to Ed

Stevens."

In regard to Vyacheslav Kevorkov aka Chitashvili,

Jaffe indicated he definitely knew this individual, but not

under the name Kevorkov. He may have known him as Chitashvili,

and recalled he was using the "cover of the secretary of the

Union of Journalists."

In commenting on Yuriy Fedorov, Jaffe described him

as "an evil S.O.B. Apparently an expert on China. 'Slava'

Jaffe indicated he recognized the individual depicted

in the photograph of Viktor Dmitriyevich Timofeyev as an individual

with whom he had contact; however, this name is not familiar to

him. He then stated he recalled an individual named Timofeyev

(phonetic) who accompanied Khrushchev on a trip to the United

States. Jaffe referred to this individual as a "mystery man"

who was very close to Khrushchev. Jaffe indicated that this.

Timofeyev was not the individual depicted in the photograph of

Viktor Dmitriyevich Timofeyev.

(On March 21, 1969 Jaffe identified a photograph

of Timur Timofeevich Timofeev as a correspondent

who "at one time stood very high in Soviet hierarchy"

and "came here on Khrushchev trip." Jaffe was told

"he stood very high with Khrushchev. and then sone-

thing happened.")

Jaffe was questioned specifically about Yevgeniy

Nikolayevich Aleshin. He stated the name is not familiar to

him but he recognizes the face and possibly he met him in the

United States rather than in Moscow. He said he cannot recall

that Aleshin gave any indication he was connected with KGB.

Jaffe again identified Vyacheslav Aleksandrovich

Kuskov as the Soviet national connected with KGB known to him

first as "Slava" and later as Vyacheslav Kiselov. He did not

associate. the name Kuskov with "Slava".

Jaffe was questioned concerning previous comments he

made that photographs of Nikolay Aleksandrovich Gavrilenko

resemble "Slava's" KGB superior. Jaffe stated: "I can't say it

(photographs of Gavrilenko) vas 'Slava!s' boss. He was less Russian

looking. I definitely have seen this guy (Gavrilenko) but the

'name doesn't ring a bell."

When shown a photograph of Viktor Nikolaevich Titov,

Jaffe comnented: "This could be 'Slava's' boss." Jaffe said

"Slava's" boss was a "fellow like this. (Titov), younger than

!Slava.'

•(I was) never introduced by name. All he ('Slava') said

was, 'this is my boss.' He ('Slava's' boss) said he can speak a

little English. 'Slava' said, 'Better let me translate.' All we

did was go over the accident report. At the end he said, 'I am

aware of the case.' Then they spoke in Russian. (Slava'

asked)

'What do you think now that you have met Sam?' (The other Soviet

replied) 'I would think there isn't anything to worry about.'"

'Slava" then indicated to Jaffe that if his boss said there was

nothing to worry about, Jaffe could forget about the incident.

Later "Slava" tore the accident report up in Jaffe's presence.

closely with Kalugin as he did with the aforementioned Soviets.

(Nikolai Sergeevich Kalinin has been reported C

(01eg Danilovich Kalugin has been reported

Jaffe stated that another of his Soviet contacts,

Vladimir Borisovich Barkovski, was definitely connected with

KGB. Barkovski asked Jaffe to "write for their (Soviet)

journalists because they don't know about the U.S." Jaffe said

he mentioned Barkovski to "Slava," but "Slava" said he never

heard of him. He also mentioned Kalinin to "Slava" and "Slava"

denied knowing him. Jaffe said he believes Kalinin definitely.

was connected with KGB. He continued: "When I came to Moscow,

who popped up of all people, but Nikolai Kalinin." Jaffe advised

he once had his translator call Kalinin at a telephone number

furnished by Kalinin; however, Kalinin was not known to the

party answering the telephone.

In answer to a specific question, Jaffe said it was

Lyudmila Borisovna (LNU) who confirmed the

"Khrushchev ouster

through a telephone call to Lyudmila at APN. Prior to contacting

Lyudmila,

United States Correspondents Currently in Moscow

Jaffe stated he recently received a letter requesting

his advice from Irving Chapman who has. been the American Broad-

casting Company (ABC) correspondent in Moscow for only about

three months. Jaffe said Ken Bernstein, who has been the National

Broadcasting Company (NBC) correspondent in Moscow for three

years, got an exclusive concerning the Chinese-Soviet border

clash. Jaffe stated: "The pressure is on 'Irv' (Irving Chapman),"

who has been told, "if you can't do the job, you might as well!"

get out."

In his letter, Chapman said, "I don't know how he

got the film. I guess he got it through APN Novosti." Chapman

reached the conclusion NBC apparently obtained the exclusive

through Viktor Louis. Chapman stated: "I don't know how much

NBC gives him, but he is riding around in a Porche (automobile)."

Jaffe then stated: ''Slava' was interesting, a Stalinist. Louis

is a capitalist. I had very little to do with him. I was at his

apartment once and I heard about his house." Jaffe indicated that

because of his wife's curiosity, he and his wife visited the

house

of Viktor louis, which he described as very "plush."

Jaffe said Chapman "asked me for my contacts and

how he can defeat NBC." Chapman's letter stated: "I met many

of your friends. They

send best regards and inquire about you."

Chapman mentioned three individuals, Vetler Prog (phonetic),

who is connected with the State Committee on Radio and Television

of the Soviet Foreign Ministry; Mikhail Bruk, and Viktor Louis.

The letter stated: "They all indicate there has been no corres-

pondent with ABC (in Russia)

since san Jaffe left. They don't

think much of Watkins. (Jaffe's successor as ABC correspondent

in Russial" According to Jaffe, Chapman's letter indicated that

Jaffe's Soviet contacts suggested that "if Jaffe was there he

would have such an exclusive." Chapman asked: "Can you help me

out and tell me what you can do with Louis?" Chapman's letter

concluded: "If a KGB agent like Viktor Louis is good enough fos

S. Jaife, he certainly is good enough for I. Chapman."

Jaffe said his advice to Chapman was: "Play one against

the other, as well as with Viktor louis, through the Embassy."

Jaffe explained that he advised Chapman to clear all his contacts

through the American Imbassy, Mosco

Jaffe indicated he was surprised when he learned

recently that Viktor Louis had travelled to Taiwan and had

written an article praising the Taiwan government.

Jaffe concluded: "Ken Bernstein should get out of

there (Russia). He is a bachelor. I know he is shacking with

Russian girls.

I saw him in Hong Kong and asked, 'Are you going

back.' He said he doesn't know exactly what he will do. (He

said) 'I am going back for a while.'

Moscow Journalists Suspected by Jaffe of Being

Connected With KGB

Jaffe was asked if he considered Edmund Stevens to

be connected with KGB. He replied: "How can you stay in that

country that long and get the things that he got without having

some connection with KGB? How can he have this beautiful house?

Then, when it is torn down (because of a roadbuilding project),

he winds up in an ex-embassy!" In commenting on the Soviet wife

of Stevens, Jaife stated, "She is weird. How does she get soviet

art out of the country?"

Jaffe stated Stevens appears to have

dropped out of the newspaper field. Jaffe said he was once a

syndicated wiiter, but "not any more. He had a deal in caviar

and vodka, selling vodka and caviar to the Kremlin." Jaffe

described his daughter, Anastasia, as a "nut" and said he understands

she is now married.

Jaffe emphatically expressed the opinion that Stevens,

Viktor Louis and Henry Shapiro are connected with KGB. He described

Shapiro as "an evil little man," "more Russian than the Russians."

Jaffe stated: "He should get out and teach. He is no writer."

In discussing Viktor Louis, Jaffe stated he "never

had any doubts that he (Louis) was with KGB." In discussing

Louis, Jaffe indicated that all important "exclusives" in Moscow

pertained to security matters and not to "leaks" from the Soviet

that Louis was the recipient of many such "etclusives." Jaffe

also indicated that louis appears to live far better than other

correspondents from foreign countries and is permitted to

travel extensively abroad, including countries such as the

United States and Taiwan, Jaffe indicated that these factors

convince him that Louis is connected with KGB.

Jaffe concluded: "That is what they (KGB) do. They set

this man up. If you want information," then contact a man such

as Viktor Louis.

C

Jaffe's Future Plans

Jaffe stated: "I like to keep contact with these people

(Soviet and Chinese nationals) because it will pay off in the

long run." Jaffe indicated he expects to attend the May Day

celebration at the Soviet Embassy, Washington,D.C. He also indicated

he was still actively trying to obtain an assignment as a newspaper

correspondent in Mainland China but has done nothing more concerning

his desire to obtain a similar assignment in Cuba.

In discussing his desire to go to Mainland China, Jaffe

indicated that he had interviewed Chou En Lai in 1955 and was one

of 18 foreign correspondents selected to visit China in 1956. In

the Fall of 1965 he went from Moscow to Belgrade, Yugoslavia, Fol-

lowing his ouster from the Soviet Union, and conveyed to Chinese

newsmen in Belgrade his desire to obtain a newspaper assignment ir

Mainland China. While in Hong Kong he made the same desire known

to Szeto Kung of the Chinese News Agency. Finally, on April 28,

1969 he indicated to a Chinese professor at McGill University in

Canada his desire to obtain a newspaper assignment in China and the

professor agreed to forward a letter from Jaffe indicating

his desire to visit Mainland China,. The Chinese professor has

suggested that Jaffe mention in the letter that he desires to

visit China as a private citizen rather than as a newspaper

correspondent; however, Jaffe should be completely honest in

the letter, mentioning the facts that he has been a journalist,

that he interviewed Chou In Lai in 1955, and that when

visiting China as a private citizen, he would like to continue

his writing career.

tions by 1

those establishments in the United States.

As indicated in serOlet 2/28/69 requesting Bureau

authority for interview of subject, approved by Bulet 3/12/69,

JAFFE was invited to TWO and showed no reluctance to do so.

Since he was on general assignment, he called his office at :

the beginning of

each of the first two interviews to give the.

telephone number at which he could be located.. He was contacted

by his office during the first interview. On the third interview,

he had what he called a "Bellboy" signalling device which he

said would receive a signal from his office after wich he

would call. He indicated he used this device to avoid the

office giving out the FBI telephone number to anyone, including

Russians, who might call him.

JAFTE gave the appearance of being a very aggressive, U

fast-talking, smooth operatos. Priot to each interview, he had

been drinking, but was not intoxicated.

The first two interviews were handled as planned, by

asking him to recount his experiences and contacts with Russians

S

in the USS? and Hong Kong, including his experiences with "Slava".

He expressed no hesitancy in talking about his contrcts but

constantly spoke in generalities, tending to "playdown"

his

relations with "Slava". He furnished more detail after specific

were confirmed in interview only after leading

During the interview on 3/27/69, JArFE was advised

that intervieving agents were concerned regarding a number of

aspects of his relationship with the Soviets and the FBI. For

example, it was noted he had now disclosed considerable additional

information about his relationship vith "Slava", more than

previously; that because of his past relationship with Agents

of the NYO, the I'BI had a right to expect that he would make

imnediate full disclosures of such relationship and his failure

. to do so raised questions about the relationship, whether he

has been recontacted by KGB since he left Russia, etc. It also

was pointed out that his expulsion from Russia after he had

been ordered to Flong Kong and his replacement named, seemed

somewhat suspicious, particularly since he had been warned that

a defector knew of his relationship with "Slava"; that this

defector had in fact reported this relationship and alleged

that he had been an agent of and furnished information to "Slava".

He was urged to now furnish complete information regarding his

relationship with the KGB and to "square the record" with the

FBI.

JAFt? did not lose his composure at any time during

the interviews, but, as indicated in the liM, when pressed on

3/27/69 on his relationship with KGB and his failure to make

complete disclosure to I'BI, he offered the lame excuse, his

fear of "Slava"

, but conceded this was a poor excuse for not

reporting the relationship after his return to the United States.

JAIFE was emphatically told that the

FBI had not had

any contact with the

American Broadcast Company (ABC) with

regard to him and had-not in any way labelled him as a security.

risk to any other person oragency. He replied that someone

C

had done so and indicated he was aware that some ABC officials

JAFFE seemed very concerned that. ABC did not give

him the diplomatic "beat" of the State Department "beat" which

he seemed to consider his right. It appears he will continue

contacts with the Soviet Bloc people as a means of trying to

get such assignments. To preclude his use of cooperation with

the FBI as a means to this end, he was very emphatically told

that the decision for such continued contacts was strictly his

decision and the FBI would not ast him to do so.

It also is apparent that JAITS is intensely interested

in getting an assignment to China or Cuba. He denied that he

had any KGB instructions to do so, but this, of course, is a

definite possibility."It is not possible to accurately

assess

this possibility at this time, and it also is not possible to

conclude whether he is or is not still in contact with KGB

and acting as an agent. He emphatically denied any intelligence

contact since he left Moscow; however, the call which he said

he received: from BORIS SIDOV desiring to show him a photograph

seems unusual and is possibly contrived.

II. Jaffe's Contacts with FBI While Assigned to Moscow

Jaffe furnished the following information to

agents of the new York Office of the fBi on January 7, 1963.

Jaffe stated he was acquainted with lurt

Vladimirovich Fedorov while in Moscow.

Jaffe said Fedoroy

with the Novosti Press Agency in Moscow.

While Jaffe was in Moscow, in 1962, he became

acquainted with a number of Soviet citizens both male and

female.

He said that he was dating one Soviet female by the

name of Galina in the Fall of 1962. He became acquainted

with her through other Soviet females with whom he was ac

quainted; however, he was unable to furnish her last name.

Galina told Jafie that she had been dating foreigners in the

past and, because of this, had been called into KGB Headquarters

and

warned against continuing her association with foreigners.

During the Cuban crisis, in the Fall of 1962,

Fedorov told Jaffe confidentially that there was a bitter

dispute among the Soviet hierarchy in the Kremlin concerning

the

manner in which the Soviets should deal with the Cuban

crisis.

Fedorov told Jaffe that Soviet Premier Nikita

Khrushchev was able to muster enough support for his position

and

eventually won out over those in the Soviet hierarchy who

proposed a tough uncompromising attitude.

romising attitude.

D:1111e

Jaffe advised that he used the information furnished

to him by Yuri V.XFedorov concerning the dispute in the Kremlin

over the Cuban crisis in a broadcast over the ABC network.

RUSSICS INS

jaffe recalled that the aforementioned information

came to him from Fedorov on a Friday late in October, 1962.

the following day, a Saturday, Jaffe attended a social function

at the home of Stanley -Weyman, Life Magazine correspondent in

Moscow. He brought his friend, Galina, with him and remained

at Weyman's house until some time after midnight.

When he de-

parted from Weyman's house, he took Galina and a

Soviet male

with him.

The soviet male, whose. name he could not remenbers

was

also a guest at Neyman's house and Jaffe offered to drive

him home.

This Soviet male was associated with the Ministry

ot Foreign Affairs, according to jaffe.

After Jaffe dropped the Soviet male at his

home, he proceeded to drive toward Galina's home.

Galina's instruction, he made a turn in, an area of Moscow

which was unfamiliar

to him.

After making this turn he

hit a deep hole and blew out several tires on the Chevrolet

automobile which he was driving.

Jaffe said that he sent

Galina to obtain police assistance and, after she left, he.

noticed four male individuals driving by in an old Pobeda

automobile.

Shortly thereafter several truck drivers came

by and assisted Jaife. Fortunately, he had several spare

tires in his automobile. At about 3:15 a.m., the police came

by but showed no interest in Jaffe and apparently made no

report of his situation. Jaffe then returned to his apart

nent.

Some time after Jaife returned to his apartment,

he received a telephone call from Galina. Galina told Jaffe

that she nad to see him immediately.

She said that she was

near the American Embassy in Moscow

and Jaffe arranged to

meet her in the vicinity of the Ukraine Hotel in Moscow. -!

When Jaffe met Galina he found that she had

apparently been physically abused as she bore sears and

marks on her arms and face.

Galina told Jaffe that after

she left him she went to telephone for assistance. As she

was leaving the telephone from which she made the

call to

the

police, she was accosted by two men.

She immediately resisted

efforts of these men to detain her and as she ran from them

she was accosted by another man who knocked her to the ground.

where she was questioned at length about her association with

Jaffe..

The individuals questioning her wanted to know how long

she had been seeing Jaffe, where she had been with Jaffe and

they were particularly interested in her travels with Jaffe

during the last several days. They wanted to knor if Jaffe

was in love with her.

Galina told Jaffe that they wanted her to sign

a statement to the effect that she would not see Jaffe again.

These individuals also wanted to know what, if anything, Jaffe

had given her by way of gifts.

Galina told Jaffe that at approximately 6:00 ..

another individual came in and questioned her about, the same

matters but did so in a very polite and refined manner. This

was in contrast to the manner in which she had been questioned

immediately subsequent to her arrival at the police station.

Galina told Jaffe that she was quite upset and a doctor was also

called to administer a sedative to her.

Before being released by the police, Galina was

told by the police not to see jaffe again.

She said that

they told her that Jaffe's name and her name would appear

in "Izvestia".

Aîter hearing Galina's story, Jaffe called

Fedorov and relayed the story of Galina's experiences to

Fedorov.

Fedorov told Jaffe that he would be right over to

see him.

According to Jaffe, Fedorov inmediately came

to see him at his apartment. Upon his arrival Fedorov acted

as though he were shocked by the whole story which Jaffe

told to him.

Fedorov told Jaffe that this was a very serious

matter and that an article was then being written concerning

Jaffe's association with Galina.. He said that Jaife would

be

depicted as an American who had led a Soviet female astray.

This would serve as a isson to Soviet citizens, particularly

females, to refrain fron associating with American citizens.

Fedorov also told Jaffe that this article would

appear in

"Komsomolskaya Pravda". Fedorov_ said that he did not know

what he could possibly do for jaffe but suggested that a friend

of his, who is a Deputy Editor with

"Komsomolskaya

a Pravda",

might be able to help.

Fedorov suggested that there might

be time to stop the story.

Jaffe's presence Fedorov made a

telephone call allegedly to his

friend the Deputy Editor: After

the call was made Fedorov toid

Jaffe that it would be okay for

them to see his friend at 6:00 p.m. that night.

Jaffe net Fedorov at a restaurant in Moscow at

6:00

Pol. that evening in accordance with arrangements previously

made. Fedorov's friend, the Deputy Editor, was to meet them

there but prior to Fedorov's friend's arrival, Fedorov told

Jaife that his friend was not actually Deputy

• Editor of "Komsomol"

skaya Pravda". He told Jaffe that his friend was an old war

buddy who just happened to be in the KGB.

When Fedorov's-friend arrived he was introduced

to Jaffe as Vyacheslav/Rislov, Jaffe came to know this individual

as "Slava". "Kislov said to Jaffe "I guess you know who I am"

He then went on to tell Jaffe that he was with the KGB.

that he and his colleagues were not too pleased with Jaffe's coi-

duct. He asked Jaife who his source in the Kremlin was and then

suggested that information which Jaffe obtained concerning

a dispute in the Krenlin came from someone in the American

Embassy in Moscow. Jaife denied that his source was in

i the American Embassy in Moscow but refused to tell Kislov

the identity of his source.

hiSloV then proceeded to give Jaife a complete

run down of everything he had done in Russia.

He named females

Jaffe had dated and told Jaffe all about his

association with

Galina.

He went on to tell Jaffe that Galina

was formerly a

designer in a factory in Moscow but that she would be given a

trial and be banned from Moscow.

When Jaffe asked Kislov about the story being

prepared for "Komsomolskaya

Pravda", Kislov told Jaite that

he liked him. He said that he might be able to kill the story

at the

same time he looked at his watch.

He then

said

that he would see what he could do, expressing the opinion that

he could probably kill the story.

Before Jaffe left Kislov's

company, Kislov said that he would like to see Jaife again and

Jaffe agreed to see him although no definite arrangements vere

made.

On the following morning Kislov called Jaife and

told Jaffe that he had succeeded in killing the story.

He

asked Jaffe to have lunch with him and a date was made.

At

lunch Kislov told Jaffe that he had been in the United

States

He then told Jaffe that it was necessary to watch Western cor

respondents in Moscow as the Soviets know that American citizens

pay a great deal of attention to material written in newspapers.

He said it was necessary for the Soviets to be careful what they

permit Western correspondents to write and say. He said the

Soviets would like to know Western reaction to Soviet moves par

•ticularly Soviet moves in situations like the Cuban crisis.

Kislov then went on to tell Jaffe that he was lucky

to be in Moscow and itras only because of his superiors that he

was granted a visa.

He told Jaffe that Jaffe killed his chances

for obtaining a Soviet visa of his own accord becausenof.his

conduct during the trial of Francis Gary Powers on espionage

charges in Moscow in 1960.

At this time Kislov said thât the

Soviets concluded that Jaffe was employed by the Central Intel

ligence Agency (CIA) and had been assigned to keep track of

Powers' wife, Barbara, since he spent so much time in her company.

late in 1961, he was kept under surveillance for four solid

weeks.

Kistov called this to jaffe's attention and told Jaffe

that he had aggravated some Soviets who were surveilling him

because of his activities. Kislov then went on to discuss

the fact that the Soviets

had exposed seveil United States

Embassy officials as intelligence agents recently. Kislov

told Jaffe that these were strictly retaliatory measures taken

by the Soviets because of soviet nationals associated with

the United Nations who had been exposed in the United States.

Kislov also asked Jatie to bring him a miniphone O

recording machine from the United States.

Jaffe said that during hisstay in Moscow he has

never experienced anything which would indicate that the

Soviets were attempting to compromise hin with the exception

of the one incident related herein.

Jaile made one observation stemming fron his visit

In Moscow to the effect that the younger generation Soviet

that I knew about his connection.. I think it's possible for the

wrong, China was right - real old-guard Stalinist.

Whenever

Jaffe indicated he told "Slava" he did not learn

anything important at the brielings. Jaffe continued:

one half weeks. He continued:

"I have met his wife.

his wife had

been with KGB and was retired.

believe there was no problem, until an assistant traffic

"This man spotted me" and he was

required to take a sobriety test. Jaffe stated he passed

the test although there was a trace of alcohol in his system.

Jaffe vas permitted to leave, but later was required to return

to the police station and "they said it vas decided to press

Jaîfe continued: "At this point 'Slava' found

out about it.

He came to see me and

said it was very, very

serious." A little later, Jaffe and his wife had prepared to

leave on vacation but at the last minute he was told he could

not obtain an exit visa until the automobile accident had been

cleared up.

Jaife then got a call from "Slava" who "Said he

would like me to meet a guy.

This man • I think I could

identify. very young, very tough, aggrossive guy, good looking,

in 30's.

'Slava' said it was his chief and he just wanted to

"Slava's" boss, who spoke very good English, asking Jaffe his

thoughts about the

Soviet Union.

Toward the end of the meeting:

"Slava" mentioned Jaffe's

autonobile accident problem, and asked

"what do you think we can do about it?"

Then the two

Soviets

conversed in Russian, aiter which Jaife was told "don't worry."

Later, at the advice of Kamenev, Jaffe's translator,

Jalte visited the injured soviet at a hospital, and "brought

him some booze," Jaife continued:

"They found out about this

and the police were furious,"

insinuating that Jaffe was trying

to influence the victim. A month passed, and still Jaffe did

not receive an exit visa. Then

"Slava"

called and requested &

They met in a park in Moscow.

"Slava" showed Jaffe

a piece of paper concerning the police charges,

and tore it up

in Jaffe's presence.

Jaffe asked "Slava" what

"Slava" wanted

fron him and "Slava" replied:

"Forget about it.

The case is

settlement." Thereafter,

Jaffe met the victim's wife, paid her 100 or 200 rubles,

she signed a statement releasing Jaffe from all other clims.

Expulsion of Jaffe from Soviet Union

Jaffe advised that after receiving the

"exclusive" from "Slava" concerning the Khrushcher ousteï,

he continued to meet with "Slava" "on and off" until

Jaife was expelled from the Soviet Union in October, 1965.

In explaining the expulsion, jaffe said that without

advising him, John Scali of the American Broadcasting

Company (ABC) wrote a story which Jaffe thinks was a

"trial

baloon", intimating thai Leonid Brezhnev and Aleksei Kosygin

were about to be ousted.

Jaffe got a call from ABC in New

York asking what he thought about Scali's story. Jaffe stated

he did not believe the story was true and he asked "Slava" for

his opinion. "Slava" indicated that although he would like

to see it happen,

he did not believe it would occur "because

they were too new as Soviet Heads of State. Jaffe continued:

"The next morning,, Henry/Shapixo called me, asking why I had

written such a stóry."

Jaffe denied knowing anything about it.

He explained that it was later that he learned that the story

had been written by John Scali.

and

his wife, Lyudmila:Nikolayevna/shapiro, 25.19s agentS..

At the time Scali's story broke, Jaffe and his

wife were in the process of packing in preparation for their

departure fron Russia for Hong Kong and Jaffe's ABC Successor

in Moscow already had

been named. The first indication jaffe

received of his expulsion was a call from ABC in New York asking

what Jaffell done to cause the soviets to recall the visa for

Jaffe's sucessor.

Jaffe said he replied:

"Did you ever think

I could be John Scali's story?"

Later Jafe was called into the Soviet Foreign

Office and told he had to leave

the Soviet Union in ten days

and that the ABC office in Moscow was being closed.

said he inquired:

"Are you holding this (story) against me?"

Jaffe was told that

the Soviets were not, and that "we

exactly what you said about us for four years."

Jaffe indicated

this was the first indication he had that the Soviets had tech-

nical coverage on him.

Jaffe said he did not want to leave the

Soviet Union under these conditions. He said the Soviets told

"We are not holding this against you but it has to be."

Jaffe was told not to worry about the deadline for his departure

and that he could get additional time. Jaffe also was told he

would be

_able to return to Russia.

He continued:

everything

went smoothly.

Jaffe's Employees in Moscow

Jaffe advised that in 1955 prior to his

expulsion he had a Soviet cameraman and a translator.

The cameraman had left several months before the ABC

office was ciered closed, and

he was replaced by Yuri

Boridorov (phonetic); who

stayed until Jaffe's expulsion

and actually closed the ABC office.

The translator, Aleksandr

"Sasha" Neznanov (phonetic), "was

good and would stick his

neck out, but he was mixed up wich some girl.

This was the

excuse he gave." "Sasha" told jaffe he had. "gotten himself in

trouble with a circus girl and this was about to cause a

scene."

"Sasha," who broke down and cried when he related the

Story to Jaffe,

said he made the girl pregnant and she had

threatened to come down to his office

and complain.

Jaffe

said he asked "Slava" about this, and his only comment was

"they weren't very good" employees. Jaffe said the translator's

replacement was a

"great big goon type who knew nothing," and

Jaffe fired him.

Jaffe stated he left Russia about a month after

the Scali story broke.

"I had alceady reported

the denial based on what I saw and believed,

but ABC didn't

use them • radio did but TV didn't."

Jaffe stated the soviets

were aware. of the ABC radio denial but they asked Jaffe why

denial did not appear on television, stating

"the impact

him of the defector shortly after Jaife read the story

in the press that a Soviet national disappeared in Switzer

land•

Jafie continued:

"Fie (Slava') vas actually concerned

because the man had a

he worked with

ty.

He was very, very worried." Jaffe

said he learned at about the time he was leaving Bussia that

"Slava" was "being denoted and was going into another area.

He wasn't happy. I think he felt he had more to offer."

When again requested to relate the circumstances

of his introduction to "Slava", Jaffe stated he

was dating a

Soviet girl. He said he did not believe the Soviets have any

compromising photographs of their activities; however, the

girl told him she had been called up before the review board

of the factory where she worked and embarrassed because of her

association with an American.

She told Jaffe, that the whole

story would appear in "Izvestia" or some other Soviet news.

paper.

Jaffe

continued: "At this point Fedorov befriended

Inst.

He said, 'I hear by the grapevine

you are in a little

hot water.'

I acknowledged this bui said I didn't think there

was anything wrong with seeing a Soviet girl.

He said it could

be very serious: your name could be written in 'Izvestia'".

Jaffe indicated

Fedorov got "very melodramatic."

He continued:

"I was scared of the automobile accident (in which he hit a

pedestrian. But I wasn't scared about this."

Jaffe then

related again that Fedorov introduced "Slava" to him as an

individual who could keep his name out of the newspapers.

It was pointed out to Jaffe that he first men-

tioned "Slava" to the FBI in January, 1963, and he was asked

if he could recall the information he furnished at that time

regarding attendance at a party and flat tires. He then re

lated that he had attended a party with a girl friend and had

a few drinks. At about 1:00 a.m., he wasdriving

he observed a "detour left" sin.

he gave her

breakfast and then she went home.

He continued:

"The next time I saw her, she said she would be called up by

In answer to a specific question, Jaffe stated:

"I

to him ('Slava') as to me. I didn't see him after the expulsion

_order came in."

Jaffe again stated:

to perform a task for Naval Intelligence.

He received per

mission to travel in the North Sea ahoard a Soviet Ice

Breakes "Lenin" and prior to starting this assignment, he

was briefed by Naval Attaches at the American Embassy,

Moscow,

on their interests including any observations he might make

of Soviet atomic submarines. Accompanying Jaffe on the trip

was Dieter. Steiner, another

foreign correspondent in Moscow.

Jaffe did not observe any atonic submarines and every tine the

ship neared a Soviet naval base, the guests were told the

Captain desired

to brief them below deck in his cabin. By

the time the briefings were over, the ship had passed

naval bases.

On one occasion, Jaffe, while en route to the

Captain's cabin, realized he had left his photographic equip

ment on deck. He returned to get it and was approached by

Soviet

Naval Officers who reminded him he was expected to be

receiving a briefing in the Captain's cabin; however, he vas

not reprimanded and was treated well throughout the cruise.

While in Riga, Jaffe and Steiner observed a

group of buoys in a large channel which were spaced uniform

distances apart. Jaffe and Dieter finally relized that by

Jaffe's Difficulties with AAC and CIA

Jaffe indicated he believed his recall by ABC

from Hong Kong was caused by or influenced by an agency or

agencies of the Unied States Government. lie indicated he

was told by a British Intelligence contaci in fong kong that

he was recalled because he refused to cooperate with CIA in

Hong Kong. Jaffe said he rocontly nentionod this to & CIA

contact in Washington, D.Ce, and

was told the British Intel

ligence representative " had no right to toll you this."

Jaffe stated he also was told by other contacts that British

Intelligence was investigating him ant desired to know as

much as possible about him; however, Britich Intelligence

had not

initiated the inquiry, but was obtaining the inforna

tion for another organization.

Jafie also indicated he was concerned that a

recent publication

hao

falsely reported that he was a member

o1 a

left wing organization.

Jaffe then stated:. "I would

like to get this thing cleaned up. I feel that I have been

pulled back here."

Jaffe was advised that the FBS had absolutely

nothing to do with his return to the

United States fron Hong

Kong and did not have any contact with ABC with regard io him.

He was also told that it

_is?

difficult to understand why he had

not previously advised

the

FBI of some of the information con-

cerning his activities

in Russia which he has now related.

Jaffe said he felt that he had told the FBi enough but admit

• ted he had

not furnished complete information concerning his

activities in Russia, icluding the warning by "Slava" concerning

the KGB defector. He admitted

the FBI had a right to expect

him to do so.

He continued:

"I was afraid of this guy.

was damn interested and curious - he was an intense man • somen

one who gave me more information than I gave him. I vas afraid

I might meet with an automobile accident. "

Jaffe said he did

not tell the FBI "everything

because with that

guy ~ I was

scared. I am 'not

on their

side in any way. There are a lot of

things wrong with it, but I love it (the United States) I

try to be middle of

the road - I have been in Vietnam I am

not a Soviet spy and not a Communist. I was frightened. This

man was a very threatening man.

This man could have killed.

He feli that strong about the old country - Stalin - I think

he was as vicious as Semichastnyy and Shelepin (former Chari~

men of the KGB) . I went up (and talked) to them.

Semichastnyy

said, 'yes, I know you.

What do you want?'" Jaffe explained

this occured at a reception.

Jafie stated that "Slava" might have thought

that he (jaffe) was

"Slava's" agent.

He continued:

"Little

things came out of 'slava', but I never know exactly what he

did. I do know I would tell hin what I would think,

which is

not a secret." jaffe, indicated he never toid "Slava" or any

other Soviet connected with. Soviet Intelligence anything other

than his own observations and opinions and denied furnishing

any information from any Government documents.

He

also

emphatically denied that hes hao made any arrangemenis jot

meeting him after he left Moscow or that thee had been.any

such meetings since he left Moscow.

lle said nobody had {ol.

lowed up "Slava's" contacts with him.

In response to a specific question, Jaste stated

he did not think "Slava" had anything toido with his expulsion

from Russia.

He continued:

"My guess is John Scali, who is

very close to

CIA" was responsible for the expulsion. Jaffe

continued:

"John wanted to set me up with CIn.. They (cla,

would do things in indirect ways."

Jaffe then related an in

cident in which Scali invited several ABC employees to a

party, including an individual introduced to Jaffe as an employee

of the

Departnent of Commerce, who expressed very much interest

in Jate's assignment to Russia.

Jaite later verified that this

individual. vas connected with

CIA and he feels it

would have

been better if the individual had been completely open with him.

Prior to the

trial, he was approached by a CIA representative in California

who indicated he was avare Jaffe would be sent to Moscow by

Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS).

Jaffe stated he (Jaffe)

was not aware of it at that time. Jaffe said he subsequently

was told by another CIA representative whom he met while attending

meetings of the Council on Foreign Relations that he had been

picked to go to Moscow with Barbara Powers and help Marvin Kalb,

CBS correspondent,

cover the trial. On the eve of his departure,

a CIA representative who claimed he was a psychiatrist gave Jaffe

background material on spy trials and said

"they were very much

interested in determining if Powers is brainwashed."

Jaffe

related that Barbara Powers developed a friendship with him

and constantly sought his company and advice and expressed

2

strong dislike for CIA personnel accompanying them.

Jaffe, at

the insistance of Mrs. Powers, wrote a letter to the President

of the Soviet Union appealing

for clemency for Powers. Jaffe

continued:

"There was nothing physical between us.

We went

down town (in Moscow) and went

to the KGB building (at the

request of irs. Powes, who insisted on seeing the building).

This was the first-time she cried. Then we went back.

The

next morning was the trial.

down in the VIP section.

In response to a specific question, jaile

stated: "'Slava' never said anything about the trial

except to say they (KGS) thought I was with CIA. Later

he said they knew i was pot."

jaffe again indicated that he feit some United.

States Government agency was responsible for his recall from.

Hong Kong and that it had some connection with an "intelligence"

allegation.

He also indicated dislike for his present assign-

ment with ABC in

Washington, D.C., stating that although he

had hoped to cover the "diplomatic beat" or the State Depart

ment, he is merely on general assignment, sitting around

waiting for niscellancous

stories to break.

Jaile also stated: "I was a bit afraid of

'Slara': I was waiting for chen (KGB) to_ contact me in

Hong Kong. I thought it would have come there,"

also

в.

stated:

"You (FRI) have a right, after our relationship" to

inquire about Jaffe's

activities and "I have a right to an

answer in all honesty" concerning the reason for the recall

from Hong Kong.

Jalie stated that when he returned from Hong

Kong he asked the head of ABC for an explanation of his re

call and was told he had not produced and had refused to

return to Vietnam:

Jatte denied both accusations.

Jaffe then

went to his immediate superior and was told he was recalled

• because of a cable he sent fron saigon.

jaffe asked to be

but his request vas refused. The discussion

with the superior loudly accusing Jaffe of being a liar and

Jaffe suggesting that the superior was mentally ill for

shouting at him and refusing to show him the cable.

Jaffe

stated he had seriously considered leaving ASC; however, during

the last week of March, 1969, he signed another contract with

ABC.

Jaffe said

satisfied with the salary involved,

but dislikes very much being on general assignment.

He again

indicated he is trying io obtain an assignment to

Red China

and also is attempting io obtain an assignment to Cuba.

In explaining his difficulties with ABC in Viet

nam, Jaife stated thatABC correspondents in Hong Kong are

rotated on assignments to Vietnam and Korea and it was under-

stood that the assignments in Vietnam would never exceed one

month's duration.. While Jaffe was in Vietnam on an assignment,

his

Jaffe received a cable from headquarters stating "Tell jaffe

Jalie's Attitude Concerning Subsequent

Contacts with Boris sedov

Jaffe indicated

he was concerned about what

effect.

subsequent contacts with Boris Sedov might have on

his career with ABC, particularly if Sedov's contacts might

lead to another KGB approach.

Jaffe was toid that he alone

could made a decision concerning his future contacts with

Soviet nationals; that the rBI would not request that he

continue these contacts; but the fbi would be interested in

any information concerning contacts with anyone which Jatfe

feels represents an attempt by foreign intelligence to cul

;.on 11/14/68, he approached some WFO Agents who were con-

ducting a surveillance on satellite personnel and indicated

that he would like to have contact with the FBI in Washing-

ton, D.C. in the same manner as he had previously had con-

tact in New York.

He indicated that he was in contact with

Soviets in Washington, D.C. and would report on them. WFO

did not initiate contact with him at that time because it

was desired to obtain from New York the complete details

of New York's relations with him, and it was also desired

to interview

concerning him. As indicated above,

the New York material has now been reviewed and mess

was interviewed concerning JAFFE by WFO Agents on 2/11/69.-5-

It is considered entirely possible that JAFFE,

while in Moscow, furnished only innocuous information to

his KGB contact and did not consider that he was a re-

cruited agent or source of KGB. He should be given an

opportunity to describe his activities in Moscow. Based

upon review of information pertaining to him, it appears

that he could be a good

source against Soviets in Washing-

ton, D.C., provided he is candid concerning his activities

in Moscow and is not, in fact, a recruited agent continuing

to report to KGB. It is believed that an interview with

him is necessary to assess this potential.

4) As indicated in NYairtel, JAFFE appears to

be concerned regarding derogatory information which has

appeared in a book written by PHOEBE GREENE COURTNEY. He

has related these allegations to his recall from Hong Kong

by his employer and is concerned regarding the allegation

of disloyalty. It would appear that this may be a

propitious time to interview JAFFE in an effort to com-

pletely debrief him concerning his contacts with Soviets

during his tour in Moscow and in Hong Kong, as well as

concerning his recent contacts with Soviets in Washington,

D.С. -C-

If the Bureau approves interview with JAFFE,

it is contemplated that he will be advised that WFO Agents

desire to renew contacts with him previously initiated by

New York Agents. He will be invited to the Washington

Field Office to discuss in some detail his tour of duty

in Moscow and his contacts with Soviets since his return

to this country. It will be pointed out that WFO desires

to display to him a large number of photographs of Soviets

in this country and in Russia to obtain his comments. If

JAFFE agrees, he will first be requested to describe in

detail his activities in Moscow and in particular, his

contacts with the KGB subsequent to those reported in

January; 1963. He will also be asked if he had any con-

tacts with Soviets while in Hong Kong and if so, to de-.

scribe them. Thereafter, he will be requested to describe

in detail his contacts with Soviets since his return to

this country. During the course of the interview, he will

be shown photographs of KGB officers assigned to the Second

Chief Directorate in Moscow, as well as photographs of

Soviets currently assigned to Washington, D.C. Also during

the course of the interview, it is contemplated that he will

be informed that a Soviet defector has advised that he

furnished information to KGB officer KUSKOV, and he will be

requested specify aquest one concern fus ase to groups

of Americans who visited with KHRUSHCHEV, concerning which

he made reports to KGB. Every effort will be made to

obtain accurate information from JAFFE as a means of

assessing his potential. If it appears that he is not

candid, it is believed that no further consideration should

be given to utilizing him as an active source, but infor-

mation volunteered by him should be accepted. Also if he

additional investigation is necessary to determine if,

in fact, he is continuing to report to KGB. f

In the event JAFFE does not agree to come to the

Washington Field Office, Bureau permission is requested to

interview him at his residence.

on the evening of 2/5/69,

SA EDWARD E. GAMBER Immediately. In SA GAMBER's absence,

he asked that SA GAMBER telephonically contact him as soon

as possible at telephone #657-9774 In Chevy Chase, Md. -U~

en telephone call was returned.

His purpose in calling was to advise the Bureau that his

employer, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), was in

receipt of 2 copies of a new book entitled "America's

Unelected Rulers of the Council on Foreign Relations"

which was written by PHOEBE GREENE COURINEY of New orleans,

Lao

According to informant,

• This book Tists a number of

people who are members of the Council on Foreign Relations

who have subversive backgrounds.

The informant is one of the

individuals listed in this book

According to informant,

another section of this book accuses him of being a member

of the American League for Peace and Democracy.

The

informant is quite incensed over the information contained

in

this book concerning himselr and connected the information

contained in this book with his recent recall from Hong Kong

by ABC.

He further advised that he has consulted an attorney

about this matter and intends to seek the advice of US

Infermant advised that he has never been a

member of the American League for Peace and Democracy

although he has been a member for many years of the Council

on Foreign Relations.

Informant went on to state that he

wanted to be certain

that this would be a matter of record

in Bureau Headquarters as well as the fact that there is not

one word of truth concerning him in the book. Informant

stated that he understands that COURTNEY and

her husband

reside in New Orleans, La, and are considered to be erratio

individuals in the area of anti-Communist activity. -N-

NY0 indices contain no information concerning

COURTNEY. 0

Enformant was told to handle any matters of

interest which he wished to call to the attention of the

Bureau through the WrO and to refrain from calling the

NYO in the future unless he was present in NYC. Informant

then said that he has been in contact with BORIS G. SIRELNIKOV,

Pravaa correspondent, in woe, and he coula not understand

why he has not been contacted by Bureau agents as he would

contacted

like to be of assistance to the Bureau at the present time

as he has been in the past. -C

It is the opinion of the NO that the American

Broadcasting Company has not been entirely satisfied with

informant's work and he was probably recalled from Hong Kong

for this reason. The informant, in tur, has concluded

that his recall was due to some allegation of disloyalty

in view of a comment made to him in Hong Kong by a British

official. The aforementioned book and its contents have

served to confirm in informant's mind that the reason

for his recall from Hong Kong, In fact, stemmed from an

allegation of disloyalty. v-

The above information is being furnished to the

Bureau and WFO for information and the NYO does not contemplate

taking any further action in this matter. -f

A short while back, Sam Jaffe,

American

Broadcasting

pany

correspondent,

was

ex-

pelled from Moscow

A short while from now, hell

be reporting

for ABC out jof

Hong Kong with hopes of getting

into Red China.

But for the moment. he's in'

the United States between as-

signmcnts, looking back on his

past four years in the Soviet

Union.

Newsman Jaffe made news

this past Fall when he was asked

to leave Russia because John

Scali,

ABC diplomatic corre-

spondent in Washington,

had

yeported an imminent shake-up

in the Russian hierarchy. Rus

Sia responded by sending Jaffe

Lome and by cancelling

a visa

for George Watson, who was, to

• replace him.

Sam had already been sched-

uled to leave Moscow on Dec. 1

for a vacation

in

the United

States before his Hong Kong

assignment.

ABC had both

a Russian

translator and a Russian cam-

eraman working in the Moscow

bureau. The network was told it

could keep both of them on the

payroll and keep their rented

apartment in the city.

"They didn't kick out the net-

york,

Sam

explained.

"They

asked me to leave; they wouldn't

let George Watson in. But they

gave ABC the impression we

might be allowed to put a news

correspondent back in Moscow

in anywhere from three to six

months." "

Russia's Changing,

Says ABC Newsman

File

Changes for Better

Looking back over the past

four year's, Sam Jaffe said Mos-

cow charged in that time.

"May-

be not ais

quickly as we'd like

added.

"But for the

better.

"Today, the people know moe

about

the outside world than

they did four years ago. The

Soviets are no longer jamming

the

Voice of America

or the

Russian-language beamings of

the British Broadcasting

Com-

pany. But Radio Liberty is still

being jammed.

"There was nothing in

the

newspaper about my expulsion.

But the customs officer at the

airport knew:all about it. He

heard the news on the Voice of

• Americal

and more, the Soviet

citizens, i particularly the stu-

dents you make friends with,

'tell you what's going on.

"You see more criticism of thie

Soviet

Union.

Young

people

write in to the newspaper com-

plaining about the lack of con-

sumer goods and their letters

are printed. The press itself gets

critical of aspects of the govern-

ment."

Sam said that there was no

'direct censorship of printed ma-

terial written by foreign corre-

spondents. But permission was

still needed for shooting tele-

vision film.

And undeveloped

photographs couldn't leave the

country. *"They make you de-

velop

them

there and

they

sereen them," Sam said.

He added that Russia was let-

ting more

foreign

cameramen in to work for the

networks.

that the Soviet news-

men are befriending American

newsmen. "Many of

come from them," Sam went on.

• "In some cases,

of course, the

tips are deliberately planted by

• the government itself.

"We didn't feel any tightening

line about the United

retty good about letting for-

eign newsmen travel around the

country. But the new leaders

travel as much as the

shchev, and generated less copy.

Sam spoke wistfully of the

days when he covered Khru-

shchev, whom the ABC corre

spondent got to know well.

On one occasion, Khrushel

singled him out at an Austrian

in MoseGw.

' The Russian leader called Jaffe

lout of a crowd of diplomats and

raised his glass in a toast to the

newsman. Noticing that Jaffe's

was empty,

Khrushchev

• filled it from his own,

his glass again and said: "My

best wishes to you."

It was Jaffe who later scored

a world newsbeat on the ouster

NW 88326 Docld:32989704 Page 385

"Khrushsher was good copy.

He talked off the top of his

head. But Brezhnov and Kosygin

are more sophisticated and they

don't talk much. So it takes more

time to get stories

on what the

government is up to."

* Knows Far East

The 36-yeax-old Jafle is lock-

ing forward to his new assign-

ment in the Far East, an arza

he knows well.

As

15-year-old Merchant

seaman during

World War II,

he

sailed

the

South Pacific.

After the war,

he spent four

months roaming Japan.

Back in the United

States,

Sam studied Far Eastern Af-

fairs at the University of Cali-

fornia in Berkeley, then worked

a year

in

San Francisco

as

reporter-rewrite man for Inter-

national News Service.

While

• there,

he was

dramatized

on

television's "The Big Story" for

solving a murder.

When the Korean War broke

'out, Sam went into the Marings

as

.combat

correspondent.

Following Korea, he became a

staffer for Life magazine and

researched the religions of Asia

for a series called "The World's

Great Religions."

Sam made

through Asia in 1955 for the

Nation magazine, covering the

Asian-African Conference

Indonesia. It was there he got

an exclusive interview with Chou

En-Lai, the first given a western

correspondent since the Chinese

• Revolution.

Later, Jaffe was one of 1,

newsmen invited to visit Com

interviewed Chou, the Chinese

were worried I would editorial-

ize. I used a question-and-an-

swer format and they were sur-

prised and pleased that I didn'

editorialize.c

""They asked men what they

could do for me. I answered that

I wanted to go to Red China?

They told me to wait because,

they weren't ready yet."

Sam Jaffe joined

ABC ind

September, 1961, and was ap-

cointed Moscow

correspondent

• in November of that year.

Previous to ABC, he spent

six

years with the Columbia

cover-

Broadcasting Company Moscow

NESS and EDWARD F. GAMBER.

This interview

was of comparatively short duration and throughout the

interview, this former informant received numerous phone

calls from officials of the American Broadcasting

Corporation (ABC) and individuals in the newspaper, TV

and radio industries. The interview was not satisfactory

in terms of obtaining any detailed information of specific

interest to the Bureau concerning Soviet nationals.

An

appointment, was made with this former informant for the

evening of 11/26/65, and informant was unable to keep

this appointment due to demands made upon his time by

ABC officials. He has been in the US for approximately

3 weeks and on 12/4/65, he is leaving for the West Coast

of the US, expecting to return to NYC on or about 12/20/65.

anne however,

should be noted that

there is no pending specific investigative matter of an

important nature concerning which he should be interviewed

which has come to the attention of this office. -C-

This former informant did talk at some length

concerning his expulsion from the Soviet Union.

He pointed

out that he advised officials of ABC in NYC on a number of

occasions that ABC's Washington Diplomatic Correspondent

JOHN SCALI was in error when he predicted a shake-up of

the Soviet leadership as a result of a power struggle in the

Kremlin.

He said that when he received notice of his expulsion

The August, 1965,

"Diplomatic List" lists Turi I.

Bobrakov as a Second

Secretary,

Soviet Embassy,

Washiagton,

D. C.

A Confidential Source advised on September 22,

1965, that on the preceding day, he had met with Bobrakoy

and engaged in conversation with him.

Source stated. that

Bobrakov seemed mainly to be interested in getting across

the idea that the proposed Multilateral Force, (MLF) is a

• bad idea and 'is a stumbling block which is holding up agree-

ment at Geneva on disarmament.

He said further that Bobrakov

expressed considerable concern over the danger of Germany's

obtaining nuclear weapons.

The Source said he pointed out

to Bobrakov the unusual situation in which the United States

•and the Soviet Union currently found themselves on the same

side at the United Nations Security Council, endeavoring.to

keep the peace.

Bobrakov, however, had no comment on this point.

Bobrakov told the Source that his wife is an

artist, who now has about twenty of her own paintings, most

of which she has done while in the United States.

In the opinion of the Source, Bobrakov is not very

suave or adept at conversation and may be somewhat uncomiort

able in dealing with Americans.

Source also gained the i

pression that Bobrakov's sense of humor is almost nonexistent.

Source stated that Bobrakov attended a reception at

the Embassy of Czechoslovakia en

the evening of September 21,

1965:
