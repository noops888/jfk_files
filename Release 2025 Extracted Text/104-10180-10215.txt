1. In the fall of 1960 ANTRE 1 (Peter J. DI CERVENO)
recruited in Havana at operator candidate, whose name he
cannot recall at this time. This candidate was spotted and
first, contacted by AMPANIC-1, who passed the lead over to
ΑΜΙΡΕ 1. AΡΓΑΝΙC-1 first contacted the candidate on the porch
of the cldof'ercedes Benz Arency at Palecon and Principe Streets,
and ANIRE 1 then then cont contacted subject in the latter's apartment in
the four fourth floor of a building located in the middle of the, 8
block on the East Side of Fenocal Avenue (Infanta) Between (Valle
and San Jose Streets. This building had a store in the first
floor, was painted a pinkish beige, and the apartments were
very small (one bedroom and bath, living-dining room corbina-
tion and a small kitchen). Subject was at the time working in
a hardware store and diving with lis wife and a small child.

3. Subject was trained for a week or so weckor so by AMELEN-1 in a
safehouse located at 39 San Rafael Street) which had been obtained
for that purpose by APΤΟΧ-Ι. ΑΡΓ0X-1 attended the training
sessions as a lock-out, but neither MFCX-1 nor AMCLEN-1 knew
the identity and address of the traince. Training included the
clandestine operation of a RS-1, the use of signal plans, the use
of pads in coding and decoding, and personal security. Training
was conducted in the fall of 1969 after recruitment of Subject

training and the identity of the candidate. Tulfoct was never
activated and was kept on stand-ly for possible use at a later
date. For that purpose tona fides were established ty A-1
and reported to his Co. Subject was not supplied with a Tset
and no signal plans nor pads were issued to him.
4. Al recalls Subject was very secure in his clandestine
contacts and operations. Despite established bona fides, ANIRE 1
had considerable trouble in gaining Subiect's confidence and ol
three preliminary contacts were necessary before retting down to
business, Subject was last contacted by A13E-1 at Subject's
apartment described above, in January or renfuary 1961. At
this time Subject was still willing and ready to work.
ols. It is assumed that Headquarters files on the activities of
AMIRD-1, AMCLEN-1 or AMFOX-1 will contain copies of the training
reports and information reported by AMIRELI. We would appreciate
Headquarters assistance in ascertaining Subject's identity and
present whereabouts in order to determine if he could still be
used operationally inside target area. AMPANIC-1 has been
terminated by JMWAVE PA Branch because of weakness in his personal
security, and it is believed best not to contact him on this
matter if possible.
