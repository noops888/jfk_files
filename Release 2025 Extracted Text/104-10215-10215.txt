Project HI-ANOID
Project HUMANOID is the most important single project of the San Jose
Station, and the basis for all existing and contemplated 050 activities
in the area. It is requested that the restrictions imposed upon project
HUMANOID, as contained in TRS-W-635, copy attached, be lifted at this time,
and the Chief of Station be authorized to direct the activities of HUMANOID
into the following channels.
(a) Direct and close supervision of HUMANOID-3, the Station's
penetration of the Vanguardia Popalar, Costa Rican Communist Party,
in order to utilize fully the agente potentialities. HUMANOID-3
is intelligent, has a wide knowledge of Communist activities, pleas
and personalities and is desirous of cooperating to the extent ci his
ability. After a thorough de-briefing of HUMAFOLD-3 by HUMANOID,
in order to as uaint him, HUMANOID-3 with the Station's specific
Interests and requirements, plus the subsequent close supervision which
will be exercised by HUMANOID, and the continuing close supervision of
HUMANOID-3 by HUMANOID, it is felt that the station will then be in
a position to provide intensive and adequate coverage of the objectives
assigned to it in the San Jose SCI.
(b) Direct and close supervision of HUMANOID-4, the Station's
penetration of the Women's Fronts affiliated with the Vanguardia
Popular. It is felt that the forcer cut-out HUCKLEBONE, who handled
HUMANOID-4 until 1 June 1949, was somewhat inept in his operational
dealings, which possibly may account for what seems to be a lack of
productivity in the HUMANOID project. HUKARCID-4 has an intimate
relationship with active CP members in Costa Rica, both on a low and
high level, and possesses a definite potential for both indepenient
reporting, and for spotting a likely individual to be used as a
parallel to the HUMANOID-3 project. HUMANOID, who will now handle
HUMANOID-4, is capable of directing this agents efforts into the
proper channels, and capitalizing fully ca the talents possessed by
the individual. It is felt that this is another instance whereby
HUHAHOID, by working closely and directly with the individual can
a substantial contribution to the efforts of the San Jose Station.
(c) Direct and close supervision of HUMANOID-1 and HUMANOID-2,
the mail intercept operations presently covering the General Post
Office in San Jose. The information that HUMANOID-1 has access to
is important and is of documentary reliability. His position is
important to the operational structure of the station. MARCID-2 16

a very satisfactory type of agent. He displays a certain azount
of initiative in voluntarily performing tasks not specifically
requested by the Chief of Station through the cut-out HUMANOID.
HUMANOID-2 has demonstrated the qualities of villingness, discretion,.
and cooperation.
(d) As to the principal agent of Project HUMANOID, the
following observations are submitted, which will indicate
unmistakeably the value of this project, and its contribution
to the successful activities of the San Jose Station.
Evaluation of services - As the principal agent
and station cut-out, HUMANOID 18 charged with the direction
and guidance of HUMANOID-1; HUMANOID-2; HUMANOID-3;
HUMANOID. His handling of these agents is carried out in
a professional and efficient canner, and his personal comments
and corrections on their reports, based on his long acquaintance
with local personalitics and conditions, are of considerable
value. His attitude remains enthusiastic and willing.
Evaluation of information The information produced
by the agents being handled by HUMANOID is of great value
to the station. In addition to his own production, this
agento operations are well suited to checking on information
received from other sources.
CONTENTS - Despite the fact that HUMANOID has been working under
certain operational restrictions for a mumber of months, his value to the
station continues to be of major importance. In addition to the tangible
and measureeble information produced by and through him, EUMAFOID bas
proved to be the single post valuable source of background and orientation
data for the Chief of Station. His knowledge of the history of Costa
Rican commamist activities and personalities, and his grasp of the various
revolutionary movements and figures has been freely shared with the
Chief of Station. These "briefing meetings" represent an intangible
contribution to the over-all performance of the Station. HUMANOID 18.
eager to expand his operations and upon the removal of present operational
restrictions it is believed that he can be given further responsibilities,
particularly in the recruiting of additional sub-agents. The station is
presently interested in accomplishing a parallel penetration of the
Commmist Party of Costa Rica, in expanding routine investigative coverage
and in developing additional sources on political movements. It is
believed that HUNAFOID can insure the success of these new ventures.

BIOGRAPHICAL SHICH ROSS L. CROZIER
Ross L. CROZDER was born on 20 June 1922 in De Kalb, Illinois and is the
eldest of five children of a respectable middle-class family. His parents and his
two brothers and two sisters now reside in Sterling, Clinois. Crozier received
his primary and high school education in De Kalb and entered the U.S. Army in
1940, later transferring to the Army Air Corps. He served as an operations and
intelligence specialist, first in the China-India-Burma Theatre and later in
Panama. Crozier was discharged from the service in August 1945, leaving with
the grade of Technical Sergeant. After his discharge, Crozier worked about
three months as a laboratory technician in the Sterling (Illinois) Silica-Cel
Corporation and then returned to the Canal Zone to marry Argentina CORDERO C.,
a Costa Rican girl in December 1945. He then worked about four months
as a stevedore. and labor foreman in the Canal Zone. In April 1946 he
re-enlisted in the Air Force in the Canal Zone, from which he was discharged
three years later in 1949 at his previous grade of Technical Sergeant.
Crozier became an Agency contract agent on 1 June 1949. He was originally
scheduled to be used in Panama but was assigned to the HUMANOLD Project in Costa
Rice instead. While there he successfully handled a high level penetration of the
Costa Rican Communist Party. In 1953 he was sent to Headquarters for training,
and in 1954 he was assigned to PBSUCCESS for a brief period. In July 1954
he signed a new contract in Washington whereby he became the new principal

agent of Project AMPHODARCH. He is under student cover and is actually
working for his BA degree at the University of Habana, for which he has
approximately 1 more year of academic work to complete.
?
Crozier has a healthy appearance and appears to be about 25 instead
32 years of age. He is athletically inclined and has been, and is at
present, interested in organizing and participating in intra-mural
athletics. He is happily married and the father of two children. He
possesses a great deal of integrity, honesty, intelligence, and
resourcefulness. His chief hobby, aside from sports, is photography. He
has made quite a study of picture-taking and has developed a portrait
photo technique which he has found useful in his work and as an aid to
obtaining extra spending money while going to school. The Chief of Habana
Mission and WHD have a strong feeling that this man will perform his duties
in a superior manner and will make MPHODARCH a valuable and worthwhile
project.
