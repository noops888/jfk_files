Soviet fishing boats, under cover of fishing Atlantic waters,

are transporting contraband arms to Latin American countries.

The boats are met outside the territorial waters of those

countries,

arms are transferred in small quantities.

On board the Soviet boats

are only Soviets and a very few

Cubans or other Latin Americans who talk with those who

pick up the arms.

The arms being delivered are of American

manufacture,

including those obtained during the Batista

regime and those taken during the Playa Giron

invasion.

Soviet fishing boats also carry propaganda and pamphlets

containing. military instructions,

the same type of material

being sent by diplomatic pouch from Mexico.

A Belgian in Habana who says he represents a Belgian firm,

has offered the Cuban Government any type and nationality

of arms for payment in dollars:

The Belgian has made a

Similar offer of sale of arms to a representative of an

anti-Castro group in Habana.

In August 1962 a fisherman in Santiago de Cuba said that

on several occasions he had been forced by the Government

to use his boat for transporting small groups of men, in

civilian clothes, and supplies of arms:

He also knew of

other fishermen who had been forced to do the same. The men

and arms were carried to small islands or transferred to other

boats at sea.

Such trips sometimes lasted as long as four or

five days.

The fisherman did not know

the purpose of

destination of the men and arms.

In the last elections Jagan ordered some of his (Indian) Peoples

Progressive Party (PPP) supporters to join the United Front farty

(UTP) in order to impress the worlà in general and the US in particular

that democracy In British Guiana was working.

By virtue of the fact

that the UNP membership was "growing,

" It was "obvious" that Jagan

was not a dictator. I was told this by two Indian Guianese who were

working for Jegan.

I was in British Guiana

for about 12 months on my latest trig.

Since much of this time

was devoted to geological surveying in the

hinterland, I was accompanied by an Indian Guianese doctor. A well-

educated man of the upper-middle class, he told me that arms were

being smuggled into the country from

He did not go into any

detail on the subject, but he did mention that his sons, who were

members of the Progressive Youth Organization (PYO) frequently brought

arms into their home,

kept them for a while, and then disposed of them.

The doctor was so much concerned

-- and pessimistic - about the

situation that he emigrated from the country shortly after I departed.

filariasis presents a problem. At first I did not believe it when my

Indian Guianese doctor said that mosquito bites incurred in the day

time were harmless but mosquito bites at night would infect with

filariasis.

After several months in the back country I believed him.

The disease seems to affect women more than men, causing women's legs

to sweld.

But the disease's affect on men's sexual organs was not

exactly encouraging. - I never did understand why, but my doctor said

that to be effective in detecting the disease a blood test must be

rade at night (preferably between 11 p.m. and l a.m.), and analyzed

quickly.

If filariasis is treated promptly, a man's sexual prowess

can be saved. We lound that the disease

is very common throughout

the country:

Extremist And Police Activities In Venezuela

Venezuela has been afflicted over the past several

months with a rash of Castro-Communist terrorist actions:

Many incidents, involving shootings and robberies, are

connected with

the Movement of the Revolutionary Left,

the Venezuelan Communist Party, and the Armed Forces

of National Liberation -

the Castro-Communist group

credited with the destruction at the Maracaibo oil

fields during the Cuban crisis.

These activities are

probably designed to discredit and weaken the Betan

court Government.

The police have demonstrated considerable proficiency.

in preventing major outbreaks and in acting rapidly

to

arrest terrorists.

They have rounded up extremists

responsible for the holdup and looting of a printing

supply warehouse and the burning of the Dupont paint

warehouse and have captured

the Communist leader of

guerrilla bands operating in the Falcon area of

northwestern Venezuela:

Cuban Subversion in Other: latta Amertean Countries

I. General

1. The Castro regine dentes that matertal support le being given

any anti-regime group outaide Cuba, Castra eletu that euch assiatence is

unnecessary since the

people of these countrtes, thinks to Cube's example,

are becontog aware of their revolutionary potentia.

Ise publicly stated

position of the Cubon leaders is thet their country,

"the first soctoliet

state in America, " hus become the emmple, the "pescon".

In fact, hovever,

Cuba's moral and material support to Cominist and Commniat-influenced

groups has been felt in vorying degrees in every one of the 19 other latin

Amertoon repolice.

The Castro regime bas becone an effective instrument

of the Sino-Soviet ottort to weaken and eventually destroy demperatic

politiesl inctitutions in Iatin America,

Cuban subversion has become more nubtle since 1959, whon a Cuban-

mounted expedationary force van launched agatust the Dominicon Republle and

euniler "Invasion forcon" left Cuba for abortive attacke on the goverumente

of Fanama, Mceragua, and Isiti, Now Cubon subversive efforto generally fall

in three cotogortes:

The indoctrination end training of hundreds of latin

Americans in Cuba;

b.

The Intenaive propaganda beined at lotin America by Cuban

radio stations and pirculated through printed material and

the Cuban cubeidized internattomi "nevs" agency, anô;

C.

The covert matertal support given subversive groups in

other countries.

II.

other countries of the worlds Hundreds of youns Iatin Americans have been

In addition to whatever formal

trining they receive in auth, many of them recelve training in guerrilla

Unscrupulous or cureless erns dealers in the US

have also contributed to the arna traffic from which pro-Cestro groups have

benefitted, directly or indirectly.

15. As the following country-by-country rundown indicates, Cuban support

for subveraive activity has alfected in varying degrees every one of the 19

other Latin Aner lan colatried.

Argentina:

Ernesto "Che" Cuevara, an Argentine by birth,

han zeteined his deep interest in Argentina's political affairs. On 25 May,

the Argentine national boliday, he addressed the group of Argentine citiseus

resident in Cube and told then that he hoped that nect

colebrating in Argentine under "tho flag of socialion" ear they would e

At another point

in this addrece he said! "Our revolution ie one which needs to expand its

1deas. and other people are helping we. Let the other peoples of the hemisphere

get angry and take up irs or seize power and old un in this task which is

the task of the entire hentephere and of humanity."

The Argentine commity in Cuba last April organized the

"Cuban-Argentine Iriendship Institute" with beodquarters in Havens.

One

of the leaders is dahn Willion Cooke, who was for a time chief of former

Argentine dictator Peron's political

machine in Argentina. Cooke continues

active in that faction of the Peronista party wich seeks concerted action

with the Argentine Commalats: Cooke maintaine reguler contact with syupathizers

Inside and outside Argentina through travelers and through his wife,

Altele Iguren de Cooke, a renident of Monteviãeo, Uruguey, who apparently

has regular nans of communiestion with Individuale in Argentina. Argentine

eitizens have been recruited through this channel to go to Cube for training.

There are elso strong indications thet terrorist activittes by Argentine

Peronisto and Commniats have been encouraged and perhaps assisted through

this channel:

Prior to the diplonatie break between Argentina and Cuba

last February, the Cuban embassy in Buenos Atres provided financial aselstance

to anti goverment groupe there.

An Argentine Journalist who has contacts in

the comurlet party there reported lost Decenber, for intence, that the

Argentine Comminist party had receired the sun of 50,000 pedos from the

cuben embassy as a contribution to the railway workers who were then on

strtke in the province of Cordobe.

Though the fuban embassy 10 no longer in Buenos Aires, Cuban

clandestine assistance to Argentine Peronfet-Communist groups continues:

On

19 July of thie year the federa golice in Buenos Atres reported the un-

earthing of a center of Communiot and Peronist activities in the capital.

Two Buenos Aires policenen were shot and killed at a surburban warehouse in

June. Investigations revealed that e quantity of explosives and propagande

were stored in the varehouse.

The trail led to the arrest of one Jose

Maria Aponte, a journalist and known Peronist setiviat, and one Mario

Maest, owner of the firn which oned the warehouse.

It was revealed that

Massi bad been maintaining contect vith Cuben Commnists, with John W1l1lem

Cooke, and with an unidentified voman associated with the Criban embassy in

Uruguay who was probably Alicie Iguren de Cooke referred to above. According

to the Argentine police investigation, come 150 Agentine eltisens had been

sent fron Argentina to Cube (through Uruguay and Mexieo) for training in

guerrilla varfare.

On thel? return to Argentina, these men were to be uned

In planed activities in the provinces of Formose, Tucumen, Salta, and the

wooded areas of eastern Argentina. A number of other individuals were appre-

hended by the Argentine police in connection with the subversive activity

revealed in these inveetigations.

Bollvie: Bolivia has been the recipient of spectel Cuban

attentions. The number of Bolivians receiving "scholarshipa" in Cube this

year-between 130 and 150-- appeara disproportionately higk. The Bolivian

government felt objiged to request the departure of Cuben Arbassador Tebares

In 1900 and of Cuban Charge Gorcia Iriane In 1961 for blatent Intervention

in internel Bolivian estairs, including support for Bolivian Commniate and

attempta to Incite extreme leftist mbers of the governing IR party to leave

the party. In June 1961, the Bolivian governent publiahed a sertes of

documente linking the Cuban embessy vith a Commniet conspiracy to seize

control of the government.

One of these documants, a statement by an arrested

Bolivian agitator who had been in close contact with the Cuben embeasy,

gave the names of & number of bolivians who had recelved financial support

from the Cuban embassy. This evidence vas uced to justify the request for

the Cuban charge'e recall.

The present Cuban charge In Bollvie, Ranon Aja, has aleo been

active though perheps a bit more disereet than his predecessors. He has

been particularly energette in cultiveting relations with Bolivian campeninos.

The peasant unton in the Clize Velley of Bolivie has been reported te be the

recipient of Cuban finencial assistance.

Brazil: During the pasttwo years the Castro rogine has

developed increasingly close ties with Franciaco Julloo, solf-proclaimed

Marxist and leader of the Peasant Leagues in the troubled northeast region

of Brazil. Juliao, wbose wife and children are resident in Cube, has

traveled there on several occasione, and a nuber of his essociates and rank

and-file menbers of the Leagues have gone to Cube for agricultural

training which le undoubtedly heavily lerded with ideological indoctrination.

Transportation direct from northeast Brazil to Cube has been provided by

Subana airlines on at least one occeston..

Cireumatantial evidence strongly

suggests that Juliao has received financial assistance for his movement from

the Cubon goverment.. Brazil1en Comminiot leaders have privately steted, in

fact,

Juliao'o Peasent Léngues have received not only money but also

shipmento of small army from Cube.

These Brazilien Cormnist leadero also

said thet the reason Julioo sent bie fantly to Cuba was hie feer that they

night be endengered in the civil war he expects to erupt shortly in Braall.

The Cuhan goverment has also during the past year cultivated

particularly close relations vith leaders of the dissident Communiet Party

of Breatl (CPB): One of the CPD lenders who had visited Cuba lost May

told a friend of a long conversation be hed had with Fidel Castro in late

May. Castro expressed identity of feeling with the digsident Breatllan

Commnlots and eritieized the regular Commiat party for its fallure "to

take o strong revolutionary line" in accordance with the decision of the

22ad party congress of the Communist porty of the Soviet Undon.

Castro

approved the insurrectionary polley of the CPB and urged the leaders to

organise guerrilla activities and stort the revolutionary movement in Braail

"ao soon as poasible." Castro adviced them that goverment reprisale against

revolutionary ation in Brazil would serve only to increase popular dis

content in Breatl and swell the ranke of the revolutionaries. He advised

CPB leaders to give special emphasie to securing civride a base es possible

anong agricultural vorkers and the inhabitante of rural areas.

The Cuban embassy in Rio de Jenetro, like Cuban embassies

elsevhere in Latin America, has been a source of assistente to Communiet und

pro Commist elemente. Last May leaks to the Brazilien press reported 110-

cussions in the Brazilian cabinet on the subversive activities being directed

by Cuban arbesandor Josquin Hernandes Armse.

Policies Toward Latin America

42.

Here Castro has more capability for independent

action than in any other field encept the internal politica of Cuba.

Gastro is deeply committed to a policy of armed insurrection

throughout Latin America. Because of his own experience he has

a deep-seated belief that only through insurrection can revolution

be promoted in Latin America. Further, he apparently believes that

a successful revolution in another Latin American country would give

great impetus to the revolutionary movement and would also consoli-

date hie own regime in Cuba. In trying to foment insurrections, he

apparently does not bolieve it crucial that he cannot now give direct

military asstatance to them, nor does he seera to consider it impor -

tant whether he has or has not Soviet support. For the Soviets,

however, such an infesible approach emacke of the Chinese position

and causes great problems in dealing with other Latin American

Communists. Most importent, however, It is probable that the

Soviete believe such a posture will damage Soviet prospecte for

penetration of Latin America and inevitably bring about a confronta-

tion with the US.

SUPPLEMENT

THE CASTRO THREAT TO LATIN AMERICA

Despite diminished prestige, especially among government

leaders, Castro retains great influence over politically

unsophisticated Latin Americans.

He is also supported by

Western Hemisphere Communist

parties and the vast majority

of extreme leftists.

Castro's main appeal lies in his claim

to be

the leader of

a successful revolution against "Yankee

imperialism" and in the support he is ready to provide

subversive activities throughout Latin America.

The degree to which Cuba is involved in current

hemisphere unrest is not

clear.

Antigovernment nationals and

Communists of various Latin American countries, however,

have made frequent visits to Cuba to receive pro-Castro

indoctrination and propaganda. During 1962, 1,000 to 1,500

are believed to have received

intensive education and training

in sabotage and guerrilla warfare:

Significant representation

has

been noted from Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru,

Bolivia, Paraguay, and Nicaragua. There is no definite

proof that Cuba is now exporting arms to any dissident groups,

but propaganda materials, explosives, and financial support are

reliably reported to have been furnished.

Cuban leaders have also called wiih increasing frequency

for open

rebellion as the "only road" to liberation for the

Americas; they have been especially vociferous

since the first

of the year. Leading officials, such as Castro, Blas Roca,

Che Guevara, Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, and Juan Marinello are

among those calling for revolutionary violence. The

"Betancourt tyranny" in Venezuela has been designated a

primary target, but Peru and Chile apparently also have high

priority. • The use of the Prensa Latina organization and

the agent network already in existence makes it virtually

sure that Havana will intensify its clandestine activities..

Latin American governments are generally now more alert to

Castro's threat.:

Inadequate security forces and widespread

poverty throughout the area, however, make it almost certain

that Cuban-supported insurgency will have an effect out of

proportion to the number of people involved.

Following Fidel Castro's call for revolution in

Che Guevara

recently that they must prepare for simultaneous

revolutions

Long-time Communist leader Blas Roca, on 23 January,

praised Venezuelan Communists for their recent

Venezuela has long been a

Cuban Anniversary Celebrations (See pictures following)

The Cuban Armed Forces parade in Havana yesterday

included infantry, naval, artillery, armor, and air

formations.

The

most significant display was that

of SA-2 missiles and possible cruise missiles.

Ground units included 15 companies of the 2d Western

Army: units of the National Militia,

and other

infantry onits in a

"new parade

step" resembling the

goose step.

The artillery unit had antitank guns,

artillery,

multiple rocket launchers and

AA artillery.

Ihree battalions of medium tanks, heavy tanks and

assault guns, along with the surface-to-air and possible

cruise missiles made up the final unit of the parade.

The air formations included helicopters, propeller-

type training planes, and MIG-15's, 19's

and 21's.

Soviet participation in the parade has not been

established,

alihough Soviets and Czechs may have piloted some of

the aircraft.

Premier Castro's speech following the parade brought

no surprises aside from its unusual brevity.

He

made an effort to indicate Cuban control of the air

defense system, including the SA-2's, and, in a

probable reference to US reconnaissance flights, said

there could be an incident "at any time".

and hone

Castro reiterated the five demands he first made

after the announcement that the Soviets would

withdraw offensive missiles from Cuba. He

included his usual anti-US statements

and slurs at

President Kennedy and made a low-keved appeal for

2th the minis, plod see call asts

revolution in Latin America,

on Venezuela, and cited Cuba's

"historic task ..

Of-serving as an exemple" for that revolution.,

In the USSR, Cuban and Soviet spokesmen lauded Cuban-

Russian friendship and unity, and the Soviet

spokesman, suslov, pledged that his country would

"never leave Revolutionary Cuba alone in distress."

reportodly continues, the threat of retaliatory action trom forces

rallying around deposed Air Force Chief Lemus has apparently

diminished,

and the majority of the armed forces still supports

President Ydigoras.

The President's intention with regard to

leitist ex-President Arevalo, who plans to return and seek the

presidency in next December's elections, is an unsettling factor.

The armed forces universally oppose Arevalo.

Some factions want

to replace Ydigoras with

a civilian-military junta and call new

elections before Arevalo becomes eligible to run in March.

Should

Arevalo return, the military will probably move to prevent his

candidacy and the coming months may be critical.

Honduran President Villeda Morales, although not a strong

leader, is expected to complete his term.

The ruling Liberal

Party will probably retain the Presidency in the October elections,

and maneuvering for the nomination has begun. Rodas Alvarado,

President of the Congress and one of the three leading contenders,

has used

his position to build up strength, but the armed

forces

regard him as

the least desirable and a developing anti-Rodas

coalition may prevent his nomination. Either of the three leading

candidates would probably follow

present government's policies,

including its relatively soft Communist stand.

The Communists,

while not

yet a direct threat, are

steadily increasing their

influence in the labor field

and

are exploiting the country's

discouraging political, economic, and social conditions.

El salvador, faced with a serious Communist threat about

two years ago, continues to show political and economic progress,

but there are

clouds on the horizon.

President Rivera, who

assumed control last summer in a full return to constitutional

government, still has

widespread support and military backing.

The government is moving ahead with its reform program, but

there is

some resistance to the proposed new income taxes.

Communist activities have been curbed, but the Communists

still

retain

a subversive capability particularly among labor and

student groups.

There is concern over the likely election of a

pro-Communist as rector of the university, a center of sub-

version and intrigue.

Costa

Rica continues to be one of the most democratic and

politically stable. countries in Latin America but there are

reverberations of unrest stemming from the deteriorating economic

situation.

The

Fuling National Liberation Party, which was

returned to powei in last year's election in

a bitterly contested

but peaceful

election, represents

the liberal left, although it

includes a number of

moderates such

as President Orlich and some

members of his cabinet. The Communist Party is small and illegal

bus wall organized and effectively led.. It recently instigated

disorders in the banana zone and,

while not an immediate threat,

economic conditions worsen.

On the internal scene, President

Chiari has

failed to provide a strong administration. Corruption

the chronically depressed economy remains stagnant.

The stability which has marked the 30-year dominance of

Mexico's Party of Revolutionary Institutions (PRI) is gradually

being eroded.

Extreme

right and left factions of the PRI are

vying for domination.

In attempting to placate both, President

Lopez Mateos has adopted inconsistent and vacillating policies,

pleasing neither group.

Forces outside the PRI also pose an

increasing threat - particularly the recently formed Independent

Peasant Central (CCI) with which leftist ex-President Cardenas is

associated.

To undercut the CCI, the government plans to complete the land

Permanent Secretary External Affairs Ministry told Embassy

fishing industry as well as presenting possible security

problem.

He asked whether US could provide nore detailed

information on these ships which would operate from Soviet-

built "fishing base" in Cuba.

In view of reports, he planned to urge Cabinet to take early

action on deciding end publicizing limits of Jamaican territosial

waters in order to avoid incidents with Soviets and Cubans.

He is considering recommending to Cabinet that Jamaica claim

territorial waters of six-and-six miles. Jamaica now apparently

claims three-mile limit.

Although COJ obviously counting on receipt US military equip.

SUPPLEMENT

THE SITUATION IN CENTRAÏ AMERICA, PANAMA, AND MEXICO

Central America is relatively stable. Preparations are

under way for President Kennedy's scheduled meeting with

the Chiefs

of State of these countries at San Jose, Costa Rica, on 18 and 19

March.

Tensions

are rising,

however,

in those countries having

elections scheduled this year; Mexico's political stability is

threatened; and

the Cuban subversive potential remains a problem

throughout

the area.

During the forthcoming meeting, an attempt will be made to

center discussions on areas of common interest. Economic integra-

tion of the Central American region - one of the major objectives

of the Alliance for Progress Program -- will undoubtedly be em-

phasized.

Central America, which has been moving toward greater

political

unity, has begun to take steps toward economic integra-

tion, and presently envisages the creation of a Common Market by

1965.

The Cuban

subversive

threat is also likely to be given top

priority.

All of the Central American countries regard this as

one of the major problems and are seeking ways to meet it.

government's Liberal Party (PLN) candidate and hand-picked by the

Somozas -- is expected to win easily, however.

sition to Schick collapsed when the

only opponent is

Diego Manuel Chamorro Bolanos, a last-minute

candidate of the splinter Nicaraguan Conservative Party (PCN),

whose entry into the race seems

to have been engineered by the

government to provide a semblance of opposition.

to create disorders

before or during the elections, but the

Nicaraguan National Guard is believed capable of controlling

any. troubles short of a general uprising or well-coordinated

rebel invasion - neither of which seems likely.

Anti-Somoza Nicaraguans have alleged fraudulent registra-

tions and may attempt to challenge the

elections.

Although

Schick may not turn out to be a

Somoza puppet, opposition

suspicions will be reinforced with the likely retention of

General Anastasio Somoza as Director of the National Guard.

Repercussions in Guatemala from the recent abortive Air

Force revolt have not been too serious. Although plotting

TO DISCUSS WITH LOPEZ MATEOS.

2. ' LOMBARDO GAVE ROMERO THE FOLLOWING REASONS FOR HIS TRIP TO

BRAZIL. HE SAID THAT A GROUP OF BRAZILIAN PERSONALITIES AND

INTELLECTUALS HAD CONVOKED A CONGRESS WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO BE HELD.

IN RIO DE JANEIRO IN MARCH 1963.

HE SAID THE TWO PRINCIPAL AIMS

OF THE CONGRESS ARE:

LA.: TO CREATE AN ORGANIZATION IN DEFENSE OF CUBA.

B.: TO EXAMINE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS EXISTING IN LATIN

AMERICAN COUNTRIES IN ORDER TO PROMOTE THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC

DEVELOPMENT OF LATIN AMERICA.

•LOMBARDO SAID THAT SOMETHING WENT WRONG IN BRAZIL BECAUSE,

APART: FROM THE COMMITTEE WHICH CONVOKED THE CONGRESS, A SECOND

SEPARATE COMMITTEE HAD SPRUNG UP WHOSE AIMS ARE THE SAME, AND

THAT A SORT OF RIVALRY HAS DEVELOPED BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS.

LOMBARDO SAID THE RESULT WAS "THAT MY COMRADES IN EUROPE HAVE

ASKED ME TO GO TO BRAZIL TO INTERVENE: IN THE MATTER, TO TRY TO ORGANIZE

A SINGLE UNITED COMMITTEE, AND MAKE DEFINITE PREPARATIONS FOR THE

HOLDING OF THE CONGRESS IN ORDER TO ENSURE ITS SUCCESS. " LOMBARDO

SAID "THE COMRADES IN EUROPE" SHOULD HAVE SENT AN ARGENTINE, A CHILEAN;

A URUGUAYAN, OR SOMEONE NEARER BRAZIL, BUT THEY INSISTED ON SENDING

HIM BECAUSE HE HAS EXPERIENCE, AND THEY ARE CONVINCED THAT HE CAN

STRAIGHTEN THINGS OUT SATISFACTORILY.

On January 31, Iwas visited by the two top American ex-

ecutives of a Brazilian subsidiary of a large American corporation. §

They said that their firm, following a practice instituted some years

ago of periodically sampling worker sentiment in their plants, had

just finished a small survey conducted very informally by trusted

Brazilian employees among 55 or 60 of their semi-skilled workers

to discover how the latter would feel about the establishment in Brazil

of a communist system of government. The result of this survey was

so shockingly different from that of earlier pulse-taking that these

executives thought the Consulate General should know about it. Eighty

percent of the workers approached had indicated that while they did not

pretend to know much about communism, they thought they would be

better off under a communist regime than they are at present. Among

the reasons most commonly given were

beitet things were so bad in

Brazil that any change would be for the set and that communism

would put an end to the rascality (malandragem) which is so prevalent.

The other twenty percent thought that communism would be bad for the.

Iwo straws in the wind that have come recently to my atten

on the part of at least some segments of São Paulo's working and

managerial classes.

Further indications in support of or in refutation

of these signs will be submitted as they are noted.

OFFICIAL USE ONLY

The company executives attributed the pro-communist

sentiment.as revealed, mainly to the economic difficulties ex-

perienced by low-income families as a result of the rampant.

inflation.

They said their labor relations were good, that while

their pay scales were not as high as those in some other industries,

some popular fringe benefits were provided, and that to the best of

their knowledge there had been no communist agitators at work

among their employees.

Not long before this visit I was lunching one day at the

Jockey Club with Sr. Paulo Ayres Filho, a Brazilian banker and

pharmaceutical manufacturer who is the spark-plug of IPES

(Instituto de Pesquisas Economicas e Sociais), the principal demo-

cratic action group in the local business world. Looking around him

at the other tables, occupied by a good many well-known figures of

São Paulo's conservative upper classes, Si. Ayres said to me,

"Apart from the two of us, there isn't a man in this dining room who

'is seriously concerned over the communist danger in Brazil."

No conclusions, obviously, should be drawn from such

slender indications.: It has been my observation, however, that

most Brazilians either believe that a communist take-over would

be impossible in Brazil, or believe that even if it occurred, it

would take a relatively mild form with which they could live.

The

Brazilian's boasted calm, which is genuine and in most circumstances

a virtue, could in the present state of affairs be the cause of his undoing

Peruvian Communist Elements Coordinating Their Activities

Orthodox Communists in Paru are

apparently putting

aside their differences and

moving toward closer

co-operation with the extremist Trotskyist faction, '

believed to be leading the recent outbreak of

disorders.

The groups are reportedly co-ordinating

previously random plans to carry out extensive

destruction of industrial and agricultural

installations and to provoke uprisings

Cubans and

other Latin American nationals as well as Havana

and Moscow-trained

Peruvians

are said to be

instrumental in this latest development.

Members of the Peruvian junta have expressed

serious concern

over the internal situation

and hinted that they favor

strong action.

Although

constitutional guarantees have been: suspended. in a

fourth department and several Army units have been

moved into the areas of disordors, the junta has

taken no further action.

It has reguested riot

control equipment from the US and says it is

ready to embark on an anti-Communist program upon

assurance that the equipment is forthcoming.

Peruvian Junta Makes Firm Anti-Communist Move

Continued Communist-incited disorders and an alleged

Havana-Moscow plan to take over the government

prompted the military junta to suspend constitutional

guarantees in Peru and institute

nationwide state

of siege early on 5 January.

Military commanders

assumed political control in

their respective zones,

and a

reported 800 Communist Party leaders

and pro

Communist subversives have been arrested.

The

Lima headquarters of

several Communist and

Communist-tront organizations, as were as their

publications, have been closed.

According to the Communise plan, subversive activity

was to have been intensified between 15 and 20

January in all parts of Peru, with assaults

on

banking and commercial institutions, military

garrisons, vital communications facilities,

and

universities. A clandestine radio station

operating

on the Bolivian border allegedly was to direct

and co-ordinate this activity.

The junta has regarded members of the leftist but

non-Communist American Popular

Revolutionary

Alliance (APRA) a greater danger than the

Communists and originally tended to blame

them

for the disorders.

There

is no proof that APRA

has been involved

in anything but legitimate

strike activity.

Suspension of constitutional

guarantees would enable the junta to strike at

APRA do discredit and

weaken

it before the scheduled

elections next June. (SECRET)

REIGN DISSEM

SUPPLEMENT

THE VENEZUELAN SITUATION

A number of high-ranking Cuban leaders since the first of

the year have publicly called for revolution, in other Latin

American countries, with Venezuela singled out as a country

with top priority.

Coinciding with these appeals have been reports that the

Venezuelan Communist Party

(PCV) planned to step up terrorist

activity to discredit President Betancourt before his US

visit.

The recent incidence of terrorism, which has included

attacks on the US Chamber of Commerce office building and

burning of Sears, Roebuck warehouses, is apparently part

of this campaign.

Involved in the current terrorism is the Armed Forces of

National Liberation (FALN).

The FALN, although purporting to

represent all of the opposition, includes some proninent

Communists and is emerging as a

paramilitary force of the PCV

with its main strength in the Caracas area.

Guerrilla bands also operate in western Venezuela, but

there is no firm evidence that

their activity is coordinated

with that in the Caracas area.

Venezuelan army units, with

air support, have been used in a recent campaign against

these

guerrillas.

The armed forces are generally capable of maintaining

internal security and of defending the nation's borders

against neighboring countries.

The vast majority supports

constitutionality and is loyal to the Betancourt government.

The armed forces would not hesitate, however, to take over the

government in order to maintain order or to forestall a

Communist uprising. The armed forces were earlier greatly

frustrated over the government's inaction against Communist-

instigated disorders.

Betancourt's recent willingness to

take more vigorous

action, however, coupled with

the strong

support given the US during the Cuban crisis, has overcome

much of this dissatisfaction, and armed forces' support of

the government is greater now than it was six months ago.

The officer corps is generally free of Communist

penetration, although there has been some infiltration in the

Marine corps, two or three battalions having been involved

in leftist-led revolts during the spring of 1962.

Extremist And Police Activities In Venezuela

Venezuela has been afflicted over the past several

, months with a

rash of Castro-Communist

terrorist actions.

Many incidents, involving shootings and robberies, are

connected with

the Movement of the

Revolutionary Left,'

the Venezuelan Communist Party, and the Armed Forces

of National Liberation - the Castro-Communist group

credited with the destruction at the Maracaibo oil

fields during the Cuban crisis.

These activities are

provably designed to discredit and weaken the Betan-

court Government.

The police have

demonstrated considerable proficiency

in preventing major outbreaks and in acting rapidly

to arrest terrorists.

They have rounded up extremists

responsible for the holdup and looting of a printing

supply warehouse and the burning of the Dupont paint

warehouse and have

captured the Communist leader of

guerrilla bands operating in the lalcon.

Venezuelan Communists Plan to Increase Violence

As part of its terrorist campaign, the Venezuelan

Communist Party reportedly plans

to mark the fourth

anniversary of Betancourt's presidency on 13 February

by guerrilla bombings in the Caracas area.

Other

Communists are to see to it that the capital is

flooded with propaganda that day. According to un-

confirmed

reports, Venezuelan authorities have

charred the Castro covernment with ordering the recent

terrorism in both Venezuela and Colombia under an

extensive plan to create collective panic and insecurity

in both countries.

Colombian military authorities

have reportedly crawn up a plan to prevent terrorism

in Colombia's cities.

SUBJECT: Alternetive US Public Poature on Subversion in Latin America

1. Although our public posture on subversion in Latin Anerica may

be too fIrmly estoblished for Instant and radical revision, the following

enalysis is offered on the assumption that some change in emphasis 1s

both possible anû desirable, not or at some time in the future.

2. Given the existence of a Cormunist state, of either mnjor per-

suasion, what 1s the likellhood that It vill engage in subversion toward

neighboring states?

a. Total. All emperience of the pest forty years demonstrates

*that a Communist state emenates subversion as the sun emanatés heat.

b. But lot us be clear that two kindo of subversion are involved:

(1) Hardwere-centered - that is, funda, guns, tools of

sabotage.

(2) Egalitarian and libertarian Ideale.

3. How much does this fact of Inevitable subversion raise the prob

ability of Conmunion spreading to target countries?

Subversion is never a sufficient condition and frequently

not a necessary one?

b. I subversion is really dangerous to & target state, there

1s per se something seriously wrong In that state. (Franca"s "Nosser

Tallacy" of 1956; France emberted on the Suez adventure on the assumption

that 1i Nasser were disposed of, tie trouble in Algeria would magically

disapped:".

Although the gane was not played cut, few vould dispute the

conclusion that Trance's assumption was wrong; or, fox that matter,

that france would have been in an even deoper noress if her military

forces had managed with the British to cocupy Cairo.)

How feasible is it to control subversion at the source without

destroying the Communist State?

Usually it 15 infeasible to do so or the costs are prohibitive.

For instance, the costs of a protracted tight quarantine which

could prevent the export both of herdire oriented and idea subversion,

would be very high, even if the activity vere accepted by Cube and the

soviet Union.

This would mean inspecting every vessel, searching every

travoier, forcing planes down for inspection, etc. We submit (a) that

ideas would still be exported and (1) that by so doing we ould magnify

the Importance of Cuba beyond inagination. It would become a kind of

forbidden fruit. The analogy with prohibition in this country comes to

This course involves an increment of prestige and lure to Cuba

which would be likely to outweigh the doubtless desirable diminution in

the export of trained subversives and associated hardrare. Furthermore,

given the success of such an effort, the obvious soviet counter would be

to une other channels which we could not survell without major Faet-

West

confrontation, The Cuban subversion export organization night wel

move to Moscow, Prague and or even Pelping.

Therefore, to take & public

stance opposed to cuban subversion vithout having resolved on Invasion

ls to be cormitted to a policy bound to demonstrate US impotence.

5. Is we want to control subrorsion at the source by destroying

the Communist State, Cuba, how usedll, 10 1t for us publicly to emphasize

hardwre-centered subversion no the renson?

For many people outside of the Us, even the export of

subversion by forcê and sabotage also involves ideas and dedication,

as woll as funds, arms, end other coulament. (lie, for example, are

not ashaned of the Bay of Pigs expedition except that it failed.)

b. Usually attitudes toward violent subversion depend on

attitudes toward thetarget. (Example:

acts against Jiminez, IrajIllo

ala not offend US/ nost of Latin Arrica/ most of the world; the paral-

lel todry: Somoza, Yalgoras, Stroesser): We run the danger of falling

into the USSR projection of the US as the "world gendarme." Subversion

directed agalast the Dutch goverment would outrage not only all Americans,

but also all non-Communist Europoone, its legitinacy 18 total,. But the

sane can not be said for nost IA goveronents, The difference is decisive

and perhaps sometimes neglected.

c. Most people generally recognize that when violent subversion

Is powerful, it 1s because it tops funömental sources of discontent.

d. We In the US tend to 100k at subversion In Latin America

from the point-of-view of hardwire. But a great deal of the

subversion

In Intin America is or at least appears an idea centered, not hardware-

centered. The export of "ared sagression" by dedicated revolutionaries

1s only i part of the process. Another part, which is at least as inpor...

tant, and probably nore so, is the export of propaganda.

This, however,

to wuch of the world, Including Latin Anerica outside öf the oligarchies,

will appear as an export of idens and idenla perhaps wrong, but never

thelese ideas). Our approach, then, tends to pass rather than neet the

Iatino vierpoints. We are very clone to putting ourselvee into the

position of the Tsarist gendarmes who tried to use brute force against

the power of lders. the trep le that we way seem thereby to be aclot

ledging the decline and imminent fall of our own ideas.

One consequence of this line of reasoning would be that,

11 we ever find it necessary to Invade Cuha, we should do so "to stop

the firing squado," "to guarantee tree elections," -- but not to save

somora:

6. How feasible is it for us to control both kinde of subversion

at the target rather then at the source?

aw. It i1s often feasible. This is how we have in fact success

fully controlled subversion except in the dubious case of S. Vietnam.

Even in the difficult case of Greece, we succeeded by a combination of

miltary and economic measures.

D. The point is not that this 1s alvays a feasible way of hand.

11ng the problem, rather 15 le oiten practicable and also often the most

desirable way.

7. Suppose that wa decided to Invade Cuba to control subversion

with the result (three cases):

That we restored the statur quo ante Castro,

ba: That for reasons of expediency no try to maintain Castro's

"refoma" - 1.a., what many Lotinoes would regard as "socialism."

c. That ve gave the Cuban people an obvious free choice, no

matter what ensued.

How would the prospecte for Commuism In the western Hemlophere

be affected?

Case A: Boomerang - we would almost certainly enhance the

prospects 10I Cormunism.

Case b: Thore would be strong popular latin American support,

some governmental outrege, but the prospecte fos Commulen would be

aiminished.

Case C: Paradosically, the result would depend on what ensued,

because nost Latin Americans do not trust the US (and particularly would

be akeptical of "free elections" 1f US soldiers were present).

CONCLUSIONS

1. Conditions in nost parte of Latin America ere such that sub-

version (Cuban or Bloc or both, le really dangerous.

2. Since this 1o so, the us public posture should not recognize

this; and we should abstain fron public pronouncements that subversion

1e conceivably a casus belli.

3. The roint of-vlew set forth in this paper, Insofar as 1ù con
