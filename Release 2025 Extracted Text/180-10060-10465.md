Status of Document:

Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 9

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United

States or to any individual.

May 25, 1977

Honorable Louis Stokes

Chairman

House Selectcommittee

on Assinations

U.S. House of Representatives

Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Chairman:

I am writing in order to clarify the present

situation regarding the receipt of back pay, which in my case

had accrued from January 1, 1977 until April 1l, 1977.

On that date in April, I visited your office

to inform you that my husband had received the Republican

Party endorsement in Philadelphia's race for District Attorney,

and that I would be returning to Philadelphia to join him in

his effort to win that election. However, during that same

conversation, I expressed concerns of the

timing of my depart-

ure, for fear that if I left my position as Staff Counsel prior

to the Committee receiving its funding, I might not receive

my back pay.

In response to

your personal "moral commitment ,my concerns, you offered me

that 1 could leave and your

full assurance that the 35% which had been deducted from my

salary for more than three months, would definitely be forward-

ed to me upon the Committee receiving its funding from the

no upon the comte n

house.

than $800.00 of those monies owed me.

O none oceane mone

While I would never consider asking for any-

thing to which I am not entitled, I respectfully submit that

I do deserve to receive that for

which I worked during that

3-1/2 month period.

I remain confident that this matter will be

reconciled in accordance with our previous conversation. If

there are any problems in this regard, please do not hesitate

to notify me.

I extend my best wishes and hope that all is

going well with the Committee.

Mrs. Terry W. Lazin

The Plaza Apartments

18th and Parkway

Philadelphia, Pa. 19103

Dear Mrs. Lazin:

I am sorry that there is a misunderstanding relative

to my position on your back salary. I have consistently held that

any employee would receive back salary if such could be worked

out before the employee terminated services with the Committee.

You were paid the maximum salary possible for the eleven days

you worked in April. Unfortunately, your termination date of

April ilth precluded you from receiving the full amount you

would have been entitled to if you had stayed with the Committee

longer.

The Rules of the House prohibit paying salary to anyone not

actually employed by the House. Furthermore, keeping you on the

payroll after your termination while you were actively working in

your husband's political campaign could prove very embarrassing

to the Committee.

You did fine staff work with the Committee and if you

decide to return at some future date we shall be happy to give

you every consideration.

Sincerely,

LOUIS STOKES

Chairman
