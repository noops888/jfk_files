SUMMARY.

The Reference A. AUSPELL exhibit toured six

Latin American countries during a five-sooth perlod, February-June

with the exception

of Guayaquil and La Paz -- where excel-

lent results were achieved - the tour was only moderately success-

must be classified a

Santiago and

Montevideo.

According to ANSPELL,

the total number of persons who

viewed the

exhibit was 6,720:

Another 2,792 persons reportedly

atiended conferences at which the AUSPELL team gave talks

estimated the TV audience

at 1,300,000.

Sample clippings are

enclosed under separate cover.

Reports from

WH stations and the

HAVE debriefing of the AMSPELL team

lead us to conclude that the

tour was a moderate success that could have been much better if

if had been better organized and if the AUSPELL team had had more

experience.

(On balance we believe the tour was well worth the

$12,000.00 KUBARK paid out.

He do not, however,

be repeated in the foreseeable future in view

of the relative inexperience shown by the AMSPELL team on the

recent tour and the many difficulties encountered in trying to

organize the exhibit in the various cities.

2. COLOUBIA.

The AMSPELL team arrived in Bosata on 12 Februars

1964. but were unable to make contact with the local ASPELL/ANBARB

until the next day.

They were unble to get adequate advance

the local reaction to

the tour, wirch it juased to be in loreations

The AMSPELL team freely admitted

to WAVE that the Bogota operation was

something less than successful, but blamed the lack of advance prepara-

tions and the existence

of an unfriendly press for their failure.

should also be noted that the AMSPELL team was not on

the best of terms

with some of the local Cubans, and this fact probably had a good deal

to do with the poor showing.

b.

Hedellin.

The showing in Medellin was better than in

Bogota.

The press was lukewarm but the director of the Caracol radio

station gave them considerable publicity, and they were ablo to hold

the exhibit in a central spot in the city.

About 100 persons visited

the exhibit over a period

of three days,,

and 850 persons attended con-

ferences gives by the team.

Tho team recoived good advance press play in Call,

• which was perhaps one reason for the fact that the local Communist parts

also well prepared for their arrival.

On the very first morning

of the exhibit, a large crowd of Communists tried to enter the exhibit

and when they were

no a to no come ten ato the exhibit hall.

The incident provided considerable publicity for AuSPELL,

as reported

in BOGO 4332.

A total of 100 persons attended the exhibit.

The AMSPELL

that the Communists

were very strong in Call and that nor

ing there was like swimming upstream.

3.

ECUADOR.

The team arrived in Quito on 25 March, after spend-

in an unsuccessful

attempt to obtain visas for Peru.

QUIT 5867 reported the AMSPELL tean's personality clashes with the

local AMBARBs and the consequent poor performance by the AMSPELL team,

who complained of the absence oi police protection,

adequate facilities

for the exhibit, etc.,

and departed just two days later on the 27th.

One member remained

in Bogota to hold contorences,

attendod by 325.

While not accepting the blame for this fiasco, the AspeLL

team generally corroborated the above story in their debriefing by wAVE.

After such incidents as l'eported in QUIT 5867, we are reluctant to

recommend ans future tours.

Guayaaull.

The ANSPELl, team considered Guayaquil their

most successful operation, an opinion seconded by Guayaquil base who

termed it. a "resourding success."

total of 1,200 persons visited the exhibit, and the team spoke before

40 members of a local group, Frente de Defensa Nacional.

1. Santiago, Chile.

The AISPELL team arrived

in Santiago on 5 March to coincide

with the opening of the Latin American Youth Congress (LAYC).

Santiago operation was a complete loss because Chilear customs authori-

would not release the exhibit during the congress and the AMSPELL

team was unable to obtain space of any kind to hold conferences due to

competition from the congress for space.

The end result

was that the AMSPElL team did nothing.. An amatcurish plan to kidnap a

Cuban delegate. to the LiC as hostage for political prisoners in Cuba

was quickly scotched by the Station.

(See SAGO 6595).

5. La Paz, Bolivia.

The AMSPELL team arrived in La Paz on 17 March, and after somé

difficulty in obtaining space were finally able to open

the exhibit

in Club La Paz on 21 Märch.

As noted in LAPA 5550; exhibits and con-

ferences voro. hold in rarious incations in tlio city, with the closing

performance on 25 March at the Scala Theator hosted

by the Venozuelan

ambassador.

The exhibit received excellent covcrage in all four of the

leading La

Paz newspapers and the three largest radio stations carried

ANSPELL conferences.

Despite the excellent publicity,

a total of only

600 persons visited

the exhibit in La Paz.

According

to AlSPELL, this

was due to Bolivian

preoccupation with such things as a national day'

to

demand a passago to the sca for Bolivia which stopped all traffic and

communication.

6. Argentina.

Buenos. Aires.

Tho AMSPELL team arrived in Buenos Aires on

27. March during Holj reek..

In addition to the delay caused by Holy Week

celebrations, the team had difficulty finding space for the oxhibit.

With the help of the Chamber of Commerce,

the. exhibit finally opened on

6 April in Chamber of Commerce offices on Lenndro Allem street.

An

estimated 1,200 persons visited the exhibit during a four day period,

and good publicity was also obtained in the La Prensa and La Razon

newspapers.
