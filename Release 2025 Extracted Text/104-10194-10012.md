No: Noore is a very

mission very well and provided excellent operational services and

support.

They have

not been tested

in our emigre program because

of a lack of potential but 1 am confident thej will do the job

well as required. I rate Mr. Moore superior in his ability to.

represent CId and the Intelligence Community on the outside and

he does a very good job in representing DED within CIA and the

In a pinch I feel that I could depend on Mr. Moore

I concur in this evaluation. My principal interaction with Jim Moore during che

year has been the result of our mutual concern for the well-being of a capable officer

who performs well and has growth potential but who is difficult to work wich and has,

on occasions, apparently been on the brink of a physical breakdown

brought on by

tension, overwork

and. other factors.

In his approach to this problem, Jim has been

concernied, compassionate, responsible, and thoroughly professional.

Under Jim's direction, the Dallas complex has achieved a high ranking among DCD

offices and is holding it.

While Jim Moore Is a

long-time DCD officer, he seems to have lost none of his

enthusiasm and drive.

He is a valued and respected colleague.

MENURANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT.

SUBJECT: MOORE, J. Waltori

1.

J1m Moore continued in his assignment as Chief of the

DCD Field Office in Dallas during the period under review, with

responsibility for the supervision of Resident Offices in Houston,

New Orleans and Tulsa, and a new Residency in Austin. His letter

of Instruction dated 7 November 1973 remains current.

2.

The Dallas Field difice with its four satellite offices

represents the most complicated field office structure in DCD.

While Mr. Moore's staff consists of only nine officers and seven

secretaries, more than hall are located outside the field office.

The Dallas Office requires a chief who is experienced in resident

office operations, is able to notivate and banage people "from a

distance, and who can keep personally familiar with a wide varlety

of actlvitles. Mr. Moore is admirably qualified.

He has been able

to. cuordinate these essentially independent activitles most

efficiently.

His entire organization perforas in a responsive

and highly effective manner and produces timely, well balanced

reporting.

Although Mr. Moore's staff was relatively stable during

1974, two

of his key officers vere incapacitated for extended periods,

both at times when the work load was especially heavy.

procedures which he has established enabled the office involved to

continue to handle prioritj matters effectively in each instance.

On at least two occasions in 1974 Mr. Moore had to Intercede

and difficult situations, and in each instance his

judgment and highly professional approach resulted in successful

solutions.

SUBJECT: MOORE, J. Walton

Mr. Moore is a calm, mature, respected and popular

"officer who handles his compllented job with the easy assurance

that comes only frow experience and past success.

I belleve that

is largely due to Mr. Moore's personal reputation that so many

of our jundor officers want to work in Dallas.

6.

During 1974 Mr. Moore recommended the establishment of a

one-man residency in Austin as a more efficient way to handle our

responsibilities in that part of Texas.

We agreed, and the Residency

was established in mid-1974.

Although it has been in operation only

a few months, the wisdom of Mr. Moore's recommendation 1s already

apparent, and 1 am.confident that the success of the Residency will

continue.

Section C

James lalton Moore is hereby nominated for a

Career Intelligence Medal in recognition of his

contributions to the missions of the Federal Bureau of

Investigation, the Office of Strategic Services, the

Strategic Services Unit and the Contral Intelligence Agency

for nore than 37 years.

J: Walzon (Jim) Moore spent most of his boyhood (1920-27,

1950-jö) in Shantung Province, China with his missionary

Following graduation from lardin-Simmons University

Jim joined the FBl

and served as a Syccial Agent in

both chicago and

San Francisco.

During the latter assign-

ment he reported on pro-Communist clements in Chinatown

directed a US Government panel to interview aliens and US

citizens returning home to

ensure that chemy agents were not

slipping into the US as refugees or foreign businessmen.

Jim joined OSS in November 1941 and was commissioned

as an

assignment ids in Kunning

where he recruited and trained Chinese

agenti to infiltrate

Japanese lines.

While in Kunming he took parichute training

and on fugust 17, 1945 jumped into the Japancse

internment

camp at reihsein.

Following evacuation of refugees he

•becana Chief of Mission in Tsingtao.

Returning to the US

in December 1946,

he was reassigned as Vice Consul and

in Dairen.

Soviet intransigence prevented

his reaching Dairen so he

remained in Tsingtao for an

additional year until transferred as Chief of Station in

Calcurta, arriving there in April, 1948.

Jim returned to the United States in October 1949 and

joined the Contact Division,

Office of Operations, ClA.

CD/00 policy favored continuity and Jim was no exception.

Fron 1589 to 1954 he served in the Houston Field Office

fros 1951-1978 as the Resident Officer in Dallas.

Contact Division evolved into

the Domestic Contact Service

and a reallocation of resources raised the Dallas Resident

Oifice to Field Office status.

Jim was the obvious choice

for the job.

After nine months truining and preparation

lashingion (where he performed admirahly) he was assigned

as Chief of the now office

with responsibility also for

Resident Offices in Tulsa, Houston, New Orleans and, even-

tually, dustin.

CONFIDENTIAL

Section C (continued)

Jim's work in Dallas has

been: consistently excellent.

Under his leadership

the Dallas complet

has provided timely

forcign intelligence in response to worldwide priorities

and requirements

is an example, in April 1975 the Acting

•Director,

Stratetic Rescarch conmended Jim for "outstanding

performance". for urgent

special efforts to obtain infornation

which resulted in s

reduction of over 500,000 in the

Intelligence Community's estimate of the total number of

Soviet military personnel.

Similarly,

the Dallas Office has provided excellent

support to the Clandestine Service.

In orenber,

1976 the

Chief,

FR Division commended Jim and his staff for "outstanding

support" from October 1975-October 1976 in efforts which

were "indispensable" to the establishment of FR assets in

Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana and in identifjing and

assessing prospective targets for recruitment.

There are very few persons afpotchtial consequence. to

the Intelligence Community in Texas who Jim Moore does not

know and little that he cannot accomplish there on behalf

of Community and gency requesters.

The assassination of President Kennedy in Dallas in

November 1963,

the subsequent allegations

against ClA and

Jim Moore's iong association with Agency interests and

programs in

Texas have nade him a repeated target for media

attention and

scurrilous innuendo.

Although

under various

forms of

severe external pressurc

as a result, Jim

Noore

never lost his caln,

cool demeanor and has been absolutely

dependable in adversity.

An experienced professional, a true gentleman, a delight-

ful person

and an

example to be

emulated, Jin Moore has

been a real credit

to the intelligence profession.

As he

approaches retirement, he richly deserres recognition in the

form

of the Career Intelligence Nedal.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Domestic Collection Divisioni

DDO

SUBJECT

: Appreciation for Outstanding DCD

Performance

1.

I want to express the appreciation of the

Office of Strategic Research for the speciol cffort

recently made for us by J. Walton Moorc of your Dallas

field office.

Mr. Moore responded quickly to our

urgent request to obtain information on soviet military

medical services from DS-2172 and

provided it to us on

very short notice.

.. 2.

The subject

issue

personnel emerged

as an important

in a recent community-wide effort to reassess

total Soviet military manpower.

The community reassess-

ment was stimulated by DIA reporting of several months

ago that existing estimates of total Soviet military

manpower were low by almost one million men.

If correct,

the DIA appraisal had potentially serious implications

for the ongoing MBFR negotiations as well as a host

intelligence judgments about the dimensions of the

Soviet military threat.

3.

During the ensuing interagency review of the

individual estinates contributed by various agencies

in the Washington area, we came to the conclusion that

the number of Soviet medical manpower estimated by an

Army intelligence group was much too high.

A rapid

search of headquarters' files turned up barely enough :

intelligence to prepare an estimate of a portion oi the

medical services, but no direct evidence on total

medical manponci.

At this point it became cicar to us

that an improved estimate might be made with information

from. DS-2172.

As we had to present our case to the

manpower study Stecring Group

carly in the weck of

March 24, spced in contacting the sovice source was

essential.

Manial n

The data submitted by the Dallas field office

as a resült of a specially arranged debriefing pro-

vided. us with the basis for a much improved estimate

of Soviet military medical staffing.

Furthermore, Me.

"Moore's questions clicited sone new information of value

to future nork. Most important, the results of DCD's

efförts contributed significantly to convincing the

working group that the original Army estimate

too high.. Eventually the estimite we submitted based

upon the information supplied by DS-2172 was accepted

by the manpower Steering Group and resulted in a

Icduction of over 500,000 men in the intelligence

community's estimate of the total number of Sovict

military personnel.

The efforts of your people struck a mighty

for good intelligence.

Many thanks.

It 1s not only a forsonal satisfaction to do business
