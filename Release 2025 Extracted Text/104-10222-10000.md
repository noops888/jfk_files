During the year, political shifts in Peru and Bolivia have served

to dramatize the danger of too extensive a reliance on liaison and MI. Broe

has moved to reduce the profile of our declared presence.

The high morale in his Division comes from the widespread

knowledge that good performance is recognized and that career advance-

On policy matters, his judgment and advio is sought, and relied

1. This is a letter fitness report on Mr. Broe as Chief of

the: WH Divislon from July 1965 to dato.

Mr. Broc's filo is roples wich the highead estimated ot

hia capabilitier aud performance in the several positions of rospon

sibility he has hold in the Clandestine Services. Until coming to the

WH Division, his entire career with the Glandestine Services, dating

back to 1948, had been in the Far East area. He aerved as Chief of

our Manila Station and later of our Tokyo Station in which latter

position he distinguished himself. He was brought in to take over

the Wil Division when the Chief of that Division berare the DD/P.

That in itself'was an eloquent admission of the esteem in which his

capabilities are held. His performance in the WH Division has fully

lived up to thia evaluation. He took over the Division just after the

Agency had become immersed in the Dominican Republic crisis. At

the same time, a dozen other problems of one kind of another required

the most serioua attention. He has made several field trips to his

area of responsibility and has shown his usual skill in getting the most

SUBJECT: BROE, Willam V. (1 April 1964 - 31 March 1965)

1, Mr. Broc's performance as Chief of Station, Tokyo during the

reporting perlod is best described as outstanding.

2. For over two ycars,. Mr. Brue has struggled with the problems

In Japan of reducing the size of the Agency's mission and of developing

appropriate arcas of clandestine concentration. During, the past ycar, he

has effectively gotten the whole mechanism to work, with a marked increase

In foreign intelligence and an unprecedented emergence of the Station,

through contacts he and his associats have developed, as a channel for

political action. Through his skillful assistance to and culilvation of the

Ambassador, Mr. Broe has placed CLA in a position. In Japan where thc. Station

Chief and the Agency are accopted by the top levels of the japanese Government

as a useful channel and as a dependable organization for collaboration. This

high level connection is of tremendous value in asvancing pollical intelligence

objectives as well as an essential tool for indircet and unofficlal manipulation

of situations of key Interest to both the Jupaneso and the U.S. governments.

3. In the management of the Station, Mr. Bine continues to be his old

effective self. He is able to get a good deal of mileage out of the personnel

ussigned to him and to increase their effectiveness through his own personal

Ieadership. In all this, he has displayed an excellent sense of cost consciousness

in the inanagement of the Station.

Subject is Deputy Chief of the Far East Division and

under my predecessor. He also served as my deputy 1n 1954-

1955 at the China Base at Yokoguka, Japan, I have, therefore,

had ample opportunity to appraise subject's performance under

a great variety of circumstances, both in the field and at Head-

Subject is an outstanding manager in the Clandestine

grasps and retains complex details and produces sound ánd

intolligent soluiions to operutional problems. He is very strong

in adatiústration and do particularly clops at pecconnel sanage-

He has a deep and encyclopedic knowledge of the people

in the Far East Division; his approach is personal and sympa-

thetic but his hand is firm when armness is required. He has

been particularly successil in solving personnel assignment

problems by matching capabilities to requirements.

In his present job as Deputy Chief of an area division,

I do not believe that subject has an equal. This would entitle

him, in my opinion, to a rating of "y"

subject is so well qualified to meet the requirements of appled chied a large

arca division that there may well be a tendency to lose sight of his abdig to run an

organization of his own.

This capability was amply demonstrated when he was chief

of the China Branch of FE Divalon.

Subject is unusually strong us a supervisor. His Dair for warm dur iupartial

relationships with subordinates hus enabled him to develop a first-hand understanding

of the capabilities, shortcomings and probloms of a very large proportion ur all FE

personnel. His direction of personnel does not lack firmness but is expressed in such

a way that feelings are considered and best results are achieved.

Subject's operational judgment la entirely reliable. He has an encrelopedic know-

ledge and understanding of the Division's operations and a full grasp of pulitical

implications throughout the area.

I have noted no weaknesses in Subject, which would inhiblt his sucressful
