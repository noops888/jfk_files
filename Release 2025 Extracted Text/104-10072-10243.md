Goytia talked on the phone to president Ovando on 20 April.

Ovando said that there was pressure from the civilian members

of the cabinet on the Debray case.

They related their request

that Debray should be released

to a letter Ovando wrote the.

Italian novelist Alberto Moravia which they claimed stated

he would release Debray.

to Sanjines that

The civilians

think that the release of Debray and Bustos would take the

pressure off the government.

5.

I asked

some clarifying questions on the OAS report

of a possible demonstration against the OAS Assembly in Santo

Domingo in June 1970.

He said that Rolz-Bennett normally

maintains contact with the OAS Deputy Secretary General

Urquia, who is a close personal friend and is also a Central-

American.

The head of

the UNDP office in Santo Domingo is

Hugo Navegas.

He has

been asked to get the information on

the possibility of such a disruption.

6.

Victor Paz Estenssoro, is one of three experts picked

up under an OAS contract with the University of Engineering

in Lima. In actuality, Paz will receive a P-4 salary from

the OAS. The project is up for board approval and will last

at least a year:

7.

WUSLAB/I/went on at length on the difficulties between

Miss Alexander, the former Bolivian ambassador to the As whose

parents were murdered in La Paz,

and Sanjines. In brief, Miss

Alexander was accompanied to Washington by a catholic priest

Father Eduardo.

Sanjines offered to find him lodging in a

Washington monastery, but he demurred.

Whenever Sanjines

called Miss Alexander during crises in Bolivia at early morning

hours the father would answer the phone.

He also helped with

Miss Alexander's work at the OAS and was around the Embassy

office.

Sanjines once found them doing some research in his

Colonel Banzer, when assigned to Washington, said

that there was an intelligence report that Father Eduardo

had been involved with the guerrillas.

The military finally

forced the father to leave the Embassy. Miss Alexander sent

him $100 on which to live.

reappeared.. When Miss Alexander returned to La Paz she read

a Noxander

When her parents were killed he

a written report submitted by Sanjines on her affair with

the priest, and when she came back to Washington she called

up Sanjines. and told him off.

8.

Sanjines said that his relations with the State

Department have cooled off.

He thinks that the nationaliza-

tion of Gulf Oil has weakened the government.

There is a

vacuum in Bolivia and this has caused the present Bolivian

government to be much more subservient to the United States

than was

the government of Rene Barrientos.

He believes,

however, that his own position with the Bolivian government

had been strengthened. Sanjines is going to San Jose for

the presidential inauguration. He heard from Colonel Ayoroa

that Victor Paz Estenssoro as

a personal friend of Figures,

had also been invited to the inauguration. Sanjines said

that it would be interesting to talk to Paz.

I asked WUSLAB/Lif there were any recent develop-

ments between his assistant] and the Soviet Embassy. During
