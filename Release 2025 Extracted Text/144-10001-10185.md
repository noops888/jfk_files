SUBJECT:

Request by MI. Blakey for Access to Cuban

Communications During March and April of 1962

TO: LAO

THRU: V

1. In response to Mr. Blakey's request of access to all communications

between Cobo Cleaners of Detroit, Michigan and Cuba in March and April

of 1962 the G offices were asked

to examine all pertinent files to determine

whether or not copies of the requested communications existed. This

examination resulted in the following determinations:

a) In 1962 the only record copy storage media used by the G

offices were page print and microfilm.

b) Consistant with Agency regulations pertaining to records storage,

all materials, other than product, for 1962 were destroyed.

c) Therefore, no raw traffic data base exists which would include

private communications to or from Cuba for the period March/April of 1962.

2. Based on the foregoing, the information sought would exist, if at all,

at NSA only in the form of product based on the relevant communications.

product files

No

for the period involved exist within G Group.
