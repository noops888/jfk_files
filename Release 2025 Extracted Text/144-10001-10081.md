-

The Hungarian press, television, and radio reported fully the

assassination of President KENNEDY, attributing it to fascist elements

and inspired by racial hatred. Despite the fact that (1 gr G]

emphasizes the grief and distress of all. Hungary, none of the principal

government figures visited the United States Legation to present

personnel condolences and the text of the ll gr G] telegram sent by

President DOBI was not published.

Moreover, the Hungarian funeral

delegation, along with those from Romania and Czechoslovakia, was

of the lowest rank of the countries of this area, acting Foreign

Minister PETER MOD.

Finally while the government officials expressed restrained

grief, the people in general were deeply touched.
