Assassination Records Review Board

Final Determination Notification

AGENCY : HSCA

RECORD NUMBER : 180-10070-10162

RECORD SERIES : STAFF PAYROLL RECORDS

AGENCY FILE NUMBER

December 8, 1995

Status of Document:

Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 16

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors

including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United

States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 6

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could

reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of

privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

Dear Mr. Chairman:

I am requesting that you consider authorizing a

retroactive pay adjustment for a former deputy chief counsel

of the Select Committee on Assassinations, Mr. Robert K.

Tanenbaum.

Mr. Tanenbaum's employment with the Committee

was erroneously terminated at the close of business July 31--

three days prior to the date he actually left the Committee.

This administrative error was an oversight, which went unno-

ticed until after the August pay period when he notified the

Committee that he had not received a paycheck for August 1

through 3..

His annual rate. of pay was $36,000; therefore,

the amount I am requesting he be retroactively paid is $300.

Mr. Tanenbaum was a valuable employee, well thought

of by the Committee. I regret the error and am hopeful that

you will grant this request providing Mr. Tanenbaum the pay

he has earned. If there is anything further I can provide,

please do not hesitate to let me know. Your attention to

this matter is very much appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

LOUIS STOKES
