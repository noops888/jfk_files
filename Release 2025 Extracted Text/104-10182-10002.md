SHOELT

SUBJECT: AEASPIC

REPORT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL ENAMINATION

Dates of Examination:

S, 9, 10 January 1959

Subjecy was met in Pario on the above dates by the case otticer

and the examiner and was submitted toe preliminary

psychological

examination via a French interpreter.

Subject was born l2/Tuly 1918 in Georgia which, at this time,

was not yet part of the USSR,., The Subject classifies his parents as

Nobles and is of the opimon that their Stars bad a great induence

upon hie behavior and development particularly In the period which

followed the family'o fight from Georgia to France in 1921, In other

words, the Subject abides by the prejudicial class aturude of Noblesse

Oblige and feels an obligation of honorable and generous behavior

attributable to his birth rank.. He is also of the opinion that this concept

al nobility has evolved into a system of dignity and pride in his endeavors.

This concept is also extended to include te aritude: ""If you pretend to be

something, you have to act accordingly.".

The family fed Georgia before the Sovie: invasion. The Subject

feels thät he was too young to understand but recalls having revolted

against the flight because it was a humilitating defeat rather than a

tactical retreat.

He operates by the attitude that one must fight,

surpass or conquer rather than to submit or accept defeat. He is,

according to his own self-concept, a persos who can not tolerate being

beaten in competition.

As a child the Subject felt that he was much

stronger than several million men. He preserts the analogy that he

is like a man who wants to kill an elephant. All he needs provided for

him is a high powered rifle and then he would feel egual to the elephant.

The Subject admits of physical inferiority feelings by virtue of his size

and strength but he denies any feelings of ictellectual inferiority and

admits that he depends more upon his mental faculties than upon his

physical abilities. Apparently the Subject kas rever been able to

accept what he considers the original defea: and light from Georgia.

201-233477

## Page 40

In addition, his fatker later returned to Georgia because he wanted to

die in Georgia.

Although the Subject can appreciate his fathere point,

of view he is unable to forgive his father for tarthe admitted his defeat

by r

Firing to Georgie to die. Although the Subject does not regard

hin

self as a Georgian and is certainly not regarces as a nationalist.

rison was rosse

than all the others.

According to the Subject, the sense of defeatiogeter with the competitive

urge to balance the score to the primary lactor tais personality and

life experience, In addition to these. as was me-oned above. he is

highly self-confident and opumisue that le will sacceed despite the

hazards and odds. I would appear that these arandes are important

as regarde his motivation for affiliation, managene at and utilization

of his services.

Because the father had provided himself is certain monies the

family was able to live comfortably and even optie-ly upon its arrival

in France.

However, the vicissitudes of life braggat the farr.lly

progressively to financial difficulties and later to caterial degradation.

The Subject is of the opinion that this loss of econoric status had a

marked influence upon his way of thinking therease?. Whereas the

family had previously lived in an artificial, feudalistic way it was

not brought into more direct contact with realit; ast, although this

was not necessarily a bad influence, life was loug:.

The Subject's

early loss of economic status is important as regards his selection

for affiliation because it also constituted a loss a social status which i8

more primary in Subject's personality. A revier di the Subject's life

history reveals that he has always responded to maierial incentives in

his various schemes and ventures. Howevsr, is terms of his personality.

material success is a short-cut method of artainisg social status.

Consequently, it may be concluded that his drive for social status is

more basic than bis need for financial status.

From an early age the Subject was non disciplined and in the

school situation he constantly rebelled agains le autority of those

reachers whom he felt did not regard him as isselligent of pay him

sufficient individual attention. Because he felt his teachers were too

distant they were automatically unpleasant and apparent, his rebellious

behavior was his way of obtaining attention and getting closer to the

reachers he consistently refused to abide by the conformist attitude

of his peers and felt compelled to do those things not normally done by

other He engaged in Pracucal jokes and was generally regarded as

an activist in the school situation. As a result he was expelled from.

one abcool after another and accumulated a record of having attended 18

diderent schools It is also of interest that he never obtained a degree

from the institutions of higher education which he attended.

This early delinquent behavior in the school situauon is of

Interest to us because it reflects the Subject a motivational attitudes

which are present to date

As far as he in concerned, lug scholastic

experience, generally epeaking Depresents lustrationg the seeking

of a goal to puruse and his hope that his ideals would erystalize and

matertalize. The Subject is father abstract in this interpretation.

" yould seem that his ideal involves not only material but moral

comfort and security. However, he has always regarded society,

through his disappointments and mortifying experiences, as wicked and

selfish in its majority.

Consequently, he expressed his dissatisfaction

in the form of aggressive and anti-social behavior typical of the malcontent.

One might ask why this individual reacted to his life experience

in this manner:

He was apparently a precocious child who experienced

disillusionment both in his farily and in his society. At first he felt

this disillusionment was unique and peculiar to himself, but he soon

discovered that his discontent was also shared by others.

This

reinforced his combative attitude and he reflected this attitude in his

non-conforming behavior. It was as if he suddenly had discovered to

his great disappointment that there was no Santa Claus.

Another aspect of his system of ideals proceeds from his concept

of chivalry which he feels his parents inculcated. This is a sort of

Robin Hood concept by which the Subject visualizes himself as a hero

who rushes to the rescue of the weak and oppressed. This concept is

somewhat afantastic and has misguided his behavior in various situations

throughout his life. For example, the school situation, he would typically

assume blame for the wrong-doings of others. Later in life he responded

to the plight of others for the conscious reason of wanting to help them.

The Subject feels that many people need help and thät he has always wanted

to help others in order to help himsell. In other words, he da

mouvated to help others in order to obtain love and affection.

His

need for love and affection is probably one of his most basic needs

and this need is expressed in all of his interpresonal contacte.

The Subjectle mother reacted to his neurouc behavior with

over affecuonate solicitousness. Although she wasn't actually able

to determine the reasons for his internal distreas she was aware that

something was taking place within him and finally took him to a psychiatrist

because of his behavior probleme. However, she didn't feel able to advise

bam of what she was doing and took him to the paychiatrist on a subterfuge.

in addition, because the Subject disagreed with the psychiatrist's

conclusions, he did not benefit by this experience. This would indicate

that in handling the Subject it would be wise not to approach him.

covertly or as if he were a problem but to permit him to maintain his

posture that he is right and that society is wrong. The mother was a

marked conformist who insisted that the Subject should abide by the

social order.

To be successful, the Subject's handlers should avoid

trying to make him conform in his attitudes toward society by well-

meaning gestures or contrivances.

The Subject continually deceived and disappointed his mother

because each time she stärted him in a new school he made promises

that he would behave but each time he managed to be expelled becauce

of his behavior.

The Subject is consciously.convinced that his mother

acted in his good interest and not for her satisfaction of wanting a

perfect child. However, it is the opinion of this examiner, that the

mother's over-solicitousness was compensatory for her basic rejection

of the Subject. It is not likely that she did things for him but that she

did things to and with him for herself. In other words, she wanted the

Subject to be perfect so that he could be worthy of her love. This may

also have been her attitude toward her husband. The Subjec: did not

behave perfectl), did not merit her love and consequently appears to

be continually seeking the love and affection of other persons. However,

the Subject carnot accept this opinion as regards his mother and denies

thai she acted in her own interest.

One of his principal defenses. is

denial - simply assuming the attitude that such and such is not true

when he probably believes it is true.

complicated person,

however, I am not difficult to understand.

The Subject reflects disappointment in his father as a personal

ideal.

He regards his father as an independent person who was kind

but profoundly selfish. Nevertheless, the father would give the shirt

off his back.

The father was fond of children, loved the whole family

and was happy when he saw others happy. However, the Subject is

disappointed in his father in that his father never succeeded. He feels

that if his father had succeeded none of the things that happened in his

life would have come to pass. He feels that his mother's suicide is a

direct consequence of his father's failure to succeed.

When the father returned to Georgia the Subject was driven to

dispair over the dissolution of the family: The Subject was the baby

of the family and the death of his mother and the departure of his

father and sister were a threat to his emotional security. He tried to

restrain his father by threatening him that because of a French law

requiring foreigners to paj taxes before leaving the country, the father

ran the risk of being arrested. When the Subject told his sister this,

she became angry and replied that the father was mature enough to act

as well as possible. The Subject's attempt to prevent his father from

learing was conflictual for him because, although he didn't want his

father to leave, he also did not want to nterfere with his father's desire.

This experience taught the Subject that when his father made a decision

he would carry it through at any cost.

As it happened, the result was

the disintegration of the family. However, this incident is of interest

## Page 44

to the Subject's handlers because he indicates that he will abide by

firm authoritative decisions even though he objects to them.

Whoreas the Subject was attached to his mother, his sister was

identified with his father.

The sister followed her father to Georgia

out of a spirit of affection and sacrifice because she felt that her father

needed her. The Subject regarde hus sister as a tributary of his fathere

mistakes.

The sister taught languages in school and at the lime of Stalin

the Chaldren would says "We have done thie and that thanks to Stalia!".

She would reply "You are individuals and you have done this of that

without Statin!"

As a result she was arrested and sent to a concentration

camp but with the change of regimes she obtained her freedom and

returned to her job. Ie would appear that the sister le an individuallet

like the Subject.

The sister's husband had emigrated to France at a much later

date and apparently could not adapt himsell and regretted having lett

Russia.:

He returned to Russia and the Subject believes that because

he had served in the German Army he was sent to a concentration camp

in Russia. Subject regards the intellectual level of his brother-in-law

as that of his sister.

The brother-in-law also had an inferiority complex and

this may have been an additional reason why the Subject had rejected him

as a brother-in-law.

The Subject's brother, who is an architect in Gap, appears to

be an Independent person who is conservative and more conforming than

the Subject.

The Subject does not regard his brother as having distinguished

himself in extraordinary fashion. It is of interest that the Subject may be

jealous of his brother and states that his brother has been more successful

but in his own sphere and in terms of his own standards.

It is of interest

also that the Subject's philosophy is not to accept the fact that he has been

unsuccessful but to try to explain his lack of success by the process of

introspection and self-analysis.

This emphasis and orientation as regards

obtaining a greater knowledge of himself is typically a neurotic and

represents his need to love himself and to rationalize his failures.

The Subject feels that his brother is jealous of him whereas it is likely

that both are jealous of each other. It is also likely that the Subject.

and his brother were rivals for the mother's affection. For example.

the Subject feels both he and his brother loved the same type of women.

---

## Page 45

The Subject was more expressive of his affection toward his mother

whereas his brother was more timid, shy and independent. When the

brother saw the Subject getting his mother'e attention he tried to replace

the Subject.

When the brother learned that the Subject was seeing a girl

whom he knew too he advised the girl to leave the Subject alone. This

sibling rivalry may continue to date. However, the fraternal relationship

is likely to be more complex. It may be that the brother regards the

Subject as "Peck's-Bad Boy" of the baick sheep of the family and is

interested in fostering the Subject as regards opportunities for

accomplishment or success.

For some reason:.or.other this exariner

has the feeling that the brother may have been indirectly instrumental

in the spotting of the Subject. The Subject tends to steer away irom a

discussion of his brother and chiefly presents the data that this brother

is kind, somewhat vain and that he is fond of his brother. By a

comparative analysis of the Subject and his relationship to his brother

it is apparent that the Subject has a very strong desire to succeed

and to accomplishe He was also influenced by others in this regard.

For example, at a certain

ame minis childhood the Subject Lived near

some former Georgian resistance who had fought against the Sovietsys

-The Subject regarded these

persons as uneducated but admirable.and

affectionate, He feels that he certainly must have been influenced by

their exciting

stories of their many exploits.

"He feels" he must also

have been impressed by their patriotism.

The Subject is a sentimental

person and he was exalted and deeply impressed by the warm and

enthralling manner in which they expressed themselves. He feels that

this particular association may have contributed to his passion which

he always puts into the exccution of whatever he undertakes.

The Subject claims that he has learned from his personal

experiences in life rather than from school or from the experiences

of others. He feels that he has educated himself in the school of life

and has derived little from formal education or from the experiences

of others. For example, he claims that his mother's oplnion had

importance for him only at the time she rendered her opinions. As

far as he was concerned they did not have a lasting influence. This

item is important as far as the Subject's reaction to future traning. is

concerned. It is likely that he would be impatient to proceed with the

task in actuality rather than to learn about performing a task through

the experiences of others.

---

## Page 46

The Subject feels that throughout his school experience, perhaps

only one or two teachers really understood him. Me regarded the others

as apparently idiotic of worthless.

These particular teachers taught

him that it was often necessary in life "to swallow a great deal of useless

"stuff"' so that thereafter, certain essentials could be more easily

digésted." This is another helpful hint as regards the trainers who

may be assigned to the Subject:

Subject feels that, apart from his academic progress at school,

he learned that it was necessary to communicate, to express himself,

to understand and explain. He feels that these are necessary skills in

society and he relies quite heavily upon his verbal intelligence. It is

likely that he would relate well with a person who exhibited superior

Wadom and expressive ability.

It is also likely that he would relate

poorly to an Inarticulate person of lower intelligence.

The Subject was also influenced in his montal development-by

wished to be a hero himself.

- The Subfect also remembers certain

outstanding men.of history from whom he learned a certain order

was necessary for the good of the people. However, it developed

that the Subject was disillusioned in these men and his ideals were

shaken when he later learned to his dismay that they could commit

abject or monstrous acts. Related to these experiences, is the fact

that the Subject puts no stock in emblems of signs of rank or reputation.

He regards such signs as identifying labels only and is not impressed.

The fact that he tends to be a skeptic or a cynic should be important n

to his handlers.

As a foreigner in France the Subject was liable to mobilization

into the French Army at the beginning of World War I.

However, he

felt the authorities took an awful long time to make a decision in connection

with him and because of this he joined the French Foreign

reign Legion and

left immediately for North Africa feeling that at last he was becoming

a member of a famous unit and at the same time fulfilling his obligations

towards the French military service. This is an example of his impulsivity,

sentimentalism and need for prestige.

However, it was not long before

he became dissatisfied and expressed his discontent in opinions that

---

## Page 47

France was an incoherent mess.

He bitterly regretted that he had

become acquainted with people who obviously did not know what they

wanted. The Subject feels that his experience in the Foreign Legion

did not have any great influence on his character except that it

mobilized.a profound dislike for irresolute persons.. This point

was dealt with before. However, it is worthwhile to repeat that the

Subject is an impatient fellow who desires immediate action as regarde

with promptly he develops critical opinions and complaints. As

regards

his affiliation, it is important to note that he has no real alternative at

this time and is therefote required to accept nermal procedures.

Although he may regard these procedures as a waste of time he will

accept them because he lacke control at thie point in his processing

The Subject married for the principal reason of creating a family

and a home. Even though he understands the values of the principles?

Involved, principles which were inculcated by his father he now feels

that it was a ridiculous mistake to marry justifor the sakeof principles,

without the necessary sentiments. He rationalizes that, at that time,

he was merely abiding by the precepts of his father without thinking of

the possible consequences. However, he soon discovered that creating

a family did not represent anything at all except "aggravating the

incoherence and the division of society". In other words, for the

Subject, marriage meant building a wall around himself.

He also

found that, instead of finding a partner who complemented him, all he

obtained from the partership was a reflection of himself. (In selecting

a partner for this Subject it would be wise to consider this aspect.)

The Subject feels that so-called spiritual intimacy is a fallacy. He

is:of the opinion that women are necessary for sexual purposes but he

faile to understand why it is necessary to "build a separate world"

with them. It would appear, in terms of the Subject's anti-social

attitudes, that he had hoped to create his own world through marriage,

but found that this was an illusion.. He does not assume the responsibilities

for this attempt. •

The Subject does not regard his marriage as a complete fiasco.

He feels that both he and his wife were fairly nice and that they got along

fairly well with one another but did not live very comfortably. Furthermore,,

he did not feel that there was any evolution in the marriage. He admits to

his debit that he married because he wanted to experience what it meant

to have children. Actually, however, he did nöt want children as

individuals in themselves but he assumed that the marriage would

produce a child whom he exactly imagined and which would be a

reproduction of birself.

'However, the first child turned out to bea

female and this may have shaken the Subject. The Subject voluntarily

submits that he has learned the difference between the male and the

female:

This would seem to be a peculiar statement but it has a good

deal of meaning for him, particularly as regards his relationship with

his mother, sister, wife and first child. He regards women as alogical

and as being determined by a psycho-feminine education. He developed

this attitude originally as a defense against his mother's conforming

tendencies and it is probable that he crystalized the attitude when his

wife rejected him after he had attacked the bank and was arrested,

His wife had a second child while the Subject was in jail and the Subject

knows nothing about either of his children.

(Thie is enough to rip us off that the Subject should not be

exposed to females Who would be important in his handling.)

During World War the

Subject became involved in black

marketeering and.th.the faise documents business.and claimed to have

created a gang which he led and to have traveled throughout Central.

Europe. He also claims that the primary purpose of the gang was to

repatriate or. liberate war prisoners and that technically speaking, the

black market business was a worthless branch, the only purpose of

which was to solve financial problems. However, he admits, that it

is true that the black market business reached such a magnitude that

a person that was interested only in making money could have found it

a quite satisfying and sufficient activity in itself.

As was mentioned above the primary purpose of the gang, according

to the Subject was to liberate prisoners. He was successful in releasing

13 French prisoners from Germany He claims nots have done this for

patriotic motives but for humanitarian reasons•

He helped the prisoners

because they needed help and because he felt it was the right thing to do.

He was paid for this but claims

to have given his money to help the r

prisoners. He helped the French prisoners despite the fact that he

had sympathy for the Germans. He claims that his sympathy for the

Germans was based on the fact that some Georgians had relatives in

Germany and he hoped that the Germans would defeat the Russians. If

the prisoners had been Germans he would have done the same thing.

Even though he admired and sympatized with the Germans he claims

he would not have harmed France.

All this is rather comples.

However,

it is possible to understand his motivations according to his basic principle

which involves a vague desire to hels others who need it. He also

expresses pride in doing the outstanding and the difficult. The material

reward is not an ultimate end in itself. His emotionalized ideals are

not expressed clearly in terms of politics of nationality.

This comples

oi motivations will also be discussed in terms of the Subject's participation

in the bank robbery:

Although the Subject was satisfied, on the whole, with the

technical efficiency of his gang and although he was pleased with the

freedom of movement and his apparent security, he was arrested because

of carelessneas.or a slip, not in the actual functioning of the gang; but

rather on the part of one of the men whom the gang was helping.

Consequently the Subject was arrested by the Gestapo. Because he

was considered by the Germans to be a very important prey be played

along and led the Germans to believe that he was more, important than?

they had figured He hoped that such a tactica

would bring him certain advantages. Although he realized at he could

have been shot for only half what he had done and that it may havebeen

disadvantageous. for him to exaggerate his-part-he claims-to have done

so in order to mix the tracks,

to coafuse the German authorites and tovi

avoid "fingering" certain partners whom he made appear as negligible

in the scheme.

He played this game as long as he could but his end

gradually drew near.

However.

he is an imaginative fellow and he

hit upon the idea of claiming that he had invented a very interesting motor

that would run without gas. The Germans, of course, could have

profitably used such a machine at this point in the war and consequently

took his offer into consideration and postponed his execution.

As a result

he bought time and shortly thereafter was liberated by the Americans.

Through this experience the Subject has learned that it is very important

to know the weaknesses of authorities and to play these weaknesses against

one another.

His emotions correspond to a joy of being the: sole master

of the situation. He feels that if he were to find himsell in this sort of

ra'situation-again that he would actin, exaculy the same wayne

This

behavior is typical of that of a con man.

He has the capacity to control

of his personality and consequently should be noted by his handlers.

However, it would appear to the examiner that there is nore to this

story than meets the eye. One would Suspect that, since he obtained

mild treatment at the hands of the Gestapo. he probably collaborated

more than he is willing to admit at this time. It may be that he did

not fool the Gestapo at all. It is quite possible that the Gestapo used

him to pass on the authenticiry of documents of other prisoners or in

some other nefarious acuivity. If this can be established as true by.

other techniques then we are dealing with a person who places self-

preservation above all else.

The Subject also has a history of criminal activity in France

after the war.

At that time he was married and was the father of one

child. He was working at a model-maker's shop and although he was

not well off be was earning a decent living. According to the Subject

a close young glend solicited his assistance in snacking a bank in order.

to finance an intended marriages At firet the Subject felt that the

other fellow was crazy to dare to attack a bank.

He also claims to

have hades twinge of conscience and asked himself the question, Is

tright to

do harm by robbing a bank?" Furthermore, he never felt

that a team of two partners would be able to attack a bank successfully?

Apparently the other fellow was a fairly good recruiter... He reminded

the Subject of his war activities and he was of the opinion that since

• the Subject had been able to accomplish certain illegal activities in

the past that he would be quite capable of attacking a bank.. He also

displayed a confidence in the Subject's capability to invent a plan of

attack and played on the Subject's love of risk, of his need for friendship.

At each point in the developments the Subject tried to withdraw by

saying.""I my mother learned of this, she would die." He postponed..

the job indefinitely. However, in the meantime his mother died and his

friend felt that he no longer had an excuse.

The Subject compromised

by agreeing to knock over a jewelry store. Apparently they knocked over

two jewelry stores for the sake of good measure. However, after having

spent his money, the friend again returned with a proposition to attack

the bank.

The Subject told him: "You got your money for jour marriage;

now leave me alone." However, the friend had not married his intended,

was broke, and was interested in financing another marriage.

They

agreed that this would be the last job. Afterwards, however, the other

felow apparently threw his money around and was arrested and squcaled.

The Subject claims that after he casually learned of his friend's arrest.

himself for such a consequence and he implies a conflict às regards.

leaving France. In any event, he was captured and imprisoned. The

question arises in this examiner's mind as to why the Subject either

panicked or was awkward in his flight, if he did have a chance to flee.

It may have been that he unconsciously wished to be caught and to be

punished in order to relieve his guilt. He was ambivalent about

attacking the bank. I this is true, then important congideration

should be given to the Subject's personality as regards plans for the

eventuality of his being captured in the course of the project.

Subject feels that he failed badly when he was arrested both

by the Germans and by the French. He feels that these two incidents were

a consequence of poor selection of friends and poor planning. " he were

quite a blow to his ego. However; his ego didn't collapse. There have

been times in his life when he felt the entire world seemd to conspire against

him and when everything seemed destroyed. He has always felt that there

are ways to get out of a mess, principally by exerting his ego. He

continues to believe that, unless a man is so weak, both physically and

morally, it is always.possible.for him to get back on his feet of at

least to hope that this is possible. Consequently, the Subject continues

to believe that there is always a possibility to fight and to conquer.

This optimism may be motivational in his present desire to affiliate

with: us.

In the two projects which involved liderating French prisoners

and attacking

the bank, Subject Claims that he was betrayed-by another. i

However, he felt his betrayal was unimportant and consequently was not

angry at these persons. Because he feels that there are certain moral

values which he holds dearly, namely friendship, these persons lost

his esteem but he was more in contempt of himself for having miscalculated.

Although his mistakes have seriously reduced his circumstances of life,

regardless of their size and consequences, he does not feel that they have

discouraged him about future possibilities. "If there is a future, there is

hope!" The Subject feels that he has never completely lost self-control

and that he has always been a master of his actions at all times and

that these actions could have been changed by his own vólition. This attitude

reveals his tremendous narcissistic investment in his own powers. As

far as this project is concerned, it would be unwise so rely upon the

Subject's judgements and it would be more prudent to plan every detail

for him and require him to abide by directions. He is an imaginative

executor but he is a very poor planner according to the testimony of

his record. His actions are often impulsive and unreasonedi

d. Material reward: As was mentioned before, material

reward appears to be a means to social status.

In the case

of the bank robbery the friend obtained three-fourths of the

take and the Subject was content not to spend his money

freely in order not to arouse his wife's suspicions.

Competition with authority. Apparently the Subject

regarded the Paris bank as a symbol of authority and was

motivated to compete with what this symbol represented.

It may be that he did not actually wish to defeat the authority

but that he wanted to obtain the atrention of authority.as he

did in the school situation. He certainly accomplished this:

The authorities are still paying attention to him. In fact they

There is an indeterminancy in the examiner's mind as to whether

the Subject is a leader or ä follower. He claims to have been a leader

of the gang during World War Il but in a careful analysis his relationship

with his bank partner it would appear that the other person was the leader.

The Subject;

in this instance, was more of an "idea man" and executor

whereas the other chap was the instigator. There is no question that the

Subject regards himself as a leader. Howerer an inspection of the record

indicates that he is a poor leader because he is impulsive, rash and tends

to ail.

Furthermore, he is like the cat in the Walt Disney film who:

while chasing the mouse and having his entire attention directed to

run over by a truck. His first reaction to being splattered by the truck

is one of disappointment as regards not having arrived at the goal, be.

However, he does

reaching the goal. In addition to his lack of attention to necessary

details the Subject is also as was stated above.

Consequently it is no surprise that he has failed repeatedlythroughouts

his life.

In regards to the above, another incident of this man's life is

relevant.

His left index fingertip and thumb tip are missing. He claims

to have lost these in an explosion which occurred in Germany when he

was involved in the repatriation deal. According to him, after the

bombing of Berlin, he picked up among the ruins an unexploded bomb

of British origin and took it home to salvage the explosive which he

might have used in various ways.

While he was removing the detonator

which was probably stuck in its receptasle, it exploded in his hands.

The explosion occurred oo quickly that there was no inmediale pain

but those around him became panicky. He remained cold-blooded and

gave the order to remove all things which were there because the

his hands away from certain things.

This bomt incident may be indicative

of the things which were discussed in the preceeding paragiapns. Tieic

may be more to the bomb incident than the Subject offers but this could

not be established by the clinical method.

Subject feels that a critic would say of him that the majority of

his undertakings have brought results which were considerably less

than hoped for. Consequently, he feels that a critic would regard him

either an optimist or a joker of else that his views on the possibilities

of accomplishing are not very sound.

In his own defense the Subject feels that he has made many

mistakes in his life but however big these mistakes were, he does

not feel that they have basically influenced his character. He feels

that his character basically involves the desire to become a worth-

while individual even at the cost of behaving wrongly. He feels that i

the only criteria for judging a man are his achievements, that he may

be regarded as a failure.

He emphasizes that the value of an achievement

does not consist in its spectacular magnitude or in its multiplicity.

exampler he feels that is not necessary to mass produce

machine for an object in order to fully underetand to function.

real

es that, commercially, speaking: is more rational to mages

produce the item but this repetition does not interest him.-

m.- In his

opinion, the creative idea and the prototype have a much greater am:

value and importance than the establishment of a factory which would

popularize the prototype.. To illustrate this attitude further, the

Subject is of the opinion that one single thought from a great figure

is more valuable than millions of books which are published annually.

This attitude,

of course, may be interpreted as the defensive orientation

of a romantic idealist who has not achieved in practical affairs. However,

there is more to this. In the Subject's value system, it is more important

20-act intelligently..sensibly.and efficiently. For example, I he were

asked to open a window he feels that it would be up to him to decide

as regardo the appropriale method. He likes to carry out an intellectual

effort which results in efficiency. Consequently, he may be regarded

more as an "idea man" than an implementer.

Ot additional interest

to his future handlere is hla desire to independently figure out the way

thas something should be done.

This tendency Is likely to appear in his

training and preparation. I would be well to keep this in mind. The

Subject feels that he has a tremendous vitality which, in the pass, has

expressed itself through false altempts such as the bank robbery etc.

He feels that he is not being used properly and that there is a power

within himself, a crentive urge for movement ard realization which

is highly emotionally charged and which permits him to feel that he

is capable of doing, much more than he has in the past.

"However, this

energy will have to be rationally harnessed il it is to be productive.

Another aspect in regard to the above is that one of the Subject's

chief motivea is curiosity.

He continually seeks the unknown. However,

when he approaches the unknown he experiences emotional insecurity and

is ambivalent about proceeding or withdrawing.

Tris may have been a

factor which influenced his unsuccessful escape through the Pyrenees.

The Súbject has a fear about which he doesn't know or understand and

Is afraid of getting himself into something which he cannot get himself

out of. Hie immediate acuon is 80 withdraw without solving the problem.

Consequenty, it would appear that the Subject needs the direction.of

superior intelligence in order to help him evaluate the realities of a

situation or predicament. He needs firm suppors, guidance, and

direction as regards the cnsideration of all possible eventualities

and alternanses As was said befores itimust be keptin mind that his

urge for set preservation is stronger than hid desire to solve probleme

or to carry through on a venture. On the other hande the Subject claima

a che always thes his wardest to heep hid promises. Thus rehe

agrees to do something he will attempt to carry it through despite..

the dangers involved. He may be rash in this regard but feels his

rashness is due to the fact that he thinks quickly and is able to rapidly

apprehend and synthesize the components. and essence of a problem

in its various perspectives.. In other words, he is alert and quick

and gets the point immediately even before you finish your sentence.

However, it would be wise not to interpret his intellectual alacrity as

a commitment or as an index that he will complete a task.

It means

merely that he

sets your point; it doesn't moan that he will cooperate.

especially when the going sets rough.

Another factor of interest to the project is that this person is

not likely to change as regards his basic character euce He has

marked difficulty Projecting-himself.in terme of what he would like

to be. It is his opinion thai in order to change himself, it would be s

necessary that he would become an entirely different person.

However, he fecis thas everything is relative and perhaps he should

show more strength of character, be litule more compromising.

more realistic and less sentimental. However, according to him,

this would imply that the environment would be such that there was

no room for sentiment.

In this case, his personality would be

-1.8-

## Page 57

definitely out of place. Consequently, the Subject does not think he will

be a very different person in the future from what he is now. However.

he hopes that his material situation will have improved not necessarily

financially, but socially. He also naively hopes that the world will

change and that there will be no discrimination and that there will

be a general improvement of living conditions for everyone. He is a

humanitarian in his outlook but he is not an activistic social reformer,

except in the sense that be is an individualistic rebel. Generally he

strives to improve his own standard of living and he feels that his

own inclination to better thinge ie the disease of all inventore.. The

Subject also hopes to acquire, it necessary, a nationality by virtue of

which he could feel that te actually belongs to a society. However

he is ambivalent in thie resard. He regarde society as being anxious

to stamp and label individuals and he would prefer to be an individualist

outside of society than to be a member of society il he is required to

reform), is so distant and so difficult that he wou

lives in order to attain it. It might be unfair to designate him as a

a cynic. Consequently, one should be careful as regards inculcating

ideological or social motives. One should be content to accept his

motives in their present state.

Tampering with them would only result

in diaturbing the Subject and the relationship.

The Subject denies that-he-has any-emotional-interest.in.or

emotional attachment to France at this ume. Although it was likely

that he was sentimentally patriotic before the war it is a fact that he

nas been branded as a criminal and has been deprived of certain civil

rights and privilegendle now perhaps feels rejected and in turn

Nsve theless he strikes the examiner as a

certainly not a Russian in his personality. He expresses himself

freely, is discursive, voluble, and is able to carry on a conversation

intensely and indefinitely on his topics of interest. This is typically

French, but, in terme of his personality, it represents an oral

characteristic." In other words he is inclined to express himself

orally and is motivatey iu obtain love and alfection together with

other supplies by oral incorporation.

What this means to you is that

- 19-

## Page 58

he is "mouthy" and he will eat you up if you are not careful or if you

get too close. Incorporation is the epitomy of contröl. Consequently,

if you allow him to incorporate you he's got control, not you. Be wary,

and detached in this regard. He has already eaten up the case officer.

The Subject is currently involved in his avocation of inventions

and is the owner and exploiter of several patents.

He has engaged the

financial and technical interests of several others in his inventions.

He currently presents the problem of being divided between the

invention business and continuing in the preliminary phases with us:

He claims that if he were to join us he would have to relinquish every

thing to his business partners. This is probably true, and it is also

probably true that he would relinquish his invention interest but at the

same time, he presents this item in the fashion of a.con man. It would

be wise to ignore this gambit.

Additional descripton of the personality includes the fact that

regarde

the intelleetual aspects of training However, in his training,

other things will have to be kept in mind, He is an narcissisdo tons

character who feels that because he lacks the love.of others he needs

to love himself. In other words, he is quite in love with himself

and thereby acts accordingly: He also tends to rationalize and to

öffer socially acceptable reasons for his individualistic behavior

and for his past failures. He acts because he thinks he is right

and because he will succeed. He is quite egotistical in this regard.

He strives chiefly for emotional satisfaction.

It would be wise to

"remember also that he appears to be-altruistic-but.at the.same-time.

he is selfish. He will do things for others and for the community

but will hope to get something out of it for himself. The alirustic and

selfish drives merge and he is motivated by both at the same time.

He needs to prove to others that he is capable of success and he is

self-confident in his power but is impecure that others

him as adequate.

Basically he is an exhibitionist, but is too sophisticated

to brag or to display himself in a transparent manner. However, he

reeds attention and is likely io do things in arder to get attention. This

is what he has done in the past. He particularly strives not to be regarded

as bad o evil.

He wants to be regarded as a person who has differences of

## Page 59

opinions and conflicts with the social order. It wouid be fair to say that

he is not a true criminal but is more of a neurotic character who

expresses his conflicts and difficulties by non-conforming beharior. He

is a stubborn fellow who does not like to be defeated and strives to

conquer. .

Despite his tendencies to magical thinking he strives to be

rational and realistic, but his strong emotional pressures get in his

way.

He experiences melancholy and depressive mood swings but

maintains a light side and attempts to relieve his dysphoric feelings

with lightness and humot. He relies heavily on the technique o

humor to relieve tension and to avoid the demobilization of anxiety

in interpersonal relationship. His humor may be regarded as a

good index of his andety.

In light of the above the Subject's motivation for affiliation at

this time is rather complex. However, on the surface it is positive,

without the sufficient establishment of controls and the application of

selection techniques he may prove to be a difficult handling problem in

the future. It is recommended that his processing be slowed down to

a hault and that security and other operational requirements be satisfied

prior to lifting him out of Gap: Once he is taken out of Gap he, like the

con man, is on first base, and, no matter how you slice it, he will have

established himself in a bargaining position.

The Subject likes Americans for sentimental reascns.

Although

he realizes that the United States may have selfish political interests

he is willing to go along out of admiration for the sincerity of the

Americans. He likes the liberty which exists in America and the

fact that-people are treated like individuals rather than as numbers.

General ly his attitude toward the Americans is typically emotional

and is understandable in terms of whät has been said about his

personality.

Although the Subject is a rank individualist and a non-conformist

he tealizes that he must cope with the community and must sacrifice

for the good of the community.

others.

In this regaid it is unlikely that the Subject has even

conmitted physical

assault nor is it likely that he would in the

tuture.. No matter what the other person would represent to the

Subject he would still be regarded as a human being whom the

Subject would respect and would not harm. The Subject is not

necessarily a hostile person.

He will act out of exigency but will

deliberately avoid being sadistic or wontonly cruel. Thists of

importance as far as the project is concerned. If the Subject were to

find himself in a light spot which required killing another person it

i' not likely that he would do so. It'is more likely that he would attempt

to resolve the situation by verbal machi nations:

The Subject prefers to work alone as regards technical research

but as regards the execution of an operation, he prefers to be part of

an orgamzation. He knows he can rely upon himself when he is alone

and that otherS have been unreliable in the past. However if it ias

necessary for him to work with others he will accept tell must boff

kept in mind, howeverke

that he would prefer to work alone.

to express his loyalty he would like to prove his usefulness to the

superior but, at the same time, he would feel inadequate in that be

would require the protection of a superior. In his initial contacts with

a partner, the Subject would attempt to assume leadership on the team

but if the partner were superior by virtue of intelligence and /or experience,'

the Subject would tend to follow. It is likely that he would be a better

follower of an adequate leader than a leader of a less adequate person:

The reason for

this is that he is more of a dependent than an independent

person in terms of his interpersonal relationships.

Telationship.

Prior to the last session of the preliminary examination on the

10th of January 1959 the Subject was routinely contacted by the French

Police who were investigating his reasons for being in Paris at that time:

As a result of this contact, the Subject was markedly apprehensive and

preoccupied and was not able to freely devore himself to the psychological

analysis as theretofore.. The Subject's primary motive is, of course,

self-preservation and since he is an extremely alert and vigilant

individual be is likely to over-reaci and to become emotionally upset

## Page 61

with such a provocation. Because of this it appears that the Subject

needs the guiding influence of a more mature experienced person who

is in more control of the situation.

An additional point of interest is

that the Subject is capable of using such an experience as the visit by

the police as a dévice to control. For cample, because of the visit

by the police, the Subject aborted the psychological analysis.

He did

the same thing, in another way, on the preceeding contact with the

case officer

It's as if the Subject does not want us to get too close

and to leard too much about him. The third aspect of this behavior is

that the Subject for some reason of other consciously or unconsciously feels

he has farrived" and is acceptable to our service. In other words, he

may act according to the opinion that a decision has been made in his

favor and consequently be sees no need for enduring a psychological

analysis. Lip likely that he would have the same attitude toward a

security inter cogation and as regardo traininge

As regards the general selection orleria for the project it

would appear that the Subject sausties the requirements of intelligence,

"Pesourcefulness, mechanical talent, team ability pilliration exfiltration

capability, good health, physical stamina, motivation,

etc. "However, mrs

there are other factors which may or may not vitiate the positive features.

These factors are pertinent to areas such as security and handling. It is

recommended that before the Subject is removed from Gap that he be

administered a security examination in a controlled situation.

Such

an examination should be conducted by a skilled and experienced

individual who is fluent in French, who is unbiased and objective and

who is not overly rigid as regards his conventional standards. With

such an examiner, there is a fifty-fifty chance that the Subject would

satisfy security standards. The other problem area which remains is

that of handling, and unless this is thought out carefully and appropriate

personnel assigned, the hand will be quicker than the eye.

He also discussed future contact and la-

structed him to have a full medical exaiination done, Including a

cbest x-ray, and sent to us as scon as convenient. Likeulse Subject

his habits.

If there is anything particularly deirgian about subjoot,

it Is not noticeable: We would gusss that subject was brought up In

not too well-to-do midule class circusstances but under the lafluence

of his parento who had bud a nuch better, possible even prospepaus,

past.

4. Character and personality:

. It 1g-safe to describe Subjeot-ao

Independent und as a man who Instinctively prefers to take his chances

relyins on his own abilities and resources ln order to avoid com

provising his independence by assuming camitrents. He Is a long wolf

type. We guess that subject behaves this way partly because he has an

exaggerated notic of his corpetence, and partly because he is in

pattent with delay and with people who are leas quick or able than he.

Even though subject needs peoble and likes compary, he dogs not want

to have his affairs, particularly his bualness affairs, dependent on

otsers.. There are sevoral pointa wnich support this:

By bis os

adatesion (itich, Incidentally, may be quite misicading because he may

havo quite Incorreat opinion of himsalf) subject. as a student was ob

utreperous, impatient; and consistently so. As a voluntury dorker 1n

Germany when he sees to havo struck out on his on is further evidence.

Now, rather than taking a steedy joh of sone kind which sults bis

abilitles, subject in coco again striking out on his oin, althougo his

record as a conviot nitigates this becsuse ho has no choice.

One of

ine reasons noy Subjeot oes this la that he has an Insatiablo destro

to striko 1t rich or at least to achleva success and statura.

This

desire to attain soothing may be rolated to the comparison he suet

be forced to make botween his record and that of his brother: His hag

his brother became in officer in the French may (even though he was

forelgn born) and is now a so-so succesaful archilest.. Also, te sua-

pect that ua have not yet gotten the full story on subject's marriage

and divoroe.: Perhaps Subject märried unwisely, lost face wita hig

fanily, and/or was considered a los typo nate by his wife's fanily even

before he tas arrested.

One of the underlying reasons why subjout is so independent

18 that he is impactent.

In conversation no noticed that ho did not

vialt for questions we wished to put to him to be fully ronaca. He

tends to interrupt in order to supply usually interesting und sonatices

18 811b-dod be can talk. Le doubt ke is a slaie to preccasepticas.

Because his coral etandards ano neither sell defined aou are einsure,

his reasoning and behaviour is not constricted by then. He is a pres-

astist through and throng:

He 13 also a realist.

he thousic subject's

on positich; posalbilities for the future, his past,

etc., were disandingly aucurate and candtd.

Honever, Subject 1s 40

years old and we doubt that he could be sade to change tils rays, at

least not for very long. be think he mould nork hard at leaming agy

ner job just so long as be round it laterasting, adventurous, and/or

estorally renarding. He has turned his hind to a lot of things and

saced at being obliged to erpericent and acapt. himself to new

situaticos in order to avoid troublo, disconfort, and vers.

6. Willingneas and potivation;

Concerning a dropsax aission and/or

a repatriation atasion under our direction, me think subjeot la sincere

and correct in olalming he is a willing candidate. he doust that he

would attept to beg off at the last conest. He is no phystoal cord.

However Subject Is willing for REDSOX beceuse in it he sees. a way out

of the bind ho ls now in. Re can't leave Prance because there is nowere

to 80. Becauso ho has a or minnl reoord ho is unable to butld a future

for himself in Prance, and he is unable to travel in order to look for

possibilities. He hus been exiled to a bick town thare be is paroled

to his brother who lo to soce extent responsible for his good benaviour.

So basically Subject 1s willing because it 1s a way out.

There Is an

element of adventuro in bis uillingnoss but any adventurous ideas sould

Innedlately evaporate if Subject wore a French Oitizen and had a

financially successful business.

subject is anti-Comaist, etc., ke

feel quite certain, but he is either too jaded; or too nature, ot too

cynical to peralt such notions to play much of a role.. If he wera given

the Idea that KUEAK demands fiery anti-Cormist motivation, subject

would do his best to convince us that that is what he 15. Subjeut in

so muny words sald that one of his prime desires was to get out ot

Prance, and as a first choica. to go to the United States.

The promise

of American citizenship would weigh in heavily as a faitor In Stibject's

willingness to undertuke almest any REDSOX sission regardless of the

danger. In a word, subject's motivation is material.

7. Handlinz of Subject:

The handling of Subject fron this point

au must be rutizless and calculated.

We thin's that sublect wouid be

neither shocked nor offended by such handling; as a mutter of. fest he

probably expects. it.: We would roccusend agsinst paying suoject sora

It Subject is removed fron Prance, soue neans must

be. found to convirce Subject that we can dispose of him to an area or

a place at least as

disadvantagcous to subject as his present coe is.

In other words, don't give suiject the carrot until be has done the job.

Subjeat would not necessarily reed to be trained in French as this is

the anly language in whlch he is perfectly fluent. Even though his

Georgian is very good; It is not current and be could be used cal on

It would sees to un that the

fast that sibject is on parole ought to saie little difference, as far

as his candiday for ReDSOX. is concerned. Surely a means con be devised

to recove hin fron Prenee so that he will neither be hunted by the French

zuthoritles not socome the object of suspicion sluply because ho has left.

He migot emigrate to gouin America, which he probably could help him

achieve.

He could move to North Africa and disappear fron thera.

Regarding possible surveillance by the other emigres we subalt that such

must be assured in every case, notwithstanding nst the Subject in

The presumed survellianco becores a problem when it

time to remove a candidate for training, nich calla for a smooth
