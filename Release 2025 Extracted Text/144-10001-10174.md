job of recruiting members of the then Rebel Army, among them the

traitor ALDO VERA((A)), MARIO MARRERO((A)), and AGUSTIN PARRADA ((A)) .

The latter, once his activities were discovered, found it propitious

to flee the country to avoid prosecution.

"Along this same line, he also used the aforementioned Miss

CARMEN JIMENEZ GOMEZ, instructing her to infiltrate student

organizations for the purpose of creating diversionism in the

ideological order, and she established, for this purpose, intimate

relations with Mr. PEDRO LUIS BOITELL (A)): ex-President of the
