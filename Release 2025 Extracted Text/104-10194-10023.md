MONTHS

UNDER MY SUPERVISION: 7

OVER-ALL RATING

:Strong

Ne. Hunt took on his present duties as EUR/CA In

July 1968.

Ills performance in this position has been con-

sistently Strong.

2.

From the period of his previous assignment to EUR's:

Special Activities

Staff, Mr. Hunt has made a substantial

contribution to the refinement and recasting of CA operational

concepts which has been underway in the Division since

the

termination over the past two years of many long established

projects.

He has a fine political sense and a sound grasp of

European renlities and evolutions.

While concerned with

the

role and methods of political action, his mind is essentially

operational, imaginative, and perhaps at its happiest in the

recognition of opportunities and tho stimulation of spocific

action in the field. In both these areas he has shown a power

of origtnal thought, persuasiveness in presenting his views,

and persistance and vigor in helping set action underway.

=.

There are three primary arons in which d'. Hunt has

played an important role in the Division's business.

first is in providing consistent staff assistance to Branches

and Stations in the

conduct of on-going CA action, and the

modification and relocation of certain activities of concern

to the sonine staff and other divisions.

He has brought to

this work a balanced view of Division and senior Staff equi-

ties, an excellent arreness of realities in the field and of

the practical limits imposed by the field priorities, manpower,

and

the requirements of sectrity.

Secondly, Ur. Hunt has carried with him

f.rom

S.1S

continuing participation in the work of that stats in

its

two spects:

the countering of soviet political action

and

a reawakened and redefined concern with Communist Party

operations.

Ho has contributed to the dofinition of these

intorests and worked. closely with the Binnches in Ideiti-

fying opportunitics.. Neither of these areas are of a nature

that has made :for prompt common

understanding beircen load-

quarte!'s

and the field.

Bir, Hunt's TDY's have vech'of

major assistance in furtherins.

this understanding

5.

Thirdly, Mr. Hunt has assumed a particularly 1m-

portant role in respondiny

to-requirements for memoranda,:

studies

and suggestions which the Division has been asked

to produce since the beginning of a new national Administra-

tion In January.

Intimately coupled with this is direct

support to the

Chief of the Division in the latter's par-

ticipation in the

Interdepartmental Group,

and the analyses

and studies which have derived fro

that participation.

6.

In all those duties, sir. Hunt's performance has

reflected sagacity, balance,

and imagination.

He has had,

tö his crodit, the idvantage of excellent give and take

with the Division's branches and a sound knowledge of branch

poople and capacitics.

He has drawn with equal effective-

ness upon a brond range of personal associations in other

divisions and senior staffs, and upon a deep experience of

the mechanics, nuances and occasional delicacies of getting

business done at llendquarters.

In summary, Sir. Hunt's has been the performance of

tough-minded senior professional in a

period which has somewhat changed the

nature of the CA

officer's duties

the Division.

REVIEWING OFFICER'S COMMENTS:

• Although I would not differ from the craluative

comment on this officer, I would be inclined to rate his

over-all pérformance as

highly PROFICIENT rather than

Strong, in view of his broad experience and ginde.

This

officer has had a series of personal and taxing

problems,

beyond his control,

wliich have tended to dull hig

cutting

edge just enough to be noticeable.

Sutject has performed in a manner quit Consistert with his long and broäd ex-

perience in many aspects of the craft of intelligence. His senior grade, his special

expertise in the field of propaganda and publication and his very high intellect

have contributed to the division's operations in the public media field a sharp

focus, an economica! concentration of money and effort and a consequently

heightened impact. In the WUHUSTLER project, Subject vindicated his faith in

a moribund clandestine asset by demonstrating, alter about a year and a half under

his personal direction, that it is one of the most effective activities of its kind.

Before Subject assumed direct responsibility for this project, it had suffered from

visionary and diffuse direction and from poor case officer-agent rapport. Subject's

personal handling of thie operation is marked by excellent rapport and the project

prospers on an entirely reoriented basis which the agent himself enthusiastically

welcomes.

Subject's supervisory responsibility has extended over two

secretaries, from one

to two professional staffers under official cover and three professional career

employees under unofficial cover.

The fairness and precision of his management

has patently von their respect and inspired their performance.

Mr. Hunt took on his present duttes as EUR/CA In

July 1968.

Ills performance in this

position has been con-

sistently

Strong.

2.

From the period of his previous assignment to EUR'S

Special Activities Staff, Mr. Hunt has made a substantial

contribution to the refinement and recasting of cA operational

concepts which has been underway in the Division since

termination over the past to years of many lone established

projects.

Europenn

He has a fine political sense and a sound grasp of

realitles and evolutions.

While concerned with the

role and methods of political action, his mind is essentially

operational, Imaginative. and perhaps at its happlest in the

recognition of opportunities and the stimulation of specific

action in the field.

In both these areas he has shown a power

of original thought, persuasiveness in

presenting his views,

and persistance and vigor

in helping get action underway.

three primary areas in which dr. Hunt has

played an important role

the Division's business.

first is in providing consistent staff assistance to Branches

In the conduet of on going CA action, and the

modification and relocation of certain activities

to the Sentor Staff and

other divisions.

He has brought to

this work a balanced view of Division and Senior Staff equi-

awnreness of realities in

the field and of

the practical limits

imposed by the tield priorities, manpower,

the requirements of security.

" secondly, in Thint has carried with him from SAS

a continuing participation

in the work of that seaff in its

two aspects:

the counteriny of Soviet politieal action and

a reawakened and redefined concern with Communist Party.

operations:

He has contributed tu the definition of these

Interests and worked closely with the Branches in identi-

tying

opportunities.

Neither of these

areas are of a nature

that has made for prompt common understanding between Head-

quarters

and the flold.

Mr.

Hunt's TDY's have been of

major assistance in furthering this understanding.

Thirdly, Mr. Hunt has assumed a particularly 1m-

portant role in responding to requirements for memoranda,

studies and suggestions which the Division has been asked

to produce since the beginning of a new national Administra-

tion in January.

Intimately coupled with this is direct

support to the Chief of the Division in the latter's par-

ticipation in the Interdepartmental Group, and the analyses

and studies which have derived irom that participation.

6.

In all these duttes, Mr. Hunt's performance has

reflected

sagacity, balance,

and imagiration.

He has had,

to his credit.

the

advantage of excellent give and take

with the Division's branches

and a sound knowledge of branch

people and capacities.

He has drawn with equal effective-

ness upon a broad range of personal associations in other

divisions and sentor

staffs, and

upon a deep

experience

of

the mechanics, nuances

and occasional delicacies of getting

business done at Headquarters.

7.

In summary,

Mr. Hunt's has been the performance.of

a very competent,

tough-minded senior professional in a

period which has

somewhat changed

nature of the CA

officer's duties within the Division.

DSFICLAFPE SONNEL

Mr. Hunt is an officer with real ability, creative and mahagerial. During

the perlod under review, he has done a great deal to tighten up the operation of

hia shop,

The amorphous aspects of some projecta he inberited have been.

eliminated or cut down to size. He has a pleasant and engaging personality

and a broadly based background.

Il there are any areas of weakness in his performance it is only because

his potential is so considerable.

For example, it is possible that the staff and

planning aspects of bis job could receive more attention although, admittedly,

there is a large grey area between the responsibilities of the CA Stalf and the

responsibilities of DODS in this respect.

MEVORINDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

Mi. E. Howard

Hunt

On 21 June 1972 Mr. Robert Tegitholl, INR, Department of

State, informed MI. James Franklin, Chief, .CCS/OCB, that che

Department of State had received press inquirtes in regard to Mr.

E. Howard Hurt's gervice with the Department of State. INR had

arranged for wichholding any Department of State replley untll CIA

had been consulted. Mr. Hurt's cover record showed that he was la

Integrated Department of State statua la Mexico from 1950 urt ll 1953

and In Montevideo from 1957 until 1960. He also had nominal domestic

Department of State cover from 1966 urtil he retired la 1970. Upon

rötiremert, Mr. Hunt was " opened up" as a CIA employee back to

EOD in November 1949,

2.

In the absence of both Mesgr3. Osborn, Director of Security,

and Geisa, Deputy Director, I discussed the State Department request

with Mr. Leo Dund; Acting Deputy Director of Security for Personnel

Security. He concluded that everything considered, the Department

should say that Mr. Hunt way assigacd to the Department while in

Integrated status but, when pressed, not deay his bagle CLA status.

Walle trying to clear this liue with the ADDP, Mr. Celss called and

at the end of our discussion, cautioned that any guidance to the

Department of State In regard to Mr. Hurt should be cleared vith the

DCI.

3. I then talked to Mr. Sam Halpero, EA/DDP, to determine

the hereabouts of Mr. Weyer. He recommended that l rais to both

lies9r3. Meyer and Colby who were in the OPYB think tani.

As I vas leaving my office, Mr. Tegethott called Vis.

Franklin a sechod time to say that la the eventng of 20 juse 1972,

Pilt. Jeha Klos, Department of State'a Press Office, and Mi. John

Urumb of CLA had discussed press logutrtes in regard to Mr. Hume

hich ivere made to the Department of State la tbe afterioon of

20 Jano 1972. Tocee Inquiries had particular reference to Nt. Hunt's

¿ograpay La WHO'S WHO AMERIC, showing bim as Departmes of

State employee since 1968 and listing his olfice at tbe Department of

State. Mesgrs. Umub and King igreed the press should be laformed

char he nas not on the Stace Department's payroll during the period.

Mr. Uaunb confirised this arrangement when I called him and sald

tcat he had added that Mr. Hurt retlred in good standlug from CLA

ia April 1970,I also cleared the proposed guldance with Mr. Ted

Shackley, Chiel, iH Division.

I then saw Mesars. Colby and Meyer, outlined the Departmere

of State's request and our proposed reply that Mr. Hurx, durlag his

Integrated service in Mexico add Montevideo, was assigied to the

Department of State. This luormation would not be volunteered by the

Department of State, and Mr. Hunt's basic status as a ClA employee

would sot be denled ll raised by members of the press. Messre: Colby

ax Meyer agreed that rais was the only feasible line ro take. I then

23 kod Mr. Cölby whether additional clearance from the DCI was required.

He replied that it was sot, and that he would brief the Dat.

Attachment to Fitness Report of Howard Hunt 31 March 63 - 31 March 64

Section C (Continued)

Special mention should be made of Subject's objectivily and integrity in

carrying out his responsibilities. These were best demonstrared when

he promptly and swiftly terminated a large and effective radio broadcast-

ing project, to establish which he and his subordinates had labored hard,

immediately upon belated discovery that insuperable, practical obstacles

precluded realization of the project's theoretical potential.

Subject'a professional background has attuned his constant attention to

FI operational opportunities arising in the courge of his current CA

activities, a practice consistent with his habit of seeking maximum benefit

for every dollar apent in time, effort or cash.
