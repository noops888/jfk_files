SUBJECT: Asscisment of Career Agent, Jeremy K. BENADUM

1.

Escudonym and salary: Jeredy K. BENADUM, C5-15, $14,055.

Vivision or Staff and city: Wi Division, Mexico Clty.

Operational duties:

Subject mintains unofficial lialoon

between the Statton and a Mexican Ministry, He also develops

independent agents.

4.

Cover:

Subject has. Inmigrante-Rentista statue which allows

him to remain in Mexico indefinitely and the only restriction on

his activity 1s that he cannot be gainfully employed.

In view of

the fact he is a wealthy wan in his obn right and will soon be of

age to collect retirement from his long service with the FBI, this

cover presents no problems.

After fire years in this status

he will

obtain inmigrado status which will give him complete freedom of

operation, with all the rights as a Mexican citizen, except that

of voting.

The cover is excellent because it is secure, allows him

complete mobility,

and require no administrative support.

There are

no existing or anticipated problems related thereto.

5.

Divinion's asgessment: Subject is an experienced, well-

trained, serlous intelligence officer, capable of spocting,

asgess-

ing, recrulting and handling agents.

Most of

his experience and

capability in In the field of collection of Fl intelligence and

operational support, the latter being his must outstanding area of

contribution to Station objectives.

He would

also be capable of

running CI operations. His knowledge of CA type work, however,

cannot be assessed at Headquarters.

Subject's cover is a natural one and poses no difficulties.

Since Subject has been in the intelligence field for over 20 years,

he 1s psychologically prepared for his dual role lu intelligence

operations and is woll qualified to operate without strong Station

support.

Headquarters is not in a position to coument on the timell-

ness or quality

of his operational reperting, but no defects

regard have been noted nor have

any been brought to the attention

of Headquarters by the Station,

Subject needs no training.

sum payment.

2. Shortly before the COS left Headquarters for Mexico, a meeting

was held during which the Branch Chief discussed contract personnel of

the Station.

Ref was discussed and it was the COS's desire for there to

be an amicable separation at the time of BENADUM's retirement. Il,

therefore, the extra two months would accomplish this, then the added

costs would be worthwhile.

ment Office and are predicated on a retirement date of 31 December 1970.

Reference: HMMT-10052

1. Reference asked Headquarters guldance In determining

possible adjustment in the Quarters Allovince for Jeremy K.

BENADUM, Career Agent. Reference stated:

--BENADUM purchased his local residence 1 December

1964 for $50, 200 and cust of utilities average $98 monthly.

--Although the current maximum Quarters Allowance

for BENADUM is $1, 700 per annum, the Station has been paying

at the rate of $4, 128. 86 per annum.

-- Reference forwarded a list of BENADUM'o estimates

of utlutles costs and a LNPURE memo on personally owned quarters.

2. The formula described in Para 3 of the LNPURE memo

has been used in prior cases and la that which is also used by the

Allowance Committee.

Based on this fortula, 10% of $50, 200

(original purchase price) plus $1, 176 (yearly uttutles), total 36, 196.

The amount granted BENADUM would presumably be the maximum

unless the Station had determind a lesser rate was applicable due

to cover or operational reasons.

3. Using the elfoclive date (5 October 1969) of the current

Quarters Allowance rate $4, 700 ($1, 100 plus $600 for dependents)

minus the rate belug paid, 51, 120. 20, Espresents an Increase of

$511.01 per year or $47.58 per month inacatio.

Section 21 (5) the Initial purchase price as

shown by the doed.

and (8) should show

annual rates

authorized by Section 132.5 of

Regulations (Government Civilians, Forcign

Arcas). These are the only items of cost to be considered.

When the quarters allowance system provided for reimbursement

for quarters costs within a predetermined maximum,

the regulations

provided that tho allowance for personally owned

quarters

should

not exceed do percent of the purchase price,

converted to dollars

it the exchango rate available at the time of purchase, plus allow-

able utilities.

The 10 percent of purchase price was amplo to

take carc of taxes,

depreciation; ropairs, interest on investment,

and amortization of the costs within'a reasonable period of time

by U: s.

Only light, fuel, and water could be added

in arriving at the allowance.

Under the current quarters allowance system,

the flat rate will be pald unless the authorizing officer belleres

it necessary to reduce the payment under Section 131.2 or the

Standardized Regulations.

quarters would be treated the same as any other

ho cannot roccive advance payment of quarters allowances under

Section 113 of the Standardiced Regulations).

unnecessary a special rate for personally owned quarters.

requirement to report the purchase price on SF-1190 is to pro-

vide- the authorizing officer additional intormation to be considerid,

together with any other pertinent local circumstances, in declding

whether reduction of the

allowance is necessary and, if so,

how

Only the utilities costs are

to be considered in addition

to the purchase price except in those rare instances where land

Icht is involved.

Because of varying conditions between posts

and individuals,

not considered advisable

to

certain percentage of the purchase price that should be considered.

In addition to the

Information on the SF-1190, the authorizing

officer should consider local circunstances, which vary greatly

from post to post, in deciding whether the occupant of personally
