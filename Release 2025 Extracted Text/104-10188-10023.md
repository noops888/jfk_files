HMMN-15952; 27 November 1967

Headquarters' confusion regarding the varlous LISIPTY

properties 1s understandable, although each change in location

was duly reported as it occurred, and at various times project

renewal requests, progress reports, and other corrospondence has

pinpointed the locations of the base houges involved.

The con-

fusion undoubtedly stems from the unfortunate fact that LIMITED

and LILYRIC in eftect exchanged approximate locations in 1966

without changing cryptonins.

Up to this point, LIMITED had been

was

he could buy the building).

for various operational reasous it

was decided to put the LILYRIC personnel into the new building,

instead of the LIMITED crew.

LIMITED was therefore noved into the

building which LILYRIC had occupied.

At this point, of course,

new ciyptonyms should probably have been assigned in order to

avoid the. confusion which has evidently developed.

(This vas not,

however, simply a switch of personnel - eaci: base house retained

LIVOUSINE purchase of the old LIMITED building generated consid-

as LICAlLA is concerned, its locatlon ans status was never open

to question, and Its Incation in the LIniST complex 1s regularly

The Station under-

stands that a meno describing the locations of the variour base

houses was attached to tlie most recent LIkESA project ronewal

request when it was submitted to the staits by wh/l.

Personnel within the base houses is also well-documented

(most of the LIENTY progress reports have identifled each agent

in each house),: and the parsonnel have never been switched from

house to house.

the best rundorn of these persönnel is

Raymond H. GERENDE's security review, Pornarded with HMMA-31164,

largely because finances with LIMOUSINE are handled on a' semt-

The reimbursement, therefore, often comes many

months after the payment.

The station neglected to cancel taxI-ll, which, should

be done as it refers to LILYRIC in its old location, before the

LILYRIC 1S nOw MEXI-132, and is in the building

Rent payments are

being used to help liquidate LIMOUSINE's debt, and, as instructed

in HW!S-4914, 15 June 1966, the Station is crediting this money

to miscellaneous receipts.

There can be, therefore,

no question

of the need to include money for LILYRIC

LILYRIC rent 18, and has been since the

3,000 pesos per, month,

which amounts to $?, 880 per year ($3,200 has heen requested in

Headquarters is correct in stating

that the agreed-upon figure for the rent in this new building

was 2,300 pesos fer month.

irdicate that the

reason for the increase land this apparently was not reported

to Headquarters) was that the bank which holds the major part

of LIMOUSINd's loan had determined that 3,000 pesos was à lair

price for the apartment.

The Station had, of course, no choice

but to go along with this.

The presence of so many new desk personnel at

headquarters - people who arc unfaniliar with station

history - means

that we must turn to you with queationg

oftener than you might wish.

Our present question

concerns property involved in LIBAPTY.

(We are submitting

the project as received fron the fleld, but do not

understand the background very vell.)

?.

ELMA- 11257 of 16 January 1959,

a project renewal, said

that

"approximately one year ago the LICALLA base wag

purchased by KUBARK through: LIMOUSINE", and we have not found

any cables or dispatches which would show a change in that

status.

Does MEXI 03 LIMUST/LIMESA (see Real Property Report

of August 1967) Include LICALLA? If SO, Und i1 we Own

LICALLA, why does it cost us $1800 a year for rent and

utilities?

(Up until the subaission dated 1963 the project

reneral used to say "LIMITED and LICALLA rents are returned.

to station by LIMOUSINS and credited to station miscellaneous

receipts" but after that time this sentence vs eliulnated.)
