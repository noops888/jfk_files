Assassination Records Review Board Request for Additional Information and
Records No. CIA-9 (Publications and analytical materials)
Dear John:
We would once again appreciate your assistance in obtaining access to CIA records of
possible pertinence to the John F. Kennedy assassination. We request that you locate
CIA or Intelligence Community serial publications for the dates immediately before and
after the assassination (November 20-30, 1963), including such publications as the
President's Daily Brief, the President's Checklist, or any serial publications related
specifically to Cuba or the Soviet Union. In addition to intelligence reports, we also
request that a search be undertaken for any analytical materials bearing upon the
assassination.
As with our previous requests, we would be pleased to discuss with you ways in which
we might better refine this request.
Thank you for your assistance.
Sincerely,
lione

Re: The Central Intelligence Agency's Compliance with the JFK Assassination
Records Collection Act, 44 U.S.C. § 2107
Dear Mr. Deutch:
Since 1994, the Assassination Records Review Board ("Review Board") has been
working with a number of Federal agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency,
to locate and publicly release records related to the assassination of President Kennedy.
These actions have been taken pursuant to The President John F. Kennedy
Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V 1994) ("JFK
Act"). We have been working with Mr. John Pereira, Chief, Historical Review Group
and Mr. Barry Harrelson, Senior Review Officer, Historical Review Group of CIA and
have appreciated the cooperation we have received.
The purpose of this letter is to request your agency's cooperation in assisting the
Review Board in discharging its responsibility of assuring Congress and the American
people that the goals of the JFK Act have been accomplished to the greatest reasonable
extent. We want to assure the American people that the United States Government has
identified, located, and released all records relating to the assassination of President
Kennedy. Indeed, one of the paramount purposes of the JFK Act is to certify to the
public that the United States Government is not withholding relevant materials related
to the assassination. See, e.g., Assassination Materials Disclosure Act, H. R. Rep. No. 102-
625, Part 1, 102d Cong. 2d Sess. (1992) ("The Federal Government's failure to release
official materials has contributed to numerous conspiracy theories and fueled charges of
government complicity in the assassination...a salutary purpose is served in opening
these files [relating to the JFK assassination ] to allay the suspicion of government
cover-up.").

The Review Board has recently considered how it, along with the relevant federal
agencies, can best demonstrate to the American public that a thorough, good faith, and
diligent effort has been made to locate and release all remaining assassination-related
records within the control of the United States Government (and that the Government is
not hiding any such materials from public disclosure). Pursuant to the Congressional
mandate under the JFK Act to "create an enforceable, independent, and accountable
process for the public disclosure of such records," 44 U.S.C. § 2107(2)(a)(3), thie Review
Board seeks to have the relevant federal agencies provide a complete and specific
accounting of their efforts to locate and release assassination-related records, including
a full explanation for any destruction of such records.
Accordingly, the Review Board requests that each relevant agency adhere to the formal
compliance program (hereinafter "JFK Act Compliance Program") outlined below and
devised by the Review Board pursuant to its powers under Section 7(j)(1)(A), (B), (C),
(D), and (F) of the JFK Act. We hereby request that you undertake the following
measures by the dates provided (these dates were set in view of the fact that the
Review Board's operations currently are scheduled to expire on September 30, 1997):
1.
2.
Designation of Agency Compliance Official (or officials) and statement of
intent to comply with the JFK Act. We request that by December 9, 1996,
your agency designate an Agency Compliance Official who ultimately will
be responsible for ensuring that the agency has complied with its
obligations under the JFK Act, including the identification, location, and
organization of assassination records and the transmission of those
records to the National Archives and Records Administration ("National
Archives"). Although the Review Board assumes that Mr. John Pereira or
Mr. Barry Harrelson will serve in this position, we nevertheless await
your formal confirmation. If necessary, your agency may designate
additional persons with knowledge of the measures that have been
undertaken to locate assassination records.
We also request that by December 9, 1996, the agency convey its
agreement to adhere to the compliance procedures outlined in this letter.
To the extent that any compliance procedure described below appears to
be unreasonable or to present difficulties that we may not have
anticipated, please explain why and make alternate suggestions to us.
Initial Statement of Compliance. We request that the Agency Compliance
Official prepare, by January 6, 1997, an initial written statement of the
13-00000
The Honorable John M. Deutch
November 27, 1996
Page 3
agency's compliance with the JFK Act ("Statement of Compliance"),
setting forth the steps that the agency has taken to locate and process
assassination records. The Review Board recognizes that many of the
relevant federal agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency, have
previously written letters to the Review Board apprising it of their
progress at various stages of identifying and processing assassination
records under the JFK Act. The Statement of Compliance, while it may
include information previously reported to the Board, is to be the agency's
comprehensive and final report to the American public of what it has
done to locate records relating to the assassination. This Statement of
Compliance shall include, to the fullest reasonable extent, the following
information:
a.
b.
A complete description of all steps that your agency took to
identify and locate assassination records including, but not limited
to, an identification of the major record collections and files that
were consulted in the agency's search, any departmental file
indices consulted, the names and titles of the persons who were
responsible for conducting the searches, the physical locations of
the records that were searched, the off-site storage facilities (e.g.,
Federal Records Centers) searched, the specific steps that were
taken to locate and retrieve materials in archives, and any other
criteria used by the agency to locate assassination records.
A description of the steps that the agency took in direct response to
specific requests of the Review Board to locate certain additional
records or information relating to the assassination. In particular,
we ask that the CIA describe what specific steps it has taken to
address the following requests: CIA-9, Publications and Analytical
Materials (See David G. Marwell letter dated March 6, 1996 to Mr.
John Pereira); CIA-11, Silvia Duran's Original Statement (See David
G. Marwell letter dated May 3, 1996 to Mr. John Pereira); CIA-12,
JMWAVE Materials (See David G. Marwell letter dated May 22,
1996 to Mr. John Pereira); for HTLINGUAL records (See T. Jeremy
Gunn Memorandum dated October 1, 1996 to Mr. Barry Harrelson);
and for Monthly Operational Reports on Cuban Exile Groups (See
Manuel E. Legaspi Memorandum dated October 17, 1996 to Mr.
Barry Harrelson).

The Honorable John M. Deutch

Page 4
C.
To the extent that any assassination-related records have been
destroyed by the agency or any agency official, a full and specific
explanation of the circumstances surrounding the destruction of
such records.
d.
The status of remaining work that you can now identify that needs
to be completed by your agency in order to comply fully with the
JFK Act, including an identification of the categories of records
that must be processed and transmitted to the National Archives, a
description of any additional searches for files that must be done,
and the projected date(s) for completion of these tasks.
3.
Review Board Interview With Agency Compliance Official (or Officials).
Shortly after the submission of the agency's written Statement of
Compliance, we ask that the Agency Compliance Official (as well as any
persons who helped prepare the agency's initial Statement of
Compliance) be made available to the Review Board for an interview
regarding the location of agency assassination records. The interview will
be used as an opportunity to resolve any outstanding questions regarding
the agency's search, including any follow-up tasks to be completed by the
agency. The Review Board anticipates that these interviews will be
conducted in January 1997.
4.
Submission of Final Agency Declaration of Compliance. By July 1, 1997,
Federal agencies are expected to complete the process of identification,
location, and declassification of its assassination records at which time
they should submit to the Review Board a final declaration certifying,
under oath, their compliance with the provisions of the JFK Act (the "Final
Declaration of Compliance"). Because of the volume of CIA records, such
a "final" statement may not be practicable at that time. However, we do
expect that CIA will provide a complete status appraisal by July 1, 1997.
This final declaration shall set forth all of the information initially set forth
in the initial Statement of Compliance and shall also supplement the initial
Statement of Compliance by detailing any further steps that were
conducted by the agency in identifying and locating assassination records.
The agencies' Final Declarations of Compliance will be included in our
final report to Congress.

5.
Compliance Depositions. Starting on or about August 1, 1997, the Review
Board, pursuant to its statutory authority, may conduct depositions,
under oath, of the Agency Compliance Official along with any other
agency officials with responsibility for complying with the JFK Act. The
decision to take a compliance deposition of an agency will be made on a
case by case basis, taking into account the importance of the agency to the
work of the JFK Act and the sufficiency of the agency's efforts to account
fully for its compliance with the JFK Act. In the event that the Review
Board decides to commence a compliance deposition of an agency, the
responsible agency designee(s) will be expected to testify under oath with
respect to any and all issues relating to the agency's record search,
including the scope of the search, the identity of files searched, the
destruction of any relevant records, and any other matters set forth in the
Final Declaration of Compliance. Any person obligated to appear for a
deposition under oath shall be fully entitled to obtain legal representation.
We look forward to receiving your initial response, by December 9, that designates your
Agency Compliance Official and includes your statement regarding your position with
respect to the provisions outlined in this letter. To the extent that you have any
questions or suggestions regarding the Compliance Program, please do not hesitate to
contact our General Counsel, T. Jeremy Gunn, at (202) 724-0088.
Thank you for your cooperation with our work.
Sincerely,
lione

ExDir, dtd. 27 Nov 1996, (attached)
1. The attached request was received from the
Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) in March 1996.
It
appears from our records that a copy was not sent to you.

Directorate Focal Point a copy of the request as soon as
received.) This is one of several requests placed on hold
while we worked on other ARRB priorities.
2. In the Agency's response to the 27 November
"Compliance" letter (see reference), we asked the ARRB to
prioritize their requests. The ARRB staff has identified
CIA-9 as a “priority" request.
3. The initial request is for access not release. We
usually limit access to sensitive material to Jeremy Gunn,
ARRB General Counsel, and one or two of his staff. If the
material is particularly sensitive, access is restricted to
Mr. Gunn and/or the Executive Director of the Board,
David Marwell. Gunn, Marwell and all members of the ARRB
Staff's CIA team are fully cleared (TS/SCI).
Mr.

(see attachments) from 1994 and 1995. Jim has obtained from
IP&CRD full-text copies of the documents. He will be in
touch with you concerning access to these specific
documents.

and possible Cuban training bases in the Minsk region for
the period October 1959 to January 1963.
Helsinki and visas to try to capture information
on Oswald's visa application. The Board also asked for
information on hotels in Moscow and Minsk where Oswald may
have stayed.

December 10, 1997
Welcome back! Here are the two letters we received from the LBJ Library with
the listed materials attached. We can process these documents as assassination records
by designating only the sections of the reports/checklist/memoranda that are
assassination related and declaring the rest NBR. We could include a short
memorandum which explains that these documents are compilations of lots of issues,
and the NBR redactions are unrelated to the assassination. If these materials are about
to be released under the Executive Order and there are no redactions in the
assassination related parts, the Board will probably not need to see them.
As long as you are talking to the Executive Order folks, there were additional
materials (beyond the ones specified in these letters) which the LBJ Library sent to CIA
and I reviewed early last spring. Some of those items also could be designated as
assassination records. I can give you a copy of the list if you don't have it. It would be
nice to know what has happened to these materials too.
Thanks for checking on this issue. It is part of CIA-9 If this issue is settled,
CIA-9 may be close to completion.

DI/IRO
JFK Assassination Review Board Request
1. On 11 June 1997 members of the DI/IRO staff, oss
personnel, and Bonnie Hunter of your staff met with Michelle
Combs and Bob Skwriot of the JFK Assassination Review Board
to discuss DI document retrieval methods. The meeting was
requested by the Board to provide them with a clearer
understanding of DI document searches.
2. Ilse Hartman and Joyce Jump of OSS provided a
detailed overview of the document retrieval process. Ilse
walked the board members through a typical request, document
search, and retrieval. The Board members were satisfied with
the thorough nature of the process and appreciated the time
spent to provide a detailed overview.
3. During our discussions the Board members asked for
five additional topics which they felt might be appropriate
to research on the JFK assassination. These were:
USSR, Cuba, and Mexico combined with the term assa-
ssination for the period 20-30 November 1963.
Minsk radio factories(where Oswald was employed)
and possible Cuban training bases in the Minsk region for
the period October 1959 to January 1963.
Helsinki and visas to try to capture information
on Oswald's visa
