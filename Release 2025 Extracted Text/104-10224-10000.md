In addition, important information collected locally

by Subject on

to other agencies oftices in the area.

Sunject was the only Station

source of such information wnich wis

acquired only because of Subject's

ability to maintan rapport with agents, terminated during the period

because of the cutback

In Infiltration operations.

It could also be noted as Subject finishes his

long tour at this

Station and propares for his nost assignment, that he is a thoroughly

professional intelligence officer and is,

many ways, an outstandirg

one.

Technically, he is an export on infiltration tactics and, though

his Special Forces

experience,

an expert on anti-guerrilla varfare as

well.

Just as important, is his ability to gain respect and rapport

with

foreign agents.

Ic has

:

REFERDiCE:

Grayrton L. Lynch

Mr. Lynch's memorandu to

Director of Personnel, dated

22 June 1971.

On the basis of what I can recall from the time I was.

connected th the Day of Pigs activity and roy years with Whi

Diviaion Inercafter, Mr. Lynch hit slated his tasks correctly.

Since the issue in whother Mr. Lynch's servico in Miami.

could be carbidered equivalent to that of an Operations Oilicer over-

seas, tie following might be considered:

sir. Lynch had to oporate clardestinely.

He used pseudonymo, safceites for mectings, non-

officisi cover.

He handled, trained and dispatched agents. Ho

deoritied them. He worked with thern side by side.

He worked long, irregular hours (days and nights)

under unusual pressures and at personally inconvenient

and uppealing sites.

11c. Lynch was, during the Bay of Pigs period at

in real personal danger. (Our case officers abroad

do not often face such situations nor do they have to display

such courage.)

In summary, dr. Lynch's tasis were professionally

and personally more demanding than those de many of our

Operationo Olficory abroad. He had do apply clandestine techniques

and concepts. in a highly volatile and difficuit operational climato.

To admit him to

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director oi Personse

SUBJECT

: Recommendation for deproval of

Mr. Grayston L. Lyzit as a Participant

in the CIA Retiremer: and Disability System

REFERENCE

: HR 20-50

1.

It is strongly recommended that Me. Grayston L. Lynch

be approved as a participant in the CLA Retirement and Disability

System.

2. It is the upinion of the Special Operations Division that

the duties performed by Mr. Lynch from the lime he entered on duty

in February 1901 until carly 1908 meet the spürit and intent of ihe

criteria for "qualitying service" as defined is iIR 20-50b. The lone

exception to these criteria is that Mr. Lynch was not "abroad"

during the time involved except on a sporadic basis. This exception,

however, was due completely to the geographical location of the area

of operations.

This location made it uniquely propitious to have

Mr. Lynch assigned to and work out of a domestic base.

There ig

no question, however, that Mr. Lynch's serrite was in the conduct

and support of covert operations which require continuing practico

of security and traducraft procedures and which included, from

time to time, hazards to his life and health.

it is also believed

that Mr. Lynch would be at a disadvantage in cotaining other employ-

ment because of the sensitivity of his past sezrice as well as the

dearth of requirements for his peculiar background, skills and

knowledge.

3: On the basis of the above and Mi. Lynch's unique per..

sonal record, it is believed that his service diring the described

period is certainly equivalent to if not in cicess vi the requirements

for "creditable service abroad" and that if it tad not been for a

geographical accident, this service would hare been performed as

mid Hey West, Florida preparing WIl Agent assets lor operational

assigments. In March 1961 he delt boy West Floride aboard a covert Agency

vessel for Nicaragua where he assisted in the preparation of Agency vessels

artassels acheduled for operations into Cube.

in lepril 1961, he left

tvins into Cuba for sevoral dig" following the incasion Landing. For this

action Me. Lynch asapest received the Intellizence Star.

Mr. Lynch

siesequently served as i paramilitary operations dtficer at Miami, Florida

During this perica he participated in

This has resulted in a medical hold being paced on Mr.. Lynch

for spy overscas assignment CS or TDY, Since ne is uniquely a field

spainst operationo vificer there are literally no deartental duties to which

he can be, assigned. Since there in no suitable aselessnest available for

Mr, Lynch it is neceanary to terminate Mi. Lynch's contract as a Career

Since he is eligible for Involuntary Retiremert under CLARDS, Mr.

Iyrics bas made application for retirement eifectine lu September 1971.

In view of Mr. Lynch's age, specialiced skills, ling cervice in i uniquely

anasilive area, and peculiar contribution to the Agency's mission it is

believed that a termination bonus at the time of his retirement is fully

warrailed.

Mr. Lynch is currently che equivalent of a 05-14, step 5 with in

annual salary of 923; 591.

The proposed $10, 000 cermination bonus represents

tierefore, less than 12% of his annual saliry or approximately 5 months

pay. In connection with this, it should be noted tra: if he vere being termina-

led rather thin retiring, he would be entitled by viruse of the provisions uf

hii contract to 90 days notice which would equal approximatoly 36, 000 at

his current rate of pay in salary alone. Additioral triage benefits would

it 1s understood

thit he will--on his own initiative and with whatever

assistanco and encouragement we can properly provide--

make an offort to overcome his phobia

of flyins and

thereby, in dus, course, qualify medically for IDY or PCS

2.

In view of Mi. Lynch's past history, however,

we cannot assume

that he will to succossful

or will even

actively pross to overcome his probicm.

in spite of his

cureel arent status and his opcrational performance

(Intelligence Star), we cannot,

in all conscience,

carry

him on SOD

capncity.

He has completed all of the advancer and re-

fresher

operations training necessary to qualify for

assignment now.

Ho has not adapied well nor has he been

receptive to the kinds of headquarters duty assignents

open to him. He is a field paranilitary officer.

3.. It is prudent, therefore, to begin contin-

gency plining now for his appropriate retirement and

outplacement into a job which will offor hin both security

and personal satisfaction.

H1s Spanish language training

should enlarke

predict he will not, at least at first,

take at all kindly

He is emotionally involved, and identities

It was determined that no action would be taken on

this case until after the first of the year (1971) at

which time. Mr. Lynch will be advised by C/SOD/ Personnel

that he will be made available for a suitable operational

assignment, most likely overseas, unless he opts to apply

for disability retirement.

If Mr. Lynch opts to apply for disability retirement

he will be

continued in his present assignment pending

approval of his retirement.

If Mr. Lynch chooses to be shopped for a field

assign-

ment, SOD will initiate action to locate such a position.

When found, Mr. Lynch will be processed for the assignment.

Should he fail to be medically approved, action will be

taken to obtain his retirement for medical rensons. Should

an assignment not be forthcoming by April 1971 a medical

disposition for overseas planning purposes (Gencral) will

be requested.

The purpose of the above scheduled action is to either

find a suitable assignment for Mr. Lynch or to effect his

disability retirement on either a voluntary or involuntary

COURSE OBJECTIVES - Content and Methods

The course aime to provide a description of counterintelligence in the

covert and clandestine warfare of today in both friendly and enemy areas.

To do so, a brief description of the intent, purpose, and dynamics of .

espionage, subversion and counterintelligence as practiced by the major

enemy forces is provided and this is contrasted to the spectrum of counter-

intelligence activities of the United States of America and of allied countries.

To support counterintelligence missions levied upon the Agency, a review

of the cooperation and coordination and exchange of information and services

between cooperating services is provided. Counterintelligence is then

related to all other Clandestine Service operations and its place as a part

thereof is demonstrated. To provide the student with a framework within

which to work; the organization of the Agency for counterintelligence is

also provided.

A CHIEVEN ENT RECORD

This is a certificate of attendance. Since this course is a survey

course, it does not attempt to qualify the student as a counterintelligence

operations officer and no evaluation is made of individual performanco.

The organizational concept to be followed is that of

All personnel should

be fully qualified in basic paramilitary skills and should bo

physically and mentally prepared to mount operations on short

Airborne capabilities will be developed when facilities

necessary for training become available.

4.

The standards for members of the group should be con-

stantly upgraded by culling of members who become marginal or

who

do not develop as expected.

Recruitment uf promising new members

will be dopendent on the needs of the station based

on policy

directives.

Priority should be given to sabotago training to

permit the mounting of a sabotage. program at the carliest possible

moment.

Coincidentally, planning and thought should be given to

the topics of cover, recruitment, training and establishment of

those facilities necessary for a rapid expansion of the group if

a full scale operational program should be developed. . Also, the

force should be identified to the primary exilc authority as a

non political and independent body which is unilaterally engaged

in the overthrow of the

existing regime.

The tempo of training

should be maintained

at a level sufficient to assure the continual

proficiency of the group in all categories of activity in readiness

for the order to mount a full scale program with all teams parti-

cipating simultaneously. Readiness will not itself be justifica-

The writers' contract, ns. Caroer Agent, states in Para 1:

"Allowance:

You will be cntitled to:

ance In conformance with applicable government regulations.

may be provided quarters by your cover facility of the government

and, in such event, you will not be ontitled to the living quitters

allowance or an cqualization allowanco in llou thereof, a supplo-

mentary post allowance, a

transfer allovance,

a basic

service

transfer allowance, an education allowanco, and a separation

allowance."

2.

It appears clear to the wiltor that any

housing allowance

which

applies to staffers also applios to tho writer.

This would

then necessarily have lo commence at the same time for both typos

in order to be equal.

3.

It is requested the writers' housing allowance be timed

to commence on the same dato as

the Staffers in ordor to comply

with the intent of the contract.

The contents of this memorandum will be established

in DEVUONO's file in other form a: iater date by the writer.

DEVUONO has completed one year with CUSOG. In this

period he has shown a complete

practical knowledge of

paramilitary techniques and

This knowledge is born

of experience and application.

ris application of this

knowledge for KUBARK has resulted in visible progress in the

technical abilities of CUSOG personnel.

He has shared CUSOG responsibilities of organization,

administration and

operational

preparation in a manner to

follow out KUBARK practices to its

credit.

He carries out clear instructions to the letter,.

reflecting a military

background.

Contrary to observances noted in a previous fitness

report DEVUONO has been

found to be anything but naive in

his dealings with PBRUMENS during the period observed.

6.

His administrative and accounting procedures within

CUSOG are in order.

Hesitating

to call them beainesses, the writer must

state that DIVUONO's entire experierce with KUBARK has been

field experience, usually far out or. a long string of contacts

into a KUBARY installation, a fact which has prevented a 100k

This man

has good potential for helpins rUbARk's

paramilitary effort, which potential will be sure effective

when he has been schooled in the terminologied and peculari-

ties

of paranilitary KUBARK-style.

It is recurrended a tour

•by DEVUONO where

such schooling can be conducted as on-the-

job training would most bring out this potential.

MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT:

Folicy Concerning Guests at Award Ceremonies

The Cice of the Director has determined that when inviting

quests to award ceremonies, the Agency will be as liberal as possible

within the bounds di trailable space and security considerations since

one of the puryoses s an award ceremony is to let the family, iriends,

and associates oi the recipient know that he has been honored.

In implemeating this policy the points listed below will be

guiding criteria:

a. Any Ajaacy einployee who is a friend of a recipient

may come to & ceremony, up to the limit of space available,

If the recipien isks that he be present.

b. Any Government employee (who is not employed by the

Agency but waa is witting of the recipient's employment) can

come so long as there are no operational security ressons that

would make tüs gresence inappropriate.

c. Any irvazd who is not employed by the Government may

be invited onir ¿ it is obviously desirable (Example-- A very

close old friend tino stood in the relationship of "family" to the

recipient wher subject had no immediate family). Friends who

are not emplored by the Government normally would be

discouraged.
