OCCURRENCE:

The Special Group discussed (1) the possibility of providing sixty

thousand dollars from the Cuba budget to Sponsor the religious activity of. Father

Peyton in Cuba; (2) a proposal to survey the possibility of establishing a strike

base in Nicaragua; (3) the necessity for the Defense Department to supply 38 military

men to CIA.

"Mr. Douglas questioned whether the present concept of 600 or 700

Cubans is any longer practicable.

He said that it had been his understanding that

-the-current-thinking-contemplated_figures_more_on_the_order_of_3.,000."

- Mr. Barnes

replied that the CIA believes what is required is enough individuals to serve as

a rallying point for the anti-Castro elements in Cuba and thus 600 is as useful as

3,000. The CIA justified the request for 38 military men because it now believed

it was necessary to train the Cubans in infantry tactics involved in a defense, in

addition to the guerrilla warfare training previously contemplated.

upon which to base the decision to undertake actions to cause the overthrow of Castro.

The plan itself at pages 00183 through 00187, included establishing intelligence-agents

inside Cuba; collecting intelligence from Cubans inside the United States; counterfeiting

ration cards and currency inside of Cuba; geographical surveys of air fields, military

installations, communications centers; attempts to place trained agents inside the government

A similar project was noted for jet fuel storage tanks in Cuba.

Lansdale noted that the CIA had concluded that its realistic role should be to at least

create the illusion of a popular movement, to win external support for it, to improve

CIA operational capability, and to help create a climate which will permit provocative

actions in support of a shift to overaction. Lansdale wanted them to reevaluate

to see whether or not they could make a greater effort. An outline of what the 33 tasks

OCCURRENCE: It was agreed that Harvey was to work towards reaching a stagein the

interrogation of Pedro Roige the Guban economic official who defected. to Mexico, where

he can be surfaced to make 'public charges of Cuban Communist operations against Latin

American nations. Harvey was to generate a story from Cuban refugee sources that the

original Cardenas incident consisted of a demonstration concerning the shortage of food.

This was to cause ridicule of the Communist regime's use of MIGs, tanks and troops against

the unarmed-people of Cardenas.
