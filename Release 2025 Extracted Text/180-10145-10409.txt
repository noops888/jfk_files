Robert Genzman and Harold
Leap interviewed Russell August
Langelle at CIA Headquarters
on May 4, 1978. The interview
yielded the following information:
Sangelle joined the CIA in
September 1950, and worked
mainly in SR9 of the Soviet
Russia Division. In November
1955 he resigned from the Agency.
The pretext was that he was
disgruntled with his assign-
ments. His CIA files would
have reflected this termination
of employment. The only document
to the contrary would have been
a memorandum from the Director
of Central Intelligence Allan
Dulles, stating that Sangelle
would retain all rights and benefits
when he returned to the CIA.
(At present this document would
probably be in his personnel
file.)
Approximately fifteen people
knew that Langelle was still
with the CIA after his resigna-
tion in 1955. These included
John Mawry (SE), Joe Bulich
(SR9), Quentin George Risevalper,
(SR9), Johnson (Chief
of Operations), Frank Levy,
Ted Pollings

de Silva (COS), and someone at
the State Department's Office of
Security
At the time of his resignation,
Langelle applied for employment
with the State Department. In
the interim he worked at the
Hecht Company. In March 1956
he started to work at the
State Department as a Security
Officer. In September 1956 he
was sent to Vienna, where he
earned a reputation for being
a strict security officer at the
Embassy. He was deliberately
tough on CIA personnel who
breached security in order to
build his cover as a non-CIA
foreign service officer. His
salary was paid by the State
Department. The CIA Chief of
Station in Vienna and the
Ambassador knew he was still
with the CIA.

Langelle served as the Security
Officer at the Moscow Embassy
from December 1957 to Septem-
ber 1959. In addition, he was the
senior CIA officer there. The
CIA contingent in Moscow
consisted of five or six officers.

working inside the Embassy and
approximately four outside. Inside,
with deep cover, were George
P. Winters (Econ. Officer), FNU
Mahoney, FNU Venables, and Steve
Washenko (Econ. or Agric. Officer).
Outside were Jean Leberman (teacher
at the American school) and
three or four students, who handled
orientation projects rather than
operations projects.
Langelle handled CIA
communications in Moscow. The
CIA used State Department
channels of communication, but
could code messages by means of
one-pad encrypting so that the
message was secret until it was
forwarded to CIA Headquarters for
decoding.
In 1959 the Soviets declared
Langelle persona non grata as a
result of his involvement with
P.S. Popov. Langelle was the
case officer for Popov, who worked
for the GRU, Soviet military
intelligence. While making a
contact with Popov, Langelle
was detained by the KGB
and was questioned for two
and a half hours. The KGB
attempted to recruit him, and
then released him. The State

Department filed a formal protest,
but Langelle was told to leave
the Soviet Union within three
days. He left the Soviet Union
in early October 1959.
Langelle first became aware
of Lee Harvey Oswald when he
heard in a conversation that a
Marine had contacted the
American consular office in
Moscow to renounce his citizen-
ship. He later heard that this
individual had changed his mind
and was returning to the United
States. He does not recall the
details of these conversations,
but he believes they took place in
the United States.
Langelle characterized Oswald's
defection as a consular case to
be handled by consular officers,
rather than an intelligence case
involving intelligence officers,
at that time in Moscow. He
stated that the few intelligence
officers in Moscow at that time
were involved in specific opera-
tions and did not perform general
intelligence functions. He also
stated that intelligence officers
at the Embassy did not use the
consular officers for intelligence
purposes, and that there were

no CIA people in the consular
section.
Sangelle stated that the
military intelligence people at the
Embassy probably would have been
contacted about Oswald's defection.
The military intelligence personnel
included Leo Dulacki (Marines),
Paul Adams (Navy), John
Munson (Navy), and Ted Hoffman
(Army). He did not know whether
Alexis Davison (Navy) was an
intelligence officer or whether
Davison was involved in the
Penkovsky case.
Langelle stated that when
Oswald left the Soviet Union,
he was the responsibility of the
State Department, the Immigration
and Naturalization Service, and
the FBI.
When Langelle left
Moscow in 1959, Winters was
the senior CIA officer there.
Mahoney and Leberman were still
there, and Washenko may still
have been there. Sangelle's
replacement as Embassy security
officer was John Abidian, who
was not with the CIA. Abidian
was later replaced by Hugh
Montgomery, who was Winter's
successor as senior CIA officer.

Montgomery was later replaced by
Paul Garbler, who became the
first officially designated Chief
of Station in Moscow. Other
CIA officers in Moscow circa
1962 included Rodney Carlson,
Bill Harbley, and possibly John
D. Hemingway. At Headquarters, the chief
of the Soviet Russia Division
was John Maury, followed by
Howard Osborne and then
David E. Murphy.
With regard to American
journalists in Moscow, Langelle
had no contacts with R. G.
Korengold or Alice Mosby, did
not know A. D. Goldberg, and
was contacted by Priscilla
Johnson for an interview after
he was declared persona non
grata.
When Langelle returned to the
United States, he continued working
for the State Department. He resumed
his CIA duties on a part-time basis
in 1961. He dealt with communications
between Washington and Moscow.
In September 1961 he resumed his CIA duties
on a full-time basis at Headquarters. He
worked mainly in the Soviet Russia
Division, External Operations, Africa and
Europe. At present he is still with the
CIA and is still paid by the State
Department, but he plans to retire soon.
