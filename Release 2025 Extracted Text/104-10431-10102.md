Dear Mi. Price:

This is a retyped letter.

I visited Mr. Fexry

I told in the

office that F.B.I. agente and

Secret Service use police department to harasa me.. Police department do

supply pencil of anesthesla gas to the manager of the building I live.

The

manager do or use certain people, to freeze me by anesthesia gas - then push

drugs,

poison in my mouth

to torture me - to take my sleep away • or bleed

by rectal and they use many other chemicals to brainwash me to use me in

political assassination which I refused. On January 20, 1976 in Sacramento on

8th and I Streets, man cane to me from police or post office, U.S. Department

of Justice and freeze me by gas and told me to take gun, pistol and we will

tell you where to go to shoot - to kill - MI. Sargent Shriver.

I refused.

Manager, Mr. Sisel, of Marshall Hotel, call on the man to tell me this on

the street.

In February 1976, police

intelligence told me that assassination

will not happen here. How about to move to Maryland state.

In this letter I ask you to get report from DI. Frederick S. Baker, M.D.

could be done..

The right wing in America
