Sir, as a private American citizen of good will, may I urge

you to seize this fateful opportunity to demonstrate to our

bereaved people an act of good faith and sympathy and so to

bridge the gulf of ill feeling between our peoples to remove the

barriers for mutual understanding and friendship. You can do

this by coming personally to the funeral of the late President

in Washington tomorIow.

((A)) A DI. SAUL KARCH is listed in the April 1963 Detroit telephone

directory.
