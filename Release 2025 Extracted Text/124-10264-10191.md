Section CI-3 conducted the following review and

makes the assessment pertinent thereto:

RE: Page 00026, "Siesta" and pages 00059-61, captioned

"Subject:

This matter concerns Orlando Nunez-Toro

(Bufile 105-141367), a United States citizen of Cuban

extraction, who was

suspected by CIA of attempting to

recruit for intelligence purposes CIA personnel, one

Miss Deborah Fitzgerald. By letter dated 8/4/70, the

Nunez and Fitzgerald, the FBI was requested to advise

whether it interposed any objections to CIA investigative

In response to that inquiry, FBIHQ advised CIA

to CIA investigation for such a purpose.

At the same time,

CIA was specifically requested to provide the FBI with any

information develoned relating to FBI internal security

CIA communicated with FBIHQ by letters dated

7/6/71 and 2/24/72, concerning the Nunez-Toro and

Deborah Fitzgerald

matter, requesting each time records

review of Bureau files of numerous individuals of interest

to CIA.

On each occasion CIA was provided with the results

material.

At the present time, it appears the paramount

concern is whether Nunez and Deborah Jane Fitzgerald are

obtaining intelligence information concerning your Agency,

and you have established a network of sources to cover that

aspect.

As you indicate, there is no specific evidence

that Nunez or Fitzgerald has any connection with a hostile

intelligence service or a foreign government. We, therefore,

will defer to your Agency until completion of your investigation

or the development of information showing they are engaged

in subversive activities within our primary jurisdiction." (5)

The FBI did not conduct an internal security-type

investigation regarding the relationship of Nunez-Toro and

Fitzgerald.

The FBI did conduct an internal security-type

investigation of Nunez-Toro in 1965 as a result of his

reported disaffection for the United States while living

contact was in that regard. s

A review of FBIHQ files

contain no information

that any FBl employee was knowledgeable, before or after

the fact, of a surreptitious entry on the part of CIA

personnel, into the premises of Nunez-loro and Deborah

Fitzgerald. That surreptitious entry by CIA personnel into

the premises of Nunez-loro and Fitzgerald located in

Fairfax, Virginia, received considerable publicity recently,

when it was alleged that Fairfax police assisted the CIA

during the entry. (S)

RE: Page 00026, "Paragon." (s)

This matter pertains to an alleged plot in

1972-73 to assassinate former Vice President Spiro Agnew

and the Director of CIA by using two Latin American

revolutionaries. A CIA informant abroad reported that

one Elizabeth Boynton Millard, a New York City resident

known for her Communist associations and her involvement

with Latin-American revolutionaries, was scheduled "to

finger" top United States Officials for assassination.

The plot was allegedly conceived some time prior to 8/19/72,

in Chile and was to be carried out sometime between 10/25/72

through 11/7/72. The FBI investigated this plot thoroughly (S)

and closed its investigation on 2/2/73, when it was

concluded that none of the individuals reportedly involved

had any connection with such activity.

ASSESSMENT:

No compromise of an on-going FBI operation.

RE: Page 00282, "28 October 1970."

During October, 1970, United States Government

officials, including Dr. Henry A. Kissinger, who was then

other government agencies, including CIA, were requested

to furnish the original cryptograms for fingerprint examination.

The contents of these pages concern the "Chilean

of the Chilean Embassy, Washington, D. C.,

to collect foreign

intelligence data and to compromise classified encrypted

diplomatic traffic.

CIA proposed that access be made

through one of their covert contacts.

The FBI declined.

The Attorney General then requested FBI cooperation.

5/13/71, a memorandum was sent to the Department of State

for approval of that operation and such approval was obtained

on 5/17/71.

On 7/14/71, the Attorney General authorized

activation of the microphone installation at the Chilean

Embassy until 10/8/71.

CIA requested continuation as the

expiration date approached and on 10/15/71, the Attorney

General authorized such continuation.

technical

surveillance was discontinued as noted in memorandum to

the Attorney General and CIA dated 2/7/72.

The surveillance

was reactivated on 12/27/72, and was eventually discontinued

on 2/22/73. (5)

On 6/19/73, the Watergate Special Prosecution Force

requested FBI investigation of the alleged burglary of the

Chilean Embassy, Washington, D. C., on or about 5/13/72.

The Metropolitan Police Department, Washington, D. C.,

conducted an investigation of that incident and submitted

a complete report to the Office of the United States Attorney.

That report was in the possession of the Watergate Special

Prosecution Force and on 10/30/73, that Force advised the

FBI that no additional investigation was desired.

There

is no connection between the "Chilean Project" and the

alleged burglary of the chilean Embassy on of about 5/13/72. (5)

ASSESSMENT:

• The above information refers to our special

coverage of the Chilean Embassy which was discontinued

in February, 1973, and has not been operational since that

time. Possession of such information by the Senate Committee (

will not interfere with any on-going FBI investigation.

All activities engaged in by the FBI in connection with

this project were conducted on the instruction of Attorney

General Mitchell.

RE: Page 00361, captioned "Memorandum for: Executive Secretary,

CIA Management Committee.

In addition to the "Chilean Project," the contents

of this page also refer to FBI technical coverage of diplomatic

establishments of Israel. It is pointed out that Watergate

Defendant James McCord telephoned the Embassy of Israel,

Washington, D. C., after his arrest, believing that his

conversation

would be overheard and

he would be able to

challenge tainted evidence. The date of his telephone call

to the Embassy of Israel is not known but it is pointed out

that our technical coverage of the Embassy of Israel was

discontinued on 10/16/72, at the specific request of Secretary

of State William Rogers.

This matter is also public knowledge.

ASSESSMENT:

No compromise of FBI operations.

RE: Pages 00457 and 00458, concerning Item Number 3.

According to CIA, this matter involved surreptitious

entries by CIA into a French diplomatic establishment,

Washington, D. C., during the early 1960's.

from reading Item number 3, there is no FBI involvement ir

or knowledge of such activities by CIA. (S)

It is pointed out that Philippe Thyraud De Vasjoli

(Bufile 64-33606) a former attache of the French Embassy,

Washington, D. C., and a former French Intelligence officer,

cooperated with CIA and provided CIA with information in

1963 that French intelligence planned to engage in intelligence

activities in the United States.

This information was

thereafter transmitted to the FBI. It is believed that

De Vosjoli is identical with either Iden-122 or Iden-124

mentioned in Item number 3. (5)

ASSESSMENT:

There is no compromise of an on-going FBI operation.

RE: Pages 00591-00593, captioned) MHCHAOS Program."/(5)

This CIA program involved the clandestine

collection abroad of information relating to foreign

efforts to support and influence domestic United States

extremism. The foreign-oriented activity in the

United States was of two types; first, selected FBI

informants who traveled abroad

in connection with their

extremist activity and their resultant debriefing by CIA

with

the cooperation of the FBI. Second, FBI sources with

existing extremist credentials who were offered to CIA

for dispatching abroad to collect information responsive

to CIA requirements. (s)

There has been no compromise of such FBI informants

and sources.

ASSESSMENT:

No compromise of any on-going FBI operation.

On 7/25/75 at the request of Special Counsel

Intelligence Coordinator Michael Shaheen in the Department,

a meeting was held between representatives of the FBI (SAs

• Paul B' Daly and John Thomas), representatives of the Senate

Select Committee (John T. Elliff, Task Force head of the Domestic

Task Force, Mark Gitenstein) and Michael Shaheen of the Department.

At this meeting Mr.

Shaheen advised that the proposed procedures

concerning the handlings of requests for documents by the Senate

Select Committee had been approved by the Attorney General and in

the Senate Select Committee.

(A copy is attached.)

Shaheen and Elliff indicated the purpose in meeting on

the 25th along with an anticipated meeting on Monday, 7/28/75, was

to assist the SSC in the planning of a superseding request in

accordance with the newly established procedures concerning

document requests.

Both Shaheen and Elliff expressed concern at

this time that the schedules set torth in the new agreement was

isuch that in many instances the Bureau would not be able to

respond in time to meet the deadlines. AdditionaLly, shaheen

expressed concern that the provisions require that the Attorney

General adjudicate any question as to the necessity of furnishing

Ja document to the Committee and to make such a decision within

24

hours would be very burdensome.

Messrs. Elliff and Shaheen were advised by SA Daly that.

this would be true, pointing out that in many instances files are

not readily available because of FOlA requests, needs of the

Bureau's ongoing investigations and law suits in which it was

necessary to view particular files:

It was also pointed out that

many of

the requests of the Senate Select Committee necessitate

the review of a number of files and/or numerous. volumes of a

particular file all of which are not necessarily available

immediately.

Mr. Shaheen advised that it was the Attorney

General's desire

question arise during litigation.

It was pointed out that

In many areas of possible abuse set forth by the Senate

Select Committee we have pending FOIA requests and/or

litigation which require the availability of those files

for responses.

Elliff indicated that it was the Committee's desire

in their forthcoming superseding request to request material

that had been previously furnished the Committee with the under-

standing that there would be less excisions made in compliance

with the new agreement:

He inquired as to whether the Bureau

could advise him as to

what material previously furnished was

readily retrievable and could be furnished in accordance with

a new request.

He was advised by SAs Daly and Thomas that it was

not possible at this time to give him a response, however, we would

Regarding the "Third Agency" rule

problem, we advised the Department and the Committee that we

would continue to abide by this rule.. The Committee presented

a request dated July 28, 1975, captioned "Superseding Request

for FBI Materials."

This document amounted to a recapitulation

of prior requests made by the Committee with a schedule for

delivery set forth in accordance with the established guidelines

for the production of documents : An item-by-item

analysis. of

the

request contained in the document was had

and where necessary

modifications concerning scheduled responses was made.

It was

obvious the intent of the Committee in making the superseding

request was to have more documents made available in the Commit-

tee offices

and also to. have less excisions made on documents

"previously furnished the Committee based on prior requests.

were requested by Shaheen to prepare as soon as possible cor-

respondence to the Attorney General setting forth instances where

deadlines set by the Committee could not be made.

This prompted

the provisions in the guidelines for the production of documents

which require the Attorney General to notify the Committee Chair-

man and Vice Chairman within 24 hours of any. expected delay beyond

96 hours of the request.

review Sections 10 and 12 (copies attached) of the Manual of Rules and

Regulations for any possible excisions or problems in furnishing this

material to the committee and to furnish the results of the review to Legal.

Counsel, attention Dennis R. Dickson.

Section 10, pertaining to Appeals and Grievances, and Section 12,

Transters-Resignations, have been reviewed and no problems can be foreseen

and no excisions are necessary. In this regard, it is noted that Part I,

Section 10, Appeals and Grievances, needs to be revised to set forth the

current appeal rights of nonveterans. Attached is memorandum recommending

a Manual revision be approved pointing out that under current procedure,

final action in disciplinary matters involving cases of nonveterans up to and

including dismissal is taken by the Assistant Director, Administrative

Division, with the employee having the right to appeal this action to the

Director.

There was some question under Section 12 dealing with transfers to

foreign assignments wherein it is set out that Chief Clerks should be afforded

training in maintenance, consolidation, and destruction of files, whether this

information should be furnished. This was discussed with Deputy Assistant

Director, Homer R. Hauer, Files and Communications Division, who advised

there is nothing objectionable to this reference regarding destruction of files

and the reference of same need not be excised.

Under Section 12, dealing with foreign assignments, intormation is

set out regarding people being transferred to such assignments receiving

training on coding equipment, the AFSAM-7. This was questioned as to

whether it should be excised. Alvin C. Frank, Section Chief, Communications

Section, advised this information need not be excised as the mere reference

to AFSAM coding equipment is nitrobjaatio

"Memorandum Burns to Walsh

Re: Senate Select Committee

It should also be noted that certain Manual changes are being

recommended in connection with Section 12, in relation to absences for

maternity purposes. In Section 12, page 10, we are recommending that

the phrase "absence for maternity reasons" be used in all instances where

we have previously used the phrase "maternity leave." These recommended

revisions have already been approved and are being processed. In

Section 12, page 8, we are recommending a revision indicating that

employees resigning for maternity purposes can utilize accrued sick leave

during their period of incapacitation and are not setting out specific time

elements as previously utilized. Memorandum is attached recommending

this change.

RECOMMENDATION:

That this memorandum be furnished to Intelligence Division;

with three copies to Legal Counsel Division, setting forth that the

Administrative Division has no objection to the material set out in •

Sections 10 and 12, including proposed revisions, of the Manual of Rules

and Regulations being referred for review.

At the request of the Senate Select Committee

(SSC), we recently furnished to it superseded material dated

back to 1960 and relating to various sections of the Manual

of Instructions, including Section 87. In furnishing this

material, we did not furnish the various cover sheets

relating to the many revisions since 1960.

We have received a telephonic request from

Miss Martha Talley of the SSC Staff for additional infor-

mation which would help her to better understand the various

revisionsto Section 87. She also specifically desired a

copy of page 1 of that Section as it existed on 1/1/60.

We have secured the various cover sheets for the

many revisions, as well as a copy of page 1 which bears

the revision date of 8/13/56 and which, according to

Mrs. Alene I. Smith of the Training Division, was the page 1

in force as of 1/1/60.

In order to comply with the request of Miss Talley,

it is not believed necessary to obtain from the SSC a

formal, written request; neither is it believed necessary

to transmit the requested material by formal correspondence

to the SSC through the Attorney General.

• In their investigation of COINTELPRO, SSC has been

given access to material from which we excised only informants

and potential informants as defined in Manual of Instructions.

When such material was requested for delivery, we have excised

identities of all individuals to whom we have incurred an

obligation to protect their identity and relationship with the

FBI. SSC has objected to these more extensive excisions in

delivered material, claiming the agreed-upon procedures do

not allow us such latitude. This was not our understanding

of the agreement.

As a result of this impasse, on morning of 8/8/75,.

the Director and other FBI representatives met with the

Attorney General (AG) and the Deputy Attorney General (DAG)

in an attempt to resolve the question. The AG deferred a

decision at that time pending the receipt of certain requested

information concerning the general COINTELPRO operation. Later

that date, Mr. John Elliff, SSC, contacted SAs William O. Cregar

and Elmer

W. Larson of the

Senstudy Project, INTD, and stated

the DAG had

suggested he attempt to get together with Bureau

representatives and reach some sort of

compromiser

accommodation in this area.

who had cooperated with the FBI in the COINTELPRO operations,

be interviewed by S'SC Representatives so that a more accurate

picture could be obtained concerning possible harm to

COINTELPRO targets. He indicated there was a deadline set

for completion of COINTELPRO phase of SSC investigation and

time did not allow for extensive interviews; however, he

estimated that given no deadline a maximum of 36 such contacts

would be made and, in view of the deadline, 8 to 12 interviews

lof the type indicated to be more realistic. Mr. Elliff isolated

three cases which he suggested might most easily lend themselves

to a compromise on this point and suggested they be considered

by the Bureau. If the Bureau saw fit to agree in these

instances, he suggested further deliberations be made to

select further cases in which the cooperative sources' identities

could be made available to the SSC.

SAs Cregar and Larson emphasized to Elliff that the

principle involved here was not whether or not the cooperative

source was of great and current value to the FBI but that the

issue was the FBI's obligation to the source to protect the

While professing to

donodent a te Validity dee hire pole on in this regard,

Elliff, nonetheless, was adamant in his standing that the SSC

be allowed to contact these sources without the FBI first

contacting them to ascertain their amenability to such interview.

It was stressed to Elliff that prior contact of these sources

by the FBI would be mutually advantageous since it would

satisfy FBI obligation to the source and, if the source then

agreed to interview, would provide the SSC with a forth-coming

cooperative witness. Finally, after much discussion, Elliff

suggested that the three cases presented by him be approved and

following this he would be willing to consider negotiation

concerning further disclosures of identifies of sources based

on FBI proposal of prior contact. The three cases proposed by

Elliff are briefly set out below:

2. In 1966, we furnished information to a California

St to be so ayer police come in sent that i desires

to interview this source.

3. In 1968, the editor of a Tucson, Arizona,

newspaper contacted our resident agency in Tucson and requested

pertinent background data concerning some of the activists in

various anti-draft, anti-Vietnam and similar groups in the

Tucson area who had been receiving considerable publicity of

late. Authority was granted to furnish public source data to

the newspaper man. SSC now wishes to identify this contact

and interview

him.

On 8/12/75; the Director was advised of the proposal

by Mr. Elliff. The Director indicated he desired to adhere to

the current policy of not divulging identity of sources with

whom the FBI has a confidential relationship; however, he

extended an invitation for Mr. Elliff to meet with him on

8/18/75 at 4:00 p.m., for further discussion of this issue.

During the morning of 8/12/75, the Director's position and

invitation was conveyed to Mr. Elliff by SA Cregar. Shortly

thereafter, Mr. Elliff called back to advise that he appreciated

the invitation but that in his view-the meeting would merely

contribute to further delay and that he planned to contact

This recommends representatives of Special and

General Investigative Divisions review material from

inspection reports which may be requested by the Senate

Select Committee (SSC) to determine whether any excisions

would be necessary before it is made available to the SSC.

By letter dated 5/14/75, the SSC, Appendix B,

Item I, Number 5, requested access to annual inspection

reports and related surveys for the past 10 years with

respect to the Intelligence Division and 10 field offices.

At a conference between members of the SSC Staff and

representatives of the Department of Justice and the FBIHQ

Senstudy staff, 5/30/75, it was agreed that in response to

the above request we would make available to the SSC Staff,

for review at FBIHQ, copies of the reports of the two

inspections conducted of the Domestic Intelligence Division in 1971

and the inspection of the San Francisco Office during

October, 1970.

by making a written request for access to it. The criminal

portions removed are attached to the tickler copies of this

memorandum designated for Messrs. Cleveland and Gallagher,

as they relate to matters within their Divisions' purview.

it has been

It has been our experience that the SSC generally does request

to see or obtain material not furnished during responses to

an initial request. Thereforé, it would be prudent for

representatives of the General and Special Investigative

Divisions

to, at this time, review the material attached to

Messrs. Cleveland and Gallagher's ticklers and make a

determination as to whether any excisions must be made before

review by the SSC Staff, should same be requested.

Generally,

under current ground rules, only material which would identify

sensitive sources, including cooperative foreign agencies,

or violate the Third Agency Rule, may be excised. Inquiries

regarding current ground rules may be made by the Senstudy

representatives of the General and Special Investigative

Divisions of Supervisor J. P. Thomas, Room 4063 JEH,

Extension 4636.

It is recommended that the material attached to

the ticklers of Messrs. Cleveland and Gallagher be reviewed

7. Agents contacting informants outside of normal working

hours obtained supervisory approval for these contacts

prior to making them and make appropriate notations on

their #3 cards.

Supervisors thereafter, during file

reviews with Agents, check with them regarding those

contacts and spot-check informant files to insure after-

hour contacts were made and appropriately recorded.

• PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT •

I. The overall objectives of the criminal informant program

are to develop high quality informants who are in a

position to furnish valuable information on a continuing

basis.

Criminal desk supervisors participate in the program by

remaining

alert to the necessity of having good informant

coverage in the criminal classifications which are covered

by their respective desks.

The supervisor is also

required to approve any expenditure made to an informant

any case

handled on his desk and in this way will be awar. of the

progress of the progrant as it relates to their deik.

The supervisors also follow the Agents' activities in

this regard on an individual basis to insure that. they

are fully participating in the informant program.

The San Francisco Office does have standards which

requires all Agents assigned one year or more to this

division should conform to and that is they should have

a minimum of four PCIs or one CI and two PCIS or two

CIs assigned at any one time. This, of course, is by

no means considered a maximum and many Agents

participate more fully in the program.

There are currently no first office agents assigned to

this division and when an Agent is transferred to this

division and assigned to criminal work he is expected

to show some progress by the end of sixty days and

within one year he is expected to le in compliance

with the above standaras.

Special Agents assigned to Squad 2 have been

instructed to continually be alert to develop top quality

informants in order to carry out the responsibilities in

their investigative fields. The work on the squad is broken

down into to major categories, the first of which includes

bank rovberies and kidnappings.

Agents specifically assigned

to develop informants in this field are SAS, MONTE A. HALI,

FRANCIS J. COLLOPPY, JR., THOMAS J. PADDEN, ARDEN F. KEITH,

ELDEN LOLFFELHOLZ,

and WILLIAM R. tenBENSEL.

Regarding the Government reservations,

it is noted

that specific liaison assignments have been made in regard

to these but inasmuch as persons normally contacted on these

bases are Government employees contacted on an official

basis, they are not considered appropriate for development

as CIs and are bound to furnish information as part of

their auties.

It is noted, however, that the Hunters Point

Naval Shipyard is in a predominantly ivegro area and two

PRIS, 170-845 and 170-241, are under development at that

location by Sas assigned to this squaa.

Regarding the air piracy and crime aboard aircraft

violations, it is noted all major airports are located within

Resident Agency territories and coverage at these locations

will be covered there.

TFIS and ITSP Matters

Supervisor GLENN A. HARTER

A major category on this desk is civil rights

matters but inasmuch as this classification does not lend

itself to the development of informants it will not be

covered in this write-up.

In TFIS matters the following agents have been

assigned these cases and have been instructea to develop

informants in this fielä: SAS I. STEPHEN OSBORN, DAVID C.

Selective Service matters and have been instructed to develop

informants that will be of assistance in this classification.

It is also pointed out that this desk has numerous

subjects that fall in the radical left ard Black militant

category. any cime

chest suujecis, when anücrvished, appear

to be cooperative in any degree their names and addresses

are furnished to the appropriate desk for consideration as

in the legalized cardrooms and night clubs in this area.

Coverage in the counties of Mendocino and Lake is

limited to the close personal relationship with deputy

sheriffs that cover the remote areas of these counties, which

principal industries are logging and ranching.

There are

no principal targets for informant

development, such as shipping companies, railroads, airports,

or large industries.

Coverage has been established in

Supervisors in this office are not required to approve

either closing or opening memoranda on informant files.

No record is keut of productivity ofinformants by

it is a questionable matter it is discussed with the

agent handling the PCI on an individual basis and a

agent is in a better position to make the judgement as

to the potential of this particular PCI.

All agents in the San Francisco Division are aware of

the racial and ghetto informant program through

If an agent has a case that he feels

dictate a memorandum setting forth specifically that

IT& INFORMATION CONTAINED

DATE 112010L BY SP2 ALMI716

All criminal informant (CI) files and a representative

number of potential criminal informant (PCI) files were reviewea

during this inspection.

disclosing the rating

, ornapa the afforded in each t11e

Following review, a memorandum

afforded in each file has been forwarded

to you for inclusion in the respective file.

Your office is currently operating 145 CIs as

compared to 141 CIs being operated at the time of the last

inspection. There is also an increase in the number of PCIs

under development at this time to 271 as opposed to 250 under

development during the lust inspection.

These figures do not

include Iop Echelon informants

or targets for development

which are commented on separately under the Criminal Intelligence

Program. This represents a slight increase in the nunder of

CIs and

a more substantial

increase in the number of PCIs

under development.

However, there is a slight decrease in

two large metropolitan areas, namely, San Francisco and Oakland,

which though slight represents a static situation as to

• increasing coverage in these areas.

The Oakland Resident

Agency has also recorded a decrease in the number of PCIs

,under development.

In analyzing the coverage in the resident

agencies, it was noted that Monterey, Richmond and San Jose

have the same coverage from CIs as during the last inspection

although Monterey and San Jose have shown a substantial

increase in the number of PCIs being handled. PCIs under.

development in Salinas and San Rafael are down somewhat,

although this too in part is off-set by the increase

in

the

number of CIs being operated.

In view of the Bureau's

increased responsibilities, it is absolutely essential that

a strong criminal informant program be maintained and in

fact expanded if the Bureau is to meet these increased

responsibilities.

QUALITY

All of the CI files were reviewed auring this

inspection and the following ratings were given to the CIs

presently being operated by this office:

Because SE 3308-C furnishes

information principally as a result of his employment in

the U.S.

Army, Personnel Center, Oakland, California Army

Base, this informant should be discontinued as a CI and

converted to a Confidential Source. SF 2290-C was recently

reopened on the basis of having provided a service to

repartment of Justice attorneys and the Bureau but has furnished

no criminal information for an extended period of time and

had been in a closed status since 3/10/69.

This infornant

should also be discontinued

as a CI and considered

as a

Confidential Source.

You should appropriately advise the

Bureau that this action nas been taken.

The following informants have been rated Fair and

they should be given specific assignments for a period of

90 days in an attempt to improve their productivity. At

the end of that period of time you should advise the Bureau

of reasons for continuing them as informants or that they

..are being discontinued.

AGENT PARTICIPATION

You have indicated Special Agents JAMES ₽.

JALOY,

CARLTON H. 'WOLFARTH and GARY N. MAVITY have spent 50%'or

more of their time on criminal type investigative matters

during thepast year but do not currently have assigned a

qualified CI personally developed by them. Further comment

is being set forth later in this addendum concerning these

Agents.

PAYMENTS

A review of payments indicates that your office

paid an average of $1,473.98 a month to informants during

the period immediately preceding the last inspection.

FOr

the period immediately preceding this inspection, an average

of $1,643.10 was paid to informants each month.

A spot

check of payments made to CIs and PCIs indicated value was

being received for the money paid. You should insure that

your personnel are alert to

the use of monetary payments to

enlist the further cooperation of informents by compensating

them for expenses incurred in pursuit of information for

this Bureau and as compensation for their effort on the

Bureau's behalf.

You should continue to closely evaluate

informant payments to insure that value is received for money

paid.

•ACCOMPLISHMENTS

According to Bureau records your office shows

increases in 4 of the 8 statistical accomplishments

attributable to informants and it is noted that these

increases have occurred in matters concerned directly with FBI

investigations.

PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT

You have indicated a rather extensive involvement

of supervisory personnel in directing informant development to

those areas of responsibility coming within the scope of

their respective desks. Referring to Government reservations

and military installations, you indicated you do not

consider Government employees appropriate for development as

CIs as they are bound to furnish information as part of

their duties. Your attention is specifically directed to

NW 88608-Docid:32989633-Page-102

175.

---

## Page 103

5

Section 108, I-12, Volume 4, Manual of Instructions, which

states informants

should be developed on Government

reservations ana military installations when warranted. In

view of the large installations located within your territory,

it is suggested you identify particular areas of these

installations wherein informant coverage would be logical

productive and give consideration to pinpointing such areas

for development.

You have also indicated that Supervisors approve

payments to informants and in this way are also aware of the

productivity of the informant program. However, it is notec

that approval of payments provides a rather limited

assessment of the productivity of informants and points out

the need for a continuing evaluation of respective coverage.

Supervisors must constantly be alert to identify specific

areas in which informant coverage would be logical and

productive.

• OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

You should give consideration to the development

of informants on Government reservations and military

installations as suggested by the Manual of Instructions.

In a number of instances, it was noted there was

no follow up on incomplete information furnished by informants.

In such instances, the informant was not recontacted any

sooner than required by the 30 day contact rule, which would

indicate a lack of direction of the informant to further

than reguired, by

develop information of interest.

The need to give informants

direction to develop information to the point it can be

considered useful and valuable should be brought to the

attention of all appropriate investigative personnel.

There were few instances noted during review of

the CI files wherein FD-302's had been utilized in recoraing

informant information. It is recognized that much information

regarding fugitives and possible suspects does not require

NW 88608 Docld:32989633 Page 103

## Page 104

such recording but in view of the recent passage of Senate

Bill 30 which will

greatly expand the opportunity to utilize

informant information, you should make certain all personnel

• are aware of those instances in which informant information

should be recorded on an FD-302 and the proper method for 'so

recording it.

Numerous areas have been identified in your

territory as being the habitat of ethnic, ghetto and hippie

elements, many with a high incidence of crime. To provide

a better

over-all view of the coverage in San Francisco and

the heavily populated East Bay area and to facilitate a more

convenient, ready reference for the agents of your office to

this information, you should consider preparing a large wall

map of the San Francisco - East Bay area and placing It in a

central secure position in the office.

In addition to criminal

informants,

informants on the map with an appropriate locator rejerence

to an index showing the agent to whom the inrormant is

been found where we did not get value received from these

payments to informants.

We have achieved excellent statistics

from them as indicated by the fact that at the close of the

last fiscal year we were ahead in all eight categories of

informant accomplishments. This is our continuing goal and

we will make every effort to surpass these

accomplishments

in the coming months. The observations, instructions and

suggestions of the Inspector will be immediately complied

with

and this program

will continue to receive close super-

vision in

order to

get maximum results in connection with

our work.

GNM: j1

In the period of time I have

assigned to criminal work i have

handled a number of PCIs with a view

to the qualification of them as

approved Criminal Informants.

In the past year since I

last had an approved Criminal Informant I have handled

several PCIs including one who previously was the prime

factor in the apprehension of a Bureau fugitive wanted

for the murder of a police officer.

This PCI has since

furnished information of value which was relayed to the

local police in a burglary case. He has been given the

assignment to develop further information concerning local

suspects in the handling of stolen merchandise from this

and other burglaries.

In the past year I have been unable

to devote a great deal of time to the development of this

and other PCIs due to having been utilized as Relief

supervisor in the absence of the regular supervisor

because of the time necessary to prepare and preseni leciures

at police schools on legal matters.

I am aware of the importance of the

Criminal Iniormant Program and will continue efforts to

develop a qualified Criminal Intormant and expect to

qualify the above-mentioned PCI in the very near future.

SA CARLTON H. WOLFARTH:

10/28/70

CHW ¿ ok

I am extremely aware

of the need to

develop CIs and have had a total of

nine PCIs in San Francisco during the

time I have been in san Francisco.

I arrived in the San Francisco Division,

7/13/69, on transfer from the Chicago Division. It is to je noted

that I

developed CG 72150 In 1967. This Informant had either

worked for or was close to the top men of organized crime in Chicago,

Miami and Now Orleans. At one time, through a court order, this

Informant was wired with a microphone and tape recorder so

information could. be obtained in an Obstruction of Justice case.

I had at least one other informant while I was handling the

above informant, and handled both until leaving Chicago.

The potential of the four PCIs which I

opened on 8/24/70 and the one which I openod 10/19/70 appears

promising and it is anticipated that at least one will develop

into a CI in the near future.

My assignments in san francisco hava

been mainly ITSP - FBi Investigations which are complicated and

Involve reviewing records and interviews with banks, broksrage

house and other business officials. Ihad one excellent

opportunity to develop a good CI whenLLOUIs MARDER,, Las Vegas

furnished me on 2/27/70 and 3/2/70 the' original information which

led to the recovery of 5050,000 worth oi arco Thrift Certificates

at Las Vegas. MARDIRJas recently as 10/27/70, furnished me

valuable information.

He cannot be developed

into a CI because

he lIves in Las Vegas and 1s under Federal Indictment In Miami.

I am sorry that this delinquency on

my part happened. It is regretted and I will not let it happen

again.

CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM AND

INTERSTATE GAMBLING ACTIVITIES

PART A. GENERAL

1.

The commercial or lucrative type of criminal

activity in the San Francisco Division continues to be

predominantly confined to the areas as noted below.

Exhaustive and probative investigation and close liaison

with local state and Federal agencies to date has revealed no

evidence of an organized criminal group controlling these

activities iingan Francisco or Resident Agency territories.

Investigation

contacts with informants and other sources of

information have failed to reveal the existence of any

a tated to reven

organieed illegul gambling, loan sharking (Shvlocking),

• Labor racketeering or planned bankruptcy frauds.

A. Local bookmaking involving horse and

sport bets conducted by numerous local

independent bookmakers, some of whom

have established "lay-off" arrangements

among themselves.

B.

Prostitution activity primarily in the

section of San Francisco

involving out-of-town businessmen,

tourists, and servicemen with prostitutes,

most of whom are working for unorganized

negro "pimps".

c.

Narcotic activity and related crimes

usually involving thefts and frauds near

universities, military installations, and

"hippie" or Bohemian sections of cities

2.

are known to exist between all Resident Agencies and the

local law enforcement agencies in their territories.

NO

evidence of information has been made available to this

office to indicate that there is any corruption in law

enforcement in this division.

As the Bureau is well aware, Mayor JOSEPH LAWRENCE

ALIOTO was the Subject of anti-racketeering investigation

by this office several years ago, however, this matter has

been closed. ALIOTO prior to assuming the position of Mayor

of the city of San Francisco was a proninent and well known

attorney, particularly in the field of anti-trust matters.

He is known to have been the attorney for TONy LIMA, a former

He also represented a

number of other ICN figures and their associates.

....

Prior investigation revealed that the cousin of

ALIOTO's father, JOHN ALIOTO, was the former "Boss" of the

Milwaukee ICN Family. JOHN ALIOTO attended the inauguration

of Mayor ALIOTO at San Francisco in January 1968.

As a result of an article published in "Look"

..magazine, September 23, 1969, Linking ALIOTO with Many LCN

figures, ALIOTO filed a $12.5 million libel suit againsi

"Look" magazine and the authors of this article, RICHARD

•CARLSON and LANCE BRISSON.

721932

On Mãy 15, 1970, Federal Judge BRUCE THOMPSON

declared a mistrial in San Francisco on this suit in that

the jury was unable to agree on the key issue of whether

the asticle linking ALIOTO with the "Mafia" was published

with "malice and reckless disregard for the facts."

The

jurors told newsmen that the article was defamatory to

ALIOTO and that at least 50 per cent of the 27 points were

indeed untrue.

There was no agreement as to whether the

falsehoods and the article's general claim that ALIOTO was

"enmeshed in a web of alliances" with the "Mafia" represented

"malice and reckless disregard for the facts."

.U.S. Supreme

Court has ruled that such a finding is essential to a libel

judgment sought by a public official.

On August 5, 1970, RUDOLPH RAPALE, brother-in-law

of Mayor ALIOTO, filed a $.2 million libel suit against

"LOOk"

magazine and CARLSO and BRISSON.

This article re

ferred to a trip by PAPALE to Mexico during which PAPALE met

with FRANK BOMPENSIERO, "CAPO", of the Los Angeles Family of

the LCN residing in San Diego to discuss a lard selling

permit in Mexico for a company of which PAPALE was former

president.

On September 5, 1970, it was reported that retrial

of the ALLOTO s1z.5 million libel suit against "look" was

tentatively reset for May 3, 1971.

San Francisco top level informants currently being

handled consist of four members of the ICN and six: TE

informants in the gambling and related criminal fields. 9ur

ICN TE informants and ten PC target intormants report on ICN

activities of the San Francisco and San Jose Families as

well as ICh activities in other divisions. Our other TE

informants and our 36 PC target informants regularly report

on matters Involving booknaking, prostitution, pornography

and other criminal matters. JAs

an indication of the level

Family. These informants due to their positions and locations

have made it possible to obtain top level information necessary

to provide coverage for Items 1 and 2.

4.

Since last inspection excensive investigation as

well as informant coverage led to the first ITAR conviction

prosecutions ever in the San Francisco Division (see Item 7

below).

Investigation

in the case CARL EZEKIAL ECKSTIN,

I'VI, case developed a "shakedown" by ECKSTIN against local

bookmaker VICTOR ROMOLO.

This matter arose out of the failure

Of ROMOLO to

pay a bookmaking debt owed ECKSTIN. SALVATORE

VINCENT "BILI" BONANNO, JOSEPH BONANNO, JR., MAURICE PATRICE

HARTIGAN and MARTIN CHEIPETZ CARSON acting as agents for

EckstiN actempted to collect the 54,600 gambling debt and

during contacts with ROMOLO threatened him with physical harm

if he failed to pay the debt. This case is currently

under investigation with the matter being presented to

the Federal Grand Jusy at San Francisco for violacion

of Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 894, Extortionate Credit

Transaction

Statute.

It should be pointed out that "BILL" BONANNO

and JOSEPH BONANNO, JR. are the sons of JOSEPH BONANNo, SR.,

a "Commission" member of the ICH in the United States.

The aforementioned Subjects aze also involved

a separate ECT case involving the shakedown

this matter is

presently under investigation and will

be presented to the

Federal Grand Jury, San Francisco innediately upon completion

of Grand Jury action in the ECKSTIN ECT case.

Since last inspection investigation has continued

in regard to GUISEPPI CONFORTE, the reported Vice lord,

State of Nevada, who ror years

has headed up a major pros-

titution operation. Though extensive investigation and

the placement of SF 3239-C-IE and SF 3369-C,

this organization

has

been completely penetrated identifying his lieutenants

and

scope of operation.

As a result of the above, it has jeen

determined that CONFORIE's operation has spread to the State

of Hawaii being controlled there by one of his top lieutenants,

TOMMY SEALE. San Francisco has under preparation an affidavit

for a request of a Title 3 electronic

surreillance on the

phones utilized by this organization in Honolulu.

affidavit has been prepared with the assistance of Departmental

Attorney at San Francisco and who has discussed same with the

organized Crime section, Deparcment of Justice, who has advised

that upon completion of current investigation in Honolulu the

affidavit should be immediately submitted for approval.

As another example of the progress made in che

penetration of the racketeering operation since the last

inspection information was received that HARRY JOHN JOHNSON

and ALAN "SUITCASE" FIDLER,: two. Boston "hit men" received a

contract, reportedly by a printer, to travel to San Francisco

"straighten somebody out over. a union matter."

JOANSON,

a former resident of San Francisco, is Inown as

• found murderad in Poston and on his bogu were found the names

and telephone nuners ui vommoon and tianet. Througn these

efforis the attempt by JOHNSON and FIDLER to perform the

conditions of the contract were thwarted. In addition, this

matter

is being considered by Departmental Attorney for

possible Federal Grand Jury presentation.

Another example of progress made in the penetration

• in the field of intelligence and organized crime in this area

resulted when through information furnished by top echelon

informants reveaing the presence of ALATADENO JAMES FRATIANNO

• residing in the San Francisco territory. through investigation

and surveillances conducted FRATIANNO was subsequently contacted

and was developed as a top echelon target of this division.

Frequent contacts were conducted with FRATIANNO and extensive

cooperation was obtained from him concerning organized crime

FRATIANNO was identified as a member of the Los Angeles Family

of the LCN and during August, 1970 was indicted by Federal

Grand Jury convening in San Francisco for two counts of

violation of Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 894, ECT. Although

presently incarcerated FRATIANNO

is being contacted periodically

as a target in

an effort to continue development of his

cooperation.

Increase in penetration of racketeering operations

2689-C-TE reported that JAMES FRATIANNO, a member

of the Los Angeles ICN Family had moved into the San Francisco

area where he remained until August when he commenced serving

a prison sentence executed by the State of California.

During October, 1969, information was received

indicating that JERRY LISNER, major bookmaker, Los Angeles,

California was in contact with JOHN CASTELLI, bookmaker,

Oakland, Calitornia.

The purpose of this contact was for

LISNER to establish a base of operation, particularly book-

making, for his criminal activities in the San Francisco

area.

Investigation subsequently established that LISNER

and others commenced a bookmaking operation in Alameda and

Contra Costa Counties, East Bay Area, using as its front

A-1 TV Service, Oakland, which is owned by JOHN CASTELLI.

Following extensive investigation in cooperation with the

Oakland Police Department, no evidence was developed to

indicate any violation of Federal statutes. On November 22,

1969, the Oakland and Berkeley, California Police Departments

simultaneously arrested SALVATORE J. BERNICE, JOHN TRAPPS and

two other associates who were engaged in LISNER's bookmaking

PART B: GAMBLING MATTERS

=.

1.

In the San Francisco Division there appears

to be two gambling operators that lead all others in terms

of handle, volume,

coverage, number of accounts, and

number of employees.

These operators are CARL EZEKIAL,

ECKSTEIN and CHARLES FRANCIS LEAHY, JR., both of whom are

based in San Francisco.

While they both handle substantial

individual accounts, ECKSTEIN and LEAHY are primarily

associated with and rely on lessor local bookmakers for

"action."

CARL EZEKIAL ECKSTEIN, age 40 years, has been

engaged in gambling activities most of his adult life.

ECKSTEIN was formerly associated with TONY RUIZ and other

San Francisco bookmakers, but in the last year ECKSTEIN

has set up his own independent operation.

arrested on several occasions on charges of bookmaking but

has never been convicted of this violation. In 1965 ECKSTEIN

was convicted for failure to pay Federal wagering tax which

conviction was subsequently overturned.

Details regarding

his current operation are set forth below in Paragraph 3.

CHARLES FRANCIS LEAHY, JR.,

a native San Franciscan,

in his middle 40's, has been engaged in bookmaking activities

throughout his adult life.

He was convicted in United

States District Court, San Francisco, in 1961 for arrest

on 9/28/60 for violation of Title 26, Section 7203, U.S.

. Code, failure to report and pay wagering tax, and was

sentenced to six months in jail and five years probation.

subsequent to his incarceration, LEAHY moved to Medford,

oregon.

He returned to the San

Francisco area in the Spring

of 1969 and resumed his bookmaking activities.

During his

absence from San Francisco, his ex-brother-in-law, KENNETH

JOSEPH ZAHND, reportedly handled his, LEAHY's, bookmaking

operation.

LEAHY waS reCently arrested by the San Francisco

Police Department on local bookmaking charges and is

currently awaiting trial.

2.

The types of gambling prevalent in the San

Francisco Division are primarily wagering on horse races

In addition, small numbers betting

with a weekly drawing take place usually in the Spanish-

speaking communities.

There are also legal and illagal

card games operating usually in low-income commercial

neighborhoods.

Gambling in the division is conducted by

individual operators who are independent of each other,

except for layoff purposes with respect to bookmaking and

there are no indications of hoodlum control over any of

these

activities.

3.

Concerning the extent of gambling in this

division; bookmakers ECKSTEIN and LEAHY, named in Paragraph

1 above, operate in the following manner.

Both are in

daily contact with their accounts located in the Bay area

which include other bookmakers fox layoff purposes, split

bookmakers, and numerous individual bettors.

Bets are placed with these operations generally

at locations to which the general public has access, such

as bars, restaurants, coffee shops, and other small

shops.

The "action" received at these business locations are in

turn called in to a phone spot operated by a bookmaker who

has a gambling relationship with the operator of the

business.

ECKSTEIN normally operates with six employees,

including two phone men, a bookkeeper, a pay & collect man,

and two runners. In addition, he utilizes several split

bookmakers as employees.

The

split bookmakers-involved in the ECKSTEIN bookmaking

operations are THEODORE CHALMIS, ALBERT DiGERONIMO, ELBERT

HEDRICK, MANNY PRONGOS, and ALBERT CARISON.

ECKSTEIN's

monthly handle based on informant data, evidence seized by

the San Francisco Police Department during recent bookmaking

raids,

and interviews of bettors is estimated to be approxi-

mately $50,000 for horse bets.

His sports "action" varies

with the season of the year and bettor interests in particu-

lar sporting events; however, ECKSTEIN's handle for sports

action is estimated to be $40,000 per month.

NW 88608 Docld:32989633 Page 126

---

## Page 127

15 -

LEAHY's operation normally consists of a separate

phone man for horse racing action and sports bets, at least

two pay & collect men, and several runners operating in the

vicinity of three

San

Francisco bars in which LEAHY

reportedly has a hidden interest.

The persons believed

to be associated with LEAHY as bookmakers and/or split

bookmakers are ROBERT MAGIDSON, ATTILIO SPAGNUOLA, VICTOR

FORNER, KENNETH ZAHND, MORRIS COOPER, and. ALBERT CARLSON.

With respect to LEAHY's handle it is to be notea

that a review of records seized at the time of his arrest

or 8/4/70 discloses a daily handle for horse action in the

approximate amount of $2,000 or approximately $50,000 per

month.

Data regarding LEAHY's sports handle is incomplete

but it is estimated that this handle is comparable to that

Of ECKSTEIN.

: *

Based on a review of available gambling records

seized by local authorities on lessor local bookmakers,

it is estimated that they have a monthly handle of approxi-

mately $25,000 each.

Investigation, including contacts

with informants and local authorities, indicates there are

approximately 20-30 lessor bookmakers operating in the

San Francisco Division on any given day.

Accordingly, it

would

appear that the monthly handle for the San Francisco

Division is in the approximate amount of one million dollars.

4. Sports line is formed by local bookmakers who

receive an early opinion

line from sports services located

in Los Angeles, California, operated either by GERALD

KILLGORE,

DOMINICK "SONNY"

DeFAICO, Or FRANK MILANO.

Upon receipt of this line information, the local bookmaker

will make his own adjustments, if necessary, to suit his

particular situation.

In addition, the local major news-

papers in this division publish line information on a daily

basis prior to a particular sporting event.

Early race results are currently being furnished

to local bookmakers by JERI GORDON MATZA who openly operates

a sports service at 225 Kearny Street, San Francisco.

Investigation has determined that MariA receives race

results by calling either California Turf, Los Angeles,

a horse race results business operated by FRANK MILANO,

or J & K Sports Journal, North Hollywood, California,

operated by GERALd KILlGORE.

Since the last inspection, the san Francisco

Office has developed SF 2661-C-IS, [ro is a key operator

within the ECKSTEIN bookmaking organization.

SE 3036-PC,

who was targeted at time of last inspection, has been

developed to the point where he furnishes detailed

information on a weekly basis regarding the LEAHY bookmak-

ing organization. This target is a split bookmaker handling

sports

"action" for

•the LEAHy organizatiou.

AS rESÜlt

of information furnished by SF 3036-PC and SF 3237-C-TE,

LEAHY was arrested by the San Francisco Police Department

on 8/4/70 on charges of bookmaking and convict in possession

of a weapon.

SF 3090-PC was targeted at the time of the last

inspection; however, during the past several months, he

has furnished extensive information regarding several

large bookmaking operations.

SF 3387-C was developed since the last inspection

and was responsible for the initial information and identifi-

cation of a major bookmaking operation in the East Bay area,

including Oakland, California, and Naval Air Station,

Alameda, California.

The informant"s information led to

The following comments

are based on a review of

information of pending

files and interviews

with appropriate personnel:

LA COSA NOSTRA (ICN)

Investigation by your office revealed the existence

of two ICN "families" within your territory. Membership

within these "families" total 64 individuals. Your

investigation revealed neither "family" is considered to be

very strong and has little or

no illegal operations being

conducted on a day to day basis.

One "family" is centered in the San Francisco area

and has for the vasi fen juärs bach houdca by James Lanza,

an attendee at the Apalachin meeting in 1957.

Lanza has

recently stepped down as boss of the

San Francisco

and has been replaced by Toni Lima.

"family"

Your investigation

reveals that Lima's leadership has not been approved by

the "commission." You should follow this matter closely

so you will be in a position to know all activities relating

'to this change in position.

The second "family" is centered in the San Jose area

•and is headed by boss Joe Cerrito.

This "family" exhibits

little enthusiasm for illegal operations.

You should closely

follow the activities of members of this "family" to insure

that any illegal operations are immediately known to your

office.

Organized Crime

Although prostitution, gambling and narcotic activities

exist within your division, there is no indication from your

investigations that these operations are controlled by either

the ICN or other organized groups.

Your investigations

should be continually pursued with vigor in order that your

office will be aware

of any illegal operations within your

division.

This

is

particularly true in regard to gambling

activities in view of the recent passage of Senate Bill 30.

It is noted your office has penetrated the ICN

"families" in both San Jose and San Francisco through the

development of member informants. This is very noteworthy

and you are encouraged to make certain that your member

informants are utilized to the best advantage of the Bureau.

Also, it is noteworthy that you have increased your TE

coverage from 7 to 10 since the last inspection.

SF 3058-C-TE (San Francisco file 137-4670; Bureau

'file 137-17455) was rated fair because of a lack of productivity.

You should follow instructions issued in Bureau letter dated

July 14, 1970 and if this informant is unproductive for four

months subsequent

to the receipt of that letter the

informant

should be closed.

Although SF

2745-C-TE (San Francisco file 137-3456;

Bureau file 137-11174) was rated good, his progress should

be closely followed. Although he is noted to be a member

informant the file indicates he is very sick with varicose

veins

and is very old. The majority of information furnished

by this source has been of a nature of past activities and

little present information is being furnished by him. you

should endeavor to have him furnish more productive recent

informant or give consideration to concentrate on a more

productive source.

The file indicates this source sold his

learned by your office on August 13, 1970. The file also

indicates this TE left the New York

a victim of a shylock loan.

In view of this information

you should closely follow this informant's activities and

be circumspect in dealing with the informant to prevent

any possible embarrassing situation from arising.

target was contacted he was rated fair.

SF 2630-PC (San Francisco File 137-2967; Bureau file

137-9023) was rated fair.

By letter dated December 10, 1968

the Bureau advised that this target was over two years old

and that you should consider deleting within four months if

he was unproductive. This informant was also rated fair

during the last inspection because of lack of productivity.

The only reason this informant is being classified fair,

instead of poor is because information contained in your

letter to the Bureau dated September 18, 1970 wherein your

informant reported information was furnished by a TE to

the effect that the present

"boss" of the San Francisco

ICN "family" had been discussing leadership of the San

Francisco LCN with the target.

You are instructed that

in the event he does not furnish valuable positive information

within 90 days he should be closed and a more suitable target

developed.

SF 3061-PC (San Francisco file 137-4768; Bureau file

137-17558) was also rated fair.

This target along with the

other two targets rated fair should be closely followed for

90 days and be given specific assignments during that period

of time. In the event they are unproductive they should be

closed.

SF 2582-PC (San Francisco file 157-z5õ, jureau file

In regard to your PCs, the following specific

During the , wo

this PC was rated Unsufficient

Data to Rate. On November 20, 1969 you advised that an

interview of this PC was being held in abeyance pending an

investigation by the Oakland, California Police Department.

The file indicates that that investigation was completed on

August 6, 1970 with your target paying a $125 fine.

On

August 19, 1970 you advised that interview of the target

that contact with the target is being delayed until a more

logical area of vulnerability is developed.

sufficient time has elapsed in order for your office to

develop background information so that an interview of

i . these targets

can be conducted. You should without further

delay interview these targets to determine if they will be

cooperative and if not you should consider closing and finding

more suitable targets for development.

Information you furnished indicates there are ten

Sas who are working either exclusively or virtually exclusively

. on the CIP and IGA program who have not developed TEs.

Although all ten Agents have PCs their progress

closely followed to insure their participation in the

development of TEs. In this regard you may desire to

reiterate provisions of the Manual of Instructions to the

Agents on the program concerning the qualifications of TE

informants.

All Agents are to be reminded that in dealing with

informants, they are to be particularly alert and not

leave themselves open for criticism or false accusations.

The importance of having an alternate contacting Agent

or another Agent along during the course of certain,

interviews is advisable in case any compromising situation

is attempted.

With the recent enactment of Senate Bill 30 you

should concentrate on increasing your informant coverage in

the areas covered by this legislation. Also in regard to

the passage of Senate Bill 30 dealing

with gambling, which

you are aware does not now require interstate activity, you

should not overlook

the utilization of your racial informants

to furnish information to your office concerning gambling

activities.

Other divisions of the Bureau have been

particularly successful in coordinating the information

from racial informants in to the CIP and IGA programs.

Immediately prior to the last inspection, by letter

May 29, 1970 captioned "CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM,

ASSIGNMENT OF ADDITIONAL MANPOWER," you advised the Bureau

of the addition of ten Agents to be assigned exclusively:

:to this program.

Your success since that time has been

noted by

• the addition of one conviction in 1970 vs. 1969.

Also you have added three tEs to the program and seven

This is to your credit and you are encouraged

to continue this favorable trend.

However, the collection

of intelligence information, though very important, is only

one phase of this program.

The other phase of the program

which must receive close supervision and personal attention

is the obtaining of convictions to fulfill the Bureau's

responsiblity toward statistical accomplishments.

In regard to statistical accomplishments, other

divisions of the Bureau have been very successful in

the utilization of Title 3. The utilization of Title 3

requires extensive use of manpuwer anù it the titla 3 you

are

presently awaiting upproval is approved you should

judiciously use manpower in the operation of the Title

instalLation.

In regard to the utilization of manpower, it is

imperative that all Agents assigned to this program show

the necessary zeal to accomplish the desired results of

intelligence information and statistical accomplishments.

In the event any Agents assigned to the program fail to

show the necessary enthusiasm consideration should be given

to the reassignment of those Agents to other squads.

There were four instances wherein you were instructed

during the last inspection to complete the pink sheet and

although 14 months have passed since last inspection these

pink sheets have not been completed.

While failure to

complete the pink sheet when instructed does not necessarily

indicate an Agent's

enthusiasm in working this program, it

does not show the desired

attitude. These four instances

are as follows:

A review of your 162 files indicates several instances

wherein Bureau instructions were not followed.

These Bureau

instructions were set torth in Bureau airtel dateu Aprii &,

1969, captioned "INTERSTATE GAMBLING ACTIVITY MATTERS."

This

is found in your file 162-00-21: Briefly, these instructions

stated that

Dissemination

Your office has been very successful in obtaining

favorable results in dissemination of information to local

law enforcement agencies concerning local violations

developed during the investigation. You are encouraged

to continue this favorable trend; however, you should

bear in mina that vioiacions that were strictly local in

nature previously may now be covered by the recent enactment

of Senate Bill 30.

Those which are determined to be Federal

violations, of course, should be prosecuted in Federal

court.

New Legislation

A review of your files indicates you have complied

with Bureau letter dated January Li, 1970; concerning the

,then proposed Senate Bill 30.

You should closely follow

guidelines formulated by the

Bureau in regard to this

new legislation in order that your office will be abreast

of the latest information so that the Bureau's responsibilities

in the organized crime field can be fulfilled.

Observations and Instructions

• (1) Provisions of Title 3, the Extortionate Credit

Transaction statute

and of the Manual of Instructions

concerning the qualification of TEs should be reiterated

to all Agents on the program at squad conferences.

.. (2) You should stress to all Agents on the program

the necessity of developing quality TEs.

SELECTIVE SERVICE MATTERS

INSPECTOR ARYOID C. LARSON:

The following comments,

observations, recommendations

and instructions

are being made after an in-depth review. of

a representative number of your Selective Service Act matter

cases and administrative files along with conversations with

supervisory and Agent personnel and review of the answers to

questions in a separate yellow (4-M-5):

The San Francisco area is a

haven to draft dodgers and this undesirable situation will.

not be reversed until we make this area unattractive for

"bums, ""hippies," and members of white and black extremist

groups who come

to San Francisco in order to avoid the draft.

Several obstacles must be surmounted in order to reverse this

undesirable situation.

The indifferent attitude that the

juages have

displayed to date must be reversed towards a

tough handling of Selective Service Act violators.

Service Boards to insure that these violators are promptly

prosecuted in the courts.

Every technique available to the

Bureau should be used to

get the judges, United States

Attorney and public riled up about this ridiculous situation.

Aggravated violators should be put in jail.

There are 2,983 "hippie-type"

communes in the San Francisco Division comprising in excess

of 20,000 population. 1,050 of these communes are located in

the Berkeley and Oakland areas comprising in excess of:10,000

population and 43 communes are known to be violently oriented.

Your office has eight subjects who have committed Selective

Service Act violations that are members of white and black

extremist groups.

Every effort should be made to take these

individuals out ofcirculation by placing them in jail.

Information concerning their activities with extremist groups.

should be furnished to the probation officers so that they

can so inform the judges in their presentencing report. All

The former United States Attorney had

on his staff an assistant handling 25

cases who had never served in the Armed

Forces and was outwardly sympathetic

towards the Selective Service Act

violators.

The new United States Attorney

has a good attitude towards the prosecu-

tion of these violators, however, he has

not completely replaced

the staff of the

old United States Attorney.

A major portion of the Selective

Service Act violations in the San Francisco Division pertains

• to the inductees failing to step forwara to be sworn into

the Armed Forces, thereby refusing

induction.

The Armed

Forces Examining and Entrance Station located in Oaklana,

•California handles all inductions for Northern California

and part of Nevada and handles approximately five per cent

of all inductions in the United States.

Approximately 38 per cent of

all refusals for induction into the Armed Forces arise at

Oakland, according to the Department of the Army statistics..

Many registrants from all over the United States come to the

'San Francisco area for the specific purpose of having

their

local draft board changed to this area, and after meeting

refuse to step forward

of freedom due to the slow handling of these cases by the

Selective Service Board, United States Attorney's Office

and the courts. San Francisco has several cases where the

violations are over two years old in which no prosecutive

action has been taken.

NW 88608 Docld:32989633 Page 149

## Page 150

- 4

4-M-5

It is evident from the

backlog of cases awaiting trial (414), backlog of cases'

awaiting prosecutive action by the Federal Grand Jury

(749) and the fact that these violations are being re~

ceived by your office at the average rate of 175 cases

per month, that something must be done to get these

cases before the courts.

The most aggravated cases should

be singled out and tried first, particularly those indi-

viduals who are members of extremist groups. Experience

has shown that after several subjects have received rigia

sentences, and a widely publicized trial, that many subjects

enter guilty pleas hoping for lesser sentences by avoiding

the Government the expense of a trial.

It is recognized the San

Fxancisco Division has been most forcefully making every

effort to expedite the handling of these cases, particularly

through the judiciary.

Indications are that the relatively

newly appointed United States Attorney is sympathetic and

receptive to the problem

and is making an effort to diminish

the backlog of cases awaiting Grand Jury presentations, but

it is recognized once an indictment is returned, it is

then

up to the judiciary to proceed through the final step, to

which they have not been particularly receptive. They have

not responded enthusiastically to handling these matters in

Federal Court.

It is obvious the Federal

Judges in Northern California (San Francisco Division) have

resisted any and all pressures brought to bear upon them

concerning this problem.

In my analysis of this situation,

I have determined that the United States Attorney's Office,

personnel of the FBI, and Selective Service personnel have

all attempted to influence the Judges in handling these

matters more expeditiously to no avail. Furthermore, within

recent months there has been wide-spread nation-wide publicity

relative to their coadling and mininizing this particular

problem. This apparently

has had no effect upon them.

It

would, therefore, appear that the various Federal Judges

will not react to this problem unless some superior influential

individual or group can forcefully bring this matter to their

attention, particularly if such individual or group is one

which the federal Judges would respect. The obvious answer

is the Administrator of the Courts for the Federal Judicial

System in Washington, D.C. and/or Chief Justice of the Supreme

couxt, WARREN BURGER.

NW-88608_Docld:32989633-Page 150

## Page 151

4-M-5

You are, therefore, instructed

to suggest to the Bureau that the contents of the letterhead

memorandum setting forth this overall problem be brought to

the attention of the Attorney General with the further sug-

gestion that the Attorney General bring this matter to the

attention of the Administrator of the Courts of the Federal

Judicial System and/or Chief Justice BURGER for his analysis

and information, and the further suggestion he may desire to

communicate with the Chief Federal Juage in San Francisco

relative to these matters.

SAC, ASAC, Supervisory and

Agent personnel should take advantage of every opportunity

to personally discuss this aggravated situation with the

United States Attorney, Selective Service Board officials,

SAC contacts and other prominent individuals to get them

riled up about this ridiculous situation.

Insure that

continuous cluse liaison is maintained by supervisory and

Agent personnel with United States Attorney's Office and

various local draft board officials to insure that these

cases are promptly processed and prosecuted.

Your office in April, 1969

suggested to the former United States Attorney that arresting

several inductees on the spot might have a favorable effect

upon lowering the rate of refusals at the Oakland Induction

Center.

The only objection given by the former United States

Attorney was that the case of the registrant must be presented

to the Federal Grand Jury within two weeks after arrest.

Due

to your effective liaison, most of the "bottlenecks" have been

worked out between the Selective Service Board and United

States Attorney's Office in which these arrests can now be

effected.

You should be alert to members of extremist groups

who will

fail to step forward at the time of their induction

and appropriately arrange with the United States Attorney for

authority to arrest these individuals on the spot. You should

insure that such arrests are given adequate press coverage..

Such plans should be brought to the attention of the Bureau

for their consideration in making a national press release,

if warranted.

You must closely coordinate

Selective Service Act cases with Agents handling extremist

groups such as the Black Panther Party, Weatherman, SDS, etc.

These files should be cross-referenced

by appropriate

memoranda.

ending 9/30/70, you have recorded § conviciions.

The procedures followed by your office concerning

the immediate handling of subjects who refuse to step forward

at the Armed Forces Examining and Entrance Station, Oakland,

California, appear to save Agent time and Government expense

nonths elapse between the time the subject is Interviewed and

the time the United States Attorney makes his prosecutive

decision since he insists that the Selective Service file be

processed and forwarded to his office by the State Director of

the Selective Service Board.

You should have Headquarters

city Agents continue close liaison with Selective Service

Boards and the United States Attorney's Office to insure that

these cases receive expeditious processing and are presented to

the Federal Grand Jury at an early date.

ADMINISTRATIVE MEMORANDUM

Administrative Handling of Theft

From Interstate Shipment Cases in

the San Francisco Division

INSPECTOR

• ARNOLD C. LARSON: During the course of the

if.

inspection of the San Francisco

office

a review was made of 140 Theft From Interstate Shipnent

cases.

Instances were noted wherein Bureau Regulations

concerning the handling of these cases were not followed. Set

forth below are instances noted during this review:

In the following cases, it was noted the amount

involved appeared to be a minor amount and there appeared to

be no aggravating circumstances concerning these violations.

In some instances concerning the cases which originated at the

san Francisco Aitourt, it was noted the file indicated there

was a possibility of an individual at the airport being involvea

in the

theft.

However, it is felt it is not necessary

' to keep

open all the minor cases in order to determine which, if any,.

employees at the airport may be involved.

These cases where

minor amounts are involved are as follows:

SAC ROBERT E. GEBHARD!

The USA advised this office by

letter dated: 7/16/69 that the

FBI should no longer present minor theft cases to the USA's

office and that these cases should be dererrea to local

courts.

The office has followed the policy set down by the

USA and has utilized his guideline of $100 as a minor case.

In view of his policy, the office has not been receiving minor

theft cases, as the local business community has been made

aware of the policy of the USA and has

minor cases to the office.

Occasionally some minor case is received from

someone not aware of the policy of the USA's office in not

prosecuting cases having

In the

future when a complaint is received regarding a minor theft;

the case will be immediately presented to the USA and after

his declination, the office will advise the complainant and

ADDENDUM

INSPEcTOR Anyip C.

LARSON: In regard to your answer to this

write-up, the following is

pointed out

to you:

1. Your answer implies the inspector indicated that

all suitcase-type thefts are minor thefts.

This is completely

inaccurate as each case, whether it be a suitcase or otherwise,

has to be judged on the

merits of the individual case.

the review of 140 cases there was not one single instance

wherein the United States Attorney had been consulted to

determine if the case was a minor amount and he would not

entertain prosecution even if the subject were identified.

2.

Concerning the submissions of FD-302's to the

file, the following is a tabulation of cases over two months

old in which no FD-302 is in the file:

FILE NUMBER

Although the remainder of the 25 files pointed out to

you did not contain FD-302's and the files had not come

up on ticklers for your review, it is apparent with this

number of files without FD-302's the Agents are not receiving

adequate instructions in conferences concerning proper

preparing of FD-302's in TFIS cases.

3. Although it was pointed out to you

wherein;

NCIC entries on serial numbers had not come up for adminis-

trative review, it is apparent that several Agents on your

squad have not been properly instructed in the necessity

of immediately entering serial numbers into NCIC. It shoula

not be necessary for you to have to remind Agents on your

squad on a periodic file review of the necessity of entering

They should not wait an extended

period of time to enter these numbers in NCIC, but the serial

numbers should be entered immediately after they are obtained.

4. File 15-11981 was of a purely local nature and

should have

been worked out of the related Federal violation

case rather than open a separate TFIS case wherein no

Federal jurisdiction was indicated in the opening serial.

SUGGESTION MEMORANDUM

BOND DEFAULT MATTERS

INSPECTOR ARNOLD C. LARSON: AS of 10/1/70, the San Francisco

Office had 48

bond default

matters under investigation.

This volume of cases presents

a fertile field for increased convictions under the Bond

Default classification.

An in depth survey conducted by the Inspection

Division disclosed

that there has been a significant

increase

in cases received by the FBI for investigation

subsequent to the passage of the Bail Reform Act of 1966.

This Act liberalized bail and bond procedures in Federal

cases whereby subjects were to be considered for release

on their own personai recognizance or unsecurea appearance

bond

in contrast to previous procedures which

specific bond, creating an excellent opportunity for us

to achieve statistical

convictions to the number of cases investigated in bond

default matters is one of the highest of any violation

handled by the Bureau.

One of our offices,

namely San Diego, has been

responsible for the most significant portion of the Bureau's

convictions in bond default matters as a result of effective

liaison with the U.S. Attorney, who felt that an indictment

obtained under bond default was more easily proven than

the substantive offense.

When a subject is apprehended,

the sentence is, in part, influenced by the U. S. Attorney,

who informs the court the length of time the subject's

apprehension has been sought by the Bureau.

A number of

these cases have arisen through charges of

narcotics and

"smuggling of merchandise and

aliens across the border.

• Subjects were brought before

a magistrate, and rather

pleading guilty, subjects obtained a court appointed

than

attorney

and entered a not guilty plea.

They

were released

then on either personal recognizance or a minimum bond until

their scheduled

appearance. When the subject failed to

appear in court, a bench warrant was issued, San Diego opened

a case, and. usuadly within 30 days an indictment was secured

under

• bond default.

Although San Francisco is not a border office,

it is a great port of

entry, both by sea and air, and many

of the same type cases utilized by San Diego tor

obtaining

a bond default indictment should be available to San,

Francisco.

As you are aware, convictions are becoming more

difficult to obtain because of the court's interpretation

the law in many classifications. Bond default matters

present an excellent opportunity to increase your conviction

rate, therefore, it is suggested that through your liaison

with the U. S. Attorney, point out to him the possibilities

for an increase in

convictions under the Bond Default

Statute.

The necessity to establish effective liaison with

the U. S. Attorney in bond default matters was

set out in

SAC Letter 70-13 dated 3/17/70..

If an increase in cases and convictions is obtained

as a result of this suggestion Memorandum, advise

the

Bureau by routing slip, attention Inspection Division.

SUPERVISOR, MORRIS M. DE JEAN: Close liaison will continue to

Attorney's office and all avenues

of potential convictions will be

vigorously pursued to increase the statistical accomplishments

in the San Francisco Division.

instructs that at the beginning of an interview with

any

known Subject of a Bureau case the Subject be advised of the

name and official identify of the interviewing agent and the

nature of the inquiry.

The fact that the Subject was, so

advised is to be recorded in the opening paragraph of the

EXPLANATIONS REQUESTED:

SA MILLER is requested to explain his failure to

advise the Subject of his name and official identity and the

nature of the inquiry and to record on FD 302 that this was

done.

his failure to detect this delinquency at the time he

approved the report on 9/3/70.

Comments of SA ANDRESS and SAC requested.

SA RICHARD GUY MILLER: At the beginning of the interview at the

10/27/70 SN

Humboldt county Jail, Eureka, California,

I exhibited my FBI credentials to the

subject and

advised him of the nature of the inquiry. I

apparently inadvertently failed to record this in the opening

paragraph of the FD 302 and on review of this FD 302 I

inadvertently failed to note this had been omitted from the

FD 302.

Care will be exercised in the future to insure this

does not reoccur.

SA RICHARD E.

LUEBBEN: I was Relief Supervisor on Desk #6 in the

10/27/70

absence of the regular supervisor and due

to the exceptionally high volume of mail

handled by this desk I inadvertently failed to note the above

omission

from FD 302 of SA MILLER dated 9/1/70 when the report

was signed out by me. Every effort will be made in the future

to avoid a repitition of this delinquency.

SA RAYMOND MA. ANDRESS:

In reference to the report of SA RICHARD Eu:

10/27/70

MILLER signed out by SA LUEBBEN on 9/3/70,

SA LUEBBEN was one of the Relief Supervisors

during my extended sick leave during this period.

SA LUEBBEN is an

experienced.ReLleI suDenvisor and

supervises the desk in a very

efficient and commendable manner. Due to the exceptionally heavy

volume of mail during this time, he inadvertently overlooked the

omission in the FD 302 of SA MILLER. The importance of advising

Bureau subjects the identity of Agents and nature of interview wizz

be discussed with the Relief Supervisors periodically and will be

followed closely to insure this does not reoccur.

on 12/8/69, tO SA KENNETH W. SHERIS• Case 15 supervised

DY SA ROBERT D. ROBY.

Review of the file indicates the Subject together

with two other Navy deserters had lived in a hippie commune

in the San Jose area during August of 1969= Investigation has

determined that he has used narcotics and has associated with

hippie-type individuals until the present time.

During 8/70, investigation was conducted in San

Jose and investigation determined that one JOAN BAUER was

also residing in

a hippie fashion and was acquainted with the

Subject of this investigation as well as the other two Navy

deserters.

On 8/13/70, JOAN C. BAUER was interviewed at which

time she stated she

is employed at National Aeronautics

Space Agency (NASA), Ames Research Center, as a secretary

at Moffett Field, a Navy installation.

During the course

of this interview, she stated she was

living with a male

individual in a common-law relationship.

She had

formerly

considered herself a member of a "family" of hippies

including the Subject and

another Navy deserter.

At the

time of interview she advised that the members of this

hippie "family" received mail at her address and the reason

for maintaining the address

is to receive food stamps for

this hippie "family" living in a commune style. She stated

she occasionally picks up

their mail at her home and admitted

on occasion taking the mail to them when she visits the

"family".

This interview was conducted at Moffett Field.

The information concerning BAUER was orally disseminated

to the Security Officer, NASA, Ames Research Center, on

8/13/70.

the Manual of Rules and regulations, Pant 2,

• Section 5, Page 1, indicates that Bureau policy under

Executive Order 10450 is to furnish the Civil Service

Commission all pertinent identifiable,

derogatory non-

subversive information relative to employees of the Executive

Branch of the government.

This is normally accomplished by

including such information in letterhead memorandum form

and transmitting same to the Bureau for appropriate dissemination.

EXPLANATIONS REQUESTED

1. SA KENNETH W. SHEETS is requested to explain

2.

Supervisor ROBERT D. ROBY is requested to

explain why, in his over-all supervision of this case, he-did

not detect this error as set out

above.

Comments of SAC requested.

SA. SHEETS:

JOAN C. BAUER advised at the outset

of the interview on 8/13/70 that she

could consider herself a member of the communal "family",

however, this became a matter of interpretation during the

course of interview and eventually she denied she was a member

of the "family" or commune.

She admitted visiting people

connected with the commune and associating with them, even to

the extent of allowing some of these individuals to use her

address for the purpose of receiving mail and food stamps.

This matter was discussed at length

with Securitv Officer RALPH MAINES and JOHN VAN ETTEN, Head of

Security at NASA, Moffett Field, California. They made no

statement as to what action they intended to take.

I realize now that I should have

also prepared a

letterhead memorandum

. for dissemination to NASA

Headquarters in Washington, D.C. I regret not having done-so and

in the future will insure that such matters are promptly

disseminated.

EXPLANATIONS REQUESTED :

SA DOUGLAS R. AHLSTROM is requested to explain

why he failed to detect the lead

at Walnut Creek had not

been covered before the case was closed on 10/15/70.

Field Supervisor BRYON C. WHEELER is requested

to explain why he failed to assign

a lead to a Walnut Creek

insure that this investigation had been conducted before he

approved the closing of this case (San Francisco letter to

Los Angeles dated 10/15/70).

Comments of SAC requested.

SA DOUGLAS R, AuLstate the writer was of the

impression that the lead at Walnut Creek to identify a

telephone subscriber had been covered and reported at

the time the case

was

RuC'& on 10/15/70. The writer did

nọt have the file available as the RUC communication was

submitted from the Santa Rosa Residence Agency and was

therefore unable to make a thorough review of the file.

Steps will be taken to make certain this does not recur

in the future.

SUPERVISOR BRYON C. WHEELAR!

The lead to check

out a telephone number at Walnut Creek was

inadvertently

overlooked at the time the case was reopened and assigned

to SA AHLSTROM.

the case on 10/15/70, the fact that the Walnut Creek lead

had not been covered

was overlooked. Efforts will be made

to make certain this does not recur in the future.
