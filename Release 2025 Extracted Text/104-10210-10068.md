NOSENKO'S KGB CAREER

A. Introduction

During his 11 or 12 years' service in the KGB Secord Chief

Directorate, NOSENKO said, he rose from case officer to deputy

chief of a department and

from lieutenant to Lieutenant colonel

lor, as he has

stated more recently, only to the rank of captain).

An English speaker, he had specialized in operations against

American targets in the USSR as he steadily advanced to higher

positions in the U.S. Embassy Section of the Imerican Department

Ifrom entry on duty

with the KGB in 1952 or 1953 until 1955,

and from January

1960 to January 1962) and in the Tourist Depart-

ment (from, June 1955 to January

1960, and from January 1962 until

the defection).

His duties took him to England in 195% and 1958.

Cuba in 1960,

and Bulgaria in 1961 as well as to Switzerland in

1962 and

1964; also, NOSENKO made numerous trips

within the USSR

in connection with

operations, inspestions, ard conferences.

Commendations, twice accompanied by bonuses, were awarded to him

by the KGB Chairman in 1956, 1959, and

1961 and by the head of

the Second Chief Directorate in 1957 and 1958: he was one of

70 Second Chief Directorate officers awarded the Order uf the

'Red Star in 1962; and in the same year he received a madal for

completing ten years of "irreproachable service."*

Thus,

according to NOSENKO, his defection ended a promising career

marked by promotions, responsible positions, extensive travel,

and many honors.

NOSENKO has discussed a large number of KGB operations, in-

cluding some in which he had a personal role, either as a par-

ticipant or as a supervisor, and others conducted by other KGB

personnel in the First and

Second Chief Directorate about which

he learned through his professional and persoral contacts..

Those in which he played a personal role are covered in this

part of the paper.

All are included in Part VI.

The text of

the paper distinguishes the information from collateral sources

and investigations from the details which NOSENKO has provided

on the same topics.

NOSENKO has admitted recently, however, that he never got

any awards at all in the KGB.

Bo. Entry into the KGB

NOSENKO has provided a wide range of dates for his entry

on duty with the KGB and has offered disparate descriptions of

the circumstances and procedures involved in his becoming a

KGB staff officer.

His statements on these two topics are

presented under separate headings below.

1..

Date of irtry

A range of dates between early 1952 and 2 April 1953 has

been given by NOSENKO as the time

when he entered on duty with

the KGB, bit he has been most consistent in placing his entry

in the month of March 1953,*

in

summary, he has said the

beginning of 1952 (statenent of 31 January

1964), May 1952 with

no day (statement of February 1964), 5 or

7 September 1952

(statement of 6 April 1964): March 1953 with no day (statements

of 9 Jure 196-(statement of 8 April 1964),

24 ipril 1966 and 27 October 1966),

12 or 15 or

17 March 1953

13 or 15 March 1953

(statement of 26 July 19651, and 2 April 1953 (statement of

17 April 1966).

When

iast questioned about this subject, or

27 October 1966, NOSENKO acknowledged that he had lied when he

had earlier reported his entry as occurring in 1952.

His state-

ments about the entry date are arranged in chronological order

below.

9 June 1962 (first CIA meeting with NOSENKO) : "In the

beginning of 1953 I came to Moscon Lfrom duty with the GRU in

Primorsk/.

This was 1953, In the beginning.

in January.

Well,

I came on leave to Moscow.

I was staying

at my father's dacha

there...

I was then in the Navy GRU.

So I came to Moscow on

leave

and, while I was home_near Moscow at my father's dacha,

/General Bogdan Zakharovich/ KOBULOV" dropped in on us.

A con-

versation simply began. He said: 'What are you doing?'

I said:

'I'm working in GRU.

I worked ir. the Far East and now I'm work-

ing in the Baltic.

I came here on leave.'

KOBULOV said: 'How

do you like the work?:

I replied:

'Well, speaking horestly. I

don't like the work.' 'Well, ' he

said,

with

'You better come to work

US a

Where do you want to go?

Into Intelligence or counter-

intelligence?'...

I did not want to go into intelligence.

Several of NOSENKO's remarks about his date of entry into

the KGB were made during CIA questioning about how and

when he first learned of the KGB agent 'ANDREY"; the lead

to

"ANDREY" was one of the two pieces of information which

NOSENKO offered to sell when he approached CIA in 1962

(see Part II.B.); the "ANDREY case is discussed at

greater length in Part VI.D.3.b.

** Other sources have reported that KOBULOV was expelled

from the State Security apparatus in 1946 and that he did

not return to a position of authority until a few days

after Lavrentiy BERIYA became MGB-MVD. Minister on 9 or

10 March 1953.

As of 1952, KOBULOV was working in East

Germany for both Wismut A.G., a uranium ore-mining con-

cern.

the Soviet contingent to the Allied Control

Commission.

KOBULOV was arrested at the same time as

BERIYA, along with others in the KGB.

See Part V.B.2.

for further references to KOBULOV.

After this, let them go into positive intelligence.

31 January 1964: Yurly Ivanovich GiK was reassigned from

the KGB Second Chief Directorate "in something like 1952,"

"exactly just about the time when I came

from

He was already gone by that time."*

February 1964: After his defection on 4 February 1964,

NOSENKO prepared an official statement about his biography.

He said that he had entered the KGB in 1952. and he shifted

the dates of most of the events during the 1945-1955 perica one

year backwards

from the version given in 1962. This was dis-

cussed with NOSENKO, and he repeated the new dates; he then

studied and approved an official statement on his biography

(for the Intelligence Community) which contained the new dates,

including his claim that he entered on duty with the KGB in

about May 1952.

6 April 1964:

Confronted with the above inconsistencies,

NOSENKO said that he returned to Moscow in August 1952 and during

the same month had a conversation with KGB persornel about getting

The interview continued with the following dialogue:

Question: You came (to Moscow) in January?

NOSENKO:

Yo, it wasn't January, it was the second part o1

refore that I was in the GRu..

Maybe - if I tell you 7 - 7 September - maybe

it was 5, I don't know.

Question:

...What date did you enter on duty with KGB?

NOSENKO:

I don'* remember.

Question:

Early September 1952?

NOSENKO:

Early September 1952,

This would place the entry date some time at the beginning

8 April 1964:

The interrogator pointed out to NOSENKO that

he had on different occasions dated his entry

into the KGB as

January 1952, March 1953, and in September 1952. The questioning

continued:

Question: Which is the truth?

And then,

I did not want to correct it.

And the mistake I made was about my work

accepted me right away. STALIN was still not

dead and I was already accepted.

March 1953,

about the 15th, about 15 March 1953.

26 July 1965: "At the end of 1952 I came to Moscow from

17 Apr1l 1966 (letter to CIA case

"From August

Intelligence of the 4th Fleet in, Sovetsk, where I received the

rank of lieutenant of the Administrative

From 2 April

1953 until 4 February 1964 I worked in the Second Chief Direc-

torate of the MGB-KGB."

24 April 1966 (signed autobiographical statement): "In

SAVITSKIY called me at home and told me to come to see KOBU-

LOV... I worked in the First Section, First LAmerican/ Depart-

ment from the middle of March 1953 until July 1955."

1925

27 October 1966: NOSENKO reaffirmed that he entered the

KGB in mid-March 1953. He said that he had lied when he earlier

said that he had joined the KGB in 1952, and that he knew he was

lying at the times he made these statements.

Asked why he had

sense.

NOSENKO then went on

to explain that because he was only an average student and

because he was a heavy drinker, he had been found unsuitable

Since. April 1966, NOSENKO has said he joined the GRU 1n

1951, a year later.

by the KGB entry commission when he first applied in 1950.

Therefore, NOSENKO continued, he had been trying to conceal

this fact

from CIA by moving events back a year, for he thought

CIA would not have believed him if he reportea that he was

first rejected by the KGB and was later accepted.

2. Circumstances and Procedures of Entry

Although NOSENKO has consistently associated his entry into

the KGB with his discussions with General KOBULOV, * he has been

inconsistent concerning the content of their conversation, when

it occurred,

its relationship ir. time to other events (see

Part IV. 8.), and where it took place,

at his father's dacha or

at KOBULOV's dacha.

Also, whereas NOSENKO said in 1962 that

there were virtually no administrative formalities prerequisite

to his entry, he recalled in 1964 that he had had conversations

with various KGB personnel officers and (at home) had completed

a KCB questionnaire and a biographic form.

NOSENKO was question-

ed at length on these points during 1964 and 1965.

As a resilt,

he provided lengthy descriptions of his various interviews at

KGB Headquarters and of the questionnaire and other documents ne

completed.

In April 1966, however, NOSENKO reverted to his

original statement of 1962: There were no interviews with kGB

personnel officers, and he implied that he had

filled

out no

official forms.

His various statements are presented in chrono-

logical order below.

9 June 1962:

"KOBULOV was at our dacha.

Well, he is a great

friend of my father.

He was First Deputy to BERIXA, and my

father was Minister of the Shipbuilding Industry... A conversa-

tion simply began.

He said: 'What are you doing?'

I said:

'I"m

working in CRU.

I worked in the far East and row I'm working

on the Baltic.

I came here on leave.'

KOBULOV said: 'How do

you like the work?'

I replied:

*Well, speaking honestly, I

don't like the work.'

'Well,' he said,

"You better come to work

with us.

Where do you want to go? Into intelligence or counter-

intelligence?'...

I did not want to go into intelligence. I

consider that only people who have seven, even ten years'

eX-

perierce in counterintelligence work should be sent to intelli-

gence.

After this,

let them go into positive intelligence.

Then

asked me where I wanted to work, I answered:

'It is better, of

course, to go into counterintelligence.'

'Good.

was simple conversation.

He said:

NOSENKO was asked whether he completed any forms

This was in March...

Just as soon as STALIN died,

KOBULOV came back from Germany immediately.

I

minutes.

I waited there almost two hours.

The assistant came

out a few times and told me that Bogdan Zakharovich is very,

very busy, but that he would give me an escort.

Some senior

lieutenant came up to me and told me to follow him..:

We went

up to the sixth floor of the old building. I remember: it as

said: nell; hello;

with him, I'll take him along with me and show him around. '

He took me and talked to me for a while and then told me to

report...

Either the 12th or the 17th. I don't remember."

15 April 1964:

NOSENKO again described the KGB question-

naire and autobiographic forms he had filled out at home and

recalled that he had also signed a secrecy agreement in the

personnel office.

He also remembered that he had made several

additional phone calls to the KGS personnel office and described

his second visit there to talk to ROZiENKO:

"At the end of

February I was told again to stop in the Pass Office and pick up

a pass and

go to the same floor,

but another room.

They told me

I would have to talk to ROTHENKO today.

He was a Chief of

Section, of the Personnel Section.

So we had a talk.

'Tell me about yourself:'

he just wanted to look me over. And after that they said: 'All

right, we have not gotten all your documents yet from your

military/ district.

So wait.'"

26 April 1965: NOSENKO recounted his conversation with

KOBULOV, saying that it took piace at KOBULOV's dacha in Usov,

where he and his parents were visiting in January 1953.

NOSENKO

continued:

"I was called at my family's dacha

in February.

They said it was State Security calling and that I was to

report.

I did this on the next day.

came down, and I gave him the forms and photographs of myself.

They said they would call me.

March.

January was leave.

In February and March I was at GRU

Personnel's disposal."

After STALIN'S funeral NOSENKO was

sumoned to KOBULOV's office.

His assistant, SAVITSKIY, told

NOSENKO to wait.

After more than an hour had passed, SAVITSKIY

sent him to SHUBNYAKOV's office. There he learred that he would

be assigned to the U.S. Embassy Section and was introduced to

the Chief of the American Department, GORBATENKO.

The official

order appointing NOSENKO was issued the same day, the 13th or

15th of March 1953.

24 April 1966 (signed autobiographical statement: Again

NOSENKO said that he had spoken with KOBULOV at the KOBULOV

dacha and set the date at 1 January 1953.

The document con-

tinued as follows:

"I saw KOBULOV for the second

on the day of STALIN's funeral in my father's office in the

Ministry of Shipbuilding ir. March 1953. 'I had come from the

sanitorium to Moscow and dropped in to see my father at work..

In his office I ran into KOBULOV as they were gathering to go

to the Dom Sovuzov for the funeral.

KOBULOV said he would

concern hinself with the question of my entry into the KGB.

The same day I returned to the sanitorium, and several days

later, having completed my treatment, I returned to Moscow.

In the middle of March, KOBULOV's assistant, Colonel SAVITSKIY,

called me at heme and told me to come see KOBULOV. KOBULOV

didn't see me ard SAVITSKIY directed me to the Deputy Chief

of the Second Chief Directorate, Colonel SHUENYAKOV. ••

SHUBNYAKOV told me that an order had been signed appoirting

me a case officer in the First Section of the First Depart-

ment, Second Chief Directorate.

SHUBNYAKOV called the Chief

of the First Department,

Lieutenant. Colonel GORBATENKO, and

introduced me.

Then I went to the First Department and was

introduced to the Deputy Chief of the First Department and the

Chief of the First Section, KOZLOV.

KOZLOV said I woüld take

over the cases of Senior Case Officer, Captain Anatoly/

TORMOZOV and

suggested that I begin work the same day.

I was

accepted for work in the MVD in precisely this way.

It is

necessary to note that none of the workers of the MVD Personnel

On the day of his acceptance into the KGß, NOSENKO was

taken directly to the offices of the u.s.

Embassy Section.

There he met the section chief, V.A. KOZLOV, who told NOSENKO

that he would take over the

the departing case officer,

Captain Anatoliy TORMUZOV, in operations against American cor-

respondents in Moscow.

a. KGB Files on SHAPIRO, GILMORE, SALISBURY and WHITNEY

NOSENKO reported for work the following day, accord-

ing to statements made on 8 April 1961, he found a desk in Room

"There were three other guys sitting

running traces, and at the same time I was reading. the files

I think there were seven files in all, and I

NOSENKO listed these files as those on

Henry SHAPIRO, Eddy GILMORE (as well as one ch GILMORE's wife

SEREBRYAKOVA and her sister CHERNYSHEVA) , Harrison SALISBURY

During the 1962 meetings with 'CIA, NOSENKO identified

SHAPIRO as an "old agent of ours." He

said that WHITNEY "worked

for us while he was in Moscow and gave us some material, but he

refused to work for us when he left the country and would not

contact us in the United States."

GILMORE, NOSENKO said, was an

active recruitment target in 1953 and 1954, but NOSENKO did not

Likewise, he did not know the

status of SALISBURY as of 1953.

NOSENKO stressed that the files he was given to read during

the early period of his KGB service were developrental files

The developmental files were less sensitive,

(delo formulyar) rather than the operational files of the agents.

and from them

would never be able to figure out whether he lthe subject of

the filel is an agent or not."

NOSENKO explained that, once a

person becomes an agent, another file is set up, and these agent

NOSENKO made clear that he was not the case officer responsi-

ble for the more important correspondents:

"KOZLOV himself

was working with them, the chief of the section himself--with

SHAPIRO, with SHAPIRO's wife.

I also know that KOZLOV was

working with WHITNEY and with (Andrew J.) STEIGER...

each of these persons there was an operational file which I

did not see.".

According to NOSENKO, he was in no way involved

with STEIGER and Edmund STEVENS,

both of whom were American

correspondents recruited as agents by the KGB.

files were held by the chief of the section, KOZLOV. NOSENKO

statod that he read the files on these seven persens "slowly

and made some extracts for myself in my personal log--such things

as notations of their dates of arrival, things I could not remel

ber. ".

He was also given the files on the agents surrounding

these correspondents, their drivers, maids, and cooks.

b. Agonts Reporting on Correspondents

NOSENKO said he was responsible for handling the agents who

were roporting on SHAPIRO, WHITNEY, SALISBURY

and the GILMORES

and met with

them regularly to learn whether "anything was new,

who did SHAPIRO meet, what might be interesting in his behavior,

what might be suspicious in his behavior, who he is contacting,

etc."

He then reported to KOZLOV and would sometimes prepare a

writton report of his conversations with

the agents.

describe these meetings, NOSENKO replied:

"Let us

case of SHAPIRO. I would meet drivers about three times a monti

or evan two times.

At the meeting I would ask the driver what

was new in SliAPIP!'s behavior since our last meeting, whether

• SHAPIRO had suspicious contacts with

icreigners, about his meet-

ings with Russians, were they conducted openly or, perhaps, was

SHAPIRO walking behind the person he met. And then the man

lagent) would begin his report.

Of course, if he spots anything

suspicious he calls immediately,

and I would see him the next

nomina.

Otherwise, I would tell him at the meeting that I

would see him again

in avout ten days or in two weers, but if

there was something interesting he should call immediately.

It was the same with the maid and the cook.

Upon returning to

the office I would have to report to KUZLOV about my meetings,

either orally or in writing.

If, for example, (V.M.) KOVSHUK

(also of the U.S. Embassy Section) had a meeting with his agents,

he too had to report immediately to KOZLOV or as soon as conveni-

ent to both.

If the meetings were taking place late in the day

and lasted until midnight or later and there were no written

materials submitted at

the meeting, I could go home and then re-

port the next morning."

KOZLOV accompanied NOSENKO to meetings with the various

agents surrounding the correspondents.

"At first he was teach-

ing me.

Then he would go in cases when something interesting

would begin to develop, even when it hadn't yet begun to develop

but when

there may have been a hint in a case of some other case

officer."

NOSENKO's agent network consisted mainly of domestic and

clerical personnel in contact with the correspondents and their

families.

Asked to describe them, he said on 15 April 1964:

"My first agent was a woman agent, a cook, who was working at

GILMORE's place.

She also worked

at the Associated Press later.

Her codename was 'AGLODINA', a funny one" 'SERGEY'.

My second agent was

a Chauffeur whose codename, I think, was

I think he

was driving WHITNEY.

Then I also had SHAPIRO's chauffeur, a

funny little fellow.

In other words,

charwomen, chauffeurs,

this was my agentura lagent network]." Although NOSENKO was:

able to give a breakdown of this network in terms of the number

and type of agents targetted against particular individuals, he

had forgotten their true names and could not provide detailed

personality information on any of them.. He explained:

remember now.

turned over often.

They all passed by like a river because they were

NOSENKO did recall that it was he who

selected and handled the agent who was placed in SHAPIRO's office

as a secretary; this agent had earlier worked in the offices of

Moscow News, an English-language newspaper published in Moscow.

He first identified GILMORE's cook, "AGLODINA," as Yelena

S. RUSIENKO in the fall of 1965, while reviewing a

list of sov-

jets employed by Americans in Moscow. He. told CIA at that tine

that he had taken over KOSIENKO fro

TOrMOZOV upon entering the

U.S. Embassy Section in 1953, and that she subsequently worked

for and reported on GILMORE's successor, Richard KASISCHKE.

NOSENKO

said that KOSIENKO "never

provided any interesting in-

formation."

NOSENKO estimated that he was responsible for handling 10

to 12 agents in operations against the correspondents.

cers might have as many as

agentura down as follows:

agents, SALISBURY's driver, "SER-

GEY" and a part-time cleaning girl.

NOSENKO classified two other of his agents as "neutral," in

that they did not have specific targets on whom to report.

The

first of these was the director of MOSGRAN, a Russian-language

training

in Moscow.

His cryptonym was

The sec-

ond, "VOLODINK," was a female teacher in this same program who

instructed some of the correspondents, including BRODNEY, and

Embassy employees in their homes; he could not recall the true

name of "VOLODINK."

When NOSENKO was relieved of his responsi-

bility for the correspondents in 1954, he turned over all of his

agents to other case officers in the U.S. Embassy Section with

the exception of "RAKETA" and "VOLODINK,

" whom he continued to

handle in his work with military attaches..

c. Information from Other Sources

SHAPIRO was identified as a KGB agent by GOLITSYN in 196J,

before the lead was received from NOSENKO, and he had previously

been suspected as such on the basis of his long stay in Moscow,

his unusually good access to Soviet information sources, and his

marriage to a Soviet national.

SHAPIRO was mentioned as a KGB

agent by a cryptonym (known to NOSENKO and confirmed by COLIT

appearing in the CHEREPANOV papers."

The KGB defector Nikolav KHOKLOV had earlier identified the

Polish-born wife of WHITNEY as a KOB agent, an allegation which.

she denied, and it had been long assumed that inflay too had

reached some sort of accommodation with the KGy because of this

fact and because of the long duration of his tour as a correspond-

ent in Moscon.

GILMORE also had

been suspected by CIA before NOSENKO's in-

formation was received.

He servea in Moscow for: 12 years, from

1941 to 1953, and 15 married to a Soviet national.

SALISBURY served two short tours, of about one year each,

in Moscow during the 1950's.

second of these, he

became enamored with the pole who was to become WHITNEY's wife

(see above)

and was during this period a subject of criticism by

other American correspondents in Moscow for has pro-Soviet arti-

cles.

When WHITNEY married the Pole shortly after STALIN's

death, SALISBURY returned

to the United States and his articles

took on an anti-Soviet tone.

NOSENKO claimed no involvement with the other two imerican

correspondents whom he identified

as KGB agents,

STEVENS and

STEIGER, both the subjects of a considerable amount of derogatory

information in CIA files.

They are discussed in Part VI.D.2.

under the heading of NOSENKO's American leads.

3. Operations Against Military Attache Personnel

Some time in the first half of 1954 NOSENKO was. relieved of

his responsibilities for the correspondent cases, and from then

until his transfer from the American Department he hanaled KGB

Second Chief Directorate operations against the officer person-

nel of the U.5. Military Attache's office.

NOSENKO's account of

the turnover of the correspondent files to his successor and of

the acceptance of the attache files is presented below.

- 8 April 1964: "I took over the Military Attache cases

from Nikolay KHRE:OV...

When I was leaving

in 1955, I turned

the attache files over to Valeriy BUDYLDIN."

- 10 April 1964:

"I made a mistake...

I said I accepted

This is not right.

KHRENOV was not working in the First

on

10 April 1961 that he received the files in the beginning of

"only about six months."

most often gave for his entry into the KGB, is correct this would

a. Agents Reporting on Military. Attaches

Asked in April 1964 to describe the agent network

(agentura) at his disposal in operations against U.S. Mili-

tary Attaches during this period which began in 1954, NO-

SENKO replied:

"There were two maids,

a cook, drivers*...

about ten persons, plus the agent 'SERVIZNIY'

and the one

with the code name

'DMITRIYEV'

... These additional two

agents, about 12 or 13 agents altogether."

with one ex-

ception, this network remained constant until NOSENKO trans-

ferred from the U.S. Embassy Section in mid-1955.

He met

each agent about once a week, except for the chauffeurs who

were met three times a month in a safehouse or on the

street.

According to NOSENKO, this network was

"just a

supporting agentura, which very seldom was worthwhile,

the

main source of information on

the Military Attaches being the

microphones in their offices.**

Newly added to the network while NOSENKO held this

position was a maid inserted to report on Army Attache Earl

L. MICKELSON and his successor, Fillmore K. MEARNS.

Her

name, NOSENKO thought, was nOVIkOVA.

She was an English-

speaking university graduate but "hid her knowleage of

English in order to overhear

conversations or read letters

without taking them outside."

Besides NOVIKOVA, NOSENKO named one other maid who was

his agent, Mariya NEVEROVA, code name "SHIVEDOVA,"

Was targetted against the Assistant Army Attache, Ira

RICHARDS.

He described NEVEROVA as a

"little, old, thin

oman," from whom he never obtained anything of interest.

They met in a safehouse on Kuznetskiy Most.

Of the KGB agents among

the chauffeurs, NOSENKO identi-

fied Nikolay SANYRYEV, who was used by various of the at-

"He reported where they went, what they

whether they took notes of photographs, whether they had

unusual packages with them, and so on."

When viewing photographs in September 1964, HOSELKO

icentified Vladislav VOROBYEV as the agent

"SERVIZNIY." He

had been working in the Embassy since its

estavlishment,

starting first as a messenger boy and, in NOSENKO's time,

performing clerical tasks.

VOROBYEV had no direct connec

tion with the Military Attaches, and NOSENKO said he himself

did not know why he had been given VOROBYEV to handle in

1954.

The main function of this agent was delivering to

NOSENKO copies of the unclassified telephore listings of the

Embassy, issued monthly.

"DMITRIYEV'g" true name may have been Dmitriy KUKOLEV:

NOSENKO saw this name

on a 1962 phone list and thought, but

was not sure, that this was his agent.

An electrician who

worked on the Embassy's electrical wiring systems

and eleva-

tor, "DMITRIYEV" reported to NOSENKO on antenna wires and

The Military Attaches used a pool of five drivers at random,

NOSENKO said. Apart from the permanent driver for the senior

attache, none were targetted against individual members of the

attache office.

Embassy.

In September 1964 NOSENKO was shown a serles of 260 bio-

graphic cards on Soviet citizens employed by the American Em-

bassy in Moscow.

Each card contained a photograph of the per-

son involved and short biographic notes, including his name

and job in the Embassy.

The first time: he went through these

cards, NOSENKO was permitted to see only.

the photographs; NO-

SENKO

did not identify the photographs of SHNYRYEV and KUKOLEV

but said that the face of VOROBYEV was familiar, adding that

he thought his name was VOROBYEV.

When shown the blographic

information on SHNYRYEV and KUKOLEV, he identified each of them

as his agents during the 1954-1955 period in the American De-

partment and equated them to the cryptonyms given previously.

In the case of SHNYRYEV, when shown the bicgraphic information,

which listed SHNYRYEV as "chauffeur for the Military Attache,"

NOSENKO exclaimed:

"Oh my God,

this is my own agent."

He.

later said it was a good photograph of SHINYRYEY.

b. NOSENKO 's Targets

As the Second Chief Directorate case officer responsible

for operations against American Military (Arny) Attaches sta-

tioned in Moscow, his main task was not to recruit them but

rather was to prevent the attaches fron collecting intelligence.

He has used this statement about his main task (identical with

that of other U.S. Embassy Section officers working against

the Army and Navy Attaches) to support his claim that no U.S.

Armed Forces Attaches were recruited by the KGB from 1953 un-

til his defection in 196t.

He has also said that this is one

reason he knows relatively little about the personal back-

grounds of his various targets during this period--the empha-

sis was on surveillance instead of development for recruitment-

purposes.

Asked in February 1965 to list the Army Attache por-

sonnel

for whom he was directly responsible during 1954 and

1955, NOSENKO gave the following names:

"MICKELSON, MEARNS,

RICHARDS, FELCHLIN, BENSON, MULE, STROUD, and CARDELLA."**

His

knowledge. of the activities of these targets and of KGB action

against them, coupled with information from other sources, is

discussed in the following paragraphs.

Naval Attaches were handled by ZHUKOV during this period, NO-

SENKO said, while Air Attaches were initially handled by CHURA-

NOV.

When CHURINOV left the section in early 1954, he turned

over the Air Attache files to PANKRATOV, who turned them over

later in the year to KHRENOV.

**This is the order given by NOSENKO.

The list comprises two

generations of Army Attaches in Moscow and is neither in al-

phabetical order nor in terms of date of service in Moscow.

It 1s, however, in descending order of rank from Colonel MICKEL-

SON through Captain MULE to Chief Warrant Officer CARDELLA.

Questioned about these officers in a different context,

NOSENKO

Indicated knowledge of their ranks.

Not mentioned by NOSENKO

was George VAN LAETHEM, Assistant

Army Attache in Moscow from

August 1951 to August 1953 (prior to the time when NOSENKO said

he was responsible for work against the nilitary attache office).

VAN LAETHEM returned to Moscow in 1955, however, and was at-

tached to the Army Attache staff again fron 19 March to 19 May

1955, during which time NOSENKO claimed he was still responsible

for this group.

(1) MICKELSON

NOSENKO has identified Earl L. MICKFLSON as a colonel

and the Military Attache in Moscow

during 1954 and 1955.

PANKRATOV was the case officer originally handling MICKEL-

SON, and the case was turned over to NOSENKO in 1954.

When asked about agents who night have been working against.

MICKELSON, NOSENKO

said that there was one cook, a KGB

operational contact whose name he did not recall, and

MICKELSON's maid,

whose name NOSENKO believed was NOVIKOVA;

the cook and NOVIKOVA went to work for MICKELSON after NO-

SENKO had left the U.S. Embassy Section:

In addition to

these two, the only other

source reporting

On MICKELSON was

his chauffeur, whose name. NOSENKO also did not remember.

NOSENKO said that the KGB learned nothing interesting about

MICKELSON from concealed microphones, telephone taps, or

surveillance, and that no operational approach or recruit-

ment was attempted.

There was, in tact, no interesting or

derogatory information on MICKELSON from any source.

According to information in CIA filos, MICKELSON was

involved in at least two incidents inside the Soviet Union

which NOSENKO has not reported.

In lay 1954 he was arrested

in Tbilisi on the

charge of having photographed &

bridge, but he persuaded the Militia not to press charges.

In August 1951 SICKCISON was arrested again for illegal

photographs gouth of KHARKOV; on this occasion he was held

for two hours before being released.

(i1) MEARNS

NOSENKO identified Fillmore K. MEARNS as MICKELSON'S

replacement and said that he was

the responsible case

There were two agents and one operational contact

working against !!EARNS.

Of these,

NOSENKO could recall the

name only of NOVIKOVA,

the same maid tho reported earlier on

MICKELSON.

Besides being told to attempt to overhear NICKEL-

SON's conversations NOVIKOVA was instructed to search his

clothing and tu copy any notes she might find, but she

never overheard or found anything of interest to the KGB.

NOSENKO recalled that MEARNS' personal elfects were searched

by the KGB while they were being shipped to iloscow from the

United States,

and that all his service records had been

as being more "active" in Moscow than MICKELSON had been and

said that information from concealed microphones showed

him to have a strong character.

cerning him

from tele-

phone taps.

CIA has no derogatory or otherwise significant informa-

tion on LEARNS, who replaced MICKELSON.

colonel who served

Assistant Army Attache in Moscow.

RICHARDS.

The one agent reporting on RICHARDS WhOM NOSENKO

could nanie

was the maid Mariya NEVEROVA, KGB cryptonym

"SHEDOVA," but she had never provided any worthwhile in-

formation

about RICHARDS.

lessons from Ludmila GROMAKOVA in his apartment.

During

these lessons,

KICHARDS often ciscussed

labor conditions and

wages in the United States and, on one occasion, had her

record her speech on his tape recorder.

GROMAKOVA was preg-

nant and unmarried at the tine.

(NOSENKO has named GROMAKOVA

as a KGB agent in another context but has not mentioned her

contacts with RICHARDS.) * RICHARDS identified one "Volodya"

first nane Vladimir) as his principal driver.

About

62 years old

in 1354, Volodya was the son of a rich

jeweler

in Moscow during the

Revolution.

Volodya himself was well

educated and, on one occasion while picnicking outside Mos

he spoke intelligently with RICHARDS

about the

Revolu-

tion, propaganda, and

news media.

(NOSENKO did not know of

Volodja.)

Further details from RICHARDS are given in the

following section on FELCHLIN.

(iv) FELCHLIN

NOSENKO identified Howard L. FELCHLIN as a lieutenant

colonel who served as Assistant Army Attache in Moscow and

stated that he was FELCHLIN's case officer.

FELCHLIN was in

the Soviet Union during 1954 and part of 1955, until being

declared persona non grata.

NOSENKO did not recall the

name:: of

any agents specifically targetted against FELCHLIN,

although he thought FEICHLIN must have had a maid and she

would

have been

a KGB agent.

Additionally, NOSENKO said,

the Assistant Military Attaches shared a pool of cars and

drivers, and these were his agents.

Unable to recall the

precise date of FELCHLIN's expulsion, NOSENKO related it to

some event regarding Soviets stationed in the United States

for which the Soviet Government decided to reply in kinú.

NOSENKO was imprecise as to the pretext used to expel FELCH-

LIN,

but said the action

was based on information which had

been accumulated from

a number of sources

and incidents.

For example,

FELCHI,IN had beer caught

taking

some photographs

and a report had been written; along with other similar

indications of FELCHLIN's activities and reports of agents

in contact with FELCHLIN, the report

was filed away for pos-

sible

future use.

NOSENKO was questioned further on FELCH-

LIN during the February 1965 interrogations.

He said then

that FELCHLIN alone had been declared persona non

grata,

and that no other attaches had been involved.

to whom she also taught Russian.

explained his having but few details concerning this action

by the fact that it took place after NOSENZO had trans-

background.

Kiev by a Soviet Army officer for photographing a military

told the name and asked for an identification, NOSENIO

American

ambassador to deliver a strong protest note.

FELCHLIN was

Soviet Union.

No specific charges were mentioned.

Walter A. MCKINNEY, the U.S. Air Attache and one of FELCHLIN's

travelling companions at the time the "spy notes" were

allegedly lost, was declared persona non grata at the same

time.*

(vi1) MULE

NOSENKO identified Walter MULE as an Assistant Army

Attache and said that he was the case officer responsible

for him.

NOSENKO described

an operational approach to MULE,

in which he himself participated:

In 1953 or 1954 there

had been several defection

approaches to Soviets in the

United States on the basis of money and the pronise of a

new life.

After the KGB Second Chier Directorate decided to

try the

same easures,

MULE was selected because he was only

a captain despite his

lengthy service in the Army and because

material from concealed microphones indicated that he was

often

disparaged by the other attaches.

When MULE received

letters from home, he threw them in the trash, and the

maids

turned

these over to

the KGB; from this nail it was

understood that MuLk

did not have a house in the United

States but lived with his

family in a trailer.

The father

of two children, MULE had

sent his wife from Moscow to Ger-

meny for en abortion,

as a third child would have imposed

too great an econonic

burden.

On the basis of all this the

KGB

appointed N.d.

BURODIN, a recruiter of the American De-

partment, to attenpt

to defect MuLh.

Together with BORODIN,

KOVSHUK, and L.A. LEBEDEV (from

the Second Chier Directorate's

special technical section) HOSENKO travelled

to Leningrad

for the operation.

LEBEDEV installed a ciock containing a

concealed camera as well as microphores in MULE's hotel

room, and BORODIN entered the room to await MULE's return.

When NULE started to enter the room, he caught sight of

declarca persona non grata.

NOSENKO save the following

account of this incident:.

For some time the

Second Chief

Directorate had boon trying to acquire a small, convenient

plece of electronic equipment which

American Intellizence

officers were known to be using during their travels inside

the soviet Union.

As early as the beginning of 1954, the

Anerdonn Department hnd been given authorization from the

Central Courittco of the Conmunist Parly to sterl thig

equipment fron tho Americans, provided that the success of

such an operation was assured.

Before his transfer to the

Tourist Department in 1955, NUSENKO hinself had helped to

develop plans for the operation and had even arranged an

abortive etreapt lo steal the equipment from

an attache at

a railroad station outside doscow.

while BENSON, MULE,

and STROUD were on one of their trips (after NOSENKO'S

tran3-

fer) it was learnud that they had the equipment with them,

and the KCB decided to take it from them in Stalingrad.

To carry out the operation, Licutenant General P.V. FEDOTOV,

then Chief of the KGB Second Chier Directorate, and A.M.

GORBATENKO, Chier of the Auerican Departnent, flew with

other personnel from the American Department to Stalingrad.

The hotel rooms

of BENSOY,

STROUD and MULE were watched

constantly from a visual observation post, and it. was noted

that they never ato in the hotel restaurant but always in

their rooms.

It was also noted that the apparatus was

placed under a pillow before they began to cat.

while

they

were seated at the table having dinner, therefore, the KGB

officers suddenly entered the roon and

seized the equipment.

In order to partially cover the illegality of this

act,

was decided to make a show of expelling BENSON, MULE and

STROUD from the Soviet Union, and this was done via the

persona non grata action.

According to information from other sources,

the equip-

ment was seized from BENSON, JULE, and STROUD on

5 May 1955,

and the three were declared persona non grata on 7 May (a

nonth before NOSENKO ciained to have transierred to the

Tourist Department).*

When the 7 May date

was given to

NOSENKO during the February 1965 interrogations, he replied

that the operation was handled at a higher level, that he

did not directly participate in it, but that he had been

Involved in the earlier planning to seize the equipment.

It was pointed out to him that he had always sald ho was in

the fourist Department at the time of this operation, and

that he had consistently said that

he transferred

from the

American to the Tourist Department in June 1955.

NOSENKO

shrugged, but offered no comment.

*The

source Kaarlo R. TUOll, who served in the United

States

as a GRU Illegal

from 1958 to 1963, reported to CIA

in. 1964 that while working as a KGB informant in Kirov in

the early 1950's, he was targetted against three U.S. 4111-

tary. Attaches travelling on a train.

TUOMI believed that

he night have contributed information leading to the three

mericans (as he later read in the Soviet press) being de-

clared persons non grata.

It would appear that TUOMI's

(1X) CARDELLA

NOSENKO said that in 1954 and 1955 there was an admini-

strative officer in the Embassy by the name of James CARDELLA.

The KGB had no interesting or unusual information concerning

CARDELLA from any source, ard NOSENKO could say nothing more

about his.

CIA files show

that Chief Warrant Officer CARDELLA served

in Moscow from September 1953 until June 1955.

Other than the

fact that a microphone was discovered in CARDELLA'S MoscoW Em-

bassy office in 1954, no significant collateral information

concerning him is available.

(X) VAN LAFTHEN

NOSENKO identified George VAN LASTHEM as an Assistant Air.

Attache at the U.S. Embassy against

an operation. was at-

tempted in 1953 or 1954.

He sald that during this period

Russian actress, Alla LARIONOVA, was placed on a train going

from Berlin to Moscow with the mission of striking up an acquain-

tance with VAN LAETHEM whish could be followed up in moscow.

She succeeded in meeting him and gave him her acidress and tele-

phone: nurber.

Although she was certain that

she would hear frcm

him, he rever did call her in Moscow.

NOSINKO said that he had

heard

about this frou P.F. PANKRATCY, the case officer handling

LARIONOVA.

He added that

CHURANOV was the case officer respon-

sible

for vAn LAEThEr,

as he was for all members of the Air

At-

tache's office at that tine.

NOSENKO knew of no other interest

or activity concerning

VAN LAETHEM.

CIA records show that VAN LALTiEY was not an Assistant Air

Attache but an Assistant Army Attache, serving in Moscow from

March 1951 to March 1953.*

As cryptographic security officer

and officer in charge of

the Embassy code room, he had super-

visory responsibility for the military code clerks and mechanics,

including Dayle SMITHI, and he was on fairly close personal terms

with Sergeant Roy RHODES until the latter's departure from Mos-

cow in January 1953; VAN LAETHEM's duties also carried respon-

sibility for sensitive electronic activities in the Embassy.**

He was again in Moscow from

19 March to 19 May 1955 (at a time

when NOSENKO claims to have been the KGB case officer for U.S.

Army Attaches). Although this trip was always intended to be

only a TDY, it

was represented to the Soviets as a PCS Assistant

Army Attache assignment because of the extrerely sensitive na-

ture of his business there.

He was project officer for the en-

tire electronics program at the Embassy, and went to Moscow to

review the operations including the planned use of the new

electronic equipment which was seized from BENSON, MULE, and

STROUD in Stalingrad in May 1955 (see above) •

Although VAN LAETHEM completed his two-year tour in Moscow in

March 1953, just at the time NOSENKO said he entered the KGB,

he was succeeded in his post by walter MULE, for whom NOSENKO

has claimed full responsibility. Thus, the fact of his posi-

tion as Assistant: Army Attache ana MULE's predecessor would

presumably be

available to NOSENFO.

Each time NOSENKO gave CIA the story of the recruitment of

"ANDREY" in the June 1962 meetings.

he related it

to Roy RHODES.

Each reference to Roy RHODES was followed by a statement that

It was through RHODES that the KGB learned of the existence of

special electronic equipment in the U.S. Embassy.

RHODES had no

access to such information.

D. June 1955 to January 1960 (Tourist Department)

1. Introduction

By his account NOSENKO served in the American-Canadian-

British Section of

the Tourist Department, * KGB Second Chief

Directorate, from June 1955 (shortly after the department

was created to operate with and agaiast foreign travellers.

in the USSR) until his transfer to another department in

that directorate in January 1960.

He was a case officer

until appointed Deputy Chief of the Section about June 1958.

In stateients made prior to April 1966, NOSENKO claimes to

have been twice promoted during this four and one-half year

period--to captain in July 1956 and to major in August or

September 1959--but in a signed statement of April 19€6 he

said he remained a captain from 1956 until his defection.

NOSENKO has described his personal and direct partici-

pation in the section's activities as consisting of:.

-Recruitment of two Soviet nationals as homosexual

agents, **

with NOSENKO

their handler from the outset until

they were dropped in 1962 or 1963.

-Recruitment and handling of Soviets as agents tar-

getted against American tourists; their number varied from

eight to 14 and many were employed by Inturist.

-Operations involving i foreigners who visited the

USSR for various lengths of time.

-Recruitment and handling of the American Express Com-

pany representative in Moscow,

whom YOSENKO continued to

meet following his reassignment in January 1960.

-Decision in October 1959 that Lee Harvey OSWALD was

of no operational interest to the KGB,

and subsequent par-

cicipation in the KGB investigation of

OSWAlD's activities

in the USSR.

Each of these categories is discussed separately below.

2. Soviet Homosexual Agents.

Because he had been

seen meeting a foreigner in a

public lavatory in Moscow, NOSENKO said, the KGB concluded

that A.I. VOLKOV might be a homosexual and hence of some

operational value.

The KGB therefore mounted an operation

which verified this possibility in 1987: A homosexual agent

of the Moscow Criminal Investigations Department provoked

VOLKOV into a compromising situation. Then VOLKOV, who had

previously been a KGB agent but was at this time deactivated,

was called to KGB Headquarters where, after NOSENKO interro-

gated him, he admitted his honosexuality and agreed to

"These couponents are also known as the First Section and

Seventh Department, respectively.

**This tera refers to agents whose honosexuality is ex-

ploited py the KGB against certain nale targets:

## Page 26

NOSENKO's proposal

to work. for the KGB among homosexuals.

VOLKOV helped NOSENKO the following year to recruit a hozo-

sexual acquaintance, Aleksey (patronyni: not recalled)

YEFREMOV.

The two agents subsequently worked as a team

against foreigners under NOSENKO's dirortion; in addition

to specific targets, they had the general assignment of

associating with foreign visitors in Mo:.cow for the pur-

pose of spotting possible hoosexuals.

NOSENKO described

on 12 June 1962 his use of these agents:

"Although I an

They are able to

They call me at night:

'Well, let him. We'll talk about it tomorrow.'

So the next

day they go to a special hotel room.

Then we think about what he represents.

Is he worth it?

Then, as Chief, I recommend that he be recruited or not--

depending on his position, what he can give,

what he can

tell.

If he can give something, I say:

'Well, let's have

a go ligrat'l.

After

this, I speak to these boys:

•Well,

When

NOSENKO moved from the Tourist Department to the

Second Chief Directorate's Anerican Department in January

1960,

he took VOLKOV and YEFREMOV with him.

They were

never used against targets in the U.S. Embassy, but, NOSENKO:

said, the Tourist Department "used to call me on homosexual

prospects."

VOLKOV and YEFREMOV continued as active KGB

agents until some time in 1960 or 1961, after which they

could not be used further since they had become too well

known, and NOSENKO finally retired their files to KGB

archives in 1962 or 1963..

The last operation in which these

two agents participated was during January 1962.

During interrogation on these agents, NOSENKO has been

unable to tell where they lived in Moscow,

their family

situation, or other such details. He said that he never

net either in a safehouse (always

on the street) and never

not either of them alone, without the other being present..

NOSENKO has described eleven KGB approaches to Americans

based on

compromibing evidence obtained with the assistance

of VOLKOV and/or YEFREMOV and several other cases in which

Americans were suspected of being homosexuals on the basis

of the evaluation of these two.

Additionally, CIA records

Indicate that at least six Americans; not reported on by

NOSENKO, have had contacts

with one or both of these agents

Of these six, three were CIA agents, one a U.S.

graduate student, another a psychiatrist visiting Sovlet

institutions; and the last. Charles w. THAYER; the well-known

diplomat and author.

With one or possibly two exceptions, all

the contacts of VOLKOV and YEFREYOV reported by NUSENKO. Or

other sources took place during the period from April to

November 1959.

The known exception was the KGB approach to

W.E. JOHNSON in January 1962;* the possible exception was

the contact with the American psychiatrist, which took place

In 1959 or early 1960 but cannot be dated precisely.

Finally,

NOSENKO has described the contacts between VOLKOV;

YEFREMOV,

and the American Robert BARRETT in the summer of 1959 but

does not know of their contacts in the summer of 1962,

shortly before BARRETT was approached on the basis of com

promising information obtained in 1959.**

3.

Other Soviet Agents

The Tourist Department, Just established when NOSENKO

was transferred to it in mid-1955, had no agent network for

operations against American and British tourists.

Conse-

quently, NOSENKO said,

he and the other case officers had

to "start from the beginning."

As a first step, NOSENKO was introduced by a fellow

officer to a number of "trusted persons" in Inturist; these

were not agents, he explained, but "just persons known to

the KGB so that a KGB man could approach

one of them with

questions about somebody or something."

NOSENKO began to

collect information on these individuals and others with the

alm of formalizing their recruitment; by the end of 1955,

he estimated, he had a network of about eight agents, all

of then Inturist interpreters.

During the following

four

years,

the number of agents

when NOSENKO handled varied:

Agents would be transferred from one case officer to another,

some would leave Inturist, and "things were sort of changing

all the time, back and förth." In 1956, NOSENKO said, he had

about ten agents, in 1957 there were about 12, in 1958 about

•eight, and at the end of 1959 (when he was preparing to return

to the American Department) he had approximately 12 to 14.

NOSANKO has provided information on five of these agents,

all of whom he says ha recruited from within Inturist during

1955. These were:

-Larissa SOBOROVA:

An: Inturist interpreter and. one of

the first Inturist agents recruited by. NOSENKO.

"SOBOROVA

waS NOSENKO's agent until 1959 (when she married and retired)

and reported to him on all foreigners with whom she worked as

an interpreter. She worked with NOSENKO in the operation

BELITSKIY said that she was directly involved,

probably as the principal, in a sexual entrapment operation,

in the recruitment of a mencer of the British Parliament.

BELITSKIY reported to CIA on SHULGINA in October 1962; NOSENKO

said his last connection with the BELITSKIY case was in Geneva

•in the spring of 1962.)

1955 (according to NOSENKO's statemert in April 1964 - see

Commonwealth Department in 1957 or the beginning of 1958.

In 1957 or 1959 she was involved in a sexual compromise

operation against an American professor, which did not

reach the point of a recruitment approach. Between 1957

or 1958 and 1900 she was working against an American tourist

named Philip NIFLSEN who was suspected of connection with

CIA and who was under study for recruitment by the

KGB. #

KUNGAROVA later married NIELSEN and the two livod in :,

England.

The KGB was still interested in NIELSEY at tho

time NOSENKO left the Tourist Department, but NOSENKO be-

lieved there was no recruitment. Urs. NIELSEN died in 1965.

Besides those in Inturist, NOSENKO has named several

other agents whom he recruited

or was given while in the

Tourist Department.

These included tha following:

-Aleksey A. DMITRIYEV: KGB cryptonym "TO!O," a can-

didate member of the Academy of Sciences USSR and a special-

ist on Japan and Thailand.

DMITRIYEV speaks Japanese and

English and worked at the Japanese exhibition in Moscow.

NOSENKO did not indicate how DMITRIYEV was used operationally

or how he was connected with the American-Canadian-British

target..

- (Inu) IVANOV: A lawyer employed by the Institute of

Foreign Trade in Moscow.

NOSENKO did not personally re-

cruit this agent.

IVANOV moved to Moscow from the Baltic

area and his provious handlers there notified the Center,

suggesting that the agent might be of use in the capital.

NOSENKO contacted IVANOV and later turned him over to the

British Commonwealt' Department of the Second Chief Direc-

torate which,

NOSENKO believed,

"planted him in the British

Trade Mission or sorething like that."

-Marina RYTOVA:

KGB cryptonym "KRYMOVA," born about

1923 or 1924 and educated at the Military Institute of

Foreign Languages, a special school which also had Communist

students from

foreign countries.

There she studied military

subjects as well as foreign larguages.

She speaks English

and Greek well.

time she was working as an interpreter at the Russian

Permanent Exhibit in Moscow and continued in this job until

about 1960, when she became an instructor in the Greek

language school of the Institute of International Relations.:

She reported to NOSENKO any information which she obtained

on foreign delegates or foreign tourists who visited the

Exhibit in Moscow.

As she was often invited by the Ministry

of Agriculture to

interpret during meetings between soviet

officials and delegates from America, England,, and Greece,

she also reported this information to NOSENKO.

from about 1955 to 1957 and was then turned over to NOSENKO.

She reported on JELISACIC, who was not approached, according

to NOSENKO.

4. Operations with Forcign Visitors

NOSENKO said he participated in 14 operations with

foreign visitors to the USSR while a member of the American-

Canadian Section of the Tourist Department.

Nine of these

operations resulted in recruitments

(excluding one who later

was recruited by

another element of the KGB, but including

another whom NOSENKO classified

as a borderline case).

Of

the remaining five operations which did not end with a re-

cruitment, no approach was contemplated by the KGB in one

case, one

target rejected NOSENKO's proposal, the KGB was

unable to obtain compromising material

for an approach to a

third,

and for political reasons the KGB decided against

approaching the final two.

Although the information from NOSENKO on the timing of

these operations does not always agree with that from other

sources, these cases can

be grouped chronologically as

follows:

1955 - one; 1956 - one; 1957 - three; 1958 - two;

and 1959 - seven.

The operations in 1955, 1956 and, with.

one exception, 1959

were homosexual provocations.

The re-

cruitment of Arsene FRIPPEL in 1959 was basca on heterosexual

compromise.

These fourteen operations

are sumnarized briefly below

in the approximate order in which

the cases began.

each case, NOSENKO's information is followed by

a summary of

the results of CIA investigations.

The description of the

BURGI

case is more detailed than the others, for reasons in-

dicated in the text.

a. Attempted Entrapment of MALIA (1955)

NOSENKO's Information: Martin MALIA, a graduate student,

spent about four months in the USSR in 1955 and was sus-

pected of having connections with American Intelligence.

Toward the end of his stay, while under surveillance, MALIA

was observed in contact with a Soviet citizen believed to

be a homosexual.

The Soviet was detained by the KGB, and

NOSENKO eventually obtained a confession that he had had

homosexual relations. with MALIA.

After. NOSENKO had arranged

for the Soviet to introduce MALIA to a KGB homosexual agent,

the latter enticed MALIA to a specially equipped hotel room

1n Moscow; NOSENKO was on the scene (but not directly in

touch with MALIA) when the introductions were made in a

Hoscow restaurant,

and from an observation polat in a

neigkboring hotel room he watched the KGB agent and HALIA

having relations. With MALIA insistire on the lights being

turned off, however, :1t was impossible to obtain compro-

m1s1ng photegraphs (tho KGB did nut set have infra-red

photograuhic equipmont, NOSENKO sald) and therefore no re-

crultient approach

was made to MALIA. During this and a

later trip to Moscow In 1961, MALIA Has "very cautious,"

and the KGB never again succeeded in exploiting MALIA's

honosexuality for a recruitment approach.

Investigation Results:

MALIA, a U.S. Navy intolligence

officer during world war I1, has visited

the soviet Union

in 1955 and twice in 1962.

while buying books for the

Library of Congress and several universities in 1955, MALIA

travelled over 10,000 miles throughout the USSR, which was

sufficiently unusual at the time to attract press publicity.

in 1955 and 1962 he had contacts with dissident soviet

citizens and clandestinely brought to the lest literature

for fublishing abrord.

In December 1963 MALIA was the

subject of an

attack in the Soviet press which charged that

b. Recruitment of BURGI (1956)

NOSENKO's Inforuation:

At the first meeting in 1962

and despite his stated lear for his own security and his

deternination to discuss only the two leads hu wished to sell

CIA,

NOSENKO described his recruitment of Yale Professor

Richard BURGI on the basis of a homosexual provocation

oper-

ation which began in Moscow and culainated with an approach

In Kiev in June 1956.

NOSENKO reported that he received a

letter

of comnendation (blagodarnost') and & honus of one

month's pay for this recrultuent, but in 1966 he retracted

this claim.

The BURGI case was

the first operation in which

NOSENKO had direct contact with a foreign target of the KGB,

and NOSENKO said he counted 1t

as a turning point in his

personal and professional life:

It was with this success-

ful operation, NOSENKO stated, that he "began to grow" fron

a spoiled playboy into a responsible and effective counter:

intelligence officer.

The BUNGI operation was the first

rocruitment carried

out by the Tourist Department after it

was created in 1955, according to NOSENKO.

In 1964 NOSENKO

reported for the first time that his superior, A.S. KOZLOV,

Deputy Chief of the Tourist Department, had also

taken part

In this operation, but that he, NOSENKO, was the responsible

case oificer.

August 1965;

when asked ho had recruited

BURGI, NOSENKO replied:

"KOZLOV and NOSENKO."

Asked who

recruited him first, NOSENKO said:

"KOZLOY, naturally,

He

was the Deputy Chief of the Department. The collection of

the materials (in preparation

for the approach, was in the

hands of Case Officer NOSENKO. "

Because of the personal and

general significance ascribed to this operation by NOSENKO,

1t 1s discussed in detail here:

In August 1965 NOSENKO reported that at the time of

BURGI's

arrival in the USSR, his

file

contained a copy of

his visa application

(anketa), "naybe" an excerpt from a

cable sent by the Soviet Embassy in the United States saying

that a visa had been granted, a routine note from Inturist

giving BURGI's anticipated

date of arrival and his itinerary

inside the Soviet Union, and

the results of traces of the

general KGB Archives and of the First Chief Directorate

Archives.

NOSENKO hinself ran the traces, which proved to

be negative; there was no information on record concerning

SURGI, and since no other names were mentioned in the

naterial available on BURGI, no other traces were made.

The

KGB interest in BURGI derived exclusively from

the lact that

he was a professor of Slavic studies and therefore had con-

tact with students who might sone day work

NOSENKO therefore

approached ru.A. LOPUKHOV, an

of the Britis' Department who handled the homosexual

agent Viktor BELAYOYSKIY, and asked permission to use his

agent in setting up the compromise.

After permission had

been received to mount an operation on this

basis, LOPUKHOV

and NOSENKO met with BELANOVSKIY and instructed him to make

BURGI's acquaintance in a hotel dining room.

The request came back with the approving signatures of o.u.

GRIBANOV and A.s. FEKLISOV, the Chief of the American Depart-

rent of the First Chief Directorate, which had expressed

interest in using BURGI in the United States.

BURGI's itin-

erary called for him to fly from Moscow to Kiev a short

while after this episode and, having called the Kiev KGB with

instructions, NOSENKO and KOZLOV flew there the day before to

prepare the operation.

BURGI arrived the next morning and

was met at the airport by (fou) KHODAKOVSKIY, an officer of

the Second Directorate in Kiev who operated under Inturist

was unable to recall how the car was ac-

quired, whether it was a KGB or Iniurist vehicle, who the

driver was, whether he was in the employ of the local AGB,

or other details.

In accordance with the operational plan, the local KGB

officer told BURGI enroute to the city that all the hotels

in Kiev were full at the moment because of various confer

ences, but that Inturist had arranged for him to stay for

about

a day in a private apartment in the center

of town;

he would be moved to a hotel as soon as possible.

car arrived at the apartment building on Kreshchatik Ulitsa

in Kiev, NOSENKO,

KOZLOV, V.S. PETRENKO, a local KGB officer,

and (fnu) KASTYKAITE

housckerper,

were haiting for

them.

NOSENKO could

not remember how

or whether he intro-

duced himself to BURGI.

The recruitment conversation,

he

said, was handled by "KOZLOV-NOSEIKO," but NOSENKO had for-

gotten by 1965 who said what:

"I don't remember what I

talked about and I don't remember what KoZlOV talled about.

Many things were discussed.

It started with how he liked

his stay

inithe Soviet Union...

Then we slowly proceeded

to say how unfortunate

it was that information had been re-

ceived

about his conduct in Moscow.

We told hin that his

homosexual activities were known,

that this was punishable

under Soviet law according to article so-and-so of the

criminal code, etc., that he was not a diplomat, had no

diplomatic immunity, that he could be taken to court ac-

cording to the

Soviet law...

Nell, he nas scared, confused,

upset, and

felt uncomfortable.

Then we slowly proceeded

to

say that all that could be smoothed out, but, you understand,

the basis was prepared for the man to say:

'All right, 1

agree to help.'

embarrassed

...

We

showed him the pictures.

He was

of course--he was naked.

Then we prepared the

basis:

'You have a noble task.

You teach; you have stu-

dents; the students

might become future specialists on

Russia or might work as diplomats, etc., but many of these

students could be used by intelligence.

They might be sent

somewhere with special tasks.

Maybe you will tell us who

among

the students

is

preparing for government service,

how

they are distributed,

etc.

During the first conver-

sation everything was made completely cloar...

He was not

at ali willing to help or work for soviet Intelligence.

He

was told that he must understand that in this case 'helping

Soviet Intelligence'

was a very broad term.

I remember that

I told him:

'Understand, nobody is going to ask you that

you help our friends

over

there, or

me, if I should be there,

or that you do anything bad or conduct any kind of subver-

sive activities, that you organize explosions or murder.'

After the Soviet Union,

he was supposed to go to Italy,

to visit the Russicum

of the Vatican, and here KOZLOV

grabbed the subject and

began to ask questions

about this

school.

He told us a bit about the Russicum

and we asked

him to write about it and he wrote down some names of the

professors who teach Russian subjects..."

According to

NOSENKO, the discussion lasted about five hours; at its end

BURGI signed a short statement that he agreed "to assist

the organs of Soviet Intelligence."

NOSENKO first said that

it was

he who took this statement from BURGI but later said

he could not remember whether he or KOZLOV did this. BURGI

was then

taken to a

hotel.

This was the first tine NOSENKO net BURGI. Following

the recruitment, he moved into the same hotel, a floor

above RURal,

and

for the remainder of BUlGI's stay in Klev

became his

constant companion and guide.

An attempt tas

made "to

smooth

out all the dirty business that had teen

brought up during the recruitment talk." NOSENKO took

SURGI to an old cathedral in Kiev; with KOZLOV and PaTRENKO

they visited a kolkhoz and the writer SHEVCHENkO's

grave in

nearby Kaniv.

the subject of homosexuality was not inised

again.

Fron

returning to Moscow.

Before the approach, ROSEtTO tad

Hungary

In late 1956.

HOSENKO later heard from soneone in

the American Department, First Chief Diroctorate that the

case was closed.

For

their roles in this first recruitment

of the Tourist

Department, NOSENKO said in 1905, he and

KOZLOV reccived letters of commencation and conuses of one

Virgil KRAFT, a clergyman

from the

Chicago area, visited the Soviet Union as a

tourist in 1957 05

1958, and NOStri was assigned to ba the responsible case offi-:

cer.

During an curlier trip to the usek, the KGB had learned,

KRAFT had been intimate wit! a Soviet woran.

NOSENTO arranged

for her to come in dosion fron tier,

Then Militiaron broke into the room; finding KRAFT

by DubaS, the Chief of the Tourist Departmeni.

(NOSENKO had

been the

case officer and had handled the opcration thus far,

but he took no part in the confrontation or recruitment approach

"because DUBAS

wanted it for hinself.") Although the recruit-

ment was not firm, KRAFT and DUBAS

"hau an agreeient" that

nothing would be done about the compronise if KRAfT did not

criticize the soviet Union in lectures

about his trip there

which he was to give in the United States.

DUBAS again con-

tacted KRAFT when he came to Moscow in 1963, and aftir this his

file was turned over to the First Chief Directorate.

NOSPHXO

récalicc that the first Chief Directorate "said that KRAFT was

not in a good region of the United states.

And also it smelled

like he had spoken of the approach mie to hin."

Therefore,

Nosenio concluded, he probably hau not keen contacted in the

Recruitment_of DREW (1952)

JOSENKO'S Information: George DReii,

an Aterican who

visited the Soviet Union in the spring of 1959, had originally

been the responsibility of V.N. IVANOV,

a CaSe

officer of the

section dealing with Anerican and Canadian tourists.

By chance,

however, DREW became involved with NOSENKO's homosexual agents

VOLKOV

and YEFRENOV (see Part V.D.2), and they reported this

to NOSENKO,

then the depuly chief of

the section.

NOSENKO and

IVANOV discussed the case with DUBAS and possibly GUSKOV, the

section chief,

and NOSENKO flew alone to Leningrad to make the

approach.

(IVANOV was not considered to be sufficiently ex-

perienced and his English

was not good.

NOSENKO arranged for

DREW to be compromised in a leningrad hotel room with a homo-

prevented the Tourist Department fron taking advantage

of its compromising photography of intrETT and WILLER-

FORD, and informätion provided by the carlier defector,

GOLITSYN.

GOLITSYN reported that an imericon employed

at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, possibly a code cleri., was

prepared

for recruitment on the basis of homosexual com-

promise during 1959 and 1960, according to information

there was no question about the recruitnent being achieved:

"The only question was to where." At the time, however,

SHELEPIN had just become Chairnan of the KGB and was

stressing ideological rather than blackmail recruitments.

He was shown these particular photograpis bit decided that

an approach on their basis would be too crude and that

another way should be found.

ilthough SHELEPIN did not

exclude the use of these photographs sone time in the

future,

according to GOLITSYN,

he had reservations against

using them at that tine for fear of the propaganda reper-:

cussions if the attempt should fail and be exposed pub-

licly.

GOLITSYN did not know whether the recruitment was

subsequently carried out. The essential differences: be-

implied the ban was in effect at least into 1960 and that

What kinds of

approaches are taking place to cur people in America and by

whom?

This is what interested us.

But he didn't know arything.

He couldn't say anything. He provided only superficial infor-

mation, nothing more."

NOSENKO was then asked whether FRIPPEL would not have been

useful for coverage;of Americans visiting the Soviet Union.

He replied that the KGB had already had great success in this

by other means and launched into a long description of the

methods of covering foreign tourists in the ussr."

NOSENKO was present in the adjoining room when FRIPPEL WAS

compromised by a Soviet female agent, Klara Konstantinovna

GORBACHEVA.

NOSENKO described the compromising scene in detail

as well as

the attempt by a KGB technician to take motion pic

tures of these activities

through a two-way mirror, and the

confrontation with the militiamen who broke into the roon.

TOP SECRET

## Page 48

130.

After returning to Geneva in 1964 and during subsequent

debriefings and interrogations, NOSENKO made the following

additional staterents concerning the FRIPPEE case:

- Although he had personally recruited FRIPPEL, he

did not do so

alone; Col. V.D.

CHEL'OKOY, Deputy Chief

(and later Chief) of the

Tourist Departnent, was present;

he and NOSENKO "carried out the recruitrent together" in

early September 1959. NOSENKO was, however, FRIPPEL'S

case officer.

- NOSENKO

attricuted his involvement in the FRIPPEL

recruitment to

following:

"In 1953, after 1958,

when I became the Deputy Chief of the section, my area

of activity was narrored down.

I didn't handle all the

tourists at that time. I worked as the Deputy Chief of

the section and I had

my owr. little area--for example, the

permanent representative of the Aericar. E:press Company,

and vesides that I began to collect all the material on

all American tourist firms which have anything to do with

Inturist and who send tourists to the U'SSR."

- FRIPPEL never provided any information of value to

Soviet tourist operations.

- Wnes NOSENKO began to work in the u.S. Embassy

Section of the Anerican Department in 1560, he took FRIPPEL

with him because FRIPPEL was

acquainted with some Ameri-

cans at the Embassy.

NOSENKO was

asked to question FRIPPEL

about the U.S. Erbassy and such Embassy officers as George

NINTERS and Lewis W. BOWDEN, but FRIPPEL never told NOSENKO

anything along this line.*

- FRIPPEL provided no interesting information during

NOSENKO's two meetings with him in 1962 and 1963, when

FRIPPEL returned to the Soviet Union as a tour guide.

- NOSENKO met "pretty steadily" with FRIPPEL during

the period to January 1961, and once NOSENKO and his wife,

in company with CHELNOKOV and his wife, had dinner at

FRIPPEL'S home, where they met Mrs.

FRIPPEL.

Odette

FRIPPEL was unaware of her husband's status as a KGB agent,

and therefore NOSENKO and CHELNOKOV used Inturist cover

for their acquaintance with FRIPPEL.

Although unusual for

KGB Second Chief Directorate case officers to visit agents

in their homes with wives present, NOSENKO explained that

he went because he

"was invited,"

and CHELNOKOV went "be-

cause he was also involved in the recruitment."

- First as Deputy Chief of a section of the Tourist

Department and later

as Deputy Chief and Acting Chief of

the U.S. Embassy Section of the American Department,

NOSENKO continued to meet with FRIPPEL in Moscow hotels

and restaurants.

Throughout this period, he was almost

invariably accompanied by CHELNOKOV:

"Perhaps one time

I met with FRIPPEL alone, otherwise it was always with

CHELNOKOV. "

Usually NOSENKO would arrange these meetings

with FRIPPEL at CHELNOKOV's request and the tho continued

to meet with FRIPPEL, despite his lack of production, be-

cause they "kept hoping he would give something."

In a

different contest, but speaking of CHELNOKOV, NOSENKO eX-

plained:

"You

see, never mind if you are a chief or a

deputy chief of a

department, you must have one,

two, oI

three agents.

GRIBANOV insists, so that you don't forget

how to work.

The Chiefs of the (Second Chief) Director-

ate do not demand that they have i2 or 13 agents, but they

must have two or three.

They will have important agents

or those in leading positions. "

- NOSINKO continued to act as FRIFPEL's case officer.

after

FRIPPEL had left the Soviet Union and NOSENKO had

been transferred and promoted to the position of Deputy

Chief of the

Tourist Department.

He met twice with FRIp-

Pal during this latter period when FRIPPEL visited the

Soviet Union as a

guide with groups of foreign visitors.

Both of these meetings were handled by NUSENiO alone, with-

out CHELNOKOV.

- The first meeting took place in the sumner of 1962,

after NOSENKO had returned to Moscow from Geneva.

had arrived in the Soviet Union as a guide for some Ameri-

can journalists.

(NOSENKO was unable to give the compo-

sition

of the journalist group or to recall where they

stayed in Moscow and where else they travelled in the sov-

iet Urion.)

HOSENKO contacted him in Moscow to learn what

questions

the newsmen intended to ask KHRUSHCHEV during

a scheduled interview; subsequently NOSENKO acknowledged

that standard practice required visiting journalists to

submit their intended questions for KHRUSHCHEV in writing

to Soviet authorities prior to interviews.

After the

interview, he recontacted FRIPPEL to learn the reaction

of the journalists to their talk with the Soviet leader.

NOSENKO could

not recall their specific reaction to the

KHRUSHCHEV interview but did remember that they were

"satisfied."

Another reason for contacting FRIPPEL,

NosaNno added in a later discusgion,

was to learn whether

any of the journalists might hive joined the group at the

last moment

the United States, which might suggest

intelligence connections on their part.*

- NOSENKO met. FRIPPEL alone for the second and last

tourists aboard the ship "Olympia," which stopped for a

day in Yalta and Odessa, NOSENKO flew to Odessa from Mos-

COW

from his group, FRippEL called on POSENKO in the latter's

hotel come and the two drank

NOSENKO had

given FRIPPEL a bottle of vodka as a gift,

and FRIPPEL

said he ranted to give NOSESKO some whiskey in return.

They drove in NOSENKO's car to the port, where NOSENKO

waited in the car while FRIPPEi, went aboard for the

6. Lee Harvey OSWALD (1959-60 and 1963);

As in the FRIPPEL case, NOSENKO was involved with lee

Harvey OSWALD during both periods of his assignment to

the

Tourist Department of the

Second Chief Directorate (1955-

1960 and 1962-1964).* While Deputy Chief öf the Anerican-

British-Canadian Tourist, Section, NOSENKO had a direct hund

in the decision in October 1959 that USWALD nas of no oper

to the United States.

Before President Kenriedy's assassi-

nation in November 1963; when NOSENÜ was again in the

Tourist Department as its Doputy. Chief, he vas present at the

time the KGB Second Chief Directorate learned of OSWALD'S

application to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City to re-enter.

the USSR.

After the assassination, he also played a role in

the KGB investigations of OSWALD's

activities during residence

in the Soviet Union from Octover 1959 untii June 1903.

Collateral information relating to OSWALD's stay in tho

Soviet Union, and particularly concerning any connections he

may have had

with Soviet intelligence,

is

meager and indirect.

It derives almost entirely fron indications ci

primary

interest by the KGB (among all Soviet Government organs) in

every desector to the USsk, and from infererces which may be

drawn from certain entries

in OSWALD's "Historical Diary" ano

certain statements made by his wife, Marina,

during inter-

views on behalf of the warren Commission.

After President

Konnedy's death, the Soviet Government provided

the United

States with official documents and letters pertaining to

OSWALD's defection to the USSK, his suicide attempt, his

marriage, and other events inside the Soviet Union.

Embassies in Mexico City between 29

tact with a KGB officer under Consular cover at the Soviet

Embassy there.

NOSENKO originally said he knew nothing of any

such contact.

In October 1966 he revised this to say that

OSWALD did not have contact with the KGB in Mexico City. NOSENKO

explained that he had been sitting in the office

of Tourist De-

partment Chief, K.N. DUBAS, when a cable arrived at Moscow Head-

quarters from the KGB legal. Residency in Mexico: The cable,

which NOSENKO said he did not personally see, reported that

OSWALD had visited the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City requesting

permission to return to the USSR and that he had dealt with

Soviet Foreign Ministry personnel only.

Statements to ClA

On the basis of the fbl interviews of NOSENKO and the

sinilar infornation which he hai previously piovides clA,

further debriefings were conducted ly cli on

3 and 2?. July

1964.

New and explanatory information received Juring these

debriefings is presented below:

(1) KGB Interest in OSWALD

Until CSWALD mentioned to the lazurist guide his desire

to remain in the Soviet Union, he was treated

routinaly by

the KCB.

When OSWALD made his

request, this was reported

innediately to the Tourist Department,

and it was from this

moment that the KGB began to pay attention to hin.

All

available naterials on him were inercupon collected and

examined--the visa application, Inturist reports, interpreters'

reDoILs.

reports

fron

hotel agents,

and the rosults of &

• heck of NGB Archives.

KRUPNOV interviewed the interpreter

to whom OSKALD had stated his desire.

Although the KGB con-

sidered it possible thai OSWALD might be an Anerican agentis

the KGB did nothing to investigate this possibility as

would be done

after

the person

is allowed to stay in the

Soviet Union."

Surveillance of OSWALU was not increased

after his request, and OSWALD was not inte-viowed by the

KGb in an attempi

to establish his intentions.

Theic was

no attempt to debrief OSivALo because

"He was not an inter:

esting person and wasn't normal."

OSWALD was never questioned

on his past nor asked to write an autobiography.*

From the

* NOSENKO provided details on this point to CIA (see below) and

made a similar statement when asked in 1961 why KGB agent

Tamara KUNGAROVA had been permitted to marry an American (her own

developmental target) and

** When he appeared at the U.S. Embassy to renounce his citizen.

ship on 31 October 1959, OSKALD told the counsellor officer that

he had been a radar operator in the Marine Corps and had told a

Soviet official that he would give the Soviets any information

concerning

the Marines and radar which he possessed.

material's

and reports immediately available it was decided

chat something wes not quite normal about usiard,

and the

Kub therefore had Inturist.tell him that he wouid have to

leave the USSR when his visa expired. OSALD's suicide

attempt supported the Tourist Department's feelirg that

it had been

right in deciding to refuse OSkALD's request

for citizenship, parsicularly as the hospital also re-

ported that he was not normal, and the Tourist Department

decided: "We will do nothing; we

don't want to know him."

Inturist was suusequently told: "'There is no KGB interest

in him.

'Do what you rant'..

The KGB thought that he was

of no interest for the country or for the KGB, that he was

not normal, and that he

should leave the country."

The

Tourist Department and the KSB in general thereupon "washed

their hands" of this natter.

There was never any

operstional use of OSWALD nor was

there anything

in OSKALD's

file to indicate that the KGB

attempted to debrief him on his past service in the U.s.

Marine Corps or other matters; this was because "he is a

very little person and also it is felt that he is not nor-

mal, so the KGB is afraid to do this with him.'

The GRU

was not informed of OSWALD's defection.

Neither was any

attempt made to exploit OSWALD for propaganda purposes

in Moscow or in Minsk:

In short, there was no intelligence

interest or contact with OSWALD after the initial assess-

ment of abnormality.

(ii) KGB Interest in Marina OSWALD

The KGB had no lnowledge or interesi in Marina (nee

PRUSAKOVA) until she and OSWALD applied for permission to

register marriage.

In fact the KGB did not know that she

was a friend of OSWALD until this point, for there was no

surveillance on OSWALD to show that he

knew her.

When the

KGB learned of their relationship, checks were made of the

Archives of the Minsk KGB as well

is neighborhood .checks and

checks at her place of employment.

The people where she

lived and worked and went to school considered her a simple

gIrl, not very clever, only fair in her studies, not an active

member of the KOMSOMOL.

She was a simple "philistine," an

uncultured girl more interested in

gossip than ir anything

important. The KGB never considered recruiting her as an

informant on OSWALD "because it was considered dangerous to

recruit a wife to report on her husband." Nor was it con-

sidered to recruit her for use after she arrived in the

United States, "because she would tell him and also: she

would probably.tell the Americans, based on the assessment

of the type of person she was."

(iil) OSWALD's Marriage and Departure from the USSR

NOSENKO was asked why there were so few difficulties

in the way of Marina's marriage to a foreigner and her

departure from the Soviet Union.

lie replied:

'"The Soviet

law allows any Soviet citizen to marry a foreigner. It was

" NoSENKO subsequently delined this Xol reservation about.

easy In this case because OSWALD was already living and

working in the Soviet Union.

It would be sore difficult,

of course, with tourists of others who are in the Soviet

Union only for a short period and want to marry Soviet

citizens.

•*: Asked whether it is not unusuilly difficult

for Soviet citizens to leave the Soviet Union, NOSENKO

explained:

"In this case it was easier because Marina

was already married to a föreigner."

NOSENiO was next

asked what office of level of the Government or Party

must make the final decision regarding Marina's marriage

to OStiALD.

He described

the procedure as follows: "They

would come to the Regional Registration Office to apply

to register their marriage. (There) they will be told

that they will have to wait a week of two while they think

it over to be sure they want to get married.

During this

period the necessary checks are conducted.

The Regional

Office would call the Militia, and the Militia would call

the Minsk KGB.

The Minsk KGB said that it is all right

for them to got married--that the KGB has no objection.

But it is the law that allows them to be married. There

are no formal approvals necessary."

Concerning the decision to permit the couple to leave

the USSR, NOSENKO said on 3 July 1964 that the decision

would be made on the local level, in Minsk, and that there

is no need to check in Moscow.

1964 he corrected

this statement to say that, while local authorities make

the decision,

the Ministry

(IV) OSWALD's Visit to Soviet Embassy in Mexico

Asked whether he had any information on OSWALD's visit

to ::xico in September 1963, NOSENKO said that he knew oniy

that OSWALD had applied at the Soviet Embassy there to come

to the Soviet Union.

The Mexico City Legal Residency of the

KGB reported his visit to leadquarters by cable, requesting

inforrs:ion; this was the first that the KGs First Chief

Directorate had heard

of CSWALD.

M.I. TURALIS, Deputy Chief

of Service Number Two

that ALEKSEYEV then came to V.D. CHELNOKOV OF A.G. KOVALENKO

to ask about OSWALD, and NOSENKO thought that he hinself was

present at the time.

ALEKSEYEV was given the background on

OSWALD, including his suicide attempt and the fact that he

was not considered normal, and was told to advise the first

Chief Directorate that OSWALD should not be permitted to re-

enter the Soviet Union.

ALEKSEYEV then telephoned TURALIN

to relay this message.

NOSENKO did not know to whom OSWALD

had spoken at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City, and he knew

"By the time OSWALD applied for permission to marry, he had

already written the American Embassy in Moscow, through soviet

(V) NOSENKO's Comments on Possible KGB Involverent in the

Assassiration

When first discussing the OSWALD case with YOSENKO on 23

January 1964, a CIA case officer commented: "'It is a very un-

fortunate thing that these prior events occurred in the soviet

Union. "

(NOSENKO apparently misunderstood the case officer's

intent, which was not to imply that the KGB was behind the

assassination, but only that tho fact of OSvAlD's "defection"

placed

the USSR under probaby untounded suspicion.) NOSENKO'S

immediate response to this remark was:

"That is not correct.

This is putting a false color to it. I am your friend.

I am

completely with you,

and. I will continue to work with you and

agäinst the Soviet Union in all respects.

But the truth

should always remain the truth.

No matter how I may hate

¿cannot speak against my convictions, and since

know this case I could unhesitantly sigu off to the fact that

the Soviet Union cannot be tied into this in any way.

I say

this because I know they were frightened of this nan

(OSWALD)

and that everything should have been said to him or that he

should have been in

any way worked an,

in any was. (by the KGB!

•-God forbid!...

I know this because

on this matter for

several days after the tragic matter occurred to the President.

To investigate in detail if anything had been done, particularly

by the local authorities,

that is, by the local KGB in

Belorussia..., I had to make a complete investigation and

even sent several workers down there to investigate--not

trusting official papers.

Even without specific orders I had

to make a complete investigation on my end of things because

this

is a serious matter when the head of a government is

assassinated...

If you want to know,

it would be a

greater

advantage to the Soviet Union if the

President were still

Kennedy because he was a personage who was a realist and looked

at many things in the eye boldly... In the history of any

intelligence service there have been assassinations of one

kind or another.

I can say this: That in our organization,

not even speaking of myself, many persons were shocked by

che assassination-to think

that this should happen in the

twentieth century and in, of all places, the most powerful

jovernwent in the world."

Supervisory-Responsibilities.and Knowledge. of Tousist

operations

Information from NOSENKO

In June 1958 there was a reorganization within the Tourist

Department of the Second Chief Directorate.

The Second Section,

which had theretofore

concerned itself with operational activity

against foreign tourists from all countries, was broken down into

separate sections; one section dealt with tourists from the united.

States, Canada; and Great Britain, the other with tourists from

Europe, Latin America, and all other countries.

NOSENKO said

that he was promoted at this time to the position of Deputy Chief

of the first of these new sections.

NOSENKO's involvement in at least one major case, Lee Harvey

OSWALD, sters entirely from his having

held this position.

It

is also on this basis that he was able to claim awareness of all

recruitments from among American tourists from mid-1958 until he

returned to the American

Department at the beginning of 1960.

His knowledge about recruitments

is based additionally, he

said,

on the fact that some time between lay and October 1959, during

the tourist season, he was ordered by Ye. S. KIRPICHNIKOV,

GRIBANOV's secretary, to gather facts for GRIBANOV concerning the

use of tourist cover

by foreign intelligence organizations during

the period from 1955 through 1958.

NOSENKO gathered this material

from earlier

annual reports of the Tourist Department and by talk-

ing with various case officers in the department.*

On the basis of his general and supervisory experience in

the Tourist Department as well as his research for this paper,

NOSENKO had the following to say about Tourist Department opera-

tions prior to 1960 (taken

from the protocol he signed on this

subject on 25 February 1965) :

"Operations against tourists were developing slowly

during this period and very little was known by the KGB

about the use of tourism by American Intelligence at the

time I wrote the report in 1959.

No agents were definitely

uncovered among American tourists during the years 1958 or

1959 and, until 1960, no tourists were

'caught in the act'

of mailing letters, servicing deaddrops or contacting.

agents, except one whose name I remember as McGUIRE.

Questioned on this paper in February 1965, NOSENKO said he

did not remember whether he discussed it with GRIBANOV, nOI

could he recall any examples of the material he included in

tourist operations, or what

as

• an operational cover in this period. He did remember, how-

ever.

that it incorporated statistical data on the growth

of foreign tourism.

not. krow any details concerning the operational activity

which led to the discovery of McGUIRE's letter mailing.'

"I know of no case in which an imerican tourist was

definitely uncovered as an agent of American Intelligence

and thereafter approached for recruitment by the KGB during

this period.

"I do not know of any

such Imerican tourists who were

CIA agents, and who were recruited by the KGB during this

period.

"In addition to M-GUIRE, the Seventh Department de-

veloped suspicions concerning a number of tourists, but

didn't learn of any specific

intelligence connections.

Some were taking pictures, others vere disseminating

literature.

Although various operational measures were

taken agäinst them, including ryemka (covert baggage

search)

and the use of KGS agents, rore of these tourists

received real operational development.'

b.: KGB Knowiedge from Seorge_ELAKF

During the first week of June 1959, a three-day meeting was

held in London, England, between representatives of CIA ana the

British Secret Intelligence Service

(sIS, commonly referred to as

MI-6)

on the subject of 'legai-travel' intelligence operations

against the USSR.

At the conclusion of this meeting there was

drawn up a 19 page document summarizing what had been discussed

at the meetings.

This summary spelled out CIA operational doc-

trive pertaining to tourist operacions, including

agent-spotting

techniques, criteria for agent selection, agent assessment,

agent

training,

and tasks to be carried out

by tourist agents during

the coming (1959) tourist season.

It stressed CIA's reliance

on tourists for the spotting: recontaiting, assessing,

and

communicating with clandestine assets in the Soviet Union.

copy of the document as weil, presunably, as other British docu-

ments relating to the joint meetings was given to George BLAKE,

who has admitted having made a phorographic copy which he passed

to the KGB. He gave the KGB this information in the summer of

1959.

* One Robert Alan MCGUIRE,

a forner: staff empioyce of CIA,:

travelled to the Soviet Union as a tourist during April and

May 1958.

Although he was debriefed on his return,

he had

no connection with CIA in preparation for this trip and

mailed no letters for CIA inside

the USSR,

While in the

Soviet Union, McGUIRE was approached on numerous occasions

by Soviets

seeking blackmarket deals., American girls, and

assistance in defecting to the Americans.

While en route to

Leningrad, his brief case was overtly searched by a customs

employee,

who confiscated a Radio Liberation script.

MCGUIRE

reported that he was compelled to sign a document which stated

that the script had been confiscated,

but the reasons for the

action were left blank.

NOSENKO

who has reported none of

these details,

appears to have confused McGUIRE with Edward

MCGOWAN,

a CIA agent who mailed a letter in Minsk in August

1958 and was detected doing so by the KGB; NOSENKO said

MOGUIRE mailed a letter in Minsk in 1959.

In the CIA debriefing upon his return to the united,

MCGOWAl descrited a number of incidents in the USSR.

20 August 1958,

for example, while staying at the Metropol Hotel

in Moscow, MCGOWAN met Alan

BALLARD and Gertrude SAMUALS, fel-

low Americans, and the three of them were protographed by a sur-

veillance team when leaving the hotel.

Within several days of

his arrival in Moscow, MeGONAll found he was incompatible with

his female Inturist interpreter/guide and

succeeded in having

her replaced..

Mis new guide

was V.L. ARTEMO:, who assured that"

McGOWAN had female companionship for the remainder of his visit.**

The document from GOLITSYN also states:

"SIMARD, Lionel,

born in 1939,.

college instructor, expressed an abnormal inter-

est towards military literature of

the USSR; he made contact

with Soviet citizens and attempted to slip into the area of ship-

building factories in Leningrad.

SIMARD wert to the USSR as a CIA agent in August 1959, and

he believed that he was under conplete KGB coverage while there.

He was in and out of Moscow four times during his trip, and each

time he was assigned hotel rooms known to contain various KGB

observation equipment.

un one occasion SILAPD was introduced to

to cultivate him.***

The characterization of his activities in

the GOLITSYN document is correct.

NOSENKO has not mentioned

Another part of the document supplied by GOLITSYN says:

"An American, Whitmore GRAY, born 1932, an assistant professor

University, sent three esplonage letters contalning

secret writing, wnile in Kiev.

In Stalingrad he was detained

while he was photographing a military factory."

GRAY arrived in Kiev on 3 November 1959 after having been

trained by CIA in countersurveillance

mailing mission and other assignments in the Soviet Union.

NOSENRO reported on a 1959 trip to the Soviet Union by

BALLARD, but said he was not aware of earlier ones.

This is the same ARTINOV identified by NOSENKO as a fellow

case officer in the U.S. Embassy Section of the American De-

partment and as the man with whom he worked on the BELITSKIY

case in Geneva in 1962.

ARTEMOV appeared again in operations

against American tourists in 1959 when he was assigned as

Inturist guide/interpreter for a group of Americans which in-

cluded a CIA officer.

On one occasion, when this officer re-

turned unexpectedly to his hotel from

the theater to which

ARTEMOV had escorted him, he caught ARTEMOV searching his

hotel room.

NOSENKO has not mentioned these contacts of

ARTEMOV, which took place at the time he said he was deputy

Chief of the section dealing with American tourists. In

October 1966, in answer to a specific question,

NOSENKO stated

that ARTEMOV never had any connection with the American Section

of the Tourist Department.

NOSENKO has identified IVANOVA as an agent of the U.S. Embassy

Section of the American Department, but has not described her

earlier activities against tourists.

but GRAY detected surveillance dally thereafter until

he left Kiev and later in Yalta.'. He was approached on 17 Novem-

ber in Baku by an attractive woman who persistently offered hèr.:

services despite his refusal, and on 18 November by a girl in

Tbilisi who occupied a seat next to his in a theater and made

similar overtures.

GRAY was also approached by blackmarketeers

and by purportedly disaffected young men. On 13 Novenber he

was arrested in Stalingrad while photographing industrial in-

stallations and was released

after interrogation and confiscation

of his film.

NOSENKO made no references to GRAY.

The KGB document elsewhere states:

"E guide of a tourist

group, John Milton FRANCIS, born 1934, an instructor of Russian

at a college of Yale University, when in Odessa with a group of

tourists--American students--separated himself from the group

and travelled through the city alone.

In a notebook which was

lost by him, notes and sketches were found which pointed to the

fact that hu utilized his trip for the purpose of selecting

suitable places for the placing of deaddrops, or for checking

those deaddrops which were earlier selected by American agents.

In Moscow he selected routes which were used. to check and dis-

discover the existence of surveillance, utilizing passable backyards

and following stillful methods.

At the present time FRANCIS is

the chief irterpreter of the State. Department, servicing Soviet

delegations in the USA."

FRANCIS did have such a mission in 1958 and brought back a

notebook with sketches of the sites he selected. He did not

mention

losing his notebook.

In 1954 and 1955 FRANCIS was in

freguent contact with V.V. KKIVOSHEY in Berlin; KRIVOSHEY, who

served there until the late 1950's, has been identified

First Chief Directorate officer who later became an officer in

the Correspondents Department, KGB. Second Chief Dixectorate.*

FRANCIS was also a student of Richard BURGI at Yale in 1956, the

year that NOSENKO was involved in BURGI's recruitment (see Part

V. D.4.b.).

NOSENKO has not mentioned the FRANCIS case and did

not recognize his name.

Besides these and other examples in the document GOLITSYN

gave CIA, there are indications of KGB awareness of the clandes-

tine activities of many other CIA contacts who travelled to the

Soviet Union as tourists during the period from 1955 to 1960.

KRIVOSHEY was a participant in the Sgt. Robert Lee JOHNSON

case to which NOSENKO provided the, lead (see Part VI.D.3.c.).

E. January 1960 to January: 1962 (American Department)

1. Introduction

NOSENKO claims to have served as Deputy Chief of the U.S.

Embassy Section of the American Department, KGB Second Chief

Directorate.

from sometime in January 1960 until the first days

of January 1962.*

This section, in his. words, was working

against "the most important counterintelligence target in the

Soviet Union," the permanent American representation

in Moscow.

It regarded every American stationed there as a possible spy

and, simultareously, as a target for eventual compromise and

recruitment.

The functions of the U.S. Embassy Section were described by

NOSENKO as being, first, to control all contacts by ambassy par-

sonnel with Soviet citizens; second, to evaluate information

collected from all possible sources on American Embassy employees:

and third, to use this infornation as a basis for planning and

carrying out recruitment approaches.

The Americans' personal-

ities, jobs, parsonal relationships, weaknesses,

daily routines,

security precautions, contacts with

Soviet citizens, and the

major and

minor scandals in their Moscow lives formed the basis

for this sork.

To gather such information, the section's officers

directed and debriefed large numbers of agents and informants.

including the indigenous employees of the Embassy, Soviet citizeng

moving in Embassy social circles, and third-country nationals with

American contacts; the officers also assigned tasks to and assim-

ilated the reports from the numerous surveillance teams at their.

disposal, and

they read and tried to exploit materials from tele-

phone taps and microphones placed in the offices and homes of

the Americans.

Each officer had a limited number of American

targets and attempted to become thoroughly familiar with ach:

annually, they submitted detailed operational plans to exploit

the knowledge they had gained of their target.

During 1960 and

1961,

NOSENKO said, special emphasis was placed within the section

on

"identifyirg intelligence officers at the Embassy and active

development of them, the acquisition of ciphers, and the detailed

and painstaking study of code clerks, creating the conditions un

the basis of which they can be recruited."

As Deputy Chief of this section, NOSENKO has said, he had

access to all information concerning its activities:

"Nothing

was hidden" from him.

On this basis, he expressed certainty

that in 1960 and 1961 the KGB did not recruit any Americans

associated with the Embassy, that no Americans assigned to the

Embassy were being handled in Moscow as KGB agents in this

period. and that,

in fact, the KGB had recruited no American

Embassy personnel

since

with his fellow-officers of 1960 and 1961, NOSENKO has also

claimed certainty that there were no KGB recruitments from the

time he left the section in January 1962 until the January 1964

trip to Geneva.

In debriefing and interrogating NOSENKO, CIA placed partic-

ular emphasis on his activities during the period January

1960 to January 1962, since this information was of speciai

importance to

U.S. Government security.

See Part VI.D.3.b. for a discussion of the case of the KGB

agent "ANDREY" (Dayle SMITH), whose recruitment has been

variously, dated by NOSENKO between the years 1949 and 1953.

Meanwhile, no one replaced NOSENKO as Deputy CHief"of" chie

Tourist Department's American Section because (as he explained

on 29 January 1965) the Tourist department, which had earlier.

operated against members of delegationg and various other

categories of foreign visitors; was being reorganized in January

1960 for work against tourists alone and the Deputy Chief slot

was eliminated.*

With the exception of A. A. DMITRIYEV, Marina

RYTOVA,

and

tne homosexuals YEFREMOV and VOLKOV, NOSENKO turned

over all of his agents

to another officer in the section named

TIMOFEYEV.

NOSENKO said on 29 January 1965 that he had two

separate files on his agent Arsene FRIPPEL, a developmental file

and an operational file, and that he turned the former over to

TIMOFEYEV. and the latter to V. D. CHIELNOKOV, Deputy Chief of the

Tourist Department.

During later interrogations, however, NOSENKO

has said that he continued to handle FRIPPEL while in the U.S.

Embassy Section and was

the case officer during FRIPPEL's visits

to the Soviet Union in 1962 and 1963.**

2.

NOSENKO's Transfer to the U.S. Embassy Section

In December 1959, while serving as Deputy Chief of the

Averican-British-Canadian Section of the Tourist Department,

NOSENKO learned from K. N. DUBAS, the department Chief, of

plans

to transfer him to the U.S. Embassy Section as Deputy Chief.

NOSENKO said he was opposed to the move and wanted to remain in

the Tourist Department:

"I was used to it there and wanted to

continue.

I wanted to stay in the Tourist Department.

This

Lthe transfei/ was no promotion.

Here I was the Deputy Chief

of section

and would be the same there.

But, of course, Its more

important there.

The American Department is, of course, the most

important.

But here I was working against Ameriçan tourists.

This is also important.

Furthermore, I showed Chad proven my-

self there in '55,

'58, and '59 and was considered to

be not a bad case officer.

And here, in the American Department,

I must show /prove/ myself with new people."

asked DUBAS in December 1959 to "please fight for me to stay."

DUBAS later told NOSENKO that he had twice spoken to Second

Chief Directorate Chief O. M. GRIBANOV on his behalf, but to

no avail.

In January 1960 the official orders transferring

NOSENKO were issued.

On the day NOSENKO reported to V. A. KLYPIN, Chief of the

American Department, to begin his new job, he was told to report

to GRIBANOV's office.

NOSENKO again expressed mis-

givings about the change of assigrment.

GRIBANOV replied that

DUBAS had spoken to him about this but that he, GRIBANOV, "had

his own plans and that was all." GRIBANOV told NOSENKO that

043.

**

There was no change in the functions of NOSENKO's section,

however;

as before, it continued to be responsible for

operations against tourists from the United States.

England, and Canada.

FRIPPEL has reported that NOSENKO: continued to meet him

until he left the Soviet Union in January 1961 and again

when he returned as a guide to tourist groups twice in

1962 and once again in 1963; see Part V.D.J.

he thought rosenko could bring "fresh air"

to the U.S. Embassy

Section's operations and that he was to pay particular attention

to operations against American code clerks, the "number ore

target."*

Neither GRIBANOV nOr KLYPIN told NOSEKO why he had

been selected. for this position. or who had recommended him for

it.

NOSENKO was asked on 17 April 1964 whom he had relieved

upon reporting for duty in the U.S. Embassy Sectior..

"Nobody."

He replied:

He was then asked to identify the persons from whom

he had assumed certain of his duties as Deputy Chief of the

section (these are discussed in detail below). HOSENKO said that

he took the responsibility for maintaining the section file on

the security of

v. M. KOVSHUK, **the U.S. Embassy from the Chief of the section,

Regarding his responsibility as case officer

NOSENKO explained

cause former Security Officer Russell LANGELLE nad been declared

persona non grata in October 1959 and because his successor John

was not to arrive until March 1960, no ore in the section

had this responsibility wher he,

NOSENKO, arrived in January

Asked who had been L'iGELLE's case officer, NOSENKO IE-

plied: "LANGELLE was handled by several people - by LA.S.I MALYU-

GIN, then after that by LV, A,/ KUSKOV, then by KOVSHUK, then

GOLITSYN also commented on this subject

to his CIA handling officer:

work was particularly intensified after the appointment of

SHELEPIN to the KGB...

In 1960, it was recomnended in

KGB to intensify the work against the Americans at the U.s.

Embassy in Moscow, and against American colonies in other

countries...

This question of intensifying work against the

Americans

was up before the Collegium of the KGB.

Thereafter,

there was a directive from SHELEPIN regarding the intensifi-

cation of work against the American cipher-clerks."

**There is an apparent contradiction between NOSENKO's desig-

nation of KOVSHUK as Chiaf-af the First (U.S, Embassy) Sec

tion in 1960 and information earlier supplied by GoLiTsy.

GOLITSYN told CIA of a conversation he had with KOVSHUK in

•January 1961 in Moscow (see Part V,E.3:C.2. concerning a

recruitment approach to the American code clerk James STORS-

BERG)

but at that time described KOVSHUK only as an American

Department officer,

without indicating his position.

only time that GOLITSYN has given a position for KOVSHUK was

in the

context of questioning concerring KHRUSHCHEV's "Secret

Speech" denouncing STALIN in 1956, GULITSYN; said that at this

time KOVSHUK was Chief of the American Department (sic) of

the Second Chief Directorate,

On 16 February 1962 GOLITSYN

identified Vladimir PETROV as. Chief of the "section concerned

with the American

Embassy of the

American Department of the

Second Directorate in 1960,, NOSENKO had identified PETROV

as Chief of the Second Section of the American Department,

which was concerned with the penetration of U.S. intelligence

operations inside the Soviet Urion..

"TANGELLE was betore my time.

* Two months later,

on

24 June 1964, NOSTIKO stated:

"In 1959 and possibly in 1958,

Mikhail Fedorovich BAKHVALOV was the Deputy Chief of the U.s.

Embassy Section.

I replaced him in this position in 1960 and

he went to the Fifth (fastern Countries) Departnent as Deputy

Chief. "*

On .8 Septemcer 1964 NOSENKO volunteered for. the first

time that BAKHVALOV, as Deputy Chief of the section, had been

the case officer for LANGELLe. Under interrogation

in early

1965, NOSENKO added that BAKHVALOV had also been responsible for

maintaining the file on the security of the U.S. Embassy.

At

this time he explained his earlier statement by saying that BAKH-.

VALOV had left the section before his arrival and had given the

file to KOVSHUK to hold for his successor:

The file continued to

be charged officially to BAKHVALOV, however. even though he was

no longer in the section, and NOSENKO arranged for the official

change of custody sortly after reporting for duty (see Part V.E.

3.f.).

NOSENKO said further, in January 1965, that BAKHVALOV

had shared

responsibility for supervising code clerk operations

with KOVSHUK before NOSENKO arrived to assume these duties him-

self.

NOSENKO had been given a rumber of opportunities prior

to 24 June 1964 to identify BAKHVALOV as his predecessor, but

he did not do so. These are summarized below:

27 February 1964: NOSENKO was shown a photograph of V.A.

ALEKSEYEV, a Soviet who was in Japan from

July to September.

1961 as a member of a trade delegation.

NOSENKO inmediately

recognized the face as that of the Deputy Chief of the Fifth

Department of the Second Chief Directorate.

He said that he

did not know this person's last name, but that his first name

and patronymic were

Mikhai Fedorovich.

when shown the last

name ALEKSEYEV, NOSE:iKO recognized it as an alias, but pro-

vided no further information concerning his true identity or

earlier service in the American Department.

10 June 1964: NOSENKO was asked to list in writing the

names of KGB officers who had received various awards for

their service.

He wrote:

"The following got either the

Duties and Knowledgeability

: 80

Introduction

Shortly after reporting for duty in the U.S. Embassy

Section and following his short discussion with GRIBANOV,

NOSENKO met with Department Chief KLYPIN and

.. Section Chief

KOVSuUK to discuss

his responsibilities

and functions in

the section.

Repeating what GRIBANOV had already

said,

KLYPIN stressed that NOSENKO's sost important single respon-

sibility in the section would be supervision of all KGB

operational activity against American military and State

Department code clerks stationed in Moscow.

As for the

other Americans at the Embassy, KLYPIN suggested a division

of labor under which KOVSHUK

would be resporsible for super-

vising operations against State Departrent personnel and

NOSENKO would supervise work against the Arny, Air Force,

and Naval attaches and their assistants.*

NOSENKO HaS alSO

made responsible for maintaining certain files in the section.

On 19 February 1965 NOSENKO signed an interrogation proto-

col which he agreed contained a listing of his principal

responsibillites during 1960 and 1961. It read in part:

"During the eptire

My responsibilities were the following:

Section in his absence.

-Immediate supervisor for the operational work

against American code clerks.

In this capacity I

closely guided the work of case officers Gennadiy

GRYAZNOV and Vadim KOSOLAPOV.

-Case officer for U.S. Embassy Security Officer,

tache operations for the first time in 1965.

are discussed belon.

time the protocol was signed.

"Throughout this entire period I sat in room 618

Square, Moscow.

GRYAZNOV and KOSOLAPOV shared this of-

fice with me throughout most of this period."

b.

(1) Access

Functions as General Deputy and Acting Chief of Section

Since his defection NOSENKO has maintained under re-

peated interrogation that as general deputy to KOVSHUK, with

the responsibility of taking over in KOVSHUK's absence, he

had acces: to all information on the section's activities

and was obliged to keep

current on this information.

On

this basis he has been able to assure his questioner's that

the KGB was completely unsuccesstul in its attempts to re-

cruit Americans assigned to the Embassy in these two years.

NOSENKO has also said at various times that his access to

section files and his discussions with section officers made

it certain that there were also no successes from 1953 to

1960 and from January 1962 to January 1964.

His statements

on this subject during the February 1965 were distilled in

a protocol which NOSENKO signed on 20 February (quoted in

full):

"1.

As the only Deputy to the Chief of the

American Embassy Section,

First Department,

Second

Chief Directorate, KGB, Vladislav Mikhaylovich KOV-

SHUK, from January 1960 to January 1962, one of my func-

tions was to serve as KOVSHUK's general deputy and to

assume the rights and responsibilities of Chief of the

Section during KOVSHUk's absence.

In order to perform

this function I had the right and the obligation of

knowing the details about every important activity of

the section against the American Embassy and its per-

sonnel. No activity of this nature was withheld from

me.

"2.

As Deputy Chief of the Section I know defi-

nitely that no U.S. officials serving in the Embassy

were agents of the

KGB or reporting unofficially in

any way to the KGB during my service in the Section.

There were no approaches or recruitments made by the

Section during the period January 1960 to January 1962

against personnel of the American Embassy,

including

personnel of the State Department, the offices of the

Military Attaches (Army, Navy, and Air), the Department

of Agriculture and USIA,

including Marine guards, Army

sergeants,

State Department code clerks

and Army code

clerks except against STORSBERG and KEYSERS, both un-

successful approaches.

he handled in this period; they are discussed below.

•(11) Duties

On 29 January 1965, NOSENKO was questioned concerning

You have no idea who they are meeting, or when

they are meeting then?

A:

When they are meting an active development agent;

they tell me afterwards.

They are telling "this,

this,

this, this" and I an answering "this, this,

th1s."

But usually they are going to meet maids

or they don't have to report.

There is nothing

active and thore is.... The file is going on.

What about operational vehicles? Automobiles?

A:

You see, we lad one automobile for the whole

department.

Besides

this, we could apply, wher

necessary, to the officer on duty for the Second

Chief Directorate and he would give a car, be-

cause he has a number of cars at his disposal.

Q:

approximately how much of your time did you spend

supervising GRYAZNOV and KOSOLAPOV?.

A:

I can't say.

Has it the most important function?

•A:

Yes, It was important.

All work in the First

Section was important.

This was the most impor-

tant.

But one day I could devote the whole day

to code clerks, the next day maybe half the day,

maybe two hours

in

the day.

The rest of the day

I will be absent.

I will be neeting with KLYPIN,

or I will be having a meeting with surveillance,

or I will be at another place.

The third day,

again, maybe the whole day, maybe part of it.

No, I

can't tell you. It depends on the situa-

tion.

Additional Duties in KOVSHUK's Absence

As Deputy Chief of the U.S. Embassy Section, one of

NOSENKO's responsibilities was

to serve as Acting Chief

when KOVSHUK was absent from the office.

NOSENKO recalled

that he fulfilled this function during

KovSHUK's two 30-aag

leave periods in 1960 and 1961, but he did not remember

when this leave occurred in those years.

He also

served as

Acting Chief for about a month in the summer of 1960 when

KOVSHUK was in the KGB hospital with heart trouble and for &

week or two some time in 1961 when KOVSHUK was 1ll again..

NOSENKO wag unable to recall any operational or inspection

trips that KOVSHUK made in 1960 or 1961, and the only other

specific time that he could remember KOVSHUK being absent

was for several days in connection with preparations for

President Eisenhower's planned visit to the Soviet Union in

1960.

NOSENKO's description of his duties in KOVSHUK's ab-

Bence was summarized in a protocol which he signed on 3 March

1965:

"I do not remember any particularly important

operational decisions I made as Acting Chief of Sec-

tion, nor any unusual things that happened during

these times.

The poly specific responsibility KOVSHUK

C.

Supervisor of all Code Clerk Operations

(1) Introduction

Among the numerous KGB activities against American code

clerks in Moscow which SOSENko has discussed are five opera-

tions wherein the KGB intended or effected approaches for

recruitment/defectior purposes..

According to NOSENKO, none

was successful.

The five major cases are reviewed separately

below, one of then in the context of duty trips abroad by

NOSENKO's subordinate KOSOLAPOV.**

NOSENKO said that, upon assuming responsibility for

supervising operations

against American code clerks,

"difficult situation."

assignment

Of KOSOLAPOY to the U.S. Embassy Section in late 1959, all

operations against code

clurks had been handled by A.S. MALIU-

GIN, but during MALYUGIX's two years of effort. there had

beer no operational approaches and no successes.

*The Edmund STEVENS case is discussed in Part V.C.2.

**GOLITSYN on 20 March 1962 identitied KOSOLAPOV's photograph

as that of a veteran KCB officer

with whom he was personally

acquainted.

GOLITSYN said that KOSOLAPOV had entered the KGB

1s about 1952 and had served for two or three years as a

member of the First (American] Department of the KGB First

Chief Directorate under United Nations cover in New York City;

subsequently he had worked for two or three years in the

First Chief Directorate at KGB Headquarters.

According to

GOLITSYN, the bachelor KOSOLAPOV was transferred to the KGB

Second Chief Directorate some time prior to 1960 in line with.

• KGB policy for only married men to be sent abroad.

As of

1960, GOLITSYN said,

KOSOLAPOV was working against code clerks

stationed in the American Embassy in Moscow.

He added that

KOSOLAPOV speaks excellent English.

Prior

• to GOLITSYN'S

Identification, CIA had no indication of intelligence acti-

vity on KOSOLAPOV's part:

Between February 1953 and April

1955 he was assigned

to the United Nations Secretariat Trans-

lation Unit as a translator; in August 1958 he had been an

interpreter at the Geneva Conference on Nuclear Test Detection;

1n September 1959 he accompanied KHRUSHCHEV on his trip to

the United States (sce Part V.F.3.d. which desoribes the

role of NOSENKO's target. John ABIDIAN in connection with the

KHRUSHCHEV trip).

KOSOLAPOV's English is flawless.

On the several operations against military code clerks

which NOSarKO has described and in which he has claimed a

personal role, his greatest detail and emphasis has been given

to the case of James Harry STORSBERS.

In 1952 NOSENKO said

in line with GRIBANOVis instructions that he pay parti-

cular attention to code clerk operations,

he deroted most of

almost a year to che STORSBERG operation, and

played a personal role in the unsuccessful KGE approach; he

the first person his

conversatior. with STerSBERG.

During tre 1964 to 1966 period, NUSENKO denied not orly that

he had personally participated in this wäy but also tha: he

had ever claimed to have done: he continued to say: horever,

that he supervissa the operation from

beginnirg to

end.

Ac-

cording to NOSENKO, this operation got under

way with the re-

cruitmert of a third-national agent (johan PREISFRECiO, a

Finn) sore time in the first half of 1963,

The specific aim

in usir this

agent was to Involve STORSBERG in compronising

activities, which

would then form the basis for the approach.

The operation dragged on through 1960 ana

until the spring,

summer, or autum: of 1961; at this time N.s

SKVORTSOV, a KGB

officer, "as introduced in the guise of a wealthy frerch busi-

nessmas to contire the development of compromising informa-

tion.

PREISFREUTD waS then withdrawn from the operation.

Several weeks later STORSEER$ was approached, principaily on

the basis of his financial need,

but he rejected the XGs bid

and the coeratior: was over.

NOSELiKO was certain that STORS-

BERG had rot reported the approach and said that the kes would

use this fact as an additioral eiement of pressure should

STORSBERS again te posted outside the United States.

NOSENKO

also kred that GOLITSYN had reported to CIA corcerning KGB

modus operandi in this case as well as PREISFREUND'S part in

it.

GOLITSYN in early 1962 had, in fact, told CIA about

PREISFREUND having been used by the KGB in an operation againg

an American stationed in Moscow,

Contrary to NOSENKO S Infos

mation, ke said that this American had been approached--and

recruited--by the iGBat the erd of 1960,

A second iten from GOLITSYN may also relate to the STORS-

BERG operation:

SOLITSYN told of learning in the spring of

1960 that the KGB had developed a military code clerk in Mos-

cow to the point that recruitment was virtually assured.

AC-

cording to U.S. Army records, only two military code clerks

were stationed there at that time, STORSBERG and his superior

William S. HURLEY,

the military communications officer who

additiorally performed cryptographic duties.

NOSENKO has

said that there was no KGb operation against HURLEY, and

HURLEY has reported no approach.

In addition to the detailed information given by NOSENKO

this case, the FBI and Army. Inteiligence have interviewed

STORSEERE (Who confirmed NOSENKOs account and denied recruit-

ment) and CIA has talked to the KGS agent PREISFREUND (Who

also generally corfirmed the information given by NOSEyKO

but did not know the outcone of the case.

The results of

these isterviews. together with information from GOLITSYN and

'fron otber sources, are summarized in this order below.

(c) Information from PREISFREUND

CIA initially interviewed PREISFREUND on 8 July 1965 in

Helsinki.

(NOSENKO himself had suggested that PREISEREUND

would confirm his story of the STORSBERG case.)

Durirg this

first meeting with him, PREISFREUND correctly

identified photo-

graphs of KOVSHUK, NOSENKO, and STORSBERG.

He maintained, how-

ever, that his relationship with KOVSHUK and NOSENKO was strictly

on a

business level, that he had never had anything to do with

the KGB, and that he

did not know what the initials "KGB" stand

fOI.

Toward the end of this meeting, PREISFREUND allowed that

he may have been unwittingly involved in some activity against

STORSBERG and agreed to tell

the "entire truth" the following day.

On 9 July 1965 PREISFREUND described how he had been

in a blackmarket operation in Moscow and

this basis,

cruited by KOVSHuk "either at the end of 1959 or early 1960"" el

Several weeks later, he said, he was approached by NOSENKO who

explaired that KOVSHUk was unavailable and that the iGs wanted

him, PREISFREUND,

introduction between STORSBERG

and a Soviet female, Irina, the daughter of a Soviet general.*

PREISFREUND then left Moscow, and when he returned about two

months latar, he took STORSBERG to the Peking festaurant, where

the introduction was effected.

PREISFREUND, STORSBERG, Irina,

and another girl then went to

PREISFREUND'S

hotel, where STORS-

BERG and Irina were intimate.

PREISFREUND said on 10 July 1965 that he was fairly certain

his recruitment took place in early 1960, probably in March or

At the time KOVSHUK had refused to explain what the KGB

wanted him to do; he said only that they would talk about it

later but assured PREISFREUND that he would not be asked to

undertake anything detrimental to Finnish

KOVSHUK establish any means of communications with PREISFREUND,

telling him only that the KGB would know where to find him.

PREISFREUND subsequently visited the USSR on several occasions,

Just as he was beginning to believe

that the affair had been forgotten, NOSENKO contacted him at

his room in the Berlin Hotel in Moscow.

Asked

to explain his

earlier statement that NOSENKO first met with him two weeks

after the recruitment, PREISFREUND said he could not remember

exactly how long

it was, but that it was definitely on another

trip to Moscow and that it was probably several months later.

PREISFREUND was asked how he had first met STORSBERG.

first replied that it had been at America House and recalled

that NOSENKO had simply told him to go there and "find Jim;"

it was only with some difficulty that he finally managed to

strike up an acquaintance at the bar.

On second thought, PREIS-

FREUND said, he may have first met STORSBERG at the sauna in

the Finnish Embassy in Moscow through a mutual Finnish acquaint-

Throughout this initial period, NOSENKO and KOVSHUK made

repeated promises that once the introduction of STORSBERG tO

the Soviet female had been accomplished, there would be no more

demands made of PREISFREUND by the KGB.

PREISFREUND added:

According to NOSENKO, this was Irina LEBEDOVSKAYA,.

agent of the U.S. Embassy Section who was handled by A.V..

Information from GOLITSYN

GOLITSYN, who had serveri the KGB most recently as a counter-

intelligence officer in Heisinki during 1960 and 1961, reported

separately two possibly related leads to operations against Am-

the united States Erbassy in

One of

these was a developmental operation against a military

code clerk which the KGB

felt was aimost certain of success,

other a recruitment approach to an Emoassy employee which GOLIT-

SYN was told had been successful.

items

of information

from different Kis Second Chief Directorato

officers

in Moscow, this would be the first recruitment of a code clerk

in the office of the American Military Attache since the estab-

lishment of the Second Chiuf Directorate's American Department

(in the 1940's) .

operation on 26 February

1962, while discussing the iGB agent PREISFREUND.

said

that he first met PREISFREUND when the latter went to the

Soviet Embassy in Helsinki in connection with an application

for travel to the USSR.

On several later occasions, GOLITSYN

said, the two men had drinks together in Helsinki cafes.

According to GOLITSYN, PREISFREUND had been used in the recruit-

ment in Moscow of at least one Americän who

"could have been a

code clerk or a diplomat."

He also knew that the recruitment

had been accomplished

"in 1960, at the end of 1960" and that

PREISFREUND, having met the target at America House in Moscow,

had helped to set up the target for the recruitment approach

by involving him in speculatory activities and by arranging his

introduction to various KGB female agents. GOLITSYN thought

that PREISFREUND had dropped out of the case after "he had helped

to create the circumstances" and had not taken a direct part in

Thie request was refused with the

GOLITSYN could mean either Ionoshchik (assistant) or Zamestitel!

(deputy).

The CHERrPANOV papers snow

that KOVSHUK was Deputy

Chief of the Department as late us 1953.

NOSFiKO said that, as

a result of a drinking incident, KOVSHUK was demoted from De-

puty Chief of the imerican lepartrent to Chief of its American

Embassy Section in 1959 and heid this position until carly 1962.

GOLITSYN said he had known KOVSiUK for about ter. years and

characterized him as a capable officer with aboat 15 years of

KGB experience, at least ter of then in the Anerican Department,

Second Chief Directorate.

In about 1956,

according to COLITSYN,

KOVSHUK was handling KG3 agent Henry SHAPIRO.

CiA records show

that in addition, KOVSHUK was involved in the Moscow and Wash-

ington phases of the "AYDREY" case (he was idertified by Dayle

SMITTi; see Part VI.D. 3.b.) and in the jevelopment in Moscow of

CIA officer George

Part VI.D.?.C.).

**GOLIISYN's passport and travel records heid by CIA confirm that

COLITSYN travelled only twice to the soviet Union after his

arrival in. Helsinki on 20 July 1960.

The first of these trips

was on 19 January 1961, nhen he flew directly from Helsinki to

Moscow; he returned to Helsinki by rail a week later, on 28

January. GOLITSYN's second trip to the Soviet Union was from

9 to 15

April 1961, when he appears to have spent all of most

of this period in Leningrad.

A Finnish national, whom GOLITSYN

had been developing in Helsinki, has reported that he met with

GOLITSYN in Leningrad

on a daily basis

from 10 through 13 April

1961.

Moreover, GOLITSYN has never rentioned being in Moscow

during this time. ' Since GOLITSYN remained in Helsinki from

April until December 1961, when he defected, it appears that

he erred by one month in reporting the date of his conversa-

tions in the American Department and that he learned of the

second lead some

time during the week of 19 January 1961. This

ia the same conversation of which NOSENKO spoke several times

in 1962 and subsequently (see above) • NOSENKO has always

maintained that he was out of Moscow on leave at the time of

GOLITSYN's visit

and that this was in the summer of 1961. When

he was told in February. 1965 that GOLITSYN was in Moscow in:

January 1961, NOSENKO replied that CIA was either wrong of

was attempting to deceive him.

NOSENKO declined to change

his story of che summer leave.

(e) Information from other Sources

Infornation available to CIA indicates that the Attaches of:

the three U.S. military services represented in Moscow shared

a single cryptographic center as of 1960 and 1961 and that,

except for overlapping assignsents during periods of turnover,

there was normally only one military code clerk assigned to the

Embassy at any particalar time.

This military code clerx was

responsible for enciphering and deciphering the traffic of all

three military services.

In practice,

at least one other men-

ber of the Attache staff in Moscow has held a cryptographic

clearance and has been trained and has performed the function

of back-up for the military code clerk during periods of the

latter's absence from the Moscow Embassy or inability

to per-

form his functiong for other reasons.

STORSBERG

was the only military code clerk assigned to the

Moscow Embassy from February 1960, when his predecessor, Everett

HOBSON, was reassigned, until Septenber 1961, when his successor,

Mathew

ZUJl'S, arrived.

STORSBERG himself arrived in Moscow in

January 1960 and departed in November 1961.

During the period of STORSBERG's tour in Moscow, back-up

cryptographic duties were performed by the Military Communica-

tions Officer, CWO-2 HURLEY:

HURLEY performed these duties on

a number of occasions, including the night of the approach to

and he could be loosely termed a code clerk.*

tionally,

STORSBERG he performed repair work on the cryptographic machines

and directed certain other sensitive activities at the Embassy.

HURLEY's tour in Moscow began

shortly before STORSBERG's, in

December 1959, and he served there until June or July 1962.

The only other person performing official functions in the

military code root

the 1960-1961 period was James KEYSERS,

who arrived in Moscow on 22 December 1960 and was assigned to

the office of the Air Force Medical Officer.

As a concurrent

secondary assignment, KEYSERS worked as a clerk-typist in the

office of the Air Attache.

From february until mid-April 1961,

as a collateral duty, KEYSERS worked in the joint military code

room where

he was in training to serve as back-up cryptographer.

He was relieved of this duty in April 1961 for reasons of low

* Although NOSENKO has distinguished between STORSBERG's func-

tion as "military code clerk" and HURLEY's duties

as "mili-

tary code machine mechanic, he said on one occasion that

he considered both to be within the general category of

"military code clerks."

NOSENKO reported that there was no

KGB operation against HURLEY.

aptitude and lack of interest; in June 1961 he was removed from

Moscow because of reported homosexual activities.*

NOSENKO has described an operation against

KEYSERS (see

below), but because of the date of KEYSERS' arrival

in Moscow,

he must be ruled out as a candidate for the first of GoLIT-

SYN's two leads discussed above.

On

the basis of available

information, it appears that the subject of this lead must

have been either STORSBERG OF HURLEY, the only two "military

code clerks" in Moscow in the spring

of 19E0.

The subject

of COLITSYN's second lead could have been STOPSBERG, HURLEY.

or, in fact, anyone else at the Embassy, although GOLITSYN

suggested that he might be a code cleri and might be a mili-

tary man. By his statement that there was no KGB operation

against HURLEY, together with his description of the opera-

tion against STORSBERG beginning in the spring of 1960 and

his (and PREISFREUND'S) assertion that PREISFREUND took part

in only one operation for the KGB--that against STORSBERG--

NOSENKO has said in effect that both of GOLITSYN's leads were

to the STORSBERG operation, which ended in failure.

This con-

flicts with GOLITSYN's report that PREISFREUND was involved

in a successful recruitment operation in late 1960.

There are

also inconsistencies between the NOSENKO and GOLITSYN leads

as regards the progress of the operation.

GOLITSYN reported

that recruitment

code clerk was. "99 per cent" assured

in May-June 1960, whereas NOSENKO and PREISPREUND describe

an operation which, at best, was just becoming active at that

time.

GOLITSYN, in reporting his second lead, said that the

operation in which PREISFREUND participated culminated "in

late 1960;" NOSENKO reported that the only operation in which

PREISFREUND took part ended in an unsuccessful approach to

STORSBERG in "mid-1961" or, on other occasions, in "autumn

1961.

(111) TY'S UY ROSOLAPOV on Code Clerk Cases

Introduction

Accordirg to NOSENKO, the U.S.

Embassy Section officer

KOSOLAPOY travelled

only once to Helsinki, and KOSOLAPOV at:

that time succeeded in his mission of accompanying--togetr.er.

with a KGB female agent--a suspected American code clerk, Paul

Francis JENNER, by train to Moscow.

(The KGB later learned

that JENNER was not a code clerx but a pouch cleck who also met

couriers at the Moscow airport, HOSENKO said, and this KGB iden-

tification of JENNER's specialty is confirmed by U.S. Department

of State files.) Ine report by NOSENKO On KOSOLAPOV is contra-

dicted by two sources, travel records available to CIA and the

KGB defector GOLITSYN.

Statements made by JEUNER in 1960 and 1962 parallel those

of NOSENKO in 1964 and 1965 to the extent that two young soviets,

a man and a woman, did converse with him on the train, and later

JENER did encounter the same woman at a Moscow airport.

recoris contradict NOSENKO's statement that

KOSOLAPOV waS the Soviet male aboard the train with JENNER on the

"24-hour journey.

Although NOSENKO insisted that KOSOLAPOV was on a single

to Finland,

in early

1960, travel records show that KOSOLA-

(under a different identity) went to felsinki in both the

spring and fall of 1960.

Travel records on the second Helsinki

TDY by KOSOLAPCV, on which NOSENKO has not reported, are borne

Out bY GOLITSYN.

GOLITSYN said that KOSOLAPOV, in order to lay

the groundwork for a future relationship in Moscow, accompanied

a U.S. Embassy code clerk by train from Helsinki about November

1960, or perhaps as late as the beginning of 1961. Again on

the basis of travel records, it has been deterrined that on

16 November 1960 KOSOLAPOV was a fellow passenger of an Aterican

code clerk naned john w. GARLAND on the daily train from iel-

sinki to Moscow.

The following discussion of the TDY's of KOSOLAPOV is

divided into three parts:

KOSOLAPOV's false identity for

travel, the early 1950 TDY, and the November 1960 TDY.

Each

part incorporates the information from all sources, including

NOSENKO.

(b) Palse Identity for Travel

Vadin Viktorovich KOSOLAPOV was born in Perm' on 19 Febru-

ary 1928.

According to travel records, one Viktor Dmitriyevich

KOLOSOV, born in Perm'

on 19 March 1927, was in Finland from

31 March to 2 Fril 1960, in Finland from 12 to 16 Noverber 1960,

and in Dennark from 25 October to 1 November 1961.* In July 1965,

Johan PREISFREUID (see Part V.E.3.c.Ii. ;on STORSBERG operation)

identified for CIA a photograph of KOLOSOV as that of a KGB offi-

cer named Vadim (last name unknown) who approached him in Moscow

Before his arrival we had only the arketa, nothing

He was listed as secretary/archivist,* and

there was a date on this anketa which was the date

he was due to cross the finnish border--the middle

first name is Yeva, but I don't remember her last

name; her

code name was "SOLISTKA"

..•

She was placed

on the train in Vyborg as if she nad been visiting

someone there

and was returning to Moscow.

The main

idea was to place an agent near JENNER before he

even arrived in loscow.

We wrote a proposal to the

Chairman of the KGB giving the reasons for doing this.

We explained that we had usually only one year in

which to

work.

The agent "SOLISTKA"

met JENNER and

spoke with him.

KOSOLAPOV also became acquainted

with JENNER and spoke with him, cut I can't say that

they were all speaking together at ohe time. She

gave JENNER a telephone number.

Question:

A KGB telephone number?

NOSENKO:

Of course not; it was her own telephone number, but

he didn't call her.

We then noticed that he wasn't

working in the code room but in the mail room.

o.k..

that was interesting too.

We waited one or two

months for the call to come, but nothing happened.

When JENNER once went to the railroad station or

airport alone to meet the couriers, we sent her with

GRYAZNOV by car in an attempt to have them meet

again.

JENNER saw her but did not approach (her).

Instead, he turned in the other direction.

Only

later did we learn that he is a very quiet person.

There was nothing else on JENNER at all except a

suspicion that he may have been a homosexual, but

there was no proof.

He was like a child.

Question:

How much time did you have between the time of the

anketa's arrival and the time of JENNER's arrival?

NOSENKO: A month, plenty of time to prepare.

Question: A month?

NOSENKO:

Well, approximately a month.

The usual approval

from

the Central Committee was necessary so that

KOSOLAPOV could go abroad.

Question:

NOSENKO:

Who wrote this?

It was the idea of the group.

Did you advise KOSOLAPOV on what his role was to be

LAPOV, and maybe we discussed it with KOVSHUK on the

day: before KOSOLAPOV left.

The remaining information on KOSOLAPOV'S TDY in early 1960

comes from other sources:

- After arriving in Moscow on 1 April 1960, JENNER

reported that he was approached on the train from Helsinki

by two young

Russians,

"a boy and a girl, probably uni-

versity stusents."*

The tho

Russians struck

up a conver-

sation and were

soon baiting him on

the question of racial

discrimination in

the United States.

They

gaid that they

might see JENNER in Moscow.

About

three months later, on

29 June, JENNER was performing his normai duty of escort-

ing Enibassy

couriers to Sheremetevo Airport when he was

again approached by the russian girl, Yuli, who acted

surprised

to see him and asked him to go outside to

talk.

Yuli explained that she was waiting to say goodbye to

friend who was leaving on 3

flight to Irkutsk (JENNER had

seen

the Irkutsk flight depart

a half hour earlier) and

toid

JENNER that her male

companion on the train trip to

MOScOW, Yura,

had returned to his studies in Vyborg.

Interspersed

with Yuli's questions concerning JENNER'S

impressions and

personal activities in Moscow were others

about how often he came to the airport and how he liked

his job at the Embassy.

When JENNER said he must leave,

she gave him her telephone rumber in Moscow and insisted

that he call her.** She advised JENNER that "it would be

better if you did not mention our conversation to anyone."

- Besides information about his Soviet companions on

the Moscow journey, JENER also toid U.S. Department of

State security officials about sexual advances made by

his first maid in Moscow and about provocative clothing

worn by his second maid.

(NOSENKO has not indicated that

either of these two women was u KGB agent, but has said

in another context that all

maids of American code clerks

were KGB agents or informants.)

- CIA investigations showed that I. Ye. SERGEYEV,

KGB officer and

the

Soviet Consul in Helsinki, contacted

the police chief there on 31 March 1960 to ask his assist-

ance in locating

an American named Paul F. JENNER who was

due to arrive in Helsinki the day before.***

SERGEYEV

explained that he had some "business" with JENNER, but he

* KOSOLAPOV was 32 years of age at the time.

** NOSENKO has mentioned

several times that GRYAZNOV's agent

"SOLISTKA" gave JENNER her telephone number.

Intelligence agent from "about 1945 on."

che November 1960 TDY (GARLAND Case)

Apart from denying that it ever tock place, NOSENKO has said

about a trip to Helsinki by KOSOLAPOV in lovember 1950,

but GOLIISYN saiù

such a trip occurred and related it to an in-

cipient KGB operation against an American sode clerk.

COLITSYN was not posted to the KGB Legal Resicency in lel-

xini until July 1960, i.e., after KOSOLAPOV's first trip to

Helsinki, under

the KOLOSOV

He has reported that at

"about the end of 1960, about loverber of possibly ty the begin-

ning of 1961," the KGB Secord

Chief Direczorate sent a teleg:an

to the Helsinki Legal Residency.

Moscow; the responsible case officer would be KOSOLAPOV, Who

The following extracts are from the transcript of GOLITSYN's

further remarks on this subject in early 1962:

to Finland?

GOLITSYN: Came to Finland.

He came under cover?

GOLITSYN: Yes.

GOLITSYN:

Yes, as an employee of Trade Union (Vneshtorg) •

RGS-Polish IB Activities Against MORONE

Introduction

In 1961 CIA learned from a Polish source who furnished

much

reliable

and sensitive information that, with the assist-

ance of its Polish counterpart, the Office of Security (UB),

the KGB in November 1960 began

using a female agent against

Joseph MORONE, a U.S. Department of State code clerk assigned

to the Anerican Embassy in Moscow in August 1960.

The woman

accompanied MORONE on a train trip from loscow, became inti-

mate with him in warsaw, returned to Moscow twice in February

1961, and there had sexual relations with him.

The compromising

scenes of MORONE and the Polish UB agent were

photographed.

This information

on the KGB operation was received by CIA soon

after the winan's second visit to Moscow.

on the basis of this

report, MORONE was interviewed and polygruphed in Oslo in May

i961, and he was transferred to Lisbon from Moscow in August

1961.

NOSENKO gave a few details on the

same case, without men-

tioning the name of the KGB target, during the 1962 meetings in

Geneva.

In 1964 and 1965 he furnished more particulars on

the

MORONE case, identifying three KGS agents (besides the polish

female) who participated in the operation. NOSENKO, however,

said that two of them added no information of use to the KGB

against MORONE, and that he was unable

to remember what the third

agent reported: statements by other sources indicate thai re-

garding MORONE

all three agents could have acquired information

of operational potential

for the KGy.

NOSENKO has not reported,

as have other sources,

that. a fourth

KGB agent named Ella UMANETS

was in contact with MORONE, or that the KGB officer SKVORTSOV-

posing as MICHAUD--was with MORONE at America House on at least

one occasion, the night when STORSBERG says he was

approached

by the KGB (see above) • NOSENKO has confused the MORONE case

with another by saying

that a fifth KGB agent was directed

against MORONE, whereas she was apparently directed against the

American code clerk ZUJUS (see below).

The sensitive source of

the original report on MORCNE stated

that a KGB officer "VOLODYA"

(Vladimir,

last name unknown) personally met the Polish female

agent when she arrived in Moscow, and NOSENKO said that the

officer was his subordinate KOSOLAPOV.

NOSENKO at first

claimed a KGB photographic technician supporting the case re-

ported to him, but he retracted this remark after CIA showed

him that travel records on NOSENKO made it impossible for the

technician to have spoken to him as he described.

According to

NOSENKO, MORONE was reassigned from Moscow before the KGB could.

take further steps against the code clerk, and he speculates

MORONE's transfer was prompted by American authorities'

concern

over his relationship with one of the KGB female agents.

(b)

NOSENKO's Information

At his first meeting with CIA on 9 June 1962 NOSENKO made

a passing reference to an operation in which he had placed a

female agent of the Polish

service in contact with an Anerican

from the Moscow Embassy while the latter was visiting warsaw.

Later, NOSENKO said, he brought the same female to Moscow. in

order

to obtain further compromising materials on this Anerican.

Asked on Il June 1962 whether he had had foreign agents

working against the

U.S. Embassy, NOSENKO described his having

introduced the idea of using such agents to develop Americans.

afraid of contacts with Russian girls. He said that he himself

had several of these third-national agents, that he sometimes

would ask

the German and Polish services to supply him with

agents,

and that it was unnecessary for him to explain their

interded use in operations against Americans:

NOSENKO thei

gave ar. example:

"Listen,

lived in America House had a custom--it was too far to go-to

America,

Although the KGB had the compromising photography, it was

felt that' there were

insufficiant materials for a resruitment

approach

to морон.

The KGB warted to trap him in the apart-

ment of a Soviet

rioran,

to

catch him in something that is defi-

nitely prohibited.

For this purpose, Svetlana IVILOVA

(see

above)

was supposed to lure MOPCiE into the city, but before

anything fürther could be done, the Americans ordered MORONE

out of Moscow before the end of his tour, possibly because they

were concerned about his association with IVANOVA. Therefore,

NOSENKO said, the KGB made no operational approach to MORONE

and no recruitnent of him.

sensitive Polish source reported in 1961 that on 8 Novem-

case officer named "VOLODYA."

She stayed at the hotel Warsaw

in Moscow.

The VGB case officer, apparently from the American

Department of the KGB Second Chief Directorute, on 10 November

1969 pointed MORONE out to this agent at a railroad station in

MOSCOW.

Under KGB insisuctions, the Folish female met MORONE

on

the

train to warsaw, where intimacies began.

In Warsaw on

12 November 1960 she was quite friendly with moroliz, but pur-

suant to instructions,

she refused all overtures to

engage in

intimacies.

The next

day she took MORONE to a Polish UB safe-

house suitably prepared

for

clandestine photography, and reveal-

ing photographs of an intimate nature were

taken of MORONE

and hersert.

The fenale agent again travelled to Moscow on

5 February 1961 and stayed at the Peking Hotel. Further com

promising photographs were taken of her and MOPONE on this

trip.

The female

agent travelled to Moscow a third time and

on 12 and 13 February 1961 more photographs were taken of her

and MORONE.

GOLITSYN was questioned on the basis of this lead on

He was asked whether he was sure of his

ryes.

He just cannot be in Moscoi."

NOSENKO telephoned the Geneva safehouse on 2 February

something important to

The meeting with ClA opened

as follows:

In other words, everything I said about ZUJUS applies to

KEYSERS."

"I don't remenber having any face-to-face encounters

(with Americans)

except then KEYSERS was

leaving," NOSENKO

stated on 17 April 1964, "When he was being taken to the

airport we decided,

"Why not try, in case he's aione; why

not approach him and ask hin if he wants to stay?'

And Sure

enough he stood there with these two officers and then he

walked into the restaurant alone...

So I innediately ap-

proached him right there in the restaurant.

"I don't se-

nesber what his name was--i think it was Jis.) So I said"

•Jis, did you think about staying perhaps?

Because you

He looked at me and turned around and without saying a word

he went into the walting roon and started tallang rapidly

vich the officers."

d. NOSENKO's ReEponsibility for Coverage of AbIDIAN

(1) Introduction

John V. ABIDIAN served as the U.S. Embassy Security Officer

in Moscow from 2 March 1960 until February 1962, approximately

the U.S. Enoissy

Section of the American Department, Second Chief Directorate.

During his Moscow tour. ABIDIAN was coopted by CIA to perfora a

number of operational tasks, including clandestine letter reilings

to several CIA agents inside the Soviet Urion and servicing a

dead drop to be used only for receiving two special types of

communications* from the source in the GRU, Colonel O.V. PENKOV-

SKIY.

During his 1962 meetings. with CIA, NOSENKO mentioned ABIDIAN

on several occasions,

Identifying him as the Embassy Security

Officer and as a CIA officer.

In 1962 he described ABIDIAN'S

letter metling aettvittes, and he said he was himself concerned

(zanimat' bya) with ABIDIAN.

Aftes resontacting CiA in Geneva in

January 1964 NOSENKO divulged that he had been the KGB case

officer rusponsible for coverage of AbIDIAN in Moscow; for the

first time he described then a visit made by ABIDIN to the

PENKOVSKIY dead drop site.

The discussion below is divided into three paris:

NOSENKO ' &

case officer responsibilities and the information he learned

about ABIDIAN, NOSENKO'& knowledge of clardestine letter mallings

by ABIDIAN, ard NOSENKO's statements on ABIDIAN änd the Pushkin

Street dead drop.

(11) Duties as Case Officer

On 17 April 1964 when asked to describe his transfer from

the Hourist Department to the American Department in January

1960, NOSENKO said that when he reported for duty and was inter-

viewed by V. A. KLYPIN, Chief of the American Department, and

V.M. KOVSHUK, Chief of

the U.S. Embassy Section, he was told

that

as one of his duties he

would be the case officer in charge

of ABIDIAN, whose arrival in Moscow was expected in the near

future.

NOSENKO was the only KGB officer responsible for cover-

age of and activities against ABIDIAN and, NOSEliKO said, ABIDIAN

was the only American target for whom he, personally, was offi-

cially accountable while in the U.S. Embassy Section.

NOSENKO was questioned in detail concerning ABIDIAN for

six days in January and February 1965.

He produced the infor-

mation in the following paragraphs at that time.

When NOSENKO began to work in the U.S. Embassy Section,

ABIDIAN had not yet arrived in Moscow.

The section, however,

already had received some information

on him, and this was given

to NOSENKO by KOVSHUK. Among this material was ABIDIAN'& VISA

One type was early-warning information, the other notifi-

cation of his forthcoming absence from Moscow.

as of this time, PENKOVSKIY submitted information in

Moscow via contacts with the British Embassy and the

British businessman. Greville WittE.

application, the negative results of checis of KGB Headquarters

files, and a report prepared by the American Department of the

First Chief Directorate.

iscording to this report, based on

correspordence from the KGB Legal Residencies in the United

States, ABIDIAN had served as a Departmen: of State Security

Officer concerred with the personal safety of Premier KHRUSHCHEV

when he visited the United States in 1959:

from the way ABIDIA

had acted at that time, the Legal Residences concluded he has an

intelligence officer, probably with CIA."

NOSENKO remarked that

the report, combined with the fact that ABIDIAN was replacing the

known

CIA officer Russell LAVCELLE as Security Officer, made

ABIDIAN One

of the most important counterirtelligence targets

of the U.S. Embassy Section and therefore of the entire Second

Chief Directorate.

NOSENKO personally opened the KGB file on ABIDIAN and later

assigned him the cryptonym "'ARSEN,

"since this cryptonym had been

used by personnel of the Sevench (Surveillance) Directorate,

KGB Second Chief Directorate, Who were working against him,

NOSENKO was unsuccessful in his attempts to learn more about

the life and career of

ABIDIAN.

He visited the Chief of the

American Department of the KCB First Chier Directorate, but this

unit had no information in acdition to that already included in

the original information report.

NOSENKO requested that the KGB

Legal Residencies

in the United

States be asked for further de-

tails;

but they were never received.

For these reasons, NOSENKO

said that he did not know and never

obtained details about ABID-

IAN's education and study abroad: date of entry into the Depart-

ment of State, promotions, personal rank. previous foreign assign-

ments, military service.

or Status as Foreign Service Reserve,

Staïf

or Officer (FSR. FSS, FSO),**

records indicate that ABIDIAN studied in Paris in 1949-50

and then secured employment with the Department of State as

a clerk/typist.

He remained in Paris until 1954, After spe-

cial training at the CIC school at Fort Holabird

Secret Service School, ABIDIAN served from 1956 until leaving

for Moscow in 1960

as a special

agent in the State Depart-

ment's office of Security.

A iarge part of his work in this

period was arranging the security of

and accompanying foreign

dignitaries visiting the United States.

These included the

visits of Soviet Foreign Minister SHEPILOV in November 1956,

MIKOYAN in the spring of 1959, and KHRUSHCHEV at the end of

1959. These duties undoubtedly brought ABIDIAN into contact

with a large number of KGB offisers stationed in New York and

Washington.

One of the members of the KHRUSHCHEV entourage

was KOSOLAPOV who, according to NOSENKO, joined the U.S.

Embassy Section in late 1959 and, as of January 1960, became

NOSENKO's subordinate in operations against American code

clerks.

**NOSENKO was unaware of the meaning of the initials FSR, ESS,

and FSO. When asked whether he had checked the Department

of State Biographic Register for information on ABIDIAN'S:

background, he replied that this publication is not available

in: the U.S. Embassy Section. ' He subsequently recalled that

the Chief. of the Section; KOVSHUK, did have a copy dated:

about 1956, which was of no use in gathering information on

ABIDIAN.

arrival..

He was always under 24-hour surveiliance by it icast

so that at any hour a team was

available to cover him if he left the U.S. Embassy.

Tre only

time this intensity of covirage might have beer. Irduced, NOSENKO

said, was during a perioù of about one and one-hale months in

1961, wren surveillance of the inbossy was gererally reduced in

order to allow increased coverage of tritish targets.*

ABIDIAN ard evaluated the operationai

This plan,

Embassy Section, was to continue to

said she way GAVRILEYKO'S agent and that she was valuable be-

cause she haa a good education and was able to provide per-

sorality sketches or her students. He did not associate her

with ABIDIAN until he was told by his interrogators in Febru-

ary 1965 that ABIDIAN had been one of her students.

NOSENKO

then made the above statement concerning these lessons. ABIDiA.

reported that he took regular language lessons from GROMOKOVA,

normally three one-half hour lessons a week. beginning shortly.

after his arrival in Moscow and continuing until his departure.

The first few lessons were with a group of

other Embassy per-

* sonnel,

and then ABIDIAV switched to priväte lessons for the

remainder of his tour in the soviet Union:

In reporting his

contacts with GROMUKOVA, ABIDIAN said he refused to be drawn

into talking about his Embassy responsibilities during Russian

language conversation but kept the topic limited to his past

personal life, travel, education.

AbIDIAN also reported that on

When informed that ABIDIAi gave "KAYO" his

a relationship with ABiDIAN.

After arguing that this was agairst

actior against

ABIDIA, KOVSHUK and KLYPIN finally agreed, and "KAMO" phored

ABIDIt twice on KGB Instructions.

ABIDIAN, however, refused to

NOSENKO did not know the room number of ABIDIAN's office in

the Embassy or on what floor it was located,. but said that he

could check the room number if necessary since he had a copy of

nor how it was furnished,

He said that

he did not consider data of this nature to be operationally

significant unless the target had shown vulnerabilities or was

about it because the foreign legal Residencies of the KgB First

Chief Directorate would not accept a rejuest for operational

action against an merican diplomat coming fron Moscow.

In February 1965 NOSENKO was asked a number of times

whether he knew of ary occasions on which ha:plil took trips in

the Soviet Urion outside of Moscow.

He replied each time that he

knew of no such trips and that if

ABIDIAN had made such a trip or

trips he would have known of them and would remember then as it

would have beer his responsibility as case officer to take cer-

tain actions.

- Receivirg notification of ABIDIAl's request to travel

from the UPDi (the Soviet Government organization which pro-

vides services to tre alplomatic cormurity in Moscow).

- Notifying the UPDK Of KGB approval for the trip.

-notifying appropriate local KGB offices on ABIDIAN'S

itirerary and giving them instructions for surveillance and

other operational activity if desired.

- Recelving. reading, and filing all surveillance

reports

and lepolis

of

other operational activity carried

out by locak iGb units.

NOSENKO was certain that he took none of these steps.

He stated

further that even if he were absent when such

a request for travel

was made, he would have seen all docunents upor. his return and

that he did not retember seeing such cocuments in ABIDIAN's file.

NOSENVO's interrogators then cola NOSENKO that ABIDIAN

travelled out of Moscow from 5 to 9 October 1950.*

Thereupon

NOSENKO stated that he specifically recalled having been on leave

in October 1950.

He said that he could not resall exactly the

dates of this leave (which he had rot mentioned before!, but he

did remember that he was away exactly 30 days since he stayed at

a dacha near Moscow and therefore was not allowed any travel

time.

NOSENKO said further that he also remenioered that he had

ABIDIAN made a trip with Paul A. SMITH, the Embassy's Publi-

cations Procurement Officer, to Armenia between 5 and 9 Octo-

(ABIDIAN is of Armeniar origin, and speaks the

Armenian

language with a high degree of proficiency.) while

there ASIDIAN visited with various churchren and their

parishioners ard an Armenian who had repatriated from Greece

in 1946.

the anniversary of the accession of the Katolikos VAZGEN I.

and ABIDIAN also visited some relatives of his in or near

the city of Yerevan. After returning to moscow, an Armenian.

at the Embassy: but ABIDIAN refused to see him.

When NOS-

ENKO was told

that on 7 October 1960 ASIDIAN attended a ser-

vice celebrating the fifth anniversary of the Armenian Kato-

likos, VAZGEN I, NOSENKO recalled that ABIDIAN. had gone to

Echmiadzin and

that an agent had reported a contact with him

there.

This agent, NUSENKO recalled, was a priest of a monk.

and the report concerned only his conversation with ABIDIANg

the agent had no further contact with him...

suggested that FEDOROVICH may have occasionally cleaned

ABIDIAN'S Servicing of the Pushkin Street Dead Drop

In 1964 NOSENKO told CIA for the firse time that KGB sur-

weillarce had observed a visit by iBIDIAN to a probable dead

drop on Pushkin Street in Moscor a= the erd of 1960. This dead

drop figured prominently in the PErKOVSKIY case.

NOSENKO's first remarks on this subjece were made on 20 April

1964:

"I left Lthe U.S. Embassy Section/ ir 1962.

There was an

interesting move.

This address where JACOES" was caught in the

PENKOVSKIY case - the same address was visited by ABIDIAN in

1960, or at the beginning of 1961.

And at that time I went there

together with LV. AL KOZLOY, the Chier of the Surveillance

Directorate.

LM. G./ MAIVEYEV LDeputy cries of the merican

Department/ also went there with us.

We went to that address

several times, at Pushkin Street.

it was very interesting, this

radiator and

everything,

but the

orly thing we did there was to

place an obsorvation post there.

and that pont was there for

about three morths

after

That was in 1960,

They watched for three morths.

be occupied there for 24 hoirs every day.

I was there

then Lin the U.s. Embassy Section for the ertire time that sur-

veillance was watching the Pushkin Street site/...

At the be-

ginning I came there two or three times.

I came there with

MATVEYEV once, twice with KOVSllUk; "e came there with Venyanin

KOZLOV...

But no one appeared here and so they were not writing

anything meaning that the Surveillance Directorate was not sub-

mitting written reports/.

No one appeared.

That's why,

only

orally, KOZLOV was saying 'nothing.'

" week passed - 'nothing,'

the next week passed

'nothing'... I shall tell you why ¿i

didn't mention this to you in June 1962/. Because I had

occasiong where there were many such places, and they were

wetched for nothing.

And it would just pass away and in a

month it would be forgotten..•

So we waited a month, two,

three.

Nothing. So they let it go at that and had forgotten.

Of course, the surveillance team had it all recorded. but we

had forgotten about that in the First LAmerican/ Department...

In 1962, I was in the Seventh /Tourist/ Department.

I trans-

ferred in January 1962."

On the basis of information supplied by NOSENKO during

April 1964, he was questioned during January and February 1965

on ABIDIAN's visit to Pushkin Street.

The following, which is

consistent with and somewhat more detailed than earlier state-

ments not recorded here, is taken from these 1965 interroga-

tions:

- In 1951, while NOSENKO das the responsible case

officer, the KGB followed ABIDIAN from

the U.S.

embassy

to a residential building on Pushkin Street in Moscow.

A stationary

surveillance post at the Embassy saw ABIDIAN

leave with the Publications Procurement Officer of the

Embassy in a chauffeured autonobile.. rather than in the

car he normally used.

The surveillance team assigned

specIfIcally to ABIDIAN thereupon followed the car to

& bookstore. Both Americans entered the bookstore, but

Richard JACOB, a CIA officer, was apprehended while servic

ing the Pushkin Street dead drop on 2 November 1962.

shortly thereafter ABIDIAN left alone.

He walked arourd

the corner and

entered a residential building next to a

meat market on Pushkin Street.

ABIDIAN emerged after a

few seconds.

The surveillarge team saw him go in but did

not follow him.

This unusual incident was reported by

the surveillance team to the KGB Seventh (Surveillance)

Directorate, and the building was inspected that same day

by the Chief of the First Department of the Surveillance

Directorate, KOZLOV, together with the Deputy Chief of the

American Department of the KGB Second Chief Directorate,

MATVEYEV.

Taking into account the character of the building

and its

inhabitarts, the duration and circumstances of

ABIDIAN'S

visit.

and the suitability of the hallway -

particularly the radiator in it - for use as a dead

drop

site, it was decided by the leadership of the Second Chief

Directorate and the Surveillance Directorate that a station-

ary surveillance post should immediately be set up to cover

this location. Because of the short time available, It was

not possible to place this post inside the building.

so it

was set up across the street,

In addition, the raciator.

was checked daily to see if anything, such as a macnetic

container, had been concealed behind it.

This stationary

post was maintained

around the clock for 30 days,

after

which it was

maintained from 0800 until midnight for another

two months.

If a package or magnetic container had been

found behind the radiator, which was checked every morning,

it was planned to attach to it very thin wires to trigger

a signal should someone remoye the package.

At the sane

time a member of the surveillance team would be stationed

on the landing

of the staircase in this building, out of:

sight from the

hallway below.

During the three months

that the post was maintained, nothing was found concealed

behind the radiator, nor were any suspicious persons seen

entering or leaving

the building.

The post was then dis-

continued, but the

address was placeá on a list of sus-

picious places inspected daily by the Surveillance Direc-

torate.

The true significance of this location became

known to the KGB only later, after the arrest of PENKOV-

SKIY in 1962.

- NOSENKO first heard of ABIDIAN's visit to the sus-

pected dead drop

the day it occurred.. He was

sitting in KOVSHUK's office when he received a telephone

call from MATVEYEV telling him of the incident. Although

NOSENKO was ABIDIAN's case officer and KOVShUK was Chief

of the U.S. Embassy Section, the decision to place the

stationary surveillance post on this location was made at

a higher level: neither of them was involved in it or in

the later decision to discontinue the post.

self visited the building on Pushkin Street the following

day or the day after, but he remained only a few minutes

and did not recall any details of the hallway, except that

there was a radiator there:

- As ABIDIAN 's

case officer, NOSENKO recalled re-

ceiving the surveillance report of his visit to the

Pushkin Street building and placing this report in

ABIDIAN 's file.

(This is the case file which NOSENKO

turned over to his successor, CRYAZNOV, about 28-28 December

1961, just before he transferred to the Tourist Department.)

- NOSENKO received no written reports on the results

of the stationary surveillance post.

but he did discuss

this matter with KOZLOV on an almost daily basis during

the first month of surveillance, periodically after that.

These discussions took place either by telephone.

or when

KOZLOV was visiting NOSENKO's office, or when NOSENKO

visited #OZLOV's office in KGB Headquarters.

FrOM KOZLOV

or perhaps someone

else, NOSENKO learned that the post hed

been discontinued after 90 days.

Un the basis of these

conversations with KOZLOV, NUSENKO knew that nothing of

interest occurred during the period of the stationary sur-

veillance.

- NOSENKO was in the U.S. Embassy Section during all

the period that the stationary surveillance-post was watch-

ing the Pushkin Street site and was there when he heard

from KozLow that the post had been replaced by periodic

inspections.

- NOSENKO did not report this incident of surveillance

on the Pushkin Street dead

drop site to his CIA contacts

in Geneva in June 1962 because the post had already been

discontinued by this time without anything unusual or sus-

picious having been noted.

Therefore he thought that this

incident would not be particu arly interesting to the CIA.

CIA records show that ABIDIAN visited the Pushkin Street

dead

drop site only

once.

on 30 December 1961, a year later than

NOSENKO sayS,

in response to an apparent signal from PENKOVSKIY.

The sequence of events was as follows:

On 27 December 1961,

following reccipt of what seemed to be the prearranged signal

from PENKOVSKIY that the drop had been loaded.

Air Force Captain

Alexis DAVISON drove from his apartment to the U.S. Embassy to

alert ABIDIAN. At about 2100 hours the same night, ABIDIAN

left in his own car for Spasso House, the Ambassador's residence

where a dance was in progress, to tell the CIA Chief of Station,

Paul GARBLER, about the signal. ABIDIAN and GARBLER left Spasso

House with the other guests at akout 0200 on 28 December in

ABIDIAN's car and drove past the telephone pole where, as part

of his "drop loaded" signal, PENKOVSKIY was to leave a mark.

Later in the morning of 28 December, ABIDIAN, again in his own

car drove from the Embassy to DAVIDSON's apartment, where he

first checked the telephone pole visually from the window and

then walked by it for a closer examination.

Although it was

not certain that the telephone calls received on 27 December

had, in fact, been a signal from PENKOVSKIY and although no

supplementary mark was found on the telephone pole, a decision

was reached to check the drop.

Therefore, at 1115

on 30 Decem-

ber 1961, ABIDIAN with Julian F. MacDONALD, an Enbassy Economics

Officer.

left the Embassy in an official car with a Soviet

At 1130 ABIDIAN entered the building where the drop

left one minute later..

recent account; NOSENKO had transferred from the U.S. Embassy

Section to the Tourist Department about 28 Decenber 1961 and

that his participation in a Tourist Department approach to

American citizen Wi. E: JOHNSON on 5 January 1962 had been con-

firmed by JOHNSON himself.

Therefore. NOSEiKO was told, much

of what he had told CIA about his own role in the Pushkin

Street affair became untenable.

NOSENKO'S IESpONSE tO this

observation is described

in Part V.F. 3., Which discusses

NOSENKO's approach to JOHNSON.

Also during the February 1965 interrogationg NOSENKO refused

to sign the page

of a protocol which read as follows:

"I have teen

told by my interrogators that ABIDIAN's

only visit to the Pushkin

street site took place on 30 DEC-

ember 1961.

Therefore, I was told that:

a.

I could not have placed the surveiilance

report in ABIDIAN's case file because I had already

turned over the file to GRYAZiOV.

b. I could not have received

reports about the

stationary surveillance unile still ABIDIAN's case

officer,

since I was already in the Seventh Depart-

ment in January 1962.

c.

The three month period in which the sur-

veillance post was watching

the Pushkin Street

site

did not expire until 30 March 1962 - more then two

weeks after I left for Geneva.

Thus I could not have known in June 1962 that the surveil

lance of the dead drop site had failed to produce results

or that it had been discontinued."

Although he acknowledged having reported to CIA on his involve-

ment with ABIDIAN as summarized in the protocol, NOSENKO said

the way in which the protocol was prepared made him "look sillj."

On no other occasion has NOSENKO refused to sign protocols

dealing with other subjects.

NOSENKO was questioned further during October 1966 concern-

ing ABIDIAN's visit to Pushkin Street. NOSENKO -eaffirmed that

ABIDIAN was under special survellance coverage throughout his

Moscow tour and that this surveillance detected his travel from

the U.S. Embassy to Pushkin Street and back; he would date this

only as "sometime in 1961." NOSENKO was asked whether KGB sur-

veillance had detected any unusual movements by ABIDIAN during

the period just preceeding his visit to the PENKOVSKIY drop

site la reference to his movements on 27 and 28 December 1961

as described above).

He replied that he knew definitely that

gurveillance had reported nothing unusual and added that

ABIDIAN had not succeeded in losing the KGB gurveillance at

any time during this period.

On 20 October 1966 NOSENKO was asked why, in his opinion,

at the time he did.

In re-

sponse, he told CIA for the first time that in about 1960 an

the suitability of the proposed site.

he was asked on 20 October 1966 whether he had visited

the Pushkin Street address

NOSENKO replied: "I don't

As previously indicated, NOSENKO said that on the same day

ARIDIAN was observed on Pushkin Street (i.e., on 30 December

1961) the Chief of the KGB Surveillance Directorate, KOZLOV,

inspected the Pushkin Street buildsthe United States from.

The FBI had reported

however. that Kozlov was on

gore to the dead drop site

on the day NosaNKo said he did.

the pushkin Street dead drop site was proposed by PENKOV-

SKIY himself in the August 1960 letter by which he initi-

ally contacted CIA. The only known visits by Americans to

this address and the only ones connected with its use as a

dead drop location occurred on 12 November and 4 December

1960, when CIA officer Eugene MAHONEY checked the address

from the outside, and on 21 January 1961, when MAHONEY

returned and entered the building to check the precise

dead drop location.

Knowiedge of the Target

(1) Introduction

His position and duties as seputy Chiof and sonetimes

Acting Chief gave NOSENKO aCCess to,

and required hin to

knos, the axtent of the U.S. Embassy Section's knowledge

of its target.

He has therefora beun questioned at length

by CIA about the locationg and occupents of the Embascy

offices as hell as about the Embassy personnel whom the KGB

had identified as CIA officers.

The information fron

NOSENKO on these two topics is presentud below.

(11)

Physical Premises

NOSENKO has said that tie krowledgo of the physical

layout of the Embassy cerives both from his genciäl super-

aisory function during 1960 and 1961 and fron nis respon

sibilities as the officially registerod custodian of the

KGb's file on the security of the Erbasay.

According to

NOSINTRO, he recelved the latter from his chief, ko!shok,

when he arrived in the section in January 1960; shortly

thereafter he arranged by a phore call to the Secretariat

of the Second Chief Directorate to have custody transferred

officially to his name fron that of M.f. BAKHVALOV, his

predecessor as Deputy Chief of Section.

NOSENKO explained

that aAKAVALOV had already left the soction by this time

but that, under KGB pIcse lures, it las permissisle for an

officer to remain official custodian of a file belonging

to the U.S. Embassy Section, even after leaving the imerican

Department, so long

as he remained

in the Second Chief

Directorate.

Until he turred this

file over to GRYAZNOV

approximately duriny the pariod 25 to 28 December 1961, no

one eise had access to it other than KOVSHU, Chief of

the

section, and GRYAZNOV and KOSOLAPO!, who shared the office

and safe where this file was kept.

NOSENKO stated in February 1965 that he had never

studied the contents, nor had he paid any special attention

to this file.

he would necessarily have been in a

position to knor,

NOSENKO also said he is certain that no

operational analysis or

planning by himself or others was

done on the basis of this file during his to years in the

section.. The file consisted of two volumas, one for the old

building on Mokhovaya Street and the second--about one inch

thick--concerning the new Embassy building on Chaykovskiy

street, which was occupied in 1953. It was used only for

reference purposes, for the KGB had concluded that it was

impossible for a Soviet Citizen to penetrate the secure

areas. of the Embassy because. of the security precautiong in

effect.

Apart from these

file-custodial duties, NOSENKO was

generally interested in the floor plans of the Embassy.by

virtue of his position as Deputy. Chief of the section.

HOSENKO's knowledge of the Embassy premises is reflected n

the CIA debriefing of February 1965, and these statarenta

are given in the next paragraphs.

areas were of special interest to the Kus.

NOSENKO knew

no kGB employees who enterad tha secure arcas during

1960 or 1961 and had no personal contact with any of then.

He did not remember any information that such KGs employees

ever reported to the KGB, except that Dmitriy I. KUKOLEV,

an electrician whöm he personally handled in 1954-1955,

had observed antenna wiring in the attic, the details or

significance of the wiring were unknown to NOSENKO as of

1965.

NOSENKO personally piaced some reports by KGB agents

in the Embassy security file while he had custody of it.

None of the Information, he said, was interesting, lm-

portant, or useful enough for him to remember, and he

could not name the agent sources of the KGB.

(211) CIA Personnel Under Embassy Cover

According to NOSENKO, the Americans at the U.S. Embassy

of grastest counterintelligence interest to the KGB section

were the identified CIA officers.

when questioned on

Septerber 1954 corcerning his knowledge of intelligence por-

sonnel assigned to the Embassy in 1960 and 1961, NOSENKO

stated that the KGB immediately listed any officer associated

with the offices of U.S. Armed Forces Attaches as a member

of American Militaly Intelligence and any diplomat.as

meaning

and that the sane probably held true for the Ambassador and

the Marine guards.

HAHONEY arrived in Moscow on 1 Öctober 1960 as the

Assistant General Séfvices Officer at the U.S. Embassy.

His specific CIA mission there was to support the handling

of PENKOVSKIY inside the

Soviet Union.

MAHONEY lived in

America House.

From the start of his tour he was active in

his attempts to faniliarize himself with loscow and he

frequently toured various areas of the city on foot. In

checking locations connected with the PENKOVSKIY case.

MAHONEY

went to the Pushkin Street dead drop location

on

two occasions during Novenber and December 1960,

and he

nade a thorough examination of the dead drop itself

as

well as of its related signal site on 21 January 1961.

Throughout, MAHONEY was subjected to intensive KGB surveil-

lance.

In a report dated 25 October 1960, ABIDIAN

сош-

mented on this as follows:

"I find this type of coverage

(five surveillants on a recent trip to the barlier shop)

completely out of character with that which is usually

given a new arrival of similar rank.. My only inference

is that the KGB has at least strong

primary role (ClA officer.

As

suspicions of MAHONEY's

for

surveillance on my-

gelf, it continues to be occasional and extrenely discreet."

George BLAKE, the KGB penecration of MI-6, was arrested

in London on 11 April 1961.

In his confession

he said

that

he had passed the KGB a master list of the

names of persons

connected with the joint U.S.-British project with which

MAHONEY had been connected in Frankfurt, as well as other

materials on this project. On this basis, "'AHONEY was

relieved shortly thereafter of further duties connected with

support of the PENKOVSKIY operation; he was withdrawn fron

Moscow in September 1961, less than a year after his arrival.

of 1955, he resigned his naval commission, and in May 1956

he was

assigned as a ClA officer to the U.S. Embassy in

Stockholm.

GARBLER served there until August 1959 in the

cover position of Second Secretary and Political Officer

(FSR) .

On 3. June 1961, he returned to active duty with the Navy,

and on 31 August 1961 his appointment was announced as

Assistant Javal Attache to lloscow, with the rank of Commander.

In. September 1961 his official biugraphic data was forwarded

to the office of the Soviet Naval Attache in Washington, who

had requested this information, and the same month GARBLER

made an official call at the Soviet Embassy.

GARBLER arrived

in Moscow on 29 November

1961. He was the CIA Chief of

Station there.

Prior to his affiliation with CIA, GARBLER served in

Korea and there was acquainted with George BLAKE.

1960 GARBLER was a participant in joint CIA-HI-6 discussions

in Washington on the question of tourist operations into

the Soviet Union (see Part V.D.8); BLAKE, who had access

to information on the agenda and participants for these talks,

admitted after his arrest in 1961 that he had photographed

Electronic Operations Against the U.S. Exbassy

(1) Introduction

NOSENKO had three basic pleces of infornation on KGB

aud 1o

and other elcctronic operationg

against the U.S. Em-

bassy in Moscow:

The preseace of nicrophones in the

chancery building, the absencé of audio-technical devices

In the north wing of the Embasay, and the existence of a

bean which monitors and jans transnissions fros the Embassy.

These are discused separately below.

Except for knowing

that a resonant cavity

(wireless) nicrophone had been found

in the American Ambassador's residence in 1953,

NOSENKO

said he was unaware of audio

surveillance devices and tech-

niques (other than the chancery nicrophones) in use against

the Embassy, nor did he know of any material produced by

such measures.

NOSENKO told CIA on 14 May 1964 that, to.

the best of his knowledge, there ree no wireless micro-

phones (1.e., carrier transmitters and radio transmitters)

in the Embassy,* His Information on KGB electronic opera-

SENKO said, he learned only that audio installations

existed.

(11) Microphones in the Chancery

Frequently described by NOSENKO as his most important

information, the microphones in the chancery büilding

were

first mentioned by him during the 1962 meetiogs in Geneva.

In these and subsequent debrielings NOSENKO reported in de-

tail on the ways in which he acquired this infornation, on

the number and locations of the microphones, the quality of

reception, and the value of production.

sumed (in agreement with the KGB defector COLITSYN) that

they were installed prior to 1953, when the chancery was oc-

cupied by U.S. Government representatives.**

microphones listed by NOSENKO, he has stressed the lapor-

tance of the one in the office of the Minister Counsellur,

the existence of which was earlier reported by GOLITSYN and

subsequently confirmed by technical investigations.

1962 NOSENKO sald that the audibility of the nine-year-old

#NOSENKO stated that the KGB knew the identity of American

counter-audio technicians and therefore turned off the micro-

phones whenever any of them arrived at the Embassy.

Since

a alcrophone-and-vire system cannot be turned off,

this re-

mark suggests aither that there was an external power sOurCe

for the microphones, which NOSENKO has not mentioned, or.

that NOSENKO hinself did not have rudimentary knowledge of

such natters.

system

varied from very clear ito zero; he said in 1964

that the quality was deteriorating and that "in a year or

two they (the microphones) will be coupletoly inoperative. "

Althougt the microphones

produced a great deal of politi-

cal intelligence, NOSENKO said, he found nothing worthwhile

for use against U.S. code clerks or others u? operational

interest to him.**

All pertinent details fron NOSENKO and

other sources on the microphone system in the chancery

büilding is presented in the foli wing portions of this

paper.

(a) NOSENKO ' s

Sources

Nearly all of NOSENKO'S knowledge about the microphone

system in the chancery

building

was, he said, derived fron

two circumstances:

Fitst,

his responsibility as Deputy

Chief of the KGB's U.S. Embassy Section, for receiving and

disseminating transcripts.of conversations there; and

second,

a special neeting which he attended in his dual capacity

ag

Deputy Chief of the U.S.

Embassy Section and custodian of

the microphone information.

Additional information was ob-

täined by NOSENKO in 1962 and 1963 from G.I. GRYAZNOV, his

former subordinate and his successor as Deputy Chief of the

Section.

In

several discussions with GRYAZNOV duting this

period NOSENKO learned that some of

the microphones were

dead while others had become less efficient since NOSENKO's

reassignment to the Tourist Department in January 1962.

NOSENKO's statements concerning his major sources' óf infor

mation on the microphones are presented in chronological

order below.

"He are listening to everythiug the military attaches

say in Moscow, the Military, Navy and Air Force Attaches,"

NOSENKO said

on 11 June 1962.

"All the reports go through

ne.

I read them....Only a linited group of people read

these reports.

They are all in the First Department of the

Second Chief Directorate.

Who are they?

The Chief of the

Department (we don't give then to his deputies), the Chief

of the (U.S. Embassyl Section, and I--altogether three people.

Sometimes

we report

to GRIBANOV things

we consider important.

fact that we are listening to the Americans

If you do it

will be the end of me....Only three people krow that we

are listening to you.

rate it is a tremendous secret that ve are listening, to you."

NOSENKO was asked on 12 June 1962 about the form in which

he received the audio intercept reports and whether these

reports were delivered to his office:

He answered:

"No:

It is necessary to have these extracts

in the Embassy, the so-called delo-formular (developmental

filel. We keep

one on every Embassy employee."

During the second of the 1964 series of neetings in

„Geneva,

on 24 January, NOSENKO took a number of notes

from

his wallet.

Pointing to one of them, he said:

"This piece

of paper was kept in my operational file and it represents

the statistics for the years 1960-1961,

listing those micro-

phones which are actively used in monitoring conversations

in the U.S. Embassy."

This list named eleven offices and

apartments in the chancery which contained microphones.

When asked whether he had copied the list from records

or

had drawn it up from memory,

NOSENKO explained that it came

from an operational review of what "listening points we had

in the U.S. Embassy."

A detailed explanation of his acquisition of the written

list was supplied by NOSENKO on 14 May 1964:

Question:

How did this list come into your hands? What

caused you to write it?

NOSENKO:

question:

I came to KLYPIN (Chiel of the American Depart-

nent] with my working notebook. KOVSHUK (Chief

of-the .U.S. Embassy Section in the Department|

was writing and he put the list on my book.

KOVSHUK said this one (microphone]

well, this one badly, and so on.

ficult to say.

Maybe we

went to report to KOVSHUK

in his room ur maybe KOSHUK was writirg in

KLYfI"'s study room.

I don't remember.

NOSENKO then described the purpose of the seeting::

To dis-

cuss the possibility of releasing monitor positions from

some of the

chancery nicrophones and of assigning these re-

leased positions to Vladinir (patronymic unknowr) PETROV,-

Chief of the American Department's section for work against

American tourists and delegates suspected of being con-

nected with American Intelligence; PETROY had earlier re-

quested English-language monitoring positions fron the Chiel

of the English-Language Section of the OTU's Second Special

Department but had been told that all such interpreters were

already engaged on priority targets.

At the neeting KOVSHUK

and KLYPIN reviewed the microphone coverage of the chancery

to decide which rooms offered information of little value

and which monitoring positions could be released to PETROV.

KOYSHUK drew up a list of

the

Embassy offices and apartments

then being covered on a full-time basis and indicated those

of lesser importance.

At the end of the neeting, KOVSHUK

gave the list to NUSENKO, who retained it in his safe until

bringing it to CIA in 1964.

NOSENKO has added nothing fur-

ther on the locations of microphones in the chancery building,

and much of his information concerning the quality and value

of the production by these microphones came from this

mecling.

Since his defection, NOSENKO has spoken further on his

responsibilities in coonection with the daily transcripts

received from the Second Special Department.

He said on

14 May 1961:

"All the materials after they were read and

signed were

Operational Tchnical Directorate.

Some of the material fron

this was put in the individual file, but anyone who read

A protocol signed by NOSENKO in 1965 states:

to appropriate case officers the production from microphones:

(Summing. up)

"To be perfectly frank, I would

assune that...some of our modus operandi,

some of our

targets, some of the results, and all of our personal

weaknesses were comprosised.

•This is not a very de-

finite answer; however, it is the best estimate I caD

nake."

In its general introduction, the USIB damage report

states:

"Although there has been no observable indication

that the

Soviets have acted in any manner to the detriment

of the United

States based. upon information considered pose

sibly. compromised, it must

be concluded that due to the or

tensive period of

penetration, the cumulative. effect has

resulted in serious damage to the United States.

"The

Soviets havo gained considerable knowledge as to the effective-

ness of United States operations within the, Soviet Union,

particularly

the military attache collection program.

Soviet knowledge of U.S. esphasis upon certain intelligence

collection areas has made it possible for then to identify

priority intelligence and probable Soviet targets and thereby

permitted them

to implement specific counteractions..

The

Soviets over the years must have

amassed considerable infor-

mation concerning the personal habits, problens, attitudes

and weaknesses of personnel assigned to the Embassy which

can be used by them for purposes of exploitation at any

time of their choosing in the future."

The following extract from the USIB damage report con-

cerns the declining value of the production from the micro-

phones in 1962 and 1963.*

"The

security practices and procedures appear to

have followed a pattern from April 1953 to May 1960, at

which time the first plastic room was installed.. A

(111) Microphones in the North Wing

According to NOSENKO, no microphones or other audio devices

were installed in the north ving (as distinct from the chancery)

of the U.S. Embassy prior to its occupancy in 1962.

(For this

reason, NOSENKO advised CIA in 1962 to transfer its sensitive

offices gradially--to protect NOSENKO's security--fron the

chancery to the north wing at the Embassy.)

He has commented

several

times on this subject, and these remarks are presented

below.

11 June 1962: "The Embassy is now located on Chaykovskiy

to the discovery of other Soviet lechnicel equifment installed

In the north wing.

The USIB damage report stated:

"Three -

coaxtal cables were discovered running parallel to the one

hundred-and-one pair audio cable from the North Annex roof

ares to the basement of the North Annex...(All three cables

were severed by

American technicians in 1964.) The cable

runs

were as follows:

inchese rest erced cere in resort need attic.

The certer conductor was connected to the lead sheath

of the 20-palr and of the 30 pair cable which in turn

come iror. the east face of the chancery.

The shield of

the coaxial caule was unconnected.

"2.

The second coaxial cable... followed the same path

as the first coaxial cable.

The shield was interminated.

The center corductor was terminated in an

insulated

metal grill.

The grill is located in the upper crust

of the North Annex attic floor with the long dimension

in juxtaposition to the old common wall between the

Chancery and the North Annex.

The long dimension is

normal to the street in front of the Embassy.

The

grill is nade of one centineter steel reinforcing rods

spot welded into a mesh of 15 cm. (5.9 inches).

The

overall dimensions of the grill are 14'4" by 4'7".

The coaxial cable was connected to one corner of the

grill....The grill is located as close as possible to

the old common

wall and is about thirty

feet below the

State Department code room.

The grill 'points' in the

general direction of the code room as the plane of the

grill is parallel to the plane of the ground.

The third coaxial cable ran along the approximate

path of the uther coaxial cables to the block of rein-

forced concrete that contains the grill nentioned above.

This coaxial cable terminated in a four-inch piece of

fine Lits wire.

The shield of the coaxial cable was

unterninated...

The damagé report added:. "The coaxial cables appear to be

of recent installation probahly prior to Russian evacuation

of the North Annex.

The outer shields of all the coaxial

cables were carefully insulated.

The conxial cables and their terminations were evaluated

as follows. in the damage report:

Because NOSENKO's true name and photographs had been

submitted

to the U.S. Fmbassy

in Moscow in connection with this visa request,

NOSENKO added, it was henceforth

necessary for him to use his

true name for all travel abroad.

c. The Cuba TDY (1960)

In November 1960, after and as

result of the cancellation

of his planned trip to

the United States, NOSENKO travelled with

a delegation of nickel industry experts to cuba.

He first men-

tioned this trip on 11 Jure 1962,

during his second meeting with

• CIA.

His account of his

activities was given in answer to the

question of whether he had

ever visited Germany:

In the final minutes of NOSENKO's last meeting with CIA in

the suoject of his trip to Cuba came up again; NOSENKO re-

called that he had used the name NOSENKO for his trip to Cuba

and that his function there

was that of security officer.

Question: When did you travel to Cuba?

NOSENKO:

1960, November and December 1960.

Question:

NOSENKO :

No, as NOSENKO, NOSENKO, NOSENKO.

sometime in November, with a group

automotive specialists, etc.

gubmitted for coordination and, in particular, my

name had been given to the American

But the American Embassy Enbassy there

announced that

later.

In september 1964 NOSENKO added that LEVINA had never

been targetted ayainst any particular irdividual and had never

provided any interesting reports on her Aserican contacts.. At

the end of 1960 or in the beginning of 1961, NOSENKO said, she

was released from the Emtassy by Paul SMITH, possibly because

she was a little deaf and one had to speas loudly to her to be

understood.*

NOSENKO turned LEVINA over to another officer be-

fore he returned to the Tourist Department, and later the Eritish

Department was planning to use her in either the British or Canad-

jan Embassies.

CIA records show that LEVINA was employed at the Embassy as

a librarian from January 1958 through January 1962, whea she

vas released.

Overseas Assignments

a. Attempt to Obtain Assignment in Ethicpia (1960)

During the first half of 1960, NOSENKO said, he applied for

a permanent overseas assignment to Ethiopia because doctors had

prescribed a change of climate for his daughter Oksana's asthma.

O.M. GRIBAIQV, Chief of the Second Chief Directorate, approved

his request, but then the KGB Personnel Department turned

it

down shen a

file review revealed

potentially dangerous character

weaknesses.

NOSENKO described this matter on 14 April 1964 as follows:

"Gennadiy GRYAZNOV came to the American Department of the Second

• Before 1956 he was stucying in the

Higher School of the KGB

and when he finished the school in 1956

he was assigned to the KGB Personnel Department, and then he came

to the American Department in 1958.

SO GRYAZNOV had very good

cornections in the Personnel Department.

So in 1960, when I

wanted to leave, to yo abroad on permanent assignment I said to

GRIBANOV:

'Let

me go for two years to Ethiopia.

When the Par-

sonnel Department refused to let me go, I decided I'd just have

to know what was there in my personal

file.

I had to learr. what

it was that was causing all this.

By that time GRYAZNOV was in

the American Department of the Second Chief Directorate and hap-

pened to be the head of the Party Organization of the entire

directorate, and he at one time had worked in the Personnel Office:

himself.

He said:

'Give me this thing and I'll see what I can

find out about it.' So he went to the

Personnel Department and

through his friend there got my personal file.

Ther. he gave me

a call

and said to come over.

I went to his office and he locked

the door.

Of course, he couldn't give me this file, couldn't

let me hold it in my

hands so to speak.

So he read this case

to me, this 1954 case to

me, about the

woman and so forth," and

then said that at that time they made an investigation of

my

previous residence.

And they found out that while I was study-

ing at the Irstitute (of International Affairs) and was living

on Pervaya Meschangkaya Street, all sorts of girls visited me;

different girls,

new girl would visit me almost every week.

This was in my file.

Then

this case that took place in 1954.

And then in 1960--and, incidentally,

GRIBANOV mentioned this to

me also--the file said

that I was drinking quite a bit, and for

this reason I had many

fights with my wife.

And that was all

that appeared in my file.

Nothing else, whatsoever, besides

these things that I just mentioned."

b. U.S. Visa Application (1960)

NOSENKO's true name appeared with 11 others on a 20 October

1960 reguest to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow for visas for members

of a Soviet automotive exchange delegation which was scheduled

to visit the United States in mid-November 1960.* HOSENKO was

listed as an engireer employed by the State Scientifis-Technical

Committee (GNTK). After defecting, NOSENKO told CIA that he had

been scheduled to accompany this delegation as a secilrity offi-

cer but that the delegatior's visit to the linited States had

been postpored at the last moment.

He therefore did not travel

to this country.

He further explaired, on 17 April 1964, why his visa appli-

cation had been submitted

in tzue name and under a different

cover:

"In 1957 and 1958 I went to London as NIKCLAYEV reprE-

senting the Ministry

of culture.

Then in 1953 I didn't go anj-

where.

Then when this question came up of my going

to the Staing

in 1960, I said: 'I'm rot

going.

I've been going under the

Ministry of Culture (cover! and with sports delegations.

This

has to be changed somelio's at this point.'

So we thought about

it and finally sonebody said:

'Lock, how about this?

Perhaps

lyou can usel this comnittee cE RUbNEV's (GNik).'

So I said:

'Well,

it's up to you.

You ducide.' by that time my passpurt

vas ready, but the inericans and the soviets hadn't come tu ar

agreenent yet.

It was decided that this delegation rould go to

the U.S. in 1961."

NOSENKO was then asked why he could not

have used the NIXOLAYEV name for his trip to

the United States.

He replied:

"Sure, I could have gone as NIFOlAYEV, but I just

didn't want

to.

Pecause, look, it was krown to us that the

British and American Intelligence exchange information on people

they suspect of being iGs, ana that the Britisi,

of course,

had probably watched me when i was in England lin 1957 and

13581

and probably there it was noticed that here's this man

under

the cover of Ministry of Culture.

He's tot a sportsman.

It

kind of looks suspicious.

Then he goes to the soviet Embassy.

Also suspicious.

So then I have to go to the States.

ind if

I go as NIKOLAYEV I couldn't use--in that case I couldn't uge

the same cover of Ministry of Culture because of the type of

the delegation.

I'd hive to use a different cover.

so I'd go

there and

they'd say:

'Aha, here's NIKOLAYEV under different

cover now.'

But if I go as NOSENKO, the British never heard

the nare.

Nobody knows the name.

Everything would be o.k.

NOSENKO was then asked why he could not have travelled under

SOmE

other alias.

He answered:

"That's the way it was de-

cided.

I guess

so as not to get all mixed up they decided to

send me as jOSENKO anyway. It's up to the people who are in

charge of these operations. They are the ones who decide."**

This visa

after the

application was submitted approximately six months

KGB rejected his request for PCS assignment to

Ethiopia.

** With regard to his trips to England in 1957 and 1958, NOSENO

said that he had been forced to use the name NIKCLAYEV because

this was the name he had used with British citizens fishest

Writhen they visited the Soviet Union in the summer of 1957; he

supon their return from the ossk ibee Party...u

This apparently was not a consideration when selecting a name

Because NOSENKO's true name and photographs had been

submitted

to the U.S. Embassy in Moscot in

connection with this visa request,

NOSENKO added, it

was henceforth

necessary for him to use his

true name for all travel abroad.

c. The Cuba TDY (1960)

In November 1960, after and as a result of the cancellation

of his planned trip to

the United States, NOSENKO travelled

a delegation of nickel industry experts to Cuba.

He first men-

tioned this trip on 11 Jure 1962, during his second meeting with

In the final minutes of NOSENKO's last meeting with CIA in

1962

the suoject of his trip to Cuba

came up again; NOSENKO re-

called that he had used the name NOSENKO for his trip to Cuba

and that his function there

was that of security officer.

Question: When did you travel to Cuba?

NOSENKO:

1960, November and December 1960.

Question:

Under the name NIKOLAYEV?

NOSENKO:

No, as NOSENKO, NOSENKO, NOSENKO.

I will explain

how this happened.

I was supposed to go to America,

sometime in Novenber, with a group irom Gosplan,

automotive specialists, etc.

Data had already been

submitted for coordination and, in particular, my

name had been given to the American Embassy there

(Moscow]. But the American Embassy announced that

this delegation could be accepted, but a little

later.

And my passport had already been issued.

My passport had already been signed authorizing travel

abroad, but it was a service passport, not a diplomatic

one. And at this moment a delegation was supposed to

time as he was preparing for his intended trip to the

United States,

delegation

of nickel industry experts

from Gospian,

the Soviet State Planning

Commission, was prepar-

ing for departure to Cuba.

The delegation was a routine one,

consisting mostly of engineers from various sections of the

soviet Union, and since there was no one under any sort of sus-

picion, the Eleventh (Soviet Travellers Abicad) Department of

the Second Chief Directorate had decided that it would not be

necessary to include a security officer.

Two days prior to the

departure of the group, however, the Central Committee of the

Conmunist Party decided that a Second Chief Directorate case

officer must go along.

Because of the short time remaining be-

fore the scheduled departure of the delegation, the Eleventh

Department protested that it would be impossible to find a suit-

able person and

necessary papers ready in time.

this point, A.I. KUZNETSOV of the Eleventh Department said:

d.

The Bulgaria TDY ard the LUNT Case

In the spring of 1961; four months after returning from

Cuba,

NOSENKO was sent on temporary assignment for about a

month to sofiò, the only trip he cook in other than a security

"watchdog" capacity.

According to NOSENKO, it happened this

way:

"I think I first heará that I was going to Bulgaria, a

week or so before I left, from s.I. YEGOROY,

Chief of the

section having contact with the counterintelligence representa-

tiveg

of the Countries of the Peoples'

Denocracies in Moscow...

He said:

'You must go to Bulgaria.

GRIBANOV has decided.'

He asked, 'Do you

know about this?' and I said

"1o.'

He said:

'KLYPIN (Chief of the American Department) must tell you.'

But

this was the first I had heard about it.

YEGOROV said that the

Minister of the Bulgarian MVR had requested the Chairman of the

KGB

to

send

an officer fron the American Department of the Sec-

ond Chief Directorate to Bulgaria for consultation with the

- American Department, Second

Directorate of the MVR of Bulgaria..

After one or two days kLipI! told me about it.

He repeated

the same thirg and after about one and a half weeks I flew to

sofia."

The discussion continued as follows:

Question: What plans were made for this trip in Moscow before

you left?

What briefings or discussions were held

concerning what you were to do in Scfia?

NOSENKO:

I was told:

"You are goirg for consultations. There

are KGB advisors there.

They will discuss it with

you."

No one was speaking with me about my trip.

Question: What discussions did you have with your department

chief, KLYPIN, about what you were to do on this

trip?

NOSENKO:

Nothing.

He told me: "You will go. You will see

what they are doing.

You will tell them how to

work."

Question: Did you have any meetings or discussions with the

representatives of the Bulgarian MVR in Moscow be-

fore you left?

NOSENKO: NO.

Question: What discussions did you have with YEGOROV of his

section about what you were going to do in Sofia?

NOSENKO:

YEGOROV said:

"You will go. You will tell us what

they are doing."

Question:

Before you left Moscow for Sofia did you know any-

thing about the size of the American Department of

the Bulgarian MVR?

NOSENKO:

No. Nothing.

questions: Did you know the names of any of the officers of the

Questions pid you know what any of their particular problems

were?

NOSENKO: No.

Nothing.

Question: Did you know just what was the area of responsibility

of the American Department of the Bulgarian MVR?

NOSENKO:

No. Nothing.

NOSENKO fled from Moscow in early April 1961 and was met

at the airport in Sofia by A.S. KOILOV, a former Second Chief

Directorate officer whom he had krown in Moscow.*

The follok.

ing morning he was picked up in an official vehicle and wes

taken to KOZLOV's office in the Bulgarian MVR building, not far

away.

NOSENKO asked KOZLOV what was expected of him and was

told that "they want to know about how to work against the Ameri-

can Legation.

He said he wanted me

NOSENKO was. then intro-

duced to the Chief KGB advisor in Sofia, Mikhail YEGOROV, and

to the Chief of the MVR's American Department, after which he

was assigned an office in the MVR tuilding.

During the ensuing

weeks he discussed both general matters and particular cases

with individual Bulgarian officers vorking aguinst the imerican

target.

On one occasion he lectured interested MVR officers

on the principles of operations against foreign military person-

nel in Moscow, and on another he visited an MR surveillance

post opposite

the American Legatior.

He discussed. KGB methods

of operations against foreign tourists.

He also addressed the

entire American Department for about five hours and told them

"what is necessary, what to pay attention to, how to work."

At the end of his visit, sone

time in nid-May, NOSENKO conferred

with the First Deputy Minister

of the MVR about what had been

accomplished and his recommendations for improving operations

against Americans.

As an outgrowth of his IDY to Bulgaria, NOSENKO has pro-

vided one lead to a case in which he said he took personal part.

About two weeks after arriving in Bulgaria, around

the end of

April 1961, NOSENKO was going over lists

of foreigners who were

scheduled to visit Bulgaria: in the near future.

and he came

across the name Horace G. LUNT. NOSENKO recalled that a man

named LINT who was a Slavic linguist had been reported to him

in 1958 or 1959 by one of his homosexual agents, VOLKOV oI

YEFREMOV, as a possible homosexual.

He asked the Bulgarians

whether this man was a specialist in Slavic languages.

When

the Bulgarian officers replied in the affirmative, NOSENKO de

cided to check his recollection against KGB records and an

immediate phone call was placed to yoscow. asking for traces.

* NOSENKO had earlier reported that KOZLOV had served as the

Chief of the American Department, Second Chief Directorate,

until 1953 and that, until about two years before going to

Bulgaria as a counterintelligence advisor, he had been

Deputy Chief of the Tourist Department.

For the two years

Immediately prior to his Bulgarian assignment, he had been

Secretary of the Party Organization of the Second Chief

Directorate and was relieved of all other duties. Asked

why KOZLOV was unable to "advise" the Bulgarlans in this

A reply was received almost at once:

"yes.

NOSENKO told CIA that

the KGB had never done anything with its knowledge of LUNT's

homosexual proclivities and that the Bulgarian MVR had not pre-

viously known of then.

NOSENKO's description of what happened next is as follows:

"KOZLOY and the Chief of the American

Department were very in-

terested.

KOZLOV said:

They never recruited an American.'

I said that I would do what

GRIBANOV thought that I, myself, wanted

KOZLOV got confused on the pione.

GRIBANOV asked to speak

'what are

you doing?' he said.

"You are not at hore, you are abroad.

You were sent only for consultations, but you are living as if

you were at home.

'O.K., O.K. I wasn't going to do

He hung uf.

I told

KOZLOV that even

if the Bulgar-

ians were to ask me, I could not do it myself.

YEGOROV became

He thought our position was bad because the Bulgarians

were

"but I am

"The Bulgarians never said anything to me about active

and the chief

of the section dealing with tourists and American

delegations were to make the recruitment. The approach was

made at the end of April, I think."

NOSENKO went on to say: "I was in the office during the

approach.

I told

them I would not leave.

'If you need my

advice,' I said,

"come to me.' KOZLOV and I were sitting in

his office. It was the end of April, I think, and the next

day I went on holiday. I don't know where or how they approached

The first time NOSENKO said that he had not participated

directly in this operation was on 2 February 1964, while still

in Geneva.

He volunteered the following:

*In Bulgaria in

April and May 1961, although I did not personally participate

in this, I went there, and. I helped them there with the whole

process of recruitment of this professor.

I helped the Bul-

garians with what to do and how.

He was

NOSENKO has also varied on the timing of the operation

against LUNT.

In the account quoted above, he said that the

approach was made the day before he left on his. May Day holi-

day. On 24 April 1964 he said:

"I remember that it was at

the very beginning of May that this name came up.

this was established, the next day the Bulgariars plarted this

homosexual or hin.

They planted this man either next to him

or in the restaurant and, well, he met LUNt and they got te-

gether and decided to meet with each other the same day or the

sext day.

This was all done very rapidly.

According to Professor LUNT, the approach actually took

place on 5 May 1961, following a visit to Moscow where he had

contacted an official in the l.S. Embassy.

He travelled on

9 May directly from Sofia to Yugoslavia,

at once re-

ported the incident to U.S. Massador George KENNAN, an aca-

demic acquaintance.

LUNT told the Ambassador,

and later CIA,

that he had visited sofia on ore earlier occasion, from 8 to

28 November 1960.

During

this first

trip he became involved

with one Georgi Velev ALEKSIEV, with whom he ergaged in homo-

sexual relations on at least five separate occasions and to

whon he gave U.S. travellers checks, which ALEKSIEV intended

to sell on the black market.

On one occasior during the first

visit ALEKSIEV was recognized and stopped by the Bulgarian

civil police while walking on the

street with LINT.

5. Transfer to the Tourist Department in January 1962.

In

the autumn of 1961 a decision was reached, on the basis

of NOSENKO's own request, to return him to the Tourist Depart-

ment.

GRIBANOV had originally wanted to promote NoSEnKO Iron.

the position of Deputy Chief of the U.S. Embassy Section to the

post of Deputy Chief of the American Department; NOSENKO'&

superior and friend KOVSHUK had long had his eye on this job,

however, and was the personal choice of the Chief of the Ameri-

can Department for it.

(In fact; NOSENKO said, KOVSHUK had

once held the job, lcsing it in 1959 because of some misbehavior.)

NOSENKO did not want to be placed in the difficult situation

which his on promotion to this post would have created.

NOSENKO

. descriked his transfer in the February 1965 interrogationg. The

following is from a protocol signed on 26 February 1965:

"The decision for me to return to the Seventh (Tourist)

Departrert. in Jaruary 1962 was actually made in about Septem-

ber or October 1961.

GRIBANOV planned to appoint me deputy

chief of the First (American) Department, but the new Chief

of the First Department, FELOSEYE!, wanted KOVSHUK to take

this position.

Seventh Department, about this matter and he had suggested

that I go to GRIBANOV and ask to be returned to the Seventh

Department is Chief of the First (American-British-Canadian)

Section with the understanding that I would be appointed

Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department as soon as this

position would be vacated by (B.À.) BALDIN [who was retiring

in July 1962].

...GRIBANOV did not teli me his reasons...

for wanting to appoint me Deputy Chief of the First Depart-

ment in late 1961 or for appointing me Section Chief and

later Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department in 1962.

did not discuss witi me my personal qualifications for.

each of these positions."

Aware of his impending transfer NOSENKO took the opportunity

during December 1961 to spend several hours each day in the Tour-

ist Department.

There he talked with Department Chief CHELNOKOV,

faniliarized himself with certain files of the American Tourist

Section, and discussed current operations and operational possi-

bilities with the officers assigned to this section. The formal

order for the transfer was signed by GRIBANOV on 24 or 25 Desen-

ber 1961 and NOSENKO officially signed over the ABIDIAN case file

and the U... Embassy security file to his successor as leputy

Chief of the American Erbassy Section, G.I. GRYAZNOV, within the

Date of Transfer

NOSENKO has given different dates for the time when he left

the U.S. Embassy Section of the American Departmert to become

Chief of the American-British-Canadian Section of the Tourist

Department.

During the Geneva meetings of 1962 he said on

different occasions that this occurred in January 1962 and

in

February 1962; in 1964 he timed the transfer as falling between

15 and 20 January 1962; and in February 1965 NOSINKO gave the

date as 2 or 3 january 1962.

He has also reported that he was

in the U.S. Embassy Section for three months after John ABIDIAN

serviced

the Pushkin Street dead drop (on 30 December 1961, thus

placing NOSENKO in the U.s.

Embassy Section until late March

1962) and that he had transterred

to the Tourist Department by

the time GOLITSyN defected (which NOSeNKO place

in mid-January

1962 but which actually occurred in mid-December 1961).* W.E.

JOHNSON, the target of a Tourist Department operation**

con-

firmed that NOSENKO approached him in Moscow on 5 january 1962.

date of his approach to JOHNSON was on 5 January 1962.

"facts" (his emphasis) were the important thing, not any corre-

lation of dates.

2. Functions and Activities

As Chief of the american-British-Caradian Section of the

Tourist Department (hereafter in Part V.F. referred to as the

American Tourist Section) from January to July 1962, NOSENKO

said, he was responsible for planning and coordinating all

KGB activities against such tourists in the USSR as well as

for supervising the operational work of 15 subordinate case

officers.

He had no deputy.

NOSENKO told CIA that he required

several months at the beginning of 1962 "to get the feel of

things", "there were no accomplishments" on his part in the

initial period on this new job, and plans for handling the

influx of American tourists during the forthcoming 1962 season

consisted of studying files and continuing to work against the

tourists as in the past. NOSENKO was asked in February 1965 .

Stateuents by NOSENKO about GOLITSYN are reviewed in

Part VI.E.. and ABIDIAN's servicing of the Pushkin Street

dead drop is discussed in Part V.E.3.d.

KGB had noted an increase

that American intelligence had increased its use of multinational

tourist groups.

NOSENXO was then asked wrat new information

concerning the use of tourism as a cover for uspiorage activity

had

been obtained by the kGB from any agent source during this

period.

NOSENKO answered that he neither knew of any suci: new

information nor had he heard of such

an agert.**

NOSENKO has said that, in line with the wishes of the Chief

of the KGB Second Chief Directorate, O.N. GRIBANOV, he was pro-

moted to the position of Deputy Chief of the entire Tourist

Department in July 1962, irmediately after his return from

as there was no second Deputy Chier at the time.

Apart from

saying he was V.i. CHELIOKOV's second-in-command from July 1962

to january 1964 and as such general supervisor

of all KGB tour-

ist operations, NOSENKO has not detailed the functions attached

to this position; NOSENKO has nut been questioned

specifically

NOSENHO's first operational activity after transferring to

the American Tourisi Section was supervision of a homosexual

tO N.E. JCHISIN on 5 January 1962.

Additionally, during

the 1902-64 period in the Tourist Department NOSENKO took part

in the recruitrent approach to Horst

ERAUNS, in the interrogation

of Yale University Professor Frederick BAPCHOORN, and in the

arrest of the iterican tour guide Bernard KOTeN.

For a short

time in 1963 he handled the KGB agent Alexander

SVENCHANSKIY,

owner of a tourist agency

in New York Ci=y***

and a Russian

language bookstore in Chicago, Illinois.

the Tourist Department NOSENKO also be-

came involved with John SHUBIN, a GRU agent.

(These six cases -

JOHNSON, BRAUNS, BARGHOORN, KOTEN, SVENCHANSKIY, and SHUBIN - are

discussed below.)

NOSENKO reported that his planned role in the

approach to Natalie BIENSTO (see Part VI.D.2.) was prevented

by his preparations to leave for Geneva in March 1962.

NOSENKO

said he pa-ticipated in the

Harvey OSWALD after P-esidert KBINEDY's assassination in Novem-

ber 1963 (see Part V.D.6.).

NOSENKO has indicated that his own operational work in 1962

to 1964 was limited to those cases cited above because of the

considerable anount of time spent on temporary duty assignments

outside Moscow during these two years.

In mid-February 1962,

soon after assuming the duties of Chief of the uterican Tourist

Section, he began to prepare for his first trip to Geneva, which

lasted

from 14 March until 15 June 1962 (see Part III. B.).

ENKO estimated that he had spent a total of six morths outside

Moscow in 1963 on temporary assignments.

These included a two-

day trip to Odessa to meet FRIPPEL,

ar inspection tour of the

Leningrad KGB organization,

conference on border control,

a week-long trip to Alma-Ata for

a conference on tourist travel with KG3 representatives from

the Soviet Central Asian repubiics, and an eight- or ten-day

inspection trip to the Caucasus as a member of a tean headed by

GRIBANOV.

NOSENKO said he travelled to

Gorkiy Oblast on 16-17

December 1963 to assist in the

search for CHERsPaNov, who had

passed

secret documents to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow (see

Part VI.D.7.c.).

3. NOSENKO 's Agents

when NOSENKO returned to the Tourist Department in the

first days of 1962, he took with him the agents whom he had

been handling as Deputy Chief of the U.S. Embassy Section.

These agents are listed below with a summary of NOSENKO'S COm-

ments concerning their use in 1962 and 1963.*

Describing FRIPPEL'S

past service for the KGB on 15 June 1962, five months after he

said he transferred to the Tourist Department, NOSENKO said:

"FRIPPEL was afraid and gave practically nothing..•

a weak agent...

I recruited him but, speaking honestly, he

was not an agent." Nevertheless, NOSENKO said, the KGB hoped

that FRIPPEL would be reassigned to the USSR at some future

When FRIPPEL returned twice to the Soviet Union in

1963, NOSENKO met with him, once in Odessa and once in Moscow,

period was the American Alexander SVENCHANSKIY.

4. Approach to W.E. JOHNSON

a. NOSENKO 's Information:

NOSENKO first referred to his approach to the American

tourist Wallace Everett JOHNSON on 11 June 1552. He did not name

JOHNSON at this time:

"In January

NOSENKO's first reference to ¿CINSON ir. 1964 was at a meet-

ing

on 2 february, when he produced a note bearing that rame and

the

date 5 January 1962.

"Here I have a rame jotted down,

Everett wallace Lsig/ JOHNSON, " NOSENKO said.

"The date was

5 January 1962,

but what took place i have assolutely no recol-

lectior.. I don't think it was a

recruitment, but it

was some

sort of contact, or he was being studied or worked on, or some-

thing like that.

But I remember nothing."

NOSENKO rext mentioned his approach to JOHNSON on 17 April

Although not immediately recalling JOHNSON's name,

eventually rementered that "it was semething

like JOHNSON,

JOHNSTON, or something that starts with a

'J'" ard that he was

a Baptist irom the California

NOSENKO placed the opera-

tion sometime in the summer of 1962, after his return to Moscow

from Geneva, because he also remeritered wearing "just a coat,

no overcoat at the time."

JOHNSON, who had come to the Soviet

Union as a tourist, was known to be a socialist, and on this

basis the KGB Secona Chief Directorate considered him as a

recruitment target.

Second Chief Directorate checked

whether the KGB First Chief Directcrate wold have any use for

JOHNSON as an agent, however, it learned there was no interest

in JOHNSON:

He had no access to important information, and he

lived too far from the KGB Legal Residencies in the United

States for convenient contact.

Several days later KGB surveillance observed JOHNSON

mailing some letters in Moscow.

When read by the KGB they were

found to be

"so bitter toward the Soviet Union, angry, critical..

that they /the KGB/ decided something had to be done"

to stop

him from writing letters and making anti-Soviet statements on

his return to the United States.

At about the same time there

was some sign that JOHNSON was a homosexual, and it was decided

to entrap him on this basis.

The sole reason was to halt

JOHNSON's criticism of the USSR - no recruitment has attempted.

because neither the Pirst nor the Second Chief Directorates

had any use for him as an agent and because the KGB had detere

mined that he probably would not accept a recruitment proposal

anyway.

NOSENKO did not know why he was selected to make the

approach to JOHNSON, except. that "BOBKOV said I should go."

(P. D. BOBKOV, a Deputy Chief of the Second Chief Directorate,

supervised the activities of the Tourist Department.)

NOSEN-

KO's homosexual agerts. VOLKOV and YEFREMOV were selected to

compromise JOHNSON: *

In 1962 NOSENKO implied that the KGB received Its first

indication of JOHNSON's homosexuality from one or both

these agents.:

JOHNSON became acquainted with VOLKOV and YEFREMOV at the

Metropol Hotel.

They told JOHNSON that they had recently ar-

rived in Moscow and invited JONSON to visit their hotel room.

JOISON agreed because "they urderstood

each other right away.

Tiey knew they were the same li.e..

homosexuals) and so he came,

and when they were engaged

in treir business,

our people walked

in on them under the disguise of the hotel administrator and

one militiaman."

Protographs of the incident had been taken,

but these had

developed at the time of this, the first

corfrontation of JohNso!i.

rOO.R.

By this time, NOSENKO had arrived at the hotel fron his

office, ard he went into the room where JOHNSON was waiting in

accordance with KGB orders.

NOSENKO discussed the situation

with Jordisch, then asked

him to type and sign a statement that

he would "not say anything derogatory about the Soviet Union."

JOHNSON did as he was told.

The following day, after the incriminating photographs had

been developed, NOSENKO approached JOHNSON in the cafe of tre

Metropol Hotel and asked him whether he intended to keep his

When JOHNSON said that he planned to do so, NOSeNKO

preserted him with an envelope containing copies of the photo-

graphs and said that they would be leaked to the foreign press

if JOINSON were to break his promise.

The KGS later learned

that JOHNISON had visited (or phoned,

according to a later ver-

sion) the U.S.

Embassy and assumed that he had reported the

NOSENKO did not recall what name, if any, he had

used during this operation.

Questioned further on 24 April 1964, NOSENKO said that.

upon his arrival at the hotel immediately after the compromise,

the militiaman described the incident to him in JOHNSON's pre-

sence. Addressing JOHNSON, NOSENKO had said:

"How come?

How

could you do such a thing?

What are we going to do now?

After

all, this is punishable by court and... people are given from

five to eitht years for such relations. It used to be three

to five, not it's from five to eight.

Frightened by this,

JOHNSON had written and signed his promise not to denigrate

Union in the future.

NOSENKO was asked whether the KGB would mount such an

operation against any foreigner who wrote uncomplimentary

letters and articles about the USSR. He replied: "They don't

jump on everyone, and not everyone writes this. way. And not

everything that is written this way gets into their hands.

In this case there was a coincidence. " There was something we

coule hit him on.

For instance, if the fact that he is a

homosexual didn't come to our attention, they would probably

just say: 'All right, to hell with him.

we have to get rid

of him.

Let's see that his trip is cut off.'".

Kis

pseudonym is 'AUD' and his last name is SVE:CHANSKIY, Well.

I'll give you all this later."

NOSENKO told CIA on 14 February 1964 that SVENCHANSKIY was

recruited in 1961 and that in 1963 he, NOSaiKO, had taken over

the handling of this agent from tourist Department case officer

Ye. N. NOSKOV. *

SVENCHANSKIY had sent the KG3 many open code

messages such

as those described arove, and a number of these

messages have been considered to have been of definite opera-

tional interest.

NOSENKO identified SVENCHAISKIY as the presi-

dent of "Aftor. Tours" in New York City and the owner of a

Russian-language bookstore in Chicago.

There was some concern on the part of the KGB at the time

of the recruitment in 1960 or 1961, NOSENKO Ieported on 1 March

1965, because SVENCHANSKIY had had cortacts with ANTORG in New

York city.

The KGB suspected he was an FBI agent, but in con-

tacting SVENCHANSKIY in 1960 or 1961, NOSKOV decided that this

was not so and therefore recruited him. (Asked how it was de-

termined that SVENCIANSKIY

was not an FBI agent, NOSENKO Ie-

plied: "NOSKOV felt it;" he had no further explanation.)

The

recruitment was based mainly on ar agreement that Inturist

would send more business to SVENCHANSKIY if he cooperated.

NOSENKO also said SVENCHANSKIY had been arrested for black-

marketeering, but he did not elaborate on this statement.•

NOSENKO took over the case from NOSKOV in September 1963,

and

his name was entered 'in the single-volume file of SVENCHANSKIY

as the handling officer as of that date.

Together with NOSKOV,

NOSENKO subsequently had two meetings with SVENCHANSKIY when

the latter travelled to the Soviet Union, one in September

and one towards. the end of 1963.

asking to be repatriated

to the USSR, to becone a Soviet citizen,

but the Kg! had been putting him off in order

to continue to

exploit his eccess.

Since the amount and quality of the agent's

production had recently deterioraced, the KGB decided to accede

to his request for repatriation.

Now, however, the agent de-

clined, sayirg

that

was not ready to go just yet.

First he

nas practically veggirg to cone to tre Soviet Union ard now ha

This by liself appeared suspicious to the KCB, but

in addition, it was alast this time that the agent came irto

con-

tact with KCTEN

NOSEUKO learned from BARKOVSKIY that KOTEN

"useà to go to some vookstore that sells Soviet literatura and

through a saleslady ir this story whom Kotal knows, he became

acquainted with the agent. Wro also used to go to this store.

After

that, he used

to meet with the agent without the saleslady."

On the basis of these incidents the First Chief Direstorate

suspected that kOTEl had been directed specifically to this store

in order to meet ard

"work on" the agent and that, having learned

that the agent had relatives "in Stantsiya Loo,

atout 17 ki10-

meters from Sochi.., he had evidently received

the assignt.ent

(to visit the relatives) from American Intelligence.

Evidently

they had gotten on the irall of this agent and were

checking on

him."

The KGB

also had suspicions concerning the relatives,

former kulaks who were still well-off financially.

It was knomn.

to the KGB, for example, that the agent had written his sister

In Startsiya loo that he wanted to return to the soviet Union.

and

she had replied:

"Is there any sense in your coming here?"

KOTEN arrived in Moscow and then travelled to sochi.

From

there he sent a telegram to the agent's sister and her husband

in Stantsiya Loo, asking them to come to Sochi to see him.

When

they arrived at ¡OTE!'s hotel: however, the hotel

adninistrator

told them that KOTEN was on an excursion and refused to allow

& meeting.

KOTIN ther took it upor himself to travel to Start-

siya Loo where he eventually contacted

and spoke to the rela-

tives.

In the course of this meeting KOTE took photographs

of the sister and her husband and recorded a message from the

sister to the agent on a tape resorder he had brought along.

From this the KGB deduced that

"U.S. Intelligence wants to get

documentary data" and it therefore

decided to "try to get hold

of KOTEN. "

There had already been some indication during KOTE's

earlier trips to the USSR that he was a homosexual. but the

KGB had taken no action because KOTEN was believed to be a

loyal Communist Party member.

With these recent developments,

the situation had now changed. Although NOSENKO's superiors

were absent from KGB Headquarters at the time, immediate action

Mas required.

NOSENKO consequently "took the whole thing on

myself because everybody got excited.. Everybody said: 'Let's

go. American Intelligence is active, none of our bosses are

here.

8. Arrest of BARGHOORS

Information. from NOSENKO

At the first of the 1954 meetings in Geneva NOSENKO

described the provocation

and

arrest of. Yale Uriversity

Professor Frederick BARGHOOR} in •lato 1963; he was ques-.

tioned further on this case on 3 February

1964 and again

whilo

waiting in Frankfurt to leave for the United Statos.

NOSENKO'& most corprehensive statement, from which the

following paragraphs were largely drain, was made on 9 June

On this last occasion NOSENKO said that the pur-

pose of the KGB operation against BARGHOORY Has to retallato

for persona non grata action

taken against three Soviets

11 New York City In The case of John W. BUTEN50 and to

secure a hostage in exchange for a fourth Soviet in tho

EUTENKO case who was jailed.

In Geneva, however, NOSENKO

maintained that the operation against

BARGIOO?N

discourage future arrests such

as that of IVAvor! the

jailed Soviot),

not because of any special importance of

IVANOV himself."

NOSENKO said that in 1963 four NGB First Chief Direc

torate officers assigned

to the New York Legal Residency

were caught in operational activity in the United States.

Of the four, three had diplomatic immunity, but one vas a

chauffeur and had only a service passport.

The three

Soviet diplomats were held three or four hours by the

American authorities and

IVANOV, the chauf-

feur, was arrested since he did not have diplomatic immunity.*

GRIBANOV, Chief of the KGB Second Chief Directorate,

learned of this arrest probably the next day and was directed

by KGB Chairman SEHICHASTNYY to take

"necessary meagures."

GRIBANOV thereupon called to his office NOSENKO; A.G.

KOVALENKO, Chief of the Tourist Department; and G.I. GRYAZ-

NOV and Ye.J. RASHCHEFOY, both Deputy Chiefs from

the Ameri-

can Departrent.

After explaining tho arrest, GRIBANOV

asked what information the Second Chief Directorate had on

any American--U.S. Invassy employee or tourist--that could

*The detail of NOSENKO'S information on the BARGHOORN case

raflects both the extent of the ClA debriefings and the

depth of his knowledge of this case. He did, in fact,

fur-

nish much of this information during his first 1964 meeting

with CIA.

NOSENKO was also able to describe at length

BARG:OORN's professional background, which gave rise to KGB

suspicions of intelligence affillation, and he provided the

general outlines of other operational activity centering

around BARGHOOR" during his 1963 trip to the Soviet Union.

**Three Soviets were arrested in Englewood, N.J., on 30 Octo-

ber 1963 during a clandestine meeting with the KGB agent,

BUTENKO, an Auerican engineer.

Two of the Soviets,' GiA.

PAVIOV and Yu.A. ROMASHIN, were members of the Soviet Mis-

sion to the United Nations; they claimed diplonatic imnunt-

ity and were released; a few days later they were declared

persona non grata along with a third Soviet, V.I. OLENEV.

RASHCHEPOV and GRYAZNOV

said that at that very moment there were three or four

American military attaches in Rostov and that, in the

opinion of the inerican bepartment, these officers night

be carrying electronic apparatus.

It was knowr that they

had cameras,

that they had been taking

photegraphs, and that

they had been observed taking notes.

If permitted,

they

could be arrested in Rostov before they took the return

plane to Moscow.

GRIBAVOY wanted to know what other pos-.

sibilities existed and instructed the two representatives

of the American Department to

write a report on this.

also told them to request permission to arrest abd search

the military attactes.

GRIBANOV then asked what pertinent inforration was held

by the Tourist Department.

Ho was told thet there were re-

latively few American tourists in the Soviet Union at that

time;* these included BARGHOORN, who was mentioned

to GRI-

BANOV along with une otber (name not recalled). : NOSENKO and

KOVALENKO reported, however, that the KCB had no "strong"

materials against then.

They were ordered to make an im

mediate study of the situation and to report back to GRI-

BANOV as soon as possible.

Returning to the Tourist Department, NOSENKO and

KOVALENKO

gathered the entire American Tourist Section in

their office.

In a general discussion, it was decided that

BARGHOORN was the only American on

whom the KGB had anything

worth consideration.

All the materials or BARGHOORN were

gathered together,

and NOSENKO and KOVALENKO took them to

GRIBANOV, explaining that he was the only possibility.

GRIBANOV read all the

materials and was pleased with them;.

he was sure that BARGHOORN was connected with

American

Intelligence.

He then asked what could be done.

NOSENKO

and KOVALENKO reported that BARGHOORN was then in Tbilisi

and that, in fact,

Ye.N. NOSKOV (case orficer, Anerican

Tourist

Section!

was in Tbilisi with a woman doctor from

the KGB Operational Technical Directorste for the purpose

of working against BAPGUORN; the doctor had sone special

Item which

had been used to make BARGEOORN so violently sick

to his stomach that he had to be hospitalized.

While he

was in

the hospital, a careful search had been nade of his

belongings, but nothing of operational interest had been

found.

In addition, a KGB agent was placed in BARGHOORN'S

room

as a patient; he

made anti-Soviet statements ard offered

BARGHOORN

"materials," but BARGHOORN did not rise to the

bait.

At the time of this meeting with GRIBANOY, BARGHOORN

was scheduled to fly from Tbilisi to Moscow the following

norning, and the KGB knew. from a phone tap that he had an

appointment with Theodore ORCHARD of the British Embassy

at the Hotel Metropol the following evening.

It was GRIBANOV who raised the possibility of giving

"materials" to BARGHOORN in Moscow..

NOSENKO said that this

would be a provocation, but GRIBANOV replied that this made

no difference to him.. He instructed NOSENKO and KOVALENKO

"about 60."

to locate an agent

who could be used to pass the damaglog

materlals

to BARGHOORN and told then to write a sucmary of

BARGIOORN's background with a proposal that the Second

Chief Directorate arrest him "when he obtains materials

which are of interest to American Intelligence."

This was

to be

sent in letter form to SEMICHiSINYY over GRIBANOV'S

signature; the letter was

not to indicate how BARGHODRY

was to receivé the materials (i.è., the fact of provocation

waS

not to be mentioned).

GRIBAIDY took a one-page letter on BARGHOOP.., along

a similar letter from GRYAZNOY and RASHCHEPOV con-

cerning the military attaches, to SENICHSINY:

Khile

the four--NOSENKO, KOVALENKO,

GRYAZNOY and KOVALENKD=-

were waiting in GRIBAYOV's office for his return, GRY:ZNOV

received

a telephone call from the local iCB organization

in Rostov informing him that the military attaches were in

the air on their way back to Moscow.

Shortly thereafter,

GRIBANOV returned with the news that the Chairman of the

KGB

had approved the arrests of the military attaches as well

as BARGHOORN.

(KHRUSHCHEV was absent fron iloscow at the

time, but SEMICHASTNYY had called BREZHNEV and secured his

approval.*)

When GRIBINOV learned from GRYAZNOV that the military

attaches were already on

their way back to Noscow, he be-

came furious and sent GRYAZNOV out

"to do the job

or die."

arrangements were made with the

to the First Chief Directorate)

were being picked up, NOSENKO and KOVALENKO returred to

their office to plan the provocation.

BARGHOORN was placed under immediate surveillance upon

his arrival in Moscow.

At 1810 hours a radio message was

received from one of the surveillance cars that BARGHUORN

had gone to the U.S. Embassy,

and it was decided that the

agent (nare not recalled, aged 25 to 30 years) would be

placed in contact with him as soon as he came out. The

KGB knew BARGHOORN had an appointment with ORCHARD of the

British Embassy at 1900 hours,

but at 1900 hours a report

was received that BARGHOORN had left the U.s.

Embassy in

the American Ambassador's car. He was alone but

for the

Soviet driver. Nothing could be done while BARGIOORN was in

the moving car.

A check on ORCHARD established that he was

in the downstairs hall of the hotel waiting.

It was there-

fore decided to approach BARGHOORN when he left the car at

the hotel.

#NOSENKO placed these events on the day before BARGHOORN re-

turned to Moscow from Tbilisi and on the day before BARGHOORN

was arrested. As indicated below, BARGHOORN returned fron

Alma-Ata to Moscow on 25 October 1963 and was arrested on

31 October 1963, six days later. CIA records show that on

30 October, the day before the arrest, XHRUSHCHEV greeted

Laotian Premier SOUVANNA Phouma on his arrival in Moscow and

later in the day attended a luncheon in his honor.. On 31

BARGHOORN had taker only one or two steps when he was

seized by NOSKOV and Petr POPTSOV, another case officer of

the American Tourist Section, and

told he was under arrest.

A surveillance car pulled up.

BARGHOORN was placed in the

car,

handcuffed (on GRIBANOV's orders, because the Soviets

arrested in the United States had received similar treat-

ment) and driven to the 50th Section of the Militia, where

a room had been prepared.

L.I. YEFRENOV and K.G. KRÜPNOV from the American

Tourist Section were waiting at the Militia station, KRUPNOV

to interrogate BARGlICORN and YETRENOV to be the interpreter.

When BARGHOORN was brought into the station, an "incident

report" form was filled out,

and a resolution was prepared

requesting permission to hold him 48 hours.

Between 0200

and 0300 hours BARGiOORN was taken to the KGB inner prison.

At 0400 hours the Tourist Departnent case officers were

released with instructions to report for duty at 0930

hours.

NOSENKO and the others went home.

KRUPNOV began the

questioning in Russian at 1000

hours the next day.

Although BARGHOORN speaks good Russian,

YEFRENOV remained in case he would be needed to interpret.

NOSENKO entered the room several times during these sessions.

(Although NOSENKO did not want to reveal his face to BARG-

HOORN because he knew BARGHOORN would be released, GRIBAYUV

had. told KOVALENKO that NOSENKO should be there when they

reached the point where BARGHOURN was to tell how he obtained

the damaging naterials.)

on general

matters, such as BARGHOORN's life history.*

After one and one half hours of questioning, BARGROORN

agreed that the

materials

were on him when he was arrested,

but he maintained that they had been placed on his person.

He said that he thought they were "newspapers or sonething,"

that he did not know what they were. The closed package

was then opened and shown to BARGHOORN; It contained about

"BARGHOORN

the date contaïned

in NOSENKO's notes, and indicated that NOSeiKO used the name

NIKOLAYEV. (see belor).

Acknowledging that "naybe" he had used

the name Georgiy Ivarovich NIKOLAYEV with JOHNSON, NOSENKO

said:

"I don't know why I made this mistaxe with the dates.

I

think it (the approach) was the first or second day that I was in

the Seventh (Tourist) Departmen:.

I saw myself that he had

(homosexuali intercourse...

Your date is absolutely right, but

this reminded me that it was soor after I had come in

the

Seventh (Tourist) Department. Is this irportant?"

Question: How long had you been in the Seventh Department?

NOSENKO:

Now I remerber that it was imnediately - one or two

days.

I know I returred in Jaruary 1962.

i knew I

would be going to the Seventh (departrent) already in

December.

I was visiting the Severth already then.

I had not too many papers to turr over to the First

(Arerican Department), and now I remember that I

moved to tre. Seventh immediately (NOSENKO's emphasis)

after 1 January 1962.

b. Information from JOHNSON:

JOHNSON reported to the U.s.

Ericassy in Moscow on 5 Jaruary

1962 that he experienced an

"incident with

Soviet plainclothes-

men in the Hotel Metropol earlier

that day."

JOHNSON, who

arrived in Moscow on 31 December 1961, told the consular officer

that "he was dining alone in the Hotel Metropol restaurant the

evening of 4 January when he was joined at his table by a Soviet

citizen who

identified himself as a doctor from Riga.

(This

was NOSENKO's homosexual agent VOLKOY.)

According to JOHNSoN,

little conversation

transpired because the Riga

"doctor' spoke

English poorly.

Before JOHNSON left, however, the

'doctor.

said he would like to chat with him and knew a student who

spoke English well.

JOHNSON then agreed so come by the 'doc-

tor's' room at the Metropol at 10:00 a.m. the next day. JOHNSON

said that he dropped by the 'doctor's'

room about 10:00 the

morning of January 5.

Soon

after he entered, the

'doctor' and

his 'student' friend

(NOSENKO's homosexual agent YEFREMOV)

began to make homosexual advances to him. He stated that he

protested and was rising to leave when two plainclothesmen

suddenly appeared in the room and announced that all were under

arrest.

JOHNSON was then taken to another room where he was

asked to sign a statement in Russian...

tie signed this state-

ment and was taken to a man in a third room who identified him-

self as the Chief of Police, Georgiy Ivarovich NIKOLOV.*

The

police chief first iold him that Soviet la' had been violated

and that he, JOHNSON, could be imprisoned for three, five, or

perhaps even eight years. After proceeding in this vein for

NOSENKO frequently used the operational pseudonym Yuriv

Ivanovich NIKOLAYEV.

He has said that he was normally

called Georgiy, a variation of Yurly, by family and friends

in Moscow.

5. Attempt to Recruit BRAUNS

a. Information. from NOSENKO:

NOSENKO made the following statemert or. 2 February 19€4:

"In 1962 some U.S. citizen by the name of Forst BRAUNS' came to

the soviet Union.

I mentioned him to you in 1962 but at that

time could not recall his name.*

de tried to recruit him b'it

did not succeed.

le lived somewhere in leringrad, and in 1942

he wert back with the German troops to Germany.

And he served

in the German irmy, and after the war le changed his name and

went to the USh and became a U.S. citizen.

ile is either a

skilled mechanic or a worker.

His real name is different.- it is

Russian - because he changed his nans when he was ir. Germany."

NOSENKO wert into the operation against slAurs in greaer

detail on 17 April 1961:

"This was LK.GJ KRUPWOV's case.

This fellow was a Russian and lived prior to the war in lenin-

grad.

In 1942 he was in Tikhvin, near Lenirgrad, when the

Gernans came, and when the Germans were retreating they took

him along and sone other people, local people.

and so he found

himself in Germany. Now, in Germany, as he told his story, he

was kept in various prison camps and

when the war was over he

worked in West Germany and_then, in 1956 or 1957 or 1958 - 1

don't remember. which year - he came to the United states and

settled dows..

why we became interested in this fellow...

NOSENKO thought his name was somethirg like 'BRUNKS'

or

•BRONX is because he came from Russia.

So,. according to

Soviet law. he never lost his Soviet citizenship...

Leaving

with the Germans is interpreted as treason, as being a traitor

of your country.

So there was something to talk to him about.

Besides. KRUPNOV found gut either in the Information Section

or some other section Lof the KGB First Chief Directoratg/

that the man is working in some: very interesting company that

makes, computers of adding machines or some other instruments.

But when I talked to him he already left the company. He

wasn't working with this company any more.

of the Chief

prosecutor where the incident report,

the first

interrogation, and the

first and second resolutions were

reported to (fnu) MISHUT'IN (Or MISHUSTIN),

the First Deputy

to the Chief Prosecutor.

GRIBANOV further directed that all

materials on BARGIDORN, including infornation from KGB

Archives,

be given to

the Department of Prosecution of the

KGB so

that they could begin the legal proceedings against

BARGHOORN.

After

this,

all.interrogat.ions were conducted

by this department; KRUPNOV was dropped from tlie case,

but YEFREMOV continued to act as interpreter.

D..

Information fron BARGHOORN

SARGHOORN, who had made five carliar trios to the

Soviet Union since 1955, arrived there on 2 October 1963.

The

purpose Of his visit, as stated in his visa application,

was to gather information for a book on how effectively the

Soviet Union was operating as a result of its political ed-

ucation and political systen.

His itinerary took hin to

Leningrad from 2 to 7 October, to Moscow from 7 to 10 Octo-

ber,

Tbilisi from 10 to i7 October,

and short visits to

Tashkent,

Bukhare,

Samarkand, and Alm-ita fron 17 to 25

October.

He flew

fron Alma-Ata to Moscow on 25 October and

was scheduled to leave for Warsaw on 31 October.

On the

latter date he was arrested and held by the KGB until

16 November when, at President Kennedy's intervention, he

was released and left the Soviet Union. BARGHOORN had no

intelligence mission.

Upon his return to the United States, BARGHOORN was

debriefed by the U.S. Department of State

and by CIA.

His

information indicated a high degree of KGB operational in~

terest in him throughout the trip, including encounters with

at least five probable KGB agents during his first reek

there:

an attractive

waitress who invited him to "do the

town," a disenchanted intellectual in Leningrad, an attrac-

•tive unattached girl who sat next to him on

the

flight from

Moscow to Tbilist, and two young Armenians whom he met his

first day in Tbilisi.*

The two Armenians were instrumental

in the drugging described by NOSENKO.

At dinner in his

hotel on the day he arrived in Tbilisi, BARGHOORN met &

joung man claiming to be a student at

the Leningrad Music

Conservatory.

They left the hotel for a walk and ran into

a friend of the student, a second young Armenian, and the

three of them went to a cafe for coffee.

None was arailable,.

*Questioned about this in February 1965,

NOSENKO said that

BARGHOORN, as a suspected American Intelligence agent, wes

of operational interest throughout the trip.

He vaguely re-

called the girl on the plane but either did not know or had

forgotten details of any other specific activity. NOSENKO

said that none of this activity was directly related to the

provocation.operation: which. nas based.ona last-minute de

claton.

but the youn, student went to the kitchen "to arrange things,"

and

shortly thereafter "three foul-tasting coflees"

appeared.

Within an hour, BARGHORN was. in the hospital, acutely-111.

He was assigned to a room where there was another patient,

and a woman doctor took care of his. case.

He was in the

hospital for four days. During this period his clothes,:

notes, and other possessions were held by hospital authori-

ties.

Upon his roturn to Moscow by air on 25 October, BARG-.

HOORN checked into the Metropol Hotel.

The next six days

were occupied by sightseeing and appointments connected with

his research.

•In

the late afternoon of 31 October he called

on frierds at the l.S. Embassy for cocktails, and at 1910,

already 10 minutes late, be left in the Ambassador's car for

a dinner appointment (prearranged by telephone) at the Metro-

pol with Theodore ORCHARD, a British diplomat.

parallels NOSENKO's.

forned Militia officer.

The KGB was called.

Within 30

minutes a

KGB captain (BARGHOORN thought his name night

have been GORBUNSKIY) arrived and began to question him,

assisted by an interpreter named YEFREMOV.*

All question

were asked in Russian, and BARGHOORN answered most of then

in English.

The package of materials was opened and con-

tained, according to BARGHOORN,

13 or 14 photographs of

rockets.

This session lasted until about midnight and

centered around BARGHOORN's possession of the photographs

and his "intelligence mission."

He was then taken to the

Lyubyanka prison.

Interrogations were conducted the next mornirg by the

original KGB officer together with his "chief," whom BARG-

HOORN subsequently identified by photograph as NOSENKO.

The

questioning concerned BARGHOORN's biography, and nothing was

asked about the compromising raterials.

The following day

the case was turned over to a KGB colonel identified as (inu)

PETRENKO, and BARGHOORN did not see NOSENKO or the other KGB

officer again.

At this and subsequent sessions, BARGHOORN

was questioned further concerning the circumstances of his

arrest.

BARGHOORN described NOSENKO as "clever and quick-

witted" and as giving

"the inpression that he ras not a

dedicated careerist,

but opportunistic and adaptive; he

seemed

not to care about what he was doing, but doing a good

Job nevertheless."

*Asked why YEFREMOV used his true name during the interro-

gations, NOSENKO said this was necessary for legal reasons..

that he had to sign documents connected with the interroga-

tions.

BARGHOORN confirmed that. YEFREMOV had participated

throughout the.entire series of interrogations and had

signed interrogation reports attesting to the accuracy of

translation.

BOLSHAKOY, Robert Kennedy, and the Cuban Missile Crisis

a. Iatroduction

JOSENKO volunteered at his s+cond meety with CIA

in January 1904 that GoN. BOLSHAKOŸ was his "old friend"

and that he was a colonel in the CrU.

On. 26 January,

I February, and 19 August 1964 he again raised BOLSHAKOV'S

name,

enphasizing that he was a GRU

officer and a "good

friend."

In the 1 February interview, after displaying an.

initial reluctance to discuss with CIA such a "sensitive"

subject, he provided a numbor of details on BOLSHAKOV's

alleged rclationship in 1962 with tle then Attorney General,

Robert Kennedy.

His

information on this subject,

he said,

derived from his friendship with BOLSHAKOY in Moscow, where

BOLSHAKOV was reassigned (in December 1962 following a tour

in Washington as Novosti correspondent and editor of the

magazine USSR).

JOSENKO ciained a personal role in this

afrair,

in that he personally proposed to the KGB leader-

ship that the KGB. take over BOLSHAKOV's forzer (GRU) con-

tact with Robert Kennedy.

NOSENKO claimed that an information channel of con-

munication between BOLSHAKOV aud the Attorney Ceneral had

developed at Kenredy's initiative.

He described in detali

the circumstances of their introduction at a social function

by a journalist (whom he did not name).

He said that be

"thought" that the Kennedys knew that BOLSHAKOY was a

"military intelligence officer," and he implied that they

regarded these private conversations with BOLSHAKOV as &

useful instrument of diplomacy.

According to JOSENKO, the

KGB knew that CIA was not aware of this relationship-it

was "obvious" that Robert Kennedy wanted it that way.

NOSENKO claimed that after BOLSHAKOV left the United States

"during the Cuban missile rrisis,"* no one took over his

role as a confidential channel to the White House.

After

the assassination of the President, NOSENKO continued, the

Kennedy family tried to reestablish the relationship through

their close triend, the artist Milliam. WALTON, during the

latter's visit to Moscow in Dicenber 1963. NOSENKO reported

that he had urged

that the KGB try to take over the Rokert

Kennedy operation from the GRU and that he had proposed two

plans which would have enabled this to take place, the

second involving WALTON.

Neither came to fruition, however.

Referring to the Cuban missile crisis, NOSE KO said that the

GRU had "played dirty" with BOLSHAKOV by forcing him to "tell

Robert" that there were no offensive missiles in Cuba whereas

there actually were such weapons there.

According to other

for Moscow on 3 August 1962 and returned on 2 October 1962.

on 23 august, about the time that CIA was reporting urgently

to the President that "something new and different" was

going on with respect to Soviet aid to Cuba, Anbassador

DOBRYNIN assured Theodore SORENSEN. (Special Counsel to the

President) that the United States had no need to fear Soviet

SOSENKO's Statements on BOLSHAKOV

NOSENKO repeatedly eophasized BOLSHAKOV's CRU affilia-

tion

and the

fact that the KGB was in no way irvolred in

tr.1s

charnel to the U.S. Coverrment via Robert Kennedy.

He first volunteered BOLSHAKOl's rase during a discussion

of the use of Novosti as

a cover organization for Soviet

Intelligence officers.

"Suriy BOLS:liKOV of the GRU also

sits there, " he said.

"He is a colonel and a friend of

nine."

Two days

later,

out of context with

the preceding

discussion, he introduced the name again:

"Then

there is

this BOLSHAKOV.

He is fron GRU who was in the United

States."

NOSESKO then cormented that this was "a very in-

teresting case" and added:

"We shall talk about it later."

when his case

oflicer trercupon turned to

another topic,

NOSENKO immediately interrupted to say:

"I know BOLSHAKOV

very well.

He is my old

friend...l met him through Yurly

GUk... (who was with hin in the

United States...and we are

now very good friends.

He calls me up and consults me for

advice...

On 1 February 1964 NOSESKO said no thought the

Kennedy family knew BOLSHAKOV to be a military inteiligence

officer; "yet for sore reason they chose hin" as a channel

between the li.s. ard Soviet Goverrments.

BOLSHAKOV, NO-

SENKO added,

"reported directly" to

the Chief of the GRU

concerning his exchanges with Robert Kennedy.

JOSENKO Said BOLSHAKOY was introduced to Robert Kennedy

by an

American journalist (unnamed) at a ricoption in the

United States.

The jourralist invited BOLSHAKOV to go for

a walk,

and

as they

strolled "down an alley," there was a

"The jour-

man sitting

on

nalist said:

'Listen,

•1stech derrie (BOLSHAKV), are you acquainted

with Robert Kennedy,

the brothar of the President and the

Chief of the Departuent of Justice?'

BOLSHAKOV said:

'No.

Of course, I have heard of him.

•Would you like me to

introduce you?'

"Of course, " BOLSHAKOV said,

'please do.'

He led him to the man on the banch.

There was this feeling

that all this had been pra-arranged. "

This contact'was at the personal dosire of Bob Kennedy...

BOLSHAKOV was called ia for this.

As you know, the whole

idea of this contact was to pass information to Kennedy

froM KIPUSHCHEV and from Kernedy to KHRLSHCHEV....It happened

to be BOLSHAKOV, but it was not

BOL-SHAKOY who sought to

have the meeting....Then the relationship grew. BOLSHAKOV

was a visitor in Robert Kennedy's inouse.

They would first

talk about ordinary things,

and then the conversation

turned to other mattars...Robert Kennedy did not say:

"Please tell KHRUSHCHEY

so-and-so.'

He would say:

•You

know, some of these problems seem

insoivable." And BOL-

SHAKOV would say:

'And you know, at hore they think this

and that way...

without sctually saying that this was coming

IrOn KHRUSHCHEV.

But, of course,

this was clear sithout

explanations.

It was ar exchange of views on important poll-

tical questions

of the soment.

He was like an intermediate

point..."

NOSENKO commented that he persorally thought

that it was a "case of mutual

"feelers' being sent out by

both sides-exploring some given current political situation."

After BOLSHAKOV left Washington, NOSENKO stated, Do one

replaced him as a chancel to the U.S. Governnent..

whether ZINCHUK could have taken over upon BOLSHAKOV'g

like there was belore.

It was broken at the tine BOL-

SHAKOV left. ZINCilY. was an agent or a cooptre....No,

there is no guch contact since BOLSHAKOY left. He pRsses

no more nessages."

Referring to the Kennedy-BOLSHAKOV contacts, NOSENKO

told CIA on 26 January 1964:

"You have shown considerable

interest in him !BOLS!LAKOVl, even after his return to the

Soviet Union... because all this was done by by-passing clA."

Ho said on l February 1961:

"It was pretty obvious: that

this

relationship between BOLSHAKOV and Robert Kennedy had

nothing to do with ClA,

and CIA was not witting of 1t.

It

was at the perschal desire of Bob jenredy."

The KGB

determined that CIA was uraware of the exchange between

Kennedy and BOLSHAKOV, NOSENKO reported, because when BOL-

SHAKOV was subsequently invited to a receptiou at the U.S.

Embassy. In Moscow, two CIA officers--Kenneth A. KERST and

Malcolm A. TOON+--tried to slicit information fron him

about his relatiorship with President Kennedy.

"The most.

important thing" they had tried to find out,

accordanz to

NOSENKO, wag whetter the President and BOLSHAKOV had met

personally.

Although BOLSHAKOV did rot adait the fact to

them, he did have one

meeting with President Kennedy--"he

was brought in a car...and was taken through a back door

into the ihite House, "

NOSENKO said.

NOSENKO reported that will am WALTON visited

Moscow :in Docem-

ber 1963 and at that time went to BOLSHAKOV, whom he had

previously met at the home of Robert Kennedy.

Part of

their conversations, he continued, related to Robert Kennedy's

future political plans:

"WALTON said that Bobbj... did not

expect at present to become a candidate for the vice presi

dency.

He was, perhaps, according to WALTON, thinking of

running for Goversor

of lassachusetts..."

NOSENKO said he

felt that there were "some feelers sent out on

the part of

VALTON--not exactly questions, but just a passing of opinion.

WALTON was trying to sound them out, but I think that every-

thing was left without an answer....My personal opinion was

that these things were told to wALton so that he coule pasa

them on as, so to speak, Bouby's plans for the future."

Another topic covered in the WALTON-BOLSHAKOV discussions,

NOSENKO added, was the assassination of President Kennedy. **

"As I remember, it was WALTON's opinion--and his opinion re-

flected the opinion of the Kennedy family--that there was

no Russian involvement in the murder of the President. No

suspicion at all."

NOSENKO proposed two plans whereby the KGB could take

over the GRU's channel to President Kennedy.

first of these plans, the Sovlet Minister of Justice would

personally invite the Attorney General to cone: tä the Soviet

Union.

There the KGB would "set him up in private. living

quarters, give his everything he wants...so that he would be

"Neither KEKST, ko NOSENKO said was suspected by the KGB

of being the CIA Chief of Station in Moscow, nor TOON was

affiliated with CIA in any way.

My time in

grade was up in December, in December of last

year (1961)."

At the first of his 1964 meetings

with CTA in Geneva HOSENKO lad in his possession the ten-

porary duty authorization which he said he had been issued

in December 1963 to travel ¿rom Moscow to Gorkly Oblast in

connection with the search for CHEREPASOV.* This official

igB paper had been signed by O.M. GRIBANOV, Chief of the

second Chies Directorate, and authorized. "Licutenant Colonel

Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO to visit the local kgB organiza-

tion in Gorkij Oblast on official business between 15 and

30 December 1963."

It bure official starps of arrival and

departure in December 1963, as attested by officials in the

town of Shakhunya.

10 February 1964:

In Frankfurt, while awaiting ex-

filtration to the UnIted States, NOSENKO was asked to review

a biographic statement which had been prepared by his case

officers on the basis of statements he had made during the

1962 and 1964 meetings in Geneva.

NOSENKO went over the

biography carefully, noted several changes, and then stated

that it was correct.

The biography included the inforcatios

that NOSENKO had served in the U.S. Embassy

Section of the

American Department as a senior lieutenant Prom 1952 [sic)

to 1955, that he was promoted to captain in 1956, to major

in 1959, and to lieutenant colonel in November 1963, shortly

before leaving Moscow for Geneva.

8 April 1964: NOSENKO was questioned about the date

when he became a

senior lieutenant, and he replied:

think in the end of i53 or the beginning of '54 I got the

senior lieutenant."

16 June 1964: Asked to list in chronological order the

date

"i his promotions within the KGB from the date of

entry, NOSENKO stated:

"I began in the GRU as a junior

lieutenant. While in the GRH I became a lieutenant: and I

entered the KGB with this rark in 1953.

Not long after I

entered the KGB I became a senior lieutenant, but i don't

know the month. It was still 1953.

In 1956 I was promoted

to the rank of captain.

I don't know the month.

I became

a major ir 1959.

I don't know the month.

In October 1963

me on

told that GRIBANOV wanted to see me.

I went to his office,

but, of course, I didn't let hin know that I already knew

that I had been promoted.

He gave me his congratulations.

You never see the attestation. It goes into your official

file."

26 January 1965:

While discussing his role as case

officer for V.S. Embassy Security Officar John ABIDIAN,

NOSENKO volunteered out of context that he had never offi-

clally been a major.

He explained this situation as

follows:

Having been promoted to the rank of senior

Ileutenant in April 1953, he vecame eligible for the rank

of captain in 1956.

when this time came, however, he was

not promoted because a senior KGB official held against

him his illegal use of KCB documents to cover treatment for

gonorrhea in 1954.

NOSENKO therefore remained

a senior

Ileutenant until 1959, when he would have been eligible

for promotion to the rank of major had he received his

captaincy on schedule.

Although GRIBANOV had promised NO-

SENKO that he would be promoted directly from senjor lieu-

tenant to major, skipping the rank of captain, an

admini-

strative error was made by the KGB

Personnel Office,

and

NOSENKO found when the orders were issued that he had in

stead been pronoted only to captain.

Instead of rectifying

this mistake, GRIBANOY persuaded NOSENKO that it would be

to his advantage

to renain a captain until he became eligible

for promotion

to lieutenant colonel in

1963.

-In-this manner- ft

turned out that he

never officially held the rank of major."

O August 1965; under questioning by DERiABIN, NOSEYKI

epeated the chronology of his pronotions given an 26 Januar

1965.

He again explained. that he was put up for captain in

1956, but this time sald that the:pronotion had been blocked

on the grounds that he should he made to wait because of

shortconings in his work.

Asked why he had told CIA that he

had been a major during the 1962 meetings and again in the

biography prepared in Frankfurt, NOSENKO replied that he

thought the true story would not be believed.

17 April 1966:

In a voluntary statement, NOSENKO wroto

the

following: In March

1951, with the rant of jundor lleu-

tanant, I started service in Naval Intelligence of the Seventh

Flcut in Sovetskaya Gavan...Fron August 1952 until 1953, I

19 April 1966:

In a new version of his autobiography,

NOSENKO Included The following statement:

"in July 1956. 1

became & candidate member of the CPSU, soon after which I re-

ceived a pronotion at work: I became a senior case officer

and was given the rank of serior licutenant.

I was accepted into the OPSU, and during the second half of

1958 was appointed Dejuty Chief of thr Second Section, Seventh

Departuent.

On 29 Decenber 1959 1 was pronoted to the rank of

captain.

26 October 1966: "I lied when I said I was a lieutenant

colonel in 1954.

"Twas only a captain."

Asked why he had

said in 1962 that he was then a major, NOSENKO replied:

"There was no conversation about rank in 1962.

About my po-

sition, I said I was in the Tourist Department. That's all."

To summarize what NOSENKO has said about his ranks while

•serving in the KGB:

He became a senior licutenant in 1952,

April 1953, 1954, or 1956; a captain ir.

1956 or September/Octo-

ber/December 1959: A major in December 1958 or 1959; and &

lieutenant colonel in October/November 1963.

(The latter

claim was verified by the official KCB document listlng him as

& lleutenant colonel as of December 1963.)

NOSENKO has indicated that his highest rank in the KGB was

captain, and that he never advanced

to a majority or a lieu

tenant colonelcy.

Avards and Decorations

Not long alter reestablishing contact with CIA in

January 1964, NOSENKO mertioned that he had received the

Order of Lenin

"shortly after the 1962 meetirgs" in Geneva

as a reward

for the ideas which he had developed

to "'en-.

large the experience and improve the quality" of KGB Second

Chief Directorate staff personnel in Moscow.* Diring the

first series of interrogations, NOSEYKO on 6 April 1964.

claimed that he was awarded the Order of Lenin in 1963 for:-

his work in the Tourist Department, KGB Second Chief Direct

torate, after receiving the Order of the Red Banner in 1962

for his performances while in the American Department.

The following discussion of the subject took place on

6 April 1964:

JOSENKO: Yes, -I received a big gold medal.

NOSENKO: Yes.

#NOSENKO has described the Order of Lenin as the highest

decoration for which a KGB officer can

be eligible.

**In June 1964 NOSENKO said that the only Second Chief Direc-

torate officer whom he knew to have. received this award was

V.A. CHURANOV, Chief of the British Embassy Section, who re

cruited William John VASSALL (see PART VI.D. 5.b.).

On the

that, in 1959, his name was sübmitted

for the Order of the

Red Banner in conrection with these recruitrents, but that

he did not get it, probably sciause he was transferred to

the First Department at that time (January 1950), NOSENKO

has described the Order of the Red Banner as the third

highest award a KGE officer may receive.

Asked what KGB

officers had received this award, NOSENKO said on i0 June

.1954 that GRIBANOV, SAKHAROVSKIY: and several other high-

ranking KGB officers were awaided it for che important role

they played in smashing the Huagarian Revolution in 1956.

** On 15 April 1964 NOSENKO had said that he received the

Order of the Red Star, along with a group of other Second

Chief Directorate oificers, at the end of December 1962.

He recalled this because they were planning the presenta-

tion for the anniversary of the KGB on 20 December, but

the presentation was delayed and was not made until the

end of the month.

NOSENKO and about

70 other officers of

the Second Chief Directorate, Ircluding KOVSHUK and G.I.

GRYAZNOV, received the award "simply

NOSENKO cold DERYABIN in August 1965

that the order accompanying his award had read:

"For ex-

ceptional performance of mission."

When asked what mission

was involved, NOSENKO replied chat the award was just for

NOSESKO said on 26 October 1966 that he never re-

ceived any KGB award or decoration

for his operational

The only awards he received during his KGS career,

he sald, were a Red Army anniversary medal and the awaid

for satisfactory completion of trin years of service.

#NOSENKO's wording

here reflects earlier intensive ques-

cioning concerning the ten-year service medal.

NOSENKO said

on 15 April 1964:

"In 1962 I had ten years of service in

the KGB and got a medal for unblenished service. It is

usually given for ten years and to KeB men only....That was

in 1962.

I had ten years of service then."

When it was

pointed out that, according to his: most recent statement,

he had Joined the KGB in March 1953 and therefore would

have had only nine years of service in 1962, NOSENKO said he

did not understand why but that he was certain that he had

been given the medal, after his return from Geneva in 1962.

(The 1962 date is consistent with NOSENKO's earlier statenents

that he joined the KGB in 1952.

The following day, 17 April

1964, NOSENKO said that he remembered why he had received

the medal in 1962 rather than 1963; this medal, he recalled,

is awarded to servicemen as well as KGB officers, and prior

nilitary service is taken into accoust in computing the

service time for the latter. NOSENKO had entered the GRU:

in 1950 and therefore should have received. the ten-year

medal in 1960. Because o a nix-up in the-KGB Personnel

Department he did not receive it until 1962.

•HOSENKO arrived in Geneva on 19 January 1964.

H. NOSENKO's. Relationship with GRIBANOV

1: Information from NCSENKO

a. Summary

From the time of his first meetings with CIA in 1962, NOSENKO

maintained that he had a close personal and professional

relation-

Ship with Major. General O.M. GRIBANOV, Chief of tre second Chief

Directorate.

NOSENKO has described recruitment approacties in which

he and GRIBANOV took part together,

conversations they had on opera-

tional matters, the role which GRIBANOV played in his rank promo-

tions and receipt of various awards, and his afterhours carousing

with GRIBANOV and First Chief Directorate ccunterinteiligence

officer Ye.A. 'TARABRIN.

NOSENKO has also freguently mentioned the

role which GRIBANOV played in nis, HOSENKO's, professional advance-

ment within the KGB:

GRIANOV was wholly responsible, against

NOSENKO's wishes, for his appointment to the position of Deputy

Chief of the U.S. Embassy

section of

the American

Department

in

January 1960; later, when NOSENKO rejected his offer to make him

Deputy Chief of the

entire American Department, GRIBANOV arranged

his return to the Tourist Department as Chief of the American

Tourist Sectior. and

his later appointment as Depity Chief of the

Tourist Department.

NOSENKO's remarks concernirg

his direct involvement with

GRIBANOV in operations against Americans are included in other

parts of this paper.

Among then are his early statements on the

approach to code clerk James STORSBERG

(Part V.E.3.c.), bis 1962

account of the arres: and attempt to recruit ClA sificer Russell

LANGELLE (Part VI.D. Toa.), and his early reports on the attempt to

reCruit CIA officer

Edward Ellis SMITil (Part VI.D.2.).

In all

three cases NOSENKO subsequently denied having played

the role he

originally attributed to himself ara denied having had personal

contact with the Americans involved.

NOSENKO has also altered his

original accounts to say that he received no awards or decoration

for operational activity and that he had not received the promo-

tions he claimed.

b. Details

The statements of NOSENKO given below concern primarily his

personal relationship with GRIBANOV and how GRIBANOV assisted

his rapid rise within the organization of the Second Chief Direc-.

torate.

12 June 1962:

"Oleg

Mikhaylovich GRIBANOV is a great guy.

A real pal.

course!

He

is the highest chief.

'I don't drink

cognac.

I'll have vodka,' I say.

Well, we'll have vodka

then, '

(GRIDANOV says)..."

One of NOSENKO'S CIA handlers suggested at

this point that GRIBANOV seemed to treat NOSENKO as an older

brother would. NOSENKO replied:

"That's his attituce toward

ne."

23 April 1964

Question: • Did you ever go to GRIBAliOV's house?

NOSENKO: 'I never went in the house. I have driven to it.

Question: Did he ever come to your house?

NOSENKO :

No.

Question:

Were you ever out at night with him, after work?

If so, how, under what circumstances?

NOSENKO:

After work? Yes, once.

Question:

Who else was there?

NOSENKO:

TARABRIN.

Question: What was the occasion?

NOSENKO :

No specific reason.

GRIBANOV called me at midnight.

I could hear that he was already drinking; he asked

NOSENKO:

I might have seen him in 1953 or 1954, but I did not

have a chance to

group operational Speak to him then.

Once I was in two

discussions (about 15 people present)

about work against Military Attaches in

1954, that was

the first time I ever spoke to him..

Question:

when did you first have any personal conversation with

NOSENKO:

Question:

NOSENKO :

I don't remember.

He gathered groups of people:

Maybe I was with hin with KozLov anu

others in Tourist

Department li.e., between 1955 and 19601.

when did you develop a personal relationship with him?

It is difficult to say how it got started.

I was

still working in tre Seventh

Department.

It was in

1958, 0r maybe 1957.

KOZLOV suddenly called me and

said

I should immediately report to GRIBANOV.

I did,

and GRIBANOV said:I should quickly be ready to go to

a reception with him at the Indian Embassy, with him

and Vera [Ivanovnal ANDREYEVA.

question: Why you?

NOSENKO:

I don't know...

Oh, yes, this is the story.

this is it, this is

why he started favoring me.

Earlier,

some time in 1953, I knew some girls, Nira

on

Pokrovskiy Boulevard and her girlfriend, Rina GUDKOVA,

friends of (Yu.I.) GUK and (V.M.) KOVSHUK and (V.A.)

CHURANOV.

CHURANOV was a friend of TARABRIN, who was

a friend of GRIBANOV.

Through TARAbRIN he got acquainted

with these girls, and TARABRIN brought them to GRIBANOV'S

dacha one night.

The girls were talkative and told me

all about it, and said they'd told CHURANOV. I told

CHURANOV who warned me not

to mention it.

I never did,

and GRIBANOV learned about this and liked it; he re-

marked once: "You are not a gossiper..."

Question:

How did he find out that you knew and didn't tell any-

one?

NOSENKO: I don't know, but he did.

Question:

NOSENKO :

Who wrote your fitness reports?

My last one was written by (V.D.] CHELNOKOV.

The one

before that by (V.A.l KLYPIN, in the First Department.

Before that in the Seventh Department it was written

by [K.N.] DUBAS, before him by [V.A.l KOZLOV,

then

(S.V.) PERFILYEV and before then, in the First Depart-

ment, by (A.M. I GORBATENKO.

Question:

NOSENKO:

Did GRIBANOV ever write a fitness report on you?

He may not have actually written them, but he signed

them, those reports written in connection with pro-

notions to higher jobs or for trips abroad, or general

reviews of personnel.

15 February 1965 (from a protocol signed 20 February 1965) :

"Before I joined the KGB in 1953 I had never heard the name of.

Oleg Mikhaylovich GRIBANOV and knew nothing about him.

it may have been several montis after I

have

been

particularly important to me.

Sometimes during 195: and 1955, it

was necessary to obtain the signature of a Depicy Chief of the

Second Chief Directorate on a cable that. I had written

and, if

SHUBNYAKO: was absent at the time, I would take it to GRIBANOV

for approval.

Though I was only a junior case officer at the

time, I would take the cable, after it had been approved ty the

Chief of Section and the Chief of Department, directiy to GRIBANOV,

who would simply sign it with

no discussion.

I do not cerember how

many times I

took cables to GRIBANOV nor do I rementer the contents

of any specific one of them. The first meeting with GRIBANOV

that

I specifically remember was in the summer of 1956.

I think it was

in June.

I had returned from Kiev with KOZLOV and, after writing

a SpravKa on BURGI, PERFILYEV, KOZLOV, and I went to see GRIBArOV.

KOZLOv didn't introduce me to GRIBANOV at that time, out GRIBANDV

knew that I was NOSENKO because the plan for the BugGI operation

said that I would participate and because PERFILYEV had made an

appointment for the three of us to speak to GRIS'WUV at this time.

The neeting lasted about 30 or 40 minutes. GRIBANOV read the re-

port on BURGI's recruitment and asked sore questions.

KOZLOV

answered some of these and I answered others.

Other than asking

what Ukrainians

took part in the operation, I can recall none of

GRIBAlOV's questions nor do I remember any of the conversation

which took place at this meeting.

When we were through, KOZLOV

and I left while PERFILYEV remained with GRIBAYOV..

Perhaps the

first time I was alone with GRIBANOV was in 1958 when I attended

a reception giver by the Indian Embassy at the Sovetsiaya Hotel

in Moscow.

Usually (A.V.] SUNTSOV accompanied GRIBAVOV on such

occasions, butyhe was sick at the time.

I don't knos why SUNTSOV

usually went with GRIBANOY, why I was

selected to go, or what I

was supposed to do at the reception.

I think GRIBANOV called the

Seventh Department and asked whom he could use, but I don't know

why he picked

ne.

GRIBANOV told me that, at the reception, I was

to refer to him as Aleksey Mikhaylovich GORBUNOV.

I was to

introduce myself as Yuriy Ivanovich and if anybody asked, would use

the last nane NIKOLAYEV. Vera ANDREYEVA, who went with us, used

the name vera Ivannv.:i. After work, I went home to change my

clothes and we went In GRIBANOV's car from the KGB to the Hotel

Sovetskaya.

GRIBANOV sat in front with the driver and I sat in

back with Vera ANDREYEVA. I cannot say how many times I have seen

GRIBANOV altogether.

From 1959 on I saw him more frequently.

Sometimes, GRIBANOV would call meetings of chiefs of sections and

their deputies and I would take part in these.

DUBAS,

reason for my having been selected.

GRIBANOV did tell me that my

appointment was a part of his personal plan to raise to more

senior positions a number of younger officers, including

and Aleksey SUNTSOV.

The decision for me to return to the Seventh

Dapartment in January 1962 was actually made in about September of

October 1961.

GRIBANOV planned to appoint me Deputy Chief of the

First Department, but the new Chief of the First Department,

FEDOSEYEV, wanted KOVSHUK to take this position.

had already spoken to CHELNOKOV, who vias then Chief of the Seventh

Department, about this matter:

and he had suggested that I go to

GRIBANOV and ask to be returned to the Seventh Departmert.

GRIBAROY

finally agreed that I should

return

to tre Seventh Department as

Chief of the first Seccion with the

understanding that I

would be

appointed Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department as soon as this

position would be vacated by (B.n.) BALDIN.

In July 1962 I was

appointed Deputy. Chief of the Seventh Department.

This decision

was male by CHELOKOY and GRIBANOV in

accordance with the intertion

stated by GRIBANOV at the end of 1961 that I should be appninted

to this position as soon as possible. I had no further personal

di cussions with GRIBNIOV about this

appointment at this time.

In

1963 CHELNOKOV ¡GRIBANOV'S Deputy, F.D.I BOBKOV, and GRISANOV

decided that I should be named

First Deputy Chief of the Seventh

Departrent.

they id not discuss this with ma beforehand and no

order was issued about this appointment.

I was simply told that

from that time I would be considered as First Deputy Chief of tre

Department.

At this time I was, in sact, the only Deputy Chief of

the Seventh Department,

since KOROBOV did not come to the seventh

Department until about

November or December 1963.

GRIBANOV did

not tell re his reasons for appointing me

Deputy Chief of the

First Section, First Department in January 1960,

for warting to

appoint ne Deputy Chief of the first bepartment in late 1961, or

for appointing me Section Chief ind later Deputy Chief of the

Seventh Department in 1962.

He did not discuss with me my personal

qualifications for each of these positions.

GRIBM"OV had nothing

at all to do with my assignment to Geneva

in 1962.

I thirk that

the kharakteristika witten about me for this trip was signed by

BOBKOV,

since he was the Deputy Chief of the Second Chief Direc-

torate who supervised the Seventh Department.

I did not personally

discuss

this

trip with GRIBANOV before my departure from Moscow.

My candidacy for this assignment was supported oy BANNIKOV, the

Deputy Chief of the Second Chief Directorate who

supervised the

work of the Eleventh Department which had the investigative file

on SHAKOV. BANNIKOV was concerned with the question of who would

go as case officer on this trip because SHAKOV, who was suspected

• of possibly being a western agent, was to be in the delegation.

There was no background or neighborhood investigation conducted

on me in connection with my being approved for this trip.

assignment was approved by the Eleventh Department, by the Person-

nel Office of the Second Chief Directorate, by the Central Personnel

Office of the KGB and by the Central Committee of the cest.

GRIPANOV

had absolutely nothing to do with my assignment to Geneva in 1964.

The kharakteristika on me for this trip was signed by BOBKOV.

FOI

the 1964 trip no decision of approval of the Central Committee of

the CPSU was required for me or for any of the other members of

the delegation who had been approved for the 1962 trip.

KHLOBU-

STOV, PANCHENKO, and KOVALENKO supported me for the assignment as

a personal favor

to me. I did not discuss my 1964 trip to Geneva

with GRIBANOV prior to my departure.. In fact, I was even afraid

that GRIBANOV would find out that I

was going

and would object to

my making this second trip."

23: February 1965: NOSENKO commented further on his social

With GRIBAYOV and TAPARPIN.

The following, which was

not included in the protocol quoted above, is tikur fiom case

officer notes.

Question: Teil me about the occasions when you were with GRIBANOV

and TARABRIN.

NOSENKO:

Three times--drinking in cafes.

Twice afterwards there

were girls.

The most recent time was ir. September or

October 1963. I don't remenber the firit time..

In

1963 I received a call from TARARI!! at home.

Then

GRIBANOV got on the phone and told me to take his car

and come join them

at the Praga Restaurant.

I didn't

take his car because I didn't want to call the duty-

officer.

I took a cab and vent to the Fraga.

They

were sitting there and drinking in a private room.

I

joined them.

They were drinking chanpagne, but I took

cognac.

TARABRIN suggested girls about. 1230 and GRIBANOV

made

me go to the office to get my nutebook. I called

one girl I knew--ner and her sister.

wein" I got back

to the restaurant it was closed with only GRIBANOV and

TAPÄBRIN still there.

We lent to the girls' (apartment).

They weren't prostitutes exactly. I knew her before.

Question:

Is this why GRIBANOV called you to the restaurart (i.e..

to provide girls)?

NOSENKO:

I think so.

It was the second time I had participated

in this.

This last time CRIBANOV told the

girl his

name.

The girl works in the Archives of the First Chief

Directorate.

At that time of night I rasn't able to

reach anyone else.

Her name is Galin likhaylovna.

Her mother works in the Central Committee.

I don't

remember her last name.

GRIBANOV was drinking and she

told him that she had

quarreled with ZAYTSEV, the Chief

of the First Chief Directorate Archives.

GRIBANOV

told her that he would give her a job and told me to

arrange for a job in the American Department of the

Second Chief Directorate for her.

Galina's flat is in

the building inhabited by Central Committee workers on

Kutuzovskiy Prospekt.

GRIBANOV's driver drove him

home at 0600 and he was in the office by 0830.

3 March 1965:

Speaking of the damage his disclosures must

have caused the KGB, NOSENKO

"I believe they will punish

people in the Second Chief Directorate (SCD]...

Even GRIBANOV...

He was personally responsible, as head of the

SCD, for pushing

me ahead."

Question: What sort of punishment?.

NOSENKO: Even firing.

Question:

Do you think any others would be punished, or even

fired?

NOSENKO:

Maybe KOVALENKO, BOBROV, and people in the Eleventh

Department. Many others, too.

Later

in the same session the interrogator returned to this subject.

The following is a transcript of the discussion:

Question:

You said you trink GRIBANOV might be fired.

Yet, there

is nothing in the protocol you signed. (see ajovel about

your relations with GRIBANOV which would seem to make

him personally responsible for you.

Is there something

else, something you haven't told me?

NOSENKO:

Question:

No.

Why then do you think GRIBANOV wouls be fired?

NOSENKO:

(no answer)

Question:

(repeats)

NOSENKO:

Don't know.

Question: Hell, what is your opinion at lcast?

NOSENKO:

Nothing, nothing. Let's not discuss this.

Question:

NOSENKO :

why not?

It's simply my opinion, that's all. I don't know why.

Question:

NOSENKO:

well, what is your cpinior?

He was responsible for my becoming Deputy Chief of

Department.

Question:

But you had already gotten ahead before: you said he

didn't help you become Deputy Chief of Section in 1958.

NOSENKO: Yes.

Question: Did you ever hear any gossip about his help to you?

NOSENKO :

It was said in the SCD that he helped me become Chief

of Section and Deputy Chief of Department.

Question:

NOSENKO:

Why would BOBKOV be punished?

le was my supervisor, and in '61 he was Secretary o

ne kGB Party Organization

Question:

Would others in the Party Organization be punished?

NOSENKO:

Yes, also in the Party Organization of the Seventh

Department and of the SCD.

Question:

• Would BANNIKOV be punished?

NOSENKO:

No.

Be did nothing, just supported my candidature for

Geneva:

Question: Would KOVSHUK: be punished?

NOSENKO:

No. I wasn't close to them, except GuK.

Question:

NOSENKO:

He said:

about this, but he

approved

my appointment (to Deputy Chief of Lepartment) anyway.

Why did he promote you?

GRIBANOV thought I was a young, astive guy. Six re-

cruitnents--oh,

they weren't much,

but it

sounds

great for the First Department, which was having no

success with Americans in the Embassy.

But why make you Deputy Chief of Department?

He thought I was a tough juy, good case officer. In

159 I saw hin often and was involved in a lot of

operations which were reported to him.

But it was not then, but in 1961, when he made you

Deputy Chief of Department.

(shrugs)

Who would officially approve a Deputy Chief of Depart-

ment?

Must be higher than a Department Chief--bec. ise

GRIBANOV signed.

They could get him for his, especially

those who are against GRIBANOV.

Who?

Question:

NOSENKO:

well, IVANOV, who wanted to get promoted to deputy

Chief of-Department in 59-60 but didn't. " He was in an

Inspection group of the Collegium, checking the Seventh

Department.:

BANNIKOV was the acting Chief of the

NOSENKO also said that it was BANNIKOV who spongored NOSENKO's

During this meeting, GAMiRELIDZE raised the subject sf

to GOLITSYN that the irfoimation so clusuly overlapped his oun

KOVSHUK, and CHURANOV, that the péssikility of disiufernation

was suspected, perhaps

previously reported on him; CiA records, however, shou that

GOLITSYN had reported only on, one Aleksandi Feioseyevich NOSENKO,

who had been a KGB officer in Japan when RASTVOROV defected to

the U.S. in 1954. GOLITSYN made no further comments on these

except to say that one identified as KGB had left that

organization in 196l for the MVD. GOITSYN said that in general,

lacking the full details necessary for an assessment, he could

say that there were

serious signs of disinformation in what ne

had scen; he wanted to see the full information on

the case.

Subseguently GOLITSYN made numerous demands for this informa-

tion, complaining to Attorney General Robert KENNEDY and senior

CIA officials because his request had not been granted.

On 10 February 1964 NOSENKO's defection from the Soviet Disarma-

ment delegation in Geneva, Switzerland, was publicized, including

his RGB affillation

when GOLIISTY heard this news he immediately

recalled the June 1962 "letter" In Switzerland and Linked NOSENKO
