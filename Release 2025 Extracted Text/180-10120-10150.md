SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

NAME Sgt. Lewis Wesley LEBER

Address Headquarters TAC

Date 2/24/78 Time 12:03P.M.

Place Bldg. #693 Hgs. TAC

LangLey AFBi VA

Interview:

Due to the nature of the interview, Dod approval was sought and

acquired prior to scheduling contact with Sgt. LEBER. The

sensitive nature of the military activities at Langley AFB also

required that approval be given to Sgt. Leber to participate in

the interview with the undersigned, which in turn resulted in

the presence of two military personnel at the outset of the

session, namely Colonel Gene D. Hunter and Special Agent Davia

(804)764-7778

Herb Pelham, both of the USAF Office of Special Investigations.

Because of the awkward circumstances, the two civilian-

attired military observers were asked to leave the room

to help

Sgt. Leber

relax and to encourage freer recall. Without ob-

jection, both observers left soon after the interview began.

During the course of the conversation with Sgt. Leber,

the following information was elicited:

1. Subject recalled the full name of the person in

question as Captain William C. STANLEY, Special Security Officer

for Headquarters TAC-Intelligence. Captain Stanley had been

working under a Major Rudolph GOBEL sometime during 1970 and/or

1971.

2. Since Leber was transferred to Hqs. TAC at

Langley AFB in 1970, he only knew STANLEY for approximately

2-3 months (exact time unknown). However, during this period

of time, LEBER does not recall any conversation with STANLEY

relative to the JFK assassination, Russia, Cuba and/or Mexico.

3. LEBER stated that Capt. STANLEY was an ex-enlisted

man who had served 16 years in the Army and was about 38 years

of age in 1970. He was possibly "r.i.f.'ed" from the service

in 1971 and was said to have had severe financial problems.

4. Further, it is believed that Capt. STANLEY left

the service and went to study law at the University of Miami

(Florida) in 1971.

5. Two servicemen were identified as having served

under Capt. STANLEY, namely Larry F. CAISON and Chief Master

Sergeant Charles FISCHER, about whom, it was felt, additional

information could be secured.

Following the termination of the interview, assistance

was provided in obtaining the addresses of the above-referenced

servicemen:

Lt. Col. Rudolph D. GOBEL, JI., Retired

2671 Merrie Oaks Road

Winter Park, Florida

32789

Larry F. CAISON

1508 Gronin Drive

Hampton, Virginia

At the present time the whereabouts of Sgt. FISCHER

and Capt. STANLEY are unknown.
