Urgent

For WINIEWICZ.

Senators [sic] HUMPHREY and ROMNEY, members of the committee to build a

hospital in Krakow and both friendly to us, requested BIERNACKI to see whether

it will be possible to name the hospital in Krakow in honor of KENNEDY.

According to BIERNACKI they are trying, in good faith, to have a hospital built

in Wroclaw. I gave Comrade JAROSZEWICZ a note on this subject.
