Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 3

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United

States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 1

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could
