Interview: Robert Genzman and Harold Leap interviewed Dennis Flynn
at his home on June 16, 1978. The interview yielded the following
information.
Flynn worked for the FBI from 1934 to 1946, and for
the Department of State from 1947 to 1967. From 1953 to 1956 he
was Director of Security at the State Department.
Flynn recalls the following procedures for State De-
partment cover for CIA employees. The State Department's Personnel
Office would request clearances from the Security Office. The
Security Office would contact the CIA liaison officer, who would
certify clearance. The Security Office would then grant clearance.
A record of CIA certification of clearance would probably be placed
in the individual's State Department security file.

said that the Security Officer and the head of the Bureau of Intel-
ligence Research generally knew about these cover arrangements.
Flynn stated that at no time from 1959 to 1963 did the

CIA use consular cover. Flynn said that he remembers the CIA
officers who had State Department cover in Moscow during this
period. He is sure that Richard E. Snyder and Jack F. Matlock
were not CIA employees, and he is fairly certain that John A.
McVickar, Joseph Norbury, and Alexis Davison were not CIA em-
ployees.
