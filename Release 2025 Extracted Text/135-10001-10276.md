Dear Mr. Olsen:

I am attaching, in answer to your request,

CIA comments on certain questions raised by

Mr. Paul Hoch.

I am advised that the references to HTLINGUAL

involved material which by our lights was innocuous,

but which we made available to the FBI.

Let us know if there are any details you may

wish to pursue. Our check, meanwhile, continues.

Faithfully yours,

SEGRET SESSITINE,

Memorandum by Paul Hoch Concerning

CIA Activities and the Warren Commission Investigation

MI. Paul Hoch, a long-time critic of the Warren Commission

report, has been associated with Ramparts magazine, NBC news,

and US News and World Report in the past. He has been in touch

with CIA on the Warren Commission investigation since at least

1971. Our files show that Mr. Hoch

was one of 12 people who,

in 1967 or earlier, received a copy of the original unexpurgated

list of all Warren Commission material held by the National

Archives before a new list without CIA titles was prepared by

Archives at our request.

In the introduction to his copyrighted 24 March 1975 memo-

randum (Tab 1), Mi. Hoch

notes that he "concentrates on the

CIA, with emphasis on specific questions relevant to domestic

CIA activities, possible CIA nondisclosure to the Warren Com-

mission, and possible links between

the assassination and CIA,

attempts to kill Fidel Castro." A review of the memorandum

reveals that it contains a number of questions and allegations

concerning CIA. However, it also contains questions and

allegations concerning the FBI, the Department of State, and

various military departments. It appears to be a general

criticism of Warren Commission methods and findings with

particular emphasis on CIA's alleged role in obfuscating what

Mr. Hoch believes to be the true nature of its own activities

leading up to and following the assassination.

We are not competent to comment on Mr. Hoch's questions

or allegations concerning other Government agencies or the

Commission. He has raised a number of points concerning CIA

that we address below. Before doing so, however, a few words

are in order concerning the set of mind with which Mr. Hoch

seems to have approached this matter.

On page 11 of his memorandum, Mr. Hoch quotes Mr. James

Angleton as having made the following remark to Mr. Seymour

Hersh when asked by the latter about alleged CIA wrong-doing

and domestic activities: "A mansion has many rooms and there

were many things going on during the period of the lanti-warl

bombings. I'm not privy to who

struck John." Mr. Hoch then

expresses puzzlement over this latter statement. He notes that

"who struck John" may be a literary allusion or cliche unfamiliar

to him and goes on to say:

It may have been

a reference to some other John-- :

e.g•, Mitchell. Also, it is conceivable that "Who

struck John" was some sort of code name for the CIA

study of the Kennedy assassination. Angleton should be

asked to explain that statement, and whether he is aware

of any CIA investigations of Oswald or the assassination,

particularly any which may have reached conclusions dif-

ferent from the Warren Commission's. Regardless of what

Angleton now says he meant by his comment, an intended

reference to

John Kennedy seems as likely as any other

explanation.

Mr. Hoch's willingness to attribute sinister implications to

such a common phrase is both humorous and revealing. It

belies the impression

of reasonably objective scholarship he

has sought to project in his memorandum.

The following questions are paraphrases of points con-

cerning CIA raised by Mr. Hoch. They are keyed to the page on

which the substance with which they deal appears in his memo-

randum.

QUESTIONS

P. 2

Did CIA intercept a letter and money order which Oswald's

mother sent to him shortly after he defected to Russia?

Answer:

No. CIA did not intercept a letter and money order

sent to

Oswald by his mother shortly

• after his defection.

Mr. Hoch's

question probably refers to a matter taken up by Mrs.

Marguerite Oswald with the FBI on 28 April 1960 and described

In the 12 May 1960 report by the Dallas FBI office in Tab 2.

P. 3

What dissemination in CIA was made of the FBI report "Fair Play

for Cuba Committee--New Orleans Division" which dealt only with

Oswald and "A. J. Hidell," Oswald's alias? Other than this

report, were any CIA employees or informants aware of Oswald's

activities in New Orleans?

Answer:

A copy of this report is attached at Tab 3. It was transmitted

to CIA by the FBI under a cover note dated 8 November 1963. The

date stamp on the reverse of the cover sheet indicates it was

logged in to the Agency on 12 November 1963. The DDP Counter-

intelligence Staff liaison office received it on 15 November

1963. The report then went to the counterintelligence office

of the DDP Special Activities Staff which was then concerned with

Cuban matters (no date indicated). The registry for the Special

Activities Staff counterintelligence office handled the report

on 21 November 1963. On 22 November 1963, the report was

received by the DDP Counterintelligence Staff special investí-

gations office, presumably because it concerned a former defector

to the Soviet Union. Apparently it was being processed by that

office when President Kennedy was assassinated..

Prior to the

assassination, CIA had no information concerning Oswald's

activities in New Orleans beyond this report.

544 Camp Street: Is there a CIA connection with Guy Banister?

With David Ferrie? With other associates of Banister?

Answer:

According to CIA records, during 1960 Guy Banister operated a

private detective agency in New Orleans called Banister and

Associates. CIA considered contacting him for use as a foreign

intelligence source and for possible use of his firm for cover

purposes.

However,

security investigation revealed derogatory

information about his professional conduct, and he was not

contacted. With regard to Mr. Ferrie, Agency files indicate that

CIA never considered contacting him for any purpose at any time.

Our record search to date has

not revealed any contacts with

other associates of Guy Banister.

P. 5 and footnote #12

Was Oswald ever a CIA informant? Was he debriefed by CIA in

MOScOw?

on his return from the USSR? If not, any particular

reason? Did CIA ever receive in whole or in part Oswald's

manuscript about his life in Russia? Is #110669 an identifying

number used by CIA in any way?

Answer:

Lee Harvey Oswald was

never associated or connected, directly

or indirectly, in any way whatsoever with CIA (see Tab 4 for

testimony of John A. McCone

and Richard Helms before Warren Com-

mission and Affidavit of John A. McCone). As a former marine

and as a returned defector, he was of primary interest to

military authorities and to the

FBI who were responsible for any

debriefings of him upon his return from the USSR.

CIA received

copies of Oswald's manuscript from the FBI and the Warren Com-.

mission in the material disseminated by them after the

assassination. The number 110669 is not a CIA identification

number of Lee Harvey Oswald for any purpose including registration

as a source. Within CIA records, the number 110669 identifies

an individual of Austrian birth who was of intelligence interest

in East Asia during the 1940's. The Inter-Agency Source

Mexican photo

Answer:

We have had previous communications with Mr. Hoch concerning

this matter (see Tab 5).

The Agency at no time in its dealings with the FBI in the

Field or with the Warren Commission

in Headquarters described

or suggested that the unknown individual whose photograph was

taken in Mexico City on l October was Lee Harvey OSWALD. Our

total coverage of the unknown individual numbers twelve photo-

graphs taken on 1 October (USSR Embassy), 4 October (USSR

Embassy) and 15 October (Cuban Embassy). OSWALD left Mexico

City, it is known, at 0830 hours, 2 October. It is clear,

therefore, that this individual could not be OSWALD. MI.

Helms, in a memorandum to the Warren Commission Chief Counsel,.

indicated very clearly that the photograph of this unknown

individual had nothing to do with the OSWALD case. In the

light of all of the facts in the file, we find no reason to

modify this judgment.

Mexican intercept operations: Did CIA have recordings of calls

between Cuban and Soviet Embassies in which Oswald is discussed

or in which Oswald participated? Did we have a recording of

Oswald's conversation with a guard at the Soviet Embassy?

Answer:

CIA has transcripts of such calls, including a conversation

between Oswald and a guard at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico

City, which were made on 27 and 28 September and 1 October

1963. These transcripts were reviewed in their entirety by

the Warren Commission

at CIA Headquarters and in Mexico City

at the Station in April 1964. The recordings were erased

routinely after the transcripts were made. Oswald identified

himself only in the course of the 1 October conversation, and

a summary of that conversation was the first indication of his.

:

presence in Mexico reported by the Station on 8 October 1963

and disseminated by CIA Headquarters on 10 October 1963.

P.

Who had substantial knowledge of matters pertaining to Oswald

in the CIA Station

in Mexico City at the time of Oswald's

visit there?

Was E. Howard Hunt the acting chief of station

in Mexico City at or near that time?

Answer:

The operations which produced the transcripts of the calls con-

nected with Oswald on 27 and 28 September and 1 October 1963

vere quite closely held at the station.. Few people beyond the

chief and his deputy, one or two senior officers, and the

monitor would have been privy to the material.

E. Howard Hunt.

served in Mexico City from December 1950 to June

1951: From November 1960 until his retirement in 1970, he was

assigned to Headquarters. During the period in which Mi. Hunt

was

alleged by Mr. Hoch to have been acting chief of station in

Mexico City--August-September 1963--Mr. Hunt was

assigned to a

DDP desk at Headquarters. See Tab 6

for documents covering Mr.

Hunt'

s activities then. (MI. Hunt made one extended trip to.

Europe during this period, from July 1965 to September 1966.)

Did CIA personnel play any role in building up, disseminating,

then denigrating a report that Oswald had received money to kill

Kennedy from someone at the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City? Was

there a CIA connection with Gilberto Alvarado Ugarte, the source

of the story?

Answer:

As stated in information provided to the Warren Commission by the

Agency, CIA had

no connection with activities or statements by

Gilberto Alvarado Ugarte concerning allegations that Oswald x'

received

money

to kill President Kennedy from someone at the

Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. After Gilberto Alvarado came to

the American Embassy in Mexico City on 26 November 1963 and made

his allegations, his

story was investigated by local CIA and

FBI representatives in liaison with responsible Mexican law

enforcement authorities. The Agency representatives informed the

FBI that Alvarado

was

well known Nicaraguan Communist under-

ground member who was an informant of a Nicaraguan Security

Service officer who was, in turn, a CIA source. On November

30, 1963, Alvarado admitted to Mexican security officials in

writing that his whole story of having seen Lee Oswald receive

money in the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City to assassinate

President Kennedy was false. On the same day, CIA reported to

appropriate U. S. Government authorities that Alvarado stated

his motive in telling his false story was to get the United

P.

Is there any indication that CIA believed Oswald's defection

and return might have been

connected with a mission for

another intelligence organization (e.g., military) and that

this kept CIA away from his case?

Answer:

No. An Inter-Agency Source Registry 1s maintained by GIA) as

a service of common concern. Such a registry was in existence

throughout the 1960's. Its purpose is to preclude accidental

contact or use of an intelligence source of one agency by

another.

Oswald's name never appeared in the registry.

What was the purpose of a CIA-State study concerning defectors

in general in 1960?

Answer:

There was

no formal "study," but there was inter-agency

preoccupation and exchange of information caused by the fact

that there had been 13 U.S. defectors, including Oswald,

between 1958 and 1960. Among the 13, there were five ascertained

Answer:

A search of our files has revealed no CIA knowledge of the

stay in the Soviet Union. At the time of Dr. Davison's

assignment to Moscow, the CIA station chief was not charged

with the function of coordinating the intelligence activities

Was J. Walton Moore connected with CIA? Was he connected

Answer:

Mr. J. Walton Moore was employed by CIA in the Contact Division

office in Dallas during the early 1960's. His only contact

with the Oswald case prior to the assassination is recorded in

his 1 May 1964 memorandum to the Acting Chief, Contact

Division, attached at Tab 8 (a typed version of the document

is also attached because of the poor legibility of the

original). He may have been involved in the Agency's effort to

support the Warren Commission during the Commission's investi-

gations. Mr. Moore has stated that he was never asked by Mr.

de Mohrenschildt for advice concerning Oswald. We find no

indication that there was ever any contact between Oswald

and

MI. Moore.

What actions did CIA take in Dallas or in Washington after

Kennedy was shot or after Oswald was arrested?

Answer:

A special cable channel was established at headquarters to

insure that all

correspondence concerning Oswald would be con-

trolled in a central repository. The resultant correspondence

was subsequently incorporated into the Oswald file which was.

reviewed in full by the Warren Commission. Extensive investi-

gative and analysis work was performed by the Agency in coordi-

nation with other Government agencies and with the Warren Com-

mission.

Following the assassination of President Kennedy, DCI McCone

instructed the Domestic Contact Service (DCS) to send an

officer from its Dallas office to Parkland Hospital to contact

and offer assistance to the FBI and Secret Service. Mr. Linwood,

Davis of that office went immediately to the

hospital where he

identified himself to the FBI and offered his services during

the emergency. To date, our file review shows no indication

that any particular use was made of Mi. Davis at that time.

P. 13

Does CIA have files with references to Oswald or his family

other than CD692?

Answer:

CIA had only one general file on Oswald at the time of the

assassination. That file had been opened as a result of

Oswald's defection to the Soviet Union. At the time of the

assassination the Warren Commission reviewed and received a

copy of that file in its entirety. As the Agency continued

to cooperate with the Commission, the Oswald file grew. It

numbers 58 volumes now and contains all information in

possession of the Agency on Oswald or his family.

The

single exception to the above statement concerns one

HTLINGUAL document dated 8 July 1961 but discovered only on

review triggered by press publicity following the Oswalds'

return to the U.S. in June 1962. The sensitivity of this

intelligence precluded its inclusion in the Oswald file in

general circulation. However, a copy of the document was

forwarded to the FBI immediately upon discovery. (Also

memorandum. )

Has CIA pursued independent investigations of the assassination

and developed any new information not already provided to the

Warren Commission, the Justice Department, or other responsible

authority? For example, what use did the Agency make of the

Zapruder film?

Answer:

As noted by Mr. Helms in the course of his testimony before the

Warren Commission (see Tab 4, pP 123-124), the case of Lee Harvey

Oswald and the assassination of President Kennedy is not closed

and "will never

be closed" as far as the Agency is concerned.

CIA has continued to be

alert for new information abroad concerning

this matter, and the Oswald file has grown over the years. The

follow-up in Mexico City was particularly active during the

1960's. Throughout this period, no credible information has been

developed which would substantially change the conclusions of

the Warren Commission report. Any substantive information developed

independently by the Agency has been shared with appropriate

authorities, in particular the FBI.

A copy of the Zapruder film was acquired by CIA from Iime, Inc.,

at the request of the Office of Training in February 1965. The

agreement with Time, Inc., specified "...this film will not...

be exhibited or published in any fasion except for internal

training..." The Agency has adhered to these restrictions on

the use of the film. From 1965 to 1969, the film was viewed by

some officials in the Office of Training. Since April 1969, the

Did CIA have a connection with any member of the odio family,

Including knowledge of an abortive plot to kill Castro which

resulted in the imprisonment of Sylvia Odio's parents? Does

CIA have any knowledge of the identities and activities of

three men who reportedly visited Sylvia odio two months prior

to the assassination of President Kennedy, particularly the

man introduced to her as Leon Oswald?

Answer:

The only relationship between CIA and the Odio family was the

debriefing of Cesar Humberto Odio del Ioro, Sylvia Odio's

brother, during the early 1960's on a routine basis as part of

-

a general program of eliciting positive intelligence from Cuban

refugees in the United States. There is no connection or

relationship between the Agency and the imprisonment of

Sylvia Odio's parents

for involvement

in anti-Castro activities.

According to our records, Sylvia Odio's parents were not

imprisoned because of involvement in an assassination attempt

against Castro. The following background information concerning

the circumstances surrounding their imprisonment was provided

by Cesar

del Toro. The parents of Cesar and Sylvia were arrested

by the Cuban Government in 1961 and sentenced to thirty years

and nine years in prison

respectively. They were imprisoned for

participation in an organization named the Movimiento

Revolucionario del Pueblo. Amador Odio Padron had been obtaining

food

and medical

provisions for the

care of Cubans in asylum at

various foreign embassies in Havana. His wife had been

helping him in that activity. Prior to his arrest Amador Odio

Padron

had been the owner of Cuba's largest inter-provincial

trailer truck concern. (In fact, our records indicate that

he had used his trucking concern to smuggle arms to anti-

Battista forces during the 1954-56 period.) During the mid-

1960's, Cesar Odio made several attempts to secure the release

of his parents by offering to purchase large quantities of

spare parts and transport them to Cuba.

The identities of the three men who reportedly visited Sylvia

Odio two months prior to the assassination of President Kennedy

were established in the course of the Warren Commission

investigation.
