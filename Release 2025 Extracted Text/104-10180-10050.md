1.

On 14 December 1970, the undersigned visited WUSHARP

at the latter's request.and had the following discussion.

WUSHARP asked whether me could use wiSLAß/l as a means of

cont acting Cuban officials for the purpose of establishing

Ities

which could later be exploited by HUSHIRP assets.

I explained to YUSHARP that WUSLAB/l had been instructed.

to adopt a passive role. in relationship to his Cuban

contacts, and to respond only to contact initiated by the

Cubans..

NESHARP stated that they understand our point of view

thoroughly.

...2.

At this meeting I briefed HUSIARP on the telephone

call from

a DGI representative cited in reference.

I told

WUSHARP that I would give them a memorandum on this as

well

as a copy of the PO on Rogelio Rodriguez Lopez. (201-332665)

in which they expressed definite interest.

As stated; this is' subjcctive reasoning on

Trousse's past:

Replacement Personnel:

With VIERA and PINERO leaving Soon,

there is talk in Invana about assigning one Teofilo ACOSTA here as

a replacement for one of the other:

ACOSTA is a negro in his early

Tanzania

ACOSTA has been protected by Manuel

types. who know

Source described ACOSTA as a sly and suspicious

person who would not hesitate to report on anyone,

including his

friends and neighbors. ACOSTA is believed to have been deeply in-

PORTELA, the Prensa

Latina chief in: New York, but it was finally

decided

to leave PORTEL here as there were advantages to his being

Source also mentioned that one

"AGEO" (a war name; real name not

was under consideration for assignment here.

said that "AGEO". was a member of the Cuban Delegation to the

UN General Assembly in 1967 (date possibly not coricct).

was in charge of the purge within MINREX in 1967 which resulted in

the ouster

of some 300 persons regarded as homosexuals, counter-

révolutionaries, or incompetents.

lie also is scil-liked and respected

by the siaid of the Dal Conter heid, and he in turn is quick

to single out cach for prisc--with the notable excoption of.

Orlando PENEll! Comader, Dgt officer and Jirst Secretary.

PENDES seldon mentions Party for PillIRA.

and Source concludes that he

does not like or have nuch use

PRENDAS' dislike for both Premanent Represcitative Ricardo

ALARCON quesadn and Mrs. ALANCON is growing daily, and

ALARCON's recall has become a fixation with PreNDS.

-PRENDES is basically nodest, his vanity onerges when discussing

his own professional ability and accomplishients.

Outwardly;

he is anti-American; referring to Amcricans facquently as

"nuestros enenigos"

However, he is enjoying his tour in

New York and obriously admires cortain aspects of U.S. life.

He has a large collection of Ancrican recoids, likes Ancrican

clothcs, etc.

PRENDES' wife, Teresita FERNANDEZ Arango, is scheduled to return

home to Cuba permanently in June 1970.

PRENDES plans to do

same in December

aftor the next UN Goncral Asschbly cnds.

His two yoar tour will be up in Septenber 1970.

FERNANDEZ is popular with the CMUN personnel.

Source stated that PRIND:S' father was uneducated (believed

to be a fisherman), and his mother is a directress of a school

in Matanzas.

Source considers PREDES a much more likeable

type than the average Cuban iniclligence officer.

PRENDES iS

interested in the ChUN and its job as a whole,

unlike his

predecessor as Chief of the DGI Conter,

JOrEE HOLANOS Suarez (201-187157), Counsellor -dosignato,

B. Rogglin RODRIGUEZ Lopez (201-332665), First Secretary-

not);

C.'

Cecilia ANDRE Sardain (201-

), Second Secretary-

designate, same ETA status as Rogolio RODRIGUEZ above.

3. VIERA Linares serves as Charge d'Affaires in the absence of

Ambassador ALARCON Quesada. Up to this point, neither the Basc nor LNERGO

have been able to state evidentially as to whether VIERA or JIMENEZ. Escobar

is the sucessor to Chafik Homero SAKER Zenni (left PCS October 1967) as the

DGI Station Chief. We both, however, tend to regard JIMENEZ as carrying the

most weight in terms of operational activity and in terms of effectiveness.

Now,

with the arrival of BOZA Hidalgo-Gato (who reportedly has been the deputy to

Ramon OROZA Naveran, head of U.S, querations for the DGI, per our last

information), it remains to be sech if BOLA figures higher in the local hierarchy

than VIERA or JIMENEZ. With JIMENEZ, VIERA, BOZA, and PRENDES

•Gutierrez, the local DGI station has more ranking talent than has been the norm.

The Cubans do nol necessarily slot their intelligence officers in Mission titles

equivalen: to their true ranks and responsibilities.

Gustavo Adollo PLAZA Peterosen, on the basis of linown information,

scern the likeliest largets for us ay of now. boil the Bise and LNERGO,

however, continue to luok at all of them in this regard.

5. Il will be noted frog the above diat of the 16 CMUN personnel

now. hore, 8 are identified DCI/DSb, 2 are presumed DGl, and 1 (GELABERT)

may be USE or DIER. The percentage of personnel involved with intelligence/

security thus ranges from a minimum of 50% up to 69% of the total CMUN

personnel strength.

6. The number of official Cubans in New York will, of coursc, be

swelled by the arrival of the Cuban Delegation to the 23rd UN Gencral

Assembly this months. We have requested, via DO BASE/NEW YORK 4844;
