MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Review of Personal Papers of MI. Dulles

I reviewed the personal papers of Mr. Dulles covering

the period after his departure from the Agency and while he

was

a member of the Warren Commission. I also reviewed Agency

historical documents relating to Cuba. The review did not

turn up anything of special significance or importance. For

the most part, Mr. Dulles' papers included correspondence

dealing with his book, personal contacts, and social activities.

I have attached copies of all material in his papers that in

any way dealt with the Kennedy assassination of the work of

the Warren Commission. I have also attached relevant

individual items culled from his daily diary.

Annex to Noven I 29, 1963, Diary:

About 5:30 on Friday, November 29, while I was

sitting around the fire after a game of golf at Lloyd

Neck, the telephone rang and I was advised that the

President wanted to speak with me. I went to the phone

and the White House operator said that the President

wanted to speak with me, that he was. on another line;

and would I hold on for a minute. After a short wait

the operator told me that someone had gone into the

room and that she would call me back.

She called me back in five minutes. This gave

me a brief chance to puzzle out what it was the President

wanted to say to me. As it turned out, aided by some

news items

that the President was considering appointing

a high-level commission to look into all the circumstances

of the assassination of the President, I was led to put this

as the first possibility. Soon the call came through. The

President was on the line. I told him how much my thoughts

had been with him in recent days. He thanked me.

Then

a very kind expression of appreciation for what he

thought I had done for the country over the years, he said

he wished me to do a job for him.

I asked him what it was.

He said he was appointing a commission to look into all

the circumstances surrounding the assassination and the later

killing of the man believed responsible for the assassination.

This commission would include the Chief Justice, members of

the House and Senate from both parties, and two men outside

of government, including myself, If I would serve.

I told the President without hesitation that I was

prepared to serve if he felt I could be of service to him

and the nation.

I said that I assumed that he had considered

my recent job and that he did not consider that this service

was in any way an impediment. He said he had carefully

considered it and he felt that, on the contrary, it would

be helpful. I said I assumed that what he had told me was

entirely confidential. He said it was until it was announced

and he did not know the exact hour of that. I said I woula,

of course, maintain the confidence.

Please see enclosed letter from (Jose colon)

Over the phone he told me that he had some infor-

officers to "impeach" President Kennedy, including

an Air Force officer who had been attache in

Crechoslovakia.. I told him that such information

should be brought to the attention of the FBI. Re

promised to do it but whether he will or not, I do

not know.

In that he talked quite sanely but very vaguely.

Memorandum for: The Honorable Lee Rankin

Attached are a few Items of possible interest:

(1) a copy of an article in the January 1964

British "Labour Monthly" by. I believe, R. P. Dutt. I

understand he is the editor of the "Labour Monthly" and a

British Communist. I an seeking further data with regard

to Dutt.. I call your attention particularly to the section

beginning on page 13,entitled "A C.I.A. Job?". I suggest

that you might wish the CIA to send to you directly all

important items of this general nature and also items

bearing on the future Communist propaganda treatment of

the assassination issue with their estimate, preferably

coordinated with the State Department, showing the general

trend of such propaganda, if there is one. It has been

my experience that the cormunist party of the Soviet Union

exercises a good deal, but not complete, control over the

propaganda activities of the various Communist parties

In the free world and often uses these parties or selected

ones to launch various trial balloons in the propaganda

field.

(2) a letter I obtained frau a source I will

Indicate to you orally wiitten by George de Mohrenschildt,

who you may recall appears in the Commission's records as

one of tha men who had contact with, and as I recall, sone

Influence over Oswald. You will recali that the State

Department had interrogated him briefli. I believe, at the

Insistence of the FBI. This letter misat furnish a desirable

basis for some further interrogation as I did not find the

State Department interrogation wholly ratisfactory.

it to the Cormission. It may require no further answer.

Here are one or two additional thoughts

I have.

(a) that we study the use made of post office

boxes in connection with Oswald's activities and crimes

and also ascertain the terms and conditions under which

post office boxes can be rented, and whether there are

uniform regulations or whether it is left more or less

to the whim of local postmasters. Oswald's ability to

hire a post office in a fictitious name and to use it for

the receipt of firearms seems to have facilitated his criminal

activities. Later the Conmission might possibly wish to

make some suggestions on this subject.

(b) I should be glad to see the conclusions of

the recent report outlined a few days ago in The New York

Times giving arguments for the shifting of the Narcotics

Bureau from the Treasury Department.

(c) Do we have an adequate study by the State

Department of their policy, of any legislation affecting

It, with regard to the terms and conditions of the registra-

who has not forfeited his rights as such las an undeniable

right to return to the United States, but I am not clear

whether this is under law or merely established practice.

(d) Do we have any recent study available as

to the extent to which, under the constitution, the rights

of citizens (or residents?) to acquire and retain firearms -

apart from the question of legislation with regard to the

bearing of concealed arms? i

DUIT. Rajani Palme

Dutt was born in 1896 at Cambridge, England.

His father, a doctor in Cambridge, belonged to a prominent.

Bengali family. His mother was Swedish. Was educated

at Perse School in Cambriäge, Balliol Cford. He became

a charter member of the British Communist party in 1920.

Has been the British Comunist party's leading theoretician

since then.

He founded the "Labour Monthly" in 1921 and

has been editor since then. Has taken an active interest

In Indian Communist party affairs and was Secretary-

Chairman of the British Cormunist party for a period in

1939. He also served for a time in the Cormunist party

of Great Britain politburo. His standing with Moscow is

excellent. In 1962 was

afforded an honorary doctorate

of history at Moscow University, where he lectured in

April and May 1962. These lectures were published by

Lawrence and wishart in London 1963 under the title of

"problems of Contemporary History". One part of his

lecture dealt with the cold war.

The main there of this

section was to establish that the responsibility for the

origins of the cold war rested with the west and tha the

West merely continued the policies of the Nazis and the

Fascists.

Dutt's current position has been described as

head of the international department of the Communist

party of Great Britain, an office which he has held since

at least 1956. He is also vice-chairman of the Communist

party of Great Britain and again a member of the political

and national executive committee.

February 26, 1964

Memorandum for

The Honorable Lee Rankin

ExcH

• A. M. Dulles

I read with great interest the papers attached

to the agenda for the Commission's meeting February 24,

1964. In J. Edgar Hoover's letter to you of February 10,

1964, on page 2, last paragraph, there is reference to

MT. Robert Storey's statement to MI. Wade that when he.

Storey, was with the war Crimes Cormission in Germany after

World war II, he ascertained that "the Central Intelligence

Agency had informants that no one knew about, except the

Central Intelligence Agency agent, and that the informant

might have boen an informant".

While this statement is not very clear, I would

point out that the central Intelligence Agency was not

organized until late 1947 under the National Security

Act of that year and that the Agency Mr. Storey is presum

ably referring to, if he did make the statement, must be

the Office of Strategic Services, which was dissolved in

late 1945. Of course, during the period of existence of

the OSS, Lee Harvey Oswald was an infant.

With respect to J. Edgar Hoover's letters to you

Of february 11 and 13, 1964, I suggest that it may be

desirable to try to clear up the confusion as to the existence

of the "law enforcement officer in Dallas" who allegedly

claimed that L. H. Oswald had been contacted by the FBI

to become an informant. As I read the record avaiaable

to

me, there seems to be some conflict in the testimony of

newsmen Puckins and Golden. Very possibly this has arisen

from the three contacts the FBI had with Oswald in June 26,

and August 10 and 16, 1962. I dá not find in the affidavits

any indication of the purpose of either the June 25 or

August 16 visits. The August 10 visit apparently related

to the New Orleans Fair Play for Cuba incident.

Have we

memoranda on these visits to Lee Harvey Oswald?

MEMORANDUM FOR THE HONORABLE LEE RANKIN

FROM

A. W. DULLES

Last evening Attorney General Carr dined

with Jack McCloy and me and had one or two

suggestions:

I. that the Carmission might wish to

Interview (a) Mi. and Mrs. Earl Cabell. They were

in a strategic position in the automobile proces

sion at the time of the assassination. We saw them

brlefly when we visited Dallas. (b) Lewis Nichols,

former president of the Dallas

Bar Association,

who called on Oswald in connection with the question

of his being legally represented. Carr seems to

think that he has some interesting information

that has not been obtained. (c) Elgin Crull, City

Manager of Dallas, who, as such, was in direct over-

all command of the police.

2. Cary also mentioned a black notebook

belonging to Oswald which had two washington

telephone numbers: (a) the Russian Embassy and

(o) a telephone number with no rame but which was

called by the dallas police. The person answering

was apparently a Negro pastor here.

Memorandum for Lee Rankin

FrOm A. W. Dulles

As a result of my weekend reading which I

have returned with comments. I have the following

comments in addition to comments noted on the

material returned.

1.

Where have we dealt with the evidence

as to Oswald's ability to handle

a rifle?

2. Where do you plan to discuss Oswald's

escape pattern or plans; did he have any - if so,

why did he leave $170 at the Paines and start out

with less than $20? If he killed the President to

make a name, gain notoriety, etc., why did he try to

escape at all and then deny the shooting when caught?

I feel we must deal with these difficult issues. I

have some speculations on the subject.

3. If Marina had admitted that she had once

been a member of the Komsomol, would that have changed

the decision regarding her visa? I believe this has

been considered by the State Department. I feel we

should look into this.

4.

A great deal of the description of the

motorcade and the shooting will be unclear unless

we

have a street may and, if possible, a photo taken

from the

sixth floor window. Is this possible?

5. Would it be possible and desirable to

add to Chapter II a description, second by second -

taken from the frames of Zaprudeis photos? This,

if well done, would be a most aramatic method of

describing the action. I don't think we have given

enough use to these photos.

6.

Has there been any follow-up on the letters

to the Militant - mentionea to us by Isaac Don Levine -

that possibly were written by Oswald?

7. Is there any section of the report which

deals with

the protection of the President and vice

President when abroad?

Should we not deal with this

briefly?
