RE :

Lawrence Huber Florer

I responded to Judy Miller's office (3-E-854)

in the Pentagon this date and viewed U.S.A.F. file (Regis-

try #4198089), accompanied by a secretary during my inspec-

tion of the file's contents.

Essentially, the subject's file reveals he enlisted

in the United States Air Force 8-30-62 in Dallas, Texas,

for a period of six years.

He received an honorable dis-

charge 8-29-68 at Hensley

Field, Dallas,

ment as a member of the 136th Air Refueling Group 15211,

Texas. His assign-

Air National Guard, Hensley Field, Dallas, Texas

changed from Basic Airman to Sergeant (Specialty Account-

ing) , but not geographically.

222S

This record goes on to reflect he was born in Dal-

las, Texas, 7-25-40, lived with his mother, Gladys H. Florer

at 3609 Potomac, Dallas (father deceased), attended local

schools ultimately graduating from N.T.S.U. (Denton, twenty

with a B.B.A. in accounting in 1962.

Aside from

basic training, he received no special

education while assigned to "Air Rflg Go (TAC), Tex

ANG,

USMAS, Dallas, Texas."

His service Serial Number is listed as AF 25988326;

Social

Security #463 62 2151; married Barbara Watson (dob

10-13-44) 8-28-66 in Wichita Falls, Texas, changing their

residence to 3736 Glencoe, Apartment #117, Dallas, Texas

75206 (later moved to Apartment #202).

He was promoted to Airman Third Class 11-24-62 and

to Sergeant 11-4-63.

A check of his attendance record discloses he normally

pursued his military career on weekends.

Example: 11-9-63 (Sat.)

11-10-63 (Sun.)

12-7-63 (Sat.)
