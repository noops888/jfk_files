WERE DATED JUL 75, ONE HAVING BEEN SIGNED BY OLTMANS AND THE

OTHER TWO BY DENI SUKARNO, OLTMANS' LETTER WAS AN EXPRESSION

OF INTEREST IN THE SENATE INVESTIGATIONS AND PARTICULARLY IN ANY

ASPECT REGARDING INDUNESIA, OLTMANS CLAIMED TO HAVE KNOWN SUKARNO

QUITE WELLO AND SAID THAT HE HAD HAD SEVERAL DISCUSSIONS WITH SUKARNO

ON THE SUBJECT OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE CIA AND HOW THE CIA WAS

TRYING TO DUST SUKARNG. DEWI SUKARNO'S TWO LETTERS WERE REQUESTS

FOR INFORMATION ON THE RESULTS UF THE SENATE INVESTIGATION AND

HOPED THAT THE INQUIRIES WOULD SERVE TO CLEAR HER HUSBAND'S NAME.

3. SINCE THE LETTERS WERE ACTUALLY WRITTEN TO SENATOR FRANK

CHURCH AS HEAL UF THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE, LAGUAR FOUND IT

INTERESTING THAT AGEE WOULD BE ABLE TO OBTAIN COPIES OF LETTERS.

WRITTEN TO A UIS, SENATOR IN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY AS HEAD OF SUCH

A COMMITTEE, (JAGUAR) WONDERED IF SOMEONE ON THE SENATE COMMITTEE HAD

SENT THE LETTERS TO AGEE, BUT WE FEEL IT POSSIBLE THAT OLTMANSI

SUKARNO GAVE COPIES OF THEIR LETTERS TO PEOPLE IN PARIS WHO GOT

THEM TO AGEE.

4, REQUEST ADDEES TRACES OLTMANS WITH INDICATION OF WHAT MAY

BE PASSED (AGUAR)
