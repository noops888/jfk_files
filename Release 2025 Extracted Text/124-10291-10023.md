1978 VISIT OF PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER. ALTHOUGH THERE IS

SECRET

A TENDENCY TO BLAME THE UNITED STATES FOR VENEZUELA'S CURRENT

FINANCIAL PROBLEMS, IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT DEMONSTRATIONS WHICH

MIGHT TAKE PLACE WOULD BE AIMED AT PRESIDENI CARTER, BUT

RATHER THEY WOULD BE STAGED DURING THE PRESIDENT'S VISIT

TO EITHER EMBARRASS THE CURRENT VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT OR TO

FURTHER DRAMATIZE THE CAUSE BEING ADVOCATED. (SOURCE : A

STAFF OFFICER OF THIS AGENCY. ›

3. THE VENEZUELAN SECURITY SERVICES RECOGNIZE THIS

SITUATION AND EXPECT THAT THERE WILL

BE UNPLEASANT, ANTI-

VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT INCIDENTS DURING PRESIDENT CARTER'S

CARACAS VISIT. VENEZUELAN AUTHORITIES BELIEVE THESE INCIDENTS

WILL DEAL WITH CHARGES OF HUMAN RIGHIS VIOLATIONS AND GOVERNMENT

CORRUPTION. THE SECURITY FORCES WILL BE ABLE TO CONTROL ANY

SITUATION THAT ARISES, THE AUTHORITIES BELIEVE. (SOURCE:

KNOWN AS THE ANTONIO JOSE DE SCURE GUERRILLA FRONT: THE

ARMED FORCES OF NATIONAL LIBERATION (FALNS, AND THE ORGANIZATION

OF REVOLUTIONARIES (OR). THESE GROUPS HAVE BEEN OPERATING IN

THE EASTERN VENEZUELAN STATES, PARTICULARLY MONAGAS, ANZOATEGUI,

SUCRE AND BOLIVAR. THEY HAVE CARRIED OUT NUMEROUS

RAIDS ON MILITARY POSTS, HAVE TAKEN OVER SMALL TOWNS FOR A LIMITED

PERIOD OF TIME DURING WHICH THEY LECTURED THE TOWNS PEOPLE ON

PUBLICLY CLAIMS TO HAVE CAPTURED SEVERAL GUERRILLA LEADERS
