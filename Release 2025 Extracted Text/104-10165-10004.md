Robin Monre

a.

loore has just returned frow lier lao where he partici

pated in the combat operations of the laerican ipecial forces in liet lar, after

he had gone through about eight months of irainiue al the special forces ichool

at fort Camphell, leniucky.

Forld Keport. which sas published recently, and cop: of mich was left with

baria.

further understandings and irpressions of loore nar te obtaired from

reading his previously published tuol about Jack lourgblood. an erican who

participated iu the erents leading to Castro's o'erthron of battista.

b.

In my opinion. Hoore has a buraing desire to le known

as a tough, tro-fisted, rip roarima soldier of fortune.

He has participated

in real var in Viet las, and has receired shat is probably the best traiuing

in the sorld for guerilla fighters, hanely, tbe t. §. Special Forces.

Tois

includes traiuing as a parachutist. He ig inclired to bray. and is probably

inclined to intetperate use of alcobul and suren. and his judgeuent of in-

portant natters is probably immature. lorerer. he definitely understands

and is experienced iu guerilla figating, is experienced iu nilitary operations,

and cust surely understand military securit.

c.

He is definiteir willing to belp, but cannot contribute

cash directly; is willing to furnish the use of the quest house on his property

for lizired periods of time.

Is tilling to participate aud aid in au operation

to lané people on the scath coasi of luba, cui is noi villiur to comit the ue

of his property ard facilities

as a stagiug area for resuppl; in the future.

d. Is willing to cone to liari, for coufereuces if his

expenses are paid.

2. Site Evaluation

Blue Hole is an excellent bartor; protected against

all weather. and with sir feet of raier at ine har.

heavily wooded. Dock facilities are presently very seager,

rut could be quickli and easily luproved.

at Blue Hole, aud at Fort Autonio fibe closest source) the fuel available

is diesel fuel or autonotive gasoline; no narive white gasoline is available

auwhere is the area. This is a sost significant factor in selecting a

suitable boat.

The nearest source of food aud other supplies is Port

Autonio; Fred liarrett. uanager of the Blue lagoon Club. orders and hauls

supplies fros Port Jutorio constantly, aud could deliver whatever supplies

were desired.

Firears and explosires are not obtainable on the island.

They rould have to be swuggled in illegally.

on five different occagiong.

He is reported to be arailable to per-e as

caplain on a fishing boat, and to train a cret.

b.

The SoS. Frangeline sails every tro reeks frus liani

direct do Port intonio, and could be employed for the delivery of sipplies and

even a loat to Bobiu l'oore.

Fred Barreti, nanager of the bar-restaur .nt. seera to

be a sero capable mau. and for an additioual $10 per reel added to his regular

par. could be quite silling to assist any operation.

d. AUr. Anitony Gason. a retired Britise armi colonel,

is the Jamaica representative for TROJAY boats, at a place called Turtle Couve,

betreen fort Autonio aud Blue cole.

e.

The irmigration chief for Jaraica is a man tr ibe name:

of Georze Eubouls, uto is the forcer chief of police ai Port Antonio: l'oore

clains that they are very close persoual frierds.

d.

Moore

is acquainted vith a can by the name of like Hedges,

uho is a nepher of burle Hedges, the erican uho becar: Caba's actassador to

Chile scue rears ago.

Mike lives in lingsion, and, if be is not a battista

sympathizer. might prove to be

a rery valuable connection.

The fazily is re-

ported io be quite wealthy, and sould establish an excellent cover.

4. Operational Considerations

In order to aroid the use of significant nazes. I

"ustrucied Moore to refer to l'auolo as George Hing, and the operatias of

landing hin in Cuba would be referred to as Operatiounius.

Ibe cost likely

achene seems to be to establish a suitable bout il biue liole. Jii ¿be cover

story to be that it telongs to Lerican friends of Robin Moore.

Housty is

arailable locally for a limited cuuber of Cutans, viia loore being able to

accomodate up to sir on his or property.

The local boat captain, leorge

Munroe. could be employed

as captaiu initially. to. train the Cuban crew in

the local parine conditions, as rell as serviud as aù effectite corer.

In

uy opinion, it vill sot be too difficult for persons to enter Jamaica vithout

difficulty, provided they knor a certain minimum amount of English.

I thin' a suitable location could le found for radio

transmission and reception facilities on the bills surrounding Blue tols, but

this would have to be examined by soreone akilled in radio techniques.

Mateo

rould be excellent.

In sumary, I would say that Robin loore aud his property and!

buildings at Blue Hole

would serre as an excellent tage of operations. but tiat

the boar necessary for the operation muld base to be acquired and equipped

in the staces and shipped doma

tiere, except for the remote pussibility thati

a suitable boat could be found in linston.

•I think a headquarters could be,

established at suall cost through 'ore's good offices, and I thind that Ruds

rould be a good choice to coordinate the initial operations there.
