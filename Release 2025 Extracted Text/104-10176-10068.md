SUBJECT, Meeting with Rolando Masferr

DOC. MICRO. SER

SE MAR 27 191Z

I. In accordance with our conversation, I am sending you the

facts as I know them regarding the T August meeting in New York City

between Rolando MasferIer and Averell Clark:

2. Apparently Masferrer knows Stanley Ross, the Editor of El

Tempo, a spanish-language sewspaper published in New York. The

office is at 78 Fifth Avenue and the telephone number is WA. 4-2750.

Possibly Masferter did not previously know Ross. But at any sate, either

on his own os through someone else, he got in touch with him in late July

an agues and aid that be wanted to bedo not touch ith an american

Ross at the moment except that he has had considerable Latis American

experience and would be a logical person for any Latino to approach. It

would be very easy to obtain additivnal evidence on him if desired.

3. I am attaching for your information a list of the stockholders

In El Tiempo, Inc. to provide some indication of who is bebind RoBs. In

addition, we bare a list of all the senior officers of El Tiempo.

4. Ross knew of Clark through the Hitchcocks listed, as you will

note, as stockbolders. MIs. Margaret Hitchcock 1s Clark's aunt, while

Thomas Hitchcock Ill is his first cousin as presumaily, is illiam

Hitchcock. During the war Clark was an outstanding fighter pilot, having

flows with the RAf through the roughert days of the Battle of Britain, and

iberefter shifted to the Americans with whom be flew many missions as

2'P-4T pilot. He is still in the Air Force Reserve.

B. A¿ RoBo's request Clark met Marlerzer al the El Tiempe Office

In New York City on 1 August. Ross left the room no that the session was

him 15 jail 15 Flosida for Violation of the provisions of the Nextrality Act.

6. Masferrer alleged to Clark that he was representing some twenty

Cuban exile organizations, and that he was working with a Haitian, Charles

Forben, head of an anti-Duvalier organization known as "Capois La Mort."

Forben allegedly asked Masferrer to help his organization by leasing or

buying a PBY-5 aircraft for use against Duvalier. Masferrer claimed that

Forben's group was in a position to take control of the lle de la Gonave:.

an island just off the west coast of Haiti in the gulf north of Port au Prince.

It is conceivable that this is the wrong island since Clark did not have the

name of the island in question, but based on the description of its location

by Masferrer, I am assuming this to be the island involved.. At any sate,

in settirn for help from Masferrer, Forben was to be asked to let Masferrer

and some of his Cuban exiles use the island in question as a base from which

to harrass the eastern end of the Island of Cuba.

7. Clark told Manferrer that as a member of the Air Force Reserve,

he would have to report the conversation to the USG and could not do any.

thing without cleating with the USG. Masferrer said that he had no objection

to this, particularly with regard to the activities of Forben and his group,

but he asked that Clark not mention hir intention to harrass Cuba, since he

maintained that the USG would forbid this as being againat USG policy. Clark

Bald that Masferrer would have to leave to him what matters he chose to

discuss with the USG. It was then agreed that Clark could reach Masferrer

through Ross's office for about a week, and thereafter could pass a message

to him through Ross.

8. Clark got in touch with me because I had known him during the

war; I had known his family for many years, and one of his closest friendo,

James B. Watries, is a cousin of mine and was, until about s. jear ago,

associated with the Agency, Incidentally, I believe that Clark has had some

discussions with SOD with the idea of possibly being used in connection with

Special opesations.
