BELGIAN FOREIGN MINISTER EVALUATES PRESIDENT JOHNSON

FR Brussels: SPAAK

TO Washington: Belgian Embassy

Msg Nr: 275

23 Nov 63

Reference my telegram Nr. 274((A)). I also answered the

following question:

Question: Mr. Minister, might I also ask you a question?

You have met Mr. LYNDON JOHNSON several times. May we ask you,

on the basis of the conversations which you had with him in

Brussels, what your impressions of the new President of the

United States are?

Answer:

Well. It is true that I had the good fortune to

have talks with the new President of the United States, scarcely

two weeks ago, and these talks inspired my confidence.

I had

the feeling that the Vice President completely shared President

KENNEDY's political ideas. I believe that he is a very ex-

perienced man and that there is no reason to doubt his wish to

follow President KENNEDY's policy. Therefore it is necessary

to have confidence and to work with him with the same desire for

co-operation as that which we showed to President KENNEDY.

((A)) Available if required. The Foreign Ministry transmits to

Embassy Washington the text of Mr. SPAAK's statement by

radio on 23 November on the death of President KENNEDY. J
