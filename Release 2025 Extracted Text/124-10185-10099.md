SUBJECT: Request for Information on Sensitive Activities

-You will recall that in Fiscal Years 1971 and 1972,

I believe, Agency funds were

made available to the FBI.

These funds may still be possibly held in a special

account for that use. This is one of the areas where

TSD has been very much involved. Chuck Briggs would

have the details as this was handled through the Executive.

MEMORANDUM FOR :

Deputy Director for Operations

SUBJECT

Areas of Possible Embarrassment

to the Agency

1. Sometime in the spring or carly summer of 1971, Mr. John

Dean levied the requirement on the Agency for information relating to

the Investors Overseas Service (IOS). The original request yas

non-spocific but it gradually emerged that Dean was concerned with

the possible adverse publicity that might develop regarding the

President's nephew, who was employed by IOs.

2. There were multiple channels from the White Housc to the

Agency on this subject:

a. Presumably laldeman and/or Ehrlichman to Director

Helms.

b. Someone (unnamed) in the While House to the DDCI,

General Cushman (sce attached telephone conversation).

Note that Ehrlichman is mentioned, and

C.

John Dean to the CI Staff. These various channels

were sorted out in time and six reports were passed by

the C] Staff to ir. Fred Fielding for Mr. John Dean.

3. The telephone call of General Cushman's is of interest since

' it gives the flavor of White House concern.

It took several days to

uncover the fact that the White House interest centered on the involve-

ment of the President's nephew with IOS and possible adverse publicity.

The reports submitted to Dean's office were routine in nature and were

coordinated with the DCI. After a few months, interest in this sub-,

ject died down and we did not pursue it further.

4. Please return the attachments when they have served your

purpose.

5. I also include a short note on the Intelligence Evaluation JFK (•)(B)

Committee and Staff propared by[Richard Ober.] The original

meetings were held in the office of John Dean at the White House

and the principal sparkplug for this group activity ira's the then

Assistant Attorney General for Internal Security, Robert Mardian

and then later his assistant, William Olsen. It is noted that Mr.

Mardian is now appearing before the Grand Jury and'it is always

possible that he might draw in the Agency. •

JFK(1)(B)

6. Before appointing LOber to the IES Stalf as the Agency

representative, I had allended various inter-agency mectings pre-

sided over by Mardian. I expressed the view to. Director Helms

that Mardian would require very careful handling due to his inex-

perience.

Furthermore, Mardian was deeply involved in the split

between Bill Sullivan and Mr. Hoover. On a confidential basis

one or two senior FBI officials stated that Sullivan was secretly

passing files to Mardian without Mr. Hoover's permission. This

was one of the important reasons why Sullivan was dismissed from

the Bureau.

SUBJECT: The MHCHAOS Program

1. The MCHAOS program is a worldwide program for

clandestine collection abroad of information on foreign

efforts to support/encourage/exploit/manipulate domestic

U.S. extremism, especially by Cuba, Communist China,

North Vietnam, the Soviet Union, North Korea and the

Arab fedayeen.

2. -The MHCHAOS program has not and is not conduct:

ing efforts domestically for internal domestic collection

purposes. Agency efforts are foreign. Foreign oriented

activity in the United States has boen of two types:

Selected FBI domostic sources who travel

abroad in connection with their extremist activity

and/or affiliations to make contact with hostile

foreign powers or with forcign extremist groups

have been briciou and debriefed by Hcadquarters

officers.

The bricfing has included appropriate

operational guidance,

including defensive advice.

b.

Americans with existing

extremist creden-

tials

have been assessed, recruited, tested and

aispatched abroad for PCs

assignnchts as contract

agents, primarily sources offered for such use by

the FEI.

ithen abroad they collect information re-

sponsive to Michaos program requirenents, as well

as other Agency requircments.

They are thus used

primarily for targeting against Cubans, Chinese Con-

munists, the North Vietnamese, otc., as their back-

ground

and their particular access pernits.

should be noted that the MPTROIkI aspect of the

MPLODESTAR projoct of the East Asia Division is

similar to the MICHAOS PROGRAM.

3. As indicated

earlier, Michaos is a foreign pro-

gram,

conducted overseas, except for the limited activity

described above.

The program. is and has been managed so

as to achieve the maximum feasible utilization of exist-

ing resources of the Operations Directorate.

CORPORATE COVER

1.

Central Cover Staff (CCS) is responsible for the

placement of Agency operational personnel under the cover

of bona fide U.S. companies abroad and in the U.s.

This

process

involves

the sclection of companies; research on

their locations and key personucl; clearances; contacts

with companies to solicit coupcration with the Agency;:

arrangements for integration of Agency personnel into the

companics, including letters of understanding; funding of

salaries, allowances and expenses; and, continuous monitor

ing of each integrated case throughout

the course of the

cover use.

The ovciall objoctive is to match the individial

being placed, the company, and the location, in a manner

that will ensure achieverent of the Agoncy purpose and pro-:

tection of the company integrity.

2. Currently, there are 191 integrees for whom cover

is provided by 110 companies; 179 integices are located in

17 forcign countrics and 12 are located in the

United States.

To maintain this placement lovel, ces personnel mc' ic-

searching and monitoring approximately 250 to 300 companies

at any given time.

3. To minimizo the adverse consequences to a coopcrating

company, and to preserve the Agency's operational equits in

the event of exposure of an individual

under cover, it has

been established policy that no more than two individuals

would be turnished cover by the same company. At the prescht

time this ratio is confined to approximately 25% of the total

number of companies now being used and efforts are under

way to effect fuither reductions toward the goal of one

individual per company.

4.

In addition to the primary corporate cover function

contact with two Us

caid firms for the purpose of obtaining backstopped credit

cards in alias for operational use in the United States and

abroad by Agency personnel. 12 such cards are now being

used by 31 individuals.

ROJECT NOCKINGBIRD

Project Mockingbirds a telephone intercept activity, was conducted

between 12 March 1963 and 15 June 1963, and targeted two Washington-

based newsmen who, at the time, had been publishing news articles

based on, and frequently quoting, classified materials of this Agency

and others, including Top Secret and Special Intelligence.

Telephone intercept connections were installed at the newmen's

office and at each of their homes, for a total of 3. The connections

were established with the assistance of a telephone company official

who responded to a personal request by the Director of Security, Col.

Sheffield Edwards. Col. Edwards' authority for the activity was Mr.

John A: McCone, Director of Central Intelligence..

The latter conducted

the activity in coordination with the Atturney General (Mr. Robert Kennedy),

the Secretary of Defense (Mr. Robert Mc.V'amara), and the Director of

the Defense Intelligence Agency (Gen. Joseph Carroll). In addition to

Office of Security, personnel directly involved in the intercepts and

research of materials acquired therefrom, only 3 other Agency

officials äre on record as witting of the activity: the Deputy Director

of Central Intelligence (General MarshallS. Carter), the Inspector

General (Lyman Kirkpatrick) and the General Counsel. (Mr. Lawrence

-Houston).

The intercept activity was particularly productive in identifying con-

tacts of the newsmen, their method of operation and many of their sources

of information. For example, it was determined that during the period they

received data from 13 newsmen, 12 of whom were identified; 12 senators

and 6 members of Congress, all identified; 21 Congressional staff members,

of whom Il were identified; l6 government employees, including a staff

member of the White House, members of the Vice President's office, an

Assistant Attorney General, and other well-placed individuals. A number

of other sources were partially or tentatively identified, but the short span

of the activity precluded positive identification, It was observed that through

these contacts the newsmen actually received more classified and official

data than they could use, and passed some of the stories to other newsmen

for release, establishing that many "leaks" appearing under other by-lines

were actually from the sources of the target newsmen.

it which were retained, have been maintained under strict security access

In addition to

the

physical surveillance, an observation post was main-

Anderson's office.

The purpose of this surveillance

was to attempt to determine Anderson's sources

At the direction of the DCl, a surveillance was

conducted on Victor L. Marchetti

from 23 March to

to determine his activities and contacts both with

Agency employees

and other individuals in regard to

his proposed book and published magazine articles ex-

POLICE SUPPORT

A. During 1969, 1970, and 1971, on several occasions,

the Intelligence Division of the Metropotitan Police

Department was provided a communications system to

monitor major anti-Vietnam war demonstrations in the

Hashington area.

This system consisted of a radio

receiver and an Agent at the Intelligence Diyision

Headquarters and several automobiles from an Agency

Field Office equipped with radio receivers and trans-

mitters and manned bytwo Agency employees, as well asia

representative of the Intelligence Division, Metropolitan

Police Department.

The benefit to the Agency was that

the communications over this system were monitored at

the Headquarters Building to provide instant notice of

possible actions by the dissidents against Agency in-

stallations.

SRPOINTER-

Since 1953, this office has operated a mail inter-

and, at various times, other selective mail at kennedy

Airport in New York City. This operation included not

only the photographing of envelopes but also surrepti-

tious opening and photographing of selected items of

mail.

The bulk of the take involved matters of inter-

nal security interest which was disseminated to the

Federal Bureau of Investigation.

This program is now

in a dormant state pending a decision as to whether

the operation will be continued or abolished.

B. AELADLE

For several years the Office of Security has pro-

D. BUREAU OF NARCOTICS AND DANGEROUS DRUGS

In January 1971, the Director approved a request

from the Director, Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous

Drugs, to provide covert recruitment and securit)

clearance support to BNDD. This has been

showsh the nedium of a proprietary of the officE of

operating in

Falls Church, Virginia.

Support

includes covert recruitment,

investigation, polygraph,

medical clearance, and training. It has been divided

into three phases: (1) A CI operation to place indi-

viduals in BNDD field offices to monitor any illegal

activities of other BNDD employees; (2) Recruitment

of Chinese or Spanish speaking covert Agents; and (3)

Recruitment of an individual used as an Agent by BNDD

but actually employed by BNdb,

although this fact is

known only to the Director and Chief Inspector, BNDD.

In this case, arrangements were made for all pay and

other employee benefits to come fromiCion a reim-

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECI: General: Office of Security Survey

1. At the Director's instruction, and with the concurrence

of the then DD/P, the Office of Security developed informants in

•RID to report on the activities of RID employees on whom security

questions had arisen. This program, which included upwards of a

dozen informants at its peak, has declined to its present level of

three, only one of whom is reporting regularly on matters of current

interest.

2. The principal object of Security's interest through this

informant is

a female who was employed in RID for a number of years

until she resigned in 1969. Her resignation coincided with the initiation

of a security review on her by the Office of Security, but Security does

not know whether the employee was aware of this security review at

the time of her resignation.

3. Security's interest in this employee was occasioned by

reports that she had developed an increasingly intimate acquaintance

with a Cuban national. Reporting by one informant, who was also

being developed by the Cuban, suggested that the Cuban might have

an intelligence interest in the female. The same informant also sub-

sequently reported that the Cuban had numerous other contacts among

clerical and secretarial employees of the Agency. Among these

employees is one girl who works in a biographic section in SB Division.

4. Subsequent to her departure from the Agency, the ex-RID

employee entered into a common-law marital relationship with the

Cuban and joined him as partner in a photographic business. In this

capacity she solicited business among CIA employees, especially

those requiring passport photos. Recently, she and the Cuban sought

to employ Security's informant in this business on a part-time basis.

00053

INIPSET CL BY-

Latini

## Page 23

5. Information on the background of the Cuban is fairly estensive,

but it is inconclusive.

He is known to have been a momber of anti-

Castro organizations

this country. There are al

reports that

his mother was imprisoned in Cuba at one time. Tiere are other .

episodes in his life that suggest intelligence involvement on his part

with some hostile service, but this is not yet definitely established.

6. The Office of Security has had at times a second informant

in this case. His reporting has tended to confirm reporting by the

principal informant.

7. There is conclusive evidence that the Cuban expressed

interest in certain 201 files in the Agency, and there are good groundso

for believing that the RID female employee delivered at least one such

•file to the Cuban while she was still in RID. There is also evidence

that the female employee in SB Division has continued in frequent

contact with her friend,. the ex-RID employee, and the Cuban. On

one occasion, she served as intermediary for contact instructions

from the Cuban to O/S's principal informant. The informant has no

knowledge, however, of any other requirements that may have been

levicd on or satisfied by the SB employee. Neither does he know of

the extent of contacts by this couple with other Agency employees

except social contacts.

8. The Office of Security has been running this operation for

over two years, in an effort to obtain conclusive proof of its intelli-.

gence nature.

Cl Staff has been kept informed. The FBI, which

was informed of the case at an early stage, has declined to take re-

sponsibility for it, on grounds that it concerns CIA's internal security.

As a result, the Office ofSecurity has been inhibited in the actions

it can take against the Cuban suspect. On the other hand, Security

has not taken any action against Agency employees for fear of com-

promising the operation. ]

9. It would appear to me that the Office of Security has dallied

with this case long enough. Apparently unable through positive measures

to resolve doubts about the case. O/S has followed the course of watch-

ful waiting, hoping the Cuban would take precipitant action himself that

would give us the evidence we seek. In the meantime, our knowledge

of the relationship between the Cuban and the several other current

Agency employees with whom he is known to have contact continues

-2.

00063

## Page 24

to be quite limited. Neither the Cuban nor his girlfriend have made

any further approaches to Security's informant recently, although ic

• continues to see then

ocially. Thus, there is slir

reason to believe

that further waiting will produce a break in the case.

10. There are two courses open to the Office of Security now.

It can attempt to have the Agency employees known to be in contact

with the Cuban transferred to nonsensitive positions. This might

alert the Cuban to our penetration of the operation, particularly

since a plausible reason for transier would be difficult to develop

for some of the persons involved. Alternatively, Security could

move overtly and charge the Agency employees with violation of the

security regulation requiring reporting of contacts with foreign

nationals.

This would, of course, terminate the Office of Security's

. operation.

11. One of these courses of action should be chosen promptly.

The possibility, that the employee in SB Division may be passing

information on CLA's Soviet operations is too great to warrant further

delay in moving against her.

Moreover, it is possible that the Cuban

has current productive penetrations of RID. Thus, the risk of damage

to the Agency seems clearly to outiveigh any. possible gains from

continuing this CI effort.

• 1.: This memorandum is for your information only

and confirns a report I made to you by telephone earlier

today.

2. On 22 July 1971, an article was carried on

American proposals rclative

to the SALT talks in The New

York Times over the by-line of Iden 181.

It was

devastatingly accurate and contained direct quotes from

a Presidential advisory memorandum the White House had

sent to Mr. Gerard Smith, Director,

Arms Control and

Disarmament Agency, a

fei

days earlier.

The

President

furious with this unauthorized dis-

closure of classified information and directed a sweeping

investigation within the United States Government to

determine the source of the disclosure. Investigation

was conducted under the direction of Mr. Egil Krogh and

Mr. David Young, Staff Assistants to Mr. John Ehrlichman,

Counsel to the President for Domestic Affairs.

•3.

On the basis of investigations conducted by

state security and Defense officials, four indiviauals--

one individual

in the Department of Defense and three

individuals in the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency--

were tabbed as leading suspects.

Nr. Egil Krogh contacted

me on 26 July 1971 and requested that we arrange to polygraph

the three suspects in the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency

and volunteered the information that the Federal Bureau of

Investigation would be asked to polygraph the one suspect

4. I informed Mr. Krogh that from time to time

in matters involving

the national security the Agency had

detailed to Mr. G. Narvin Gentile, Director of State

Security, a polygraph operator and a polygraph machine for

his use

in polygraphing State Department employees who

were recipients of allegations concerning their lojalty.

I emphasized

that this procedure had the Director's

approval and

State clearly understood that the examin-

ation was their total responsibility.

I further informed

him that this was the only way le could undertake to enter-

tain his request and that even then it would require the

• specific approval of the Director.

Mr. Krogh asked me to

obtain such approval and work out such

arrangements with

Mr. Gentile.

5. Later that same day, Mr. Krogh called Mr. Gentile

and inquired

to whether the arrangements had been made.

Mr. Gentile indicated they had and suggested that the same

polygraph operator be used

to examine the Defense suspect.

Mr. Krogh informed ir. Gentile that he considered this an

excellent idea and that he would instruct Defense officials

to make their man available to Mr. Gentile for a polygraph

examination.

6. The four individuals were Iden 182

of the Department of Defense and Iden 183

Iden 184

• and

Iden 185

• of

the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.

The polygraph

examinations resulted in clearing the four men and the

results of the examinations were forwarded over my signature

memorandum is attached.

Bureau of Investigation, denied this allegation in a

letter to The Hashingtch Post and said that the polygraph

examinations had deon

conüuited by another agency. Specu-

Lation centered around the Agency,

but after a day or so,

press speculation in this regard died away.

8. Iden 186

apparently has never been satisfied

and has been pressing sir. Charles Bray, State Department

spokesman, for confirmation of Agency involvement. Mr.

Bray learned today that Iden 186

plans to use a press

this point further.

Mir. Bray has been given guidance

Mr. Gentile to avoid confirmation but it this is impossible

he will indicate the examinations were conducted by State

Department Security officials utilizing an operator and

a machine detailed to the Department for this purpose.

I

do not knoy whether of not the fact that the government-wide

investigation was directed by MI. Egil Krogh is known to

Iden 186

but I suspect that it is and that this is the

reason why the matter has been raised again. Mr. David

Young was instrumental in pushing my office to conduct an

internal Agency investigation of this disclosure and the

White House was satisfied that no Agency employee was

the source.

buying an apartment building.

There was also

Agency help given in handling the purchase. Further, other

CIA monies in cashiers checks were given to NSA who, with

MI. Ray Rocca of the DDO/CI Staff.

3. The second item: "-- Use of CIA funds to help

of President Lyndon B. Johnson's trip to Southeast Asia."

Mr. Clarke said the total amount. of money requested

by State Department was $3, 000, 000 but that the Director would

not agree to this amount. The Director did supply funds in

Background: Lor many years the lentrat intelligence Agency has

office of the President such as the Council on International

Economic Policy and

the President's Foreign

Intelligence

We have even,

in rare. instances, detailed our

people to Congressional Staffs for short periods of time.

• 3. Details to the White House and Government Agencies -

Discussion:

Details to st, the white House, isy and the

National far College are probably quite deforsible., On the other

hand, there may be those who would question Agency employees

currently workirg at the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs

and Mr. Peter Peterson having an Agency employee as his

secretary when he was the Secretary of Cormerce (she also

made

a trip with him to Moscow). She is still with him in his

present assignment but we expect that she will report to NSC for

a new detail sometime this month. Iden 112

over ten years as Director of the Office of. Public Safety for

AID. This information has been kept "close

to the vest" during

that entire period of time. He has been approved for disability

retirement and is presently on sick leave and will retire

automatically at the expiration of this leave.

Each detail of an Agency employee to the White House of

other Government agency has been carefully considered and

approval at a higher level obtained when professionals were

involved.

4.

Project THOFOLD: I believe the support we are

providing to Project TWOFOLD is an activity that should be.

reported under your guidelines. Since this is an extremely

sensitive Project and the Office of Security is reporting on

it, I will not repeat the details in my memorandum.

5. Individuals Engaged in Domestic Activities: In a more

. general sense,

Contract Personnci Division prepares and

executes

contracts with individuals engaged by the Agency to carry out

domestic activities. We also process Staff agonts who are

domestically assigned. None of these assignments

are decided

in OP.

I really have no way of knowing with any degree of

certainty what the specific duties of these individuals will be.

6. Arrangemerts with American Firms: In the interest of

reporting "too nuch,

" I would remind you that Contract Personnel

Division writes "agreements" with domestically based American

firms to provide cover. for Agency assets. The actual assign-

ments are overseas.

The arrangements, however, are backstopped,

in the main, in the United States.

have assisted us in

obtaining the appropriate State license.

Similarly, a

Federal license has

been obtained for the proprietary

through an arrangement with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,

and Firearms of the Department of the Treasury.

They, too,

nave been briefed on the Agency's association with this

proprietary. .

b.. Under Title 18, Chapte's 2512 of. the U. S. Code

(1968), the sale of electronic intelligence

equipment is

prohibited except to Federal agencies, and state and local

law enforcement agencies.

in essence,

this law makes it

almost impossible to procure electronic intelligence

equipment in a covert manner so that no tie or relationship

to the United States Government is made. In order for the

Agency to covertly obtain such eauipment and hide any

Government interest, the Covert Procurement Staff of the

Procurement Division. has

relied on an established working

relationship with a U.S. firm.

This firm, a prominent

supplier located in.

Maryland, deals in a vide

range of law enforcerent, police supplies, and equipment.

The Covert. Procurenent Staff has. had a relationship withan officer

• in the firm

for over 15 years.

The officer

agreed to

allor us to place orders

through his corporation to major

suppliers of this equipment with a billing to an Agency national

proprietary.There is an understanding that. if any. inquiry

is raised by the

Department of Justice, the firm's officer would

immediately call the Chief of the Covert Procurement Staff

who would, through appropriate liaison channels, contact

the Department of Justice, identify the Agenco's interest

In the procurement action, and clear

responsibility. On 10 September 1972, there was an inquiry

about the proprietary

Iron_an fil agent making a routine

investigation of. the officer's

books.

Through Offica of

Security liaison

the agent was informed that it

with the Department of Justice and the FBI,

is an Agency

and, since that time, there has been no further inquiry.

Most of the DD/O area divisions Irom time to time submi:

requisitions to us to acquire surveillance equioment. Th

majority of the transactions are on behalf of the intelli-

gence service with whom liaison is conducted in various

MEMOR ANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECI: Identity 61

Break In on 15 May 1972

1. On 24 May 1973 I telephoned MI. James Robinson,

General Crime Section, Deparment of Justice and asked if he

had any information as to criminal prosecution of porsons involved

in a break in at Identity 61

• in Washington, D.C. on

15 May 1972.

M?. Robinson stated he had so knowledge of this but

suggested that it would be better to check with Mr. G. Marvin Gentile,

Deputy Assistant Sccretary for Security, Department of State, and

the Sccret Service since they had responsibilities for the Executive

Protective Service (EPS). I telephoaed Mi. Gentile and he identi-

fied two State Department cables relative to the incident; one from

the embassy in Santiago to the Department, No. 2450, dated.

15 May 1972, Subjoct: Unauthorized Entry Outlining the Protest

of the Iden 76 Covernment presented to the American Embassy,

and the Slate Department roply to Santiago, No. 0S1655, dated

15 May 1972. Mir. Gentile also identified the EPS report of

investigation and suggested that I get a copy from the Secret Service.

I then called Mr. Tom Kelly at Secret Service and he had his liaison

man deliver me a copy of the EPS report of investigation.

2. On 25 May 1973 I received a call from FBI Agent

Ray Mullens on green phone No. 5303 stating that he had icceived

a telephone call from Vi. James Robinson relative to my icquiry

about prosecution. Mi. Mullens indicated that the FBI Washington

Ficld Office had recontacted the Vietropolitan Police Department (MPD)

on 24 May and reviewed the report No. 218-424 filed with the 3rd

District, MPD which states that a break in occurred at Identity 61

between 5:00 and 8:00 a.m. on 15 May 1972.

was. no evidence of a crossing of state boundries, the FBI did

not make an investigation of the incident. The MPD reported

that there had been no prosecution and no suspect was identified.

MEMORANDUM FOR:

SUBJECT:

Mr. William E. Colby

Special Activities

1. Following our recent conversation, I have

searched.my memory and M. McConc's files for examples

of activities which to hostilo observers or to sonconc

without conplete knowledge and with a special kind of

motivation could be interpreted as esamples o1 activities

exceeding CIA's charter: JFK/(B)

2. First, as we discussed,

on 7 March 1962,

DCI McCone, under pressure from Attorney General Robert

E. hennedy, agreed to tap the telephones of columnists

scott in an cffort 10 identify

their sources for classified information which was apponi-

ing in their columns.

Because the primary source appeared

to be in the Department of

Defense, acConc ordered ne

personally to brief General Joe Carroll, Director of DIA,

orally, which I did. I understand more complete infornation

on this operation is available from the Director of Securily.

I, personally, managed to avoid gaining any knowledge of

what precise actions were taken, what information was gained,

what was done with it, and when the operation was terminated.

3. As a result of a developing relationship with

IDEN-122

thelJEN-123rcpresentative in Washington,

and

also as a result of certain information convejed by

IDEN-124

, James Angleton, with the approval of

Dick Helms, agreed lo mount a counterespionage operation

against the

IDEN-95

in Washington. This involved

breaking and entering and the removal of documents from

the •

IDEN -126

On 18 June 1962, DCI McCone and

Helms briefed Secretary of State Rusk generally.on

the

operation without going into operational details:

Later

on the same day, Piesident John F. Kennedy was briefed.

Actual breaking and entcring occurred somewhat latei, and

on 15 April 1963, DCI dicCone met with

President Kennedy

alone and

briefed the President on the dotails of this

new phase of the

operation.

On the same day, the Attorney

General was briefed and he agreed that he would not

mention it to the FBI unless

the FBI therselves raised

it with hin.

On 3 February 196%, DCI McCone met alone

with President Lyndon B. Johnson and briefed him on the

opcration. On 1 February McGeorge Bundy was

briefed.

On 6 February 1964 in a briefing of Secrefary of State

Rusk on the results of the operation, Rusk expressed

rescrvations about the propricty of

an operation.

He raised this same concein in subscquent conversations

with icone on 17 April 1961, 28 Nay 1961, and 11 June

1961. On 12 September 1961 Rusk continued to express

grave reservations and repearedly suggested that the

IDEN'-is be indorned diroctly that we knew about their

espionage operations in

the United States and ask them

to desist.

In a meeting on 28 May 1961 Rusk expressed

these reservations in the presence of DeI licCone and

President Join F.. Kennedy.: ,Sccretary of Defense McNamara

waS

also prosent, and there is no record that he had

previously been made avare of this operation.

• 4. Although certain activities never got beyond

the planning stage, there are, I believe, three examples

of. such planning which could be subject to misinterpretation.

One involved chemical varfare opciations against the ricc

•crops in both Cuba and North Vietnam.

A second involved

a paramilitary strike

against the Chi-Com nuclear instal-

lations.

Outside the United States Government, General

Eiscnhower was briefed on such planning.

A third, which

assumes a new significance today, involved a proposal by

Angleton and Helms for a greatly increased intelligence

collection effort against foreign installations in

country.

This planning also involved a scheme for selected

exposure of KGB activities and counteractions against the

Soviet intelligence service.

The reasons are still unclear

•o me as to Jhy the rBl chose to brief the PrIAB to the

effect that CIA was planning to wiretay cxtensively an

indiscriminately in this country, to greatly increase

the Agency representation in the

generally

to use KGB-type tactics, also extenst ean anc

Indiscriminately. This led to a heated exchange betreen

DCI icCone and dir. Belmont of the FBI, one such meeting

taking place in the presence of the Attorney General.

It is clear that the fBI was opposed to any such proposal

then, as now, and the plan never went forward..

5.

During the period when Des FitzGerald was in

charge of the Cuban Task Force, DCI McCone's office

learned, quite by accident, that FitzGerald had secured

the coopcration of several prominent US business firms

in denying economic items to Cuba.

There was no question

but that the businessmen were glad to cooperate, but know-

ledge of this operation had to be rather widespread.

6.

On 17 April 1961, Mr. Robert B. Anderson cane

to DCJ. McCone on

behalf of Amcrican business interests,

offering to insert some $300,000 to try to secure a

favorable result in the clections in Panama.

Shortly

after this approach.

WEN'-128

IDEN'-129

mado a sinilar proposal to icCone in connection

with clections in Chile.

On 12 May 1964 at a meeting of

the 303 Comnittoc, it was decided that the offers of

American business could not be accepted. it being neither

a secure way not an honorable way of doing such business.

This declaration of policy at this time bears on the recent

forgoiten that he helped to set the precedent of refusing

to accept such collaboration between the Agency's operations

and private business.

At the direction of Attorney General Robert

Kennedy and with the explicit approval of President kennedy,

McCone injected the Agency, and particularly

Foreign Su

It for Activities Plann

to Disrupt

or Harass

the Republican National Convention

SUNMARY:

There is little new evidence of foreign plans or efforts

to inspire, support, or take advantage of actions designed to

disrupt or harass the Republican National Convention in San

Diego, 21 to 23. August 1972. The Students for a Democratic

Society, in joining the ranks of domestic groups planning

Republican Convention, has adopted a proposal

to cooperate with mexican workers and students in a demonsira-

during the Convention.

The San Diego

convention Coalition (SDCC), another domestic group targetting

on the Convention, has received a letter of solidarity from

the North Victnamese...The letter is of interest as an indica-

tion of North Vietnamese contact with the SDCC; such contact

will be required

for the SDCC to implement its carlicr-reported

plans for broadcasts over public address systems during the

•Convention of live telephone calls from the Vietnamese in

Paris.

DEVELOPMENTS:

At its recent convention in Cambridge, Massachusetts,

held 30 March to 2 April 1972, the Students for a Democratic

Society (SDS) adopted a proposal

to hold demonstrations at

the San Diogo-Tijuana border during the Republican

National

Convention. The proposal included a call for SDS to cooperate

with Mexican workers

and students in an action to occur during

a fiesta in Tijuana, where Convention delegates will be

entertained.

The North Vietnanese have given their endorsement to

the San Diego Convention Coalition (SDCC) in the form of a

Jetter from the Vietnam Committce for Solidarity with the

•American People (VCSWAP), a quasi-official organ of the

North Vietnanese Government.

The letter, which has been

circulated by the SDCC and

is dated 27 January 1972,

expresses "great delight" with the formation of the

and conveys the Commiltee's "best wishes of militant soil-

darity and friendship."

The VCSWAP requests that the SDCC

write often and "send us materials you have."

In an apparent reference to the 21 August

actions, the PCPJ leader added that representatives of the

Stockholm Conference on Vietnan will speak on the subject of

the alleged American bombing of dikes

(Comnent: We have no.present information concerning plans of

Stockholm Conference representatives to travel to the United

Foreign Support for Activities Planned to Disrupt

or Harass the Republican National Convention

SUMMARY:

There are no new indications of specific foreign pláns or efforts to

inspire, support, influence, or exploit activities designca to disrupt or

harass the Republican National Convention in Miami, Florida, 21-24 August

1972. Although mectings have been held recently in Paris., France, between

Amcrican antiwar activists and representatives of the Democratic Republic

af North Victriam (DRV) and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of

South Victnam (PRG), currently available information indicates that the

DRV/PRG officials made no efforts to encourage or give guidance to the

American participants with respect to the upcoming Republican National

Convention. Private discussions, separate from the meetings with the entire

American delegation, were conducted by both the DRV and the PRG officials;

• at present, we have no information regarding the substance of these private

exchanges. A sccond group of activists, considcred more important than

the first delegation, is scheduled to travel to Paris on or about 1 sugust 1972

for further consultations with the PRG and DRV representatives.

DEVELOPMENTS:

In recent meetings in Paris, France, with members of an American

del¿gation sponsored by the Anti-War Union (AWU), representatives of

the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV, and the Provisional Revolutionary

Government of South Victnam (PRG) were very guarded with respect to dis-

cussing activities at the Republican National Convention. Although the Vietnam-

ese repeatedly questioned the Americans concerning the mood of the antiwar

movement in the United States, they made no direct refezence to the Repub-

lican Convention, except for one instance when PRG Deputy Chief Nguyen

Van TIEN accused President Nixon of using the private and public sessions

of the Paris peace talks as "propaganda for the Republican Convention. "

TIEN then urged the Americans to promote and propagardize the Seven

Point Plan ofiered by the PRG. The Americans, too, for the most part,

refrained from discussing the Convention, other than to estimate that demon-

strators will number about 10,000 at the Convention.

Following their meeting on 22 July 1972 with the AWU delegation,

.:06 WAR 1972

Foreign Support for Activities Planned to Disrupt

Or Harass the Democratic National Convention

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION:

There are no direct indications thus far of foreign

efforts to inspire, support or tale advantage of activities

designed to disrupt or harass the National Convention of

the Denocratic Party in Miami, 10-13 July 1972.

The concept

of coordinated international support for donestic activities

in the United States was generally endorsed at the recent

World Assembly for Peace

and Independence of the Peoples

of. Indochina: however

all for international the Conference issued no specific

support of disruptive actions at the

American national political conventions.

BACKGROUND:

At. the Soviet-controlled World Assembly for Peace

and Independence of the Peoples' of Indochina, held in

Versailles irom 10-1s February 1972, there las mention oi

American plans for domonstrations at both the Republican

and Democratic National Conventions.

The final draft

resolution from

the conference's "Action Commission" con-

tains an appendix submitted by Ancrican dclegates whose

goal was to socure global coordination for comestic actions

in the United States.

It calls for international support

to six vecks of domestic antivar actions and demonstrations,

from 1 April to

.1s May 1912, and concludes with the state-

ment: "This campaign will lead up to the Democratic farty

•Convention at Miami on July 9, 1972, and the Republican

Party Convention in. San Diego on August 21, 1972."

The final "Resolution of the Paris World Assembly

for the Peace and Independence of the Indochinese People"

of 13 February 1972, drafted by the "Political Commission"

states:

• . .

"In the United States particularly, the protest

against the war is voiced more and more strongly,

under. various forms, such as draft

-:°

evasions,

desertions, resistance, demonstrations which

now affect even the soldiers.

The Assembly

calls for support to these progressive and

antivar forces in the United States, and asks

governments to grant

asylum to deserters

to support their right to repatriation.

All together, the peoples of the world

•efficiently help to impose on the U.S. Govern-

ment the restoration of peace, independence

and freedon in Vietnah',

Laos and Cambodia."

Foreign Support for Activities Planned tò Disrupt

or Harass the Democratic National Convention

SUMBIARY:

New indications of foreign efforts or plans to inspire,

support, influence, or exploit actions designed

to disrupt

or harass the Democratic national Convention in Miami, 10-15

July 1972, are linited to a reiteration by a

member of the

Secrctariat of the Stockholm Corference on Victnam of a

statement previously issued by the lorld Assembly for Peace

and Independence of the Peoples of Indochina.

The Assenbly's

pronouncement generally endorsed the concept of

international

support to a campaign of

anti-Victnam War activities

in the

Unitca States Icading up to the Denocratic and Republican

conventions, but made no specific call for support of dis-

ruptive actions at the conventions themselves.

DEVELOPIENTS:

In early April 1972 an influcntial and well-informed

staff menber of the Stockholm Conference on Vietnam discussed,

in private, the international anti-Vietnam lar activities

conducted on 1, 15, and 22 April.

The Stockholm Conference

menber stated that

these actions were part of an international

•Campaign in support of domestic American

antivar efforts

during the period 1 April to 15 Nay 1972, and

"will culminate

at the election conventions in July and August."

The World Assembly for Peace and Independence of the

Peoples of Indochina, of which the Stockholm Conference was

a major organizer, had carlier enunciated a similar statement

in an appendix to the final draft resolution of the Assembly's

Commission." The appendix called for international

support to six weeks of domestic antilar actions and denon-

strations, from 1 April to 15 May 1972, and concluded with

"This campaign will lead

up to the Democratic

Party Convention at Miami on July 9, 1972, and the Republican

Party Convention in San Diego on August 21, 1972."

labor situation, and particularly to try

to ameliorate the quarrel between George Neany and

Walter Reuther. IEN-35

stered a very skillful

course in this connection, but the Agency could be

vulnerable to charges

that we went behind leany's back,

or were somehow consorting with Reuther against leany's

wishes.

8. There are three examples of using Agency

funds which I know to be controversial..

One was the

expenditure of money under Project NOSES in securing

the release of Cuban Brigade prisoners.

Details of

this operation are best known to Larry Houston, Mite

Miskovsky

IDEN-131

, and Jares Smith.

Second,

as you well know, when Lou Concin received his sunmons

to report to the Joint General Staff Headquarters on

1 Novenier 1963 a large amount of cash went with him.

My impression is that the accounting for this and its

use has never been very frank or complete.

Thiid, at

one of the carly Special Group moetings attended by

McCone he took strong excuption to proposals to spond

Agency funds to improve the economic viability of liest

Berlin, and for an investment program in vali. His

general position was that such expenditures were not

within the Agency's charter, and that he would allow

such spending only on the direct personal icquest of

the Secretary of State or the Secrotary of Defense, or

the White House.

2.

I raise these issues of funding because I

remember the Agency's being severely criticized by the

House Appropriations Subcommittce for having spent $3,000

for stamps in connection with a program to buy

tractors

to secure the release of prisoners from

Cuba.

10.

Under the heading of

old business, I know that

any one who has worked in the Director's office has worried

about the fact that conversations within the offices and

over the telephones vere transcribed.

During McCone's

tenure, there vere microphones in his regular office,

his inner office, his dining room, his office in East

Building, and his study at his residence on

White Haven

I do not know who would be willing to

raise such

an issue,

but knowledge of such operations tends to

spread, and certainly the Agency is vulnerable on this

score.

11. Also under the heading of old business, I

Union.J Shortly after the Cuban missile crisis, there was

a disposition in Washington to reexamine the Bay of Pigs,

and the fact that several Alabama Nazional nir Guard

officers lost their lives in the Bay of Pigs was surfaced

with surprisingly little excitement at the time.

12. During my stint on the. Ith floor there was

a special

arrngement with the Office of Communications

wherehy the Director's office guined accoss to non-CIA

This surfaced bricfly at one point shortly after

Admiral Rayborn became DCI.

He had visited the Signal

Center and

removed a coyy of a telegram from the Embassy

in the Dominican Republic for Under Secretary George Ball,

He ruturned to his office and proeceded to

discuss this telegram with George Ball who vas naturally

quite curious as to how Rayborn knew about it, and also as

to how Rayborn had it in his possession before Ball did.

Bon Read in the Sccretary of Stace's office and I spent

several weeks putting this one to rest.

13. Finally, DCI. McCone, as you and I well know,

opcrated on a very

lofty planc, and I think certain of

his activitics could be. misunderstood: One example was

his decision in July of 1961 to have Aristotle Onassis and

Maria Callas flown from Rome to. Athens on Air Force KC 135.

Their arrival in Athens in this airplane attracted the

attention of the local press and in due course Mr. John

Hightower, Chief of the Associated Press Bureau for

Washington, came to see me to ask about the propriety

of this action.

14. The use of

IDEN-132

aircraft

has been remarkably secure, but DCI cCone himself

forgot about

the cover arrangement and became quite

exercised whon he saw Candidate Goldwater land in the

San Francisco airport for the Republican Jational Con-

vention in 1961 aboard the

IDEN-133

with

the highly visible tail nunder IDEN+13+. This was, I

explained to him carefully, a perfectly lcgitimate

charter, but he didn't like

it.

15. McCone dealt quite extensively with

newsmen

in Washington.

In fact, they gave him a gift and a

luncheon when he left Washington, which is

perhaps

indicative of the press's relations with him. However,.

in the case of the Ross and Wise book, The Invisible

Government, he did try to bring pressure on the publisher

and the authors to change things.

They did not change

a comma, and I

doubt that this old saw willever sing

again.

10.

Finally, and this will reflect my fiddle

Western Protestant upbringing, icCone's dealings with

the Vatican, including Pope John XXIII

and Popc Paul

VI,

would and could. raise eyebrows in certain quarters.

17. The above listing is uneven, but I have a

sinking

iceling that discipline has broken down, and that

allegations from any quarter which cast these things in

• the wrong light would receive great publicity and attention,

and no amount of denial would ever set the record

straight.

If I may be of any assistance in tracking down further

details, I am of course at your disposal, but I would point

Foreign Support for Activities Planned to Disrupt

or Harass the Republican National Convention

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION:

Indications remain limited, thus far, of foreign efforts

to Inspire,

support or take advantage of activities designed

to disrupt

or harass the National Convention of the Republican

_Party in San Diego, 21-23 August 1972. The concept of coordinated

international support for domestic activities in the United

States was generally endorsed at the recent world Assembly for

Peace and Independence of the Peoples of Indochina; however, the

Conference issued no spocific call for international support of

disruptive actions at the Anerican national political conventions.

BACKGROUND:

At the Sovict-controlled World Assembly for Peace and

Independence of the Peoples of Indochina, held in Versailles

from 10-1s February 1972, there las mention of Ancrican plans

for denonstrations at both the Republican and Democratic

National Conventions.

The final draft resolution from the

Confercnce's "Action Connission" contains an appendix

submitted

by American delegates whose goal

was to secure global coordination

for domestic actions in the United States. It calls for inter-

national

support to six wecks of domestic antivar action's and

demonstrations, from 1 April to 15 May 1972, and concludes with

the statement:

"This campaign will lead up

to the Democratic

Party. Convention at Miami

on July 9, 1972, and the Republican

Party Convention in San, Diego on August 21, 1972."

The final "Resolution of the Paris Norld Assembly for the

Peacc"and Independence of the Indochinese People" of 13 February

1972; drafted by the "Political Commission" states:

"In the United States particularly, the protest against

the war is voiced more and more strongly, under various

• forms, such as drait evasions, desertions, resistance, demon-

strations which now affect even the soldiers.

calls for support to these progressive and

the United States, and asks the

governnentsantiwar forces in

to grant asylun

to deserters and to support their right to repatriation.

All togother, the peoples of the world will efficiently

help

to inpose on

the U.S. Governnent the restoration of peacc

and independence and freedom in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia."

SUBJECT: Technical Operation Against IDEN-76 Embassy

in 1971 and 1972

1. A technical penetration of the IDEN-76 Embassy in

rashington, D. C. was mounted by the FBI with the support of

this Agency in April-May 1971. This oporation, which used

Agency equipment and technical expertise but was managed

operationally by the FBI, was initiated only aftor then-

Director Richard Helms had gone over the head of former

FBI Diroctor J. Edgar Hoover to obtain the approval of then-

Attorney General John N. Mitchell. The operation was dis-

continued at the Agency's request on 2 February 1972 when it

appeared that Director

Hoover intended to testify before.

until it became inoperative in early 1972 because of

battery failurc.

3. In December 1972 the Agency requested reactivation of

the operation for a 60-day trial period in spite of the limitca

value of intelligence produced previously (22 disseminations

of only noderate interest). Reactivation was requested because

of strong interest in the spocial IDEN-76 government mission

arriving in Washington in late December to conduct high-level

talks. with U.S. State Department officials concerning debt

-renegotiation and other major items outstanding between the

_two-countries. The operation was reinitiated on 21 December

1972 but was discontinued again on 22 February 1973 by Acting

was prompted by a decision that the intelligence production of

this operation did not justify the risks involved in continuing

to run it in the sensitive political climate caused by the

mounting disclosures

Instead, emphasis has been placed on the exploi-

capability of a concurrent capability for provision of

information responsive to the program's requirements.

This has involved the provision of custom-tailored collec-

This collec-

tion program is viewed as an integral part of the recruit-

ment and collection programs of China Opcrations, Vietnam

Operations, Cuban Operations, Soviet BloC Division opera-

tions and Korcan Branch operations.

Agents who have an

American "Movement" background of who have known connec-

tions with the American "'lovement" are useful as access

agents to obtain biographic and personality data, to dis-

cern possible vulncrabilities and susceptibilitios, and

to develop opcrationally exploitable relationships with

recruitment targets of the above programs.

These assets

are of intcrest to our targets because of their connec-

tions with and/or knowledge of the American "Movement."

over the course of the clichaos program, there have been

approximatoly 20 important arcas of opcrational interest,

We have accepted this as a condition precedent and have proceeded with

our operational activities in the most professional manner possible under

There are cortain rather unusual activitics in which

FR Division las participated and/or is participating that contain some-

what grater possibility for embarrassment if discovered. I have listed

these below, not necessarily in order of embarrassment potential:

JFK(I)CR)

a. Ihe New York Base provides a fairly considerable

amount of support to Dr. Kissinger in his contacts with the

Chinesc. This support was authorized by Mr. Karamessines

and Mi. Helms. Thus far there las been no problem other

than the inordinate amount of time spent by(New York Base)

We have concluded that the best solution is to have this

officer attend à university in the Midwest for at least

a year, working towards an advanced degrce until there

has been time for the situation to clarify itself. We plan

to make no operational use of tie CIA Oifivar wnatsoever,

during the period of time that he is attending the university.

Upon completion of his year's study, we will review the

situation and decide the nesi course of action at that time.

Paragraph 1, c. is deleted because it contains sensitive

d. FR Division has been bricfed in general on the

This operation is directed

against

for this activity has come from Chief, ISD in conjunction. JFK()(S)

CIA personnel have entered the premises. The operation was

deactivated and is presently dormant. The mikes, however,

Within the area

of contractual responsibilities, the

following items are pertinent:

In February 1971, Colonel L. K. White, the then

Executive Director-Comptroller, called me to attend a

meeting in his office,

also attended by Mr. William Colby.

colonel sinite explained that the Technical Services

Division (TSD) had been requested to provide assistance

co the rol for a sensitive projec:

Colonel White did not dis

close®

the purpose of the assistance being provided by ISD

but did instruct me to assist TSD on

purely contractual

matters., Since the Office of logistics

has no information

concerning the mission or purpose of Project

sub-.

stantive questions concerning the subject should be

addressed to TSD. Other procurerent actions accomplished

for the FBlire reoorted belnu.

Specific mention is made,

however, of the Project because of the dollar magnitude, ap-

proximately sl million,

and the complex technical equip

men't that has been involved in the undertaking.

b.

the Procurement Division, Ob, currently has tic

requisitions in hand fron TSD which would involve rein-

bursable

sales to the FBI. One such requisition

in the

amount of $36,900 is for

two kestinghouse television

cameras. The

second requisition in the amount of s11, 200

is for two wide-angle surveillance probes manufactured by

Bausch

and Lomb. No action is being taken on either of

these requlrements pending further instructions which

will be sought from the Deputy Director for Management

and Services.

. Over the years, thist AgencyJhas often supported

other Government agencies fron a contractual or materiel

standpoint. Upon the submission of an officially approved

request, supported by a transfer of funds, (the Agency) Jab

would either enter into "acconmodation procurements"

the requesting agency of support the requesting agency by

the issuance of materiel from stock. Such actions are

legally accomplished under the Economy Act of 1925. This

Act authorizes one agency to support the needs of, or pro-

Executive Fellowship." The book is entitled "Where's

What -- Sources of Information for Federal Investigators."

It is a full treatise on the existence of sources of in-

formation that nay be useful to an investigator.

The

book's first printing of 300 copies was made in June 1967.

Due to demand, a second printing of 600 copies was made

The book is classified Confidential,

and it is our understanding that the distribution vas nace

appropriate agencies of the rederal Governaent.

A copy

of Nr. Murphy's book can be made available for review if

desired.

Sometime in 1972, a representative of the Law

Enforcement Assistance Administration (LELl) requested

that the Agency give consideration to our publishing, at

LEAA expense, an unclassified version of this volume.

It

was the intent of LEid to make broad-scale distribution

to Police Departments throughout the country.

The Director

of security and 1 consulted on this matter and jointly

determined that the Lei request should not be honored be-

causelthe Agencyshould not put itself in the position of

publishing law enforcement material for general and un-.

classified purposes, and it would be an abuse of our print-

ing facilities.

b.

On 5 January 1971, the Director of Security re-

quested that I approve his

leasing up to eleven motor

vehicles for use in connection with a special support

operation which would last approximately s months.

The

Director of security intormed me,

in his requesting memo-

randum of 5 January 1971, that "This support activity has

been undertaken at the specific instruction of the Director

• and has his personal approval."

The request las approved.

From 1968 to date, the Office of Security has

requisitioned from this Office a considerable amount of

materiel which we understand was to be given or loaned by

by funds furnished by the Office of Security. A complete

listing of such materiel is found in Attachnent 2.

In connection with the responsibility held by this

Office to obtain, manage, and dispose of safe sites for all

Agency operating

components, the following information is

relevant.

A safe aäte, identified as "Safehouse 562" which

is Iden 88

"was made available to General Cushman's

office on 23 July 1971.

The subject safe site was acquired on 15 June 1970

as a replacement for a terninated OL standby safe site

and in keeping with the approved requirement for a com-

plement of five standby safehouses for all Agency use.

The apartment has one bedroom and is located in an older

high-rise building along Iden 89.

The nominal

lessee is Iden 90

a security-cleared

attorney with offices located at Iden 91

• The cover story utilized is that

Iden 90, rents the apartment for business conferences,

meetings, and occasional overnight stays by his staff

and/or his out-of-town clients.

The original lease term

was

for a l-year period, 15 June 1970 to 14 June 1971,

with month-to-month renewals thereafter.

As an OL standby

safe site, the apartment has been used by various Agency

components to meet their short-term or crash requirements.

Control of the standby safe site and its security is the

responsibility of this Office. A record is maintained of

each user,

component, and date of use; however, no record

is made of those

persons being met at

the site nor for what

purpose the site is being used (meetings, training, etc.).

Such information is maintained by the operating component

requesting the safe site. Records maintained by this

Office disclose only that the apartment involved was made

available to General Cushman's office on 25 July 1971 in

answer to a telephonic request.

b. This Office is aware, although it had no cognizance

1.

The twò notes of 13 and 20 January 1972 refer to approval

by the DCI (at that time Mi. Helms) for the expenditure of $30-32K

Jack retired from the Agency about five years ago on disability due

to a serious heart condition. He was with the Office of Security for

about 20 years prior to his retirement.

2. During a private conversation Jack/told me that he had

been interviewed, three or four times by the FBI in connection with

the cCord-Hunt affair. I asked him why he had been interviewed,

and he told me that in late 1971 he had been contacted by Howard

Hunt who suggested that he consider an assignment as Security

Officer for the Republican Party. Jack visited Washington in

January 1972 to discuss the proposed position with Howard Hunt

who apparently was acting on behalf of the Republican Party. Lacks

furnished a resume to Hunt and discussed the position with him.

Ultimately, he decided not to accept the position because he felt

that his heart condition would not allow him to become involved in

such activity.

3. According toltack! during the meeting with Mr. Hunt

they discussed some of the requirements of the job. At that time

they discussed a need for both a positive and a counteraudio program

nd a need ior a good security system both before and during th

Tational Convention. (Jack indicated that he sincerely believed tha

the Republican Party did need a security officer and a good security

programmer but felt that he could not afford to accept the job even

though it was a very lucrative offer. Apparently, money was not a

problem.

who might be

5. [Jackinformed me that he assumed that the Bureau

obtained his name due to the resume he furnished Mr. Hunt. He

said that the Bureau had talked to him on three or four occasions

and that he had written up about a 40 page statement concerning

his dealings with Mr. Hunt. When asked about Mr. McCord, Jack)

said that he really did not know McCord that well and declined any

knowledge of Mr. McCord's technical capability.

: 6. Mr. Bauman indicated that he had not been in touch

with Mr. Hunt since the early part of 1972 and knew nothing of

the Watergate operation. He stated that he had gained the impres-

sion from the Bureau interview that the technical devices were being

removed at the time of the arrest and were not being installed as

originally reported.

7. All of the above information was volunteered by Mr.

Bauman, and I really did not get involved in any discussion on the

matter other than to comment that I hated to sec thetagency's name

connected with such an incident in any way. The above conversation

took place during a 10 or 15 minute period and no other discussion

relating to this ircident was held. It is being reported for the record

and for information of the Director of Security.

significance to warrant his interest and because it has been on record with

the Agency) since July 1972. However, if you feel that the information is of

such interest that it should be forwarded to the Director I shall put it in the

proper format to do so.

2. My only contact with anyone named in connection with the

Watergate and related matters was through vir. Jack Bauman a former

Agency employee now retired and living in Winterhaven, Florida. In

December 1971Vir. Baumanicalled me from Florida and advised that he

wanted to get in touch with Howard Hunt. He said that he did not have Hunt's

home phone number and that it was probably unlisted but that since Hunt was a

former employee, could I contact Hunt and ask him to givel Vr. Baumana call.

I had only met Hunt once about 10 years before but I agreed to relay the message.

I called Howard Hunt at his home and told him that vir. Bauman/did not have his

home phone and requested he callAir. Bauman. Mr. Hunt thanked me for

relaying the message and said that he would call Mr. Bauman This seemed of

little consequence to me in December 1971 but in July 1972 Iden 17

of the

Office of Security contacted me in regard to the FBI investigation of the Watergate

situation. At that time I informed Iden 17 of the telephone call from

Mr. Bauman in December 1971. Attached is a copy of a Memorandum for the

Record prepared by. Iden 1? as a result of our conversation.

3. In the summer of 1972 I took my family to Disney World in Florida

and took that occasion to drop in to see Jack Bauman MI. Bauman) told me in

1. OCI began

TwO DDI memoranda were produced on the subject:

"Black

In June 1970, Archer Bush of OCI was asked to

worldwide student dissidence.

Confronted by tinult at

campases like Columbia and mindful of the violence

acconpanying student outbursts at Berlin's Free University

and elsewhere, Rostow sought to learn whether youthful.

dissidence was interconnected:

spawned by the same causes;

financed and hence manipulated by forces or influences

hostil to the interests of the Us and its allies; or likely

to come under inimical svay to the detriment of US interests.

2.

The paper was preparca by Paul Corscaddon/ of OCI

with the assistance of the CA and CI Staffs.

The DDI,

•/OCI, and Corscadden met with Rostow to elicit the reasons

for his or

the Presidcht's concerns and to agree on the

sources to be examined, the research methods to be followed,

etc.

Written during the summer of 1968, the most

sensitive version of Restless Youth comprised two sections.

The first was a philosophical treatment of student unrest,

SUBJECT

: Sensitive Activities

1.

FBIS has been engaged in no activities related to the Ellsberg

and Watcrgate cases. •

2. FBIS operations occasionally extend to the domestic arena. From

time to time, FDIS linguists arc made available to DDO or Office of

Connunications components for special operations (usually abroad) involving

close-support SIGINT work or translation of audio take. On one occasion.

recently DDO, on behalf of the FBI, requested the services of several

FBIS linguists skilled in Arabic to work dircctly for tha FBI on a short-

torm project here in Washington.

The arrangements were made by Mr. Oberg

of the DJO CI Staff. He said the project was very highly classified and

that FBIS participation vas approved by tir. Colby and the Director. FBIS

participation was. approved by the Director of FBIS after a check with

the ADdI..

Other. examples of sensitive linguistic support work are help

in the handling and resettlement of crfectors, the recent assignment of

an employee to the. Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs to transcribe

recordings in a rare Chinese dialect, and the detailing of another

Chinese linguist on two occasions to assist in the U.S. military training

of Chinese Nationalist cadets.

Within its responsibility for monitoring press agency trans-

missions for intelligence information, FBIS publishes and distributes

some material which falls in a "gray"

area of copyright protection, libel,

and privacy of interrational connunications.

Press services controlled

by national governments and transmitted b; radiotcletype without

specific addressees, c.g. the Soviet TASS service and the PRC's BCN^,

are monitored by FBIS and the material is disseminated without restric-

tion. The legality of this has been affirmed by decisions of the

Office of General Counsel. However, we also monitor some in-house,

correspondent-to-headquarters dispatches which are considered private

point-to-point transmissions. FEIS therefore avoids public distribution of

material monitored from

these circuits by labeling them with an "Official

Use Only" caveat.

The same caveat is used on material which we monitor

from other press agencies which arc protected by international copyright,

e.gi Agence France Presse (AFP), the Middle East News Agency (NENA), and the

Iragi les Agency (INA). This procedure has allowed FBIS to disseminate news

agency material for nearly three decades without problens.

Recently,

however, the Office of General Counsel has ruled that an "Official Use

Only"

caveat will not bar such material from the general public under

the Freedom of Information Law and ve are accordingly looking into

alternative neasures, among which arc: (1) the purchase of news services

with rights to publish and disseminate; and (2) the classification of

those itens vital to the government's business which we nust continue

to monitor and report.

An ultimate decision will be weighed against

the risk of present procedures:

4.

The routine FBIS monitoring of foreign radio broadcasts often

involves statements or spacches made by U.S. citizens using those radio

facilities.

Examples are statements made or allegedly made

by Anarican

POW's in Hanoi, by Jane Fonda in Hanoi and by Ransey Clark in Vietnam.

At the rcquest of FBI and the Department of Justice, and with the

approval of the CIA Office of General Counsel, we have on occasion sub-

mitted transcripts of such broadcasts to the Department of Justice as

part of that Department's consideration of a possible trial. In such

cases, "e have been required to submit nanes of FBIS monitors involved,

: TSD Support to Other Agencies

1. Technical Services Division's charter (CSI 1-8) requires

that it provide technical assistance to both CIA operations and

other activities as may be directed by the Deputy Director for

Operations.

2. Over the years thel chief non-CLA recipients of this

support have been the Department of Delense, the Federal

Burcau of Investigation, Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous

Drugs, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Department

of State, United States Postal Service, Secret Service, Agency

for International Development, and the White House.

3. While varying widely among the different recipients, these

services have included training and materials, and in a few in

stances participation in the fields of audio and visual surveillance,

secret writing and related communications, personal protection,

disguise;

concealment devices, electronic beaconry, illicit narcotics detec-

tion, and counter-sabotage/terrorism.

4. In most instances requirements for this support are

received by TSD through higher echelons (Office of the Director

or Deputy Director for Operations). Unless the service involved

is a trivial or continuing one, the request is referred to the

Foreign Intelligence Staff Departmental Coordination Group for

coordination and approval at the appropriate Agency levels.

Approval within TSD by the Chief of Operations or Development

and Engineering and the Chief of ISD or his Deputy also is re-

quired.

5. The attachment lists the primary services provided to

the organizations named in Paragraph two.

ATTACHMENT

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

TSD has had a close working relationship with the FBI over

the past few years. The FBI is the only organization that has

been fully briefed on ISD audio techniques and equipment. The

following are situations where ISI equipment and guidance were

involved in operations:

(A) Identity 59

- Four masked transmitters were

installed. Two have failed and tvo remain workable.

(B) Identity 60

- A TSD built masked transmitter

was installed to collect emanations from a crypto-

graphic machine. The system continues to function

when samples of the emanations are needed.

(C)

Identity 61

- Two transmitters have been

installed and are operating. One is specifically

designed to collect the sounds of typewriting, the

other is a straight audio transmitter to colluct con-

versations. A FBl agent is manning the listening

post.

A third system

is not oper-

ating, probably due to battery expiration. The tape.

made from this room

was made 'by the National

Security Agency before failure.

(D) Identity 62

- ISD furnished equipment and con-

sultation covering Identity 62

First masked switched trans-

mitters were used in to apartments used as tempor-

ary quarters. Later masked switched transmitters

and microwave transmitters were installed in the

permanent quarters along with mic and wire installa-

tions, entirely furnished by the Bureau. This install-

ation is not fully operational because the full comple-

ment of personnel have not yet arrived.

(E) Iden

-

This is an operation with additional

participation by National Security Agency.

It is

designed in anticipation of the Identity 64

: in Washington. The listening post was

obtained by usingithe Agency covert mechanisms

for procuring the property.

New systems are

being designed and produced by using ISD's covert

contractor mechanisms and ISD engineers.

(F) Identity 65

- Ten masked audio devices pur-

chased from TSD were installed in Identity 65

by the FBI. Part of the equipment was install-

ed in November and December 1971, the remaining

equipment was installed 17 - 25 March 1972.

Tests

made by a TSD officer from a temporary. FBI

listening post on 8 - 9 November 1972, proved that

the target equipment no longer functioned and was

believed discovered by the occupants.

(G) TSD has furnished equipment items which constitute

an on-the-shelf capability to engage in photo and

audio surveillance operations which might not be

known to the Agency. In one case it is known that a

relatively unsophisticated device was used against

a domestic target.

SUBJECT:

Contacts with Domestic Police Organizations

1.. In December 1968, July 1969 and December 1970, SDB

provided basic countersabotage familiarization training for

selected members of the Washington metropolitan area police

departments.

The training was given at the fairiax county

police pistol and rifle range.

Authorization for the train-

ing came from DDP and Chief, Office of Security.

2. On occasion during the past few years, under the

auspices of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration of

the Department of Justice and with the approval of CI Staff

and Office of Security, SDB provided training and familiari-

several domestic police

departments in the uses of the Explosives Residue Detection

Technique and Trace Metals Detection Technique. These tech-

nigues had been declassified and are currently available to

the law enforcement community. The National Bomb Data Center

publishes periodic guidance in their uses.

3. In order to augment the SDB mission responsibilities

in the field of countersabotage and counterterior, SDB offi-

cers have in the past two years visited, under appropriate

covers, the explosives disposal units of the New York City

police department, Dade County (Miami) Florida Dept. and the

Los Angeles Police Dept.

Also, in March 1973, two SDB offi-

cers attended the Explosives and Ordnance Disposal Conference

in Sacramento, California, sponsored by LEAA.

When the

recent letter bomb menace

began in September 1972, our liaison

with the NYCPD bomb squad paid off in that we had complete in

formation on letter bomb construction in hours, enabling the

Agency to make worldwide dissemination within a day.

DOMESTIC TESTS FOR

AGENCY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS

1.: As a normal part of ORD's efforts in the

research and development of equipment and techniques

conduct experinents and 'tests in the United States.

Clearly, the design and development of our intelli-

gence cquipments can be done more cconomically and

more securely in this country.

Although nost of

the tests of our RaD equipments are performed in

closed laboratories or in secure arcas simulating

the foreign environment, some of the tests and expori-

ments, of necessity, reveal domestic information.

2.

A review of the surveillance equipment or

techniques which have at some time or other been

exposed to domestic tosting is as follows:

a. Laser Probe - About 1967, the laser

probe dcveloped by ORD was tested by TSD in

San Francisco under very closely controlled

conditions.

portions of the test. Recordings that were

made of laser probe output were carcfully

controlled as classified material and it is

believed that the tapes have long since been

destroyed. (Wood/TA)

bi Microwave Intercept System - About

1968, this systen was es ed in a light air-

craft near the Naval Ordnance Test Station

in Identity 127:, California. This system is

designed to pernit intercept of microwave

telephone communication channels of systems

such as

Identity 130

cordings of these

• C.

Telephone Intrusion Study - The objec-

tive of this current program is to develop a

means to utilize foreign telephone systems as

a communication link without the knowledge of

the host system.

In order to carry out this

objective, it is necessary to leain the com-

plete

supervisory signalling and sequencing

control system hicrarchy for the various foreign

telephone systens.

Many of these are patterned

after the U.s. system and, for this reason,

limited monitoring to test the operation of

intercept equipment in the United States

is

planned.

The data to be collected would

be

merely the signal tones from which supervisory

can be extracted. Message content is

of no interest and will not be recorded.

Over-

testing is planned at a subscquent date.

To date, some domestic testing of this

concept

has boon carried out at the contractor's plant.

No recordings have been made of such data.

tremely brief

tests excrcising U.S. and forcign

telephone systems through supervisory tone sig-

nalling have been carried out to verify initial

concepts..

The duration of testing was less

than one-half hour.

d. Other Sensor Testing - Examples of

engineering development tests of special sensors

within the United States include infrared and

(FLIR) flights,

airborne magne-

tomctor surveys for metal (rifles and trucks).

In all these cases, the data output of such

testing has been used for engineering develop-

ment and the content has been restricted to

dissemination to those in Government involved

with the engineering design.

itself, i.e., lcaving one roligion for another,

or changing one set of political beliefs for

another.

The work was conducted at Stanford

University. Identity 125 /LS)

Trained Birds

- Birds have been trained

and tested in the United States to carry small

intelligence collecting packages such as

audio

surveillance devices, small cameras, and cur-

ren't measuring dovices. Any data collected

from unwitting domestic sources would have been

used only for engineering purposes and then

destroyed.

h. Conmunications Link Loading Study - In

the period from 1970 through 1972 various means'

were used to check out an intercept system designed

to operate against Iden 93

communications links.

Under carefully controlled conditions, some U.S.

microwave communications were recorded

and passed

through the intercept system under test to prove

quality of performance.

connected with this was destrojed within a few weeks

of the

My total contact with other agencies in terms of assistance

with domestic operations has been in the field of audio sur-

veillance countermeasures, anti-hijacking, or drugs. Speci-

fically, I participated in TSCC and R&D Subcommittee meetings

which included technology exchanges and some equipment ex-

changes on a temporary basis ostensibly for testing or trial.

•I also assisted in x-rajing the office walls of the Chairnan

• of the MEC (then Mr. Schlesinger) at the request of Mr. Richard

Cowan of AEC Security. The operation occurred one evening

(date unknown) and was an attempt to resolve some anomalies

created by the use of the nonlinear junction detector.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Executive Secretary [CLA Management

Committee

SUBJECT

: Reported Identity 61

. Burglary

1. Attached is a report summarizing what we know about the

reported break-in of Identity 61.

An investigalive report

by an officer of the Exccutive Protective Service states that the

offices were ransacked and a number of personal items stolen.

2. The attached summary also describes a separate audio

operation conducled against Identity 61

by the FBI, at the

Agency's behest and with its technical support.

This presents a

Felated question that should be notcd. James McCord's' testimony

indicates that he placed telephone calls to the. Identity 75 and Identity

61.

He says he picked the numbers at random, hoping

that if his phone was tappod his attorneys would be able to challenge

the evidence as being tainted. Another witness, John Caulficld,

says McCord called the two named Iden 75 and Iden 61 because he "was sure"

they "vere subjects of national security wirctaps."

3. In fact, there has been a long-standing telephone lap on the

Identity 75

, run by the FBI, about whichCI Stalloclieves McCord

knew.

It is possible that he also had an inkling of some sort of operation

aganst Identity 61

', and assumed that it was also a telephone

tap.

One must speculate that he played for double insurance, hoping

that both his Ielephones and those of the Iden 75 and Iden 61 were tapped, and

that one way or another his case would be dismissed or dropped

because of tainted evidence or to avoid revealing the sensitive

operations. At this point, given the publicity of the

Iden b1 break-in,

and the lestimony of NicCord and Caulfield, the current investigations

may lead to exposure of the operations.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Inspector General

SUBJECT

: Reported Burglary of the Identity 61

1. The press reported a burglary of Identity 61

• 13-14

May 1973. An investigative report by an officer of the Executive

Protective Service states that the offices were ransacked and a

number of personal items were stolen. There were some latent

fingerprints, but no identitication was made. The FBI, which states

that the incident was on 15 May, did not investigate becauso il deter-

mined that it did not have jurisdiction. The Identity 61

registored a formal complaint and Ameriçan regrets were expressed,

Identity 61

making it clcar that they suspected something other than

ordinary robbery. We have no additional information on the subject.

There had been an carlier intelligence opcration against the Identity 61

which is described below.

aron of technical coverag be danity a

2. On 16 April 1971/lhc Agency proposed to the FBI the instal-

The opportunily

for such an installation came about when a domestic asset of Foreign

Resources Division reported that he had been asked to submit a bid

for a contract to renovate

Identity 61

Upon securing the

contract the asset was willing to augment his work force as appropriate

or install material which would be provided him. The Agency proposed

to turn this asset over to the FBI and to provide technical and logistic

support. The value of such an opcration to the intelligence community

was cited,

3. On 23 April 1971 FBI Director John Edgar Hoover turned

down the Agency proposal. That same day CIA Dircctor Richard Helms

sent a letter to Attorney-General John Mitchell requesting that the FBI

turndown be reversed, citing the importance of the Iden 61 target and

national intelligence nceds to collect positive intelligence..

On 24 April

the Attorncy-General reversed the FBI decision and the Washington

Field Office of the Bureau was instructed to proceed with the operation.

4. During the period from 26 April to 18 May all the

technical equipment from the Agency to the FBI was delivered,

installed and tested. Everything seemed to be working. No Agency.

personnel were involved in any way with actual installation of

equipment in

Identity 61 From May to February Agency tech-

nicians helped calibrate, reset and do other repair work on occasions

of equipment failure in the FBI listening post. On no occasion did

they enter Identity 61.

5. The Agency requested that coverage of Identity 61 : be

stopped on 3 February 1972 after FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover

advised that he was scheduled shortly to testify in Congress and

might have to advise them that the installatior in Identity 61

was initiated at CIA's request. The operation and equipment, to the

best of the Agency's knowledge, was dormant until 8 December 1972

when the FBI was asked by the Agency to reactivate coverage. The

request at this time was occasioned by the knowledge that a Iden 76

delegation would be arriving in Washington for discussions on

nationalization of foreign holdings,

While the FBI was still

in the process of reactivating the equipment, the Department of

State on 20 December 1972 requested the FBI to institute all possihle

coverage of Identity 61

and on 22 December 1972 coverage

was partially reinstituted with full coverage in effect by 26 December

1972.

6. A review of the take from the operation, weighed against

the risks involved, led the agency to conclude that the activity was

not worth continuing. On 16 Fcbruary 197 CLArequested the FBI

tó discontinue the coverage. On 22 February 1973 the FBI advised

that microphone surveillance of Iden 61

was discontinued.

Coordination.

A. Internal

In developing its cadre of general support assets

and access agents, the FR Division maintains close contact

with the Domestic Contact Service of the Directorate for

Intelligence, using their assets wherever and

whenever

possible to support FR's operational activities. To a

more limited degree, FR Bases

maintain contacts with Office

of Security and Office of Personnel field representatives,

pursuing the occasional leads surfaced by these officers

and using their entre to specific individuals who can

provide access to targets of operational interest.

B:

External

FR officers in the field maintain coordination with

their FBI counterparts. There is linited cooperation

with Bureau offices on internal security cases involving

Soviet and Bloc officials and the local FBI offices are

of occasional help in operations involving other nationals.

The local field offices of the FBI are made aware of the

presence of FR officers in their jurisdictions and have on.

occasion provided backstopping on cases. where there was.

some

flap potential.

Coordination with the FBI of FR Division's agent

recruitment activity is governed by an agreement between

the Agency and the FBI dated 7 February 1966.

The Bases

also have contact with local Immigration

and Naturalization Service offices although these contacts

are less frequent

and less important than the contacts

with "the FBI

offices.
