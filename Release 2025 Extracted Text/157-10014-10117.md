Re:

Richard Goodwin Materials and Summary

summary

A. Goodwin Interview of July 16; 1975

Mr. Goodwin was interviewed for a second time

on July 16, 1975. He indicated that he chaired the "Cuba

Task Force" after the Bay of Pigs. Paul Nitze had pre-

viously chaired the group. It was this Cuba Task Force

that suggested the establishment of the Lansdale project.

In this regard, Goodwin noted that Lansdale proved to be

very efficient. Goodwin indicated that he was present

during the conversation between President Kennedy and Tad

Szulc concerning the question of assassinating Castro.

(See Szulc's testimony infra.) ¡ He spoke with the President

after that conversation and remembers JFK saying about

assassination:

"We can't get into that -- we'll all be

targets."

He noted that Bissell never mentioned anything

to him, Goodwin, about assassination attempts. With regard

to the August 10, 1962, meeting, which he attended, Goodwin

NH 50955 DocId: 32423505 Page 6

---

## Page 7

- 2

noted that McCone never made any oration upon the immorality

of assassinating Castro. He remembered the August 10 meet-

ing and said that "assassination was not shot down"

When

pressed for details at this point, and after being shown

the Lansdale (8/13/62) and Harvey (8/14/62) memoranda, he

said he wanted to think about the meeting before he made

any more statements about who said and did what. He noted,

however, that in

1966 while in Peru with Robert Kennedy that

Kennedy, in a fleeting retort to a series of questions

about U. S. assassination attempts against Castro, said

"Tell him (the interpreter) I saved his (Castro's) life."

At the conclusion of the interview he turned over

to the Committee various documents related to Cuba which he

had found in his personal papers. Those are appended to

this summary.

B. Goodwin Interview of May 27. 1975

During the course of

this earlier interview,

Goodwin alluded to the Cuba Task Force. According to the

Committee notes of that interview, the discussion went as

follows:

In general, Goodwin had not heard much

specific talk of assassination, although

it would not have surprised him if it had

gone on.

He mentioned one specific in-

stance in which he had heard talk of

NW 50955 DocId:32025505- Page 7

assassinating Castro. After the Bay of

Pigs, a Cuba Task Force was established,

first chaired by Paul Nitze and then by

Goodwin in his capacity as White House

Staff Officer. At a meeting of the Task

Force, held at the State Department,

McNamara suggested

"getting rid of Castro",

someone from the CIA, perhaps Bissell,

then asked if McNamara meant "Executive

Action".

McNamara responded that he did

and stressed his interest in the idea.

However, Goodwin did not bring the topic

up later in the meeting after McNamara

left. (See interview infra.)

C. The Goodwin Documents

The documents which Mr. Goodwin has furnished

the Committee are of no startling significance. One docu-

ment, the May 2, 1961, memorandum from Bissell to Goodwin,

is noteworthy because it does not advise him of the Roselli

connection or the efforts to assassinate Castro. Bissell

notes, "I have not attempted to

provide you with much

detail." A May 24, 1961, Memorandum of Conversation with

Bissell by Goodwin does not mention any reference by Bissell

to actions against Castro on the assassination front. An

Arthur Schlesinger memorandum of June 30, 1961, to the

President discusses the need for revamping of the "intelli-

gence set-up" of the United States.. In a footnote in that

memorandum, Schlesinger notes that the CIA is not able to

control its operatives once they are in the field and of

the attendant dangers this poses. (See page 6 of the memo.)

The other documents indicate the thinking that went on up

to the point where the Lansdale group was established

as

the coordinated effort against Cuba.

Areas of Inquiry for Goodwin

- What, if anything, does Goodwin remember of the August

10, 1962, meeting of the Special Group which he attended?

-- Is this meeting different than the meeting he refers to

in his initial interview where McNamara broached the sub-

ject of assassinating Castro? Or has he simply confused

them and are they one and the same?

-- How does he explain McCone's recollection of having given

an oration on the immorality of assassinating Castro when

it was brought up at the August 10 meeting?

- Was McNamara the person who brought up the subject at

that meeting?

- What discussion, if any, followed?

As indicated by the combined INR/ONE estimate, anti-Castro

activity within Cuba will probably be muted at least for the next

several months.

Most individuals whose loyalty is in any way

suspect have been arrested. A recent report from the Swiss

Ambassador indicated that political prisoners now number 100, 000.

All internal services will continue to work on a theory of repression

plus undoubtedly swift and brutal penalties. Consequently, it will be

very difficult to carry on any clandestine operations and it is doubtful

that such operations can have any significant impact in weakening

the Castro

regime.

In spite of this, evidence is still available that there is opposition

to the regime among individuals still at large and that such opposition

is prepared to undertake action despite

the risks involved. Moreover,

there are still agents distributed through most of the six provinces

and communications can

still be had either directly or indirectly with

these individuals. At the very least these agents can and will continue

to collect information and to transmit it to the Agency. In addition,

certain of these individuals, plus some additional ones who might be

infiltrated, could attempt to carry out some sabotage. Individual

acts of sabotage are possible with relatively few men and small

amounts of material. Successive

acts

of sabotage i extensive

sabotage operations are more difficult and inevitably more costly in

terms of loss of men.

Nevertheless,

it would be possible,

starting

the near future, to attempt limited sabotage with a view to determining

its feasibility and with the hope that gradually an increased

program

might be developed.

A capability also exists for types of maritime operations including

infiltration and exfiltration of individuals,

landing and caching of arms,

under-water

sabotage of shipping and sinall

raider operations.

Under

present circumstances it would seem

wroNg

to attenpt these except on

a very limited scale and, in all likelihood,

raider operations

should not

be attempted until more information regarding feasibility has been

obtained.

Ihe Agency also has a

small air arm including

some transport

aircraft (C-54 and C-46 types) plus attack

bomber aircraft (B-26).

Although it is

not absolutely certain, there

is

reason to suppose that

Cuban crews also are available for operational flights. At the moment,

air operations

should be substantially eliminated with the

possible

exception of supply flights to support opposition elements unable to

survive without such support. Even with respect to such operations,

however, it should be remembered that the percentage of successful

night drops is extremely limited

so that the urgency should be great

to justify the risk. B-26 strikes could, of course, be flown against

chosen targets (e.g. refineries, power plants, tire plants) and, if

successful, might have the effect of extensive sabotage.

In view

of the risks involved, however, and the poor deniability of U.S.

support where aircralt are involved,

it is recommended that such

operations be avoided at least for the present.

Manolo Ray of the MRP has asserted an independent ViRP

capability to conduct infiltration, intélligence collection,

sabotage

and defection operations into Cuba.

He recognizes a need for U.S.

support but is very firm in his desire

to operate as independently

as possible of any official U.S. connection.

His initial request

is for five boats, some materiel

and

some money. He admits,

however, that, looking ahead, additional support such as real

estate, some help with training and

communications will be required.

He offers to share his information

with the U.S. Government, seek

U.S. advice and, at least for a period of time, be willing to operate

with the Revolutionary Council. The

Council's views are being

canvassed and Ray has been asked to

prepare a prospectus giving

in some detail his needs for U.S. support for the immediate future

and the step-up required over a period of time should his efforts

prove successful.

The Ray proposal should certainly be examined and given support

within rcasonable linits if the relationships proposed both with the

Council and with the U.S. are satisfactory.

In addition to the activities described above, propaganda

activities such as radio broadcasts and publication of magazines

and newspapers can be continued independently by the Agency or

in support of Ray or the Revolutionary Council. Moreover, limited

political action operations are possible. As to both propaganda

and political action, however, the amount of effort and the type

of activity undertaken will depend to

a large extent on the decisions

with respect to

the operations described above.. Consequently,

these will be noted here

MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION WITH:

Dick Bissell

Tracy Barnes

Mr. Bissell agreed that no major decisions concerning covert activities

in Cuba should be made before the President returns from his European

trip. However there are a few things he thought should be done Immediately:

1. That he revise the internal ClA organization in preparation for possible

covert activities. This means changes bothehere and in Miami.

2. That a small group (30 to 40) Cuban pilots be continued as pilots under

commercial cover in Central America and perhaps one or two American

companies. No commitment should be made to them that they would be

used in future activities. They would be trained as individuals and not

as any group or "movement." This is primarily to keep their skilla

alive and to keep them available.

3. He wishes to clean up the Nicaraguan situation. We have left a lot of

Military hardware there as a residue of the Cuban operation.

He would

like to pull this equipment out of there, turning somo of the B 26's over

to Somoza and allowing some of the Cuban pilots to remain there to train

Nicaraguans in flying these planes. This would be at Somoza's request

and would only be done if he insisted upon it as a re-payment for services

rendered. I stressed that no Americans should be involved in the train-

Ing of Nicaraguan pilots.

1. He would like to train a few Cubans as radio operators. They would be

trained as individuals and would not know each other or that any others

were being trained. Thia amounts to training some individual agents for

possible future use. No commitments would be made to any of the men

trained. It is felt that this much activity is necessary in the next few weeke.

5. In addition, the Agency would like to survey the various potential inaur-

recitonary groups which now exist. There are several of these groupe,

three or four of which claim to have an undorground in Cuba. We should

speak to them. We should tell them we could make absolutely no commit-

ment as to any future activities. However, he would like from them an

assorment of what they thought they could do in the future and - If they

were to be active what help they would require from the United States.

This would enable us to make & judgment at to whether we should en-

gage in covert activity based partly upon this information - informa-

tion which would tell us what help in specific terms would be required

and what we could expect from these groups. This has already been

done in the case of Mirona Ray. The groupe contacted would include

thetCouncil, the MRP, UNIDAD and MRR.

6. In addition, he was informed that Swan radio could not be uned by the

Ust They are unable to assimilate it into their system. & suggested

- that we might try to find a good Latin American group, 0. 8., The League

of Democratic Partios or the Institute of Political Iducation run by Jose

Figures, to use it. I said that for the Council to operate the station did

not seem to me to be desirable.

%. I discussed the general eituation in Miami and the various newspaper

reports. I pointed out that the MlA agents now in Mlami were known to

everyone, including the press, and were the same people who were

idontified with pre-invasion activities. Their presence I felt only in-

tenstiled the rivalry among Cuban groups and sorved as a socal point of

discontent. I requested that this group be broken up and that to the ex-

tent agente were necessary new peopld people not identified with the

pre-invasion activitles - should be sent to Miami.

8. It was agreed that no future covert activitien should be conducted in

the Miamt ares and that the groupe with whom we dealt should be scattered

In other cities throughout the Sourteastern part of the country. I said that

working la Miant was like trying to carry on covert activities in the city

room of a newspapes.

9. We also agreed that Di. Miro could be intormed that we were making

a survey of other Cuban groups but that he should be told nothing more

specific than that.

10. I also reforned to the newspaper stories which reported that Batiatiano:

were being used supported by U.S. -CIA funds. They sadd this was not

accurate. They sald that this would be very carefully looked into and that

the most specific Instructions would be given that absolutely no Batistianos

should be supported directly or indirectly by the U,S. government.

11. I am strongly of the opinion that we must clear up the Miami area

a8 soon as possible. Therefore, I will

get Ribicof! to expedite the

Rouges program, probably through the use of Mutual Security funds

in order to got these people into jobs, schools, etc. In other parts of

the country. Unless we do this we me going to have continually in-

creasing problema in the Miami aisa.

WASHINGTON

July 8, 1961

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. RICHARD GOODWIN

SUBJECT: Cuban Covert Plan

Analysis of this plan shows that it envisages (a) "an island-wide

resistance organization responsive to Agency direction"; "internal

assets under close Agency control and direction"; (b) "support and

guidance to those anti-Castro groups who are revealed to have a

potential for clandestine operations"; and (c) "primary operations

bases" in the US.

In short, what is intended is a ClA underground

formed on criteria of operational convenience rather than a Cuban

underground formed on criteria of building political strength sufficient

to overthrow Castro.

Despite the pretense of political impartiality, the effect of these CLA

specifications is obviously to favor

those groups most willing to accept

CIA identification and control, and to discriminate against those groups

most eager to control their own operations.

I.e., the plan discrimi-

nates in favor of mercenaries, reactionaries, etc., and discriminates

against men of independence and principle.

Thus

these criteria elimi-

nate the Manuel Ray group; yet I can find nowhere in the documents

any explicit exclusion of pro-Batista people.

Leaving aside the moral merits of this discrimination, the practical

effect is to invest our resources in the people least capable of generating

broad support within Cuba.

The Agency fails to confront the key prob-

lem: i.e., that those most capable of rallying popular support against

the Castro regime are going to be more independent, more principled

and perhaps even more radical than the compliant and manageable

types which CIA would prefer for operational purposes.

My recommendation is that you stop this paper in its present form and

demand that it be recast to make political sense.

The key is the

statement that our covert activity "should be viewed only as the

covert contribution to any national program designed to bring

about the eventual replacement of the Castro government. "

This

is correct; and there follows from it (a) that our covert activity

should encourage the spread of the political sentiments within Cuba

most likely to rally support for Castro's overthrow (which means, for

example, Ray rather than Batista), and (b) that our covert activity

should harmonize with our basic national policy of rescuing the Cuban

Revolution, as set forth in the White Paper.

It is a fallacy to suppose that clandestine activity can be carried out

in a political vacuum.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

The Cuban Task Force met at the White House on Thursday, August 31.

Present were Under Secretary Ball, Assistant Secrotary Woodward, two

members of the ARA Durcau, Dick Bissell, Tracy Barnes and myself.

"i:*

The following decisione were made:

I. We would proceed immediately to discuss with other Carribean govern

ments the poasibility of organizing a Carribean Security Force. Thie could

be organized on the basis of informal understandings within the framework

of existing treaty arrangements, aa a series of new bilatera, treates, or a

formal, multilateral treaty. It was thought that the basis of organization

would depend on the judgment of other Carribean countries aa to how they

could accompligh the objective of establiching the force without running

serioua internal political riska. The United States, for ita part, would pre

fer the formal multi-latoral arrangement.

Such a Carribean Security Force

would have at least four major aspecte:

(1) Advance committment to come to the aid of other signatories

threatened by Castro rovolutione and, perhaps the designation

of specific units for participation in necessary multi-lateral

actions.

(2) The establishment of a pool of intelligence information con-

cerning subversive activitles with provision for exchange of

such loformation.

(3) The establishment of a Carribean air and sea patrol to watch.

for suspected infiltration of Castro arma of agente.

(3) A training program in combatting subvereive tactica, police

organization and procedure, etc.

It was conceded that the substantive aspects of this arrangement could, if

necessary, be achieved informally. However, the decision to seck a more.

formal arrangement was primarily arrived at on the baale of internal political

considerations in the United States.

SECRET

WW. 60995 DooEd: 32123505 Page 52:

2. It was decided that our public posture toward Cuba should be as quiet as

posaible -- trying to ignore Castro and hia island.

"3. Our covert activities would now be directed toward the destruction of

targets important to the economy, C. Be, refineries, plants using U.S. equip-

ment,. etc. This would be done within the general framework of covert opera-

tions - which is based on the principle that para-military activities ought to

be carried out through Cuban revolutionary groups which have a potential for

establlahing an effective political opposition to Castro within Cuba. Within

that principle we will do all we can to identify and suggest targeta whose des

truction will have the maximum economic impact.

4. We will intensity our surveillance of Cuban trade with other countries and

especially U. S. subsidiaries in other countries; and then employ informal

mathode to attempt amlivert this trade - depriving Cuba of markete and

sources of supply. I understand that we have already had a few successes in

this effort.

5. We will establish next week -- in the State Department -- a psychological

warfare group. This will be a full-time group of three or four people charged

with the responsibility of assembling all available information on the Sovietiza-

tion of Cuba, repression of human rights, failure of the Cuban economy, etc.

- much of which has been hitherto classified - putting this information into

readable, popularized form, and developing methods of disseminating it through

Latin America. Such dissemination would bo primarily through USIA channels

but would include feeding it to Latin papers for "exclusive" stories, helping to

prepare scripts for Latin American broadcaste, perhaps a direct mailing list

of intellectuals and government officiala to be handled by a front group, etc.

The basic idea is to get this stuff into channels of Latin American communica-

tion, instead of treating it as official U. S. Propaganda. We have selected

someone to head this effort -- Jim O'Donnell of George Ball's office who was

a free-lance magazine writer (including work for the Saturday Evening Post)

for many years and who Ball highly recommends.

6. The CIA was asked to come up within the week . with a precise, covert

procedure for continuing the below-ground dialogue with the Cuban government.

The object of thia dialogue to explore the possibility of a split within the

governmental hierarchy of Cuba and to encourage such a split - was fully de-

tailed in my last memorandum to you. This is an effort to find an operational.

technique.

EXES ONLY FOR THE PRESIDENT

November 1, 1961

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:

I believe that the concept of a "command operation" for Cuba, asdiiscussed

with you by the Attorney General, is the only effective way to handle an all-

out attack on the Cuban problem.

Since 1 underatand you are favorably dia-

posed toward the idea I will not discuss why the present disorganized and

uncoordinated operation cannot do the job effectively.

The beauty of such an operation over the next few months is that we cannot

lose. If the best happens we will unseat Castro. If not, then at lease we will

emerge with a stronger underground, better propaganda and a far cleares

Idea of the dimensions of the problems which affeci us.

The quention then in who should head this operation. I know of no one current

ly in Cuban affaira ai the State Departmen: who can do it. Nor is it a very

good idea to get the State Department involved in depth in such covert activi

ties. I do not think it should be centered in the CLA. Even if the CIA can find

someone of sufficient force and stature, one of the major probiems will be to

revamp ClA operations and thinking . and this will be very hard to do from

the inside.

I believe that the Attorney General would be the most effective commander of

such an operation. Zither 1 or nomeone else should be assigned to him au

Deputy for this activity, since he obvioualy will not be able to davote full time

to it. The one danger here in that he might become too closely identified with

what might not be a successful operation. Indeed. chances of succese are very

speculative. Thare are & lew answers to this:

(1) Everyone knowledgeable in these affairs - in and out of govern-

ment - in aware that the United States le already helping the underground.

The precise manner of aid may be unknown but the fact of aid is common

knowledge. We will be blamed for not winning Cuba back whether or not we

have a "command operation" and whether or not the Attorney General heads il.

-2-

(2) Ilis role should be told to only a few people at the very top

with most of the contact work in carrying out his decisions being left to his

deputy. If that deputy is someone already closely identified with the conduct

of Cuban affairs then it would appear as if normal channels are being followed

except that decisive attention would be given to the decisions which came

through those charnels. There are probably three or four people who coulld

fulfill this criterion.

This still leaves a substantial danger of identifying the Attorney General as

the fellow in charge. This danger must be weighed against the increased

effectiveness of an operation under his command.

2. Guerilla and underground

3. Propaganda

4. Economic warfare (exclusive of covert activities within Cuba)

5. Diplomatic relations

Each of these divisions would be headed by someone directly responsible to

you.

In addition you would have a deputy who would do the actual contact work

between this operation and the various government agencies involved. He

would be the one identified as the source of orders and directives when direct

contact with the agencies was needed. How hanna takagakysin-

mict

He should be from CIA for reasons discussed below. I

would act as Staff Assistant to you. My primary job would be to see that

current questions for decision were presented to you at your morning staff

meetings with the alternatives fully discussed. I would have no direct opera-

tional duties; thus keeping in the back ground.

I have talked to MacNamara and he has promised to supply a topflight guerilla

and underground man, as well as whatever additional personnel we need. I

think this is the best way to handle it.

However, it will be necessary to use

the CIA apparatus and agents for this. That is why it will be valuable to assign

a CIA man to you as deputy in order to keep them happy and she-them net

a deeply involved at the command level.

In this way we can probably

avoid an internal struggle between the CIA field operatives and the Defense

command.

Both the diplomatic relations and economic warfare people can come from

State. I have some ideas on this and - if you give the signal -- will discuss

it with George Ball.

One of Bob Amory's brightest young men should be assigned to intelligence

collection and evaluation.

As for propaganda, I thought we might ask Tad Szule to take a leave of absence

from the Times and work on this one

-- although we should check with Ed

Murrow and Dick Bissell.

These people should have a headquarters. It should probably be at the Pentagon

because (a) we might get better security; (b) MacNamara will be easier to work

with in terms of getting whatever staff services, secretarial personnel, etc;

(c) It is a relatively neutral place between State and CIA; (d) you could re-

arrange your schedule to stop in on the way to Justice every morning --

perhaps for a breakfast or post- breakfast meeting.

This operation should not be discussed at tomorrow's meeting. Initially only

George Ball (and Rusk, of course), MacNamara, McCone and Bissell should

know of your participation

When

they are named, the five section heads

will have to know -- the the initial organizing work and contact work should

be done through your Deputy and myself. If this subject is discussed tomorrow

then already too many people will know about it.

The first steps are (a) name the section chiefs (b) review with them all current

operations in their field, establish their authority over operations, get nec

essary

staff assistance (on as small as possible basis), and start them to

work; (c) establish the physical headquarters; (d) arrange for financing --

presumably coming largely from CIA.

If this meets with your approval I will begin work on the above items with all

final decisions on personnel and other matters subject, of course, to your

approval.

Mr. Hurwitch

Defense/JCS: Mi. McNamara,,

Mir. Gilpatric, General

CIA: Mr. McCone, Mr. Harvey

USIA: Mr. Murzow, Mr. Wilson

1.

Mir. McCone said that the conclusion of the Board of

National Estimates was that the Soviots will not let the Castro

regime fail because of its own inherent veaknesses. This thought

had not been contained us such in the Nlt. Later in the neuting,

Mr. McCone said that he bolieves we must face the fact that Cuba

will be stronger in a year or two than it is now; he added his per-

sonal opinion that the sovicts might consider establishing on Müh

in Cuba.

He noted that these two points are nut necessarily

concurred in by the loard of rational Estimatis or by the USIB.

At Secretary Rusk's ruquest, General Lansdale gave a brief.

explanation of the four possible courses of action outlined in recent

papers. he then summarized progress to date by saying that during

Phase 1, now completed, an incensive intolligence look has been

caken at Cuba, that we have learned a greaï deal, but that we do not

yet have a true assessment of resistance potential.

3..

Mir. Rusk suggested the possibility that in the event of a:

Me. McNamara was uncertain on this point, saying

4.

Mr. Kusk emphasized the desirability of attempting to

create a split between Castro and old-line Conmunists.

He pointed

out that such a split would be bound to be beneficial to U.s.

interests no matter which way the balance of power swung.

In this

general connection, it was hard for hin to visualize a valid pretext

for U.S. military intervention in Cuba under any circumstances

currently foreseen. However, should reasonably viable resistance

¡evelop to the extent lor example that some provinces might oppose

he Havana Government, then the U.S. might desire to give support

to such provincial officials.

In response to the above, Mr. McCone pointed out that at

the moment the previously-cited frictions betveen Castro and the

•old-line Cormunists have been resolved in Castro's favor, and no

issue currently exists. There has

additionally becn at lcast a

temporary rapprochement between Fidel and Moscow. le indicated that

this of course may be temporary. He said that there has been some

success in recruiting Cuban officials abroad to work for the U.S.,

and that there have been some defections.

5.

The discussion then turned to the objectives of the

MONGOOSE program. Mr. McNamara questioned whether ve cannot séparate

the building up of agent assets within Cuba from actions thai would

hurt the U.S. in the eyes of world opinion. This lou to the sug-

gestion by General Taylor that we should consider changing the

over-all objective from one of

overthrowing the Castro regime to one

of causing its visible failure.

In this context Mr. McCone then presented an alternate

plan (called hercafter the "CIA variant") to the stepped-up Course B

described by General Lansdale, which he taid had been prepared as a

result of the conclusion that stepped-up l would not in fact result

in the overthrow of Castro.

He emphasized that the stopped-up plan

should not be undertaken unless the U.S. is prepared to accopt

attributability for the necessary actions, including the eventual

use of U.S. military force. Tir. McCone said that a süepped-up i will

risk inviting an uprising, which might result in a llungary-type blood

bath if unsupported. Not only would the U.S. be blamed, but there

would also be a high noise level in the press and eventually a situation

would be created which would require intervention.

On the other hand, the CIA variant now proposed would, in

Mr. McCond's view, avoid all of these dangers because it would not

invite an uprising.. Again lie repeated his view that the U.S. night,

however, face a stronger Cuba in the future.

THE WHITE HOUSE DEFICE

## Page 65

6.

The principal members of the Spocial Group felt, after

some discussion, that the CIA variant should be developed further

for consideration al next. Thursday's meeting of the Special Group.

Mr. McCone was asked to stress economic sabotage, and to emphasize

mcasures to soment a Castro-oldline Communist split. It was

emphasized that any actions under this plan must be so designed

3 S

to avoid major attribucion to the u.s.

7.

General Lemnitzer told the Group that the Navy does not

wish Guantanamo used as a base for opcrational activities, is

suggested by CIA. He said that the other Chiefs have not yet given

an opinion on this but he thought that they would agree with the

Navj, as he himsolf docs. The view is that this base is too important

to the U.S. and too vulnerable to Cuban pressure to take the chance

of provoking Cuban reaction. The State representatives agreed with

this view.

lic. Bundy suggested that. a hard look be taken at the

possibility

of support to selected Cuban cxiles on a strictiy

"disengaged" basis; in other words, should they be given covert

financial and material support, with tlie idea of secing what they

could generate on their own.

9.

Mr. Rusk suggested that continued pressure should be

placed on Castro by keeping interest in the prisoner issue alive.

10. Action to be taken:

CIA to preparo a new version of its variant plan, in

accordance with the above-summarized discussion. This should be

ready by Wesnesday, August 15ch.

1. Action.

None. This memorandum is for your inforination.

:

Za Referonce is made to our conversation on 13 August 1862,

concerning the memorandum of that date from General Lansdale.

Altached is a copy of this inemorandum, excised fiom which are

four woids in the second line of the penultimate paragraph on

page l. these four words were "including liquidation. of.leaders."

3. The question of assassination, particularly of fidel Castro,

was brought up by Secretary McNamara at the mecting of the

Special Group (Augmented) in Seeretary Rusk's orfice on 10 August.

It was the

obvious consensus at that meeting, in answer to a

comment by Mr. Dd Murrow, that this is not a subject which

has been made a matter of official record. Itook careful notes on

the comments at this mecting on this point, and the Special Group

(Angmented) is notexpecting any wiillen cominents of study on

this point.

4. Upon Icccipt of the allached memorandum, I called

Tansdale's office and, in his absence, pointed out to trank lInnd

the inadmissibility; and stupidity of putting this type of comment in

writing in such a document. Ladvised Frank Hand that, as far

as CIA was concerned, we would write no document pertaining to

this and would participate in no open meeting discussing it.

I strongly niged Hand to recommend to Lansdale that he excise

the phrase in question from all copies of this memorandom, in-

cluding those disseminated to State, Defense, and USTA. Shortly

thercafter, Iansdale called back and left the inessage that

he agrecd and that he had done so.

INIERVIEW AND MEETING SUMMARY

Time:

Place:

Goodwin's residence, 1536 32nd St. NW

Participants:

Sel. Com. - David Aaron, Rick Inderfurth, Greg Ireverton

Subject:

Intelligence Activities in Latin America

Submitted by: Gregory F. Treverton

During the 1960 Presidential campaign, Goodwin did foreign

policy work for John Kennedy,

specializing in Latin America. After the

election he moved into the White House to handle Latin America. During

that period he spoke with the President about a Latin American matter

the average once a day. Goodwin left the White House in the fall of

1962, becoming Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American

Affairs under, first, Robert Woodward and then Edwin Martin.

After

working for the Peace Corps, Goodwin was brought back to the White

House by President Johnson, in the spring of 1964, after the Panama

crisis. At that time, however, he did not specialize on Latin America,

instead writing speeches for Johnson.

He left the Administration late

in 1965.

1.

Assassinations:

In general, Goodwin had not heard much specific talk of as-

sassination, although it would not have surprised him if it had gone

He mentioned one specific instance

in which he had heard talk of

assassinating Castro. After the Bay of Pigs, a Cuba Task Force was

established, first chaired by Paul Nitze and then by Goodwin in his

capacity as White House Staff Officer.

At a meeting of the Task Force,

held at the State Department,

McNamara

suggested "getting rid of Castro,

someone from the CIA, perhaps Bissell, then asked if McNamara meant

"Executive Action."

McNamara

responded that he did and stressed his

interest in the idea. However,! Goodwin did not bring the topic up later

in the meeting after McNamara left.

Io Goodwin, the idea was not reasont

able even apart from moral objections, for the Bay of Pigs had shown that

Cuba was

politically stable; Castro would merely have been replaced

with

Raul or with Che Guevara,

both worse than Castro. Somewhat later,

Goodwin sat in on an interview Tad Szulc had with Kennedy in which the

President pledged not to kill Castro. Szulc reported that pledge in an

article in Esquire. When he finished his period as Chairman of the Cuba

Task Force, Goodwin wrote a memo recommending that the United States

let Castro

alone; anything the United States did to him could only but-

tress his position in Latin America.

During his time at the State Department, Goodwin met every

week or so with E. C. King, Chief of the Western Hemisphere Division

of the CIA, and King never mentioned a plan to assassinate Castro.

Nor

did Robert Kennedy ever mention such a plan to Goodwin when Goodwin

worked for Kennedy, in 1966 and 1967.

Goodwin did believe, however, that the United States was in-

volved, at least indirectly, in the successful plot on Trujillo's life.

During the Eisenhower Administration, the United States had severed

diplomatic relations with Trujillo and attempted to isolate the Dominican

Republic. There were frequent reports that Trujillo was about to be as-

sassinated, but the assassination never came off. In fact, the govern-

ment was

surprised when it occurred. HenryDearborn, the American Consul

in Santo Domingo, had been charged with staying in contact with anti-

Trujillo forces. Prior to the

assassination, he had transferred some

weapons, presumably handguns, to those forces. Goodwin suspected that

INTERVIEW AND MEETING SUMMARY

Page 3 of 6

FILE:

the President probably did not know of the gun transfer, but he said

that the assassination and the U.S. role with respect to it would have

come as

no

surprise to the President. He doubted that the CIA even

would have had to clear the transfer, although a general policy of that

sort might have been passed by the Special Group.

Goodwin reported no other mention of assassinations. In fact,

he said he once heard a CIA man say that assassination was a bad idea

because once started, it never ended. However, an agent in the field

might regard killings of one sort or another as within his mission in

supporting one political faction over another.

And of course someone

might have gotten carried

away. It was clear from the Bay of Pigs that

the CIA sometimes acted without, or even against, instructions (e.g.

by bringing Batista followers

into the Bay of Pigs invasion team). In

general, Latin American work seemed to attract the worst personnel in

all Washington agencies including the CIA.

2. CIA Activities in Brazil:

Goodwin knew little of CIA activities in Brazil. The United

States had strongly backed Quadros and never liked Goulart. In the

period before 1964, the U.S. gave political support to anti-Goulart

factions: followers of Kubitschek and even to the Furtado in the

Brazilian northeast. The U.S. had been involved in Brazilian elections

for many years and presumably spent a good deal in the 1963 congres-

sional elections.On the military side, Walters was brought from Rome

to keep a contact with the Brazilian military. How much further

Walters' activities might have extended Goodwin did not know.

3. CIA Activities in Chile:

The Kennedy Administration decided that left wing democratic

forces in Latin America were the only means of combatting communist

influence and promoting development in the region. That decision was

applied to Chile, and the U.S.

switched its support from the conserva-

tive Alessandri. Goodwin sat

in on meetings of the Special Group only

rarely, only if Latin America

were the subject of the meeting. As he

remembered it, the proposals that came to the Special Group were general

statements, policy papers, not descriptions of recipients of support or

conduits. In line with the policy, support was given to left democratic

political elements. The U.S. certainly provided assistance to the

Christian Democrats in the 1964 elections, but Goodwin did not know

how much. The figure of $20 million, mentioned by Stern, did not seem

inconceivable to Goodwin. He contested, 'however, the assertion that

the Chilean election was the most intensely watched election in Washing-

ton since the 1948 Italian campaign. From his vantage point in the

White House it did not seem so.

4. Changes during the Johnson! Administration:

Johnson cared less about Latin America than had Kennedy-

Johnson was interested only in Mexico--and so knew less

about covert

actions in the region.

Thomas Mann was left to run Latin American

policy, although the President.

did become active in the two crises-

Panama and then the Dominican Republic. Goodwin saw a sharp change

in United States' policy under Mann. Mann supported the military and

conservative elements in Latin American societies, and American support

for left democratic reform ended.

Goodwin professed himself puzzled

by Johnson's assertion that he had discovered a "murder incorporated"

in the Caribbean. The only specific instance Johnson ever cited was

Trujillo, yet Johnson had known about the Trujillo assassination from

the very beginning and so could hardly have "discovered" it after he

became President.

5. Covert Operations and Counterinsurgency:

When asked about the ethos surrounding covert actions during

the Kennedy Administration, Goodwin responded that the major emphasis

was counterinsurgency, not covert action.

There was certainly no

reluctance to use covert action, but no one believed that American

objectives could be secured through it. Counterinsurgency was some-

thing different. A good deal of money was spent training police through

AID, much more was spent through the Pentagon equipping Latin American

militaries, and there was as well some CIA activity.

At that point,

the U.S. really believed that the communists could not get elected to

power and that the threat was subversion. Paramilitary operations

were

considered by the Special Group

(counterinsurgency).

Latin

American matters were considered there, and in some ways

Latin

America was considered

a kind of training ground

for Southeast Asia.

Goodwin believed that in sum U.S. counterinsurgency efforts made little

difference to the course of events in Latin America. Cuba could

not

in any case provide support to guerilla movements in South America

without substantial support from the Soviet Union, and the guerilla.

movements that began had little indigenous support.

Page 6 of

6

FILE:

In response to a question about NSAM's, Goodwin noted that

these came out of the Bundy shop, which had little formal staff. Good-

win often wrote these documents. They were both general and, on

occasion, specific, indicating groups to be supported and the like.

Kennedy wanted to know the details of American activities in Latin

America.

6. Goodwin Suggestions:

Goodwin believed it impossible to control the activities of

intelligence organizations without becoming involved in their day-to-

day operations. What is required is an active Congressional committee,

on the model of the early Joint Atomic Energy Committee, with an active

staff. Once the President is

permitted both to decide what is a major

operation, and thus needs to be communicated to Congress, and who to

tell, the game is over. Confidence in men will not do; institutional

checks are required.

With respect to people to be interviewed, Goodwin mentioned

that the Station Chief in Mexico functioned as a kind of regional sub-

director. He also thought we might talk with the FBI person in Puerto

Rico, with Arthur Schlesinger, and with Tad Szulc. In response to a

question, Goodwin indicated that Nixon had been interested in the Bay

of Pigs through Cushman.

He thought that Douglas Dillon might know of

that.

the United States. Several months later, I presume because

of that trip and several other contacts I maintain with

representatives of the Cuban government at the United Nations

and the Organization of American States, because of my personal

friendship with

number of people at the White llouse and

Mr. Goodwin, Mr. Donnegan'and others, in a conversation with

Mr. Goodwin it was suggested that I come and see the Attorney

General. I was invited to lunch with Mr. Kennedy at the Justice

Department. We discussed in considerable length the situation

in Cuba following the invasion, the pros and cons of some

different possible actions by the United States government in

that context

At the end of this conversation, the Attorney General

asked me whether I would have objections to meeting with his

brother: the President. Iisaid I would of course be pleased

to do so.

The following day I received a call from the White House

indicating that the President would like for me to come in at

11:00 o'clock in the morning on that day in November, which I

did. And I was received by the President in the company of

Mr. Goodwin in the Oval Office for a conversation which lasted,

if memory serves, in excess of an hour and a half, in which the

President discussed a number of his views on Cuba in the wake

of the Bay of Pigs, asked

me a number of questions concerning

my conversations with Premier Castro, a general review of the

situation in Cuba, you know, what the United States should do,

could do, might do in terms of either in a hostile way or in

establishing

some kind of a dialogue, most relevant of which

I suppose was that at one point the President rather unexpectedly

turned to me and said what would you say, what would you think,

if I decided to authorize the assssination of Premier Castro?

Let me add for the record that the precise wording

[Othe best of my recollection, I said in the first instance as a

practical matter I thought this would not make all that much

difference even if he were because I thought that by then the

Cuban structure had been established to a sufficient degree

where the murder and disappearance of Fidel Castro would not

necessarily mean the collapse of the governing system, if this

were the purpose of the United States government.

In the secord place, it was more important to me, I said

to the President, that my personal feeling was that the United

Statas government should not be party to murders and political

assassinations at which point the President leaned back and

smiled and said, well I was testing you. I agree with you

completely.

And then he

went on for a few minutes to make the point

how strongly he felt and his brother felt that the United States

for moral reasons should never be in a situation of having

recourse to assassination

in foreign policy. Again, the

precise quotes and the precise paraphrase I placed in the article

and again I'm paraphrasing

from memory now.

And the President added in this context that the reason I

have raised it with you, or words to this effect, is because

I am under very, very strong or powerful pressure from certain

people, whom he did not identify, to authorize an operation

resulting in the assassination of Premier Castro. And I think

we talked about this for

few more minutes, and I think I

repeated the points I made

originally and the President said

he felt very strongly that

same way and the fact he was testing

me or trying.

to see what

my

response as a

reporter or as a

citizen would be.

I might add that several days ago Mr. Goodwin and I had

the opportunity to discuss this and compare our respective

recollections of

it, and MI. Goodwin's recollection

is exactly

the same as mine.

We discussed this at some length, this

being last week, and the subject being relevant to the current

flow of news and Mr. Goodwin made the point to me, obviously if

President Kennedy were planning to authorize the assassination

professional duty to rush

to your typewriter and report on this

conversation, even though

it was on a personal basis. And

Mr. Goodwin's judgment, and in which I concur, was that

with me, and this is really responsive to my own effort to

Ie-evaluate after the passage of time the President's sincerity

in disclaiming any desire to do so:

My impression at the time and today fourteen years later

is that the President was sincere and serious in affirming his

revulsion to such an idea of assassination.

PROGRAM OF COVERT ACTION FOR THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

I. BACKGROUND

A. On 29 December 1960 the Special Group approved a plan of covert

action to support the internal and exiled Dominican dissidents which

involved provision for increased propaganda directed against Trujillo,

and the financial support of selected exiled groups. Additionally this

authority included authorization for CIA to make available to selected

exile groups communications and equipment support necessary for them to

develop a capability to undertake the infiltration of personnel and

equipment into the Dominican Republic. Since none of the exiled groups

had an existing underground organization within the area, it was the

Special Group's concept that this delivery capability could be eventually

used to support the plans and activities of the internal opposition with

whom the Agency and the Consulate are currently in contact.

B. On 12 January 1961 the Special Group authorized CIA to make

available to Dominican dissidents a limited supply of small arms and

other materials on the condition that the internal opposition develop

the capability to receive these materials and that the materials be in-

troduced into the Dominican Republic by Dominicans themselves.

II. CURRENT COVERT ACTION OPERATIONS

A. In late January 1961, CIA advised selected internal opposition

leaders that we were prepared to make available to them limited supplies

of arms, communications, equipment, and sabotage materials which they

had repeatedly requested provided they developed a capability to receive

it via air drops' or sea infiltration.

To date the internal opposition has

not been able to develop this capability, nor have they been able to

nominate training candidates for code radio operators or saboteurs.

This turn of events is primarily due to the comprehensive nature of

Trujillo's security services, the

he understandable fear that prevails

throughout the Republic of being caught or suspected of anti-trujillo..

activities, and the fact that the organized internal opposition apparently

consists of only a few individuals with no real underground

structure.

CIA/has had in the direct custody of its Station in Ciudad Irujillo a

very limited supply of weapons and grenades. In response to the urgent

requests from the internal opposition leaders for personal defense

weapons attendant to their projected efforts to neutralize TRUJILLO,

three (3) 38 Cal revolvers and three (3) carbines with accompanying

ammunition have been passed by secure means to the opposition. The

recipients have repeatedly requested additional armed support.

CIA has established working relationships with selected exile

groups. These relationships have taken into account that-President

Betancourt of Venezuela has in effect designated former Costa Rican

President Jose Figures as his emissary and representative to work with

Dominican exile groups. Through Figures and with the knowledge of

President Betancourt, CIA is providing financial support and technical

guidance to the following activities:

(1) The development of a Dominican exile council in San Jose,

Costa Rica, composed of representatives of the two older exile organizations,

a representative designated by Betancourt, and chaired by Figures:

The

council had its first organizational meeting in San Jose on 12 May 1961.

Subject to CIA's review of the council's proposed program and with the

concurrence of President Betancourt, CIA has indicated to Betancourt

and Figures that it is prepared to support, the council's program in

the amount of $15,000 a month. It is Figueres! Initial concept that the

council will undertake propaganda activities directed against Trujillo,

and train selected Dominicans in democratic process, administrative skills,

and public administration so as to equip them to assume positions of res-

ponsibility in any successor government. Figures has also proposed

that an exile paramilitary

force be trained, but CIA has discouraged this

activity to date since neither Betancourt nor Figures have indicated a

clear plan for its eventual use. It is CIA's judgment that the exile

groups represented on Figures' council have little if any popular sup-

port among the internal dissidents. However one of the chief advantages

that can and is being gained by support

of the council is the number of

credits that this gives to the United States Government in its dealings

with Betancourt and Figueres in utilizing them in other operations.

Betancourt

has been adamant that no action be taken against Castro until

Trujillo is disposed of. This support has served to neutralize his

attitude on that point since 1t amounts to a guarantee to Betancourt of

the United States's basic attitude toward Trujillo. Likewise it serves

to solidify the attitudes of dissident exiled Dominicans so that they are

not anti-U.S. and will make them more approachable and amenable to

U.S. Government objectives once Trujillo is overthrown. (2) The conduct

of radio propaganda from Ponce, Puerto Rico, which 1s under the direction

of Horacio ORNES, Secretary General of Vanguardia Revolucionaria Domini-

cana (VRD). This radio program 1s heard in the Dominican Republic as

the voice of the ORNES organization.

•(3) CIA has refurbished a small yacht belonging to ORNES so as

to give it the capability to deliver small quantities of arms or personnel

into the Dominican Republic. This potential para-milltary boat capability.

has not been utilized to date. It is contemplated that both the ORNES

propaganda program and this limited boat capability will be absorbed by

the exile council now being formed by Figures.

.C. With the knowledge of President Betancourt, and using his govern-

ment as the ostensible source of funds, CIA has provided limited financial

support to a small group of Dominicans who are developing a para-military

capability in Venezuela.

D. CIA has recently re-located Dr. Juan Isidro Jimenez Grullon from

Venezuela to San Juan, Puerto Rico: Jimenez, a physician and university

professor, is a highly respected Dominican exile and enjoys the confidence

of the internal opposition. He isicurrently working with the Puerto

Rican Government in developing a training program within the structure of

the Puerto Rican Government. The objective of this program 1s to pro-

vide "on-the-job" training for selected Dominicans in democratic processes

and selected administrative skills. Through Jimenez and a small group

of recently exiled Dominicans who were active in the internal opposition,

CIA is in the process of establishing communication channels to the in-

ternal opposition which will supplement those currently In being through

E. CIA has a continuing program utilizing news media assets through-

out the hemisphere in an effort to discredit Trujillo.

III. COVERT ACTIVITIES CIA IS PREPARED TO UNDERTAKE BUT HAS NOT INITIATED

A. Train selected members of the internal opposition as code radio

operators. CIA has the appropriate radio equipment "on-the-shelf" at

our Station In Cludad Trujillo. However, this program has not been ini-

tiated due to the internal opposition's failure to provide individuals

who are able to undergo the required training outside of the Dominican

Republic and willing to run the risk of having the radio equipment in.

B. Train selected members of the opposition in sabotage and under-

ground resistance techniques. Here again the internal opposition

has

provided no training candidates or developed a capability to receive

explosive materials through clandestine channels.

IV. POSSIBLE COVERT ACTIONS WHICH REQUIRE ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZATION

A. CIA has a supply of four (4) calibre 45 sub-machine guns and a

small number of grenades which are currently in the direct custody of

our Station in Cludad Trujillo. A secure means of passing these weapons

to the internal opposition for their use in personal defense attendant

to their projected efforts' to remove Trujillo can be developed by the

Station.

B. CIA can initiate leaflet drops over the Dominican Republic,

in response to past requests from the internal opposition for leaflets

exploiting the excesses of the Trujillo regime.

C. While to date the internal opposition has developed no capability

to receive arms or sabotage materials by either air or sea delivery, CIA

could initiate operations to cache such supplies off the coast of the

D. Initiate the training of para-military cadres. CIA has been

reluctant to recommend the initiation of such training since current

I know it will be difficult for the President to find time

FOR DEARBORN FRON DEPAKTVENT

1.

President has now approved contingency plans somewhat revised subse

quent your departure and copy will be pouched to you soonest.

Hope this will

resolve uncertainties reflected your telegram of May 21 but your comments and

requests for any necessary clarification will be welcomed.

2. Department appreciates valuable woris performed by Amb. Farland and your-

self and CAS in developing pro-US attitude among dissident elements. Would hope

this could be retained and strengthened but only if at a cost acceptable from

standpoint US national interest. If price tag for friendship of dissidents,

whose action capabilities

and realistic prospects thus far remain unknown

quantity, places too great strain upon moral position and principles for which

US stands or involves risks which in our considered judgment should not be accepted,

feel sure you will agree we should stand firm.

3. While fully cognizant unique circumstances within Dominican Republic

which precluded normal CAS operation, Department is nonetheless deeply concerned

by degree to which covert activities this case have been forced to deviate from

normal cover and cut-out safeguards with result USG too openly identified with

what should be clandestine activities.

4. Running through entire dilemma has been conflict between two objectives:

• (1) To be so associated with removal Trujillo Icgime as to derive

credit among Dk dissidents and liberal clements throughout Latin America;

(2) To disassociate US from any obvious intervention in Dominican

Republic and even more so from any political assassination which might occur.

In Department's considered opinion, former objective cannot, repeat not, casily

position leaders at this time of draft document which you now hold nor deliver

copy to them. If you believe conditions specified in second and third paras

Department's telegram of May 17 fulfilled, you may advise trusted opposition

leaders that you assume any friendly group seeking to establish authority after

overthrow of Trujillo would promptly declare itself provisional government and

request armed assistance from OAS, US, Venezuela and perhaps other governments.

If reply affirmative, you may advise them orally lines you think such request

should take.

5. In May 19 meeting here with Yaguate and Cibao Department spokesman sought

disabuse them expectation USG acting either through Department or CIA could be

party to any political assassination. At same time assured them this government's

continuing sympathy for legitimate aspirations Dominican people achieve represen-

tingent upon deepening of cover arrangements

arms to dissidents. Tell them that this is because of our

suspicion that method of transfer may be unsafe. In actual

fact we feel that the transfer of arms would serve very little

purpose and expose the United States to great danger of lultinase

fameation with

disclosure of participation in/ assassination attempt. Ine basic

policy is to continue to hold open offer of covert help, while

carefully examining and clearing the specific help requested.

This is feasible because, in actual fact, the covert helly is

very slight except for verbal encouragement and exchange of

information.
