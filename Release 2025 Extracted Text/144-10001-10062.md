-=

Reference your Nr. 25118((A)).

Since the Austrian Foreign Ministry has as yet no reliable

information on the procedure to be followed by the small European

countries, with the exception of the Netherlands, it has not yet

been decided whether Austria will send a government delegation.

Please let us know immediately whether your Embassy has acquired

any information about the intentions of the Scandinavian countries,

Finland, and Switzerland. According to information here, Sweden and

Norway intend only to appoint their ambassadors to Washingtion as

special ambassadors, but have not yet come to any decision, since it

is said that the Danish Prime Minister intends to go to Washington.

It is said that the the Swiss do not even intend to appoint their

Ambassador to Washington as special ambassador.

The teleprinter is constantly busy.
