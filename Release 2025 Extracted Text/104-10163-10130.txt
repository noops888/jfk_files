POSSIBILITY OF ONE DAY BEING ARRESTED, PERHAPS AS RESULT HIS
BKHERALD ACTIVITY. AND DEPORTED TO CUBA BY LEFTIST PERUVIAN
GOVT. HE ADMITS THAT HIS EXPERIENCES IN CUBA AFTER CASTRO'S
TAKEOVER COLOR HIS PERCEPTION OF THE DANGER IN HIS CURRENT
SITUATION BUT HE IS NOT WILLING TO REMAIN VULNERABLE TO SIMILAR
DEVELOPMENT IN PERU. EVENTS OF THE PAST FEW DAYS WILL OF COURSE
NOT REASSURE HIM RE THE SITUATION HERE.
4. OTHER THAN ARTIME GAMBIT, ONLY TWO POSSIBILITIES FOR
OBTAINING PASSPORT WHICH REMAIN OPEN TO D-2 ARE PERUVIAN CITIZEN-
SHIP OR GOING TO CUBAN EMBASSY AND ASKING THAT THEY RENEW HIS
EXPIRED CUBAN PASSPORT. HE REJECTS IDEA PERUVIAN CITIZENSHIP,
CLAIMING HE STILL PLANS EVENTUALLY RETURN TO LIVE IN UNITED STATES
BUT ALSO BECAUSE HIS FEARS ABOUT ULTIMATE DESTINATION PERUVIAN
REVOLUTION AND POSSIBILITY MARXIST DICTATORSHIP COMING TO POWER
HERE. HE AND STATION ARE NATURALLY RELUCTANT HAVE HIM APPROACH
CURS. THERE PROBABLY THICK FILE ON HIM IN HAVANA AND HE WOULD
NOT WISH CALL THEIR ATTENTION TO HIS PRESENCE HERE. HOWEVER THIS
OPTION MUST BE EXAMINED AND THEREFORE WOULD BE HELPFUL IF HQS
COULD PROVIDE INFO ON EXPERIENCE OTHERS SUCH AS D-2, FORMERLY

AIRSTRIP BUILT BY ANWORLD. STRIP IS 1,883 BY 50 FEET
WITH CLAY BASE MIXED WITH NATURAL ROCK.

OUTSIDE OF CITY AND CONSIST OF TWO WOODEN CRATES, EACH
ABOUT 150 POUNDS AND 37 BY 25 BY 14 INCHES.

4. AMBIDDY-1 CONTACTED JAMES D. ZABOTH 4 MARCH, SAID
HE CLOSING OUT ALL HIS STATIONKEEPERS IN NICARAGUA, DID
NOT WANT TO ABANDON WEAPONS TO FALL INTO WRONG HANDS, NOR
TO GIVE THEM TO NIC GOVT. GENERAL SOMOZA KNEW AMWORLD WAS
LEAVING BEHIND SOME RESERVE EQUIPMENT AND WOULD KEEP
ENOUGH WEAPONS FOR LOCAL SECURITY. HE DID NOT KNOW NUMBERS
AND TYPES REMAINING. AMBIDDY-1 ASKED IF WOFACT WISHED TO
RECOVER WEAPONS, OTHERWISE HE WOULD HAVE TO DUMP THEM IN
OCEAN. ZABOTH, AMBIDDY-1 AND AMJAVA-4, WHO IN MANAGUA ON
OTHER BUSINESS, VISITED BLUFF ISLAND 6 MARCH TO CHECK
SITUATION. IF HQS WISHES RECOVER WEAPONS, MOST FEASIBLE
METHOD IS BY AIR. A CARIBOU OR C-123 TYPE AIRCRAFT COULD
LAND ON BLUFF STRIP, LOAD WEAPONS AT NIGHT AND FLY THEM
OUT NEXT MORNING. IF HQS DOES NOT WISH RECOVER WEAPONS,
AMBIDDY-1 COULD BE TOLD TO MAKE OWN ARRANGEMENTS TO DUMP
WEAPONS AT SEA.
5. DESPITE AMBIDDY-1 DESIRE NOT INFORM SOMOZA ABOUT
ARMS CACHE, COS FEELS THAT SOMOZA SHOULD BE INFORMED IF
SECRET

PAGE 4 MANAGUA 6844 SECRET
HAS DECISION IS THAT ARMS SHOULD BE RECOVERED. SOMOZA
COULD BE TOLD THAT "SOME EQUIPMENT" LEFT BEHIND BY AMWORLD
GROUP NOW STORED AT BLUFF AND LNHARP WISHES RECOVER. BELIEVE
HE WOULD AGREE TO AIRCRAFT PICKUP AS PROPOSED ABOVE. IN
STATION OPINION BLACK RECOVERY WITHOUT SOMOZA KNOWLEDGE
TOO RISKY. STATION ALSO FEELS THESE WEAPONS SHOULD BE
REMOVED FROM CENTRAL AMERICA LEST THEY FALL INTO WRONG HANDS.
6. HQS PLEASE ADVISE BY CABLE.
