of the bar, who introduced himself only as John, and asked them if there was

a particular song they would like to hear.

After playing the record requested,

John walked back over to Sources and sat down with them.

John began asking

them military related questions almost as soon as he sat down. John asked

them what unit they were from. He wanted to know where they came from

and where they were going. He asked them why they were in Datteln.

stated that he knew who the Security Sergeant at C Team, both USA Artillery

Detachment, Datteln, APO New York 09078, was.

When John did not receive the

answers to his Questions he stated that he knew what they were doing in

Datteln.

John stated that Datteln was a dead town, but that things were

hoping in Westkirchen (MC3549), FRG. The site that the convoy had just come

John then listed every site the convoy had just come from. John

identified the sites by unit designation, location, APO number, and telephone

number of the orderly room.

John was completely accurate in every detail.

John stated that he knew what they had brought to Datteln and knew how long

they were going to stay.

john talked about how easy it was to get information

by giving ten beers to almost any German soldier at the site.

1. REPORT OF FINDINGS

John wanted to know on what frequency the radios operated. John stated that

he hated to be a Disc Jockey, that he had more important things to do.

John also stated that they had some mighty fine missiles in Soest (MC3813),

FRG. John stated that the Russian Army was far superior to anything in

Europe. He talked at length about the Russian Arny.

Sources felt that

John was serious about what he was saying and not trying just to make them

uneasy. John asked Margulies if he was a CID agent.

Margulies replied that

he was not. John talked about and named every intelligence agency of the

United States. He mentioned MI, OSS, ONI, CIA, CID and the FBI.

John said

that Israel's intelligence network was far superior to that of any countries'

in Europe or that of the United States. John spoke fluent German and English

and spoke Spanish and Fussian to Sources to prove that he knew how. John

said he learned to speak English in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republic

(Ussh), and said "we have to learn many languages." John kept asking about

Ramstein Air force Base and stated that he had been to the Nco club at

Ramstein. John said he hated the FRG and that he wanted to go back to

the German Democratic Republic (CDR). John stated that he goes to the GDR

often and that he has been to Moscow (NCA), USSR. John expounded on how

much better it was to live in the GDR. John claimed to have a cousin or

nephew, sources could not recald which, who was a Major in the army in the

John talked about brainwashing at length and how information could

be gotten from people without the threat of physical violence.

John said that

the American Prisoners of War in North Viet Nam would never be the same

even after they were released.

John stated that his hobby was just listening

and looking around.

Sources said that they had to go because tommorrow

was a busy day and they had field exercises at 0900 hours.

John quipped in

"Don't you mean that you and the convoy are leaving at 0600 hours?!, and

added that tomorrow whould be a busy day from him also. John mentioned that

he had stolen something and had sold it. John described the object in great

detail, as to size, dimensions,

and color, but never said what it was.

Sources could only recall that it was about one and a half feet long with

-

fins on the end. Sources thought from the description that John gave, that

he was talking about a mortar projectile or some kind of small rocket.

When Sources left the bar at 0430 hours, they waited for John outside the

bar, but he did not come out. They then proceeded through the parking lot

where their jeeps were parked to their hotel across from the Lord Nelson.

At 0515 houss, Margulies looked out of his hotel window and saw John leave

the Lord Nelson. John proceeded directly to the jeeps in the parking lot
