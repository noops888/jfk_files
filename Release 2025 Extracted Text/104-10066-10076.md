MEMO FOR FILE

SUBJECT C :

OTS (late TSD) and Jim McCord's Cuban Activities

1 Ben Colling phoned to say that one of the fellow in jail

is still around, and after he got out he inquired around and got no

indication that McCord was ever involved. None of the other OTS people

have any recollection of McCord's involvement.

2o. I said that I was sure that the nan tho was rolled up

night not have any idea of MeCord's involvement, if indeed he was

involved. If McCord's involvelement was merely headquarters planniis

and no releasing operation was ever undertaken his role might never

suriace. However, we had been told that planning did involve TSD

people at the time, along with."

ecurity. For instance, I knew that

the Security man with TSD at the time had a job of hand-holding with

the families of the thre men; there may be some ISD record of that.

which would lead to someone who would know.

3o Colling was pulled out of a staff meeting to talk to me ard

said he would call back later.

MEMORANDUM FOR: DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE

SUBJECT

Summary OilSTaCALADE- Audio Operation

Against the New China News Agency in Heyana

In May 1959, the New China News Agency (NGNA) opened

an office in Hayana in the El Medico Building which is occupied

partly. by business concerns and partly used for residential apa-tr

ments.

Shortly thereafter, the Havana Station obtained the con

currence of Ambassador Bonsal and Miss Garolyn O, Stacey, 2n

Embassy employee, to mount an audio operatic against NGNA through

the wall of the adjacent apartment in which Miss Stacey lived. " In

November 1959, the FE Division sent one case officer and one ISD

teconician to Havana, and the installation of a miczophone and tape

recorder was completed in Miss Stacey's apartment on 29 November

1959.

By June 1960, it had become evident that two other rooms

occupied by NeNA possibly housed communication equipment aac

were used for conferences.* At that time Bryal vills, FE Division

case officer, went to fiarana and explored the possibility of improving

the operation, Hé managed to lease an sparimani directly over the

NONA office, and arranged for a stay-behiza agent to occupy this space.

: З.

In August 1950, a tearn of three ISD techniciaas who were

in Havaza on 2 separate SR Division operation agreed to install the.

additional equipment required for the NCNA operation. A second FE

Division case officer, Pobert Neet, came dova to Havana; and be,

together with the technicians, installed & probe microphone and tape

recorder in the apartment obtained by Milla] over the NONA office.

About this time the equipment was reroved from Miss Stacay'a

apartment, with the exception of the plastic probe which was laft

in the wall and plastered over.

4. As an additional security precaution to provida a safe

baven, and after consultation with the Acting Chief of Station, a key

to an apartment in the same building leased by Mrs. Majorie

Lennox, an Imbassy secretary, was cotained, Mes. Lannox was

told that access to her apartment was nesded for photographic

surveillance pusposes.

5. The Station was then faced with the probability that time

and security would work against holding indefinitaly the lease to

the apartment over NCNA since the owners of the building were

cancelling sub-lessors' contracts and recalling leases.

It was,

therefore, decided to install transmitters and switches in order to

permit continued monitoring of the target from a distant listening

post.- Another three-man team of TSD technicians consisting of

David I, Christ falias Carswell), Walter E. Szuminski (alias

Taransky) and Thornton J. Anderson falias Danbrunt, documented

as tourists had been sent to Havana to install audio equipmert in the

Chinese Natioralist Embassy bejore it was due to be turned over to

the Chinese Commuaits.. This operation aborted,. This team was

then sent to work on the installation of the transmitters in the apart-

ment over the NCNA oifice.

6. At 2400 hours on l4 September, Christ, Who with the

other technicians was working in the target apartment, failed to keep

a scheduled appointment with Nest.

At D100 hours on the l5th of

September, the apartment of Mas. Leno: was entered into and

searched by Cuban authorities, and she was iaken inio custody. At

1540 hours on 15 September, Neat, the stay-beriod agent and his wife:

were picked up by the Cuban authoricies and detained.

As of today the agent remains in the custody of the Cuban

His wife las been released and is still in Havana. Neet

was aleased 1715 hours lo September and has subsequently returzed.

to Washingion where he is being debriefed. Mrs. Lannox was

subsequently relaased and has also returned to Washingion where she

is being debriafed, The three TSD technicians remain in confinement

They have been saen in confinement out not contacted by an Embassy

officer whan ha first attempted to secure the galeasa of Mrs. Lennox.

Christ was last seen by Neet when they were jointly interrogated

che morning of 15 September,

At that time Christ did not appear

to hava been maltreated.

8.

According to articies in the Cuban papers the three

tachnicians were arrested while in the apartment over the NGNA

oifice and completing the installation of the equipment, The

press article adds that the key to Mis.. Lemox's apartment was

found on one of the technicians who identified the apartment to

which it belonged. All Cuban press releasas have referred to the

men by alias and.have nos. identified them as Government or Agency

employees. It is unclear at present what story had been agreed

upon by the technicians and station persomel to be used in the eveat

they were caught. (While being interrogated with Neet, Christ

indicated that Neet was his boss,

and Neet consistently denied any

inowledge as to why he was being bald,): The sub-lease for the ret

apartment in which the men were caught is in the name of the stay-

banind agert with the original lease being in the name of fills] the

FI Division Case Officer.

9. Initial information indicated that the thraa techniciars would

be charged with espionage "'againsi the people of China"... Subsequent

press releases have been unclear on this point. An atterapt by Consul

Hugh Kessler to contect the three men at 1730 hours on 17 September

was unsuccessful.. He was not permitted to see them but was tola

they were in custody.

10. The three technicians travelled to Cuba as tourists under

vasy light commarcial cover, two of them working for a company in

Naw York and the third, one in Baltimore," In each case the cover

company consists of a telaphone answering sestice and a name on the

door. Telephone messages and ¿nail are picked p periodically by aa

Agency contract employes. The men were provided with this cover

as well as uncackstopped come addresses for use when entering or

leaving Cuba as tourisis since the filling out of the landing card

requires this information. Subsequent to their detantion the home

addresses have been partially backstopped so that inquiries will

indicate that someone with this alias name had lived in the apartment

house in question. Insoíar as the cover companies are concerned,

eiforts are being made to provide a backstop to withstand inquiries

from the press shouid the Cubans rereal this incormation. In view

11. A cleared and vitting law firm in Nay Josk has been briefed

by Mr. L. Houston on the situation with the bought thas inquiries.
