Subject has performed in a manner quit 2e

Stand it

consistent with his long and broad ex-

perience in many aspects of the craft of intelligence, His senior grade, his special

expertise in the field of propaganda and publication and his very high intellect

have contributed to the division's operations in the public media field a sharp

focus, an economical concentration of money and effort and a consequently

heightened impact.

In the WUHUSTLER project, Subject vindicated his faith in

a moribund clandestine

asset by demonstrating, after about a year and a half under

his personal direction, that it is one of the most effective activities of its kind.

Before Subject assumed direct responsibility for this project, it had suffered from

visionary and diffuse direction and from poor case officer-agent rapport. Subject's

personal handling of this operation is marked by excellent rapport and the project

prospers on an entirely reoriented basis which the agent himself enthusiastically

welcomes.

Subject's supervisory responsibility has extended over two secretaries, from one

to two professional staffers under official cover and three professional career

employees under unofficial cover.

The fairness and precision of his management

has patently won their respect and inspired their performance.

Section C (Continued)

Special mention should be made of Subject's objectivity and integrity in

carrying out his responsibilities. These were best demonstrated when

he promptly and swiftly terminated a large and effective radio broadcast-

ing project, to establish which he and his subordinates had labored hard,

immediately upon belated discovery that insuperable, practical obstacles

precluded realization of the project's theoretical potential.

Subject's professional background has attuned his constant attention to

FI operational opportunities arising in the course of his current CA

activities, a practice consistent with his habit of seeking maximum benefit.

for every dollar spent in time, effort or cash.
