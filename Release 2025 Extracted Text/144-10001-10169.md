ALERT IN ORIENTE PROVINCE BELIEVED TO BE TERMINATED

The alert in Oriente Province (see 2/0/CUN/R196-63) is be-

Lieved to be terminated.

The alert, apparently prompted by

President KENNEDY's death on 22 November, was possibly pre-

scheduled to terminate on 25 November.

There have been two orders

which suggest that the alert was destined to be concluded on

25 November; they are:

1)

Access to the Coastal Observation Post at Punta

Maisi (20-15N 74-09W) was restricted until 25 November because

of the alert (see 2/QS /CUN/R667-63) ; and

2) Subordinates of Banes, Headquarters Eastern Naval

District, were to receive further orders on the 25th, presumably

concerning their alert status (2/0/CUN/R196-63); no such orders

have been

noted in communications.

There have been no further references in intercepted communi-

cations to the alert since 0222Z on 23 November (2/QS/CUN/R667-63) •

It is possible that the restricted access to the Observation

Post at Punta Maisi extends to other Observation Posts in Oriente

Province such as reported on 23 November when First Army Coastal

Observation Posts were placed in an alert status

(2/LR1/CUM/R188-63), and that the restriction was to be lifted on

25 November by all those posts.

Further indication that the alert has terminated is the fact

that the Cuban Navy was engaged in an island-wide communications

exercise on 25 November.

It is considered unlikely that such an

exercise would be conducted under alert conditions.

There have been no further references to the alert status

of the (D percent Santiago de Cuba) units which was first ob-

period, 22-26 November 1963.
