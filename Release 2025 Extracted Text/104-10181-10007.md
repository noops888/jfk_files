Contact Report on ilexander SaliO, on 28 July 1970.

1.

2

On the morning of 28 july, i called Sam to checi in with him

away on toy for alrost 6 weeks.

te sounded a bit

not being contacted.during this period, so I dashed

out to his Hollywood home to explain what had happened and set

him at ease:

He is row

He told

4:

5.

6:.

Castro agents were, also

"watching" him on the day he was in Barcelona and on the short

layover his Pan im plane had in Lisbon on his way home. At no

came, rowever, was he molested by these "agents."

•The Castro surveillance continued -so San says- in Hollywood.

"About the second night after I got home,"

c. 14-15 June, a car

parked across the street and a little to

che rear of his house

"after it got dark."

then Sam got into his car and went to the

gas station,

the car-described as looking lika

a white Volisragen,

without headlights on- followed Sam's car on his short trio in

the neighborhood and back to his home.

He could not make out

the physical description of the driver of the viv.

He-has never

seen this car again.

The only other suspicious irdividual near his home,

was "a tall,

thin man,"

(described as:about 5-11 to 6 ft and 170 lbs; black

hair: no distinguishing features visite;

once wearing slacks and

white shirt, another time wearing a

suit).

This individual showed

up across the street from his home

"just

as the sun had gone cown,

several evenings during the first week that I got home."

(c. 14-19

üune)

The man just walked past the front back and forth a few times

and appeared to have his car around the co-nes of Sam's house.

He

could not identify the car or anything else aboui the mar..

• again,

during the first weer after his retuin Sam received several

ciephone calls where no one wouid answer when the phone was picked

or the person calling would say,

has not experienced any othe: suspicious incidents after the first

week home from Spain.

these incidents with fear, büt rather:in the vein of a paperbaci

detective story.

Sam would not admit that he enjoyed himself somewhat in Madrid as

a tourist, although he did not deny that he stayed in a luxury hoter,

ate as well as drank well, saw the sites and even went to a nirit

club,

all on the house.

i went so far as to say that is he had

"Known'it was going to be like

this,

¡ never would have gane."

in the same breath, he toid "'illian" that he would be back in

"but, only to help sy country." (with "patriots" lixe sar, how

can se iose.)

San is most anxious to start some correspondence to "'illiam."

He say's

•willian" asted him to send hi- some photos of cage kennedy

some snoked shrimp.

Sam wants to ¡no if we want to supply

hin with

photos of

the Cape that he can send.

Sam states he wiil

write anything

we wish.

I promised to check out the status of the

case with my office and Madrid to see what course of action they

deen should be initiated.

dodesty not being ore 05 his greatest virtues Sam rambled ard

rarbied about the

"secrets" he got out of "filliam" and passed

07 to the radrid

c/o.

I went along with him and complimented him

on

job well done; which is: true.

Jut, he was not satisfied with

ny plaudits, he wanted to know

"what ashington said?"

To which I

said,

"everyone, washington, sadrid and diami thought you did an

excellent. job and we are most grateful for your cooperation.". He

liked that very much; you could see it in the smile on his sace.

He tries to make it sound like it was a great ordeal and sacrifica

lie spent another three hours

rehearsing his cover story, reviewing the objectives and

trying to anticipate questions. AMAUTO-l might ask during

their neeting together. SAlKo was given the following objectives:

The foremost öbjective was for SAMKO

to renew and improve upon his relationship with

AlHUTO-l, to the extent that they would be able

to reminisce,

over a prolonged period, about the

relationship

that existed before AMAUTO-l's departure

from the United States.

b.

To exchange addresses and telephone

numbers for the purpose of sending occasional

greetings to one another.

C..

To Invite AMAUTO-1 (and his wife, 1f

necessary) to dinner, at his expense.

d.

To ascertain AMAUTO-l's. future plans.

To assess ANAUTO-l's feelings toward

the United States and toward his own government.

1.

For SAMKO to talk favorably about the

United Stätes using himself as an example, (the

son of immigrant parents who made good in

business);

to emphasize the opportunities available to anyone

with

imagination, ambition and aggressiveness:

If the opportunity presented itself,

to show sympathy for

the apparent failure of

the

Cuban Government to reach

the 10 million ton

sugar goal and to ask whether the non-fulfillment

of this goal would

adversely affect the economic

development

of Cuba.

It was our hope that some-

time during the conversation AMAUTO-1 would

volunteer

to discuss his country's cconomic

situation which might have opened the conversation

to further exploitation by SAMKO.

h.

parallel with objective e. above,

SAMKO

was instructed to ask (provided an appropriate opening

appeared in the conversation) AlAUTO-l for his

personal

comments on the Vietnam Issue and anti-war

demonstrations in the United States and abroad.

We

were trying to draw out AJAUTO-l's personal analysis

of the U.S. position vis-a-vis the war in Vietnam

and to compare his

statements with the Cuban Governnent

position.

3.

Alchough, SAMKO was determined to see A!MUTO-1 even

if he had

to canp

outside AJALTO-l's home, we

reminded him

that because of

ALAUTO-l's position,

he might

refuse to see

SAUKO in his home, but that SANkO should not hesitate to

Under separate

cover for C/WHD and COS, Miami we are forwardiny photographs

taken during the initial meeting between Sauko and AllUTO-1.

The pictures were taken from the home of one of our staffers.

We believe they highlight the events leading to the reunion

of these two old friends. The: following is a description

of each photo:

PHOTO A:

SANKo arrives at AsAUTO-l's home at 1150 hours,

31 May. 1970.

(Although not shown,

KENTLAND

and SACODER were monitoring AYAUTO-l's home

from 0900 hours on 31 May so that, in the

event ASAUTO-1 decided to leave before SAMKO's

arrival, re could instruct: SAlFO by phone to

delaj his departure.)

B: After trying to enter via the front gate,

SANKO called to one of the children who was

playing in the front jard.

The child told

him to go to the garage entrance. SAMKO

walks toward that entrance.

C:

The boy apparently called for someone in the

house.

A maid, not shown in this photo,

but

who can be seen in photo L,

came out and

approached SAUKO.

In his halting Spanish,

SANKO said he wanted to see "el Senor"'

The maid said he wasn't in.

He explained to

the maid that it was

"very importante" to

see the Senor.

By this time another maid

appeared, shown in this photo, and she gets

into the

act.

She repeats that el Senor is

not in. SAMKO, sensing he wasn't getting

anywhere, changed his tactics and asked to

see "la senora".

The maids went into indivi

dual monologues, but SANKO could not understand

what they were sajing.

Finally, SAUKO produced

a note, which he was asked to prepare, and

handed

it: to the maid in this photo.

SAMKO

repeated that it was "very importante to see

el Senor."

D:

house.

During the conversation in AMAUTO-l's home, SAMKO

began his deliberate softening of AMAUTO-l with such comments

as "you know Bill, Julio was jealous of you because I treated

you like a brother:

I didn't want you to return to Cuba, but

I couldn't stop you.

We were all in favor of Castro."

Bill

admitted here that SANKO was a good friend and enjoyed his job

and the pay was g00d;

but added that "I had to go.

I was in

the States

illegally."

SAMKO added "you know, Bill, I never

was blessed with any children; you were like a son to me, but

when I heard you died in the mountains in Cuba,. I blamed myself

or letting you ro."

Bill replied that he was

wounded on his

left side.

SAMKO explained that if AMAUTO-1 was in the States

illegally, SANKO could have arranged for him to remain in the

States by getting assistance from some police and detective

friends in Florida.

SANKO repeated his delight to again see

AMAUTO-1 and how happy he was to know he is alive.

Moments after entering the house, AMAUTO-1 invited

him to have breakfast.

SANKO refused, but settled for a beer.

to ask the cover questions,

questions: what are you doing here? and How did you get our

SAMKO embellished the

story to his satisfaction.. He also shed

a few. tears when he

repeated the story of his wife's death and the doctor's

recommendation that he take a vacation.

He continued his

softening approach of ANAUTO-1 by adding:

"Bill, when my wife

took ill some years ago, she asked me to divest myself of all

business interests, but

if you were there with me, Bill, you

which has an underground garage.

SANKO was visibly excited and

was enjoying the "cloak and dagger" role, but he was nervous.

He was highly impressed with the garage entrance to the safe-

house and commended us for being so shrewd and security conscious.

He wanted to know whose apartment it was and SACODER said that

it was his private "pad".

comment was: "you sure live it up

well."

As PACHANKIS aptly explained in one of his reports,

He was highly excited during the

meeting because he was asked to leave the hotel room.

the reservation was made for four days, he was asked to leave.

He pleaded

with SACODER to do something to keep him in the hotel

room

losing the opportunity to lunch with AMAUTO-1

because AMAUTO-1 was to call hin at the hotel on Saturday,

6 June.

SACODER admitted the error but added that there

a simple solution if he could not convince the hotel manage-

ment to allow him. to stay a few more days.

SACODER suggested

that he should explain to the manager that l) his laundry had

not yet returned and 2) he was expecting an important phone

call on Saturday and that there was no way of

getting in touch

with the caller.

Failing this, SACODER offered another simple

solution.

Since SAMKO and AMAUTO-1 had not jet exchanged

addresses,

SANKO could return to the ANAUTO-1 home and give

the maid a

note advising AMAUTO-1 that he had to change hotels.

that he told AMAUTO-1 about the possibility of

having to leave the hotel because his reservation ended soon.)

SAMKO did not at first accept this logic, but SACODER explained

that he (SACODER) could not plead with the hotel management

on SANKO's behali.

This was poor security.

SANKO accepted

this

and after a glass of scotch and water

amitted that the

solution was indeed simple, but he was terribly excited at first.

Throughout the debricfing SAMKO revealed the following:

he was born in pertil Amboy, New Jersey on 2 November 1907 to

Polish parents.

At the age of 14-15 he worked as a construction

hand on a bridge being built in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania.

(It is interesting to note SAMKO's reaction

here to ANAUTO-l's statement. When SAMKO

first visited ANAUTO-I on 31 May, he was

certain that under the facade of

being a

devoted revolutionary ANAUTO-l was indeed a

capitalist at heart, but at this meeting

SAMKO modified his comment by adding that

it appears ANAUTO-1 is truly a communist,

who maintains strong convictions of the

righteousness of the revolution.

The above

comments by AMAUTO-1 produced the peg on

which SAMKO could have questioned the veracity

of AMAUTO-l's statement on freeing the

oppressed,

but he was not specifically

instructed to maintain a polemic argument

on the rights and wrongs of the revolution

because we

felt this objective was secondary

to the re-establishment

of a relationship

between

these two old friends,

A future

meeting might include the

exchange of'an

objective

appraisal of the revolution as

seen by SAMKO.)

ANAUTO-1 proposed that SAMKO act as an

intermediary for the sale of Cuban sea food

in the United States.

He explained that

the Cubans have a large fishing fleet in

tle Canary Islands.

The fish caught is

processed in the Canary Islands and can be

shipped to the United States as a product

of Spain, not of Cuba.

AIAUTO-1 added,

"SAUKO,

you're like a father to me, please

think about it (the agency)?

ANIUTO-1

explained that SANKO could earn about $200,000

• year in commission

based on sales

$2,000,000.

SAMKO

said he

would think about

it, but privately to SACODER he said

that

he had no intention

to disturb his retirement

with a fishy business.

SANKO restated that "Bill, you have a

They exchanged addresses.

SAMKO had

printed his

address, but AJAUTO-I asked

him to write it on another piece of

paper.

AJAUTO-1 reasoned that he wanted

it written to understand it better, but we

believe! he will use the sample to compare

it with letters SAMKO might send in the

future.. They promised to write to each

other.

SANKO WaS given AJAUTO-l's private

address, not that of the embassy.

G.

AMAUTO-1 regretted that SAMKO had to

leave so soon because he would have

enjoyed showing SANKO the Spanish

interior.

SAUKO said he might consider

returning near the end of 1970, but

ANAUTO-I did not say whether he would

be in Spain in late 1970.

AMAUTO-1 said he was suspicious when

he first saw SANKO noting that the nature

and importance of his position make him

act suspicious, but the suspicion soon

dissipated - so he said.

Accomplishments: We feel the objectives programmed

and rehearsed were successfully fulfilled, perhaps far greater

than our own expectations.

Unless we are misjudging the shrewd-

ness of ANAUTO-l through our own naivete, we believe the

relationship was sinccrely re-established and a channel opened

for future use by AMAUTO-1 should he desire to

use this channel

other than to maintain a friendly correspondence.

It was un-

fortunate that his Barcelona trip interfered possibly to the

point of SANKO having one or two additional meetings with AMAUTO-1

nonetheless, in the six plus hours together, SANKO admirably

fulfilled

our requirements and couragcously maintained the

fiction of his visit to Spain.

We believe too, that although

AJAUTO-1 appears to be solidly in favor of the Cuban regime,

he did

not

criticize the United States which we feel he might

have done had he suspected that SANKO's visit to Madrid was

sponsored by the

U.S. Government.

QUT IMID periodicalls has reported contact between

Subject and Guiliermo

the Cuban Minister

in Madrid, mostly over the telephone but also indicating

that he has seen her personally.

It would appear that he

has taken unusually strong interest in her; constring the

number of other more demanding tasks he claims to have.

Until now, we have not been able to identify cither Subject

or her relationship with RUIZ.

On 28 May QUDOZE (a sensitive joint audio penetration

with liaison) reported the following memorandum (presumably

to Havana) on Subject as dictated by RUIZ:

"Si. RUIZ Ojeda.

Sone months ago we received

a ciphered cable dealing with Aica Rosa CORREN Felipe

asking that we contact her to determine her situation.

At that time we informed you that said Aida Rosa CORREA,

Today we intervlewed Aida Rosa CORREA and her

son,

who at all timos has maintained a positive

attitude toward this Embassy concerning her

return.

He have let her know that given the

circumstances o? her presence in Spain - not. as

a 'gusano':, but is the wife of a foreign doctor

who has worked in our country - we saw no

difficulty to prevent her fron returning, especially

taking into account the fact that she expressed

herself as a revolutionary,

but that first we

had to receive official permission.

"In our opinion, because the situation in

which she finds herself in Spain because of

marriage to a foretner, her

return can be

authorized, based on what has expired."
