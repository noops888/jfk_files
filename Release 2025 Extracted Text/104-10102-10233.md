The Station copies of the original reports on SZULC have

been destroyed.

I attach, however, a memorandun consisting of

selected entries from his card.

20.

• All the information 1s from the same source, a Polish emigre

who knew SZULC personally and also had Informants in the Polish Embassy.

3.

There is little doubt that SZULO was pro-comunist at the time,

and that he co-operated with Ignacy SACHS, a cousin who was employed

by the Press Section of the Polish Embassy, and provided him with

"Information".: It would, however, be unwise. to jump to the conclusion

that this collaboration took the forn of espionage, since SZUiCe does

i not seem to have made any secret of the relationship.

40...

I can find no evidence that Ignacy SACHS was an intelligence

officer, but he seems to have been an active propagandist.

he returned

to Poland In 1954. A report from the same source, dated June 1956,

stated that he then occupied the Brazilian desk at the Polish Institute

for International Affairs.
