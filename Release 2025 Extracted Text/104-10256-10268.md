Five men were arrested by the Washington Metropolitan

Police at 2:10 a.m. on 17 June 1972, after having been

discovered breaking into the Democratic National Fiead-

quarters at the Watergate in Washington, D.C. The five

men had cameras and rather sophisticated bugging equip-

ment. Although the suspects initially used aliases during

the police interrogation, they were identified as Messrs.

James Walter McCord, JI.; Bernard L. Barker; Frank

Anthony Sturgis; Eugenio Rolando Martinez Careaga; and

Virgilio Ramon Gonzales-Rosabel. The Watergate incident

has continued to receive extensive publicity, and there is

suspicion that. a sixth person was directly involved in the

illegal entry.
