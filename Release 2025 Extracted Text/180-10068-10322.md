Assassination Records Review Board

Final Determination Notification

AGENCY

: HSCA

RECORD NUMBER

: 180-10068-10322

RECORD SERIES

: STAFF PAYROLL RECORDS

AGENCY FILE NUMBER

December 8, 1995

Status of Document:

Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 14

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors

including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United

States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 5

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could

reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of

privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

Substitute Language: SSN

Date of Next Review: 2017

Board Review Completed: 10/24/95

Next, I was assigned to Harrisburg to cover the State

Legislature for a year and a half, worked on a team investigating

political payoffs and contributions . Then became "idea

man"

for about a year. My best idea was to go to Europe and cover

the American troops during peacetime. Then I asked for and got

an assignment to Vietnam where I wrote a series of articles just

as the United States was getting heavily involved. Also wrote

a series about the peace-keeping forces in cyprus

Assigned as an

assistant city editor to the copy desk,

filling in as deputy city editor. Headed a Bulletin investigative

reporting team that "broke" the FHA scandal in Philadelphia and

resulted in a federal grand jury.

Was sent to a city editor's seminar at American Press

Institute, then at Columbia University, and a short while later.

was appointed deputy city editori in charge of assigning most

news stories. In that capacity I also helped train young writers

and reporters. Then assigned to the national desk, which handles

washington, national and internatiohhnewsk started a weekly

column called World in Conflict.

Outside the Bulletin, I did some freelance work. Most

notably I was Philadelphia area correspondent for Time and

Fortune in 1957, worked part time at the N. X. Daily News in

1968, wrote a number of articles for Philadelphia magainze.

Honors

Dear Dick:

I've been

following the progress of the House Select

Committee on

Assassinations and its chief counsel as

well

newspaper and

wire

service stories permit.

I gather, at least from a Newhouse News Service report,

that the committee unanimously has agreed to support your

request for a staff of 170 but that the actual funding will not

follow until after January 1.

If that's the

case, and you can use me now, I'd like

to come to Washington

and get involved as early as possible.

I think I can be more effective in the role of press

liaison officer if I arrive on the scene before the great

bulk of the staff.

I have received a formal letter from Bulletin management

confirming an extended leave of absence. But this does not

preclude a short-term leave. Even if Congress ultimately

refuses to fund the investigations

fully and they are cut

short, I feel I could return to the Bulletin without loss

of face or funds. The experience of working for even a few

weeks or months with the committee would be worth the effort.

Also, even though I would

move to Washington immediately,

Shirley and Sharon would remain

in Philadelphia to June

30.

I , therefore, would not get involved with a long-term e lease

until the summer. So, if the investigations are terminated

early, there would be little financial hardship on my part.

I understand that you are extremely busy at this point,

preparing a budget and interviewing prospective staff members.

But I would appreciate a call at your convenience.

I am somewhat anxious since several of the AP stories

mention

"a spokesman

for Sprague."

I recall that you mentioned

a temporary press

secretary, aide to Rep. Thomas N. Downing.

My concern

is

that

he may become

permanent.

Dear

Dick:

Here

is my resume.

I'm

also happy to tell you that The Bulletin has granted

me an extended leave of absence. In fact, management, I am told,

was "thrilled" with the idea.

The

leave was granted in record time. This was a surprise.

I thought it would take weeks of negotiation. That's why f

went ahead and requested it now

instead of waiting.

Of course, I explained in writing to The Bulletin that

if for some reason the House does

not provide sufficient funds

for the dual investigation, the deal

is off.

Now that the Bulletin has been apprised of the situation,

I feel very little notice is required. This means I could start

as your press secretary soon after things are worked out with

the House committee.

I hope that is soon. I am anxious to get involved as

early as possible.

Meanwhile, I'm reading extensively in the kennedy-king

literature. I'm also meeting with an old friend,

the press

officer for the Federal Energy Administration here, to get

some ideas about dealing with the media from the other side

of the fence.

I will be in Washington, Monday and Tuesday, Nov.
