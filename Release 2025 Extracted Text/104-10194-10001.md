and about 190 in weight.

He wants that

And he has about reached the end of tha line

two children. lie does not mind the sedentary aspects of Project Detail - I

Subject has continued to demonstrate a very

ih level of

interest

and comperence in his work.

Beyond the

relatively. technical

aspect. of producing transcriptions, which hé!docomplishes wich time-

liness,

accuracy and thoroughness, he strives to provide the Station

and Headquarters with an insight in depth on the local Soviet com-

plement.

He does this capably, particularly when one understands

the limitations of his technical access.

His wifo, a contract em-

ployee, assists him in the preparation of the technical product.

However, her over-all contribution goes beyond this, since Subject

and his wife work cogether in effort to distill the meaning of cheir

product interms of personality assessment. They are uniquely well

adjusted to their deep cover circumstances, are of little burden

administratively to the Station, and are presently interested in

continuing their assignment in Mexico City indefinitely.

MEMORANDUM FOR: SEA

SUBJECT

: Retirement Planning

Mites D

1. The established policy of the Agency favors carly retirement of

its employees who, as you know, are normally expected to retire when

they become eligible for a full annuity. The prospect of retirement

deserves serious thought and planning, and you should therefore know

that you will be eligible for retirement, according to our records,

during November, 1970.

2. Planning ahead can bring about, with each passing year, definite

progress toward.your.retirement goals.

The Agency is anxious to assist

you in planning for your retirement.

It is even more important, as an

employee, that you begin now to plan for this occasion.

You deserve to know as much as possible about the general subject

of retirement and more specifically about the retirement policy itself,

your annuity, life and health insurance protection, opportunities for other

employment, Social Security benefits, and educational materials available

on the subject. The Agency feels that this type of information and advisory

service should be made available to you at least five years prior to the date

of your eligibility.

4. You are requested to call the Executive Secretary of the Board,

Mr. Howard G. Phillips,

on extension 6972 to arrange an appropriate time

to discuss any plans you may have and benefits available to you upon

retirement.
