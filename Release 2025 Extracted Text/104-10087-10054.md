ANNEX B

THE 201 SYSTEM

d for identifying a person of specific in-

information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying

subjects of 201 files from various categories of information about them and for

producing lisits of 201 personalities according to those categories. Only a rela-

tively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify

opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and

CI investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi-

zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a volume of corre-

spondence has accumulated.

2. THE 201 SYSTEM

The principal features of the 201 system are:

a. The 201 Number: a unique number, i.e., 201-1234567, assigned to each

individual in the system to serve as identifying file number for reporting on that

individual.

b. The 201 Dossier: the official file confaiming the 201 opening form (Form

831) and all biographic sponting on and referent

do the individual, i.e., per-

sonal history, current sites, and prospecte

a 201 file. This record produc

stores the pertinent information which may later be retrieved for special listings

d. Main Index Master 201 Reference: this reference, printed in reply to an

Index Search Request, is printed

as illustrated below. When data are absent

within the record, succeeding data items or lines will be moved up and the ref-

erence consolidated.

paragraph 3b below) by filling in Box 13 or a code may be assigned or added

at a later date by a Form 831 amendment.

The 201 system has the capability of producing machine listings of 201

personalities by OI codes. For example, if an OI code has been opened for the

security service of a certain country a listing may be compiled of all members

of that service.

These selection criteria may be used singly or in combinations. For example,

a user could obtain a list of all 201 personalities who have been assigned the

OI code of XX or codes of XX, XY, or XZ. A 201 personality list could also be

produced of all persons who were born in Germany between the years 1915

and. 1920, with the occupation computer specialist, who are now citizens of the

United States, located in Mexico, and who had been assigned the OI code AA.

Note however that the listing would contain only those personalities with an

Ol code AA. Those personalities with an OI code other. than AA and those

with no OI code would be excluded. The requester could however ask that

persons who have not been assigned an Ol code also be included. Note also

that when retrieving lists based on occupation, the listing will be only as specific

as the occupation code (Attachment 1). The occupation code for a courier

covers only a documented courier. Some occupation codes cover more than one

occupation. For example, the occupation code CRAF covers those who practice

some trade or manual occupation, i.e., carpenters; bricklayers painters, mechanics

and electricians. If a list is requested for electricians, nata

ties indexed by the CS are of active operational interest at any given

point in time. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and

Cl investigation, prospective agents and sources, and members of

groups and organizations of continuing target interest. Each of these

personalities is assigned either a 201 number or an IDN number.

2. The 201 number serves a dual purpose. It brings the files on

these personalities into the CS records system. A single number,

e.g., 201-123456, is assigned to each person, and a dossier controlled

by this number is established which contains, or has cross referenced

to it, all of the reporting on the individual's personal history, current

status and prospects. Once the 201 number is assigned, it is used in

future reporting on the individual both as a file number and in place of

other identifying data. Up-to-date machine listings are published

These are relabeled "201" if a file is opened. IDN numbers are car-

umn. IDN numbers are not CS file numbers.

5. All 201 code numbers are assigned by RID at headquarters,

either upon receipt of Form 831, or of a field dispatch. If a dispatch

is written about a personality not yet in the system, a 201 number for
