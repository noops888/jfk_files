never failed to rally to the legal defense of the Communist

Party and individual members thereof, including known

Activities, United states

contains the following on Page 43

concerning

"Citizens Committee to Preserve American Freedoms":

party's front operations in the

Southern California District

"The (Communist today are * * * confined to four

major organizations," which include the Citizens Committee to

Preserve American Freedoms.

"The Citizens Committee to Preserve

American Freedoms

* * * specializes in propaganda aimed at abolishing the Committee

on Un-American Activities and discrediting the Federal Bureau of

Investigation.

Created in Los Angeles in 1952, the front

organization is run by Frank Wilkinson, an identified Communist

who recently resumed the full-time, paid post of executive

secretary after approximately a year's leave of absence to assist

in a similar campaign by another front in New York City, the

Emergency Civil Liberties Committee.

"When the Committee on Un-American Activities held

hearings in Los Angeles

September 2-5, 1958, to inquire into

the nature of the party's recent reorganization in California,

the Citizens Committee

to Preserve American Freedoms sponsored

a series of public meetings to protest the hearings and the

very existence of the committee. Communists subpenaed as wit-

nesses were guests of honor.

"At this time, leaders of the party's Southern

California District were mobilizing Communists in the area for

participation in an intensified campaign to abolish this

committee of Congress.

How the Citizens Committee to Preserve

American Freedoms served the party in this effort was revealed

by (Communist Party) District Chairman Dorothy Healey in a

report to the party's Southern California District Council on

September 21, 1958.

Mrs. Healey declared that the party preferre

public protest meetings to be held by the Citizens Committee to

Preserve American Freedoms rather than under party auspices because

Communists could attend without danger of being exposed as

members of the party.

She also noted that Communists scheduled

as congressional committee witnesses could not appear beforehand

at openly Communist rallies without creating the impression

that the party was conspiring with witnesses

to withhold informa-

tion from

the committee."

259 on the Southern California District of the

Communist Party, April 3, 1959, pp. 7 and 8.)

CITIZENS COMMITTEE TO PRESERVE AMERICAN FREEDOMS

The Guide to Subversive Organizations and Publications,

revised and published December 1, 1961, prepared and released

by the Committee on Un-American Activities, United States

House of Representatives,

contains the following on Page 43

concerning

"Citizens Committee to Preserve American Freedoms":

1.

"Ihe (Communist) party's front operations in the

southern California District today are * * * confined to four

majer organizations, "

which include the Citizens Committee to

Preserve American Freedoms.

"The Citizens Committee to Preserve American Freedoms

* * * specializes in propaganda

aimed at abolishing the Committee

on Un-American Activities and discrediting the Federal Bureau of

Investigation. Created in Los Angeles In 1952, the front

organization 1s run by Frank Wilkinson, an Identified Communist

who recently

resumed the full-time, paid post of executive

secretary after approximately a year's leave of absence to assist

in a similar campaign by another front in New York City, the

Emergency Civil Liberties Committee.

"When the Committee on Un-American Activities held

hearings in Los Angeles September 2-5, 1958, to Inquire into the

nature of the party's recent reorganization in California,

the Citizens Committee

to Preserve American Freedems sponsored

a series of public meetings to protest the hearings and the very

existence of the committee. Communists subpoenaed as witnesses

were guests of honor.

"At this time, leaders of the party's Southern California

District were mobilizing Communists in the area for participation

in an intensified campaign to abolish this committee of Congress.

How the Citizens Committee te Preserve American Freedoms served the

party in this effort was revealed by (Communist Party) District

Chairman Dorothy Healey in a report to the party's Southern Californi:

District Council on September 21, 1958. Mrs. HEALEY declared that th

party preferred public protest meetings to be held by the Citizens

Committee to Preserve American Freedoms

rather than under party

auspices because Communists could attend without danger of being

exposed as members of the party.

She also noted that Communists

scheduled as congressional committee witnesses could not appear

beforehand at openly Communist rallies without creating the 1m-

pression that the party was conspiring with witnesses to withhold

information from the committee."

In the same issue the lead editorial in part described the

of our time and so find philosophical rapport with the life

as a standard and example,

in March 1964, this source advised that the newsletter was no

longer mimeographed by the "People's world" because of the

unreliability of the machine and, in addition, the name was

changed to "The Insurgent" upon recommendation of one of the

ciub officers who felt the new name sounded more militant.

Conmittee to End U. S. Foreign Aggression,

Committee to End American Intervention in

Viet-Nam (Ad Hoc),

Committee to End United States Intervention

in Viet-Nam (Ad Hoc?,

Committee to End United States Imperialism

This Committee was organized as the Committee to End

American Intervention in Viet-Nam (Ad Hoc), March 29, 1954, in

san Francisco, California, at the instigation of and

by members

of the w.E.B. DuBois Club

Francisco, a Marxist youth group,

which has promoted the organization's activities among the various

groups in the San Francisco area interested in peace and disarma-

ment.

Its announced

aims have included American withdrawal from

Viet-Nam, self-determination for the South Viet-Namese people and

adherence

of the United States to the 1954 Geneva Convention.

Demonstrations along

with the distribution of and exhibition of

propaganda comprise

its program.

A flyer advertising a forum of

September 15, 1964, in San Francisco on "World Wide Movements--

for Freedom"

referred to "Cuba - Harlem - Congo - Viet Nam" and

listed the Committee to End U. S.

Foreign Intervention as sponsor.

One of the two sources which provided the

information on the

Committee's organization has advised that it is the same committee.

According to this source,

on October 9, 1964, this Committee's

proDer name is "Committee

to End U. S.

Foreign Aggression," but it

is a loose-knit organization and exactness of title or name is of

little concern to the officials and members.

The other source

advised on June 28, 1964, that an Executive Committee of five

members was

elected in June, 1964, but no new officers were other-

wise elected.

Another source advised on September 17, 1964, that the

were JOHN ?. THOMAS, Chairman;

BEVERLY D.

RADCLIFFE, Treasurer, and MARGARET DRIGGS, Secretary. The

signature of two of these are still required for checks written.

One source mentioned above currently advises that no

headquarters is maintained by the Committee; meetings are infrequent

and poorly attended, ranging from eight to twenty members.

The last

reported membership total was approximately twenty in June.

A booklet published by the VDC contained the

by the general membership, June, 1965:

The Vietnam. Day Committee is a group of stucents,

taculty and other members

of the Bay area

community opposed to American intervention in

Vietnam, the Dominican Reputlic and wherever

else it

may occur.

revolutionary struggles

for self-determination are sweeping the world

American

suppression of these move-

nents, we believe: is immoral and a threat to

the peace of the world. The Vietnam Day

Committee is organizing non-violent direct

actions, teach-ins, door-to-door organizing

and other educational activities to oppose

American intervention.

We believe that the

struggle for self-determination in other

countries is related to the struggle for

democracy in America--a democracy in which the

people have the facts and the power to make

decisions for themselves. The struggles in

America against racism, poverty, and bureau-

cratic conformity are part of the

same move-

ment as the struggle against American militarism.

We must build

a New America and join with those

people in Asia, Africa and Latin America building

a New World.

The Guide to Subversive Organizations and Publications,

by the Committee on Un-American

Activities, United States

contains the following on Page 43

concerning "Citizans Committee to Preserve American Freedoms":

1.

"The (Communist) party's front operations in the

Southern California District today

are *** confined to four

major organizations, "which

include the Citizens Committee to

Preserve American Freedoms.

"The Citizens Committee to Preserve American Freedoms

* * * specializes in propaganda aimed

at abclishing the Committee

on Un-American Activities and discrediting the Federal Bureau of

Investigation.

Created in Los

Angeles in 1952, the front

organization is run by Frank Wilkinson, an identified Communist

who recently

resumed the full-time paid post of

executive

secretary after approximately a year's leave of absence to assist

in similar campaign by another front

in New York City, the

Emergency Civil Liberties Committee.

"When the Committee on Un-American Activities held

hearings in Los Angeles

September 2-5, 1958, to inquire into the

nature of the party's recent reorganization in California,

the Citizens Committee to Preserve American Freedoms sponsored

a series of public meetings to protest the hearings and the very

existence of the committee.

Communists subpoenaed as witnesses

were guests of honor.

"At this time, leaders of the party's Southern California

strict were mobilizing Communists in the area for particination

in an intensified campaign to abolish this committee of Congress.

How the Citizens Committee to Preserve American Freedoms served the

Party in this effort was revealed by (Conmunist Party) District

Chairman Dorothy Healey in a report to the Party's Southern

California District Council on September 21, 1958.

Mrs. HEALEY de-

clared that the party preferred public protest meetings to be held by

the Citizens Committee to Preserve American Freedoms rather than

She also noted that

Communists scheduled as congressional committee witnesses could not

appear beforehand at operly Communist rallies without creating the f

impression that the party was conspiring with witnesses to withhold

information from the committee."
