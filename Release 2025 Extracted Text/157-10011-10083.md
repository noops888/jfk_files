I was in the Cuban operations for nine years.

Between 1964 and 1973?

Yes.

And did you commute with some frequency to "'iami?

Run out of --

Europe. Some were run out of Miami but the big ones

were run out of Europe.

Q

well, in the course of your activities with respect

to Cuba did you have occasion to become familiar with the

operations of the Miami base?

A

Yes.

And the situation in the Cuban community in Miami?

A

Yes, sir.

During the nine years you were with DDO's Cuban

operations, who was -- who were the chiefs of the Miami

Station?

A I think in 1963 Ted Shackley was the Chief and he

was followed by -- I can't think of his name. I should know

it. Well, I will come back to that.

Then, the next Chief of Station was paml tende.

What years was he Chief?

A

I think

Paul

was there about a year and a half. lie

left in 1968 when we reduced the size of the Station. Let's

say Wenze was there from 1966 to 1968. And then Jake Esterline.

He was Chief of Station from 1968 to 1973.

Now, what was the

formal title of the group to which

you were assigned for the 9-year period?

Bay of Pigs?

well, not immediately. I think sometime around --

in the Bay of Pigs was in April. I think this was created in

September, something like that, 1961.

And that subsequently became the Special Activities

All right. Would that also be true of the Special

Right, except that at the present time the Station

has no Cuban operations.

I understand that. When were Cuban operations termi-

A

At the Station? Let's see.

Sternfield went down

there in 1972. It was during fiscal year '72. I think it was

in early 1973. It was a gradual reduction.

And have those operations been terminated entirely

of are they now run out of the Washington area?

All Cuban operations are run out of Washington.

Mr. Sturbitts, in the last couple of weeks you may

have seen some allegations in the press about possible assassina-

tion attempts that have been nounted or alleged assassination

attempts that have been mounted -

A

Right.

-- against Fidel Castro. In the course of your

activities with respect to Cuba, did you ever learn of any such

attempts?

A

Well, let me answer it this way. I wouldn't say

attempts. I know there was discussion. "Attempts" is too

strong a word.

Well, can you place in time your first knowledge of

any such discussions?

A

Well, the first knowledge I had of any discussions,

I was on IDY and this was October, November, 1963, with Fitzgeral

in Paris. And I knew that he was going to meet -- let me put

it another way. I had overheard that discussions were going on

with a member of Castro's military but that he wanted, as

A

This military guy that was in Fidel's -- I thin!:

at one time he was

comnandante. Now, I knew that was going

on.

I didn't participate in it because I was there for another

reason. And I know that subsequent to that time that Fitzgerald

met with him again and as I recall, as the personal lepresenta-

tive of the Attorney General, Bobby Kennedy.

I provided all those files. There are 19 volumes that

we gave to your people. But I don't know who was reviewing

them. I think Belin was going to do it himself.

Yes. He is. He is doing it himself.

You said there were 19 volumes of documents with

respect to this.

result of a Special Group decision.

Oh, no. These go back -- I know at one time, the

thing that comes to mind, I think he made a leaflet drop

over Cuba and this was subsequently reported in the press and

by the Bureau office in Miami.

Do you know who financed his activities?

A

I have no idea.

Is it possible that Mr. Sturgis' activities were

indirectly financed by the Agency through --

A

I don't see how. Frank Sturgis is a soldier of

fortune; has' been. He has constantly tried to associate himself

with the Agency. When I went through his file they wanted me

to classify the file and the way I classified it was "don't

destroy it, he is an intelligence nuisance."

Have you caused the Agency records with respect to

Yes. Ihave custody of them.

And what is the volume of that material?

A

As I recall, there are five volumes.

Your Committee

called for them the other day after the article in the paper,

I guess it was last Saturday. They called for them Monday and

they returned them

Monday afternoon.

Do you know who

examined those files?

A

No, I don't.

You indicated a moment ago that Mr. Sturgis contacts

the DCD öffice in Miami with some frequency, is that correct?

A

Well, not great frequency but he does with tidbits

of so-called information.

Is this information limited to narcotics, alleged

narcotics traffic?

No manner.

Do they have any -- do they periodically seet to

collect information from Me. Sturgis?

A

I can't speak to that but the records that we have

don't reflect anything like that. Before they would contact

somebody in that context, inowing that there is a 201 file

on sturgis, they-would have to coordinate with the Latin

American Division before they did anything since we do hoid

the file.

would you briefly explain what a 201 file is?

A

A 201 file is a personnel file. It consists of any

information relating to an individual appearing in the press

as a result of other agency reporting and that type of thing.

Personnel or personality file?

A

Personality file, I should say. Excuse me.

Do you know whether of not there is any connection

or relationship between Eugenio Martinez and Mr. Sturgis?

A

well, I will say this. Obviously, they do know

each other. They have to know each other from their days

in Cuba.

guess, and he was in our maritime activities.

He was a

boat captain eventually. And he did participate in infiltrations

and exfiltrations and perhaps one of two raids, hit and run,

sabotage-type actions against Cuba. Sturgis never enjaged in

any of these things. He never did it for us nor did he ever

do it on any of our boats, planes, or -- anything that belongs'

to the Agency.

When Martinez would run such an operation or captain

a boat on such an operation, would he be charged with putting

together his own crew?

A

No. lle had an assigned crew and every boat had

Case Officer operating either out of the -- probably out

the Miami Station.

Sometimes I would assume that ie did

You spoke about paramilitary operations and covart

action. How do you distinguish between those two categories

of activities?

A

Well, actually one can fall into the other. The

paramilitary could fall into covert action but in those day's

we did distinguish somewhat. A lot of the covert action was

media placement. We had a number of operations at -- legal-

type operations, harassment operations. For instance, Fidei

seized a great many art treasures and in particular he had a

Napoleonic collection which was supposed

to be the finest in

the world that he sold to dealers in Europe. He had paintings!

that were immensely valuable that he tried to have auctioned

in London and the London auctioneer would not accept them

because he obviously didn't have clear

title to them. He is

U.S.-oriented. As parts began wearing out and this type of

to place orders with subsidiaries of U.S. companies. Where

their foreign subsidiaries not to provide the spare parts

and the other things

that Castio might

We had the Department of Commerce send letters to those 600

to cooperate with them in denying

any spare parts to the Cubans. This was a fairly concentrated

effort to really isolate them.

Let's tall: about economic warfare for a couple of

moments. Could you describe for me briefly the type of

economic activities that were conducted against Castro?

Well, first of all, we wanted

to denigrate the

regine, his credit vorthiness, and this type of thing. We

worked very closely with the Coordinator of Cuban Affairs

in

the State

Department and, well, for instance, in those days,

guess

it was back in 1964, the price of sugar had jumped iron

about a penny a pound to 13 cents a pound, something like

that, and we couldn't understand why. So we kept -- Fidel kept

saying that he had such a poor crop and this type of thing and

we just couldn't figure out why he had such a poor crop because

some of our own island assets told us they were out there cuttin

this cane like mad and the mills were working 24 hours a day.

this type of thing. So subsequently, we found out that he was

lying and he was storing the raw cane in the schools, any

place. He had no storage facilities and put it any place lie

could.

So in cooperation with a couple of sugar brokers in

New York, we surfaced this fact and the price of sugar took a

It was this type of thing that obviously he vas

trying to build up the world price because he didn't have any

money, he was

so short on his exchange, and obviously we didn

want him to get the exchange. So it was those types of

activities.

Was the assistance of any u.s. businessmen or u.s.

companies enlisted in that effort?

2

oh, yes.

In what manner did

you use U.S. companies and

businessmen?

A

Well, we simply used them as the experts. A jicat

many -- the sugar industry in Cuba was controlled by the

American community, by American bankers, and obviously they

lost everything when they had to pull out. Sugar is tie

lifeline of Cuba as far as any exchange, foreign exchange. cos

type of thing, and it was naturally our Number 1 tariet.

was only natural that we would go to the American busin ss-en.

but I don't think that -- I think all the training was done

Now, what kinds of operations are included within

this category of maritime operations?

Well, the infiltration operations, infiltrating

agents into Cuba, exfiltrating agents, hit and run sabotage

raids. That is about the extent of it.

Yes.

frequently - they would either approve the operation or say

no. These operations had to be planned well in advance because

the tides had to be right, the moon had to be in the proper

phase for communications and this type of thing. And these

things, all these were coordinated with the Joint Chiefs of

of these operations, you know, you would have to have a mothor

The thing

Castro didn't hve the money to buy it and they weren't going

The railroad system was in total disaster. The

Soviets had such a long louistics line, supply line, plus

the fact that the Cubans didn't like the Soviet equipment

because they were used to good American equipment. And these

were principal targets that we were trying to get to.

A Well, this is, I guess you could term it a target of

opportunity. This was where a vessel was carrying Cuban

sugar

to the Soviet Union and I forget exactly now what happened

to

it but I know that it got a hole below the waterline, or

something, and had to put into fuerto Rico for repairs.

In order to repair it, I guess, and get it in the

drydock or wherever it was, they had to remove the sugar and

put it in the warehouse and at that time I guess somebody cane

up with a plan to try to widen the rift between -- there was

a rift at that time between the soviets and Cubans and to

put a harmless substance into the sugar that would make it

acid, sour tasting, and it wouldn't harm the sugar or the

individual, and some of this was done.

And then when it

leaked, of course, we had to get rid of it and we had a sugar

Can you give me an example of the kinds of counter-

well, we had

a number of joint operations, as I

recall, with the Bureau. We had identified a Castro agent that

came in by small boat and when she was -- she came in with a

number of other people. When she hit the -- they had a recep-

tion center up in Opa Loca that was really a HEW operation.

So along with the Bureau ve put a surveillars

indeed, she went on the air in the morning at 5:00 o'clock

Bureau's Cuban squad was fairly small. I mean, it was a laric

squad in terms of FBI squads. It had 36 people on it, some-

thing like that, but 36 people trying to follow a couple o!

to properly

staff the thing?

yes, yes. You have got to remember, too, that a los

of the people on that Cuban squad were in the legal section

of the Embassy in Havana. You know, the fBI overseas is

known as Legal Attaches, obviously working out of the Embassy

the same as our Station was, and a lot of our Station officers

from llavana were down in Miami at that time. So there was a

relationship there that had gone over a period of years

between the Agency and the Bureau.

Yes.

A.

The Agency subsidized these fronts in an effor: to

have unity rather than these split factions, split anti-casi

factions. Obviously the leaders of the fronts knew that the

CIA was subsidizing. Supposedly the people that joined these

fronts did not know they ware being subsidized by the agear.

of the U.S. Government.

@ But when you say "supposedly," does the face anomir

to be otherwise?

A.

WEll, based on mu experience with the Cubans and this

type of thing, and their penchant to talk, I would think that

it wouldn't take long for knowledge of any subsidy to sur!gro

itself.

Was it your opinion and impression at that time, ..

Sturbitts, that a great many Cubans considered themselves en

involved in the CIA organizations?

There was some Cuban presence in New Orleans. I am

sort of a sideshow to Miami.

But the same

is -- it is possible that some of the

same Cuban organizations which were being sponsored or funded

by the Agency also had

activities or operations in Now Orleans?

A.

I don't know if I can answer that, whether they had

the same functions. I know that some funding arrangement for

subsidizing the organizations in Miami was carried out through

New Orleans.

were subsidizing there had to be some ostensible source of

income for them to continue what they were doing. A great

number - well, not a great number, but a number of select

people were -- well, they were selected and then they were

to get the funding through to the organizations.

These people were normally prominent people and --

And did they get funded by the Agency, then, through

the maeium of prominent and

well-to-do people?

A.

These vell-to-do people ostensibly would call a friend!

of theirs that had heen made trustee of another type of activity

and say, you know, we are trying to assist these Cubans in this

type of thing. Could your organization give us any money, and

the guy on the other end would say, sure, we can probahly lend

you $?5,000 or something like that, or donate $25, 000. This is

the way the funding went into the fronts.

And was some of that funding arranged through

in New Orleans?

A.

I would think so. I believe so.

Here any of the people in New Orleans through who

that funding operation was effected people who turned out to be

involved in the investigations conducted by Jim Garrison?

Not to my knowledge.

How about David Ferrie?

Was he ever connected with

to Cubans or Cuban groups?

I would say no. I don't think there was -- you have

Was there a lot of talk about killing Castro among

I would say among the Cuban exiles there probably was

a lot of talk about that.

Did you participate, yourself in the overhearing of

such conversations?

No.

Was this a matter of something that was reported to

A well, it was -- I really don't remember what the

that this subject always came up. What were they going to do

with Fidel? How are they going to get rid of him and this type

of thing. I don't mean the Agency people. This is what the

Cuban exile community was discussing.

Yes. Do you know what Howard Hunt was doing for the

Agency in 1963?

Well, it seems to me he was here at Headquarters in

'63 and I think he was assigned to the European Division a:o

I have done it twice that I recall and the most recent

one was I guess -- I am just trying to think. Nell, it wasn't

too long ago because we did have an inquiry and we obtained the

time and the attendance records from the Office of Finance which

showed that Howard Hunt was on sick leave on that day.

Was this just fairly recently?

A.

Yes.

I understood from what files I have seen, Mr.

Sturbitts, that the only records that were available from the

Office of Finance showed that he had had nine hours of sick leave

during the two-week pay period ending the 23rd of November but

that the records were not available as to how much sick leave

or annual leave had been taken on any particular day.

Well -

Am I mistaken?

A.

As I recall, he was in a duty status one day and a

sick leave status the next day and back to duty the next day.

I would have to check that with my Budget and Fiscal Officer.

He is the chap that got that for me..

we would put him in contact with the Chiefs of Stations of

would give him background briefings and this type of thing

their ratin American-editor traveled a great deal throughouty

Now, turning to the Miami Station's involvement for

Q

Were these people on whom name traces were requested.

all foreign nationals?

All foreign nationals.

was there any check made to determine whether

any of them were American citizens?

We levied on the Secret Service as a requirement

that they have identified these people by nationality before

we would run a, name trace. Inadvertently, at one time

they did submit a list, a rather long list of American citizens

which we promptly sent back to them and told them we could

not trace.

And this practice was followed both in 1963 and

1972?

A

That is right.

And where were these names traced?

A

They were traced back here and also in Miami.

The

Miami Station did their name check and we did our name check

here. In the case of Cubans, probably the Miami Station had

more information on the Cubans than we would have back here.

But the names were traced through Agency files?

Yes.

Watergate trial.

Some of these allegations that came out

and I think they were carried in the Anderson column but we

made file checks and this type of thing. One particular

activity was supposed to have been carried out in Rockefeller

Center in New York and it turns out it was taken out of

context.

It was a training mission and -- training exercise.

These guys were being trained in surveillance in New York

and they were simply asked to go into a branch of the Manhattan.

- Chase Manhattan and to come back out and then they were

supposed to diagram the layout of the bank. And this to some

of them meant casing the bank when in fact it was just a

memory exercise.

with what frequency were those kinds of training

exercises conducted?

A

Well, whenever there was an -- whenever it was felt

that these people,

selected individuals, were to be trained

in trade craft.

And did their trade craft training include such

things as surveillance?

A

Sure.

And break-ins?

A

No. Not break-ins. Nor surreptitious entry. As I

said, in the case of this particular thing, it was misinter-

preted as casing the bank. These exercises were given -- they

than the training exercise?

Oh, no. No. I don't believe they did.

Does the Miami Station- I beg your pardon --

does the Headquarters component that now handles the Cuban

situation in Miami run any agents in the

Cuban community?

A

No. Well, let me explain that to you. We do have

a career agent who has been with us for a good many years

in Miami and we do use him to contact relatives of Cubans

who are still in Cuba. I mean, relatives who are in the U.s.

who have relatives in Cuba.

Now, this is done principally with the idea of a

recruitment target, determine weaknesses of strengths, this

type of thing. He does contact these people all over tha

United States. If we come across an individual that looks like

he might be recruitable, or perhaps we could even double hin,

we will, after we make our preliminary assessment, and we

find out where relatives and these types of people are, we

will ask this career agent or instruct him to go contact

these people, be it New York, New Jersey, Chicago, or what-

ever.
