2. The Department of Defense:

A.

Continued surveillance of the area surrounding Cuba at

the same rate and with the same emphasis as existed prior to that

date. Between 25 April and 23 May 1963 additional sea surveillance

was realized between Cuba and Haiti, due to the stationing of the

Caribbean Ready Amphibious Squadron

at the entrance of the Gulf of

Gonaives occasioned by, the deterioration of internal conditions in

Haiti.

B. Continued the installation of military communications

facilities in Latin America. Due to noncommunication difficulties,

the multi-channel radio station scheduled for installation at

Managua, Nicaragua by 1 July 1963 will be completed on or about

27 July 1963. Entry negotiations have been completed with Honduras,

with the Tilitary rádio facilities installation scheduled for com

pletion on or about '10 October 1963.

Negotiations are continuing

in Colombia and Ecuador for the installation of military radio

facilities.

C. Continued the surveillance of Cuba by U. S. forces,

reporting as before, to U.S. commanders, organizations and

agencies.

Reports of subversive movement, obtained by U.S.

surveillance have been made available for

• Immediate transmittal

through U. S. military alerting system.

D. Reached agreement with CIA on steps to be taken to prevent

duplication of effort in operating a U.S. military alerting system

and furnished guidance on this matter to USCINCSO and CINCLANT.

After clarification of the role of the U. S. Military Groups by

USCINCSO the military alerting system was again placed in operation

effective 15 June 1963.

E. Maintained U. S. forces, for the most part from within

the Atlantic Command, available

to respond to assist in the final

interception of suspicious craft in territorial waters, upon the

request of the country concerned. Currently, forces are assigned

by the United Commander involved to meet the singular problem

encountered. In somewhat similar circumstances, U.S. forces of

Craft Inspection and Training Team (SCIATT). Members of the SCIATT

accompanied by a representative from the staff of Commander U. S.

Naval Forces, Southern Command (COMUSNAVSO) have completed an in-

country evaluation of 40-foot Coast Guard Utility Boats (CGUBs) in

five Central American countries and a detailed program through

mid-November has been prepared for improving the material readiness

and handling of the CGUBs provided by _MAP.

Action is underway to

expedite delivery of spare parts required for maintenance of the

boats.

COMUSNAVSO has now initiated a request to establish SCIATT

billets with permanent personnel for an initial period of three

years in order to fully develop the Central American CGUB program.

The success of this program would be a major contribution to the

Caribbean Surveillance System.

U. S. Commander in Chief, Southern

Command (USCINCSO) has recommended approval of COMUSNAVSO's request

to CNO and action is being coordinated with OSD/ISA, JCS and USCG

to obtain approval and appropriate funding for permanent billets.

The 40-foot CGUB permanently assigned to the U. S. Naval

Station, Rodman, Canal Zone, for use by the SCIATT has been

delivered and is

in the process of being activated.

Continued efforts

to improve the internal security

of latin American armies through the provision of Intelligence

Advisors. Presently there are such advisors assigned to 14

latin countries, emphasizing counterintelligence and counter-

subversion.

H. Continued, through its intelligence agencies, work on

studies concerning Castro/Communist subversion directed against

Latin America.

I. Increased to 12 the number of latin American countries in

which there are intelligence exchange arrangements between U. S.

and local military services.

3. The Central Intelligence Agency:

A. Completed efforts to improve U.S. government communica-

tions in Latin America by the installation of the remaining

two commercial leased circuits into Guatemala City and

Managua, and the stationing on a permanent basis of 35 CIA

radio operators in Latin America

in replacement of temporary

duty personnel.

In November 1962, CIA's active radio facilities

in 20 Latin American capitals were augmented with on-line

cryptographic facilities

and temporary personnel to handle the

bulk of all U.s. government communications in the area. These

facilities,

known as Joint Communications Centers, are now

being operated by CIA on a 24-hour basis,

as a service to

all U.S. government agencies. Latin American traffic handled

by the CIA base radio station near Washington has increased

from 3,000,000 groups handled

in October 1962 to 15,000,000

groups

handled in March 1963.

B. Increased its efforts designed to control the movement

o1 persons, arms and propaganda materials to and from Cuba. A

summary of

actions by country follows:

Argentina - Station, in conjunction with the Embassy,

has continued to press the Argentine government to enact

effective travel control legislation and to adopt measures

recommended by the Special Consultative Committee on Security

of the OAS.

Information on Argentines travelling to Cuba is

being furnished to the Argentine government by the station.

Several potential travellers to Cuba have been spotted and

are being assessed by the station. Information from three

recent returnees from Cuba is being obtained through debriefings.

Station reports that because of increased Mexican controls,

all truly clandestine travel to Cuba from Argentina is now

via Prague.

The Argentine Security Service has informed the

station that mail censorship and customs controls at the

docks and airports are 95% effective in preventing the

entrance of Cuban propaganda

through these channels.

Local

dissemination of propaganda

is regulated by an Argentine

inter-agency committee, which reviews any new propaganda

items and takes action

to stop dissemination of any item

judged

to be pro-Cuban or pro-Communist. During May the

Argentine government issued a new decree which restricts

Communist activities within Argentina.

weins argentine.

The station has continued

to press the Security Service to urge regulation of travel

to Cuba, but the adoption of such measures has been delayed

pending government receipt on an official basis of the OAS

Through several assets the station is working

on leads which it is hoped will reveal the basic sources of

illegal arms sales in Argentina.

2.

Bolivia - Station has been urging Bolivian government

to adopt stricter travel controls, without apparent results

so far. Names of travellers known to have returned from Cuba

are being furnished to the Bolivian government.

Thus far,

no action is known to have been taken by the Bolivian

government on the strength of such information. Station comments

that problem with Bolivia is not in lack of information

available to government on Cuban subversion, but in getting

solivia to do something about it. The station has also

furnished considerable information, including some

surreptitiously acquired documents, to the Ambassador for his

use in urging Bolivian government action against Cuba.

Considerable information is also being obtained

through the

interrogation of Peruvian guerrillas captured attempting to

Brazil - Information on Brazilians who have received

subversive training in Cuba has been made available to the

National Security Council through CIA liaison with the

NSC's Security Service.

While the Brazilians have stated

that the information is "of interest," there is no firm

indication to date that they have the capability or desire to

really follow up on the information furnished.

An asset of the CIA station in Rio is in a

position

to harass and delay Cuba-bound travellers in those instances

where the station is able to tip him off regarding their

destination.

He can also harass returnees when informed

advance.

The station is taking steps to get appropriate

information to him promptly.

The station has indicated that

in spite of its increased efforts, there are no indications

of any basic change in the Brazilian attitude toward Cuba,

and it is unlikely that the Brazilian government will take

adequate steps to combat Cuban subversion.

4. Chile - Chilean internal security authorities, at

urging of station, are trying to impede and harass travellers

to and from Cuba.

Government is now requiring passport

applicants to state destination, and passports must be turned

in after travel.

the Foreign Minister has stated much progress

s being made

with cooperation of the Mexican government, and

that travel of Chileans to Cuba has been dramatically reduced

in recent weeks. Station and Embassy are continuing pressure

on Cuban government in this regard.

Names of travellers to

Cuba are being passed

to the Ambassador,

who furnishes them

be kept secret). Information from CIA unilateral operations

against Cuban Embassy is being used by a newly created Chilean

surveillance team in checking out purpose of travel projected

and in following up on returnees from Cuba.

The station

has an agent in daily contact with leaders

of the extreme

militant left and is exploring the possibilities of sending

three station assets to Cuba for training and intelligence

missions.

A Cuban First Secretary was declared persona non

grata during April for using false identity documents, and

the Cuban charge d'affaires was subsequently recalled

by his

own government. Two new sources have recently been recruited

by the station who are in a position to furnish valuable

information concerning not only certain aspects of the situation

within Cuba, but details concerning travel

to and from Cuba

by both legal and illegal means.

The station is now in the

process of debrieling an asset who recently returned to

Santiago after spending one month in Cuba as a trainee.

Efforts are being made to have other station assets included

in future training programs.

5• Colombia - Chief of Customs has indicated to station

his willingness to institute an improved travel control

system. Station believes it has identified a courier operating

between Colombia and Cuba and has mounted an operation to

uncover his Colombian contacts.

One station asset is now

in Cuba attending guerrilla warfare training, another is

being depleted alter his recent return from Cuba, and a

third expects to depart soon for two months training in

The station is continuing to develop leads provided

by one recent returnee, and thus far this investigation has

7. Dominican Republic - Efforts to get Juan Bosch to

take active steps against Communists and travellers to and

from Cuba have been fruitless to date, as have been efforts

to establish a new and effective internal security organiza-

tion in the Dominican Republic. Bosch appears to have lost

his previously stated

enthusiasm lor such a service

but

efforts to persuade him to approve a proposed budget for

the service are continuing.

3. Ecuador - Station reports that, largely as a result

oi both overt and covert propaganda activities of U.S.

agencies in Ecuador,

the public awareness of Cuban subversion

has changed from apathy to genuine concern.

The government,

nowever, is no more inc.ined

to take action than before.

The National Director of Immigration has stated that he

personally would like to do whatever he can to stop travel

to cuba, which he realizes is for subversive purposes, but

present

laws do not permit him to impede travel via third

countries.

He is exploring possibilities of reprisals

against citizens who return from Cuba.

He has checked

a list of names and passport numbers obtained by CIA

from airline manifests in Mexico, and reports that not

one name or passport number corresponds with official

Ecuadoran records, indicating the possibility of

fabrication of passports by Cuba.

A recent Ecuadoran returnee from Cuba, recruited

by the station, lost his hand in testing a homemade bomb made

in accordance with instructions received in Cuba.

He made

a public statement and wide publicity was arranged by the

station and USIS. Plans are to keep this incident alive

as proof of revolutionary training given in Cuba for

terrorist activity in Ecuador.

The station chief has accompanied the American

Ambassador on visits to the Ecuadoran Ministers of Defense

and Government to stress the threat of Cuban backed

subversion.

Approximately 7,000 pounds of Communist propaganda

are being destroyed monthly as a result of a unilateral

operation of the CIA Base in Guayaquil.

There have been at least two recent cases of

Ecuadoran returnees from Cuba being arrested upon their

arrival, one of

them having been found in possession of a

Large sum o1 U.s. dollars, and another allegedly having a

plan of revolutionary action found on his person.

In both

cases the Ecuadoran authorities had been informed of the

pending arrivals of these individuals by the CIA station.

9. El Salvador - The station has called to the

attention of the Chief of the Salvadoran Security Service

the fact that the stamping of passports "not valid for

travel to Cuba" is not being done on a regular basis, and

received assurance that the Foreign Office and Immigration

Police would be reminded of their obligation to do this.

The station is embarking on an expanded program of

assistance to Department 2 of the Ministry of Defense,

which is in fact the Salvadoran Clandestine Internal

Security Service.

That service has indicated a willingness

and desire to combat Cuban subversion, but so far it has

lacked both know-how and equipment to do so.

10. Guatemala - The CIA station in Guatemala City has

found its efforts in this field hampered considerably by

the apathy and disorganization of the Guatemalan government.

Early this year the only effective Internal Security

Service in Guatemala was disbanded by President Yaigoras!

and no adequate organization has been established since

the Peralta government came into power. Through unilateral

assets the station has been able to keep itself

reasonably

well informed concerning guerrilla activities

the Guatemalan government.

11. Jamaica - New and more stringent regulations concerning

travel to Cuba were adopted by the Jamaican government during

partially as a result of the urging of the CIA station.

Jamaican Internal Security authorities have shown a

willingness to do everything they can to control such travel,

and have indicated a high degree of cooperation with the

CIA station.

12. Haiti - Because of the continued political crisis

in haiti, the ClA station activities there with regard to

Cuban activities have been severely limited and have

consisted primarily of checks made by unilateral station

assets who have reported from Cape Haitien, Port de Paix

and La Gonave and La Tortue Islands that they were unable

to uncover any evidence of travel to or from Cuba.

cooperation between the station and Haitian authorities

can be expected under the present political circumstances.

13. Honduras - The CIA station in Tegucigalpa has

persistently prodded security elements of the Honduran

government in an erfort to persuade that government to

indertake the actions agreed to at Managua.

The govern-

ment has now begun stamping most new passports "invalid

for travel to Cuba." However, revalidated passports are

not being so stamped. Station assets have

succeeded in

publicizing some Cuban subversive activities, including

the return of eight leftist labor leaders from a trip

to Cuba and the sabotage of a fishing vessel which was

being used by anti-Castro Cuban exiles to surveil the

northern coast of Honduras. Several alleged Cuban agents

are now being held in jail pending legal proceedings

against them.

14. Mexico - A CIA source states the Cuban Embassy

has continued to issue visas on pieces of paper separate

from the passport, but

the government's practice of

stamping all passports to show travel to or from Cuba has

largely nullified this effort by travellers to avoid the

stigma of travel to Cuba.

All Cubans arriving in Mexico,

whether in transit or otherwise must have Mexican visas.

confiscate propaganda material from Cuba sporadically at

the airport. The government recently refused visas

five Cuban doctors

who wished

• to attend a Urology Congress

in MexiCo. Several suation assets have recently travelled

to Cuba for intelligence purposes.

Through unilateral

penetrations of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City, the

CIA station continues to acquire information on types of

Cuban visas granted

to traveilers, as well as some

advance travel date.

1): Panama - At the unging of station, the Guardia.

Nacional has been ordered to increase its vigilance

concerning returnees Irom Cuba and to prevent them

from establishing an effective organization. Several

recent returnees from Cuba are being debriefed regarding

their training and contacts, and several CIA assets are

expecting to leave for Cuba in the near future for training.

CIA has increased its personnel assigned to travel control

functions at the Panama City airport, now permitting a three-

man detail for each eight-hour shift.

Station is continuing

its pressure on Panamanian officials to tighten travel

controls.

16. Nicaragua - The Nicaraguan Security Services with

whom the CIA station is in liaison have been cooperative

in their efforts to take suitable action based on the

Managua resolutions.

Cuban activity in Nicaragua appears

to be at a minimum, and the government has the will and

ability to control

it.

17. Peru - Through the cooperation of a Peruvian

intelligence organization, CIA officers have been able to

participate in the interrogation of several Cuba-trained

guerrillas who were recently captured when they attempted

The interrogation

Soviet activities in Cuba, and particularly on Cuban

support to guèrrilla

Further infor-

mation has been obtained through a unilateral asset of

An investigation of small arms manufacture in a machine

shop in Lima is underway at the urging of the station.

The

station has furnished additional technical equipment to

the Peruvian Naval Intelligence Service to increase its

capability to intercept clandestine radio communications from

Cuba, and

acquisition of arms, communications equipment and other

information concerning MIR guerrilla activities has been

acquired through a unilateral asset of the station.

18. Uruguay - Station has made arrangements with local

service to pigeonhole or "lose" applications for good

conduct certificates - which are needed

to secure passports,

and must be renewed every six months - in cases where

information from the CIA station or from the Uruguayans:

own sources indicated intention of travelling to Cuba:

Pertinent information fIOM CIA unilateral operations is being

passed regularly to cooperating Uruguayan officials. Station

has a further check in that the Mexican Ambassador to

Uruguay is now checking all applicants for Mexican visas with

the station. On the basis of

information furnished to him,

he held up visa applications of Uruguayan Communist Labor

delegates who planned to attend May Day celebrations in

Havana •

Creation of this bottleneck may force some travellers

to abandon the Mexican route to Cuba and turn to the longer

and far more expensive route via Prague. Information on

past

travel to Cuba by Uruguayans, furnished by the station,

was included in a study of Cuban subversion prepared by

Uruguayan Military Intelligence Service for the National

Council of Government.
