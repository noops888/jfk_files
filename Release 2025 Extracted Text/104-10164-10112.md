Clémard Joseph CHARLES

President and General Manager

of the Commercial Bank of Haiti

Clémard Joseph Charles, a man who has

Insisted on numerous occasions. that he will

CENTRAL REFERENCE

SERVICE

be the next President of Heiti, has been

chronically involved, directly or indirect-

ly, in rumored plots

against President

-Duvalier which have never materialized.

In May 1963 Charles is reported to have

GEN

passed word to US officials through an

American journalist that he was in a

position to head a provisional govern-

ment after President Duvalier had been

removed from power. In subsequent years, particularly in 1966.

and 1967, Charles approached US officials both in New York

and Port-au-Prince with the apparent intention of enlisting

US support for a group of conspirators he claimed to lead

which was determined to topple Duvalier from power. None

of these plots materialized, however, and there was never

any evidence to suggest that any serious plans had been made.

In January 1969 Charles had a lengthy conversation with

an official of the US Embassy in which the former candidly

discussed his grievances against Duvaller and the plot he

claimed to be instigating to overthrow Duvalier and replace

him as President of

Haiti.

Chasles stated that the group

supporting his efforts consisted primarily of soldiers, a

few militiamen, some professional men, priests, students,

and assorted other well-placed individuals.

He claimed

that representatives of. these groups had already agreed on

the essential elements of a constitution which would in-

elude a bicameral legislature and an operative political

party structure.

The reporting official cautioned, how-

over, that Charles' remarka should be viewed in light of

his previous history of relating such conapiracles..

When President Duvaller was reported to be seriously

to be aware of the identities oi these.men. Furthermore,

accorsing to an official of the US Embassy, at one tir

It appeared that Charles had originated the idea of the

junta,

hoping to utilize it evencually to launch his own

• candidacy

for

the Presidency. Subsequently, however,

Charles changed his statements about being

"the next

President" to being "a future President," and he seemed

to be placing some distance between himself and the pro-

posed junta.

During Charles' forementioned conversation with an

Embassy official in January 1969, he revealed other facets.

of his personality as well as his penchant for plotting.

He conceives of his role in Haiti in grandiose, almost

messianic terms. He said that he had invested

$2 million

In Hafti and had done more for the development of tha

country than any other indigonous Haitian.

He claimed,

for example, that the workers in the Artibonite were.

passionate admirers of his because his tannery in Port

Sondé (now closed) provided needed jobs. He also claimed

the special allegiance of the chauffeur guides, the only

truly organized workers in the country, because when he

directed the compulsory Government Motor Vehicle Insurance

program,, legitimate chauffeur claims were paid.:: He in-

plied that such claims were no longer honored.:

Discussing the internal problems of his country,

Charles stressed the need for lumediate steps to prevent

the total destruction of saltl's land and resources, to

control the spiraling population growth, and to rejuvenate

the country's secondary cities.

To achieve these goala

before current trenda become irreversible, Charles belleves

that 1t 18 essential to pursue relations. wich che united

States that would be conducivo to massive assistanco: and

Investment.

In this respect he insisto

that Duvaller"

has been grosaly unrealistic and has done Halll great

damage by his rofusal. to recognize the role the Unitad

States mat play In Haltian affairs.

Banque Comerciale d'laits,

Present during my, visits with Charlea was his personal assistant and con-

fident, Iudovich Celestines.

Charles, & devout Catholic, personally told

me that he intended to attempt to overthrow Duvalier.' He bas made speciflo

plans for this overthrow in late February or early March 1969.

He claims

that he definitely has the Army and the Catholla Church with him, and

that the overthrow will be without bloodshed.

'I had not intended to contaot other officials or individuals in Faiti.

J'al mêne eu à faire un câblo a un ani pour

Iu1 annoncer non arrivée et je suis sûr qu'il a da t'en informor.

Duetere:ont, l'arrestation de Clemarà ainsi que les nouvelles dur derriers

que j'avais entanées pour Clémari et qui semblaient vouloir -boutir. Je n'ai

Alorg que nos anis

d'ici et nol pensions pouvoir aider Clémard que nous

se nouvclle arrestation est venue nous assommer

avec une riguour dont nous

nous remettons à peine.

Avant d'aller plus loin, je dois te dire que tu ne dois point fouter de notre

dévouement pour Clémard.

Il sait, et tu dois aussi le savoir, que nous ne

saurions jamais marchander notre concours à un ami poir qui nous avor. la plus

mande affcction et pour qui nous sormes prêts à consentir tous les sacrifices

porsonnels que les circonstances peuvent exiger.

Nos puissants amis communs tant & New York, Washington, Mians et ailleurs ont

MEMORANDUM FOR TIE RECORD

SUBJECT: Letter from Louls A. Brun to FSO. Felder

1.

I talked with George Musulin (DCS/Ops

Support.

Staff) at 0840 hours this morning about the letter mailed

to rso felder at the American Embassy in Port au Prince.

Musulin said that he had spokon with Brun abjut the letter

and Brun had assured him that Felder suid to mail letterg

to him through Foreign Service mail channels.' Brun is in

contact with

Felder during his visits to Haiti and this

Bystem was lald on between them during ane of his trifs.

2.

Brun also said that he was a little üpset about

the problems which had arisen in sending his letter. Brun

said that he had recaived a letter from Folder (mailed in

New York City) saying that he had never received the letter

from Brun. Brun was concerned that the letter may have

fallen into the wrong hands in Haiti.

Musulin said that

he would try to recover the letter and send 1t back to

Brun.

3.

I told Musulin that Ambassador Ross was very

nuch

disturbed about this matter and that any. further involve-

ment by the Agency with correspondence between Brun and.

Folder should be avoided.

Brun 18 a business agent of

Clemard Joseph-Charles and thus any correspondence between

Brun and an official of the American Embassy 18 of parti-

oular concern to the Ambassador because of the obvious

political Implications.

Musulin said he understood this

and would tell Brun that the dispatch of any correspondence

In the future would be his own responalbility.

sa nouvelle arrestation est venue nous assonter avec une riquour dont nous

nous remettont à peinc.

Avant d'aller plus loin, je dois te dire que tu ne dols point douter de notre

dévouement pour Clémard.

Il sait, et tu

tis chère Sophie,

Cette lettr: est pour t'accuser réception des tiennes des 17 et 26 mai

Ecoulés et du la juin en cours.

Si tu n'es pas eu de nes nouvelles depuis non départ d'Haiti le l mal dernier,

c'est que presièrement, je ne proposais de retourner voir Clénard la senaine

Le vojage a da être différé lorsque j'al su que Clémard avait, à

nouveau, été arrêté le l1 nal.

j'ai mêne eu à faire un câble à un amd pour

Iu1 arrancer non arrivée et je suis sûr qu'1l a da t'en informer.

Dueldrement, l'arrestation de Clénari sinal que les nouvelles der derniers

avénements en Halti on eu des effets négatifs sur les néguciations en cours

que j'avals entamées pour Clemard et qui semblaient vouloir aboutir. Je n'ai

• pas. besoin de te dire combien j'en al été bouleversé. Alors que nos amis

d'1cl et nol pensions pouvoir aider Clémard que nous estimons conne un frère,

as nouvelle arrestation est venue nous assonner avec une rigueur dont nous

nous remettono à peine.

Avant d'aller plus loin, je dols te dire que tu ne dois point douter de notre

devouement pour clamard.

Il sait, et tu dois aussi le savoir, que nous ne

saurions jamals marchander notre concours à un ani pour qui nous avons à plus

grande affection et pour qui nous sonnes prêts à consentir tous les sacrifices

personnnis que les circonstances peuvent exiger. Je crois devoir te dire que

a1, en dehors d'Halt1, le n'arrive à'le tirer de l'impaszu dans laquelle 11 se

trouve, je doute fort, sans fausse modesile, que quelqu'un d'autre puisse

réussir à le falre.

....

Nos puissants anis communs tant à New York, Washington, Mans et allleurs ont

tous tenifesté un désir sérieux de lui venir en aide dans les linites de leurs

possibilités respectives.

Depuie non retour d'Haiti je me sulo nis en action à cette fin et a1 personeile-

sient vu plusieurs personnalités du monde financier qui n'ont pas hésité à

consacrer une grando partie ue leur temps précieux à la concrétisation des plans

que j'ai el e envisager aved clémara en vue de la tirer d'embarras. le plus

rapidement possible.

20 mas écoulé.

Je t'envole, pour preuve, copie d'une lettre d'un de ces

rands anis, Mr. Howard Burris de Washington, D.C. Je te demande de garde.

Ceef dit, malgré tous ces obstacles qui sembleraient Insuruntables, jo n'al

pas totalement perdu l'espoir de pouvoir t'alder à sortir Clemard, sain et

souf, de la prison où sa santé se détcriore rapidoment, Je le snis. L'essentiel

at que le Chef lui-meme soit pereuadé que l'inhabilite que nous éprouvons à

satisfaire les exigences du moment, ne sont en aucune façon Imputables à Clemand

mais plutôt. à des circonstances totalement indépendantes de notre volonté.

jo prie Dieu Tout-puissant pour que l'on finlase par réallaer que clémard, en

son patriote haltien, a eu fol en son pays et n'a pas cru bon d'expatrier, Comm

plus d'un l'a falt, le fruit de ses durs labeurs et de son intelligence pro

ductive.

je ne proposais d'ferire personnellement à Son Excellence le Preaident a Vio

d'Halt1, pour implorer sa clémence et ss générosité pour un enl qui nous est cher.

Je ne suis alors demandé a1 c'étalt là un geste sage qui pourralt avoir la. vertu

de l'épargner et, dans le doute, j'al préférer m'abstenir.:

Pour revenir maintenant aux rosslb1lltés de féaliser au moins partiellement, la

procuration générale en bonne et due forme t'habilitant à ratifler tout co que

nous poursions entreprendre li Cette fin.

avec dilligence pour nous permettre d'aller l

plus vite.

Ma chère Sophie; je termineral cette lettre déjà lorgue et ardue en te renou:

It woula be chilaish, however, to fortulato an opinion anly os the.

basis of the mentioned facts, although on the surface, they arpear

logical crough to confim these conclusions.

I a convenced in my own mind, that wien some politicians close to

Duvalier will feel that their lives are in real danger, sane of dies

themselves, in a position to control the chaotic situatior that will he-

cessarily follow. Inis is where the real danger is. Is any such un

planned action was allowed to take place, the U.S. will tien find Lisell

with a resl: "hot potato", requirirg such drastie action sinliar to: chose

takin in 2965 during the recent crisis in the doninican Republic. Such

actions are not to be desired, not only because they are coscly to the

smerican taxpayers, but because they inevitably provo'a strong anti-

American feelings based on the opinion that the U.S. did noching to help

bring about the collapse, but is merely there to impose its choice and

decisions against the will of the people. Is the U.S. Is to vait for the

DAS to decide on joint action in the eventuality or chaos, we are suraid.

that communist influence and even control of the situstion by forces

based In Cuba and other countries, will make it nuch more difficult to

cope with within the context of our national security. It 1s, therefore,

imperative, In our opinion, that the U.S, take some steps towards working

with local politiciars to take the inltiative of a cous which, when per

formed, would receive the strong backing of this country, militarily,

financially and otherwise, to scure an orderly succession of the present

regime. As far as, lialt1 1s concerned, I feel that I have the nost adequate

solution for the proposed action. I feel that whenever the security of

this nation, or any nation 1s concerned, there 1s no time for wist-anú-sea

conflderations. In the case of haiti, in particular, whare the political

scene 18 really deprived of individuale of atrong convictions, one way or

CHARLES, WHO GAINED MUCH OF WHAT HE HAS UNDER MAGLOIRE,

WAS AMONG THOSE WHO FINANCED DUVALIER'S CAMPAIGN.

•IT IS ONLY LOGICAL THAT DUVALIER WOULD RESENT THAT

FACT. FURTHERMORE, SINCE CHARLES IS ACTUALLY A

CANDIDATE FOR-THE PRESIDENCY AND MANEUVERING

AGAINST DUVALIER; DUVALIER WILL DISCOVER SOME "EVIDENCE"

The following 16 my humble appraiaal of the politinal situation

now provalling in Helt1.

As 1 repeatedly sarid to cryors who may have asled me, ly noti-

vations are purely patriotic while I en also moved by si sinsege icsire

tö tee insti enorre as a dimueraile independent ration faiendly to the

United States.

Since I lest Halti with my farily ten years ago to later become en

Anerwin citizen, I have made several trits to Haiti and have muintained

close contacts with people in all walks of life both in laits and with

those who were forced out of the country for political reasons or other

•wise.

Ity latcet visit to Haits took place on June 5th of this year and I

stayed tro days in Port-au-Prince. Although the purpose of my trips

vere mostly business I also had the opportunity to discuss the Haitian

political situation with pollticians, as well as with average Hastion

eitizens concerned with the situation.

ly personal conclusions are as

fOllOWs:

The fact 1s that the Duvalier rezire 16, at present, in a state of .:

interial politien confusion in which no ore rineculy or indirictiy.com

that his s0r-1n-1nw, Colorel lax Doninique, has in fact tried to overthrou

indicates that several other persors, low sulking military persannel,

militia men

and civilians were also executed or: influr charges, without

fanfare. It is alsn the general concensus of opinion that the "purge"

vill continue at a rate that. no one can yet deterine.

iNo one ignores that there has been and still are very hostile feelings

between two groups within the President's family and close associates.

One 18 headed by Colonel Do-inique and his wife Harle-Denise Duvaller,

and another is led by Mirs. Yvon St. Victor, the president's private se-

erctary and confidante. The nanes of the President's wife, Simone, his

son Jean-Claude and his younger daughter Sinone, are being mentioned as

being part of the first grup. In the second group, Mrs. St. Victor's

brother, the present Head of the Department of Tourish, Mr. Lue-Albert

loucera, who is also married to one of the president's daughter, 18 among

other names such as Henri Siclait, head of the Regle, Minister Lebert .

In. Pierre, et?. mentioned to be siding with drs. St: iletor. So far, the

President has shown signs that he favors the latter group. The ramifica-

• Elons of both groups extend to people who were considered the most fanatic

supporters of Duvalier himself. The fact 1s that none of the remaining

so-called strong nen of Luvaller in the militie, the Tonton Necoutes of

the Army know for sure how the president feels towards them and are very

mie' concerried about their own future and survival... In other words,.

contusion and insecurity are wide spread amongst duvaller's followers.

laus belleve that in spite of the actual confusion and sense of insecurity

provalling in governnent circles, there 18 no real organized opposition

is such against duvaller at this moment, except for what I will point out

Later in this paper.

well succeed to turn the country into a now communiat satollite and work

out some agreements with connunist countrles. Here again, 'se should not

fall to mention the new exchange of diplomatic representations between

Halts and some communist countries.

The most 8181121 cant one 1s the now

appointment in Halts of an Ambassador frol Poland With what, I was told,.

Duvalier 1s closely working with.

Taking everything into consideration:

•1. The non existence of any organized opposition 1n lalti;

2. The state of non cohesiveness and distrust amongst the exiled

political elements abroad, therefore nullifying any positive action from

outside Haiti;

3. Ine fear of local politicians that, 1f outside forces were to come

in, their safety and security would be very much at stake, therefore they

should resist such intervention and do whatever 1s necessary to prevent

1t at all cost;

4, The fear of Duvalier's so-called followers that they may be eliminated

upon were suspicion, just or unjust denotelations;

§. The middle and upper classes sentiment that the U.3. 1s not working

as it should to bring about the downfall of Duvaller and that the U.S. 1s

even supporting the regine Intentionally or unintentionally by not en-

couraging or allowing the opposition to organize 1tself;

6. The interpretation of the above classes which ard at a loes to under

stand the allence of the U.S. press in general for not having raised the

usuel Indignation about the recent meas killings, therofore making room.

It would be childish, however, to formulate an opinion only on the,

basis of the mentioned facts, although on the surface, they appear

logical enough to confirm these conclusions.

I az convenced in my own mind, that when some politiclans close to

Duvaller will feel that their lives are. In real danger, some of then

will successrully attempt to eliminate him even though they may not be,

therselves, in a position to control the chaotic situation that will he-

cessarily follow. This is where the real danger 18. If any such un-

planned action was allowed to take place, the U.S. will then find itself

with a real "hot potato", r'equiring such drastic action similar to those

takin in 1965 during the recent crisis in the Dominicon Republic: such

actions are not to be desired, not only because they are costly to the

American taxpayers, but because they Inevitably provoke strong anti-

American feelings based on the opinion that the U.S, did nothing to help

bring about the collapse, but lt merely there to impose its choice and

decisions against the will of the people. If the U.S. 1s to wait for the

DAS to decide on joint action in the eventuallty of chaos, we are afraid

that communist influence and even control of the situation by forces

based in Cuba and other countries, will make 1t much more diffioult to

cope with within the context of our national security: It 18, therefore,

Iaperative, In our opinion; that the U.S, take some steps towards working

vith local polsticians to take ihe Initlative of & coup which, when per.

sorned, would receive the strong backing of this country, militarily,

sinancially and otherwise; to secure an orderly succession of the present

regine. As far as Halt1 1s concerned, I feel that I have the most adequate

solution for the proposed action. I feel that whenever the recurity os

thia nation or any nation 18 concerned, there 10 nö time for waltrand-sea

conesderations: In the case of haiti, in particular, where the politica

scene 18 really deprived of individuals of atrong convictions; one vay of

many times. His answers. on such occasions have, nost of the tie, satisty

were to behave in a different manner. What would his death serve 1f he

had taken a position of nor-compromise? He feels that in order to be.

behind this opinion:

Ha1t1 a "son of the casses";

2. He is black, therefore representing the vast majority of the

2. (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: THE FOLLOWING ASSESSMENT OF

CLEMARD JOSEPH CHARLES HAS BFEN DRAWN FROM INFORMATION FROM

VARIOUS RELIABLE SOURCES: SINCE ABOUT 1963, CHARLES HAS TRIED

TO GAIN U.S. GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR HIMSELF AS THE SUCCESSOR

TO PRESIDENT DUVALIER; HE HAS THE REPUTATION OF BEING AN

OPPORTUNIST, SHREWD, CAPABLE, AND UNSCRUPULOUS, AND HAS DUVALIER'S

CONFIDENCE WHICH HE HAS USED TO FURTHER HIS OWN EFFORTS AGAINST

DUVALIER. THE INFORMATION WHICH FOLLOWS APPEARS TO BE NOTHING

MORE THAN AN EXTENSION OF CHARLES' ATTEMPTS TO PANIC THE U.S.

GOVERNHENT AND THEREBY GAIN TILE SUPPORT OF THE U.S. GOVERNHENT

WHICH MAY CONSIDER CHARLES AS THE LESSER OF A NUMBER OF EVILS.

HIS ALLEGED SUPPORTERS, LISTED BELOW, ARE BELIEVED TO BE

IXBIGNIFICANT AND HIS ALLEGED ARE SUPPORTERS ARE SUSPECT.

CHARLES' REFERENCE TO FIDEL CASTRO AND DOMINICAN PREBIDENT

JOAQUIN BALAGUER AS HIS COMPETITORS: IN A RACE TO OVERTHROH

DUVALIER IS CONSIDERED: TO BE MITHOUT BASIS ' A CALCUIATION BY
