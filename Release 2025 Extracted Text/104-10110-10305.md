SCALETTI recalls the Cuban Section feeling very frustrated that

Agee could provide liu laus ui assistance iù this section in its effurt to target

against the Cuban teams. She recalls no memoranda prepared by Agee for the

Section, no leads given the Section, and he came to discuss the olympics with

C/Cuba not more than half a dozen times.

3. As SCALETTI recalls, it is unlikely that Agee knew any thing about

the operations being run against the Cuban target than that which he might have

picked up at Headquarters or known about the Station operations in general --

such as audio, surveillance, photo surveillance, etc.

SCALETTI had Agee over to her home once for dinner; there were

no other guests. Agee had SCALETTI, her husband, and Laura d. UTSINI

(on TDY) to his apartment once for dinner.

The conversation was always oe ZEArn

light. The only significant thing about Agee's plans which arose was his

discussion about buying used drycleaning equipment in the United States,

bringing it to Mexico and setting up a drycleaning plant. This was brought

up as something for the future and just an idea Phil was toying with.
