On 1 February 1972, Phillip W. May, PFC, 444-48-5481, Custodial

Agent, C Team, ooth USA Artillery Detachment,

Datteln (IC8424), Federal

Republic of Germany (FRG), APO New York 09078, was interviewed at his place

of duty concerning an incident of possible Counter-Intelligence interest,

and stated substantially as follows:

About two or three weeks ago, Source was approached by a man that

identified himself as John the Dee Jay in the Stadtschaenke Bar, batteln.

John said that he was the Disc Jockey at the Lord Nelson, another bar in

Datteln. With Source at the Stadtschaenke were John Stelpflug, John Lukasik,

and Terry Drivis (PHONETIC). John the Dee Jay made a general nuisance of

himself. He talked about security at the site and gave verbally a list of

telephone numbers he claimed were security information telephone numbers in

Heidleberg (MV7773), FRG, and other cities in FRi.

Source was unable to

recall any of the telephone numbers John the Dee Jay mentioned. John asked

Source who the Security Sergeant of the unit was.

He also asked about persons

who had been formerly assigned to the unit. Source was not familiar with

any of the names mentioned as Source has been at the unit only a short time.

John talked about how, if he was a spy, he would get information from people.

Source felt that John the Dee Jay was trying to make him and the others

nervous.

John spoke fluent English and German and claimed that he could

speak Russian. Source described John as follows:

Height:

Six feet to six feet one inch

Weight:

200-210 pounds

Age:

27-28 years old

Build:

Solid

Dress: Wore furry coat and shoes, possibly camel hair

Source had not met John the Dee Jay before and had not seen or had contact

with him since and gave negative responses to all questions posed by him.
