NOTE:

On 10/20/75, Mr. Jack Marsh of the White House

contacted Jack Fuller, supra, concerning this matter and

Mr. Fuller requested that we select six individuals who had

been included on the Watch List and furnish the requested

information for possible use at an Executive Session of the

SSC. On 10/20/75, Mr. Dave Lohman, NSA, advised Supervisor

J. P. Thomas, INID, that NSA was aware that we were going

to receive this request; that there was no need, from NSA's

standpoint, for classification of response merely because

it stated that certain persons were on the Watch List.

He

stated NSA intended to tell the SSC the number of requests

it hadireceived from other agencies, including FBI, to put

names on the Watch List but that NSA had told Jack Marsh, supra,

that specific names would have to be furnished by the agencies

interested in the particular subjects.

RE: TRUTH SERUMS

The Bureau has received inquiries recently concerning the reliability

of the so-called truth serums. The Bureau is not in possession of any information

concerning the use of drugs or chemicals which will compel a person to speak only.

the truth. The Bureau, however, will not tolerate any experiments or participation

on the part of its personnel in

the utilization of the so-called truth serums or

other chemicals alleged to have a similar effect. All employees are accordingly

cautioned against any participation whatsoever in the utilization of truth serums

or similar drugs in connection with any cases.

Obviously, great criticism would be directed at the Bureau if it utilized

any element of this kind in connection with its investigations.

The Bureau cannot

jeopardize its good reputation by even considering the utilization of such an

investigative procedure and, consequently, in the event any Bureau agent violates

ALLINFORMATION CONTAMER RES. INTERVIEW OF FORMER FBI

SPEGIAL, AGENT (SA) JOSEPH WILLIAN MAGEC

HERE ING UNOLASSIFICO

BY AN SSC STAFF MEMBER

The following concerns an interview of Di. Joseph

William Magee, a former FBI SA who retired in 1965, by an SSC

Start Member.

On January 2, 1976, Magee advised Chis Bureau that on

a Friday, about september 1o,

he was telephonically contacted

by a Mike Epstein of the SSC who indicated a desire to talk to

him innediately.

Magee told Epstein that he was quite busy and

would not be able to see him immediately. The only information

Epstein gave as to the reason for wanting to interview Magee was

to get information about the early organization of the FbI

Laboratory.

There followed some further telephone calls between

the two but they never got together for an interview at that time.

However, on December 29 or 39,

1975, Epstein again called llagee

and asked Magee to appear at the SSC office for interview on

January 6, 1976.

The only information Epstein gave on this

occasion as the subject matter of the interview was that it

would be about the operations of the Bureau.

On January 2, 1976, the Legal Counsel Division of this

Bureau determined from ipstein that the topic of interview of

Magee would be FBI Laboratory procedures and practices and, in

general, background information concerning FBI Laboratory operations.

On the same date Magee was advised by this Bureau of Epstein's

Assoc. Dir, advice concerning the subject matter of the interview.

With Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

Re: Interview of Former FBI Special Agent (SA)

Joseph Willian Magee by an SSC Staff Member

Magee was released by this Bureau from his confidentiality

agreement for purposes of the interview.

On January 1, 1976, Magee voluntarily furnished this

Bureau the results of the interview which are as follows, not

necessarily in chronological order.

Interview took place on January 6, 1976, and Epstein

was the sole interrogator.

The interview was very informal,

most of which took place in a coffee shop in the Dirksen, Senate

Office Building, and it lasted little more than a half hour.

Magee was not advised of his rights.

The following subject

matters were covered. Epstein inquired as to whether the FBI

had had a drug program. Magee responded by asking it Epstein

meant a program relating to the use of truth serum and Epstein

responded in the affirmative.

Magee told him that the FBI did

not have such a program but that during the 25 years he had

been with the Bureau, there may have been some very selected

occasions when truth serun may have been used, but that he had

no specific knowledge of such use.

never knew of any FBI SA also being a medical doctor and that he

did not believe that an SA would ever have injected anyone with

a truth serum. Epstein voiced surprise that the FBI was not

aggressive enough to have a truth serum program in connection

with its use or the polygraph

Epstein next inquired as to what the FBI did relative

to vulnerability studies:

Magee told him that he did not know

what Epstein was talking about.

Epstein elaborated by stating

that in the 1960s, Gentral Intelligence Agency (CIA) allegedly

conducted surveys such as spraying chemicals in a subway station

to see if it could be sabotaged in this manner.

Magee answered

that he knew of no such type of activity by the FBI and did not

think the FBI would ever engage

in such activity.

With Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

Re:

Interview of Former FBI Special Agent (SA)

Joseph William Magee by an SSC Staff Member

upstein inquired concerning the relationship between

the FBI and CIA.

Magee told him that he knew at one time the

who was the liaison link with CIA, that person

being former SA Sam Papich,

Epstein wanted to know if meetings

between Papich and the CIA were primarily for the FBI's benefit.

Magee responded that

he did not know much about the liaison

arrangements and meetings but it was his belief that such meetings,

as may have been held between FBI and CIA personnel, were desighed

for the mutual benefit of all parties and that he did not know of

any meetings which were designed solely for the FBI's benefit.

Epstein inquired as to what the FBI did relative to

certain gases,

the exact type unrecalled by Magee in his report

on this Intcrview.

Magee responded that some FBI

Sas possess

gas masks to be used for obvious reasons but that the FBI had no

programs for use of gas.

Epstein asked Magee what he knew about Martin Luther

King, Jr. and whether he, Magee, had ever heard any recordings

concerning King-

Magee said that he had not but that he under-

stood that the FBI had recordings of King which were bona fide,

Magee then told Epstein of his recollection of an obscure news

story of an event in North Carolina a number of years ago when

a numb do of sent that obe and shat the news accole indicated

that no prosecution was authorized by the Department of Justice,

associates.

NOTE:

Magee's report of the interview was telephonically

furnished to Supervisor S. F. Phillips of the Senstudy 75 Project.

NOTE:

SECRET

Samuel Adason Jaffe was a symbol number informant

of the New York Office from 1958 to 1961 and was later in

contact with the Washington Field Office, During these

periods of contact, Jaife furnished information on his numerous

contacts with Soviet and People's Republic of China officials,

which were occasioned by his employment with ABC and CBS and

with other news media. & (U)

Following his identification by Soviet defector

to Moscow, Jaffe was extensively interviewed and advised that

he believed he had been the subject of a recruitment approach

but denied being a KGB agent. Our relations therearter were

conducted with caution in viey of sarny's" allogations and

he is not currently being contacted.

Jaffe filed a request under the Freedon of Information

March, 1975, and subsequently appealed our denial oi

to information concerning him as contained in our files.

Jaffe has alleged

that the FBI, or his association with the FBI,

has prevented him from obtaining work in the news media field.

This allegation is not supported by any material contained in

his file.« (u)

The material being turnished the senate Committee

represents all information contained in Jaffe's main file,

with certain exceptions which are explained in the memorandum

to the Conmittee.

There are also some 200 to 250 references

which are not being furnished following an agreement between

Testimony before Senate Select

Committee on Governmental Operations

with Respect to Intelligence Activities

by J. Brooke Blake, November 21, 1975

Dear Mr. Phillips:

On November 21, 1975, I met Committee attorney-investigator,

Robert K. Kelly at Room G-308, Dirksen Senate Office Building,

Washington, D. C.

He suggested we have lunch in the building

cafeteria.

During those thirty minutes he spoke in generalities

about the Committee's work and I was able to keep the conversation

on a theme of my asking about his background and current activities:

He did ask if I knew Roy Moore.

He was informed I knew Roy in

Birmingham

and that he was one of a very few "trouble shooting"

inspectors who traveled throughout the United States as agent in

charge of major case investigations. He asked my opinion on why

Roy and I answered my guess was his experience and ability to

rally agents. I explained the latter as Roy Moore being the type

boss for whom most agents enjoyed working.

Throughout Lunch and

the deposition Kelly seemed infactuated

Ward and Kelly were the only persons present throughout the

at 2:07 p.m. and ended at 2:52 p.m. (Kelly gave me the-attached

the deposition was taken surprised, but didn't bother me. It

could catch someone off guard if strong cross examination developed.

"Kelly informed me of my constitutional rights, the right to have

a senator present and the right to request a senator and/or attorney

at any time throughout the deposition. He had hinted while walking

to the room of an interest in how Klan informants are developed and

Bureau policy. He did not have a form on my rights or any form for

me to sign. After his advisement, I advised him I had been briefed

by the FBI only on procedure and the limitation of the waiver of oath

not answer policy questions because I had been out eleven years, and

of the availability of the Bureau executives to answer those questions.

He explained a notary would be waiting to notarize my deposition when

I stated that I would only allow the oath

she gave me to apply to the fact I was the person who gave the deposition.

He agreed. The preliminary conversation and advisement of my rights was

not recorded to my

knowledge. Apparently he predicated the inquiry as

the result of Rowe's testimony and to corroborate same. He made it clear

Rowe was most complimentary to the Bureau and all agents he knew.

'Set forth below are briefs of his questions and my answers:

• (He was using a statement or memo of about six pages which recorded

testimony from Rave:?

A - He reported in person, in writing, and by telephone depending

on the urgency of the information. All information received

from him was recorded in FBI files and disseminated to local,

state and federal authorities on a

"need to know? basis.

l - Instructions by me to Rowe as to what information he should

report?

A - All information, with main interest in intelligence activities

discussed by action groups.

Q - My knowledge of any interest regarding an arrest record for Rowe?

A - None recalled nor did I ever recall seeing a rap sheet on him.

O - Any actions of violence which were planned which he reported to me

and what was done with the information?

A - None recalled, only evidence recalled was a report of another. Klansman

carrying blasting caps on his person while at a Klan convention.

This

information was disseminated to fellow agents on the scene with me

surveilling the convention.

Q - Rowe claimed that I had told him about the Bureau's activities in

A - His statement had to be false because I had never heard of the code

A - No, but elaborated he was well aware of the FBI's interest in

solving the various bombings throughout Alabama.

Q - My reaction to the fact that Rowe was a member of the Klan's

Security Detail and one of Bobby Shelton's bodyguards?

A - Explained that the fact that hevelevated in the Klan's ranks was

a concern of mine and the FBI's! We wanted him put where he would

be able to furnish valuable information, but restrained him from

rising to any executive position in the

Klan.

Q - Testimony that Rowe had given the Committee that there were certain

Birmingham police officers who were involved with the Klan?

A - Because of the general possibilities, any information he furnished

was disseminated only to certain known reliable police contacts.

I pointed out to them the delicate nature of most of Rowe's

information

and the fact that it could not be disseminated

by memo, form to all department employees of any agency.

Q - Another question regarding attendance at political meetings with

the direction that Rowe persuade the Klan to take a certain position

'for candidates?

A - No such directions ever made.

I - What was the scope of Rowe's assignment as a Klan informant?

A .- To obtain and report any or all intelligence information he could

determine:

Q - Any directions given Rowe about Matt Murphy, a candidate for police

commissioner in Birmingham?

A - Was not at all familiar with Murphy other than hearing the name by

Kelly who commented. from his memo that the question

pertained to

something that occurred after I left the FBI.

Q - When I was assigned to handle Rowe what was my recollection of his

reputation and value to the FBI?

A - That he was known to the Department of Justice and the FBI as the

top Klan informant and that he was in the position to furnish vital

information to the government.

Q - Any special instructions I recalled on how I was to handle him?

A - I was to maintain control over him and recognize that by his

personality that if his control was not maintained that he was

the type that would run off because of his enthusiasm and put his

safety in jeopardy. He was also the type who would try to run

the show if you let him.

Q - Any recollections I had to the "Mother's Dayd incident?

A - I had only heard of the incident, but was not with the Bureau in

Birmingham.

& - Did I ever direct Rowe while he was in the hones of Klansmen to

attempt to steer them to certain rooms in the house while they

engaged in conversation?

A - No.and. commented that they rarely discussed anything of value in

homes or Klan

meeting halls, but did so in small action groups.

A - I did not see any particular difference from his example and that

of a Klansman planning to bomb a building.

These were the only questions I recorded in note form as he asked

There may have been a few others, but none of any significance

and Kelly appeared very cooperative and matter of fact throughout the

deposition.

Ward and Kelly escorted me back to Room G-308 where I was

asked to swear to the deposition by a Notary Public, Audrey Hatry. I

informed kelly that-I-hoped this would be the last time I would see him

on-this matter and he responded he was "pretty sure it was".

Please express my appreciation-of-the manner in which the FBI

helped me after I secured assistance, particularly the people in the

Congressional Affairs and the staff

in your division.

RE: DECEMBER 18, 1975, LETTER TO THE

ATTORNEY GENERAL FROM SENATORS

MONDALE AND BAKER

On December 22, 1975, the FBI received a copy of a letter dated

December 18, 1975, which Senators Mondale and Baker sent to the Attorney

General levying certain requirements on the FBI with a request that the

responses be provided the SSC during the last weck of December, 1975,

and the first week of January, 1976.

Item 2 contained a request for any information refuting the

suggestion made on page 34 of the General Accounting Office's September 24

report to the House Judiciary Committee, that cases in which violence can

be predicted probably represent less than two percent of all FBI domestic

intelligence investigations.

Page 34 of the September 24, 1975, report of the Comptroller

General before the House Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Constitutional

Rights concerning FBI domestie intelligence operations contains the following

statement: "There were only 12 instances--or less than 2 percent-in which

the FBI obtained advanced (sic) knowledge of planned activities on the part

of a subversive or extremist group or individual." This statement appears,

both in form and content, to be somewhat different from that contained in

your letter of December 18. One can predict violence when leaders of an

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: DECEMBER 18, 1975, LETTER TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAT

FROM SENATORS MONDALE AND BAKER

The FBI is very reluctant to draw any conclusions from these

General Aecounting Office's statisties, and we maintain no records or

statistics which would either refute or substantiate the inferences which

you apparently draw from their interim report. The two percent may

represent hundreds of citizens' lives and thousands of dollars in potential

property damage. It may only represent one lite - a policeman, a eitizen,

perhaps a President or public official. How does one measure the value of

this type of information? Surely not solely in terms of percentages.

You should perhaps consider the base from which the General

Accounting Office apparently drew their statistics. Their interim report was based

on their review of 676 FBI domestic intelligence cases under investigation during

Calendar Year 1974, in ten varied U. S. cities. Over 50 percent of these 676 cases

were admittedly only preliminary inquiries. These were limited investigations

designed primarily to fully identify the subject through established sources

and to ascertain whether that subject was in fact associated with an extremist

group or organization, or was likely to engage in violence himself. That

little advance information of planned violence evolved from these limited

investigations is not surprising. Most of the information concerning planned

violence would normally come from well-established informants in groups

and would not likely show up in these individual case files.

Also, had the General Accounting Office used as its base the

years of greater incidence of domestie violence, such as 1967-72, the figures

might have been appreciably different.

Item 3 was a request for any analyses of the General Aecounting

Office's September 24, 1975, report.

The FBI has not prepared any analytical memoranda or any analyses

of the preliminary findings of the General Accounting Office as presented to the

Houso Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Constitutional Rights on September 24, 1975.

RE: DECEMBEE 18, 1975, LETTER TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

FROM SENATORS MONDALE AND BAKER

The General Accounting Office report of September 24 was

an interim report hurriedly prepared to respond to a congressional request.

Neither the FBI nor the Department of Justice was afforded the opportunity

to review this report for substance or to have comments included prior to

Its delivery to the Congressional Committee.

The General Accounting Office originally planned to submit

its final report in November or December, 1975; it is now expected in

January, 1976. The final General Accounting Office report will include

findings, conclusions, and recommendations based on a review of the full

900 domestic intelligence case sampling and a voluminous amount of

additional material. The EBl and the Department of Justice have been

assured of the right to review this report prior to its issuance and to have

comments included where appropriate. Any FBl analyses will be conducted

after receipt of the General Accounting Office's final report.

FINIS UNGLASSEEIEE

2 ALMIEHL

We have been asked to chair a special subcommittee

of the Select Committee on Intelligence which will con-

centrate on matters relating to domestic intelligence

activities of the Federal

government.

Our mandate is to

prepare for the full committee's consideration a draft

report of findings of fact on alleged abuses or excesses

by the FBI and other domestic intelligence agencies; the

causes of such

alleged abuses or excesses and recommendations

which the Committee might make. to remedy the problems we

have uncovered.

We are aware of the fine work in which your staff has

been engaged in these areas and hope that they will be

available to work with the Committee staff on these matters.

However, the Subcommittee finds the Committee record needs

to be supplemented in several important respects and

there-

fore finds it necessary to direct a number of requests to

the FBI for further information which we hope will be

treated on a priority basis so that the Subcommittee can

meet the deadlines set by the full committee.

These and

future requests which wiil be handled between the two

committee counsel or Mr. Elliii, Domestic Task Foice Leader,

ana tir. shaneen, Special Counsel for Intelligence Coor-

dination, will pertain to both information necessary for

us to formulate meaningful recommendations and to pursue

matters on certain specific alleged abuses which remain

unsettled. Among the future requests will be questions

pertaining to your guidelines on "Domestic Security Inves-

tigations"

and on manpower and budget statistics for the

FBI's domestic intelligence program.

For us to meet the deadline set by the full committee,

it'i essential that the information requested below be

Attached is one draft copy of testimony to be delivered on

Wednesday morning, 9/24/75, by the Comptroller General Elmer B. Staats,

before the House Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on Civil Rights and

Constitutional Rights, chaired by Congressman Don Edwards of California.

Attachment consists of a 16-page opening statement, supplemented by

appendixes, containing: 1) a statement setting forth GAO's verification

proposal; 2) correspondence among GAO, House Judiciary Chairman

Peter W. Rodino, Jr., and Attorney General Levi, concerning GAO's

verification proposal; 3) a statement entitled, "FBI's Domestic Operations--

A Perspective," outlining the fundamental authority for FBI operations,

Bureau administrative structure and procedures, as well as statistical data

on security investigations between 1965 and 1975; and 4) a 33-page analysis

of the legal authority for FBI domestic intelligence operations.

GAO offered us an advance copy of Mr. Staats' testimony with the

proviso that it would accept FBI suggestions and minor corrections but

would not make any substantive alterations in the draft. We have reviewed

the draft, and GAO has made some technical changes at our suggestion.

From a substantive viewpoint, while we take exception to GAO's phraseology

in certain instances, as well as to certain factual conclusions and inferences,

four overall reading of this material is that it represents an effort on GAO's

part to present an objective picture of FBI operations.

in his prepared stetement, Vr. Staats will offer the following

conclusions and observations:AUo

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re: General Accounting Office (GAO) Review of FBI Operations

2. GAO's staff which reviewed FBI-prepared case summaries

concluded that the use of summaries, supplemented by follow-up interviews

with FBI Special Agents, provided "...a good understanding of what occurred

in each investigation."

3. Because GAO's verification proposal was not adopted, it

was unable to provide Congress with full assurance of the accuracy and

completeness of summary information that the FBI provided.

4. The legal authority upon which FBI domestic intelligence

operations are based is ambiguous, and it would be appropriate for Congress

to specify such authority.

5. Legislation specifying FBI authority in the domestic security

area should address the issue of what role GAO should play in assisting

the Congress to carry out its oversight function.

The material described above comprises GAO's opening testimony

f for the morning of 9/24/75. GAO has indicated that it will furnish the FBI

material prepared for delivery in the afternoon on that date when it is completed.

We expect that GAO's afternoon testimony will be considerably more detailed

and that the draft submitted to us will be more critical of FBI domestic intel-

¡ ligence policies and practices. We will evaluate this material upon receipt.

Reference INTD memo, dated 9/18/75, captioned as above, concerning

congressional testimony on FBI domestic security intelligence investigations to

be delivered on Wednesday morning, 9/24/75, by Comptroller General Elmer B...

Staats.

Attached is draft copy of testimony prepared by GAO's staff for.

delivery by Mr. Staats on Wednesday afternoon, 9/24/75: As was the case

with the draft of Mr. Staats' morning testimony, GAO has furnished this

document with the understanding that it would entertain suggestions for

minor corrections but would not make substantive alterations. We have been

informed that the attachment was prepared under an exceedingly short dead-

line. Hasty preparation is evident from our preliminary evaluation, and,

although the draft is critical of certain aspects of our domestic security intel-

ligence investigations, we do not consider this document to be an articulate

or incisive statement.

Nevertheless, the draft does raise issues which may be the

subject of follow-up inquiry, particularly with reference to investigative

sources and techniques. Under the subheading "Sources and Techniques

Used During an Investigation," on pages 8, 9, and 10, reference is made

to the use of school and telephone company employees as confidential sources,

access to postal and passport records, pretext interviews, COINTELPRO-type

activity, and surreptitious entries in cases reviewed by GAO. In addition,

reference is made at the bottom of page 9 to information derived from

ryclostri@lectionic surveillance coverage which appeared in cases reviewed by

GAO. However, GAO's testimony fails to indicate that the information

referred to was completely derived from overhears. Consequently,

the testimony may create an erroneous impression with respect to the

use of electronic surveillances in these cases. We are working with GAO

to have the draft altered to avoid misinterpretation with respect to the

use of electronic surveillances.

Re:

62-56866

In his afternoon testimony, Mr. Staats will make the following

observations and recommendations:

1. Few would deny the necessity for the FBI to conduct domestic

security intelligence investigations, but there should be clearer guidelines

governing their purpose and scope.

2. The Office of the Deputy Attorney General should be charged

with the responsibility for ensuring that the FBI complies with guidelines

which might be issued by the Attorney General rather than diffusing this .

responsibility among various divisions of the Department of Justice.

3. As suggested by the Rockefeller Commission, there should

be a mechanism created either in the FBI or in the Department of Justice to

evaluate and analyze the results of the FBI's domestic security intelligence

investigations.

4. Although only 16 of the 676 cases reviewed by GiO (3 percent)

were referred to a United States Attorney for prosecutive opinion, in 43 percent

of the cases (291), the FBI was able to establish that the subject was a leader

or a member of a subversive organization or was prone to violence.

5. FBI field offices are not fully consistent in the manner in

which they conduct preliminary inquiries and frequently do not conclude

the inquiry within the allotted 90 days.

FBIHQ personnel are continuing to review the attachment, and

we anticipate consulting with GAO's staff on Monday morning, 9/22/75, to

discuss any changes deemed necessary.

On Wednesday, 9/24/75, Comptroller General Elmer B. Staats

testified in public session before the Subcommittee on Civil Rights and

Constitutional Rights of House Committee on the Judiciary. His testimony,

and that of several assisting GAO officials, was based on their preliminary

review of the FBI's domestic intelligence operations.

A copy of Mr. Staats' revised prepared testimony is attached.

The Committee convened in Room 2141 of the House Office Building

(Rayburn Building) at 9:23 a.m. Mr. Staats read his prepared testimony and

answered some questions until approximately 12:25 p.m. The Committee

reconvened for questioning at 1:52 p.m., and adjourned at 3:03 p.m.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re: General Accounting Office (GAO) Review of FBI Operations

62-56866

Verification

The Comptroller General read from his prepared testimony and was

interrupted occasionally for questions. The initial pertinent comments and questions.

I by Chairman Don Edwards were directed at eliciting a statement from Staats

that the denial of direct access to FBI files for the purpose of independent

verification was unique in GAO's audit history and that, because of this,

¡GAO was unable to completely assure Congress as to the accuracy of their

survey. GAO indicated they still felt that they had valid audit. They were

afforded the opportunity to interview FBI officials and case Agents and had

no reason to doubt the accuracy of the summaries. They were not impuning

the motives of the FBI or the Attorney General in denying access; they under-

stood the principle involved, but insisted that verification was necessary.

Mr. Edwards mentioned the House may subpoena the necessary FBI files to

permit verification. Mr. Fogel of GAO replied that GAO would prefer the

files on which summaries were prepared be shipped to FBI Headquarters

where the GAO could conduct their random verification proposal.

GAO strenuously disagreed with Attorney General's opinion

that GAO's audit authority was limited to access for the purposes of conducting

financial audits and Congressman Edwards was critical of the Attorney General's.

failure to correspond with Congress subsequent to 6/25/75.

FBI-Prepared File Summaries

Mr. Staats stated that GAO's testimony and preliminary review

was based on 676 FBI case summaries in the Subversive and/or Extremist

field out of a projected 899 from 10 FBI field offices. In response to specific

questions from Mr. Drinan, he and Mr. Richard Fogel, GAO, indicated that

GAO had received more than the 676 summaries (they had received as of

9/24, 852 out of 899), but that in order to prepare for testimony, their analysis

was based on the 676. Drinan attempted to establish that the FBI was

delaying or dragging its feet in providing the other summaries. GAO

replied that most FBI field offices have been extremely cooperative in the

time-consuming job of preparing summaries. (GAO did not identify publicly

the FBI office which they did not consider completely cooperative--Springfield.

Because of manpower limitations and other case demands on Springfield, this

office has completed only 68 out of a projected 90 summaries. Springfield has

indicated they will make every effort to complete all 90 summaries not later

than mid-October.)

Legal Authority

GAO testified that the FBI did have legal authority to conduct domestic

intelligence investigations, but that this authority was in definite need of clarification,

las its basis is in some instances shrouded in ambiguity.

Miss Geraldine Rubar of the GAO Legal Office discussed with

precision the Presidential Directives, the 1936 Hoover memoranda and the

various statutes conferring authority. Mr. Drinan loudly stated his opinion

that the FBI was operating for forty years in this field without legal authority

and asked to be shown where the term "extremists" appeared in any Presidential

Directives or statutes. Miss Rubar replied that the term was not in vogue at the time

but that it was used by Attorney General Ramsey Clark in a 1967 memorandum to the

FBI when he ordered intensified investigation and coverage in the area of

black nationalist groups.and extremists.

Mr. Drinan repeatedly, but unsuccessfully, attempted to get

Miss Rubar to state the FBI had no investigative jurisdiction in the Subversive

and Extremist field even to the point of inquiring if even one of GAO's staff

attorneys had perhaps reached that minority opinion. Miss Rubar replied

that there was agreement among GAO's legal staff that the jurisdiction was

there but was in need of clarification and updating.

Initiating Investigations

Mr. Staats testified that, from GAO's reading of the FBI Manual, there

was a degree of vagueness as to the type and amount of evidence needed to

open an FBI investigation in the Extremist and Subversive field. GAO

arbitrarily categorized cases into those opened on the basis of hard,

medium or a soft degree of evidence and said 36 percent of the 676 cases

reviewed were opened on a "soft degree" of evidence.

Mémorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re: General Accounting Office (GAO) Review of FBI Operations

62-56866

Congressmen Dodd, Drinan and Badello expressed specific

interest in the "soft" area. In response to their queries, GAO Auditor Fogel

listed several instances where, based on summaries, GAO believed the

opening of preliminary inquiries by the FBI field offices was subject to

¡question. Among these were:

1. An instance where cases were opened on two individuals

on information provided the FBI by local police that two high school youths

were present in the courtroom at a trial of an extremist. (There was no

indication by GAO in their testimony as to whether the police had identified

these individuals as high school youths, or whether the preliminary inquiries

conducted by the FBI so identified them.)

2. An instance where the FBI opened a case on a husband and

wife on the basis of having seen their license plate outside the home of a

New Left functionary where a social party was in progress. (Again, there

was no indication by GAO in the testimony as to whether the FBI knew it was

a social party at the time the preliminaries were opened or determined this

-subsequently .)

3. A case was opened on an individual who expressed an interest

in applying for membership in a group considered extremist or subversive by

the FBI.

4. A case was opened on an individual who telephoned a member

of an extremist group.

5. A case was opened on a person who parked his car outside a

convention of a subversive/extremist organization.

6. A case was opened as a result of a mail cover on an individual

who corresponded with a national officer of a black extremist organization.

7.

A case was opened on an individual who attended a meeting of

the press committee of a subversive organization.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re: General Accounting Office (GAO) Review of FBI Operations

. 62-56866

All of the above were enumerated as examples of FBI field office

exercising judgment and discretion in opening cases based on "soft" evidence.

Congressman Badillo took loud exception to this and said he saw no basis for

opening cases in any of these instances and referred to them as "no basis" cases

rather than soft.

GAO advised they were not prepared to make a positive recommendation

on these cases (36 percent) at this time but, in their final report, they would

address this issue. GAO indicated it could be an area where the FBI might review

and more carefully define criteria.

Organizations

Congressman Drinan took exception to the use of terms in the

FBI Manuals, such as extremists and black and white hate groups. He stated

these are basically people pursuing their goal of racial justice. He then asked

for GAO to list some of these organizations which the FBI characterized as

"Extremist." Mr. Fogel then named the following:

-

The Ku Klux Klan

The Minuteman

The American Nazi Party

The Black Panther Party

The Nation of Islam

Mr. Drinan made no further comment on this subject.

Preliminary Inquiries

GAO pointed out that 73 percent of the preliminary inquiries

received went beyond the 90-day FBI Manual Limitation and that in 68 percent

of these cases, FBIHQ was not advised and had no opportunity to review or

possibly terminate the investigation. Congressmen Dodd and Drinan claimed

the FBI was, therefore, not following its own rules. GAO offered no

explanations as to why field offices might go over the 90-day limit, such

as matters requiring special investigative effort and attention, such as the

bombing cases, Hearst case, Pine Ridge Indian case, which affected offices

under audit.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re: General Accounting Office (GAO) Review of FBI Operations

62-56866

Programs, Sources and Techniques

GAO enumerated the programs, investigative aids, sources,

and the techniques utilized in FBI investigations. For the most part,

these elicited no abnormal interest, but it was apparent the Committee will

follow this subject in GAO's final report and in the event any FBI officials are

invited to testify, they will be subject to intensive questioning on COINTELPRO,

surreptitious entry, and mail openings

Regarding sources, Drinan critically referred to "the Army of

informants" and wanted numbers and payment figures which GAO could not

supply. Drinan also expressed interest in Counterintelligence (Espionage)

Matters which GAO declined to discuss and stated it was not a part of their

mandate to review those matters.

Miscellaneous

The Committee inquired as to why the FBI was unable to provide

mone precise accounting figures on time and resources devoted to specific.

areas.. Mr. Staats advised that in his experience with other agencies, the

FBI's position was unusual; but that it was an organization which required

flexibility and SACs had to be able to shift resources on a short notice.

He indicated there apparently had been no prior need in the FBI for the

modern management accounting system, but that one was now under development.

GAO witnesses followed the prepared text with respect to Depart-

mental guidance, Attorney General's guidelines, dissemination of information,

file maintenance and destruction, the Rockefeller Commission's recommendation

for the development of an analytical capability for domestic intelligence matters.

In the opinion of the writer, the tone of questions and statements

of Messrs. Drinan and Badillo were very critical of the FBI, and on occasion •

that of Mr. Dodd's. These Congressmen repeatedly attempted to put words

in the Comptroller General's mouth and to twist his statements to their own

liking. Basically, Mr. Staats and the GAO witnesses stuck to their prepared

statement and their amplification was in basic support of this statement.

Re: General Accounting Office (GAO) Review of FBI Operations

In particular, these critics attempted to get Mr. Staats to state

that, in view of the few statistics pointing toward prosecution and conviction,

that the FBI's investigative effort in the domestic intelligence field was a waste

of taxpayers' money. Mr. Staats refused to so state and indicated that the cost

effectiveness of FBI coverage and penetration of subversive and extremist groups

was very difficult to measure. He said one could not tell how much violence

was deterred by FBI coverage or the knowledge on the part of subversives

and extremist leaders that their identities were known and activities were

under FBl scrutiny

News media coverage diminished by more than half after the

noon recess. The writer overheard one media reporter state to a TV

technician they had the option of returning to cover the afternoon session,

(but they were not because "it was another Drinan circus."

The Committee thanked Mr. Staats and GAO for their "excellent"

report and indicated they anticipated receipt of the completed written report

in November, 1975.

None. For information.

Reference is made to the testimony of FBI Director

Clarence M. Relley before the SSC on December 10, 1975, Daring

this testimony, certain questions arose on which answers were

deferred.

Set forth hereinafter are the unanswered questions

along with the responses thereto.

Senator Howard H. Baker, J5., inquired as to Director

Kelley's feeling concerning an Inspector General concept

extending Governmentwide.

Senator Baker asked the Director to

think about the question and furnish his thoughts at a later

Upon reflection and consideration of the question,

Director Kelley has decided it would be inappropriate for him,

as Director of the FBI, to comment concerning the need for a

national Inspector General as it would affect any agency other

than the FBI.

Senator Gary Hart stated that although higher

authorities had been alerted to the existence of Counterintel-

ligence Programs (COINTELPROS) in one or two instances,

terms of the bulk of the Programs there was no systematic

information flowing upward through the chain of command to

former Director Hoover's superiors.

indicated the SSC had received testimony that the existence of

the COINTELPRO effort against the llew Left had not been made

known to higher authorities and asked if Director Kelley had

any information in this regard. Director kelley asked for an

opportunity to substantiate the notification provided by former

Director Hoover to higher authorities.

With Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

While no systematic report was made on a regular basis

authorities the fact the FBI was engaged in neutralizing and

disruptive tactics against revolutionary and violence-prone

groups. This documentation is as follows:

1. Briefing of the President.

.On November 6, 1958,

Director Hoover presented to President Dwight Eisenhower and the

Cabinet an oral briefing entitled "Curcent Communist Subversion

and Espionage in the United States, 1958." Included in the

presentation material

was a description of the Bureau's effort to

Intensity any contusion and dissatisfaction among its (Communist

to further this goal. This particular effort was referred to as

one of several programs to counteract resurgence of Communist

Party influence in the United States. In November, 1974, former

Assistant to the Director Cartha D. Deloach advised he recalled

Bureau's activities against black militants.

4, Notification of Attorneys General.

A letter was

directed to Attorney General William Rogers in 1958 specifically

advising him our COINIELPRO had been initiated against the

communist Party in August, 1956, and citing examples of techniques

utilized. In 1961, a letter was directed to Attorney General

Robert Kennedy enclosing a memorandum citing examples of COINTELPRO

actions directed against the Communist Party, In 1965, a letter

sent to Attorney Genexal Nicholas Katzenbach advising him

the FBI was seizing every opportunity to disrupt the Ku Klux Klan.

Attorney General Ramsey Clark was furnished, in 1967, a letter which

enclosed a detailed memorandum outlining our efforts

to neutralize

and disrupt the Ku Klux Klan.

In September, 1969, Attorney

General John Mitchell was advised of our efforts to disrupt the

Klan.

Additionally, former Assistant to the Director DeLoach

advised in November, 1974, he had briefed former Attorney General

Ramsey Clark regarding the various COINTELPROS and he also

expressed the opinion that former Assistant to the Director

Alan Il. Belmont or former Assistant to the Director William G.

Sullivanhad briefed Attorney General. Katzenbach.

Bureau files reveal that

off-the-record use by former Director Hoover In connection with

several

appearances before the House Subconmittee on

Appropriations.

Material concerning the COINTELPROS was prepared

for the Director's use in connection with Appropriations testimony

for the fiscal years 1958, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1963, 1966 and 1967.

All this material was clearly marked for off-the-record discussion.

Published transcripts of hearings by the House Subcommittee on

Appropriations contain notations that on at least six occasions

between 1958 and 1966, off-the-record discussions took place at

those points in Mr. Hoover's prepared remarks dealing with the

COINTELPROS:

Former Assistant to the Director John P. Mohr

advised in November, 1974, he recalled the Director on several

occasions had furnished details to the House Subcommittee on

Appropriations relating to FBI COINTELPROS..

In November, 1974,

Assistant to the Director Nicholas P. Callahan advised he, too,

recalled several instances involving oft-the-record discussion

by the Director with members of the House Subcomnittee regarding

thereto.

An FBI Headquarters supervisor who was assigned

responsibility for COINTELPRO matters during the period 1964

CORNELPRO

to 1967 recalls that on a number of occasions he was required

to prepare informal memoranda and summaries relating to COINTELPRO

actions.

It was his understanding this material was to be

utilized by Director Hoover in connection with briefings of

various Government officials.

A review of FBI files has not located any document

indicating higher authority was formally advised of the existence

of the COINTELPRO effort directed against revolutionary New Left

elements. It should be pointed out the program that targeted

the New left was only in existence during the period 1968 to

1971 (35 months) and only 285 actions were approved, which

represent approximately 12 percent of all actions approved in the

basic COINTELPROS.

Additionally, during the time period of the

New Left program this Bureau was engaged in extensive reporting

and dissemination of information relating to activities and

violence perpetrated by revolutionary elements, including the

so-called New Left.

The Chairmany Senator Frank Church, inquired as to how

much time and money is being spent by the EBl in conducting

Investigations on possible Presidential appointments to Federal

oftices, plus any other intormation which would indicate what

proportion of the FBI's time and effort was absorbed in this kind

of activity.

Senator Church also asked the Director to supply

the number of such investigations conducted each year beginning

with 1970 and also information as to what offices are now

covered by such investigations.

Where possible, steps have been taken to insure that these cases

are kept to an absolute minimum. It is noted prior to July,

1973, the fBi conducted investigations concerning nonprofessional

positions In connection with deparcmenta applicant/u. S. Court

applicant investigations, such as general clerical personnel.

It was determined and agreed upon that these investigations could

be handled by the Civil Service Commission and, therefore, they

were transferred to that agency.

A manpower utilization survey conducted during March,

1975, disclosed that 2.3% of field investigative time by FBI

personnel was being devoted to these applicant-type investigations

conducted for other Government agencies.

This low percentage

is indicative of the Bureau's efforts to hold down applicant-

type work to that essential and necessary to meet our various

commitments in this field,

We have and will continue to oppose

legislation seeking to involve the FBI in routine applicant-type

investigations.

INFORMATION CONCERNING

Jaffe is a former New York Office informant

Who was a correspondent for CBs and ABC.

Waile with AsC,

he was stationed in Moscow from 1961 to 1965. During this

assignment ho was compromised by the KGB through &

relationship he had with a Soviet female and because of a

car accident.

Jaffe reported the subsequent recruitment

effort by the KGB to both the V, S. Embassy and to

New York.

le admitted to New Yorl that ho had a continuing

relationship in Moscow with seveial KGB officers, but

denied that he furnished them anything In 1904, a soviet

defector reported that daite had beon recruited by the sus

in about 1961 and thercatter furnished the KGB with

information about other Americans in Moscow. Our investigation,

including two intensive interviews of Jaite, neither

substantiated or refuted the defector's allegation.e

Our evaluation of Jaffe's relationshin with the

KGs is that after his admitted compromise he undoubtedly

cooperated to a degrce, simply to avoid being expelled

froM MoscoW because of

the damage it would have caused

to his then advancing career.

he was eventually expelled

in 1965, ostensibly because of an unfavorable article

written by ABC Correspondent John Scall about the Soviet

leadership.

We have never uncovered any evidence that

Jaffo assisted the kgs after he left Hoscow. u

informant during the 1950s and 1960s, reporting on his contacts

with Soviet nationals, *the article is generally factual and

does not touch on Jaffe's allogation as to a leak. On 1/21/76,

Jaffe telephoned SA Richard Kinsey of the Intelligence Division

(SA Kinsey had participated 1n an interytew of Jaife on 11/24/75,

on Deputy Associate Director Adams' instructions to hear out

Jaffe's allegations).

Jaffe was concerned because an unnaned

"New York Times" reporter had interviewed him on the same day

and Inferred ho had Information that Jatfe was a paid EBI

informant.

Jaffe wanted to know if we had so advised either the

Senate or House Committees since the reporter clained to have

seon documentation that Jaffe had received money from the ist.

Jaile was advised that he could not be furnished information

as to what we had furnished the Committees but that he knew

Whether of not he had received money fron us. Jaffe said that

he was concerned that we had leaked additional derogatory

information concerning him. U

While it is possible that the "New fork Times"

reporter has had access to jaffe's tlle as furnished to the

senate or house committees, it is not believed that we have

sufficient evidence of this in order to make a complaint to

either Committee, based only on what Jaffe reported as to

the reporter's background for his inquiry of Jaffe. u

Our records disclose that Jaile was never paid, either for

services or expenses during the period he was operated as a

symbol number informante

It is now almost one year since the inception of the

inforasation, our regular destruction prograd, as approved by the

ITational, Archives and Eccords fervice, is designed to prevent retention

of wasses of records wall beyond the period during which they may sowve

approved by the Mational archivist, percits the destruction of those

records which are deaned to no longer possess evidentiary, intelligence,

or historical value, the oratoria 1, Which was vot expecied to lack as

long as it has, has created substantial ad ainistrative burdens not only

at I EI Dezöquarters but thronghout our 59 field offices.

The suscension

of sound records manage sent and file destruction practices in any arzao

is causing very substantial space and storage prolle as.

I, therefore, now propose, with your concurrence, to

reste that portion of our racords destruction prograo which, in reality,

could not have been contemplated by the Cenate leaderslip's roguest in

the first instance.

Ve would continue the destruction oratoriu i on all

classifications of files thich would fall within the general description of

security files." These would cacompass all files on comestic intelligenco

watters, extreprise cattera, racial matters, as well as forelyn counter-

intelligence subject matters.

We would, with regard to such "security

satters, " destroy duplicative naterial only.

The matters that we propose to resucno routine destruction

of, in accordance with our previously established Lecorãa Letention Flan,

are the followings illas relating to eri sinal Investigations, cuitability or

applicant-type investigations, correspondence files, and tiles of an

adsinistrative nature generally. Should you or any tier-bers of your

Dear Mike:

Information has come to the attention of the

Committee which indicates the possibility that the FBI

conducted heretofore undisclosed electronic surveillance

of personnel of the executive office of the President

(possibly a Deputy Director of the Budget Bureau) and that

this information was included on a list of names of persons

subject to FBI electronic surveillance prepared for Attorney

General Elliot Richardson in or about July 1973.

Therefore, the Committee requests all material

in the possession of the Justice Department or the FBI

which may bear on the above. Please notify me by phone

when any such material may be available.

On December 3, 1975, Douglas Frank Durham, who

confidentially furnished information to the FBI concerning

extremist activities of the American Indin Movement (AIM)

until publicly identified as an FBI informent in March, 1975,

contacted our Minneapolis Division and furnished information

which chould be brought to your attention.

He said on May 7, 1975, he was interviewed by

strong desire to discredit the FBI and asked if he, Durham,

could "come up with some dirt" on the FBI becaure there was

strong support to "nail the FBI to the cross." Thir interview

took place in the Washington, D. C., office of Reverend John

Adams of the United Methodist Church. Adams, tho was present

during the interview, paid Durham cransportation and other

expenses, plus $125 in testimony fees. Adams appeared to be

very anxious to "personally smear the FBI."

Adams has previously Elen
