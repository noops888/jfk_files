EXAMINATION BY COUNSEL FOR THE COMMISSION
BY MR. MANFREDI:
Mr. Sturbitts, will you state your full name for the
record?
A
William C. Sturbitts.
Q
Mr. Sturbitts, do you recall when we spoke some
weeks ago you signed a document entitled, "Advice and
Waiver"?
A
Right.
Q
You understand that document is still in effect?
A
Sure.
Q
Mr. Sturbitts, by whom are you currently employed?
A
You mean the Agency or
Q
That is right.
A
Central Intelligence Agency.
Q
And what is your current position with the Agency?
A
I am a Special Assistant, Latin America, for
Economic Intelligence Collection and Operations.
Q
And would you briefly review for me the history of
NW 50955 DocId:32275518 Page 4
SECRET
Photocopy from
Gerald Ford Library
SECKET
3
your employment with the Agency?
A
When I first came in I was in the Intelligence
Directorate for approximately ten years and I was put on special
detail, special indefinite detail, in the Deputy Director, Plans,
which is now the Directorate of Operations.
Q
What year were you put on that detail?
A
I guess it was 1964, January, I believe.
Ω
And what did that detail involve?
A
Cuban operations, economic warfare.
Q
And how long were you on that detail?
A
I was in the Cuban operations for nine years.
Q
Between 1964 and. 1973?
A
(Nods in affirmative.)
Q
And in 1973 did you assume your current position?
A
Yes, January.
Q
Now, while you were on special detail to the DOD?
A
Yes.
Ω
Were you stationed in Washington?
A
Yes.
Q
And did you commute with some frequency to Miami?
A
Yes.
Q
Were your activities in Miami in any way connected
with the operations of the Miami Station?
A
In some way. My responsibilities were worldwide.
I took temporary duty predominantly in Europe, and then Miami.
NW 50955 DocId:32275518 Page 5

Most of my operations were run out of Europe.
Q
Run out of
A
Europe. Some were run out of Miami but the big ones
were run out of Europe.
Q
Well, in the course of your activities with respect
to Cuba did you have occasion to become familiar with the
operations of the Miami base?
A
Yes.
Q
And the situation in the Cuban community in Miami?
A
Yes, sir.
Q
During the nine years you were with DDO's Cuban
operations, who was who were the chiefs of the Miami
Station?
A
I think in 1963 Ted Shackley was the Chief and he
was followed by I can't think of his name. I should know
it. Well, I will come back to that.
Q
Then, the next Chief of Station was Paul Henze.
What years was he Chief?
A
I think Paul was there about a year and a half. He
left in 1968 when we reduced the size of the Station. Let's
say Henze was there from 1966 to 1968. And then Jake Esterline.
He was Chief of Station from 1968 to 1973.
Q
Now, what was the formal title of the group to which
you were assigned for the 9-year period?
A
Well, when I first came in it was known as the
NW 50955 DocId:32275518 Page 6
SECRET
Photocopy from
Gerald Ford Library
SECRET
5
Special Activities Staff. It was headed by Desmond Fitzgerald.
And then, I believe after that it became the Cuban Operations
Group.
Q
Now, was this a special group within the DDO or was
it attached to one of the area divisions?
A
No. Following the Bay of Pigs, they created a thing
called Task Force W which was headed by Bill Harvey. And
that when Harvey left, he went to Chief of Station, Rome,
and Fitzgerald took over, it became Special Activities Staff.
It wasn't attached to anything except it reported to the
Deputy Director, Plans.
Q
And that was Mr. Karamessines?
A
Yes. Well, it was Helms at that time back when it
was first created. Helms was DDP at that time.
Q And Task Force W was created immediately after the
Bay of Pigs?.
A
Well, not immediately. I think sometime around
in the Bay of Pigs was in April. I think this was created in
September, something like that, 1961.
Q
And that subsequently became the Special Activities
Staff?
A
Special Activities Staff and consequently became the
Cuban Operations Group. As the Cuban Operations Group it went
back into the Western Hemisphere Division.
Q
And what was the date of that reorganization?
NW 50955 DocId:32275518 Page 7
SECRET

Gerald Ford Library
SECKEI
6
A
Well, let's see. I would say that was probably around
1965 because Fitzgerald then became Chief, W.H., and then
later DDP.
Q
Now, Mr.Harvey do you recall what position Mr.
Harvey held after he left Task Force W?
A
Yes. He was Chief of Station, Rome.
Q
And is he still with the Agency?
A
Oh, no. He retired a long time ago.
Q
Do you know where he lives at the present time?
A
Frankly, I don't. I have an idea where he lives.
He went to work for a friend of mine who had a law firm.
Harvey is a lawyer.
Q
Indianapolis area?
A
Yes, some place around there. It is in the midwest,
Indiana.
Q
What was the role that was assigned to Task Force
W?
A
It was the overall Cuban operations.
Q
Did the Miami when was the Miami Station estab-
lished?
A
Well, I think they had a forward operatio-s base down
there about 1960 which was small, in Coral Gables.
Q
This was, then, prior to the Bay of Pigs?
A
Oh, yes.
Q
Now, in addition to Task Force W, was the Miami
NW 50955 DocId:32275518 Page 8
SECRET
Photocopy from
Gerald Ford Library
SECRET
7
Station running any operations against Cuba?
Q
You mean prior to the Bay of Pigs?
A
Yes.
A
I really don't know. It was a small it was a
forward base and it was more or less as I recall, a support type
thing.
Q
Well, after the Bay of Pigs when Task Force W was
established, did it have sole responsibility for Cuban
operations?
A
Yes.
Q
Or was that shared with the Miami base, Miami
Station?
A
No. The Miami Station was under Task Force W.
Q
All right. Would that also be true of the Special
Activities Staff, the Cuban Operations Group?
A
Right, except that at the present time the Station
has no Cuban operations.
Q
I understand that. When were Cuban operations termi-
nated?
A
At the Station? Let's see. Sternfield went down
there in 1972. It was during fiscal year '72. I think it was
in early 1973. It was a gradual reduction.
Q And have those operations been terminated entirely
or are they now run out of the Washington area?
A
All Cuban operations are run out of Washington.
NW 50955 DocId:32275518 Page 9
SECRET

There are no more paramilitary operations, that type of thing.
Q But there are some Cuban operations being run out of
the Washington area?
A
Right.
Q
Is that correct?
A
Right. Worldwide.
Q
Mr.Sturbitts, in the last couple of weeks you may
have seen some allegations in the press about possible assassina-
tion attempts that have been mounted or alleged assassination
attempts that have been mounted
A
Right.
Q
against Fidel Castro. In the course of your
activities with respect to Cuba, did you ever learn of any such
attempts?
A
Well, let me answer it this way. I wouldn't say
attempts. I know there was discussion. "Attempts" is too
strong a word.
Q
Well, can you place in time your first knowledge of
any such discussions?
A
Well, the first knowledge I had of any discussions,
I was on TDY and this was October, November, 1963, with Fitzgerald
in Paris. And I knew that he was going to meet let me put
it another way. I had overheard that discussions were going on
with a member of Castro's military but that he wanted, as
I recall, he wanted some British I mean Belgian rifles and
NW 50955 DocId:32275518 Page 10
SECRET
Photocopy from
Gerald Ford Library
SECRET

a telescopic sight.
Q
Who wanted them?
A
This military guy that was in Fidel's I think
at one time he was a commandante. Now, I knew that was going
on. I didn't participate in it because I was there for another
reason. And I know that subsequent to that time that Fitzgerald
met with him again and as I recall, as the personal representa-
tive of the Attorney General, Bobby Kennedy.
I provided all those files. There are 19 volumes that
we gave to your people. But I don't know who was reviewing
them. I think Belin was going to do it himself.
Q
Yes. He is. He is doing it himself.
You said there were 19 volumes of documents with
respect to this.
A
19 files, manila.
Q
All having to do with possible assassination?
A
All having to do with this whole time period and
can we go off the record for a minute?
(Discussion off the record.)
BY MR. MANFREDI:
Q
The first knowledge of such conversations that you
had, I take it you obtained on a trip to Europe with Mr.
Fitzgerald?
A
I simply overheard it, that is right.
Q
And who were the parties to the conversation you overt-
NW 50955 DocId:32275518 Page 11
SECRET
Photocopy from
Gerald Ford Library
SECRET
10
heard?
A
A fellow named Nestor Sanchez.
Q
And Mr. Fitzgerald?
A
Yes, and I really can't recall some of the other
people. We were we had just moved the Station at that time,
in Paris, out of the Embassy into the old Rothschild Palace
and we felt that it was probably bugged, so all conversations
took place we walked around the garden and tyat type of
thing, and, you know, I was walking with somebody, somebody
was in front of me, and you just overhear conversations.
Q
This was in Paris?
A
Yes.
Q
I see.
Mr. Sanchez was he a member of the military?
A
No. Mr Sanchez was in the Special Activities Staff.
He was stationed in Washington. And he was in contact with
Cuban military-type.
Q Was it your understanding that the Agency had received
instructions with respect to this activity from another
component of the Government?
A
Well, let me put it this way. I don't know whether
they received instructions. I have to assume, and I am pretty
positive, that this was a result of a Special Group decision.
And at this time you have to remember that Bobby Kennedy was
overseeing this deal, presumably for his brother, and he was
NW 50955 DocId:32275518 Page 12
SECRET
Photocopy from
Gerald Ford Library
SECRET
11
part of that Special Group. He called the meetings, he presided,
he did a number of things.
Q Were there any other occasions that you can recall
in which the possibility or the subject of assassination of
Fidel Castro was discussed?
A
No, not really.
Q
You referred to this as the first occasion.
A
This is the first
Q
Was there a second?
A
the first time I knew about it or even heard it
discussed.
Q
Well, prior to the investigation that is currently
underway I am referring now to our Commission's investigation
were there any other occasions in which this subject came
to your attention after this discussion in the garden in
Paris?
A
The only other thing that came to my attention was
that the decision was made not to provide him with this sight
that he wanted. Whether that is right or wrong, I don't know,
but that is what I was told.
Q
When did you learn that?
A
Oh, I would assume in must have been early 1964,
around February, something like that.
Off the record.

MR. MANFREDI: On the record.
BY MR. MANFREDI:
Q
Mr. Sturbitts, are you familiar with a gentleman by
the name of Frank Sturgis?
A
Indeed.
Q
Is your familiarity based on what you have read in
the press?
A
No. It is what is contained in the files.
Q
Have you caused a search to be made of CIA files,
particularly the files of the Western Hemisphere Division,
in an attempt to determine whether Mr. Sturgis ever had any
connection with the Agency?
A
I have.
Q
What were the results of that search?
A
Absolutely no connection, never has been.
Q
When we talk about connection, are we talking about
an employment relationship?
A
That is what I am speaking of.
Q
Was Mr.Sturgis ever an independent contractor of
the Agency?
A
No.
Q
Was he ever a contract employee?
A
No.
Q
Was he ever a regular employee of the Agency?
A
No.
NW 50955 DocId:32275518 Page 14
SECRET

Q
Was he ever hired to do any piecework for the
Agency?
A
Not to my knowledge.
Q
Do you know whether or not Mr. Sturgis ever partici-
pated in any type of paramilitary or other operation against
Cuba?
A
On his own behalf he did, not on behalf of this
Agency.
Q
How did you learn of those operations?
A
Through the newspaper. And through FBI reports.
Q
Now, are these recent FBI reports?
A
Oh, no. These go back I know at one time, the
thing that comes to mind, I think he made a leaflet drop
over Cuba and this was subsequently reported in the press and
by the Bureau office in Miami.
Q
Do you know who financed his activities?
A
I have no idea.
Q
Is it possible that Mr. Sturgis' activities were
indirectly financed by the Agency through
A
I don't see how. Frank Sturgis is a soldier of
fortune has been. He has constantly tried to associate himself
with the Agency. When I went through his file they wanted me
to classify the file and the way I classified it was "don't
destroy it, he is an intelligence nuisance."
Q
Off the record.

(Discussion off the record.)
MR. MANFREDI: On the record.
BY MR. MANFREDI:
Q
Have you caused the Agency records with respect to Mr.
Sturgis to be assembled in any one location?
A
Yes. Ihave custody of them.
Q
And what is the volume of that material?
A
As I recall, there are five volumes. Your Committee
called for them the other day after the article in the paper,
I guess it was last Saturday. They called for them Monday and
they returned them Monday afternoon.
Q
Do you know who examined those files?
A
No, I don't.
Q
You indicated a moment ago that Mr. Sturgis contacts
the DCD office in Miami with some frequency, is that correct?
A
Well, not great frequency but he does with tidbits
of so-called information.
Q
Is this information limited to narcotics, alleged
narcotics traffic?
A
Recently it has been.
Q Has Mr. Sturgis been encouraged by the DCD office
in Miami?
A
Mr. Sturgis has been told by the DCD office in Miami
to take his information to the Drug Enforcement Agency or the
FBI.
NW 50955 DocId:32275518 Page 16

Q
Do you know whether or not they consider him an
established contact?
A
No manner.
Q
Do they have any do they periodically seek to
collect information from Mr. Sturgis?
A
I can't speak to that but the records that we have
don't reflect anything like that. Before they would contact
somebody in that context, knowing that there is a 201 file
on Sturgis, they would have to coordinate with the Latin
American Division before they did anything since we do hold
the file.
Q
Would you briefly explain what a 201 file is?
A
A 201 file is a personnel file. It consists of any
information relating to an individual appearing in the press
as a result of other agency reporting and that type of thing..
Q
Personnel or personality file?
A
Personality file, I should say. Excuse me.
Q
Do you know whether or not there is any connection
or relationship between Eugenio Martinez and Mr. Sturgis?
A
Well, I will say this. Obviously, they do know
each other. They have to know each other from their days
in Cuba.
Q
Do you know whether or not Mr. Sturgis ever partici-
pated with Martinez in raids against Cuba?
A
No. As I recall, we employed Martinez around 1961,
NW 50955 DocId:32275518 Page 17
SECRET
Photocopy from
Gerald Ford Library
SECRET
16
I guess, and he was in our maritime activities. He was a
boat captain eventually. And he did participate in infiltrations
and exfiltrations and perhaps one or two raids, hit and run,
sabotage-type actions against Cuba. Sturgis never engaged in
any of these things. He never did it for us nor did he ever
do it on any of our boats, planes, or anything that belongs
to the Agency.
Q
When Martinez would run such an operation or captain
a boat on such an operation, would he be charged with putting
together his own crew?
A
No. He had an assigned crew and every boat had a
Case Officer operating either out of the probably out of
the Miami Station. Sometimes I would assume that we did have
some people in the Key West base. But he, Martinez, would receive
his instructions and briefings from his Case Officer.
Q
So it is likely that he could have brought Sturgis
along on any of these operations?
A
Absolutely unlikely. Oh, the guy whose name I was
trying to think of, Chief of Station, John Dimmer.
Q
And that would be for a period of time between
Shackley and Henze?
A
Yes.
Q
1964 to 1966?
A
Something like that.
Q
Would you describe briefly for me the nature of the
NW 50955 DocId:32275518 Page 18
SECRET
Photocopy from
Gerald Ford Library
SECRET
17
activities conducted by the Special Activities Staff during
your and subsequently the Cuban Operations Group during
your 9-year tenure with those groups.
A
Well, there was it was an across-the-board
intelligence operation consisting of collection of foreign
positive intelligence, counterintelligence, paramilitary
activities, covert action, economic activities. That is about
the breadth of the thing.
Q
Now, these were all conducted through the DDO?
A
Right.
Q
Now, let's speak for a moment about the paramilitary
operations. Were these operations run out of southern
Florida?
A
Right.
Q
And in particular out of the Miami Station?
A
Yes.
Q
Were there any other CIA facilities in that area of
the country that participated in these activities?
A
Not to my knowledge..
Q
Were there any southern harbors other than Miami
that were used in these activities?
A
Well, we had activities down in the Keys also. As
I said, we did have a Key West base.
Q Were there any other bases in that area of the
country that were utilized in these operations?
NW 50955 DocId:32275518 Page 19
SECRET
Photocopy from

SECRET
18
A
Well, not that I would call a base. We did have
training facilities for the UDT teams.
Q
What is a UDT team?
A
Underwater demolition.
Q
Where were those bases located?
A
I frankly don't know. They were down along the Keys,
along that long peninsula going down there. There were a
number of sites. I really can't recall them.
Q
Were there any other sites within the United States
in which paramilitary training was conducted, for people
participating in these activities?
A
Not to my knowledge.
Q
Where were these people trained?
A
What do you mean?
Q
Well, Cubans who participated in these activities.
A
We trained them at these places we had in the Keys.
Q
Now, there also some of them were brought up here and trained
at the Domestic Training Station.
Q
Where is that located?
A
That is down in Virginia.
Q
Were any CIA personnel actually involved in these
raids?
A
Occasionally, I would think that you have got to
understand at this time that we had a great many contract
employees, independent contractors and this type of thing.
NW 50955 DocId:32275518 Page 20

Most of the paramilitary operations and the training was
conducted by the Special Operations Group which is another
entity of the
Q
DDO?
A
DDO.
Q
Now, the facilities that we have been talking about,
training facilities, were manned, then, by the Special
Operations Group, or at least supervised by the Special
Operations Group, is that correct?
A
Well, supervised, yes, and I would think that probably
some of the training was given by their people. The Domestic
Training Station is under the Office of Training and but I
would think that in the paramilitary field that the SOG would
probably staff the training facility with their people who have
the expertise in paramilitary operations.
Q
Now, were the people that were being trained at
these facilities basically Cuban refugees?
A
Yes.
Q
And at the outset I take it not many of those people
were American citizens?
A
No.
Q
Or had become American citizens.
A
I would assume a great many have.
Q
By this time.
A
By this time, yes.

Q
At the present time, how large is that Cuban community
in Miami? Do you have any idea?
A
Well, it is extremely large. I would think it is
probably I was trying to think. I would say up towards a
military people.
Q
You spoke about paramilitary operations and covert
action. How do you distinguish between those two categories
of activities?
A
Well, actually one can fall into the other. The
paramilitary could fall into covert action but in those days
we did distinguish somewhat. A lot of the covert action was
media placement. We had a number of operations at legal-
type operations, harassment operations. For instance, Fidel
seized a great many art treasures and in particular he had a
Napoleonic collection which was supposed to be the finest in
the world that he sold to dealers in Europe. He had paintings
that were immensely valuable that he tried to have auctioned
in London and the London auctioneer would not accept them
because he obviously didn't have clear title to them. He was
they were stolen, in the eyes of the auctioneer. He was
forced to auction them in Toronto, Canada.
We ran legal operations, got the owners and had them
hire attorneys and bring them to court and this type of thing.
He seized these race horses. He tried to peddle them
in Europe and up in Canada. We ran opposition against that
NW 50955 DocId:32275518 Page 22

21
type of thing.
Q
These were what you considered to be covert operations?
A
Yes, covert action.
Q
Now, this is what you were referring to, legal-
type operations?
A
Yes.
Q
You used legal process to harass Castro.
A
Yes.
Q
What other types of harassment activities did you
run that would fall under this covert action category?
A
Well --
Q
Would economic warfare be
A
That was sort of something separate unto itself.
This was the economic warfare aspect of this thing was a
decision of the Special Group to enforce an economic blockade.
Q
What special group is that?
A
It is now called the Forty Committee.
Q
Is that 302 Committee?
A
Well, it was a 302 at one time, too. First of all,
it was called the Special Group, CI, Counterinsurgency. Then
it went to the 302 and then it had another name in between
there and now it is the Forty Committee.
Q
All right. We will return to that a little bit
later, but what other types of harassment were you running
against Castro
NW 50955 DocId:32275518 Page 23
SECRET
Photocopy from

SECRET
22
A
This is what I was trying to think of.
Q
that would be considered covert action?
A
Well, as I say, a lot of propaganda, press placement,
media placement. It has been so long ago I really don't
remember. I know we had a number of things going against him.
We used suasion, moral suasion, otherwise. We did some
extra-legal things. We tried to get to his sources of supply,
particularly when they were countries that we had treaties
with, NATO countries, Canada, this type of thing.
Q
Let's talk about each of those in turn. You said
you used moral suasion. What kind of activities are you
referring to?
A
Well, in the moral suasion field we actually, we
were the catalyst in this whole thing and we had the legal
activities, the legal well, I don't know how you would
phrase it, but we operated under the Cuban access control
regulations of the Treasury Department, the Trading with the
Enemy Act, and we also used the facilities of the Department of
Commerce, the export Control people.
I guess as you are aware, Cuban industry was totally
U.S.-oriented. As parts began wearing out and this type of
thing, Castro had his little people there running around trying
to place orders with subsidiaries of U.S. companies. Where
we would find this out through all-source intelligence, we
or the Treasury people or the Commerce people would go to the

executives of these American companies and ask them to tell
their foreign subsidiaries not to provide the spare parts
and the other things that Castro might need. We had the
Department of Commerce we identified 600 of the major U.S.
companies that could provide spare parts for Cuban industry.
We had the Department of Commerce send letters to those 600
manufacturers and ask them to cooperate with them in denying
any spare parts to the Cubans. This was a fairly concentrated
effort to really isolate them.
Q
All right. And that is what you were referring to
as moral suasion?
A
Yes.
Q
Anything else in that category?
A
Not really. None that I can think of.
Q
Did you make the same kind of efforts with foreign
companies?
A
At one point we did but it was absolutely useless,
the point in case being the Leyland buses. We pulled all stops
to stop that sale. The British Government turned us down
flat.
Q
Now, did you attempt to reach any other sources of
supply?
A
Well, we also had what we call a preemptive purchasing
program. If there was a single source of supply for a
particular item we would go in and buy it to deny the Cubans

the market.
Q
Would that then be re-sold somewhere on the domestic
market?
A
Yes.
Q
domestic market?
A
No. It would be re-sold abroad.
Q
In all cases?
A
The cases that I was associated with, it was all
sold abroad.
Q
What kind of purchases were made?
A
Well, we purchased at one point we purchased
some Bright Stock in Antwerp.
Q
What?
A
Bright Stock.
Q
What is that?
A
Heavy, heavy oil, and since Cuba 85 percent of
her energy comes from oil, this was considered a critical
commodity. Bright Stock can be oh, it is almost like tar,
melted tar, and it can be cut into additives, lubricants, this
type of thing, and this was critical to the Cuban economy. So
we had an oil firm purchase this Bright Stock from a dealer for
which we reimbursed the guy and the Bright Stock was eventually
sold in Africa.
Q
Do you know of any sales of such materials that
were made within the United States? Resales, I should say.
A
No.

Q
In addition to preemptive buying were there any
other actions taken by this group with respect to sources of
supply to Cuba?
A
Well, we did provide through third country agents
who got orders for Cuban goods, in collusion with the Commerce
Department, and I would assume the Special Group, we had
replacement parts manufactured that were substandard.
Q
And you had them sold through foreign companies?
A
Well, we had our agents get the Cuban orders all
over Europe. Then they would come back and, as a matter of fact,
the former Secretary of Commerce, who is on your Committee,
and I met him and he gave us the go-ahead to do this.

Mr. Dillon?
A
No. He was Secretary of the Treasury.
