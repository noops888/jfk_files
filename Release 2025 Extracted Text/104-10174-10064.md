MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief/E/1B/S

SUBJECT:

Project WUBRIN& Possible Operational

Support of Madrid Station Objectives by

Edward G. TICHBORN (P)

REFERENCE:

OSMA 23, 350 Dated 1l January 1968

1. Per Mr. Long's request, the undersigned on 30 January 1968

discussed with Edward G. TIGHBORN (P) possible support of Madrid

Station objectives as raised in ref. It was confirmed that:

a.

WUSALINE/Iberia can be used as an information collection

mechanism in cases where information requirements can be couched

in plausible economic and commercial terms for contractual surveys.

b. TICHBORN can assess and develop selected Spanish contacte

of Madrid Station who may be visiting New Yotk and who desire

introductions in US commercial circles.

c. TICHBORN can develop Spanlards in New York as may be

of operational interest to the Madrid Station. TICHBORN has not

made an effort to develop Spaniards in New York but is willing and

able to do so for any designated as operational targets. If desired,

TICHBORN thinks he can meet the Spanish Ambassador to the U.S.

through a friend, Senator Jose Montoya of New Mexico.

d. TIGHBORN feels that he could write an article concerning

leading Spanish industrialists and bankers for publishing in a pro-

minent publication, such as "Life International." TICHBORN

believes that he has excellent bonafides for such a task because

he previously published in "Life International" a four page spread

on birth control in Latin America. This article was favoradly

reviewed.

TICHBORN suggested a related article on the pupula-

tion explosion in Europe and its effect on business as a possible

topic for interviewing leading Spanish businessmen. TICHBORN.

as a result of journalistic collaboration with Katherine Anne

Porter, is represented in New York by a top literary agent,

Monica McCall. TICHBORN thinks that it would take him two

to three weekg in Spain interviewing top Spanish industrialists

and bankers. He would send letters in advance to these targets

Informing them of his proposed itinerary, the purpose of his

trip, and enclosing copies of his previous articles with favor-

able reviewer commente. He could be essentially a free lance

journalist or have a business purpose as well. In the latter

connection, it is of interest that following TIGHBORN's trip to

Spain, WUBRINY/l sent a geologist to WUSALINE/Iberia to look

into acquisition of silver properties in Spain. This purely com-

mercial development appears to be a direct result of TICHBORN's

trip and thus enhances TICHBORN's commercial bonafides.

2. It is understood that E/IB/S has a copy of TICHBORN's report

for dispatch to the Madrid Station per ref.

3.

Personnel concerned with Project WUBRINY will be glad to

work with E/IB/S in any follow-up to the possibilities noted above.

recent information on ICAP Iberia, S.A, to E/13 for transmittal

to Mr. Day In Madrid. Mr. Day would reviev this information

SERjECT: Information about Spaln (and Portugal)

1. I have a request which seems to me to be right up the alley

of your friend, WUBRINY/l, I would hope, therefore, that he will try

to do us a fairly rapid and yet analytic job.

2. The request is for as accurate information as possible on

the following questions:

What or who, or both, represent the most significant

power elements in the economic or commercial field in Spain

today? Wherever possible, even in the cases where potent

companies have been named, specific individuals having the

positions of authority should be identified. In addition, where-

ever possible, relationahips between these individuale and

American interests whether a company or another individual.

should be specified.

bo

What American interests, corporate or personal, have

major investments or holdings in Spain? What are the nature

of their Investments or holdings and who are the individuals

basically responsible?

c.

To the extent possible, provide the sanie answers a8

requested above for Portugal. Since Spain le of greater inters

est, this question should only be answered to the extent posaible

Without too great an expenditure of time. Il on the other hand it

is felt that good answers can be provided with regard to Portugal

given extra dme, I would suggest that the Spanish anawers bu

submitted a soon an possible and the Portuguese Information

given at a later data.

3.

I would appreclate it ll you could let me know as soon ad pos-

sible WUBRINY/l's reaction to the above requesto • can he got the anawers;

will they be in considerable detail and how long does ho think that it will take?

Interested parties at headquarters.

3. Mc. Marshall vanted to check on the financial aspect

of richbora'e (P) trip Bast. He asked if ha would receive an

$500 per veek, or $1,000 Po two woeks.) Expenses covertag thi

REFERENCSS: A. Nemorandun for the Record, 18 January 1961

B. Menorandun for the Record, 23 January 1961

1. In early Janusry ve had suggested to WH/Salvador that

they might tina the services of a political consultant of value

in their area. The Division checked this out with the Station

who sereed ths: It ves an idea worth looking tnto and asked for

addittonal details. This toforustion was farvarded to the field

and In reply, the Station requested that ve send the individual

concerned to El Salvador to assess the political situation and

to glve *bem any related assisrance possible.

?. As a consequence, Mr. Davis contacted Eaverd 0. Tichborn (P)

by telephone and told him of our interest. Due to the Station's

request which ve santed to flll prouptly, and also to Michborn's (P)

persons seredtle (and the possibility that be might receive en

appolatest withts the Adanistration In the near future) we

vanted to set his to Salvador as soon as possible. After con-

sultation vith Pichborn (P) and with the Desk, it was decided that

he tould leave Californla on 23 February and arrive in Salvador

the following saraing.

3. In als telephone conversation, Mr. Davis vas forced to

rely on the systes of "double talking" for the purpose of security.

Jready been mentioned to Tichborn (P) ben he vas In Washingto

on personal matturs in Jaquary (see Ref. B). Mr. Devla also

attempted to "second guess" Richborn'a (P) feelings on thta

assignent when arranging the details with WID. The fact that

he might receive an appointment vas the major factor under

consideration, especially In the sense that first, ve did not

vant to expose Tichborn (P) as a KUBARK agent and secondly,

ve did not want In any way to present Tichborn (P) with any

problems In relation to his possible appointment.

4. Mr. Davis told Tichborn (P) in guarder language bich

was apparently well understood by him that the COS ("our sendor

partner and the Arossedor ("the senior partner of our cousin

firm) would be vitting as to his KUBARK connections and tbat

undoubtedly JUEGCPIANY (an Anerican cut-out and contact of the

Station) and the latter's brother-in-lav JUVAN-1 (a Salvadoren

bustnessman and Station contact vith whom he would be vorking)

vould also be witting. However, as agreed with Wi, the locale

Mr Davls espectally pointed out to Tichborn (P)

that since Wi felt be should talk with the Ambassador, we

wanted hir to be avare of this la the event that this possibility

arose at the Stat lon's request Mr. Devis added that of course

we would not want the Ambassedor to take unbrage, etc. at

Tichborn's (P) vlait or activities and that we had been assured

by soneone (Paul Paxton) who lovs Ambassador Murat Willtans,

that the latter could be counted upon for his cooperation and

discretion.

Tichborn (P) thet asked Specifically whether be

vould, definitely talk vith the Ambassador and Mr. Davls Inforned

him that this would depend upon the Statiod'a Judgnent. (we

had inforned us that this vas a possibility since Willems 1s

new to his post and the Station la trylag to work closely with

him

from the beginning: Wi felt that if Militams later learned

that Tichborn (P) had been in tho area vithout his knowledge,

to request the Ambassador to use our channels for any comminications

6. in had also told us that they might have to taform

the Department of Mchborn's (P) trip to El Salvador and

thea decided that thia vould not be necessary. However, on

23 February, a final decision vas made that this vould beve

to be done esa since C/Wa worke so closely vith State. PAG

did agree to this but requested that thiß Information be in

general terms only and that Tichbor'e (P) name not be elven.

Wi agneed that is could be done in this vay. WI also stated.

that this Information will be passed to Mr. Devine and vould

be limited to hin and Mr. Mann:

Tichborn (P) vus to go to the Interconttnental Hotel and

ralt there to be contacted by either JUEGGPLANY (Jerry

Caughits) or the COS, Ben Stotts. Upon meeting Pichborn (P)

JUECGPIANT, as a recognition signal, would say "I am a friend

of Horace".

8.

Nichborn (P) asked If some expense money could be

provided him la El Salvador and he vas assured that this

would be arranged. Since time (and the airlines strike)

did not permit bis coming to Washington for & detalled brief-

ing on the political situation in Salvador and on his specific

mission, these matters plus the funds for expenses will be

handled by the Station.

9. Two cables were sent to the field concerning the

subject of Tichbor's (P) artval In El Salvador (DIR 26346,

OUT 76088 and DIR 26522, OUT 76527). These cables spelled out

richbarn's (P) cover, the need for spectal discretion on the

art of those individuals who are witting of his relationship

1. On i February Edward G. Tichbor advised me that in lifting

his bag out al a taxi on his return trip from Cuba; he suddenly felt

a pain in the groin and was afreld thet he had a hernia.

2.

On the vay to the airport he asked me if thore would be anj

chance of the Government picking up his medical expenses in the eveat

that he actually had a herate which required any subatential treatent:

I told him at that tine that I did not know what the Goverment's

position would be, but that I would check toto the matter and let hin

know.

3:

On 2 Pebruary, I contacted Mr. Vernon Turner, SSA/DDS, end

explained the circumstances to him. At that time, I ado pointed out

that as far as the provisions of his contract vere concerned, it was

stated that be was not an employee of the U. S. Government and while

it did not make specific reference to redical payments while he vas

working for us, it did not specifically preclude such payments.

Mr. Turner opined that although the contract stated bo was not an

employee of the U. S. Goverament, in actual Pact during the period ho

vas doins our bidding, be was.

I went on further to explain to

Mr. Turner that in all probability ve will call on Tichborn to do

futwe services for un

ful that this reimbursement from us egualed what he would make ta

his regular lay practice.

Mr. Turner stated that there were a number

al ways that ve could allerate his situation showid it become

MEMORANDUM FOR THIS RECORD

SUBJECT: Edward G. Tichborn (P)

1.

Os the morning of l4 September I called Tichborn and arranged

to meet bin at his office at 1230.

As an ettachment to this memo

I have outlined the standard approsch which was followed in Tichborn's

Instance; therefore, I will not go further into it.

2.

Tichbor struck me as beins extremely quick, intelligent, very

sympathetic to my suggestions and andous to cooperate. Be is ar

Nexican descent, speaks Nexican/Spanish fluently and according to hin

can essily pass as a Medean. Tichborn has spent considerable time

over the yeach in Mexico as vell as attending the University af

Mexico for a year or tro. Be bas also traveled to Cuba and is a

friend of Jahn Manson, head of Screen Gem, Inc. which 1s the Columbia

Pictures outlet for Mexico. Mr. Manson is personally nown to me and

night, at sometime, be of use to us. I shall not delve into fichborn'g

political alstory as that will be outlined in his PRa, Part I when

1t arrives. He is presently being urged to run for Congress from

the los Angeles district; however, he has not as yet made up his

mind what he will do.

• In the period of three hours that I was with Tirkborn,

as extremely impressed by his and feel sure that be would do a

excellent joo of brieling any individuals that we might desire him

to brief.

Ian also sure that if he was sent out on a IDY he vould

acquit himself In superlor fashion. Michborn is called upon fron

time to time to give advice on the handling of Mexcen/American

problens and show the grest appreciation at the difficulties of

dealing with Latin Amertcans, their great sense of foliticelmmorality.

their inferiority camplex and ul their unfound but nevertheless anti-

gringo feeltags. Tichborn vas particularly interested in the situation

In Cuba and asked my opinion of it.

My comment in essence was that

201. 253203

## Page 79

It seemed pretty obrious that Costro was extremaly emotional and

tended tovarde being a demigod-tho had von the ver but vas losing

the peace. Tichborn concurred in this opinion, adding to it that

he felt that Castro vas not cogniesnop of the dangers of Coumnten.

Tichborn knous me as Mr. Darkin.

SUBJECT

Utilization of Harpers for Nominal Cover

This memorandum contains a recommendation for your

approval in paragraph six

2. Santo Domingo Station has requested that Edward G.

TICHBORN.

an American Contract Agent of Mexican extraction

who is presently assigned to Mexico Station,

be temporarily

assigned to the Dominican Republic to assist Santo Domingo

in the

period immediately preceding the 1 June presidential

election.

Mexico Station and TICHBORN have agreed to this

assignment and it is proposed that TICHBORN go to Santo

Domingo in the

immediate future to read in on the operations

änd then return to Santo Domingo on approximately I May to

carry out whatever operattonal duties Santo Domingo Station

may assign him.

It is presumed that he would return to

Mexico City shortly after 1 June 1966.

TICHBORN, 46, is bilingual and has a ride range of

business and social contacts throughout Latin Anerica: TiCHBORN

Following graduation from Harvard Law School in 1948,

became affiliated with a law firm in Los Angeles which repre-

sented many Latin American corporations with California

business connections.

In the mid-1950's he became active in

California state politics and served in various capacities in

Democratic Party state and national organizations.

He par-

ticipated actively in the California

gubernatorial campaign

of James Roosevelt, the senatorial campaign of Helen Gahagan:

Douglas and both the 1952 and 1956 Stevenson campaigns

for

President.

He has been President of the Southern California

Young Denocrats, a member of the California

Democratic State

Central Committee, a member of the Host Committee for the

1956 Denocratic National Convention

and a nember of the Board

of Directors

of the National Denocratic Minority. Conference.

In 1960 he served as los Angeles coordinator of the Kennedy

Movement for Americans

of dexican Extraction which, it 18

reported, contributed substantially to the success of the

Kennedy campaign in Southern California.

His only try for

electivo office was in 1959 when he as defeated in his bid

sor the position of California Secretary of Staro.

In late 1959, TICHBORN was hired by the Agency as

a political action advisor for Agency-sponsored election:

operations throughout Latin America.

In 1961 he became a

under present cot a no establt a a deer to deseca City:

under personal cover,

and mobility which would permit him to travel readily on

third country political action assignments.

Since the

beginning of his relationship with the Agency, he has par

ticipated in Agency sponsored operations in Cuba,

El

Salvador, Guatemala, Argentina, the Dominican Republic and,

most recently, in the 1964 election in Chile. At present,

he is engaged full-time in managing a Mexico Station funded

left wing intellectual publication, Dialogos, His cover in

Mexico now is nominal and he

attributes his presence and

interests primarily to his activities in the legal field

He devotes

5.

TICHBORN has contributed stortes,

articles and

interviews

to United States and Latin American publications.

His

major accomplishment in this field has been the publi

cation of an interview with Catherine Anne Porter in a

recent issue öf Harpers magazine.

TICHBORN suggests that

he might be able to arrange viable cover for his temporary

assignment in the Dominican Repubiic by writing to Harpers

and querying their interest in his preparation of an article

concerhing the Donirican Republic political situation and

the forthcoming election.

There is no reason to belleve that

Harpers would turn down such & proposal and, in fact, it 18

belleved they would welcome it.

6.

Recommendation.

The Western Hemisphere Division

recommends that approval be given for TICHBORN's approach

to Harpers to advise them of his planned trip to the Dominican

Republic and request of the magazine an expression of interest

in an

artlele on the present situation in the Doninican

Republic:

This will be done specifically as a cover for bis

travel to Santo Domingo:

In the event Harpers should comnis-

sion hit to do such an

article, TICHBORN will present his

manuscript for Agency approval

prior to forwarding it to

In the event that WH Division or Santo Domingo

Agency, a request for approval of such action will be reterred

to your office prior to taking any action.

the operations of ICAP into latin Amertea and was

looking about for a Latin Anerican specinlist at just

the time that WH Division offered Lopez. It appears

to be a fortuitous meeting of the minds, 1.e., Lopez

apparently has many of the attributes and some of the

background necessary for the position and Train needs

a man, He will be trained by Train and presumably

will devote a good deal of his time to ICAP actlvities.

However, he will be madé available on short notice

Based upon the above, what would be in equitable

contract arrangement, f.e., how much money is Lopez

worth to WH Division when most of his time will

be spent working for ICAP and DODS? DODS 1n-

dicates that after he begins to make a contribu-

tion to ICAP (Probably six months to a year) they

would be willing to pick up a portion of the con

tract costs but they see no justification for such

an action at present.

INTERVITH

COVER, SAG.

At the first moting and the one the next day before I mede the

main trip. y principal local political contact presented a pousble

cost of operations in the coming election. I asked him if it vere a

realistic figure and whether his analysts vere realistic.

He adultted

that it really wasn't and I told him to go back and sharpen hie pencil

and aft down and talk sense. It was therefore agreed that when I came

back from ry trip vo vould at down and go over it district by dietrlot,

nad problem by problem.

He and his political cohort tried to lay out on

Itinerary for me and they recommended the people I would see in each town.

Our boy there dutifully wrote down all these names for me and then ve

very dutifully threw the list avay when it was all over and we started

maiding up our on list. Some of the people you gave me I included in

the list and saw. 4lso, our boy bed a number of people. We both egroed

that this trip would have to be played by sar, since after you arrive

you have a better idea of what you are doing.

The oniy strstegy that

we really agreed on was that I would take a plane and fly from the

south up.

I did axactly that. I flew over to the south and then went on,

smelling around.

I used thrue methodss (1) street intervlew, shop

Interview and in other words, people of no significance, (2) the

Rotary Club routine and (3) talke with lawyers.

Using the first sethod, I would go into a little shop and would

Inquire about how much an article would cost.

If the shop keepur could

speak English we then got Into a conversation, and then I would make

a purcaase:

If he couldn't speak Inglish, then I would go to anothar

shop shere they could. I bought all sorts af odds and ends - a pencil,

a little notebook, a pair of slippors. I bought a pals of sandals

which 1 alant vear beceuse I took the edvice of tan sopto an. renonerd

American all the way.

I vore shoes, socks, sairt and so forth.

a great number of people vero attracted to us, I considered this a good

opportunity for an Intervier. As you low, you talk to one native and

there are five standing around you they will aurround you. If they

speak your lenguage they will perticipate. They won't Interrupt when

sonaone else la talidng, but when he is flaished each one viil goi into

the set; this is wonderful.

And then I did the Rotery Club routine; there are Rotary Clubs all

that they didn't have a list of nambers, alnce I didn't vant to cleim to

be one and then nave them find out that I vasalt on the list! There vas

no menbersbip list, but they did have the nemes of the officers From

tist I picked the nene of a guy sho lived near Detroit and for the ocoasdon

he bevese a very Intimate friend. He vas a doctor and be lived in the

suburbs or some place outaide of Detroit.

I introduced myself as a member

and seld that I bad a very good friend also in the organisation, they could

bave checked it out in their book, Unfortunately, une didn't alvays run

into one of their meetings and luncheons.

The third sothod corcerned courts, lawyers and Bar Associations.,

In

apy toin where there was a court, be it a nagistrate court or a district

court, you alvays found that there was a courthouse and that in it was a

part called the Bar Association; which was a room where those lawyero met

and someche would serve tee or coffee.

If you walked in you would usually

fled at least one lawyer there. I introduced syself in the following

namers I am sorand-so from Detroit, a member of the Bar.

I have

been practising for thirty-odd years and an interested in the judiclal

system and processes of your country. In no time, you have half of the

Ear Association sittin, at the table serving you tes and coffoe (I guess

It was tea because I hate their coffee; I hate coffee and theira is even

worse). I would then start talkang about my trip, my interest in the local

nstional situation, and then start asking questions which I already knew

the ansvers to. For example, "how do you discipline a lavyer, who gets off

baso?"

and they would explatn their nethods of appeal, high court and

hoy the judges are appolated. I had that explained to me a million times.

And every tine they would explads their system to ne, I would tell them

how it is done in our country. I was actaally giving them s lecture on

Anarican Jurisprudence.

I was surprised to hear those lavyors tell mo

udth great pride how able; honest and fair their judges are,

because I

had discovared that officialdon there la as corrupt as all hell. They

explained to se why their judges vere appuinted and about their careers,

and tais gave me a base of operations.

I explained hou in my state, we

elect judges and that this system hag been in existence since the 1800 g

and

we finally decided that that was a hell of a system and that we have

triod to change our constitution so that we could now have the same kind

of system that this little country has. I pointed out that tuere are thinga

they can learn fron us and others that we can learn fron then.

That was the

tochnique.

They were very happy that I could see sonething about them

wbich we want to copy.

As I said before, you lace that the local individual

1s buagty for praise,

to get recognition

and to have sondone say something

nice about bie.

Ho will take It if you can give it to him ulth a shovol;

died a lou yeare ago and I vas a littlo smotionally upeet (which to

true and wasn't hard to eay) and that I was told that one posalblo cure

was to got avay on a long trip and wy son insisted that I take this trip.

It la interesting at firut since you see so many museums, rooms and art

galleries, but it gets boring and I was getting sdos and tired of thlugs

and was about ready

to go home, when I ran Into a altuation that really

Intereste ne - polities. Here lo something that 18 after your own

beart, tbia local altustion. I becere Goddamned curtous. Here vas the

opportunity to tour this country and to put uy trip on a profit basde by

proparing articles on what has happened there, what might happen in the

future and so forth. I made It logical enough. At Mrst I trimmed it

pretty well with a lot of stuff about how I love these people (and that is

true too) •

My experience ith them has been protty much limited to students.

My uxperience with them has niways bean wonderful and I love them. They

were fine young men and women, I still find them to be interesting young

men and women and that I have a natural affinity for them.

They liked

that. I said also that I had a sympetly for their mon, their problems and

their traditions.

In my contaotu throughout the area I maintalned the same story.

was lucky to hit on the right formula in the beftaring and found that it

worked. With very few variations, I stuck to the mely thems.

Very often I would fall into a good intervieu. For example; I was

looking for a small bustnessman with a factory.

I asked a man whare to

find bim and was led to a layer's office. This vas a very fortunate

mistake; a couple of times they turnod out to my advantage.

This Langar

turned out to be a fella who was very well infared and who had previously

been in polities. He vas also close to the Ranan Catholio hierarchy. And

he gave ne an interlow which summarisod the informed opinion that I had

run Into lo that aros. (He also took me to the unversity and introduced

me to the priest who was the head of the schcal. There I had a chance to

interview students who shoved an unwilllagness to adilt that they don't

understand and don't know; that pald off for n.) He characterized the

typical interviev I got from the typical inforaed porson.

In these later

reus I tried to be objective and find out, rather than lnspire answers.

Very frequently, I vould run into some peracn who had a bright boy

galag Into prep school wanting to go to collage, - suggested that he sight

apply for collect and for s scholarship.

I Bald that I vam't an affialal

and didn't kao the assuers, or protend to, but I created the Ingression

that there vas a possibility of applying for acholarähips to the schools,

or even to the V. S. Coverasent. (I actuclly do Intand to find out about

those things and follou it through since they vero vary helpful to so and.

I as very pratorul.)

Thoro waa some truth to what I sald to than and I

wam't sating up storiea out of hule cloth, Thera vas a baalo fos

basicalls it is a fairly truthful story.

I vent to major citles along the bay. off to the alde I went up to

a sanctuary nearby since everyone said that if you didn't go up you veren't

a tourtst and since I wanted everything to look on the level, I nade the

Visit. I stoppod at every village tr I could speak English there I

would; if not, I used this young fellow which vas sometimes satiafactory.

But you see, sometines the villager or the shopkeeper could speak English,

or some idd could and would translate and thay vere wuch more faithful to

the meaning.. The driver got to thinking that he knew what answers I wanted

and that ruined his usefulness. I kept saying that I wanted to low what

they were saying, not what I would ike to have than say; that how can I

wilte a good story if I don't on the truth.

He got to the point where be

was trying to figure cut what I was after and was going to give me the

right answers. Hence I banded him right in the beginning. But i ren

into sons Idds about 13 or 14 years old and used them an interproters;

they were good.

I saw at least a dozen or more of the newspaper publishers

and correspondents, two of the editors of two different Conmunist newspapers,

and I talked with four or five of the Camunist leaders. I also talked

to about five of the secondary people inea political party and one af

the nore important people in the latter. I talked to the Town Chairman

(mayor) In about balt a dozen touns. I also talked lith a local official

and to sars other old-tiners who are not active now, but will be in the

campaign.

I feel that as a result of ny survey I can give a fairly

authoritative opiatan co what the situation 1s, why and what the futura 1s.

I am confident tbat sy reactiona are sound and that my conc)ustons vill

be accurato.

questions Did you experience any control's, anywe seking your name,

otc. In the airport?

Answers Only in the hotels, or when I entered and

left the country. At the hotels you make a full police report. When the

othors whon I ergajed In conversation (and told them what I was trying to

learn) asked where I was going next, I would ask them what they suggested

how far it 18, what was a good hotel, etc. I nould trick then into it.

Thua I trtol to be a littlo naive, I vas only concerned once.

Questions

Did you ever talk voluntarily or involuntarily to anyone who

you knew to bo & Filleshan? Ansvers I talkad voluntarily to uniforneu

cops and asked questicos and directiona.

I chose my questions with great

car.d.

Although It looksd very infarmal, I had it pretty well planned.

Since

each quistica rusgested anotner, it formed a pattern and vas very logical.

I vas a very happy person and lound a lot of things to laugh about and a lot

uf thinga to pralso (tula la ono thing thet I had susgested). Keeping in

mugotclon. I acted very much Asertcen, being all over the place and being

curt ouss but I gave purpose to wy custodity and explained it 1a oach place.

Everyhero engaged people in conversation and gathered other people,

explaining my purpose, interests and why I had such Interesto l tblok

that in each instance I logically explatned w presence and worked lato the

questions that I eskod. I thlak the idea of going to the Comanista

accomplished my purpose. I vas not a subject of interest to the neuspapers,

which I night vell bave been had they had suasicions. I worked out in the

open. In dining roons I would find some oxcuse to say "do you sueak English?"

and unally someche did. "Could you explain something to ma — how ia this

Propared? Ho don't have it in the U.So, ote." Pretty soon to vere atting

and I think they thought that I was checking up on them since they tried

but

I wasn't boing followed. For example, I had the feeling that I had seen

2.

Fron 23 Februsry-3 March 1961 Subject was in Bl Salvador

again at the suggestion of CA Staff air with the approval of WiD and

the Station. Again, Subject's mission vas to provide an over-all

estimate of the fluid political situation. While in that area, he made

numerous political and social contacts of operational Interest and

subsequently made e number of operational suggestions during bis

debriefing at Headquarters. Subject's cover for this mission vas

tourist travel. Headquarters, the Station and the U.S. Ambassador 1n

El Salvador were all extrenely impressed by Subject's ability to assess

the local political situation and to make the necessary contacts with

a minimun of Station assistance. (Detalled reports on both of these

missions are avalläble in CA/PAO {iles.)

Current Status and Future Operational Potential:

Subject brought his family from California to Washington, D.C

where he is expecting to receive a political appolntment probably in ta

field of Latin American affairs. He has suggested that if possible he

would like to be operationally active for KUBARK at the seme time.

Since he will undoubtedly be assigned to latta America (possibly Mexico),

and will have some freedon of action, he feels he could perform vortht

while clandestine services throughout the Latin American ares. Ve

agree. CA/YAG 1s, therefore, arrenging meet lnge for Subject with Will
