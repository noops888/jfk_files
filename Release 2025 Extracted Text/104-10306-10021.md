this refinery would have on Cuban petroleum production and economy

generaily. The Group agreed that such an analysis should be prepared

be presented along with this sabotage operation for Special Group

action at its next meeting.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Minutes of the Special Group Meeting, 9 January 1964

PRESENT: Mr. Bundy, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Gilpatric, and Mr. McCone.

The Attorney General and Mr. FitzGerald were present

for Items l and 2.

Colonel Steakley and Mr. Kiefer were present for Item 3.

1. Cuba - Consideration of Sabotage Operations.

Mr. FitzGerald requested the Special Group to approve a sabotage

operation against the petroleum refinery and storage facilities near

Santiago. The proposal was disapproved.

Another sabotage proposal was made by Mr. FitzGerald against a:

sawmill located on the north coast of Oriente Province.

The attack

is to be conducted by a commando team which will place incendiaries

and demolitions at critical locations throughout the installation.

A second

target, which may be attacked as security factors permit, is

a large floating crane which has been anchored in the area and which

appears to be used in loading ore from a near-by mine.

This operational

proposal with its two targets was approved subject to the concurrence of

higher authority. Also, it was the

consensus of the Group that the

views of higher authority should be obtained on what is desired generally

in the field of sabotage activities in Cuba.

2. Cuba - Proposed Clandestine Intelligence Operations.

The Department of the Army requested approval for two operations:

(a) the establishment of a clandestine net using the Second National

•Front of the Escambray, and (b) the infiltration of a radio operator

agent into Cuba. CIA has agreed to provide support for both these

proposals. The two operations were approved.

Revised January Peripheral Reconnaissance Schedule.

The JRC paper dated 8 January 1964 was approved as amended.

No change was made in the following BOX TOP missions: Jane, Paula,

Ruby, Eric, Marvin, Frank, Dwight, Lloyd, Karl, Everett, and Hugh.

Operations Cliff and Alf were amended resulting in the cancellation

of Operation Cliff. Mission Calvin's track was changed permitting

it to approach the Latvian coast no closer than 25 nautical miles

rather than 20 miles as originally.proposed.

Mr. McCone raised the question of the increasing number of flights

authorized by the JRC. Colonel Steakley said that the nunber of sup-

porting flights required for every reconnaissance platform was largely

responsible for the increase. He also pointed out that there is

currently a review of COMOR requirements for Cuba being prepared

to

determine whether they can be eased in order to permit a considerably

lessened operational schedule:

MEYORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

PRESENT:

Mir. Bundy, Mir. Johnson, Mr. Vance, and Mr. McCone.

General Maxwell D. Taylor, MI. Tionas A. Mari, are

Mr. Desmond FitzGerald were present for Item

Lt. General Marshall A. Carter was preseni for

Items 1 and 2.

1. Cuba - Covert Activities.

A lengthy discussion took place on covert action potertial

to weaken

the Castro regime:

The first part of the discussion

constituted an exchange of opinion of a general nature.

The following points were emphasized: Continued covert

action received support altiough divergence on the level of

activity was registered. There was a consensus that the present

level of operations was no longer effective in attaining the

basic objective of toppling Castro but harassment might keep

the regime off balance. There was an area of disagreement on

proofs of effectiveness of current and past measures.

Mr. Bundy summarized the dilemma by noting that the high

risk, dangerous operations are the rewarding ones and the low

noise, innocuous operations prove to be unrewarding.

Mr. Mann emphasized that considerably more homework had

to be completed before the next OAS meeting (presently unscheduled).

Mr. Bundy indicated that a Cabinet level meeting with higher

authority would have to

be held eventually to determine how far

the United States was willing to go. Mi. Bundy turned the discussion

to the specific Department of Defense paper.

On Sabotage, Mi. Vance stated that he could speak for

the Secretary of Defense; his attitude had turned to a harder

line.

On Harassment of Free World Shipping to Ciu?, para-

graph 2.a. was considered work in progress.

Or paragraph 2.b.

the attitude was negative, particularly as to sips of other

than Cuban flag.

SERRET

On Covert Economic Activities, paragraph 3.a. is

part of the present program.

Paragraphs 3.b. and

are part of an overall blacklisting problem which

remains

to be explored.

On Encouraging Dissidence Among Factions, the

consensus was to intensify these activities.

Actions against Cuban Subversion in Latin Anerica,

paragraphs 1 and 2: A good look should be taken at this

Lype of activity and a determination should be made on a

country-vy-country and case-by-case basis.

On the last paragraph of the paper, it was decided

that these efforts constitute work in progress with the

exception of shipping surveillance which is under active

study by the Department of Defense. A paper on this

problem will be ready next week.

- It was understood that

this was an expression of members' opinion on types of

action but that specific operational proposals would be

submitted to the Special Group as heretofore.

Mr. Bundy then asked Mr. Mann to prepare papers covering

the major issues of Caribbean surveillance, the blacklisting

of firms trading with Havana, covert actions, and types of

retaliation.

2.

Review Programs

On the review programs for Japan, France, Tibet, Taiwan,

and China, it was agreed that the papers as prepared were the

most useful way to present the material to members. Mr. Vance

indicated he had a number of questions in depth but that he would

not take the time at this meeting.

Mr. McCone then directed that.

the area specialists would be made available at Mr. Vance's con-

venience to answer any questions he might have. Mr. Bundy

concluded that since a time factor was not involved, formal approval

of these papers could be made at a future meeting.

Mr. Johnson

remarked that State had already registered its approval.

I:

Cuba - Proposed Operations during April 1964.

In discussing the proposed Cuban operations for the month of

"Äpril 1964 and three separate papers submitted to all members for

noting, the following conclusions were reached: The five infiltra-

tion/exfiltration operations were approved as were the five caching

operations:

However, the five sabotage proposals were tabled.

Referring to the paper entitled, "Status of Sabotage and Raiding

Capability against Cuba," Mr. FitzGerald emphasized the economic and

morale aspects of maintaining this potential and the influences of

deterioration when it remains in stand-by status.. Mr. Bundy then

stated that the time was overdue for submitting to higher authority

the entire question of covert operations against Cuba. The problem

of autonomous exile groups and their potential for conducting oper-

ations on their own and the momentum of these groups even if support

should be cut off was also discussed. It was clear that the groups

headed by Artime and Ray constitute a considerable threat.

Mr. Bundy indicated that next week he would call a meeting with

higher authority and the Secretaries of Defense and State. Mr.

FitzGerald would outline the current status of operations against

Cuba, and it was hoped that definite policy lines could be determined

future covert activity against Castro.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director of Central Intelligence

SUBJECT:

Overflight of Cuba on I May

1. Although it may, in fact, have little substance, the thought occurs

that if Castro is seriously considering a "shoot-down" of a U-2, from

a propaganda standpoint he could not select a better time than 1 May,

the traditional Communist holiday, and more significantly the Fourth

'Anniversary of the "infamous" Francis Gary Powers incident.

2. From a psychological viewpoint, identification of a new U-2

shoot-down with that incident on May Day four years ago might have

considerable appeal to Fidel and might conceivably influence his judg-

ment in reaching a determination to take such action.

3. Recognizing that this association is rather tenuous, it might

still be worth considering a stand-down of U-2 overflights on that one

day. This would not seriously impair our intelligence effort and it

would deprive Castro of the opportunity to exploit this rather unique

circumstance should he have any inclination to do s0. OK?

1.

The Chilean Situation

During a 35-minute discussion of the 4 September Chilean

election, Assistant Secretary of State Mann and Colonel J.C. King

outlined some of the problens and prospects for the Frei candidacy.

Colonel King, who had recently returned from Santiago, outlined some

of the covert efforts planned or underway which included financial

support to Frei, Italian CDU assistance, emphasis on the woman's vote,

Cacholic and labor union assistance, fragmentizing the opposition

Socialist party, distribution of propaganda, and possible assistance

from long-standing United States industrial interests.

b. Sone of the obstacles faced by the democratic forces were

underscored: the strong Chilean anti-clerical tradition, the unimpeded

rise in the cost of living, the formidable outside support being afforded

Allende, the political apathy of the military and the third man candidacy

of Duran.

c.

The Special Group decided: (a) that contact should be made with

Ambassador Cole to urge his return fo: a visit in the coming weeks,

(b) that talks with American business interests should proceed to deter-

mine the amount

and

method of their support, and (c) It was further decided

that higher authority would be apprised of the closeness and importance of

this Chilean election and that the Group itself would continue to review

the problem in the coming weeks.

2.

The Current Cuban Operational Climate and the Proposed Operations

for May 1964.

A 25-minute briefing was provided on Cuban operations by the Chief

of CAS, Miani, Mi. Theodore Shackley. He gave a thorough summary of the

franework in which programs have been established and provided detail

on the techniques used to accomplish these missions. He enumerated successes

achieved to date and indicated the types of difficulty encountered.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Minutes of the Meeting of the 303 Committee, 18 June 1964

PRESENT: Mr. Bundy, Mr. McCone, Mr. Vance, Mr. Johnson.

Mr. Mann and Mr. FitzGerald were also present.

A general discussion was held on problems arising from increased

activities on the part of organized Cuban emigre groups, independent

adventurers, purported plots to assassinate Castro and the general edginess

and instability on the island.

None of those present appeared to feel that it was either realistic or

practical to sever connections with or to withdraw support from the two

principal emigre organizations, those of Artime and Ray.

The recent escapades and overall capabilities of Manolo Ray were

deplored but it was agreed first: that steps should be taken to get the Puerto

Rican authorities to release his ship; second: that he should be promptly

advised in accordance with the stated policy established by the late President

to cease forthwith all activities from the United States Mainland and find

himself a new base of operations; third: no monies would be forthcoming,

specifically a requested $25, 000, until point two above has been accomplished.

No help was to be offered in finding Ray a new Caribbean base. Mr. Mann

was particularly interested that Ray not be encouraged to transfer to the

Dominican Republic because of the fragility of the regime.

The next subject discussed was the recent visit of Major Oliva to both

the Attorney General and Assistant Secretary Mann. It was pointed out that

Oliva is both a zealot and a man of integrity and that his only interest in life

is leading a return to his homeland. Any attempts to put Oliva into business

would be expensive and undesirable at this time. It was decided that

Mr. Bundy would ask the Attorney General if he would be willing to dampen

Oliva's ardor.

The activities of Artime from Nicaragua were discussed next. Alexis

Johnson pointed out that Artime raids could conceivably provoke Castro into

utilizing Cuban SAM sites; he said this possibility should not be discounted.

But it was also pointed out that Artime's recent sugar mill raid succeeded

in leading Castro to mobilize many persons involved in important sugar

harvesting and thus constituted a successful economic warfare byproduct.

It was estimated that Artime's schedule of one operation per month was

overly optimistic; one every three months was about all Artime could

accomplish. The decision was to drive home to Artime that his greatest

value was not in hazardous hit-and-run actions but in his survival as a

continuing psychological threat in being.

Mr. FitzGerald, in discussing the current situation in Cuba, stated that

he believed the regime was in considerable difficulty. There has been a

large increase in the number of executions and mass arrests. He also cited

the fact that an entire CIA Pinar del Rio net has been rolled up by Castro's

security forces and the key man executed. The sugar and crop prospects

were not good, the world price having dropped. Some of the members were

surprised at this picture and stated it did not seem to conform to the daily

bulletins. Mr. McCone said that he would ask for a SNIE on the current

situation in Castro Cuba.

A paper was discussed on alleged plans which involve the underworld

to assassinate certain Cuban leaders. Mr. McCone was somewhat skeptical

of the reported plots and stated that he would like to go into the matter further.

Others, including Mr. Bundy, felt that the United States was being put on

notice and should do everything in its power to ascertain promptly the veracity

It was decided that Mr. Bundy

would call the matter to the Attorney General's attention as a matter of law

enforcement.
