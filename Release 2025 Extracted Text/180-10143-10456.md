A friend of his reports plans to assassinate top Castro leadership in Cuba.

To be done by poison - "Clostridium Botulinum" which is strong, odorless,

Branch from Daniels. Source is Ernesto Dezaldo - Cuban lawyer now

Stated the MRP in Havana is far less radical than

under the leadership of Ray, who has been completely discredited in recent

months. Primary purpose today is (a) assassination of top leaders in Castro

regime and (B) sabotage of important industrial and government installations

in Havana.

Strength of MRP in Havana estimated to exceed 1, 000 -- success

measured more in terms of fund raising ability and blowing up of buildings.

restore tension in Cuba in 3-4 months.

However, said outside help needed

to get rid of Castro.

Claimed that prior to invasion, is was possible to

buy almost anything in Cuba from Castro officials -- they were tainted by

corruption. Since Castro's victory at Bay of Pigs, his popular support is

estimated to be around 80-85%. Most support is out of fear because the

people believe he will be in power permanently. Borja said DRE outside of

Cuba working hard for release of former leader, Alberto Muller from prison.

operations, several days alter some other group had already set them up or

claimed them.

Whenever It came to producing and backing up his claims, he

always came up with excuses for not producing, rather than results. He has

always tended to try to take over other goups, rather than cooperate with

them, and when he couldn't take them over he would "politic" against them.

His actions all seemed to be directed toward making him the future power

In Cuba rather than toward overthrowing Castro. It is believed that Manolo

subject:

Debriefing of Father Bastarrica

Father Bastarrica recently arrived from Cuba as a political exile. At a

luncheon meeting, he reported as follows:

MRP formed in Cuba around 26 July 1960. Organizers were Dr. Amallo Flallo

Gonzalez, Dr. Antonio Fernandez Nuevo, Reynol Gonzalez, Humberto Perez Herrera.

All these men belonged to group called Accion Democratica.

The name of MRP

was suggested by Raul Chibas and In itself It does not constitute a party

or group but rather a coalition of several small groups, which were the

following:

8. The 20 May group, led by Manuel Ray

b. Accion Democratica, led by Dr. Flallo

c. Accion Verde Olivo, led by Dr. Rufo Lopez Fresquet

a. 30 November Movement, led by David Salvador (never really joined)

e. Chibas' group with Jorge Beruff and Felipe Pazos

1. Di. Valdez Pino, in asylum in Embassy of Peru and belonged

to Accion Democratica.

Father Bastarrica's opinion of lay is that he had no way of juaging whether

Ray is Communist or Marxist.

Lacks quality of leadership because he

does not publically hold to a definite political, social and economic Ideology.

He appears to agree with every person he talks to, never arguing with them

or opposing them, all of which shows he has no ideology and makes him a

very dangerous man. Is extremely ambitous for himself, with great desire

Origin of Autonomous Operations

Integrated Covert Action Program for Cuba, approved by Higher Authority

In June 1963, provided for "support of autonomous anti-Castro Cuban groups

to supplement and assist in the execution" of other courses of action.

Concept was first voiced in Sept. 1962 In Walter Rostow's proposal for a

"Irack Iwo" approach to Cuban operations. Parallel to regular CIA-

controlled Cuban teams, CIA would extend financial aid and some advice and

guidance to independent and uncontrolled Cuban leaders such as Manuel Ray.

Rules of Engagement Incorporated into June 1963 program.

"It is the keystone of autonomous operations that they will be

executed exclusively by Cuban nationals motivated by the conviction that the

overthrow of the Castro/Communist regime must be accomplished by Cubans,

both inside and outside Cuba acting in consonance.

2. The effort will probably cost many Cuban lives. If this cost

In lives becomes unacceptable to the U.S. conscience, autonomous operations

can be effectively halted by the withdrawal of U.S. support; but once halted,

they cannot be resumed.

3.

All autonomous operations will be mounted outside the territory

of the United States.

4.

The United States Government must be prepared to deny publicly

any participation in these acts no matter how loud or even how accurate may

be the reports of ts s. complicity.

5. The United States presence and direct participation in the

operation would be kept to an absolute minimum. Before entering into an

operational relationship with a group, the U.S. representative will make 1t

clear that his Goverment has no intention of intervening militarily, except

At experienced CIA officer would be

assigned to work with the group in a liaison capacity. He would provide

general advice as requested as well as funds and necessary material support.

He may be expected to influence but not control the conduct of operations.

6. These operations would not be undertaken within a fixed time

schedule."

On Aug 24, 1904, Rogelio Cisneros called to report his resignation from JURE.

Stated Ray Incapable of directing both political and military activities.

Cisneros thinks Raul Chibas will soon also resign. Cisneros said Ray not

prepared for ill-fated May attempt into Cuba and Cisneros thinks Ray had

believed he could arrange for CIA to take him into Cuba. "Ray is politically

unformed - politically that which he last read". Cisneros further stated

that he believed Ray had planned his entire return-to-Cuba angle with President

Kennedy and the presidential elections of November 1964 in mind. According to

him, Ray planned to make JURE and Ray outstanding : liberal and democractic

exile group with the thought that prior to the 1964 elections, Mr. Kennedy

would have to do something about Cuba. With Kennedy's death, according to

Cisneros, all of Ray's plans went awry. Rodriguez expresses to Cisneros

that this seems like a far-fetched possibility and Cisneros admits he got

Idea out of thin air, but said theory widely held within Directorate of JURE.

Please pass to Asst. Sec. Mann from Ambassador Telles: "I saw President

Orlich and Minister Quiros Sasso on 18 November and conveyed reference position.

The President was visibly shaken to learn that US government was not in-

volved in this arms shipment.

After some discussion with Minister quiros,

President Orlich requested that we not issue license for AMBANG-1 shipment.

President Orlich made clear he would be happy at any time to undertake

action such as this if US government wanted him to.

While he does wish

see Cuba free he inclined to agree with US position Re Hit and Run raids

undertaken principally for publicity sake. President Orlich's decision

based on (1) relaization that he would not be doing us a favor and, (2)

further realization that CRG would be hard pressed to explain such a

$70,000 purchase of arms if it became a campaign issue in 1965."

Memo for the Record, atd 21 June 1966 from Charles Anderson

Met with Ray on 28 April 1966. Anderson said in general Ray had less

information on the "purge situation that I did.!

of Gustavo Arcos in P.R. had telephone contact with Arcos family in Cuba,

about 25 April and that Arcos still in prison but charges against him

were thin. "( This means there was at least one more telephone call than

we knew of previously, and this has probably served to increase the pressure

on Arcos)." Anderson tells of his concern and strong interest in Arcos on

the chance that Ray might assume Arcos had been CIA agent. Doesn't know

if Ray will construe remark this way but it seemed like an opening "to use

an important exile channel as a possible deception mechanism."

• "I believe that later in the summer it might be a good idea to have

another talk with AMBANG to keep up with exile thinking, and feeding more

deception thoughts.
