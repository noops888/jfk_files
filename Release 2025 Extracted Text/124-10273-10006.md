ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

DATE/O'3 -00BY SPALMRL

By letter 7/7/75 to the Honorable Frank Church,

we noted that the Senate Select Committee had in its possession

certain materials, which were compiled by the Commission on -

CIA Activities Within the United States, for the preparation

of its report to the President, which materials most probably

contained information regarding FBI operations of the utmost

sensitivity. In order to avoid any inadvertent compromise of

such information, we requested an opportunity to meet with

Senators Church and Tower at the earliest convenience to

discuss areas of this Bureau's activities which might warrant

special consideration.

Senator Church agreed that the above

matter would be discussed with Director Kelley at the latter's

appearance before the Executive Session of the Senate Select

Committee meeting scheduled for 7/kEd38

12-1=595-400

For your additional information,

this Bureau had

earlier ascertained that the Senate Select Committee has had

access to a 693-page document prepared by CIA listing instances

wherein CIA believed its operations may have exceeded its

mandate. A review of this document by Bureau personnel indi-

cated that some of these operations involve matters involving

this Bureau of an extremely sensitive nature. In response to

a request of CIA for copies of pertinent material contained

in the above 693-page document, CIA on this date furnished

copies of the material requested.

3 JUL 22 1975

In anticipation of the Director's appearance before

SSC on 7/16/75, the above material furnished by CIA consisting

of approximately 174 pages was reviewed. This material is

found to contain numerous references, in sanitized form, to

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEÉ ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEU OF FBI SA BY SSC

Cembell advised he was on a squad in the security area,

that his Supervisor was E. H. Belter and that the Security

Coordinating Supervisor was L. W. R. Oberndorf, now deceased.

Epstein then asked that they get to the point and

inquired of Campbell as to when he had heard about the king

cases:

Campbell responded that sometime early in 1964 he

heard of the case and recalled it was shortly after the

assassination of President Kernedy, and King had been nemed

Man of the Year (Time" Magazine), that Campbell became

knowledgeable under the following circumstances.

Campbell

was summoned to the office of the SAC either by a fellow SA,

B1ll Bergeron, or by Supervisor Belter, specific individual

not recalled.

Present in the office was the SAC at the time,

Marlin Johnson, the then FBI Assistant Director W1lI1am C.

Sullivan, Bergeron and probably several others, names not

recalled.

The folloving was related by Campbell in response

to ipstein's questions concerning what tock place at the

conference.

After some opening remarks by the SAC, Sullivan

advised that he did not want any of the information they

were to discuss to leave the room. Sullivan said that he

had information indicating that King was associating with

communists and that it was possible that King's movement was

being infiltrated.

As a result, Sullivan said he wanted a

technical installation on King in an effort to verify this

information.

At some later date, Campbell was assigned to

monitor the technical installation on King in which a radio

transmitter was used.

He could not recall whether the

equipment.

was signed out to him but he did take the equipment

home and on a Sunday afternoon he took a bus to Union Station.

monitoring, no

persons other than Campbell and, Borys entered

the monitoring room

Additional responses to questions from

Epstein were as follows. Campbell utilized only one radio

receiver and listened to only one radio microphone.

He

could not recall if there were any others in use. He and

Boxys took turns listening to the transmitter. Campbell

did not remove the transmitter when he left the hotel as he

never

entered any of the rooms assigned to the king party.

Campbell did not know any details concerning Mr. Sullivan's

remarks about King's association with communists. Campbell

did not attend all the meetings at WFO concerning the King

installation. It was his best recollection that the monitoring

was done in rooms one floor above the rooms occupied by the

King party.

At the end of the interview, Epstein indicated he

had one final question which was, as best Campbell could

remember. "Is there anything else about this case that you

Inow that has not come out because I did not ask the right

question or did not ask a question in the right way?" Campbell

replied that he felt that Epstein had done a good job in

asking the questions.

NOTE:

Assistant Director Mintz briefed Campbell prior to

his interview. Campbell was accompanied to the SSC offices

by Supervisor S: F. Phillips of the Senstudy 75 Project but

Phillips was

not called upon for any consultation.

epstein then stated lets get to the point. Wher

did you hear about the King case.

I responded that some-

time early in 1964 - recalled since it was shortly after

President Kennedy was shot and King was named man of the

year - I was summons to the SAC's office either by my

associate Bill Bergeron of my supervisor Mr. Belter not

specifically recalled. The SAC, Marlin Johnson, Assistant

Director William Sullivan, Bergeron and probably several

a narrative of information I furnished in response to

Epstein's questions.

The SAC made several remarks and Assistant Director

Sullivan then stated that he did not want any information

discussed to leave the room. Sullivan stated he had informa-

tion that indicated King was associating with communists and

it was possible his movement was being infiltrated. Sullivan

said he wanted a technical installation on King in an effort

to verify this information.

At some later daté I was assigned to monitor the

installation which was a radio transmitter. I could not

recall If the equipment was signed out to me or not but I

took the equipment home and on a Sunday afternoon I caught a

bus to Union Station, I walked around for a short time and then

by cab went to the hotel and checked in under an assumed

name (name not remembered).

I did not recall who made my

reservations.

The first night King did not enter the room •

we were monitoring. (I did not recall the names of

individuals who occupied room but they were associated with

party.)

. The next day we (John Borys of WFO and myself)

moved to a different room. I could not recall how the

arrangements for the move was made.

We then monitored King

for about two days, stayed one extra day at the hotel, and

checked out. Either Borys or myself stayed in the room at

all time.

One would take the logs and tapes out of the

hotel each day and turn them over to someone from WFO (details

not recalled). At no time did I ever enter any room in the

hotel that was occupied by King or any member of his party.

The tape recorder was manually operated and we attempted to

run it any time someone was in the room.

I know of no physical

or photographic surveillance on King during this time.

had no instructions that I can recall concerning only listening

to certain types of conversation.

Epstein asked if I kept a card at the office

showing my location.

I responded that it was the normal

practice to place a

card in file when one was away from

the office.

In this case, if I placed a card in file I

probably would place a notation

Supervisor Belter for contact."

I had never seen any paper, memos, etc. (other

than logs) dealing with this case.

Epstein asked if I ever saw the tapes again

after departing the hotel.

I stated that sometime after -

(possibly one or two months) I was asked to review the tapes

and logs in an effort to obtain additional information.

did this at the FBI Laboratory and was assisted by SA John

Matter, retired, in the technical enhancement techniques -

such as filtering. I was not directed to concentrate on

any one part of the tapes but reviewed all of the tapes.

I did not type any of the information and if it was typed

it was probably typed in the Intelligence Division. I have

not seen the tapes since that time.

Mr. Bergeron, Mr. Matter or Mr. Borys after that contact.

I do not knave the tapes are still in existance.

Dorio asked if it was the normal practice to

erase tapes. I stated that in this type investigation I

was sure only new tapes were used.

I was certain the tapes

were new if they were still wrapped in cellophane and they

had the appearance of new tapes.

She also asked how I got

the key for the second room

at the hotel and did I have

the key to me.

No other person entered the rooms except

Borys and myself where the monitoring was taking place.

Other responses to questions from Epstein were:

We only had one radio receiver and only listened to one

radio microphone, I could not recall if there were others.

Borys and myself

took turns listening to the transmitter.

I did not remove the transmitter when I left the hotel as I

never entered any of the rooms assigned to the King party.

One final question from Epstein. Is there anything

because I did not ask the right question or asked a question

Additional answers to questions. I did not

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER FBI AD BY SSC

Conrad was asked who was in charge of the RE and

responded by asking for time frame.

He was told the

reference was to the early 1960's and Conrad responded that;

because of the turnover of personnel, he could not respond:

to any specific times. He was then asked who was in charge:

at the time Concad retired in 1973 and he gave the name of

Wayne Bradley (retired). He was asked how long Bradley was

the Séction Chief. of RE and Conrad answered that he could

not remember.

Conrad was asked whether it was common to make

copies of tapes derived from technical

coverage.

He responded

that it was done on occasion and explained that tapes would

sometimes be sent to the laboratory in order to obtain more

coherent coples through a process known as filtering.

In

such instances;

filtered coples were produced in the

Laboratory

When asked where this was done,

, Conrad said it

was done in the RE.,

He was asked whether all tapes derived

from technical coverage were sent to the Laboretory and his

response was "No." He was asked if all technical coverage

tapes:

were maintained by the laboratory and his response

Was

"No."

When asked under what conditions they would be

sent to the laboratory, Conrad advised that they. would be

sent to the laboratory. when it was necessary to have them

filtered. In response to inquiry as to what the mechanics

were of getting the tapes to the Laboratory, Conrad said there

was no single procedure.

They might be sent by a field office

directly to the laboratory with a request for assistance

in

making the tapes more readable; or, the assistance of this

nature might originate with an FBI Headquarters official.

Conrad was asked for the detailed mechanics of tha

routing requests for filtering and he responded that he did

not see how this bore on the King matter.

He was then asked

whether a record was always made of requests for filtering,

and he responded that, if the request vas from the field,

there would normally be a cover communication which would

be the permanent record.

Hovever, if the request tas from

a Headquarters official, there might not alrays be a vitien

LEcord. He was asked how the material would get to a specisic

person

in the Laboratory and he responded by saying that it

might be routed directly by the sender or routed to the

Laboratory generally, and then from the central routing

paint in the laboratory it would be sent to either RE or the

specific person sho would handle the matter. Conrad vas

asked hor a router would knor where to send such an item and

he responded that there vould be information in the cover

communication which would assist in this routing.

Conrad was asked whether it vas necessary to

account by inventory for all tapes used in making copies of

tapos.

He anstered that it vas not so necessary because

the volume vas so small. He was asked if he knew whether

any record or memorandum was made of such a requesi in

connection with the King case and responded that he did not

know; that he had no recollection, He was asked 1c it was

possible that such a written record might exist and if so,

would it not be in FBI files? He answered that he did not

think he could contribute to this question as almost anything

is possible. He added, horever, that he had no knowledge or

recollection of such a

record or any knowledge of its

existence in FBI files.

He was then asked if he had ever heard of mailings

of tapes involving King. He replied that he had seen something

in a nerspaper within the past year or to indicating such

an allegation. His recollection vas that the neis account

vas of a copy of a tape being mailed to Mrs. King, and that

Mrs. King had denied receiving same.

activities of DI. KING Or the S,I.C.

Since I have

little or no recollection of demonstrations in which

Dr. KING might have been involved, this method of

trying to jog my memory would seem to be of little

help.

Mas the weather at the time of the monitoring cold

Or trarm?

I seem to recall that the weather was warm, but

I am not sure.

Tere you told of the surpose of monitoring Dr. KING?

I am not sure. So much of this is now a gray area

to me. I do seem to recall asking for the reason

and bety matter and that/d some indication

security matter and that

that Di. KING as being influenced by persons who

leaned torard the left.

Tere you told that such people might be with Dr. KING?

I do not recall. I simply have the recollection

that our purpose was to determine whether he was being

so influenced. I hasten to admit, horrever, that I

am very hazy on this and it may very well be that beI

learned of these indications through conversations

even after the occurrence of our monitoring. I can

not be more specific in this regard.

Tho was with you at the time of the monitoring?

BILL CAMPBELL.

Tas anyone else involved?

I believe I did meet BILI, BERGERON (phonetic) in

the lobby of the hotel. No one else to my

recollection.

Dild you sign out from the office to go to the

hotel?

This would be the customary procedure, but whether

it ras done in this instance I do not recall.

No. My recollection is that the equipment was

Did you register in the hotel?

I recall the registration desk, therefore, perhaps

I did, but I am not sure.

Did you use old or ner tapes?

I do not recall.

That time of day tas it?

I seem to recall that it was at night. I feel a

good guess might be between 8:00 p.m. and midnight,

or thereabouts.

Did you monitor for only one night?

That is my recollection.

Did you and BILL CAMPBELL relieve each other?

I do not recall this. It seems we both monitored

at the same time.

Was Dr. KING in the room being monitored?

I associated voices I heard in the room to be that

of DI. KINGs.

were there other people in the room being monitored?

I again associated voices heard with Mr. ABERNATHY,

another male from Baltimore those name I do not

recall, and I believe the voices of to women.

Mas there any visual monitoring?

A:

Not to my knowledge.

Was this the only monitoring being done at this tine?

Yes, as far as I know.

Did you make a log while monitoring?

One could only take down very sketchy notes.

Did you thereafter go over the tapes and make up

Yes.

There was this done?

In an interview room of "FO or some room set ud

for that purpose.

Regarding the time this monitoring took place, did

you leave the hotel for your home when finished?

A:

Normal procedure would have been to return to the

office. I believe I returned to the office.

Q:

"lould it not be unusual for you to be returning

to the office, say at 1:00 a.m.?

A:

No. I have done this on several occasions.

(Purpose here it seems vas to jog ny memory as to

the exact time of monitoring.)

Q:

ere you involved in any of the reports or paper

work connected with this matter?

A:

No.

Then you monitored in other matters, was it not

customary to knor the agent to thom a case ras

assigned? If so, would you not then relate a

conversation overheard to that agent?

In the normal course of events, this rould be true,

and the agent to whom the matter was assigned would

be so advised if the overheard conversation was

urgent in nature. In the matter of DI. KING, however,

I did not know the agent to whom the case was assigned.

Then you completed this monitoring, to whom did you

give your logs?

I do not recall; normal procedure would have been to

give them to my immediate supervisor, Ms. BELTER.

Getting back to the hotel, did you and lix. CAMPBELI

leave together?

I do not recall. In all probability, re did.

Did you carry the tapes and notes back to the office?

I do not recall. Either Mr. CAMPBELI or I did, or

-re both may have. If I did carry them, I normally

rould have turned them over to the custody of

IfT. BELTER.

That is correct. My function in that matter was very

Q:

"Then he gave it to you, was it done while you were

alone or was someone else present?

A:

I do not recall. I feel it occurred in Mr. BELTER'S

office which did not offer a good deal of privacy.

If anyone else was present, however, it was

probably Mr. CAMPBELI.

0:

Did you know the location of Dr. KING's hotel room

in regard to your location at the hotel?

A:

I do not recall, I do not think so.

The interview ended with some questions in an attempt

to refresh my memory as to the actual date of the monitoring.

In substance, this is covered in my fifth anster under item

three above.

Mr. Paul Wallach, staff member of the Urited States Senate

Select Committee on intelligence Activities, telephomtally contacted me on

6-18-75 between 2:30 and 3 o'clock P.M., and inquiral as to the status of a

request by the Conmittee concerning mail cover infornation. He asked if !

could furnish him a time when he might expect our response to be delivered

to him. He pointed out that he had had previous discusions with me and

Mr. Shaneen of the Departrent concerning this matter, and Mr. Shaheen

had indicated to him that he could expect the response to have been given to

him by this time. Mr. Wallach was informed that a tine certain for

delivery of a response concerning this request could rot be given, and it

was explained to him that a vast amount of material wes being reviewed

pursuart io request of the Senate Select Committee and other committees of

Congress and that because of the amount of work invoked in all these requests

it was not possible to make a judgment as to the date a the response.

Mr. Wallach indicated he felt he had been nisied by Mr. Shaheen

into believing that he would have a response to his request and that he was

going to recontact Mr. Shaheen. He made a general irquiry as to whether one

Agent might be gathoring all the information and as to whether he might be

allowed to come to FBI Headquarters and review what has been gathered to

this point. He was informed that all disclosures have o receive proper

Bureau approval and that it would not be possible for him to review such

information in the absence of such approval. He askedif the Bureau could

separate the response by making available immediately portions of the mail

cover lists such as the identities of people who were the targets of mail

covers in the domestic field. He again was informed tat this was not

possible in the absence of proper approval. Mr. Wallah stated that he

wanted me to know that he was in possession of a list d Bureau mail covers

for the past five years which he had been furnished by 1 source whom he did

not identify, He was asked (1) if this list concerned the mail covers in the

national security areas and, (2) was it a national list. Ir. Wallach stated it

was a national list in the national security areas. He sated he was not sure

of its accuracy. He indicated that he would have no reservations about using

the list to conduct the Senate Select Committee business and stated that inter-

views may be conducted based on the list.

He was advised that the list would contain sensitive information

which would seriously impair ongoing Bureau invéstigations. He replied that

the names were nor classified, and since they were not classified he would

have no problem in using the list. It was explained to Mr. Wallach that

despite the fact it was not classified the list would be extremely sensitive

since it would impair many ongoing investigations and in many instances the

very fact that we are interested in an individual indicates that we are in

possession of sensitive intormation concerning that individual, Mr. Wallach

pointed out that if this were the case, acknowledging that he had been informed

previously that one of the reasons for the necessity for closely reviewing the

material to be made available was because of this problem, then the Bureau

should come forward with its own list and point out to him which of the names

are sensitive and which are not.

Mr. Wallach stated that only one or two

other people had knowledge of the fact he possessed such a list.

Cormittee - June 18, 1975 - 4:20 p.m.

Paul Wallach called O'Connor, but I took the call. Wallach

stated that his call to O'Connor was to express his personal

concern over O'Connor's questioning his (Wallach's) professional

ethics in an earlier telephone conversation with John Elliff of

SSC staff. Wallach expressed the hope that Schwarz's conversation

- with O'Connor in which Schwarz categorically disclaimed that Wallach

had made certain specific representations to Paul Daly of the FBI

earlier, would put to rest all of O'Connor's concerns vis-d-vis

Wallach. (O'Connor's concerns were aroused by my report to him of

a Wallach call at about 3:00 p.m. to Daly in which Daly stated that

Wallach claimed that he (Wallach) "had the NSC mail covers going

back five years" and had received same with names listed from a

source that Wallach refused to disclose. Dally further reported

that Wallach stated that unless the Bureau was not inmediately

forthcoming with the SSC's request for the NSC mail covers, he

(Wallach) would use the ones in his possession.) I told Wallach

that I would convey his expression of concerm to O'Connor and that

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re: Senstudy 75

62-116395

the Deputy Attorney General instructed that the Department

prepare a letter over the Attorney General's signature

asking for clarification of the 6/25/75 letter as well as

raising the question of any agreement entered into by the

• Department or the FBI.

TASK FORCE CONCEPT

The Task Force concept is designed to identify

various abuses which the SSC desires to investigate in-depth.

A member of the intelligence community would be identified

to the Executive Branch as a

Task Force leader. The purpose

would be to permit that Tásk Force leader to be completely

knowledgeable on all available information throughout the

intelligence community for a particular abuse. In other

words, the White House could look to the Task Force leader

as the one person in the intelligence, community who would be

privy to all information regarding a particular abuse.

The

Deputy Attorney General had no problem with this concept but

did insist that the Task Force leaders should not negotiate

directly with their counterparts on the SSC on behalf of

the intelligence community for any particular abuse (the

White House has insisted on this). The Deputy Attorney General

/\instructed Mr.. O'Connor to make this quite clear to

Mr. James A. Wilderotter, Associate Counsel to the President,

and if Wilderotter insisted on unilateral negotiations between

Task Force leaders and the SSC, Wilderotter should be referred

to the Deputy Attorney General

in order to resolve this issue.

THE ROCKEFELLER COMMISSION FILES

•

As you know, the President has ordered that copies

of the Rockefeller Commission files including testimony be

turned over to the SSC. There has been no third agency

coordination on the part of CIA regarding what information

was turned over to the Rockefeller Commission. As a result

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re: Senstudy 75

62-116395

in the above we are not are that to the defeation

Commission by CIA.

The Criminal Division of the Department has received

copies of the entire Rockefeller Commission file plus testimony.

The Deputy Attorney General has ruled that these files and

testimony cannot be turned over to the FBI in toto until

such time as the Criminal Division has ruled on any possible

criminal culpability on the part of the FBI. To faciliate :

the review of the Rockefeller Commission files, the Criminal

Division will separate out any informaion it feels involves

any FBI criminal culpability. That portion separated out

will be the subject of discussion between the Deputy Attorney

General and the Director. The remaining portion of the

Rockefeller files will then be turned over to the FBI for

review to determine if any of the information contained therein

could possibly jeopardize sensitive ongoing investigations

or adversely affect the security and welfare of FBI sources

mentioned therein.

The Legal Counsel Division is preparing a letter

alerting the SSC to the possibility that sensitive information

may be contained in the Rockefeller files and requesting that

Senators Church and Tower consider a briefing by FBI officials

regarding those sensitive areas of concern to the FBI which

may be embodied in the Rockefeller Commission files.

ACTION:

For information.
