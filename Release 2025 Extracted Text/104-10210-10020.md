According to these sources, his defection

Allowing for exaggerated claims of boyhood heroics

which NOSENKO has retracted under interrogation, NOSENKO's

NOSENKO'S Information

SLISINGER came under

suspicion by the KGB First

Chief Directorate because of his

business transactions

with a number of Soviets who visited his

store and

in

whom he seemed to show more than casual interest.

The

First Chief Directorate was of the opinion that

SLESINGER was tryirg to become closely acquainted with

some soviets,

to study them.

SLESINGER had visited the

Soviet Union

several times.

Learning SLESINGER planned

another trip to the USSR, the KGB suspected

that

"he

might make some contacts or do something interesting"

while visiting the soviet Union.

The KGB wanted to

resolve Its suspicions that SLESINGER was possibly an

agent or operational contact of the FBI.

The KGB had

a file on SIESINGER, nd a

senior case officer in the

American Section of

the Seventh

Department, Yu.".

DVORKIN, was

the responsible case officer.

An agent

of the Seventh Department who was director of a photo-

graphic shop in Moscow was instructed to becone friendly

with SLESINGER while the latter was visiting the Soviet

Union,

and the two men later exchanged correspondence.

SLESINGER went to Odessa. to

visit relatives, and DORKIN

directed the Odessa KGB to "surround" him with agents. ino

watch his behavior.

If there had been any indication

of intelligence activities, the KGB would have atterpted.

no approach was made.

SLESINGER had travelled to the

Soviet Union before, several times.

rosENko's Information

SHUBIN was a native of California of Russian

traction, a Russian spealer, and

a university professor

in New Yors City.

SHUBIN, who had visited the soviet

Union twice vefore, visited thi Soviet Union in 1953

or 1959, while NOSENKO was serving his first tour

of

duty in

the Seventh Department.

At that time, SHUBIN

was the. target of seventh

Departnent case officer

A.A. VETLITSKIY, NOSENKO heard later that SHUBIN was'

placed under surveillance, and when the KGB surveillance

abserved ShUBIN as a passenger in a Ministry of Defense

automobile,

the GRU was asked about the Anerican.

"They

very

furtively said that they were intcrested in him,"

from which the KGB concluded that SHUBIN was a GRU agent.

In 1362 (sic) NOSENKO was reviewing a list of foreign

visitors to the sovict Union and he noted SHUBIN's name

and rccalled his earlier identification as a GRU agent.

NOSENKO himself telephoned GRJ General

SOKOLOV's office

and informad SOKOLOV of SHUBIN's presence (or, according

to another version, SOKOLOV's office was advised by

others).

SOKOLOV's office eventually apologized for

having failed carlier to notify the KGB of the GRU's

interest in SHUBIN:

Comnent:

a sensitive source

Carlier,

Grassy. identified a

agent apparently Identical with SHUBIN

and FBI sources reported SilUBIN's travel

to the USSR in summer 1961 and in

Septenber 1963.

SHUBIN had no valid U.S. passport

between 1940 and June 1961; if he visited

the Soviet Union during that period it was

not as an American tourist under his true

name.

Consequently, he

could

not then have

been the tourist target of the Seventh

Department case officer, as NOSENKO claimed.

If NOSENKO erred, and actually was referring

to SHUBIN's visit in 1961, there is a further

contradiction: NOSENKO could not have

noticed his nane while reviewing tourist

lists in the Seventh Department, because

he claims he was

in the American Department

at the time.

Evon if HOSENKO learned of the operations as

with respect to HOSElkO's oin description of Soventh Depar=-

They do not accurately characterize, as

NOSENKO claims, *GB counterirtelligence

NOSENKO'S explanations for his assignment to

Geneva in 1961 are no more plausible

than

for his carlicr

assignment there in 1962.

NOSENKO has asserted that he was

not a lieutenant colonel

as the temporary duty authorization

indicated, but a captain, a rank incongruous with a Deputy
