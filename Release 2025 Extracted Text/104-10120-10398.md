attempted to arrange for such a meeting through Andre AMALRIK.

After calling from the Embassy to arrange the appointment, LUERS

and KORENGOLD went to AMALRIK's apartment.

The painter was

not there, and shortly after their arrival two militia men and KGB

officers came to AMALRIK's apartment. AMALRIK was arrested,

tried, and sentenced for being a 'parasite'. LUERS said that his

superior at the Embassy, Malcolm TOON, was unhappy about this

activity and was critical of LUERS in his efficiency rating because

of it. LUERS said he did not previously mention it to the interviewing

agent because he did not wish to further complicate matters. "

(LUERS was security approved as a GS-7 JOT in June 1957, subject

to technical interview, but his case was cancelled when he accepted

another position. He was subsequently granted liaison clearances in

February and March 1962.)

Newsweek magazine was in process of doing a major story on U.S.

intelligence community, including CIA, and while cable recipients

were not to seek out Newsweek correspondents, they were to be

responsive under certain limitations which were specified in detail

in the book message.
