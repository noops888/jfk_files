I doubt that Leal has been designated as the US representative for FIUR,

and do not believe that the documents he gave me originated in Cuba, I

suspect that another group of extled Cuban politicians wrote the document

n the US, and are trying to get national publicity in order to get support.

I have recently heard that sloy

Gutierrez Menoyo has been added to the 11s

of Cabinet appointments. I doubt very mich that Gutierrez and Ray would be

fully accepted by the majority of Cubans in exile,
