ABSTRACT
MICROFILM
1. A source who has given highly reliable information in the past, and
whom we have no reason to question, has stated that during 1943 one Luis
TEDESCHI was either being considered for recruitment by/or was actually work-
ing for the RIS. According to the source, he was known to have been active
as a member of the Bpanish Communist Party. The address used by TEDESCHI
during early 1943 was Pichincha 969, Buenos Aires, Argentina.
2. The Buenos Aires Station hes determined that a Luis TEDESCHI, born
2 February 1918, is listed in local police files as living at El Dorador 3150,
telephone 58-3717. Further investigation is being corducted there. Unfortu-
nately, Headquarters does not have the date and place of birth of Subject of
paragraph 1. The source has indicated that Subject was probably born in Italy
and way have been active in the Spanish Civil War 1936-39. This, of course,
could explain his involvement in the Spanish Communist Party.
3. It is requested that Rome, Barcelona, and Madrid check station and
Base files for any traces of Subject. Liaison and police contacts may be
approached for any information available in their files.
4. Please address replies in this matter "Attention KUDESK."

1. This office is extremely interested in obtaining all available information
on ore Luis TECESCHI, who was reported to be residing at Pichincha 969, Buenos
Argentina
Aires, in the early part of 1943, at which time he allegedly was of interest
to the PIS. The attached document refers to a Luis TEDESCHI residing at
this address in 1942 and to an individual by the name of TEDESCHI who had
resided at Estados Unidos 0366 in 1942. Apparently the information as shown on
the attached document was obtained through mall intercepts.
2. We would appreciate having you tell us if you know of any way we might
locate the intercepts referred to and possibly any other intercepts directed

1. Headquarters regrets that it has been unable to learn the date and place
of birth of the Luis TEDESCHI who, according to a usually reliable source, was being
considered for recruitment in 1943 by the FIS, or was actually working for the FIS.
As stated in HA-6515, our source reported that the address used by TEDESCIII during
the early part of 1943 was Pichincha 969, Buenos Aires.
2. Collateral information on Luis TEDESCHI of Pichincha 969, Buenos Aires,
has been found in a 19.2 document which appears to have been based on censorship
reports. This document indicates that TEDESCHI's address, as given above, was a
cover address for a UDE (Union Democratica Espanola) manifesto sent from Cuba.
Also one TEDESCHI, Estados Unido 366, Buenos Aires, was given as a cover address
in a secret writing message. A copy of the pertinent portions of this document
is attached.
3. It is hoped that a unilateral surveillance on the Luis TEDEDCHI living at
El Domador 3150, Buenos Aires, if instituted as the station planned, will be
fruitful. Headquarters will be extremely interested in any further information on
this individual you may be able to develop, as it is possible that he may be linked
with Communist and/or RIS activities in Cuba as well as being used locally by the RIS.
4. As..KUDESK is currently handling this case, it is requested that the slug
PEDWOOD not be used.

1. In view of the fact that Subject dispatch presented a
possible lead to an RIS agent, it was decided to do a unilateral
check on TEDEDCHI rather than refer the matter to liaison. As a
result of investigations undertaken by BIPALA-l, the Station learned
that:
Luis EDEDCHI
Is listed in the Buenos Aires police files as
living at El Domador 3150, with telephone number
58-3717, and has no record of police offences.
This individual was born on 2 February 1918.
2. If possible, it is requested that Headquarters attempt to
confirm the above date of birth with the source of reference. The
Station plans to institute a unilateral surveillance on Subject, and
will keep Headquarters informed of pertinent developments.
