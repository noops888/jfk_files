MEMORANDUM FOR: Inspector General

SUBJECT

: Howard Hunt

1.

At the recent request of the Deputy Director for

Management and Services, the Office of Finance has searched

its records to determine if we could find any payment to

Mr. Hunt in an amount of approximately $30,000 that required

no accounting.

2. We have searched the following records:

a.

The expense runs for the period July 1964 to

June 1973 for the immediate Office of the DCI,

the immediate Office of

th start, a stat and he opt ot Security.

We have checked various items that were re-

flected in these expense records but have

identified nothing relating to Mr. Hunt.

15-2.

b.

The Madrid Station,

JMWAVE and FR/Washington

Office accountings

to determine if there were

funds passed by the Stations to Mr. Hunt during

the year he served under non-official cover in

Madrid. We could find no payment to Mr. Hunt

either in his true name or his two identified

pseudonyms.

Mr. Hunt's travel claims for the period

1960-1972 and have found nothing in these

travel claims that were not consistent with

normal travel expenses, i.e., transportation,

per diem.

d.

We made a specific analysis of Mr. Hunt's

advance account for the period he was under

non-official cover (July '65-Sept '66) and have

SUBJECT: Howard Hunt

determined that $33,500 was advanced to him

for travel and transportation of household

goods to and from Madrid with one trip to

Paris for he and his family to renew their

Spanish visas.

All of this advance.was fully

accounted for. However, in his accounting,

one item appeared unusual.

It was an

expenditure of $1,600 for a sensitive

operation which was approved for write-off by Mr.

Desmond Fitzgerald on 1 June 1966 without

further accounting.

3.

Also, we confirmed that no other Agency advance accounts

were established for Mr. Hunt during this period.

4.

At the beginning of his non-official cover tour, it

was necessary to establish a bank account in his name.

The

EUR Division accordingly requested we open an account

at the

Chase Manhattan Bank in Mr. Hunt's name to receive all non-

salary payments.

(Mr. Hunt had an account at Riggs National

Bank to receive his salary and allowance payments).

The

following deposits were made to the account during 1965 and

1966:

Account opened: 13 July 1965

13 July 1965

22 July 1965

15 September 1965

6 October 1965

19 July 1966

$10,000

5,000

5,000

5,000

5,000

$30,000

All of the above have been accounted for by submission

of travel and transportation accountings.

5.

We feel at this time without specific guidelines that

further searching would be somewhat fruitless.

One strange

aspect of the non-official cover assignment in Madrid is that

all the costs were charged to the support allotment of the

EUR Division which is not normal as non-official cover people

are usually assigned to a project. It is unusual to have a

case officer abroad for one year on an operational assignment.

without him incurring operational expenditures.

SUBJECT: Howard Hunt

The Office of Finance has not found operational

expenditures except for the $1,600 mentioned above.

Therefore, it is suggested that Mr. Karamessines be questioned

as to a project or projects to which Mr. Hunt's operational

expenditures if incurred would have been charged.

7.

Another possible course of action is to request the

Director to approve my asking la cleared contact at Chase

Manhattan Bank to provide a transcript of all entries into

Mr. Hunt's Chase Manhattan Bank account.

8. We are currently reviewing records of all cashier's

checks prepared and issued by Monetary to determine if any

were payable to MI.

Hunt. Hopefully this effort will be

finished by the end of the week.
