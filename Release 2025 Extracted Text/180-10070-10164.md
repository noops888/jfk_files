Dear Mrs. Thornell:

I an sorry you feel that you were not treated fairly upon

termination of your services

with the Comnittee.

When I received your letter. I asked Tom Howarth to give

me a memorandum outlining the

terns of

your settlement.

Enclosed is a copy.

I am sure that aiter you read the memorandum, you will

agree that the Committee j

than fair, especially in

light of the fact there was no official leave policy at the

time and thus, no obligation to pay any terminating compen

sation at all.

As to your main area of concern, the one day break in

service, Mr. Howarth's memorandum points

out that such a break

has no effect whatsoever on the transfer of your benefits.

Admins ration every success in your now position with the

Sincerely,

pinor. pro

DATE:

RE :

JUNE 14, 1977

JOAN T. THORNELL, LETTER RE LEAVE

Mrs.

Thornell left at the close of business

on Friday, May 13, 1977â€¢

As the Committee had no leave

policy at that time, she made her termination effective

Sunday, May 15, 1977, at my suggestion, so that she

would

receive

two days extra in pay.

Mrs. Thornell began employment November 8,

1976

and left May 13, 1977. Under the Clerk of the

House's leave policy, she would be entitled to 5 days,

no credit being given for a fraction of

a month when

hired or a fraction of a month when terminated.

The Clerk's policy further states there

are no provisions to permit reimbursement to an employee

upon termination for any accumulation of leave.

However,

to the extent possible and practicable, every effort

should be made to consider such accumulation when sub-

mitting a recommendation for termination.

Twelve Committee Staff Members with a total

of 42 days accumulated leave who have terminated, in-

cluding one who terminated the same day as Mrs. Thornell,

were given no credit for their leave because the

Committee had no policy at that time.

This fact and the fact that Mrs. Thornell

was paid for six days past May 13, in my opinion, dis-

credits Mrs. Thornell claim to "the punitive nature of

the decision."

The facts clearly show that Mrs.

Thornell was given special consideration.

For the record, Acting Chief Counsel Al Lewis

was paid

for no accumulated leave. After Mr. Lewis left

the Committee,

he was kept on the payroll long enough to

recover his back salary which I understand was the

Committee's request.

(Mrs. Thornell had already recovered

her back salary.)

As to Mrs. Thornell's break in service, I

have been told by the Finance Office that such a break

has no effect whatsoever on the transfer of her benefits.

THE TREASURER OF THE UNITED STATES

May 27, 1977

Hon Louis B. Stokes

Chairman

Select Committee on Assassinations

U. S. House of Representatives

Washington, D. C. 20515

Dear Chairman Stokes:

The circumstances of my departure from the Committee staff

have saddened me because of the following:

On May 6, 1977, in writing (enclosed) I advised the then-

Acting Chief Counsel and Staff Director, Alvin B. Lewis, Jr.,

of my intention to leave the staff as of May 15, 1977 plus

whatever vacation time I had accrued since my date of entry to

service, November 8, 1976.

Since there was no formal leave policy established by the

Committee at the date of my notice and since I was aware of

leave being extended to the Acting Chief Counsel who was also

leaving service at about the same time, I began making inquiries

about my own accrued leave.

On Thursday, May 12, Thomas Howarth, the Budget Officer,

advised me verbally that he had not yet cleared with you the

rate of leave to be extended to me in days accrued per month,

but he thought that a rate of one day per month was going to

be approved.

On that basis, he calculated that I would be

allowed 5 1/2 or 6 days of leave.

When I began a new appointment with a Federal agency on

Monday, May 23, I called Mr. Howarth from the new personnel

office to establish my date of termination in order to comply

with the Federal law which prohibits Federal employees from.

receiving payment from more than one Federal source at a

time.

In other words, I was attempting to clear the date of

May 23 as a starting date for the new employment.

At that time, Mr. Howarth advised that I had been terminated

on May 19, based on a calculation of leave beginning May 14 for

a total of 6 days -- which included counting weekend days in

the leave period. At the time of our initial conversation, how-

NW 88326

Docld:32244106 Page 6

## Page 7

- 2 -

ever, I was not advised that weekend days would be counted

in the

calculation of the leave period.

He further advised that since the House payroll system is

based on a 30-day month, for purposes of calculating a termination

date he counted weekend days, whereas a vacationing employee who

would be returning to work after vacation would not have weekend

days counted. (I checked with the Committee on House Administra-

tion and learned that though each Committee establishes its own

leave policy, it is unusual to penalize a terminating employee

y counting in weekend days.

Inasmuch as there was no written leave policy I had no way

of anticipating his method of calculating leave.

And because of

the punitive nature of the decision I have suffered a break in

service which may affect seriously my transfer of benefits from

the House of Representatives to my new employment. Had I been

aware of his method of calculating leave, my dates of departure

from the Committee, obviously, would have been different.

I hope that you will review the calculation of my date of

departure and act swiftly to rectify the situation to allow my

termination date from the Committee to be set at Friday, May 20,

ret ect 5 work.

1977, which would reflect 5 working days leave from the Committee.

I have already acted to begin employment at the Department

of the Treasury as of May 23.

I gladly forfeit the 6th vacation

day which would have been May 23.

Thank you in advance for your kind attention to this matter

and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
