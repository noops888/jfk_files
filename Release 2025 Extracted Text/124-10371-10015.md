no difficulty in their implementation. Participants at

the meeting were then asked to contribute funds for the

purchase of weapons; the total cash raised exceeded $1,000.00.

[KASSEL

commented that it 1s his impression that the funds

raised were intended for MASFERRER's personal use rather

than the purchase of weapons.

possibility of founding a conspiratorial and secret political

movement to create a mechanism of penetrating Cuba for the
