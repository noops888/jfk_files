KARLOW first said he was

unable to recall visiting

Berlin in 1953 but later said he recalled seeing WILLIAM K. HARVEY,

Chief of Station, (December, 1952, to August, 1959) on more than

one occasion so he supposes

he did make such

visits.

When

informed that it was understood that KARLOW had been to Berlin

ten to fifteen times in the period 1950 - 1953, KARLOW offered

no objection and said it was possible that this was true.

With

reference to his later assignment in Munich from November, 1953,

to the end of 1955, KARLOW stated he was fairly certain he had

not visited Berlin

ago.

He said he has never worn glasses and his weight

has increased only ten pounds since he was in college and

it has never varied more than that

he has never worn a mustache.

Late in the interview, DULIN said upon further

recollection he remembers contacting a Professor HAROLD

MOSELEY, who was Head of Soviet Studies at Columbia University

In New York City, when DULIN was recruiting employees. DULINTS

said that upon thoughtful consideration of his activities at

time he recalled that there was a CIA interest in ob-

taining a well-qualified man for a position in Moscow, He

Said efforts were being made to find a man who was to have

a cover in the Embassy in Moscow. This person to be hired

Was supposed to have a fluent command of the russian language

and he had to be of Anglo-Saxon descent. He said CIA gave

instructions that the man to be placed in the position in

Moscow could not be of Slovak descent (SPULIN said it is

or the face of ROBERTS.S)He said he could definitely state

he had never taken any recruit to Admiral HILLENKOTTER to

discuss employment (DULIN said he does not know and does

the identity of any CIA near

DuLIN Said he is unable to explain why (ROBERTS]S

employment to an individual using the name of DULINS He
