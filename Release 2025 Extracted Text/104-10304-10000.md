: Annual Fitness Report - George Joannides

Operations Officer

00 GS-16

ESN 06481823

DOB 5 July 1922

067180743

1. This Memorandum in Lieu of Fitness Report is prepared

in accordance with HR 20-20, for the period mid-June 1978 through

12 January 1979.

The occasion of the Fitness Report is the

retirement of the rating official.

2. The undersigned was detailed in mid-May to serve

as the Agency's Principal Coordinator for work with the House

Select Committee on Assassinations.

As it became apparent that the volume

of the work required assignment of additional

full-time personnel, the

decision was made that one experienced officer was needed to handle

the Ddo account.

A senior officer experienced in DDO work and available

to serve for several months was requested.

Mr. Joannides was known to

the undersigned by reputation, although not personally, and arrangements

were made for his detail to the work.

While there is no way to outline

the qualifications that one should have for this sort of work, it

became quickly clear that Mr. Joannides was the perfect man for it.

3. Mr. Joannides was responsible for a new procedure in

recording of exchanges with the HSCA. As it developed, the Agency's

logs and records on the status of requests by the HSCA and the Agency's

responses became the only reliable record; it was clear that the HSCA

often did not know the status of business in this respect and time

and time again had to come to this office for clarification.

Beyond

that early contribution to the ordering of the affairs of the office,

Mr. Joannides handled day-to-day follow-ups of requirements by

telephone with the DDO focal point as well as throughout the Ddo.

Further, the firm position that he took with the young investigators

in response to aggressive harassment on some occasions was exactly

what the situation called for.

A person of his maturity and experience

handled the job exactly as required by the situation.

If the peculiar

nature of the work did not call on Mr. Joannides. for all the talents of

his wide experience, it nonetheless was his experience and quick

perceptions that ensured a superior performance. His advice and

---

13-00000

counselling on courses of action to cope with unique situations

was always sound and responsible.

The work in this assignment provided little occasion

for Mr. Joannides to demonstrate attitudes on either EEO matters or

economy, considerations that are required by regulation for comment

in Fitness Reports. As a result, no comment is made.

S. D. Breckinridge

I certify that I have seen the comments in the Narrative section

of this memorandum.

Subject is a hard working, dedicated and effectios afficer who has

proven by performance that he can accomplish assigned operabional tasks

in allowable time limits.

lhe perior covered ov

represents Subject's initial Agency exposure to

those adree schen

management responsibilities which are implicit in a branch chief's

assignment in a station that has 313/employees.

Subject responded

to the challenge of the first echelon supervisory responsibilities

in an exemplary manner.

Subject managed a branch that had a yearly

budget of two million four hundred thousand dollars.

These funds

were judiciously spent on printed propaganda, white and black radio

programs, and on political action operations

which were implemented

via labor, student and professional groups. Subject has the knack of

judiciously blending quality with quantity and in this melding effort,

Subject reflected cost consciousness and effectiveness in the use of

personnel, space equipment, and tunds. subject has a distinct tajI

or political action operations and can translate policy directives

into meaningful action programs by all of his assets. Subject has the

ability to delegate authority and to appropriately fix responsibility

with those officers whom he supervises.

Subject's only discernible weakness is a tendency to be abrupt with

subordinates.

It is believed that this minor shortcoming will be

overcome with the acquisition of added experience in

• the field of

personnel management. On balance therefore, Subject's overall perfor-

mance as a supervisor and as an intelligence officer warrants an 99

CONTINUATION SHEET

*Section C - Narrative Comments

Subject has additional growth potential as an intelligence

officer and as a first echelon supervisor of individuals doing

a basic intelligence task.

Ethnic origins, foreign language

fluency and experience acquired to date generally dictates a

career for Subject in the general arena of Greek operations.

While the major thrust of Subject's career orientation should

be geared toward Greece and its related problems, it is believed

a periodic basis, Subject be directed

his full capacity. In practical terms, this means that out of

any eight-year time cycle, at least two years should be spent

by Subject on non-Greek or even non-European affairs.

This

officer has the potential to be a broad-gauged officer but he

must be stimulated and led in that direction which will fully

harness the totality of his potential.

The rating officer would be pleased to have Subject work

with him at any other

Field Station that might be entrusted to

the rating officer.

Reference is made to paragraph C of subject's previous fitness report

dated 10 January 1963 which is still applicable. During the period

covered by this report subject has done an excellent job in the handling

of a significant student exile group which hitherto had successfully

resisted any important degree of control. Under subject's direction

an exile teachers' group reached a high level of effectiveness in the

propaganda field and was turned over to another case officer.

Subject has effectively terminated unproductive operations in the prop

field (one magazine and a news letter) and is building up Station radio

capability directed at the maintarget.

His high professional standards, complete comprehension of the problems

faced by the Station and strong urge to win in our struggle with the

opposition make it a distinct pleasure to see him take over as Chief

of the PW branch.

activity with sound tradecraft principles and a firm adherence to valid

reporting techniques.

Subject is dedicated and hard working and he has

proven by performance that he is willing to work long hours in order to

doing a basic intelligence task.

Subject's activities come to the

attention of the reviewing officer on

a weekly basis.
