FOR EXAMPLE, RECENTLY LEFT THE COUNTRY AND DONALD C O X

ALSO AWARE THAT THE HIJACKERS IN THAT CASE WERE FREE IN

ALGIERS• ALSO, MCNAIR REASONED THAT SUCH A LARGE SUM WOULD

OVERRIDE ALGERIAN POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THEIR DECISION

ON THE MONEY'S DISPOSAL.

6. THE RECENT RAID ON THE BPP HEADQUARTERS BY ALGERIAN

AUTHORITIES WAS TRIGGERED BY CLEAVER'S OPEN LETTER TO PRESI-

DENT BOUMEDIENE DEMANDING RETURN OF THE HIJACK

MONEY. CLEAVER'S LETTER WAS WRITTEN WITHOUT THE APPROVAL

OF THE REST OF THE BPP MEMBERS IN ALGERIA AND CAUSED A

MAJOR SPLIT IN THE PARTY.

7. MCNAIR APPEARED AT EASE IN FLANIK'S OFFICE AND

QUITE TALKATIVE, ALTHOUGH MUCH OF THE CONVERSATION CENTERED

ON HIS TRIP TO ALGIERS. HE APPARENTLY SURPRISED TO FIND

ALGERIA SUCH AN ADVANCED COUNTRY. HE HAS NO DOCUMENTATION

• EXCEPT AN AMERICAN DRIVER'S LICENSE AND WHEN ASIED IF HE

WISHED TO APPLY FOR A US PPT, HE REPLIED THAT "WE HAVE NO

WHERE TO GO, SO i GUESS NOT." MCNAIR EXPECTED TO RETURN-

LNFALL NEXT FEW DAYS IO SEE WHAT PROGRESS FLANIK HAS MADE ON

PPT APPLICATIONS.
