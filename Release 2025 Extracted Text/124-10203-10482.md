GABRIEL MANVARINO, aka, EX-101.

Reurtel 8/30/61.

According to retel an informant advised that gamblers

in the New Kensington area are saying that since Willie Sams is

never caught in Internal Revenue Service raids he either has a'

highly placed tipster in the Pittsburgh Federal Building or he is

an informant for some Federal agency.

You should take imnediate advantage of this information

and turn it to our benefit.

You should certainly be able to use

this material as an aid in obtaining good information from Sams.

and/or to disrupt his portion of the Mannarino racket empire.
