Tadeusz SZULC

(6) 3(6)

The Station copies of the original reports on SZULC have

been destroyed.

-I attach, however, a memorandun consisting of

selected entries from his card.

2..

All the information is from the same source, a Polish emigre

who knew stuld personally and also had informants in the Polish Embassy.

3.

There is little doubt that SZULC was pro-comnunist at the time,

and that he co-operated with Ignacy SACHS, a cousin who was employed

by the Press Section of the Polish Embassy, and provided him with

"information".: It would, however, be unwise. to jump

to the conclusion

that this collaboration took the forn of espionage, since SZULCe does

not seem

to have made any secret of the relationship.

I can find no evidence that Ignacy SACHS was an intelligence

officer, but he seems to have been an active

propagandist.

He returned

to Poland in 1954. A report from the same source, dated June 1956,

stated that he then occupied.

the Brazilian desk at the Polish Institute

for International Affairs.
