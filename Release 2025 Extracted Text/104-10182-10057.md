Notes on Contacts

The undersigned arrived in parts on the morning of the 25th of March and went: to

the safehouse where the LeFLUMER operater had spent the night and was shortly

to meet subject at the Care tes Sport pear the Pore Matilot.

subject passed by

as

we were having coffee and according to instructions waited elsewhere.

We:

left while the operator collected subalies and tock him to the house, enabling us

to reture at about Il hours.

Subject was dismissed for lunch at about 1145, whereupon the operator and

the undersigned returned to the Dabassy office where after a quick lunch the

questions for the examination were written. The operator met Subject, returned

to the house, and began the examination at about 2430, it having been agreed

we would appear at the safehouse promptly at 1630. he did this to find that the

operator had not concluded the examtnation but

there was sufficient time to

continue which he did.

The examination nas completed about 1845 hours, whereupon

we were informed by the operator that in his opinion subject was not attempting

to decelve on any important points, even

though some

of the more prosafe aspects

of his blography continue to defy logical acceptance.

We then discussed futurc meeting arrangements alth Subject:

subject m1ll

appear tn front of the Cafe Georges V on the Champs Elysees at 1214 and 16 hours

on 6 April: He will walt for five minutes in front of the cafe but will bọt:

enter.

if we are not there he will return

for the alternate.: In any event

alternate contact will be made through Annick. Subject was instructed to clear

up his affairs in Ambert and be prepared to depart for Cermany; however, it wäs

also explained to Subjest that we were not authorized to make a final commitment

to subject and that much as we regretted this, this would be left until 6 April.

Subject was paid Francs 15,500 for which no receip; was obtained since we were

in a hurry to catch a plane for the Hague.: If Subject has any difficultles he

will write Annick. He will not return to Gap. He expects to stay with Josef

Dassaud in Ambert until the night of 5 April when he will travel to paris by

train.

It was further agreed that on or äbout 4 or 5 April Subject .w1ll have

sent a letter to Annickfor "Mike" In which he will conform his arrival and in

double talk inform us if he has had any trouble.

he discussed with platipodis of the Paris station the need to send "Maurice"

to Annick on 4 or 5 April to see if Subject had vritten.

20 March 1959: Upon the receipt of DIR

was Informed that ve would arrive at ambert at about i2 o'clock, and we agreed to

he walted outside for Subject who came out. got

into the car and be drove toe restaurant nich we left immediately as fe was too

crowded and returned on foot to 14 rue ist. Josef house where our conversation was

held.

Incidentally, subject showed the undersigned around the work shop and

lemonstrated how the machine and the

for it are made.

che cannot

help but marvel at subject's Ingenulty, and ability as a tinkerer and pseudo-sor!

of engineer. He said they are producing about 300à month,

sell a few more than

this at 48,000 francs a piece (nearly $100)

However. Subject gets no Income other

than pocket money,

free roon and board where he now lives, and wiil not receive

any until the capital outlay of his other two partners has been amortized.

Taking

the bull by the horris we explained to subject the delay:

A telegram nad been sent

to "certain colleagues" In Paris who were supposed to write a letter to be for -

warded to Subject.

The man to whom the telegram was sent was

on leave and upon

return he was not notified of the telegram ve sent; consequently, Subject was not

informed. as he should have been.

We are terribly sorry and hope that Subject would

appreciate, such a minor matter. "In any event we reminded Subject thai he had not

een promised a letter on or about 1 February

but rather told that he could expect

' hear from us then.

Subject agreed this was so.

subject was far less

interested in explanation than a decision.

He rhetorically

asked

whether he was acceptable, adding he was obliged to assume he as not, and

commerting

that although there are

"many two legged people in America also" he

thought he was probably a unique persem from the point of view of language ability,

experience as an operator in dangerous

situations.. etc.

We replied this:

One man

(the psychologist) has already come all the way from the States just to see Subject

and another was onhis way.

"Headquarters" attaches to subfect's candidature and that far from beirs a dead

subject could fairly conclude the importance

Issue, Subject's prospects were good, although all depended on him.

le then turned to the matter of Subject coming

to Paris.

Subject explained

that Paul (

) had been sent by the Paris station

to Annick and had rot done very

well.

He had failed to convince Annick that he was

sent by "iike (Friganza) and

apparently although we did not go inio the details of

this, he did not det the message

straight.. In any case Subject immediately said

that he could come to paris anytime although he would be obliged to travel

Illegally.

This because he had permitted his identity document to expire as of 14

February 1959.

However, Subject leil he could make the joumey by train without

being caught because the police are not checking most trains.

He did not want to:

travel by car because. he

had heard there are occasional road blocks. (this may be

true for the undersigned ran into one. on the drive from Paris to Ambert).

Subject

also said he could stay as long as

need by but it was absolutely essential "that he

not be obliged to stay at a hotel -- he could either stay with Annick or at a place

put at his disposal by

us.

1918, In CoorBle, USSR. At that time Georgle was al free country and not

status had a great influence on his behaviour in the porlod which followed

the rantly'a Imigration Into Prance In, 1921.

subject feels he acquired a certaln prejudicial class attitude

and abided by the prineiple of noblesse oblige. In other words he feels

that If. you pretend to be something, you have to act accordingly. His

concept of nobility has evolved into a concept of dignity and pride in his

work.

The fansly left Georgiä when the Subject was three.. They fled

before the soviet invasion. Subject feels that his real existence began

at this point.

Because the father had provided himself with certain wontes,

the family was able to live coafortably and even opulently. However, the

vicissitudes of life brought the family progressively to material degradation

and financial difficulties which greatly influenced subject's way of think-

ing thereafter. Whereas the family had previously lived in an artifiolal

feudalistic way, life became tough. Subject feels that the family was

brought into more direct contact with reality and that this was not

necessarily a bad influence.

6. Subject actually did not want to leave Georgla. He felt it was

a flight rather than a tactical retreat. Apparently he has never been

able to accept this huniliating defeat and it may be that part of his

current motivation for affiliation involves his perception of an opportunity

to take countermeasures against the Soviets. He Is a person who cannot

tolerate being beaten in competition.

was a precocious child and he expertenced disillusionment in his family

and in society. It is as if he suddently diacovered to his great dis-

appointment that there was no Santa Claus.

8. At first Subject felt his disilluslonment was unique and peculiar

to his particular life experience, but he soon discovered that his dis-

content was characteristic of others: He experienced this fighting'

attitude within himself and he reflected it in his non-conforming. be-

havlour.

and he has always wanted to help others in order to help himself. In öther

words he is motivated to helping others in order to obtain love and

affection. This need for love and affection is probably the most primary

of his motives.

he was too young to understand it. However, he feels he revolted against

First of all he is

motivated to succeed out of a spirit of revenge, and secondly he is self-

confidant and optimistic.that he will succeed despite the hazards of the

undertaking. He is like a man who wants to kill an elephant -- all he

wants from us is a high-powered rifle -- then he feels he would be equal

to the elephant.

12. Subject also seems to reflect disappointment in his father as

a personal ideal. He regards his father as a very independent person,

kind but profoundly selfish, büt who would nevertheless give you the

shirt off his back. His father was fond of the children, loved the whole

fantly and was happy when he saw others happy. However, Subject is con-

vinced that if his father had succeeded, none of the things that. happened

In his life would have come to pass.

He feels that his notner's sulaide

failure to succeed.

13.

When his father and sister returned to Georgia, Subject was driven

to despalr by the breaking-up of the family. The death of his mother and

the departure of his father and sister was quite a threat to his security.

He tried to hold hid father back and even threatened his that because of

Integration of the famtly. If Subject found bimself in the same

situation todey, he would act in exactly the same way.

14. The father apparently retured to Georgla because he wanted to

die in Georgia. Subject feels that his father was doing something important

to realize his objectivey or to achieve his purpose. Homever, he foela

his father accepted defeat by returning to Georgla to die.. The mother

did not go with the father and apparently was at her wits end after the

father left.

subject regards his nother as the axle of the family and

when he lost her through suicide, he feels she deserted him.

15. Subject's sister followed her father to Georgia out of a spirit

of affection and sacrifice.

She felt that her father needed her and

subject feels she was a tributary

of his mistakes. The sister has a Ph.D.

in languages and taught courses in school. At the time of Stalin the

children would say "we have done this and that thanks to Stalin" and she

would reply "you are individuals and you have done this or that without

Stalin." As a result she was arrested and sent to a concentration camp.

With the change of regimes she obtained her freedom and got her job back.

16. The sister's husband returned to Russia also and Subject believes

that because he had served in the German army he may have been sent to a

concentration camp. He feels the Intellectual level of the brother-in-law

is lower than that of the sister..

The brother-in-law apparently has an

Inferiority complex. He enigrated to France at a much later date and

apparently could not adapt himself and regretted having left Russia.

18. Subject was the baby of the family and still 1s. Whereas he

was born In 1918, his brother was born in 1916 and his sister in 1915.

Subject was more expressive of affection, particularly for his mother,

whereas his brother was more timid, shy, and independent. When the

brother saw Subject getting the mother's attention, he tried to replace

Subject. This sibling rivalry may continue to date, for example, the

brother learned that Subject was seeing a girl whom he knew. The brother

advised the girl to leave Subject alone.

19. Subject denies he is Jealous of his brother. He admits his

brother has been successful but in his own sphere. Subject's new found

philosophy is not to accept the fact that he has been unsuccessful, but

to try to explain why he has not. In other words he seems to be notivated

to obtain greater knowledge of himself:

20.

subject does not consider himself as a Georgian; this 1s

of no

importance to him. He regards the flight from Georgia as a defeat and as

a loss of the motherland which he has never accepted. He feels he was a

Georgian as a

child büt the most important aspect is that he feels he was

defeated by the necessity of the family's flight from Georgia.... He offers

as an analogy the fact that he was committed to prison; this was a defeat

for him.

In other words he was not bothered by the prison life but by the

fact that he made a wrong calculation in taking on a bad associate and con-

sequently being arrested and imprisoned. Therefore defeat appears to be

the frat factor In his life expertence.

21. At a certain time in bis childhood subject iived near some

fontes Georgian resistante no were flenting asainst the Soviets. Subject

regarded these persons as uneducated but nevertheless

affectionate.

He feels he certainly must have been influenced by the

excitins stortes which they told him about thel, fighta and mary exploita

Ho reals he must alad have been impressed by their patrollers the feele

they expressed themselves in a vara and enthralling manner which exalted

and deeply impressed him., He feels this particular association may account

for hits passion which he always puts in the execution of whatever ke

undertakes. One of the prineipal determinants of this man's behaviour

Is apparently the very strong desire to succeed and accomplish.

22. subject feels that throughout his school expertence perhaps only

one or tho professors understood him. These particular professors thought

that' it was often necessary in life to "swallow" a grest deal of useless

"stuff" so that thereafter certain essential problems could be more easily

digested. Subject feels that these professors were superior and that he

understood them, whereas he regarded the others as apparently idiotic

or worthless.

23. Subject was influenced by heroes whom he heard about such as

Lindbergh, Edison, Hitler, Einstein, and several others. He realized that

If such people existed, It meant that the possibility to act either for

good or for

evil also existed. He did not idertity with any one hero 1a

particular but always wished that he could have been one of them. He did

not actually want to be one of them, but wanted to resemble heroes in

general.. Subject always pemaine-- remembers certain great men mentioned

in history. He feels that these great men gave him the concept that a

certain order was necessary for the level of the people. However, 1t

appears he was disillusioned in these men and his ideals were sheken be-

cause he later learned to his dismay that they could count abject or

monstrous acts.

Subject feels he has made many mistakes in life but how.

ever big these mistakes may be, he does not feel they have reflected his

basic character.. He feels that his character was basically based by the

desire to become a worthwhile individual, even at the cost of tehaving

wrongly. He feels that if the only oriterson for judging a nan to his:

mother Atrection. However, he Identittes with his father in the respect

that both never achieved anything sighificant and that they both may have

disappolnted the mother. subject misses his mother's love and he feele

his life was broken up when she died. He found himself completely alone

and all his illusions disappeared. He tried to find affection through

others. He feels the need for affection is a big part of himself but

on the other hand "I am a complicated person."

26. Subject claims he has learned the difference between a man and

a woman: This 1s likely to have a good deal of meaning to him, particularly.

as regards his relationship with his mother.

He regards wonen as allogical

and to be determined by a psycho-feminine education. This is enough to

tip us.off that he should not be exposed to handling by females.

27. Subject claims he has learned from his personal experience in

life rather than from the experience of others. In other words he has

educated himself in the school of life and has derived little from the

aotual formal school situation. For example, he claims his mothers

opinions had importance only at the time she was rendering her opinions;

thereafter they were not influential as far as he was concerned. This

may be important as

regards training. It. is likely that he would prefer

to proceed with the task in actuallty rather than to learn about per-

forming the task through the experiences or training of others.

awrul long time to make a decision in connection with him. Because of

this, he soned the forelen Legion and left immediately for North Africa

same time:

rulfilling his oblisations toward the Prench ailitary service.

In the beginning he was satisfied but later he was of the opinion that

France was an Insoherent mess, and he bitterly regretted that he had

become acquainted with people who obvlously did not know wat they wanted.

This experience did not have a great influence on his character except:

that it expressed a profound dislike for irresolute persons.

dicates that subject is do impatient fellow who destres Immediate action

is dealt with proeptly, he may satisfy his interests elsewhere. However,

in the current instance he has no alternative and he is forced to go along

with normal procedures which he may regard as a waste of time, but will

accept..

"29.

Subject feels that he married because he regarded marriage as

necessary to build a family and to make a 'hone. He feels his marriage vas

a mistake because, even though he understands the value of the principles

involved, principles which were inculoated by his father, It is ridiculous

to marry just for the sake of principles without the necessary sentiments..

He feels that at the time he was merely abiding by precepts of his father

without thinking of the possible consequences. However he soon discovered,

In fact, a family did not represent anything at all, and that creating the

family was aggravating the incoherence and

the division of society. In

view point getting married meant building a wall around himself. It also

meant that instead of finding a partner who complemented him, all that he

obtained from the partnership was a

reflection of himself.

He feels that the so-called spiritual intimacy is a fallacy. He

claims

that, sexually speaking, women are necessary but he fails to say why it

is necessary to build a separate world with it.

30.

As was explained above, the reasons for his marriage are connected

with his family education. He does not regard his marriage as a complete

fiasco.

He regards his wife as very nice.

He thinks he was nice, too.

They sot along fairly well with one another but did not live very con-

fortably. He did not feel there was any evolution in the marrlage and he

admits to his debit that he married his ulfe because he wanted to ex-

portence what it meant to have children. Actually, hovever, he did not

want children. However, he assumed that the marrlage would produce a

child whon he had exactly imagined. In other words he wanted an exact

reproduction of himself. He obtatned a daughter who was, beautiful,

alvays laughing, but because of hits separation after his arrest, he has

Ignored what has happened with the child. His wife alao had a second

to do it again, he would not marry.

31. During the war when Subject was in Germany, he göt Involved in

a false documents business and created a gang which he led.

The purpose

of the group was to repatriate or liberate war prisoners. The black

market was a worthless branch, technically speaking. of the organization.

Its only purpose was to solve financial problems. However, it is true that

the black market reached such a magnitude that a person who was interested

only in making money would have found it quite satisfying and sufficient

in Itself:

As a whole, the technical efficiency of his gang satisfied

him. They had freedon of notion and security. Subject was arrested be-

cause of a carelessness or a slip,dot in the actual functioning. of the

gang, but rather on the part of one of the men whom they were helping.

32. Through this experience Subject learned that it was very inter-

esting to know the weaknesses of authorities and to play these weaknesses

or. forces against one another.. His emotions corresponded

to a joy or

being the sole master. of his actions and moves. He feels that if he were

to find himself in this sort of situation again, he mould act in exactly.

the same way.

33. When subject was arrested by the Gestapo, he was considered by

the Germans to be a very important prey. He played the game and led the

Germans to believe

that he was an important prey in the hope that such

belief woüld give him certain advantages..

Although he realized he could

He continued this gage

until he say that the end was near. Por excople, there was a great nood

of gas in Germany and he figured he could gain time by telling the Germans

he had invented a very interesting notor which they could profitably use.

The Germans took his offer Into consideration and poatponed his execution.

Shortly therearter he was liberated by the Americans.

34.

Inia veignette indicates that-Subject has the developed, capacity

or a con man and that he la capable of imaginatively talking hingelf out

of rather tight altuatlone. This, of course, to an outstanding qualifloation

as regards the requirements of the project.

35. Subject attacked a bank in 1950. At the time he wes narried and

was the father of one child. He was working in a model makers ahop and

although he was not well off, he was earning a decent living. However,

because of his love

for risk and out of friendship for another relion, he

agreed to partloipate in the bank attack. Apparently the other fellow

trusted subject. because he knew of subject's war activities and he figured

that because Subject had been able to acoomplish certain illegal activities

that he was quite capable of attacking a bank.

The attack was carefully

planred. Because there were only two on the team they were compelled in

view of the smallness of his staff to give extra ittention to their plan.

36. According to subject he was

close to this young ftlerd who.

solicited his financial assistance.

At first, Subject felt that the other

fellow was crazy to dare to attack a bank. He also had the normal twinge

of consclence and asked himself the question "is It right to do harm by

robbing a bank?" Subject never felt that the tro alone would be able to

attack the bank successfully. Consequently, they determined to knock

over a Jewelry shop first. At each point in the developments Subject

wanted to withdraw from the whole deal by saying "If my mother learned of

this, she would die." They postponed the job indefinitely. Homever, hla

mother died in the meantive and his friend again approached him and told

him that now that his mother was dead, there was no longer such a danger.

Subsequently they knocked over the jewelry store.

subject's chief notivation for such an activity appears to be

the following: (a) Friendship. Apparently subject wiil do anything for

a friend.

(b) Action.

Apparently Subject relishes novelty and excitement

and daring-do.

Apperent ly he 18a jesse Janes type: (C) Enotional outlet

for success Of Planning. Apparently Subject Indulges himself in probled

solving and obtains a compulalve satiofection if his plans succeed. In

other words, he is motivated to carry out such an'action because of hid

ataplaced interest In successfully engineering and accomplishins a Job.

(d) Money. Subject apparently is not motivated for mater at reward. In

However, the friend returned after having spent his money.

Previously subject had told him "you got your money for the marrlage;

nou leave me alone."

However, the friend had not married and was now

des: rous of robbing a bank in order to finance another Intended inflage:

subject agreed that this would be the last job. They cased the joint very

carefully and then comnitted the act.

The other fellow apparently threw

his money around, was arrested, and squealed. The police came to

to the Spanish border. Subject was fleeing to the Pyrenees because he

had learned that his bank deal partner had been arrested and had talked,

and that the police were after him. Subject voluntarily admits that he

loet control

over himself and that he had failed to plan in case he failed

and had to flee.

He had not foreseen or prepared himself fur such a con-

sequence. If he were to find himself again in the same situation, he would

prepare an escape even if it were only necessary for the satisfactory

planning of the project.

39. However.

the question which arises in this examiner's mind is

why Subject panicked in his flight. It could have been that he un.

consclously.wanted. to.get caught and to be punished In order

to relieve

his guilt. It this 19 so, then important consideration should be given

to this aspect

of subject's personality as regards planning the project.

pressed by the fact that he had greatly disappointed his close relatives

and because he was looked upon as a nolay and rash fellow rather than as

a can capable of carrying out a crime

and aldo then he was arrested by the Prench. He feele these two failures

are consequences of the poor senner in which he chose hid friends. me

feele it to now up to hid to take all the necessary precautions in order

to avoid the sene pitfalla in the future:

42. Tere have been times In this man's life when he felt that the

entire world seemed to conspire against him and when everything seemed to

collapse before hla, yet he has alvays felt there were ways to get ouf of

a ness principally by virtúe of working. He continues to belleve that

unless a man is so weak both physically and morally, It 1s always possible

for him to get back on his feet or at least to hope that this 1s possible.

Consequently, even when he was. broke, Subject always belleved there was a

posalbility to fight and conquer. It Is likely he will always have hope

and optimism.

43.

As regards his philosophy on the two projects which involved

Iberating french prisoners and the bank attack, he was betrayed bỳ

another, Actually, however, he could not have become angry at these

persons because he felt his betrayal was unimportant. However, these

persons lost his esteem because he feels there are certain moral values

which he holds dearly, namely friendship. This would indicate that he is

more in contempt of himself for having miscalculated than angry with the

other person for having betrayed' him. However, Subject does not feel that

any of his mistakes, regardless of their size and consequence, have serious

consequences as regards his near or distant future. There is no question

that his mistakes have seriously reduced his circumstances of life, but he

1s optimistie and it is likely he regards this assignment as a golden

opportunity nich not only permits him a chance of success, but does not

censure hin for his past deeds.

Consequently, he feels that to be dis

couraged about the future 1s nonsense for if there is a future, there is

hope.

Although Subject has seen many things in his life and has had

many opportunttles to becone angry, he feels he has neer coapletely iost

self control. He feels he has always been the master of his actions as

all times and that trese actions could have been changed by his own volition.

Loved hia.

46. Subject tends to become embarrassed and confused when certain

persons who ask or accept somethins tron him display too much gratitude.

In other words, too largere dose of affection will unseat Subject despite

the fact that he continusily solicits affection.

47. Subject has continually deceived and disappointed his nother

he would behave nicely, but each time he was thrown out of school. He is

convinced she wanted this for his good and not for the satisfaction of.

having a perfect child. However, it is likely that the mother's over-

solicitousness was actually compensatory for her basic rejection of

subject.

Therefore, she wanted him to be perfect so that she could love

film. consequentiy, it is likely that she did things for him, but she did

things with hin for herself. In other

words, she wanted him to be perfect

so that he could be worthy of her love. He was not perfect, probably did

not obtain her love, and consequently is continually seeking the love of

other persons. However, he cannot accept this fact as regards his mother

and dentes she did not act in his interest. One of his chief defenses 1g

denial, that 18, simply assuming the attltude that such and such was not

true when he probably believes it was true.

48.

subject's actions are often Impulsive and unreasoned. such

Irrational behaviour usually takes place with another person despite the

fact that there may be no particular tie or affection between him and the

other person. Subject is unable to explain why this is so and intellectual

realizes that any explanations which ne might offer are not sufficient

to explain such behaviour and his emotional state.

In other words, this

man's impulsiveness and tendence to behave Irrationally and to his own

disadvantage and in his own disinterest

amounts to a coupulsion which is

sufficient to determine his behaviour but which is unconscious and not

In this respect he is

propelled by an uncontrollable force.. This is an important point of

consideration as regards his utilization in this project.

The explosion occurred

so quickly that there was no lamediate pain but the people around him be-

cane panicky. He remained cold blooded and gave the order to remove ali

The policenen strongly advised him never

that the workd wil change and there will be no discrimination. He also

hopes to acquire, If necessary, a nationality In which case he will feel

he actusily belongs to society. However, he feels that soclety 1s

anxious. to stamp and label individuals and it may be that he would prefer

to be an individualist who is outside of society than to be a member of

soclety who is required to conform. Since this person lives in the

present, it 1s very difficult for him to imagine what his future will be.

51. Despite the fact that this man is motivated by rather vivid

ideals, he still strikes the examiner as a practical realist who thinks

and acts in a matter of fäct manner.

He has experienced a good deal of.

life and he

is quite sophisticated.

52. Subjeot feels that & friend would regard him as unstable,

affectionate, alid a day dreamer:

53.

subject reels that a critic would say of him that the majority

of his connercial undertakings have brought results which are considerabl

Lover than hoped for. Consequently, he feels he is elther en opt plat

or a Joker, on else hts slews on the possibilities of accomplishing

things are not very healthys

54₴

In his defense he emphasizes that in his option the value of an

achtevement does not consist of its spectacular magnitude on in its

multiplicity

for example, he feels it 3 not necessary to say 1good

noming" 100 times in order to understand the meaning and purpose of

"good norning." Also he does not feel it is necessary to mass produce

a machine in order to fully understand its function. However, he realizes

that, commercially

speaking, it is more rational to mass produce the

machine but the repitition does not Interest him. In his opinion the

creative idea and

the prototype have a much greater value and importance

than the setting up of the factory which will popularize the prototype.

To illustrate his feeling further he Is of the opinion that one single

thought from a great thinker appears to him to be much more valuable

than the millions of books which are published yearly.

55. In describing himself Subject reveals that he always tries his

hardest to keep his promises. He also feels that he sometimes appears to

talk somewhat rashly but he feels this is due to the fact that he thinks

fast and he is able to ses quickly the components and the essence of a

problem in its varlous prospectives. He is able to rapidly synthesize.

In other words he learns extremely fast and he

sets the point Immediately

He is so quick that he will understand what you are. trying to say before

you finish the sentence.

56. subject is: unable to see himself in terms of what he would like

to be.

In order for him to display himself, It would be necessary that he

would be another person altogether.

However, he feels that, everything

relative, perhaps he should show more'strength of character, be a little

more coupromising, more realistic, and less sentimental. However, this

would imply that he would then find himself in an environment in which

there was no room for sertiment -- in which case his personallty would

out of place.

57. It Is Subject's expertence that his friends love him for what

he is. He likes his triends as they are, probably because they are as

they are. The idea of attemptins to change a frtend lo unthinkable for

him. He loves them for their bad points as well as thelr good points:

58. Subject Is an optimist but also a pessimista

He, feels he will

never be able to reach his ideals because hits material Ideal (social

refors) is so distant that he would need to lead many

order to attain it. It aight be unfair to call this man a pessiolet?

It 1s more likely he is a realist and perhaps a cynio.

59. This man denies that he has any interest or emotional

attachment to Francé at this time. However, It is likely he was patriotio

at the time of the war.. Since he has been branded a criminal and has

been deprived of certain rights and privileges, he now perhaps feels re-

Jected and in turn is rejecting France as his fatherland. Nevertheless,

he strikes the examiner as a true Frenchman - he thinks and feels like a

Frenchman and 1s certainly not a Russian in his personality. It is likely

that he identifles the French authorities with the police.

He cannot

tolerate rejecting attitudes. He is like an outsider who Is 100: ing in.

It may be he has the "sour grapes" attitude by wnich he feels that since

he cannot have what he wants, it is not too good anyway.

60. Subject Is not a planner. Despite his interest in invertion

and the fact that he has pulled off a number of capers, he is more of an

Instigator, a leader, and an executor. In order for him to be successful

in future projects, it is necessary. that someone else plan and then tell

him exactly what to do.

61. Subject is currently involved in the. Invention business which

he started alone. He is the owner and exploiter of several patents and

certain persons are financlally and technically interested in his in-

ventions. He Is faced with a problem at this time. He is involved in

the initial and preliminary phases with us and consequently is put on

t'e fence as regards his Invention business,

Furthermore, If he were to

Join us, he would relinquish

everything to his business partners.

62. This person will open himself up readily to an open personality

He will be secretive with an inhibited of secretive personality. Con-

sequently, the best person to work with this individual is a direct.

expressive and visible personality.

63. Mis person's spotal drives seen to involves (a) General l

provement of living conditions for everybody. In other words he 1s a

humanitarian He lo not necessartly an activistie social reforer.

(b) Improvement of his own standard os living. He has an Inclination

to better things and he feele thie is the disease of all inventors:

645

subject expresseS himself freely, is discursive, voluble, and

is able to carry on a conversation Indefinitely, This la tretcally Preach

but, in particular, it represents an oral characteristic. In other words,

he ls all mouth. He both expresses himself orally and he is driven by

desire to obtain oral supplies by Incorporation. What this means is that:

he will eat you up.

65. Subject reflects superfor intelligence, is capable of abstract

conceptualization, and is able to deal in symbols.

66. Subject is a narcissistic character who feels that because others

don't love him, he needs to love himself.. In other words, he 1s quite in

love with himself and acts accordingly.

67. Subject tends to rationalize and to offer socially acceptable

reasons

for his individualistic behavior.

68. Subject strives chlefly for emotional satisfaction.

69. Subject is An altrüistic but at the same time he is selfish. He

will do things for the community with the hope of getting something out of.

It: for himself, Both of these drives merge in a unitary fashion."

He Is

motivated by both at the same time.

70.

Subject denies nationalistic motives for his actions and prefers

to regard them as being primarily human!tarian. .

subject is action-oriented

and loves to take risk and gets a kick out of excitement and adventure.

## Page 33

/18/

71. subject acts because he thinks he is right:

72. subject acts because he thinks he will succeed and because he

regards what he undertakes as Important. he is egotistical in thts regard.

73. Subject needs to prove to others that he lo successtul. He 10

self confident in his prowess but is Insecure that others may not regard

hia as adequato as he feels he 1a.

74. "It is Interesting to note that subject particlpated in the

release of the 13 Prench prisoners not out of patriotle motives, but to

satisty hia taste for action. If they vere German prisoners, he would

have done the sane thing.

Actually, subject admired the German army, had

yapathy for Gernans, but did not wish the French to be haried, This 1s

qulte paradoxical but understandable in terms of the subject's personality.

His emotionalized ideals are not defined in teris of politics or

nationalities, but are determined by a vague desire to help others who

need. 1t. This combination can mislead him and get him into difficulty;

for example, his accomplice in the bank robbery.

75. Subject 1s a rank individualist.

He is a non-conformist.

However, he realizes he must cope with the community, must sacrifice for

the

of the community, and must not harm others. In this

regard it is unlikely that Subject has ever committed physical assault,

nor is it likely that he would in the future.. No matter what the other

person is or represents to Subject, he is still a human being whom:

Subject respects.

76. Although Subject is basically an exhibitionist, he Is not

Inclined to bragging or to exhibit himself in a transparent or patent

fashion. He 1s too sophisticated. However, he necds attention and 1s

Ilkely to do things in order to get attention. This is what he did in

18 schools.

77. As was previously mentloned, Subject helped French prisoners

get back to France during the war. He thought it was the right thing to

do but did not do It just for france.. He was paid for 1t but he gave

his money to help the prisoners. In terms of

his hierarchy of motives,

it is likely that this person acts according

to what he considers to be

right.

He also expresses self pride in doing the outstanding. the difficult,

---

## Page 34

119/

and for which he is not necessartly being paid. He acts out of principle,

with no special reason.

He helped the prench prisoners despite the faot

that he had sympathy for

the Germans. However, his sympathy for the

Germans was based on the fact that sone Georgiand had relatives in Gerany

and he preferred that the cermans would defeat the russians

-78.

Another reason he helped the Prench prisoners was that ho rolt

that they were sufferins and because they vere surferine, he wanted to

rellove then by helping them return to their country.

Thus he was beat

on nurturance:-

He alrey, stands ready to help someone uno 1o in need:

79, subjente notsvation cor arilliation to positive, spontaneous.

voluntary, and intense.

He likes the Americans but finds it a bit diffioutt

to analyze thie sentiaent. He feels the Americans have made certalo

political mistakes but they reflected a fundamental and basie sincerity

which he likes.

He understands the United States has political Interest

but he 1s willing to go along out of admiration for the sincerity of the

Americans. He is not looking for special compensation. Generaily, he is

quite willing to do what is asked without rational reasons. In other

words; his motivation 1s typically emotional and Is understandable 1n

terms of his character organization. He feels that a person is capable

of doing anything for love of nothing. He is inclined to put things on a

personal basis.. He doesn't belong to any community. He feels his early

years in Georgia have had no effect on his way of thinking or on his way

of perceiving life. He likes the ilberty which exists in America and the

fact that people are treated as individuals rather than as numbers.

80. Subject's motives are genuine and are compatible with his

outlook on life.

They are not necessarily original or sophisticated but

they are personal and therefore bona fide. Furthernore, Subject is really

on the shelf in Gap. He is controlled in his movements and is restricted

in his aspirations and consequently is unable to realize his freedon and

to develop himself as an Individual. Consequently, the assignment

represents a unique opportunity for him to rise abore his present re-

stricted level of existence.

81.

portance to events of life.

Subject is a very sensitive person and he attaches great im-

---

## Page 35

.120/

82. Another important characteristic la his curlosity and his laterest

83. Another interesting proclivity is Subject's tendency to assume

blame for the mistakes of others even when he is not necessartly guilty.

As a child he was gifted but undisciplined and an unsultable student

who couldn't concentrate and adapt to the school fituation.

As a result

he was alveya in trouble but, more interestingly, he was alvage sled to

assume responsibility for the anti-sodial actions of others;

Whether

be did this for masochistic reasons or because he wanted to obtain the

approval of othere for whon he sacrificed to difficult to deteraine.

What Is true, however, Is that he will subalt himself for punishment

even though he has not done wrong. He may do this out of friendship

In order to have others feel greatful to him. He has the attitude he

should be punlated for doing wrong, but should not be degraded for doing

right. Subject has always realized that he has needed help as regards

his emotional problems. He likes to be helped materially, not as and 1t-

self (?) but because material help involves the implication of moral

help. For example, a dentist in Gap offerted to help subject In his 1n-

ventions without asking for advantages. This means a lot to Subject. He

attaches small importance to money and he derives a tremendous satisfaction

out of helping others or being helped.

84. Subject reflects a tremendous vitality that has, in the past,

expressed itself through false attempts such as the bank robbery, etc.

He feels he is not being used as he should and that there 1s a power

within himself, a creative urge of movement, a pover of realization.

It is highly emotionally charged and he feels he is capable of doing much

more than he has in the past. Although he feels he is a complicated

person, he does not feel he Is difficult to understand:

85. Subject likes to act intelligently and sensibly. He strives

for efficiency. For exampie, herterr if a person were to ask him to open

a window, he feels it is up to him to decide as regards the proper method.

The efficiency plus the results are his rewards. Consequently, he likes

practical work which involves an intellectual effort.

86:

Subject has a highly developed verbal Intelligence and he 1s

able to amplity and eleborate on his 1des

87. prior to the lost session on the 10th of January SubJeot wea

routinely contacted by the French police mo kere investigating his

activities in Parts at thile time: As a result of this contact, he vas

markedly apprehensive and pro-occupted with the serfousness of tnts Visit

by the police and vas not able to freoly devote himselt to psychological

analysis as heretofore. me important point here is that subject ie an

extremely alort and yiellant person. Mla primary motive, is, of course,

"-preservatten and he lo Tikely to over react and to become emotionally

upset with provocation.

He needs the guiding influence of a more nature

and expertenced person who la in control of the situation.

88. Anöther Important aspect of his relationship with us appears to

be the fact that he consclously or unconsciously feels he has "arrived"

and 18 acceptable to us.. In other words he feels that perhaps a decision

has been made which is in his favor. This reflects his on desire to be

accepted together with his estimation of the situation:

89. This individual, despite his past exploits, is not necessarily

a hostile person. In other words he will not do harm nor will he hurt

others who are weaker than himself. He will act out of exigency but he

will deliberately avoid being sadistic or mantonly cruel.

90. • Por some reason Subject exhibits ä marked degree of loneliness

and isolation at this time. He seems to be seeking cospanionship.

91. Subject prefers to work alone as regards technical research, but

as regards the execution of an operation he prefers to te with someone or

part of an organization. He knows he can rely upon hirself when he 1s

alone and that others had been unrellable In his past. However, if It 18

necessary for him to work with two or more individuals, he will accept 1t.

92.

subject admits of physical inferiority feelings by virtue of his

size and strength but he denies he has feelings of intellectual inferiority.

He depends more upon his mental faculties than upon his physical. "I have

no fear of an elephant if I have a gun."

93. Subject is a stubbom fellow who does not like, to be defeated

and he strives to conquer.

94. subject alvave looks for causes. He lo no magical thinker but

tende to be rational and realistic despite his strong emotional re-activity

which can be almost explosive at tines.

95. subject particularly strives not to be regarded as bad or evil.

In fact, he la hot a crialnal type but 1o a neurotic charester who has

expressed his conflicto and alfficulties in non-conforming behavlour.

At the same time he to not anti-social. He is a person uno has

differences of opinton and confitera wich the soctel order.

96. Subject does not regard binself as an' expert or

He realizes his short comings and he hopes his

complemented by training.

97. Subject relles quite heavily upon humor for relief of tension

and as a defense against the development of anxiety and inter-personal

relationships:

98.

An important aspect of this man's personality and history would

appear to be his so-called accident proneness.

He 15 like the cat in the

Disney film who, while chasing the mouse and having his entire attention

directed to the catching and incorporation of the mouse, inadvertantly

gets himself run over by a truck. His first reaction to being splattered

by the truck 1s one of disappointment as regards not arriving at the goal;

1.8., catching the mouse. He thereupon acts upon feelings of revenge on

the mouse for having caused his unfortunate accident. In addition, this

example signifies thät Subject is likely to keep his eye too mich upon the

goal and Insufficiently upon the hazards involved in reaching the goal. It

may be argued that Subject's philospphy in his past operations are related

In some manner to his lack of attention to such details. His history 1s

that of the unlucky cat who manages to get himself run over successfully.

99. This person can be quite discouposed by the surprise of un-

expected occurrences.

100. Despite defeat Subject is able to pick himself up, figure things

out, start all over in a nore systematic way, and continue in his pursuit

of his goal.: Consequently, he does learn by experience. His mistakes are

101.

subject is capable of experiencing melancholy or depressive

mood swings. However, he maintains a Bey-facads and he attempts to

relleve his depressive feelings with lightness. Underneath the gay

appearance, hovever. Is seriousness. One of the chief motives 1s hia

curlousity. He seeks the unknow but when he approaches the unknown, he

experiences a certain feeling which he recognizes as a threat to hia

enotlonal secursty and he le ambivalent about proceeding or withdrawing.

He has an laternal fear of southing which he doesn't knon of understand

gutdance, and consideration of all the possible eventualities. He has a

fear of getting hinself into something which he cannot get out of and ble

Immediate reaction is to turn around and go avay without having solved

the problei. Consequently, he needs a person of greater intelligence wo

18 able to help him to evaluate the realities of his situation or

predicarent. It must be kept in wind that his self-preservation 18

stronger than his desire to solve probles.

102. Subject 1s likely to be loyal to a superior and may even be

critical of himself in relation to the superier.

In other words, he would

like to be as useful as possible in order to express his loyalty, but may

feel Inadequate In that he requires the pretection of his supertor.

103. This person puts no stock in emblems or signs of rank or

reputation. He regards such signs as identifying labels only and 1s not

impressed or motivated for glory symbols. If he were to accomplish an

outstanding feat, he would not want a medal -- all he. would want was a

remark froa an important figure to the effect "well done, thank you."

He feels it is sufficient only for him to know he has done well.

104. Subject will attempt to assume leadership on the team but

1t may be that 1f his partner 1s superior, he would be a better follower

than he would be a leader of a less adequate person. He is more of a

dependent than independent person in terms.of his inter-personal relation-

ships; furthermore, he acts on sentiment and impulse and consequently

his judgment is questionable. This would indicate that he would work

better with a nore soher-minded, calculating individual. He 1s 1lkely

expertenced, nature case officer.

106. In vion of the supposed length of the atssion, it to likely

that a short tore operation vould be more coapatible with subject's assels

Security Flaps -

A.

During the latter part of Wi Il subject was arrested by the Ger-

man police for forgery. He was not unduly held by the criminal lavesti-

sation branch of the police but pessed on to the Gestapo.

vithout gasoline.

He offered to draw the designs of the notor and was

able to stall long enough to be liberated by components of the advan..

cing U.S. Army.

In 1946-47 subject and an accomplice coumitted two robberies of

Jewelry stores.

C.

In 1949 subject robbed a hank of 1, 000, 000 FT. IT.

His accomplice

Subject was apprehended while attempting to cross the Franco-Spanish

border. He was sentenced to ten years in prison of which be served

only five, receiving parole for good behavior. Upon release In 1955, he

was exiled on perole to Cap, France where he worked as an architect.

To our knowledge thereis no indication that subject is known to

be associated with KUBARK.

gency channel with Headquarters 18 belng established. This channel l

to be used only in the event subject finds himself stranded or for

dire emergency.

5. Security:

The agent is very security consclous and will follow suy direction

in the interest of securty.

6. Control:

On this point here are several aspects for consideration.

He is

under contract to us and although he 1e not too interested in money, he

does enjoy Its benefits and realizes that it will continue so long a8

he does a good job.

The more: Important built in control is the fact

that he will be under false documents,

and being stateless, he i8 con-

pletely dependent on XUBARK to perpetuate bis quasi legal exietence and

to eventually legalize, his status.

Added to this is the control which

stens fron the prospect of resettlement in another country.

This vould

give him status as a citizen.

Realizing these points, subject 1s nore

than wililag to play ball with us.

7. Prior contacts with any security service:

As stated In 3B (2) above, the only brush subject has bed in the

past. was with Gestapo and French police. These vere prior to his re-

cruitment by KUBARK and were not as a result of I.S. activity.

Subject has undergone plastle surgery in order to change his appearance,

also a toupe was ade to further assist in the changing of his outward

appearance. This action tas designed to preclude any possibility of

and will permit subject to make trips under the guise of business tra-

vel.

HaroGue/l will be required to set hingell up in business.

The

dearth of quallfied technicians will help facilitate his opening an

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD.

SUBJECT: Mexican Resettlement Arrangements for AESENTINEL

agent AEASPIC

1. At 1400 hours, 19 August, SR/DOB case officer,

Fred Kirkpatrick and Jerry Pochron from Defection Coordinators

: Office of CLA met with Clay Calendar and Jim Myers of TSD/IB

re documentations arrangements and travel routing for possible

resettlement of AESENTINEL agent AEASPIC.

The following

arrangements were proposed by Mr. Calendar and Mr. Myers

for SR/DOB's consideration.

TSD/IB suggested that Subject be

sent by black flight from here to West Germany, and there

surfaced with an altered Greck passport which TSD/IB now has

available. A suitable cover story would of course be incorporated

re the possession of a Greek passport by Subject, while Subject

has no Greek language capability.

Since this passport is a valid

one, (and was, in fact, purchased by TSD/IB) and is therefore

backstopped in name.

Subject could apply at the Mexican Embassy

in West Germany for a Mexican tourist visa by presenting this

passport. Once in Mexico, Subject could request emigration

action upon declaration of intent to become a Mexican citizen and

upon submitting proof of sponsorship by an emplojer in Mexico

City.

2. Upon your concurrence, Mr. Pochron will arrange for

Mr. Kirkpatrick to meet with Mr. Coolidge, the CLA contact used

for introducing agency designees into Mexican private industry.

Mr. Pochron has already talked with Mr. Coolidge on two occasions

and has passed him Subject's file. From their talks, Mr. Pochron

has assured me that this arrangement is entirely feasible, Gillete

Company of Mexico City being cited as one possibility.

3. AEASPIC would then openly proceed to purchase plane

tickets in West Germany for Mexico City and upon arrival there,

would be waiting for him. The time table for this entire operation

• was estimated at about five weeks. Of course we did not discuss

Subject's monetary maintenance for the interim period of travel,

nor until Subject could begin earning his own living.

11-23÷477

## Page 127

4.

Mr. Pochrän expressed his congern and the concern

of Mr. Pennington of Alien Affairs Staff about the knowledgibility

of Subject re pass Agency tie-in and Agency assets. It will of

course be our job to assure Security thát Subject is not knowledgable

and will entail a minimum of risk to transport and to resettle in

Mexico. In view of this concern, all arrangements offered for

DOB's consideration by TSD/IB were tailored to afford step by

step denia! or participation by the U. S. Government. In effect,

all items procured by Subject for resettlement could just as

easily be obtained on the European black market as well as from

this Government. Subject will in effect be briefed and taken by.

German Station asset to obtain his documents ostensibly on the

black market. Monies due Subject would be withheld pending

destination arrival.

The letter head and supporting sponsorship

documents to be used by him for ultimate employment in Mexico

would be prepared in such a manner as to be either legitimate or

forged. In addition it was suggested that Subject be closely

bandled and advised by someone known to him to ensure the

security aspect both to Subject and to this agency.

5. The meeting was closed by TSD/IB's request to be

informed whether these arrangements in theory meet with the

approval of SR/DOB, and Office of Security.

Mr. Kirkpatrick

was assured that Documentation aspects by TSD/IB could be

accomplished within one week upon authorization by SR/DOB.

With your permission Fred Kirkpatrick will proceed to affirm

Mexican employment arrangements for AEASPIC.

REF

l..

This, will confirm recent discussions held between

Mr. Fred Kirkpatrick of your Office and Mr. Lee Jungen of my

Staff relative to the proposed W/I training of ABASPIC. As

was explained by Mr. Jungen, W/T training of an agent on a

full or part-time basis, is contingent upon the approval of a

specific project with supporting couminications annex. Wuile

we heve on occasion participated in "bolding" training of

agents without benefit of a definite requirenent, current

operational commitments now make this impossible.

2.

Should a definite requirement for tbe operational

utilization of AENSPIC develop we will arrange for the W/T

aptitude assessnent and training.

Prior to our initiating

such action,

it is requested that a representative of your

Office discuss operational details with en appropriate

Foreign Division within the Office of Cormnications. This

will enable us to tailor subsequent training in terms of

specific equipment and procedures as required by the project.

In this respect, further information can be obtained by

contacting Mr. Lawience Eisler an extension 8137.

His father's condition is very bad. he are afraid it is a tunor

of the lung. Unfortunately, when one says tumor, one often means cancers. I hope

to God that I am mistaken. Little (eligible) the cousin of Raraz had a fine boy

named Christophe; and that's the latest news!

The children should write you every day, but if you want to chew.

here is Nina's address: Mne. Monestier, 159 Bd. Auguste Elanqui, Paris 13.

Nelly has been working since last Monday in a very stylish and territly

expersive little shop.

The Job of sales clerk seens to agree with her. It is a

store for expensive lingerie at the corner of rue Miromesnil and St.. Honore.

I am writing you all curled up in the corner of the kitchen for we are out

of heat and today, after a few days of radiant sunshine it 18 raining in torrents!

What crimes rust I have committed in a previous life to lead such an ugly:

rite us quickly and tell us what you are doing. ie know nothing, since your

Dear "Eduer do, "

Everyoody was very happy to hear fron you again. You know that Murd and

Mana heve alroady vestion you as well as, undoubtedly, Nina and Nelly. Therefore,

I's the very last to write you but that doesn't nean that I don't think of you.

It's almost a yeer since you left. Plus pesses rather quickly in spito de

everything. Everybody wust have already told you the nost important news. So

such the worse 11 I talk nonsense.

Last August 15 I vent to neet T1t1 in Algeria. We returned together early

In october. A whole your paased ulthout our seeing each other, but with letters

every day, and we found each other as if we had parted the day before, or almost.

It was funny to see Iit1 exercising his functions as a second Ileutenant with a

section under his orders. What a pleasure to lind myself with him there. Now

when Bebert, and company speak of adiltary service I can Join then. The life of

an offlonia vilo la not so bado One 15 spotleda The first month no were at

the sea shore. Since I love the heat this was just the thing for me! Titt left

every sorning at 5 o'clock to join his seddon 25 ku from the place where I vas

staying and returned only at l o'clock in the afternoon, - the weeks passed

quickly axcept for the beach on and still de could not go very far because of the

guerrillas! In short, apart fron going out to lunch, I stayed, so to speak,

shuttered up in my roon waiting for the return of ry lord and master.. I tried

to go sulundng alone, but the clty and the beach were full of soldiers and I gave

up quickly. You cannot imagine I think, what 1t's Ilke to eat alone as a woman

1n a restaurant dining room full of soldiers. I did not dare to raise my eyes

som i plate and, to feel looked et uhile eating, makes you becona clunsy. Hardly

She liked it very much, but astor lettin out, she didn't flad a Job. Throuch one

of iny friends I found her a joo as a beginning sales clerk while vaiting, but

perhaps at the end she'll like being a sales clerk better. She's been vorking

since Monday. Mna is still in the sane Job.. She's salting impatiently for

Bernard to nake enough money so she won't have to worko

Murd is still the same fortunately. As for me, Ilse changed professions.

I am a sodel. don't laugh. Evidently I an beginning la this career, but I hope 1t

will var's out.. One can earn a lot of money and it's a tiring business but pleasant

and sexinise and a lot sore interesting than the job as secretary shere you rest

your behind on a chair all day.

I began at the beginning of November and I worked

until the month of March. I've been unemployed since then, but I's doing a lot

of looking around to find something. The mannequin "cablnes" are formed only

tokard the end of May. I must take some photo tryouts next week. Photography

brings in much nore. If only 1' works out I'd like it very much.

has changed jobs and is now earning 150,200 franes a nonth. Not bad! Furry up
