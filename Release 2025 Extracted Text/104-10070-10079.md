Summary

AMFAUNA-1 is à Cuban national who was

recruited and trained in

the United States and returned legally to Cubalin March 1961 to serve as

resident agent in Havana. Since then he has built a

net of over twenty

sub agents and has-sent back 140 S/W messages, from which upwards of

fifty intelligence disseminations have been made.

He is highly

motivated for his work and under effective control by JMwavE.

The

quality of his production is, for the most part, very good and improving.

although'he is at times distracted by an understandable interest in

para-military operations. Operationally he is very skillful; however,

he has been known to take unnecessary risks.

There is no reason to

think that he is under hostile control nor

that the operation is likely

in the future to be turned against us.

guerrillas. If so, this will be due to the fact that contact with the

guerrillas was his

he has failed in his primary mission.

It is evident from his S/W messages that AMFAUNA-1 derives

great personal satisfaction from his work

against the CASTRO regime.

His connection with KUBARK provides him with the means to do this work.

This is believed to be a strong element of control.

There have been

many opportunities to test this control, by ordering AMFAUNA-1 to do

something or to desist from doing something else, and the control is

believed to be effective.

(who has and continues to use his own S/W communicationa to IMWAVE)

found his way into the AMFAUNA operation. All three are known to

AMFAUNA-5, and it is belleved that shi is probably the cutour to them.

Identity-55 and Identity-56 were mentioned briefly as active

during the period from Dacember 1961 to Apail 1962.

The former had

been a contact of AMRUNG-lil and seeme to have gone into hiding; in any

case, nothing more has been reported on him.

The latter was an agent

of AMTAUNA-1 in (Santiago de Cubaji in January 1962 he was in niding ard

awaiting a chance to go into asylum.

AMFAUNA-11 remained active durin; this period, anc AMFAUNA 9,

10, and

12 were added to the operation.

Fur descriptione of these

agents, see paragraph 15 above.

This phase of the AMFAUNA operation is diagrammed in Chart

following people participating in

the operation by known causes:

By arrest and detention:

(1) Identity-11

(2) Identity-12.

D. Bx asylum or defection:

(1) Identity-14

(2) Jientity-55

(3) Identity-56

(4) Identity-57.

Production:

JMWAVE records do not show the tocal number of AMFAUNA

reports disseminated since January 1961.

The figure is at least fifty,

and is believed to be nearer one hunred, if the present frequency. of

dissemination can be a criterion.

In content they have leaned

heavily toward the activities of insurgent groups, militia movemants,

location of artillery, and

aviation matters.

There has been a more

recent tendency toward political and economic information, which is

being encouraged by JMWAVE. Evaluations of his production are lacking•

Security Analysis:

The possibility that AMFAUNA-1 is a double agent is consider-

ed remote.

His successful LCFLUTTER,

the fact for what is believed to

be the fact that his close friend and fellow agent AMCUSP-1 was

executed, and AMFAUNA-l's owi character and background,

allo|argue

against the proposition that he was originally dispatched by the G-2.

However, it must be admitted that the LCFLUTTER carlbe beaten.; Also

that there is no proof, other than the wadt thanat AMcusp-i)was really

in the JMWAVE area and

behaving like a widow,

executed.

There is documentary evidence, in the formlor a lette

ritten by a fellow prisoner to AMCUSP-l'g widow, that he was hel

for the same reasons, the possibility is heavily discounted

that AMFAUNA-1 has been caught

and doubled by the G=l since his arrival

in Cuba. Additional indications

that all is still well are the fact

that he never omits the safety signal that was given him for use in his

S/w, that his operational activities are consistent with his character

and background, and

that the reporting of his agents is consistent with

their access to information.

53•

Whether AMFAUNA-1 is now in danger of being detected, and

whether

the G-? could double him if they do catch him, are iwo

Taking the second question first,

it ig believed

that the chances of the G-? running a successful cI

operation against KUBARK through AMFAUNA-1 are extremely slim. To be

sure, the G-2 has certain weapons thatythey could use against AMFAUNA-1.

His father is already in prison, serving a fifteen-year sentence, and

his mother and two children(are still in Cuba as potential hostages.)o

It is also conceivable that the G-? could use AMFAUNA-l's own interest

in paramilitary operations as a lever by persuading him that KUBARK,

by neglecting to support the insurgent leader Oswaldo RAMIREZ, was

responsible for the latter's death and has demonstrated its indifference

This would all take time, however,

AMCUTLER-1 would almostlcertainly have learned, either through his

phone conversations with AMFAUNA-2 O: by the interruption of the same,

that something is wrong with AMFAUNA-1.

54. The risks that AMFAUNA-l is now running are believed to be

considerable.

ror one thing, at least ten persons with varying degrees

of knowledge

of his clandestine operations, have been held temporarily

or permanently by the G-?, which is believed to be increasing in

competence as a security force.

For another, AMFAUNA-1 takes unnecessar

chances, as by interrogating

new and untested agent (AMFAUNA-4) in

the personal autonobile of his sister-in-law,

or by personally trying

to penetrate a restricted area. And for a third, he has some contacts

which can be dangerous to him.

AMCOG-2 knows too much about AMFAUNA-1 for the latter's good.

It is believed that AMFAUNA-1 himself is

aware that this is a potential-

ly serious security weakness, because he took the trouble to report it

(see paragraph l5al above)..

The AMCOG operation is itself a fairly

complex one, and will be analyzed in a separate dispatch.
