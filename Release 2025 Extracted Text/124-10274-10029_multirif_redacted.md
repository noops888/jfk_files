Interview of Donald E. Moore by

Mr. Loch Johnson, Senate Select Committee

July 28, 1975

i"?"

;

Mr. Johnson stated at the outset that this was an informal

interview and he did not place me under oath. He asked about my

background which was provided him and included the fact that I

served in the FBI from March 10, 1941, until my retirement at

the end of June 1973.

The interview concerned the so-called Huston Committee

and he asked if I knew Tom Charles Huston before the Committee

was established. I said I recalled meeting Huston once, in Bill

Sullivan's office, but I didn't recall when this was, but it was before

the Committee was formed. In response to questions, Mr. Johnson

was informed as follows:

I was aware of the meeting at the White House attended by

Director Hoover, Mr. Helms, Admiral Gayler and Gen. Bennett.

I was probably aware the meeting was to take place before the

meeting date but I can't recall this. (He said the meeting was

held June 5, 1970.) I was not at a meeting held in Mr. Hoover's

office June 8 but I recall hearing about the meeting, probably

from Bill Sullivan. I don't recall a meeting held in the Domestic

Intelligence Division after this at which Sullivan, Bill Cregar,

George Moore, Fred Cassidy and I were present. I did attend the

initial meeting of the Working Group headed by Sullivan and was

present because Sullivan asked me to be there. I remember Sullivan

and Cregar were at the meeting and I thought one or more other FBI

representatives were present.

He mentioned George Moore and

Fred Cassidy were at the meeting.

I recall Mr. Helms and Mr. Angleton from,CIA were present

but did not recall the names of others including the representatives

from NSA, DIA and the military services. I recall Sullivan chaired

the meeting and that Huston sat at the opposite end of the table.

Either Helms or Sullivan announced that Helms probably couldn't

stay for the entire meeting but I don't recall Helms leaving, although

he did not sit directly at the conference table.

## Page 18

I can't recall the conversation at the meeting but think that

Sullivan outlined the request of the President to study means of

getting better intelligence information on new left activities and

violent protest movements in the US, especially with regard to

possible foreign support. I think Sullivan probably outlined areas

of concern and asked representatives present to document where they

felt intelligence was lacking, how it could be obtained, who should

obtain it and what was needed to obtain it. I said I couldn't at this

date recall specific observations or proposals and rather believed

the purpose of the meeting was to outline the general problem and

ask the representatives to document these and come in with specific

recommendations at a subsequent meeting. I am certain Mr. Huston

spoke about the purpose of the meeting but I can't recall his comments.

This was the only meeting of the Working Group I attended.

I told Mr. Sullivan that if agreeable with him I would not attend

subsequent meetings and I thought the FBI had several representatives

present and that the

thrust was on new left and related activities. As

I recall he said "suit yourself." Johnson pressed me on this and I

told him this was what I expressed to Sullivan but I also was somewhat

uneasy after the first meeting as I did not believe Mr. Hoover was

aware of collection efforts that were likely to be recommended. I

could not state what FBI members attended subsequent meetings but

I believe Charles Brennan and Bill Cregar, and of course, Bill

Sullivan, attended as well as some other representatives.

I can't say who drafted the report but was sure it was under

Sullivan's direction. During the period of the meetings Deke DeLoach

had retired and Sullivan had been appointed Assistant to the Director

and moved from the 9th & D Building to the Justice Building. I

don't recall when Mr. Hoover's objections to certain of the

recommendations were added.. I can't say whether I saw the report

prior to the objections being in it but may have; I do recall seeing

the report after the objections were in it. I don't know whether

Mr. Hoover told Sullivan to put the objections in it but presume

Sullivan knew Mr. Hoover's views and put the objections in on this

basis. I could not answer the question as to whether Mr. Tolson

was the person responsible for having the objections made but felt

he would have objected to the initial recommendations.

- 2 -

NW 88326 Docld:32989627 Page 18

## Page 19

I did see the letter from the White House saying the report

had been approved. I believe it was signed by Huston and stated

the President had approved the recommendations. I was aware

Mr. Hoover had either written or seen Attorney General Mitchell

expressing his reluctance and was aware the White House letter was

withdrawn. I din't know why it was withdrawn other than this

occurred after Mr. Hoover went to the Attorney General.

Mr. Johnson asked certain specific questions during or

after the above discussion. He asked what covert mail coverage

was involved since CIA in 1970 was engaged in covert mail inter-

ception. After checking with Mr. Leon F. Schwartz of the FBI,

Mr. Johnson was advised that while I had been released from my

pledge of confidentiality by the FBI in general with regard to the

Huston Committee this matter was under review by the Department

of Justice and I had not been released from my pledge on this

aspect. A similar answer was given to the question about what

was meant by the removal of restrictions on the use of surreptitious

entry oi embassies io obiain crypiographic maieriais.

Mr. Johnson asked if I thought the Huston Committee had

been instigated by Bill Sullivan to more or less force Mr. Hoover

to take a more aggressive stance in intelligence collection. I

answered that I would not like to speculate on this and I could not

make a definite statement yes or no.

He asked why the Working Group met at CIA as opposed to

the FBI and whether this had special meaning. I answered that I

did not think so, that the US Intelligence Board was headed by the

Director of CIA, was concerned with intelligence collection and

met at CIA and also meeting arrangements could probably be better

arranged at CIA in view of parking, conference rooms, etc.

He said Admiral Gayler had stated that he and his predecessor,

Gen. Carter, had tried to get Mr. Hoover to provide more support to

NSA with regard to Communications Intelligence and asked if I was

aware of any such efforts, and if they were in person or in writing.

I said I was aware that Gen. Carter and Adm. Gayler had asked for

support and I believe they might have seen Mr. Hoover personally

and perhaps had written him.

Mr. Callahan requested that a research be conducted to

determine whether the FBI or the Department of Justice would be

authorized to pay for private counsel for employees called to testify

before the Senate Select Committee and who desired private counsel.

I advised Mr. Callahan that the position of the FBI and the

Department is that we could not provide counsel directly to the individuals

because of the potential conflict of interest between the rights of the

individual and the duties of our officers. However, I told him that to my

knowledge the question concerning whether the Government could pay for

private counsel selected by the employee has not been researched.

Mr. Callahan therefore requested that the research be conducted.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the Administrative Division and Legal Counsel confer

and prepare an appropriate response to Mr. Callahan's request.

We have

also undertaken to present the statutory considerations

governing the provision of such representation in a legal

Title 5, United States Code, Section 3106, states:

.12

This statutory prohibition makes it clear that

only the Attorney General has the authority to make a

contract for special employment of an attorney.

This

Bureau, as an agency of the Department of Justice, ob-

viously does not have authority to do that which is

denied to Executive departments which are otherwise of

coequal stature to the Department of Justice.

Memorandum to Mr. J. B. Adams

Authority of FBI and Department of Justice

to Retain Private Counsel to Represent Employees

An examination of our budgetary language by

representatives of the Administrative Division and this

Division does not disclose any explicit or implicit

authority which would qualify as

"otherwise authorized by

.". under the above statute.

The statutory

authority for provision of private counsel is contained in

Titlezo, United States Code, Section 515, which gives the

Attorney General the authority to appoint and pay special

attorneys. However, this authority is circumscribed by the

statement that these attorneys

• "may, when specifically

directed by the Attorney General, conduct any kind of legal

proceeding, civil or criminal, including grand jury pro

ceedings and proceedings before committing magistrates,

which United States Attorneys are authorized by law to

It is evident then that this authority

pertains only to proceedings held within the judicial

system, not to hearings held before a legislative body.

Such a hearing is not a "legal proceeding" and is not

"which United States Attorneys are authorized by

law to conduct. . . ."

In the event that employees need representation

in a legal proceeding and the Department believes that a

potential conflict of interest would prevent it from

providing counsel, outside counsel could be appointed

paid under the statute up to the monetary limits fixed.

Whether the Department would allow the individual employee

to designate or select the outside counsel would be a

matter of Departmental policy but we see no reason why

such an individual selection would not ordinarily be

approved.

We are aware that the Central Intelligence

Agency (CIA) has recently engaged the law firm of Arnold

and Porter and that Mr. Mitchell Rogovin of that firm

has been designated as the individual attorney to represent

Inquiry with CIA has determined that the

authority relied on for this action is Title 50, United

States Code, Section 403j, which states:

Memorandum to Mr. J. B. Adams

Re: Authority of FBI and Department of Justice

to Retain Private Counsel to Represent Employees

"(a) Notwithstanding any other

other provisions of law, sums

made available to the Agency

by appropriation or otherwise

may be expended for purposes

necessary to carry out its

functions, including --

to limitations on types of

persons to be employed. . . ."

apparente would emphasize, however, that the counsel

hired represents the CIA, not individual employees, and

that private counsel has

the same problems as does their

"in-house" counsel.

Therefore, no firm or individual

hired by that agency can provide counsel to the individual

employee in any situation which presents a potential

conflict between the interests of the individual and the

interests of the agency.

CONCLUSION:

We conclude that there is no authority for either

the FBI or the Department to pay for private counsel

selected by employees called to testify before ti

Senate

Select committee or any other legislative body:

employee called to testify in such a forum desires private

counsel, or where a potential conflict of interest makes

representation by "in-house" counsel or the Department

impossible, the employee must decide if the possible

consequences warrant the personal expense of such counsel

and, if so, responsibility for payment rests with him.

Furthermore, private counsel retained by an

agency having authority to do so would be under the

same disabilities as

"in-house" or Departmental counsel

in situations presenting a potential conflict of interest.

This memorandum records Bureau waiver from sedrecy

agreement for interview of Atlanta Field Office (FO) SA Edward A.

Shea by Senate Select Committee (SSC) Staff Members at Atlanta,

7/22-23/75.

Supervisor S. F. Phillips of the Senstudy 75 Project

was in Atlanta 7/22/75 in connection with the interviews there

of six SAs (five from Atlanta FO; one who traveled to

Atlanta

from Knoxville FO) by SSC Staff Members Michael Epstein and

Mary DeOreo.

Interviews concerned the former FBI investigation

of Martin Luther King, Jr. At approximately 5:00 p.m.,

7/22/75, Epstein telephonically contacted Phillips and

advised

that one of the interviews developed information resulting in

his desire to interview a seventh SA, Edward A. Shea of the

Atlanta FO. In order to avoid another trip to Atlanta,

Epstein asked if Phillips could obtain FBI clearance for the

interview which would concern: (1) any possible COINTELPRO

operations in Atlanta with respect to King or the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC); (2) Shea's assignment

to a "file review or file retrieval" project during past year

concerning COINTELPRO; and (3) concerning COINTELPRO "generally."

(It should be noted that earlier this year, Shea handled a

project relating to classifying documents in Atlanta files

regarding COINTELPRO. Sheaadvised Phillips of this and also

said that he does not recall seeing any documents regarding

COINTELPRO/SCIC - KING.) Epstein desired to interview Shea

the morning of 7/23/75.

On basis of foregoing request, Phillips

telephonically contacted Assistant Director (AD) Mintz

who granted clearance for (1) and (2) above and suggested

withholding clearance on (3) pending further request from

Epstein after interview on items (1) and (2). Mintz asked

that Phillips

touch base with AD Wannall for his concurrence.

In the absence of Wannall who was out of the building,

Jeputy Al l' Leavitt concurred with Mintz. At about 5:30 p.m.;

7/22/75, Epstein was telephonically advised by Phillips as

indicated above--clearance for (1) and (2); not for (3) at

this time. Arrangements were then made for interview of

Shea morning of 7/23/75.

Subsequent interview of Shea (being reported

separately) apparently satisfied Epstein and it does not

appear there will be any further request as to item (3).

None. For information.

This memorandum records that no effort

is being

made to respond to a request of the Senate Select Committee

(SSC) dated 6/27/75, pursuant to instructions of the

Deputy Attorney General, until such time as the Department

can obtain clarification from the SSC regarding the meaning

of paragraph 2 in the SSC's letter of 6/27/75.

Memorandum Wannall to Adams, dated 6/30/75, reviewed

a draft copy of the SSC's letter to the Department.

This

draft copy is dated 6/25/75. It is identical in content with

the final version dated 6/27/75.

Memorandum Cregar to Wannall, dated 7/2/75, reported

the results of a meeting in the office of the Deputy Attorney

General on the morning of 7/2/75. In this memorandum it was

pointed out that the Deputy Attorney General found considerable

difficulty in understanding paragraph 2 of the SSC's draft of

a letter dated 6/25/75. He noted that in view of the

ambiguities found in the letter, as well as the lack of any

specific agreement entered into with the SSC by the Department.

and/or the FBI, the Department should prepare a letter over

the Attorney General's signature asking for clarification.

In the meantime, the Deputy Attorney General advised that we

should take no action responsive to the requests levied on

the FBI in this letter.

To date, we have received no infor-

mation from the Department that a letter asking for clarification

of the SSC has been sent.

Within the Committee mandate, contained in

S. Res. 21, there are four broad subjects relating to the

intelligence community which we are required to investi-

gate and study in order to determine the facts and ulti-

mately to decide whether to make recommendations for

They are:

I.. The structure, performance, and utility of

government operations with

respect to intel-

ligence activities.

2.

Whether certain policies or practices are

or are not illegal, unethical, or otherwise

improper.

3. Whether there has or has not been excessive

auplication or inadequate coordination be-

tween and among intelligence agencies and,

more generally, the efficiency of intelli-

gence activities.

4.

Whether there has or has not been adequate

internal and external control and oversight

over the policies and practices of intelli-

gence

agencies.

In attempting to find the answers to these funda-

mental questions, the Committee is proceeding in two ways.

First, we are examining intelligence functions broadly as

instruments of government policy, giving attention to the

authority for particular functions, the problems which

intelligence activities are designed to solve, the proce

dures by which intelligence activities are and have been

proposed, approved, executed, evaluated, and terminated,

the range and scope of the activities utilized to achieve

intelligence objectives, and the propriety and utility of

Second, we will examine in

depth certain subjects within the broad topics of inves-

tigation. (We would, of course, welcome your suggestion

cases that would give added insight into intelli-

gence matters under your jurisdiction.) These specific

subjects for investigation are not intended to limit the

scope contained in the more general questions.

The annexed notifications spell these matters

out in greater detail. In addition, they ask certain

specific questions, set forth certain previously requested

documents not yet

received, request additional documents,

and, in some cases, ask for the names ana present addresses

of persons who have held certain positions. Where appro-

of Investigation is examining fundamental issues which

bear directly on the adequacy of current legislation

and adninistrative organization and procedure.

The

Comnittee seeks to determine whether FBI intelligence

and

counterintelligence activities achieve legitimate

objectives in conformity with the rule of law.

Among

the basic issues to be addressed are the following:

"A:

What is the legal authority for FBI intelligence .

and counterintelligence activities? Should the

FBI's authority be clarified or revised or

incorporated in a comprehensive statutory

charter?

B. What limitations are placed on FBI Intelligence

and counterintelligence activities by the

Constitution and laws of the United States?

Should these limitations be clarified or

revised?

C.

What have been the purposes and aims of FBI

Intelligence and counterintelligence activities?

Should these objéctives be modified?:

D.

How have the intelligence and counterintelligence

activities of the FBI been organized and coordinated

with other agencies of government?

Should these

procedures and practices be revised?

E. What have been the procedures for and techniques

of intelligence gathering and dissemination and

counterintelligence operations used by the FBI?

Under what conditions and through what procedures

should these methods and techniques be used in

the future?

F.

What have been and should be the mechanisms for

internal and external policy-making, control,

and supervision of FBI intelligence and counter-

Intelligence activitles?

As a means of examining the above issues in the

context of actual iBl Intelligence operations,

the committee intends to study certain specific

topics, some of which are general in nature, and

others of which involve specific cases, programs

or techniques. Part It, below, contains

descriptions

of the general areas into which the Committee: intends

to inquire.

Part III contains descriptions of the

specific cases mentioned above. The descriptions

specifically indicate whether the investigation may

concentrate on specific allegations of possible

abuses or other controversial matters where there

Is reason to believe improprieties may have occurred.

• In addition to the topics described below, additional

areas of inquiry may develop during the course of the

Committee's

work.

II. Areas of General Inquiry

A.

Legal Authority. for FBI Intelligence and Counter-

intelligence Activities

The Committee is examining the legal basis for FBI

intelligence and counterintelligence activities.

There may be serious question as to the adequacy

of the present legislative framework for the FBI's

functions in these fields. Current statutes

authorize the FBI to perform investigative and law

enforcement functions, but they do not specifically

authorize intelligence or counterintelligence

•activities. Therefore; the Committee seeks to

determine

whether the

FBI's authority should be

clarified, revised, or incorporated in a compre-

hensive statutory charter.

Responsible staff: Senior staff

Task Force leader

Mark Gitenstein

B. Organization and Operation of the FBI Intelli-

gence Division

The Committee is investigating the structure and

operating practices of the FBI Intelligence Divi-

sion.

Proposals have been made that the national

security intelligence and counterintelligence

functions of the FBI should be lodged in a

separate

agency or otherwise separated from the FBI's

criminal investigative activities.

Further recom-

mendations have been advanced for improved coordina-

tion between the fBl and other intelligence agencies,

for strengthened

supervision or FBl intelligence and

counterintelligence activitles by the Attorney

General or an independent board, and for clearer

standards and procedures for FBI activities in

this

thererore, the committee desires complete

information on the operating practices and proce-

dures of the FBI Intelligence Division and of the

field

office activities

supervised by the Intelli-

gence

Division.

"..

The Committee's inquiry focuses on the following

specific areas:

1. FBI Internal Security Intelligence Operations

The Committee seeks to determine the nature

and purpose of FBI intelligence operations

directed at foreign intelligence activities

and

subversive or extremist activities within

the United States.

'It has been alleged that

the scope of FBI intelligence investigations

is too broad and has extended to legitimate

political activities. Consequently, the Com-

mittee must examine how the FBI's responsibili-

ties have been defined.

Responsible staff: Senior staff

Task Force leader

Mark Gitenstein

2.

The FBI and the U. S. Intelligence Community

The Committee seeks to determine what have

been the policies and procedures for coordina-

tion between the FBI and other agencies in the

-: S. intelligence community.

There have been

occasions in the

past where friction between

the FBI and other agencies has produced

serious

dissatisfaction within the U.S. intelligence

community.

The purpose of this inquiry is to

evaluate the adequacy of past and present co-

. ordinating mechanisms.

:

FBI Foreign Counterintelligence Operations

The Committée seeks to determine the nature of

FBI counterintelligence operations directed at

foreign intelligence activities within the

United States or at any other hostile foreign-

related activities within the United States.

Since FBI operations to "counter" these activi-

ties go beyond intelligence collection, the

Committee must consider whether such practices

require statutory authorization.

The impact

of counterintelligence operations on United

States foreign relations will also be considered..

Inspection Division Investigations

The Committee is examining the relationship

of the FBI Inspection Division to FBI intelli-

gence and counterintelligence activities.

includes both regular Inspection. Division

reviews of Intelligence Division and field

office functions and specific investigations

of allegations of improper conduct in connec-

tion. with FBI intelligence activities.

FBI Intelligence Activities and State or Local

Law Enforcement Agencies

The Committee seeks to determine the nature of

the relationships between FBI intelligence

activities and state and local law enforcement

agencies.

This subject involves the delicate

balance between the necessary contralization

of certain law enforcement activities and the

Constitutionally-mandated decentralization of

general law enforcement responsibility.

It is

necessary for the Committee to evaluate the

centralizing influence of the FBl, as

well as

the FBI's role as a check on local law enforce-

ment abuses.

matters

set forth in the following specific cases.

1.

Warrantless Electronic Surveillance

The Committee seeks to determine whether the

Attorney General should have the authority

to authorize electronic

tain purposes without a surveillance for cer-.

prior judicial warrant.

This power has been exercised by succeeding

Attorneys General since 1940, upon the explicit

directive of the President.

The Supreme Court

has ruled that this power does not extend to

but the remaining scope

definedby the supreme Court.....

Questions

The Committee requests that the FBI and the

Justice Department address the following specific

• questions:

Clandestine Informant Activities

The Comnittee is examining all aspects of the

FBI's use of informants, sources, and undercover

personnel and the techniques employed by such per-

sons. .

Although informants are the single most

productive source of intelligence information, ine

difficulties of controlling their activities may

increase the possibility of improper conduct. The

use of informants to infiltrate organizations also

' may pose dangers to the right of associational pri-

vacy.

Consequently, proposals have been made for

•the imposition of a judicial warrant requirement

or other

safeguards for the use of informants.

The Committee seeks to evaluate such proposals as

well as the contributions of informants to the

accomplishment of legitimate objectives.

In addition, the Committee is examining informant

activities with respect to several particular situa-

tions and cases.

This investigation may involve

specific allegations of abuse or controversial

matters where there is reason to believe improprie-

ties may have occurred. The Committee's inquiry

covers the general circumstances surrounding the

following incidents or cases:

a. Wounded Knee;

b. Kent State;

c. " New York v. Stroble (Attica);

d. United States v. Buckalew (Gainesville);

e. United States v. Briggs (Camden) ;

f. New York v. Dillon (Hobart College);

go United States v. Marshall (Seattle).

Additional cases may also be examined.

In addition to the above cases, the Committee is

examining the role of FBI informants in providing

roomine sent son

information to the FBI concerning members of the

NW 88326 Docld:32989627 Page 64

a.

Ku Klux Klan;

b. Students for a Democratic Society;

c. Weathermen;

d. Black Panther Party;

e. Communist Party USA;.

'1. W.E.B. DuBois Clubs.

Additional studies of informant activities with

respect to members of other organizations may be

formulated.

Questions

The committee requests that the FBl and the Justice

• Department address the following specific questions:

1. With respect to both categories of cases listed

above,

what allegations, whether unfounded or

not, of improper, illegal, unethical, or provoca-

tive conduct by

FBI informants have been made in

connection with

these situations or groups?

2.

What measures has the FBI taken to investigate

such allegations of misconduct and to prevent

such alleged misconduct from taking place in the

future?

3. What instructions has the FBI given to its in-

tormants with respect to possible improper,

Lilegal, unethical, or provocative conduct?

4. What has been the largest number of informants,

• • sources, and undercover personnel in use at any

one time during each year from 1960 until

the

present in connection with security, intelli-

gence, and counterintelligence matters, cases,

and programs?

5. What has been the annual total amount of funds

(including

reimbursement for expenses) paid to

informants

and sources for each year from 1960

until the present?

"Notional" Organizations

The Committee is examining the FBI's alleged

creation of the support for "notional" organizations

• Department address the following specific questions:

₴

1. What groups, organizations, movements, or other

associations has the fBl caused directly or

indirectly to be formed or created for intel-

ligence or counterintelligence purposes?

Please

provide a complete list from January 1, 1960,

to the present.

2. What groups, organizations, movements, or

other associations has the

FBI supported finan-

cially or materially? Please provide a complete

list from January 1, 1960, to the present.

3. In which cases has the FBI supported or created

such organizations in coordination or coopera-

tion with other agencies?

4. How have the presence of such "notional" organi-

• zations affected the public's perception of the

movements of which they form a part?

5. How have any FBI programs for the creation and

support of such groups been coordinated with

any similar programs undertaken by the CIA or

other U.S. intelligence agencies?

disposition of the report of the Interagency Com-

mittee on Intelligence (Ad

• Hoc) in 1970. This

tain options which were specifically identified as

"illegal". It purported to represent the joint

recommendations of all members of the U. S. intel-

ligence community, but FBI Director J. Edgar

Hoover disagreed in a series of footnotes.

The serious consideration given to such al-

legedly illegal proposals gives this case

•the utmost significance for the Committee's under-.

standing of the risks of uncontrolled intelligence

activity. This case may involve specific allega-

tions of abuse and controversial matters where

there is reason to believe improprieties may have

occurred.

Through arrangements made by Mr. John Hotis, Legal

Counsel Division, Unit Chief Homer A. Newman, IS-1 Section, b

his for

Intelligence Division, was interviewed for the purpose of

developing general information regarding the handling of

informant files within the FBI by Mr. John T. Elliff and

Mr. Mark Gitenstein of the Domestic Intelligence Task Force!!

U. S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities.

The interview was conducted on 8/4/75 in FBI space and

lasted from approximately 2:00 p.m. until 2:30 p.m.

The interview was extremely general in nature and

dealt exclusively with general information regarding the

handling of informant files both in the field and at FBIHQ.

The questions asked dealt with such matters as what type of

files were maintained in the field and at FBIHQ regarding

informants and generally the types of information contained

therein. They were particularly interested as to whether or

not an individual informant file either at FBIHQ or in the

field would contain information which would specifically

identify informants other than the informant on which the

file was maintained. They also inquired whether or not there￾

was a sub A section of each informant file maintained at FBIHQ

as was the case in the field. Questions were also asked as to

whether or not the individual file maintained at FBIHQ on

informants would run into several volumes.

This inquiry was

answered to the effect that the size of the file would depend

on the activity of the informan for 10s dad been e

operated, etc.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re: Senstudy

It was readily apparent that they were asking these

questions with the thought in mind of requesting access to

certain informant files, the identity of which they already

had but did not divulge.

They did state specifically that

the informant files in which they would have an interest

amounted to approximately ten and were all on informants

that had publicly been exposed for one reason or another

and were no longer being operated as current informants.

The indication was that the request would be for access

only to such files for review in FBI space.

PROPOSED PROCEDURES FOR ACCESS

TO FBI MATERIALS BY THE-SENATE

SELECT COMMITTEE

loron Py

On the afternoon of July 24, 1975, K. William O'Connor, Special

Counsel in the Department, met with Deputy Associate Director Adams

and me to present us with a copy of the proposed procedures and to discuss

any amendments the Bureau might request. I asked Mr. O'Connor who had

approved this latest draft of the proposed procedures and he said that they

had been tentatively approved by the Attorney General and the White House.

I specifically asked him who in the White House had approved them and

he said that they had been approved by Mr. Buchen (Counsel to the

President).

Mr. Adams and I discussed the procedures with Mr. O'Connor

and suggested to him as indicated by my inked notation on the bottom of

page 2A that the word 'use" used in subparagraph (d) should be further

defined by a footnote that would specify the limitations on information to be

provided the Committee and its staff concerning the identities of persons

to whom the FBI has undertaken an obligation of confidentiality. Mr. O'Connor

agreed to the proposed change and in our presence telephonically communicated

with John Elliff and obtained his concurrence in the amendment to sub-

paragraph (d).

REC- 102

10111137

Mr. Adams told Mr. O'Connor that the FBI was not agreeing

to the procedures in substance but that we recognized the authority of the

Attorney General in these matters and would abide by his decision that the

proposed procedures would be implemented on agreement by the Committee.

Mr. O'Connor said he understood that and he advised John Elliff that the

Bureau had acquiesced in the proposed procedures with the one amendment

described above. Mr. O'Connor departed indicating that he was going to

proceed to meet with the Committee and obtain final agreement as to the text

of the proposed procedures. The drait of the procedures is attached for the

Directstisanformation.

In connection with our responses to

the Senate Select Committee (SSC), the

White House has instructed that the Intel-

ligence Community prepare a briefing for

Senators Church and Tower of the SSC

regarding warrantless electronic surveil

lances and surreptitious entries. During

meetings of the Intelligence Community, it

was agreed that NSA, FBI and CIA would give

the briefings. No date has been scheduled

for the briefings, although it is antici-

pated representatives of the White House

will monitor a preview of the actual brief-

ing to be given Senators Church and Tower.

During meetings of the Intelligence

Community representatives, to discuss the

contents of such a briefing, it was agreed

among representatives of NSA, CIA and FBI

that erforts would be made to avoid identi-

fying specific foreign targets of surrepti-

tious entries or warrantless electronic

surveillances.

Attached is a memorandum from CIA

advising that CIA has already disseminated

to the SSC information concerning

technical operations against certain

On 8/6/75, Daniel M. (Mac) Armstrong, III, who was

on the personal staff of former Acting Director Gray, called to advise

DALE

that he had been contacted by John Elliff. He had known Elliff casually

during the confirmation hearings regarding Mr. Gray. Elliff told him

that he was personally interested in determining background on two matter

which were: (1) the decision to abolish the Crime Records Division; and

(2) the Legal Attache program.

Armstrong told him that he had no knowledge concerning the

Crime Records Division and had not even learned of its abolishment until

after the fact. Armstrong referred Elliff to Dave Kinley regarding that

topic. Armstrong said that Elliff did not want to talk to him concerning the

Legal Attache program over the phone and said he would contact him in the

near future for an appointment to see him personally.

Armstrong said he was passing this information along to us in

order to keep us advised of his contacts with the Senate Select Committee

concerning his Bureau information which came to him as a result of his

Bureau employment.

1. In our discussions preparatory to the briefing to

be given to Senators Church and Tower, we have agreed to try

to avoid identifying specific foreign targets of the various

types of operations which will be discussed,

although it was

generally recognized that it would be impossible to avoid

discussing the Soviet target specifically. I have recently

learned that the SSC Staff is aware of the fact (from material

turned over to them by CIA) that CIA "participated in a series.

The infor

say:

"Included among them are operations against the

Gzech Embassy, the UAR Embassy, the Chilean Embassy,

the Soviet Consulate in San Francisco, the present

Soviet Embassy, the planned Soviet Embassy, and the

quarters occupied by the Chinese Communists in New

York City."

2. This being so, it can be expected that the Staff will

have brought this information to the senators' attention, and

I will be prepared to respond factually to questions with re-

spect to these operations, which of course were carried out in

pursuit of NSA requirements, and

support.

On July 31, 1975, Mr. Dan Dwyer, Research Assistant,

had some specific questions to ask concerning his review of the

Thereafter,

'Supervisor Paul F" Shea and Classifying Unit Supervisor Odell

(1) Explain the difference in applicant mail categories, i.e.

07, 77, 116g 151 and 161?

The various applicant type categories

were discussed with him.

It was explained that a subnumber is assigned

This draft of "Proposed Procedunes" has not been discussed

It is intended to reflect the substance of the

discussion had on 7/21, in your office; and incorporates (as

undersoored) additional language for the purposes suggested by

that discussion. Also reflected are the slight editorial changes

requested by the SSC in the draft attached to Senator Church's

letter of July 18, 1975.

These pioceumes are designeù to paindi tinãù aucess foi

SSC staff to FBI materials at the FBI, or delivery of such materialss

II approphiate, to the sul. the present scope oi the access is

defined by the requests as received; those extant are the subject

of superseding redraft under paragraph 1.

The prospective scope of

requested information is not restricted, but is subject to negoriation

as indicated in the amendment to paragraph 1.

The proposed modification of paragraph 3 will be the focus of

most controversy. the sol willa probably object to the withholding

of sourres under paragraph 3(d) (proposed) saying that accass to

of to controversy:

information at the FBI offices is all that is required; that no

note on such documents can be removed from the premises of the FBI

under procedure b; and that it they wish to pursue any sources,

the anpeal provision of existing paragraph 6 should cover it.

Since that was the purpose of paragraph 6, and since paragraph 6(a)

was designed to focus on any real problem which might arise, the

scope of the stated problem under paragraph 3(d) may be seen by the

SSC as an attempt to withhold information from the SSC staff, and

delay the inquiry (since the Bureau would have to do considerable pra

delivery work under 3(d) to make properly defined and reviewed

deletions). Accordingly, I would expect SSC to assert (a) DOJ

does not trust SSC probity or security, and (b) DOJ is following

a dilatory and unnecessary tactic.

In anticipation of these problems, I have re-written

paragraph o to permit unilateral abrogation if the procedures

do not work. If actual infornation withheld is. capriciously

defined, on if any lapse of good judgment occurs, I would expect

prompt abrogation by SSC and a very severe criticism of the

. Director, the Attorney General, and the Department.

I think that is a high risk, and assumption of it places

a very heavy burden upon the Bureau, initially, and upon the

Department, ultimately.

My recommendation is that the proposed procedures be

attempted as redrafted, subject to Attorney General and White

House approval; but a vigorous caveat is indicated as to the

need for real restraint in the exercise of initial FBI discretion

under paragraph 3(d) .

delivery/access dates specified. Those materials for which the Com

mittee requests delivery or access shall be delivered to the Cormittee

or made accessible in Room 4171 of the Hoover Building not later than

within 18 96 hours of the date specified. The Cormittee Chairman and

Vice Chairman shall be informed by the Attorney General, within 24 hours

of receipt of the request, of any delay beyond 48 96 hours, the expected

length of the delay, and the specific reasons for the delay. Partial

access or delivery shall be proffered, by the Bureau of/to any materials

requested, while the balance of such materials are being prepared. A

"."

The Attorney General may exempt specific topical areas of

inquiry from the scope of these procedures. Such topical areas

shall be identified by the Attorney General to the Chairman and

Vice Chairman by letter upon consideration of the lists submitted

pursuant to this provision. As to any such exemption, the proce-

dure to be followed shall be proposed, defined, adopted, and

followed after consideration by the SSC of the specific exemption,

and pertinent inquiry and discussion at the staff level.

(2) The following procedures shall apply (a) where delivery of

materials requested might jeopardize FBI sensitive sources or

ongoing operations, or (b) where the Domestic Task Force Leader

requests access to materials, rather than delivery to the SSC.

(3) The Department will furnish access at the Hoover Building in

Room 4171 to those materials requested:

(a) only to the merbers of the Committee, where it is deter

mined by the Attorney General that the materials involve peculiarly

sensitive foreign intelligence sources or sensitive ongoing operations.

unless the identity of the individual as an informant or potential

informant has already been made known to the Committee, or unless the

Attorney General, the Chairman and Vice Chairman, jointly agree on the

limited disclosure of such identities to the Chairman and Vice Chairman.

(d) An exception to (a) and (b) above is made for information which

would identify persons, as sources, who have provided or continue to

provide information to the FBI, and as to whose identity the FBI has

undertaken an obligation of confidentiality. In order to preserve

that obligation of confidentiality, the FBI will withhold access to

this class of information, unless the identity of the individual as

a source has already been made known to the comnittee, or unless the

Attorney General, the Chairman and Vice Chairman, jointly agree on

the limited disclosure of such identities to the Chairman and Vice

Chairman.

(4) Those materials to which the staff has access may be reviewed and

studied in Room 4171 of the Hoover Building and such notes may be

taken as deemed appropriate by the Staff.

(5) The Conmittee staff shall select from these materials to which

INTERVIEW OF FORMER FBI SA BY SSC

Statement of John M. Matter

STATEMENT OF JOHN M. MATTER

The following information is supplied as a result

of an Interview of former SA John M. Matter by SSe Staff

Members Michael Epstein (asked about 95% of the questions)

and Ms, Mary Debree (asked about 5% of the questions).

The information is presented according to subject matter and

not in the chronologleal order in which it was asked because

Epstein kept going back and picking up points that had been

discussed previously.

The interview began at 11:35 a,m. on Friday

July 25, 1975, and lasted until 5:40 p.m. with an hour out

for lunch and three 10 minute breaks.

It was held in a

small, acoustically-treated room (former projection beosh),

up one flight of stairs above room G-308, Dirksen Senate

orrice

Bullding.

Epstein advised that this was an interview

concerning the part. I had in the Bureau investigation of

Martin Luther King, Jr. (hereinafter MK). He did not advise

ne of my rights until I called his attention to the lack of

this about 5t00 p.m., at which time he told me all information

I gave was to be supplied voluntarily, that anything I said

could be the subject of further investigation by his Staff

and that. I could decline to answer any questions which I

did not feel were within the seope of the inquiry.

Epstein asked if I had discussed the MLK matter

with any bureau personnel this morning (July 25, 1975) - he sav

me come to G-308 with the FBI representative who was available

for consultation), and I stated I had discussed procedural

matters with SAs Paul Daly and Seymor Phillips, both of whom

had leaned over backyards to limit my discussion to procedural

matters and nothing else.

Epstela asked for and I supplied bäckgreund

Information as to my present address, when I entered on duty

in the Bureau, the field offices (FOs) where I had worked,

Wilbur G. Stevens, Robert A. Miller, WilliemE: Harward;

I stated that there may have been

others whose nanes I could not recall or who did not fit

into the time period he mentioned. He asked and I advised

that during thet pertod, Richard I. Millea was Seetion Chief

and Arthur J. Baker was his Number One Man:

Epstein and Dires specifically naned the following

persons and asked if they were connected in any way with the

MCk Investigation: Pfafuen, Meyo, Swartz, Bradley, Stevens,

and. Berley.

I advised that Robert F. Pfafman and George W.

Mayo had retired from the Re SEC about 1956 and 1958

respectively, Richard Swartz about 1968, Wayne Bradley about

1974,

Wilbur G.

Stevens was still in the Section, and

succeeded me as Unit Chief, that George Berley was in another

Section of the FBI Laboratory, end that to my personal

knowledge pone of the above had been conneeted with the MiK

Parsons" would heve been involved and I told him I had no

knowledge of such. He asked if I knew Farsons and I said

yes, he hed been a former Assistant Director of the FBI

Laboratory.

Epstein and Dereo questioned me at great length

as to how I got my assizmment in the MIK Investigation, who

authorized the

investigation, how long my work took, how

"the tapes" came into my possession, how I used "the tapes""

I replied that I did not know a Ryan, and

that Phillips, Fred (not Frank). Baumgardner and Lish Whitson

were possibilities but I could

not specifically recall whether

it was any one of them..

Epstein hammered on "who was. the

case superviser," but I could give him nothing more definite

than I had indieated.

It took me somewhere between one and two weeks to

complete my part of the assignment.

There were Inquiries.

from both my Section Chief and the DID as to progress..

There

were long hours put in by both Campball and myself to do an

accurate and reliable job as well as possible. No one else

was assignedrexcept us two because of the highly sensitive

nature of the material and its classification.

I did not

specifically recall if "working coples! were made immedlately

from the FO tapes, but most likely such was done since this

would eliminate the possibility of damaging the FO tapes during

transeription.

At the same time I would have been able to

monitor the FO tapes to gain fanillarity with the subjeet

matter and any sections which I might use for the composite

or were unintelligible.

The first part of the composite

would contain all the excerpts from one FO; the second part of

the composite, the excerpts fron another FO; and so on through

the third and

fourth parts. There possibly were gaps withtn

the excerpts to indicate discontimuity and possibly longer

gaps between the end of all excexpts from one tO and the start

of axcerpts from another FO.

To the best of my recollection, the final composite

did not contain splices between excerpts or between the fo

groups of excerpts. The composite was sterile (not traceable

to any source) as to the & inch recording tape itself, the

7 inch plastic reel containing the tepe, and the 7 inch box

containing. the reel. I do not recall whether it was a commercial

or a plain box. I estimate the total elapsed playing time of the

composite as being somewhere between 45 and 90 minutes, but

I could not recall the speeific time not the tape speed.

Epstein made quite a point of asking if the composite

had actually been put together as explained above, or whether

it was put together in the following manner: one of more

excerpts from one FO tape immediately foltowed by one of more

excerpts from another FO. tape,

and followed again by one of

more excerpts from a third or fourth FO tape.

It appeared that

he was trying to indicate that the composite had deliberately

been put together in such a manner as to create a false impression

as to where the excerpts had come from.

I stated that to the .

best of my memoty the composite had not been the target in that

manner and I categorically denied that any effort had been

made on my part to have the composite convey an idea other.

than that which was actually on the tape,

When the composite

was finished I made two of three coples of it which I identified

as "third generation tapes," while I considered the composite

a "second generation tape." I delivered the composite,

most

likely in the government routing envelope, to William C.

Sullivan in the JB, fifth floor office of then Assistent to

the Director Alan Belmont.

I recalled that this was on a

Saturday and Belmont was in his office with Sullivan.

Delivery was

made to Sullivan as a result of instructions I

had nost. likely obtained from Millen or Conrad who also told

me. to inquire of Sullivan if there was anything else he wanted

me to do, i

so inquired and Sullivan replied that there was

nothing further

and that he would take it fron there." I

could not recall if 1 delivered two or three copies of the

composite to Sulllvan at the same time of wheter they were

sent to him or the DID case supervisor by special messenger

the following Monday, Nor could I specifically recall if i

gave a composite copy to Campbell so that he could make a

transcription of it.

However, that was a possibility because

Campbell had the job of transcribing the WFO tapes and worked

at it up to 6 weeks or two months.

To the best of my recollection, Campbell retained the

WFO. tapes and I have no way of knowing whether I used all

WrO tapes or only those Campbell seleeted as being pertirent.

him the

I supposed.

that bureau oiticlals had their own reason for requenting

a composite, but I was never told.

Epstein

sept pressing me with "didn't you thisk

this was strange?" and finally "what was your optaton?". To

the forner I replied "not necessarily," and to the latter I.

sald a possible reason could have been that Bureau officials

wanted to give the composite to al hobart i Kennady to show

him the type of information being obtained so that he could

decide whether the surveillances he had authorized were to be

continued. I never discussed the "iLK tapes" with anyone

1n the Crimo Recorda Division.

I don't rule out the possibility

that some member of that Division may have anxed wiether 1 had

worked on the tapes, but i certainly had no discussion on the

subject matter:

I did not discuss the tapes with "Deke". Delorch

(spoctiteally named by losteta after he had asked me whether i

had discussed the tapes with anyone in the Crime recorde

Division).

Epstela asked if I had any knowledge of Ernie Belter

having anything to do with the Hik installation - WFO, aad I

told hin, "nose,"

He

appeared to be trying to find some sort of record

within the Bureau so that he could get names, dates and

assigaments.

In anoner to his inquiry, I stated that it was

quite likely I had received an "assignont slip" to account for

my time in the case.

I seriously douoted that such & 81ig

would bear the name of MiK but would mast

Ilkoly have identified

1t as a "special case" or the "MLK case:"

"I had no knowledge

of hon Campbell'a assignant was handled. A register is kept in

the Re SEC for personnel signing In and out, but this would only

show dates and times worked by me and other parsonnet, and

would not indicate what I was doing during & particular day

of 'period of time pertod." Campbell, being assigned to HIO, would

have signed in and out on the WO regioter, even though he vas

RE: INTERVIEN OF FORMER FBI SA BY SSC

Statement of John M. Matter

I have no knowledge that a pbysical and/or photographic

surveillance of Mik was conducted by the Bureau:

I received no "letter of commendation" or

"meritorious raise" as a result of my work on the Mik ease.

Not was the latter specifically or otherwise mentioned in my last

efficiency report. Epstein was very specific in asking about

the letter of commendation, the meritorious raise and the

efficiency report.

He asked if I was aware in any way that the tape had

been furnished newsmen. I told him that I had a recollection

of reading an article in a newspaper or weekly news magazine

few mönths or a year of more after my assignment that MiK

tape information had been obtained by or furnished to newsmen.

I wondered at the time how they had been able to get the

Information. I also pointed out that within the last year of

two there have been a number of references by several featured

news columnists that MLK tape information had been leaked to

selected columnists.

I again denied that at the time

I delivered the cmposite to Sullivan that I had

any specific

knowledge of the use to which it was to be put.

Epstein and Debred did not ask if I had any further

information to furnish to them which had not been brought out

by questioning.

pursue the subject matter in a composite tape any further after

Epstein gave me no explanation as to where he

obtained the names that he specifically mentioned to me. It

appeared to be his desire to conduct a thorough Interview and

to clear up confusion In his mind, possibly caused by conflicting

reports about the tapes. He and Debreo were courteous and

stayed well within the legitimate bounds of the MIK investigation

except as possibly indicated by his questions concerning the

makeup of the Re SEC and its Units.

While he did hot state it

specifically, as such, it appeared to me that he was trying to

determine how tape recordings resulting from microphone

surveillances were handled in a Section which dealt with radio

matters.

He seemed satisfied when I told him that the work of

my Unit came under the "Evidence Examinations" Unit. He also

accepted my explanation of "security work" with the comment that

such sensitive work

certainly was of a security nature. He

made no effort whatsoever to inquire

as to what further work

I may have done in the Section..

He specifically asked whether

I had given any MLK information to Stevens, and I replied that

while I could

not recall specifically, this was possible because

Stevens and I worked closely together and he would have had to

take over the case in my absence.

At a point near the end of the interview, Epstein

"No." Epstein indicated doubt, to which I added that my

relations with all were purely official. Ipstein then asked if

I held any animosity toward' Sullivan.'" I answered, "No."

He then

inquired, "You don't have any?" Again I replied "No."

Director Sec'y

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

Thank you for your letter replying to our letter concerning

access by certain members of the Select Committee to files and

documents concerning them held by the Department, including the

FBI.

The Committee has resolved to adopt a slightly different

procedure than that proposed in your letter.

As you know, the

purpose of this particular request is to enable the members,

through analysis of materials relating to them, to obtain general

insights into how the Department of Justice, including the

Federal Bureau of Investigation, collects, maintains and retrieves

for itself material on Americans generally. Accordingly, we

suggest that at a mutually convenient time, the designated members

come to the Department or the Bureau and physically go through

the retrieval process with the persons who would be responsible

for performing that function in a real life situation.

The

Committee members do not wish to have their individual files

either removed from the filing system or "sanitized" prior to

their reviewing them.

LX-101

This proposed method of omnsite review may help, moreover,

to alleviate the possible problems of disclosure to the particular

REC 2 may 203, -4/375--5/10

members which your letter adverted to.

We are sure that you

could discuss any remaining actual problems with the members

themselves at your premises, including whatever retrieval problems

may exist with respect to the letters from the members themselves

which you referred to.

JUL 25 1y7:

In the first instance, what the members seek is insight

The attached letter was forwarded

to the Bureau by the Department,

and understanding. After the initial review, further steps to

record facts and reach conclusions can be agreed upon as

appropriate.

Senator Baker and Senator Philip Hart wish to be added to

the list of senators who wish to examine their own files.

sincerely yours

FROM

#mDE16

SUBJECT: LEGAL AUTHORITY OF THE FBI

TO USE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANTS

AS AN INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUE

The legal authority of the FBI to use confidential

informants as an investigative technique rests upon three factors:

1) Legislative authority embodied in the approval

of the annual appropriation.

2) Case law that the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth

Amendments do not protect a wrongdoer from

the use of informants.

3) Case law reflecting that courts recognize the

necessity and utility of informants in providing

provavie cause fui making arrests without u

warrant, and for obtaining warrants, provided

that certain conditions are met.

Regarding the first of the above-cited factors,

reference is made to the "Hearings Before a Subcommittee of the

Committee on Appropriations, House of Representatives, Departments

of State, Justice and Commerce, the Judiciary and Related Agencies

Appropriations for 1974."

Part I, page 783 of those hearings, sets forth che -

justification language for the 1974 budget estimate for FBI salaries

and expenses. It is noted that this language is the same as used in '

previous years except for underlined and bracketed changes which

do not affect this subject. There is specific provision under the

Re: LEGAL AUTHORITY OF THE FBI TO USE CONFIDENTIAL

INFORMANTS AS AN INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUE

heading of "Salaries and Expenses" for "expénses necessary for the.

detection and prosecution of crimes against the United States" and

more specifically for the "payment of rewards."

At page 879 of these hearings, there is set forth

as part of the testimony on "Investigative Accomplishments, " a

paragraph detailing the statistics achieved by the use of confidential

informants. Since Congress has approved FBI appropriations without

objection to the use of money for "payment of rewards" or for the

informant achievements listed in the testimony, the approval of the

appropriations serves as one form of legislative approval for the

use of informants.

• The use of informants does not violate the defendant's

rights under the Fourth Amendment. Hoffa V. United States, 385

U.S. 293 (1966).

"Neither this Court, nor any member of it has

ever expressed the view that the Fourth Amend-

ment protects a wrongdoer's misplaced belief

that a person to whom he voluntarily confides

his wrongdoing will not reveal it. Indeed, the

Court unanimously rejected that very contention

---in Lopez v. United States, 373 U.S. 427---"

Id. at 302

The Court also held that the use of an informer did

not violate Hoffa's rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments;

citing United States v. Dennis, 183 F. 2d 201, 224, (1950), which

said,

"Courts have countenanced the use of informers

from time immemorial; in cases of conspiracy,

or in other cases when the crime consists of

preparing for another crime it is usually necessary

to rely upon them or upon accomplices because

the criminals will almost certainly proceed

covertly."

Memorandum. Donahue to Mr. Mintz

Re:

LEGAL AUTHORITY OF THE FBI TO USE CONFIDENTIAL

INFORMANTS AS AN INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUE

Besides the explicit recognition reflected above of

the right of investigative bodies to avail themselves of informants,

there are other Supreme Court cases which implicitly recognize

this right by regulating the conditions under which an informant's

Identity need be revealed at trial. (Roviaro y. United States,

353 U.S. 53 (1957)), or the conditions to be met in using an

informant's information as the basis of probable cause for an

arrest without a warrant. Draper v. United States, 358 U.S. 307

(1959); McCray v. Ilinois. 380 U.S. 300 (1967)). Similarly,

the Supreme Court has recognized that informant information may

form the basis for a warrant application, provided the affidavit

shows the underlying circumstances which would give reason to

believe the informant is credible, and circumstances showing

the basis for conclusions reached by the informant. (Aguilary.

Texas,

. 378 U.S: 108 (1964)).

The above-cited cases show that while courts have

circumscribed in several ways the uses to be made of informant

information, there has always been a recognition of the fact that

the informant is a basic and necessary weapon in law enforcement's

defense of society against crime.

MEMORANDUM TO ALL SPECIAL AGENTS IN CHARGE:

(A) INFORMANT MATTERS - DEFENSE PLANS AND STRATEGY -

Recently there have been several instances where attorneys in connection

with law suits have publicly and erroneously alleged that the FBI utilized

intormants to uncover defense plans and strategy. Also, recently a former

informant falsely alleged that informant's services were utilized by the

Bureau to infiltrate a defense camp.

These accusations reemphasize the

need for the careful and protessional handling of informants at all times.

As you are aware under current policy, informants are advised

to avoid becoming involved in defense plans or strategy in subversive-type

cases or with anyone under criminal indictment. It is the responsibility

of all Special Agents handling intormants to insure that their informants

are continually alert so that they will avoid becoming invoived in defense

matters and in the event an informant is requested to assist or partake in

such matters, that the contacting Agent is immediately advised so that the

matter will be recorded. If the inormait cannot avoid being involved,

informant is not to report any information pertaining to defense plans or

strategy and such incident must be promptly reported to the Bureau under

the substantive case caption.

In view of the above, the statement of cooperation normally

signed by security and extremist informants is being amended to incorporate

current policy regarding defense plans and strategy. Where it is not required

as in criminal informant cases or it has not been practical to obtain a state- •

ment of cooperation, each handling Agent must orally advise the informant

of the above, reduce it to writing, and record it in the informant's file. Insure

that all pending informant files reflect the above as a matter of record.

and probably the communists wouid end up in charge; we can go in there and

try to get them to agree and go on the constitution and let there vote on it In

60 or S0 days, expervice the election and have a cabinet we mutually agreed

upon which I can check upon; then cuce we got it, holy the President with

some intelligence peuple to point up wo are communists. We said they ought

to be Latins or ones who spenk the longuage and he wanted me to take charge

of that and to start right now saying til were President, what I would do down

there to get rid of the communists. The President stated it can't be done in

one day, but that is what he wants for the Dominican Repuclic.

I told the President I had quite a number of Agents, & hundred or so,

who are expert in the Sponish language so we have the lacilities that we can do

that.

The Fresident asised that I look at the best ones and see who it is; that

it has to be a fellow who can get along with the new President whom he can

trust, to figure out what I need, how I would set it up, and what I would do

to get set up to go to work on the communists.

I stated I thought it can be

covered as we do in the South American countrics as we have in some foreign

countries a Legal Attache aitached to the Embassy and if we bave a man

Isediun through which to advise the President and select the individuals

who ought to be listed, deported, or put under control. The President asked

I get the results of the check to him as soon as possible on

While talking to the Attorney General on another matter, I advised

me to pick a squad of "DI Agents to go to the Dominican Lopublic when the

nay government is formed to advise the President on tne renoval di communists

and getting them out of government oices. I priced the Attorney beneral on

DATS 1-15-00 BY SP 2 ALM 11162

The Director advised that the President will want the FBI to

set up a group in the Dominican Republic to advise the President of

the Dominican Republic concerning Communists, how to deal with them,

and how to get rid of them.

It is contemplated that we will set up

a Legal Attache's Office, with a group of 20 to 25 men, for the purpose

taking charge of cleaning out communists in the Dominican Govern-

ment and advising the government of those who may try to infiltrate.

into the government.

This activity would take place first in the

city of Santo Domingo, and then extend throughout the country until

all communists have been spotted and the Dominican Government has been

advised.

All of the agents to be sent down should be fluent in Spanish

and we should select any who have Dominican or Spanish blood; which

will assist them in working inconspicuously with the populace.

Relative to the Legal Attache,

he should be a top man, fully

experienced, as he will be dealing. with the President of the Dominican

Republic and with our Ambassador there.

ACTION:

In anticipation of the above, the Director desires that we

draw up suggestions for a Legal Attache and for a group of twenty to

twenty-five men who can proceed, when so ordered, to the Dominican...

Republic for this purpose.

A copy of this memorandum is being designated for the

Administrative Division so that the Domestic Intelligence Division

and the Administrative Division can work together on this.

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

In Reply, Please Rejer io

June 2, 1965

• WASHINGION, D.C. 20535

File No.

(A) DOMINICAN SITUATION (NATIONALITY GROUP COVERAGE - LATIN

AMERICA-- For your information, Bureau has established a Legal Attache

in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, who has already begun to make a

valuable contribution to the over-all efforts of the United States in making

certain that the Dominican Republic does not become another Cuba. If the

United States succeeds in its efforts to keep communists out of the new

Dominican coalition government which is in the process of being formed,

current United States policy in the Dominican Republic could very well

become the established course of action for all other countries in Latin

• America threatened with communism.

The responsibilities which have been placed upon the Bureau

in developing intelligence data in the Dominican Republic, as well as in

other Latin-American countries, are not only tremendous but may be the

heaviest and most far-reaching burden the FBI has ever been asked to

assume in the intelligence field. To guarantee our complete success,

teamwork is a must.

Accordingly, first we must do everything possible to assist

Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, in his immediate task of developing

quality sources of sufficient quantity to effect maximum coverage in the

Dominican Republic.

In this regard, each office and Legal Attache must furnish

to the Bureau within five days of the receipt of this letter under the caption

of "DOMSIT" (code word for "Dominican Situation") the following:

(1) Identities of any established sources (former or current)

who are now in the Dominican Republic.

(2) Persons in Dominican Republic known to personnel of

your oftice who appear to have good source potential.

(3) Identities of any current security sources (regardless of

nationality) who may be available for assignment (temporary or permanent)

in the Dominican Republic if such is considered feasible by Legal Attache,

Santo Domingo.

This document is prepared in response to your request and is not for dissemi-

nation outside your Committee.

Its use is limited to official proceedings by

your Committee and the content may not be disclosed to unauthorized person

nel without the express approval of the FBI :

## Page 201

Any leads for purpose of checking background of potential sources

for Santo Domingo must receive priority attention and results submitted by

teletype.

In addition to the Dominican requirements placed upon the Bureau,

your attention is directed to over-all need for additional informants and

sources in the Latin-American field. The reputation the Bureau has gained

during recent Dominican crisis is due in large part to the results achieved

in developing Dominican sources through a concentrated informant develop-

ment program over the past several years.

In view of critical state of unrest in Latin America today, each

office should survey its informant coverage in this field. If substantial

numbers of nationals of any Latin-American country reside within the

territory covered by your office, Bureau expects that you will have coverage

sufficient to alert you to exile organizational activities of political nature,

plots to overthrow existing governments, and general intelligence data

concerning the countries of interest. Informant development in this fiela

is considered most important and any weaknesses which now exist must be

overcome promptly by instituting an aggressive informant development

program.

President Lyndon B. Jonnson called. He stated he was worried avout

the situation in the Dominican sepuolic and asked me how I icit about it. I

told him it was my feeling that it is in an ariul mess; that there have been several

people who have been selected to be in the Cabinet who are ian irom being free

of corcmunist association or domination and wiy they were selected, i did not lnow,

but I thought the situation down there is very critical. I stated i met with

McGeorgo Bundy and Aumiral Willlam Laborn of the Central Intelligence Agency

(CLA) the other day as to whether the F5i could withdraw from the Dominican

Fepublie and ay view was that we could as CLA is thorcugidy quaittic and haa

& good man down there to carry on the responsibilities and there is no necd for

the her to remain. I scated it was the view of admiral laborn and myseii that

it was going to be a mess and that we woule have trouble for some time to come

because various peopie are going bacis to the cominican it. publle now, such as

and his followers, and the former fresicients who were deposed and

I thought in the political campaign which is going to be heid down there this year,

there are going to be violent outbursts waich are characteristic i the Letins.

I stated the populace is very anti-American nd now thai

has

been sent out and icada

the rebel element, which is

always strongly anti-American, will be in the ascenuancy. I stated

is not what one would call a etrung man; set I think he means well and

will try to do rigit but he is not the kind of a mian who will stand up to his

opposition.

The President stated he was not too happy with CIA and the reports

he gets from them and he would hate to see the bureau people pull out until a

government is formed. I stated we wouidn't until he, the resident, says so;

that as I said the otner day, we would not leave until the decision has been iliade

TO

DATE:

August 22, 1966

FROM : Ar. W. R. Wannall

SUBJECT: OPERATIONS

LEGAL, ATTACHE,

USANTO DOMINGO OFFICE

This is to recommend that the Central Intelligence

Agency (CIA) be advised that we have set up a regular Legal

Attache Office in Santo Domingo in view of the President's

desire that the FBI remain in the Dominican Republic and that

Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, be authorized to turn

informants over to the Agency.

In accordance with the desire of the President arc

recommendation of the Honorable Marvin Watson, Special

Assistant to the President, that the FBI remain in the Domi-ican

Republic, the Director, on 8/2/66, advised the White House

that our

staff in Santo Domingo would be reduced to three men

and that henceforth this office will be manned in a nanner

similar to that of our other Legal Attache Offices. It will not

¿ be an operational öffice but father will serve as a strategic

listening post for intelligence data and as liaison with

agencies of the Dominican Republic, as well as other agencies

of come governe ta that country.

=÷.

In light of this redirection of effort, we instructed

Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, to review his informant covéraze-

to determine if any of our informants should be made availasie

to the Agency for operation. Legal Attache has recommended

that as informants, treat

an, be turned over to CIA.

Lonel has been used principally to develop subversive data

on individuals in Santiago, Dominican Republic.

is

a penetrative-type informant who has gained membership in

Dominican subversive groups. Both of these sources are

operational and are not the type we would contact in a nornal

laison capacity. Continuation of their services under our

current criteria would be a questionable procedure.

This document is prepared in response to your request and is not for dissemi-

nation outside your commitiee..

Its use is. limited to official proceedings by

your committee and the content may not be disclosed to unauthorized person

Re:

OPERATIONS

LEGAL ATTACHE, SANTO DOMINGO OFFICE

In the case of

this informant was originally

developed by the New York Office. Legal Attache suggested

the New York Office might have use of informant's services.

This information furnished to New York Office which replied

that in the absense of organized activity informant would be

of no use unless he came to New York with instructions from

Dominican communist groups to reorganize activity.. This,

of course, is not a desirable situation.

OBSERVATIONS:

We believe Legal Attache, Santo Domingo's recommendation

to turn

over to CIA. is sound,

even though

both of these sources are in a position to furnish valuable

intelligence information to us. By making these informants

available to the Agency we will avoid any possible duplication

or conflict. This matter should be discussed with appropriate

officials by our Liaison Agent in order to insure the Agency

is fully aware of our current status in the Dominican Republic.

ACTION:

.=..

If you approve:

(1) Liaison Agent will advise appropriate CIA

officials as follows:

In accordance with the desire of the President that

the FBI remain in the Dominican Republic, we are setting up a

regular Legal Attache Office in Santo Domingo consisting of

three men. This will not be an operational office but rather

will serve as a strategic listening post for intelligence data

and as liaison with agencies. of the Dominican Republic, as

well as other agencies of foreign governments in that country.

" In connection with this reorganization, we have instructed our

• representative in Santo Domingo to make is informants avail-

able to the Agency in the event it may wish to operate them.

DOMINICAN REPUBLIC.

"Dayhe Director advised that the president will want the FBi to

a group in the Dominican Republic to advise the President of

Dominican Republic concerning Communists, how to deal with them,

and how to get rid of them.

It is contemplated that we will set up

a Legal Attache's Office, with a group of 20 to 25 men,

fox the purpose

of taking charge of cleaning out communists in the Dominican Govern-

ment and advising the government of those who may try to infiltrate

into the government. This activity would take place first in the

city of santo Domingo, and then extend throughout the country until

all communists have been spotted and the Dominican Government has been

advised.

All of the agents to be sent down snouid ve fucut in Spanish

and ve should select any who have Dominican or Spanish blood, which

will assist them in working inconspicuously with the populace.

Relative

to the Legal Attache, he should be a top man, fully

experienced, as he will be dealing with the President of the

Dominican

Republic and with our Ambassador there.

ACTION:

"In" anticipation or the above, the director desires that we

draw up suggestions for a Legal Attache and for a group of twenty to

twenty-five men who can proceed, when so ordered, to the Dominican

Republic for this purpose.

A copy of this memorandum is being designated for the

Administrative Division so that the Domestic Intelligence Division

File No.

(A) DOMINICAN SITUATION (NATIONALITY GROUP COVERAGE - LATIN

AMERICA) -- For your information, Bureau has established a Legal Attache

int Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, who has already begun to make a

valuable contribution to the over-all efforts of the United States in making

certain that the Dominican Republic does not become another Cuba. If the

United States succeeds in its efforts to keep communists out of the new

Dominican coalition government which is in the process of being formed,

current United States policy in the Dominican Republic could very well

become the established course of action for all other countries in Latin

America threatened with communism.

The responsibilities which have been placed upon the Bureau

in developing intelligence data in the Dominican Republic, as well as in

other Latin-American countries, are not only tremendous but may be the

heaviest and most far-reaching burden the FBI has ever been asked to

assume in uno intelligence ield. To guaratag pur complete success:

teamwork is a must.

Accordingly, first we must do everything possible to assist

Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, in his immediate task of developing

quality sources of sufficient quantity to effect maximum coverage in the

Dominican Republic.

In this regard, each office and Legal Attache must furnish

=" to the Bureau within five days of the réceipt of this letter under the caption

of "DOMSIT" (code word for "Dominican Situation") the following:

(1) Identities of any established sources (former or current)

who are now in the Dominican Republic.

(2) Persons in Dominican Republic known to personnel of

your office who appear to have good source potential.

(3) Identities of any current security sources (regardless of

nationality) who may be available for assignment (temporary or permanent)

in the Dominican Republic if such is considered feasible by Legal Attache,

Any leads for purpose of checking background of potential sources

for Santo Domingo must receive priority attention and results submitted by

teletype.

In addition to the Dominican requirements placed upon the Bureau,

your attention is directed to over-all need for additional informants and

sources in the Latin-American field. The reputation the Bureau has gained

during recent Dominican crisis is due in large part to the results achieved

in developing Dominican sources through a concentrated informant develop-

ment program over the past several years.

In view of critical state of unrest in Latin America today, each

office should survey its informant coverage in this field. If substantial

numbers of nationals of any Latin-American country reside within the

territory covered by your office, Bureau expects that you will have coverage

sutticient to alert you to exile organizational activities vi politial lature,

..plots to overthrow existing governments, and general intelligence data

Concerning the countries of interest. Informant development in this field

is considered most important and any weaknesses which now exist must be

• overcome promptly by instituting an aggressive informant development

program.

This is to recommend that the Central Intelligence

Agency (CIA) be advised that we have set up a regular Legal

Attache Office in Santo Domingo in view of the President's

desire that the FBI remain in the Dominican Republic ano

thay

Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, be authorized to turn two

informants over to the Agency.

In accordance with the desire of the President and

recommendation of the honorable Marvin watson, special

ASSistant to the Fresident, thai tue iod renain in ine Dominican

Republic, the Director, on 8/2/66, advised the White House

that our

and that henceforth this office will be manned in a manner

statt in Santo Doningo would be reduced to three men l

similar to that of our other Legal Attache Offices. It will not

be an operational office but rather will serve as a strategic

listening post for intelligence data and as liaison with

agencies of the Dominican Republic, as well as other agencies

of foreign governments in that country.

.?In light. of this redirection of effort, we fnstructed

Legal Attache, vanto Domingo, to review his informant coverage

to determine if any of our informants should be made available

to the gency for operation

ega tache has recommender

chatstwo informants, @0M-10/and BOl-12 be turned over to CIA.

DOM-10 has been used principally to develop subversive

data

on Individuals in santiago, Dominican Republic. DOM-12

is

a penetrative-type informant who has gained nembership in

Dominican subversive groups: "Both" öf these sources are

operational and are not the type we would contact in a normal

laison capacity.

Continuation of their services under our

current criteria would be a questionable procedure.

Memorandum V. R. Wannall to W. C. Sullivan

Re:

OPERATIONS

LIGAL ATTACHE, SANTO DOMINGO OFFICE

In the case of DOh-i2, this informant was originally

developed by the New York Office. Legal Attache suggested

the New York Office might have use of informant's services.

This information furnished to New York Office which replied

that in the absense of organized activity informant would be

of no use unless he came to New York with instructions from

Dominican communist groups to reorganize activity. This,

of course, is not a desirable situation.

OBSERVATIONS:

We believe Legal Attache, Santo Domingo's recommendation

to turn-DOM-10 and DOM=12 over to CIA is sound, even though

both of these sources are in a position to furnish valuable

intelligence information to us. By making these informants

available to the Agency we will avoid any possible duplication

or conflict. This matter should be discussed with appropriate

officials by our Liaison Agent in order to insure the Agency

is fully aware of our current status in the Dominican Republic.

Memorandum for Mr. McDermott

Re: REQUEST BY U. S. SENATOR WALTER F.

MONDALE, SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

MEMBER, TO REVIEW HIS FBI FILES

The Senator raised a question concerning a folder on the

Consumers Advisory Council, of which he was a member (62-108230-1)

and inquired how we came into possession of this particular report. I

determined that this report had been sent to Mr. Hoover in September,

1962, by Richard Berlin, President of the Hearst Corporation, as he

felt Mr. Hoover would be interested in reading the report. I advised

Mr. Aaron that the report had been sent to Mr. Hoover by a friend of

his in the newspaper field.

The Attorney General

In response to the soconu request in your letter,

my answer is rostricted to communications botween the white

attenpt to respond for other agencies under your jurisdiction.

There are two major areas in which the ittorney

General doos not soe conmunications between the White House

and the FBI. They are tho results of name checks and the

rosults of lull fiold investigationsue do for the White Houso.

The thite House requests approximately 13,000 name checks per

year concerning persons who vicit the Whito House complex who

could pose a physical threat or possiblo embarrassment to tho

Presidont directly or indirectly. Aoprosimately 1,000 full

fiold background investigations on Frosidontial appointoes,

rembers of the White House staff, and othor porsons having

regular access to the White Houso are requesto& annually.

1 direct your attention to section 0.15 (o) (7);

Code of Federal Regulations, which states that the

Do citorny Gonoral shall coordinate Daparimontal liaison

with the white House

staff and the Executive Office of the

President."

when this ordor was promulgated there vere

to its implomentation and its impact on oxioting direct

liaison between the FBI and the White House.

to handle day to day oporational liaison with the thite House.

His activitios vero outlined and it was roquested that he

continuo to handle operational problous on a dally basis

with spocific individuals bocause of the sonsitivity of tho

matters involved, both of a personal security and intelligence

nature.

With the exceptions as notea above, the fBI has

adhered to a policy that when information is given to the

White House the Attorney General is given the same information

contemporaneously. Most of this information rolates to current

matters pertaining to the national socurity. This dissomination

to the White House is comotimes based on roquests Iron tho

White House but more frequontly on the initiative of the FBI.

With regard to any correspondence directed to this

Bureau from the white House, short of a Ille by file revier.

there is no means of determining whother or not such communica-

tions bypassed the Attorney Gonoral.

The established rule of furnishing the Attoracy

General copics of corrospondence to the Whito Housc should be

followed strictly so that the Attorney General 1s kept iully

informed on matters of interest to him.

Senate Select Committee, advised that he desires to interview the

following Agents: Donald P. Burgess, Robert W. Thomson, O. Richard

Hamilton, Charles T. Haynes and Alden F. Miller, all of the Atlanta Office.

Additionally, he requested that SA W. John Benton of the Knoxville Office

be made available in Atlanta. All interviews will be conducted on Tuesday,

7-22-75. The scope of the interviews will be the Bureau investigation of

Martin Luther King. K. William O'Connor, Special Counsel for Intelligence

Coordination in the Department, advised Assistant Director John A. Mintz

on 7-18-75 that staff interviews would no longer be considered a demand

and thus no longer necessitate a waiver of the Code of Federal Regulations

provisions concerning interviews.

After securing the approval of Robert H. Cahill of the

Administrative Division for the travel of Benton to Atlanta, SAC Harold C.

Swanson, Knoxville Office, was telephonically advised on 7-18-75 to

arrange that Benton be available in Atlanta, 7-22-75.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) That existing employment agreements of the aforementioned

special Agents bo waved tor purposes -1 in 6 395- 508

Attached is a copy of a Departmental memorandum which

interprets "demand" under 28 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 16.21

et seq. for the purpose of dealing with the. Senate Select Committee. The

provisions of 16 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 16. 21 et seg. requires

Departmental approval in those instances where a current or former

employee in response to a demand of a court or authority is required

to furnish material contained in Departmental files or disclose information

contained therein.

The Department decision as set forth in the attachment.

characterizes all requests by Senate Select Committee staff members

as a demand which requires a waiver from the Department prior to the

l employee's submission to the Committee request.

REG 1 02-111345506

According to the Departmental position concerning demand,

the Director or "the FBI General Counsel" in coordination with the Special

Counsel for Intelligence Coordination of the Department may waive the

provision of 28 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 16.21 et seq. This

is in accordance with the provision of Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations.

Section 16.23.

114 AUG I 1975

Upon receipt of the attached documents, SA Paul V. Daly

_and Inspector John B. Hotis of this Division sought clarification concerning

the Departmental interpretation of "demand" as set forth in attachment,

including whether this interpretation applied to the General Accounting

Office (GAO) inquiry into the Bureau. K. William O'Connor, Special

Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, stated he believed this might also

apply to GAO, however, he had not really thought out this point. He was

also asked what was meant by the phrase, "in coordination with this office."

Mr. O'Connor indicated that he wanted to be notified of requests for interviews

and that was what he meant by the phrase, "in coordination with this office."

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams Memo

RE: SENSTUDY 75

He was advised by SA Daly that we had previously received requests

for the interview of a number of employees in Atlanta, Georgia, by the

Committee and that upon receipt of the attached communication, after

consultation with Deputy Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination

Michael Shaheen, SA Daly had telephonically informed John Elliff, head

of the domestic intelligence task force for the Committee, of the

Department's interpretation as set forth in the attached document and

) the fact that Mr. Biliff should contact Mr. O'Connor concerning these

proposed interviews. Mr. O'Connor said that he had been contacted by

Mr. Elliff and had, in fact, told Mr. Elliff there would be no interviews.

In this regard, O'Connor stated the Department had prepared a proposed

draft letter to the Committee expressing concern for the Fifth Amendment

rights for Bureau employees and raising other legal issues. Mr. O'Connor

indicated that the finalized form of this letter should be sent to the

Committee in the near future.

The results of the conversation with John Elliff by O'Connor

have caused the Office of Legal Analysis to recéive complaints concerning

this decision from various Committee staff members, including Mark

Gitenstein and Michael Epstein. We can anticipate, unless this particular

problem is resolved, receiving protests from their superiors on the

Committee.

Interpretation of "Demand",

28 C.F.R., 3 16.21, et. sed. - Action Memorandum

The meaning of "demand" is not indicated, beyond subpoena, in

the C.F.R. sections indicated. This omission creates a need for an

interpretation, for purposes of uniform Department of Justice reaction.

Outlines for inquiry proceedings were agreed upon between the

White House and the Senate Select Committee on June 13, 1915, and a

copy of those procedures was iurnished to the Department on June 16,

1975. Under those guidelines, there is a general undertaking by the

Conmittee to identify witnesses to the Agency a reasonable time berore

the interviews occur. This general rule includes current and former

employees; certain exceptions (not clearly defined) are indicated in

the guidelines.

The Committee is required to provide the witness with

a copy of the procedures, and "relevant waivers of secrecy oaths or

agreements for the purpose of this inquiry". The Committee is required

to give prior notice of an interview, generally, specifying: (a) sub-

ject area; (b) periods of employment; (c) the date set for the interview.

Since these structured procedures, taken with the rules of the

Subcommittee, may create a requirement of testimony upon witnesses, it

seems to me clear that the paragraphs of 28 C.F.R., $ 16.21, et. seg.,

which refer to "demand" should be interpreted to include any request

by any Committee staff member to interview any employee, former employee

or other person connected with the Department of Justice.

This interpretation requires certain action: (1) that the wit-

ness be authorized to speak under § 16.23 by an appropriate Department

Official; and, (2) that an appropriate Department Official be designated.

I would think that the appropriate Department Official for the FBI should

be the Director of the F'Bl or the FBl General Counsel, in coordination

with this office.

for disclosure under s 16.23, as a system for ensuring that they are

receiving treatment consistent with the outlines of inquiry procedure

and the agreements between the Committee and the Department.

If you approve, I will advise the involved components of the

indicated for each witness.

The Intelligence, General

with regard to this matter.

We have since had discussions with the Attorney

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE

ACTIVITTES (SSC) ; INTERVIEW OF ASSISTANT

DIRECTOR IN CHARGE ROBERT E. GEBHARDT BY

SSC STAFF MEMBER

On August 7, 1975, Assistant Director Robert E.

Gebhardt, Los Angeles Division, was interviewed in the Los

Angeles

FBI Office by Mr. Lester Seidel, Staff Member of

the Senate Select Committee, United States Senate.

Gebhardt's rights were not explained to him by

Seidel although Seidel did explain the purpose of the

The interview lasted from 9:05 AM until 10:30 AM,

and it was not necessary for Gebhardt to consult with any

Bureau representative.

Gebhardt had previously been advised by a Bureau

representative of his right to counsel, the privileged areas

of information, consultation privileges, and the parameters

Seidel inquired at the outset as to whether Gebhardt

was aware of the Cointel Program relative to the Black Panther

Party investigation on a day-to day basis being specifically

advised details of the investigation as it relates to the

,Cointel Program.

It was explained to Seidel that as Special

Agent in Charge of the San Francisco FBI Office wherein

over 500 employees were located at the time, Gebhardt had

many responsibilities in the operation of that division and

therefore,

day-today direction of the various matters under investigation,

including the investigation of the Black Panther Party.

It was further explained that if a problem was

encountered or a particularly unusual situation developed,

Gebhardt was, of course, consulted and was available for

such consultation to resolve any particular problem areas.

Gebhardt was next asked if he recalled being SAC

when the electronic coverage of the Black Panther Party and

the various officials at BBP was instituted and eventually

terminated. Seidel was advised that the electronic coverage

was already in effect upon Gebhardt"s arrival kelve Decision"

does recall receiving a phone call after the

was handed down instructing that all electronic coverage of

the BPP

and the various members of the BPP be discontinued.

The call was received from Bureau Headquarters and the

discontinuance was effected immediately.

Seidel inquired as to whether Gebhardt felt the

intelligence type investigations should be completely

"removed

from the criminal investigations which investigations would be

looking toward eventual prosecution.

Seidel was informed by Gebhardt that even in criminal

investigations looking toward prosecutions, much intelligence

information is obtained from time to time which really has no

value from a prosecutive standpoint, but does have possible

value with respect to the direction of the investigation.

In

information may be obtained and in other types, very little.

Insofar as the FBI is concerned, however, every effort is

made to make certain there is some Federal law which would be

a basis for an investigation which procedures would include

matters commonly referred to as security investigations.

In some instances, in such security investigations

a great deal of intelligence information would be obtained

therefore, it was Gebhardt's opinion that so-called intelli-

gence type investigations should not be removed from or

toward prosecution see intelligence normation dee

outgrowth of the basic investigation.

Gebhardt was asked if he felt the Cointelpro was a

separate entity distinguished trom the basic investigation

and it was explained that the Cointelpro was a phase of the

overall investigation in any particular organization or

individual.

Gebhardt was asked if he felt Congress should enact

legislation which would set forth specific investigative

techniques that could or could not be utilized by the FBl or

other Federal investigative agencies. He was advised in

Gebhardt's opinion, such legislation

should not be enacted,

and in reply to the question as to why such legislation shoul

not be enacted, it was pointed out that as an investigative

agency, there must of necessity be allowed a certain flexi-

bility

because no two investigations are exactly alike and the

circumstances of such investigations could possibly not be

related to such Federal law.

In answer to the question as to how Congress should

assure the American public that questionable activity such

as the Cointelpro, was not being engaged in by an investigative

agency such as the FBI, Seidel was informed that the Congress

and the American people must rely upon the integrity and

honesty of the Director of

the FBI and the Attorney General.

It was pointed out that both the Director of the

FBI and the Attorney General are nominated by the President,

hearings are held before the various Congressional Committees

and finally approved by the Senate.

It was further pointed

out that Director Kelley has recently stated in connection with

the publicity relative to Cointelpro, that he has no intention

of permitting this program to be reinstituted in the FBI and

II circumstances ever arose which circumstances he could noi

ontemplated-at this time, wherein it was thought sucl

activities should be embarked upon, he would obtain the personal

approval of the Attorney General prior to such instituting.

Seidel was informed that Gebhardt was in total agreement with

this statement of Mr. Kelley.

Gebhardt was asked as to what his feelings were

relative to what the relationship should be between the FBI

and Congress.

He was informed that a Senate Oversight

Committee was recently established and it was felt that this

was a good start and that this Committee should formalize and

- 3 -

.,4.

standardize their oversight responsibilities and make regular

inquiries of the Director and other officials of the FBI as

to our activities. He was informed that there should be

either a joint oversight committee between the House and

Senate or if the Congress decided on two

in both the House and Senate, these committees should be the

entities through which all information relative to the

activities of the FBI should flow.

It was emphasized however, that there should be

regular consultation between these representatives and the

FBI.

Inquiry was made as to Gebhardt's opinion relative

to the relationship between the Department of Justice and

the FBI and Seidel was informed the relationship, in Gebhardt's

opinion, is excellent, should continue, and there should be

flow of information between the

FBI and the Department

of Justice.

At the conclusion of the interview, Gebhardt summed

up his comments by stating that Congress should definitely

set up

a structured oversight procedure of the activities

of the FBI with due regard to the confidentiality of many

of the FBI operations and investigations and must assure

itself that the members of the Committee and its staff will

maintain the confidentiality where necessary.

Secondly, in the areas of investigative matters

usually referred

to as national defense, national security

or intelligence operations, all of the FBI investigations

must be based on the application of the facts toward a

statute, consultation with the Department of Justice should

Re: Senstudy 75

reportedly voiced his displeasure to O'Flaherty stating he

did not approve of the latter's action. The memorandum in

question dealt with CIA's possible use of derogatory information

o determine the direction Senator Jackson would take in futur

ictions he might encounter which might involve CIA activity sp

Thweat advised he would recontact his relative to determine if

this individual would come forward, reveal his identity and

be cooperative in any investigation.

A memorandum from CIA dated 7/29/75 indicates that

James Daniel O'Flaherty, born 11/4/42, is a member of the Staff

• of SSC and has been granted a security clearance up to "Top Secret

On the morning of 7/31/75, Philadelphia Office was

telephonically contacted and instructed to expedite a contact

with Thweat to deterrine the availability of his relative. At

approximately 2:30 p.m., 7/31/75, Philadelphia Office advised

that Thweat, upon recontact, had stated that it would be impossible

to contact his relative before this coming weekend. In conver-

sation, he identified his relative as a niece

who is currently

attending school in Nashington, D. C..

He further advised that

O'Flaherty reportedly is no longer residing with his wife and

is engaged in an emotional relationship with his niece. Thweat

added he believed his niece would be cooperative as she has

expressed her disapproval of O'Flaherty's action. He concluded

by saying that upon determination of his niece's decision in

this

regard he would immediately advise the Philadelphia office.

OBSERVATIONS:

The above information, if accurate, represents a

serious violation of the

agreerent regarding confidentiality

existing between the SSC and members of the intelligence commu-

nity as it relates to material being turned over or made

Memorandum to Mr.

W. R. Wannall

Re:

'Senstudy 75

62-116395

upon this Bureau to make the above information available at

the earliest logical time and in the most complete form

possible to the Department, CIA, and Senators Frank Church

and John G. Iower of the SSC. Accordingly, an interview by

Bureau Agents of Thweat's niece, if she agrees to cooperate,

would appear desirable before initiating any action on the

basis of information received to date.

Additionally, it is not known at this time whether

or not the document reportedly Xeroxed by O'Flaherty is

classified. In our continuing inquiry into this matter,

attempts will be made to identify document, determine whether

it contains classified information and ascertain whether or

not a violation of Federal statutes exists.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. That contact be maintained with the Philadelphia

Office to insure that the desired information concerning

Thweat's niece be expeditiously obtained. If she agrees to

cooperate, she will be immediately interviewed and pertinent

information obtained

furnished, via established liaison

channels, to the Department, CIA, and Senators Church and Tower.

Appropriate field offices will be instructed to conduct

necessary investigation to corroborate the information and

to determine if a possible violation of Federal statutes has

been committed.

The Intelligence Division advised Philadelphia Office

telephonically informed FBIHQ on 8/5/75 that Thweat had returned to

Philadelphia from seeing his niece and indicated she would talk to the

FBI on the condition that she would go to Philadelphia about 8/22/75

to talk to the Agent who is a personal friend of Thweat and to whom

he initially confided the information regarding this matter. Philadelphia

was advised in view of the time lag a more preferable alternative

would be for WFO Agents to contact the niece or as another alternative the

Philadelphia Agent would travel to Washington, D. C., to conduct

the interview. Philadelphia was requested to expeditiously recontact

Thweat concerning the above possibilities.
