Subject: Psychological Programs Subcommittee - Cuba

1. An informal meeting of the Interdepartmental Subcommittee

Mr. Montenegro, State labor advisor for Latin America,

described the anticipated meeting as a "founding" assemblage

of left-wing labor Leaders, socialists, and communists who

will attempt to resolve their differences. State believes

that there will be a concerted effort by the communists

Mexican socialist elements. Following actions were

discussed:

(1) State to cable US Ambassador to Brazil to

ascertain the degree to which local (not national)

governmental elements will support disruptive and

harassing actions before and during the meeting.

(2) State to circularize Latin American posts

with the suggestion that local influences be brought

to bear in order to discourage country delegates

from attending the meeting.

(3) USIA to consider VOA broadcasts to Latin

America in order to exploit exposes of Cuban

East German, and Chinese, Communist labor conditions

actions would be in keeping with Castro's repeated declara-

tions that Cuba is the main source of guidance inspiration

for the

"inevitable" Latin American revolution. Whereas an

inflamed American public opinion over the killing of even a

few sentries might require strong countermeasures, the

training of a greater number of Latin American guerrillas

than the 1500 or more trained in fiscal year 1962, probably

would not.

Nor is it likely that the return of those trainees

to Latin American countries, their establishment of guerrilla

training bases,

recruitment of additional personnel, and

engagement in insurgency actions would be as immediately

provocative as interference with the water supply at Guantanamo

Similarly, closing access to the naval base Cuban workers who

commute would deprive Castro of a source of foreign exchange.

While such items a libe harassment of US aircraft operating in

"the harassment of air traffic into and out

of Guantanamo, " or

the vicinity of or overflying Cuba," might be added to the list,

it is considered that specific provocative actions are less

likely and less dangerous than the intensification of support

to subversive forces in Latin America.

Such action not only

is in keeping with the declared communist intention to support

"national liberation movements of oppressed peoples" but may

be done by means which

avoid an invitation to overt US military

countermeasures which would endanger the Castro regime.

they are considered as of that level of intensity which places

them in the most likely category as well as being in the

category of

most dangerous to the long range interests of the

United States.
