Attached is Scott 'Nann's note on INFOSEC procedures.

It appears that the ARRB reviewers will be able to take lap-

tops in and

out of the building as long as security

requirement for handling classified diskettes and Classified

PCs are met.

HRG will have to maintain the proper logs and

forms.

I propose we implement Situation #3 (board reviewers

can carry their own SECRET Laptops daily in & out of the

building).

We will need 2 or 3 HRC

staffers with media badges to fill out the form 4261 or tc

escort

the Board reviewers

(Martha Lutz

SUBJECT:

Secrecy Agreements with Commission Members

1. At your request, PRD searched its files to find information on how secrecy

agreements have been handled vis a vis members of commissions dealing with

intelligence-related matters. There have been three instances of PRD interface with such

commissions. The first was in 1994 when the Joint Security Commission requested a

PRB review on its report on Counterintelligence and Security Policies, Procedures and

Practices in the CIA in the aftermath of the Ames affair. There is no mention of

Commission membership or secrecy agreements in our files, and, in fact, the Commission

report was finally and properly re-reviewed by a different entity for official

declassification.

2. PRB was also asked to review the final report of the Commission on the Roles

and Capabilities of the U.S. Intelligence Commission (Brown Commission) in 1996.

Again there is no record of secrecy agreements with Board members in our files.

3. Finally and most recently, the Rumsfeld Commission to Assess the Ballistic

Missile Threat to the United States was established in 1998, and its members signed

secrecy agreements. John Hedley, PRB Chair, spoke with the members in March,

explained pre-publication requirements and emphasized the Board's and staff's

willingness to provide guidance and prompt responses to Board members. Since that

time, four of the nine Commission members have submitted a total of 12 manuscripts for

review.

JFK Board Prepublication Review

My comments in bold ( although my computer quit bolding in paragraph 5).

Bruce

ATTORNEY/CLIENT COMMUNICATIONS

Ramona,

The following represents a summary of where we currently stand regarding the issue of

whether secrecy agreements were ever signed by the Assassination Records Review Board ("the

Board"), and offers options to address that issue. Thus far, CIA security officials have conducted

diligent searches, both internally and externally (FBI, White House), to locate any secrecy

agreements that members of the Board may have signed. Those searches have been unsuccessful -

to date, no secrecy agreements have been found. We now intend to search selected Agency

records systems to see if there exists any reference to, or indication of, particular secrecy

agreements that the Board members may have signed. We also will attempt to locate any secrecy

agreements the Board staff signed to see if that leads us to any secrecy agreements the members

may have signed. At this point, however, the likelhood that these actions will bear fruit are not

good.

Our primary goal in this situation is to preserve our prepublication review rights with respect

to future writings of the Board members, in order to prevent the inadvertent release of classified

information (since it is unlikely that any member of the Board would knowingly reveal classified

information). Before considering the options set forth below, it is worth noting that whatever

approach we take with the Board, we may encounter some hostility and resistance due to the

Board's unhappiness with our position concerning the final statement of compliance that we

submitted to the Board. With that in mind, our options are:

1. Do and say nothing, and hope that the Board members will voluntarily submit any future

writings for prepublication review.

2. Provide a generic security exit briefing for the Board which mentions their continuing

obligation not to reveal classified information in any way, without specifically mentioning

prepublication review, and again hope that they will voluntarily submit any future writings for

prepublication review.

Provide a specific security exit briefing for the Board which expressly mentions that they

have an obligation to submit for prepublication review any future writings they plan to publish

(related to their work as Board members) as part of their obligation to protect classified information,

and hope the Board members do not ask for the source of this obligation (since we cannot provide

them with any signed secrecy agreements). In essence we bluff the Board. (**A variation of this

approach would be to have the Board execute an SCl debriefing statement, which includes a

prepublication clause, although it is limited to SCl material**)

4. Have the Board members sign secrecy agreements on the way out. This option would

be difficult to implement as there would be no incentive for a Board member to sign it (there exist

no sanctions for not signing), and it would be legally unenforceable (since the agreement would

provide a benefit to the Agency, but not to the Board members, and therefore would not contain the

no Agency, but not to the in

legal consideration necessary to establish a binding contract). We would have to hope that the

question of enforceability issue is not raised - essentially, amounting to another bluff.

5. We can rely on language in the Snepp case, as interpreted by the Department of Justice

in the mid-1980's, that appears to permit the Agency to write a regulation that requires

prepublication review of the possibly classified writings of non-ClA personnel given access to CIA

information, to allow the DCI to protect intelligence sources and methods. The regulation would be

signed by the DCI, and then the Board would be briefed on their responsibilities and obligations

under the regulation.

READ IMMEDIATELY: JFK Board Secrecy Agreements Issue

ATTORNEY/CLIENT COMMUNICATIONS

Ramona,

The following represents a summary of where we currently stand regarding the issue of whether

secrecy agreements were ever signed by the Assassination Records Review Board ("the Board"), and

offers options to address that issue. Thus far, CIA security officials have conducted diligent searches, both

internally and externally (fBI, White House), to locate any secrecy agreements that members of the

Board may have signed. Those searches have been unsuccessful - to date, no secrecy agreements have

been found. We are also searching selected Agency records systems to see if there exists any reference

to, or indication of, particular secrecy agreements that the Board members may have signed. In addition,

we are attempting to locate any secrecy agreements the Board staff signed to see if that leads us to any

secrecy agreements the members may have signed. At this point, however, the likelihood that these

actions will bear fruit are not good. Moreover, this effort has been complicated by the fact that, at the

outset, the FBI was given responsibility for the security clearance process relating to the Board.

Our primary goal in this situation is to preserve our prepublication review rights with respect to

future writings of the Board members and staffers, in order to prevent the inadvertent release of classified

information (since it is unlikely that any member of the Board or its staff would knowingly reveal classified

information). The last meeting of the Board will take place on 23 September, and the Board will be out of

business as of 1 October. If we wish to address the Board on this issue as a group, the 23 September

neeting will be our last opportunity to do so. Otherwise we will have to deal with each Board member and"

stafter individually, it at all. Before considering the options set forth.below, it is worth noting that whatever

approach we take with the Board, we may encounter some hostility and resistance due to the Board's

unhappiness with our position concerning the final statement of compliance that we submitted to the

Board. With that in mind, our options are:

1. Do and say nothing, and hope that Board members and staffers will voluntarily submit any

future writings for prepublication review.

2. Provide a generic security exit briefing for the Board which mentions their continuing obligation

not to reveal classified information in any way, without specifically mentioning prepublication review, and

again hope that they will voluntarily submit any future writings for prepublication review. Board members

and staffers sign nothing.

3. Provide a generic security exit brieting for the Board which mentions their continuing obligation

not to reveal classified information in any way, and also makes available our prepublication review services

to assist them in this regard, if requested, with respect to any future writings (related to their work as Board

members or staffers). Board members and staffers sign nothing. The success of this option depends

upon the willingness of Board members and staffers to voluntarily submit any future writings for

prepublication review.

4. Provide a specific security exit briefing for the Board which expressly mentions that they have

an obligation to submit for prepublication review any future writings they plan to publish (related to their

work as Board members or staffers) as part of their obligation to protect classified information, and hope

the Board does not ask for the source of this obligation (since we cannot provide them with any signed

secrecy agreements). In essence, we bluff the Board. Board members and staffers sign nothing.

5. In lieu of a security exit briefing, send each Board member and staffer a letter which expressly

mentions that they have an obligation to submit for prepublication review any future writings they plan to

publish (related to their work as Board members or staffers) as part of their obligation to protect classified

information. This approach would make it more inconvenient for the Board to probe for the source of this

obligation (which we would be unable to produce since we have not found any signed secrecy

agreements). Again, we bluff the Board. Board members and staffers sign nothing.

6. Ask Board members and staffers to sign secrecy agreements on their way out. This option

could be difficult to implement as there would be no incentive for a Board member to sign it (there exist no

sanctions for not signing), although Board staffers have indicated they would support this approach.

Generally speaking, a secrecy agreement signed on the eve of separation from government service would

be legally unenforceable (since the agreement would provide a benefit to the Agency, but not to Board

members or staffers, and therefore would not contain the legal consideration necessary to esiablish a

binding contract). However, in this case, if the agreement was modified to indicate that it merely reduced

to writing understandings which had been previously agreed to by the Board, we would have a strong

argument the agreement was legally binding. Of course, this option would alert the Board to the fact that

we do. not have any secrecy agreements previously signed by the Board. Even if the Board agrees to sign

new secrecy agreements before they disband, nothing would preclude them from disputing the

enforceability of the agreements at a later date.

6. We can rely on language in the Snepp case, as interpreted by the Department of Justice in the

mid-1980's, that appears to permit the DC/ to write a regulation to protect intelligence sources and

methods by requiring prepublication review of the possibly classified writings of non-ClA personnel who

have served in positions of special trust and have been given access to CIA information. The regulation

would be signed by the DCl, and promulgated immediately. Then the Board would be briefed on their

responsibilities and obligations under the regulation. Of course, nothing would preclude the Board from

disputing the validity of such a regulation at a later date.

None of the above options guarantee success. However, I have discussed these options with

Dawn Eilenberger, and we believe that Option #_

_ is the best approach to take. OlM concurs. Please let

me know höw we should proceed, since our last chance to deal with the Board as a group will be at their

23 September meeting.

The EXDIR concurs with the OGC recommended option (#5), provided that the letter is low-key and

stresses that the pre-publication review "obligation" is standard operating procedure. Additionally, he

requests the opportunity to view the letter in draft. Thanks.
