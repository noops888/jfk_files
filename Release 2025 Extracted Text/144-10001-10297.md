Cambodia has just learned with astonishment and conster-

nation of the assassination of President JOHN KENNEDY, in

whom we recognized one of the noble statesmen of this era.

His tragic passing will be mournfully felt by all peace and

justice loving people.

In the name of the Royal Government and personally, may I

offer our heartfelt condolences and pray you believe that the

Cambodian people share the affliction of the American people

and the cruel sorrow which has struck the entire world.
