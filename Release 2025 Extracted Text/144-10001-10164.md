SUBJECT: HCSA Request for NSA Material on Kennedy Assassination

1.

Based on our discussion with Judy Miller, my understanding was that

Mr. Blakey's most recent request for data from NSA involved a review of

post-assassination diplomatic product on a world-wide basis to determine

if reports relevant to the assassination exist. Though Ms. Miller did

not specify a time period, a three month period subsequent to the event

of the microfilm files where these records reside.

no more there cord te so one a manual earch

2.

subsequently spoke with Mr. Roger Denk, DIA, who had actually

participated in the briefing of Mr. Blakey, using our SECRET-level statement

as a basis.

Mr. Denk advises that DIA has destroyed all its files which

might relate to the assassination and that, therefore, he had had nothing

to offer Blakey except the NSA-prepared sanitized statement. Mr. Denk also

provided a different, much more ambitious new requirement from Blakey than

that reported by Judy Miller.

3. According to Denk, what Blakey really wants from NSA is for us to

conduct a thorough review of all Cuban communications during the six year

period from January 1959 to December 1964, in order to see "what the Cubans

were talking about/thinking about" of possible relevance to the assassina-

tion - a real fishing expedition in my view. Blakey is also reported to

desire a "characterization of the traffic" - and not the traffic itself.

4. This latest version of Blakey's interests, which has probably

been stated to us fairly accurately by Denk, represents a very significant

work load indeed. Based on some very educated estimates made by the

people in Il2 who maintain the historical microfilm files, there were

approximately 200,000 Cuban reports or translations issued during the six

year period of interest, and roughly 2,000 man-hours of effort would be

required to search these records for items of interest.

As we have discussed previously, I believe that NSA - in a number

of separate, thorough analytic efforts - has performed reasonable and

detailed reviews of all available signals intelligence.

None of these

reviews has resulted in the derivation of any data of direct significance

to the assassination. A summary of these separate NSA efforts is attached.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

15 June 1978

SUBJECT: Actions Taken by NSA to Locate Information Related

to the Assassination of President Kennedy

Over the past fourteen and one-half years, NSA has

performed a number of separate in-depth reviews of

materials in

its files in an attempt to isolate data that might be relevant

to the assassination of President Kennedy.

Nothing of significance

has been determined as a result of those

reviews.

1.

November-December 1963 - Immediately after the

assassination, NSAnitlated a Large-scale manual and machine

review of available SIGINT, including all U.S. /Cuba traffic. (NSA

intercepted messages at an

average of 1,000 per day at that time).

A computer search was initiated using Oswald's name as the minimum

for research criteria.

Additionally, all traffic between Cuba/New

Orleans and Cuba/Dallas was manually reviewed (an analyst involved

recalled that 25 to 50 analysts reviewed the traffic manually,

along with traffic from Cuba and some Soviet traffic).

during the search,

items from the Oswald address book provided by

the FBI were added

to the search criteria.

1964 - Warren Commission - The Commission, in the

person of Allan Dulles, asked NSA to review the exhibits

secret writings or codes which might have been contained in the

documents.

It also appears that NSA searched records for information

on the basis of other Warren Commission requests made informally

by Allen Dulles.

3. November 1975 - Senate Select Committee to Study

Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC) :

In response to an SSC request on the Assassination,

NSA reviewed its Soviet and Cuban files, including Cuban military.

The search was also for material involving Marina Oswald, Jack Ruby

or Earl Ruby (a Harvest run was made) • Mexican traffic was also

reviewed, looking for information concerning Oswald's visit to

Mexico.

June 1976 - Pursuant to FOIA requests asking for

material relating to Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination

5.

December 1976 - Senate Select Committee on Intelli-

gence (SSCI) - Requested all the material we had available on the

Cuban agent problem.

It consisted of 485 reports for the period

1961 - 1965.

All of these reports were received by Committee

Staff Members.

6.

March 1978 - House Select Committee on Assassinations -

Requested all data on Cuban intelligence network and other materials

relating to the Assassination.

All Cuban agent material (1961 - 1964)

was reviewed, as was material that had been previously compiled to

respond to the SSCI and SSC requests.

As a result of the reviews described above, the following

materials which may have some relevance to the assassination were

located (referenced material inclosed at numbered tabs) :

1. Four Cuban diplomatic messages which contained

official Cuban comments regarding press

items that discussed Oswald's

activity in late September 1963 to obtain a visa to travel to

There were also comments on the assassination itself.

The messages are dated in the last week of November 1963.

2. Three Cuban military reports which show that Cuban

military forces did go on alert immediately after the assassination.

3. One 1962 Cuban

Intelligence message concerning the

assassination of Antonio Veciana.

This message was to (Puerto

Rico) SERAFIN.

4. One 1966 Cuban Diplomatic message concerning a Spanish

diplomat in Cuba. It referenced a 1960 plan in Cuba to assassinate

an..USSR dignitary in Cuba and against Raul Castro Ruz, possibly

linking it to the CIA.

to the assassination.

One 1967 message showing Cuban interest in Jim

Garrison's investigation of both the Kennedy Assassination and

David W. Ferrie.
