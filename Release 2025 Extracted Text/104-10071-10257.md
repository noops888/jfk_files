1.

During a recent training period on interrogation with

a (HUGLI8) Case Officer, the point of getting information from

suspects on their international contacts or information that

might help other services was stressed.

Apparently, as a result,

# the, HUGLIB Cage Officer dug into his notes on the interrogation

of Ricardo Ismael VALLECILLO Perez, Guatemalan FAR member, and

came up with the following information which he thought woFIRM

might want to pass to the Mexican Service, 24

VALLECILLOS stated (the Interrogation took place in

December, 1967) that FAR was awasting the arrival of new type

machine-pistol called the Red Star (Estrella Roja) from Cuba.

He stated that it was a 28 shot weapon and would be issued to

commanders of Guerrilla Groups to replace the present Browning

semi-autos.

He then added that the individuals in charge of

Diaz and Adelo (or Abeldo)

a sarcastic remark made by the Case Officer about the

efficacy of the FAR sun-running mechaniem.

(HUGLIB-1O has given his permission to pass this intor-

mation

to the Mexican Service if it 19 considered of any

by HOFIRN.
