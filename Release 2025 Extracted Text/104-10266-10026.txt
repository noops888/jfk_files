1. A meeting with LICOOKY/1 was held at 1100 hours, Friday,
5 April 1968. We breakfasted, and then held the meeting at the
BARTHOLOMEW site. As is detailed below, we reached a mutual
agreement that the relationship was not worth pursuing this was
thoroughly amicable, and recontact methods are available on both
sides.

He was inced to lunch
at the CMUN that day, Sunday. Apparently, GERASSI, is back in the
good graces of the Cuban regime. He told LICOOKY/1 that he would
be spending this Summer in Arizona.
3. LICOOKY/1 has been commissioned by M. S. ARNONI, editor
of The Minority of One, to write a piece on the recent intellectuai/
political developments i Czechoslovakia.
4. LICOOKY/1 thought up, and is arranging, a Czech film fesval
to egin 15 April. It is to be sponsored by the St. Clemens Fiim
Association, St. Clemens Church, 423 West 46th Street (this churca
houses the American Place Theatre -- Robert LOWELL'S group). LICOCKY/1

6. I knew something was bothering LICOOKY/1 and made her
drag it out into the open. She started by remarking that WOFIRM
and its computer apparently checked the welfare of its old agents
every so often, and that this was the nature of our relationship.
I explained that this was not the case, that I had found out she
was in Manhattan and suggested to Washington that LICCOKY/1
might be of some value to us. This surprised her, and she apolo-
gized. She then took off on how when she was in Cubasshe had
dealt with Fidel and Che and Celia, and when she was involved
with Guatemala she was dealing with AREVALO. She said that she
didn't want to sound snobbish, but that she was accustomed to
dealing with top politicos and intellectuals; she referred to a
statement that I had made previously that perhaps she could get
Tana de GAMEZ to invite her along to one of Tana's lunches with
Cuban Permanent Representative Ricardo ALARCON Quesada. She said
that she didn't want WOFIRM to think that she would seek out and
cultivate lower level people, that she wasn't built that way.
LICOOKY/1 said that even though Tana was a friend and that she
liked ner, Tana was not ner equal, and that Täna wasn t 'on her
pedestal". That RCON was certainly not in LICOOKY/l's intellectual
category. LICOOKY/1 said that she considered herself as very flexible,
but not that much. LICOOKY/1 is a "special person" and that
WOFIRM bureaucracy -- with the exceptions of "Bill" (her Mexico
case officer, a friend of the writer), C/WH/1 (with whom LICOOKY/1
is particularly taken), and the writer (LICOOKY/1 repeatedly assured
me that she had a very sincere esteen for me) probably didn't
understand or acknowledge this. LICOCKY/1 said her feelings for
certain WOFIRMers were one thing, but her dislike of WOFIRM itself
was something else. WOFIRM is a massive card index that shows Miguel
Angel ASTURIAS as an old "Nicaraguan war-horse" ASTURIAS of
course is Guatemalan. LICOOKY/l couldn't stop liking Communists
regarāless of WOFIR desires.
and
7. LICOOKY/1 went on and on in this/similar veins, verý
impassioned, but very straightforward and without personal rancor
for the writer. Summing up, the stated reasons as to why she does
not wish to continue regular collaboration with WOFIRM are as
follows:
...
A. fear of compromise -- LICCOKY/1 said that were her
relationship with us to become known, it would ruin her
standing in and associations with the intellectual
community:
B. distaste for WOFIRM -- LICCORY/1 really believes that
WOFIRM is a large card file with all the cards aaving.
errors on them;
SECRET
C. intellectual honesty -- LICCOKY/1 does not think that
her intellectual honesty gains from her WOFIRM relation-
ship;
D. lack of understanding -- FOFIRM, except for the three
officers cited above, does not really understand the
real LICCOKY/1.
8. Obviously, the unsaid reasons are the ones that really
brought about this "confrontation", in the writer's opinion. These
are as follows:
A. emotional instability -- LICOOKY/1, as has been known for
years by the writer, is not the most stable of individuals;
B. money -- LICOOKY/1 receives no money from us anymore
(since her termination in Mexico), and the writer suspects
that LICOOKY/1 could have more easily rationalized working
for the "Giant Indices in Washington" were she on salary;
C. sex -- in this case, lack of same (LICCOKY/1 comes always
to emotional involvement with her male associates, and
her Case Officers cannot fulfill this need, thus giving
rise to problems; in the past, LICOOKY/1 could easily
obtain her physical/emotional fulfillment in Cuba and
Mexico without relying on the Case Officer, but now she is
getting older and quite shop-worn and cannot compete for
attention from men in the environment of a place such as
Manhattan);
D. discipline -- again, in this case, lack of same; LICOOKY/1
tell us what she does, we don't tell her what she should
do.
9. LICOOKY/1 exhibited some anguish over this whole affair.
She has been upset for the past month, over this as well as over
the confused outlook for her in general. It was made very clear
on one point what aid and comfort could have been extended to
LICOOKY/1 to alleviate her anguish, and the writer beat a hasty
retreat to the kitchenette for a tactical drink of water.
10. Not elaborated above were the writer's answers to
LICOOKY/1's opinions, but these were effective in cou...ring her
logic, if not her actitudes. LICOOKY/1 had to agree to : WOPIRA
did have grounds for its assessment of her performance
not awfully good.
SECRET
11. At any rate, the entire proceedings were very amicable,
and, as mentioned above, LICOOKY/1 stressed that her basic oppo-
sition to WOFIRM was not on personal grounds, as she had enjoyed
her dealings with her "three favorite contacts". She offered to
call the writer anytime she had something tangible to pass on, and
that he should do the same. It's just that she would be more
comfortable as an ex-agent than as a current one. The writer
fully expects to hear from her from time to time.
12. It actually was quite an interesting session.
