MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, GS-13 Evaluation Board

SUBJECT

: Recommendation for Promotion to GS-14

Charlotte Bustos-Videla

It is recommended that Charlotte Bustos-Videla be promoted

from GS-13 to GS-14.

2. The performance of this officer has been characterized for

many years by all of her supervisors as consistently strong to out-

standing. She has been able to establish herself as indispensable in......

each Headquärters Branch or Field Station ass gnment, usually

functioning as the backbone of the unit to which assigned. Since return

to Headquarters in September 1972 from her field assignment in Mexco,

her performance has been entirely congruent with the thrust of the

Field Station's enthusiasm over her ability, performance, attitude and

growth potential.

She is currently chief of the Cuban and CA Section

of her branch, and has established once again her mastery over her

assigned duties.

She is the kind of sound, dependable, yet

imaginative officer greatly appreciated by her supervisors. In

short, she is a true professional who pertorms beyond her grade level.

3. In regard to her potential, she has served in the Agency

since 195l, starting as a secretary/stenographer, and advancing

brillantly with each new challenge offered.

She achieved professional

status in 1953 and has spent the bulk of her time since then specializing

In Latin American affairs, demonstruting total flexibility in assiguments,

a voraclous appetite for wak and a penchant for exceptionally precise

and thorough production. A review of her career to date can lead to the

conclusion that she has always risen suecessfully to each new

professional challenge, and is still far from reaching her marmun

capacities. While she has had little supervisory experience in the

field, her supervisor was of the opion that she is a "natural leader".

This has been borne out in her performance in her current capacity

a5 a Branch Section Chief, In which she has demonstrated exemplary

supervisory ability. Notwithstanding her drive, aggressiveness and

professional aplomb, she is a popular co-worker, Is receptive to gudance

and sensitive and responsive to the needs of her subordinates.

4. This employee has utilized her fluency in the Spanish language

to maximum advantage in her work. Formal lesting recently confirmed

her high proficiency in that language.

Coupled with a comprehensive

training recurd and her Invaluable experiences over a twenty year

perlod, she has become particularly effective in Latin American

operations and operational support, demonstrating excellence in each

of several recognized specializations, Including CI operations,

functional support, reports and requirements, area support and varled

covert action activities.

5. The officer's adaptability, high intelligence and mastery over

her trade was of inestimable value to Mexico City Stallon, and over a

fIve year period from 1967 to 1972, she functioned as the Station's

internal troubleshooter. Her duties included the maintenance of

watchlists, screening of travel documents, processing of raw

technical take, target analysis, reports writing, operational support,

handling of outside contract agents, and special assignments as the

Chief of Station's Executive Assistant.

6. The employee is occastonally called upon by the Office of

Training to administer speciallized tratning, and she was chosen

recently to attend the Mid-Career Course ending In December 1972.

Meanwhile, her absence from her new job is felt sorely by the

Branch. A is expected that her current assigmment will last about

two years,

7. In summary, we have here an exceptional officer who has

been performing at the level of a GS-14 for some years; it is now

time to promote her to that grade commensurate with her performance

and which the so justly deserves.

In the 8 months during which she was under my supervision, Mrs. Bustos has

performed in that same hard-working, highly-productive style which has become

her trademark over the years.

She understands the Intelligence process from

start to finish and is personally experienced with each step along the way, save the

agent handling aspects.

She excels in each phase of the work.

As chief of the Branch SA and Cuban activities seclion; she has once again

demonstrated her mastery over her assigned duties.

She is a sound, dependable,

yet imaginative and energetic operations officer, whose performance leaves little

to,be desired. While she had had little previous supervisory experience, she has

in this assignment demonstrated exemplary supervisory ability.

Notwithstanding

her drive, tenacity and attention to detail, she is a popular co-worker, ly receptive

to guidance and is sensitive to, and responsive to the needs of her subordinates.

In her performance of specific duty No. 2, she has brought to bear upon her

daily duties her broad expertence, high fitelligence and good operational sense,

functioning with practically no need of close supervision. It is comforting to

know that an assignment given to this employee is always done promptly, pro-

fessionally and cheerfully.

Her adaptability was demonstrated in her specific duty No. 3. Despite the

press of normal dally activity, she was often called upon to produce "crash"

She has been the back

bono of this section and of those where

she has

worked previously: Her

work has always shown excellent judgement and

ingenuity

A self-starter

with tremendous drive and discipline, the amount of work she has produced

as been prodigious. An excellent team worker, she has never shirked then

is so often haupens - she is asked to take on additional work or work o

a matter outside of her regular field.

While forceful, she is diplonatic

and tactful and is able to present suggestions and criticisms in a plea

sant manner.

She is one of the most dedicated porsons I have met in the

Organization, and exceptionally dependable.

While, as a woman and &

Speclalist,

she has had little opportunity

to handle agents she has done

very well with those we have given her to handle.

She has showed great

ability in the training of iwo

transcribers and in the debriefing of tro

female agents and their husbands. This is in

lnrge part due to her in-

depth knowledge of the targets this section is working on.

The past fea

months have been difficult, requiring the complete reorganization of this

Sectiön and the termination of the majority of

our assets. - Under this

stress,

she has performed in her usual outstanding amanner. Perhaps,

even a

little better.

Her handling

of a great deal of file work has

been

excellent, probably in part because she

was

the one who set it up and has

maintained it in its present very good state.

Subject workod most or Athlyersail tho station PBRUMEN section. Sho

was clearly outstanding in collating information from all sources

during & recont intensifled "PBRUMEN" month, dotermining as a rosult

the overall pattern of tho PBRUMEN ulssion hore, spotting operational

loads

and updating target studios on all PBRUMEN officials as a rosult.

Her final writeup rogarding both new information obtained and the gaps

that romain was thorough and useful.

Subjoct is oxtraordinarily rapid and officient in researching for

info, organizing files and other material and writing up any kind of

resulting momo or dispatch.

Tho same might be said perhaps of some

other real pros in the lA field.

Howevor, in addition, Subject has &

good, tough, oporations-oriented mind and positively contributos idoas

and suggostions re new oporational techniques which the station has

usco profitably. Subjoct has natural managorial abilities is rocontly

demonstrated in her organizing TDY holp in a station-wide filo and

watchlist offort in connoction with a presidential visit.

Her Spanish

1s moro than adequate for reading reports, and handling operational

messagos in that languago.

In sum, Subject 1s a tremendous station

asset and would be extremely hard to replace without noting a serious

loss in station officioncy.

Subjoct's

perfornance during the period of over one year under

review continued

to degerve the rating of Outstanding.

Her major

contributions during. that period were

in the fields of operational

research and exploitation of information obtained through technical

means.

She wag, during this perlod, given full responsability for

the handling of two lull time senior transcribers including adminis-

trativo matters.

In vlow of the difficulty of recruiting target

personnel the task of lully exploiting information obtainod from

technical sources 18 of great importance.

Subject handled this tas&

with her usual enormous capability for

work, displaying Initiative

and great professionalism.

Sho continued, in addition, to handle the

other tasks listed in this report together with sonsative reporting

sent by a separato channel, altogethor a much heavier workload than

1s usually carried by one person.

She was helped in this by her

good knowledgo of Spanish, & talent for administrative work, con-

siderablo analytic exporience and great devotion to hor work.

Subject should be considered for promotion to the grado of GS-14 at

the first opportune momont.
