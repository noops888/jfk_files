in a way that we might save nurselves time by scaling it down

Now the next barrant. ? -

Mr. Kirbow. Could "e taka these one at a time hecause

these are rather critical:

Mr. Chairman, one of the things that came before this

Committee when

I quess it was it. Colhy testifying and at each

meeting that Mr. Miller ard the staff had with the people from

the white House and the crn when we

were preparing the oversight

bill, we heard many good re.sons why ve shou'd

nct. derrive the

pet of this ability to

sion certifying out of certain funds

and being able to expend them without a treat hig red tape

machine to hinder that tine of aneration.

If, as navid. savs: his recommeridation here is to prevent

renrogrammina.. excent within verv narrowly defined statutory

limits. is a first sten toward restricting that further

activitv. I would like to ercent on this and have it discussed

before the Full Committee, or in the absence of that, or

connected with it, have the record that ve have that shows us

that ve should restrict hy lericlation here -

Senator Huddleston. What is the major thrust there?

Is it to in fact limit or rostriot or is it to actually have

it defined and specified in the statute as to what circumstances

miaht prevail?

Me. Aaron. The thrust hore is as follows.

Mr. Aaron. No. we

can't do that. But in his new

responsibilities as DCI for preparing the budget of the entire

national intelligence program. he will now be in a position to

reproaram the entire hudoet and therefore. it's a much larger

For instance, with the comilton on Armed Services.

Senator Huddleston. For other departments?

ME. KiFisOW..

Where there is an authorizing and an

appropriations type action in the Congress, as Senator Hart

will know from his expericnee on that committee, if they wish

to reprogram missile money mar to aircraft, for instence, it

has to be anproved by all fur of those committers, both

Arms Servions and hoth antonciations committees with the

exact transfer of the amounts of moner and the justifications

al.ven therefore.

My concern is not that the contrass should not have

control of this or that you could make it so rigid by making

recommendations that leare

think that unless we have a rary good record on this, we should

just recommending here that in this statute they provide the

framework under which there kinds of reprogiamming can be

done in view of the fact that un are extending the Dol from his

Mr. Kirbow. If that's the intent of the committee, I

nasociated with it: na!'.

Mr. Kirhow. I want to talk about the testimony that

was given before the committae on this from two of the former

nCIs. Mr. Colsy, at both the broakfast briefings he gave and

in testimon, favored the use of individual intelligence offices

around in these various ancies, originating estimates and

everything else: whereas Me.. Helms,. when he testified here,

savs I really don't know ho, that system is corking richt now.

I didn't favor it when Mr. Colby established it, and ! had the

other sustem and it worked well. for no.

So I think here main you are talking about a man

staffing rennirements as thar suit the narticular times and

the individual as to how he wants to run the intelligence

community and what apparently suited Me. Helms fine didn't

suit Mr. Colhy and he uged

different system which he says

works qreat.

And I say that that is, again, a step down thing.

Unless vou want to encourage him to do it in a recommendation

and not mandate that he do it, it kind of makes him run his

husiness the way you want it run and to no apparent abuse

problems.or anything like that.

Senator Hart.

Well, my only thought here

is that some

let's do it.

MI. Bader. The record, Senator, and I can only speak

from personal experience with the board of national estimates

I certainly know of at least four estimates with which I had

a nart of

which the board's le was very imortant in shielding

hoth the pot and indead the anglust from the ravages in two

cases of the military who folt very stronaly that the

continuation of our basen in the Azores was much more important

than sav some hard politioal coalities about the future of

portugese Africa..

And I could cite other rises where this kind of

irisulatind function was enotmously important. It had a

great

deal to do with the exparience. the background and the very

prosence of some of these board members.

They also plav a role as the chairman of the conrdinating

sessions of these national entirates.

There's

control of intelligence chould yo for Defense's purposes in

Its all de novo when i! are in to the full Committer anyway.

Mr. Kirbow. I sinnly indicated to the Chairman earlier

that I didn't want to have a reservation like that and not

point it out to him hecause I didn't want the absent member

to appear to be sandbagging the subcommittee.

Senator Huddleston. Ha's putting us on notice.

Mr. Aaron. Ontion 19, this option steps up to the

nostion of whether the not in his new canacity an the overall

of interneting the budget in torms of ronuirements,

Now ve have heard sone tastimony about the inconsistency

between those two responsihilities..

I think the arguments, if

of reat interest to the camuntty, and vou take him nut of the

position of having to juli? ther people's research and

development, proarams and other people's SIGINi programs, and

other activities when he is the merall director of Central

Intelligence, and that thrrafore this senaration, his removal

finm that, would be a good idea.

The second argument is that you really want to mlace the

authoritu squarely on the mur director of this agency who's

moina to le responsible for clandestine activitios. If he

still has a hoss above hin who is kind of responsible but who

in fact because of his increased responsibilities won't bar

able to rivo the day to day attention to clandestine activities

that he might, if he didn't havo these greater responsihilities

one should make the linee of authority clear and place the

responsibility for the head of this agene: on that agency

leave it there.

Now the armument against that is that ... well, there are

is justified and that this is a mood thim and ve on need

Mr. Bader. I

would just underline that, Me. Chairman,

thn second point that Dari has made about recommending the

two hats would stay togethie:

I think come of us foal that the period in front of us

looking at what we have loarned as a result oi our inquiry

and saving, in fact. this le mind to he an impediment and it

is my personal opinion and I think supported at least by some

testimony that that would he the case.

The second araument. I think, is a somewhat broader one,

I'm not prepare to make it. Ru' we've hal an

Mr. MeCone and also Mr. Helms. Ne. Helms characterizina. the

is

agains; divesting the diractor of the Agency. although

thers

is certainl: evidence fron those who felt that he should be.

Let me see if I can clarify that record a

little more.

First of all: the ceoposal is not to divest him from the

For and ithat would not tate mlace.

The

second point is that I believe the record goes to

the question of sortina out no saparatina the director as he

has to this time existed in the sort of general kind of overseer

and the kind of jawbone authority that he has had. And the

questions that have been out to the witnegses generally have

been nut in the contest of hat ras; un until recentli, his

to the president. He has to defend the budget un on the hill.

and that's in at least four committees. And

then he's got to

have an analvtical base, and presumahly the national estimate

function and on top of that, vorrving about the day to day

enerations of the Agency.

I don't know it that is mre than one may should be

asker to no.

reorganization and re-assionment of functions, almost, and

we're probably confusina that by continuing to call the man

We did not take that testimony any further than receiving his

testimony. That is, we have not taken it to the point of.

asking the agency whether in fact they have such a program

in the Southwest. So the testimony was limited to that one

charge which I personally rave some

real credibility

to.

Ms. Culbreth. Can you explain just what the charge is

here? What is the wrong that ha: been done?

Mr., Kirbow. What's brong with that? That's the question!

I had in the original suggestion at the staft level.

The only human collectiny ve are getting from behind

the Iron Curtain in Russia today is principally either through

our cooperation with the taracli intelligence comnunity using

just this sort of individual and sending them back, or sending

this type of individual from this United States hack inside.

we're not getting the other human intelligence.

Mr. Bader. I was only responding to the question of

what the testimony was.

To go on to the further issue which

I think is going

to be addressed by the comnittee, it's not the question of

whether we should, the Contral Intelligence Agency should be

recruiting foreigners in this country for intelligence purposes

Mr. diGenova. My position is this. Bill.. The first

time I heard about this was when I read it in these findings

and corclusions. I never saw a hearing on it, i never saw a

document about it, I never had a chance to comment on it as

a desianee, and I never had a chance to bring it up with my

Senator.

to say this, without having.

something in a report about

the practice is, how it's been conducted, who has objected to

it. what's the extent of it, before we start maklug a

recommendation.

We're saving we question the practice of recruiting.

I have no objection to the Committee ultimately making

statement like this, I lust don't know what the record is.

This is the first time l've

Mr. Bader. That's why I wanted it bracketad so it could

be so discussed.

MI. Aaron.

My recommendation is that we jet the Agency

on record as to whether this is the practice or not.!

Mr. Kirhon: I recommand it be dropped from this if

we had only one witness and re've not heard the Agency or

that we develop a record to sunport both that and the same

part of that first paragraph, which I con't think we have a

record on either.

Mr. Aaron. We do have a record on that. It's an

interview record, it's not a anorn testimony record. But the

first sentence. there is an interview to support that.

Mr. Kirhow.. Mr. Chairman. I think the subcommittee then

should carefully consider whether or not it is concerned about

We just went then! this the other day with the labor

Senator Huddleston. T have some concern with that too.

When we talk about expresaly prohibiting penetration of

American companies, it seems to me that the question is whether

or not we're penetrating those companies with company executives

being unwitting or whether -

MI. Aaron. That's the point.

Seuator Huddleston.

It seems to me the real problem is

when we were doing it secretly.

MI. Aaron. And that's the point.

Senator Huddleston,

The company ought to have the

right to make a

determination as to whether or not its interest

would be severely jeopardized if this were to happen.

Mr. Treverton. I think this

lanquage probably isn't

clear enough. If we did human

penetration without the

knowledge of the company on the operation of the company

primarily :-

Mr. Kirbow. We're talking about

a corporate operation

against a U.S. company in the United States?

Mr. Treverton. Presumably it would not be in the u.s.

Mr. Kirhow.

If that's what's intended, it does not

convey it to even an inferred reader:

Mr. diGenova. May I eel in this regard, it ends up.

by saying, although accordint to CIA officials such activity

has not taken place - what's the other evirence that it has

which created the sentence?

MI. Aaron. In looking at what the foreign rescurces

division does in the way of penetration of businesses as

opposed to collecting agents on campuses or in some other

walk of life, we found that the I'D actually runs agents in

only a fer cases.

The cases are Americans amployed by local industries in

the United States or consulates.

In other words, in airlomat consulate establishments

in which there are few

CARes

In which indeed the Americans

working for those diplomatic establishments are agents of the

cIn through the foreian resources division, and the Americans

are not officers of the CIA but they were agents of the CIA

in. that resnect.

Me. Kirhow. They work in the embassies

as you say?

Mr. Aaron. Yes, lare in the United States, and this

is talking about domestte impact. This is not the foreign

situation.

There has been at laagt one case and I bellve there are

two but only one I can spectfy: In which the FRD had i

Anerican agent in a foradan compony, a foroion bared meany.

hecause in effect it var a nublie company of a

countr, whose

most business enterprises are ouned by the government. But :

it's a company and it's husiness and it was a foreign company

and the question was, and it related to -

The next question

that was put to, I believe, the chief

of the FRD was do you have any regulations that prohibited

You from

doing the same thing with an American company? And

the answer was no, we don't, although we don't do that or

re haven't done that or

something to that effect.

That is essentially the story and how it came to pass.

Mr. Maxwell. There's some question on both of these

whether there are ways of saving things that are important

recommendationg without tmolving that A, these had gone on

and B, that we have a record to support that.

There's also. I guess, a slight question in my mind

as to the order of maanttute of the recommendations that flow

from this in the promulation of a specific directive.

That's slightle out of synch with the order of some of

the other recommendatione. The committee might vant to choose

to dron that to a

MI. Maxwell. I thought that we had made a finding. It

That's a somewhat different order.

Mr. Aaron. no I tako it that -

Senator Huddleston. Is this penetration always in the

context that it's unwitting?

Me. Maron. Yes. If It's witting, it's really collaboratis

which is another matter.

Senator Huddleston, So although you could be witting

Mr. Aaron, Well. the penetrating also applies and

mayhe we should also make this clear, but for the purposes of

Mr. Maxwell. I don't think, navid, that penetration was

It's to discover whether or not there is in fact a fly in the

Mr. Kirbow. The '47 Act prohibits this kind of conduct

Mr.

The question is if the Committee gets asked a question:

about it later on and

someone comes back and reviews these

as spoken to or something. I

don't really think that's much of a record to go around making

findings and conclusions in 1 final report.

whom the information came. He's probably right.

Mr. Maron. I'd like to recommend that on that particular

coint we tried to nail down with the Agency a little more

carefully what the current policy or nractice is and on the

question - but I still stand with the view, I might say, on

the second one of expressing concern if indeed there is a

practice and we do know that some of it has taken place in the

past, if there's

still no guard against it, then I think berhaps

Senator Hart's recommendation about how the oversight committee

should pursue this question further would be sufficient.

at the question of duploation with overt reporting by the

In other words, it's trying to establish a standard.

Senator Huddleston. Dray, so where are we?

Mr. Aaron. I think we're at the following point that

to the Agency and estahlish what the practice is when review

is necessary of including the paragraph alone the lines

suggested hy senator Hart saying the oversight committee should

Senator Hart:

Can we just commend them for that? Can

we say it's a good practice?

Mr. Aaron. Well, the Committee notes that it's been

the practice not to do this and that that should continue as

a part of their standard proceduras.

Senator Mathias. Have we ever commended them?

Mr. Bader. There is much text here which talks about

Mr. Kirbow. I think we might want to consider too that

CIA coming into the domestic task force report, the subcommittee'

that tomorrow morning at either 9 or 10:00, depending

upon whether this subcommittee meets tomorrow morning, we've

arranged for representatives of the FRD, the Foreign PEsources

Division of the Central Intelligence Agency, to give us:

testimony on some of these issues that have been raised, such

'as."

the use of immigrants, some of the figures that they've given us.

and this question of penetration of American businesses.

That will be scheduled, as I say, at either ? or, 10:00

depending on whether the subcommittee meets tomorrow morn

We would like to have a Senator swear those witn

Mr: Bader. So we'll start at 9:00 promptly:

Senator Huddleston. Senator Mathias had the suggestion

that in view of the fact that there is specific legislation

relating to that subject and that's in the Immigration Act

Mr. Bader. I've asked them to be prepared to speak to

their interpretation of the

provisions and restrictions

thes

Immigration Act.

Senator Huddleston. But our recommendation is that

ve would review the act and the practices.

Mr. Bader. If we have this room, as I hone we do, we

would take the testimony right here and if need be, move it

to another room.

Senator Mathias, In the event that I should not be

able to he here, and I hone I will, I think we ought to look

at this

thing pretty.closely.

which is implied here, the lind of bind that you get these

neople in where they really are perhans totally alienated from

wherever they came from: and what sort of a crack do you put

them in and that not only goes

to bracket. them or identify them and have the principal

discussion take place in the Full Committre.

The internal oversigit. the Office of General Counsel

and Inspector General has not been.

Is that right?

Mr. Maxwell. That's right. No material that was

sed

there was derived from classified material.

Mr. Aaron. So that shouldn't be a problem. The

general papers on covert action and espionage have nut been

given to them. They are just being completed by the staff

essentially. All the others, and the chemical and biological

one has not been shared with then.

Now beyond that all the others, I believe, have now

gone out to the Agency in one

In the meantime, of course, we can still be working on

Mr. diGenova. Yesterday: Mr. Bolton indicated to me

when I was there that there was no way that they could complete

sources and methods review by the 15th of March, and I said

I didn't see how they could either, since they had just really

begun having access a week or so ago or whatever it was.

And they seem to think that the end of the month is probably,

considering the rewrites and a chance to look at the rewrites--

Senator Mathias. I have been independently advised of

the same thing, that the end of the month is marhe a little

ootimistic:

Mr. Miller. Senator Church just talked to Directo

Bush

and I talked to Mitch Regovin Just prior and worked out an

arrangement on the question of clearances of sensitive material

and the Chairman told Me. Bush that he will take whatever time

is required, he asked for expeditious effort on their part.

MI. Bush said that he would urge his troops onward, and he

recognized that there had been snags and difficulties. The

Chairman said that he was not going to press beyond tha

capability of either side. He wants to do the proper job

and whatever time is required.

He sald that he hoped that we could cooperate and work

It out so that we could fintch by the and of the nonth.. And

Mr. Bush said that he would make every effort to do that.

So that seeis amicahir between the Chairman an! the

Director.

Mr. Kirbow. Mr. Chairman: on that particular thing, at

the staff level I had bracketed that entire paragraph hecause

I'n not sure what we're treing to accomplish by what you say

there.

This is probably the most difficult task that faces

counter-intelligence orgnization any place in the world

is to establish whether or not a defector that you have just

picked up is a double agent or not.

I. listened to the man who has done this all his adult

life at the Agency, Mr: Angleton, and he never made it clear

just how you ever are sure that you have a bona fide.

And then his follow-on said basically the same thi

What do ve intend to do with this finding? Do we intend then

to legislate something? Nhat are we going

to do with it?

Mr. Aaron. The finding goes to the recommendation later

that there be essentially for other purposes. But a

subcommittee of the National Security Council on the subject

of counter-intelligence which would look at other matters

and

we will get to that in a momant, but aiong its tasks is that

It would be a forum in which differences of opinion as to the

bona fides of a defector could be discussed and potentlally

Isconciled.

Mr. Angleton testified and spoke at length in other

forums with us about the foot that when - that at cresent there

really is no way that there's a difference between the rBI and

is not secret or clandestine and is available to the CiA and it

would be their job to compile it.

And that does not

exclude other functions.

For example,

the analytical function is not mentioned here. This is simply

to rive it the collection function and that is because the

paper is simply organized in that fashion. It doesn't try to

step up to the whole charter, every aspect of it. We just try.

to hreak it rown.

Mr.. Maxwell. Should there be a kind of overt foreign

Intelligence which the NSC with the mechanism for allocating

priorities

within the intelligence community

should

done by the CIA?

It could under the formulation now do that.

Mr. Aaron.

That's why for examole there's one thing that

they do that's overt. Even their clandestine people abroad

do an overt collection job

and that is biographic information

and that, while it was once in the State

Department, was

transferred to the CIA hecause they have a lot of clandestine

biographic Information and as a matter of centralizing and

efficiency the decision was made to move it over there.

That kind of thing would not be precluded and wuld still

exist.

Now it goee on to state that in doing thir we would also

recommend authorizing the did to marry out the recruttment of

agents within the United Statas for this purpose.

And it goes

Further to say that there would he an annual review of this

activity by the senate c'orsight committee and by the

counter-intelligence committee which we proposed be established

and has been agreed here as a recommendation of the National

Security Council.

Now the further sentence that is in brackets calls upon

the Attorney General to certif

to the President and to

the oversight committee that these actions are being taken in

a manner that does not violate the Constitutional rights of

American citizens or any other provision of law.

Trying to keep track of the domestic intelligence

recommendations is a little hit like painting a moving train,

but this tends to coincide with their recommendation, and the

purpose of this is obviously to place a little tighter

restriction and more authority in the hands of the Attorney

General to ensure that these domestic espionage-related actions

that are conducted on

a covert or clandestine basis aré in

fact not infringing on Constitutional riahts or attempting to

break the law in any way.

Mr. Kirbow. You're scally talking about recruitments

noir.

You're not talking shout other clandestine and covert

activities and operations?

Mr, Aaron. That's correct. It's not, for example, if

vou were to establish a hare in Florida for the purposes of

harassing Cuban shipotra.

That would not come up here.

Mr. Kirbow. And the bracketed Information, Mr. Chairman,

was that I didn't feel at the time we considered this and I

asked that it be bracketed, that the Attorney General who is

never going to operate in this area alone, he is not going

to make these decisions without staff support of some description,

and if he's going to do that with people in the Department of

Histice, which is where he gets the staff, the concern of the

people in the Agency about broadening even within their own

agency those people that know about the agent procurements and

where they are and whom they are is of vital concern. It's

probably one of the most carefully guarded secrets. Even:

extent that Mr. Colby testified before

call in intelligence matters to put the Attorney General and

his staff Into the agent procurement business.

It's a chicken and

Senator Hart. The procedures. Nothing in here. I mean

we have araued this thing for 13 months, there's nothing here

that reuires the Agency to turn over names of their sources

or anythin like that.

The Attorney General doesn't need to know the names

even

more than Bill Colby does, or less. Tust to find out

the procedures of violating the laws of this country, thats

all.

Ms. Culbreth. Could

I raise another point, Mr.

Chairman?

It seems to me that one of the concerns that you have

with having the Attorney General certify in this specific

case to the

president and also to the oversight committee

ts a consistent problem that I think runs throughout our

recommendations.

on the one hand, we are describing for accountabtllty

within the Frecutive Branch of the proper people, and en the

other hand we

are afraid that if we make him accountable, we're

alving him so much pover tiat they are soing to dierenard the

In this specific mibuntion, for example, we've already

responsibilities. When he takes office he already has the

obligation to see that all the laws and activities of agencies

are carried out as they're supposed to be.

And in addition to that, we are proposing in another

part of our recommendationg that the general counsel and the

inspector general of the CIA be subject to

Senate confirmation

so that there are lots of other kinds of checks, and I would

just hope that as the Senators consider additional proposals

is hamstringing them inside the agencies on how they carry

oilt the responsibilities:

Each one of these standing by itself may look like,

well, this is a good idea and we should have this additional

certification or this addition chain of reporting and making

But I have a fear after having looked through a good

Mr. Migenova. Mr. Chairman, I would add in that regard

that with regard to the shootic recommendation, this 18

not going down into the Atency. This is talking about the

Attorney Ceneral who is the head of an agency, first of all,

and the history has shown that other Attorneys General who

took the same oath that this man did didn't do their jobs

one of the reasons was that they didn't know ahout certain

And the nurpose of this provision is to make them aware

The provision for confirming the inspector genaral and

I have worked in a state law department and had to

stan some certifications

I think we should get him involved but I question whether it

Mr. Aaron. I think that's a fair point. The question,

I quess, the case at which the certification would run most would

add to what already, is in the sentence

preceeding it which"

is review. by the Committee which the Attorney General is

to chair, would be the case in which the Attorney General is

aware of a particular activity, is aware that it is illegal

but tust doesn't do anything. about it on

the theory that it

is somebody else's businesa. And he doesn't really, he doesn't

have an obligation in this category of matters to render

a indement and bring it to the attention of the President

the congress.

Senator Mathias. Why don't we say this, that the

Attorney General be required to advise the President and the

oversiaht committee that he is familiar with the procedures

established to accomplish this purpose and that he is not

aware of any violation of the constitution or other law in:

the execution of the action..

I think you can lay that kind of a burden on the Attorney

Genéral .

Mr.. Aaron. Would it he cossible to just make it sort:

of a reporting function in which he said; and this is in the

Senator Huddleston. If in his opinion.

Senator Mathias. I wouldn't have any trouble with that.

Me. Maxwell. I have one other point on that paragraph

and that is it provides for annual review by the counter-

intelligence committee of the National Security Council.

I had understood we were dealing with the recruitment

of agents for the United States foreign intelligence purpoges:

and the question is whether the counter intelligence committee

which was

to focus on resoliing issues involving the bona

Eldes of defectors, issues hetween the FBI and CIA, would be

the body which would have the appropriate knowledse in the

positive intelligence value, or whether it should be assigned

to a counter-intelligence function.

It's simply a question of where the responsihility

should be allocated for revieving those within the National

Security Council

structurs, and I wasn't clear whether the

counter-intellidence committee was the appropriate one.

Mr. Aaron. Well, on that point. the purpose of setting

un the counter-intelligence committee is essentlilly to look

at the domestic imact of our intelligence activities. the

The CIA sort of dae this in part as a service of

cummon concern to the in'elli ence community and in part at

last heretofore it does the piert collection function as a

service to its own analystr.

This was particularly in the early days when we had

less access

to information in the denied areas of the world.

It was a very rich soures o' information for us. It still is

mutte a good and important and coonomical source. and it's

mood program. The

mestion is how nuch it should f involved

in clandestine support and if. you want to find a way to

ercourage

it, to. if vou will. enchasize its overt mission

over its covert mission or de vou want to put it back into

some overt side of the donner or the rovernment?

Mr. Maxwell. I have come very mixed feelings about this

recommendation and the problom might be described better

looking at the flow of intormation from the end point.

The irD now is involved in the recruitment of agents

for foreian intelligence gathering within the United crates.

A number of times they need, and I think they have indicated

to the committee that they mood some heln in determining whether

they should go to an indiritual and say, can you introluce

If it is from the sch. it has all the problems that

The

question the committee has to face is where they are going to

It's located in Dod from the now, whether it's located in the
