Your telegram NI. 23((A)).

I have already intervened with the United States Embassy

in Mexico City with regard to the person concerned, who is an

American and whose records have been shown to the Swiss Embassy

in Havana. Since the assassination of the President of the

United States, American services have become extremely rigid

and seem to appear more reticent regarding the American citizen,

a former officer, living in Cuba. Mexican services will issue

a transit visa as soon as the American Embassy in Mexico City,

where the matter has been pending fora month, makes the request.

I suggest an intervention also be made in Washington. I

shall see what I can do unofficially.
