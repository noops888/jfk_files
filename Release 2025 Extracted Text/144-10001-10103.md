I. KENNEDY's murder and its causes.

A. Since the announcement of the assassination, there

have been rumors in diplomatic circles, and in some of the newspapers

and radio broadcasts and various other quarters about the facts and

motives of the event and the position of the Dallas authorities

toward it, etc.

Some are of the opinion that the crime was arranged

by some radical right-wingers who had been aroused by KENNEDY's

policy which advocated racial equality, by his position toward some

of the big industrial forces, particularly steel, and by his

strategy which [Part 2] called for a truce with the Soviets and

for finding spheres of co-operation with them. Others believe that

the crime was set up by the radical Communists who oppose the policy

of peaceful coexistence. One faction of that [group said that the

crime was an individual act committed by a fanatic or a deranged

person.

The killing of OSWALD, who was accused of KENNEDY's

murder,

the circumstances under which it was committed and the

new suspicions it raised in and outside of America (1 wd GJ

also reported today that the Senate Judiciary Committee would in

turn request an investigation of the miter and also discussion of

legisiation to make the murder of a President a federal crime

which would not fall under the legal jurisdiction of any state.

It is hoped that the coming investigations will reveal

the following: (Part 4]

Was OSWALD the killer and what were his rotives?

If

OSWALD was not the killer, who conmitted the crime? Was it a

conspiracy or an individual act? Was it an American or an inter-

national conspiracy?

The prevailing view among circles known for conser-

vatism is that it is essentiai to make a meticulous and public

investigation to forestall rumors and in order to dispel unjustified

suspicions, elevate the power of the law and protect American honor

in the eyes of the world and history.

II. The new President and his policy: (Part 5]

The leaders of Congress from both parties and the top officials

in the government and the press and radio worked energetically

to prevent division and confusion ((A)) life to normal, after it had

almost come to & standstill, by supporting the new President and

advocating unity and working for the future.

In order to restore

confidence and clarify matters, the President hastened to announce

his domestic and foreign policy in a speech which he delivered to

Congress in joint session, with the chiefs of the diplomatic

missions and representatives of the international and American press

also present. (Part 6]

He announced that his foreign and domestic policy would be s

continuation and implementation of the policy of his predecessor:

A. From the international standpoint, he stated that he

supported the policy of seeking peace and exploring spheres of

cooperation, even with antagonists, offering aid to emerging

nations, bolstering the Western alliance and fulfilling America's

obligations from South Viet Nam to Berlin. He summarized his foreign

policy by saying thai America would be ready for peace or wár.

B. Erom the domestic standpoint, he also adhered to

KENNEDY's program and urged [Part 7] Congress to hasten to enact

the racial equality bill, the tax reduction bill, the education law,

etc.

This speech is the fist official document which, at least on

the surface, reveals that the new President will adhere to KENNEDY's

foreign and domestic policy. The view which is current in some

western diplomatic circles is that the new President is an expert

in the methods and the directing of American partisan policy and

that he was extraordinary in his handling of the various currents

in Congress; however, (Part 8] he has not been sufficiently exper-

lenced in soreign affairs and he leans more toward the conservatives

than the liberals, Some of chese circles have also stated some

apprehensions about him and have said that he is from the re-

calcitrant, conservative South and that his connection with the

oilmen in Texas is weil known and that his long service in the Armed

Forces Committee in the Senate has made him closely connected with

the top men of the armed forces, and these persons do not like

KENNEDY's policy which advocated trying to reach an understanding

with the REssians. Then, his friendship with the American Ambassador

in Bonn, [Part 9] MI. MCGHEE, who leans toward ADENAUER's views on

Moscow, might make him more inclined toward a policy of toughness,

not truce, with regard to the Communist camp.

Some Britons think It possible that KHRUSHCHEV will have no

confidence in him and that DE GAUliE may seize the opportunity to

activate his plans in Europe. They, therefore, advocate that

Britain take the initiative in playing a nore prominent role in the

Western camp in the directing of international policy.

Nevertheless, the prevailing view here at present if nothing

happens to force him to change--is that he will not change KENNEDY'S

foreign policy [5G] [Part 10] nor in method and [6G] to give

assurance. He, therefore, will retain most of KENNEDY's advisers,

the most important being his number-one adviser in international

affairs, BUNDY. Since the new President has a propensity for

domestic political affairs, they expect him to rely more on the

Sacretary of State, It is well known that JOHNSON especially

appreciates RUSK.

Political circles here also believe that (Part 11] he will

continue the domestic policy of his predecessor, at least until

the

presidential elections.

It is, therefore,: (B val supposed) that he

(B val wil retain) most of his Cabinet and will enter the election

campaign on the basis of KENNEDY's program. Also, they think it

most likely that JOHNSON will be the candidate of the Democratic

Party in the coming presidential elections at the end of next year.

They think that the chances of COLDWATER, the right-wing Republican,

have

Zassened and that the Republicans might nominate ROCKEFELLER OF

NIXON and that the latter's chances have increased. (Part 12]

It is risky to make any predictions now about the results of

the coming presidential campaign. Nevertheless, it appears that

it will be between JOHNSON and a middle-of-the-road Republican

not a radical right-ringer, because the prevailing sentiment of

public opinion is a demand

to repair the breach and close the wound

and to raise [to higher priorityl the policy of reconciliation

and interest in domestic affairs.

Some of Peking's supporters in North Viet Na, Laos and North

Korea are reiterating that KENNEDY's murder reveals a victory of

reactionary trends.

It is to be noted that at present there is an

increase in the activity of the Viet Cong forces in South Viet Nai.

[Part 13] Also, the press of North Korea and the Pathet lao in

Laos have intensified their attack on Washington. They explain the

position of Peking and its supporters [4C] that on the one hand, their

view may be represented in [the statement] that the policy of the

new President will be less flexible than that of his predecessor but,

on the other hand, perhaps the attack is a means of testing the '

rigidity of the new American administration.

Some circles in Britain believe that JOHNSON is an astute

politician who is skillful in figuring and evaluating and a con-

servative who is practiced in conducting a policy of conciliation.

III. The Embassy's observations:

KENNEDY's death has created a new situation in America

and on the international scene, the landmarks of which are at

present unclear. Therefore, it appears to us that the position

which prevails in western and Fasteen diplomatic circles and in the

neutral group is one based on watchiulneas and acting with extreme

care and caution and attempting to begin a careful operation to

disclose, on the one hand, the reai leanings [Part 15] of the

new administration and its method of operation and the forces which

can influence it, while working on tha other hand to establist

friendly, constructive relations with it as far as possible.

B. This has been clear in the contacts of MIKOYAN In

Washington and his statements about his government's desize to

continue the policy of reaching an understanding and in the reports

of some Russian diplomats that KHRUSHCHEV and JOHNSON must meet, etc.

The same attitude is to be noted with the British, the French,

the Yugoslavs, etc. (Part 16]

C.

Matters will remain unclear as long as the circum-

stances, motives and forces behind KENNEDY's death remain

undefined. Then, any basic surprise in this regard might have a

long-range effect on domestic and external conditions. The presenc

[situation] is that KENNEDY and his top aides sensed the toughness,

and (B val despair) of the forces which opposed their liberal,

realistic policy and, therefore, had not concealed that from us,

something which we had explained fully to the Ministry.

C. [sic] Despite the obvious difference in

"the

personalities/ of KENNEDY and JOHNSON-the former was a blend

[Part 17] Of ideslism, and realism, rare intelligence, -aroad

knowledge, deep understanding of the developments of history

and the secrets of human psychology at its highest and lowest,

loyalty to the welfare of the world and his country and of courage

and fidelity to the rule of reason and the bond of friendship;

also, he [1 wd G] drawing around him domestic and foreign policies

while JOHNSON has more of an inclination and adherence than KENNEDY

to the econonic system based on irse anterprise and, theréfore,

is more inclined to the sight wing (Pare 18% and closer to the

conservative policy and the past generation and further from the

left wing which is more intellectual and possesses long range

imagination and which KENNEDY had led--despite this, it is (1 wd G]

at present to make any predictions about the final course which the

new President will follow. The prevailing view here is that there

will be

no basic change in KENNEDY's policy until the presidential

elections are held-the end of next year.

Nevertheless, it depends

on the development of events. [Part 1910

D.

Signs that KeNNEDy's policy will be continued appear

in the speech of the new President before Congress, the statements

of top officials here in the State Department, the writings of top

writers and the retention, so far, of the members of KENNEDY's

cabinet and his top advisers and confidants in the white House,

the Stute Department and other dapartments,

E. Then,

the many complications donestically and exter.

nally would make any minor change, particularly; toward Moscow, easy

practically but dangerous realistically. (Part

20]

Since 1* is likely that the new President will be less (B val

able) to resist pressure than his predecessor and since, because

of his long service in domestic politics, he may by nature be more

prone to keep considerations of domestic politics in mind and to

proceed in conformity with their (B val requirements) and to endeavor

to satisfy them and because his philosphy and his methods are

different from those of his predecessor. It would therefore be

to our interest until the presidential elections are held to follow

a policy which would not expose him to pressure or embarrassment so

as not to enable our enemies to draw him (Part 21 over to their

side. This is the essence of the matter at present. It would appear

that our opponents willibry at the first opportunity to complicate

matters between us and the new administration by exploiting:

the

position to teet or the Also an or disp de pee ey and a

chance to raise it; etc.

In the light of the above paragraph, it would appear to us

at present that JOHNSON may continue the policy of his predecessor

toward us.

He may be encouraged to do that by the (Part 22]

positive results achieved by the policy of his predecessor in this

regard and by the supporters of this policy both in and outside

the government, the most important being Secretary of State RUSK

and FULBRIGHT,
