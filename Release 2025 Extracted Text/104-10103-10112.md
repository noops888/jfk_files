An undercurrent of friction has recently developed between

AMICE/14 and AMTRUNK/3 which manifested itself in a fistfight on

29 March.

This was precipitated by AMTRUNK/3 who called AMICE/14

the Cuban term for a homosexual, the ultimate insult to a Cuban.

This in turn gives rise to the question whether AMICE/14, with a

possible history of homosexual activity (see UFGA-8411), has made

I. STATUS REPORT ON TRAINING AND PROCESSING, 4-31 MARCH.

The AMTRUNK Team, consisting of AMICE/27;

•and AMTRUNK/3 were safehoused on 4 March

AMICE/14,

AMTRUNK/2,

1963 at Safesite #164

on Plantation Key..

Andrew S. PARMERS, KUROAR instructor from

headquarters,

was already at the training site when the team

was brought there by the two case officers, Irving N. PEGGINS

and Hobart J. VANDEBORN. PARMERS remained

at the safesite

until 16 March during which time he conducted training in

clandestine methods and techniques.

This training included

security, cover and compartmentation, clandestine communica-

tions,

agent spotting, selection, recruitment and management,

and operational planning and reporting.

The training included

group discussion and participation in

a series of 'appropriate

operational situations, several problems,

and daily physical

training.

During this

two week period,

either PEGGINS or

VANDEBORN visited the safesite every

day, spending an average

of two or three hours with the group

in operational dis-

cussions and processing.

During the week of 18 thru 23 March,

both case officers spent a majority of the time with the group,

debriefing them in detail on

their operational contacts, workin

out operational details of their infiltration, and continuing

their training on an informal basis.

The week of 25 through

30 March was spent in PM-type training with emphasis on compass

and map reading, including two night problems,

and on weapons

familiarization

and firing.

During the period under dis-

cussion the AMTRUNK group were all LCFLUTTERED,

were assessed

by the KUROAR assessment team, were given an initial series

of immunizations, were issued

clothing, were processed for

alias documentation, were processed for disguises,

and were

further processed on cover and finance problems.

The re-

sults of the LCFLUTTER examinations were

under cover of UFGA-8111,

sent to headquarters

on 13 March 1963.

Based on DIR

26430,

no further LCFLUTTER is planned at the present time.

These two individuals plan to go into

Havana for a period of approximately twe weeks, and then

exfiltrate black from the same point at which

they infiltrated.

Phase two.

involving AMICE/27 and AMICE/14, will consist of

black infiltration through the keys area on the north coast

of. Matanzas.

These two individuals will likewise_go into

Havana for a period of several weeks and then exfiltrate black.

These two phases are discussed in detail in following para-

graphs. Phase. One and Phase Two are preliminary infiltrations

designed to set up infiltration/exfiltration routes and to

make initial contacts among certain select high level military

figures in Havana.

The following paragraphs discussing these

phases are not designed to be operational plans.

Detailed

operational plans for each phase will be forwarded as de-

veloped.

years, and in some degree experienced in clandestine opera-

He attended Catholic Social University in Havana for

two years,

majoring in Social Studies®

Prior to Fidel's

takeover A/2 was allied to student elements of the Partido

Autentico which upheld the constitution of 1940.

He supported

the revolution against Batista till it became apparent that

Castro had cast his lot for a Communist regime.

During his

university years from 1959 to 1961 he was actively engaged

in supporting anti-Castro groups with weapons and materials.

Following the Playa Giron invasion great many in the Havana

underground were rolled up but A/2 avoided compromise.

He worked under A/2 in

the underground

as an action type,

principally engaging in sabotage.

His

underground work began

while he was

in secondary school

when in 1958 he supported the revolution against Batista..

In late 1960 he sided with the counter-revolutionaries and

began full time anti-Castro activities.

After

While A/3 has performed satisfactorily

in his training up to date, his performance falls far short

of the other three members.

A/3 feels KUBARK should onlv

monoport for this operation and should not inter-

ere in the actual plans of the operation

Fortunately his

role in this operation is comparatively minor and he appears

willing to comply with whatever A/2 decides.

Nevertheless,

direct control of A/3 offers problems in the future.

F. OPERATIONAL AND SECURITY EVALUATION

1.

The operational aspects of Phase I portrays a mission which

has considerable potential but also considerable risk.

The

area of infiltration is within five miles of a cruise missile

site and its accompanying radar.

In addition boat patrols are

known to work this portion of the coast at frequent intervals.

to Guanabo or Havana and

safehouse him.

This, however,

may

jeopardize the operation because A/3 lacks the maturity and

patience necessary to stay put while A/2 goes about his busi-

ness.

He may take advantage of his visit to Havana to under-

take a clandestine assignment on his own.

When A/2 and 3

step ashore in Cuba, control will vanish.

Fortunately A/2

has a sufficient resource of judgement to go about his busi-

ness competently.

Unfortunately A/3 gives no such indication.

For this reason an attempt will be made to steer A/3 towards

developing assets around his (lather's farm)with maritime

reception capabilities.

2. . A/2,

on the other hand, appears to have a sufficient numbe:

addition both men are presently outside of the Cuban Army

organization and this position may dampen their effectiveness

While there is no

evidence to verify that DUARTE is pro-regime, there has beer

a recent report on him from AMLEO/3 which claims DUARTE is an

continued to aid him

still leaves a question

mark next to the worth of DUARTE which unfortunately can only

be resolved by direct contact between him and A/2.

There are

other security implications which should be discussed in this

evaluation.

Both A/2 and A/3 cannot be considered truly se-

curity conscious.

While safehoused A/2 wrote a letter to a

contact in Miami

which was to be transmitted by his case

officer.

The letter gave an indication that A/2 was seeking

contacts in Havana and conveyed the impression that a trip

was in

the dfing. A/2 has written several other letters

not seen by his C Os which might have given the same impres-

sion.- AB on the other hand talked quite freely about his

operation to Your friends in New York prior to coming to

and being salehoused He explained that he was joinine

AMICE/27 and AMTRUNK/2 on an operation that would take them

first to Miami and then to Cuba.

Once there they would go

to his

father's farm and begin to make contacts.

A/3 also

stated

that a man named DUARTE

would be one of their con-

tacts.

This loose talk

coupled with A/3's attitude that

KUBARK exists only to serve him makes him a marginal candi-

date for this operation. However, if A/3 is exfiltrated

•three days

after his entry into Cuba,

the operation will

gain, his usefulness and eliminate some of the risk he

presents.

3.. The above evaluation stresses the operational and

security

weaknesses in this operation.

In contrast to these weaknesses

are the positive considerations of this mission.

A/2 has the

intelligence, competence, and confidence to approach and re-

cruit two assets with the potential for developing anti-regime

operations. at a high level within the Cuban Army.

The results

which these anti-regime activities can accomplish is a matter

for conjecture but it appears that they carry potential.

Nevertheless,

It the operation continues,

it will bear

watching in terms of security and control for these factors

will jeopardize the operation as well as KUBARK's position

if not properly contained:

A. AMTRUNK PERSONNEL

senior member of the AMTRuNK group

is a 41

year old PBRUMEN citizen from

a wealthy

"hign class family.

His father, now deceased, was a prominent individual in law

and

politics and was at one time a senator. A/27 himself

graduated from law school in Habana and was a practising

lawyer.

In 1959 he became legal adviser to Camilio Cienfuegos.

Following the disappearance of Cienfuegos in October 1959,

A/27 began to engage in counter-revolutionary activities.

In May 1961,

at which time he held the position of Under-

Secretary of Public Works, he felt that his underground

• activities. had come to the attention of the government and

he took refuge along with his wife in the Venezuelan Embassy.

He was

given safe conduct from the Embassy to PBPRIME in late

1961.

Subject is intelligent, articulate, and highly moti-

vated.

He has some experience in counter-revolutionary

activities and has demonstrated an excellent capacity for

learning clandestine techniques.

COVER AND COMMUNICATIONS

AMICE/27 and AMICE/14 will live black during their entire stay

in Cuba.

They will be equipped with alias

documentation and

with disguises.

Both of them have previously lived in the

Havana

area

and know the city well.

They will be trained in

Secret Writing (SW) and will plan to train at least two and

possible three agents in Havana in SW, prior to their own

exfiltration.

In addition, it is planned to train A/27 and

A/14 in OWVL. At the time of infiltration, exfiltration plans

will have been laid on with the agents.

In the event that a

change in time or location of exfiltration becomes necessary,

an OWVL message could be sent to the agents.

Any urgent

and

immediate message which might have to be sent by the

agents

during their short stay in Havana would be on a prearranged

open code system by commercial telegram.

Such a system will

be worked out to cover several possible

contingencies.

In-

ternal communications of whatever net is organized by A/27

and A/14 will be arranged by courier, cut-out, live and dead

drops.

Control over AMICE/27 and AMICE/14 is basically lacking.

Control however will

tenuous at best and A/27. will continue to be a dif-

COMMITMENTS

According to AMICE/?7, the following principle, which he

enunciated during his

government which

is anti-Communist and which operates on

democratic principles;

ODYOKE does not desire to impose a

government of its own choice upon Cuba"..

A/27 has made

big point of discussing this "commitment".

It is apparent

that he intensely dislikes (or fears?) Batista and his

followers.

It is also apparent that in his mind he links

Batista and KUBARK, and fears that KUBARK would back Batis-

tianos in à post-Castro government.

AN ANTRUNK group members think that they received a

comment thile in ZRMiTAl that ObYOkE" would support their

operational plan, with funds.

and technical

assistance, but would leave control of the

operation entirely in

their hands

In other words. they

are not working for ODYOKE or KUBARK in any sense.

On this

point they are

very sensitive.

Another commitment which AMICE/27 claims to have discussed

"""'O In ZRMETAL is that ODYOKE should give "official recognition"

to members of a conspiracy which culminates in a successful

coup d'etat, following the coup, in order that these individual:

not be treated as political criminals by a future regime.

This means recognition of an individual's participation in

the conspiracy, not a promise of recognition of a specific

government formed by the conspirators themselves.

4.

Discussion of the above "commitments" has been pressed

several times by A/27.

PEGGINS has not agreed to any of these

commitments with A/27. However, A/27 feels that the com-

mitments have already been made by ODYOKE in ZRMETAL.

One further negative commitment has been discussed between

PEGGINS and A/27.

mitment will be made at this time to support any internal

group organized by the AMTRUNKS with weapons or explosives

and that this extends specifically to no promise to support

active sabotage with demolitions.
