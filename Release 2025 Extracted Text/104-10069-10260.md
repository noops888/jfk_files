The Information Council of the Americas (INCA),

of 620 Gravier Street,

New Orleans, Louisiana, was recently opened as a source of foreign intelligence

information on the radio broadcasting industry in Latin America.

The current

progran of INCA is primarily concerned with the dissemination of taped record-

ings of anti-Communist material, Called Truth Tapes, to certain radio broad-

casting stations in Latin America and North America for use as a weapon against

Communist penetration in the Americas.

Its headquarters are located at 620

Gravier Street, New Orleans, Louisiana 70130. You will find the names of its

officers, directors, and consultants given on the enclosed letterhead of the.

organization.

2. We have been in recent contact with Edward Scannel l' Butler, Executive

Vice President and Staff Director, and have received his assurances of whole-

hearted cooperation in our agency's mission. Yesterday we examined all of the

files of correspondence between Mr. Butler and personnel of various radio.

stations in l6 Latin American countries.

In order to build up a market for

the Truth Tapes program in Latin America, Mr. Butler first obtained from the

appropriate consul in New Orleans a list of the radio stations in operation in

his country. He next wrote the administrative personnel of these stations

about the anti-communist purpose of INCA and offered to supply each station

with Truth Tapes. Those stations requesting them sere then provided with a

series of the tapes.

One or tiro years later, Mr. Butler sent the participating

station a questionnaire designad to elicit information. about audience response

to the Truth Tapes program.

Copies of the first questionnaire and of a revised

one are attached for your information. Judging by the responses he read, the

INca correspondence files will provide a limited amount of information; dated

i954 and 1065, on the identification of radio stations in Latin America which

are broadcasting Truth Tapes, their addresses, the names of key personnel, the

identification of stations not respondina to the luca offer, sizes of audiences,

and their responses, In the case af-Uruguay the exchange of correspondence

between Mr. Butler and Dr. Martin

bet penite buter tator Marty alarmelon neared in mation out

example, lorever, is an exception, since the files contain virtually no

detailed political information of significance.

Butier mentioned vestorday that, inasmuch as he hus again ravising

the questionnaire, he toulo veleone our suggestions noout additional topics.

• We

• sumested questions designad to elicit toohnical inforation about ithe station

and its eguipment, such

as descriptions (nanufacturer, type, model) of trans-

mitter, receivar, antenna type and power, frequencies and frequency ranize, reli-

ability of equipment, normal and emergency power sources, remote pick-up arrange-

rents, etc.

We stressed of course that none of these topics should be introduced

into the questionnaire unless Mr. Butler was convinced of their suitability for

his immediate purpose as well as for the long-term propaganda aim of his organi

zation.

He stated that our suggestions were entirely proper and, in his opinion,

were reasonable requests that would not arouse the station manager's curiosity.

We pointed out to Mr. Butler that, while information about key personnel and

their political orientation about the station's administrative policies, etc.,

was of prime importance to us, these subjects obviously could not be introduced

into the questionnaire.

He agreed that it would be better to elicit such infor-

mation in another manner, as he had done with dr. Miqueo-Narancio, but because

of his very heavy responsibilities, he did not have time to develop similar

sources of information in each of the other 15 countries.

4.

It occurs to us that you or a possible consumer could assist us by

suggesting other appropriate topics for Mr. Butler's consideration in the revision

of the questionnaire. He shall appreciate whatever help you can give us in this

regard.

5. In the meantime, as soon as all of Mr. Butler's current correspondence

nos been properly filed, ve expect to extract the appropriate information trom

the folders and to present the material in a

series of 00-B reports.
