1. Much has been written about the delay (ly. the Mexico
Station) ins ending the first cable requesting traces on the
name Lee OSWALD. It was discussed in Dave Phillips book as a
case of laziness on the part of the Soviet case officer (which
in ny view was unjust and unnecessary and indicates that Dave
didn't Know what he was’ talking about).

SUBJECT: Review of Mexico City Station Files
at the qWarrenton Record's Center

: 1. On 2 May 1977 Chris Hopkins and Annie Goodpasture
= es visited the (Warrenton) Record's Center to review old Mexico
: : City files in search of additional photographs of the
: "unidentified man". We were unable to locate any such
Cis photographs. It appears that earlier photographs may have
been destroyed in a purge of Mexico City Station files and
that the folders for the destroyed material were re-used to
forward more recent photographic material to Headquarters
: for retention. Following are the Job numbers of boxes reviewed

Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963)

Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTICK) consisted of multi ine
phone taps, three photographic sites, a-mobile surveillance team and a
mail intercept operation.

atte elephone company who was] handled by a Station case officer. The number

of Bines tappéd was limited only by the availability of a listening post

nearby and the availability of Tangauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,
Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-
“3 American recruited agents.
Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer”
: assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station
on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These
operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC
and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-
bassy (across the street) which had both.a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double Taned

street on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).

‘LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental

basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-

* tion received word that the photograph of the “unidentified man” was

being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate Photo-

“graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building

on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site but in-the middle of i
the block south. It hada Planted view of the front gate of the Soviet
Embassy. LICALLA, the third photographic site, was located in one ofa
row of four houses on the south side of the Soviet Embassy compound.
This site overlooked the back garden of the Soviet Embassy compound.’ The
purpose of this operation was to get good identification photographs of
Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed by. a re-
cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother
and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the
LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was. then de-
veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips: LICALLA film was
originally processed in the Station but in early 1959) due to the resig-
nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.
These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents
which used Tate model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team
could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever. someone of
interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of
the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for
identification purposes. ,

Army officers. In 1961, (because of mismanagement by the Mexican—prin=)

Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening
post; and in picking up the transcripts and the tapes. There was also

an American technician inside the listening post.

Soviet lines, three Czech lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav

conversations of interest which were then included in a daily resume
for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,
full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag of a day or ‘two. Reels which contained Russian

iy a language other than Spanish or English were taken to another Tocation
for translation and typing. Mr. Boris Tarasoff did the Russian transla-
tions but because of the volume of ‘Russian conversations, the translations
usually ran about a week behind the date of the conversation. .

As soon as the Station learned that an American identifying him-
self as Lee Oswald phoned the Soviet Embassy, Miss Ann Goodpasture of the
Station started screening all photographs. However, here again, there
was a backlog | because the photographs were picked up three times a week
but those picked up were usually for dates a few days before since the
technician who was processing the film, did so ona _night- time basis.
Further, photographs were not made initially until a complete roll of
film was used. Later this was changed and. the operator cleared the camera
at the end of each day regardless of amount of unused film remaining.

The instructions were to cover the entire work day (office hours) and to

"photograph all Soviets, their families, al] foreigners, and cars with

were conscientious. The Cuban Embassy coverage had more sophisticated

Item 74, page 2

An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy

‘ Consulate at 1037 hours and asks for the Consul. He is told that
the Consul is not there. The unidentified man asked what is needed
to get visas.to go to Odessa.- He is told to call back at.1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

‘At 1235 hours a man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the
Soviet Embassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial

° Item 395, pages 7-and 8 : ; .

Just after 1600 hours, the Soviet Consulate received a.call from the
Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN) who said she had there a U.S. citizen
who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the
USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he’ spoke at-the Soviet Embassy
because she’sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets
approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything
more, advising the (Department of) Iimigration in Cuba. She wants
to know with whom he spoke because he says ‘that he doesn't ‘know
either with what person and who told him that certainly there would
be no problem.’ The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute. After a
short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet. ‘This
Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her name and
someone will return the call. DURAN gives her name and telephone
number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and
: has not, advised them of: a-change ‘of address so will not receive their

7 : Bulletin and can give it to them now. The Soviet asks her to call
KOUKHARENKO in order to change that address and asks for the name
of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache. DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA
whose number is 14-13-26. The Soviet thanks her.
