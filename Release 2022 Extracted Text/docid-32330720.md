the club, WILLS has stated he is going to Reno, Nevada, ~
after January 1, 1968, to work for TOM MOORE at the Holiday
Hotel, Reno,

to winning bettors, but VANSCOY described ROSS BARNES as a
mental case, stating on one occasion ROSS had trouble
locating the address of a customer and had to call back to,
the club four different times to get the address correct.
ROSS BARNES is no longer associated with the bookmaking
operation.

The police dogs used to guard the Penn Club belong to
VANSCOY and are kept on a chain; however, the chain is short
enough that a person can enter the club through the front
door without the dogs getting to him if he is careful. The re
are no windows in the club and those inside have no view out
except through the front door, It has a front and side door,
both re-enforced with 1/4" steel plate. Two phones are in
the club, GR 8-1577 and GR 8-0102. Both VANSCOY and BARNES
answer the phones and accept bets for each other when one of
them is not there. The club is no longer open to the public
in the evenings.
