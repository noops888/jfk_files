” MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 21 November 1978

Doc Ref4D: 44274900

SUBJECT: House Assassination Committee Inquiry

1. On 17 November 1978,:-Mike Smith, GC, and I attended an
interview conducted by staff members of the House Select Committee
on Assassinations in regard to the allegations of Mr, David P.
Christensen concerning the involvement of certain individuals in
the assassination of President Kennedy.

2. The interview was conducted by Messrs Kenneth Klein and
Gary Cornwell and was held in secure spaces provided by Mr, George
Murphy, Director of the Senate National Security Office. Both
individuals are authorized SI access.

-3. The interview was conducted under terms of a Memorand
of Understanding executed between the Committee and OSD on 15
1978 (copy attached).

4. For purposes of the interview, DoD made available Sgt.
Nicholas B. Stevenson, USAF, who.had been stationed with Mr.
Christensen at USA-55, Kirknewton, Scotland, in 1963. sgt.
was accompanied by LTC Jeffrey Graham, USAF, Air Force Legislati
Liaison.

5. The Committee staffers were interested primarily in Sgt.
Stevenson's recollections in regard to events described by Mr.
Christensen in a letter to Stevenson written in May 1978.

6. Sgt. Stevenson briefly described the USA-55 site
mission and confirmed that the Lisbon ink mentioned in
Mr. Christensen's letter could have been intercepted by the site
but, to his knowledge, had not been an assigned target. Regar
the specific allegations made by Mr. Christensén that he had pe
sonally intercepted communications relating to-the President's
assassination, Sgt. Stevenson emphatically stafed that het had no
knowledge of such an event, though in all likelihood, if it had
occurred, it would have been widely known within the station and
the probable subject of a CRITIC. :

7. Mike's and my role in the interview was doneehtrated largely
on interpreting SIGINT jargon and emphasing thé fact that: the aol
mission was and remains properly classified CONFIDENTIAL-. HANDLE VIA
COMINT CHANNELS. 7 :

8. The staffers made no notes and agreed “to let us review their
report, for purposes of classification, on or eee 20 November 1978.

9. The staffe remain particularly interésted in determi

the name of the individual who Mr. Christensen believes relates to
the assassination. They will explore means of determining this
information to include the possibility of having Sgt. Stevenson
call Christensen and ask him for the identity (Stevenson indicated
his extreme unwillingness to do this. LTC Graham stated that this
request would have to be examined at policy level within DoD).

10. If the Committee is able to Getermine a specific name
the staffers indicated that they would probably initiate a speci
inquiry to NSA to again search our materials.
