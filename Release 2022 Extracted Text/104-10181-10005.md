1.:

On 16 January 1969 QUTIMID reported a discussion

between

Subiect and-the-Chief.of the Rumanian Trade. delegation

in Spain, during which the rumanian asked when they could meet:

Subject invited the Rumanian to his home where, he said,

has set up a small office and was beginning to work more at

home than in the office, because of

the added comfort.

wouldn't be surprised if this was suggested by his wife-who

is very jealous of her husband.)

The meeting was arranged

for 1130 hors on 17 January.

AMAUTO-1 commented that he is

up quite early in the morning, presumably to begin work in

his office.:

2.

The above report is the first we have received on

Subject's

use of his

home as an office.

invitation

the Rumanian, of course, casts suspicion on the nature of the

conversation.

3.

Since his move to new quarters, AMAUTO-l's home is

about 50 yards from two WOFIRM staffers - Martin B. CRYMM and

Conrad B. FALAGIARO.

(See attached sketch) ..

Edwin B. RATTEREE

lives approximately 200 yards from the AMAUTO hume.

This

proximity to AMAUTO-l'S home by three staffers brings up the

question of the use of an RF device to monitor conversations.

in ANAUTO's office at home, assuming at this time, that he.

has a phone

in the office,

most likely an extension of the

home. phone:

For planning purposes, we would appreciate from.

NIKNOVA a list of requirements for a target study in the use:

of an

RF

device.

If other means are available for external

penetration of his home we would welcome your suggestions

and comments.

Please

advise us also if the PF device is still

a controlled

item, which cannot be discussed with or released

toliaison. Your earliest reply would be appreciated.

M00r0-1 Discussion of Missiles

•On 10 January 1968, AILUTO-1, in one of his many daily

discussions. with his subordinates, refireted on the international

pusition of his country,

and arong the things he said,

the folloring which may

be of possible interest to audrissces.!

Although part of the discussion was not hürd because of the

inflcction of the speaker, we feel that the jist of

the discussion is clear and understandable.

"We are denonstrating to the wild that cuba..•1s

cavorably disposed to do whatever... (AMAUTO-l begins

to talk against the United States) that when the

Americans have to raise the white flay..: because the

sir'st plane that appears on rdar. Alurol is

speaking excitedly and itis vory

difficult to miderstand

wnch.word but it appears that he is talking about the

positions of missiles in Cuba), Havana, Las Villas and

Camagucy. and that with these nissiles,

the Americans say they are going tu

sia ton coat on anosa, we will one then to

they (Americans) say they are going to invade us, the

first plane that concs to invade.. (AlAViO-l's sub-

ordinate remarked that 15 October

62 marked a point

in international politics, when the Yankees ordered

the Soviets to withdraw their missiles).

• (AMLIUTO-1

injected) "they (the Sovicts) prescuted

them" (the

Cubans) with ten bombs".

2.

Our reason for reporting this fragmentary information is

that AMAUTO-1 might be contirming the presence of offensive nis

siles in Cuba.

On Yonday, 4 December 1967, the day after his arrival,

RUIZ ordered tho Cuban conguls in Barcelona, sevilla and

Vigo to Madrid for a meeting.

The order was couched in torms

of "wanting to scot" them, but after their arrival on

Hednesday, 6. December, all parties settled down to a detailed

meetlög in which primary attention was given to administrative

matters, trade and propaganda.

The lattes two subjects will

be dealt with in separate dispatches.

On the administrative

side, RUIZ Iistened sympathetically to couplaints about low

salaries,

old bulldings and inadequate upersting budgets and

concluded by asking

for a monthly report on receipts and

expenses and a report on the consuls' current needs, thelr

By the end of the week, RUIZ had prepared a report

on the situation he found in the Chancerry and the mission

in general for forwarding to Havang and which bo first

He started by assuring

that he had "found great cooperation among all the

The Cuban nission has certain financial problens

However, the "new economic

Here RUIZ, is presumably referring to the pressure

brought to bear in November. 1967 by Cuban sympathizers in

the Spanish Foreign Office vorking through the Customs and

the Immigration. Office to forçe Cuban exiles to register

with the Cuban consulate and pay the $32.50 fee for a valld

the political and cultural fields.

He"later commented

on thie: tact that Cuba is practically unknown. in Spain,

tand Cubal products are never seen in the local stoics

and that the viewlof Cuba of the average Spanlard has

lie has .continued to discuss the

need for advertising

Cuban products and considered

decorating his office and his home with Cuban items and

furnitüre

so he could show a little bit of Cuba to his

Spanish and forcign contacts.

Another conscquence of

this desire to put Cuba's best foot forward is a certain

harshness in dealing with the shortcomings of his

colleagues

and fellow Cubans outside the mission, calling

in a QUDOZE report of 13 July he was complaining that the

•Cubans seem to have lost:the elegant touch in their

public functions.

3.: RUIZ's attitude toward money follows logically

from his

desire. that Cuba's prestige increase and he is

quite willing to spend money where it will show.

The

Embassy's 6 January reception was an expensive affair,

the Embassy-and .Commercial officers take their Spanish

contacts to the best restaurants,

he and his wife pay

30,000 pesotas (approximately $ 130.00) rent per month

for a house deemed suitable to his position and buy new

clothes without hesitation for the various diplomatic

functions.

Before he went on home leave on 6 August 1968,

he was encouraging his stafi to rent better apartments

that would more nearly match their status as diplomats

and his wifo was looking for a different house for them,

one with fewer maintenance headaches and with rooms large

enough for small receptions of as many as 10 people.

/ All of this

is quite in accord with RUIZ's own bourgoisa

tastes, reflected more than any thing else in his great

RUIZ earns a gross

foreign contacts home for lunch or dinner at any time.

There

is no

indication that he receives a representation

allowance yet he will allow his wife to charge nothing

except

the salaries of two maids to the Embassy and she

can't economize on food when they are alone because he

will go out to a restaurant rather than eat rice and beans.

RUIZ is plainly cautious in his dealings with Havana over

money. even while wanting to live as well as possible

in Madrid. The difference in the couple's manner of

living between Havana

and Madrid must be striking since

RUIZ had i good position in the Ministry of Foreign Commerce

prior to becoming Charge d'Affaires and yet his wife told

vera, the Embassy secretary and her closest friend,

that

she did not have a refrigerator in Cuba and would like

to take one back

with her if they did not return to Madrid

after home leave!

conversations and his consultations over some course

of action as a means of psychological reintorcement.

He has given the impression of being insecure in his

- Rosition and when faced with

an accumulation of

problems in the office prior to home leave, was talking

of resigning

and returning to Cuba.

insecurity

may account

for his touchiness over the way he is

treited by the Spaniards, especially those

in government

positions. He häs been noted describing several of his

interviews with Spanish Ministers or people holding

important government positions at great length, going.

into much

detail on the length of the meeting, if they

shook hands, if the person smiled, if he lad anything

nice to say about Cuba or the Cubans, etc..

addressees know, RUIZ came to his post as a transfer

from

the Ministry of Foreign Commerce.

On numerous

occasions he has said that his life interest is in

commerce and irdustly and prior to his vacation in Cuba,

he was increasingly depressed over his present position

and his ability to fill it, which may account for some

lof this sense of personal uncertainty.

He has seemed

a hard worker and a man with good ideas on the work of

the Embassy and how it should be organized, idcas which

he has repeated endlessly, but he has been unable to

inspire in his subordinates.

In his disputes with

in June he complained about

the lack of team spirit in

the office.

RUIZ's political idens are contered in the Cuban

revolution and the Station considers him as an

unquestioned regime supporter.

RUIZ has had a

sufficient breadth of education and experience to make

a choice, to have reached his own decision that the

Castro regime is good for Cuba and that Marxism as

interpreted by the Cubans

is an adequate intellectual

foundation for life.

A QUDOZE Report ni 13 December 1967

included a discussion with ^ Spanish employce of the

has ever been in the world; that it has different

characteristics and trajectories,

that

in spite of having

a mark of Narxist principles it has many variations

which make it different.

These variations are unknown

even to some of the comrades themselves.

In a QUDOZE

Report of 23 June,

he commented on certain features of

the Cuban system

as "very difficult to understand unless

one is of the left"!.

The QUDOZE Report of 4 July quoted

extensively

in OSMA-24,112 of 9 August 1968 showed

most

clearly RUIZ's view of Cuba and the revolution as

one entity and to see himself within that structue, a

part of it and serving it.

Bejond that, his mind runs

in business and public relations rather than political

channels and he has shown less interest in the policies

than in the power relationships of the men

within the

hierarchy who administer the policies:

He has been

able to avoid sounding doctrinaire in his discussions and

Along

size and aggressive intentions of the NOFIR! organization

iways un the lookout for a "provocation"

even to the extent of refusing to receive an unown

RUIZ seems

to have little time for his wife,

Nilda,

attitude toward

his wife has been quite curt.

He has

mentioned, on at

least two occasions having

"his problems

and that all married couples have problems

they alone can solve, but he has never discussed them.

Nilda, for her part,

in her long conversations with Vera

On 4 July the battle was renewed over

the

distribution of Che's Diary.

At that time the Embassy

only had 6 or 7 copies which were being loaned out on an

overnight basis.

RUIZ said he wanted to send the Diary

"to a mountain of people" while

was also offering

it freely and without consulting RUlz about the action or

his list of ccipients.

RUIZ scolded him roundly for this

and, ignoring

him he had to respect the instructions he received.

tirade, RUIZ even went so far as to

suggest it would be better for onc of them to leave and go

ccording to a QUDOZE Report of lagbruary,

Charge d'Affaires in Madrid,

Cubanssing the war in Vietnam with one of his subordinates

and commented that a Chinese general is driving the North

American command mad. He added that this Chinese says that

they

failed the first time and can fail the

second time but

that in the end the victory will be theirs.

that Vietnam had been at war with the Chinese for thousands

of years, that the Chinese have a demonic power that is their

people.

The nature of the QUDOZE Report does not permit

further amplification of the above information which, even

though fragmentary and obscure,

is being forwarded for

whatever use Headquarters may

wish to make of it.

any clarifying information appear in future QUbOZE reports,

it will be forwarded.

It is interesting to note that,

although Station traces do not show the information,

previous QUDOZE Report quoted RUIZ as saying he had once been

in North Vietnam

as a member of a trade mission.

ANAUTO-T Discussion of Missiles

1.

discussions

On 10 January 1968, ANaUT reflected on the Internattonal

with his

subordinates,

in one of his many: daily

position of his country, and among the things he said, we quote

the following which may be of possible interest to addressees.

Although part

'of the discussion

was not heard because of the

not dose done eat the sues a feel that the fist.or

the discussion is clear and understandable.

"We are demonstrating to the world that Cuba...is

favorably disposed to do whatever... (AMAUTO-1 begins

to talk against the United States) that when the

Americans have to raise the white flag.. because the

first plane that appears on radar... (AHAUTO-1 15

speaking excitedly and itis very

difficult to understand

each word but it appears that he is talking about the

positions of missiles in Cuba), Havana, Las Villas and

canaguey and that with these missiles,

we can cover

Miami, New York, and all their bases and all of their

"mierda".

•.if

the Americans say they are going to

send them (missiles? planes?), we will send

them; if

they (Americans) say they are going to invade us, the

Ill'st plane that comes to invade... (AMAUTO-l's sub-

ordinate remarked that 15 October

62 marked a point

in international politics, when the Yankees ordered

the. Soviets to withdraw

their missiles). • •(AMAUTO-1

injected) "they (the Soviets) presented

them (the

Cubans) with ten bombs".

2.

Our reason for reporting this fragmentary information is

that AMAUTO-1 might be confirming the presence of offensive nis-

siles in Cuba.

JAN 30 19631. When Guillermo RUIZ Perez, the new Cuban Charge met

with the Cuban consuls following his arrival in Spain, the

Due mc five o instate mater roar areasandavas

subject of propaganda will be dealt with in this dispatch.

2.

The Castro regime has always attached great

importance to propaganda activities of all kinds and when the

new Cuban Charge d'Affaires began to re-organize the work of

his subordinates, propaganda matters were not overlooked.

According to the QUDOZE and QUTIMID operatioN types of

provincial consulates have been receiving four

propaganda for distribution,

two of which were identified.

One was the propaganda put out by the organizations created

by the Castro regime,

for example "The Voice of Vietnam".

The other is newspapers.

PACHECO, Consul in Sevilla,

mentioned Granma,

he claimed many people read,

added that lately he had been receiving Juventude Rebelde.

RUIZ's ideas apparently go beyond hand-shaking and

the distribution of propaganda.

He asked the consuls to

make & list of all the institutes and all the scientific

centers in their territories including the special positions

of these centers and any other relevant information.

are to use these lists to develop a systematic work

of visiting each one, making friends,

trying to obtain

scholarships for Cuba, trying to obtain publications and

propaganda of every type, free if possible or by subscription

if necessary.

The consuls were told to go with the attitude

of

"looting"

4.

Even while he was lajing these responsibilities

. on his

consuls, RuIz was busy within the Embassy.

In

discussions

with

, il Spanis, inpioyce wic

works on culturnl matters. and is

responsible for publication

of the Embassy

bulletin,

RUIZ mentioned

that he is

interested

in offering Cuban documentaries to Spanish Cine

(Movie) Clubs as they now have a large number,

"an infinity",

of documentaries showing both Cuban technical

application

and how the people live.

RUIz also asked to see conies of

the Embassy bulletin and in the meantime suggested

do a bullciin drawing a parallel between Gibralter and

Guantanamo.

Finallv. according to a QUDOZE report of

11 December 1967,

had been ordered

to propare a work plan for cultural activity.

In this

context

cultural activity is not ilmited to art, music and

literature but also includes public information media. The

Cuban Embassy has already built up a series of press contacts

over the past jears and

the 'Cuban Revolution seems to draw

a ready response in Spanish intellectual circles as

cvidenced by the Spanish delcgates attending the Cultural

Congress held in

Havana from 4-ll January 1968.

An expense-

paid trip is always attractive to be sure but the delegates,

many of whom

were not communists, were

also, sympathetic to

the host.

Accordingly, within the limits imposed by the

Spanish

government, Station Madrid expects an increase in

the

propaganda and political action activities of the Cuban

official establishment.

CALZADILLA, RUIZ's predecessor häd not been a strong

administrator and

had let the various components of the

Cuban official establishment in Spain run their own affairs.

This fact plus the inevitable tendency of a new chief to be

"new broom" and rearrange things according to his own

led Station Madrid to expect some changes particularly

the Embassy.

the QUDOZE and QUTINID operations

have shown RUIZ at

least initially to be an aggressive and

well organized individual with ideas of his own that clearly

reflect his background in commercial affairs and prepared to

make changes that promise to go beyond the superficial

swreping of a new broom.

Underlying RUIZ's actions and

proposals is the clear implication that he came to Madrid

with the specific task of upgrading the Cuban mission in

Spain both in terms of prestige and effectiveness.

Madrid will transmit to the addressees the relevant

information on this program as it becomes available from the

and QUTIMID operations along with information on the

official Cuban personalities administering the program.

A striking difference between RUIZ and his

predecessor was noted in the QUDOZE and QUTINID reports of

that first week.

RUIZ has no inhibitions over spending

the Enbassy cars, a Peugeot was replaced with

a new model and there was discussion of replacing the other

two Peugeots with new ones.

Nilda, RUIZ's wife, was picked

The new Ambassador concluded his report with three

recommendations:

Reit another building where. the Chancillary,

the Commercial Office,

the Consulate and the

Cubana Offices can all be housed instead

of

being dispersed in separate buildings as they

are now;

b.

Rent or preferably buy a residence for the Chief

of Mission.

The one they now have is not

adequate;

c.

Send another person from Cuba who has the.

background to take care of scientific work plus

continuing the contacts the Mission will have

already made.

In view of RUIz's previous

statement on the completeness of the staff, such

a person

would likely be a

"nön-official"

representative of one of Cuba's cultural fronts

such as the Casa de las Americas.

RUIZ concluded his remarks by saying that in Spain

there

is a tremendous
