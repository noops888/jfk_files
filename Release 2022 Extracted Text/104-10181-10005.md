‘wouldn't be surprised if this was. suggested by his wife-who ©

for 1130 hours on 17 January. AMAUTO-1 commented that he is

Conrad B. FALAGIARO. (See attached sketch). Edwin B. RATTEREE
lives: approximately 200 yards ‘from the AMAUTO hume. This
proximity to AMAUTO-1's home by three staffers brings up the

-In the four month period since the forwarding of ref B, . |
the’ QUDOZE “and ‘QUT IMID Operations ‘have continued. to provide insights
into the program of the PBRUWEN official establishment in Spain, the
requirements" laid-on it and the-evolution in the thinking of
AMAUTO=1 dnd his staff as they vork toward expanding their contacts
and influence in the. politi¢sl, ecoromic and cultural-propaganda
ficlds; These developuents ¥i!1 provide the subject matter for
subsequent dispatches, Hovéver, in addition to such conventional -
“public relations"; ‘the QUDQZ® Reports have recently carried evi=
dence of MEGUILE activity, .Decause euch activity automatically
means PBHUMEN involvément in Spain's internal affairs, QUOTA has
tsken an even greater than usual: interest in these developments,
Translations of the transcripts detailing this inforaation are given

below,

3. The-earliest and certainly the most striking MHGUILE in-
formation was forvarded under ref A describing AMAUTO-1's advice
to AMADIEU=1' on the techniques of living a clandestize life, on
the use of disguise and on the pecessity for good organization for
“with. bad organization we are*lost". Then, a QUDOZS Report of
30 April 68 summarized a discussion on the lack of personrel in
.-th@-Enbassy to make scientific and technical contacts, at which

ime AMAUTO-1 digressed into describing the cover for's new seuber
of the staff whom he apparently expected to arrive in the near,
future, -what is lacking is a comrade who could take care
of the cultural and apparently the technical aspect also, who
could also ascertain who are the Awericans, their addresses, in
what streets are located their...." He adds that this comrade will
have to move about, to make contacts, to be up on everything, and
if time remains to do other things. He added that he rewenbers the
President (of PBRUMEN) gave much importance. to this as 4 matter of
honor for all the missions abroad, We repeated that the technical
aspect (i.e.collecting technical information) required a coarsde, ao

3. Folloving ‘the returé ‘6f AMADRIFT-1 onthe 7th of March €8,
via PBRUMEN national flight, after hone leave in PBRUMEN, the QUDOZi
Bator reported extensive .convers: tions’ between AUADRIFT=-1 and |
on future Plans. Two were of MHEGUILE interest

SAS QUDOZE ‘Rport of az. March 68, AMAUTO-1 5: a, "this ig...
in@rican movément-in Spain-and with the monopoly
that they have here”, He saya,°"In ay judgement our
in-Spiin from the political potat of
view is to ascertain whit there.{s behind all this, what
there here, wé must get ourselves in notion", "That is a
-very “inportant point for us, to ascertain what are their
namés, who are those who are. here, how they (the Americans’
are moving". ‘He adds tiat, "If-we are able to find out, w
will be able to stop then. coupletely.”

B.. QUDOZE Report uf 14 Mar 68. AMAUTO-1 says that they have
to find out "what are the forces in Spain, with the pos-
sibility of our having access (to. thea)", He comments that
Spain, 16’at'a crossroads internally and externally. - He
gays they have to find out what 46 happening in Spain,
whether they give the workers liberty to strike, etc.

He again repeats all they have to fiud out, mentions find-
ing out "who are the eonarchists, what forces they repre-
sent, to what forces are they imited. who are the elements |
that are being financed by the American |
Embassy", "Which @ those scattered elements that the
newspaper of the Movement has accused of being backed by
the Anerican Embassy, vhat financial power do they have?" "|

4. AMAUTO-1 had apparently set great hope on the 1 May 68
anti-government demonstration by vorkers and students which, 03
Headquarters is-aware, the police effectively handled.’ In a 2
May QUDOZE Report, AHAUTO-1 repeatedly commented on what a tremen-
dous failure the demonstration had been; be kept asking AMADRIFT-1 _
what had happened, why the Spanish people had not responded, why
the workers had not, and finally said !"The next demonstration ve
are going to same here a member of the Enbassy".

Ation of his country, and among the things he said, we quote
Jiewing which may be of possible interest to addressees. |
Although part of the discussion was not heard because of the
enotional inflection of the speaker, we feel that the jist of
the discussion. is: clear and understandable,

“We are demonstrating to the world that Cuba,,.is |

to talk against the United States) that when the
Americans have to raise the white fla..,because the

speaking excitedly and itis very difficult to widerstand
cach word but it appears that he is talking about the |
positions of missiles in Cuba), Havana, Las Villas and
Camagucy and that with these nissiles, we can cover

. Miami, New York, and all their bases, and all of their
"mierda", . .4f the Americans say they are going to
sad thom (missiles? planes?), we will send then; if
they (Americans) say they are yoing to dnvace us, the
first plane that comes to invade.,,(AMAUIO-1's sub-
ordinate remarked that 15 October 62 marked a point
in international politics, when the Yankees ordered
the Soviets to withdraw their missiles). . .(AM\UIO-1
injected) "they (the Sovicts) presented them (the

Cubans) with ten bombs",

side, RUIZ listened sympathetically to complaints about low
salaries, old buildings ahd inadequate operating budgets and
concluded by asking for a monthly report on receipts and
expenses aod a-report on the.consuls’ current needs, their
monthly balances and their administrative activities. The
printing and telephone bills wero the two items of expense
that kept recurring throughout the discussions,

4, By the end of the week, RUIZ had prepared a report
on the situation he found in the Chancerry and the mission
in.general for forwarding to Havana and which he first
discussed vith his subordinates, He started by assuring
them that he had "found great co-operation among all the
comrades in this mission" and declared that the staff was

complete. parent 1: RUIZ intends to make no personnel
changes and who had previously beén
mostveager to returo oO Vana, now has gone to Havana
on vacation, He left Madrid on the 20 December 1967 Iberia
flight. :

5, The Cuban mission has certain financial problems
since the present budget dates from previous yee’s and does
not cover current expenses, However, the “new economic
activities of the consulate" are expected to assist with the
: problem, Here RUIZ is presumably referring to the pressure
; brought to bear in November. 1967 by Cuban sympathizers in
H the Spanish Foreign Office working through the Customs and
t the Immigration. Office to force Cuban exiles to register
I with the Cuban consulate and pay the $22.50 fee for a valid
: passport. Enough exiles have responced to this pressure to
| relieve gome of the financial problems of the Cuban mission.
. - hia source of income will last'as long as the Cubans’ friends
in the Foreign Ministry are able to assist them.

6. The reception of Cuban official travelers at the
_airport and the handling of Embassy pouches poses a
continuing adrinistrative problem for the Embassy, Jose
DIAZ Puga, who is in charge of this airport work has to
devote himself exclusivaly to taking care of the courters
and their pouches when any come in, leaving visitors to fend
for themselves, This situation has been alleviated by
other Embassy Staff menbers jaunting out to the airport at
will to meet the incoming planes. Now, RUIZ has declared
‘that the rest of the staff must stay in the Embassy because
ie they have a work plan to fulfill, Thus, he has leit himself

with an uiresolved problen he’ must face in the very near

future.. =

material has revealed various facets of his personality,
showing him.to be a man of volatile temper, an incessant

or useful from that exterior world, Thus, during his

reduced to a very narrow circle and Since Cuba was "in"
economi: ly it was now Necessary to give attention to
the political aid cultural fields, le-later commented
on tle. fact. that-Cuba is practically unknown in Spain,
tit Cuban products are: never seen in the local -stores
and that ‘the view lof Cuba of the average Spaniard has
‘cone fran ‘the éxiles. tle has continued: to discuss the
need for advertising Cuban products and considered
decerating his office and his home with Cuban items and
furnitire so he could show a little bit of Cuba to his
Spanish..and foreign contacts. Another consequence of
this desire to put Cuba's best foot forward te a certain
harshness 1n dealing with the shortcomings of his -
colleagucs and fellow Cubans outside the mission, calling
Z tion to any ‘deficiencies in their conduct and ways
uling withthe persons they meet; As recently ag

An ‘a’ QUDOZE ‘report ‘of 13 July he was complaining that the

Cubans ‘sdem, to'have lost -the elegant touch in their

public functions, :

3.-.RUIZ's attitude toward money follows logically
from his desire. that’ Cuba's prestige increase and he is
quite willing’ to spend money where it will show. The
Embassy's 6 January. reception was an expensive affair,
the Embassy and ‘Commercial officers take their Spanish
Sonsacts to the best restaurants, he and his wife pay
30,000 pesetas (approximately $ 430,00) rent per month
for a Nouse deemed suitable to his position und buy new
clothes without ‘hositation for tae various diplomatic
functions.“ Before- he went on home Ieave on 6 August 1968,
he. was encouraging his staff to rent better apartments
that would more nearly match their status as diplomats
and his wifo was looking for a different house foe them, :
one with fewer maintenance headaches and with rooms large we
» penoush for sfiall receptions of as many as 40 People, 7
Fall of. this is quite in accord with RUIZ's own hourgdis&
i tastés,- reflected more than any thing elge-in his great
nterest tn clothes and in being well dressed. Yet the
Cuban mission operates on a slim budget and the salaries
are Rot high. Station Madrid has no information on
whether Cuban mission personnel receive a housing
allowince but assumes they must as otherwise RUIZ, at
least, could never make cnds meot. RUIZ earns a gross
salary of $681.50 per month and all his living expenses
including clothes, food, medical expenses, education for
the couple's 5 children and perhaps utilities must come
from this sum. RUIZ also expects to be able’to invite
Cuban officiils transiting Madrid and his Spanish and
foreign contacts home for lunch or dinner at any time.
There is no indication that he receives a representation
allowance yet he will allow his wife to charge nothing
except the Salaries of two maids to the Embassy and she
can't economize on food when they are alone because he
will go out to a restaurant rather than eat rice and “beans,
RUIZ is plainly ‘cautious tn his dealings w:th Havana over
Toney oven while wanting to live as well as possible
in Madrid. The difference in the couple's manner of
Jiving between Havana and Madrid must be striking since
RUIZ hada good position in the Ministry of Foreign Commerce
prior to becoming Charge d'Affaires and yet his wife told
Vera, the Embassy secretary and her closest friend, that
she did not have a refrigerator in Cuba and would dike
to take one back with her if they did not return to Madrid

after home leave!

4, As an individual, RUIZ has Appear

doin
QUDOZE/QUTIMID as nervous, sapricious, qu

k tempered.

In contrast to his pleasant” public appearance and “his
usually acceptable telephone language, bis private

tion is vulgar, low and full of ugly words.
'S Cont hidally~and" flies “off into. rages. ile 4s
a Compulsive talker and Apparently uses his long,
conversations-and his consultations over some course
of action as a means of’ psychological reinforcement.
He has given the impression of being insecure in his
-position and when faced with an accumulation Of "~~
problems in the office prior to home leave, was talking
of resigning: and returning to Cuba, This insecurity
may. account: for his touchiness over the way he is .-
treated by the Spaniards, especially those in government
positions.” “He has been noted describing several of his
interviews with Spanish Ministers or people holding
important government positions at great length, going”
into much detail on the length of the meeting, if they
“shook hands,. if the person smiled, if he liad anything
nice to sdy-about Cuba or ‘the Cubans, etc. As the
addressees know, RUIZ came to his post as a. transfer
from thé Ministry of Foreign Commerce. On numerous
occasions he has’ said that his life interest is in
commerce and industry and prior. to his vacation in Cuba;
he was increasingly depressed over his present position
and his ability to fill it, which may account for some
of this sense of personal uncertainty. He has scemed
a hard worker and a man with good ideas on the work of
the ‘Embassy and how it should be organized, ideas which
he has repeated endlessly, but he has been unable to
inspire in his subordinates. In his disputes with) |
in June he complained about the lack of team spirit in
the office, Sree

§. RUIZ's political ideas are centered in the Cuban

revolution and the Station considers him as an
4nquestioned regime supporter.. However, his approach

is different tren that of the younger, less. intelligent
,men who-have known nothing else, RUIZ has had ‘a

; Sufficient breadth of education and experience to make

a choice, to have reached his own decision that the
Castro regime is good for Cuba and that Marxism as
interpreted by the Cubans is an adequate intellectual
foundation for life. A QUDOZE Report of 13 December 1967
included a discussion with a Spanish employce of the
Embassy during which RUIZ explained that the Cuban
revolution is different ‘from any other revolution there
has ever-been in the world, that it has different
characteristics and trajectories, that in spite of having
a mark of Marxist principles it has many. variations

which make it different. ‘These variations are unknown
even to some of the comrades themselves. In a QUDOZE
Report of 23 June, he commented on certain features of
the Cuban systeim as "very difficult to understand unless
one is of the left". ‘The QUDOZE Report of 4 July quoted
extensively in OSMA-24,112 of 9 August 1968 showed

most clearly RUIZ's view of Cuba and the revolution as
one entity and to sce himsel hi tstructure, a
part of it and serving Beyond » his mind runs

in business and public relations -rather than political
channels and he has shown less interest in the policics

d'affaires of the Cuban Embassy in Madrid and his first
Secretary, As so often happens in
human relations, less important issues proved the vehicle
for expressing deeper conflicts and problems, In this
case, the primary problem can be simply summarized, The
members 6f RUIZ's staff operate independently of their

his subordinates tol nna Phe spect This is particularly

subordinates should back him by taking the same positions
in public that he takes, a not unreasonable demand on

the part_of a Chicf of Mission, RUIZ bluntly told
that he, had_c: ed an error.and just as

bluntly. disagreed. view was that had come in
ina bad hunor and nothing Pleased him whereas RUIZ felt
should try putting himself in RUIZ's place, something
he: claims is incapable of doing. Finally, this
particular argument ende. forin of compromise with
agreeing to call the following day and remind

[him that- he “should call the Minister",

3. On -4 July, the battle was renewed over the
distribution of Che's Diary. At that time the Embassy
only had 6 or 7 copics. which were being loaned out on an
overnight basis, RUIZ said he wanted to send the Diary
"to a mountain of people" while was also offering

- -it freely and without consulting about. the action or
: -.: his list of recipients, RUIZ scolded him roundly for this
and,. ignoring attempts at self-justification, told
him’he had to respect the instructions he received, At
one point in his tirade, RUIZ even went so far as to
suggest it would be better for one of them to leave and go
to work in another country, for example Rumania. Several
interesting items emerged from this’ long quarrel: :

roach to his. fellow workers
Yeeveryone knows. the ‘problem |

“know of the problem...
importance of discussing problems ‘among the comrades
and said "for example in your case, you have been

foolish in not outlining the problem, I was waiting

and [was waiting and

B, RUIZ commented that now he can understand
the attitude of CALZADILLA, Before, he had thought
CALZADILLA was in error but: now he feels the same way.
He. mentions "an ambivalence" and says he will not iz

sreact the same way, "that CALZADILLA. was: wrong in - -.
i. “persons: whereas:

hy. everyone,. not

just 1 a “foe

- Cy RUIZ-takes.a-broader. view .of..Party membership
than his contemporaries.’ In commenting on the weekly
study circle for members of the Party, he set forth
his opinion that all the comrades of the local Cuban
Mission should participate even though they may not
be members because in his eyes it is as if they all
really were members,

D. RUIZ repeated a statement he has made on
previous occasions ~ the great interest of his life
is foreign commerce, However, in this 4 July QUDOZE
Report, he added the interesting detail that he had
not wanted to come to Madrid as Charge and, in affect,
had been persuaded to come against his will, He
believes he is best able to serve in the control of
- intustry and that is where he could perform a
mendous work for his country 2s every revolutionary

ought to be in the place of work where he is able
to do the mast, "Until now, I have always done }

‘
and have always gone where the revolution sent me...
with my present limitation of criteria, [ should i
not "be here”. He repeated his conviction that-he 4
is wasting his talents and doing ncthing for Cuba

in, the position of Charge in‘ comparison with what

he could do elsewhere, "I believe that with which

I am best able to serve my country.ds in the

control of industry...I. put myself in an industry

and I see if things are being done well or if they
are being done badly because I have knowledge and
because. I arrive at. my conclusions through the
accounting,..look, here I am wasting my presence

and my resources when I am able to be useful to
Production in another position,”

By the-end: of this 4 July report, RUIZ had exhdusted all
his combativeness and appeared very. depressed,

24. RUIZ‘is due for home leave in Havana the first
Part of August... There have been indications scattered
throughout the QUDOZE and QUTIMID Reports of the last
month or two that he might not return, The information

“AMAUTO-I Discussion of Missiles

macro

P ‘ = : ee
2. On. 10 January 1968, AMAUTO-1, in one of his -many: daily
discussions with his subordinates, reflected on the international
position of his country,,and among the things he said, we quote
the folloving which may :be“of possible interest to addressees,
Although part of the discussion was’ not heard because of the
emotional inflection of the’ speaker, we feel that the jist of
the-discussion 48 clear and understandable. 3

“We are demonstrating to the world that Cuba...4s
favorably ‘disposed to’ do whatever... (AMAUTO-1 begins
to talk against the United States) that when the
Americans have to raise the whité flag.,.because the
first. plane that appears on radar... (ANAUTO-1 is
speaking excitedly and itis very difficult to understand
each word but it appears that he is talking about the
positions of missiles in Cuba), Havana, Las Villas and
Camaguey and:that with these missiles, we can cover
Miami, New York, ‘and all their bases and all of their
"mierda", . .if the Americans say they are going to
sad them (missiles? planes?), we will send them; if
they (Americans) say they are going to invade us, the
first plane that comes to invade... (AMAUTO-1's sub-
ordinaté remarked that 15 October 62 marked a point

in international politics, when the Yankees ordered
the. Soviets to withdraw their missiles), . .(AMAUTO-1
injectéd) "they (the Soviets) presented them (the
Cubans) with ten bombs",

2, Our reason for reporting this fragmentary information is
that AMAUTO-1 might be confirming the presence of offensive tis~

siles in Cuba,

"By. OSMA-23,406 of 12 January 1968 2<-- Prra¢e

When Guillermo RUIZ Perez, the new Cuban Charge met

Doc. wici,With tHe Cuban consuls following his arrival in Spain, the

Suit fwas a long meeting at which primary attention was- -
given to administrative matters, trade and propaganda, The
subject. Of propaganda will be dealt with in this dispatch,

2. The:Castro regime has always attached great
importance to propaganda activities of all kinds and when the
new Cuvan Charge d'affaires began to re-organize the work of
his subordinates, propaganda matters were not overlooked,
According to the QUDOZE and QUTIMID operations, the
provincial consulates have been receiving four types of
propaganda for distribution, two of which were identified.
One was the propaganda put out by the organizations created
by the Castro regime, for example "The Voice of Vietnam".
The other is newspapers, PACHECO, Consul in Sevilla,
mentioned Granma, which he claimed many people read, and
added that Yately he had been receiving Juventude Rebelde,

3, RUIZ's ideas apparently go beyond hand-shaking and
the distribution of propaganda, He asked the consuls to
make a list of all the institutes and all the scientific
centers in their territories including the special positions
of these centers and any other relevant information, They
are to use these lists to develop a systematic work plan
of visiting each one, making friends, trying to obtain
scholarships for Cuba, trying to obtain publications and
propaganda of every type, free if possible or by subscription

to prepare’a work plan: for cultural activity. In this
context cultural activity is not limited to~art;—music and
literature but ‘also includes public information media. The
Cuban’ Embassy ‘has already built up a series of press contacts
over the past years and the Cuban Revolution seems to draw
a ready response in Spanish intellectual circles as
evidenced by the Spanish deicgates attending the Cultural
Congréss held ‘in Havana from 4-11 January 1968, An expense- ~
paid trip is always attractive to be sure but the delegates,
many of whom were not communists, were also,sympathetic to
the host, Accordingly, within the limits imposed by the
Spanish government, Station Madrid expects an increase in
the propaganda and political action activities, ofthe Cuban

in Madrid

1, The new Cuban Ambassador to Spain, Orestes
Guillermo RUIZ.Perez arrived in Madrid onthe Iberia flight
of 3 December'1967 accompanied by. his wife, Nilda, and three
sons, CALZADILLA, RUIZ's predecessor Nad not .been a strong ©

administrator and had let the various components of the :
Cuban, official establishment in Spain run their own affairs,
This fact plus the inevitable tendency of a new chief to be

a "new broom" and rearrange things according to his own
lights, led Station Madrid to expect some ‘changes particularly
within the Embassy, However, the QUDOZE and QUTIMID operations

“have shown RUIZ at least initially to be an aggressive and
well organized individual with ideas of his own that clearly
reflect his background in commercial affairs and prepared to
make changes that promise to go beyond the superficial
sweeping of a new broom, Underlying RUIZ's actions and
proposals is the clear implication that he came to Madrid
with the specific task of upgrading the Cuban mission in
Spain both in terms of prestige and effectiveness, Station
Madrid will transmit to the addressees the relevant
information on this program as it becomes available from the
QUDOZE and QUTIMID operations along with information on the
official Cuban personalities administering the program,

2,. A striking difference between RUIZ and his
predecessor was noted in, the’ QUDOZE and QUTIMID reports of
that first week, RUIZ has no inhibitions over spending
money, Onc of the Enbassy cars, a Peugeot was replaced with:
a new model and there was discussion of replacing the other
two Peugeots with new ones, Nilda, RUIZ's wife, was picked
up by the wife of who turned $200 over to her to go
shopping at the Corte Inglesa, one of Madrid's two best

side, RUIZ listened sympathetically to, complaints about low

concluded by asking for a monthly report on receipts and
expenses and a report on the consuls’ cursent needs, their
monthly balances and their administrative activities.. The
printing and telephone bills were the two items of expense
that kept recurring throughout the discussions.

a, In August 1963, RUIZ was appointed Cuban Commercial
Counsellor at Mexico City, and was believed to be a G-2 official
attersting to infiltrate-counterrevolutionary groups based in,
Mexico. (UFGA-11065, dated 16 September 1963, and UFGA-11445,
dated 23 September 1963.)

b. In 1964 an attempt was made to establish com-

. Munications with RUIZ through Antonio VECIANA, an uncle of RUIZ'
wife, VECIANA stated that neither he nor meabers-of his family
were in correspondence with RUIZ, and that he was unwilling to act
as a "go-between," (UFGA-19006, dated 21 Dece=ber 1964.)

c, A Headquarters'"WATCHLIST" card, dated 1 June 1965,
indicates that RUIZ was believed to be assigned to the General
