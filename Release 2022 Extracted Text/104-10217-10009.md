Corwin encountered Feodor Alexeivite! ANIN, a firat secretary
of the Soviet Legation. Corwin had met CARANIN once before at

qi@ cocktail party given by H. Bartlett Yells, American First
w Secretary. Cn this cecasion (at the Argentinian party) Corwin

greeted the Russian with "How do you do, Xr. Caranin."” The

» latter replied and enswered in turn, "How do you do, Kr. Cor- |

win," using the latter's true name, of course. Garanin said, |

- "You have a good cexory," whereupon Corwin replied, "ly memo-

ry is almost as ¢cecd as yours." Garanin smiled and that ended

the incident for the moment. ‘i .

2. Later, in searching for his wife, Corwin fuund her

engaged in conversation with Garanin. Corwin joined the group

and chatted for a minute. Caranin then seta that "we must have

lunch one of these days." Corwin indicated his willingness to

this. At that point he introduced Garanin to Lt. Col. Howard

Van De Car, United States Air Attacne. Garanin said that he

knew Col. Van De Car but Van De Car later told Corwin that he

could not recall ever having met Garanin before. Shoruty after +
this Garanin excused himself but told Corwin that he would re-

; Aurn to the subject later. It will be interesting to see.whe-

rs / ther he makes any further contact.

7 3. The next Gay it was learned that Garanin had also en=
if Gagea Fred Hajjar, Assistant Attache in tne corzercial section

exhibited a short temper on occasions with wells and reportedly
lost his temper completely during a meeting with Kr. AsR.xSLLAS,
forcer British First Secretary. On this occasion Garanin had
needled Kellas in a fairly rough fashion. Kellas had replied
in kind, and Garanin had lust his temper and left. 4

5. Garanin speaks fairly good English. Martchouk does not
speak Englasu but, according to ells, speaks French. It is not
believed that Garenin's expressed desire to have lunch with Cor-
win has any special significance as such, particularly in light
of his similar approach to Hajjar. It is interesting tuo note,
however, tnat Garanin is currently anpearing in such a friendly
fashion despite the Soviet Union's dissatisraction witn our
PoLicy in Germany. Hee
