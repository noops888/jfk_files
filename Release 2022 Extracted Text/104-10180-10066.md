Conzentas
U Ona could prebably and perhsrs preperly IFER thit Jose is
2 Castro agent, but aside fron the episode dealing with his release,
at the benest of Thelna King, and the rerort that he carried
with hin,after his release fron prison, 160 scholarshipsf which
arpe-rs to have sone sisnificance, there is no conclusive evidence
pointing toward Jose's involvenent,ia fast or present, with Castro's
security apparat.
__There 16, hovever, considerably nore evidence that he is not
an agent of Castros For examples
"1, He nas fought against Castro and was ixprisoned by hin.
+2. tiet le has reportedly denounced Thelna King openly.
3. Dat, he does not get along with his brother Jorge, who
is tied in with Pinfero. :
4, He has broadeastéd anti-Castro and anti-Batista
Propaganda fron Radio CIENMIL, a pananahian station.
5. Saat: necig anticcastro, Anii-Conmunist and pro-
democratic ‘and that his actions, according to Jose,
since 1953 should speax for thenselves, including
his actions and propaganda work against Castro since

his arrival in the United St-tes.

I don't d--Lieve I'm that naive to think that Jose's
actions to date coula not be part of a pre-arranged plan, but
the evidence available points in the other direction,
I do surpest GSH to possible alternatives, the first of which
I prefer:
1. Apprise Ray of this infermaticn and let hin determine
Puente's bona fides; caution him to be cisereet with his future plans

2. Int us determine PitNTE's boan fides by re-tracirg,
