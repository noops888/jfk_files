1. 00 15 Novenber 1960/QUANTUM/30) gave the Station a copy of the

report, forvarded under separate cover, which was made by the two Spanish
AS Governnent representatives sent to Miami in late October to meet with ~~

‘Fepresentatives of anti-castro exile groups there. Their main contact vas
with Manuel ARTIME Buesa, leader of the Movimiento de Resuperacion
Revolucionaria (MRR). ‘the report deals with the Zormation and status of.
the Cuban resistance groups and alleged degree of ODYOKE cooperation and
support of their activities.

2. Hesdquarters attention is called to those portions of the report
@ealing with ODYOXE support of the Frente Revolucionario Democratico (FRD),
8 confederation formed Initially of five rewIntiomary erems onerating ont
of Miami. In relating the tory of ARTIMS, former leader the
Agrupacion Catolica Universitaria (ACU) and one-time comba: it~ in the
Castro revolutionary army, the report claims that when ARTIME became
@isaffected from Castro, he was approached by an "ODYOKR information
service" and taken Miami where he was pressured tc join the FRD.

ODYOKE plans, the (QUANTUM) representatives vere told, envision ARTIME as
the political-military leader of the future liberation of Cuba and
Fhotogrephs of him have been prepared for vorld-wide distribution to
popularize him as the liberation leader when the uprising against Castro |

3+ ObYOKE aid and instructiany Yor resistance groups inside cuba

are filtered through one “Francieco,” former ACU menber and close friend

and collaborator of ARTINE who acts as the coordinator of clandestine

FRD operations in Cuba. ‘the(@ representatives examined a report,

received in Miami ir early Hovember, which was sent by "Francisco"

and vhich ortlined bis plans for resistance operations. ‘he report.was

subaitted for the approval of ODYOKE personnel working with the Cubans.

kh. ‘the report also states that ODYOKE has conditioned its support.
‘to Cuban resistance grours on their channeling their activities through
the FRD. Secret training camps, set up by ODYOKE, presumably in Guatemala
and other countries in the Caribbean area, have been operating for the
past six nonths and already approximately 1,000 Cubans have received
training to take part in the principal invasion forces. Persons trained
in subversion have been infiltrated into Cuba from these camps. Pilots
have been trained to mn an air force which now numbers approximately
80 modern ODYOXE planes. As reinforcements ODYOKE has also trained
5,000 or 6,000 Puerto Ricans, who, disguised as Cubans, will take part
in the invasion. Quce the invasion takes place, the report. continues,
ODYOKE has pronised to supply the invaders with the materials necessary
to maintain its impetus. If the Commnist-bloc should provide massive a
support to Castro, the ODYOKE officials in contact with the Cuban Z
resistance groups have implied that ODYOKE would openly intervene. .

5. the military commander of the invasion operations is a Cuban
army colonel, but de fecto direction lies with an ODYOKE general staff -
“which oversees the operations plans and will signal the time for them
to be implemented. :
