MIs US ITEVS OF INTEREST IN BAUTZEN (ROZ).

BG Source olaimed to be unable to give any information concerning
FRENCH defectors in BAUTZEN and the DDR. She stated that they are
unpopular with,and distrusted by,the other defectors in BAUTZEN.

2. Source could give no new information concerning the GERMAN
staff of the Club-house. She thought it possible that Wolfgang
NOACK ‘and not SCHATTEL is the real power at the Club-house. ,

3. Source did not think that the defector colony in BAUTZEN will
be disbanded by the DDR authorities, Her reasons were that if thia
were done there would be no place where defectors could be schooled
nor would it be so easy to observe their activities and to place
restrictions on their movements.

4. Source claimed to have no knowledge of any agent or escape
organisations in BAUTZEN, She also clained to have no knowledge
concerning the organisation of the FDJ, stating that she had never
been politically active and had only visited the club-house in the
company of her husband and purely for social entertainnent.

5 On.1 Oct 57 the BAUTZEN edition of the 'SUchsische Zeitung!
published the following article on the back page.

“By bus to BERLIN. We have been informed by the Traffic Office
. that, in accordance with the wishes of many citizens, a long-
distance service BAUTZEN to BERLIN and return is being
introduced wef 8 Oct 57. This has become possible as the.
Traffic Office have received a confortablely-fitted 1IKARUS!
from the friendly Peoples! Republic of HUNGARY. This service
will run twice a week, on Tuesdays and Fridays. Time of
departure 0500 hours from Platz der Roten Armee, arriving in
BERLIN, Alexanderplatz at 0900 hours. The return journey
is.from Alexanderplats at 1800 hours, arriving in BAUTZEN at-
2200 hours. The price of a return ticket is only 32.60 2M."

As Mrs ROBERTS had visited BERLIN by this tus service (para 7
oe this report refers) she was questioned about the checks ‘which are
made on the passengers. A prospective passenger mst first go to
the Traffic Office, if there is 2 seat available this is booked and
paid for. It my be necessary to wait for some time if no seat is
immediately available, The name of the passenger and identity card
number is entered on a list. There is no check of passengers on the
bus before it leaves BAUTZEN or BERLIN. “ There is an identity card
check of-all passengers by she VOLKSPOLIZEI when the bus reaches the
outskirts of BERLIN on both the inward and outward journies.

6. No further information was available. : of

al Attached at Annexures I and II are typed reproductions of
} two.letters written -by subject ond Margot GOTTSCHALK (girl-friend of
DOWNIE) to Erich GOTTSCHALK (living at BERLIN-SPANDAU, Schtnwalder=
Allee, 63), the brother of the girl. The envelope was postmarked
'BAUTZEN 27 Nov 57!. ,Two photostat copies of the letters. are
sleo-attached for distribution as you may deem necessary; it is
regretted that, owing to paper shortage, no’ further photostats

b> _ could be obtained, It is pointed out that the photostats were
passed to us by BIS and wore initially obtained by intercepts
of mail sent. to WES? BERLIN from the ROZ and in view of this should
be.treated with the greatest possible discretion.

2. Annexure I, the tester dated 24° Nov'57, would appear to
show that a certain amount of, unrest and ill-féeling exists between
the-two groups in BAUTZEN and BERLIN respectively. This 111-
feeling would appear to have been engendered by derogitory letters
sent to subject and his girl-friend by the. BERLIN ‘branch of the
family and that the flames have been fanned by the fact that DOWNIE
has not been receiving many letters from BERLIN.and the fow that
hgre been received were unflattering about his way of life in

LERMANN have contributed in some small measure to the family
conflict, para 3 of ref 'A' refers.

3. Annexure I also supports our belief, based on previous’
yfeports, that Frau LEHMANN has quite some contact with other members
of the renogade colony in BAUTZEN; | She would certainly appear: to
have close contact with MURPHY, (The latter has been identified
as the US Aruy defector - RaLaqr9240 Clifford MURPHY, AWOL wef

~— 14 Nov 1953.)

GOTTSCHALK appears to be an appeal to her biother Erich not to
cast her aide, but to stand by her during this unpleasantness.

6. Annexure II, dated 25 Nov 57, shows that the family dispute
has now. burst into a conflagration, It would appear that the
MURPHY family have written to the BERLIN LEHMANN/GOTTSCHALK group
and have very adversely critisised the DOWNIE menage in BAUTZEN,
As a result of the MURPHY letter the family have written, in
terms of strong condemnation, to DOWNIE, "Para 3 above’ is also
supported by this second letter, DOWNIE's reply is a strong
derogation of the BERLIN menage in general and Erich LEHMANN
in particular. As a sign of his disgust and anger, no ddubt,
DOWNIE refrained from putting a stamp on the envelope, thus
ensuring that Erich GOPTSCHALK must pay for the pleasure of
reading DOWNIE's insults to hin,
Te In the postscript to this lotter written by Margot GOTTSCHALK,
€ I'she too oritifises her family and says "Goodbye for ever", although
leaving the door slightly open for a reconcillistion with her
brother Erich, who has been reported to be the one member of the
family to whom she feels most closely tied.
8. In the closing lines of his’ second letter, TOWIE asks that
the letters written by persons in BAUTZEN be sent to hin, so that
= he my confront them with these letters. As a threat to induce
the family to comply with his request, DOWNIE writes that he will
arrange for an upproach to be mide to the political party of which
Frau LEHMANN is a member. It may be that the 'party! referred to
is the KPD (Commnist Party of GERMANY), but, on the other hand, it
does tend to confirm previous reports that Frau LEHMANN is ‘a member
of the SED (Socialist Unity Party of GERMANY); para 2 of ref 'A!

- refers. : -
os It is pointed out that the typed reproductions of the letters
which are attached. to this report are as per the originals and the (

spelling,punctuation etc is DOWNIE!'s and NO? ours,

lo. Tt would appear that the DOWNIE/GOTTSCHALK marriage has not

yet taken place after all and that DOWNIE did not attempt to return

to BERLIN during the latter part of Oct 57, as had previously been
reported by various overt sources available to us, para 4 of ref At
refers. Further to paras 8 to 10 of ref 'A', our enquiries have
established that the person referred to was NOT DOWNIE, “but a former
BRITISH soldier, now demobilised, who had returned to BERLIN for a
visit as a civilian, .

1. From the tone of the two letters, it would appear that, DOWIE”
and GOTTSCHALK are living happily together, which is contrary to ,
previous reports we have received concerning the marital-like state
of these two persons.’ However, it is, of course, appreciated~that
these letters may have been written with the intention of
presenting a ‘united front ' to the family in BERLIN. Whilst our
efforts in BERLIN to aggravate DOWNIB's relationship with ‘the
‘LEHMANN /GOTTSCHALK family would appear to have born fruit, para 2
WOOVE~wiwe—seferoy~it-iny-ot~procent, impossible to asness with
accuracy ‘whether we will be successful in driving DOWNE out of
BAUTZEN and back to the WEST. It 4s, naturally, appreciated

that our attempts to influence DOWNIE my have a directly opposite effect
than that which we intend and will induce him to remain in the DDR,
although this is thought unlikely as he would be more free of. the
LEHMANN/GOTTSCHALK interference, and from Margot GOTTSCHALK, in the

UK than in the DDR and he may well come round to this view in due

course.

12. In the postseript to Annexure I, written by Margot
GOTTSCHALK, she writes that sho and DOWNIE are moving to a new
accomodation, although does not specify where this is. They

have beon living at their present address (BAUTZEN; Ziegelstrasse, 71)
for quite some time and enquiries will be made in order to establish

their new address, to which. they should move at the beginning of
Dee 57.

D We will continue to maintain casual contact with the

LEFMANN/GOTTSHCALK family in WEST BERLIN, on the lines mentioned
in ref 1A',

ue No additional details are at present available, but enquiries

are continuing and a further report will be submitted as soon as new
information is received by us.
