SS report constitutes the first piece. of substantive
formation about Lee Harvey Oswald's sojourn in Mexico City to
appear since the assassination of President Kennedy. We under-
stand the reluctance of the unidentified source to become
involved, but the fact remains that this information cannot con~
tinue to be withheld or concealed. 1

It is requested that you confer with Mr. Ruyle to deter-—
e identity of the source and the best way of approaching
His desire to stay out of trouble seems likelier to be
gratified through cooperation with U. S. authorities than it
would be if we were forced to turn the matter over to the Mexican
authorities,

It 1s also requested that you determine whether the
ttached information has been made available to LNERGO and, if
it has not, to request that this step be taken.

The information needed is the identity of the source, an ©
approximate date for the two days spent with Oswald, the identities
of all others in contact with Oswald at that time, and a detailed
account of what happened.

investigation in New Orleans. It is therefore necessary to bear
this possibility in mind when interviewing the source and others
who spent time with Oswald in Mexico City. It is our hope that
the facts obtained through these interviews will help to. confirm
that several of Garrison's allegations about involvement of anti-
Castro Cubans, WOFACT, etc., are false.

Doar Wos: .

The missing Lee Harvey Oswald airgram reforred to in your letter of
April 14, is Tampico's A~43, which I drafted on March 16, It ought
to have reached you before April 14. .

I had originally debated with myself whether to send anything at all,  *
considering my "informant" did not seem to offer anything new, How

ever, in view of the admittedly "electrifying quality" of the subject, woe
I finally decided to record the matter,

Because of your letter, I invited my friend to lunch today, We went” ~
over the ground in somewhat more detail, as set, forth below, but he

did not claim he was making world-shaking revelations, and I do not
believe he was,

He said he and a group of fellow students met Oswald one afternoon
(he does not recall the date) when they came out of the Cineclus,

which I understood to be at the Egcuela de Filosofia (I am not familiar
with the University of Mexico), Ile described Oswald as Mraro" and

SUOMENERHER "introvertido", a person who obviously had complexes and
problems, —

Oswald was with the group during the remainder of the afternoon and
evening and all the following day, They paid for his meals during thie
tine. (It was of interest to me my informant said that, in addition to
recormiz.ing Oswald's photograph following the assassination of Prosident
Kennedy, he easily recalled Oswald's name because both "Harvey and
NQowald" connoted rabbit to him, something I had not thought of.)

Oswald ovidently had gone to the university to look for pro-Castro students -
who might help bin persuade the Cuban Ebassy to grant hima vieq. He

spoke little Spanish, but indicated he as from California, as woll as
that he had been a menber of a prowGrstro group in New Orleans (no

mention of Texas). He also gave them to understand police agencies
in the United States had harrassed him ("lo Hostilizagan"). He
showed an interest in painting and paintings.

My friend reports the Cuban Embassy turned Oswald down from the outset,
apparently in the first place because they had no “previous” on hin
and in the second place because they suspected he was a U.S. agent.

Oswald was deeply upset over being rejected by the Cubans. Hy
informant used the word “lloraba", but I inferred not literally. The
group saw no more of Oswald after the second day.

I am not trying to be coy about my "informant's" name. I should
nevertheless like to protect him to the extent possible, He claims _,,.,/
not to have discussed his acquaintance with Oswald with anyone except
me. I tako this with a grain of salt, but he does seem genuinely
fearful of losing his job if he is tied publicly to this matter.

He also scems fearful of trouble with his former pro-Castro student
| friends if they get the impression he "ratted" on anyone. 1 gather
| they are not altogether “former",.considering he says some of them

still visit him here from time to time.

| Incidentally, he claims to have visited Cuba, to be well. acquainted
with Raul Roa and, to a lesser degree, with Castro. He claims further |
| to have been friendly with one Maria Teresa Proenza, who I understood |
| him to say defected from the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City and may now |
de in Miami. !
i

One item he "revealed" during our first evening particularly intrigued ‘
me. (He seemed subsequently, and probably with justification, especial tay
fearful of the unpleasant consequences which might derive from any

publicity regarding it). He asserted he was the student who personally)
climbed XXXXKXXXXXXKK the Miguel Aleman statue on the UAH campus with |
the dynamite--I believe he said dynamite--when it was mutilated some. |
years ago. y

I am aware my friend my have fabricated everything he told me. My
personal evaluation io that he has been truthful.

Sincerely, . cob

shown to the OSWALDs. The Agency finally allowed the
picture to appear in the report with the background
completely blocked out and with the agreement that no
mention would be made about where it had been taken.

As far as can be determined, the Agency has never
admitted publicly that the photo was taken in Mexico,

Nicaraguan citizen, walked in to the U.S, Embassy in
Mexico, claiming to have knowledge re Kennedy's assasination.
Was Tearne’ a Was an agent for the Nicaraguan,
Intelligence Service (NIS), however his story re the
ssassination was separate from his work for the NIS): After
ing a polygraph, 1t was
determined that ALVARADO had been fabricating a story claiming
he had seen OSWALD receive money from a Cuban official at
the Cuban Embassy in Mexico. The ALVARADO story appears
in the Warren Report but it does not rev. hi, In
jorder to continue to protec DO and the Nicaraguan
government from possible embarrassment all mention of
ALVARADO has been marked for non-release.

A list and copies of douments from the OSWALD file

ave been forwarded to your office for review by other(LA,
branches and possibly other Divisions. ‘The documents are marked
according to which volume they belong in the 201 file (there
are 57 volumes plus many bulky atachments.)

3, During the review, it was necessary several times to
refer to the Warren Report and the exhibits to ascertain
exactly what was already known about the Mexican aspect of the
case, It is doubtful that the other branches will find this
necessary, but in case they do, the Warren Report is held

in the Library.
