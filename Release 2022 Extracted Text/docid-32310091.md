I said fine and everything was lovely until they got

collect their money.

Inaudible conversation

(V) No, as a director you're liable for everything . .

putting them on notice.

had

• Sully Sherone our attorney, he told me that he

seen Jimmy, of course they were on this negotiation and

he was the one

who told me about

• this was actually

before it was in the paper that they're moving down to

Chattanooga and that

• tough one

.. I know from the

work we've done in that state and knowing

that state, they

don't like outsiders.

I don't see how he's gonna come out unless

they get a fix in there. I just don't know how. This is

the toughest one he's ever had.

Inaudible

(V).... Jimmy's head attorney

(M) Whose, Jimmy's head attorney? Which one is that?

(V) That's the fellow

from

town here.

(M) Oh, he's from Detroit . . .

Inaudible

(V)

• . . I happened to walk in his office

... and he had

just come back

•.. this was before they got the move

and he says you know this thing happened . . . there isn't

an attorney who can tackle this.

They're all

scared to

death and this guy's staying down in Washington.

(M) Well, I'm not so sure that that isn't actually gonna be the

route, that, they can

get some help down there cause ...

working as we did

• . . that's a practical state

•. • and on

the other hand I've never seen, you know you talk about

clannishness up in New Hampshire or the clannishness out on

the North Shore in Chicago.

Those people are all related to

each other and unless you're in, you're out and they don't

like anybody from the outside.

Now that would be true ..

they wouldn't like Jimmy but on the other hand, they're not

gonna like Bobby either . ..

(M) One thing that concerns me though is when we talked' in Washington

and talked about the possibility of Chicago and so on . ..

(M)

(V)

I can't see how it's gonna do one darn bit of good to have the

fix in Chicago.

If he gets convicted in Tennessee, because

if he's convicted in Tennessee and comes to Chicago with a

recent felon, he's had it.

No matter how much your Judge might

help . . . because under

those circumstances.

•.. it's-just too soon . . .

(M)

Inaudible

• At least we can keep track of it in Chicago because

we'll be in a position to help... apparently they're just

gonna

make sure that the one down South is ...

I don't know why .

Inaudible

(V) I don't think it's helped him a lot to get it moved.

(M)

Well, I think as a matter of fact, it's probably hurt because

this is a little town...

(M)

Sort of a home town type thing where everybody knows everybody

and

there is certainly no industry there compared tọ Nashville.

• in an industrial community. why he might just on the

law of averages get friendlier

(M) . . . . that bothers me because you surely think that ..

(V) He's the fellow I met before

....

(M)

They have, they have. .

(M)

his and we've worked with Clements and we've worked with

• and these are practical guys

(V). Well, Clements is . . . I understand a practical

(M)

.. and anybody that's on the bench down there is gonna

listen

•• • which is from

that point of view a practical thing

but it bothers me cause he's gotta come out of Tennessee I

think without a conviction otherwise when he comes to Chicago

Inaudible

(M)

I think that it could be done,

I really do .

•ah .

• and it

can be done

fast but . . ah

if they're

gonna move, they're

gonna have to move and move

fast.

(V) .... true ....

(V) It can't be done by Jimmy, it's got to be done by somebody

else .

(M)

I agree absolutely, it's gotta be somebody in an entirely different

industry, you as a

banker or somebody like myself as an engineer

that can, that has other business down there, other reason

to be talking

to these people... can have nothing to do with

the situation' down in Chattanooga

at

all but. . ah . . I think

it can be done but it costs money.

(V) Like, any idea?

(M) Well, I would just guess, I would think that . . ah . . to

delude the top guy is gonna cost a quarter of a million bucks.

Maybe even

half a million.

Campaign contributions I don't

think they're interested in.

I think they'd be interested

in

real money.

• Maybe

.. • deposited out of the United States on

a COD basis, that way you know somebody doesn't get paid before

they get through.. ah. cause they work on the honor

they always have. but that the

oys madow her reason i know is that even though we have this

bankruptcy in . . all kinds of interstate highway stuff and

you have to be qualified

and say we i okay

• • • qualified

just to do a the count or out of they re doking on cash y

that's it. No hitches, no problems.

Inaudible

(M) Do you think you can get them to come up with that money . . :

(M) Did you ever talk to Jimmy about me, you told me you were going

to ...
