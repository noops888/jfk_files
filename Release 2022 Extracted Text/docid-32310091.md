"This is Special Agent William F. Hood, Federal
Bureau of Investigation, Chicago, Illinois. I have just H

C, Meissner at his residence in Hinsdale, Illinois, and this
date January 10, 1964, at approximately 6:30 A.M,
Long inaudible conversation

. . . . that $200,000 a year is a hell of a lot of money to
pay out for taxes.

Did he actually misappropriate stiiattite:

I have an attorney, who is probably the best attorney in
town. I sent him a letter.

As a director you're not liable . . . double, are you?
No, as a director you're liable for everything ..

putting them on notice.

We're putting them on notice. . . they don't have to be

money from them . . $100,000 I got . . . I had to go over there

so-called socialites here in this town.

. » . Sully Sherone our attorney, he told me that he

had seen Jimmy, of course they were on this negotiation and

he was the one who told me about .. . this was actually

before it.was in the paper that they're moving down to
Chattanooga and that .. . tough one . .. I know from the

work we've done in that state and knowing that state, they

don't like outsiders. I don't see how he's gonna come out unless
they get a fix in there. I just don't know how. This is

the toughest one he's ever had.

Inaudible

. . . . Jimmy's head attorney

Whose, Jimmy's head attorney? Which one is that?

That's the fellow from town here.

Oh, he's from Detroit ... °
Inaudible —

. « » I happened to walk in his office .. . and he had
just come back . . . this was before they got the move
and he says you know this thing-happened .. . there isn't
an attorney who can tackle this. They're all scared to
death and this guy's staying down in Washington.

Well, I'm not so sure that that isn't actually gonna be the
route, that, they can get some help down there cause. ...
working as we did . . . that's'a practical state . .. and on
the other hand I've never seen, you know you talk about
clannishness up in New Hampshire or the clannishness out on
the North Shore in Chicago. Those people are all related to
each other and unless you're in, you're out and they don't
like anybody from the outside. Now that would be true . .
they wouldn't like Jimmy but on the other hand, they're not
gonna like Bobby either ...

One thing that concerns me though is when we talked‘ in Washington
and talked about the possibility of Chicago and so on...

I can't see how it's gonna do.one darn bit of good’ to have the
fix in Chicago. If he gets convicted in Tennessee, because

if he's convicted in Tennessee and comes to Chicago with a
recent felon, he's had it. No matter how much your Judge might
help . . . because under those circumstances . . .

. . . it's.just too soon....-
Inaudible
. .:. At. least we can keep track of it in Chicago because
we'll be in a position to help .. . apparently they're’ just
gonna make sure that the one down South is...
I don't know why...
Inaudible
I don't think it's helped him a lot to get it moved.
/

Well, I think as a matter of fact, it's probably hurt because ~—
this is a little town...

Sort of a home town type thing where everybody knows everybody
and there is certainly no industry there compared to Nashville.
« . in an industrial community . . . why he might just on the
law of averages get friendlier ...

eae . that bothers me because you surely think that .. .
He's the fellow I met before... .
They have, they have...

« » . . and we've worked with Clements and we've worked with
his .. . and these are practical guys

Well, Clements is ...TI understand a practical...
.» + « » and anybody that's on the bench down there js gonna
listen . . . which is from that point of view a practical thing

but it bothers me cause he's gotta come out of Tennessee I
think without a conviction otherwise when he comes to Chicago

I think that it could be done, I really do. . ah. . and it
can be done fast but .. ah. . if they're gonna move, they're
gonna have to move and move fast.

SHU et PoHIER UGH cttedits

It can't be done by Jimmy, it's got. to be done by somebody
else . ... : : :

I agree absolutely, it's gotta be somebody in an entirely different
industry, you as a banker or somebody like myself as an engineer

. . . that can, that has other business down there, other reason
to be talking to these people .. . can have nothing to do with

the situation down in Chattanooga at all but... ah .. I think

jt can be done but it costs money. ~ oe

Like, any idea?

.Well, I would just guess, I would think that . . ah. . to

delude the top guy is gonna cost a quarter of a. million bucks.
Maybe even half a million. Campaign contributions I don't
think they're interested in. I think they'd be interested in
real mofiey; Maybe . . . deposited out of the United States on
a COD basis, that way you know somebody doesn't get paid before
they get through . . ah . . cause they work on the honor |
system down there anyhow, they always have . . but that the
only way . . the reason I know is that even though we have this
bankruptcy in .. . all kinds of interstate highway stuff and
you have to be qualified . . . qualified ...so .. . and they
just sit down and say well okay . . . they're looking for cash

that's it. No hitches, no problems. :
