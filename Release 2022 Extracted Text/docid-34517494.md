procedure is another method by which informants may be paid.

13. (0) Handling of Informants:

a. Investigative personnel nust control their informants. The is-

formant must be nade to realize that the investigative agent is his band-

ler.

Every precaution will be taken to insure that the informant is pre-

cluded from making decisions for the investigative agent.

bo Extreme care and precaution must be taken to conceal the true

identity of informants utilized by the Detachment.

Investigative agents will vary meeting places and meeting times

with their informants. Alternate meeting places and times will also be

established.

d. Investigative agents will require their informants to identify

completely their sub-sources (name, DOB and FOB, aliases, occupation,

political affiliations, addresses, physical description, placement in the

counterintelligence target area, place and manner of contact and any

other pertinent information).

e. Investigative agents will caution and periodically remind infor-

mants that under no circumstances will they reveal to anyone, by action

or words, that they are wörking for the Intelligence Corps.

Informants

will be warned that any attempt on their part to coerce or "shake down"

individuals by virtue of their relationship with the Intelligence Corps,

will lead to immediate dismissal and probable severe punitive action.

f. Investigative agents will avoid beconing too friendly with infor-

nants. Normal practices of good courtesy will be extended to informents..
