(1) In using the evaluation scale, code symbols only (letters
end numbers) will be used; thus, if the investigative agent considers
the source of the information to be “usually reliable" and the subzitted
information to be "possibly true," the proper code symbol to be utilized
would be "B-3."" To assist handling agents in complete understanding of
the evaluation scale, the following explanation has been prepared:

(a) A+ will refer to en unimpeachable source.
(ov) B- will refer %o an excellent source.
(c) C= will refer to a good source.

(a) D and 5 - Sources proven by past experience to be un-
reliable; however, this situation does not preclude an instance when
these types of sources provide credible information. Explanation will
be made in Agent's notes.

(k) Casual (C) informants, are usually one time infor-
mants. For this reason, peyment from intelligence contingency funds
will not normally be made to this category of informants.

(1) Indigenous employees, (A) informants, ere paid fron
&@ppropriated or non-appropriated funds. For this reason, payment from
intelligence contingency funds will not normally be made to this category
of informants.

(m) Informants may be paid in currency, incentive itezs,
or a combination of these two methods of payment.

(n) Investigative personnel teams or offices will effect
lisison with units, activities or installations which hire indigenous
personnel to insure that professionally qualified potential "A" type
informants are hired, when required, for routine employments. This
procedure is another method by which informants may be paid.

13. YO) Handling of Informants:

| a. Investigative personnel must control their informants. The in-

| formant must de made to realize that the investigative agent is his hand-
| ler. Every precaution will be taken to insure that the informant is pre-
cluded from raking decisions for the investigative agent.
|

b. Extreme care and precaution must be taken to conceal the true
identity of informants utilized by the Detachment.

c. Investigative agents will vary meeting places and meeting times
with their informants. Alternate meeting places and times will also be
established.

d. Investigative agents will require their informants to identify
completely their sub-sources (name, DOB and POB, aliases, occupation,
political affiliations, addresses, physical description, placement in the
counterintelligence target area, place and manner of contact and any
other pertinent information).

e. Investigative agents will caution and periodically remind infor-
mants that under no circumstances will they reveal to anyone, by action
or words, that they are working for the Intelligence Corps. Informants
will be warned that any attempt on their part to coerce or "shake down"
individuals by virtue of their relationship with the Intelligence Corps,
will lead to immediate dismissal and probable severe punitive action.

f. Investigative agents will avoid becoming too friendly with infor-
| ments. Normal practices of good courtesy will be extended to informants...
Investigative agents will conduct themselves so that they maintain the
respect of informants whom they are handling and avoid bringing discredit
upon themselves and the Intelligence Corps.

ge Informants will be periodically tested for reliability. One
proven method of testing is to assign S51, the answer to which are al-
ready known.

h. Investigative egents will always be alert to the possibility of
having informants doubled by enemy egents. When it is discovered that
an informant has deen coubled or there ere indications that the informant
may be, or may have deen doubled, the matter will be reported to Detach-
ment Headquarters by the most expeditious means.

i. Indigenous personnel will be used es “spotters” to aid in select-
ing the individuals +o be approached for employment as informers.

14. (OS) Prior epprovel will be obtained from Detachment Headquarters
before informants ere terminated.

15. Cd), When an investigative egent desires to terminate an informant,

will be submitted to Detachment Headquarters.

APPENDIX 7 (VIP PROTECTIVE SURVEILLANCE) to Annex M (SPECIAL OPERATIONS)
to 316th INTC Det Tac sop (U)

1. When so directed by higher headquarters, this Detechment will provide
constant close security for Very Important Persons (VIPs), both military
and civilian.

2. The VIP must be protected from all hazards, whether they ere the re-
sult of designs or plans, accidents or negligence. The personnel re-
quirements will be determined by the number of VIPs, the length of visit,
and the nature of the itinerary. Protection will be continuous from

the time the VIP enters the area until the time he leaves. Protection
will be afforded without ostentation and with a maximum of courtesy and
efficiency.

3. Personnel selected for the security detail will be mature, experienced
special agents. Clothing to be worn during the course of surveillance
will be determined by the Operations Officer. Personnel will be ermed
with appropriate weapons. Radio-equipped vehicles, as well es one "Walkie-
Talkie" radio per vehicle will be utilized.

4. A SAIC will be designated for the detail, and during the surveillance,
he will act as the Control Officer, operating from a base which is lo~
cated at Detachment Headquarters, a hotel, or some other point suitable
for direction and control. He will be in continuous radio contact with
his agent teams. Normally, in a mobile surveillance, two teams of two
men each will be on duty, each team using a vehicle.

5. The SAIC will accomplish the following:

a. Establish necessary liaison with interested law enforcement and
intelligence agencies.

bd. Obtain all informetion possible concerning the proposed visit of
the VIPs, including the exact itinerary and route of march. He will then
brief his teams.accordingly.

c. Make arrangements for vehicles and equipment and procure necessary
tickets and passes*for those areas that will be covered by the surveillance
teams.

ad. Have egents draw veapons, which will be loaded with five rounds
during the actual surveillance. When civilian clothing is worn, the
Colt .38 Datective Special will be concealed under the coat.

6.' Vehicles will be employed as follows:
a. Normally, two vehic¢les will be used in a convoy. One of the ve-

hicles will be directly in front of the VIP vehicle, and the other will
be directly behind the VIP vehicle. +

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Hi

NW 64954 Docld:34517494 Page 18 MJ-1



be During loading and unloading of VIPs, the Detachment vehicles will
be parked with the motor running, and one of the agents in each vehicle HE
will station himself in the proximity of the VIPs.

c. The Detachment vehicles will be closed in at all intersections
and when the convoy enters a main highway to preclude other vehicles and
pedestrians from entering or separating the convoy.

d. Detachment vehicles will act as a screen for the VIP vehicle in
the event of an attempt by a vehicle to crash into the VIP vehicle or in
case the latter is fired upon.

e. At eny time that the VIP vehicle stops, the Detachment vehicles
will close in, and the non-driver will dismount to be prepared for any
eventuality. In case the VIP vehicle is fired upon, all agents will rush
to act as 2 screen for the VIPs and/or close with the source of the attack.

7. Special Agents will accomplish the following:

a. Prior to the visit of the VIP, a check of the buildings end erea
edjecent to the route of march will be made in order to determine those
locations which would be suitable for launching an attack against the
VIP. In the event any of the buildings or area is considered hazardous
in this connection, liaison will be effected with Military Police and/or
law enforcement agencies to insure extra protection at these locations.

be During the entire surveillance, agents will screen and protect
the VIPs where necessary.

¢. Agents will be stationed at critical points during sociel functions
to preclude the entry of party crashers and pests. Unauthorized persons
will be removed from the area by force if necessary in cooperation with
the Military Police. In case the VIP is in an area where a large crowd
is gathered, agents will move in and forme protective ring around the

d. Where possible, agent teams will stay in constant radio contact
with the control station and report relevant activity.

e. After-action reports will be submitted in writing to Detachment
Headquarters.
