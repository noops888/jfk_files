in the USSR. One of the major responsibilities of the KGB is that of

use of agents and informants drawn from among Soviet citizens with whom
foreigners come in contact. For example, many if not all of the guides
provided foreigners by Inturist, the official fourist agency of the USSR,
are KGB agente or informants. Hotel and restaurant personnel are also
often used in this capacity by the KGB. Only certain restaurants and
hotels in the major cities of the USSR are normally open te foreign visitors.
A high percentage of the employees in these selected hotels and restaurants
are KGB agents or informants, a

2 Foreign nationals whe request Soviet citizenship or permanent
residence in the USSR are, of course, a special category of foreigners.
The KGB exumines all such cases with great care to determine motivation
and possible usefulness to the USSR. Once a foreigner bas been granted
citizenship or permiesion to reside in thé-USSR he is subject to sur-
velllance and control through auch measures ae periodic interviews with
neighbore and asseciates.
