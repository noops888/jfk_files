{ The joint communiqué issued
jon 21 December at the conclusion
of the Chinese leaders' visit to

Cairo contains few surprises,

and reports from Algiers suggest

that discussions with Ben Bella

Thus far the Chinese have at-
tempted to minimize differences,
play up past contacts, and press
such themes as militant struggle
against colonialism and "US im-

actions designed to play down
the impact of the Chinese lead-
ers'arrival, Chou was greeted
in Cairo with a 2l-gun salute,

Algeria, Ben Bella was on hand
to greet his guests, but the top-

continent.__Criticism-of the | f
USSR was reportedly a recurrent
theme in Chou's four lengthy
talks with Nasir. Nasir report-
edly said that Chou talked about |
the USSR the way the Soviets |

used to talk about the US. He
accused the Soviets of trying

to colonize China, of breaking
political and economic promises,
and of becoming tools of the

US, and he warned that any Afro-
Asian country which became de-
pendent on Moscow would suffer
the same fate as Peiping.

In Algeria, Chou sounded a
Similar note. He cited China's
early support for Algerian rev-
olutionaries--support which ac-
tually pre-dated that of the USSR.)
He has also undoubtedly scored | | -
Soviet unreliability. The Chi- |
nese may be pressing the Algerians
to use some of the $50-million -
eredit offered in October. This. |
offer was made to counter a $100-
million Soviet credit offered | |
earlier the same month.

Sino-Soviet rivalry for
African support also flared at | {
the UN, where Peiping outmaneu-
vered Moscow on the question of
enlarging the representation in
principal UN organs to accommo-
date the African bloc. Soviet
delegate Fedorenko had attempted)
to make it appear that the Chi-
nese were opposed to the African-
sponsored expansion plan because
they insisted that any change
in the UN be tied to Peiping's
own admission to the Security
Council. The USSR found itself

NORTH KOREA TMPROVES AIR DEFENSE CAPABILITY

_ Korea has recently
taken several steps which signif-
ieantly strengthen its air de-
fenses. MIG-21 (Fishbed) jet
fighters, which were first de-
tected only at Pukchang-ni air-
field, now are being stationed

at other airfields. Pyongyang
has also apparently just acquired
a large number of relatively
sophisticated types of radar
sets, In addition, the North
Korean bomber force, which has

! al total of about 100 IL-28

(Beagle) jet light bombers, is
in part now equipped with, and
has been training with, an im-
proved blind bombing and naviga-
tional system,

| Testing of and flight train-
ing with the new fighters--10
to 14 of which were apparently
obtained from the USSR in the
fall of 1962--were first noted
in communications intelligence
in June 1963. Since that time
the MIG-2ls have been detected
frequently in flight activity
involving ground controlled in-
tercept exercises.

| Beginning in October, MIG~
21s have been noted operating
from Wonsan on the east coast
of North Korea, Their deploy-
ment to this airfield places
supersonic fighters on both the
east and west coasts of North
Korea.

The North Koreans have re-

radar, at least one of which 1
is believed to be exclusively |
of Chinese Communist manufacture,
have been detected, For the \
present these radars will ap-
parently supplement rather than
replace North Korea's original |
three types--Kniferest A, SCR- |
270, and Token. | |

The identifiable new types aoe
include Kniferest B, Spoonrest i
A, and a new type of Chinese Com- |
munist origin which is probably |
a substantial modification of
the SCR-270. Spoonrest A is
sometimes used as the acquisi-
tion radar for surface-to-air
missile sites, but it is also
used in an early warning role
and is probably intended for that
use in North Korea. Acquisition
of these new radars reflects
North Korea's efforts to extend |
the range of its early warning
detection system. To improve
height-finding capability, Pyong-
yang has also introduced more
sophisticated radars such as |
Rockcake and Stonecake. \

Another improvement in North |
Korea's air capability is the |
equipment of about twenty IL-28s

Apathy and disenchantment } 4
over the new government are wide-
spread among such key elements
as middle-grade officers, stu- i

of local officials deemed in-

the Diem regime, and on the rise |
in Viet Cong activity. There i
are signs that junta members
themselves are beginning to share
the disillusionment of some cir-
cles with Premier Tho's provi-
sional cabinet, which is described |
as ineffective and regional in
outlook.

Leading generals névertheless
seem to have few effective steps
in mind to rally popular support.
Three generals recently complained
to US officials that they were hav-
ing trouble finding qualified
Vietnamese to fill government posi-
tions and that press criticism \
of their efforts was unhelpful.
General "Big" Minh, the chief of }

called for an "early" meeting

Vientiane to the royal capital

at Luang Prabang, which would be

the formation of a mixed police

FRENCH CABINET MINISTER TO VISIT CAMBODIA

p= Armed Forces=Minister—————

derre Messmer's visit to Cam-
dia from 4-7 January is de-
igned primarily to strengthen
rench influence there in the
ake of Prince Sihanouk's call
for an end to the US aid pro-
ram. Messmer's high-level
ntourage, which includes the
-¢hiefs of the Foreign Ministry's
ndochina and Cultural and Tech-
ical divisions, will probably
recommend some increases in aid,
but De Gaulle apparently has
o intention of taking on any
barge new commitments.

French-grant aid to Cam-

odia since 1956 has amounted
to only $15 million. Current
ssistance is threefold: a
ilitary training mission of at
east 250 men; cultural aid in
he form of a university mission
jand 319 teachers in Cambodian
schools; and the maintenance of
about 40 experts in the fields
lof health and public works. In
addition, a number of French
nationals hired by the Cambodian
rovernment hold positions of
onsiderable influence in the
inistry of Finance, the Treas-
ury, and the premier's office,
and are among Prince Sihanouk's

dvisers

i mititary—aid—probably—would—
be limited to reconditioned and

trucks and light armored vehicles
Increased cultural and technical
assistance probably would include
further help for the French uni-
versity mission, more teachers,
and 30 or 40 additional technical
experts, especially agricultural-
ists.

The extension of French aid
will be complicated by Cambodia's
claims for compensation for
losses incurred-as a result of
the 1958 devaluation of the
French franc. Since 1958 France
has asserted that a large-scale
aid program would be impossi-
ble until there is agreement on
an exchange rate, but a compro-
mise may now be in sight.

Sihanouk has sought French
help in maintaining Cambodia's
policy of neutrality, and in
recent talks with the US andthe
UK, France has supported his
call for an international con-
ference on Cambodian neutral-
ity, despite US objections.
Indeed, De Gaulle has consist-
ently sought to meet Sihanouk
more than half way, and Paris
may now encourage Sihanouk
to press this issue. (CON-

the Israelis begin pumping tests

The Arab military chiefs

against the Israeli project.

the Israeli scheme, particularly
in view of the close proximity

Nasir's wariness about be-
coming involved in a war with
Israel over Jordan waters was
also evident in a speech he
made on 23 December. He empha-
sized that the problem is polit-
ical rather than military in
nature and that the chiefs of
staff cannot solve it. He
called for a summit meeting of
Arab presidents and kings to
seek a solution.

Israel,

considers there is
an outside possibility that
Syria might bomb or shell the
pumping facility's transformer
station. However, the Israelis
believe the primary threat stems
from former Palestinians now
living in Syria, Jordan or
Lebanon, who might make a dra-
matic effort to sabotage the
project even though they prob-
ably could not cause serious
damage. (SECRET NO FOREIGN

teady growth of tension on the
island during the past few weeks.
e new tension followed Presi-
lent Makarios' presentation to
rkish Cypriot leaders of propos-
1s for changing the Cyprus con-
stitution. The proposals, which
essentially involved removing the
guarantees to the Turkish minor-
ity that had been written into
the Cyprus settlement of 1959,
were rejected by the Turkish Gov-
ernment even before the Turkish
Cypriots had made their views
known.

Most of the initial fight-
ing appears to have been between
Greek Cypriot police and the Turk-
jish underground, and to have taken
place in the Turkish areas of Nic-
osia.. The situation there de-
| teriorated progressively during
jthe week, as the police lost con-
trol to extremist groups of ir-

j regulars from both communities.
{A cease-fire, to be supervised
by the British, had not been ef-

In the face of these-des——
velopnents, the Turkish Govern-
ment threatened to exercise its

right under the 1959 agreement
to intervene on Cyprus. Three
Turkish jet fighters flew over
Nicosia on 25 December, and
Turkish naval units appeared off
the island. Part of the 650-man
Turkish garrison on Cyprus left i
its barracks to move into one i
of the Turkish quarters of the
capital. Part of the 950-man
Greek contingent then moved to
protect Greek areas. The situa-
tion evidently prodded Athens f
and London into a more active
role, and Greek, Turkish and
British forces on Cyprus have
been placed under a unified Brit-
ish-led command. Britain has an.
nounced it is sending 150 ad-
ditional troops.

The violence may make lead-
ers of both sides more cautious
in pressing political demands.

go more slowly in pushing his con}
stitutional revisions. Both eth-

averted disaster for the sec=

nd time in less than a year. The
leleventh-hour agreements reached

‘on agricultural policy on 23 De~
tember are apparently sufficient

to discourage De Gaulle from carry-
ing out his threat to break up the
ommunity. Moreover, the Germans
and Dutch succeeded in extracting
limited commitments from Paris on
EEC participation in the Kennedy
Round of tariff negotiations. These
agreements do not cover all the out-
standing issues, however, and the
manner in which they were reached
will leave a residue of bitterness.
ior is it certain that major US
interests have fared well.

The main agricultural elements
in the "package" deal are the reg-
lations concerning intracommunity
trade in beef, rice, and dairy prod-
icts and the rules governing the
ommunity farm fund. Their effect
hes to open the large West German
rket to farm exports of France,
taly, and the Netherlands--gen-
rally at a substantial advantage
over the exports of nonmembers. Al-
though approval of these and the
financial regulations is an im-
portant step forward, the key ques-
tion of grain price unification is
istill unsettled. Further considera-

gotiations--although an improvement)”
over the initial Mansholt propos-
als--also leaves much to be desire
from the US view. In general, the |
EEC proposes that, if its levy sys-
tem operates in such a way as to
cause difficulties for the exports
of nonmembers, then the EEC Commis
sion will be called on to propose
“appropriate,” but unspecified,
measures. These would not apply
if it is technically impossible to
determine how much protection is
actually involved in the levy sys-
tem.

The general relief within
the community which greeted these
agreements reflects both the
depth of the crisis and some op-
timism that the Common Market's
unity may have been restored, The
prominent role played by the
EEC's commission in achieving
the compromise has in particu-
lar encouraged those who hope to
strengthen the community's in-
stitutional structure,

In France the conviction
was evidently widespread, how-
ever, that both Bonn and The

tion of the formula proposed by Com-
missioner Mansholt has been delayed

The agreement on a Kennedy

of tariff "disparities," the EEC
adopted a formula which would

that Bonn "stood up" to De Gaulle

strongly colored by a desire to pro-

Thus, what are seen as

recent US demands for informa-

The British Government has ad-

the grounds that this informa-

WEST GERMAN POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS

Europe

—

_ The opening of the Berlin

fall during the holiday season
and the death of Social Demo-

eratic Party (SPD) chairman

Erich Ollenhauer have placed
illy Brandt once again in the
enter of the German political

stage.

The agreement to open the
Wall resulted from Brandt's un-
ceasing efforts to ease condi-
tons for Berliners. His will-

igness to reach agreement with
ihe East Zone authorities on

ihe pass issue is being criticized
yy some Christian Democratic
| Union (CDU) leaders and by the
¢DU-oriented press in West Ger-
many. Brandt, however, is bank-
ing on the expectation that most
lest Germans, like the Berliners,
i411 approve his action. He
has even hinted that there may
be further negotiations with the
East Germans to extend the period
of the passes beyond the 5 Jan-
uary cutoff date. There is also
speculation that both East and

st Germany will find the pass
gr other. a model for agreement
in

other issues.

| Brandt, who was the most
Jogical choice, was named acting
chairman of the SPD immediately
after Ollenhauer's death on 14

ecember. Deputy Chairman Her-
i lehner has proposed that
27 Dec 63

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WSEKLY REVIEW

_{ Brandt's position be formal

at a special party convention
next month. Fritz Erler, the
party's foreign and defense
expert, is slated to take
Brandt's place in the hierarchy
as second deputy chairman. As
the SPD leader, Brandt would
stand to be candidate for chan-
cellor in the 1965 general elec~
tions. If current opinion polls
are any indication, the SPD
will give the CDU a strong race
in that contest.

Brandt, however, has not
yet committed himself, since
to accept the SPD chairmanship
might require him to resign as

mayor of Berlin and move to Bonn.

In so doing he would have to
operate at a distance from his
political bastion.

Whatever Brandt decides,
the. SPD is bound to miss the
conciliating influence of Ollen-
hauer, who was able to hold
together the often highly
antagonistic factions of the
party. Brandt, with his ideas
of greater flexibility in
foreign policy, may be expected
to clash more frequently with
Wehner, who--despite his Com-
munist past--has come to rep-
resent the SPD's right wing.

DOMESTIC POLITICS IN CUBA

Fidel Castro is continuing his
effort to reduce the influence of
the veteran Communists who were lead-
ers of the Moscow-oriented, pre-rev-
olutionary Communist party of Cuba.
Castro's campaign against them,
launched in a bitter attack in March
1962, subsequently seemed to lose
steam. Recent reports from knowl-
edgeable clandestine sources, how-
ever, indicate that the old liners
are again on the defensive and are
likely to suffer further in govern-
ment shake-ups which may be in the
offing. Castro nevertheless con-
tinues to move slowly in order to
avoid undue disruption within his
regime.

The only major veteran Commu-
nist figure to remain in Castro's
good graces is Carlos Rafael Rod-
riguez, the head of the National
Agrarian Reform Institute. Rod-
riguez' position has actually been
strengthened in recent weeks with
the raising of his job to cabinet
level. He has evidently convinced
Castro of his personal loyalty and
of his ability as an administrator.
It is also possible that Rodriguez
performs a useful and trusted liai-
son role between Castro and Soviet
leaders, He returned to Havana on
22 December after a two-week trip
to the USSR and several Soviet satel-
lites where, according to press ac-
counts, he. was in contact with high-
ranking Communist Party officials.

The old-line Cuban Communists
remain strong, according to a re-
cent clandestine report, in the in-
termediate and lower echelons of
the military and party hierarchies.
Wherever possible, they continue

their "sectarian" efforts to secure
positions for their comrades at the
expense of Fidelistas. A clandes-
tine source reported hearing "ru-
mors" in high regime circles late
last month that veteran Communists
have banded together in clandestine
cells to work against Castro.

Che Guevara continues to be the
Cuban leader most openly critical of
the Soviet Union and the most’ insist-
ent on the "necessity" of accelerat-
ing the revolution in Latin America.
Fidel Castro is said to agree with
Guevara's position, but awareness of
Cuba's own self-interest still com-
pels him to be more cautious in pur-
suing policies that could be inter-
preted as anti-Soviet, It neverthe-
less remains a key regime policy to
encourage Communist revolution in
Latin America.

A clandestine source who is a
high-level Cuban diplomat asserts
that Cuban leaders privately recog-
nize that popular discontent with
the regime is widespread. He claims,
however, that they are confident
their unpopularity has reached its
nadir, and that they are beginning
to make up lost ground. They ex-
pect, for instance, that economic
difficulties--a major source of
discontent--will be largely over-
come within three years. The strat-
egy of the government, this source re-
ports, is to hold on untii the econ-
omy improves and until Cuban subver-
sive efforts elsewhere in Latin
America result in the establishment
of one or more Communist allies in
the hemisphere. Then, the regime
feels, it will be secure. (SECRET NO

friend of Brizola and there is
speculation that Brizola will,
in fact, eventually move into

The new finance minister
inherits almost insurmountable
economic and financial problems.
Chief among these are a rampant
inflation that may see the cost

foreign debt involving approxi-

due over the next two years.

The severity of the eco-
nomic situation and Goulart's
apparent intention to assume
greater personal direction over
financial policies increase
the possibility of radical meas-
ures that might be detrimental
to foreign creditors and in-
vestors. Goulart reportedly is
considering nationalization of
all public utilities and can-

Measures such as these could
lead to further deterioration
