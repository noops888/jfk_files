Introduction

The Cuban foreign intelligence service, the General Directorate of
Intelligence (Direccion General de Inteligencia - DGI), in dis=
charging tts function of protecting Cuban interests and security
and promoting the polagacs of the Cuban Government, employs agents
of many nationalities, Although its activities extend to Europe
and Africa, its principal agent strength is in Latin America,
Agents have in general two types of assignments: collection of
information on the local government and the local situation, and
Promotion of revelutioniry activity, including guerrilla warfare,
Ali DGI agents abread are therefore divided into two basic cate-
gorivs according to function: intelligence agents charged with
collection ef information and penetration of local governments and
organizations, who are truly clandestine, i.¢,, are not’ known in
their target countries as Cuban agents: and guerrilla warfare and
Satotage agents, charged with directing and supporting revolution-
ary activities, who are often known as Cuban agents to the local
Communist and leftist groups with which they work, The two types
of agents are trained Separately and are controlled by different
departments im the OGL adquarters in Havana, intelligence agents
by the [llegal Departm (Departamento Ile; ai, called Ilegal) and
guerrilla agents by the LN or National Liberation Department
(Departamento Liberacien Nacional),

recruited by that department. Of threc known agents in this cate-
gory, one was a member of the Cuban tnternal security service, the
Department of State Security (Departamento de Seguridad del

Estado ~. DSE), Julio Damasy Vasquez. He was 3 tratned parachutist

BE the time of his recruitment. Two other known agents, Rafael
Guzman and “Chino” (name unknown), were recruited because they

were friends of one of the Illegal Department officers, Saul
Gonzalez. One criterion for recruitment is that the agent sball

not have a wide circle of acquaintance,

Agents of other nationalities are usually recruited by agreement

+ between a DGI officer and the local Communist or leftist organiza-

tion to which the person belongs, but there are other possibie
sources,

a. Foreigners visiting Cuba. Must foreign visitors to Cuba are
handled by the Cuban Institute of Friendship with Peoples
(Institute Cubano del Amistad con los Pucblos - ICAP), which
arranges for their travel to Cuba; their itineraries, lodging,
and entertainment while there; and their return travel to
their homes or other destinations. The DGI has an arrangement
with ICAP under which members of the DGI “0 Department
(Department of Illegal Centers - Departamento Centros [legales)
meet and interview foreign visitors for the purpose of extract-.
ing any information of value to Cuba and of assessing them as
potential agents. Contacts are so well camouflaged as normal
ICAP courtesies that few of the visitors realize that they are
in touch with an intelligence agency, The DGI does not deal
with foreign diplomats, who ure the responsibility of the DSE,
but it has access to any other foreigners, If the MO Depart-
ment constders any visitor a potential agent, espectally if he
shows a Marxist or extreme leftist attitude, it reports his
mame and whatever it has learned about him to either the
Tllegal Department of the DGI, which handles intelligence
agents not in contact with local Communist or leftist groups,
or the LN Department, which works with guerrilla agents in
contact with such groups. Referral is made on the basis of
membership in or attachment to an organized group. In no case
does the MO Department recruit the agent; that privilege is
reserved for the operational departments.

b, Foreigners resident in Cuba. The BC Section (Colonial Bureau -
Buro Colonial) of the S{I'Department (Department of Information
Services - Departamento Servicios de Informacion) of the DGI
is responsible for Screening foreigners residing in Cuba
(except diplomats) for potential agents, Like the MO Depart-
ment, the BC Section makes no actual recruitments, but reports
potential agents to the Illegal or LN Department, according to
whether they are or are not affiliated with an organized group,

Persons volunteering information from abroad, The MO Depart-
ment is also responsible for screening letters from persons
abroad who volunteer information or support to the Cuban
Government. Its principal aim is to extract any useful in-
formation from such letters, but it also notes any persons who
appear to have agent potential and refers them to the proper
operational department for consideration,

Members of Communist Parties and organized leftist groups in.

Since there are no official Cuban misstons in Central
America, the agent nopaally makes his way to Mexico and obtains
his Cuban visa there. In order to keep secret from the author-
ities in his own country that he is going to Cuba, the agent
candidate gives another destination, and the Cuban consular >
offices help by issuing his Cuban visa on o separate sheet of

paper instead of stamping it in his passport.4 The agent candi-

date may pay his own passage, but usually he is supplied funds or

an airline ticket through a local DGI agent or the leftist group ‘
to which he belongs; the funds are issued by the Central Process-

ing Scetion, Whether he ts issued a ticket or given money to buy

his own, the funds originate with the DGI and are forwarded to

the candidate's area through the DGI representation in the Cuban

Embassy in Mexico.

consulate,”

DGI officers attached. to Cuban consulates are alerted to assist
agent candidates in their travel, The agent is given a password,
which varices from place to plac agents from El Salvador, for
example, are told to mention “Mauricio,” When a DGI officer at a
consulate interviews visa applicants, he expedites the visa for y¢
Anyone using the proper password; if the password is not used, he
stalls the applicant for several days while he cables Havana for
authority to issue a visa, If the visa is issued in Mexico, the
agent trainee is given a plane ticket on Cubana, the Cuban Govern-
ment airline, and is ‘cold when he is to leave. Accommodations and
subsistence ore provided if the trainee has to wait for passage.
Agent candidates from British Guiana sometimes travel to Cuba by
small boats, not regular shipping service.

Agent trainees going to Cuba use a variety of cover stories. For
the local authorities, their travel is to some other destination,
often as tourists, students, or laborers, For their own group,

no cover story is required; for their families and friends, tour-
ist or student travel is the usual explanation. For persons out-
side the group, if Cuba is known as the destination, the cover
story is a scholarship for study at a Cuban school or university,
Groups of trainees from the same leftist organization often travel
together from their own country to Mexico and thence to Cuba, but
intelligence agent trainees always travel alone,

Upon arrival at the Havana airport, trainees are met by DGI
officers appearing as ICAP officials, The DGI has an arrangement
with the Cuban immigration authorities under which persons of DGI
interest are cleared through entrance formalities without compli-
cations, The trainees are placed in hotels while final training
arrangements are made, then are transferred to the schools where
their training will be given, or to private houses or apartments
if they are intelligence trainees, The case officer from the DGI
department which will thenceforth control their activities is re-
sponsible for them during their stay in Cuba, Using the funds
allotted by the department, he provides them lodging, food, per-
sonal expenses; medical care, and anything else they need during
the training period; shoes, clothing, and personal items are
drawa for them from the DGI warehouse,

As far as possible, DGI trainees live the normal life of students
and use the cover story that they are studying on Cuban Government
scholarships, Their movements in Havana are not restricted,
except that arrangements are made to keep them away from fellow-
citizens visiting or living in’Cuba, Since most of their train-
ing is given in Havana, and the coursé is intensive, they do not

usually travel.to other parts of Cuba during the instruction
period, unless they are taken by the schocl te participate in
national campaigns for which all students are dratted, such as
cane-cutting and coffee-picking, After the triining course is
completed, if there is any delay in returning students to their
own country, they may travel outside Eavana; trips are arranged
and financed by the DGI liaison officer in ICAP. During délay
periods, however, they are at the disposal cf the school, which
may use them in “voluntary” campaigns er other ways, Guerrilla
agents of the same nationality are kep gether if they belong
to the same organization, but trainees from different erganiza-
tions of the same country are s«parated. Trainees of two nation-
alities are never put together, and forsigners are. never grouped
with Cubans, In both livirg quarters ard training, the illegal
intelligence agent is separated from guerrilla agents, All
trainees are enccuraged to have as little contact as possible
with persons outside. th sckool,

Upon arrival in Cuba, each agent is assigned a pseudcenym, which
he uses throughout his training. Actually, within the guerrilla
schools, Students in either large or small groups use their real
names, Since their identities are usuaily krnewn to their fellows
from earlier association or traveling together, The pseudonym is
primarily a means cf protecting ths Student from identification
by persons outside the school. For a time, the DSI used the
pseudonym only during the triining period and assigned another
pseudonym when the agent returned hom:, but the cent
ing separate files was so great that the training pset
adopted as perman=nt. Sometimes, howev=

Training of Guerrilla Agents

12,

13.

The LN Department, and specifically th- case ofticer in charge of
a group of agents to be trained as qu+rrillas, arranges for their
instruction in the EF Department (Department cf Special Schools -—
Departamento Escuelas Especiales) of the DcI,/ The case officer
himself does not conduct the training, which is entirely an EB
Department responsibility. The stud-nt group is assigned to one
of the EE Department schcois in Havana, by nationality; training
groups are as large as 25 and as small as three or four persons.
Courses last three to Six months, depending cn ths type of train-
ing and the ultimate mission cf the agen but in special cases
may last as long as a year (two Guatemalars re trained that
long). The instructors ar» ail military, drawn from the Cuban
army; there is one for each military specialty, and a political
anstructor,

Training covers all aspects of guerrilla warfar=, weapons hand-
ling, explosives, sabotage, demolition, military tactics, combat
engineering, etc., aS well as means of countering anti-guerrilla
activities, Weapons are of both Am-rican ard Communist-Bloc
provenance. Some specialized training 1s given, for example,
there is a school for frogmen at the mouth of the Jaimanitas River
in Barlovento, west of Havana, and two Guatemalans and a Dominican
were trained as frogmen during 1963. errilla agents de not
normally, however, receive any communications training (secret
writing, radio, etc.): when they return home, their channel of
communication for sending information and receiving instruction
and support is through the organized group to which they belong.

Practice im guerrilla warfare and weapons and explosives handling
is. given on the school premises in Havana, In addition, both dur-
ing the course and near its conclusion, groups of students are

> taken to the Escambray Mountains in Las Villas Province to put

thetr training into practice and to learn to live off the country.
They are integrated into regular Cuban army units ‘for short
periods and take part in any military activities then in progress,
During 1963, for exsmple, a group‘of Guatemalans and a group of
Salvadorians were taken separately to the Escambray and partici-
pated in the operations then being conducted by the Cuban army
against anti-Castro guerrillas in the area,

Guerrilla students are required to meet a standard of complete
familiarity with all the information and material forming part of
their instruction, Examinations are given regularly; students
who fail them are required to repeat the instruction. A student
may. have to repeat the entire course 1f he cannot pass the neces-
sary examinations, There are many failures. An agent candidute
who proves completely incapable of mastering the course is

* removed from the school, and an-effort is made to find him a

special job elsewhere, During the course, the instructors issue
monthly reports to the school administration, both on the course
as a whole and on the performance of each student. A copy is sent
to the case officer, Reporting on students covers personal
attitude, discipline, capability 1n study, political level, etc,

While guerrilla training is in progress, two special preparations
for the future are made, The first is the arrangement of the
agent's travel to his target area, either his own country or
another. Passports and other documents are prepared for his use
on the return trip; funds are allocated for his future activity;
and provisions are made for his carrying money or possibly special
equipment back with him if that is required. The second thing is
the assessment of the trainee for other possibilities, Through-
out the course he is observed and evaluated; if he shows more than
usual aptitude and ability, he comes under consideration as a

-potential intelligence agent for collection of information or

penctration of his home government. If a trainee is assessed as
Suitable for intelligence-agent work, he is removed from the
guerrilla course and receives special instruction for more
clandestine and more complicated tasks.

Training of Intelligence Agents

17.

Intelligence (illegal) agents, from whatever source they are drawn
(foreigners visiting or resident in Cuba, contacts of DGI agents
or organizations abroad, or guerrilla trainees selected for
superior abilities), come under the DGI [llegal Department, which
is responsible for their recruitment, training, and subsequent
handling. Since they are truly clandestine agents, their rela-
tionship with the DGI requires special security from its incep-
tion, They travel to Cuba alone rather than in a group, and in
Cuba they are kept apart from other persons of their own nation-
ality and from one another. Agents of Cuban nationality are also
kept apart from other nationalities and during training lead
normal lives as far as possible, Both Cubans and foreigners are
kept from.contact with the Cuban Government or official circles
to avoid suspicion of any government connection, As with guer-
rilla trainees, agents arc assigned pseudonyms for use with’ the
general public in Cuba and for use in field operations later,
Agents are not allowed any knowledge of any DGI installations

except the ones to which they are specifically assigned for train-
ing, ind never enter any DGI official establishment or the case

officer's home.

A foreign agent candidate arriving in Cuba is first debriefed by
the case officer on his background and qualifications, since up

to that time the DGI has only advance notice of his selection and
knows little about him, The interview ts recorded, but without

the trainee's knowledge, On one occasion in early 1964 a case
officer arranged to meet a new trainee in a Havana restaurant for
the preliminary interview,: The case. officer provided himself with
a@ pocket tape recorder, which he tested in advance and found was

in good order, When he started to record the interview, however,
he discovered that he had either forgotten to adjust the mechan-
isn after he had tested it, cr he pushed the playback instead of
the record button; the restaurant was suddenly electrified by a
voice saying: “Testing, ons, two, three: testing, one, two,
three." The interview was hastily concluded and was rescheduled ?
the next day in the safehouse where the agent, a Guatemalan, was
lodged: ‘in this case, of course, the agent was aware that it was
being recorded, The results of the interview are entered in a
biographical questionnaire covering all aspects of the agent's
family Situation, political viows, background and education,
employment experience, connecticns, and intelligence potential;

the document forms the basis of the agent's DGI personal file.

In addition, the agent is required to write a complete report on
the operational situation in his country, including types and
Styles of dress, eating habits, working beurs and holidays,
location of public buildings and places of entertainment, the
press ard its type and circulation, urban and rural transporta-
tron, educational facilities, airlines, personal documents for
idertification, and local linguistic idioms.

In cases where an intelligence agent is selected from among
guerrilla trainees, he may remain under the jurisdiction of the

LN Department, which retains him as a guerrilla agent but arranges

for his training as an illegal agent also, Training for intel-

ligence work, however, is always separate from guerrilla training

and is not revealed to the Communist Party or leftist group

sponsoring the agent, who becomes, in effect, a Semi-overt Cuban

agent in guerrilla activities and a clandestine agent in intel-

ligence reporting or other functions. One such agent, trained in

Cuba in 1963, was returned to the Dominican Republic about mid-

1963: he carries on revolutionary activities with the Dominican

Popular Movement (s#ovimiento Popular Deminicano - MPD) as a knowa
Cuban-trained guerrilla and at the same tine works as an illegaY

agent (under the LN Department), without the knowledge of his MPD t
colleagues, as a penetration of the MPD,

The ‘case officer from the Illegal Department arranges for the com- :
plete support of the agent during training, providing him lodging :
in 2 private house or apartment, supplying his food and clothing

and personal equipment from the DGI warehouse as is done for

guerrilla ageats, and kecping him in pocket money, If the agent

is married, the expenses of his dependent family are also covered

by the DGI, The case officer does not give any instcuction, but

arranges with the’ MI Department (Department of Technical Opera-

tional Support) of the DGI for training the agent in the skills

he will require for his future mission. The MI Department has no

schools or regular training Sites but uses private houses or

apartments, which are procured and maintained by the DGI General

Administration Department, The same safehouse is used for suc-
cessive agents, but only one is trained there at a time. Follow-
ing the agent's operational plan as laid down by the case officer,
the MI Department provides instruction in the necessary skills
through its own sections and vartous departments of the DGY out-

side the operational departments,

All illegal agents are trained in normal tradecraft elements such.
“as clandestine meetings, election and use of dead drops, recruit=-
ment of agents, establishment and operation of agent nets (only
for agents specifically intended for network direction), use of
informants and collaborators, photography. and some form of com-
munication, Practice in operational techniques such as surveil-
lance and counter-surveillance and servicing dead drops is given
in appropriate sections of. Havana, Each agent in addition is in-
structed on matters relating to his particular mission, and 1!
given whatever communications training he will need. Communica-
tions receives special-emphasis because all arrangements must be
made during the training period, Techniques include secret writ-
ing, codes and ciphers, radio transmission and reception, micro-
dots, and microfilm. Only a few agents are trained in the latter
two techniques, and not all are trained in radio, but almost all
receive instruction on seéret writing, which 1s the most widely
used means of communication between agents in the field and their
ease officers, The type of communications training the agent will
reccive is usually discussed with the case officer by the MI
Department, but sometimes the MI Department decides without con-
sultation and sometimes it consults the SI Department for opera-
tional background on the country where the agent will work,

The ST Section (Technical Section - Seccion Tecnica) of the MI
Department has the main responsihility for agent communications
training and itself conducts the training in secret writing. It
first requests the LG Section (Chemical Laboratory - Laboratorio
Quimico), of the MI Department to devise and prepare a Secret

vriting system-for the agent's use. Most systems depend on
sympathetic inks made with salt, blood, urine, and other materials;

the type assigned the agent. is determined by his mission and
operational situation, Each agent receives a different system,

. although two agents working in the same operation use the same

system, An agent normally learns two systems, one for incoming
correspondence, development only, and one for outgoing corres~
pondence, preparation only, In addition, if he is to direct an
agent network of his own which requires internal clandestine com-
munication, he is taught a third system, both preparation and
development, for use in the network. The case officer not only
doés not participate in the training but knows very little about
the secret writing systems, since the processing of messages from
agents in the field is handled by the ST Section and he receives
only the developed text, and the ST Section, for reasons of
security and compartmentation, refuses to teli the case officer
anything specific about communications,

The ST Section trains the agent thoroughly on the materials and
methods he is to use and gives him practice in processing messages
under direction, then in preparing test messages and in developing
and interpreting test messages prepared by the instructor, The
training period varies according to the complexity of the system
and the requirement for competence from the agent. In cases

where communications are of special importance, the instruction
may continue for two or three months with great detail, and the

‘Agents never write directly to BG1 headquarters; all their mail

in both directions goes through accommodation addresses,. usually
in another Gountry. Instruction in selection and use of accom
madation addresses is given by the MS Department (Department of
Legal Centers - Departamento Centros Legales), which handles DGI
{1@ld stations and theit correspondence, because. accommodation
addresses are usually in countries where Cuba has official repre-
sentation and the field station services the letter drops, Out-
going communications to agents go by diplomatic pouch to the field r
station and are dailed from there to the agent. Agent letters to
headquarters go to an accommedation address, where they are picked
up by the field station and forwarded by diplomatic pouch. The
country used for incoming communications 18 usually different from
that for outgoing: an agent in Fl Salvador, for example, may send
his reports to Havana via Mexico and receive headquarters direc-
tions and replizs via Paris, Tht MIS Department controls the
assignment of accommodation addr~sses. Since the DGI believes
that there is less disger of -sposing th agent if his cover
letters containing secret writing are as realistic and natural as
possible, the agent is briefed not only on the accommodation
address to which he is to write, but alsc on the parsons who
actually live there--ages, -ackgrcund, r-lationships, etc,--so
that he can refer te birthdays and personal int-rests or family
events, The agert is also taught selection of plausible but not
genuine return addresses for his outgoing communications,

Agents who are to learn cedes and ciphers and radio transmission
and reception are trained by th- ST Section, which has its own
radio transmitter for irstruction purposes, The radios the
agents use in training are prccured in their own countries and
are adapted for cland-stine use by the ST Section; most such
equipment is Western-made, ard much of it is American, The agent
learns transmission and reciption and also is taught how to adjust
a commercial radio to his individual requitrments and how to make
minor repairs on it. H- way learn the standard Morse code but
usually is taught a num-tical code arranged in groups, As with
secret writing, the ¢ efficer knows little about the actual
mechanics of the radic communications arrang-mentS because radio
messages are process-d cutsids the operational departments and
reach him only in the form of clear text, and because compart-
mentation keeps him from acquiring technical knowledge.
Similarly, he knows little abcut the proficiency required of the
agent and sees only the fina evaluation report prepared by the
ST Section for the agent's personal file.

if the agent is also to receive trdining in microfilm and micro-
dot techniques, the ST Section arranges with the LF Section

(Photographic Laboratory - Laboratorio Fotografico) of the MI
Department for the use of equipment and the assignment of a
system and then itself gives the training, The LF Section has

‘When guerrilla. agents have completed their training, the:LN

Department case officer briefs.the group. on.its mission in. its

tion of what support the group may ‘expect and tow it is to be
supplied, directions for -reperting.to thé sponsoring group,
advice on security and-self-protection, and.the travel route to
be followed, In addition, the group leader receives a-special
briefing on means of communication with DGI headquarters, special
arrangements for supplying the group or its sponsoring organiza-
tion, and perhaps the transportation to its home area of propa-
ganda or sabotage materials from Cuba, Although agents are
allowed to take notes during their training, they are not permitted
to carry any compromising material on their return home. All
final instructions are given orally and are memorized by the
agent. Actually, however, guerrilla agents do not always observe
security precautions about materials, One Salvadorian guerrilla

agent succeeded in hiding in his luggage a copy of the Manual of
Guerrilla Warfare he had used in his training course, even though
the case officer inspected the luggage while it was being packed.
The case officer commented that unless another inspection was
made at the time the agent left his quarters to depart the
country or at the airport just before boarding the plane, it was
impossible to prevent agents from carrying off such classified

matter,

Illegal agents receive a more intensive final briefing. The case
officer reviews with the agent the general mission and specific
tasks ho is to undertake, all of which have been covered during
training, such as collection of information on his home govern-
ment or specific organizations, penetration of official organs in
the country or perhaps the local Communist Party or a leftist
group, assistance in communications and forwarding of material,
etc, The briefing includes advice on security and self-protection,
refresher instruction on accommodation addresses for secret
writing correspondence, an explanation of the travel route for the
return journey and the documents to be used, and specific instruc-
tions for reporting to a group or commencing his assignment after
arrival, with a schedule for-initiating communications, depending
on his mission and his return itinerary, Illegal agents receive
their final instruction on communications two or three days be-
fore leaving Cuba, Instructions about frequencies, which are
assigned by the MI Department, and codes for radio communication,
procurement and preparation of secret writing materials, etc., are
photographed and prepared for the agent to carry with him in a
concealment ‘device, One agent returning to Salvador received his

29. If agents are not able to leave Cuba at once when they have com-
pleted their training, they remain under the orders of the school
if they are guerrillas, or cf their case officer if they are
illegal agents. They are permitted to travel in Cuba or are
assigned to public "voluntary" campaigns; the case officers try : y
to keep them busy, partly, at least, as a security precaution,
Delays in departure may be due to lack of suitable documentation,
difficulties in arranging air schedules, special situations in :
the home country, or physical disability of the agent--one agent, .
broke his leg while in Cuba and had to wait until he was able to u

travel,

30. The principal cause of delay in returning home ts lack of suit-
able documents,. The DGI case officer is responsiblo for procur-
ing passports for his agents' travel, but he is often short one
or two passports of the proper nationality, because procurement
crequires a longer time than the usual training period, For

- example, of a group of about 25 guerrilla agents from the
Dominican Republic who completed 1x mcnths of training near the
end of 1963, about ten were still in Cuba in April 1964 because
the DGI had been unable either to provide passports for their
travel or to arrange for their return home illegally, At that
. time the case officer was trying to have additional passports
collected and sent to Cuba via the DGI station in Mexico so that
the stranded Dominicans could travel.

Return Travel :

31, As noted above, while his training is in progress, arrangements :
are made to return the agent to his operational area. For
guerrilla agents, this is their own country and sponsoring group; :
for illegal agents normally 1t is their own country, but occasion-
ally, although rarely, one is assigned to another area, Guerrilla
agents who have been trained together may travel back as a group;
illegal agents always travel alone, All agents start their
journey by air to Prague, on Cubana Airlines, using false Cuban
passports," which they tugn over to Czechoslovak authorities on
their arrival in Prague.° From there, agents travel on passports
of their own or some related nationality, or even their own pass-
ports, containing entries carefully made to account for their
period of absence from their country without showing any connec-
tion with Cuba. Both passports are provided the agent by the case
officer at the time of the final briefing, when the travel route

is also explained,

“Ricardo” alt ate airline tickets and flight reservations;
the DGI retnburses ICAP for-any funds expended by "Ricardo" for
agent travel and handling. |

The processing of illegal agents is somewhat different from that
of guerrillas, They do not go through ICAP or come into "Ricardo's"
hands; the case officer, working through the DGI Central Process-
ing Section, takes care of procuring their immunizations, plane
tickets, and reservations, They are thus not exposed to any
Cuban agency outside of the DGI. The agent travels via Prague to
Western Europe and thence to his own country, At the final stage
of his journey, he may enter his own country illegally, As soon
as he is back and established, he is ready to initiate communica~
tions with DGI headquarters in accordance with the instructtons
he has received and using the schedule he carried with him in-a
concealment device, which is opened qnly when he reaches home.

A Cuban sent abroad as a DGI agent is considered an illegal agent
and does not go through ICAP processing for travel. He may leave
Cuba illegally; if he departs legally, he uses the normal route
via Prague but travels on a passport of another nationality than
Cuban, Of threé known Cuban agents prepared for assignment
abroad, one was scheduled to go to Mexico during 1964; the assign-
ments of the other two were not known, A Cuban agent abroad
uses the same sort of communications channels as an agent of
another nationality, according to the training he has received in
Cuba, He is reimbursed through the usual channels--funds sent
through a DGI field station, which for Latin America is always
Mexico; and in addition his family is supported by the DGI during
his entire period of overseas service, An ‘agent of foreign
nationality, once trained, is not expected to return to Cuba and
is considered an independent operator with no communication with
Cubans except through his clandestine channels, although in an
emérgency he is permitted to appeal to a DGI officer in an
official establishment if one is available, The policy regarding
agents of Cuban nationality had not been decided in early 1964,
since no such illegal agents were then operating abroad, It was
not certain, for example, how long the Cuban was expected to
xemain in place abroad nor whether he would be allowed access to

DGI officers in the field,

From 1959 to 1962 the Cuban foreign-intellixence service made
considerable use of shipping for sending its agents out of Cuba,

especially into the Céntral Am rican area and to the north cotst
of South America, Since 1962, however, the practice of sending
agents home as crewmen has materially declined and in 1964 was

used only occasionally. : :

Effectiveness of Training.

36.

The capabilities of both guerrilla and illegal agents trained by
the DGI vary greatly because. of differences in background, native
Capacity, and adjustment to discipline, The DGI has successfully
trained a few highly efficient agents, but some of its trainees

have not come up to expectations. One agent with an excellent

training record, of whom the case officer had high hopes, was.

arrested for participation in illegal activities after only a

short period of operation following his return home. Soveral

agents who were conSidered promising proved disappointing when

released from training supervision; one who was given funds to
Purchase @ radio spent the morey on himself and was in trouble y
with the group with which he Was affiliated because of his lack

of discipline; another was accused of having misused “funds en-

trusted to him for arms procurement and was also distrusted by

his group as cowardly and spiritless. As noted above, instruc-

tion in secret writing has not always been productive of readable
reports, The main difficulty appears te lie not with the quality

of the training but with the lack of discipline and loyalty of

the trained agent.

Headquarters Comments

1, For a discussion of the organization of the DGI and the
functions of its departments, from the same source, see
€3-311/00115-64.

2, Cuba has diplomatic r=lations, and hence consulates, in
Latin America only in Mexico and Jamaica (relations were
maintained with Brazil until May 1964, with Chile until
July 1964, with Bolivia until August 1964, and with
Uruguay until September 1964). Visas for Cuba can be
obtained only in those countries; most are~issued in
Mexico, because that country has the only direct air
connection with Cuba, :

Cuban handling of visas and documentation is discussed
at length by the same source in CS-311/00866-64, ‘i

During 1963, many travelers from Latin America were
taken to Cuba on chartered flights by Cuban aircraft
arranged to bring delegations to and from Cuba for Cuban
celebrations and .for the ccnventicn of the International
Union of Architects in Havana in September. For the
latter occasion, the Soviet ship NADEZHDA KRUPSKAYA
called at Santos, Brazil, to embark passengers for
Havana, Among the traveling delegations were Cuban
agents. :
