Capehart, again they were.reported to be from the New York or Cleveland area. Capehart then

became very irritated and demanded that the Sheriff's Dept. give him some type of protection

against these-men.

This time the City was searched for strangers matching the descriptions of out-of-town

style persons, but again failed to produce anyone.

R/O asked Capehart why the men would be looking for him and why they would be trying to

kill him. Capehart then told R/O that he had worked for the Central Intelligence Agency on

a number of occasions, but wasn't at liberty to discuss any of the activities. He did tell

R/O that he was involved in the Chile over throw during the Kennedy administration. At this

time Capehart must have felt he could trust R/O with this information and was comfortable

confiding in him about the matter.

R/O at that time called Thomas Walsh of the FBI at the Merced Office, and asked for a

background check on Capehart. Both Officers felt the information was prefabricated by Capehart

and required no further action.

During the latter part of October an informant came to R/O wanting to give information

concerning Capehart's activities.

She related the following account:

In the early part of July, the informant saw a number of photos in the Fresno Bee newspaper

the title of the article was asking for public identification assistance in naming the people

in the photos.

of him existed. Capehart then threatened the informant--only he and the informant-knew-about

the photos and the informant had better keep her mouth-shut. The informant indicated once.

Capehart saw the photos, that he decided he should leave town. He_didn't want to be matched up

with the photos in the newspaper.

Intelligence Agency or not..

R/O advised informant that he was going to attend the National FBI Academy in Washington

D.C. on January 5, 1979 and would take the available information with him.

On July 31, 1978, a photograph was published in the Fresno Bee with a request from the

Senate Assassination Connittee, for assistance in identifying the people in the photograph.

One of the photos was of Capehart, this disturbed the informant. Later when Capehart was

confronted, he at first denied but later adnitted that it was a picture of him. He made a

statement to the effect that Oswald was not the one that shot J.F.K., that there were two

other people in the building with him. Capehart stated that he was there but never would

tell the informant just why.

He stated you and I know I was there, but every one else believes

I was in Corpus Christy, Texas.

...

Concerning what is referred to as the C.I.A. Codes, the informant stated they were

copied from a paper in Capehart's filing cabinet, without his knowledge.

After his photo came out in the Fresno Bee, Capehart moved from the Chowchilla area, he

told the informant he was going to Arizona, but he didnot, instead he went to Las Vegas.

During this same period. Capehart aften called someone named Lee in Reno, When pressed

by the informant, Capehart identified Lee as a friend named LeBaron, who had obtained a ring

for him when he married Barbara. Informant stated that Capehart never would furnish any

additional information about this person,, and was reluctant to discuss him.

Informant recalls an article in the National Enquirer on January 23, 1979, stating that

Ervil LeBaron, a fugitive was a suspect in the J.F.K. case.

In the past the informant told Capehart that a letter had been written, setting out

everything, and that if any thing happened to him the letter would be sent to the authorties

Capehart has returned to Chowchilla on two occasions, once in October 1978--he assaulted

with the photos in the newspaper.

R/O advised informant that he was going to attend the National FBI Academy in Washington

D.C. on January 5, 1979 and would take the available information with him.

On July 31, 1978, a photograph was published in the Fresno Bee with a request from the

Senate Assassination Committee, for assistance in identifying the people in the photograph.

One of the photos was of Capehart, this disturbed the informant. Later when Capehart was

confronted, he at first denied but later admitted that it was a picture of him. He made a

statement to the effect that Oswald was not the one that shot J.F.K., that there were two

other people in the building with him. Capehart stated that he was there but never would

tell the informant just why.

He stated you and I know I was there, but every one else believes

I was in Corpus Christy, Texas•

_ Concerning what is referred to as the C.I.A. Codes, the informant stated they were

copied from a paper in Capehart's filing cabinet, without his knowledge:

After his photo came out in the Fresno Bee, Capehart moved fron the Chowchilla area, he

told the informant he was going to Arizona, but he didnot, instead he went to las Vegas.

During this same period Capehart aften called someone named Lee in Reno, When pressed

by the informant, Capehart identified lee as a friend named LeBaron, who had obtained a ring

for him when he married. Barbara. Informant stated that Capehart never would furnish any

additional information about this person, and was reluctant to discuss him.

Informant recalls an article in the National Enquirer on January 23, 1979, stating that

Ervil LeBaron, a fugitive was a suspect in the J.F.K. case......

In the past the informant told Capehart that a letter had been written, setting out

everything, and that if any thing happened to him the letter would be sent to the authorties

the informant, and entered the informants residence and searched it, apparently for the letter.

In February 1979, he flew to Fresno, rented a Hertz car and came to Chowchilla, but

informant avoided him.

On March 18, 1979 he was again in Chowchilla, and found the infommant at a friends

house--at this time he was wearing a gun--to avoid trouble there the informant agreed to meet

him later, but didnot.

Since that time informant has not seen or heard from Capehart, but fears him, and
