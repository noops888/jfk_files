1. The LIHUFF Project has been studied fully and
thoughtfully by Wil Division, including: a review by Oliver
G. GALBOND. It has also been discussed with the KU¥O0l
Staff officers who review such projects for approval”
After thorough consideration, it is the consensus“in
Headquarters that this Project “will not be ap)

2. The reasons for ext decision ar;

a. 10, .LIHUFF ganization fas sources of funds
other than .KUBARK and would congiict its activities
without support from KUBARK, project to fund the
oreo is therefore uy cessary.

feberat members of the LIHUFF organization are
1so members of the LISIREN organization. One of them
recently discussed the LISIREN operation with Thomas
_-~, A. BRENT in Headquarterg and is under no illusions about
\ opyorK funds, if not KUBARK funds, going into the
SIREN operation. xeover, the similarity of funding
Hechanisus between JASIREN and LINUFF, the similarity of
operations, and otWer such parallels would, for a think-
dig Mexican, be mére than coincidence and would eventually

rob LIHUFF of anf cover that it might have. The potent.ial
security problea is not justified.

c. Many of the activities contemplated in LIHUFF
are already fully covered by other operations of the
Station. LIHUFF would not contribute enough beyond the
overlap to be justified.

d. The Project would tend to put too much reliance
on conservative olements, around whom we have already
built a sizeable proportion of our program in Mexico.
Headquarters does not wish to expand further our involve-
ment with these elements.

e. We have noted, in both LIHUFF and LISIREN, the
reluctance of Mexican busineszmen to contribute to anti~
communist programs because they cannot deduct the contri-
butions from their income taxes. As a matter of principle,
we are moved to ask why ODYOKE funds should be spent in
any program--whose primary objective, after all, is to
preserve the capitalistic system under which these
Mexican industrialists hold and increase their affluence-~
4f those who will benefit most materinlly and most
directly from it are unwilling to contribute without
gome recompense. Should the PBPRIME taxpayer assume
the burden of helping those who are unwilling to share
that burden? We feel he should not when he bears such
a heavy burden all around the world.

3. The lack of a formal project relationship would not
prevent the Station from using the LIHUFF organiztion from
time to time on a targets-of-opportunity basis, as has been
done in the past. In such cases the Station could use its
D & TO funds. This use should be limited, and the outlay
of funds should be minimized as much as possible.

4. The contribution of Station funds for the publication
of Identity A may continue to the end of F¥ 63. Beginning
1 July 1963 we would like the Station to phase out this
expense at whatever rate seems most suitable, but the phase-
out should be completed by 31 December 1963. Further contri-
butions cannot be authorized beyond that date.

5. Please inform us of the Station's intentions regarding
LIHUFF-1. He can be kept as a cutout to LENUFF, but with the
curtailment of KUBARK's connection with LIRUFF, his services
will not be used enough to justify the salary that has been
proposed. The Station may either reduce his salary or use
him more fully on other operations in order to justify it
The latter, of course, is contingent on his suitability.
in terms of security considerations, his aptitude for certain
types of operations, his own preferences, time available, and
80 On---to serve other cperations. If the Station cannot make
profitable use of LIHUFF-1 in other operations, it may termin-
ate him at its discretion. If the Station plans to keep
LIWUFF-1, he should be placed under a project as soon as his
operational use is determined. If it is not feasible to put
him under the project that he will be working on, then a
separate project should be written to cover him.
