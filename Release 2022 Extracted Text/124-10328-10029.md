that file reflects on @ etx that Richard Townsend

Patton was employed by Carl Marzani in 1947, the year {
that Harzani wes convicted and sentenced for denying v
wembership in the Communist Party. Jt is noted your relet 7
reflects Fatton was subject of aninvestigation by

iad office in 1956 for possession of abscene filmss

n view of derogatory information available regarding
Patton, the Bureau does not feel he is suitable material
for development as on informant and authority is

therefore denied your office to investigate him as a
PSI for the purpose of possibly Géveloping him as a double

agent in this matter. Sureau is armanging for

interview of Isa Sabbagh by another Government agendy
and results will be furnished yous (S)

PATTON volunteered that he had two more rolls of similar

film in his car, also obtained from OFFAR, and produced those
rolls of film, An examination of all three rolls indicated
they were copies of well known editions of pornographic film.
It had been copied on film belonging to Byron, Incorporated. 63)

OFFAR was also interviewed at that time and said he
had obtained the films from EDDIE REYNOLDS,a former employee
who was then in Tennessee, _ The films were confiscated by
Inspector BLICK and no further action taken. ($

training films for the FBI and has clearance for similar work
for the Armed Forces. 6)

3809, asking directions to her home. She was told the address

_ was 2008 Bradford Drive, and they er oar (a) whetherssomething
