The answers to the ARRB questions will be shared with the ARRB staff on Background Use Only basis. An unclassified
memorandum for the record will be prepared by the ARRB for public. A classified version may be prepared and place in secure storage at
National Archives. Information and any documents will not be attributed,to the Mexican government; one proposal is to attribute the
material to the station's files with no date. The Agency will have the opportunity to review the drafts of the memos. To date the ARRB
Staff have been very responsive to our concerns when preparing these type memos.

Some followup questions on the ARRB query: How will the answers to the 10 questions be used? Will the answers just be used by the
staff, or will they be made public? {If public, in what form?) What about attribution: will the involvement} a if the Mexican government in
providing the answers/be made public? Will the information be attributedfto the Mexican government:

Please note that the{Mexican Fore (may be.called upon by the opposition-controlled congress in the next couple of weeks or

So to testify in open session about CIA involvement in Mexico} This would greatly raise the political profilefof any business we do with )
{ the Mexican governmenijlespecially something like the ARRB stuff that might become public.)
