The answers to the ARRB questions will be shared with the ARRB staff on Background Use Only basis. An unclassified

memorandum for the record will be prepared by the ARRB for public. A classified version may be prepared and place in secure storage at

National Archives. Information and any documents will not be attributed, to the Mexican government; one proposal is to attribute the

material to the station's files with no date. The Agency will have the opportunity to review the drafts of the memos. To date the ARRB

staff have been very responsive to our concerns when preparing these type memos.

Some followup questions on the ARRB query: How will the answers to the 10 questions be used? Will the answers just be used by the

staff, or will they be made public? (If public, in what form?) What about attribution: will the involvementlot the Mexican government in

providing the answers he made public? Will the information be attributedio the Mexican government?

the Mexican governmenj especially something like the ARRE stuff that might become public.)
