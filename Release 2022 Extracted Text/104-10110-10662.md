1. In connection with the 1975 proceedings of the
Presidential Commission on CIA Activities Within the United
States (Rockefeller Commission), memorsnda under the caption
of Alleged Illegal Domestic Activities were prepared by the
Office of Security on a variety of different topics or subjects.
The memoranda were numerous, detailed, and many had attachments
or information concerning two or more subjects or topics.

2. The above memoranda may or may not have been furnished
in toto to the Rockefeller Commission. The memoranda were
transmitted through the DDA to the Inspector General with a
certain number to the General Counsel and were not directiy
furnished to the Rockefeller Commission by the Office of
Security. Due to the extreme urgency and complexity of tie
above memoranda, it was not possible to document many of the
pertinent security files.

3. In order to alert OS professionals that information
concerning a specific individual or organization was prepared
in connection with the above investigation, a copy of this
memorandum is being placed in each pertinent security file
(where a file exists). In general, the information furnished
was based on information available in the particular security
file, but additional research in other Office of Security files
was involved in a number of instances. In the event of future
detailed interest in a particular file, a copy of al memoranda
prepared in connection with the Rockefeller Commission investi-
gation is retained in the office of: the DD/PSI. In addition,
SAG is at least temporarily maintaining a copy of the majority
of the memoranda and can also be of assistance.
