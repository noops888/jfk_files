Lee Harvey OSWALD first came to themimgmmaSts attention

upon receipt of AIRGRAM no. 1301, dated 31 October 1959, from the
‘United States Embassy in Moscow, in which it was stated that
OSWALD had appeared at the Embassy on 31 October to renounce his
American citizenship. He stated that he had appléed in Moscow
for Soviet citizenship after his arrival in the Soviet Union on

15 October. The first public reference to OSWALD appeared in the

Washington Post of 1 November 1959, ~

On 2 November 1959, the FBI liaison officer Tequestedya ._

trace be run on Leé Harvey OSWALD in the Aggmmmmis central hold-
ings. @g™ response on 4 November was negative.
Because of the counterintelligence implications of

OSWALD's action, the Counter Intelligence Staff opened an offi-

cial file on Lee Harvey OSWALD to accommodate biographic infor-
mation developed by the Agency in response to a Department of
State inquiry, dated 25 October 1960, on a list of American de-_
fectors in Soviet Bloc countries. OSWALD's name was one of those
appearing on the list. CIA forwarded an interim reply on 3 :
‘November 1960; a final reply on 21 November 1960. Until early
“October 1963, the contents of the OSWALD file held by CIA consis-|'

the Cuban Consulate could grant him a visa and arrange

immigration details if the concession of a Soviet visa were

assured.

b. 27 September. Pursuant to her inquiry, Silvia DURAN

received a confirmation from the Soviet Embassy that the

American had been to the USSR installation. He had shown

them a letter from the Soviet Consulate in Washington indi-|~

cating that he had been long awaiting a visa for himself -

and his wife to go to the USSR. No answer had come from

Washington; however, the waiting period was sometimes four
or five months. The American also had a letter attesting -
that he was a member of a pro-Cuban organization but he had

claimed that the Cubans would not give him a visa unless he

had already received a Russian visa. —

Although the American was still at the Cuban Consulate

visa unless a Soviet visa was forthcoming, notwithstanding

the American's wish to go to Cuba to wait there for his

Soviet visa. According to DURAN, the American knew no one

in Cuba and she inteded to make an appropriate annotation

on the Americans card. The Soviet official echoed her

statement that the American was not known.

c. 28 September. Silvia DURAN was again visited at

the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City by the American seeking a
Cuban transit visa. Mrs. DURAN contacted at least two mem-

bers of the Soviet Embassy and facilitated a direct con-

versation between one of the Soviets and the American.
Speaking in poor-Russian, the American stated that he alrsuc

ready had been to the Soviet Consulate and had left an ad-

dress, The Soviet official replied that he was aware of

that. The American suggested that he had not known his

address then, and he had gone to the Cuban Embassy to ask

for the address, because they hhd it.

On Saturday evening, 7 September 1963, Fidel CASTRO ap-

peared at a Brazilian Embassy reception in Havana; even more un-

Press correspondent, Daniel HARKER.

The interview also contained an uncomplimentary reference

t Senator GOLDWATER and Cuban delay in signing the Limited nuclear

test ban. There were differences in the replay by United States ;

newspapers like the New York Times and Washington papers, with a----

result that CATSRO's "message" was significantly modulated.

, In New Orleans, where Lee Harvey OSWALD resided until the l
