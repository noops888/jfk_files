reports which appear to have been accurate,

1. Field Comment. On the basis of conversations with different
Cuban Government officials Source gained the impression that
the FALN is possibly the primary recipient of Cuban support;
the prize for Castro is big, but the more important reason
for supporting the FALN is its fairly effective organization,
which continues to operate in Venezuela,
