Dear Adniral Turner:

The Select Coumittee On Assassinations has subpoenaed

His appearance is

scheduled for Wednesday, November 2, 1977 at 9:30 a.M. It has

been alleged fIos nUmerous sources that Mr. Trafficante was

involved in various activities in conjunction with the Central

Intelligence Agency.

I would appreciate it if you could determine whether or

nor Santos Trafficante, in any manner, had any relationship or

was ever affiliated with the CIA and inform me of this informa-

tion prior to the scheduled meeting on Novenber 2.

Further, even if lI. Trafficante had no relationship with

the CIA, he may believe that actions he has taken were at the

direction of responsible persons in the Central Intelligence

Agency..

Accordingly, in order for the Select Committee to

obtain Mr.. Trafficante's truthful testimony, it would be most

•useful for the Committee to have a letter from yourself re-

• leasing it. Trafficante of any obligation of secrecy he nay

.. have made to the CIA, to anybody who represented himself as

being affiliated

lieves was affiliated with the CIA.

cante's scheduled testimony. .

Thank you for your continued cooperation in the Select

cormittee's
