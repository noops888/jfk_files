Saturday the 23rd of November the day after the assassination th

Traitor (Fidel CASTRO) hurriedly appeared on television to mako eh

the subject was always the same... KENNEDY had been killed by reactionary

"On the 22nd of October 1962, during the crisis, KHRUSHCHEV

capitulated and promised KENNEDY first to withdraw the missiles.

then the bombers, and last the troops.. Then CASTRO screamed like

mad, rushed to the TV cameras, rebelled like a beast, and said that

'no one could inspect him'... 'the discrepancies between Cuba and the

USSR would be discussed between eguals,' and other similar things.

First sign of rebellion against the master who has sold him down the

river and who begins to abandon him.

"Later on MIKOYAN comes to Cuba and stays here for over a month

without being able to get absolutely anything from CASTRO, he even had

to withstand the humiliation of having to wait for hours to be received

by CASTRO. Second provocation.

"Between July and August 1963 the traitor (CASTRO) 18 taken to

the USSR almost by force on a mysterious trip from which he returna.

without revealing absolutely anything. Later on the nuclear test ban

treaty 1s signed. CASTRO immediately refuses to sign it, claiming that

while 'Yankee Imperialian' does not stop 1t8 aggressions against Cuba

he will not algn. In addition, he also refused to support in the united

Nations the resolution concerning the creation of a denuclearized sone

in Latin America.

"What lles behind all these happenings? Very simple. CASTRO has

known since the 22nd of October 1962 that the USSR is going to abandon

him, gradually but definitoly. At this moment the USSR 1s most of all

Interested in an approach to the United states in view of ite ideological

break with Red China and of the serious econonic crisis which it has

been facing for some years.

"That was the main reason why KENNEDY did not invade Cuba then,

and that was his wisest decision. At that time: the break with China

was imminent and under no circumstances could happenings be provoked

which might tend to again unite the USSR and China.

"It was necessary to 'freeze' Cuba for some time. The break took

place on 14 Jun 63 through the famous letter with the 25 points of the

Chinese Communist Party to the Soviet Communist Party which document

I have in my possession. Therefore, with that maneuver KENNeDY did not

humiliate the USSR and saved KHRUSHCHEV's face.

"pany did not understand this, and that brilliant man was strongly

criticized and accused

of being weak. One must remember that above

Cuba, which 1s only a peon in the international cheus board, much

higher interests had to be safeguarded. It was necessary to destroy

the myth of the 'monolythic unity' of the Communiat world, which the

communists have tired of proclaiming, and in the end it was necessary

to show that thay are also filled with great contradictions and to

direct the global strategy against the leading enemy which is

International Communism.

"Hell, CASTRO knew this well and he was beginning to get scared

because he understood perfeatly that when the USSR withdrew its last

soldier the count down would begin for him (CASTIl.

of the USSR and the U.s., by the lessening of world tension as result of

or coldness between both giants?..China and CASTRO. Who were urgently

interested in provoking a transcendental event which might result in

the break of those tles?...China and CASTRO. The event took places

KENNEDY was agsassinated. However, the United States were sware of the

sinister plot and did not fall in the trap.

"The same night of KENNEDY's death the state Department published

a note saying that 'no foreign power had been involved in the assassina-

tion. ' The USER was immediately pulled out of the affalo..

The suspicion

which bagan to arise was stifled.

"Iater On MIKOYAN and JOHNSON had an interulew, and when HInOyAN

came out he declared that 'relations between both countries remalned

unchanged. ' However, In all his appearances CASTRO continued to

insist that 'plans had been directed against Cuba, the USSR, and peace.'

By all maans he wants to pull the usse down with him. Note the insistence

They attack suddenly without caring

about the immediate consequences. Therefore, one must immediately

discard the theory that it was a fanatic. Everything seems to indicate

that KENNEDY's assassination was a political assassination. a portaica,

sasassination.

(according to Dr. Jorge Muxo

Reyes)

"KENNEDY' & assassin was nothing but an instrument in the hande

of a sinister organization which sought higher objectives.. The objective

could not be other than to produce a break in the good relationg between

the United States and the USSR by those who might benefit polltically

from this happening, CHINA and CUBA are the koys to the enígma. All

this will become known very soon, sooner than we imagine.

"There 18 also the inoldent of the Mexican employee of the Cuban

imbassy in Mexico City, and the angry reaction of Cuba through ice

Ambassador ROs when they learned that she had been arrested. The

diplomatic note was written in an angry and rude tone. Mexicans are

called the 'accomplices of KENNEDY's reactionary assassins' and it

Interferes in the internal affalrs of Mexico. Then, there was some

truth in the connection between this and that. they could no longer

deny that OSWALD had requested

a Cuban visa, but they claim that they

refused to give him one. Is this true?

"In my opinion, the assassin planned to escape and to seek refuge

here (Cuba), maybe even under a fictitious name. Everything le possible

with these people. The aiplomatic note also tries to involve the USSR.

and we are back at the sane thing. At a given moment, such a transcendenti

happening as KENNEDY's death could suddenly provoke a collective histeria

In the United States and maybe even provoke a confrontation with the UssR..

Therefore, It was a diabolical scheme leading to achieve an effeative

happening which might benefit someone politically, and that someone could

be MBO and fidel.

"The objective might have been rapidly attained. Violent break--

almust a state of war--between the U.s. and the USSR, and, naturally,

the immediate beginning of an almost hot 'Cold Mar' with the subseguent

support of all of KHRUsHCHEV's missiles to the tottering Cuban regime.

Of course, this would be a brilliant and possible play in the case of

an extremely dangerous paranoic.

"The Venervelan Case.

"What a coincidence? Two days after KENNEDY's funeral a

transcendental announcement is mades Venezuela officially accuses

Cuba of landing a huge cargo of arms in that country. All the teams

get mobilized and the immediate order is given to have a meeting of

the security Council of the O.A.s. All this happens with the speed

of lightning. The cache of arms was discovered on the 2nd of November

1963, but the

transcendental step was not given until now.... In my

opinion, that was the Plan which KENNEDY was holding in reserve. But

KENNEDY had more time to carry it out, and JOHNSON does not have so

much time, and besides, it is necessary to act while things are hot

and that is why it was advanced. Now I do think that the crucial

moment has come! The mouse fell in the mousetrap with cheese and

everything! It will be very difficult for CABTRO to get out of this

ambush.

"Besides, many doubts and prejudices which we had been dragging

for a long time now begin to get clarified. That was the Plan! Get

CASTRO to accomplish something of such magnitude that it would affect

all Latin American countries, so that all would have to adopt collective

measures. The Plan was COLLECTIVE ACTION. That is why the Americans

were opposed to actions by Cuban exiles. That is why they persecuted

then. That is why KENNEDY rejected the idea of an invasion by the U.s.

It was necessary to wait for the opportunity, and they waited for it.

Everything will take place in the eyes of the world with the evidence

on hand, according to law, that la the objective of Article 8 of the

1947 Río de Janeiro Mutual Assistance Treaty. America has in its hands

the legal instrument to do justice against Communism. It is a case of

flagrant intervention in a country which is a signer of the Treaty by

one which does not respect any Law and which has placed itself outside

the law.

"If CASTRO has been shouting since the 2nd of December of 1961

that he 'is a Marxist-leninist,' the fact is that he does not know

absolutely anything about that. This gentleman has never been more

than a university hoodlum, a bourgeois with free registration in

Havana University. That is why those who were hunting him let him

loose. It was necessary to wait patiently for him to make a mistake.

and in the end he did make it. Fighting in Venezuela 18 a completely

erroneous fight from all viewpoints, but in order to show that we are

not--like they say we are--resentful bourgeois we are going to prove

it from the Marxist-leniniat viewpoint.

"The CHINssE have sald the following about thies 'He uphold that

in the fight against Imperialian, strategically, considering the whole,

it is necessary to have contempt for the enemy, to dare fight againat

him and to conquer victory. And at the same time, tactically, in each

concrete struggle, it is necessary to take the enemy seriously into

account and to adopt a conscientious and prudent attitude. Tactically,

if the enemy is not taken seriously into account, and one acts in a

rash manner, and if at the same time one does not dare to have contempt

for the enemy strategically, one will inevitably commit the mistake

of Adventurousness In Tactics and of Capitulationian in strategy.'

And comrade MAO also has to say the following about tactios in his

select works, 'If we do not act with prudence in each particular case,

in each concrete problem, we do not take care in studying and in

perfecting our art of fighting and we do not pay attention to winning

all the allles which must be won (small farmers, small artisans and

Independent merchants, middle bourgeosie, students, teachers, professors

and intellectuals in general, simple public servants, professionals.

and sensible persons), we will make a mistake of leftist Opportunism.

"But MI. Pidel CASTRO was a magnificent Marxist-Leninist and the

result 1a8 nothing more illogical than what is being done in Venezuela.

How is it possible for a Marxist-leninist-even for a first grade one--

not to be aware that this type of tactical fight is only possible within

a Dictatorial System, a System of the TRUJIIO type, a STROESSNER type.

or a duvaLIER type?

"How is it possible in Venezuela where BETANCOURT was elected

through clean elections, and who is now going to hold elections and

will turn the reigns of the Government over to another person or to

another Party? Only a cretin will think of it. Tactics are erroneous

and falls frankly into the worst kind of Leftist Adventurousness. CASTRO

has dug his own grave.
