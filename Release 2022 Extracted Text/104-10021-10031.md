"On the 22nd of October 1962, during the crisis, KHRUSHCHEV
capitulated and promised KENNEDY first to withdraw the missiles,
then the bombers, and last the troops. Then CASTRO screamed like
mad, rushed to the TV cameras, rebelled like a beast, and said that
‘no one could inspect him'...'the discrepancies between Cuba and the
USSR would be discussed between equals,‘ and other similar things.
First sign of rebellion against the master who has sold him down the
river and who begins to abandon him.

“Later on MIKOYAN comes to Cuba and staye here for over a month
without being able to get absolutely anything from CASTRO; he even had
to withstand the humiliation of having to wait for hours to be received
by CASTRO. Second provocation.

“Between July and August 1963 the traitor (CASTRO) is taken to
the USSR almost by by force on a ‘nysterious trip from which he returns
without revealing absolutely anything. Later on the nuclear test ban
treaty is signed. CASTRO immediately refuses to sign it, claiming that
while ‘Yankee Imperialism’ does not stop its aggressions agains
he will not sign. In addition, he also refused to support in 7
Nations the resolution concerning the creation of a denuclearized sone
in Latin America.

“what lies behind all these happenings? Very simple. CASTRO has
known since the 22nd of October 1962 that the USSR is going to abandon
him, gradually but definitely. At this moment the USSR is most. ofall
interested in an approach to the United States in view of it 4 <
break with Red China and of the serious economic crisis which it has |
been facing for some years.

“That was the main reason why KENNEDY did not invade Cuba then,
and that was his wisest decision. At that time. the break with China
was imminent and under no circumstances could happenings be provoked
which might tend to again unite the USSR and China.

“It was necessary to 'freeze' Cuba for some time. The break took
place on 14 Jun 63 through the famous letter with the 25 points of the
Chinese Communist Party to the Soviet Communist Party--which document
I have in my possession. Therefore, with that maneuver KENNEDY did not
humiliate the USSR and saved KHRUSHCHEV's face.

the immediate beginning of an almost hot ‘Cold War' with the subsequent _
support of all of KHRUSHCHEV'’s missiles to the tottering Cuban regime.
Of course, this would be a brilliant and possible play in the case of
an extremely dangerous paranoic.

"The Yenesvelan Cases

“What a coincidence? ‘Two days after KENNEDY's funeral a
transcendental announcement is made: Venezuela officially accuses
Cuba of landing a huge cargo of arms in that country. All the teams
get mobilized and the immediate order is given to have a meeting of
the Security Council of the 0.A.8. All this happens with the speed
of lightning. The cache of arms was discovered on the 2nd of November
1963, but the transcendental step was not given until now.... In my
opinion, that was the Plan which KENNEDY was holding in reserve. But
KENNEDY had more time to carry it out, and JOHNSON does not have so
much time; and besides, it is necessary to act while things are hot
and that is why it was advanced. Now I do think that the crucial
moment has come! The mouse fell in the mousetrap with cheese and
everything: It will be very difficult for CASTRO to get out of this
ambush.

“Besides, many doubts and prejudices which we had been dragging
for a long time now begin to get clarified. That was the Plan: Get
CASTRO to accomplish something of such magnitude that it would affect
all Latin American countries, so that all would have to adopt collective
measures. The Plan was COLLECTIVE ACTION. That is why the Americans
were opposed to actions by Cuban exiles. That is why they persecuted
them. That is why KENNEDY rejected the idea of an invasion by the U.8s.
It was necessary to wait for the opportunity, and they waited for it.
Everything will take place in the eyes of the world with the evidence
on hand, according to law; that is the objective of Article 8 of the
1947 Rfo de Janeiro Mutual Assistance Treaty. America has in its hands
the legal instrument to do justice against Communism. It is a case of
flagrant intervention in a country which is a signer of the Treaty by
one which does not respect any Law and which has placed itself outside
the law. :

“If CASTRO has been shouting since the 2nd of December of 1961
that he ‘is a Marxist-Leninist,’ the fact is that he does not know
absolutely anything about that. This gentleman has never been more

than a university hbodlum, a bourgeois with free registration in
Havana University. That is why those who were hunting him let him

* loose. It was necessary to wait patiently for him to make a mistake,
‘and in the end he did make it. Fighting in Venezuela is a completely

erroneous fight from all viewpoints, but in order to show that we are
not--like they say we are--resentful bourgeois we are going to prove
it from the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint.

“The CHINESE have said the following about thie: ‘We uphold that
in the fight against Imperialism, strategically, considering the whole,
it is necessary to have contempt for the enemy, to dare fight against
him and to conquer victory. And at the same time, tactically, in each
concrete struggle, it is necessary to take the enemy seriously into
account and to adopt a conscientious and prudent attitude. Tactically,
if the enemy is not taken seriously into account, and one acts in a
rash manner, and if at the same time one does not dare to have contempt
for the enemy strategically, one will inevitably commit the mistake
of Adventurousness in Tactics and of Capitulationiem in Strategy.’

And comrade MAO also has to say the following about Tactics ‘in his
select works: 'If we do not act with prudence in each particular case,
in each concrete problem, we do not take care in studying and in
perfecting our art of fighting and we do not pay attention to winning
all the allies which must be won (small farmers, small artisans and
independent merchants, middle bourgeosie, students, teachers, professors
and intellectuals in general, simple public servants, prof ssionals,

and sensible persons), we will make a mistake of leftist Opportuniam.'

“But Mr. Fidel CASTRO was a magnificent Marxist-Leninist and the
result iss nothing more illogical than what is being done in Venezuela.
How is it possible for a Marxist-Leninist--even for a first grade one--
not to be aware that this type of tactical fight is only possible within
a Dictatorial System, a System of the TRUJILLO type, a STROESSNER type,
or a DUVALIER type?

“How is it possible in Venezuela where BETANCOURT was elected
through clean elections, and who is now going to hold elections and
will turn the reigns of the Government over to another person or to
another Party? Only a cretin will think of it. Tactics are erroneous
and falls frankly into the worst kind of Leftist Adventurousness. CASTRO
has dug his own grave.
