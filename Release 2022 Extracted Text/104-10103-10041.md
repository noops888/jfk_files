SUBJECT: Conversation with Sam Halpern -

1, Imet with Sam Halpern for about 20 minutes this morning

his new assignment as DC/DCD, I told him generally about our
attempt to reconstruct Howard Hunt's assignments and financial . e
transactions, and asked him particularly for recollections he may - eee
have of Hunt's assignment in Spain in mid-1965 to the fall of 1966. 0 ws

the National War College which began in August. He did not return

to that office until the end of June 1966.

°° 3, Halpern observed that-during this period Karamessines .~
was ADDP with Helms moving up to be DDCI. He thought it entirely
possible that Helms and Karamessines could ‘have handled this .
on their own. : : ae ites zreiiiece

of the DD/P shortly before Helms became DDCI, and had returned -
from Honolulu for that purpose. He stayed on for FitzGerald, until

someone might talk to)/Evart Parker)who may have known something
abnut it (although he may not). He also suggested talking to Georgia.
