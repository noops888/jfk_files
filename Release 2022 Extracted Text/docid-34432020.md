Bautzen/Sa,
Ziegelstrasse.
25. 11. 57.

Herr Gottschalk,
I am writing this letter to day for Maggie and no

- I thought that you of all.peopel were our friend
It seems that you have been getting ‘letters from Bautzen saying that
we have been selling every thing
All I ask of you is cone hear at Xmas and see for yourself what kind
of house we have but if you believe what other peopel say about us
and what you have told the Murphs to tell Maggie not to write or ask
any thing from you again then you and your dom family over there can
all goe to hell I shall tell you now that Margrit and I make, seven
hundred Dm in the month and we have some monoy in the Banke
but if you want to believe the other peopel \
Only always remember Magge is your sister but you had better believe
that I will take good care of her and to hell with you and your fanily.

Mr J Downie
(Posteript inserted by Margot GOTTSCHALK. )

| Ihr braucht keine Angst mehr zu haben das ieh an Buch schreibe
oder fragen werde, Ich lebo mit dem Jimmie hier und ihr dort.
Wenn Du kommen willst, kannst Du kommen. Wenn nicht wissen wir
Bescheid. Aber Thr habt fir frende Leute nehr Ubrig als fir uns,
So denn also Auf-wiedersehen flr inner

Margot.

(DOWNIE continues his letter - page 3)

Margrit has wrote goodby for ever I hope you are dom happy about it
But for me I wish that all the ill luck that is goeing comes your
family way
You dont know me right ore you would not treet Magge the way you
are doeing
for me the dom lot of you are egal
But I am very sorry for Margrit that her own brother will not have
ony thing more to do with her : — a
‘if you are angry because I wrrvé like this Iam not worryed but
think of your sister :
Iwas hopeing to be your friend always but you better believe I
rather have a swine for a friend than to have a freind who would
turn against his om sister
I dom well hope you can come between now and xmas
we have a lot to talk over Herr Gottschalk
I will look for an answer schnell

J Downie.

You need not have any fear any longer that I wiff/d? agk you
(anything) again. I live here with Jimmie and you (live) there,
If you want to come (to Bautzen) you can come. If not, then wa
will know where we stand (idiomatic translation). But you have
more time over for strangers than for us. Well then,

Goodbye for always,
Margot.
