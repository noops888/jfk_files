i. Here is the XUTUBZ draft paper preparsd by Paul V. LEVISTZR ||
avter bis recent visit ‘to your Station. “it haa bad the’ benefit of
valuable suggestions from the cesk. It has been read with intereat by
senior KUBARK officers who think the paper illustrates the essentials
02 good tap operations. The stress. of the paper is on intelligeace
collection, but some mention had to be made of operational leads and
CI/CS information, otherwise we yould have had only a partial picture
of tne operations. fe will appreciate any comments or corrections you

wish to make. Ye vent to present the trve facts and convey the right.
Lapression,

2. Waving paid this tribute to honesty, ve will zdmit Having
departed frca the facts ia a few instances, ia the interest. of. sinpli-
dication. One was the question of reels and transcripts, and reels
clone (semes 17, 32 and 42); we did not wish to confuse the reader with
this distiaction, The other was the collection and distribution of
reels and translations, which is somewhat sore complex then the
syaceduxa deseribed in the text; we 3refe
reader and ourselves in those double and triple wingback formations
exacted oy Repert 3. RIGGS and Jeremy 3. NIARCOS oa theiz say to work
ia che torning and sosetines during the day.

co. There are a jew points on which we were not sure, for instance
: Stamary account of the station's strength given om pages 46-47.
islt that such ca account wis necessary once the reader had an idea
2 the size of the éperations ard the saount.of work involved; vithout
such ga& serount be might have assumed taat the station in gvestion was
a¢ OF oox very largest. “nere is aisa the question of the exact
composivion of tae iatercest canter—at tse start, and now, I? there
iS anything missing (or mot accurately described) that would els other
ations to improve their own operations at this key polat, we would ‘
iike very mech to potuit in, Bon Paes " 4

4. ¥imally, there wae the question of the Polish lines, on which
o\ the files are mystifying. The 1960 Project Renmewal- request meations
,ITEFSOR'D desixre to cover those as well as the other twe, but subse—
Guent correspondence omits all uention of Polish lines. Did he really _
mention the Polish target? if so, how did ve manage to get out ‘of 1t?

3, The tough problem, of course, will be to sanitize the paper
without downgrading the operations. The essence of the message is

that so much can be done, and dene vell, by relatively fewrpeople,
provided these few people have the right skilis and sufficient drive.
ve might omit all references to Latin America, the Spanish Junguage,

and Cuban case officers; we might even throw in a few misleading phrases
like “the far-away Cuban target." We certainly would not want the
location to be recognized except by persons already familiar with the
operations. We will be guided by your wishes in this and other aspects
of the paper.
