H : The following, according to @ is the F
general status of the investigations on the leads

provided in the AELADLE cas=:

ol a
ots Gécuamiks set up a special ARLADLE section
‘ under (@MIMPED! comprising research and investigative
3 functions, which is physically segregated from other
(JAGUAR) sections. The personnel of the former{D-3) re~
Bearch section were brought into the AELADLE section™4
and all’ normg}(D-3) research ca Soviet and satellite
1.8. has been suspended. The personnel of the ARLADLE
section are listed in the attachment (under separate
“ cover),

2. Foreign Office: Research and background
checks are being conducted on all personnel who served
in Moscow in the period in question. This is a tre-
mendously difficult job atid will take months, and the
Foreign Office category apparently will present the
most difficulty in localizing possible suspects. The
three following possible suspects are being recalled
from their posts in the field and are under investiga-
tion with a view to their eventual interrogation:

promise for turning up a spy in this area in view of
the documents passed. However, he has only been able
to narrow it down so far te cightcon possibilities,
none of whom have anything leading to suspicion in
their files. He foresees, nuturaiiy, considerable work
in narrowing ?t down any turthor,

S. Helsinki and Vienna: Since AELADLE was able
to furnish nanes: or identifying information for this
category’! (SMIMPEDE stated he has about fourteen specific
cases thus far which will be given intensive investiga~
tion, le feels it possible that this may result in un-
covering three or four agents from the fourteen cases.

6. Guurrepe) g) stated that he believes it fortunate
that the AELADLE defection occurred at this time be-
cause it is bound to have a definite long-term value in
the tightening up of British security practices which
he felt were very insufficient. He bemoaned the fact
that he does not yet have a clear cut case (resulting
from the AELADLE material) to table at this time to add
further support to the recommendations made by the
Radcliffe Committee.

ren YELS discussed the AKLADLE case with him
on 5 Sankt GMIMPED2) was still under the impression that
AELADLE was refusing to talk. Having been ‘so,informed
by FERNICH that very day, FELS tgla Guryoepa nae
AKLADLE was again cooperating./| SMIMPEDE) would like at
sone time to talk once more with AELADLE to review the
informaticn developed so far; in fact, let- him in on
the whole investigation in the hope that this will jog
his mexory and stimulate him to further revelations.
