On November'1, 1961, when selyn McCollum watched

is reported to the F.B.I., there was no apparent result.

November 22, when five students were arrested for

was nurtured in crisis and developed larger objectives,

those of full equality and untarnished human dignity.

° Where Was the Federal

Over 700 Negroes in Albany, and a few sympathetic
whites, spent time in prison in December of 1961, as a mass
substitute for -federal action to compel recognition of a
legal right. peeees

F all the forces involved in Albany, the national government

is the only one whose actions do not match its expressed
convictions. The Negroes of Albany have strained to the limits of
their capacity to endure pain and rebuff. The white community
vhas behaved in accord with the customs of the majority of southern
whites in resisting attempts to change the status quo. The chief of
“police has acted like a chief of police. But the federal government
has not operated according to its pretensions.

The national government has failed to protect the liberties of
its citizens in the city of Albany. From the fecbleness of its actions,
a detached observer might conclude that the federal government
‘is still operating under the Constitution of the United States as once
expounded by Chief Justice Taft. a :

The First Amendment of the constitution of the United States
says: “Congress shall make no law . .°. abridging the freedom of
speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to as.
semble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.”
Supreme.Court decisions in the early part of this century made it
.clear beyond question that these rights of free speech, petition, and
assembly, are also guaranteed against state or local action by the
words of the Fourteenth Amendment, that no state shall “deprive
any person of life, liberty, or property, with due process of law.”
In Albany, hundreds of Negroes were locked up in some of the
most ‘miserable jails in the country for peacefully attempting to
petition the government for a redress of grievances. Is the national
government powerless to protect the right of petition?

Section 242 of the U.S. Criminal Code, which comes from the
Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Enforcement Act of 1870, creates
a legal Basis for federal prosecution of: “Whoever, under color of
any law . . . wilfully subjects . .. to
the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or
protected by the Constitution and laws of the United States... .”

- 16 days of confinement for

police of the city of Albany, by arresting’ Ne

groes and whites in
connection with their use of the terminal faci

ilities in that city,

- violated a right which has been. made clear beyond a shadow

of a doubt in the courts, and nailed down tight by a ruling of the
Interstate Commerce Commission. Yet, the federal government took
no action,

When a sheriff, in the presence of witnesses,

lapped a young

Negro for asking the right to sing and pray in prison, the federal .

govemment was silent. “Throughout the December troubles, there
were phone calls from the Justice Department to Governor Vandiver
and Mayor Kelley, conversations between the Department and leaders
of the Albany Movement. The FB. dutifully sat in its office im
Albany and took dozens upon dozens of affidavits from Negro citizens
complaining that their constitutional rights had heen violated by city
and county officials, But eight months later, there was not a sign
of action on these charges,

In the spring and summer of 1962, Inndreds of Negroes, and -

some whites, were again deprived of their constitutional rights by
city and county officials, They were put into jail again and again
for taking actions Supposedly protected by the First and Fourteenth
Amendments, A pregnant woman was beaten, a lawyer was caned,
a white youth had hi jaw and ribs broken, three young people were
forcibly dragged from a courtroom under the eyes of a county judge.
Still no action, Eighteen-year-old Cordell Re. san, a veteran SNCC
worker, emerged from Dougherty County jail in late August, after
contributing to the -delinquency of a
minor” (which, translated, meant that Reagan had beer sitting on
the fender of ‘a nearby car while two students were picketing a
theater) made this éomment to me about the Department of Justice
and local police: “They're letting them get away with murder,”

In December 1961, in the ‘midst of hundreds’ of jailings in the :

Albany demonstrations, the New York Times reported from Albany:
“The Justice Department was watching developments here closely.”
In September 1962, after shotgun blasts ripped into a home in Terrell
County where Negro and white registration workers were staying,
a Justice Department spokesman said in Washington: “We are watch.
ing the situation very, very closely.”

In June 1962. six months after several flagrant violations of the
ICC ruling, the Atlanta Journal's Washington ‘correspondent report-
ed: “The U.S. Justice Department has launched an investigation of
alleged bus station segregation in Albany.” In July, several Justice
Department lawyers avere sent to Albany. On the 26th of that month,
according to an Atlanta Constitution report, -Albany’s Mayor Kelley
conferred in W hington with Attorney General Kennedy. The Con-
stitution said: “Kelley said he told Kennedy that Albany's racial
problems are dealt with by local people. Kelley said Kennedy agreed
with him.”

Atlanta Journal Washington correspondént Douglas Kiker report-
ed in July: “Justice Department officials described the Albany trouble
Monday as ‘a tense situation’ but added that Mayor Asa Kelley and
Chief of Police Laurie Pritchett ‘have certainly indicated a strong
desire to maintain order.” They said they had received no evidence
that Albany police are not furnishing adequate law protection.” This
was immediately after attorney C. B. King, with more than 100 city
and county police nearby, had received his bloody beating at the
hands of the Dougherty County sheriff: Kiker disclosed that the De-
partment of Justice was “investigating” the beating of King. But if
there was ever a ‘case where one, hour of investigation’ would be
sufficient to establish grounds for federal action, this was it.

“Near the end of the summer, after receiving dozens of dngry
telegrams, after the picketing of the White House by citizens from .
both North and South, and after face-to-face pleas from Roy Wilkins
of the NAACP and William Kunstler of the American Civil Liberties
Union, the Justice Department made two legal moves: 1) it entered
a friend-of-the-court brief to support the Albany Movement's request
that an injunction against further demonstrations be denied; and
2) it asked for an injunction (after a violation of voting rights in
Terrell County so outrageous that usually calm reporters on the

+ Scene were upset) to prevent certain officials in southeast Georgia

from interfering with registration activities,

The available administrative machinery for enforcing federal
law should be outlined: the Department of Justice has the duty to
enforce laws passed by Congress and provisions of the U.S. Con-
stitution. In the Department there is a Civil Rights Division, headed
by an Assistant Attorney General, which handles the bulk of the legal
work of the Department dealing with civil rights cases. The Division
depends for its information on another branch of the Justice Depart-
ment, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which has offices in cities
all over the country. F.B.I. agents undertake investigations on orders
from the Department, to determine if federal law has been violated,
The F.B.I. can make arrests, usually on orders. from the Department,
sometimes on its own in situations of urgency. After investigation,
in civil rights cases, it is up to the Civil Rights Division to decide
whether prosecution should be initiated. If so, this is usually done
through the United States ‘Attorney in that judicial district, who
prosecutes the éase in federal District Court, after indictment by a
grand jury or the filing of an information. Also upon the Depart-
ment's advice or order, the U.S. Attorney may file civil suits (al-
though this may be done by a Civil Rights Division lawyer from
Washington) asking that the federal court issue injunctions forbid-
ding certain parties to engage in specified practices which may de-
prive individuals of their rights under the Constitution. Attached
to the federal district court are U.S. marshals, who serve subpoenas,
give notice of injunctive action, and otherwise carry out the orders
of the court or the Attorney General. From District Court, there is

PAGE 28

HW 68262 Docld:37989659 Page 16



the right of appeal to the Court of Appeals, and then, in certain
cases, to the. United States Supreme Court.

The Department of Justice has on occasion defended its restraint
in the Albany situation ‘and in other crises by the following argu-
ments, which deserve examination and reply:

1. Argument:

Reply: |

2. Argument:

Reply:

3. Argument:

Reply:

Prosecutions in the Deep South stand little:
chance of succeeding, since juries are white and
prejudiced.

Even if acquittal results, prosecution may act
asa deterrent. Right now, southern police of-
ficers, knowing the government's reluctance to

* prosecute, feel free to do as they wish with

Negro citizens, and Albany has demonstrated
this.- If nothing else, a series of Prosecutions
would exert a powerful educational and moral
force in a situation where Negroes feel deserted
by the national government and southern whites

“are not clear where the government stands,

The Supreme Court decision in the Screws case
of 1945 interpreted section 242 in such a way
as to make convictions difficult, because of the
need to show “intent” on the part of the ac-
cused, with. “intent” interpreted very narrowly. |

The only way to get new interpretations of the
law is to bring new cases before the courts,

The Department of Justice needs specific leg-
islative authorization’ from Congress—as it has
in the-Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960 re-
garding voting—to take injunctive action against
Jocal officials in other situations involving civil

. tights and civil liberties.

In the Debs case of 1895 there was io specific
legislative basis for an injunction; yet the Su-
preme Court ruled that the federal government
could get one, saying: “Every government . . .
has a right to apply to its own courts” in mat-
ters which the constitution has entrusted to the
care of the national government, The Court
said: “The entire strength of the nation may
he used to enforce in any part of the land the
full and free exercise of all national powers and
the security of all rights entrusted by the Con-
titution to its care,”

The government may choose to interpret
its ‘own, powers narrowly, or it may interpret

NW 68262 Docld:32989659 Page 17 : PAGE 29
7 c



them broadly. The degree of its compassion may
dictate the choice. When you combine the pres-
ent reluctance of the Department of Justice with
the unhesitant exercise of power by local police,
the result is to blind the First and Fourteenth.
Amendments with the first flash of a police of-
ficer’s badge. a

Moreover, Albany ‘has implications for
an freedom beyond the question of equal
s for Negroes, Can American citizens, any-
where in the land. have freedom of speech and
assembly in the face of a determined police
force and an -uncertain national government?

4 Argument: Our federal arrangement requires that the na-
7 tional government should interfere as little as
possible with “local” situations.

Reply: It was precisely the purpose of the Fourteenth
Amendment to take the enforcement of racial
equality out of the hands of local governments,
which had proved the most flagrant violators,
and put ‘ultimate authority in’the hands of the
national government. Local governments may
do anything they want in the field of ordinary
crime. They’ may punish people for disorderly
conduct, for blocking sidewalks, for disobeying
police officers. But the moment such offenses

. ae applied to one race in away that they are
not applied to another, the Fourteenth Amend-
ment is violated, and the federal government,
with all the power at its command. has proper
constitutional jurisdiction. To take the view that
the arrests’ of Negro citizens, for reasons ob-
viously connected with their race. are purely
“local” matters, is to take a pre-Civil War view
of the American federal system.

5. Argument: There is no need for, federal interference so
long as large-scale violence does not break out,
so long as local police maintain order.

~ Reply: IE the government's only requirement is the

: maintenance of “order,” even without the ex-
istence of freedom, then we have moved close
to the ideology of the totalitarian state.

* Something needs to he said about the role of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, and then about the influence of the President of
the United States.

are the most frequent violators of the rights of Negroes in the South.
Fhe Comission suggested the possibility of “a new administrative

arrangement within the Department of Justice to case the problem
gents having to investigate police officers with, whom they
work daily on other cas :

ion on Civil Rights im- >

One solution might be the creation of a special corps of federal
| agents—similar to the T-nen used by the Treasury ‘Department—for
the sole purpose of enforcing federally guaranteed constitutional rights
i y parts of the country where they are consistently violated.
ents need not be “outsiders,” for there is a whole new genera-
img Southerners—Negro and white—who are intelligent,
courageous, capable, and genuinely concerned about civil rights, and
from whom such agents could be selected. The F.B.1. is most cf-
fective as an agency for the solution of ordinary crimes, and perhaps
it should stick to that.
As for the President, of the United States, he could play, but so
far has not played, a key role in crises such as Albany. The Commi:
sion on Civil Rights last year called for “the exertion of leadership
by the President and others in the National Government. . .. These
recommendations are based on the belief that the Presidency, and
indeed the whole Federal establishment, is preeminently a place for
moral leadership. The Commission-has been impressed with the
fluence which those in responsible positions can exert _on the civil
rights climate of the Nation. By using the instruments for education
and persuasion which are available to them they can stir the conscience
of the country.”

President Kennedy's first substantive public statement came after
eight months of trouble in Albany when, responding to a question

-show a real burst of energy; that was when M.

at his August 1, 1961, press conference, he called the situation “un-
satisfactory,” declared he could not understand why Albany city
officials would not negotiate with Negroes, and said: “We are going
to attempt as we have in the past ‘to .try to provide a_ satisfactory
solution for the protection of the constitutional rights of the people

of Albany, and we will continue to do so.” The trouble with’ this

latter statement was that “in the-past” the national government had
done extremely little, and if its future attempts were to be of: the
same magnitude, this avas a puny promise indeed.

In another press conference on Thursday, September 14, 1962,
again in response to a question, President Kennedy strongly de-
nounced the burning of the Negro churches in Lee and Terrell
Counties, calling the actions “cowardly as well as outrageous.” This
was commendable. But it also ‘indicates the level of tolerance at
which our national Ieaders—and perhaps most white Americans—
operate. They will be aroused by open violence, particularly against
places of worship (Governor Vandiver of Georgia, hardly a friend
of the Albany Movement, offered a $250 reward for the apprehension
of the arsonists), But théy will not be made sufficiently indignant
by mass jailings. by the deprivation of free speech and assembly,
by beatings and intimidation, by the perpetuation’ of segregation.
The nation as a whole—not only the President—needs to expand its
capacity for outrage.

+ Only once in the Albany troubles did the national administration
in Luther King, Jr. .
was jailed on July ‘10: The President ‘asked for a report, the Attorney
General got busy, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of civil
rights made phone calls, and the next day King was out of jail. But
there was no such deep concern for the hundreds of ordinary citizens ,
in Albany who went to jail about the same time for basically the
same reason. Special favors to distinguished individuals are too easy
a substitute for genuine assistance to troubled groups. Jackie Robin-
son, who last summer received elaborate greetings from the President
on the occasion of his election to the Baseball Hall of Farne, noted

the Albany situation and wrote: “Id rather have freedom than
flowers.” :

- The President's general silence, (except for the. two instances
noted above) and the fecbleness with which the Justice Department
has acted are often attributed to the practical realities of national
politics, which require, it id, that the President woo the support
of Southerners in Congress for other laudable national goals. But
there are some means so morally hurtful that they corrupt the ends.
Besides, there is serious reason to doubt that the Administration
gains substantial advantage from such tactics. The Senators from

‘the state of Georgia had an opportunity, in 1961, to vote on 12 key

issues important to the Administration:

1 they both voted with the
Administration in only two of the 12 ir

ances, and these were farm

‘bills that they probably would have supported in any event. In a

third case, on the housing bill, Talmadge supported the. President
and Russell did not. °

Finally, it can be argued that the President's concern for civil
rights and his concern for political advantage are both demonstrated
by his choice of federal judges, knowing clearly that those appointed
in the South will have tremendous authority over the progress of
race relations, and will é it for many years. Certain judicial ap-
pointments of. this Administration have appalled Southern liberals.

The federal government, if it wants to, can take the following
actions in Albany:

1. Begin immediate prosecution under Section 242 of local
officials who have deprived Negroes of their constitutional rights in
the Albany area. Such trials, since they involve misdemeanors, do -
not even require grand jury indictments, but may be initiated on
the presentation of an information by the Department of Justice, and
the Commission on Civil Rights has urged this procedure “in appro-
priate cases.” The F.B.I. has in its hands piles of affidavits from Albany
citizens—accumulated over a period of nine months—testifying to vio-
lations of federal law; but the Justice Department has not acted.

2. Station in the area a substantial number of federal agents
to protect citizens from intimidation, beating, and false arrest. Such
agents should not confine themselves to standing by and taking notes,
which the F.B.I. has been doing on aceasion in the Deep South in
the midst of scenes of brutality, but should have the authority to
make arrests on the spot.

3. Go into federal court and ask for injunctions to prevent
local officials from a) enforcing segregation statutes, and b) inter-
fering with peaceful ‘assembly, picketing and speech. Violations of
such injunctions would then be subject to judicial punishment with-
out trial. Both such legal actions have been initiated by the Albany
Movement, but they could have been started by the federal govern-
ment last. December, and should now be backed by it. The govern-
ment, after prodding, did enter a friend-of-the-court brief in a de.
fensive action against the city’s attempt to make démonstrations
punishable, but has not taken any steps to make peaceful assembly
a positive right. 7 '

4. The President should address himself directly to the people
of Albany, white and Negro, speaking forthrightly about racial dis-
crimination, making it plain to Albany whites that they are entitled
to express their views and hold their private beliefs, but that public
law now entitles Negroes to equal use of all public facilities, and
that the entire power of the federal government will stand behind
this. The Southern Regional Council, in its report The Federal Execu-
tive and Civil Rights, said: “The South should be informed where

- the President stands... . The millions of Southerners, white and
Negro, who want to break loose from enfeebling customs, would
respond with gratitude to Presidential leadership.”

judges. Judgeships left vacant are preferable to those filled for life

PAGE 34

5. There is a procedure outlined in the U.S. Attorney's Manual,
Title 10, Civil Rights Division, which says that where there is in-
sufficient evidence for Federal prosecution but “repetitive civil rights
violations” , the U.S. Attorney may initiate a mediative con-
-ference “with responsible local officials.” The manual says: “Situations
in which su conference may be useful include thése involving
enforced 1 segregation and illegal police practices... .” Tt says *
further: “Such a conference should serve the purpose of putting the
officials on notice regarding the applicable federal laws and giving
them an opportunity to remedy the situation. ...” Le would be difficult ,
indeed to think of a situation more badly in need of such a procedure
than Albany this past year, but there is no indication that the De-
partment of Justice has used it, choosing instead to rely on informal
~and incffectual—efforts at mediation. 1

6. The President should refuse to appoint segregationist fod:

by men who, on their public record, are ‘opponents of racial equali

7. The Commission on Civil Rights might well investigate the
Albany situation and make appropriate recommendations. There are
a hundred potential Albanys in the Deep South.

These proposed actions require boldness, imagination, vigorous
initiative—preciscly those qualities that were promised by Mr. Ken-
nedy in his campaign for the Presidency. As yet, however, no New
Frontiers have been carved out’ in the social wilderness which sur-
rounds Albany, They will probably he established, as elsewhere in
the Deep South, by determined Negroes and farsighted whites, com.
pelled by court rulings and smoothed by compromises, but with that
intermittent conflict, and suffering, which accompany progress. What
the-government can do is help ease the pain.

Based on ail available information from the FBI and othe

satellite. If the Sovict troops left Cuba and
i€ Cuba started moving towards a. ‘Titoist
type situation, do-you sce the possibility of
perhaps coexistence?

itt PreswwenT. It is very difficult to base,

a future policy on presumptions which are
not today realized. The fact of the matter
is the Soviet troops are there. The fact of
the matter is that Cuba does follow a satel-
lite role, and that is what we consider un-
acceptable to us, I would hope that the
situation some day would change.

{24.] Q. Mr. President, Governor Rocke-
feller and Senator Goldwater are sharply
divided on what sort of an appeal the Re-
publican Party should make to the South
in 1964. Perhaps this question will be faced
by you next year, and { wondered whether
you plan to cither repndiate or reject thie sup-
port and the votes of segregationists in the
South. 7

‘THe presipint. F think that the record of
this administration on this matter of equal
opportunity is so well known to everyone,
North and South, that in 1964 there will be
no difficulty in identifying, the record of the

“Democratic adininistration, what it stands
for. And my judgment is, based on history,
that the Republican Party also will make a
clear stand on this issue. 1 would be sur-
prised if they didn’t.

. [25-1 Q. Mr. President, in the last
week the Governor of Alabama, the ‘Gov-
ernor of Mississippi, and the Attorney Gen-
eral of Arkansas have all testified before the
Senate Commerce Committee insisting that
the integration move was Communist:
inspired. And this has led to some fears on
the part of some Senators that we niay be
centering into a period of McCarthyism that

Public Papers of the Presidents

will submerge this issuc. Will you, com-
ment on it?

THe prusipEnT, The fact of the matter is
that the Communists attempt, and obviously,
to worm their way into every movement,
and particularly to worm their way into
those movements where there is an ob-
vious—where there is trouble.
think that the relatively few remaining
Communists in the United States, and they
are very few, I would think that they would
attempt to take advantage of whatever dif-
ficulties may arise in the United States. But
1 must say that we looked into this matter
with a good deal of care.

We have no evidence that any of the
Jeailers of the civil rights movements in the
United States are Communists. We have
no evidence that the demonstrations arc
Communist-inspired. There may be acea-
sions when a Communist takes part in a
demonstration. We can’t prevent that, But
I think it is a convenient scapegoat to sug-
gest that all the difficulties are Communist
and if the Communist movement would
onty disappear that we would end this.

‘Fhe fact of the matter is, it is casy to
blame it on the authoritics in Washington,
it is casy to blame it on the Atorney Gen-
cral or the President, and say, “If they would

just stop aalking about these things the prob-

Jom would go away.” The way to make

the problem go away, in my apinion, is to.

at the request of formér Deputy Attorney General William™’

Thomas Martin in.the Civil Division, of the Department.
telephonically adviséd on 9/26/75 that he had been designated
to coordinate the arrangements for legal representation for cur-
rent and former Bureau personnel. He stated he had retained
former Special Agent Marcus A. Hollabaugit to represent W. Donald ‘'
Stewart in his interview by the Senate Select Committee at lO a.m.
on 9/29/75: Martin indicated he had-done this because of the im-
mediacy of the problem confronting Stewart in his interview con-
cerning mail openings. It was apparent that the consideration in
this instance to hire private counsel was dictated by the topic
of Stewart's interview i.e. mail openings which is under review
by the Department to determine if criminal conduct exists.

Martin indicated in the future the retention of
outside or private counsel will be done through consultation
with the Bureau. He asked that the Bureau make the necessary
arrangements to grant clearance for Hollabaugh to receive
whatever information might be necessary for him to effec~
tively represent Stewart's interests in this matter. Legal
Counsel, Division in conjunction with the Special Investigative
Division has made the necessary arrangements. ee

suimarize or quote from conversations monitored during

1 - The Attorney General

NOTE:

The attachment to the LHM, paper. found in Sullivan's
office, suggests from its content that a facsimile of that
paper may have been used in the mailing to the King family
a tape resulting from microphone surveillance of King. A
copy of the paper in question is being filed with the yellow
of the LHM. The Whitson matter referred to concerns infor-
Mation Whitson had given us concerning the results of an
interview of him by the SSC Staff when he told them he had
mailed a package to the King family on behalf of Sullivan
and there is a strong possibility that package contained a
tape.

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

Regarding Item 4, names of FBI personnel appearing
in the lower left-hand corner of the AG note dated December 10,
1965,. cannot be furnished positively. However, the names
“Phillips and "Bates" probably referred to:

Seymor Fred Phillips, currently assigned to the
Intelligence Division, FBI Headquarters, Weshington, D. C.; and

Richard F. Bates, Special Agent in Charge, Boston
Fleld Office. :

With respect to Items 5 and 6, the FBI employee who
entered the name "Martin Luther King, Jr,,' on the December 10,
1965, note was F. Madeline Wilkerson, ratired file assistant,
Efforts were unproductive to identify the FBI employee who
entered the names "Martin Luther King,Jr.,"" and "Nicholas deB,
Katzenbach" on the July 22, 1969, note to Miss Gandy. On both
documents these names were hand printed by clerical employees
called file assistants to indicate subject of the file and to
determine cross indexing needed.

,

Regarding Item 7, we are unable to determine the
circumstances surrounding the Xeroxing of three copies of the
December 10, 1965, memorandum to Mr. Hoover, We are likewise
unable to determine whose initiels appear below the questioned
Xeroxing notation,

With respect to the excisions in materials being
delivered herewith, where no notation appears as to reason
for excision, the excision was made for the reason that the
information actually summarizes or quotes from conversations
monitored during electronic surveillances of King. In some
cases, {t can be ascertained precisely what information in
FBI files came from electronic surveillances of Dr. King;

NW 68262 Docld:32989659 Page 78


a a fe, de ifeatesaee e

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

however, there exist areas where documentation of the
information is not precise and no eccurate determination can
be made, Therefore, no assurances can be given that portions
of the materiel being furnished do not contain information
developed as a result of electronic surveillences of King. -

The remaining materials in the SSC request relating
to King are receiving continuous attention and the results will
be furnished on a periodic basis es soon as possible,

Memorandum from Mr, Cregar to Mr, Wannall bearing _ Director Sec'y
this caption dated August 28, 1975, approved a briefing and

granting access to Senate Select Committee personnel relative

to incommunicado interviews,conducted in the "Karot," "Hecklar,"
"Gunson" and "Gleme" cases

This briefing was given on September 9, 1975, to
Mr. Loch Johnson and Mr, James Dick of the Senate Select
Committee. At the outset of the briefing, they were advised
that the Department of Justice is conducting an investigation to
determine whether any criminal culpability is involved regarding
surreptitious entries conducted by the Bureau in the past,
They were also advised that the Bureau is granting them access
to certain selected material obtained from the official files
of the Bureau, They requested that the material in question
be held for them, and they would make arrangements to review
this materiai at a later date,

During the initial portion of the briefing, I explained
to them the nature of an "illegal" in Soviet espionage; the
importance of an illegal, and the difficulty of his detection.
Details of the Karot, Hecklar, Gunson, and Gleme cases were
furnished, The Senate Select Committee personnel asked numerous
questions one) answered to the 7 ability of my

recollection 7 La sfbE 3 ¢ 94%

Mr. Johnson was Go 408 culariy anxious to know whether
the CIA had knowledge of the existence of the illegals prior to
their interrogation, At one point he stated that the Ltack"of
such knowledge could be a pressure point in relations, betw
the FBI and the CIA. When asked to explain, Mr. Tonrison sev esas
it was obvious that the FBI was seeking the cooperation of ithe, mamsco

SECRET

Memorandum from Mr. W. A, Branigan to Mr, W. R, Wannall
RE: INCOMMUNICADO INTERROGATIONS

illegals to remain in the United States whereas the CIA would

want the illegals returned to the Soviet Union, I explained to
Mr, Johnson that the illegal's mission by their Soviet service

was directed to activities in the United States and their

values to an American service in the Soviet Union would be
considerably limited to the compartmentation of the Soviet service.

The Senate Select Committee personnel were extremely
interested in the number of personnel and the composition of
the interrogation teams, They inquired as to the pressures which
were exerted during the interviews, They were assured that any
pressures were of a psychological nature only and that these
pressures were self~imposed by the nature of the illegal's
assignment to the United States and the fact that he had been
uncovered by the FBI and the further fact that the FBI could
prove the false nature of his legend,

At one point during the briefing, Mr, Johnson inquired
as to the Bureau's knowledge of CIA employees employing
incommunicado interviews and he specifically referred to such
an interview which was set forth in the Rockefeller Commission
report. I advised Mr, Johnson that I had no knowledge of
this interview.

In discussing the resettlement of the Karot informant,
the Senate Select Committee personnel were advised of CIA's
responsibility in this regard based on National Security Council
Directive, Mr, Johnson raised a question as to the bona fides
of defectors, and I advised him that this was not within the
purview of the briefing of incommunicado interviews.

The Senate Select Committee specifically inquired
whether Mr, Hoover had cut off incommunicado interviews in 1966,
They were advised that this was not so, They also asked whether
the Bureau might employ an incommunicado interview in the future,
I advised them that if the circumstances were such that we were
confronted with an illégal whose mission in the United States was
unknown and who could disappear from FBI coverage with relative
ease, we might favorably consider an incommunicado interview,
with Attorney General approval, if this would be in the best
interests of the country.

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

Regarding Item 3c of the request, it is noted that
Alton Wayne Roberts was never an informant of the FBI bit he
did cooperate by encouraging his brother, Raymoad Roberts, to
assist the FBI. Raymond Roberts is currently a productivd FBI
informant as is Gordon Clark. In view of theit current informant
status and the confidential relationship currently in effect
between this Bureau and these sources, information supplied by
them is not: being provided at this time as disclosure of such
information could adversely affect ongoing investigations and
jeopardize their-cooperativeness and/or productivity. For your
further information, a review of pertinent files fails to-
reflect that Gordon Clark furnished any information during the
period May 1, 1968, to August 31, 1968, In view of the possible
serious consequences both to the informants themselves and to
ongoing FBI investigations, it is requested that the information
concerning the current informant status of Raymond Roberts and
Gordon Clark be closely held.

With regard to Item 4m, it is noted that David Richard
Sannes was never an FBI Headquarters-approved informant.
aid furnish information to the Seattle FBI Office concerning
‘New Left" matters for a four-month period in 1970, for which
he refused to accept compensation. The following fa @ summary
of the information furnished to the Seattle Office on the dates
indicated:

. On April 18, 1970, Sannes telephoned notifying of
the location of fugitive Charles Clark Marshall III.

On May 24 and 25, 1970, Sannes telephoned advising he
had seen fugitive Michael Justesen at the University of Washington.

On May 26, 1970, Sannes appeared at the Office
furnishing personal background information. He offered to
provide information on the Seattle Liberation Front. He was
provided an unlisted phone number to call and was told to use
the name "T-Jay" when he called.

in writing, which would coincide with the aforementioned topic of interview.
He described these interviews as being "abuse" interviews which according.
to the Committee's understanding precludes the presence of an-agency _
representative during interview. However, an Agent may be available for
consultation purposes. hee

/ Mr. ell was advised by SA Daly that former Assistant. 7

ito the Director”Be ib in poor health and that before attempting interview

{GEM Belmont, he should ascertain his current physical condition, Mr. Seidell

? Ed CeCe Te EEET Mr. Belmont's physical condition. Assistant
Director |Cleveland advised SA Daly on 5-30-75 that Mr. Belmont was very
seriously ill and was. suffering from the Shy Drager Syndrome. This informa-

‘was lbrought to th Iliff, Task Force Director on

Domestic Intelligence Activities of captioned Committee, and Elliff expressed

(nurs ame that Seidell had made an inquiry concerning the interview of Belmont.

Iliff requested that we not take any action concerning Seidell's request as
Belmont at this time.

to

Former SA David E. Todd had previously contacted this’
Division and as set forth in memorandum dated 5-16-75 from Legal Counsel
to J. B. Adams, he was advised of his rights, the existence of an employment
secrecy agreement signed by him, of the provisions of Attorney General
Order 501-73, and to his right to a private attorney. He was also advised
that an Agent would be made available for consultation during the interview
if he so desired. Mr. Todd did not indicate at this point whether he was
desirous of having a Bureau representative available for consultation during
interview. Todd, according to Seidell, stated he would not consider to be
interviewed in the absence of a release of a secrecy agreement by the Bureau.

| : RECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) That former SA David E. Todd, Assistant Director
Robert E. Gebhardt, and SAC Charles W. Bates be released from their

Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (SSC)

Ro: Request Pertaining to Warrantless
Electronic Surveillances for ©
National Security Purposes

Queation #24b asked: "What have been the identities of the
agencies and the Presidential appointees who have initiated requests
for such surveillance for each year from 1966 to the present?"

With respect to this question, all survelllances noted in #249
above were initfated upon a request from the National Security Agency
(NSA) except one which originated with the FBI. In the past all NSA
requests were made by the head of NSA or a responsible official thereof.
Currently all NSA recommendations, whether initial requests or continua-
tions for surveillances, are originated by General Lew Allen, Director,
NSA, and are considered by senior representatives of the Departments of
State and Defense and the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). The
requests to be recommended are then submitted over the signature of
Mr. William Colby, DCI, with the written concurrence of Dr. Henry
Kissinger, Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs.

Both the DCI and the Assistant to the President for National Security
Affairs indicate that the requests are necessary for the conduct of foreign
affairs matters which are important to the national security of the

United States. Based on the above recommendations, the Director of the
FBI then recommends Attorney General approval of the surveillances.

“The chart which follows pertains to the questions #24c through
f, which are:

c. ‘How many such requests have been initiated by each
agency and each Presidential appointee for each year from 1966 to the
present?"

da. "How many of such requests initiated by each agency and

each Presidential appointee have been approved by the Attorney General
for each year from 1966 to the present?”

Re; Request Pertaining to Warrantless
Electronic Surveillances for an
National Security Purposes

The statistics for each year represent the number of surveil-
lance operations directed at encoded non-conversational communication
systems of a particular subject. Iegarding the statistics in columns ec.
and f, it should be noted that one surveillance operation could generate
more than one continuance request in one year. Also, several of the
surveillance operations noted above involved plaintext non~conversational
as contrasted to encoded non-conversational comraunications.

Question #24¢ asked: "For each year from 1966 to the present,
| how many such surveillances have been instituted in (1) the United States;
| (2) North America, other than the United States; (3) South America;
| {4) Western Europe; (5) Eastern Europe; (6) Africa; (7) the iMiddie East;
(8) Southeast Asia; (9) the rest of Asia?"

With respect to this question, all surveillance operations noted

Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (SSC)

Re: Request Pertaining to Warrantless
Electronic Surveillances for
National Security Purposes

NOTE CONTINUED:

The reference to "Presidential appointee" quoted in Question #24
is from the Attorney General's 6/24/75 letter to Senator Kennedy and
ultimately from the President's. 12/19/74 memorandum to the Attorney
General. The SSC question attempts to measure by standard established
on 12/19/74 activities which occurred in 1966. Since a listing by
Presidential appointees would not account for all requests made it would
require an explanation that the Presidential appointee criteria came into
effect as a result of the Presidential Directive of 12/19/74. The directive
is the subject of a separate question which the Department has reserved
to itself for a response. No comment is therefore being directed to
Presidential appointees or the directive. In view of this the response
given here is appropriate.

This question pertains only to electronic surveillance of non-
conversational communications. The statistics furnished were obtained
by review of all Telex and EPCE requests conveyed by the Bureau to the
Attorney General. These statistics do not include two 1975 surveillances
of closed circuit television (CCTV) requested by FBI and approved.

Classified "Rep Sécret" since it contains information from
the Presidential Directive, dated 12/19/74, which is so classified.

Re: United States Senate Select Committee

With Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

Documents submitted by IRS with respect to requests
for income tax information were filed in the substantive case
file at FBI Headquarters. Copies of these communications were
forwarded to interested FBI field offices by letter or
routing slip. Where a routing slip was used, no copy of such
was retained in the file; however, a notation was placed in
the file that copies of IRS communications had been so forwarded.
Inasmuch as IRS was the originating agency for income tax
information furnished the FBI concerning the above-named
individuals and/or organizations, any SSC request for copies of
such information so supplied should be directed to IRS.

Set forth below is the identity of PBI personnel
who would have had firsthand knowledge of the reason for
a request for income tax information from IRS concerning the
above-named individuals and/or organizations:

by SA Robert Shea, IS-1 Section. Nattors pertaining to
Harcuse, IPS, Raskin, Barnet, and U. S. Students Press
Association were handled and reviewed by SA George Lex,

Numerous references were located in Bureau files
pertaining to Dowl, Beacon Press, and Cambridge Institute.

xeferences did not reveal a request for income tax informa-—
tion. SA B. C. Rachner, CI-4 Section, was contacted re~-

for Community Development inasmuch as he currently maintains
liaison with IRS. ‘tr. Rachner indicated a review of infor-

tax information failed to indicate such information had been
requested in these three instances. During conversation
between ‘ir. John T. BLLIff, SSC Staff Member, and Mesars,

W. O. Cregar and E. W. Larson, Jr., of the FBI on 9/10/75,
it was agreed only documents pertaining to income tax infor-

Herbert C, Mohammed is the son of the national leader

of the NOI, Elijah Muhawmad, it is noted that father and son
speal their last names differently, ‘The NOX preaches hatred
of the white race and advocates a separate nation for American
Negroes, Herbert Mohammed is the Logital succesgor, to his
father as leader ot this extremist group.

" Herbert johammed is involved im several NOL businesses
and is. the manager of former heavyweight boxing champion Cassius
Clay. Herbert Mohammed-has been described as money crazy and
one who will do anything for money, A,review of his income tax
returns might indicate he_is vulnerable in this area,

If Herbert Mohammed could be removed as successor to

the leadership of the NOI, it would place our top level NOI
informants in a better position to neutralize this extremist cult,
The Chicago Division, where the NOI is headquartered, recommends
we develop long-range counterintelligence measures to neutralize |
Herbert Mohammed. A first step would be to review his tax returns.

Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requesting income tax returns )

Tele. Room

on United States Student Press Association (USSPA) for years LA

1966 through 1970. vit
BACKGROUND: 7 7

The USSPA claims to operate a press service for
college newspapers and other organizations; however, the
news releases it prepares are similar to those prepared by
New Left underground press services, and are subscribed to : \
‘py underground newspaper publications throughout the country. i Jf
These releases contain information which discredit the .
Government and authority, and follow the New Left movement
in expression and content.

Records of the Public Information Division, Reference
Section, IRS,,Washington, D: C., were reviewed by a Special
y seent of WFO who was not required to identify himself as
eae were available to public. These records indicated
S¥ USSPA incorporated in Washington, D. C., in 1966 and applied»
‘Sp for tax exemption with IRS stating it was organized for
educational purposes, Records available also indicated
that for the taxable year ending 8/31/69 USSPA had income
from contributions and grants’ in excess of $63,000. In view
of the New Left type-activity engaged in by USSPA and
White House interest in sources of New Left funds, additional
investigation is warranted to determine sources of funds and
assets of this organization and its activities, If you

approve, attached memorandum should be returned to the ot
Domestic Intelligence Division so that these income /tdx-?“ - Lm
returns can be obtained and reviewed, od aaa

ve Se Fee ;

% The USSPA claims to operate a press service for

NS college newspapers and other organizations; however, the

nv news releases it prepares are similar to those prepared by

XY New Left underground press services, and are subscribed to wy
JN by underground newspaper publications throughout the country. j4
3 These releases contain information which discredit the
gps Government and authority, and follow the New Left movement
28 in expression and content.

Records of the Public Information Division, Reference
Section, IRS,,Washington, D. C., were reviewed by a Special
Agent of WFO who was not required to identify himself as
records were available to public. These records indicated
USSPA incorporated in Washington, D. C., in 1966 and applied
for tax exemption with IRS stating it was organized for
gy educational purposes, Records available also indicated
that for the taxable year ending 8/31/69 USSPA had income
~ from contributions and grants’ in excess of $63,000. In view
> of the New Left type'activity engaged in by USSPA and
White House interest in sources of New Left funds, additional
> investigation is warranted to determine sources of funds and
assets of this organization and its activities. If you _

ReBureau letter, 11/8/71, with enclosures.

Enclosed for Denver are copies of referenced Bureau
-letter, together with enclosures which are self- -explanatory,
. being furnished Denver since the College Press Service (CPS)
is now located in that Division.

Perusal of the Bureau's letter and enclosed material
reveals the Carnegie Foundation contributed $48,500 to the
United States Student Press Association CUSSPA) during the
period ending 8/31/69, and the Ford Foundation contributed
$2,000 to the USSPA during the period ending 8/31/70. From
the information submitted, it would appear the USSPA and -
its subsidiary, the CPS, could not exist without these and a
other Foundation grants.

The Bureau may desire to consider discussing this
matter, on a high level, with officials of one or all of
the Foundations involved. Further, the Bureau may desire to
submit to these officials press releases of the CPS which
have been furnished to the Bureau by the WFO for the purpose
of informing Foundation officials of the nature of the
material which is disseminated for reproduction in a great
number of college meWSPaP TES 25 the CPS.

Internal Security - C

A confidential source, who has furnished reliable
information in the past, furnished information on January 13,
1965 indicating that Clarence Jones and Stanley Levison
were in contact on that date. Jones instructed Levison to
get aside the date of the 29th (January 29, 1965) on his
calendar because a meeting of the "Research Committee" - would
be held in New York City on that date,
It is to be noted that in the past,
the same source has aG@vised thet when
Jones uses the term "Research Committee"
it means a meeting of Martin Luther King,
Jdr., President of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference (SCLC) and his advisors
in New York City.

In continuing their contact, Jones related that
King was in Dorchester Center (Me Intosh, Georgia), on that
| date (January 13, 1965) ana planned to be in Selma, Alabama,

all state (Alabama) civil rights leaders.

Clarence Jones is the General Counsel |
to the Gandhi Society for Hunan Rights,
| 15 East 40th Street, New York, New York.

“A confidential source, who has furnished
reliable information in the past, advised on |
February 26, 1957, that he identified a photo~ ;

knew during late 1953 or early 1954, to be a

member of and in a position of leadership in

the Labor Youth League. :

The Labor Youth League has been designated
pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

A confidential source, who has furnished
reliable information in the past, advised in
April, 1964, that Stanley Levison was a
secret member of the Communist Party, j
United States of America (CPUSA}) in
July, 1963. In late 1963 and early 1964,

he criticizec the Communist Party for not
being sufficiently militant in the civil
rights struggle. lLevison was described

by certain Communist Party leaders as being
to the "left" of the Communist Party in

his position on civil rights. His differences
with the CP, however, are merely tactical and
he continues his ideological adherence to
Communism.

It is noted that the eee pian was for
JONES to arrange with KING to meet with himself and
LEVISON in Atlanta on either Sunday or Monday, May 2,3,
1g65. NY instituted surveillance of JONES and placed hin
on the United Airlines Flight for Atlanta with HARRY
BEI-ATONTE on the morning of 4/30/65. NY subsequently
received information that JONES was returning to NY on
Saturday, 5/1/65, which along with information that KING
was going to Philadelphia, indicated that the conference
between KING, LEVISON — JONES would not take place.

Tt also was felt that since JONES was going
to Atlanta on Friday that he would be the person to bring
KING the speech he requested for his Philadelphia speaking
engagement.

When information was developed by Philadelphia
that KING was coming to NY on Saturday evening, a sur-
veillance was conducted on LEVISON to cover any meeting he
might make with KING. As indicated by the attached LHM,
LEVISON did not meet with KING in NY on the night of 5/1/35,
and, in fact, as LEVISON stated there was a complete mis-
understanding between the three of then and that JONES
should arrange a new meeting now tentatively scheduled for
May 10 or 11, 1865 in Atlanta.

A confidential source furnished the following
information concerning contacts between Stanley Levison

and Clarence Jones on May 2, 1965:

: Levison told Jones that he saw the "person" in

Philadelphiaas he was being ushered into a meeting and this

"person" told him that he would see Levison later, Levison
Jones stated

said that he replied he would not be around.

that the only reason he would have stayed around would have
been for the three of them getting together. Jones added

thet he was waiting to hear from either one of them as. to
whether he would go to Philadelphia. Levison commented

that apparently there was a complete misunderstanding

between the three of them and asked Jones to call Philadeliphis

and work out a meeting in the near future.

: (It is noted that Martin Luther King was in
Philadelphia over the weekend of May 1 and 2, where he was
to address a bar association group).

: Subsequently, Clarence Jones contacted Martin
“Lather King who told Jones that things went well on May
1, 1965, and that Stan (Levison) brought the "statement".
King added that he used the "thing" he worked up in New
York because he did not have time to look at the material

Stan brought him before going on stage.

Communist Influence in Racial Matters

King mentioned that he would return to Atlanta
and be there until May 12, when he would go to New York
for a meeting. Jones told him that there are a couple of
pressing matters, both relating to the New York Office (of the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference) (SCLC) that needed
to be discussed because "our friend" is going on a trip
soon. They tentatively set a meeting for themselves and
“our friend" for May 11, 1965 in Atlanta,

The source has previously furnished information
showing that when King and Jones discuss "our friend" they
mean Stanley .Levisons.

Jones also said that when King attends an
Administrative Committee meeting (of SCLC) on May 6,7;
1965, he hopes King will. discuss the Summer Community Organ~
iaation and Political Education Project because this is a
problem between the SCLC and the Student Nonviolent
ovurdinating Committee.

Jones and King also discussed the handling of
the proceeds from the "Broadway Answers Selma" show (held
in New York City on April 4, 1965). King said the group
should check with Wilie Branton (phonetic) about the money
beeaiise he has handled gifts in the past. King wants the
Aénti-Defiation League to give the money directly to the
Southern Regional Council since this league now has the
money from the show. Jones agreed to discuss the matter
with Branton (phonetic) who is now in Atlanta.

Wiley Branton was chosen recently by Vice

President Humphrey to be Executive Secretary of the
President's Council on Equal Opportunity.

SEGQRET

IW 68262 Docld:32989659 Page 261



Later, Levison was again in contact with Jones
who said he had spoken to King. Jones stated that King
said the first chance they can meet will be the nights of
May 10 and 11 in Atlanta. lLevison said that he could make
it and Jones added that all that remained was to confirn
the date with King. 7

Levison proposed that they meet before seeing
King, stating this would give them a framework from which
to work and Jones agreed, Levison said the two main things
to be considered are, the organization of the SCLC to
make it a real organization and the questions around King
personally. ~

Jones advised that King had placed top priority
an to find someone who could be what amounts to
an executive vice president. King told Jones that if he
knew anyone qualified he could pire him. Levison said he
was glad King felt this way and that they would discuss
it. Levison sid he would like to suggest Larry Perkins
6f the United Negro College Fund, Jones remarked that he
doubted that Perkins would be willing to go to Atlanta.

Levison further stated that they had to find
someone who would work’ well with Jones and for this
reason it is important that he and Jones find someone for
this position. Jones commented that the problem is that
there is a bwekdown because there is nobody to take charge
of things, Levison then added "in a certain sense it is
what I do in New York in the New York Office, He never
has any problems in connection with it because I make
the decisions and then Adele (Kanter of the New York SCLC
Office) just goes ahead and does it and that ig what he

Communist Influence in Racial Matters

Clarence Jones :
Clarence Jones is the General Counsel to the
Gandhi Society for Human Rights, 15 East 40th
Street, New York, New York.

A confidential source, advised on February 26,
1957, that he identified a photograph of

. Clarence Jones as a person whom he knew during late
1253 or early 1954 to be a member of and in a
position of leadership in the Labor Youth League.

The Labor Youth League has been designated
pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

Larry Perkins

A confidential source advised on March 5, 1954,
that Larry Perkins was known to him to be a member
of the Communist Party.

Stanley Levison

A confidential source advised in April, 1964,

, that Stanley Levison was a secret member of the
Communist Party, USA, in July, 1963. In late
1963, and early 1964, he criticized the Communist
Party for not being sufficiently militant in the
civil rights struggle. Levison was described

by certain Communist Party leaders as being to
the "left" of the Communist Party in his position
on civil rights. His difference with the
Communist Party, however, are merely tactical and
he continues his ideological adherence to Communism.

imception has never failed to rally to the legal
defense of the Communist Party and individual

: have been devised making special appeals in behalf

“he was booted out because he, everybody is of the common

completely blind which may explain WINTER's remarks about
_ "watehing him."

4, wf S800 60-S* advised on May 14, 1965, that a
HAL WEAVER (ph) was in contact with HENRY WINSTON at cP
Headquarters that date. Their discussion which will be
disseminated by separate memorandum concerned what WEAVER (nh)
_is doing now and their meetings "there" (in Moscow). WEAVER
.remarked that he is working on a project for Haryou-Act and
is also working on a book, "Russia and the Negro" to be
published by an anti-Soviet publisher, according to WY.
He said he would like to get WINSTON's comments. WI
| told him he was agreeable to any time after Thursday
| (May 20, 1965).

: WEAVER (ph) noted that he had left "there" around
the middle of February. "It was urgent because - had not
been renewed...." WEAVER mentioned also that it "might have
been for political reasons, whether they felt I was stirring
up trouble, I don't know. It's difficult to say."

advised on:May 12, 1965, that

STANLEY LEVISON told CLARENCE JONES that one HAROLD

WEAVER (ph) was interested in a possible job with
LEVISON said he had a tentative

MARTIN (LUTHER KING).

‘appointment with him for 2:30 p.m. on Friday (5/14/65)
at JONES' office. JONES said he thought that would be
all right.

On May 14, 1965, a Special Agent of the NYO

observed an unknown male Negro departing from CP
Headquarters and identified a photograph of WEAVER 2s
that person, On the afternoon of the same date, surveillances
were conducted at CLARENCE JONES' office, 165 Broadway,

NYC, and at STANLEY LEVISON's office, 1841 Broadway, NYC.
JONES was observed returning to his office at 2:35 p.m., but
LEVISON and WEAVER were not observed. :

% should be noted that LEVISON and JONES met

ay
with MARTIN LUTHER KING, Jr. in NYC, on May 13, 1965, and
that discussion could have been had concerning WEAVER at

tnat time negating the necessity for the tentative 2:30
meeting of May 14, 1965.

Concerning the Negro attache whom WINSTON and
WINTER discussed, it. is noted that the "New York World
Telegram", 5/12/65, page 3, contained an article "Russia

Qusts American Diplomat as Meddler" which states that
"Norris D. Garnett a cultural attache on the U.S. Embassy

Staff in Moscow was expelled by the Soviet Government on a
charge of carrying on work hostile to the U.S.S.R. among

African students.'
Elsvp—et is also noted that information has been furnished

by NY Saubasz_that JOHN HENRIK CLARKE, Associate Editor of
"Preedomways" magazine had corresponded with WEAVER in 1963,
while WEAVER was in Moscow, WEAVER has been a subscriber to
"Rreedomways."



NY 100-149162

The timing of his contagt with WINSTON (5/14/65)
which coincides with the dismissal of the cultural attache,
NORRIS GARNETT, appears strange in view of the fact that
WEAVER had been in New York prior to this time and could
have contacted WINSTON earlier.

It is further noted that WEAVER told WINSTON that
he "hoped" to be going to Europe in about 3 weeks, a
combination of “work and pleasure" trip. As of 3/5/65,
WEAVER resided at 3250 Broadway, NYC, apartment 2F.

WEAVER was the subject of a VOA investigation in
1959, (Bufile 123-15607).

King Declares Himself Concerning Yietnam

Hartin Luther King, dr., declared in a speech on
duly 1, 1965, that he and his aides would study the use of
“peace rallies" and se-called teacheins to bring pressure
to bear’ in foreign policy matters, Speaking at Petersburg,
Virginia, King reportedly said that he "was not going to
sit by and see war escalated without saying anything about it,
and he called for a negotiated settlement, demanding that we

“even negotiate with the Vietcong."

As head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,
one of the main civil rights organizations in this country, King's
announced intention to inject himself and his organization into

foreign policy issues was Significant for several reasons. :

Communist Influence on King Relative to Vietnam
Of primary significance in connection with King's
announcement is the fact that several of his advisers with
communist backgrounds are known to have been in favor of having

King inject himself? into the peace movement in cppcsition to
our foreign policy on Vietnam. On Hay 13, 1965, Stanley Leyison,.-

THE POSITION OF MARTIN LUTINR KING, JR.
. AND THE COMMUNIST PARTY, USA, ON VIETNAM

aceasion surseanently..godaned-then-at—the.neotings Vivian was

a member of the Communist Party in 1947, and Jones held a position
3of leadership during the mid-1950's in the Labor Youth Leasue,

‘an organization which has been designated ss subversive pursuant

to Executive Order 10450.

; .

™, Et should also be noted that another individual
with a communist background whe has been close to King wrote
@ epeech which King's wife, Coretta, made at an "Emergency
Rally on Vietnam" at Madison Square Garden in New York City
on dune 8, 1965. The speech was written by Bayard Rustin and
was given by Coretta King in place of her husband at the Rally,
the purpose of which was to ask President Johnson to stop the
bombing, seek a cease fire, and press for negotiations in
connection with the situation in Vietnam. Rustin, who also
spoke at the Rally, was, during the early 1940's, a member of
the Young Communist League, an organization which has been
designated as subversive pursuant to Executive Order 10450,

-Bapty Line Concerning Vietnam

The determination of King’s advisors with communist
backgrounds to have him inject himself into the peace movement
surrounding the Vietnam situation at this time is another
Significant factor bearing on his announced intention to do so,
The announcement comes at a time when the Communist Party, USA,
has placed the Vietnam situation foremost among issues about
which to center communist action in this country.

Beginning in the Fall of 1964, the Party began issuing
instructions to rank-and-file members to concentrate on the
Vietnam issue, Since that time, the Party has issued a virtual
avalanche of directives to alii Party districts containing
‘instructions on actizities to be followed to achieve the Party's
objectives in regard to Vietnam. Condemning the "military
aggression" of the United States against North Vietnam, Party
Headquarters instructed district leaders to organize activities
in trade unions, youth groups, religious organizations, peace
groups, and the like, It instructed that steps be taken to
cooperate in regard to activities of these groups involving
picket lines, peace walks, student assemblies, and d@fonstrations
aimed at protesting this Nation's foreign policy position on

Vietnam.

THE POSITION OF MARTEN LUTHER KING, JR.
AND THE COMMUNEST PARTY, USA, ON VIETNAM

Tliustrating the increased tempo of communist activity
in this regard is the fact that an analysis made of communist
propaganda media during the six-month peried beginning January 1,
1965, reveais that the “peacew~in-Vietnam" theme was the
predominant issue exploited.

Implementing the Party Line

Communists, their supporters, ard their sympathizers
have responded to the Party's campaign and the Party instructions
on a bread scale, Typical was the communist exploitation of
the student uprising which took place on the campus of the
University of California at Berkeley, California, this past school
year, Seizing the opportunity presented on that occasion,

Herbert Aptheker, a leading national functionary of the Communist
Party, appeared and spoke at a demonstration involving some

1,300 students in February, 1965, Eneouraging the students te
Genonstrate in protest against the United States foreign policy
on Vietnam, Aptheker declared that the war in Vietnam was the
favit of the United States and a direct result of our int vention
there,

‘ Similarly, communists and individuals with communds 6
backgrounds have exploited opportunities of a Like nature in
connection with the widespread demonstrations which have
.dccurred in the country this past: year, One of the best examples
of the Party's tactics in this regard involves the communists +
inspired W. &. B. DuBois Clubs of America, At a national

- conference of that organization held in Chicago, tllinois, ~
during the last three days of May, 1965, plans for mass protests
against the policy of the United States in Vietnam, ties with
international front groups, and cooperation with other organizations:
to protest United States volicy were the principal topics of die~
- cussion;

Civil Rights Group Follows Party Line

In this connection, it is noteworthy that an
announcement was made concerning the plans of the Student Noa-
Violent Coordinating Committee to dramatize opposition to

THE POSITION OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR, ‘
AND THE COMMUNIST PARTY, USA, ON VIETNAM

United States policy in Vietnam, It was stated that this
organization, which is one of the more militant civil rights
groups, would attempt to recruit 2,000 people this summer for
the purpose of surrounding the White House in a sitedown in
September, The Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee is
@ ovime target for communist infiltration since it has made it
clear that it will accept support for its endeavors from anyone,
including communists.

This announcement of the plans of the Student Non=
Violent Coordinating Committee is of particular interest because
it constitutes the injection of a civil rights group into
foreign policy protests, something the conmunists are most
desirous of achieving to further their own objectives,

it can be clearly seen from the communist directives
tliat the key to communist action on the central issue of
Vietnam teday is infiltration of a11 groups in our society
through which the communists might in any way work to create
opposition to our foreign policy. Since the civil rights movement
embraces widespread groups and supporters constituting a major
force on the national scene, the Communist Party sees in it a
readyemade vehicle to organize widespread protests in line with
-its program of opposition to foreign policy if the Party's
campaign is carefully executed.

King's Influence Potential for Party Exploitation

In this regard; Martin Luther King's emergence on
the scene with the announced intention of participating in
protests against our foreign policy in Vietnam cannot be lightly
‘dismissed or underestimated. Whether it constitutes a witting
or unwitting move on his part in relation to serving communist
objectives, it holds out the prospect of additional support
being engendered among civil rights groups for pretest
demonstrations against our current policy in Vietnam, and in
turn holds out the prospect of additional opportunities fox
communist exploitation of the situation,

THE POSITION OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR,
AND THE COMMUNIST PARTY, USA, ON VIETNAM

As to Zing's witting or unwitting role in this matter,
it is most interesting to note that the heads of two other
principal civil rights organizations in the country today have
taken a position contrary to King"s by opposing a merger of the
issues of civil rights and Vietnam. James Farmer, head of the
Congress of Racial Equality, toid that organization's convention
at Durham, North Carolina, on July 5, 1965, that their
organization should stay out of the peace movement and concentrate
on civil rights, Roy Wilkins, head of the National Association
fox the Advancement of Colored People, is reported as having

‘ commented concerning King's involvement in the Vietnam situation
to the effect that his, Wiikin$s, organization was too busily
engaged in vivil rights matters to have any time left for
becoming involved in the Vietnam crisis,

Clarence Jones is the General Counsel "
to the Gandhi Society for Human Rights,
15 East Hoth Street, New York, New York.

A confidential source, who has furnished
reliable information in the past, advised on
February 26, 1957, that he identified a photo-
graph of Clarence Jones as a person whom he
knew during late 1953 or early 1954 to be a
member of and in a position of leadership in
the Labor Youth League.

The Labor Youth League has been designated
pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

A confidential source, who has furnished
reliable information in the past, adwised
in April, 1960, that Stanley Levison was a
secret member of the Communist Party,
United States of America (CPUSA), in

July, 1963. In late 1963 and early 1964,
he criticized the Communist Party (CP)

for not being sufficiently militant in
the civil rights struggle. Levison was
described by certain CP leaders as being
to the "left" of the CP in his position
on civil rights. Levison's differences
with the CP, however, are merely tactical
and he continues his ideological adherence
to Communism.

Communist Infiltration of the SCLC
Internal Security - C. |

: |
In "The Saturday Evening Post", issue of July 11-
18, 1964, page 76, Bayard Rustin is the subject -
of a feature article captioned: "The Lone Wolf
of Civil Rights". In it, Rustin is said to
have come to New York in :1938, as an organizer
for the Young Communist League (¥CL), and as
such; he had the job of recruiting students for
the "Party", Furthermore, the article reports
that during his first years in New York, Rustin
gave most of his earnings to the "Party". He
reportedly left the "Party" in 1941, the article
states.

The YCL has been designated pursuant to
Executive Order 10450,

The "Daily Worker", February 11, 1957, page 1,
colum 2, reported that Bayard Rustin, Executive
Secretary, War Resisters League, was an observer
at the 16th National Convention of the :
Communist Party, United States of America
(CPUSA), held in New York City, on February
9-12, 1957.

The "Daily Worker" was an East Coast Communist
publication until it ceased publication on
January 13, 1958.

A confidential source, who has furnished reliable
information in the past, advised on September 25,
1963, that during a meeting of the National
Board, CPUSA, on that date, Benjamin J.

Davis remarked that, "Rustin calls me constantly--
openly."

Another confidential source, who has furnished
reliable information in the past, advised on

February 19, 20, 1964, that Bayard Rustin
contacted Benjamin J. Davis on those dates

from a speaking engagement to which he was
committed. On the latter contact, Davis told
Rustin that he was working on his request and
had contacted friends who had contacts with the

A confidential source, who has furnished

January 21, 1964, that as of that date, ~
Benjamin J. Davis was National Secretary

Re: Interview of FBI Special Agent (a)
3. Robert Newton by SSC Staff Members

At No specific communications are recalled. However,

it is possibic that other types of communications such as hiatal
types, sirtels or letters might have been furnished to FBI :
Headquarters if the occasion so dictated.

Qe - “Dad the local police department assist the yet in thie
investigation?
As ; The lecal police department ‘did not assist in investiga-

- ting this matter as such, However, police cooperation regarding
information on individuals might have been brought to the
attention of the FBI, although | I cannot specifically recall
instances of this.

: it was noted by Ma. Talley and Ms. peoreo that the
report concerning Women's Liberation Movement, which they had in
their possession, reflected dissemination to other government

agencies.
Q: How was this dissemination determines?
A: ’- ¥ do not know at this point in timo specifically why :

these other government agencies were furnished & copy of the report. |

It 1s apparent from the above that ‘questions raised :
by Ms. Talley and Ms. DeOreo dealt mainly with procedures and had
to do primarily with administrative handling by the FBI of the
Women's Liberation Movement case.

» DeOreo commented at the conclusion of the interview -
that Niobe (e could be additional questions as they delve deeper

into such matters and felt that they would possibly wish to
recontact me in the future if the oil arises,

bad law enforcement agencies, In view of the nature and

oc

volume of this type of dissemination, and since specific
details of same are retained in the files of many of the

FBI field offices, the SSC is not being furnished this type

of information wherein dissemination and/or contacts vere

Included in the information being delivered. to
the SSC in response to Item 1 i# teatimony by the FBI.
Director before the House Subcommittee on Appropriations
for fiscal years 1965, 1966 and 1967. A review of the
Director's testimony for fiscal years 1963, 1964 and 1966
was conducted but no gdditional information was located
pertinent to the SSC requests concerning King.

_ The following should bé noted concerning Item 11.
A review of logical files at FBI Headquarters disclosed
two instances indicating that electronic surveillances of
King were effected by state or local agencies or governments.
These instances involve the New York City Police Department
(N¥CPD) and the Dade County Sheriff's Office, Miami, Florida.
PBI field offices in New York City and Miami were tructed
te contact appropriate officials of these two departments
to secure their comments relative to the FBI releasing to
Se xine material involving their electronic survetllances

On September 9, 1975, Deputy Chief Jones Meehan,
Intelligence Division, NYCPD, advised that his department
had been unable to locate any record of an electronic
surveillance of King. He advised that the NYCPD considers
information in PBI files regarding any such survetllance
as FBI records and that any disclosure of same is the
FBI's prerogative.

On September 9, 1975, Mr. Walter J. Laugheed,
Assistant Director, and Mr. Robert Wennerholm, Legal Counsel, —
both of the Dade County Public Safety Department (DCPSD),
were advised of the SSC request. Laugheed advised that
his department has no objection to the FBI releasing to the
SSC information in FBI files indicating electronic surveil-
lances of King by his departmant, He further advised that
any requests by the SSC for information regarding King in
the files of the DCPSD would have to be in the form of a
subpoena before compliance with the requests.

7 The material in FBI files relating to the above
matters in response to Item 11 is being delivered to the SSC
with this memorandum,

With reapect to the excisions in materials being
delivered herewith, where no notation appears as to reason
for excision, the excision was made for the reason that the
information actually summarizes or quotes from conversations
monitored during electronic surveillences of King. In some

- gases, {t can be ascertained precisely what information in
FBI files came from electronic surveillances of King; however,
there exist areas where documentation of the information is
not precise and no accurate determination can be made,
Therefore, no assurances can be given that portions of the
material being furnished do not contain information developed
as 8 result of electronic survelllances of King.

With the delivery of the materiely with this -
memorandum, we have fulfilled all requests contained in the
July 8, 1975, request. ; .

1. Was there a memorandum which established the
RRY and does it indicate “Mr. Hoover appeared before the
Civil Unrest Commission?

A momorandum dated August 3, 1967 from C. 5. Brennan
to Mx. W. ¢. Sullivan indicates itr. Hoover instructed an index
be compiled of radical agitators and individuals who had .
denonstrated a propensity for fomenting radical discord,
however, this memorandum did not indicate “fr. Hoover had appeared

“<@~

NW'68262 Docld:32989659 Page 406


Re: United States Senate Select Committee
To Study Governmental Operations
With Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

before the Commission on Civil Disorder. Mr. Ellif¢
requested 4 search be made to determine if a memorandum
existed which indicated Mr. Hoover had appeared before such
a Commission. A review was conducted and a memorandum dated
August 1, 1967, from C, D. DeLoach to Mr. Tolson captioned
"Director's Testimony Before National Advisory Commission
on Civil Disorders, Tuesday, August 1, 1967," was located.
Copies of these two memoranda are being furnished.

2, Was there a memorandum concerning the
expansion of the AI to include individuals of local,
prominence?

Memorandum of G. C. Moora to Mr. W. C. Sullivan
dated November 22, 1967, which is included in material sub-
mitted under item 4c above, answers this question.

3. Were individuals included on both the AI and
the SI and, if so, wasn't this a duplication of effort?

Individuals were included on both the AI and the
SI; however, this was not necessarily a duplication of
effort inasmuch as the SI was to be utilized in the
apprehension and detention of individuals considered
dangerous and the AI was an administrative aid to follow
the activities and movement of individuals attempting to
cause racial disorders,

4. When did the 31 become automated and was the
RI aver automated?

The SI became automated during the early 1950s
and was updated throughout the years with the advancement
of computer technology and purchases by the FBI of more
advanced equipment. The first electronic computer was
obtained by the FBI during 1955 and the SI was incorporated
-4n this equipment. Following discontinuance of the SI in
1971, the Adex was continued in the computer system. While
stored in the automatic data processing (ADP) equipment, the
SI and Adex have been and are being maintained in‘ an "off-line" —

-7J-

NW 68262 Docld:32989659 Page 407


Re: United States Senate Select Committee
To Study Governmental Operations :
With Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

manner. ‘The RI-A was placed on ADP the same as the SI.
RI-B was maintained at the field level only and was never
placed in the ADP equipment,

5. Has the Bureau's copy of the Attorney General's
portfolio concerning the Emergency Detention Program (EDP)
been returned?

As mentioned above, one copy of the Attorney
General's portfolio concerning the EDP was located at
FBI Headquarters and is being forwarded to the Department
of Justice. 7

6. Who ware the Bureau individuals who (a)
maintained the Attorney General's. portfolio during 1968,
and (b) involved with the EDP during the 1940s?

The following individuals were identified—through
review of pertinent communications during time period in
question {a) ~ 1968-C. D. Brennan, P. F. Enlow, T. P. Rosack;
(b) 1946-D. M. Ladd, J. C. Strickland; 1948-Lish Whitson,

W. #H. Winterrowd, J. W. Yeagley.

7. When did the Department start reviewing and
approving the St list?

. Matters pertaining to the old Custodial Detention
List ware first referred to the Department during March,
1941. Copies of the SI were submitted to the Department
during 1951, and the Department, on a continuing basis, re-
viewed matters pertaining to the SI except for brief periods
of time when funds and manpower were not available until the
Si-was discontinued in 1971. Additional comments regarding
this question may be located under item 4b above.

“i; 8, Was there a form used by the Department con-
‘cerning the continuance or cancellation of individuals on
e' SI and, if so, what does the form look like ? Forms were
Ubiliged by the FBI and the Department, and excised copies as
Requested above by Mr. Elliff are being enclosed. :

In view of the growing problems created by local, 4E
rabble rousers from the standpoint of internal security, it :
is felt necessary that the criteria for recommending
individuals to be included in this Index should be expanded.

Under the existing criteria the Rabble Rouser Index

served as an index only for individuals who traveled exten-

sively engaging in rabble rousing activities and was limited a
to racial disorder. The expanded criteria will cover s
(1) agitators who have demonstrated by their actions and
| speeches that they have a propensity for fomenting disorder

of a racial and/or security nature and (2) have attracted

{such attention, nationally or locally, as to be of significant
interest with regard to the over-all civil disturbance

picture.

In the attached proposed SAC Letter instructing the
field with regard to the expanded criteria, it is being
‘pointed out to the field that it is the intent of this
criteria to have within each division as well as nation-wide
an index of agitators of all types whose activities have a
bearing on the national security. appropriate Manual ie

ne, too, was questioned relative to the saine matters, but
that tne questions asked were generally of a higher level
with regard to authorization, etc. SCHIIT stated that ne
nad been. put under oatn dy a female who also operated a

stenotype@achine and recorded the proceedings. He nad

been a eaeg that he had a right to read the transcript of
tha proceedings and they would notify him when the transcript
was completed. SCHITIT advised he intended to exercise this
privilege.

With regard to this interview, SCHMIT advised he
was interviewed in the Everette Dirksen Senate Building from
10:05 AM until 12:15 Pi on 9/16/75. At the time he was put
under oath by the female who operated the stenotype machine.
He did not know the name of this woman, but did notice tnat
she was unknown to the two attornies who were conducting the
interview as they had to introduce themselves to her. Tie
attornies’ nawes were JI VICK and TOM DAWSON.

Regarding nis conference with former Attorney General
ROBERT F. KENNEDY, SCHHIT stated that at the time of this con-
ference there was a general criminal intelligence conferenca
being weld in tne WYO and that at one point in this conference
fie was asked to brief tne Attorney General on the espionage
situation. SCHMIT advised tnat at this time he arrived at the
conference with taree memvers of nis staff, former Supervisors
ARWOLD BRANDT, JOHN DANAHY and JOHW HABEY. SCHHIT stated that
in addition to these people the individuals who were already
present at the conference were al] the SACs and JOHN F. WALONE,
tne AVIC. In addition to the Attorney General, there was a
public relations man who accompanied him whose name was not
recalled by SCHIIT, and former Assistant Director COURTNEY EVANS.
SCHMIT did not recall ever reducing this conference to writing,
but stated that if it was, and it may well have been, it would
have been done somewhere in the criminal intelligence files that
were reporting the general criminal intelligence oonference.

With regard to who wight recall specifics of this file,
SCHIIT suggested contacting former NYO Supervisors JOHN DANAHY
or JOHN JOYCE, or former SAC WILLIAM ALEXANDER, whom he thinks
wight have been the SAC of the Criminal Division at the tine.

Regarding what he discussed with the Attorney
General, SCHIIT stated that he could not really recall the
specifics, but probably discussed the programs we were
conducting such as SAM, SUN, GUS and Z, because in effect
we were telling the Attorney General what accomplishments
we were making, so SCHMIT felt that these would have been
fientioried, However, he could not specifically recall tne
details. In addition, SCHMIT felt that he probagfly dis-
cussed contemporary espionage cases at the time >)

In addition to this conference, SCHAIT advised
that KENNEDY received a second briefing which he, SCHiIT,
did not recall. However, when he was discussing his testi-
mony with former NYO Supervisor FRANCIS GALLANT, GALLANT
told SCHHIIT that KENNEDY came back a second time at a later
date and that he, GALLANT, brought KENNEDY up to date in
what was being done in the espionage field. SCHMIT stated,
however, he did not even recall this happening after GALLANT
had told him on a previous occasion.

SCHIIT stated that all of this information,
including the fact tnat he had a right to review the trans-

cript, would be placed in his memo and he woud furnish this an

memo to the NYO, to be forwarded to the Bureau.

Review of the pertinent files in Division III failed
to reflect any record of former SAC JOSEPH SCHHIT's discussion
with the then Attorney General ROBERT F. KENWEDY.

Supervisors and Agents with extensive experience in
the field of espionage were contacted and did recall that former
Attorney General KENNEDY visited the NYO during early 1960s, but
these individuals were not aware of the details of the discussions
waicn took place in the NYO between the then Attorney General
KENNEDY and the executives of the NYO.

It is brought to the attention of the Bureau that the
WYU did not attempt to review the criminal intelligence files
and will take no action in this area unless advised oy the

Bureau.

_ ADDENDUM: INTELLIGENCE DIVISION WOC :Thb 9/11/75

Mary Triplett is a retired employee who worked in
the Intelligence Division. She processed the Hunter mail (mail
intercepts received from CIA) for the Bureau. She is single
and is 60-plus years-old. Miss Triplett was a very intense
person, and Division personnel who worked with her over the
years believe, should she be interviewed by the Staff of the
Senate Select Committee (SSC) without the benefit of an Agent
present, it could adversely affect her physical and mental
health,

The Justice Department is looking into possible
criminal sanctions on behalf of CIA and FBI personnel involved
in the Hunter Project. It is conceivable that an interview by
the Staff of the SSC could work to Miss Triplett's detriment
in light of the Department's inquiry.

Previously, the Department, with the concurrence of
the White House, did not make available for an abuse interview
two female clerical employees of the Newark Office without
these employees being accompanied by a Departmental representative.
Under current guidelines for interviews during abuse situations,
we can seek to have a representative present during such an
interview subject to the approval of SSC.

Miss Triplett will be made aware of the Department's
inquiry and advised that she may desire to seek legal counsel.
| As you are aware, the Attorney General is presently considering
the legal question as to whether the Department can provide
legal counsel to former and current FBI employees. Until such
time as the Attorney General arrives at a decision, it is felt
we should recommend to the Department that Miss Triplett's
interview be postponed.

: ADDENDUM CONTINUED PAGE 3

NW 68262 Docld:32989659 Page 439



ADDENDUM CONTINUED:

RECOMMENDATION :

1, Prior to furnishing the SSC the current address
of Miss Triplett, the Legal Counsel Division will query the
Department as to the status of the Attorney General's decision
regarding legal representation for former and current employees.

2, In the event the Attorney General determines
legal representation cannot be provided Miss Triplett, we will
attempt to obtain the SSC's approval to have an Agent present
during the interview of Miss Triplett to assure her the Bureau
has not abandoned her.

Dear Mr. Levi:

Attorney General Edward H. Levi

At the clese of his testimony on September 25,
Mr. Charles Brennan, former Chief of Domestic Intelligence
Division, indicated that he could not answer a question
posed to him by me. The question relates to the status of
a so-called "closed" FBI Domestic Intelligence case file.
Suppose that the individual who is subject of the file is a
member of the military service or applies for employment
with a federal ‘government agency, and the agency requests an
FBI name check. What information .would be provided to the
federal agency by the FBI as the result of that name check?
What information would be provided to that agency if the FBI
conducted a background investigation on that individual?

With respect to surreptitious entries for the pur-
pose of installing electronic surveillance equipment, which
are referred to on page three of the September 24, 1975 letter
from Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., to myself, I would appreciate
answers to the following additional questions:

1. What has been the number of such entries for
each year since 1960?

2. What has been the number of separate targets
for each year since 1960?

3. What has been the total number of separate
targets since 1960?

I would also request access, under agreed upon pro-
cedures, to a list of such targets, and,the dates of the entries.

This matter concerns the Bureau-wide effort to service

the absolute necessity for maintenance of the file with our
Project relating to Senstudy 75 continues.

away from the Files and Communications Division. In accordance
with the provisions of that requirement and because of the 7

On 9/23/75, Arthur Harrigan and ap Gitenstein of tiie” —
Senate Select Committee telephonically contacted SA Paul V. SA Paul V. Daly.
of this Division and advised him that the Committee desired to de-
pose a current Bureau official concerning the Bureau's relationship
with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and, if particular, requests
concerning tax_returns and audits. Gitenstein stated, ultimately
the Bureau official deposed would subsequently testify in open
hearings with an IRS representative concerning these matters.
They stated that the interview of the Bureau official involved
would be based on documents currently in possession of the Com-
mittee relating to the Bureau and IRS.

They indicated the Committee would prefer only one
witness from the Bureau for this particular matter; however,
it was acceptable if the Bureau should have two witnesses.

Gitenstein also stated the Bureau will be informed of
what documents were going to be used in the deposition and testi-
money prior to the deposition being taken. After consultatio:
with Inspector Hunter E. Helgeson, it was determined that the’.
appropriate Bureau representative to be deposed and to testify
was Section Chief Robert-L. Shackelford inasmuch as. he was*a [ss
Section Chief of a section which made requests in this area.

In this regard, it is noted that a representative of
the Committee has been briefed concerning these matters by
Liaison Officer Bernard C. Rachkner and Sections Chiefs Robert L.
Shackelford and Joseph G. Deegan,

Regarding our request for so-called IRS audits,
Gitenstein was asked to explain exactly what. he meant by this
particular terminology inasmuch as our request generally per-
tained to income tax information and in some instances a
notification to IRS that a particular eet thes

subject of an investigation who had not filed an income tax
statement despite being employed. Gitenstein could not explain
what the Committee meant by the term audits and implied that it
may have been the action that IRS took on information furnished
by the Bureau which action was initiated by IRS on its own.

Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., Special Counsel for Intel-
ligence Coordination in the Department , was telephonically
contacted by SA Daly on 9/23/75 at which time he advised he
was familiar with the Committee request concerning the testi-
mony of a current. Bureau official and, in fact, referred the
Committee to this office so that the Bureau might comply with
this request. Shaheen interposed no objections to the Bureau
providing a witness for testimony concerning this matter.

RECOMMENDATIONS :

(1) That Robert L. Shackelford be released from
existing employment agreement and the provisions of the Code
of Federal Regulations for purposes of being deposed and
testifying concerning the Bureau's relationship with IRS as
stated above.

(2). That Legal Counsel Division will advise the
Committee that the Bureau representative to be deposed and
testify concerning this matter will be Section Chief cas L.

RE: REINTERVIEW OF FBI SPECIAL AGENT (8A) |

Epstein replied that it was a change in procedure and then
read the waiver to Campbell and asked Campbell if he had any
objection to the reinterview. Campbell stated that he had ro
objection, Campbell also advised Epstein that he felt he had
done nothing wrong but that if someone else thought he had
done something wrong, he certainly would like to discuss it.
with an attorney,

Epstein then asked, “Who made your assignment to the
Laboratory while you were working at the Washington Field Office
(WFO); was it Mr. Belter?" Campbell replied that he did not
recall specifically, but that Belter was his supervisor at the
time and in 811 probability Belter would have made the assign-
ment. Epstein hesitated and said he felt that Campbell was
not convinced that he, Campbell, wanted to continue with the
reinterview. |

Epstein. then said that the matter he wanted to. discuss
was the period Campbell had spent in the Laboratory while still
assigned to WFO. Epstein asked how much time had elapsed from
the time that Campbell had performed a monitoring function at
the Willard Hotel until Campbell reviewed certain tapes in the
Laboratory. Campbell responded that he did not specifically
recall but thought it was several months. : :

Epstein again hesitated and stated he thought Campbell
had some reservations about the interview. Epstein asked if
Campbell was an attorney and Campbell responded in the negative.
Campbell indicated he did not have any objections to the
continuation of the reinterview. Campbell stated that everything
he did in connection with "this investigation” was in response
to orders he had received from his FBI superiors and that if
anything turned out to be in a gray area, Campbell felt that the
Bureau would assist in representing hin,

Campbell should "sort out" in his own mind whether he wanted
