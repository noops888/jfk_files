At the prayer meeting in the Shiloh Baptist Church

that Tuesday night after the settlement, a young white

girl arrested with the original group on Sunday, came

down the aisle to the rostrum. She had been released

from jail a few minutes before and was out of breath.

She spoke briefly, softly. "First time I'd ever seen

a jail. It's a funny mixed-up feeling to hate being

in a dirty place but to be glad you're there for a good

reason....We hope you'll keep going."

The Police Chief of Albany said, "We met non-

violence with non-violence."

Where was the Federal Government?

While young people on three separate occasions

were being ordered out of Albany terminals and airested,

while over 700 persons were arrested and over 400

the Federal Government, pledged through specific Consti-

tutional guarantees, statutes, and administrative rulings

to protect the rights of citizens against local usur-

pation, took the following visible actions:

On November 1, 1961, when Selyn MCCOllum watched

e police order nine young Negroes out of the white

iting room at the Trailways Bus Terminal, and this

s reported to the F.B.I., there was no apparent result.

November 22, when five students were arrested for

sing the Trailways facilities in Albany, no federal

stion was visible. When Chief Pritchett ordered the

reedom Riders outside the railroad waiting room on

lecember 10, and then arrested 11 in the street, for

the third time in six weeks tha express ruling of a

federal Agency failed of enforcement. With the start

bE demonstrations and mass arrests on Tuesday, December

12, local police practice came into conflict, not with

the very pointed I.C.C. ruling, but with broader --

and more complex - issues represted by the Bill. of

Rights: freedom of assembly, the right of petition.

On Wednesday, with more demonstrations and more

arrests, telegrams began going to Attorney General•

Kennedy asking federal intervention. On Thursday --

more demonstrations, more arrests and the New York

Times reported from Albany that, "The Justice Depart-

ment was

watching developments

here closely." That

day, Attorney General Kennedy conferred by phone with

both Governor Vandiver and Mayor Kelley. The Mayor

said he assured the Attorney General that law and

order could be preserved without federal aid. Also

that day, the

Assistant Attorney General in charge of

the Civil Rights Division talked with Albany Movement

leader W. G. Anderson. On Friday, with demonstrations.

and negotiations in progress, he phoned Mayor Kelley

and offered to mediate, and the mayor assured the

Assistant Attorney General that the city could work

out its problems. On Saturday, negotiations broke down.

wired Vice President Johnson and Attorney, Generai

Kennedy to protest the arrests. F.B.I. men were re-

ported cruising the streets in cars.

On Monday, December 18, a settlement was announced;

and within a hour Mayor Kelley said Attorney General

Robert Kennedy called to congratulate him for a good

job.

Events in Albany were caused by the city's violation

of the Interstate Commerce Commission's regulation. The

Federal Government took no apparent action to curb that

violation, although it undoubtedly has power to enforce

its own orders. Today in Albany the I.C.C. order is

being complied with. It was enforced, not by federal

authority, but by demonstrations in the streets.

Conclusion

over 700 Negroes in Albany, and a few sympathetic

whites, spent time in prison in December of 1961, as a

mass

substitute for federal action to compel recognition

of a

legal right. They were not opposed by the white

people of Albany, but by local law enforcement officers.

These officers acted, not out of malice, but out of a

too-faint comprehension of the changes which are roll-

ing slowly, but inevitably, through the south today,

and which, with McComb, Jackson, and Albany, have be-

gun to move into the heart of the Black Belt. As in

other cases, a movement born of specific grievances

was nurtured in crisis and developed

larger objectives,

those of full equality and untarnished human dignity.

The real feelings of the Negro community were kept

from a fundamentally fair-minded white community by

the powerful barrier of segregation, propped up. by

a hostile press and an unsympathetic city administration.

the onlv one whose actions do not match its expresse

convictions. The Negroes of Albany have strained to the limits of

their capacity to endure pain and rebuff. The white community

has behaved in accord with the customs of the majority of southern

whites in resisting attempts to change the status quo. The chief of

police has acted like a chiet of police. But the federal government

has not opcrated according to its pretensions.

The national government has failed to protect the liberties of

its citizens in the city of Albany. From the fechleness of its actions,

a detached observer might conclude that the federal government

is still operating under the Constitution of the United States as once

expounded by Chief Justice Taft.

The First Amendment of the constitution of the United States

says: "Congress shall make no law.

semble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances."

Supreme. Court decisions in the early part of this century made it

clear beyond question that these rights of free speech, petition, and

assembly, are also guaranteed against state or local action by the

words of the Fourteenth Amendment, that no state shall "deprive

government powerless to protect the right of petition?

police of the city of Albany, by arresting Negroes and whites in

connection with their use of the terminal facilities in that city,

violated a right which has been. made clear beyond a shadow

of a doubt in the courts, and nailed down tight by a ruling of the

Interstate Commerce Commission. Yet, the federal government took

no action.

When a sherift, in the presence of witnesses, slapped a young

Negro for asking the right to sing and pray in prison, the federal

goverment was silent. Throughout the December troubles, there

were phone calls from the Justice Department to Governor Vandiver

and Mayor Kelley; conversations between the Department and leaders

of the Albany Movement. The F.B.I. dutifully sat in its office in

Albany and took dozens upon dozens of affidavits from Negro citizens

complaining that their constitutional rights had been violated by city

and county officials. But eight months later, there was not a

of action on these charges.

sign

In the spring and summer of 1962, hundreds of Negroes, and

some whites, were again deprived of their constitutional

rights by

city and county officials. They were put into jail again and again

for taking actions supposedly protected by the First and Fourteenth

Amendments. A pregnant woman was beaten, a lawyer was caned

a white youth had his jaw and ribs broken, three young people were

forcibly dragged from a courtroom under the eyes of a county judge.

Still no action. Eighteen-ycar-old Cordell Reagan, a veteran SNCC

worker, emerged from Dougherty County jail in late August, after

16 clavs of continement for

"contributing to the delinguency of a

minor"

(which, translated, meant that Reagan had been sitting on

the fender of a nearby car while to students were picketing a

theater) made this comment to me about the Department of Justice

and local police: "They're letting them get away with murder.

. In December 1961, in the midst of hundreds of jailings in the

Albany demonstrations, the New York Times reported from Albany;

"The Justice Department was watching developments here closely.

In September 1962, after shotgun blasts ripped into a home in Terrell

County where Negro and white registration workers were staying,

a Justice Department spokesman said in Washington: "IVe are watch-

ing the situation very, very closely."

In June 1962. six months after several flagrant violations of the

ICC ruling, the Atlanta Journals Washington correspondent report-

ed: "The U.S. Justice Department has launched an investigation of

alleged bus station segregation in Albany." In July, several Justice

Department lawyers were sent to Albany. On the 26th of that month,

according to an Atlanta Constitution report. Albany's Mayor Kelley

conferred in Washington with Attorney General Kennedy. The Con-

stitution said: "Kelley said he told Kennedy that Albany's racial

problems are dealt with by local people: Kolley said Kennedy agreed

with him.

Atlanta Journal Washington correspondent Douglas Kiker report-

ed in July: "Justice Department officials described the Albany trouble

Monday as

a tense situation' but added that Mayor Asa Kelley and

Chief of Police Lauric Pritchett have certainly indicated a strong

desire to maintain order. They said they had received no evidence

that Albany police we not furnishing adequate law protection.

." This

was immediately after attorney C. B. King, with more than 100 city

and county police nearby, had received his bloody beating at the

hands of the Dougherty County sheriff. Kiker disclosed that the De-

partment of Justice was "investigating" the beating of King. But if

there was ever a case where one. hour of investigation' would be

sutticient to establish grounds for federal action, this was it.

Near the end of the summer, after recciving dozens of angry

telegrams, atter the picketing of the White flouse by citizens from

both North and South, and after face-to-face pleas from Roy Wilkins

of the NAACP and William Kunstler of the American Civil Liberties

Union, the Justice Department made two legal moves: 1) it entered

a friend-of-the-court brief to support the Albany Novement's request

that an injunction against further demonstrations be denied; and

2) it asked for an injunction (after a violation of voting rights in

Terrell County so outrageous that usually calm reporters on the

scene were upset) to prevent certain officials in southeast Georgia

from interfering with registration activities.

The available administrative machinery for enforcing federal

law should be outlined: the Department of Justice has the duty to

enforce laws passec by Congress and provisions of the U.s. Con-

stitution. In the Department there is a Civil Rights Division, headec

by an Assistant Attorney General, which handles the bulk of the legal

work of the Department dealing with civil rights cases. The Division

depends for its intormation on another branch of the Justice Depart-

ment, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which has offices in cities

all over the country. F.B.I. agents undertake investigations on orders

from the Department, to determine if federal law has been violated

The F.B.I. can make arrests, usually on orders. from the Department,

sometimes on its own in situations of urgency. After investigation,

in civil rights cases, it is up to the Civil Rights Division to decide

whether prosecution should be initiated. If so, this is usually done

through the United States Attorney in that júdicial district, who

prosecutes the case in federal District Court, after indictment by a

grand jury or the filing of an information. Also upon the Depart-

ment's advice or order, the U.S. Attorney may file civil suits (al-

though this may be done by a Civil Rights Division lawyer trom

Washington) asking that the federal court issue injunctions forbid-

ding certain parties to engage in specified practices which may de-

prive individuals of their

rights under the Constitution. Attached

to the federal district court are U.S. marshals, who serve subpoenas,

give notice of injunctive action, and otherwise carry out the orders

of the court or the Attorney General. From District Court, there is

the right of appeal to the Court of Appeals, and then, in certain

cases, to the. United States Supreme Court.

The Department of Justice has on occasion defended its restraint

in the Albany situation and in other crises by the following argu-

ments, which deserve examination and reply:

I. Argument:

chance of succe ding Deep South stand little

§ since juries are white an

prejudiced.

Reply:

Even if acquittal results, prosecution may act

as a deterrent. Right now, southern police of-

ficers, knowing the govemment's reluctance to

prosecute, feel free to do as they wish with

Negro citizens, and Albany has demonstrated

this. If nothing else, a series of prosecutions

would exert a powerful educational and moral

force in a situation where Negroes feel deserted

by the national government and southern whites

are not clear where the government stands.

2. Argument:

The Supreme Court decision in the Screws case

of 1915 interpreted section 242 in such a way

as to make convictions difficult, because of the

need to show "intent" on the part of the ac-

cused, with. "intent" interpreted

very narrowly.

Reply:

The only way to get new interpretations of the

law is to bring new cases before the courts.

3. Argument:

The Department of Justice needs specific leg-

islative authorization from Congress-as it has

in the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960 re-

carding voting-to take injunctive action against

local officials in other situations involving civil

rights and civil liberties.

Reply:

In the Debs case of 1895 there was no specific

legislative basis for an injunction; yet the Su-

preme Court ruled that the federal government

could get one, saying: "Every government . .

has a right to apply to its own courts" in mat-

ters which the constitution has entrusted to the

care of the national government. The Court

said:

"The entire strength of the

nation may

them broadly. The degree of its compassion may

dictate the choice. When you combine the pres-

ent reluctance of the Dopartment of Justice with

the unhesitant exorcise of power by local police,

the result is to blind the First and Fourteenth.

Amendments with the first flash of a police of-

ficer's badge.

Alorcover,

Albany has implications for

American freedom beyond the question of equal

rights for Negroes. Can American citizens, any-

where in the land. have freedom of specch and

assembly in the face of a determined police

force and an uncertain national government?

4. Argument:

Our federal arrangement requires that the na-

tional governmont should interfere as little as

possible with "local" situations.

Reply:

It was precisely the purpose of the Fourteenth

Amendment to take the enforcement of racial

equality out of the hands of local governments,

which had proved the most flagrant violators,

and put ultimate authority in the hands of the

national government. Local governments may

do anything they want in the field of ordinary

crime. They may punish people for disorderly

conduct, for blocking sidewalks. for discheying

police officers. But the moment such offenses

are applied to one race in a way that they are

not applied to another, the Fourteenth Amend-

ment is violated, and the federal government,

with all the power at its command. has proper

constitutional juriscliction. To take the view thai

he arrests of Neuro citizens, for reasons ob

viously connected with their race. are purely

"local" matters, is to take a pre-Civil War vici

of the American federal system.

5. Argument:

There is no need for federal interference so

long as largo-scalo violence does not break out.

so long as local police maintain order.

• Reply:

If the government's only requirement is the

maintenance of "order,"

even without the ex-

istence of freedom, then we have moved close

to the idcology of the totalitarian state.

Something riceds to be said about the role of the Federal Bureau

of Investigation, and then about the influence of the President of

the United States.

"a young Negro told me bitterly. Whether true

or not, this is the feeling of many Negroes who have had contact

with the F.B.I., and, even it distorted, it is a general retlection of

the efficacy of the F.B.I's role in the area of civil rights. F.B.l. men.

appear to Albany Negroes as vaguely interested observers of in.

justice, who diffidently write down complaints and do no more.

With all the clear violations by local police of constitutional rights,

with undisputed evidence of beatings by sherills and deputy sheriffs,

the F.B.I. has not made a single arrest on behalf of Negro citizens.

The one arrest made by the F.B.l. in connection with the Albany

situation came in early September, and this when an F.B.I. man

himself, was attacked by a white man near the site of a burned

church.

In its 1961 volume, Justice, the Commission on Civil Rights im- 2.

plied that the F.B.l. may be fundamentally incapable of enforcing

the civil rights ot American eitizens. This is because of its natural

attachments to local police on whom it is dependent for the solution

of ordinary crimes, and because it is these same local police who

arrangement within the Department of Justice to case the problem

work daily on other "cases."

One solution might be the ercation of a special corps of federal

agents-similar to the T-mon used by the Treasury Department-for

the sole purpose of enforcing federally guaranteed constitutional rights

in many parts of the country where they are consistently violated.

Such agents need not be "outsiders," for there is a whole new gener-

tion of young Southerners Negro and white who are intelligent,

couragcous, capable, and genuinely concerned about civil rights, and

from whom such agents could be selected. The F.B.I. is most et-

fective as an agency for the solution of orcinary crimes, and perhaps

it should stick to that.

As for the President of the United States, he could play, but so

far has not played, a key role in crises such as Albany. The Commis-

sion on Civil Rights last year called for "the exertion of leadership

by the President and others in the National Government.

... These

recommendations are based on the belief that the Presidency, and

indeed the whole Federal establishment, is preeminently a place for

moral leadership. The Commission has been impressed with the in-

fluence which those in responsible positions can exert on the civil

rights climate of the Nation. By using the instruments for education

and persuasion which are available to them they can stir the conscience

of the country.

President Kennedy's first substantive public statement came after

eight months of trouble in Albany when, responding to a question

## Page 20

at his August 1, 1961, press conterence, he called the situation "un-

declared he could not understand

officials would not nogotiate with Negroes, and said: "We are going

to provide a satisractors

solution for the protection of the constitutional rights of the people

of Albany, and we will continue to do so." The trouble with this

latter statement was that "in the past" the national government had

done extremely little, and it its future attempts were to be of the

same magnitude, this was a puny promise indeed.

again in nochor proto a frene, Thud September 4y 02,

nounced the burning of the Negro churches in Lee and

Counties, calling the actions "cowardly as well as outrageous." This

was commendable. But it also indichtes the level of tolerance at

which our national leaders-and perhaps most white Americans-

operate. They will be aroused by open violence, particularly against

places of worship (Governor Vandiver of Georgia, hardly a triend

of the Albany Movement, offered a $250 reward for the apprehension

of the arsonists). But they will not be made sufficiently indignant

by mass jailings. by the deprivation of free speech and assembly,

by beatings and intimidation,

by the perpetuation of segregation.

The nation as a whole-not only the President-needs to expand its

capacity for outrage.

• Only once in the Albany troubles did the national administration

show a real burst of enersy; that was when Martin Luther King, Jr.

was jailed on July I0: The Presicent asked for a report, the Attorney

General got busy, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of civil

rights made phone calls, and the next day King was out of jail. But

there was no such deep concern for the hundreds of ordinary citizens

in Albany who went to jail about the same time for basically the

same reason. Special favors to distinguished individuals are too easy

a substitute tor genuine assistance to troubled groups. Jackie Robin-

son, who last summer received elaborate greetings from the President

on the occasion of his election to the Baseball Hall of Farne, noted

the Albany situation and wrote: "I'd rather have freedom than

• The fresidents general silence, except for the. two instances

noted above) and the fechleness with which the Justice Department

has acted are often attributed to the practical realities of national

politics, which require, it is said, that the President woo the support

of Southerners in Congress for other laudable national goals.

there are some means so morally hurtful that they corrupt the ends.

Besides,

is serious reason to doubt that the Administration

gains substantial advantage from such tactics. The Senators

the state of Georgia had an opportunity, in 1961, to vote on 12 key

issues important to the Administration: they both voted with the

Administration in only two of tho 12 instances, and these were farm

bills that they probably would have supported in any event. In a

PAGE 32

## Page 21

third case, on the housing bill, Talmadge supported the. President

and Russell did not.

Finally, it can be argued that the President's concern for civil

rights and his concern for political advantage are both demonstrated

by his choice of federal judges, knowing clearly that those appointed

in the South will have tremendous authority over the progress of

deny the the porcinte

race relations, and will have it for many years. Certain judicial ap-

pointments of this Administration have appalled Southern liberals.

The federal government, if it wants to, can take the following

actions in Albany:

1. Begin immediate prosecution under Section 242 of local

officials who have deprived Negroes of their constitutional rights in

the Albany area. Such trials, since they involve misdemeanors, do

not even require grand jury indictments, but may be initiated on

the presentation of an information by the Department of Justice, and

the Commission on Civil Rights has urged this procedure "in appro-

priate cases." The F.B.I. has in its hands piles of affidavits from Albany

citizens-accumulated over a period of nine months-testifying to vio-

lations of federal law; but the Justice Department has

not acted

2. Station in the area a substantial number of federal agents

to protect citizens from intimidation, beating, and false arrest. Such

agents should not confine themselves to standing by and taking notes,

which the F.B.I. has been doing on occasion in the Deep South in

the midst of scenes of brutality, but should have the authority to

make arrests on the spot.

3. Go into federal court and ask for injunctions to prevent

local officials from a) enforcing segregation statutes, and b) inter-

tering with peaceful assembly, picketing and speech. Violations of

such injunctions would then be subject to judicial punishment with-

out trial. Both such legal actions have been initiated by the Albany

Movement, but they could have been started by the federal govern-

ment last. December, and should now be backed by it. The govern-

ment, after prodding, did enter a friend-of-the-court brief in a de-

fensive action against the city's attempt to make demonstrations

punishable, but has not taken any steps to make peacetul assembly

a positive right.

4. The President should address himself directly to the people

of Albany, white and Negro, speaking forthrightly about racial dis-

crimination, making it plain to Albany whites that they are entitled

to express their views and hold their private beliefs, but that public

law now entitles Negroes to equal use of all public facilities, and

that the entire power of the federal government will stand behind

this. The Southern Regional Council, in its report The Federal Execu

tive and Civil Rights, said: "The South should be informed where

the President stands.... The millions of Southerners, white and

Negro,

who want to break loose from enfechling customs, would

respond with gratitude to Presidential leadership.

PAGE 33

## Page 22

There is a procedure outlined in the U.S. Altorney's Manual,

Title 10, Civil Rights Division, which says that where there is in-

sufficient evidence for federal prosccution but "repetitive civil rights

violations" exist, the U.S. Attorney may initiato a meciative con-

• ference

"with responsible local officials." The manual says: "Situations

in which such i conference may be useful include those involving

enforced racial segregation and illegal police practices.

tutter: Such is conference should serve the purpose of putting the

officials on notice regarding the applicable federal laws and giving

them an opportunity to remedy the situation...." It would be difficult

indeed to think of a situation more badlv in need of such a procedure

than Albany this past year,

but there is no indication that the De-

partment of Justice has used it, choosing instead to rely on informal

-and ineffectual-efforts at mediation.

6. The President should refuse to appoint segregationist foceral

judges. Judgeships left vacant are preferable to those filled for life

by men who, on their public record, are opponents of racial equality.

7. The Commission on Civil Rights might well investigate the

Albany situation and make appropriate recommendations. There are

a hundred potential Albanys in the Deep South.

These proposed actions require boldness, imagination, vigorous

initiative-precisely those qualities that were promised by Mr. Ken-

nedy in his campaign for the Presidency. As yet. however, no New

Frontiers have been carved out in the social wilderness which sur-

rounds Albany. They will probably he established, as elsewhere in

the Deep South, by determined Negroes and farsighted whites, com-

pellect by court rulings and smoothed by compromises, but with that

intermittent contlict, and suffering, which accompany progress. What

the government can do is help ease the pain.

of FBI operations. The Committee requests delivery of these

studies. If substantial excisions are necessary under our

agreed procedures, please notify me at once so that staff

access can be arranged prior to delivery.

With reference to my letter of September 16, 1975,

relating to the Martin Luther King, Jr. matter, please advise

me as to the status of your response.

The Committee has previously requested delivery of

various current and past indexes and lists compiled by the

FBI, including the ADEX, the "Rabble Rouser Index," and

similar lists. This request is repeated with the understanding

that certain. of these lists may be non-retrievable and that

certain names may be excised if they involve peculiarly sen-

sitive foreign intelligence matters.

With reference to my letter of September 12, 1975,

requesting delivery of materials pertaining to FBI and Justice

Department emergency plans, please advise me as to the status

Thomas Martin in the Civil Division, of the Department Ser-

telephonically advised on 9/26/75 that he had been designated

to coordinate the arrangements for legal representation for cur-

rent and"former Bureau personnel. He stated he had retained

confronting Stewart in his interview con-

cerning mail openings. It was apparent that the consideration in

this instance to hire private counsel was dictated by the topic

of Stewart's interview i.e. mail openings which is under review

by the Department to determine if criminal conduct exists.

Martin indicated in the future the retention of

outside or private counsel will be done through consultation

with the Bureau. He asked that the Bureau make the necessary

arrangements to grant clearance for Hollabaugh to receive

whatever information might be necessary for him to effec-

tively represent Stewart's interests in this matter. Legal

Counsel, Division in conjunction with the Special Investigative

Division has made the necessary arrangements.

SECT: "BLACK BAG" JOBS

J.ccdidc9.e5l2t-35059247

The following is set forth in regard to your

request concerning what authority we have for

"black bag"

jobs and for the background of our policy and procedures

in such matters.

We do not obtain authorization for "black bag"

jobs from outside the Bureau..

Such a technique involves

trespass and is clearly illegal; therefore, it would be

impossible to obtain any legal sanction for it. Despite.

this, "black bag" jobs have been used because they represent

an invaluable technique in combating suiversive activities

of a clandestine nature ained directly at undermining and

destroving nur nation.

The present procedure followed in the use of this

technique calls for the Special Agent in Charge of a field

office to make his request for. the use of the technique

to the appropriate Assistant Directoi.

The Special Agent

in Charge nust completely justily the need for the use of

the technique and at the same time assure that it can be

safely used without any danger or emcarrussment

i to the

Bureau.

The lacts are incorporated in a nenorandum which,

in accordance with the Director's instructions, is sent to

Mr. Tolson or to the Director for approval.

this memorandum is filed in the Assistant Director's office

under a "Do Not File" procedure.

In the field the Special Agent in Charge prepares

an

Intormal memorandum showing that he obtaine. bureau

authority and this memorandum is filed in his saie until

the next inspection by Bureau Inspectors, at which time it

is destroyed.

Our most comprehensive use of this technique and

it involves its use in the arm

Reference is made to the SSC request dated August 20,

Nd. 7d 1975, and specifically Part VII, Item 16c, which requests

certain materials relating to the investigation by the FBI of

the late Martin luther King, Jr.

Enclosed for your approval and forwarding to the SSC

Mis the original of a memorandum with its enclosure in response

"to the above request. Also enclosed for your records is a

copy of the memorandum with its enclosure.

As you will note from the memoranduh, very unusual

considerations are present in connection with the document being

furnished to the SSC.

We are therefore furnishing you two

copies each of two versions of the document involved. One

version has a number of excisions which are phrases based upon

information the FBI received through electronic surveillances

of King, a type of information which is covered in the last

paragraph of the memorandum.

The other version reveals the

document in its entirety and has the questionable phrases

underlined in red.

Reference is made to the SSC request dated

August 20, 1975, for materials relating to Martin luther

King, JT.,

and specifically to Part VII, Item 16c, which

requested:

All memoranda and any other materials

(excluding tapes of transcripts) which

related to the mailing of any tapes which

resulted from electronic surveillance of

King and/or any other materials to King,

Mrs. King, and/or the Southern Chriscian

Leadership Conference.

There is no infornation in the official FBI files

which would be responsive to this request. It should be

noted that this reply excludes information in FBI files

developed as a result of the current SSC inquiry into this

matter.

We have specific reference to such information as

that furnished by former IBI Special Agent Ilsh Whicson to

the SSE.

The Following information, although not fron

offleial FBI files, should be helpful to the SSC in its

inquiry into this matter.

At the time that Former FBI Assistant to the Direcio

William G. Sulliven zetired, he leit behind in his office

certain papers which were not official FBI records.

One of

these papers (an original typing), a Zerox of which is

attached, would appear to be pertinent to this inquiry.

Enclosure

1 - The Attorney General

NOTE:

The attachment to the LHM, paper. found in Sullivan's

office, suggests from its content that a facsimile of that

paper may have been used in the mailing to the King family

a tape resulting from microphone surveillance of King. A

copy of the paper in question is being filed with the yellow

of the LHM.

The Whitson matter referred to concerns infor-

mation Whitson had given us concerning the results of an

interview of him by the SSC Staff when he told them he had

mailed a package to the King family on behalf of Sullivan

and there is a strong possibility that package contained a

tape.

Regarding Item 4, names of FBI personnel appearing

in the lower left-hand corner of the AG note dated December 10,

1965, cannot be furnished positively. However, the names

"Ph1ll1ps" and "Bates" probably referred to:

Richard F. Bates, Special Agent in Charge, Soston

Fleld Office.

With respect to Items 5 and 6, the FBI employee who

entered the name "Martin Luther King, JI.," on the December 10,

1965, note was E. Madeline Wilkerson, retired file assistant.

Efforts were unproductive to identify the FBI employee who

entered the names "Martin Luther King, JX.," and "Nicholas deB.

Katzenbach"' on the July 22, 1969, note to Miss Gandy. On both

documents these names were hand printed by clerical employees

called file assistants to indicate subject of the file and to

determine cross indexing needed.

Regarding Item 7, we are unable to determine the

circumstances surfounding the Xeroxing of three coples of the

December 10, 1965, memorandum to MI. Hoover, We are l1kewise

unable to determine whose initials appear below the questioned

xeroxing notation.

With respect to the excisions in materials being

delivered herewith, where no notation appears as to reason

for excision, the excision was made for the reason that the

information actually summarizes or quotes from conversations

monitored during electronic surveillances of King. In some

cases, It can be ascertained precisely what Information in

FBI files came from electronic survelllances of DI. King:

On 9/11/75, Walter Ricks, Senate Select Staff Member,

requested that he be briefed concerning the Bureau's relation-

ship with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Special Services

StatE, which was previous, according to licks, known as the al.

Activists Organization Group. Ricks in particular indicated

he was interested in knowing the criteria for dissemination

to IRS in the intelligence field and the type of information

received from IRS.

Ricks requested that, if possible, the

briefing be arranged for Monday, 9/15/75.

Ricks has been given access to IRS material in the

possession of the Bureau.

He has also reviewed in depth

material at IRS Headquarters.

John Elliff, Task Force Director of the Senate

Select Committee, has

indicated that their inquiry into the

IRs intelligence operation is considered a high priority item

by the Committee and that requests_ in this area should be, if

possible, expeditiously handled. In view of this, if possible

we should arrange a briefing for Ricks for 9/15/75.

This briefing was given on September 9, 1975, to

Mr. Loch Johnson and Mr. James Dick of the Senate Select

Committee.

At the outset of the brieling, they were advised

that the Department of justice is conducting an investigation to

determine whether any criminal culpability is involved regarding

surreptitious entries conducted by the Bureau in the past.

They were also advised that the Bureau is granting them access

to certain selected material obtained from the official files

of the Bureau.

They requested that the material in question

be held for them, and they would make arrangements to review

this material at a later date.

ESS

During the initial portion of the briefing, I explained

29

- 338

ur' to them the nature of an

"illegal" in Soviet espionage; the

importance of an illegal, and the difficulty of his detection.

Details of the karot, Hecklar, Gunson, and Gleme cases were

furnished.

The Senate Select Committee personnel asked numerous

questions

which

were answered to the best ability of my

: recollection.

Mr. Johnson

s fatticularly anxious to know whether

the CIA had knowledge of the existence of the illegals prior

their interrogation.

At one point he stated that the lack"of

such knowledge could be a pressure point in relations

between

RE:

illegals to remain in the United States whereas the CIA would

want the illegals returned to the Soviet Union.

Mr. Johnson that the illegal's mission by their Soviet service

was directed to activities in the United States and their

values to an American service in the Soviet Union would be

considerably limited to the compartmentation of the Soviet service.

The Senate Select Committee personnel were extremely

interested in the number of personnel and the composition of

the interrogation teams.

They inquired as to the pressures which

were exerted during the interviews.

They were assured that any

pressures were of a psychological nature only and that these

pressures were self-imposed by the nature of the illegal's

assignment to the United States and the fact that he had been

uncovered by the FBI and the further fact that the FBI could

prove the false nature of his legend.

At one

point during the briefing, Mr. Johnson inquired

as to the Bureau's knowledge of CIA employees employing

incommunicado interviews and he specifically referred to such

an interview which was set forth in the Rockefeller Commission

report.

I advised Mr. Johnson that I had no knowledge of

this interview.

In discussing the resettlement of the Karot informant,

the Senate Select Committee personnel were advised of CIA's

responsibility in this regard based on National Security Council

Directive.

Mr. Johnson raised a question as to the bona fides

of defectors, and I advised him that this was not within the

purview of the briefing of incommunicado interviews.

The Senate Select Committee specifically inquired

whether Mr. Hoover had cut off incommunicado interviews in 1966.

They were advised that this was not so.

They also asked whether

the Bureau might employ an incommunicado interview in the future.

I advised them that if the circumstances were such that we were

confronted with an illegal whose mission in the United States was

unknown and who could disappear from FBI coverage with relative

ease, we might favorably consider an incommunicado interview,

with Attorney General approval, if this would be in the best

interests of the country.

between this bureau and these sources, information supplled by

then is not being provided at this time as disclosure of such

Infomation could adversely affect ongoing investigations and

further information, a revieu of pertinent files fails to.

reflect that Gordon Clark furnished any information during the

serioua consequences both to the

informants themselves and to

ongoing FBI investigations, it ls requested that the information

concerning the current informant status of Raywond Roberts and

Gordon Clark be closely held.

With regard to Item 4I1, it 1s noted that David Richard

"Ney left" matters for a four-month perlod ln 1970, for which

he refused to sccept compensation. the following 1s a summary

of the information furnished to the Seattle Office on the dates

indicated:

On Apr1l 18, 1970, Sannes telephoned notifying of

che location of fugitive Charles Clark Marshall III.

On May 24 and 25, 1970, Sannes telephoned advising he

The purpose of this memorandum is to advise that

Lester B. Seidell, staff member of the Senate Select Committee, has

informed us that the Committee intends to interview former SA David Er

Todd, SAC Charles W. Bates, and Assistant Director Robert E. Gebhardt.

and to request that the aforementioned employees be released from existing

employment and or secrecy agreement for purposes of a staff interview.

On the evening of 5-29-75, Lester B. Seidelf telephonically

advised SA Paul V. Daly of this Division that in accordance with the

"guidelines" existing between the Committee and the various intelligence

agencies under review, ha was giving notice that he as a representative

of the Committee was going to San Francisco in approximately two to three

weeks, and it was his intention to interview SAC Charles W. Bates, former

/SA David E. Todd, and former Assistant to the Director Alan H. Belmont.

He also requested Assistant Director Gebhardt be made available for staff

interview in Washington, D. C. He asked that the Bureau take the necessary

steps to release the Agents from any existing employment or secrecy.

agreements. For the purposes of this interview, he stated he would inquire

of each of the interviewees as to their knowledge and participation in counter-

intelligence activities directed against the Black Panther Party. With regards

to this discussion, he specifically mentioned a Bureau airtel to San Francisco

dated 5-11-70, titled "Counterintelligence and Special Operations (Research

Section). " He stated this document was one of the documents released by

the court in the suit by newscaster Carl Stern. He was asked as to whether

he could deiine more precisely the argas to be covered in the interviews and

stated he could not inasmuch as he diahot khow the various aspects of the

in writing, which would coincide with the aforementioned topic of interview.

He described these interviews as being "abuse" interviews which according

to the Committee's understanding precludes the presence of an agency.

representative during interview. However, an Agent may be available for

consultation purposes.

Mir.

"Seidell was advised by SA Daly that former Assistant

to the Director Belmont was in poor health and that before attempting interview

of Mr. Belmont, he should ascertain his current physical condition. Mr. Seidell

requested SA Daly determine Mr. Belmont's physical condition. Assistant

Director /Cleveland advised SA Daly on 5-30-75 that Mr. Belmont was very

seriously ill and was suffering from the Shy Drager Syndrome. This informa-

tion was brought to the attention of John Elliff, Task Force Director on

Domestic Intelligence Activities of Captioned Committee, and Ellift expressed

dismay that Seidell had made an inquiry concerning the interview of Belmont.

Elliff requested that we not take any action concerning Seidell's request as

to Belmont at this time.

Former SA David E. Todd had previously contacted this

Division and as set forth in memorandum datea 5-16-75 from Legal Counsel

to J. B. Adams, he was advised of his rights, the existence of an employment

secrecy agreement signed by him, of the provisions of Attorney General

Order 501-73, and to his right to a private attorney. He was also advised

that an Agent would be made available for consultation during the interview

if he so desired. Mr. Todd did not indicate at this point whether he was

desirous of having a Bureau representative available for consultation during

interview. Todd, according to Seidell, stated he would not consider to be

interviewed in the absence of a release of a secrecy agreement by the Bureau.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) That former SA David E. Todd, Assistant Director

Robert E. Gebhardt, and SAC Charles W. Bates be released from their

employment and secrecy agreementsfor purposes of a staff interview concerning

our Cointelpro activities against the Black Panther Party.

asked that agencies of the intelligence community not respond to any

to Senators Church and Tower and avoid proliferation of this information

throughout the SSC staff. In view of this, it is recommended that the

enclosed material not be made avallable to the SSC stafi until it is dis-

cussed with the White House. I further urge that it be made clear to the

Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (SSC)

Ro: Request Pertaining to Warrantless

Electronic surveillances for

National Security Purposes

Queation #24b asked: "What have been the identities of the

agencies and the Presidential appointees who have initiated requests

for such surveillance for each year from 1986 to the present?"

With respect to this question, all surveillances noted in #24a

above were initiated upon a request from the National Security Agency

(NSA) except one which originated with the FBI. In the past all NSA

requests were made by the head of NSA or a responsible official thereof.

Currently all NSA recommendations, whether initial requests or continua-

tons for surveillances, are originated by General Lew Allen, Director,

NSA, and are considered by senior representatives of the Departments of

State and Defense and the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). The

requests to be recommended are then submitted over the signature of

Vir. William Colby, DCI, with the written concurrence of Dr. Henry

Kissinger, Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs.

Both the DCI and the Assistant to the President for National Security

Affairs indicate that the requests are necessary for the conduct of foreign

affairs matters which are important to the national security of the

United States. Based on the above recommendations, the Director of the

F'Bl then recommends Attorney General approval of the surveillances.

The chart which follows pertains to the questions $24e through

1, which are:

C. "How many such requests have been initiated by each

agency and each Presidential appointee for each year from 1966 to the

present?"

d. "How many of such requests inttiated by each agency and

each Presidential appointee have been approved by the Attorney General

for each year from 1988 to the present?"

Re: Fequest Pertaining to Warrantless

Electronic Surveillances for

National Security Purposes

The statistics for each year represent the number of surveil-

lance operations directed at encoded non-conversational communication

systems of a particular subject. Fegarding the statistics in columns e.

and f. it should be noted that one surveillance operation could generate

more than one continuance request in one year. Also, several of the

surveillance operations noted above involved plaintext non-conversational

as contrasted to encoded non-conversational communications.

Question #24g asked: "Tor each year from 1966 to the present,

how many such surveillances have been instituted in (1) the United States;

(2) North America, other than the United States; (3) South America;

(1) Western Lurope; (5) Bastern Lurope; (6) Alrica; (T) the Middle Last;

(8) Southeast Asia; (9) the rest of Asia?"

With respect to this question, all surveillance operations noted

above have been instituted within the United States.

Re: Request Pertaining to Warrantless

Electronic Surveillances for

National Security Purposes

NOTE CONTINUED:

The reference to "Presidential appointee" quoted in Question #24

is from the Attorney General's 6/24/75 letter to Senator Kennedy and

ultimately from the President's 12/19/74 memorandum to the Attorney

General. The SSC question attempts to measure by standard established

on 12/19/74 activities which occurred in 1966. Since a listing by

Presidential appointees would not account for all requests made it would

require an explanation that the Presidential appointee criteria came into

effect as a result of the Presidential Directive of 12/19/74. The directive

is the subject of a separate question which the Department has reserved

to itself for a response. No comment is therefore being directed to

Presidential appointees or the directive. In view of this the response

given here is appropriate.

This question pertains only to electronic surveillance of non-

conversational communications.

The statistics furnished were obtained

by review of all Telex and EPCE requests conveyed by the Eureau to the

Attorney General. These statistics do not include two 1975 surveillances

of closed circuit television (CCTV) requested by FBI and approved.

Classified 'Tep Secret" since it contains information from

the Presidential Directive, dated 12/19/74, which is so classified.

PURPOSE:

1h3.

To recommend that we send attached memorandum to

Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requesting income tax returns

on United States Student Press Association (USSPA) for years

1966 through 1970.

AAG Martin' piqn a ture pecured

IRS ling 0-14,

BACKGROUND:

The USSPA claims to operate a press service for

college newspapers and other organizations; however, the

news releases it prepares are similar to those prepared by

New Left underground press services, and are subscribed to

by underground newspaper publications throughout the country. id

These releases contain information which discredit the

Government and authority, and follow the New Left movement

in expression and content.

Records of the Public Information Division, Reference

Section, IRS, Washington, D: C., were reviewed by a Special

Agent of WEO

required to identify himself as

records were available to public.

These records indicated

USSPA incorporated in Washington, D. C., in 1966 and applied

for tax exemption with IRS stating it was organized for

educational purposes.

Records available also indicated

that for the taxable year ending 8/31/69 USSPA had income

from contributions and grants in excess of $63,000. In view

of the New Left type activity engaged in by USSPA and

White House interest in sources of New Left funds, additional

investigation is warranted to determine sources of funds and

assets of this organization and its activities. If you

approve,

attached memorandum should be returned to the

Domestic Intelligence Division so that these incone tar

returns can be obtained and reviewed.

ReBureau letter, 11/8/71, with enclosures.

Enclosed for Denver are copies of referenced Bureau

letter, together with enclosures which are self-explanatory,

being furnished Denver since the College Press Service (CPS)

is now located in that Division:

Perusal of the Bureau's letter and enclosed material

reveals the Carnegie Foundation contributed $48,500 to the

United States Student Press Association (USSPA) during the

period ending 8/31/69, and the Ford Eoundation contributed

$2,000 to the USSPA during the period ending 8/31/70. From

the information submitted, it would appear the USSPA and

its subsidiary, the CPS, could not exist without these and

other Foundation grants.

The Bureau may desire to consider discussing this

matter, on a high level, with officials of one or all of

the Foundations involved. Further, the Bureau may desire to

submit to these officials press releases of the CPS which

have been furnished to the Bureau by the WFO for the purpose

of informing Foundation officials of the nature of the

material which is disseminated for reproduction in a great

number of college newspapers

by

the CPS.

yse

In accordance with a request made by Springfield, this

I recommends that uncertified copies of Dunham's income tax

returns for the past three years be obtained from Internal

Revenue Service.

• Charles Koen, former head of the Black Liberators, a

black extremist group in St. Louis, Missouri, which patterns its

activities after those of the Black Panther Party, has described

Dunham as being very important to him because she handles "inter-

-

coniacio."

and CP front group affiliation, is closely associated with black

extremists 'and is possibly Charles Koen's financial angel.

Dunham, a Negro dancer and choreographer, is director of the

Performing Arts Center,. Southern Illinois University, East St. Louis,

Illinois. She owns property in Haiti."

In connection with our investigation to develop

information concerning the sources of funds of black extremists

a review of the subject's Federal income tax returns is pertinent.

In addition, there is a possibility that this check may disclose

a violation of Internal Revenue laws which could result in

action against the subject.

(581. 8/5/21,

PURPOSE:

To recommend that we send attached memorandum to

Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requesting income tax returns

on United States Student Press Association (USSPA) for years

1966 through 1970.

BACKGROUND:

The USSPA claims to operate a press service for

college newspapers and other organizations; however, the

news releases it prepares are similar to those prepared by

New Left underground

press services, and are subscribed to

by underground newspaper publications throughout the country.

These releases contain information which discredit the

Government and authority, and follow the New Left movement

in expression and content.

Records of the Public Information Division, Reference

Section,

IRS, Washington, D. C., were reviewed by a Special

Agent of WFO

who was

not

required to identify himself as

records were available to public. These records indicated

USSPA incorporated in Washington, D. C., in 1966 and applied

for tax exemption with IRS stating it was organized for

educational purposes.

Records available also indicated

that for the taxable

year ending 8/31/69 USSPA had income

from contributions and grants in excess of $63,000. In view

of the New Left type activity engaged in by USSPA and

White House interest in sources of New Left funds, additional

investigation is warranted to determine sources of funds and

assets of this organization and its activities.

If you

approve,

attached memorandum should be returned to the

Domestic Intelligence Division so that these

income, tax:?:

returns can

be obtained

and reviewed.

ReBureau letter, 11/8/71, with enclosures.

Enclosed for Denver are copies of referenced Bureau

• letter, together with enclosures which are seli-explanatory,

being furnished Denver since the College Press Service (CPS)

is now located in that Division.

Perusal of the Bureau's letter and enclosed material

reveals the Carnegie Foundation contributed $48,500 to the

United States Student Press Association (USSPA) during the

period ending 8/31/69, and the Ford Foundation contributed

$2,000 to the USSPA during the period ending 8/31/70. From

the information submitted, it would appear the USSPA

and

its subsidiary, the aS, could not exist without these and

other Foundation grants.

The Bureau may desire to consider discussing this

matter, on a high level, with officials of one or all of

the Foundations involved. Further, the Bureau may desire to

submit to these officials press releases of the CPS which

have been furnished to the Bureau by the WFO for the purpose

of inforning Foundation officials of the nature of the

material which is disseminated for reproduction in a great

number of college newspapers by the CPS.

ELSHA.

This IHM is classified "Sacret" because

contains information from NY 4092-S% a source which is

furnishing highly

sensitive information concerning the

racial situation in the US and Communist influence therein.

It is felt that this classification is necessary to protect

this valuable sounce.

It is noted that the original plan was for

JONES to arrange with KING to meet with himself and

LEVISON in Atlanta on either Sunday or Monday: May 2,3,

1965. NY

instituted surveillance of JONES and placed him

on the United Airlines Flight for Atlanta with HARRY

BETATONTE on the morning of 4/30/65. NY subsequently

received information that JONES was returning to NY on

Saturday, 5/1/55, which along with information that KING

was going to Philadelphia, indicated that the conference

between KINGs LaVISON and JONES would not take pläce.

It also was felt that since JONES was going

to Atlanta on Friday that he would be the person to bring

KING the speech he requested fos his Philadelphia speaxing

engagemeat.

When information was developed by Philadelphia

that KING was coming to NY on Saturday evening, a sur-

veillance was conducted on LEVISON to coves any meeting he

might make with KING.

as indicated by the attached IHM,

LEVISON did not. meet

with KING in NY

on the night of 5/1/65,

and, in fact, as LEVISON stated there was a

complete mis-

understanding between the

three of them and that JoNes

should

arrange a new meeting now tentatively scheduled for

May 10 or 11, 1965 in Atlanta.

ON

A confidential source furnished the following

information concerning contacts between Stanley Levison

and Clarence Jones on May 2, 1965:

Levison told Jones that he saw the "person" in

Philadelphiaas he was being ushered into a meeting and this

"person"

told him that he would see Levison later.

Levison

said that he replied he would not be around. Jones stated

that the only reason he would have stayed around would have

been for the three of them getting together.

Jones added

that he was waiting to hear from either one of them as to.

whether he would go to Philadelphia. Levison commented

that apparently there was a conplete misunderstanding

between the three of them and asked Jones to call Philadelphis

and work out a meeting in the near future.

(It is noted that Martin Luther King was in

Philadelphia over the weekend of May 1 and 2, where he was

to address a bar association group).

wuther king who told Jones that things went weil on May

I, 1965, and that Stan (Levison) brought the "statement".

King added that he used the "thing" he worked up in New

York because he did not have time to look at the material

Stan brought him before going on stage.

Communist Influence in Racial Matters

King mentioned that he would return to Atlanta

and be there until May 12. when he would go to New York

meeting. Jones told him that there are a couple of

pressing matters, both relating to the New York Office (of the

Southern Christian Leadership Conference) (SCLC) that needed

to be discussed because "our friend" is going on a trip

They tentatively set a meeting for

• themselves and

"'OUr

friend" for May 11, 1965 in Atlanta.

The source has previously furnished information

showing that when King and Jones discuss

"our friend" they

mean Stanley Levison

Jones also said that when King attends an

Administrative Committee meeting (of SCLC) on May 6,7,

1965. he hopes king will discuss the Summer Community

Organ-

ization and Political Education Project because this is a

problem between the SCIc and the Student Nonviolent

Coordinating Committee.

Jones and King also discussed the handling of

the proceeds from the "Broadway Answers Selma" show (held

In New York City on April 4, 1965).

King said the group

should check with wilie Branton (phonetic) about the money

because he has handled gifts In the past:

King wants the

Anti-Defmation League to give the money directly to the

Southern Regional Council since this league now has the

money fron the show.

Jones agreed to discuss the matter

with Branton (phonetic) who is now in Atlanta.

Wiley Branton was chosen recently by Vice

President Humphrey to be Executive Secretary of the

President's Council on Equal Opportunity.

Later, Levison was again in contact with, Jones

who said ha had

spoken to King.

Jones stated that King

said the first chance they can

meet will be the nights of

May 10 and 11 in Atlanta.

Levison said that he could make

it and Jones added that all that remained was to confirm

the date with King.

levison proposed that thay neet before seeing

King, stating this would give them a framework from which

to work and Jones agreed.

Levison said the two main things

to be considered are, the organization of the SCLe to

make it a real organization and the questions around King

personally.

Jones advised that King

had placed top priority

on a plan

to find someone who could be what amounts to

an executive vice president.

King told Jones

that if he

knew anyone qualified

he could hire him. Levison

said he

was glad King felt this way

and that they would discuss

Levison said he would like to suggest Larry Perkins

if the United Negro College Fund,

Jones remarked that he

doubted that Perkins would be willing to go to Atlanta.

Levison further stated that they had to find

someone

who would work well with Jones and for this

reason it is important that he and Jones find

this position.

Jones commented that the problem is that

there

is a brakdown because there is nobody to take

charge

Levison then added "in a certain sense it is

what I do in New York in the New York Office', He never

has any problems in connection with it because I make

the decisions and then Adele (Kanter of the New York SCLC

Office) just goes ahead and does it and that is what he

needs in Atlarta on a far larger scale."

Levison and Jones agreed io discuss this at their

next meeting.

HELEN asked WINSTON if he knew who the person was.

WINSTON said he knew him very well which is why he was

interested.

She also asked if WINSTON wanted to know what

WINSTON told her to

generally size "him" up that "he" was in the Soviet Union

STANLEY LEVISON told CLARENCE JONES that one HAROLD

WEAVER (ph) was interested in a possible job with

MARTIN (LUTHER KING) •

LEVISON said he had a tentative

appointment with him for 2:30 p.m. on Friday (5/14/65)

at JONES' Office. JONES said he thought that would be

all right.

On May 14, 1965, a Special Agent of the NYO

observed an unknown male Negro departing from CP

Headquarters and identified a photograph of WEAVER as

that person.

On the afternoon of the same date, surveillances

were conducted at CLARENCE JONES' office, 165 Broadway,

NYC, and at STANLEY LEVISON's office, 1841 Broadway, NYC.

JONES was observed returning to his office at 2:35 p.m., but

LEVISON and WEAVER were not observed.

King Declares Himself Concerning Vietnam

Hartin Luther King, Jr., declared in a speech on

July I, 1995, that he and his aides would study the use of

"peace rallies" and so-called teach-ins to bring pressure

to bear in foreign policy matters.

Speaking at Petersburg,

Virginia, King reportedly said that he "was not going to

sit by and see war escalated vithout saying anything about it,"

and he called for a negotiated settlement, demanding that we

"even negotiate with the Vietcong."

As head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,

one of the main civil rights organizations in this country, king's

announced intention to inject himself and his organization into

foreign policy issues was significant for several reasons.

Conmunist Influence on Kirg Relative to Vletnam

Of primary significance in connection with King's

announcement is the fact that several of his advisors with

communist backgrounds are known to have been in favor of having

King inject himself into the peace movement in opposition to

our foreign policy on Vietnam.

Stanley Levison

civil rights novement Concerning Vietnam, Levison, a long time

communist whose, secret nembership. in the Communist Party lArg

has been established as recently

as July,

1963,

a member of the Communist Party in 1947, and Jones held & position

¡of leadorship during the nid-1950's in the Labor Youth League,

an organization which has been designated as subversive pursuant

to Executive Order 10450€

It should also be noted that another individual.

with a communist background who has been close to King wrote

& speech which King's wife, Coretta, made at an "Imergency

Rally on Vietnan"

at Madison square Garden in New York Clty

on. June 8, 1965.

The speech was written by Bayard Rustin and

was given by Coretta King in place of her husband at the Rally,

the purpose of which was to ask President Johnson to stop

somoing. seel a cease ille: and press Ior negotiations 21

connection with the situation in Vietnam. Rustin, Who also

spoke at the Rally, vas, during the early 1940's,

a member of

the Young Communist League, an organization which has been

designated as subversive pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

The Party Line Concerning Vietnam

The determination of King's advisors with conmunist

backgrounds to have him inject himself ints the peace movement

surrounding the Vietnan situation at this time is another

significant factor bearing on his announced intention to do so.

The announcement comes at a time when the Communist Party, USA,

has placed the Viecnam situation foremost among issues about

which to center comnunist action in this country.

Beginning in the Fall of 1964, the Party began issuing

instzuctions to rank-and-file menbers to concentrate on the

Vietnan issue.

Since that time, the Party has issued & virtual

avalanche of directives to all Party districts containing

instructions on actizities to be followed to achieve the Party's

objectives

in regard to Vietnam.

Condemning the "military

aggression" of the United States against North Vietnam, Party

Headquarters instructed district leaders to organize activities

in trade unions, youth groups, religious organizations, peace

groups, and the

like. It instructed that steps be taken to

cooperate in regard to activities of these groups involving

picket lines, peace walks, student assemblies, and demonstrations

aimed at protesting this Nation's foreign policy position on

Vletnam.

THE POSITION OF MARTEN LUTHER KING, JR.

AND THE CONMUNISE PARTY, USA, ON VIETNAM

Illustrating the increased tempo of communist activity

in this regard is the lact that an analysis made of communiet

propaganda media auring the six-nonth period beginning January 1,

1965, reveals that the "peace-in-Vietnam" theme was the

predominant issue exploised.

Implementing the Party Line

Communists, their

supporters, and their sympathizers

have responded to the Party's campaign and the Party Instructions

on a broad scale.

Typical was the communist exploitation of

the student uprising which took place on the campus of the

University of California at Berkeley, California, this past school

Selzing the opportunity presented on that

occasion,

Herbert Aptheler, a leading national functionary of the Communist

Party, appeared and spoke at a demonstration involving sone

1,300

students in february, 1955.

Encouzaging the students to

demonstrate in protest against the united states foreign palley

on Vietnam, Aptheker declared that the war in Viernam was the

fault of the unitca states and a direct result or our Intervention

there.

Similarly, communists and individuals with cormunist

backgrounds have exploited opportunities of a like nature in

connection with the widespread demonstrations which have

occurred in the country this past year. One of the best examples

of the Panty's tactics in this regard involves the communist

inspired W. E. B. DuBois Clubs of anerica.

At a national.

conference of that organization held in Chicago, Illinois,

during the last three days of lay, 1965, plans for mass protests

against the policy o1 the United States in Viecham, ties with

international tront groups, and cooperation with other organizations.

to protest United States polley were the principal toplos of dis-

• cussion:

policy in Vietram, It was

stated that this

organization, which is one of the more militant civil rights

groups, would attempt to recruit 2,000 people this summer for

the purpose of surrounding the White House in a sit-down in

September.

The Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee is

a prime target for communist infiltration since it has made

clear that it will accept support for its endeavors from anyone,

including communists.

This announcement of the plans of the Student Non-

Violent Coordinating Committee is of particular interest because

it constitutes the injection of a civil rights group into

foreign policy protests, something the communists are most

desirous of achieving to further their own objectives.

I can be clearly seen from the communist directives

that the key to communist action on the central issue of

Vietnam today is infiltration of all groups in our society

through which the communists might in any way work to create

opposition to our foreign policy. Sinca the civil rights movement

enbraces widespread groups and supposters constituting a major

force on the national scene, the communist Party sees in 1ù a

ready-made vehicle to organize widespread protests in line with

Its program of opposition to foreign policy in the Party's

campaign is carefully executed.

King's Influence Potential for Party Exploitation

In this regard, Martin Luther King's emergence on

the seene with the announced intention of participating in

protests against our foreign policy in Vietnan cannot be lightly

dismissed or underestimated. Whether it constitutes a witting

os unwitting move on his part in relation to serving communist

objectives, it holds out the prospect of additional support

being engendered among civil rights groups for protest

demonstrations against our current policy in Viccham, and In

turn holds out the prospect of additiona. opportunities ioi

communist exploitation of the situation.

THE POSITION OF MARTIN LUTHER

KING, JR.

AND THE CONLUNIST FARTY, USA, ON VIETNAM

As to King's vitiing or unwitting role in this matter,

it is most interesting to note that the heads of two other

principal civil rights organizations in the country today have

taken a position contrary to king's by opposing a merger of the

issues of civil rights and Vletnam.

James Farmer, head of the

Congress of Facial Equality, "old that organization's convention

at Durhan, North Carolina, on July 5, 1965, that their

organization should stay oui of the peace movement and concentrate

on cival righes.

Roy Wilkins, head of the National Association

for the Advancement of Colored People, is reported as having

commented concerning King's involvement in the Vietnam situation

to the effect that his, Wilkinss, organization was too busily

engaged in vivil rights matters to have any time left for

becoming involved in the Viernan crisis.

Dear Matarasso:

Russell War Crimes Tribal.

We are asteing you now to

join us in an action concerning the crimes perpetrated

against the Black Panthers and do whatever

possible to

make these crimes known and create a committee support

ing the Panthers with signatures as you did in opposi

tion to the Vietnamese War. If possible, money shoula

also be raised to help then in their present legal.

battles.

The primary purpose of such a committee would

be to demystify the absurd and ignoble myth created by

the American and European press which portrays the

Panthers as criminals and rapists.

Moreover, we wish

to

alert the people oi Europe to the terrifying realization

that the Government is seeking to exterminate the leader-

ship of the Black Panther Party. At this moment the

State of Connecticut is dezd set on trying to frame

Panther Chairnan Bobby Seale and

execute him in the

electric chair.!

We have naturally at our disposal snotographs,

taped interviews, the testimony of lawyer, luke

licKissack, and any othor meterial which nay be necessary

for you.

We out ourselves at your disposal and ask your

advise as to

Interview of FBI Special Agent (BA)

3. Robert Newton by S8C Staff Henbers

No spocific communications are recalled. Horever,.

it la possible that other types of communications

such ag tolo-

types, airtols or letters might have been furnished to FBI

Headquarters if the ocoasion so dictated.

Did the local police department assist the FBI In thia

Investigation?

A!

information on individuals night have been brought to the

instances of this.

It was noted by Ms. Talley and Me. Debreo that the

report concerning. Women's Liberation Movement, which they had in

their possession, reflected diasemination to other government

agencies.

How was this dissonination determined?

A.

I do not know at this point in time specifically why

these other government agencies were furnished a copy of the report.

It is apparent from the above that questions raised

by Ms. Talley and Ms. Dedrod dealt mainly with procedures and had

primarily with adminiatrative handling by the iür of the

Women's Llberation Movement case.

Me. Dooreo commented at the conclusion of the Interview

that there could be additional queations as they delve deeper

Into such matters and felt that they would possibly wish to

recontact me in the future 1f the need ariser.

Included in the information being dollvered to

the SSC 1n response to Item 1 18 testimony by the FBI

Director before the House Subcomittee on Appropriations

for Elscal years 1965, 1966 and 1967. A review of the

Director's cestimony for fiscal years 1963, 1964 and 1968

was conducted but no edditional information was located

pertinent to the SSC requeste concerning Ring.

The following should be noted concerning Item 11.

A revIew of logical files at FBI Headquarters disclosed

two Instances indicating that electronic survelllances of

King vera effected by state or local agancies or govertments.

These Instances involve the New York CIty Polica Department

(NYCPD) and the Dade County Sherl£f's Office, Miant, Florida.

FBI field offices In New York City and Miant were Instructed

to contact appropilate officlals of these tro dapartments

to secure their comments relative to the FBI Ieleasing to

the SSC naterial Involving theix electronic survelllances

of Ring.

On September 9, 1975, Deputy Chief Jemes Mechan,

Intolligence Division, NYCPD, advised that his department

had been unable to locate any record of an electronie

surveillance of King. He advised that the NYCPD considers

10 to

an elect considere

Information In FBI flles regarding any such surveillance

as FBI recorda and that any disclosure of same is the

FBI'a prerogative.

On September 8, 1975, Mi. Walter J. Laugheed,

ABRistant Director, and MI. Robert Wennerhols, Legal Counsel, -

both of the Dade County Public Safety Departuent (DCPSD),

were advised of the SSC request, Laugheed advised that

his depertuent has no objection to the FBI reloasing to the

SSC Information in FBI files indicating electronic survell-

lances of king by his department, He furtber advised that

any requests by the SSC for Infornation regarding King In

the files of the DCPSD Mould have to be in the form of a

SENATE SELECI COMITTEE ON INTEZLIGENCE ACIIVITIES (SSC)

The matertal in FBI files relating to the above

matters in response to Item 11 is being delivered to the SSC

with this memorandum.

With respect to the excisions in materials being

delivered herewith, where no sotation appears as to reason

for excision, the excision was made for the reason that the

Information actually summarizes of quotes frol conversations

monitored during electronic survelllances of Ring. In some

cases, 1t can be ascertained precisely what Information in

FBI ffles came from electronic surveillances of King; hovever,

there exist areas here documentation of the information 1a

not precise and no accurate determination can be made.

Therefore, no assurances can be given that portions of the

naterial being furnished do not contain Infornation developed

as a result of elactronic survelllances of king.

With the delivery of the materiala with this

memorandum, we have fulfilled all requests contelned in the

July 8, 1975, request.

before the Commission on Civil Disorder.

Mr. Elliff

reguested a search be made to determine if a mamorandum

existed which indicated MI. Hoover had appeared before such

a Commiasion.

A review was conducted and a memorandum dated

August 1,

1967, from C. D. DeLoach to Mr. Tolson captloned

2.

Was there a memorandum concerning the

expansion of the AI to inalude Individuals of local

prominence?

Memorandum of G. C. Moore to Mr. W. C. Sullivan

dated November 22, 1967, which is included in materlal sub-

mitted under item

do above, answers this question.

3.

Were Individuals Included on both the AI and

the SI and, if so, wasn't this a duplication of effort?

Individuals were included on both the AI and the

SI, however, this was not necessarily a duplication of

effort inasmuch as the SI was to be utilized in the

apprehension and detention of individuals considered

dangerous and the AI was an administrative aid to follow

the activities and movement of individuals attempting to

cause racial disorders.

4. When did the SI become automated and was the

RI ever automated?

The SI became automated during the early 1950a

and was updated throughout the years with the advancement

of computer technology and purchases by the FBI of more

advanced eguipment.

The first electronio computer was

obtained by the FBI during 1955 and the SI was incorporated

In this equipment. Following discontinuance of the SI in

1971, the Adex was continued in the computer system.

While

stored in the automatic data processing (ADP) equipment, the

SI and Adex have been and are being maintaned in an "off-line"

manner. The RI-A was placed on ADP the same as the SI.

RI-B was maintained at the field level only and was never

placed in the ADP equipment.

5. Has the Bureau's copy of the Attorney General's

portfolio concerning the Emergency Detention Program (EDP)

been returned?

As mentioned above, one copy of the Attorney

General's portfolio concerning the EDP was located at

FBI Headquarters and 1s being forwarded to the Department

of Justice.

6. Who were the Bureau individuals who (a)

maintained the Attorney General's portfolio during 1968,

and (b) involved with the EDP during the 1940s?

The following individuals were identifled through

review of pertinent communications during time period in

question

(a) - 1968-C. D. Brennan, P. F. Enlow, T. P. Rosack,

(b) 1946-D. M. Ladd, J.

C. Strickland; 1948-Lish Whitson,

W. H. Winterrowd, J. W. Yeagley.

7.

When aid the Department start revlewing and

approving the SI list?

Matters pertaining to the old Custodial Detention

Ilst were first referred to the Department during March,

1941. Copies of the SI were submitted to the Department

during 1951, and the Department, on a continuing basis, re-

viewed matters pertaining to the gI except for brief periode

of time when -junds and manpower were not available until the

SI was discontinued in 1971. Additional comments regarding

this question may be located under item 4b above.

; 8.

Was there a form used by the Department con-

cerning the continuance or cancellation of individuals on

In view of the growing problems created by local Be

rabble rousers from the standpoint of internal security, it

is felt necessary that the criteria for recommending

individuals to be included in this Index should be expanded.

Under the existing criteria the Rabble Rouser Index

served as an index only for individuals who traveled exten-

sively engaging in rabble rousing activities and was limited

to racial disorder. The expanded criteria will cover

(1) agitators who have demonstrated by their actions and

speeches that they have a propensity for fomenting disorder

of a racial and/or security nature and (2) have attracted

I such attention, nationally or locally, as to be of significant

interest with regard to the over-all civil disturbance

picture.

par

questi

In the attached proposed SAC Letter instructing the

field with regard to the expanded criteria, it is being

pointed out to the field that it is the intent of this

criteria to have within each division as well as nation-wide

an index of agitators of all types whose activities have a

bearing on the national security.

With regard to this interview, SCHMIT advised he

she was unknown to

the two attornies who were conducting the

interview as they had to introduce themselves

to her. The

atcornies'

names were JIM DICK and TOM DAWSON.

Regarding his conference with former Attorney General

ROBERT F. KENNEDY, SCHHIT stated

that at the time of this con-

ference there was

a general criminal

intelligence conference

being held in the NO and that at one point in this conference

he was asked

Regarding what he discussed with the Attorney

General, SCHMIT stated that he could not really recall the

specifics, but probably discussed the programs we were

conducting

such as SAM, SUN, GUS and Z, because

in effect

we were telling

the Attorney General what accomplishments

we were making, so SCHMIT felt that these would have been

mentioned.

lecalls.

However, he could not specifically recall the

cussed contemporary espionage cases at the troo

In addition to this conference, SChMIT advised

that KENNEDY received a second

briefing

which he, SCHMIT,

not recall.

However, when he was discussing

his testi-

mony with former Nyo Supervisor FRANCIS GALLANT, GALLANT

SCHMIT that KENNEDY came back a

second time at a later

and that he, GALLANT, brought KENNEDY up to date in

what

was being done in the espionage field.

SCHMIT stated,

however,

he did not even recall this

happening after GALLANT

nad cold him on

a previous occasion.

SCHMIT stated that all of this information,

including the fact that

had a right to review the

trans-

cript, would be placed

in his memo and he would furnish this

memo

to the NYO, to be forwarded to the Bureau.

Review of the pertinent files in Division III failed

to reflect any record of former SAC JOSEPH SCHMIT's discussion

with the then Attorney General ROBERT F. KENNEDY.

Supervisors and Agents with extensive experience in

the field of espionage were contacted and did recall that former

Attorney General KENNEDY visited the NYO during early 1960s, but

individuals

were not aware of the details of the discussions

which took place in the NO between the then Attorney General

KENNEDY and the executives of the NYo.

It is brought to the attention of the Bureau that the

Nyu did not attempt to review the criminal intelligence files

and will take no action in this area unless advised by the

Bureau.

ADDENDUM:

INTELLIGENCE DIVISION

WOC : 1hb

9/11/75

Mary Triplett is a retired employee who worked in

the Intelligence Division.

She processed the Hunter mail (mail

intercepts received from CIA) for the Bureau. She is single

nd is 60-plus years old. Miss Iriplett was a very intens

erson, and Division personnel who worked with her over th

years believe, should she be interviewed by the Staff of the

Senate Select Committee (SSC) without the benefit of an Agent

present, it could adversely affect her physical and mental

health.

The Justice Department is looking into possible

criminal sanctions on behalf of CIA and FBI personnel involved

the statue pe see could to co as that as neerient

in light of the Department's inquiry.

Previously, the Department, with the concurrence of

the White House, did not make available for an abuse interview

two female clerical employees of the Newark Office without

these employees being accompanied by a Departmental representative.

Under current guidelines for interviews during abuse situations,

we can seek to have a representative present during such an

interview subject to the approval of SSC.

Miss Triplett will be made aware of the Department's

inquiry and advised that she may desire to seek legal counsel.

As you are aware, the Attorney General is presently considering

the legal question as to whether the Department can provide

legal counsel to former and current FBI employees.

Until such

time as the Attorney General arrives at a decision, it is

felt

we should recommend to the Department that Miss Triplett's

interview be postponed.

ADDENDUM CONTINUED:

RECOMMENDATION:

1. Prior to furnishing the SSC the current address

of Miss Triplett, the Legal Counsel Division will query the

Department as to the status of the Attorney General's decision

regarding legal representation for former and current employees.

2. In the event the Attorney General determines

legal representation cannot be provided Miss Triplett, we will

attempt to obtain the SSC's approval to have an Agent present

during the interview of Miss Triplett to assure her the Bureau

has not abandoned her.

Dear Mr. Levi:

'ALL' INFORMATION CONTAINED

HEREIN IS UNCLASSICIED

DATE SO SEAL RU

At the close of his testimony on September 25,

Mr. Charles Brennan, former Chief of Domestic Intelligence

Division, indicated that he could not answer a question

posed to him by me.

The question relates to the status of

a so-called "closed" FBI Domestic Intelligence case file.

Suppose that the individual who is subject of the file is a

member of the military service or applies for employment

with a federal government agency, and the agency requests an

FBI name check.

What information, would be provided to the

federal agency by the FBI as the result of that name check?

What information would be provided to that agency if the FBI

conducted a background investigation on that individual?

With respect to surreptitious entries for the pur-

pose of installing electronic surveillance equipment, which

are referred to on page three of the September 24, 1975 letter

from Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., to myself, I would appreciate

answers to the following additional questions:

1. What has been the number of such entries for

each year since 1960?

2.

What has been the number of separate targets

for each year since 1960?

3.

What has been the total number of separate

targets since 1950?

I would also request access, under agreed upon pro-

cedures, to a list of such targets, and the dates of the entries.

Sincerely,

Re my memorandum to you 4/11/75, by which

approval was obtained for the maintenance of the file relating

to captioned matter in Room 4063, J. Edgar Hoover Building,

rather than for the maintenance of it by the Files and

This matter concerns the Bureau-wide effort to service

the numerous requests of the U. S. Senate Select Committee on

Intelligence Activities.

We are still immersed in this effort and

the absolute necessity

for maintenance of the file with our

Project relating to Senstudy 75 continues.

Memorandum to All Bureau Officials and Supervisors

7/24/75, requires semiannual renewal for maintenance of files

away from the Files and Communications Division.

In accordance

with the provisions of that requirement and because of the

compelling reasons for maintaining the file in place as we havé

for the past six months, we are recommending it continue as t

On 9/23/75, Arthur Harrigan and Mark Gitenstein of the -

Senate Select Committee telephonically contacted SA Paul V. Daly

of this Division and advised him that the Committee desired to dè-

pose a current Bureau official concerning the Bureau's relationship

with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)

and, in particular, requests

concerning tax returns and audits. Gitenstein stated, ultimately

the Bureau official deposed would

subsequently testify in open

hearings with an IRS representative concerning these matters.

They stated that the interview of the Bureau official involved

would be based on documents currently in possession of the Com-

mittee relating to the Bureau and IRs.

They indicated the Committee would prefer only one

witness from the Bureau for this particular matter; however,

it was acceptable if the Bureau should have two witnesses.

Gitenstein also stated the Bureau will be informed of

what documents were

going to be used in the deposition and testi-

money prior to the deposition being taken. After consultation

with Inspector Hunter E. Helgeson, it was determined that the

appropriate Bureau representative

to be deposed and to testaty

was Section Chief Robert-I. Shackelford inasmuch as he wasta

Section Chief of a section which made requests in this area.

In this regard, it is noted that a representative of

the Committee has been briefed concerning these matters by

Liaison Officer Bernard C. Rachner and Sections Chiefs Robert L.

Shackelford and Joseph G. Deegan.

Regarding our request for so-called IRS audits,

Gitenstein was asked to explain exactly what he meant by

particular terminology inasmuch as our request generally per-

tained to income tax information and in some instances a

notification to IRS that a particular individual was the...t

subject of an investigation who had not filed an income tax

statement despite being employed.

Gitenstein could not explain

what the Committee meant by the term audits and implied that it

may have been the action that IRS took on information furnished

by the Bureau which action was initiated by IRS on its own.

Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., Special Counsel for Intel-

Ligence Coordination in the Department, was telephonically

contacted by SA Daly on 9/23/75 at which time he advised he

was familiar with the Committee request concerning the testi-

witness for testimony concerning this matter.

RECOMMENDATIONS :

(1) That Robert L. Shackelford be released from

existing employment agreement and the provisions of the Code

f Federal Regulations for purposes of being deposed anc

testifying concerning the Bureau's relationship with IRS as

stated above.

(2) That Legal Counsel Division will advise the

Committee that the Bureau representative to be deposed and

testify concerning this matter will be Section Chief Robert L.

Shackelford.

On 9/12/75, John T. Elliff, head of the Domestic

Task Force for captioned Committee, was contacted regarding

the 212175 interview of former SA Edward Gamber by the Senate

Select Committee Staff. By way of background, former Agents

of the FBI were contacted without prior Bureau knowledge by

the Senate Select Committee Staff Members concerning their

knowledge of the Bureau's relationship with Sam Jaffee.

Jaffee is a former source of the Bureau.

Upon learning of these contacts without prior

notification of the Bureau, this matter was discussed with

Elliff and Elliff assured SA Paul V. Daly of this Division

that prior to future interviews concerning this matter he

would insure that the Bureau would receive prior notice.

During the course of this conversation, it was specifically

mentioned that the Committee may be arranging an interview

with former SA Gamber. Subsequently, the Committee did

interview Gamber and the Bureau was not notified prior to

the interview.

When this matter was brought to the attention of

Elliff on 9/12/75, he indicated he would look into this matter

and ascertain why the. Bureau had not previously been notified.

RE: REINTERVIEN OF FBI SPECIAL AGENT (SA)

WILLIAM D. CAMPBELL BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

Epstein replied that it was a change in procedure and then

read the waiver to Campbell and asked Campbell if he had any

objection to the reinterview.

Campbell stated that he had no

objection. Campbell also advised Epstein that he felt he had

done nothing wrong but that if someone else thought he had

done something wrong, he certainly vould Ilke to discuss 1t.

with an attorney.

Epstein then asked, "ho made your assignment to the

Laboratory while you were working at the washington Flold Office

(FFO); was 1t Mr. Belter?"

Campbell replied that he did not

recall specifically, but that Belter was his supervisor at the

time and in all probability Belter would have made the assign-

ment. Epstein hesitated and said he felt that Campbell was

not convinced that he, Campbell, vanted to continue with the

relntervlew..

Bostein then said that the matter he wanted to discuss

was the period Campbell had spent in the Laboratory while st1ll

1 had

assigned to WFO. Epstein asked how much time had elapsed from

the time that Campbell had performed a monitoring function at

the Willard Hotel until Campbell reviewed certain tapes in the

Laboratory. Campbell responded that he did not specifically

recall but thought lt was several months.

Epstein again hesitated and stated he thought Campbell

had some reservations about the interview.

Epstein asked 1f

Campbell was an attorney and Campbell responded in the negative.

Campbell Indicated he did not have any objections to the

continuation of the reinterview.

Campbell stated that everything

ho did in connection with "this investigation" was in response

to ordere he had received from his FBI superiors and that 1f

anything turned out to be in a gray area, Campbell felt that the

Bureau would assist in representing him.
