Comments. on Cuban Revolutionary Council

We have reduedd tha so-called civil section budget
(admin) to thé Latest figure of $125,000 for Septeaber.
Monthly admin costs for this organizatioa used to mm almost
$180,000, if wa included their so-called military section
(nich was calories primarily for militery staff recruiters,
rentals for offices, médical, etc.). Our dependency pay-

ments are now at $313,700 monthly. Thia may focrease slightly ©

since we are resuming monthly paymento to widows again after
their lvmp eum death benefit payments run cut.

To date in PY 62 (including September payments) I vould
_ we have expended on the CRC ($1,208,775 for atrieely dao
pendency payments and $466,000 for admin and related charges.

Re Cable IH 20364 {Kent's Meoting u/Miro on 28 August 61)

Statement: Miro'’s claim to have Lined up fiftaen orga
nizations and independents for an enlarged CRC,
Soaments This’ isa usual claim of all leaders froa Garcia

Kobly. The plain facts are that any leader who can prove
official U. 3, backing (policy and funda) will undoubtedly
be able to Lina up backing since the aan vith the purse vine
the game, ¥H/4/Prop Points out that Coate Aguero, for example,
is not working with the CRC and doesn't intend te, unless he
would Imoy ths CRC is the organization,
on tho qwestion of funding the ‘professional groups wo |
foreed (DRE, DAR, ACJ, FORD, CFC) we still feol we should do
80. In seo cases, it is doubtful whether they would buy cae
control of funds, To date, they have done good work under our
direction and funding; whether they would do aa wall affiliated
with the CRC is a question, In any case, WAVE sayo they will

try to keep Miro a little more informed on the groups’ activitios,
On the chargo that Swan ts under "Bstistiano" Banagemene,

- this fs false. AHFALM4, who was running it during the otrive,

liberal thinking at present, but thie will be renodied in
the immediate future. Conta Aguoro will participate in
future programming, We sea no reason why CRC control of
Swan would sake it any better instrument against Castro.

Any problems on Payments to returnees can and should
be handled at WAVE.

Yo do not understand Miro's talk about @ ney invasion.
The question of the older military types to go to “academies”
has been talked about vaguely in the past (raised, 1 think,

- wheh Chamberlain), but we've never seen thin list given to

Goodwin,
The question of who contacts Miro should definitely be

resolved. I gather they (higher authorities, Tracy?) doa'e
vont Chanberlain to continue, but should we get officially
ia contact with Miro in Miaa!i Mr. Goodwin should oo direct
if desired, Howovet, they do have ‘contact through their
Comptroller, Paula, to our finance people,

Might raise problem of the 7RD within the C&C. I under
eteod Bissel thought thie internal grouping should be broken
up and the organization be a CDC. Parhaps 1f Goodwin made this
4 point it would bo done.

Imeidental Pointe
| O£ course, the primary point iseeshould there be a CRC?
We don't neod it operationally and it doesn't scea to have
“@y cupport internally. M. Tharpe'a points on this are good,
Any bead Cuban group should be Cubsn-forned, on a voluntary
basis, net U. 3. pushed, ~

Cuban delegations in Latin America, Scuetinas they do ongeahot
actions (1.0., antieCoummist book published in Mexico), They
need guidances to spend what they already get.
“a/4/Financs Just told me that WAVE called and satd that
there was $25,000 left over from lost month's adein support to
tho group. (I can only aseumo this came from Paula.) ‘Therefore,
we could have cut September Payment to £100,000. we ought es re

We have indications that the salary payments now aro
virtually welfsre payments to political followers rather than
for value received in antieCastro efforts. Can we afford to
keep these discredited leaders in pocket change?
