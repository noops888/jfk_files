FROM : David W. Belin

SUBJECT : Interview with Mr. William K. Harvey

Mr. Belin: This is an interview that I've had with

Mr. William K. Harvey, 1611 Northwood Drivel,
Indianapolis, Indiana 46240. I am going to make a transcript
of this interview which has taken place on April 10, 1975 in
Mr. Harvey's home, and I will send to Mr. Harvey for his
review a copy of the transcript for his additions or correc-
tions ‘or changes, and then what we'll do, we'll ask that the
transcript as corrected be attached in an affidavit form
for forming a part of the record of the Commission.

Mr. Harvey is a native of Indiana. He was born on Saptember
13, 1915 in Danville, Indiana. He graduated from High Schoolin
Haute. He is a graduate of the University of Indiana Law

in Washington in 1966 and he retired from the Agency in 1967
on December 31. Now, Mr. Harvey, does that summaraze basically 8
part of your background, at least that we discussed? s
H: That is correct. I would like to add one thing, if P

may, During both the Berlin and Rome periods and for a considera
period of time in Washington after I returned from Berlin I
was on the rolbs of the Foreign Service of State, which raises
a Ad question of propriety. But I want you to know that

fin the handling of this.

B: All right. I_first asked jyou with regard to any

knowledge of any assassination plans or plots withing
the Agency concerning Patrice Lumumba and you sight indicate os
what your: response was to that, Mr. Harvey. .

H: I have no personal knowledge of any such plan or
operation within or on the part of the Agency.

B: I also asked you apart from the question of Fidel

Castro whether or not you had any knowledge of «
any assassination plans or plots in the Agency that involved
any other foreign leader.

Hr Beyond the loose talk, "Would it be desirable"

oer "Wouldn't ‘it be fine if", I do not.

Br You know of no other plans except Castro. Is that
correct?

Hs No. Plans in the sense that a decision was made

to attain that objective and an actual plan ar
Operation started for that purpose, I do not.

B: All right. One of the reasons that we're here is

to discuss the question of what knowledge you had about
this whole area, and I believe you indicated that at one time
you had a conversation with someone in the Agency concerning
what that person called a request from the White House for
the Agency to develop what was called an “executive action
capability". Did you have such a conversation with anyone’
in the Agency? .

“a GIwaas FHL WOW AdODOLOHA

Hs Yes, I did.

B: And who was that?

HH: Richard Bissell.

B: An@ I believe you indicated that that took place
in either 1961 or 1962. Is that correct?

H: To the best of my recollection that particular
discussion probably took place in the latter part a
of 1961. 6

B: Do you remember what Richard Bissell -- a

K

Br Do you remember what Richard Bissell told you and

what you told him?
‘ Hs Not precisely.
B: Do you remember that he in substance said that

the White House or someone in the White House had
raised the question of whether or not the Agency should develop
what was called an "executive action capability", a capability
of assassination or liquidation of leaders of foreign countries?

Hi To the best of my recollection that was stated. .
B: Was it stated just once or perhaps on more than
one occasion?

I can only be certain as to once.

All right. But it might have been on more than
one occasion?

That's possible, but I have no real recollection
that -- the statement which is best I can recall

is that the White House has more than once raised the question
of whether we should have a capability for executive action.

To the best of my recollection I may have been told
of the operation before I was asked to‘discuss it
with Edwards and take it over. JI cannot be certain whether
there was one discussion of this-or two. I think possibly I
may have known about it before I was asked to take it over.

All right. And then after you were asked were you
briefed at all by Bissell or did you get your
initial briefing from Sheffield Edwards?

I was only briefed by Bissell that such an opera

instructed, you to talk to Sheffield Edwards who had been
involved with the operation before you-became involved. Is

you had been both jin the same PBI training class together but
that you didn't have any contact with Maheu during this period
of time to any degrees. Is that correct? :

H: The last time that I saw Maheu or talked with
Maheu or had any direct or indirect communication
with Maheu would have been about 1946, possibly 147,

the entire analysis of the plan you callea@ it among ___

other things a “damn fool idea to start with" -- I'm saying

you called it in our prior conversation today before we started

taping this interview, and you thought it had been handled in

an incredibly amateurish fashion, Is this accurate?

H: I'd like to be sure that this is precise. This

was My tentative opinion of it. a
Whether I expressed exactly those words either to Colonel
Edwards or to Bissell, I am not sure. But I may ‘very well: have

it would have been some time rather shortly after this.

By what means
/were they going to try and assassinate Cuba -- or
a Cuban leader - Castro?

I was told that there were two possibilities -
rifle fire and the use of poison.

On the rifle fire, did you participate with the
financing to enable one of theS@ Cuban exile groups

I did participate in one delivery of arms and
some related equipment.

And where did that delivery take place?

It took place in Miami.

And do you know approximately when that took place?
Might it/!have been in late '62 or early '63?

it was as late as late '62. To the best of my

All right. Did John Roselli ever “ask. any money
personally for any of the work he did on this?

No. He did not. And I am sure he knew that had
he asked, given the amount of his own personal

funds. he ha@ expended in travel expenses and so forth, that, he pr
bably could have gotten money. As a matter of fact, I believe tnat
Roselli made it a point of pride to take absolutely nothing
either in personal financial gain or to at any time then or
since to use this in an effort to secure favorable U.S.
Government consideration in any of the various problems he

may have had with the U.S. Government.

Plus or minus $5,000?
Certainly not plus, and I would think minus.

Do you remember if it included both rifles and

I believe that it did, yes.

And I believe you also told me drugs such as anti-

biotics.

Yes, there were some medicinal drugs, anti-biotics,
and so forth, which as I recall was a fairly minor

part of this.
Were the poison pills involved botulism pills?
I don't know.

They were pills which were to be used in - to
dissolve in food or something of that nature?

My understanding that they were - whether they
were pills or what they were, I don't.know, but
[to be orally administered, I believe in food or

drink, but I'm not positive.

Did you ever get a report from Roselli that the

I did receive a report from Roselli that he had

had gotten in, and that they had high hopes of success for
the operation.

The best of my recollection is I was at that
meeting with John McCone. To the best of my

xecollection the remark that he made was a clear effort to —.
stop any such proposals, suggestion or any discussion thereof*
at that meeting within that forum immediately.

Br

Earlier, before that meeting, had you had any dis-

cussiors with! Richard Helms about whether or not
McCone. should be advised of what was going on after McCone

became DCI?

He

NW 64578 Docld:32105626 Page 10

Yes, I had.



. -1o-

B: And what was the substance of your conversation
with Richard Helms?

Hi I do not recall how the question came up as to
whether the new DCI should be briefed or not. I
may have raised it. But I did recommend to Mr. Helms that
since this particular "operation" and the possible repercussions
from it all stemmed from actions which had taken place long
before either Helms or myself had had any personal connection
with it, and before John McCone had had any connection whatever
with the Agency, and since. the decision had been made at that
time that this should be sanitized, tied off and terminated

aS soon as practically feasible, I saw no reason why the new x
DCI should be briefed on it, and I strongly recommended that 8
he not be. °
3
B: Ultimately you decided that the planshad little Z
chance of success and you decided to wind down
the plans. Is that correct? 2
Hi I would object to the word "ultimately". That ;
is substantially correct if you put it within the x
time frame that I reached a tentative conclusion to that effect ™
very shortly after I was able to fully debrief Roselli and Q
assess what had gone on in the past, the people that we could fi
out’ that were involved in it who i checked out file-wise and so
as against what we then knew of the general capability of iJ
effective action within Cuba. fo]
B: And then in order to not have an explosion from a
a too-abrupt termination, you determined to z
gradually tie it down and wind it up, is that correct?
. if
H: That is correct. Remembering, Mr. Belin, that a
mo. in the initial phases of this it was quite 5
obvious that there was an explosion potential here--an explosion”

not in the technical sense ~~ a flap potential, if you will,
but it took some time to find out just what could‘be done
and how it could be done, to try to sanitize the possible
repercussions of this.

B: Any other thing that you wish to add for the
record here? "
