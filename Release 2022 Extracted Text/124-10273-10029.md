Memorandum W. Re Wannall to W. C. Sullivan
Re: OPERATIONS
LEGAL ATTACHE, SANTO DOMINGO OFFICE

In the case of DOM-12, this informant was originally
developed by the New York Office. Legal Attache suggested
the New York Office might have use of informant's services,
This information furnished to New York Office which replied
that in the absense of organized activity informant would be
of no use unless he came to New York with instructions from
Dominican communist groups to reorganize activity. This,
of course, is not a desirable situation.

OBSERVATIONS :

to turn-DOM=10 and BOM=12-over to CIA is-sound,| even though
een both of these sources are’ in a position to f sh valuable
aveilabie|to informati to us. By making these informants

=, We believe Legal Attache, Santo andy eve recommendation

available|to the Agency \we will avoid any possible duplication
or conflict, This matter should be discussed with, appropria£
officials by our Liaison Agent in order to insure {ihe Agonee
is fully aware of our current status in the Dominican Republic.
