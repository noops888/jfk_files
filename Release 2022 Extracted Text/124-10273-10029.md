This is to recommend that the Central Intelligence

Agency (CIA) be advised that we have set up a regular Legal

Attache Office in Santo Domingo in view of the President's

desire that the fbi remain 1n

Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, be authorized to turn wor

informants over to the Agency.

In accordance with the desire of the President and

recommendation of the Honorable Marvin Watson, Special

Assistart to the Fresident, that tue fol renain in tre Dominican,

Republic, the Director, on 8/2/66, advised the White House

that our

staff in Santo Domingo would be reduced to three men

and that henceforth this office will be manned in a manner

13/14

similar to that of our other Legal Attache Offices. It will not

be an operational office but rather will serve as a strategic

listening post for intelligence data and as liaison with

agencies of the Dominican Republic, as well as other agencies

of foreign governments in that country.

wIn light of this redirection of effort, we instructed

Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, to review his informant coverage.

Continuation of their services under our

current criteria would be a questionable procedure.

Memorandum N. R. Wannall to W. C. Sullivan

Re:

OPERATIONS

LIGAL ATTACHE, SANTO DOMINGO OFFICE

developed by the New York Office. Legal Attache suggested

the New York Office might have use of informant's services.

This information furnished to New York Office which replied

that in the absense of organized activity informant would be

of no use unless he came to New York with instructions from

Dominican connunist groups to reorganize activity. This,

of course, is not a desirable situation.

OBSERVATIONS:

We believe Legal Attache, Santo Domingo's recommendation

to turn-Don-to and doM-ll over to CIA is sound, even though

both of these sources are in a position to furnish valuable

intelligence information to us.

By making these informants

available to the Agency we will avoid any possible duplication

or conflict. This matter should be discussed with, appropriate

oIticials by our Liaison Agent in order to insure the Agency.
