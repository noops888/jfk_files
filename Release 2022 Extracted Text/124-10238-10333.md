"walk-ins" as well as recruitment of double agent:

Discussion concerning Leat's role

and functions in Brasilia appeared to be routine; with ICw,

overseas. The subject of two paid confidential sources in

Brasilia was briefly discussed and both SSC investigators

lack of cooperation and coordination with FBI and the
