manufacturer would probably bring a representative to
Pittsburgh to service the system which he understands
originally cost $30,000.

The afore-mentioned informant advised that the North Star
Cement Block Company has recently consideréd constructing
a bomb: Shelter at the LA ROCCA residence as a sales pro-
motion stunt and experiment. He said that if it is well
received, the construction of bomb shelters for Pittsburgh
residents will be advertised in Pittsburgh newspapers

So that business may ultimately be increased at North Star.

Possible Transaction Involving LA ROCCA--

GENOVESE Organization and Howard Johnson
Restauran ain

ARTHUR D, NELSON, aka, ARCHIE, who fronts the Phoenix and
Toll Gate Motels at Monroeville, Pa., for the LA ROCCA.-
GENOVESE organization, has advised that he hopes to close a
deal with the Howard Johnson Restaurant Chain which will
build him a motor lodge at the location of his Toll Gate
Motel in Monroeville within the next year. He advised that
this means a great deal to him inasmuch as a Howard Johnson
franchise is difficult to obtain and means clear sailing
financially for many years, .

SA ROBERT MADDEN, Intelligence Unit, IRS, Pittsburgh
has advised that

LOWERY BELL, Chief Architect for the Howard Johnson Restaurant
Chain whose offices are located in Miami, Florida, visited
Pittsburgh on August 3, 1961, and advised SA ROBERT A, VOEGE
that a motor lodge at the Toll Gate Motel site in Monroeville
is definitely in the planning stage and that an investigation
of ARTHUR D, NELSON, aka, ARCHIE, is presently being con-
ducted. He stated that investigators have found nothing

thus far to indicate that NELSON has any criminal associations

_but that if this became known he believes the franchise

would definitely be withdrawn and that no further considera-
tion would be given to this project.
