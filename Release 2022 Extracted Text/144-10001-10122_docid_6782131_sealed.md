_ As announced at the beginning of this week, the! report
of the commission headed by the Chief Justice of the: Supreme
Court, which investigated the assassination of President
KENNEDY, was handed to President JOHNSON yesterday, :: » The
report is very lengthy, but is to be printed .for wide distribu-
tion, according to the desire of President JOHNSON that thece
be no doubts in regard to the circumstances and motivation
of that crime, .

.

Sunday afternoon, the day after: Heo erow: the report
will be made public, which will make’ ‘possible its transcription

in the morning press on Monday, . :

The ceremony of handing the report to President JOHNSON
was attended by all members ofthe commission appointed by
him, which became known as th WARREN Commission ané which
was made up of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Senacor
RICHARD RUSSELL and JOHN ‘SHERMAN COOPER, Congressman HALE

BOGGS and GERALD FORD liad our Mr, JOHN, J. MCCLOY and be ALLEN

DULLES, ’ .

It appears thatthe conclusion of the WARREN Comuission

is that LEE OSWALD-was the sole author of the crime and that

his motive was strictly personal, In regard to the zssassination
of OSWALD, the Commission appears to have accepted the thesis
that JACK RUBY’also acted on strictly personal motivation both
evidently having suffered from mental unbalance or instability.
