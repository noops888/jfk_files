WARREN COMMISSION FINDINGS SUMMARIZED.

:25 Sep: 64

Msg Nr: 1614

44 USC 2107(5)(g)(2)(D)(i)

As announced

at the beginning of this week, the

report

of the commission headed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme

Court, which investigated the assassination of President

KENNEDY, was handed to President JOHNSON yesterday. • The

report is very lengthy, but is to be printed.for wide distribu-

tion, according to the desire of President JOHNSON that there

be no doubts in regard to the circumstances and notivation

of that crime.

Sunday afternoon, the day after tomorrow, the report

will be made public, which will make' possible its transcription

in the morning press on Monday.

The ceremony of handing the report to President JOHNSON

was attended by all members of the commission appointed by

him, which became known as the WARREN Commission and which

was made up of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court,

Senscor

RICHARD RUSSELL and JOHN SHERMAN COOPER, Congressman; HALE

BOGGS and GERALD FORD and

•our ME. JOHN, J.. MCCLOY and ME. ALLEN

DULLES.

It appears that the conclusion of the WARREN Comission

is that LEE OSWALD, was the sole author of the crime and that

his motive was strictly personal. In regard to the assassination

of OSWALD, the Commission appears to have accepted the thesia

that JACK RUBY.*

also acted on strictly personal motivation both

evidently having suffered from mental unbalance or instability.
