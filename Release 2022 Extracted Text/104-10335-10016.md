NOTE FOR: The File Pepice ge

SUBJECT: JFK Board Requests 2000

On 5 June I called David Marwell to clarify parts of
the Board's first three requests (CIA-1, 2, and 3). The
following points were made:

- Marwell will arrange to have a Board staffer screen
the package of several hundred items provided by the
DA in response to request No. 1 The items consist
largely of HNs and HRs that describe organizations
and appointments. This would preclude the need to
send the entire package to the Board.

- Regarding requests No. 2 and 3, the reason that the
Board has asked us to provide information as to the
the present whereabouts of individuals is to help
the Board determine which names should be released.
For example, the Board may conclude that the name of
‘someone who retired overtly and is living in: the US
could be released, as opposed to someone who retired
under cover and lives abroad.

- If the Board wants to interview someone; a specific
request will be sent to us.

- The background information that we provide on
individuals and crypts listed in the requests is
not considered part of the “assassination record.”
The information is used to assist the Board in its
review of documents.

- On 7 June the Board will hold a “formal” meeting
to review redactions we have recommended.

Re: _ Status of Assassination Records Review Board Requests to CIA for
Additional Information and Records

Dear Barry:
Iam writing to memorialize our conversation of October 1 regarding the status of
Assassination Records Review Board requests for information and records from the
CIA. :
We discussed the following formal requests:
CIA-1 (Organization materials)
CIA has made records available to the Review Board. The Review Board
staff will continue its review and make recommendations to the Board
and will request further information, if necessary, from CIA. CIA needs to
do nothing further at this time.
CIA-2-5 Complete -
CIA-6 (Cables and dispatches)
CIA originally informed the Review Board staff that these materials could
be made available by December, 1995. CIA now agrees to make the
records available (or to have a response) by the first of November, 1996.
CIA-7 (Histories)

Mexico City. CIA has shown the Mexico City history to Gunn. CIA will
compile the portion of the history that was shown to G. Robert Blakey,

which will be processed as an assassination record. Gunn will then
determine whether there are any additional portions of the history that
should be added to the Blakey version. CIA will compile the “Blakey
version” as soon as possible and Gunn will promptly thereafter review the
documents.

Index. CIA has made an index available to Review Board staff and the
staff has identified certain histories that may be appropriate for review.
CIA will make available those histories that are of obvious relevance, and
will raise with Review Board staff any questions regarding the requests
where the basis for the request is unclear. CIA will begin to make
histories available on a rolling basis. Review Board has agreed to review
histories promptly once they are made available. Although it was not
discussed at our meeting, we would very much appreciate it if you would,
within the next two weeks, identify which histories you are prepared to
make available and those that CIA believes should be subject to further
discussions.
Cram’s multi-volume counterintelligence history. Although Cram’s
history was not specifically discussed at our meeting, the Review Board
staff understands that the history has been located and the Review Board
staff awaits its being made available.
CIA-8 (Intelligence community staff) =
CIA will provide a report to the Review Board staff within two weeks.
CIA-9 (Publications and analytical materials)
The Review Board staff provided CIA with a list of certain publications as

they appear in an LBJ Library finding aid. CLA will report back on
Tecommended action to the Review Board promptly.

CIA-10 (Interagency source register)

CIA has compiled information responsive to the request. CIA will make
records available within two weeks.

CIA-11 (Duran’s original statement)

CIA has been unable to identify to date Duran’s original statement. CIA
will make some further attempts to locate it.
CIA-12 (MWAVE materials)
CIA will begin to make materials available on a rolling basis.
‘With respect to the informal requests, it is our understanding that:

CIA is inquiring into matters related to Spas Raikin. The Review Board staff will
discuss issues with CIA once the pending research is completed.

CIA is locating a cable number IN 24738 (7 July 62), which is identified in record
number 1993.07.20.10.18:29:650630 (Box 34, F 22), p. 2.

CIA is inquiring into matters related to Marilyn D. Murrett. The Review Board
staff will discuss issues with CIA once the pending research is completed.

CIA is continuing to search for HTLINGUAL records, particularly those
identified in Church Committee index that was provided to CIA by Review
Board staff. CIA is prepared to provide oral briefing on HTLINGUAL.

Please let me know if you have any supplements or corrections. We would very much
like to ensure that these matters are handled expeditiously. .

As always, thanks for your cooperation and assistance.

Re: erate of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board’ ‘s Compliance

Dear Barry:

Iam writing to memorialize the Review Board’s understanding of the status of CLA’s
responses to our formal and informal requests for additional information and records
that have been requested pursuant to the Review Boards authority under Section
7(j)(1)(C)(ii)of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of
1992, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V 1994) (JFK Act). i

It is important that everyone at the Agency who is responsible for providing answers to
our requests for additional information and records understand that the answers will
need to be incorporated by reference into the Agency's Final Compliance Statement.
Essentially, CIA will need to attest, under oath, that it has made all reasonable and
diligent searches and that its answers are true and correct to the extent of the best,
reasonably available information. In this regard, is important to note that when the
Review Board requests, for example, a 201 file, it is not asking that you identify relevant
records within the Sequestered Collection. Rather, it is asking to review the original
201 file in its current and most complete version?

‘The Review Board has no basis for assuming that.a 201 file as it appears in the
Sequestered Collection today is necessarily complete. It is fully possible that a relevant
document was not identified by CIA or the HSCA in 1978-79 and therefore is not
included in the Sequestered Collection, or that a relevant document that was initially
placed in the Sequestered Collection in 1978-79 may have been misplaced at some point
during the subsequent twenty years. Therefore, in response to requests for files, it is
not sufficient merely to point to places where responsive records appear in the
Collection. On a case-by-case basis, we are very willing to hear your explanations for
the possible burdensomeness of any particular search or your analysis of why a search

As we have written in our formal requests and as we have said to you orally, you
should interpret our requests in the broadest reasonable sense. However, to the extent
that you believe that a request poses an unreasonable burden that we may not have
anticipated, or to the extent that you have suggestions to modify or to amend our

* requests in such a way as to better reach our goals, you should not hesitate to make

suggestions or seek clarification. However, unless we specifically hear from you to the
contrary, it is our presumption that CIA will respond fully to the requests as posed.

In response to your request, the ARRB staff has now identified six of our outstanding ~
requests as high priority issues. We would appreciate your forwarding to us as much
responsive material as you are reasonably able to assemble during the upcoming two
weeks with regard to these six issues. We wish to obtain a reasonably complete
response to these requests within one month. These six issues are identified in the text
by double asterisks (**).?

The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts involving first, the formal requests
for information and records, and second, the informal requests for information and

records. Please let me know if your understanding of any of the following points
differs from ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies *

I. Formal Requests.

CIA-1 Organizational Material.

CIA has collected information responsive to this request for Review Board
action. The ARRB staff has identified records that it believes will enhance the

(Oswald Pre-assassination files); personnel assigned to a designated post;
QKENCHANT; the electronic take from the Mexico City Station; and files on George
Stanley Brown. :

®This memorialization follows-up, in large part, on your conversations of March
19 and 20, 1997 with Michelle Combs and on the DO and DS&T briefings to the ARRB
staff on April 1, 1997.

historical understanding of the assassination by providing some background on
CIA records.

CIA should now review the DO and DS&T organizational material and
te-examine some of the proposed redactions. Several documents have been
cleared by the directorate IRO‘s for either release in full or release with minor
redactions.‘ The ARRB staff will consult with CLA to determine whether these
records should be designated “assassination records” or whether they could be
made available publicly in a manner similar to the material from the 1996 Boston
trip. HRG would like to discuss this issue before the materials are formally put
before the Review Board.

CIA-6 Cables and Dispatches.

The Review Board first made this request on September 11, 1995. On September
11, 1995, CIA agreed to make these materials available by December, 1995. On
October 1, 1996, CIA agreed to make these materials available by November,
1996.

We are aware that many of the cables requested are already in the JFK files, but
not all are included. Those that we have not been able to locate in the collection
include: Mexico City Station to Headquarters (September 26-30, 1963);
Headquarters to Mexico City Station (September 26-30, 1963); JMWAVE to
Headquarters (September 26-November 21, 1963);Headquarters to JMWAVE

Station and JMWAVE for the periods September 26-October 20, 1963 and
November 22-December 30, 1963.

"“CIA-7 Histories.

The Review Board first requested access to several internal CIA histories and to
indices of histories on November 8; 1995. On August 8, 1996, after reviewing a
list of histories that you provided, the ARRB staff designated approximately
sixty histories for which further review was sought. To date, the ARRB staff has
reviewed the seven histories that CLA has made available and has made
suggestions with respect to further processing of those seven histories. CIA
should make the remaining sixty-plus histories available.

provided suggestions .as to how this information could be obtained, including
suggesting the types of files and cables that could be searched.

The cable was delivered to the Review Board on March 20, 1997. No further
action by CIA is needed.

CIA should undertake a computer run for all HTLINGUAL documents. All
computer searches for these documents should be documented in a formal letter
for the record.

CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton’s files. -

The Review Board seeks to ensure that it has taken all reasonable stepsto
account for any files that James Jesus Angleton possessed or controlled that
related to the assassination and to Lee Harvey Oswald. Because of the perceived
controversy surrounding the disposition of Angleton’s files, the Review Board
believes it prudent to obtain a clear understanding of the types of files that he
maintained and their ultimate disposition. (The Review Board does not seek to
explore any subjects in Angleton’s files beyond those that may have pertained to
the assassination.) To date, CIA has made available certain documents provided
by the CIC and the case files for Mangold v. CIA. The Review Board requests any
additional information in the possession of CIA that would explain the
disposition of Angleton’s files.

‘The ARRB staff has spoken with a retired CIA official who claims to be able to

answer this question from memory, but who refused to do so.

Re: Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board’s Requests for
Additional Information and Records

Dear John:

Iam writing to follow-up on our telephone call earlier today and to convey my serious
concern about the status of CIA’s responses to the Review Board's requests for
additional information and records. Although CIA has completed its responses to
several requests, and many others have been answered in part, a significant number of
requests have not been answered — including some that were made more than two
years ago. On many occasions we have been assured that responses would be
forthcoming, only to have promised dates come and go without answers. It is now
extremely important that these requests be answered promptly so that we may conduct
a proper follow-up if necessary. The issues that we can now identify as being of the
highest priority are identified in the text below by double asterisks (**)' and we request
that they be answered within the next month. We request that the remaining requests
be answered by April 1, 1998.

The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts: first, a listing of the formal
requests for information and records, and second, a listing of the informal requests for.
information and records. Please let me know if your understanding of any of the
following points differs from ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies.

"As identified more fully below, the issues are: CLA-1 Organizational Material,
CIA-6 Cables and Dispatches, CIA-13 Backchannel Communications, CIA-IR-03
HTLINGUAL Documents, CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton Files, CLA-IR-07 Claude
Barnes Capehart, CIA-IR-15 Electronic “take” from Mexico City, CLA-IR-21 DRE

The ARRB staff is willing to consult with CIA as soon as the records are ready to
determine whether they should be designated “assassination records” or
whether they can be made available publicly in a manner similar to the material
from the 1996 Boston trip. CIA should be aware, however, that these materials

November 1996. Most recently, CIA has stated that these cables are not available
as a chronological group; if it is not possible or is unduly burdensome to retrieve
these cables, CIA should write a memorandum to that effect.

We are aware that many of the cables requested are already in the JFK files, but
not all are included. Those that we have not been able to locate in the collection
include: Mexico City Station to Headquarters (September 26-30, 1963); .
Headquarters to Mexico City Station (September 26-30, 1963); JMWAVE to
Headquarters (September 26-November 21, 1963); Headquarters to JMWAVE

Station and JMWAVE for the periods September 26-October 20, 1963 and
November 22-December 30, 1963.

CIA-7 Histories. : -

The Review Board first requested access to several internal CIA histories and to
indices of histories on November 8, 1995. On August 8, 1996, after reviewing a
list of histories that CIA provided, the ARRB staff designated approxitnately
sixty histories for which further review was sought. To date, the ARRB staff has
reviewed twelve histories that CIA has made available and has made
suggestions with respect to further processing of some of those histories. The
ARRB staff appreciates the cooperation it has received from HRG in our review
of the histories. CLA should continue to make the remaining histories available
ona continuing basis in consultation with the ARRB.

A°CIAIR-21 Monthly Operatiorial Reports forDRE.  C*'y WW

In March 1997, the Review Board requested that the CIA search for monthly
operational reports for the Cuban exile group Directorio Revolucionario
Estudiantil (DRE) records for the period 1960-1964 with particular emphasis on
the reports for August and November 1963. While some of the reports for this
period already exist in the JFK Collection, others, including the reports for ‘
December 1962-April 1964, are missing. We understand that the CIA has done
some research on the missing reports. We request a comprehensi¥e memo on the
creation and disposition of DRE records be provided for the Board. In addition,
we request that the CIA work to discover the identity of “Howard,” the CIA

officer mentioned in the DRE files. We request his full name and Office of
Personnel file be provided to the Board.

Dear John: . ..
“Iam writing to update the Review Board’s understanding of the status of CIA’s

to our formal and informal requests for additional information and records
that have been requested pursuant to the Review Board’s authority under Section
7()(1)(C)(ii)of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of
1992, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V 1994) (JFK Act). : :

‘As we have written in our formal requests and as we have said to you orally, you
should interpret our requests in the broadest reasonable sense. However, to the extent

_ that you believe that a request poses an urireasonable burden that we may-not have

anticipated, or to the extent that you have suggestions to modify or to amend our
fequests in'such a way as to better reach our goals, you should not hesitate to make
suggestions or seek clarification. However, unless we specifically hear from you to the
contrary, it is our presumption that the CIA:will xespond fully to the requests as posed.

Many of these requests have been outstanding for over a year and several for two years.

It should be noted that these requests will be incorporated into the Agency’s final
compliance declaration. In requesting these materials, we are not designating them
“assassination records” at this time and we are not requesting that copies be given to

In response to your request, the ARRB staff has identified an additional eight of our
outstanding requests as high priority issues. We would appreciate your forwarding to
us as much responsive material as you are reasonably able to assemble during the
upcoming month with regard to these issues. We wish to obtain a reasonably complete
response to these requests within one month: These issues are identified in the text by

and also continue to be identified by double asterisks. Plese note that all ARRB requests
for additional information, both formal and informal, are scheduled to be completed by
April 1, 1998.

. The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts involving first, the formal requests
for information and records, and second, the informal requests for information and

records. Please let me know if your understanding of any of the following points
differs from ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies.

Formal Requests

“*CIA-1 Organizational Material.

records, HRP has provided ARRB with the records identified by the ARRB staff
which have been cleared by the directorate IRO’s for either release in full or with

best means of making these documents publicly available. Additional

staff is reviewing these histories on a constant basis and continues to make
suggestions with respect to further processing of some of those histories. The
ARRB staff appreciates the cooperation it has received from HRP in our review
of the histories. CIA should continue to make the remaining histories available
in consultation with the ARRB.

" “CIA-8 Intelligence Community Staff Records.

The Review Board first requested information on the Intelligence Community
Staff on March 1, 1996. On October 1, 1996, CIA agreed to report on the status of
this request within two.weeks. While we understand that this request turned out
to be more difficult and complicated than originally envisioned, the Review
Board has not yet received any substantive response. .

CIA-9 Intelligence Community Publications on Cuba or USSR (November 20-30, 1963).

The LBJ Library has identified several publications for mandatory review? The
DI has provided additional documents which were requested. Michelle Combs
reviewed the materials and identified some that should be made available to the
public. These records should be marked for processing as soon as possible.

CIA has submitted a classified description of the ISR as a formal response to the
Review Board's request: As a follow up, ARRB has requested that CIA check a
‘provided list of names against the Interagency Source Register. Several files of

allegedly connected to JMWAVE. In response to this request, CIA has provided
numerous records which were located in the Sequestered Collection. Since that

entities are incomplete. All computer searches for these documents should be

““CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton’s Files.

The Review Board seeks to ensure that it has taken all reasonable steps to
account for any files that James Jesus Angleton possessed or controlled that
related to the assassination and to Lee Harvey Oswald. Because of the perceived
controversy surrounding the disposition of Angleton’s files, the Review Board
believes it prudent to obtain a clear understanding of the types of files that he
maintained and their ultimate disposition. (The Review Board does not seek to
explore any subjects in Angleton’s files beyond those that may have pertained to
the assassination.) To date, CIA has made available certain documents provided
by the CIC and the case files for Mangold v. CIA. The Review Board requests any
additiqnal information in the possession of CLA that would explain the

disposition of Angleton’s files. —

In addition, the ARRB staff's review of the Mangold v. CIA files designated
additional documents from those files as assassination records. These documents
ate: Tab D, documents Nos. 95, 109-116, 120, and 121; and from the Denied
Documents file: documents Nos. 496, 498, 499, 500, and 510. ARRB has now
received confirmation that these documents are either already in the Sequestered
Collection or have been marked for processing.

November 29, 1963, prepared under the name of John Edgar Hoover, which
states: “The substance of the foregoing information [on the assassination of

to whom the memorandum refers and should provide a definitive statement

Re: Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board's Requests for
Additional Information and Records

Dear Barry:

Iam writing to update the Review Board's understanding of the status of CIA’s
responses to our formal and informal requests for additional information and records
that have been requested pursuant to the Review Board's authority under Section
7(j)(1)(C)(ii)of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of
1992, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V 1994) (JFK Act).

We appreciate recent CIA efforts to respond to our outstanding requests. As we have
written in our formal requests and as we have said to you orally, you should interpret
our requests in the broadest reasonable sense. To the extent that you believe that a
request poses an unreasonable burden that we may not have anticipated, or to the
extent that you have suggestions to modify or to amend our requests in such a way as
to better reach our goals, you should not hesitate to make suggestions or seek
clarification. As has been noted in earlier letters, these requests will be incorporated.
into the Agency’s final compliance declaration. In requesting these materials, we are
not designating them “assassination records” at this time and we are not requesting that
copies be given to the Review Board. All outstanding ARRB requests for additional
information, both formal and informal, are scheduled to be completed by April 1, 1998.
As noted in your meeting with Michelle Combs on February 27, 1998, we recognize that
some requests, such as CIA-7, are ongoing and will continue. In addition, the ARRB has
formulated some new requests, CIA-IR-34 and IR-35, which should be completed as
quickly as possible.

The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts involving first, the formal requests
for information and records, and second, the informal requests for information and
records.

whether there was any surveillance take in addition to what is currently in the
collection.

On March 18, 1997, the Review Board provided additional leads to CIA to assist
it in answering these questions. The DO has agreed to check Headquarters
records for the file referenced in HMMW 12454, to search for the crypts cited in
this document, and to search for HMMA 20307 and other cables or dispatches
cited in this document.

Re: Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board’s Requests for
Additional Information and Records

Dear Barry:

Iam writing to update you on the Review Board’s understanding of the status of CLA’s
responses to our formal and informal requests for additional information and records
that the ARRB Staff has requested pursuant to Section 7(j)(1)(C)(ii) of the President John
F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V
1994) (JFK Act).

We appreciate recent CIA efforts to respond to our outstanding requests. As we have
noted in earlier letters, these requests will be incorporated into the Agency’s final
compliance declaration. As you know, in requesting these materials, we are not
designating them “assassination records” at this time and we are not requesting that
CIA provide copies to the Review Board. As we have noted, all outstanding ARRB
requests for additional information, both formal and informal, were scheduled to be
completed by April 1, 1998. Although the April 1 deadline has passed, the Review
Board still intends to complete all necessary work on the outstanding requests as soon
as possible. The Review Board is currently in the process of drafting its final report to
the President and to Congress and it considers the issue of CIA requests for additional
information and records a crucial one. At a meeting with the Review Board staff on
July 16, 1998, the CLA made a commitment to complete all but three of the outstanding
requests, formal and informal, by August 1, 1998. Due to Review Board staff
commitments, we are willing to extend that deadline to no later than Friday August 7,
1998.
