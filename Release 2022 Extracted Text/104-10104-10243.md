MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Alleged CIA Involvement with Oswald

sl. Me Yesterday evening Mr. Clarence Martin, an acquaintance of
mine in A.1.D. (where he handles Congressional Liaison) dropped off
the attached letter and clipping from the New Orleans States—Item at
my house while I was out.

- 2. Martin is from New Orleans and has on past occasions voiced
2 healthy contempt for Garrison and his shenanigans. This feeling was
undoubtedly chared by his legal friend who, judging by this letter, now
appears to have second thoughts.

Dear Clarence:

I am enclosing headline copyright story
wnich appeared in the afternoon States. I have
absolutely no inside information as I have not
even talked with George W. Healy, Jr., or anybody

else with the paper abcut the Kennedy Assassination

probe in a number of weexa. However, I know how
superconservative the paper is and I think it is
extremely significant that the powers that be. are
willing to go this far. From original skepiicism,
many peopie around town are beginning te think Jim
mig.it have something. In any event, I don't believe

the C.I.A. can play ostrich much longer.

Sincerely,

Charles E, Dunbar, III
