Dear Clarence:

I am enclosing headline copyright story

wnich appeared in the afternoon States. I have

absolutely no inside information as I have not

even talked with George W. Healy, Jr., or anybody

else with the paper about the Kennedy Assassination

probe in a number of weeks. However, I know how

superconservative the paper 1s and I think 1t 13

extremely significant that the powers that be. are

w1lling to go this far. From original skepulsism,

many jeople around town are beginning to think J1n

mid.it

have

something. In any event, I don't believe

the c.i

•A. can play ostrich much longer.
