MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:

SUBJECI: Alpha 66 Frogmen

2 November 1962

1. (C, Undersigned called Capt Hubbard at 1100 hours, 1 Nov to inform

him locationof frogmen mentioned in our DA 921003 was of priority importance.

Hubbard had received ref cable & hour before and had made appointment to see

Veciana that evening.

He was told to try and move this appointment up, make

any contacts he was able, including Coast Guard, INS and FBI and give us a

progress report by phone

before 1500 that day.

Concerning the weapons he

reported that they were sitting in Maj Daniel's office.

No SSD courier had

left PR this week,

but they would go with the first one. He did not know

when this might be.

I told him we

had made arrangements with the SSD people

to pick up the material, and since we would not have to meet it at the airpott,

it was not necessary he call us when it left, merely send us a cable, with

details.

2. TOx Hubbard called at 1500 hours, 1 Nov. He said he had just

finished talking with Veciana. Veciana identifies the two men as

Julio CRUZ and FNU CASTILLO.

He says they are located on an island oubside

the U.S. l½ days by boat from Miami.

Veciana said Hubbard and two other

men could interview the men at their present location if they went blindfolded

and by boat. He refused to bring them to the U.S.; he wants Hubbard to go

too (as well as himself); he says planes cannot be used; he insists on the

blinfolds.

Hubbard says he believes these are the men we are looking for..

He hassladk (Hubbard) has talked with other people (unidentified) which tends

to confirm this.

Hubbard said Veciana identified them as members of the

2nd Front of the Escambray.

Hubbard had another meeting with him at 1930

hours (local). He was told to remain at the telephone and we would call back.

before 1930.

3. (8) Information was passed to It Col Daugherty, who contacted

Navy. First reaction from them was that they would have no decision as to

whether to proceed until this date.

Therefore I recontacted Hubbard informing

him of this and he agreed to string Veciana along until today We discussed

possible renumeration and Hubbard suggested that one way we could assist was

by getting the boat released that had been picked up by INS in Miami about

30 October which belongs to the group, together with a quantity of arms and

ammunition, which they also confiscated.

4. TOX At 1700 It Col Daugherty called to say the Navy had agreed to

the debriefing on their conditions.

"They will furnish one man. The matter

of transportation to the island is open.

Veciana said he would furnish it

given two ot three days. A tentatie arrival date on the island was set

for late 5 November. Hubbard was recontacted by

undersigned at 1800 and

informed of this prior to his meeting.

Hubbard agreed to leave the

transportation issue open for the moment, to discuss the timing and route

of travel. I promised to call Hubbard with further details this date.

5. 0 Undersigned talked with It Cmdr Hamilton at 1100 hours this

In that, a subsequent conversation with hubbard and with Maj Watlington

most of the details were completed for the trip.

Hamilton was to secure

a Coast Guard or Navy boat, Hubbard abd Veciana were to proceed to Miami

on Saturday and thence to Key West

would meet

Stein was to accompany them as translator.

However, about 1200 hours, Hamilton called to say that his

superior, Admiral Griffin, Chief of Fleet Operations and Readiness had

stated none of his men or equipment would be used to go to this location.

Upon informing It Col Daugherty, he informed General Lansdale's office

of the fact that we were contenplating this action, Navy's reaction and

asking whether they had any interest or guidance.

At 1430 General

Lansdale's office replied that no operations of this type would be conducted.

The only conditions under whidU.S. military personnel could meet these

persons was if they came on U.S. territory. This apparently was a high

policy decision.

Accordingly, at 1500 undersigned called Hubbard informing

him of this

fact.

He did

not express much hope for getting them to come

to U.S.

territory, but said he would try. I suggested that he might

still reimburse Veciana for his Miami trip, since Veciana wanted to be

in Miami for a special Catholic Holy Day mass in connection with the

Cuban refugee movement.

Hubbard stated that Veciana had bought his own

ticket.

Called Stein

and informed him of situation and called Hamilton

to reaffirm the decision.

Hamilton noted that they would still be interested

in information even as to whether the force the frogmen encountered was

an attraction or repulsion.
