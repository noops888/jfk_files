MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD: 2 November 1962

SUBJECT: Alpha 66 Frogment{

1. Undersigned called Capt Hybbard at 1100 hours, 1 Nov to inform
him locaticnof frogmen mentioned in our DA 921003 was of priority importancee
Hubbard had received ref cable + @ hour before and had made appointment to see
Veciana that evening. He was told to try and move this appointment up, make
any contacts he was able, including Coast Guard, INS and FBI and give us a
progpess report by phone before 1500 that day, Concerning the weapons he
reported that they were sitting in Maj Daniel's office. No SSD courier had
left PR this week, but they would go with the first one. He did not know
when this might be. I told him we had made arrangements with the SSD people
to pick up the material, and since we would not have to meet it at the airpobt,
it was not necessary he call us when it left, merely send us a cable, with
details.

2. TH Hubbard called at 1500 hours, 1 Nov. He said he had just
finished talking with Veciana. Veciana identifies the two men as
Julio CRUZ and FNU CASTILLO. He says they are located on an island oubside
the U.S. 1# days by boat from Miami, Veciana said Hubbard and two other
men could interview the men at their present location if they went blindfolded
and by boat. He refused’ to bring them to the U.S.; he wants Hubbard to go
too (as wéll as himself); he says planes cannot be used; he insists on the
blinfolds. Hubbard says he believes these are the men we are looking for.

He basxkaikk (Hubbard) has talked with other people (unidentified) which tends
to confirm this. Hubbard said Veciana identified them as members of the

2nd Front of the Escambray. Hubbard had another meeting with him at 1930
hours (local). He was told to remain at the telephone and we would call back.
before 1930. .

3. 6) Information was passed to Lt Col Daugherty, who contacted
Navy. First reaction from them was that they would have no decision as to
whether to proceed until this date. Therefore I recontacted Hubbard informing
him of this and he agreed to string Veciana along until today. We discussed
possible renumeration and Hubbard suggested that one way we could assist was
by getting the boat released that had’ been picked up by INS in Miami about
30 October which belangs to the group, together with a quantity of arms and
ammunition, which they also confiscated. EXCLUDED FROM GENERAL 4

4. C6). At 1700 Lt Col Daugherty ‘called to a AS YEN haa Nereod. ae
the debriefing on their conditions. They will furnish one man. The ae
of transportation to the island is open. Veciana said he would furnish it
given two ob three days. A tentatiie arrival date on the island was set
for late 5 November, Hubbard was recontacted by undersigned at 1800 and
informed of this prior to his meeting. Hubbard agreed to leave the
transportation issue open for the moment, to discuss the timing and route
of. travel. I promised to call Hubbard with further details this date.

5. (CG) Unfiersigned talked with Lt Cmdr Hamilton at 1100 hours this
date. In that, a subsequent conversation with Hubbard and with Maj Watlington
most of the details were completed for the trip. Hamilton was to secure
a Coast Guard or Navy boat, Hul
on Saturday and thence to Key |

Stein was to accompany them as translator.

6. ® However, about 1200 hours, Hamilton called to say that his
superipr, Admiral Griffin, Chief of Fleet Operations and Readiness had
stated none of his men or equipment would be used to go to this location.
Upon informing It Col Daugherty, he informed General Lansdale's office
of the fact that we were conteyplabing this action, Navy's reaction and
asking whether they had any interest or guidance. At 130 General
Lansdale's office replied that no operations of this type would be conducted.
The only conditions under whim U.S. military personnel could meet these
pérsons was if they came on U.S. territory. This apparently was a high
policy decision.

7. (@) Accordingly, at 1500 undersigned called Hubbard informing
him of this fact. He did not express mch hope for getting them to came
to U.S. terrbtory, but said he would try. I suggested that he might
still reimburse Veciana for his Miami trip, since Véciana wanted to be
in Miami for a special Catholic Holy Day mass in connection with the
Cuban refugee movement. Hubbard stated that Veciana had bought his own
ticket. Called Stein aid informed him of situafion and called Hamilton
to reaffirm the decision. Hamilton noted that they would still be interested
in information even as to whether the force the frogmen encountered was
an atbraction or repulsion.
