recruiting him for an intelligence assignment in Cuba. O'Neal stated

that such action is being withheld until the Bureau completed its

investigation

and

the contact would be made only if there were not

any Bureau objection.

With regard

to. the names? address and phone number in

possession of subject, Simmonse dvised that he has no explanation

for this but suggested the possibility that Valdes coula have

obtained such information from other Cuban exiles. Simmons does

not feel that the possession of such information means that he is

being used in a CLA operation SimmonS also added that personnel

of the Frente Revolucionario Democratico may have had contact with

Valdes and have not reported the matter to any CIA representative,

ACTION:
