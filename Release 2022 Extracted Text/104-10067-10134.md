Dear Bob:

Herewith are comments on the draft paper on "Evolution and
Implications of the CIA-Sponsored Assassination Conspiracies
Against Castro."

First, it is noted that no footnotes are attached, so we are
unable to comment on the kind of modifications that have been
required for security reasons in earlier instances.

Next, as we are nearing the end of this phase of things, it ~~
is noted that we have seen no graphics, and therefore assume that _
there will be none of interest or relevance to CIA. ~ -

As a preliminary observation — to avoid the endless listing of ee :
instances of recurring citation in the draft — the names of H
James O'Connell, Tony Varona, and Juan Orta, should be deleted or i
replaced wherever they occur. Substitutes will be suggested where i
they first appear. Cubela, of course, should be referred to as

Page 1. First paragraph. I would like to raise a personal
question on the presentation in this paragraph. ‘These are my i
views, to you; not necessarily shared by my colleagues. ‘There . |
is as much, if not more, simplistic rhetoric here as there is :
mature moral principle, and you may wish to modify the language.

First, it is not’ clear whether the draft states categorical

opposition to all assassinations, whatever and wherever, or whether

it is directed only to those considered by CIA — however
ineffective the plans.

Hurder is reprehensible, and contrary to the principles of
civilized society (although lawyers make a variety of technical
distinctions between different kinds of homicide). However,
western culture has a parellel, if necessarily subordinate, line
of philosophy on the subject of tyrannicide. Writings of church
philosophers, as well as other reputable thinkers, recognize the i
principle, given special considerations. ‘hese writers fail to ao



14-00000

provide a set of standards or rules for how the principle is to
be applied should the question present itself. ‘This uncertainty |
adds to the complexity of the question, introducing subjective
tests of perception and degree, aspects of life that make life
uncomfortable already for those tidy minds that feel conpelled to-_
deal with everything in blacks and whites. :

Let we pose the problem thus, Had anyone foreseen the extremes
of Hitler, a truly demonic man, would there have been a basis for
seriously considering his assassination? Had he been murdered, at
least six million Jews would have survived, not to mention the many:
millions more who died as a result of the war. "ho can confidently
balance. the scales on that question, between the rights of humanity,
in the larger sense, and the life of Hitler? I recall the reports of
an attempt on Hitler's life during World War II, and the general.
approbation of American society for the heroes that tried and failed.
It really isn't all that simple, at least not as stated in your draft
introduction.

Obviously it is too complex a subject for a full and considered
@iscussion here, and my comment is intended only to suggest that
you may wish to review the presentation on how the Committee finally
speaks on this. :

I personally happen to feel that the perceived desirability of
giving the Cuban people a more enlightened government — shared by -
the overvhelming majority of Americans at the time — was unlikely
to have been served by Castro's death. Quite frankly, I have
similar doubts on the others considered ‘as possible targets for
elimination in the 1950s and 1960s. And that is why I asked my first
question about whether your draft categorically includes all political
assassinations, regardless of whatever and vherever, or if it is
directed at those considered during the late 1950s and early 1960s.
My point is that the HSCA draft is subject to improvement on this
point.

aye 24. Second paragraph, ninth line. - Substitute TFR for CIA.

The HSCA draft is imprecise in this treatment. ‘he task Force
report gave a rather detailed recitation of what AMLASH was told as the
basis for its view. While Book V of the SSC reported AMLASH's reaction as
uncertain, the Task Force report made it clear that his reaction as to
what he was told was exactly the same as the CIA record of what he was
told.

Page 35. The record is clearly documented in detail as to what
the AMLASH operation was. ‘The authors may not wish to choose
between the record, and what the SSC has said about it (erroneously). l

AS. for Langosch, he was not in charge of the component that was i
xesponsible for CIA operations against Cuba, as the sentence structure i
makes ‘it appear. In fact he was neither responsible for nor familiar |
with the nature of the association with AMLASH, except peripherally. His an:
views on the security aspects of the case, because of AMLASH/1's personality, |
are very different from what he Imew about the actual nature of what was '
and was not going on.

Langosch's lack of familiarity with the details of the operation is
cly apparent if one takes the time to review what he has said on the I
subject, and how it matches the facts. We have already commented else~ i
where how his coments to you about use of the polygzaph betray his

unfamiliarity with the case. The following is also relevant:

. 1. In his testimony before the SSC in 1975, he stated
* that PitzGerald's meeting with AMLASH/1 hed to do with Castro's I
assassination. Had he read the pagers preceding the meeting, - _--



14-00000_

with the specific limitations decided upon, and the report of
the actual meeting (with the basic rebuff given by Fitzgerald, so
fac as supgort was concerned), followed by subsequent reports showing
that ANEASH/1 hed understood that he had been denied support,
Langosch could have spoken differently than he did. as it is; he
spoke in error, if quoted correctly in your draft. -

2, Alo, when testifying before the SSC in 1975, Le
v le to recall the time franz of developirents in the AMLASH
operation, a factor that is critical and central to any analysis
and evaluation of what the operation was during the life of President
Kennedy.. ‘this is directly relevant to your charter and the issue of |
the moment. The CIA Task Force Report documented this in detail. ,

3. And in 1975, when Langosch testified before the SSC, he was
revealed as somewhat vague as to characterization of the AMLASH
operation. In this respect, his testimony seems to have undergone a
significant metamorphosis in terms of firm recollection.

It might be instructive to review Book V of the SSC Final Report at :
page 75. One would think that the man's credibility would be tested }
somewhere along the way, by at least quasi-legal standards:

1. Langosch was not knowledgeable on the AMLASH operation |
at the time it was going on. He atimittedly did not know the . I
time frame. His testimony on key details has been demonstrated
to be’ inaccurate.

2." Langosch's testimony has evolved with the passage of
time. As a witness, what he says does not warrant the > exphasis

given by your draft.

Page 36. Instead of describing Pollock as "from the CIA" he should
be referred to as "a former CIA employee."

Page 37. First line. The word "object" should be "objective."

Page 37. Second line. ‘The word "Cuba" should be "ANLASH/L".
Page 46. ‘The draft's assertion that O'Connell and Maheu are

lying about identification of the syndicate people with whom they were

dealing; this is unsupported by the evidence.

_ the record is somewhat longer than the association of the HSCA
investigators with it, and the only thing they add to it is this
unfounded subjective judgment. I was one of the two CIA officers who
debciefed O'Connell on his part in the. operation, when another inspector
and I did the original 1967 1G xeport on assassinations. At that tine
O'Connell was forthright and did not dissemble, although he experienced
difficulty in recalling sore details.



14-00000 __

At the time of the 1967 interviews, O'Connell related the discov:
of the actual identity of the persons with whom they were dealing pr
as an interesting development in the unfolding events of the oper:
He related his role in a factual manner; he had been given an assignreat
and carried it.out. He related it without explanation ox apology. If he
was presssed by HSCA investigators he may have been asked questioris that
posed the various considerations in terms of rationale, etc., bat that was
not his presentation when he was speaking inside the Agency in 1967 —
then under strict terms of security —- hen he originally recorded hinself
on the matter. He is not a philosogher, and I doubt that he would have
volunteered much on this score. Quite frankly, my impression from 1967
(and I interviewed him again in 1975) was that he was inpressed by the
high-level attention the syndicate gave the matter, rather than being
embarrassed by it. It is more accurate to see him viewing it as a sign
Of the serious attention given by the syndicate, possibly reinforcing
the chances of achieving the objective. O'Connell knew from the beginnin:
that he was dealing with the syndicate, and that there had to be high-level i
approval was a foregone conclusion. .No real thought had been given as to
what sort of person would be assigned to the job, and whomever it was
there was little that could be done about it if the operation was to
proceed. ‘The interpretation of O'Connell's thought processes are far
fetched.

Page 48. O'Connell's name appears several, times in the preceding
pages, but it appears here with Edwards. We might suggest that the word
"they" be substituted. All the other places it can be "Operations
Support Chief”.

Page 57. Second sentence in last paragraph. Request deletion of
entire sentence. It reveals the CIA relations with the Cuban exile
organizations, which we wish to protect. The deletion does not impair
the basic story. . :

Page 58. First complete paragraph, fifth line. Propose following
to be substituted for sentence starting there:

"Moss had previous CIA associations. He also was supposedly
acting as conduit for funds supplied by the Cellini brothers
with the understanding that this group would receive privileged
treatwent in the Cuba of the future."

Page 68-71. . I recall the introduction to the HSCA draft report
that it would not impugn the reputation of innocent by-standers. The
identities of Dan Rowan and Phyllis McGuire fall into this categocy. ‘the
simple and correct story is that Giancana felt that he was being cuckolded
by Rowan and took advantage, in his jealousy, of his new and novel
relationship with CIA. O'Connell should not have gone along with him, but
he did, unfortunately. With the advantage of 20-20 hindsight it may R
logk easy today to have turned it aside then. Remember, when |

We hed no reason then to conceal concern, if any, and current speculation
really doesn't alter the basic facts of that simple story. ‘There really
was nd concern at that tine about Giancana leaking ; .

Suggest we remove all references that identify Rovan and
hoGuire and clean up the presentation to £it the facts.

Page 74. Second line TFR for CIA.

Page 76. A little confusion in the sequence of events hetveen
Phase I and Phase If. When the first access to Castro failed, and
a viable new one did not develop, Roselli went to the Cuban exile
leader. That contact and the apparent uncertainties ‘that it
offered is what was terminated at the end of Phase I. That is where
it started when it was reactivated in April 1962 for Phase II,

Page 77. There are many operations in the Clandestine world in which
the instruments of action are not known in detail to the case officer.
In the Phase II operation, Roselli served as cut-out between CIA and the
Cuban exile leader. In a sense, the Cuban ran his own net and did not
reveal the identities of his people or any specific plans. In the
absence of direct access to the target his operatives had to go in and
develop a way in which to carry out their mission. Had it succeeded, it
would have been possible to reconstruct events after the fact in the
absence of ultimate action it may seem uncertain to some individuals
unfamiliar with the tenuous nature of some clandestine action. The real
guestion today, in my mind, is whether the Cuban exile leader really
dispatched "teams" with the mission they were supposed to have.

Page 77. It may seem extraordinary to the investigators that CIA
operated as it did. First, as mentioned above, there are a number of
uncertainties in the world of clandestine operations. There are numerous
instances in which individuals throughout an operational chain are unknown
to CIA. In this particular case, dealing with representatives of the
underworld, labored under certain practical inhibitions about how far he
could press individuals using their resources to carry out a matual

objective.
