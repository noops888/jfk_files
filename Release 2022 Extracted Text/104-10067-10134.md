2022 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

Office of Legislative Counsel

FIDENTIAL

THE DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE

WASHINGTON, D. C. 20505

OLC -79-0113/L

Chief Counsel and Director

Select Comnittee on Assassinations

Dear Bob:

Herewith are comments on the draft paper on "Evolution and

Implications of

the CIA-Sponsored Assassination Conspiracies

Against Castro."

First, it is noted that no footnotes are attached, so we are

unable to comment on the kind of modifications that have been

required for security reasons in earlier instances.

Next, as we are nearing the end of this phase of things, it

is noted

that we have seen no graphics, and therefore assume that

there will be none of interest or relevance to CIA.

As a preliminary observation - to avoid the endless listing of

instances of recurring citation in the draft - the names of

Jares O'Connell, Tony Varona, and Juan Orta, should be deleted or

replaced wherever they occur.

Substitutes will be suggested where

they first appear. Cubela, of course, should be referred to as

Page 1.

First paragraph. I would like to raise a personal

question on the presentation in this paragraph.

These are my

views, to you; not necessarily shared by my colleagues. There

is as much, if not more, simplistic rhetoric here as there is

mature moral principle,

and you may wish to modify the language.

First, it is not clear whether the draft states categorical

opposition to all assassinations, whatever and wherever, or whether

it is directed only to those considered by CIA — however

ineffective the plans.

Hurder is reprehensible, and contrary to the principles of

civilized society (alchough lawyers make a variety of technical

distinctions between different kinds of homicide). However,

wastern culture has a parellel, if necessarily subordinate, line

of philosophy on the subject of tyrannicide.

writings of church

philosophers, as well as other reputable thinkers, recognize the

principle, given special considerations. These writers fail to

be applied should the question present itself.

This uncertainty.

aids to the complexity of the question, introducing subjective

tests of perception and degree, aspects of life that make life

uncomfortable already for those tidy minds that feel compelled to

deal with everything in blacks and whites.

Let ira pose the problem thus. Had anyone foreseen the extremes

of Hitler, a truly danonic man, would there have been a basis for

seriously considering his assassination? Had he been murdered, at

least six million Jews would have survived, not to mention the many

Sho can confidently

balance the scales on that question, between the rights of humanity,

in the larger sense, and the life of Hitler? I recall the reports of

an atteipt on Hitler's life during World War II, and the general

approbation of American society for the heroes that tried and failed.

It really isn't all that simple, at least not as stated in your draft

introduction.

Obviously it is too complex a subject for a full and considered

discussion here, and my comment is intended only to suggest that

you may wish

to review the presentation on hon the Cormittee finally

speaks on this.

I personally happen to feel that the perceived desirability of

giving the Cuban people a nore enlightened government - shared by

the overwhelming majority of Americans at the time - was unlikely

to have been served by Castro's death.

Quite frankly, I have

similar doubts on the others considered as possible targets for

elimination in the 1950s and 1960s.

And that is why I asked ny first

question about whether your draft categorically includes all political

assassinations, regardless of whatever and wherever, or if it is

directed at those considered during the late 1950s and early 1960s.

My point is that the HSCA craft is subject to imorovement on this

point.:

told.

the authors may not wish to choose

between the record, and what the SSC has said about it (erroneously).

As for Langosch, he was not in charge of the component that was

responsible for CIA operations against Cuba, as the sentence structure

makes it appear. In fact he was neither responsible for nor familiar

with the nature of the association with AMLASH, except peripherally. His

views on the security aspects of the case, because of AMLASH/l's parsonality,

are very different from what he knew about the actual nature of what was

and was not going on.

Langosch's lack of familiarity with the details of the operation is

quickly apparent it one takes the time to review what he has said on the

subject, and how it ratches the facts. We have already contented else-

where how his coments to you about use of the polygraph betray his

unfamiliarity with the case.

The followiny is also relevant:

In his testiony before the SSC in 1975, he stated

• that FitzGerald's meeting with AMLASH/1 had to do with Castro's

assassination. Had he read the payers preceding the meeting,

with the specific limitations decided upon, and the report of

the actual meeting (with the basic rebuff given by Fitzgerald, so

far as support was concerned), followed by subseguent reports shoving

that ANI.ASH/1 had understood that he had been denied support,

Langosch could have spoken differently than he did. As it is; he

spoke in erxor, if quoted correctly in your draft.

Also, when testifying before the SSC in 1975, Langosch

was unable to recall the time frame of developirents

in the AMLASH

operation, a factor that is critical and central to any analysis

and evaluation of what the operation was during the life of President

Kennedy. this is directly relevant to your charter and the issue of

the morent. The CIA Task Forca Report documented this in detail.

And in 1975, when Langosen testified before the SSC, he was

revealed as somewhat vague as to characterization of the AMLASH

operation.

In this respect, his testimony seems to have undergone a

significant metamorphosis in terms of firm recollection.

It might be instructive to review Book V of the SSC Final Report at

page 75.

One would think that the man's

credibility would be tested

somewhere along the way, by at least quasi-legal standards:

Langosch was not knowledgeable on the AMASH operation

at the time it was going on.. He admittedly did not know the

time frame.

His testimony on key details has been demonstrated

to be inaccurate.

2. Langosch's testimony has evolved with the passage of

As a witness, what he says does not warrant the emphasis

given by your draft.

be referred to as "a former CIA employee."

is somewhat longer than the association of the FiSCA

investigators with it, and the only thing they add to it is this

unfounded subjective judgnent. I vias one of the two CIA officers who

debriefed O'Connell on his part in the operation, when another inspector

At that time

O'Connell was forthright and did not dissemble, although he experienced

difficulty in recalling sone details.

At the tire of the 1967 interviews, O'Connell related the discovery

of the actual identity of the parsons with whom they were dealing prisarily

as an interesting development in the unfolding events of the Operation.

He related his role in a factual manner; he had been given an assignant

and carried it.out.

He related it without explanation a apology.

If ha

was presssed by HSCA investigators he may have been asked questions that

posed the various considerations in terms of rationale, etc., but that was

not his presentation when he was speaking inside the Agency

in 1967 -

then under strict terns of security - when he originally recorded hinself

on the matter. He is not a philosocher, and I doubt that he would have

volunteered much on this score. Quite frankly, my impression from 1967

(and I interviewed him again in 1975) was that he was inpressed by the

high-level attention the syndicate gave the matter, rather than being

embarrassed by it.

It is more accurate to see him viewing it as a sign

of the serious attention given by the syndicate, possibly reinforcing

the chances of achieving the objective. O'Connell knew from the beginning

that he was dealing with the syndicate, and that there had to be high-level

approval was a foregone conclusion.

No real thought had been given as to

what sort of person would be assigned to the job, and whomever

there was little that could be done about it if the operation was to

proceed. The interpretation of O'Connell's thought processes are far

fetched.

Page 48. O'Connell's name appears several times in the preceding

pages, but it appears here with Edwards.

We might suggest that the word

"they" be substituted. All the other places it can be "Operations

That contact and the apparent uncertainties that it

offered is what was terminated at the end of phase I. That is where

it started when it was reactivated in April 1962 for Phase II.

the instruments of action are not known in detail to the case officer.

In the Phase II operation, Roselli served as cut-out between CIs and the

First, as mentioned above, there are a number of

uncertainties in the world of clandestine operations. There are numerous

instances in which individuals throughout an operational chain are unknow
