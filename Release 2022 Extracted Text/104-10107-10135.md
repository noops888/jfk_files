1. A meeting was held on 27 January 1969 with Messrs.

Rocca, Houston, Warner and myself to discuss the ramifications

of the confrontation with the New York FBI office on 17 January.

It was concluded that additional information was required on
03(Thomas L, Roberts) and °3 I contacted the Director

of Security and requested the security files on these two individuals

and was advised that we could not have the security files but that

Mr. Ward Greene would bring the files to the office and discuss

their contents openly,

on Roberts) and and was most cooperative in explaining

4, he facts in the attached chronolo ry are subject to
question since they are the result of Roberts own explanation of
his affiliation with Itkin rather than having been determined from
independent sources, The most critical aspect would appear to
be the knowledge or suspicion that Itkin may have known of

03 Q@oberts affiliation with CIA. This knowledge is borne out by

the strange way in which Itkin repeatedly bring: obert3{ name
into the story which Itkin develops about his CIA affiliations.

One of the questions, to be. answered by (PGLOBE personnel is

5. Mr. Rocca was advised by Mr. Sam Papich of the FBI
that the New, York District Attorney may be considering prosecution
against (Robé?t) for having absconded with funds received from
negligence cases. We do not have sufficient information to evaluate
the likelihood of criminal prosecution, It may be necessary to
discuss this problem with representatives of Mr. Hogan's office.

him with Project DTPILLAR from November 1953 to February
1955, and then a request in 1963 by the Domestic Operations
Division for his use on Projec’ INY. In March 1964 DO
Division advised Security that as not going to be used
