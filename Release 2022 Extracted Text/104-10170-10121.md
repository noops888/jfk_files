A. OPERATIONAL

During the period under review, financial support to the

AMSPELL organization has been reduced significantly. As reported

in roforences, the primary reason for the reduction was the

inconsistencies of many AMSPELL activities with current WOFACT

directives.

Cooperation between AMSPELL and the Station has been maintained

through AMHINT-2, the principal agent of the AMSPELL operation.

Although no longer being

carried on a salaried basis, AMHINT-2 has

continued to be responsive to Station guidance.

3. AMSPELL has continued its correspondence with various student

groups and leaders

Latin America.:

throughout the free world; and especially in

ANSPELL has contacted various international student

groups requesting passage money so that its delegates could be

afforded the opportunity to attend upcoming international student

conferences.

40

Pedro

A campaign was launched to call attention to the plight of

Luis BOITEL, a Cuban student leader who was unjustly

imprisoned on the Isle of Pines by the CASTRO regime.

A report/

denunciatton of the imprisonment of BOlTEL was prepared and sent

to AMSPELL's principal

contacts in the Latin American student field

seeking support for AMSPELL's demand that BOITEL be released.

ABSTRACT

Chief of Station, JUWAVE

SUBJECT

DYVOUR/PBRUTEN/AUSPELL/Operational

ANNIINT-2 Trip to Caracas

ACTION REQUIRIO: REFERCACES

AR:

FYI

: Subject, Identity A, recently visited Caracas for the purpose

of: obtaining his residence visa and while there was in

contact with

the local AlSPELL delegation as well as with representatives of the

major student political groups at the Central University in Caracas

(UCV) •

ASHINT-2 was particularly interested in promoting a productive

working relationship between AMSPElL in Caracas and Identity B, which

appears to be a new Christian oriented group organized to provide Liceo

students with

courses and seminars in fighting communism.

A copy .of

the Identity B brochure is being forwarded ünder separate cover No. 1.

On his return, ASHINT-2. reported on the present composition

of the

group.

He indicated that Identity C,

who first

joined AMSPELL in 1960 in Cuba and who recently arrived in Venezuela

from

Santo Domingo, has replaced Identity D

as leader of the group.

A list containing

the names of the other members of

the delegation,

as well as a brief description of their AMSPELL dutios, 1s also

forwarded under separate cover, Attachment No. 2.

At present,

the AUSPELL group in Caracas is concentrating its

efforts on

working with Identity B and in maintaining good relations

the press in order to carry out propaganda at the least cost with

such groups as the Jose Marti Patriotic Club and the UCE.

4:.

The AMSPELL delegation is in contact with a number of student

political leaders

not only

at UCV but at several of

the other universi-

ties.

These contacts include Identities E, F, G, H and I.

THE

EVENTS

IN THE

CONGO

A PROOF OF WHAT COMMUNISM IS

Recort happenings in the Conso have rocked the cive

fiand workd.

learine in their wake a deep preocupation in

the hoarts of all who believed in coen the most dasic prin

ciples of humanity and who see in these acts a vendiful

boast of cruelty against the most elemontal principles of

kindness and respect.

These uhn struggle foe treedom have alwars found in

us the

sumpathy and understanding that only those who

know full well that this struggle entails.can give. He find,

nosever, that in the case uf the utterly irisnumend "Conge

less Troops of Liberation"' we must calong with all cis-

ilived men) denounce this now ind bloody

contribution of

international communism to the eppression and suppression

of all peoples.

This novement has bern,

as uthers have been before,

throsghly infiltrated ty

communists; and in this.

as in

other cases, the true goal of destruction and death sought

by the International can clearly bo seen.

The hearts of youth throughout the world have echoed

in sympathy the cries, the tears,

and the pain of Africa's

birth.

The growth of the Black Continent into a continent

of copublics is a symbol of the inconstable right of this

Continent to a great destiny.

That is

the sincere

struggles for freedom of

African nations have met with our support as with that of

all frecdomloving peoples.

It is this love of true freedom that necessarily places

us in a position of adversity towards this movemont. The

happenings

in

the

Congs

find their motivation

not in d

zealous search for justice andliberty but inthe intorational

policies Moscow and Poking seek to enforce in Africa by

any and all news.

In tho deaths,

the rapes, the insults have greived and

coraged then

Conmunist Bloc and of those who, conciously or out, sere

Without the wichtest trace of scruple these nations

have

hurtled themseires ino acrimonious

if the

nations which took pier in the rescue mission, whose only

purpost was the hummitarian one of saving the lives of

non-belligerents.

The attitude of these nations and the "studont dem-

onstrations"

proval of the Consolese robels clearl show the direction

they

would have. the Congo's liberation take.

Where the

Congolese struggle might have been a war of liberation.

become instoad a senseless war run by mercenarios

When faced with th crimes in the Congo one Soviet

official glibly dismissed the violenes by stating that the

rescuing nations had been warned it would happen if rescue

was attempted.

He sould ask this question of civilized men: Ry what

Code of war ian the staüshier of non-belligerents because

of attempts to rescue then de justified? Since when has it

been found permisible fir an arms to

do its own uglo will

regards to old men, to missionaries, to women, and to

children? Has razism suddent found a moral justification?

Mass

murder and rage can unly

find

justification in

those whose creed is haird and whose aim is to diride.

Fortunately the Corcunises hare not won this battle.

Africa will have freedom, and it will not have the mauled,

caged communist version of it. Those responsible

for so

much ugly violence in the Congo do not represent the spirit

of the Congolese people ard have received the condemna-

tion of Africa and of the whole world.

Africa feels ashamed of what has happened, but this

act will help her understand she has to face an enony us

dangerous, or more so, than colonialism.

The criminal actions of communism in the Congo have

only

one answer and the Airicans themselves will give it:

ITS PEPUDIATION.

"LIBERATED BY THE CONNUNISTS"

The misstonary Paul Carlson lies dead with a card tied to

his throat, assassinated by Congolese communists

on a street in

Stanleyville.: Dr. Carson, in long and diificult years lull of

• sacrifice, brought a message of hope and encouragement to

innumerable. Congolese as

well

as help of all kinds and his

personal collaboration...

was eliminated tragically, as shown

in the

photograph, because of the affection

that the masses

held for him, and

because

of his fane and prestige and the adverse

influence that he signified for the Communists.

He had committed

the sin

of doing whatever was necessary to help the sick and

console the afflicted, and

the reds do not pardon such things.

In their final orgy of blood the Conmunists respected neither

women nor children.

These sere very dangerous "nilitary spies"

according to the Communists.

These (photographs) are the facts

that the propaganda of the

(Castro) Government bas suppressed

in an attempt to present the assassins of missionarles, women

and children as "heroes" and "champions of liberty".

A. OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES

1. Goneral.

AMSPELL has so far survived the internal crisis brought about

by

the collapse of its military activity noted in the previous progress

report:

Howevor, AMSPELL is still faced with a severe financial

problem rosulting from the termination of the military activity.

ANHINT-2 states that AMSPELL has $12,000.00 in short-term loans

which

must be met

shortly, and $20,000.00 in loans being paid off at the

rate of $1,300.00 per month.

AMHINT-2 1s trying to sell the

AMSPELL

boats in order

to liquidate these debts.

So far he has had littlo

success.

AMHINT-2 has. said that he does not intend to give up the

idea of

active participation in the liberation of Cuba-but that AMSPELL

will not conduct new military operations in the future without ODYOKE

assistance and concurrence.

According to AMHINT-2 lack of funds and

intelligence information together with pressure by ODYOkE on Dominican

authorities frustrated the AMSPELL military oporation, and he has no

Intontion of going through a similar disastrous experience again.
