It should be noted here that information reported
in instant .report indicates that ANGELO BRUNO has gained
prominance as a leader in the Italian racketeers. It does
not appear, however, that he has taken over the command of
the racket activity of the organization in Philadelphia and
New Jersey, his prominance appearing to be located in Phila-
delphia and Southern New Jersey exclusively.

JOSEPH IDA, mentioned above, according to information
received in the past, resides in New Brunswick, N.J., and rules
Italian racketeers. PH 251-C on 3/3/59 reported that IDA had
gone to Italy for an extended visit two months previously.

No information has been received by the Philadelphia Division -
indicating that BRUNO has taken IDA's place in command of the
Italian racket element in this vicinity.
