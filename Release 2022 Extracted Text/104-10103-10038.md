MEMORANDUM FOR: Inspector General
SUBJECT : Howard Hunt

1. At the recent request of the Deputy Director for
Management and Services, the Office of Finance has searched .
its records to determine if we could find any payment to :
Mx. Hunt in an amount of approximately $30,000 that required
no accounting. :

2. We have searched the following records:

a. The expense runs for the period July 1964 to
June 1973 for the immediate Office of the DCI, — aeaceeeeee .
the immediate Office of the DD/P, FI Staff, “°- . > i
CI Staff, CA Staff and the Office of Security. ~ :
We have checked various items that were re-
: ‘flected in these expense records but have
identified nothing relating to Mr. Hunt.

IS- :
db. hel Madrid Station, JMWAVE and FR/Washington
Office acCountings to determine if there were
. funds passed by the Stations to Mr. Hunt during
the year he served under non-official cover in
Madrid. We could find no payment to Mr. Hunt
either in his true name or his two identified |
pseudonyms.

c. Mr. Hunt's travel claims for the period
: 1960-1972 and have found nothing in these
travel claims that were not consistent with
normal travel expenses, i.e., transportation, ©
‘per diem. piece : B :

a. We made a specific analysis of Mr. Hunt's
advance account for the period he was under _-
non-official cover (July '65-Sept 66) and have



Boise 2 SECRET

SUBJECT: Howard Hunt

determined that $33,500 was advanced to him
for travel and transportation of household
goods to and from Madrid with one trip to
Paris for he and his family to renew their
Spanish visas. All of this advance was fully
accounted for. However, in his accounting,
one item appeared unusual. It was an Ee
expenditure of $1,600 for a sensitive :
operation which was approved for write-off by Mr.
Desmond Fitzgerald on 1 June 1966 without
further accounting. :

3. Also, we confirmed that no other Agency advance accounts
were established for Mr. Hunt during this period.

4. At the beginning of his non-official cover tour, it
was necessary to establish a bank account in his name. The ©
BUR Division accordingly requested we open an account at the
Chase Manhattan Bank in Mr. Hunt's name to receive all non-
salary payments. (Mr. Hunt had an ‘account at Riggs National
Bank to receive his salary and allowance payments). The
er ite deposits were made to the account during 1965 and
1966: :

Account opened: 13 July 1965
13 July 1965 . $10,000

22 July 1965 5,000
15 September 1965 5,000
6 October 1965 “5,000
19 July 1966 “5,000
: + $30,000.

All o£ the above have been accounted for by submission . -
of travel and transportation accountings. : ne
5. We feel at this time without specific guidelines that

further searching would be somewhat fruitless. One strange
aspect of the non-official cover assignment in Madrid is that
all the costs were charged to the support allotment of the
EUR Division which is not normal as non-official cover people
“are usually assigned to a project... .It is unusual’ to have a =
case officer abroad for one year on an operational -assignmént -
without him incurring operational expenditures. : :

SUBJECT: -Howard Hunt

6. The Office of Finance has not found operational
- expenditures except for the $1,600 mentioned above.
Therefore, it is suggested that Mr. Karamessines be questioned
_as to a project or projects to which Mr. Hunt's operational
expenditures if incurred would have been charged.

7. Another possible. course of. actjon is to request the
Director to approve my asking at Chase i:
Manhattan Bank to provide a transcript of all @ntries into

- Mr. Hunt's Chase Manhattan Bank account. Hi:

8. We are currently reviewing records of all cashier's
checks prepared and issued by Monetary to determine if any ‘
were payable to Mr. Hunt. .Hopefully this effort will be

. £inished by the end of the week. -

Director of Finance
