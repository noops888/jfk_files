MEMORANDUM

TO :

FROM:

Clifford Fenton

Chief Investigator-JFK

John Moriarty gOM

Staff Investigator-JFK

DATE: July 20, 1978

RE :

Mary Ceciliadell Bertucci

0100đ

This lady placed a call to our Committee at 2:30 p.m.

on July 18, 1978, seeking Mr. Bill Brown, and spoke to me

when advised the

former would no longer be available.'

She advised she and her husband had been interviewed

on past occasions by Brown and it was imperative these

reports be modified regarding "the reward."

Previously

she

had indicated she wasn't concerned with the one hundred

thousand dollars, but she's since reconsidered and has decided

to accept this

recompense.

I checked the files and reviewed 5117 (2/7/78), 7196

(4/14/78), and 7255 (4/18/78) submitted by Bill Brown

and found

she reiterated the essential story. Today's notes added the

following data:

1. Maiden name Tinner; DOB, 9/28/43; SS

JFK Act 5 (9) (2) (D)

2. John Fitzgerald Kennedy was her first cousin.

(It

was due to circumstances that they never met.)

3.

Judge Garrison is her attorney of record.

4.

She's currently confined to "Parker 3 West" of

De Paul

Hospital in New Orleans, with

ll of the

15 days' confinement to go.

None of these four items verified at this time.
