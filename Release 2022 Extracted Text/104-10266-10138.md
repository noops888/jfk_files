MEMORINDUM:

SUBJECT

: Handling of LIRING-3 as Hostile Agent

In view of Station Mexico City's statement in paragraph

6 of MEXI 8944 (IN 23093), which presumably comes from

LIRING-3's handler Wallace

B. BOWTON, to the effect that

probabily

LIRING-3 "still has strong anti-U.S. feelings", the time

has

come to review the LIRING-3/Ops-

n the same cable. the Station

sett forth several control elements including true name receipts

and taps made in ROWIAN'S safelouse of LIRING-3's amourous

sessions will a young art student.

What appears to be lacking lA

not considering the case as the handling of a double agent.

raill hostile, ais"'

homework--that is to say, that there are

certain actions that should be taken in the case as follows:

a. Placing of a phone tap on L-3's telephone, if

it can be determined that he has a telephone.

b. Intercept of all mail going to LIRING-3's home

address.

c: Physical and pboto surveillance of L-3 to determine

any patterns of actions or contacts with suspicious persons. if

L3's contacts

and

actions agree with what L-3 tells ROKTON and

to allow ROWTON to be prepared to cover himself in his relations

with L-3.

d. To discretely investigate I-3's sources of income,

l.e., to see if his income from

teaching art classes (and more

Cubans

recently from his wife's

salary from trANS) are sufficient to

account for his scale of living, whatever it is.

## Page 128

14-00000

There are indications in the file that: the "homework"

as outlined above has not yet bees done. The Station was

nod 1

queried in DIR 39039, and in DIR- 07441 as to, the above matters.

It is noted in MEXICO CITY- 89Y that the Station said that

it did not as yet have "independent checks" on this agent,

beyond evidence of entry to the Cuban Embassy furnished by

LIONION photo surveillance, and in fact had only his word on

'a pressus it respravence,

•laimed actions and statements, and that LIENVOY and LITAINI-

confirm that L-4, L-3's wife, is definitely employed as a

secretary to LIRING-l as claimed by L-3. The Station tended to

doubt that I-3 is a Cuban plant but said that even if he were,

that

it was

no additional risk like Station was arferring to

a proposed

trip by L-3 to Cuba) since L-3 would

be provided with

& suitable uncheckable explanation as to how L~3 obtai

on the LOPEZ case.

e. Check as suggested

in DIR 07441 on status

LIRING-4's father, who is presumably a Chinese, repurtedly in

the United States. This is of interest in view of stringent

U.S. entry requirements laid on Chinese.

Shers given the

CUBAN INTEREST IN CHARTERING MERCHANT VESSELS

ACO '

SOURCE

MEXICO, MEXICO CITY

FIELD NO.

A MEXICAN INTELLECTUAL WIO IS A NEW, UNWITTING REPORTING ASSET.

SOURCE EAS CULTURAL AND FAMILY TIES IN CUBA. HE OBTAINED THIS

INFORNATION DURING CONFIDENTIAL DISCUSSIONS WITH OFFICIALS OF

THE CUBAN EMBASSY IN MEXICO.

1. ACCORDING TO WORD RECEIVED IN MEXICO FROM AN OFFICIAL OF THE CUBAN

MINISTRY OF FOREIGN TRADE, CUBA'S MOST URGENT REQUIREMENT AT THE MOMENT IS.

THE CHARTERING OF 24 SHIPS, VARIOUSLY DESCRIBED AS "OF MEDIUM TONNAGE" AND

"OF APPROXIMATELY 10,000 TONS"', FOR USE IN 1967. THIS PROJECT IS BEING

HELD AS SECRET INFORMATION, AND MANY CUBAN OFFICIALS DO NOT KNOW OF IT, EVEN

IF THEY ARE CONCERNED WITH TRADE AND SHIPPING MATTERS. (SOURCE COMMENT:

THE SHIPS ARE POSSIBLY TO BE USED TO TRANSPORT THE 1967 SUGAR CROP, WHICH

ALLEGEDLY WILL REACH LARGE PROPORTIONS.) (FIELD COMMENT: PERHAPS A REDUCTIO!

IS EXPECTED IN SOVIET ASSISTANCE IN THE MATTER OF SHIPPING.)
