References; HYMA 30540 of 10 November 1966

1, A PEQ Part IL for LIRING@3 is being forvarded under separate
cover, It is to be noted that LIRING-3 has not been recruited in the
name of WOPACT, but instead is engaged in cl ine activities for
Wallace B, ROWION, who LIRING=3 believes 1s a Greek businessaan with
international connections who requires economic, political aad personality
Infaemetton 4a ardar to conduct his busin

2. The fact that LIRING-3 is not aware of his WOFACT connection, at
the present timc, outveights the value which would accrue were an attempt
nede to make bim knowledgeable. He performs clandestinely for ROWION
and he 4s actual.y attacking priority targets. In this wey he works
against the target with # clear conscience and his left-wing sentiments
are not threatened,

3. The operation is moving, hovever, toward the eventual full re-
cruitment of LIRTNG=3, but it 18 aoving slovly in that direction because
of the political and social beliefs of Subject. One advantage of this
falee flag recruitment of this individual, at the present tine, ie the
fact that he is able to eater the target area without fear of capture and
exposure as an enemy agent. Under the present plan of operation he believes
his work actually ie aiding the revolution which he believes in from an
idealistic standpoint,

MEMORANDUM: iesisaaiee WwW oa bt

SUBJECT : Handling of LIRING-3 as Hostile Agent

In view of Station Mexico City's statement in paragraph
6 of MEXI 8944 (IN 23093), which presumably comes from

LIRING-3's handler Wallace B. ROWIQN, to the effect that
pity

LIRING-3 "still has strong anti-U.S. feelings". the time, has

Ue. )
come to review the Lintie-3 /opa 7! the same cable. the Station
seg forth several control elenents including true name receipts

and taps made in ROWIAN'S safekouse of LIRING-3's amourous

dent What appears to be lacking i

sessions with a you

wot considering the case as the handling of a double agent.
hostile, pis’ nonework—that is to say, that there are

certain actions that should be taken in the case as follows:

a. Placing of. a phone tap on L-3's telephone, if
it can be determined that he tas 2 telephone.
b. Intercept of all mail going to LIRING-3's home

address.

ce: Physical and photo surveillance of L-3 to determine
Te pa
aif

any patterns of actions or contacts, with suspicious persons.
L-3's contacts and actions agree with what L-3 tells ROWT@N and
to allow ROWIQN to be prépared to cover himself in his relations
with L-3.

ad. To discreftpy investigate I-3's sources of income,
ji.e., to see if his income from teaching art classes (and more
recently from his wife's salary trom MARENG) are sufficient to

account for his scale of living, whatever it is.



a — oy : “
There are indications in the file that-‘the “howevork

as outlined above has not yet been done.. The Station was

pig nied nad
queried in DIR 39039, and in DIR- OMNI as to) the above matters.
It ig noted in MEXICO cITY- 8444 that the Station said that
it did not as yet have "independent checks" on this agent,
beyond evidence of entry to the Cuban Embassy furnished by
LIONION photo surveillance, and_in fact had only his word on

Tm pAbedten coraapeadent 5

claimed actions and statements: and, that LIENVOY and LITAINT-2
confirm that L-4, L-3's wife, is definitely employed as a
secretary to LIRING-1 as claimed by L-3. The Station tended to

doubt that L-3 is a Cuban plant but said that even if he were,

that it was no additioual risk (the Station was r-
a proposed trip by L-3 to Cuba) since L-3 would be provided with
x suitable uncheckable explenation as to how 1-3 obtained info

on the LOPEZ case. t

e. Check as suggested in DIR 07441 on status of
LIRING-4's father, who is presunably a Chinese, repurtedly ia
the United States. This is of interest in view of stringent

U.S. entry requirements laid on Chinese.
