2. Mr. Helms stated be was familiar with the DRE
eituation and desired to work out a slightly different
way of doing business. He realized there have been ups

and downa'in the relationship and that the Agency was
nts, but

not lily white in abiding by many of its comait:
that many of the changes were due to factors beyond the
Agency's control, Ke continued there were no decisions
as yet made by the U.S. Government regarding the future
handling of-the Castro probles. The primary items being
considered at the prosent tise both in Xew York and
Washington were the renoval of the missiles end bonbers
from Cuba ard on-site iaspection. Br. Telus fully re-
alized that tho decisions which my come.about.at the con=
clusion of these negotiations will not be decisions ac~
coptable to the DRE. If a tixe comes when the DRE feels
their course of action is no longer compatible with U.8.
policy, Ur. Helas wanted to make this polot clear, the
DRE should be frank and honest and so state ate He did
not want to be devious about our relationship, and he wanted
to develop the relationship "as & reanonable collaboration”.
3. Mr. Helma inforned tocha he was changing the Agency
contact for the DRE in Miami. He also stated the new co-

tact would be able to cone to Mr. Helas for any clarification

needed regarding the relationship. As for a future
operational progras for the DRE, Mr. Helms stated he pre-
gently did not. know what this would be. Mr. Rocha stated
that 1n all honesty he could not. guarantee that under all
circumstances the DRE woild be able to continue the re-
lationship, for a change in U.8. policy toward coexistence
would differ from what the DRE believes is a duty to their
country and he as the Secretayy General to hie men this
would mean a break in our relationship as they felt they
must continue fighting Castro in any form possible. He
did give Hr. Helms bis word of honor be would inform his
contact or Mr, Helms when the DRE felt thoy could no longer
cooperate with the Agency because of the difference in what
they belioved in and U.S. policy. Rocha claimed they were
anxious to cooperate with the Agency, and it was foolish
to think that without Agency support they could continue
their present level of activity. He in fact stated that 6&0
to 90 per cent of their activity would cence if Agency funds
wers discontinued. This would be suicide, and according to
Rocha this he did not want provided a satisfactory arrange-
ment could be reached. :

4. wr. Laas asked what they could expect regarding
their future orientation and plana. Rocha chimed in and

stated that this sas one of the difficulties under which



. far eee

they bad beon operating; 1.0., not knowing what the plsns
were or what was expected of them. Be added that in

order to direct bis own organization, he sust be avare of
the direction in which wervere moving before he could make
the proper decisions in his orgenization, Mr. Helns
answered "We will tell you the truth and what the score

ie when we know it ourselves". He also warned thon that
when this inforsation is divulged, it would be in atrict-
eat confidence on ef"¥FYI basis and set for the pross oF
the rest of the exile community. Mr. Helms added that on
this question he would be very honest with them and either
tell them: a. I don’t know; B. I won't tell you; e, 1°11
tell you, and give them the information they required for
proper orlontetion. Mr. Helss reiterated that regarding
this type of inforsatioa they must Keop ‘sipped up. Accord-
ing to Kr. Helms tnovthinge get around in the Cuban exile

comaunity was, needless to aay, 8 matter of momo concern

to hia.
6. Rogarding the new ‘contact Mr. Helas stated Re

wanted to select a man who would and could saintain the

‘eolleboration he had outlined, ‘and would bo holpful and

of assistance to the DRE. Me alas atated that this contact
would be responsible to hin for the relationship. Mr.
Rocha stated be wanted to be the point of contact in the

H 5

DRE and im hia absence etther Kanuel Salvat or Jose Lacs
would be the alternate points of contact,
6. ur. Hels stated there vere two elements he -
would like to clarify:
a. The system of kickbacks used by the DRE.
Rocha way not familiar with the term’kiexbach’ but
after a short explanstion explained that the DRE
e did ask their members to sive s certain percentage
of their salary depending on what thoy can fford
for a general fund from which the organization pays
for such ites as the Agency does not Zinance. One
of these itens te publication of “The Cuban Report”,
certain work {o latin America (not specified) for
which the Agency will not pay, and a very important
itemythe mupport of some of their People and familion
coming out of Cubs. Rocha claimed this was voluntary.
Db. . Pinances--lr. Helma deaired to know if they
xXept scee system of books, tocludinglops expences
and salaries for their Latin Aserican operations,
and if so who kept their books. Rocha answered they.
did keep books and added they had a full tine member’
of the DRE who was a trained accountant in charge of

this departaont of their organization. ur. Helms



.
suggested that as finances are a technical and
difficult matter to: keep close tabs on, the Agency
could, if Rocha 20 desired, help by providing a
finance techatetaniect up a set of books for the
DRE, Rocha fully agreed vith the merit of this
suggestion. .
7. Mr, Helms again assured Rocha and Lasa that with
regard to the future, he would let thea know as scon as
be hiaself knew what it would be. Rocha asked how long
ir. Helms thought this would be. Mr. Holma stated this
eno sosewhat of a hypothetical Question but estimated
that the presont meetings, conversations, and negotiations
would possibly take as long as a month, Hr, Helms statod
he realized that military operations and possibly some of
their propaganda would depend on our future ccurse, but
he wanted them to understand that there will aTways be need -
for good, specific, detailed information which the DRE can
contribute, According to Mr. Helms, "We need it; you can

contribute it; we'll use it.” lr, Holay added he realized

there were risks isvolved in collecting information, but
he did not want Socha to misunderstand the value of it.
Ur. Helms also cautioned Rocha and Lasa not to get impatient
over what may appear to be lack of uve of their information,

but to give the Agency a chance to chock it out.



, 8. Mr. Heluz added thore was ono other point of
utmost 1mportance,and that was,that if in the future. the
DRE desired or wanted to have a press conference or desired
to appear on TY, "Let us know ebout it". Mr. Helms etated
he didn't wait to tie their hands, and he. intended to deal
with thom aa responmible mon, but, “Give us @ fair warning”.
Mr. Holas did not want the DRE to think we desired to tell
thes what they can or can not do, but he felt it was in
their interest to get our reaction on such matters. Hr.
Helms added, "You, Mr. Rocba, are a responsible man. I
au a responetble aan. Let's do business in a mature manner,
Mr. Roche fully agreed.

9. Mr, Rocha thon introduced the evbject of "The Cuban
Report”, the Dak weekly newaletter. Be said the nevaletter
was sent to the preaa, senators, congressmen, the White
Rouse, and other people in the U.8. He wanted to know how
Mr. Helna felt about this publication. Ur. Holas wanted
to know if the Ageney received the intel] before it was
printed in the newsletter. Br. Rocha answered tiat all
political and military information wae passed to the Agency
beforo it was printed in the newsletter. Mr. Helns ad~
mitted ho had not read the newsletter and that in the
noantine the DRE could continue ft, Once the matter ia

studied in more detail, Kr. Holns added wo may have some



—

wes

Scggestions we may wish to discuse. Rocha frarkly adaitted
that the DRE felt they needed the newsletter for their
organization to be able to influence public opinion in the

U.3. To satisfy his own curiesity, ir. Helms asked if

Sezator. Keating: figures wore based oa "The Cuban Report",
Rocha ansvered in the affiruative. -

10. Rochas then asked what the D&E could expect re-
garnting execution of military operations, wr. Helas in-
formed Rccha that. when. they had a silitary plaa to subsit
it, The Agency would study it and give them an ansvor,
Mr, Belus added that 1f an answer waa not forthcouing in
& reasouable length of tine, they should agaito ask for
the ansver from their contact. ur. Hela assured Rocha of
Ris continuing personal interest ia this Telatiouship end

he vanted Rocha to del with hia Ageacy contakt in Miast

“with this in mind, but be.warned Bocha that although this

ie ine caso, he did not want the D&S running erd rung on
thetr contact on aattera they can deal with in Miami, Rocha
understood.

11, Am he (Rocha) foared there may have bees certain
Risuzderstardings regarding a request by the ‘man in charge
im Riaat’ on-either the 23rd or atth af Cetober, he felt it

neceasary to set forth his positioa. The ‘man ia charge”



met with Zocha on one of the above dates and saked for.
five mon from the DRZ including Rocha and Salvat to be
diufiltrated into Cuba for intelligence purposes. Con
sidering the allitia in Cuba was on fall alert by this
date therefore greatly reducing the chances of success
of much an attempt, Rocha tried to’get further detaile
regarding the operations, but was only told they would
probably be used to direct artillery fire. Unable to
get more dotaila on what he considered a dangerous and
very risky mission he declined the request. He addod he
found it difficult to ucdorstand the serioussess of such
@ request. He felt that be and Salvat as leaders of
their organization were not available for such uissions
and that as head of bis orgenizaticn, he did not feel ho
could secd his men to their dexth on such a vaguely de-
fined miasion. Rocha continued that he had informed his
men that although the D2Z, as an organization, would not
take the responsibility for sending them in, they were
free to go if they desired to go on their own. Xr. Helas
stated that, needloas to say, proposals and raquests froa
both parties had to be made in all seriousness.

12. Ur, Holms asked 1f there was anything else
Rocha desired to diacuss. Rochs anszered negatively and

leave was taken.
