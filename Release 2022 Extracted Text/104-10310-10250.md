S. It ig believed that the trial of Masferrer or
any of his colleagues could demage Agency interests in
ene or all of the following sectors:

&. Unfavorable publicity concerning
Agency operations against the Cuban target,
notably maritime infiltration operations
based in southern Florida.

The exposure ef current Agency
pote SHHAVE) agents, operational
facilities, covers and operations, notably
those in the maritime infiltration field.

c. The oreation of a climate which

the Caribbean countries, more difficult and
more costly (by virtue of the necessity of
eresting new or more complex cover mechaniens).

@. The appearance of certain individuals at the trial
babonr pan lead to the revelation of inforaation concerning a wide

ts broadest sense, Of the personnel listed in the OGC

able to reveal considerable information concerning certain

operational techniques and facilities enployed by JMWAVE
in the past, ea well as the identity of a aumber of former
agents of the JHWAVE Station. Although, by extrapolation
and. by exbroidering on information and rumors ciroaulating
in bere cae Susve ceranite Cabeza probably cauld present
@ picture o: activity which might appear exciting
to the layman, it seeus unlikely that he hes access to any
significant amount of information concerning sensitive
current ectivyities. While to the knowledgeable person,
withis the Agency ar within the federal comamity in Mismi,
Cabeze‘'s information is likely to be unimpressive, there
seone to he little doubt that he could--as he hes dome on

might the
general public. It is ingossible te predict whether Cabeza
would present the Agency in a unfavorable pa aol ohirasbe spl
he would choose te concentrate hie criticiam against other
federal agencies.

It is pra ell ante Bagi linentnlleiegh Pde bornaonna
concerning these topics is possessed by the group, or to

predict the elant which might be taken by them in presenting
their stories. In the opinion of JMWAVE, on the basia of
the inferzation available to the Station, none of these
individuals posseases a significant sncunt of sensitive
inforwation concerzing current or important past activities.
However, as in the cage of Cabeza, the claizs made by these
individuals re Agency activities might appear impressive to
the general public, especially if spiced with tidbits of
aceurate information.

likely that these current employees (agents) of JHWAVE
would have te provide true and detailed answers in response
to questioniag in court. Such testimony could cause aajor

of fectlities which have not been expased to sgente (e.g-5
the principal caver unit, JHOCEAH) would sot be compromised
through the testinsny of current agents, there ig no doubt

that the to JMWAVE activities, notably but not

SUMAVE/JHOCEAN, In summary it is most unlikely that any
future good would regult from a trial of Masferrer and/or
any of his associates, and it is highly probable that there
would be created a climate which would make JKWAVE
operations—of all types~-more difficult to carry out in

& secure and economical manner. This is not to sry that
SMGAVE would have to go out of business. This was sot the
ease in the "Zenith" flap, nor is it likely to be the case
with Masferrer. However, there appears to be little doubt
that the threshold of sensitivity to Agency activities on
the part of the general public end of these persona who,
tron whatever motives, question the advisability of the
Agency. “operating within the U.S. would be raiaed.

11. The question of using Cesar Dicsdado as a
prosecution witness presents additional problems. Dicsdado
has beea retained as the Customs officer at Key Weat at
the request of the Agency. The Agency reixburses Custous
for Dioadado's salary. Because of his encyclopedic knowledge
ef Cuha and the Florida Keys area and because of his long
involvement in “operational activities” by the Agency, and
by ACSI on cecasion, Diosdado is considered by many

concerning agent identities and operational techwiques, could
be quite damaging, Possibly Diasdade could be carefully

briefed concerning the nature of his testinany co as to avoid
perjury while sot giving sensitive data. However, his nature

Diosdado played a lending role in the investigation of the
Hasferrer affair, including previeus abortive attezpts by

arrested and the arma confiscated. The defense might well
accuse Diesdade of having acted net only for the U.8.
Customa but alse on behalf of the Agency.

13. Im addition to the foregcing points it should he

and the “Bay ef Pigs" could reopen the whole question and
