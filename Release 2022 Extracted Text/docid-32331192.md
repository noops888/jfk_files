! On 5/7/63, STEVE KAS, PCI, advised SA CARLTON

i GIOVANNETTI that he had been to 1915 Biltmore Street, NW.» |
on the night of Saturday, 5/4/43, and that there was a fairly |
! large dice game held that night. PCI said that the dice game |
| i was held in a large room om the second. floor and that the '
| following individuals participated: HOURINE; MITCHELL; 4
| EDMONSTON, JIMMY LUBIN and othere when ‘he could sot identify.

On 5/6/63, Deputy Chief ROY B, BLICK, Metropolitan
Police Departwent (MPD), advised SA RO! L. SHACKELFORD
| that he had received information that there vas a gambling
| operation located xt 1915 Biltomore Street, N.W. According
. te Chief BLICK he sent two Morals Division psrseanel] (aot
mamed) to the evtablishwent Saturday evening, 5/4/63, at
approximately 10:45 p.m. Chief BLYCK advised that the
establishment ms a large threo story structure and that the iH
interior was Invishly furnished, Aecording to Chief BLICK {
there was no gambling activity during the period that the
MPD representatives vere there and he advised that JOSEPH
\ GORDON and "BILLY" MIRCHELL were the only ones present.

In conmection with information furnished by Chief
BLICK it is likely that the MPD officers vere at 1915 Biltmore
Street prier to the tine PCI KYDAS participated im the dice
gano the game night.

In view of the above developments it appears that
the dice gane at Ripley, Maryland, hao beos abandoned for i
the present. Umaesuch as the operation at 1915 Biltmore :
Street iavolves substantially the same individuals as vere
involved im the Ripley, Maryland, operation, it is likely a
that thé Sif Lor the game has boem meved. Accordingly it
ig recommonded that the office of origia be changed fren
Baltimore to WFO since it appears that the operation has been
moved fio Ripley, Maryland, to tho District of Columbia.
Extra copies are provided for the Bureau for motifzication to
Baltimore and WFO of the change.

fakormation copies of inmtant semmunication are
being directed to alk offices whe have az imterest in the
subjects Lavolved.
