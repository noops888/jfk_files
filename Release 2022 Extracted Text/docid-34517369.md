She was secretary to Mr. LUKIANOV anc occasionally
cid minor correspondence for some of the other men. She
recalled that Mr. “UKIANOV left some time late in 19.6, and
that GAVRILOV was the last remaining Soviet who closed up the
office. Mrs. ONICK stated her duties consisted of writing
letters in English to the Empire Shipping Company, Yarrow's
Shipyard and other Canadian firms doing business under a
"lend lease" arrangement with the Soviet Government. She
said the Soviets did not entrust her with any highly confi-
dential information, usually taking care of this themselves.
She said she knew very little concerning their day to cay
activities except for what appeared to be legitimate matters
connected with Russian-Canadian trace. She recalled that
LUKIANOV frequently called the American Consulate concerning
clearance for Soviet seamen and also made arrangements for
travel of other Soviet personnel. She said GAVRILOV appeared
to be handling repairs of Soviet ships and NAZAROV also had
duties which frequently took him to the Soviet ships in port.

Mrs. ONICK recalled a Lieutenant ALEXANDER G. PAVLOV
whom she believed mace two trips to Vancouver from Ottawa,
Canada, and she said she had also heard of Commander NIKOLAL
IGNATIEV, who hac formerly been a Navy convoy officer at
Vancouver. She had also heard of one GENNADI ZYRIANOV, who.
preceded LUKIANOV as head of the officc.

Mrs, ONICK was also acquainted with hrs. LUKIANOV,
who claimed to have been a dentist in Russia.

She said the above Soviets occasionally attended
social affairs with some of the well known people in Vancouver,
B. C. of Russian descent, particularly Mr. LUXIANOV, however,

she said she can not now recall any of these people specifically.

She said she had no social contacts with the above Soviets
except on one or two occasions and she said that nothing of
any security interest transpired at these events.

irs. ONICK was shown photographs of a considerable
number of Soviet personnel who were attached to the Soviet
Government Purchasing Cormission in the Seattle, Washington -
Portland, Oregon offices in the United State, however, she
was not acquainted with these individuals and could furnish
no information concerning then.

SERGET GRIGORIEVICH LUKIANOV

In August, 193, Confidential Informant SE T-1,
of unknown reliability, advised that one LUKIANOV,
member of the Soviet Government Purchasing Commis-
sion in the United States, was one of uber

Soviet Government officials who were then engaged
in espionage in the United States. It is believed
that this individual is identical with SERGEI
GRIGORIEVICH. LUKIANOV, who was a member of the
Soviet Government Purchasing Commission in the
United States from about 1913 to 1945 at which
time hé was transferred and became Chief of the
Soviet Purchasing Commission in Vancouver, B. C.,
Canada.

LUKIANOV is believed to have departed from

Canada on September 23, 1916 enroute to Moscow via
New York. He departed from New York on October 23,
1916. According to records of the United States
State Department, he returned to the United States
in Jan uary 1919, as Secretary to the Soviet
Delegation to the International Conference on Wheat
and remained in this country until March 25,

191.9. Investigation during this latter period

did not disclose he was engaged in intelligence
activities.

Mrs, ONICK advised that she had no knowledge of
any espionage activity or any activity upon the part of the
above Soviet personnel which was against the best interests
of the Canadian Government and as far as she was able to
determine, their business in Canada appeared to be entirely
legitimate. She said that none had ever approached
her to engage in any type of activity in behalf of the Soviet
Government. .

NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR CANADIAN-SOVIET FRIENDSHIP SOCIETY,
Aka THE CANADIAN-SOVIET FRIENDSHIP SOCIETY, CANADIAN-

The National Council for Canadian-Soviet Friendship
Society is the forerunner of the present Canadian-
Soviet Friendship Society which has been described
as a "Communist Front" by confidential informant
T-2, a confidential source abroad. T+2 advised
that this organization was not considered under
open Communist control until 19.7.

Mrs, ONICK related that the above organization, to
the best of her knowledge, was organized in approximately
191.0 or 19,1 when Russia and Canada were close allies.
She said it was a cultural organization to begin with and

was sponsored by many prominent and loyal Canadian citizens in Vancouver,
B.C. She claimed that originally the Prime Minister of Canada, the
Lieutenant Governor and such prominent individuals as Dr. (FNU) MacKENZIE,
President of the University of Vancouver, B. C., were among the members
and sponsorse She recalled that LEON LADNER, an attorney, was chairmane

Mrse ONICK could not recall the exact circumstances surrounding
her joining of the above organization, but believed she had read about
it in the local newpapers. To the best of her recollection, she joined
the organization about 193 and attended functions of the organization
at infrequent intervals during 19l)3-lh. She said that sometime during
this period, she was nominated to the Board of Directors of the organi-
zation, which position was entirely honorary and involved no work or
activitye She asserted the activities of the organization were handled
by the president and secretary.

Mrs. ONICK recalled attending several social functions of the
organization in the form of dinners-which were held in the salon of the
Hotel Vancouver. She also attended one function at the University in
Vancouver, Be C. She described the above functiorsby stating they
appeared to be purely social and cultural in nature, and there were
discussions concerning an interchange of music, drama and literature
between Canada and Russiae

Mrse ONICK said she could not recall specifically any person’
asking her to join, nor could she recall at the present time the names
of the officers or members.

Mrse ONICK stated that at the time she felt flattered to belong
to an organization of that kind since she was a very young, naive girl
just out of hich school. She said that at the time she was a member,
Russia and Canada were on very friendly terms and it appeared the
fashionable thing to-doe Mrs. ONICK believed that her attendance at
functions of the organization ceased during the latter part of 19) or
very early 195«

She said it was possible the organization continued having
her name on the letterhead of the official stationery after she had
ceased attending functions and said her severance of connections with
the organization was very gradual. She recalled that some time in 195,
it was disclosed that Soviet Government officials had been engaged in
espionage in Canada and relationships between Canada and Russia became
strained. Mrs. ONICK was of the opinion that many members of the organi-
zation who had been active during World War II, dropped out at that
time although she could not furnish any detailse

She Said that none of her relatives belonged to this —

mother, particularly, sought enjoyment in the musical and social ~
activities ofthis organization. She said that her brother, WALTER,
was also a member of this organization. She advised that she had
attended social functions of this organization since she was a little
girl and during World War II, she was asked to join the choir and _
orchestra. She also took music lessons there when she was small. Mrse
ONICK stated she was aware there were persons in this organization who
were interested in political matters, but she said the organization
contained a great variety of people whose interests were variously

divergent and she claimed to have no knowledge of any Communist
influence or control of the organization. She could recall no
attempts by the organization to teach Communist principles. Mrse
ONICK stated that subsequent to World War II she began working
and her contacts with this organization were less frequent.

POLISH DEMOCRATIC ASSOCIATION

T-2 as a Communist controlled organizations

It has previously been reported that T-2 advised in August,
1955, that WALTER BELOBRODSKI,trother of Mrs. ONICK, was a member of

Mrs. ONICK rélated that her brother WALTSR immigrated to
Canada separately from the other members of the family, coming in
1939. He lived with the family in Vancouver, B.C. only about one
year and then moved to Vancouver Island. She said he went into the
Canadian Army in about 191 and was wounded at the battle of Dunkirk.

is also a member of the Polish Democratic Association.

The Labor Progressive Party of Canada has been described
as a Commnist controlled organization by T+2.

Mrs. ONICK said she was aware of the exsistence of the
labor Progressive Party in Canada, but stated she has no informa-.
tion concerning its' activities or membership and she stated she
does not know whether her brother WALTER and his wife have ever been
affiliated with this organization in any manner. She stated that it
was possible they could have been members without her knowledge due
