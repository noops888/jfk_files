" ~ KOPLENTG, FISCHER and other dustrian Communist leaders were frequent visitors
‘to the Cuban Legation, Menendez said, as was an Austrien newspaperman by the name
‘of Bruno FREY, who had lived some time in Mexico. Menendez believed that Frey
wes on the Cuban payroll, furnishing political information on the Austrian scene.
Frey's daughter, Elizabeth, was employed by the Legation as a receptionist.
Formerly, the Legation employed a Peruvian by the name of Dr. José CALDERGN as
‘~ i translator. Calderén, however, stauchly anti-communistic and a good Catholic,

was edited in Havana but tranelated into German by the Legation. Additional copies
were given out by the Legation to visitors. Moreover, he attended cultural
functions and lectured in Austrian institutes of higher learning on Cuba. He also
.assieted in’ the recent drive of the Cuban Government for the hiring of foreign
“technicians and interviewed Austrian technicians interested in working in Cube. ~
He ‘set: the mmber of those interviewed at six. Menendez claimed not to have had
cess to: classified information end said that Mrs. Palenque, who controlled. the
safe.was_so careful,that he was not able to take any papers out when he defected.
‘He. claimed to have had no lmowledge of the intelligence and commnications work —

quipment. Pouches were delivered weekly to the Czech Embassy in Vienna for

There was only one Cuban ‘student in dustria. He was “Davia GARCIA santanaris,

a & visitor ‘frequéntiy s seen’ in the Legation was DOMINGUEZ (fnu), a Spanish exile,
who wes active in the World Peace Organization. Menendez recalled elso that
during the last few. months, he had seen three Americans at the Legation. One was a

student, whom he characterized as a beatnik type who came with a girl, who

probably was also an American, inquiring about the possibility of obtaining a visa

for Cuba. The second.man, whose name he believed to have been Robert GOD; came H

five or six times in-June. He was also interested. in going to Cuba. He thought f
ce that Mr. Good was about 30 years old. Finally, about eizht months ago a t

Mr. PORTER called at the Legation. Mr. Porter, who returned. to the Legation in i
June, claimed to be an ex-serviceman; to hava been in the US Army and to have :
participated in the Normandy landings. Porter described himself as a student of .
history and sociology at the University of, Wienna and asked for magazines and.
books about present day Cuba. . ‘ :

Menendez was reluctant to tell anything about his training for his job,
and claimed to have been instructed briefly in the Foreig Office by RUIZ DE VELASCO
on cultural affairs. He alleged that he received his position. through a passing
:- goquaintence with Cuba's present Ambassador. to Bolivia Roberto Ady: beard he

ee befriended duringthe Batista regime.

wety Comments From Menendez' story and the Spanish police report it appears ‘that

his motivation for defection was only in part-if at all-connected with his

7 ideological ‘Qpposition to Castro, At the Legation, working as a receptionist- -

- typist. was a Spanish girl, Matilde HERRERA, and it seems that Menendez got
emotionally involved with her, and when he received orders to return ,he abandoned
his wife and son and followed her to Spain, where she had gone a few days before
him. It would appear that Menendez had a moré active part in the operation of the

_, Legation.than he edmits, and at least in the times of Geinza had access to ~

classified material. ‘This he plays dom, because his stay in Spain depends on hia

~ ability ‘to convince the Spanish authorities that he had never been a Commmist and

_ that.he is only a. small fish. Additional cae on some intelligence —
