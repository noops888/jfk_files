REPORT OF FINDINGS

(LISTED CHARACTER REFERENCE) On 14 November 1968, Hugo Rivera,
Assistant Manager, American Finance Corporation, 556 7th Avenue, New York,
New York, who resides at 2020 Walton Avenue, Bronx, New York 10453, was inter-
viewed at his place of employment concerning Manuel MARTI. Source who has been
a close friend of SUBJECT for approximately 12 years stated substantially
as follows:

Source and SUBJECT first met approximately 12 years ago when they
were both attending elementary school at PS 20, Simpson and 167th Street,
New Yori. They were classmates from elementary school through Junior High
School number 40, Prospect Avenue, Bronx, New York, and through their
sophomore year at Evander Chiz@ss High School, 800 East Gunhill Road, Bronx,
New York, in 1962, when Sourcé dropped out of school and went into the United
States Army.: Source and SUBJECT visited each other regularly while they were
in school together, and because of their mutual interest in coin and stamp
collecting. After Source went into the Army he did not see SUBJECT again
until WSS discharge in 1964; however, they corresponded with each other
regularly. Since 1964 they have had frequent social contact, and Rivera
last saw MARTI on 12 November 1968 when HE was home on leave to attend the
funeral of HIS uncle who Source knew only as Polo.

Source believed that SUBJECT and HIS brother, Ivan, were bern in
Puerto Rico but came to New York City when they were very young. When they
first met SUBJECT resided at 905 East 167th Street, Bronx, New York, with
HIS parents, Reyes and Manuel Marti; HIS brother, Ivan, and their younger
sister, Blanca, who is now approximately 14 years of age. Prior to HIS
induction SUBJECT resided with HIS family at 1201 University Avenue, Bronx,
New York. HIS mother died in early 1967 from lung cancer. HIS only known
employment was with an insurance firm on Third Avenue, New York, New York,
where MARTI worked as an IBM operator, further details unknown. SUBJECT'S
father was formerly employed with an unknown shipping company, but Source
had no knawledge of HIS present employment. HIS uncle, Polo, who died
recently, used to operate a small grocery store on 163rd Street, Bronx,
New York, exact location not .recalled.

SUBJECT and HIS brother were brought up in a very respectable
home, and their mother exercised rigid control over their activities even
after they were fully grown. They were not allowed to participate in any
of the games and other activities in which boys usually participate with
the other children in the neighborhood, and as a result SUBJECT had had
very few close friends. Most of SUBJECT'S spare time was always devoted
to reading or to HIS hobby of coin and stamp collection. Although SUBJECT
is a perfectly normal male, Source did not recall HIM ever having a

REPORT OF FINDINGS

girlfriend. HE is completely honest, trustworthy, and dependable, and HE
has never had a moment of difficulty with law enforcement agencies. When
SUBJECT'S brother was drafted into the military service SUBJECT was granted
a deferment in order that HE could assist in supporting the family since
HIS mother was ill. When HIS turn came to be drafted HE did not utter a
single complaint about going into the Army because HE felt that HE had an
obligation to go. Source stated that HE would stake his life on SUBJECT'S
loyalty to the United States. Although he had no knowledge of SUBJECT'S
father's political or organizational affiliations, Source recalled that he
occasionally brought home the socialist newspaper, name not recalled,

and would side with the comments made in the paper that were critical of
the United States and its policies. On these occasions SUBJECT and HIS
brother would always argue in defense of the United States, and SUBJECT'S
father has never been able to influence HIS political thoughts and belief
in any way. SUBJECT never travelled abroad, and is not known to have any
relatives residing abroad. -HE uses alcoholic beverages moderately, and
does not gamble or use habit forming drugs. Source knew of nothing that
would reflect adversely on MARTI'S character, discretion, maturity, or

emotional stability, and HE has no organizational affiliations, except
perhaps some club connected with stamp and coin collection. Source was
unable to furnish any information concerning SUBJECT's listed character
references Juanita Reyes and Aleanso Ortiz. Carlos Delgado, SW 33rd Street
between First and Second Streets, Miami, Florida, is a friend of SUBJECT.

Rivera highly recommends that MARTI be favorably considered
for a position of trust and responsibility with the United States Government.
