SUBJECT > Interview with Mr. William K. Harvey 5

Mr. Belin: This is an interview that I've had with

Mr. William K. Harvey, 1611 Northwood Drivel,
Indianapolis, Indiana 46240. I am going to make a transcript
of this interview which has taken place on April 10, 1975 in
Mr. Harvey's home, and I will send to Mr. Harvey for his
review a copy of the transcript for his additions or correc-
tions or changes, and then what we'll do, we'll ask that the
transcript as corrected be attached in an affidavit form
for forming a part of the record of the Commission.

Mr. Harvey is a native of Indiana. He was born on September
13, 1915 in Danville, Indiana. He graduated from High School in te:

Haute. He is a graduate of the University of Indiana Law
School (1937). He i $ i

That is correct. I would like to add one thing, if

question of propriety. But I want you to know that

wh was on
ete te as of this.

All right. . I first asked /you with regard to any
knowledge of any assassination plans or plots withir

the Agency concerning Patrice Lumumba and you might indicate
what your response was to that, Mr. Harvey. ~ > Gao

I have no personal knowledge of any such “plan or
operation within or on the part of the Agency.

I also asked you apart from the question of Fidel
Castro whether or not you had any knowledge of -

any assassination plans or plots in the Agency that involved
any‘ other foreign leader. .

H: ‘Beyond the loose talk, "Would it be desirable"
or “Wouldn't it be fine if", I do not.

B: You know of no other plans except Castro. Is that
correct?

H: No. Plans in the sense that a decision was made

to attain that objective and an actual plan or
Operation started for that purpose, I do not.

B: All right. One of the reasons that we're here is -
to discuss the question of what knowledge you had about

this whole area, and I believe you indicated that at one time

you had a conversation with someone in the Agency concerning

what ‘that person called a request from the White House for

the Agency to develop what was called an "executive action

capability". Did you have such a conversation with anyone’

in the Agency?

H: Yes, I did.

B: And who was that?

H: Richard Bissell. .

B: And I believe you indicated that that took place
in either 1961 or 1962. Is that correct?

H: . To the best of my recollection that particular
discussion probably took place in the latter part
of 1961.

B: Do you remember what Richard Bissell --

could

A: ° --it just conceivably/have been very early '62.

B: Do you remember what Richard Bissell told you and
what you told him? mo

H: Not precisely.

B: Do you remember that he in substance said that

the White House or someone in the White House had
raised the question of whether or not the Agency should develop
what was called an “executive action capability", a capability
of assassination or liquidation of leaders of foreign countries?

H: To the best of my recollection that was stated.

B: Was it stated just once or perhaps on more than
one occasion? '



Photocopy from Gerald R. Ford Library

-4-

H: ‘I can only be certain as to once.

B: All right. But it might have been on more than
one occasion?

H: That's possible, but I have no real recollection
that -- the statement which is best I can recall

is that the White House has more than once raised the question

of whether we should have a capability for executive action.

B: OK. I believe you indicated to me that you first —
learned about the Castro operations from Bissell who
instructed) you to talk to Sheffield Edwards who had been
involved with the operation before you became involved. Is
that correct?

H: To the best of my recollection I may have been told

of the operation before I was asked to-discuss it
with Edwards and take it over. I cannot be certain whether
there was one discussion of this or two. I think possibly I
may have known about it before I was asked to take it over.

B: All right. And then after you were asked were you
briefed at all by Bissell or did you get your

. initial briefing from Sheffield Edwards?

H: I was only briefed by Bissell that such an opera-
tion had been mounted, what the objective was, < .
and that it had been handled through Sheffield Edwards. I do
not recall if he went into further detail or not, ‘but-in other
words whether or not he may have said that a contact was made —~
with this person or this type of person. But in any event it
was not a briefing as such or in any detail. It would merely .
have been a summarizing : PP,

B: All right. Then you did get a briefing in detail.
- though from Sheffield Edwards, is.that correct?

H: Yes. my -

B: And Edwards ‘was in what capacity at that time?

H: At that time he was Chief of the Office of -

Security. ‘.

B: i. All right. Then did he put you in touch with the

. . case officer?

H: “Yes.

B: And that was Mr. O'Connell, is that correct?

H: Correct. : we

3B: Now, I believe, that you said that prior to this
time you had had contact with Robert Maheu because
you had been both jin the same FBI training class together but
that you didn't have any contact with Maheu during this period
of time to any degree.. Is that correct?

H: The last time that I saw Maheu or talked with
Maheu or had any direct or indirect communication
with Maheu would have been about 1946, possibly '47.

B: All right. I believe you said as you went through
the entire analysis of the plan you called it among _
other things a “damn fool idea to start with" -- I'm saying

you called it in our prior conversation today before we started
taping this interview, and you thought it had been handled in
an incredibly amateurish fashion. Is this accurate?

H: I'd like to be sure that this is precise. This

was my tentative opinion of it. wt coe. ot
Whether I expressed exactly those words either to Colonel
Edwards or to Bissell, I am not sure. But I may -very well’ have
I may have expressed them subsequent to that time.

to me today that you thought we were dealing with -

is concerned. . —~
That is correct.
H: : /It was not just a question of my not being able
to afford that it go off, but in the aftermath
of the Bay of Pigs failure, that was not the kind of an explosior
that the Government, the Agency, or anybody else could well affor

B: And one of the concerns you had, I believe, was
. that so many people seemed to know about the plan.
. Is that correct?

H: That is correct.

B: Do you have any opinion as to whether or not
Castro might or might not have known about it?

H: Given the capabilities of Castro's security >
appara’ and the general sieve-like character +=
of the Cuban community in exile and the number of people who -
knew: at least something about this particular incident or
Operation, before I had any connection with it, or later as
a result of things that occurred before I had any connection
with it, I think and thought at the time that it was quite
conceivable that it had been penetrated.! |E cannot
honestly state that I had at that time any firm reason to

believe that "Castro was aware of this operation".

B: I believe that you discussed this with Edwards
and then O'Connell and then with Helms. Is that
correct?

H: Yes.

“Be And I think you also said that if you got involved

you felt you had to take over the contact with
John Roselli to have control of the situation: Is that correct?

And that =
H: /T wanted everyone else cut out. :
B: You met Roselli first in New York and when,
approximately?
H: To the best of my recollection about early April
of 1962. : ‘ :
B: Roselli was working with Cuban exiles and /with organi
gamblers, is that correct?
H: That was my understanding.
B: And after that first meeting with Roselli at which

I believe you indicated to me earlier --and when I
. Say "earlier", we had an extensive interview before we started |
taping here - is that correct?

H: That's correct.

B: After that first meeting, !you feel that O'Connell from
that time forward was not involved in the situation.
Is that correct? So far as you were concerned?

H: ..; far as I was concerned and I shortly thereafter

expressed the conviction that that should be the case

to which Colonel Edwards agreed, I do not remember: the exact

date that O'Connell was instructed to stay completely out of

this operation -- instructed by Colonel Edwards, that is. But

it would have been some time rather shortly after this. ~

B: And then as I understand it basically, you reported
wth to Helms that you were taking -- you had already :

By what means
B: /were they going to try and assassinate Cuba -- or
a Cuban leader - Castro?

H: . I was told that there were two possibilities -
rifle fire and the use of poison. e

B:. On the rifle fire, did you participate with the
financing to enable one of theSe Cuban exile groups

that Roselli was involved with to acquire guns and ammunition?

H: I did participate in one delivery of arms and
: some related equipment. |. D
B: . And where did that delivery take place?
H: It took place in Miami.
B: : And do you know approximately when that took place?

Might it!/have been in late '62 or early "63?

H: Well, it certainly was not in '63. I do not believe
. it was as late as late '62. To the best of my
recollection, it would have been about mid-'62.

B: All right. Did John Roselli ever “ask. any money
personally for any of the work he did on this?

H: No. He did not. And I am sure he knew that had

he asked, given the amount of his own personal
funds he had expended in travel expenses and’so forth, that. he r
could have gotten money. As a matter of fact, I believe that
Roselli made it a point of pride to take absolutely nothing
either in personal financial gain or to at any time then or
since to use this in an effort to secure favorable U.S.
Government consideration in any of the various problems he

may have had with the U.S. Government. vy

Now, Mr. Harvey,

Be /S0 you know how much money was paid in the
Summer of 1962 - mid—'62 - for these gun deliveries,
approximately? me
. 3 4
H: I don't remember exact amount that the shipment ‘
of arms was valued at. There was a not large cash
Payment made to this Cuban group. I believe it was in the low
four figures, but the exact amount I do not remember.
Br Plus or minus $5,000? ,
H: Certainly not plus, and I would think minus. ns
B: Do you remember if it included both rifles and
handguns? .
A: I believe that it did, yes.
B: And I believe you also told me drugs such as anti-
biotics.
Hs Yes, there were some medicinal drugs, anti-biotics,

and so forth, which as I recall was a fairly minor
part of this.

B: Were the poison pills involved botulism pills?
H: . I don't know.
B: They were pills which were to be used in - to

dissolve in food or something of that nature?

H: My understanding that they were - whether they

were pills or what they were, I don't. know, but a sub
stance was |to be orally administered, I believe in food or
drink, but I'm not positive.

B: Did you ever get a report from Roselli that the
people had gotten into Cuba with the guns and
with the pills? ‘

H: I did receive a report from Roselli that he had
received from his Cuban contact that the arms oy

had gotten in , the people had gotten in, and the material A

had gotten in, and that they had high hopes of success for °.

the operation. :

B: * But the - of course - there was no ultimate success ~
so far as the killing of Castro was concerned.

H: There was no ultimate success, and as far as I
personally know, there was never, even any credible ;
attempt made.

B: Do you have any opinion why?

H: I don/t know that iz have any valid opinion why.
There are a great many things that could have
happened. It wasn't tried, it was choked off, it was pene-
trated from the start - at least on the Cuban’end -- that is
the end in Cuba. When I say I had no personal knowledge of —_
this, I am aware that Castro has claimed there were a number
of attempts on his life. I am aware that he has blamed those
on the U.S. in general and on CIA in particular. But I have
no personal knowledge of facts which would prove that there
was ever actually if you will, a shot fired or any poison
administered, or any other attempt other than in the inchoate

stage. e
B: Mr. Harvey, diagohn McCone know at this time what
was going on? .
H: To my knowledge, he did not. :
B: You were at a meeting of the Special Group (Augmented:

in the Department of State in August of 1962 when
someone: brought up the possibility of liquidation of Castro,
is that correct?

H: . That is correct.
B: Do you remember what Mr. McCone’ did at the time?
iH: Yes. He got rather red in the face and made a

an comment "Well, that's not something that should
be discussed" Now, please don't hold me to these

words.
B: That's to the best of your recollection? ~
H: The best of my recollection is I was at that ~

meeting with John McCone. To the best of my 7
recollection the remark that he made was a clear effort to ©,
stop any such proposals, suggestion or any discussion thereof.
at that meeting within that forum immediately. :
B: Earlier, before that meeting, had you had any dis-

cussiors with’ Richard Helms about whether or not
McCone: should be advised of what was going on after McCone

became DCI?
H: Yes, I had. tA

foo

-10-

B: And what was the substance of your conversation
with Richard Helms?

H: I do not recall how the question came up as to
whether the new DCI should be briefed or not. I
may have raised it. But I did recommend to Mr. Helms that
since this particular "operation" and the possible repercussions
from it all stemmed from actions which had taken place long
before either Helms or myself had had any personal connection
with it, and before John McCone had had any connection whatever
with the Agency, and since the decision had been made at that a
time that this should be sanitized, tied off and terminated
as soon as practically feasible, I saw no reason why the new
DCI should be briefed on it, and I strongly recommended that
he not be. :

B: Ultimately you decided that the planshad little
chance of success and you decided to wind down
the plans. Is that correct? . .

H: I would object to the word "ultimately". - Phat

is substantially correct if you put it within the
time frame that I reached a tentative conclusion to that effect
very shortly after I was able to fully debrief Roselli and
assess what had gone on in the past, the people that we could fin
out: that were involved in it who I checked out file-wise and so &
as against what we then knew of the general capability of
effective action within Cuba.

B: And then in order to not have an explosion from
a too-abrupt termination, you determined to
gradually tie it down and wind it up, is that correct?

BH: That is correct. Remembering, Mr. Belin, that

- in the initial phases of this it was quite |

obvious that there was an explosion potential here--an explosion
not in the technical sense -- a flap potential, if you will,
but it took some time to find out just what could‘be done

and how it could be done, to try to sanitize the possible
repercussions of this. 5

B: Any other thing that you wish to add for the 7

record here? aN

Hs. Only that I assume you will write up your notes :

of this. If you do I would appreciate a copy.

B: You will get a copy of whatever I write in that
regard.
H: The only other comment that I would like to make

for this tape is that to the extent it is possible
I would request that actual identities be sanitized from this
insofar as it is possible to do so.

B: And that's for purposes of protecting rights of
privacy to people including yourself?

H: Exactly. It is not as I said earlier in our FT
informal conversation that this is an oblique
pleading of the Fifth Amendment.

B: I believe you then indicated to me that you went
to Rome in approximately June of 1963.

H: That is correct. It was June 1963. ‘
B: And had no further contact with this Cuban operation
from that time forward. Is that correct?
H: That is correct. C jt
B: Anything else you wish to add on the record? _”

H: Onefplease. One—catshy’” There have, as you know,

been some unfortunate and in my opinion distorted
allegations about that that have surfaced publicly sine then,
but I have had no official connection with any Cuban operation
of any kind since June--probably May would be more accurate--at
the very latest--of May of 1963. And from the time that I left
the Cuban task force in the early months of 1963--to the best
of my recollection around March--I have in no sense attempted
to keep current or involve myself in it in any sense whatever.

B: Anything else you'd wish to add? —

H: You want this for the record--or off the recéra?

B: Either way. -

H: I have nothing to add to the tape unless you have a

further questions. %

B: . No Sir, I just want to thank you very much for your
cooperation and I'll get a transcript to you on this.

H: What I'd like to say--and this has no business in the ©
