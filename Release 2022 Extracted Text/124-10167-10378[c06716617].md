FRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

WASHINGTON, D. 6. 20905

25 February. 1976

The Honorable Otis Pike, Chairman

Select Committee on Intelligence

House of Representatives

Washington, D. C.. 20515

Dear Chairman Pike:

I hereby acknowledge and accept the terms set forth in your

letter of February 20 for safekeeping of the three categories of

sensitive classified documents furnished to or generated by the

House Select Committee on Intelligence.

As to the first category, pursuant to your letter, the fon

loan" material which was loaned to the Select Cormittee by the

Executive branch has been received by the CIA and such material

has been returned to the originating departuents and agencies.

With regard to the second category of materials, the trans-

cripts of testimony taken fron surrent and forner federal officials

in executive sessions of the Select Comnittee, it is my understanding

that these documents will be placed in the National Archives building

for safekeeping in the custody of the Archivist of the United States,

and that no one is to be given access to these materials pending

further instructions from the House of Representatives or Speaker of

the House. As you indicated in your letter of February 20 to the

Archivist, highly sensitive classified information is contained in

these transcripts, and they should be treated accordingly by the

Archivist.

I am also concerned about any future plans for the dis-

position of these transcripts.

This material includes infornation

involving sensitive sources and methods which I ari charged by lar

to protect from unauthorized disclosure. I would, therefore,

appreciate it if you would bring this concern to the attention of

the Speaker of the House and request that I be involved in any

decision regarding the future disposition of this naterial.

Finally, with respect to the third category of materials re-

ceived by the CIA from the Select Committee for storage at CIA

Headquarters, we have attempted to reconcile our records of documents

delivered to the Select Cormittee with the inventory of documents

received for storage at CIA Headquarters, and we find that a number

or ClA documents are missing. • The materials transferred to CIA

Headquarters for storage were initially inventoried and sealed in

cartons by Executive branch representatives on the premises of the

Select Cormittee in the presence of Committee staff members during

the period of February 18-20. Because a number of documents were

unaccounted for, it was agreed with your staff representative that

certain cartons should be inventoried again to determine whether

the missing documents might be in those cartons. Thus, a thorough

second inventory of certain sealed cartons was conducted at CIA on

February 21 with your concurrence and in the presence of Ms. Jacqueline

Hess of the Select Conmittee staff.

While a few of the missing

documents were found in the second inventory, a number of documents

are still nissing.

As soon as a complete list of the missing materials is pre-

pared, my representatives will seek an early meeting with you to

determine that measures can be taken to account for or locate the

missing documents. Other Federal agencies are also checking their

records and inventories to determine whether any of their documents.

are missing.

The foregoing pertains only to the missing materials as we

have no way of accounting for the multiple copies of classified

documents reprocuced by the Select Comnittee staff from originals

made available by the CIA and other Executive departments and

agencies. To the extent that the multiple copies have not been

included in the materials to be stored at CIA or the National

Archives, I, trust that those documents have been destroyed in ac-

cordance with procedures appropriate for classified materials.

The following is a summary of the third category of material:

now held in sealed cartons at CIA Headquarters pending further in-

structions from the House of Representatives or the Speaker of the

House:
