The Honorable Otis Pike, Chaixman
Select Committee on Intelligence

' Washington, D. C..20515 2, eee

‘Dear Chairman Pikes ;

I ‘hereby ee “end accept the tems set “forth t in your
letter of February 20 for safekeeping of the three categories of |
‘sensitive classified documents fumished to or ‘camels : the /-

House. Select Committee on Intelligence. .

. “As to the first category, pursuant to ‘your oS the Ton’
joan" material which was loaned to the Select Comittee by ‘the

. Executive branch has been received by the CIA and such material
has been returned to the originating departments and agencies.

' |: With regard to the second category of materials, the trans- — :
cripts of testimony taken from current and former Federal, officials 5
in executive sessions of the Select Comittee, it is wy unders :

‘ that these documents will be placed in the National Archives building ~
for safekeeping in the custody of the Archivist of the United States,
and that no one is. to be given access to these materials pending . :

’ further instructions from the House of Representatives or Speaker of .-
the House. As you indicated in your letter of February 20 to the :

’ Archivist, highly sensitive classified information is contained in
these transcripts, and they should be treated accordingly by the
Archivist. I am also concerned about any future plans for the dis~* si
position of these transcripts, This material includes information -
involving sensitive sources and methods which I aji‘charged by law | ~
to protect from unauthorized disclosure.. I would, therefore, :

. appreciate it if you would bring this concern to the attention of
the Speaker of the House and request that I be involved in any ae
decision regarding the foture disposition of this naterial.

- °Finally, with respect to the third category of materials ree
ceived by the CIA from the Select Committee for storage at CIA aie
Headquarters, we baie attempted to reconcile our records of documents

gan edhe S16.
EUBLSSIS :



delivered to the Select Committee with the inventory documents
Teceived for storage at CIA Headquarters, and we find that a number
of CIA doaztents are missing. - The materials transterre 7
Headquarters for Storage were initially inventoried ‘sealed. in -
cartons by’ Executive branch representatives on the premises of the
Select Committee in the presence of Committee staff members during
_ the period of February 18-20. Because a number of documents were
"unaccounted for, it was agreed with your staff representative that
certain cartons should be inventoried again to determine whether
the missing doaments might be in those cartons, Thus, a thorough
second inventory of certain sealed cartons was, conducted at CIA on
’ February 21 with your concurrence and in the presence of Ms.’ Jacqueline
- Hess of the Select Committee staff.’ While a few of the missing
documents were found in the second inventory, a ee of documents _
are still missing. 2

As soon asa complete list of the missing materials is pre-
pared, -my representatives will seek an early meeting with you to
determine what measures can be taken to account for or locate the ©
missing documents. Other Federal agenties are also checking their
records and inventories to determine whether any of their Can

‘ate missing. 4 . he

. _: The foregoing pertains only to the missing naterials as we
- have no way of eccounting for. the multiple copies of classified
documents reprocuced by the Select Committee staff from originals
made available by the CIA and other Executive departments and
“| agencies. To the extent that ‘the multiple copies have not been
» ‘included in the materials to be stored at CIA or the National
. Archives, I, trust that those documents have been destroyed in ac-
cordance with procedures appropriate for classified: materials.”
