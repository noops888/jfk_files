4. KOVALEV is a graduate of the Minsk State Pedagogical
institute of Foreign Languages, where fhe studied: Spanish and English
ain the Department of Translating. After graduation, KOVALEV left
Minsk for one year to go.into the Army. However, Source found this
hard to believe, as he knew that KOVALEV had been turned down for
military service in-1966 because of nearsightedness. During the
time that KOVALEV was in the Army, his wife told Source that where
her husband was serving “they put army boots on once a month, just
for show.” KOVALEV's cilitary service card (voyennyy bilet)
nevertheless indicates both his 1966 rejection and the year that ‘he
supposedly spent in the Army.

1 The druzhin {s-a. group of civilfans who volunteer

tie druzhiny. originated spontaneous ly in. about-1962, they
wave since becom. official appendages of the militia. There
4s at least one. druzhina fn each factory» public. and commercial
enterprise, institute ‘and. technical. school. Although the
druzhina officers are supposedly elected, they actually are
appointed by tne administration at.the factory. A-duty ‘roster
ts posted, Almost everyone except the management has to be on
duty at one. time or another; no one. can refuse, It is very
nard to make people, especially the factory workers, roam the

streets on -druzhina duty after a day's work because they would
rather go ‘home. E

2. In the institutes, the druzit operate this way.
After lectures all the students of a particular department have
to. attend a compulsory meeting. Tne senior druzhinnik of the
institute fs in caarce of tae meeting, tocetaner with the. senior
druzhinnixt and deputies in the departments. Those students
who’ for some reason did not manage to escape this duty (using
a medical excuse, influgnce with the chief, or other means),
are then marched to the nearest druzhina post. There are dozens
of such posts in each rayon (precinct) of the militia, usually
in the basements of apartment houses. Usually there is an offi-
cer of tae militia taere, witu several militiamen of lower ranks.

SSR ve

Inforsers in the Belorussian

‘DATE OF INFORMATIO!
DATE“OF INTERVIEL

+, 2, Source*s curiosity. about .the selection and: recruitment: of.KGB
Personnel was ‘aroused when AKSENOV told him that he was considering
thé recruitment-of “Source as, a KGB:.informant:- -Source ‘asked: ~AKSENOYV.
who is selected and for what reasons. AKSENOV ‘replied that the :KGB
usually usés. spotters, who recommend people for. recruitment. ~Back-
ground is. important. A person froma peasant or worker's family is
considered a ‘better choice. and he mist either be’a quiet and colorless
type who blends into the circle of: people in which he operates, or
else. a conspicuous ‘Voudmouth: who asks embarrass.ing questions.. The
latter would be more likely. suspect of being a-member of the opposi-” -
tion rather than a X63 informant... The average informant.,: according ~
to AKSENOV, is not very bright because KGB officers themselves .aré
not. particularly intelligent and are afraid of anyone who .is smarter
than they. Source says-that.he was. never recruited.

3.: Both Source and-AKSENOV think that in the remote areas of the
USSR there are very few cases of such a recruitment pitch being
turned down. Far from the big cities the KGB. is an all-powerful
instrument: and anyone who refuses just to report on the conversations
of ‘his, friends.in the. name of patriotism will. end up with dismal

career prospects unless he has friends -in high places. However, it =r

is unlikely. that such a person would be chosen. for a KGB recruitment
pitch in-the first place. Therefore most of the lower levels of. the
KGB consist of people from simple backgrounds for whom there are no
other career prospects and who prefer this kind of service to being
in the Army.

4. The KGB officers inthe Belorussian SSR are also those who
are not bright enough to.make a career in some other field, such as.
science, engineering, or foreign languages, but they differ from
the lower-level cadres in that they are the sons ‘cf high-ranking

cused b: jn a.safe house. (konspirativnaya kvartiva).” Other

fiers are not supposed’ to know who these agents are, and this.”
onspiracy.”. is a matter .o eat pride to them. , Source was once
caught leaving the-hotel -room'of a Bulgarian ‘girl ‘with whom he had
spent the night, but -he.was released when hé gave AKSENOV's’ name to
the junior KGB officer om duty (thereby implying. that Source was on
assignment, for, AKSENOV). '

-6.. Source described KGB influence as "overwhelming". For example,
a Soviet going abroad on an official assignment cannot refuse. to
cooperate with the KGB. because such refusal would mean that. the
person wouldn't be able to travel, .as the KGB has:a say about his
final clearance. Source also gave.the example of an applicant for an
unimportant job with the Minsk Symphony who was originally turned
down. © But when..AKSENOV: spoke to the KGB officer responsible for the
Symphony,. the applicant was not ‘only hired ‘but received the greatest
respect from the Symphony Director during the entire period of his
employment.

7, The KGB likes to recruit retired military personnel (otstavniki)
because they-are considered politically reliable and patriotic.
Many otstavniki recruited. by the KGB are former Osobyy otdel (Special

Section, security functions) people, so KGB work is not a novelty for

them. Such retirees are frequently used in stationary positions,
reporting on or guarding specific areas.

8. Since the KGB relies on spotters for the selection of its
agents, the spotters themselves can get into trouble if they recommend
the "wrong" person.. This means’that the spotters are afraid to select
clever people, so insthe end they select mediocre ones. ‘Selection
is determined by the following: If the prospective agent or informer
is a kolkhoznik, he ‘is immediately 502% qualified. If he was in the
Army rticularly ir the Osobyy otdel, this adds another 30%. Other
qualifications are based on the person's being “quiet", “average”,
or “ordinary”.

n. PERSONAL ‘EVALUATION: UZLOV is a smart, witty, outgoing.”
aggressive person, accustomed to living by his wits. He #5 z
willing to take chances and-play roles, but, at ‘the same time,
he is not afraid of: hard work, as Tong as'it pays well... He is
somewhat. given to romanticizing, .for example, by’ seeking a job
in“intelligence and not fully realizing that it is a steady
and, often, -dull-job.. He is not. persistent, not able to stick
to his studies or hold a job; instead, he prefers to work hard
for shorter periods to earn money, and then do nothing.

UZLOV seemed to be completely won over by the United
States, saying that he is willing to do anything that would be
asked of him, such as his voluntarily bringing in photographs
of somé of the personalities he described, .and suggestina that
he would try to use.the loose code system that he had established
with his friends back in Minsk to obtain information for us,
if-we so require. At the last possible moment, he admitted
that he was incarcerated in the USSR for participation in a
fight, but was later found innocent by.a higher court.

Physically, UZLOV is good-looking, trim, athletic,
and is a former boxer, who trys. to keep himself in good shape.
He likes to dress well and, seemingly, -no longer drinks to
excess, as he used to do in the Soviet Union.

and militia officers. -AKSENOV-was at that time in charge of —

the KGB unit in: the Yub{leynaya Hotel, Minsk...

2. In‘each tourist hotel in Minsk: there is. a so-calléd
militia punkt (unit). ‘It-ts usually in a room on the first floor
of. the hotel somewhere off the lobby. Supposedly this is.a :
ct militia unit whose purpose is to.protect foreigners, maintain - :
: order in the hotel, and prevent black-marketing. Actually, this ee
unit is manned. by KGB representatives in militia uniforms who H
carry militia as well as KGB identificatfon, ‘The militia seems y &
to be the favorite cover for the KGB. ~ .

- mart : 3. -In the Yubileynaya Hotel this unit always had four or
five persons on duty. During the day it'had two privates and
a Sergeant in uniform and two officers in civilian attire. At
night, when on duty, all of them usually wore.militia uniforms.
Aside’ from the above-mentioned militia functions, their actual
mission was-to prevent what they considered to be unnecessary
contact of Soviet citizens: with foreigners, to observe any
suspicious actions by either, and to ensure that only approved.
persons. had access to. the hotel. All other Soviet :.citizens
would be stopped, their documents checked, and their business
questioned. An officer from such.a unit once stopped Source
after he had spent the night with a Bulgarian girl in the hotel.
Source thinks he was discovered through audio surveillance. see

6. In subsequent conversations, AKSENOV told Source that
all rooms occupied by foreigners are jistened to by a spot check
from-the time that the occupant enters his room. There is apparently
a-device which indicates when this occurs. The running of water
as an audio hindrance is a useless measure, AKSENOV said, as
KGB audio-technicians are able to eliminate this as well as many
other extraneous noises in order to make the conversations

audible.
