Re: Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board’s Requests for
Additional Information and Records

Dear John:

Iam writing to follow-up on our telephone call earlier today and to convey my serious
concern about the status of CIA’s responses to the Review Board’s requests for
additional information and records. Although CIA has completed its responses to
several requests, and many others have been answered in part, a significant number of
requests have not been answered — including some that were made more than two
years ago. On many occasions we have been assured that responses would be
forthcoming, only to have promised dates come and go without answers. It is now
extremely important that these requests be answered promptly so that we may conduct
a proper follow-up if necessary. The issues that we can now identify as being of the
highest priority are identified in the text below by double asterisks (**)' and we request
that they be answered within the next month. We request that the remaining requests
be answered by April-1, 1998.

The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts: first, a listing of the formal
requests for information and records, and second, a listing of the informal requests for
information and records. Please let me know if your understanding of any of the
following points differs from ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies.

‘As identified more fully below, the issues are: CIA-1 Organizational Material,
CIA-6 Cables and Dispatches, CIA-13 Backchannel Communications, CIA-IR-03
HTLINGUAL Documents, CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton Files, CLA-IR-07 Claude
Barnes Capehart, CIA-IR-15 Electronic “take” from Mexico City, CLA-IR-21 DRE
Monthly Operational Reports, CIA-IR-22 “A” Files on Clay Shaw and Jim Garrison.

CIA-IR-09 George Bush Computer Search.

The Review Board provided CIA with a copy of an FBI document, dated
November 29, 1963, prepared under the name of John Edgar Hoover, which
states: “The substance of the foregoing information [on the assassination of
President Kennedy] was orally furnished to Mr. George Bush of the Central
Intelligence Agency ....” We have been informed that the DO has no record of a
“George Bush” being in the employ of CIA in 1963 with the exception of

Mr. George William Bush who has already given a sworn affidavit that he is not
the “George Bush” in question. It is our understanding that the CIA has
confirmed that the search query included George Herbert Walker Bush prior to
1970. CIA should determine whether George Herbert Walker Bush is the person
to whom the memorandum refers and should provide a definitive statement
regarding the scope of its search and the basis of its conclusion. Any and all
personnel files of George Herbert Walker Bush should be reviewed to determine
whether he had any affiliation with CIA during the 1963 period. Once the formal
statement is provided, this request will be complete.

CIA-IR-10 IG Reports.

CIA will determine whether the IG’s office maintains an index or inventory of its
reports and determine whether the IG’s office prepared a report on the handling
of Oswald. Since April 1997, CIA has had no response and no time frame for a

response.

CIA-IR-11 Warren Commission Critics.

We are asking that CIA determine whether it possesses any files or records on
Warren Commission critics Edward J. Epstein, Josiah Thompson, Mark Lane,
Harold Weisberg, or Sylvia Meagher. The Review Board is not requesting
information per se regarding any FOIA requests by these individuals or any
Public Affairs news clippings? Since April 1997, CIA has had no response and
no time frame for a response.

5To the extent that CIA possesses FOIA files or records on any of these

individuals, and to the extent that those records contain information that was not filed
with the courts, such records are being requested for review by the Review Board.

Per page 6 of ARRB's 5 March 1998 memorandum (attached), on 25 March, | asked PIRD to conduct a search and advise as to what
FOIA/PA cases they received from anyone for records on the following individuals:

Edward J. Epstein

Harold Weisberg
‘Sylvia Meagher =

As a result of PIRD's search, they advised that there were two FBI referrals for records on Mark Lane (F-1993-01446 and
F-1994-02092). I have requested that these files be retrieved from the Records Center for our review. There is no record of requests
received specifically for information on Epstein, Thompson, Weisberg or Meagher.

However, the search revealed three requests that mentioned Epstein's name in the subject line. The requests have been destroyed in
accordance with records control schedule approved by NARA as noted below. | have provided the subject as identified on computer
printout provided by PIRD:

a. F-1980-00168 (The Secret World of Lee Harvey Oswald by Edward J. Epstein all info - Cancelled 9/8/1087 & subsequently
destroyed)

b. F-1981-00894 (Correspondence bewteen IPD & Anthony Summers and/or Edward Jay Epstein - destrayed 8/5/1985)

c. F-1988-01338 (George de Mohrenschildt betinindi released to Edward J. Epstein - destroyed 7/6/1993)

The search revéaled one request that mentioned Wisber iin the subject line. File destroyed as noted below. Once again, | have provided
subject as identified on computer printout.

a. F-1977-00383 (NIS referral - JFK and Oswald documents, 20 Oct 83 - this is identical to release made to Harold Weisberg also as
result of same NIS referral - destroyed 6/12/1997)

At your specific request, PIRD also conducted a search to determine what requests had been received FROM the individuals referred to
above on any subject. The results of their search revealed the following:

Edward J. Epstein - 10 FOIA requests received all of which have been destroyed in accordance with the records destruction schedule.
Josiah Thompson - no requests received
Mark Lane - 6 FOIA requests and 1 PA request (FBI REF) received. The records show that four of these requests have been destroyed
and that there is no data such as Job and Box number to indicate the

disposition of the remaining 3. However, | have been advised that since the remaining three are such old cases it is almost
certain that they have been destroyed as well. These three are identified below

Re: Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board’s Requests for
Additional Information and Records

Dear Barry:

lam writing to update the Review Board's understanding of the status of CLA’s
responses to our formal and informal requests for additional information and records
that have been requested pursuant to the Review Board's authority under Section
7(j)(1)(C)Gii)of the President John F: Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of
1992, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V 1994) (JFK Act).

We appreciate recent CIA efforts to respond to our outstanding requests. As we have
written in our formal requests and as we have said to you orally, you should interpret
our requests in the broadest reasonable sense. To the extent that you believe that a
request poses an unreasonable burden that we may not have anticipated, or to the
extent that you have suggestions to modify or to amend our requests in such a way as
to better reach our goals, you should not hesitate to make suggestions or seek
clarification. As has been noted in earlier letters, these requests will be incorporated
into the Agency’s final compliance declaration. In requesting these materials, we are
not designating them “assassination records” at this time and we are not requesting that
copies be given to the Review Board. All outstanding ARRB requests for additional
information, both formal and informal, are scheduled to be completed by April 1, 1998.
As noted in your meeting with Michelle Combs on February 27, 1998, we recognize that
some requests, such as C1A-7, are ongoing and will continue. In addition, the ARRB has
formulated some new requests, CLA-IR-34 and IR-35, which shouid be completed as
quickly as possible.

SUBJECT: DO Response to Informal Request CIA IR #11

REFERENCE: Informal Request from ARRB Staff Circa

Regarding “any files or records on Warren
Commission critics”

1. (U) This memorandum is in response to informal
request number 11 (CIA IR #11). from the staff of the
Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB). The staff has
requested “any files or records on Warren Commission critics
Edward J. Epstein, Josiah Thompson, Mark Lane, Harold
Weisberg, or Sylvia Meagher.”

**CIA-IR-11

2. (U) After a thorough search and review of the
7 Directorate of Operation’s records systems, the following
information has been compiled on the five individuals cited
in reference. At the direction of the ARRB staff, we did
not include material in response to FOIA requests or in
Public Affairs news clippings.

a. Edward J. EPSTEIN - The DO has no identifiable
information on subject. Our search did surface the
name Edward Epstein; however, by using additional
biographical data known about subject, we were able to
dismiss these names as false “hits.”

b. Josiah THOMPSON - Subject was of operational
interest to the DO circa 1962; therefore, a 201 file
does exist on this individual. The file can be made
available for review by an appropriate member of the
ARRB staff.

c. Mark LANE - Our search produced references to

two documents: (1) An Agency dispatch from¢Munich;

| Getmany ]dated 23 January 1970, and (2) An OGC letter
dated 29 March 1977. Both of these documents are
available for review. The OGC letter concerns a 1976
FOIA request -- Mark Lane was one of the individuals
requesting the FOIA action -- which involves two
dispatches dated 1967 and 1968. Because these two
documents are the subject of a FOIA request, they are
not included in this response.

d. Harold Weisberg - There is a 201 file on
subject which contains very limited information. This
file can be made available for review by an ARRB staff
member. The DO retired records system, CARD, has a
reference to an Agency dispatch (EGBA?}87605, 1969
which indicates subject was in correspondence with
Julius Mader. We have yet to locate a hard copy of
this document.

e. Sylvia Meagher - We found no DO information.

3. (U) In addition to the above records, our research
did surface a reference to a file titled “Garrison
Investigation of Kennedy Assassination” which was opened in
1969 and closed in 1996.

SUBJECT: Response to CIA-IR-11 5

1. The following is responsive to ARRB Request CIA-IR-
11, a request for files and records on Warren Commission
critics, Edward, J. Epstein, Mark Lane, Sylvia Meagher,
Josiah Thompson, and Harold Weisberg.

2. The Agency has made a thorough search of its files
systems in an attempt to find files on these individuals.
At the request of ARRB staff, it did not include material
found in news clippings or responses ‘to FOIA requests. All
files found have been reviewed, or made available for
review, by ARRB staff.

a. EPSTEIN, Edward J. --The DO found no files
identifiable with subject; a file was found on an individual
with the same name but, with research, it was determined
that the individual was not the Edward J. Epstein who is the
subject of this request. DA.searches found an Office of
Security file and a Publications Review Board file on
subject, as well as three “hits” to records destroyed
pursuant to normal records destruction schedules. The
destroyed records involved three Freedom of Information
requests that mention Epstein’s name in the subject line.
None of the requests were for information on Epstein

b. LANE, Mark -- The DO search produced references
to two documents (1) An Agency dispatch dated 23 January
1970 and (2) an OGC letter dated 29 March 1977. DA searches
revealed six FOIA requests and one Public Affairs requests
from subject; all records concerning these have been
destroyed. No other files were found. An additional
reference to Mark Lane was found in a document from a
foreign government; that information has been. processed for
release.

c. MEAGHER, Sylvia -- A reference to the fact
subject made a Privacy Act request was found. In addition,
the Office of Security found that it had, at one time, a
folder on subject and a 1968 Ramparts Magazine article.
Both subject’s Privacy Act request and the Office of
Security folder have been destroyed pursuant to normal
xecord control schedules.


13-00000

d. THOMPSON, Josiah -- The search revealed that
subject was of operational interest to the DO in 1962 and
there is a 201 file on him.

e. WEISBERG, Harold -- An OSS “Service History”
Form 1003a indicates subject worked for OSS from 15 January
to 30 September 1945, first as a consultant and then as a
research analyst. On the latter date he was transferred to
the State Department. The search turned up a thin 201 file
on subject and a reference to the fact he corresponded with
one “Julius Mader.“ A notation was found which stated that
additional information on subject was contained within file
100-300-017 entitled “Garrison Investigation of Kennedy
Assassination;” this file is in the JFK microfilm collection
at Reel 25, Box 25. An Office of Security file-was also
found. Lastly, the search revealed that subject has made
over forty FOIA requests to the Agency.

3. This completes CIA action on referent request. If
you have any questions, please call me.

1. Gordon Stewart, former Director of Personnel and
Inspector General, who retired circa 1971, telephoned the +> *.::.
undersigned at his residence on the evening of 23 September ~ ~
1977. -By way of background, Stewart, who was the IG in early
1968, was selected by the DCI to act in a "middle-man capacity"
in the controversy over the Nosenko case.: Nosenko had. become"
the responsibility of the Office of Security in October-1967
at the direction of the DCI and it had become quite apparent =:
that the Office-of Security viewpoint concerning Nosenko was
in conflict, if not. directly in opposition to the views. -
expressed by the Chief and Deputy Chiefs of both the SR Divi-
sion and the CI Staff. The above officials, respectively, ~
were David Murphy, H.-Tennent Bagley: (Pete Bagley), donee ove
Angleton and Raymond Rocca.

2. Stewart advised the, undersigned that an Edward .
Epstein is writing a book on the Kennedy assassination.
Stewart inquired as to whether the undersigned was willing
to be interviewed concerning an area in which the undersigned
had particular knowledge (it was clear to the undersigned
that the reference was to Nosenko although name not mentioned).
The undersigned told Stewart that he was still employed by the »
Agency but, in any event, had no interest in contact with any
reporter. Stewart indicated that he understood the attitude
of the undersigned and that it was not entirely unexpected.

The undersigned is of the opinion that Stewart was only relaying
a request or inquiry from Epstein who must have the nane of

in addition to Stewart, has interviewed the following:

James Angleton Bug a

Raymond Rocca : :
‘Pete Bagley

Donald Jamison

(Stewart did not know if Epstein has contacted David Murphy.)
4. In-view of the individuals interviewed by Epstein,

Epstein. é :

6. Edward Epstein is undoubtedly identical -to Edward ‘Jay
Epstein (OS #488 768}. There is no indication that Epstein
has ever been used in any way by the Agency. The security file
was initiated in 1966 because of his authorship of articles
on the Warren Commission. Stewart remarked that he ‘did not

: believe Epstein, in his book, would materially disagree with

the finding of the Warren Commission. This opinion may.not
be correct since Epstein has been quite critical of the Warren
Commission and supportive to the "more than one assassin!"+!::.

From: Michelle Combs Bitte OnrLo— ;

Associate Director for Research and Review

Subject: CIA-IR-11 Warren Commission Critics

In an effort to determine whether the CIA opened or maintained files on Warren
Commission critics because they criticized the Warren Commission’s work and
findings, the Review Board requested access to all extant records on Edward J. Epstein,
Josiah Thompson, Mark Lane, Harold Weisberg, or Sylvia Meagher. The Review Board
did not request information per se on Freedom of Information Act requests by these
individuals or any Public Affairs news clippings.

In response to the Review Board’s Informal Request for Additional Records and
Information CIA-IR-16, the CIA provided the following files or information on the
requested individuals. Each file was examined by the Review Board staff and relevant
records were designated as assassination records for inclusion in the JFK Collection at.
the National Archives.

Edward J. Epstein: CIA located an Office of Security file and a Publications
Review Board file on Epstein as well as three indications of records destroyed under a
standard records destruction schedule. The destroyed records involved three Freedom
of Information Act requests. None of the requests were for information on Epstein. The
Review Board staff did not designate any additional records as assassination records.

Josiah Thompson: The CIA has a small 201 file on Thompson which indicates
that he was considered to be of possible operational interest to the Agency in 1962 while
he was living overseas. Interest was dropped, however, and Thompson never worked
for the CIA in any capacity. The Review Board staff did not designate any additional
records as assassination records.


J

Mark Lane: The CIA did not open a 201 file on Lane. The Agency's records on
Lane consist of: a dispatch dated January 23, 1970, an Office of the General Counsel
letter dated March 29, 1977, six Freedom of Information Act requests, and one Public
Affairs request. These documents were not designated as assassination records. An
additional reference to Lane was found in a document from a foreign government. That
information was designated an assassination record and has been processed for release
to the JFK Collection at the National Archives. .

Harold Weisberg: CIA holds several files on Weisberg. An Office of Strategic
Services (OSS) history form 1003a indicates that he served in the OSS from January 15 to
September 30, 1945, first as a consultant and then as a research analyst, until he
transferred to the Department of State. CIA also holds an eight-page 201 file which
contains newspaper articles, one reference to the Garrison investigation, a reference to
the fact that Weisberg corresponded with “Julius Mader,” and administration
documents. . This file is a part of the CIA sequestered collection and has been processed
for release to the JFK Collection at the National Archives. An Office of Security file on
Weisberg was reviewed by the Review Board staff and a small number of documents
were marked as assassination records. Finally, Agency records show Weisberg has
made more than 40 Freedom of Information Act requests.

Sylvia Meagher: CIA no longer has any records on Meagher: At one time the
Office of Security had a file on Meagher and a 1968 Ramparts Magazine article. A
reference to a Privacy Act request made by Meagher was also found. The Privacy Act
request and the Office of Security folder have been destroyed under normal record
control schedules.
