1. ‘Subject has been employed by this Mission for approximately tvo months
@s 8 member of the LIPSTICK team and prior to that he has been Inovn to
‘the undersigned for about one year,. During that time he has impressed all
those who have dealt with him as @ conscientious, devoted and hardvorking
individual, Those most intimately associated with him(Chester D. POLLICOVE
and tho undersigned) consiter him nost dependable ard deserving of addi- * =
tional responsibility. He has shown great initiative and application in 4%
his duties with the LIPSTICK team,

2. He will graduate from a local college the beginning of June 1955 and

4s considoring accepting employment with a PBPRIME firm in Mexico City.

” Asall young men vio have just graduated from college, he is looking for .

employment with a future and with sone degree of security. He. has indi- .

coated his desire of working for KUBARK on a full-time besis end it is
thie Mission's desire to so employ him, It is presontly contemplated
that he will assume the duties of Jeromo K, NASHWDITER in charge of the
LIPSTICK team, working in association with LIFSTICK-19, Chester D. FOLLI= ©

for the solution of leads which the surveillance produce, ,

3. As has been stated in paragraph 2 above, he is desirous of accepting

@ job that bas a future. Although he could be retained on LIPSTICK as an
agent on a full-time basis, this-vould not satisfy his ambition for. secure
employment with a future. It 4s therefore requested: that Headquarters

write a contract for LIPSTICE-20 similar to that of David M, WILSTE)'s -
present contract at the equivalent salary of a GS-7 with the usual overtine .
provision that is included in WILSTED's contract, In order to provide for -

fron college and the time that his contract 4s ready, it de requested

that this Mission te-authorized by cable to Place the subject on a Y
full-tine salary tasta under the LIPSTICK project at 2,000 Mexican pesos

Per month or $160,00 U.S, :

4. | Generally. ths following duties are contemplated for LIPSTICK-20 for
full tine employnts (1) he will be given credentials in a local police
service, and togsthar with LIPSTICK-19 and others, msintain the investi-
gativo office of the LIPSTICK teams (2):he will be able to backstop the
team with these credontials and engage in Ainvostigative work to solve the
many loads that ths survetilances produce; (3) ho will prepare rouah
reports based upon the LIPSTICK surveillances; (4) he will provide a tele-
Phone central part of the day to which the LIPSTICK team will be able to
are nreir Position in codes (5) ho may, at come future date, be used aa

same future date, ba used on other operational duties in a siniler manner
Se other contract arents are erployed at this Misaion tut only after he
has proven hinself and Headquarters concurrence has been obtained,

5. As an assistance to Headquarters in the granting. of contract atatua . '
to LIPSTICK-20, there is being forwarded by separate cover a Tevised™ PRQ,
Pert I, which was conpleted.by LIPSTICK-20, This PRQ is considerably more
complete than the initial. PRQ which was submitted to Headquarters based

@nswers to Questions 10 and 26 wherein reference is nade to the feaily :
dairy business, Th PRQ subnitted as a separate cover attachment to. bow
this dispatch correctly reflects the correct ansvers to those questions, ‘

6. It 4s realized that Reference B does not @pply to individuals in

the Subject's position since he is not a citizen of FBPRIME,. However,
this individual does satisfy the other requirements of Reference B, i.e.,
Jangunge ability, aroa knovledge and natural cover potential, It ie
belleved that, if riven a contract, LIPSTICK-20 vil? be willing. to work
on @ career basis for KUBARK and will £112 a very great need of this |
Mission. Indigenous agents of his education, social status, intelligence
and ability are not frequently tobe found. Therefore his addition to the
staff of the Mission as a contract agent is recommended. 2
