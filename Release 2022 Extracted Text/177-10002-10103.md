THE PRESIDENT’S
INTELLIGENCE CHECKLIST

ISSUED BY THE
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

23 NOVEMBER 1963
TOP SECRET


1.

South Vietnam

a. Vietnamese Communist ef-
forts. to discredit the new Saigon
regime stayed in high gear this
week,

b. The number of armed attacks
was off from the high of the previous
week but still some 50% above the
year's weekly average.

c. These attacks have been,
for the most part, small-scale efforts
directed against the government's
paramilitary forces in the villages.
They have been designed more for
their psychological impact than for
immediate military gain.

e. The new government is re-
sponding by stepping up its own
military operations. It is also
setting about the hard job of re-
vamping the Diem government .apparatus
and harnessing broader popular sup-
port for the war effort,

£. The generals have been
dealing fairly effectively with

their new responsibilities. There
are, however, a few signs of dissen-
sion within this group and between
it and civilian politicians.

h, The new regime has also
embarked on a purge of high military
officers who sided with Diem during
the Buddhist crisis.and failed to
get on the right side soon enough.

a. The death toll from the
terrorist outburst in Caracas last
Tuesday and Wednesday now stands at
about 30,

b. This is the high water mark
thus far in the campaign of the
Castro-supported Communist extremists
to disrupt the national elections a
week from tomorrow.

c. The Betancourt government
has struck back hard. Its new uni-
fied command over the security forces,

passed this
initial test with flying colors.

d. At least 500 extremists
were arrested and the round-up is
still going on. Their removal will
hamper the Communist drive against
elections in major cities like Caracas.

e. We now expect the elections
to be held on schedule, a consider-
able achievement under the circum-
stances, The elections will be fol-
lowed, however, by a Communist ef-
fort to prevent the March inaugura-—
tion of the victor.

£. The rub here is that none
of the presidential candidates com-
mands President Betancourt's con~
siderable assets for dealing success-
fully with the harsh realities of
Venezuelan politics. The constitu-
tion prevents Betancourt from suc-
ceeding himself.

g. In the background, as
always, looms the military, which
could intervene if the president-
elect shows signs of being soft on
communism,

3.

USSR-Cuba

\Cuban interpreters are now
posted at several surface-to-air mis-
sile (SAM) sites on the island.

b. We think this means that
on-site training of Cubans has begun
on schedule, Field training is to
last six months, after which the
SAM system may be_turned over to
Castro.

c. In the past month some
1,500 Soviets arrived in Cuba, Most
of these were probably SAM experts,
sent to monitor the training.

f. All Soviet weapons intro-

withdrawn or turned over to the
Cubans. The only significant excep-

tion is the SAM —

4. Berlin

¢. Moscow has tried on a num-
ber of past occasions to assert its
right to restrict Allied use of the
air corridors. In early 1962, the
Soviets attempted to'reserve "blocks"
of air space for their own use. They
have since demanded that Western
flights stay between stipulated al-
titudes, that we file flight plans
in advance and provide prior notice
of border-crossing times.

5.

Iraq-Syria-
UAR

d. This sort of harassment
stopped in the spring of 1962 when
Soviet leaders became convinced
that the US was interested in a
serious discussion of a Berlin settle-
ment. Moscow may hope that the
threat of more of this sort of har-
assment will jog the US into talks
on Berlin.

a. It now appears that Presi-
dent Arif's role in last Monday's
coup in Baghdad may have been vir-
tually that of a bystander.

c. Whatever Arif's role may
have been, the coup was primarily
an effort by the Iraqi Army to cur-
tail the activities of the extreme
wing of the Baath Party. The Baath
is an Arab nationalist political or-
ganization, active throughout the
Arab world, which has been ruling
Iraq and Syria.

dad. The coup group has not
thrown all Baathists out of the
government; there are party members
in the new cabinet,

e. Syrian Baathists have wel-
comed this retention of their Iraqi
brothers. Their attitude springs
from the recognition that the Baath
in Syria cannot stay afloat without
Support from Iraq. |

f£. The reaction of Nasir's
Egypt, which passionately desires
to see the Baath go under, has been
exactly the opposite. Cairo has been
backing off its all-out support for
the coup ever since the new cabinet

was announced,
