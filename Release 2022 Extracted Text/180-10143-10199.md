O memo fur the record

A9:0 Am papien called y and stated that he

wanted to besure we didnot have any additional

information concerning Ruby.

"I adulsed him that we

had checked our records, including fru's, and on the badis

of the information we had concerning subject which had been

provided by him (ay Nouember) we have no

information relating to him."

A 9:20 Papun calledugain & said after search

..at FB.I.

"there was no indication that he has been

out of the united states or that he

is a member of

any particular political or subuersive group. He stated

that there was a some indication that he may have

been in.Cuba in 1959 while westill had an Embassy

there, and there was some information that he allegedly

visited a night club. Mr. Papish

puinted out, however,

that this would have been entirely consistent with his

known actruities in the night club business, He said

that the possibility of his being in cuba should be

considered with a "big question mark."

"I reminded Papien that we had checked through the

Immigration eat Service on the tourist card record

in the mexican Immigration in Neuvo Lorado and

That we had had a response that they were i'

unable to develop any information concerning his

departure on de ab september and re-entry on 3 October.
