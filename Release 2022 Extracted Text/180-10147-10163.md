further efforts by the Warren Commission to investigate
this matter.

The Committee sought to resolve the issue of Oswald's
alleged association with the CIA by conducting an inquiry
that went beyond the threshold level of obtaining statements
from two of the Agency's most senior officials. Instead,

a more analytical investigative approach was utilized.
First, an effort was made to identify circumstances either
in Oswald's life or in the manner in which his case was
handled by the CIA which were potentially suggestive of an
intelligence association of -some kind. Then, an intensive
file review was undertaken which included both the CIA's
144-volume Oswald file and hundreds of others from the CIA,
as well as the FBI, State Department, and the Department of

Defense. _/ Based upon these file _reviews, a series poet

Finally, taken~in their entirety, the items of circumstantial
evidence that the Committee had selected for investigation
as possibly indicative of an intelligence association did
not support the allegation that Oswald had an intelligence

SUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE

1. CIA Personnel in the Soviet Russia Division

{ In addition to obtaining testimony from former
1
?
directors John H. McCone and Richard M. Helms, the
3 Committee interviewed individuals who were chiefs of the

CIA's Soviet Russia division during 1959-1963.* These

individuals categorically denied that Oswald had. ever

j been associated in any capacity with the CIA.

To investigate this matter further, the persons who

had been chiefs and/or deputy chiefs during 1959-62 of the

three units within the Soviet Russia division which were

responsible respectively for clandestine activities,

clandestine activities.* The heads of the clandestine
activity section stated during this period the CIA had

very few operatives in the Soviet Union and that Oswald

was not one of them. Moreover, they stated that because of
his obvious instability, Oswald would never have met the

Agency's ‘standards for use in the field.** The heads of the

*For the unit that was responsible for American legal
travelers, only the years 1959-61 were covered. However,
since every American legal traveler who was involved in this
program was recruited before his’ trip to the Soviet Union,
the relevant year for Lee Harvey Oswald was 1959 because that
is when he departed from the United States.

**One officer acknowledges the remote possibility that an
individual could be run by someone as part of a. "vest pocket"
operation without other Agency officials knowing about it, but
even this possibility, as it applies to Oswald, was negated by
the statement of the deputy chief of the Soviet Russia
clandestine activities section who commented that in 1963 he we
involved in a review of every clandestine operation ever run
in the Soviet Union, and that Oswald was not involved in
any of. these cases. 2

Wilcott told the Committee that on the day after President

Kennedy's assassination, he was informed by a CIA case
officer that Lee Harvey Oswald was a CIA agent. Wilcott

Oswald's Agency relationship, he named several employees

3. Lee Harvey Oswald's CIA File

The CIA has long acknowledged that, prior to the
President's assassination, it had a personality file on
Lee Harvey Oswald. This file, which in Agency terminology
is referred to as a 201 file, was opened on December 9, 1960.
The Agency has explained to the Committee that 201 files are
opened when a person is considered to be of potential
intelligence or counterintelligence significance. The
opening of such a file is designed to serve the purpose of
bringing all of the CIA's information pertaining to that

For example, the Oswald file was purportedly opened
because he was considered to be a potential counterintelligence
threat. Oswald's file contained absolutely no indication that
he had ever had any relationship with the CIA. Nevertheless,

(in an unrelated case) where an Agency officer had apparently
contemplated the use of faked files with forged documents, _/

October 31, 1959 cable was sufficiently important to warrant
the opening of a 201 file. In fact, however, Oswald's file
was not opened until December 9, 1960.

The CIA was requested by the Committee to indicate
where documents pertaining to Oswald had been disseminated
internally and stored prior to the opening of his 201 file.
In response, the Agency advised the Committee that because
document dissemination records of low national security
significance are retained for only a five-year period, they
are no longer in existence pp the years 1959-1963. _ //
Consequently, the Agency was unable to explain either when

these documents had been received or by which component.

and determined that the files for each of the five (including

Oswald) who did not have Agency (201) files prior to the

December 1960. In each case, the slot for “source document"

Even so, this analysis only explains why a file on
Oswald was finally opened; standing alone it does nét explain
the seemingly long delay in the opening of the file. To
determine whether such a delayed opening was necessarily
unusual, the Committee reviewed the files of 13 of the 14
persons on the CIA's Novenber 21, 1960 response to the State
Department and of 16 other defectors (from an original list

of 380) who were American born, had defected during the

His recollection was that at the time of the
assassination the “AG" code was not yet in existence because
there were no provisions then in effect within the Agency for
the indexing of American defectors. He recalled that it was
only during the life of the Warren Commission that the CIA
realized that its records system lacked provisions. for
indexing an individual such as Oswald. Consequently, the
CIA then revised its Ee eee to include authorization
for indexing American defectors and established a-code for

its computer system to be used for the category of "American

defectors." Although this individual did not know when the

The form that was used to initiate the opening of Lee

Harvey Oswald's 201 file contains a notation indicating that
ene file.was to be "restricted." This indication was
considered potentially significant because of the CIA's
practice of restricting agents' files to persons on a "need

to know" basis.

Further investigation, however, revealed that restricting
access to a file was not necessarily indicative of any relation-
ship with the CIA.

The individual who lei placed the restriction on
Oswald's file testified that this was done simply to allow
her to remain aware of any developments that might have

occurréd with regard to the file. This purpose was achieved

This testimony was confirmed by a CIA records expert

H who further testified that, had the file been permanently

with the CIA would have been greater. There was no indication

on Oswald's form that it had been placed on permanent change.

e) Were 37.documents missing from Lee Harvey Oswald's

In the course of reviewing Lee Harvey Oswald's 201 file,
the Committee discovered an unsigned memorandum to the Chief
of Counterintelligence, Research and Analysis, dated
20 February 1964, which stated that 37 documents were missing
from Oswald's 201 file. According to the memorandum, this
statement was based upon a comparison of a machine listing
of documents officially recorded as.being in the 201 file and
those documents actually physically available in the file.
While the memorandum mentionéd that such a machine listing was
attached, no such attachment was found in the 201 file at
the time of the, Committee's review. The memorandum itself

bears the classification "SECRET EYES ONLY," and is one of the

Freedom of Information review.
In response to a Committee inquiry, the CIA advised

that because Oswald's file was so active during the course of

‘

the Warren Commission investigation, up-to-date machine listings
were produced periodically. On this basis, the Agency stated
that “it must be assumed that whoever was responsible for
maintaining the Oswald file brought thie file up-to-date by

locating the 37 documents and placing them in the file."

Because this: response was incomplete, the author of
this memorandum was deposed. He testified that once a
document had been registered into a 201 file by the Agency's
computer system, physical placement of the document in the
file was not always necessary. On this basis, he explained

that the items listed in the memorandum were not missing but

HT-Lingual project. The latter explained that "RE" represented

Another employee testified that the “Watch-List" notation on

the second card referred to a list of persons who had

been identified as being of particular interest in the Agency

The Committee requested the CIA to ‘provide an
explanation for the terms "CI/Project/RE," and. "Watch List,"
and for the significance of the handwritten notations appearing
on the index cards. In addition, the Committee requested a

description of criteria utilized in compiling a "watch list."

In regard to the meaning of the notation "CI/Project/RE,”
the CIA explained that there existed an office within the
.Counterintelligence staff that was known as "CI/Praoject," a
cover title that had been used to hide the true nature of the
office's functions. In fact, this office was responsible for
the exploitation of the material produced by the HT-Lingual
project. The response further explains that "RE" represents

F approximately 300 names, including about 100 furnished
by the FBI. The Watch List included the names of

9 November 1959, RE placed Oswald's name on the “Watch List"

that Oswald was-a recent defector to the USSR and a former

The response goes on to state that the handwritten

reference to the communication from the CI Staff to the Office
of Security expressing the former's interest in seeing any

Oswald's name be placed on the "Watch List" because of

29 June 1965 after she remarried. Both names were deleted

Thus, the statements of former’ CIA employees were

4. Did the CIA: ever debrief Lee Harvey Oswald?

The CIA has denied ever having had any contact with
Lee Harvey Oswald, and its records are consistent with this
position. Because the Agency has a Domestic Contacts Division
which routinely attempts to solicit information on a
nonclandestine basis from Americans traveling abroad, the
absence of any record indicating that Lee Harvey Oswald, a
returning defector who had worked in a Minsk radio factory,
had not been debriefed fas een considered by Warren Commission
critics to be either inherently noncredible (i.e., the
record ‘has been destroyed) or indicative that Oswald had been
contacted through other than routine Domestic Contact Division
channels.

issue, the Committee's. initial point of inquiry was to interview

and therefore the. absence of a debriefing was not at all
unusual.

The Committee interviewed five other Agency employees
who were in a position to have discussed Oswald in 1962 with
the author of this memorandum, including the person who
replaced the author of the memorandum as chief of the research

The author of the November 25, 1963 memorandum also
informed the Committee that the CIA maintained a large
volume of information on the Minsk radio factory in which
Oswald worked. This information was stored in the Office of
Research and Reporting. __/ Another former CIA employee, who

Committee that he specifically recalled collecting intelligence

claims that during the summer of 1962 he reviewed a contact
report from representatives of the CIA's New York field office

who had interviewed a former Marine who had worked at the Minsk

Radio Plant following his defection to the USSR. This defector,

the Agency relied upon the FBI both to make such contacts and

report any significant results.

To investigate this question further, the Committee
reviewed the files of 22 individuals (selected from an original
list of 380 possible Soviet defectors) who were born in America
and appeared to have returned to the United States between
1958 and 1963.* Of these 22 individuals, only four were
interviewed at any time by the CIA. These four instances
tended to involve particular intelligence or counterintelligence
needs, but this was not always the case.

Based upon this file review, it appears that, in fact,

the CIA did not contact returning defectors in 1962 as a matter

to the Soviet Union. /. In a subséquent response, the

Department acknowledged the existence of some evidence that
Oswald had offered information to the Soviet Union, but
stated that there were, nevertheless, serious obstacles to a
possible prosecution:

It (Department file) does contain a copy of
an FBI memorandum, dated July 3, 1961, which
is recorded as having been received in the
Justice Department's Internal Security
Division on December 10, 1963, which states
that the files of the Office of Naval
Intelligence contained a copy of a Department
of State telegram, dated October 31, 1959,

at Moscow. The telegram, which is summarized
in the FBI report, quoted Oswald as having
offered the Soviets any information he had
acquired as a radar operator. The FBI report
did not indicate that the information to
which Oswald had access as a radar operator
was classified.

Oswald returned to the United States on

June 13, 1962. He-was interviewed by the

FBI on June 26, 1962, at Fort Worth,

Texas, at which time he denied furnishing

any information to the Soviets concerning

his Marine Corps experiences. He stated

that he never gave the Soviets any information
which would be used to the detriment of the
United States.

.In sum, therefore, the only "evidence"
that Oswald ever offered to furnish
information to the Soviets is his own
reported statement to’ an official at the

of course, was contradicted by his denial
to the FBI, upon his return to the United

In the prosecution of a criminal case, the
Government cannot establish a prima facie

defendant's statement. See, Opper v.

United States, 348 U.S. 84 (1954).

Accordingly, in the absence of any information

statement that he had proferred information of any

kind to the Russians, we did not consider his
prosecution for violation of the espionage statutes,

In response to a Committee inquiry, the CIA indicated
that the DCI statement presumably refers to comments which
former DCI Richard Helms had made. in 1964 concerning the
Oswald case when Helms had been Deputy Director: for Plans.*

The CIA also stated that Snyder's file had been flagged at the

Snyder would be referred to that office. The Agency was unable
to explain the reference to "cover" because according to its

The Committee does not regard this explanation as

for approximately one year during 1956-1957 he was used by an
Agency case officer as a spotter at Harvard University because
of his access to other students who might be going to the

specifically why someone considered it necessary to red

consistent with his Sree before the Committee concerning
the absence of Agency contacts. In addition, the CIA

George deMohrenschildt was a prominent member of Dallas'
White Russian" community who befriended Lee Harvey Oswald.
This friendship has engendered considerable speculation
because of the contrast between the backgrounds of the two men.
DeMohrenschildt was described as sophisticated and well educated,
one who moved easily in the social and professional circles
of oilmen and the so-called "White Russian" community, many
of. whom were avowed right-wingers. Oswald's “lowly" background
did not include much education or influence, and he was, in fact,
shunned by the very same Dallas Russian community which
embraced detiohrenschilat. DeMohrenschildt committed suicide
in 1977 shortly after having been contacted for an interview

by a Committee investigator.

In his Warren Commission testimony, deMohrenschildt

apparent speed with which Oswald's Soviet visa was issued.

Rankin noted that he had recently spoken with Abraham Chayes

of the State Department who contended that at the time

Oswald received his visa to enter Russia from the Soviet

Embassy in Helsinki, at least one week ordinarily passed

between the time of a tourist's application for a visa and

the issuance of the visa. Rankin contended that if Chayés'

assessment was accurate, then Oswald's ability to obtain

his tourist visa in two days-might have been very significant.
The CIA responded to Rankin's request for -information

on July 31, 1964. Richard Helms wrote to Rankin that. the Soviet

Consulate in Helsinki was. able to issue a transit visa (valid

for 24 hours) to U.S. businessmen within five minutes, but

Soviet Intourist. A second communciation from Helms to

Rankin, dated September 14, 1964, added that during the 1964

tourist season, Soviet Consulates in at least some Western

European cities issued Soviet tourist visas in from five to

seven days.

In an effort to resolve this issue, the Committee has

: reviewed the CIA file on Gregory Golub, who was the Soviet
Consul in Helsinki when Oswald. was issued his tourist’ visa.
Golub's file reveals that, in addition to his Consular
activities, he was suspected to have been an officer
of the Soviet KGB.

Two CIA dispatches from Helsinki concerning Golub
are of particular significance with regard to the time

necessary for issuance of visas to Americans for ttavel into
the Soviet Union. The first dispatch records that Golub
disclosed during a luncheon conversation that:

Moscow had given him the authority to give
Americans visas without prior approval from
Moscow. He (Golub) stated that this would
make his job much easier, and as long as

he was convinced the American was “all right"
he could give him a visa in a matter of
minutes... (emphasis added)

The second CIA dispatch, dated October 9, 1959, one
day prior to Oswald's arrival in Helsinki, illustrates that
Golub did have: the authority to issue visas without delay.
The dispatch discusses a telephone contact between Golub
and his consular counterpart ‘at the American Embassy ‘in

Helsinki:

their visas...* (emphasis added)

Thus, based upon: these two factors: (1) Golub's

authority to issue visas to Americans without prior approval

from Moscow, and (2) .a demonstration of this authority, as
reported in a CIA dispatch approximately one month prior
to Oswald's appearance at the Soviet Embassy, the Committee

has found that the available evidence tends to support the

10. The Oswald Photograph in the Office of Naval

Intelligence Files

The Office of Naval Intelligence's Lee Harvey Oswald
file contained a photograph of Oswald, taken at the
approximate time of his Marine Corps induction, that was
contained in an envelope which had on it the language
“REC'D 14 November 1963" and "CIA 77978." These markings
raised the possibility that Oswald had been in some way
associated,with the CIA.

In response to a Committee inquiry, the Department of
Defense stated that the photograph had been obtained by

ONI as a result of a CIA request for two copies of the most

recent photographs of Oswald so that an attempt could be made

copies, however, were not made available to the CIA until
aiter the President's assassination. Because of the absence
of documentation, no explanation was given for how or when the
Office of Naval Intelligence received this. particular
photograph of Oswald.

The Committee's review of CIA cable traffic confirmed

that cable number 77978, dated October 24, 1963, was in’
fact a request for two copies of the Department of the Navy's
most recent photograph of Lee Henry (sic) Oswald. Moreover,
review of other cable traffic corroborated the Agency's desire
to determine whether Lee Harvey Oswald had, in fact, been

a relationship between him and the CIA. This aspect of the
Committee's investigation involved a complete review both of
alleged Oswald associates and of various CIA operations outside
of the United States.

The Committee found no evidence suggestive of any
relationship between Oswald and the CIA. Moreover, the
Agency's investigative efforts, prior to thé assassination,
regarding Oswald's presence-in Mexico City served to confirm
the absence of any relationship with him. specifically, when
apprised of his possible presence in Mexico City, the Agency

potentially interested federal agencies of his possible
contact with the Soviet embassy in Mexico City. Finally,

the overt nature and frequency of Oswald's contacts with

the Cuban and Soviet Consulates (i.é., a total of at least five

visits) also tended to indicate that Oswald was not under the

direction of any professional intelligence officers.

wa of allegations that he had received intelligence training
| and had participated in intelligence operations during his
.term of service. Particular attention was given to the
charges that Oswald's early-discharge from the Marine Corps
was designed to serve as a cover for an intelligence
assignment and that his records reflected neither his true
security clearance nor a substantial period of service in

Taiwan. These allegations were considered relevant to the

question of whether Oswald had been performing intelligence
assignments for military intelligence as well as to the
issue of Oswald's possible association with the CIA.
Oswald's Marine Corps records bore no indication that
he had ever received any intelligence training or performed
on any intelligence assignments during his term of service.
As a Marine sering in Atsugi, Japan, Oswald had a security
clearance of confidential and never received a higher classifi-
cation. Based upon the Warren Commission testimony of John
E. Donavan, the officer who had been in charge of Oswald's
crew, that all personnel working in the radar center were
required to have a minimum security clearance of secret, the
allegation has been made that the security clearance of

Oswald's military records also dispelled the allegation
that he had served for a substantial period in Taiwan. ‘These
records state that Oswald served in Japan from September 12,
1957 until November 2, 1958. Department of Defense records,

however, do indicate that MAG (Mariné Air Group) 11, Oswald's uni

part of a rear echelon. Crete e records also state that on
October 6, 1958 he was transferred within MAG 11 to a

Japan. The next week he reportedly spent in the Atsugi

for duty in tidigaiees States.

Accordingly,. there is no indication in Oswald's
military records that he had spent any time in Taiwan. This
finding is contrary to that of the Warren Commission that
Oswald arrived with his unit in Taiwan on September 30, 1958, _/
but the Commission's analysis apparently was made without access
to the unit diaries of MAG 11.*

Finally, with one exception, the circumstances surrounding
Oswald's rapid discharge from the military do not appear to have
been unusual. Oswald was obligated to service on active duty

until December 7, 1959, but he applied for. a hardship discharge

on August 17, 1958 and two weeks later the application -

of Naval Operations concerning Oswald, which states that he
had “served with Marine Air Control Squadrons in Japan and
Taiwan" may have been issued without checking unit diaries

application was processed so expeditiously because it was
accompanied with all of the necessary documentation.

In response to a Committee inquiry, the Department
of Defense has stated that "to a large extent, the time
involved in processing depended on how well the individual
member had. prepared the documentation needed for consideration
of his or her case." __/ A review of Oswald's case indicates
that his initial application was accompanied by all of the
requisite documentation. Oswald had met the preliminary
requirements of having made~a voluntary contribution to the

hardship dependent and of applying for a dependent's quarters

*By September 4, 1959, Oswald had been informed that he would be
discharged on September 11, 1959. This explains why he was
able ‘to tell passport officials on that day that he expected
to depart the United States on September 21, 1959.

that these measures had been taken, and was accompanied by
two letters and two affidavits attesting to Marguerite

Documents provided to the Committee by the American Red

matter, and therefore was probably well advised on the requisite
documentation to support his claim. Indeed, Red Cross officials
interviewed Marguerite Oswald, and concluded that she "could

suggested the ékistence of a Military Intelligence file on
Oswald, and raised the possibility that he had intelligence
associations of some kind. The Committee's investigation,
however, revealed that military intelligence officials had
opened a file on Oswald because he was perceived as a possible
counterintelligence threat.

Robert E. Jones testified before the Committee that in
June of 1963 he had been serving as Operations Officer of the
112th Military Intelligence Group at Fort Sam Houston, Texas.*
Under the Group's control were seven regions encompassing five
states: Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma.

provided to the 112th MIG by the New Orleans. Police Department
to the effect that Oswald had been arrested there in connection
with Fair Play for Cuba Committee activities. As a result of
this information, the 112th Military Intelligence Group took

an interest in Oswald as a possible counterintelligence

threat. The Group collected information from local agencies
and the military central records facility, and opened a file
under the names Lee Harvey Oswald and A. J. Hidell. Placed

in this file were documents and newspaper articles on such
topics as Oswald's defection to the Soviet Union, his travels

there, his marriage to a Russian national, his return to the

United-States, and his pro-Cuba activities in New Orleans.

Jones rélated that on November 22, 1963, while in his
quarters at Fort Sam Houston, he heard about the assassination
of President Kennedy. Returning immediately to his office, he
contacted MIG personnel in Dallas and instructed them to
intensify their liaisons with. federal, state, and local
agencies and to report back any information obtained. Early
that afternoon, he received a telephone call from Dallas
advising that an A.J. Hidell had been arrested or had come to
the attention of law enforcement authorities. Jones checked
the MIG indices, which indicated that there was a file on Lee
Harvey Oswald, also known by the name A.J. Hidell. Pulling the
file, he telephoned the local FBI office in San Antonio to
notify the FBI that he had some information. He soon was in
telephonic contact with the Dallas FBI office, to which he

summarized the documents in the file. He believes ‘that ‘one

The Committee found Jones! testimony to be very credible.

His statements concerning the contents of the Oswald file

are consistent with FBI communications that were generated as
a result of the information which he initially provided.
Access to Oswald's Military Intelligence file, which the
Department of Defense never gave to the Warren Commission, was
not possible because the Department of Defense had destroyed
the file as part of a general program aimed at eliminating all
of its files pertaining to nonmilitary personnel. In

response to a Committee inquiry, the Department of Defense
gave the following explanation for the file's. destruction:

1. ‘Dossier AB 652876, OSWALD, Lee Harvey, was
identified for deletion from IRR (Intelligence
Records and Reports) holdings on Julian date
73060 (1 March 1973) as stamped on the micro-
filmed dossier cover. It is not possible to
determine the actual date when physical _
destruction was accomplished, but is. credibly
surmised that the destruction was accomplished
“within a period not greater than sixty days

following the identification for deletion.

Evidence. such as the type of deletion record

deletion resulted from the implementation of a

the actual physical destruction of the dossier.
The individual identifying the dossier for deletion
can be determined from the clerk number appearing
on the available deletion record. The number
indicates that Lyndall E. Harp was the identifying
clerk. Harp was an employee of the IRR from 1969
until late 1973, at which time she transferred
to the Defense Investigative Service, Fort Holabird,
ey Maryland, where she is still a civil service
employee. The individual ordering the destruction
or deletion cannot be determined. However, available
evidence indicates that the dossier was identified
for deletion under a set of criteria applied by
IRR clerks to all files. The basis for these

Cuban activities of Oswald, several Federal
Bureau of Investigation reports, and possibly

signifieant information in the dossier. It should
be noted here that the Army was not asked to
investigate the assassination. Consequently, any
Army derived information was turned over to the
appropriate civil authority.

4. At the time of the destruction of the Oswald
dossier, IRR was operating under the records
disposal authority contained in the DOD Memorandum
to Secretaries of the Military Departments, OASD(A),
9 February 1972, subject: Records Disposal
Authority (Incl 2). The memorandum forwards
National Archivist disposal criteria which is
similar in nature to the requirements outlined

in the 1 June 1971 instructions. It was not

until 1975 that the Archivist changed the criteria
to ensure non-destruction of investigative records
that may be of historical value. cy

Upon receipt of this information, the Committee
orally requested the destruction order relating to the file
on Oswald. In a letter dated September 13, 1978, the General
Counsel of eho Department of the Army replied that no such
order existed:

Army regulations do not require any type of

specific order before intelligence files can be
destroyed, and none was prepared: in connection

with the destruction of the Oswald file. As a rule,
-investigative information on persons not directly
affiliated with the Defense Department can be retained
in Army files only for short periods of time and in
carefully regulated circumstances.. The Oswald file

’ intelligence files annually.

The Committee finds this "routine" destruction of the

ae

Oswald file extremely troublesome, especially when viewed in
light of the Department of Defense's failure to make this file
{ available to the Warren Commission. Despite the credibility
of Jones' testimony, without access to this file the question
ed : of Oswald's possible affiliation with military intelligence
cannot be fully resolved. The absence of this file, however,
has no bearing upon the Committee's conclusion concerning

the absence of any relationship between Lee Harvey Oswald

and the CIA.
