With regard to the relations with Mexico or the official

policy of the country, we can point out that although the in-

do lerger in volume, this work is not ex-

ploiting the information facilities.

Besides, in the first as well as the second case, the

sources available to the Center are not known in the Informa-

tion Service. We can deduce the information capabilities by

analyzing circles or individuals from whom the information 1g

obtained.

However, we don't know what the relations are be-

tween the Center und these informants, therefore we cannot

guide the information collection effort.

b) CENTRAL AMERICA

Similarly,

we are interested in second place in knowing

about the situation among the political forces in MEXIÇo,

especially with regard to leftist forces and their role and

importance individually.

And lastly, it is necessary, in our opinion, to develop

b) CENTRAL AMERICA

In this region it is nocessary to euphasize the obtain

Ing of information about plans of apression in Cuba, espe-

cinlly with sugard to possibilities of collective action

against Cuba.

On the other hand, work should be strengthened with

regard to the situation

and plans of the national liberation

movement in the region and in each country.

An effort should

be made to get to know,

completely, what the role and the

position of every leftist force

is, since there are countries,

like Nicaragua, where it is not known, due to lack of informa-

tion,

what role each force is playing and which are their

relations with us.

We consider that we must establish con-

tacts to work constantly and periodically with each of the

leftist forces in these countries.

Only this way we will be

able to overcome the deficiency.

The situation in these countries is very serlous, from

the standpoint of the

information work.

As we have said, we

have no information about them.

We consider that the first

matter to solve

is to know the

sources fron which we can

obtain information and at the same time establish contact

friendly forces in order to obtain information.

ANALISIS ABOUT INFORMATION ON ENEMY ACTIVITIES WORK:

BACKGROUND:

Abut the information work with countries in the M-A

Section with regard tu intormation about counter-revolutionary-

type and apression plans wo can point out, in general, 1t8

principal successes and deficiencles.

Through previous experience and the analysis of informa-

tion received from the countrics of this Section concerning

counter-revolutionary activities, it was confirmed once more

that this is the zone preferred by Impertalism for locating

training camps for counter-revolutionary clements, getting

co the point where this assumes serious characteristics in

certain places or specific zones, such as the case of the

Peten zone in Guatemala and Puerto Cabezas and the Halz Is-

lands in Nicaragua.

From information about this type of activity we can

Section during

the forthcoming year, this guideline would

cover the following aspects that will be basic from the

standpoint of aggression plans.

number, as

well as their resources.

2. Detection of enemy argression plans through the

of Central American

countries and through the so-much mentioned collective action,
