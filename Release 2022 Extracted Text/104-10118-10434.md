5, Station Support.

a. On the morning of | December 1963, PARMUTH assisted RESCIGNO
in installing audio microphones under the flooring of an LCHARVEST occupied
apartment. (See HMMA~22608, Il Dec 63, para 5.d.) Lines leading from the
oPiio installation to the LP were strung and secured below the flooring which had
ample semi-crawling space between the target area and the LP apartment,
RESCIGNO and PARMUTH entered this crawling spact by removing a small
ccetion of flooring located inside the LP apartments There is also a trap door
leading into the crawl space at the front entrance hall of the building although
the curious would be discouraged to enter this area because of stagnant water
six to ten inches deep on the floors at all times, cob webs, bugs, etc., ete
Three audio microphones were installed on this operation.

b>. During the period 2-14 December 1963, PARMUTH again handled
LIFIRES 4/5 while Marvin A, CABOT was on annual leave.

c. On 6 December 1963 PARMUTH forwarded to KURIOT/WAVE
Headquarters two orders of envelopes (six month supply per each request)
ee handcarried by Timothy A+
CAPRIOTT to WAVE Headquarters, avoiding a week's delay if the envelopes
were sent through the pouch from Mexico City. The stamps were handcarried
by another TDYer to the States for mailing to Washington.

a. On 6 December 1963 PARMUTH was requested to re-enter the
LP covering the LCHARVEST apartment as reported in para 5,a, of this report.
‘The purpose of this visit was to unlock @ closed door which stored the LP equip-
ment which monitors LCHARVEST activities in that apartment. Although the
tasehouse keeper had a key which worked well for several days previously, the
: lock would not open for the agent on the afternoon of 6 December. PARMUTH
i catered the apartment at 0130 hours on 7 December and unlocked the door. It
sis found that the throw bolt located inside the lock was broken, For security
purposes, two other locks were ‘Temoved from other doors located in the same
voor to check if these locks were in the same bad condition, In each case,
when the key was inserted into the lock and turned excessively, the throw bolt
: snapped. A.new lock of the same type manufacture was installed’on the closet
in door by the basehouse keeper on 7 December 1963.
\ : i
Oa the night of 7 December 1963, PARMUTH was requested by e
the COS to install an extension phone at the COS residence.” After a short .
training period given by RESCIGNO at the MKCHARITY base, PARMUTH was.
able to service this request satisfactorily. This extension was one which t
replaced one removed (for study) by KUSODA officials who inspected Mexico. |

“The complek. system was then dismantled of SWINEHART so that L-22
could re-install the system from the beginning. This was done by L-22 and met

with SWINEHART's satisfaction, Although the Consulate door was closed to the
public for a period of six days for unknown reasons as of the niht of 17 Decembar
1963, tests were made using the SEQUENCE camera photographing people walking

by the Consulate door, The camera worked well and produced good printable
negatives, On the morning of 18 December 1963, L-22 contacted PARMUTH and
explained that the Consulate door was now open to the public and receiving
visitors as of 1010 that day. PARMUTH and SWINEHART joined L-22 shortly
later at the LIERODE basehouse and found that the camera system was working
Well and pliotographing people entering and leaving this target area. SWINEHART

take to be presented to the COS and C/PBRUMEN for their approval, Both were
very pleased with the photographic results using this type of camera equipment,
at the LIERODE basehouse. As of this reporting, the SEQUENCE camera is S
using approximately 100 feet of Plus X film between 0900 and 1400 houre (office
hours for the Consulate). L-23 uses the present dark room area to photograph
traffic entering and leaving the front gate of the Embassy and is on duty from
0800 to 1800 hours daily, six days a week. In order for L-22 to process the film
from both of these cameras and make prints daily, it will be necessary to install
another darkroom at the basehouse, L-22 will need a Morse Tank for processing
film, a drying rack, and a small PAKO dryer for finishing prints in order to
satisty PBRUMEN requirements at the Station, Forwarded as enclosure 2 is
