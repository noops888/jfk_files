CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY,

Defendant.

AFFIDAVIT

GERALD L. LIEBENAU, being first duly sworn, deposes and
says: :

1. I am the Information Review Officer for the
Directorate of Operations (DO) of the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA). My responsibilities include the review of DO
documents which are the object of Freedom of Information Act
(Fora) requests to and litigation against the CIA to ensure
that details made regarding the disposition of such docu-
ments, pursuant to provisions of the FOIA, are proper. The
statements made herein are based upon my knowledge, upon
information made available to me in my official capacity,
upon advice and guidance from the Office of General Counsel
of the CIA and upon conclusions reached in accordance
therewith.

2. Through my official duties, I have become
acquainted with this case since the ruling of the Circuit

Court of Appeals on 12 November 1980. My predecessor,

Mr. Robert E. Owen, had been the DO reviewing official—co->>

concerning the FOIA disposition of the document at issue in

9 January 1979, and the other on 11 January 1980. During
the course of this litigation the document at issue, marked
509-803 for identification purposes, was initially withheld
in its entirety pursuant to FOIA exemptions (b)(1), (b)(2)
and (b)(3). During a review connected with Mr. Owen's
affidavit of 11 January 1980, a determination was made that
portions of the document were no longer exempt from release
as a result of disclosures that had recently been made in
connection with Congressional hearings. Effective with the
Order of the Circuit Court of Appeals on 12 November 1980.
all filing instructions previously withheld and deleted from
the released version of the document were reinserted in the
releasable version. Additionally, all classification
markings and related information control markings which had
been deleted from the releasable version of the document, as

—Part, of the declassification process, were reinserted in the
document and then marked to show that the classification
designations are no longer appropriate. The newly revised

version of the document was provided the plaintiff. (CIA .
Exhibit A).

: 3. On the basis of my review of the document at issue
‘in connection with this affidavit I have determined that one
additional modification of the document is necessary. The
word "City" has been reinserted in those portions previously
marked "B" on the second page in the first line of the text
on page 3, in the second and fourth lines of paragraph 4
and in the third line of paragraph 5. The CIA concern over

public acknowledgment of the existence of CIA stations or

other facilities in specified foreign locations is real. In

most circumstances, some damage to the official relations
between the United States and the named country is
predictable. In the case of the acknowledgment of the
existence of a CIA station in Mexico City in 1963, it has
been alleged or referred to in a number of forums and
publications, semi-official and official, including
accidental disclosure in CIA documents released under the
FOIA. Consequently, withholding the same information in
this document can no longer be justified. A copy of the
document with “City" reinserted is attached as CIA Exhibit B
and is being forwarded to plaintiff.

4.. To fulfill my official responsibilities, I have
been delegated authority for original classification of
information as Top Secret. I have reviewed document 509-803
and have determined that the portions which remain withheld
are properly exempt from disclosure because:

. a. it is currently and properly classified
pursuant to Executive Order 12065 as information
requiring continued protection against unauthorized
disclosure to protect against damage to national
security and thus exempt from release pursuant to FOIA

5 exemption (b)(1);

b._ the information reveals facts about
intelligence sources and methods which the Director of
Central Intelligence is responsible for protecting
against unauthorized disclosure as set forth in

50 U.S.C. 403(d)(3), and which is thus exempt from

release pursuant to FOIA exemption (b)(3); and



13-00000

SECRET

c. the information reveals facts about CIA
organization, functions, names, official titles or
numbers of personnel employed, all of which are exempt
from disclosure pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 403g and thus
FOIA exemption (b)(3).

5. The letter markings used to identify the kind of
information withheld in each instance remains basically as
set forth in the affidavit of Robert E. Owen except for the

veinsertion of material formerly deleted and identified as

category and "F"; said categories being withdrawn and
previously deleted material having been reinserted pursuant
to the Circuit Court Order of 12 November 1980. The
remaining categories are repeated below for the Court's
convenience. Additionally, more specific language has been
added and underlined. The additions are possible because of
the classification of this affidavit:
‘ a. Circumstantial information which, in
combination with other information, could lead to the

identification of an intelligence source, in this case

a foreign government's security service and its

intelligence service collaborating with the CIA under

- . an arrangement of confidentiality,’ withheld pursuant to

FOIA exemptions (b)(1) and (b)(3);
b. Circumstantial information which, in
combination with other information could lead to the

identification of an intelligence method used to

collect intelligence information abroad, |

‘use of liaison arrangements with foreign intelligence’

and Security services and the methods these services

employ in intelligence collection,/withheld pursuant to

FOIA exemptions (b)(1) and (b)(3);

c. Information which is currently and properly
classified in the interest of national security,

because it discloses details of CIA's knowledge of the

identities and activities of Soviet intelligence

officers and the nature of CIA's counterintelligence

efforts to collect said information, withheld pursuant

to FOIA exemptions (b)(1) and (b)(3); and

d. Information identifying CIA staff employees
and organizational components, withheld pursuant to
i} FOIA exemptions (b)(3).

6. In doing my, review of the document at issue, I
determined that only exempt portions have been withheld.
Conversely, all segregable, non-exempt material has been
~ - | released.

7. The major concern which prompts the CIA to continue
to withhold portions of document 509-803 is the damage that
would be inflicted jupon the liaison arrangements with the’
(National Security Service of the Government of Mexico’ if the
withheld portions of the document were publicly disclosed.

Most of the information would not have been available

except for thé contributions and collaboration of th:

National Security Service of the Government of Mexico. The

information so withheld was received under an arrangement?

of mutually assured confidentiality,’ To disregard that

arrangement and to disclose the existence and the product

| of the arrangement would threaten its current viability.

' (The Government of Mexico, through its National Security

Service, has been, and is, a very

the security and intelligence services of the United
States. The collaboration includes efforts to stop the flow
of narcotics into the United States, to monitor and negate
the activities of Central American terrorists organizations
and to monitor and negate the activities of hostile foreign
intelligence services, particularly the Soviet services,
against the United States. A number of other benefits also
accrue to the United States as a result of this collabora-
tion. The loss of this liaison arrangement would cause
damage to the United States' ability to protect its national
security. The protection the arrangement provides could not
be entirely replaced if Mexico withdrew.

8. Disclosure of the kind of collaboration with ‘the
United States by the Mexican National Security Service which
is apparent in the withheld portions of document 509-803,
“would cause considerable trouble to the current Government
of Mexico. Such activities would not be viewed with favor
by a significant portion of the public in Mexico.

Disclosure of the existence of such a relationship by the
U.S. Government is likely to be used actively and
effectively against the current Government of Mexico by
Tl political groups. Moreover, the government itself
is likely to feel compelled to make public gestures to
discredit any allegations or inferences that the current
government would engage in such collaboration. Despite the
fact that the current collaboration is close, the government

would not want to acknowledge it publicly. Furthermore, the

Mexican Government may fear that its current cooperation

9. There have been a number of books and magazine
articles by private authors in which various allegations of
CIA intelligence operations in Mexico City have appeared.

The €ollaboration of the Mexican overnmen? had also been

alleged. Such private guessing and speculation does not

have the authority of an official disclosure through the
FOIA release of official records. Consequently, even though

some speculation has accurately described secret activities

the damage has heen limited because such disclosures do not

officially challenge fhe Mexican Government) to take official

note; furthermore, they are only approximately accurate and

could not be considered authentic. Disclosure of the

withheld portions of document 509-803 would complete the
damage possible by making the disclosures precise and

authoritative.

10. Beyond purely internal discomfort any disclosures
would cause (the Wexican Government; there are potentially
significant foreign relations consequences also. Diplomatic
arrangements with several foreign governments are likely to
suffer because~certain portions of the withheld material
demonstrate the violations of the sanctity of foreign

diplomatic territory and facilities in Mexico. Such
developments would, at a minimum, increase the likelihood

that the Mexican Government would want to diminish any

ll further hazard involved {in intelligence collaboration witty

11, It was not possible to identify he liaisoq
in an unclassified affidavit. To do so, in light

of what was already evident on the public record concerning
the substance of the document and the locale of the events

described, would have been tantamount to disclosing which

government had collaborated with CIA and, given the kind of
activity, the specific (services) involved. An essential
element of the intelligence [laison arrangement is an

understanding [pf confidentiality) The intelligence

information [exchanged normally must. be kept secret as well
as the fact of the Aiaison7arrangemeny. An effective

[(Porking 1faison] woula not exist without the necessary (mutual

fonimitment to confidentiality,

12. The reality of such commitments to secrecy is
recognized in the language of Executive Order 12065.
Section 1-3 describes the kinds of information which are
Classifiable. It specifically identifies in "Section 1-
301(b) foreign government information; 1-301(c) intelligence
activities, sources or methods; and 1-301(d) foreign
relations of the United States." Section 1-302 states that
“zven though information is-determined to‘concern one or
moré of the criteria in Section 1-301, it may not be
classified unless an original classification authority also
determines that its unauthorized disclosure reasonably could
be expected to cause at least identifiable damage to the
national security." To further emphasize considerations

which are unique to U.S. foreign intelligence activities

Section 1-303 elaborates. that, “Unauthorized disclosure of

foreign government information or the identity of a con-

fidential foreicn source is presumed to cause at least



13-00000 -

SEE Caner aT, }
identifiable damage to national security." (Emphasis
added.) The information withheld from disclosure in docu-

ment 509-803 resulting from a liaison arrangement’ and/or
which could reasonably be expected to lead to the identi-
fication of a confidential intelligénce source, in this case
‘@ foreign government's security service} is thus properly
classifiable and classified.

13. Section 1-501 of Executive Order 12065 states what
must be shown on the face of a document when it is
“originally classified." This section deals with documents
originated after Executive Order 12065 was effective on 1

December 1978, Such requirements could not have been

imposed on classified documents already in existence such as
document 509-803. Section 1-402 of the same Executive Order

states:

i Only officials with Top Secret classifi-
cation authority and agency heads listed in
Section 1-2 may classify information for more
than six years from the date of the original
classification. This authority shall be used
sparingly. In such cases, a declassification
date or event, or a date for review, shall be
set. This date or event shall be as early as
! national security permits and shall be not
more than twenty years after original
classification, except that for foreign
government information the date or event may
nd be up to thirty years after classification.

As I indicated-earlier, I am authorized to originally
classify information at the level of Top Secret. For the
Purpose set forth in this affidavit, I have reviewed document
509-803 and have determined that portions of the document

remain properly classified at the level of Secret. The

document is properly marked to show that classification.

‘Furthermore, the document is marked to show a date for a

subsequent declassification review, ani Ia

12a through 12a contain information which was provided

exemption (b)(3).

16. The withheld portions of paragraphs 10 and 11
contain information which was available from a very sensitive
source which. monitored conversations between the President of
Cuba and the Cuban Ambassador to Mexico. Such an ability is
obviously exceedingly valuable and sensitive. The
information from this source has been made public in very
limited amounts, and it has been extensively rewritten,
abbreviated and paraphrased to protect against exposing the
source and method which produced the information. The
disclosure of the information in document 509-803 could
reasonably be expected to result in a clear disclosure and
thus damage national security and is, therefore, properly
classified and exempt from release pursuant to FOIA exemption
(b)(1). In that a disclosure of the information would also
expose an intelligence source and method, it is also
protected from disclosure by 50 US.C. 403(d)(3) and exempt
from disclosures pursuant to FOIA exemption (b)(3).

17. The withheld portions of paragraphs 16, 17, 19 and

20 contain information which discloses the extent of CIA's

ities

counterintelligence knowledge of the personnel and ac!
“of the Soviet intelligence service. Because of the amount of
time that has gone by, this information has diminished in its
potential value to the Soviet intelligence service, but I
believe it still possesses value as information that can be
used against U.S. counterintelligence efforts. Since some
damage can reasonably be expected from disclosure of the
information, it is properly classified and exempt from

disclosure pursuant t> FOIA exemption (b)(1).

is presumed to flow from the disclosure of such information

and the disclosure would expose a foreign intelligence
source, the information is protected by classification and 50
U.S.C. 403(d)(3) and thus exempt from disclosure pursuant to
FOIA exemptions (b)(1) and (b)(3).

19. Both the CIA and the plaintiff have asserted that
most of the substantive information in the document is
contained in other documents that have been released to the
public. This affidavit attempts to show the Court how the
manner in which the information is presented in document 509-
803 results in the disclosure of exempt information. I have
attached copies of CIA documents in which information
concerning the same substance as that being withheld has been
publicly released. The documents are grouped and labeled
with names to assist in making comparisons with document 509-
803. The paragraphs cited are those in document 509-803.

Oswald - paragraph 1, starting on page two;

Duran - paragraphs 5-9 and 12a-d
Cuban Ambassador - paragraphs 10 and 11;_

Kostikov - paragraphs 16, 17, 19 and 20; and
Alvarado - paragraphs 21 and 23-25.

I believe the Court will find that the withheld portions of
document 509-803 do in fact disclose information concerning
the intelligence sources and methods involved in addition to
the intelligence substance produced. & copy of the original,
