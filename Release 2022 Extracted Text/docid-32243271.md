Assassination Records Review Board
Final Determination Notification

AGENCY : HSCA
RECORD NUMBER : 180-10068-10305
RECORD SERIES : STAFF PAYROLL RECORDS
AGENCY FILE NUMBER :

December 8, 1995
Status of Document: Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 6

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors
including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the
absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United
States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 3

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.
Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could
reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of
privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

MEMORANDUM

TO: Robert Blakey
| FROM: Robert Lehner
DATE: July 19, 1977
RE: Applicant Peter G. Beeson :

Mr. Beeson is an intelligent, articulate young man who evinced
great interest in working with us. He has some knowledge of the
King case and possesses an open mind as to its resolution. He has
tried some Narcotic Conspiracy cases for the Justice Department
and has filed appellate briefs. He would be a welcomed addition to
our team. a

His present salary is $20,00. He states as of March 15, 1978
he would expect to make $25,000 under a GS-13 rating and therefore
requests $25,000 with us. He will be available to start with us in
the next two weeks.

I recommend we take him. /

Dear Professor Blakey:

I am sending the resume which you requested,
along with a suggested salary of $25,000, (in line
with the level which I would automatically reach with
the Justice Department in the relatively near future).

The litigation experience reflected on the re- {
sume is almost complete; it omits only a second éasel |
in Puerto Rico (conspiracy) currently in pre-trial |
stages, an Atlanta conspiracy case I am preparing
to indict, and a brief just completed for an appeal
to the Ninth Circuit. The job has provided me with | r
a varied and respectable amount of litigation and
appeal experience, in addition to the more routing
matters (immunities, witness protections, indict-
ment dismissals, Title III wiretap authorizations, |
solicitor general memos etc.) handled on a daily |
basis by the various sections within the Criminal '
Division, i

The job which you have described obviously |
presents an exciting and unique opportunity. Further, i
I would consider it an honor to work with you. on
the investigation. I expect I would .be able to start
work with you within a month, or sooner, should an
offer be extended. I look forward to hearing from
you in the near future. |

Sincerely,

Docld:32243271 Page 8
