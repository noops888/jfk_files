RE: JAMES RIDDLE HOFFA

63- New

Beverly Hills, California.

Matula on local probation and

used to be runner for Babe Mc Coy and Frank Brewster, former

Teamster officials.

Matula wants out of Teamsters, is

deathly afraid of being arrested and is ripe for intensified

interrogation."

"John B. Stevenson, former West Coast attorney for

Teamsters Union,

is close associate of Brewster and Dave Beck.

Stevenson now semi-retired and lives in Honolulu.

His office

in Los Angeles is run by attorney Charles K. Hackler whon

Hoffa does not respect..

Hackler pays Stevenson $400 monthly

although Stevenson does not work.

Stevenson holds approximately

80% of Matula's cash. Stevenson has a boat in Honoluly where

it is suspected that currency may be hidden."

The Bureau has not disseminated any of the information

quoted above to the Department. Therefore, it is desired.

that the informant be reinterviewed immediately to obtain

further specifics with respect to this information. Efforts

should be made to pin down the informant as to the sources

of his information on all of the above-mentioned points.

As soon as this has been done, Los Angeles should

incorporate all information given by the informant on these

points (both at the time he mentioned them originally and

upon subsequent recontacts) into a letterhead menorandum

suitable for dissemination to the Department.: The letterhead

memorandum should bear

the same caption. as this airtel and

should be forwarded to the Bureau by cover airtel.

The

identity of the informant should not be revealed

therein nor

should he be referred to as "Clip." The additional information

the informant furnishes also should be utilized as the basis

for further investigative leads in this case.

For the information of Los Angeles, the story told

by "Clip" concerning Matula as set out in Los Angeles airtels

of 9/13/61 and 9/20/61 (LA file 62-4945) is being made available

to the Department, in paraphrased form, by the Bureau.

Therefore,

Los Angeles's letterhead memorandum should not include or

make

any reference to this information.

A copy of the Bureau's

communication to the Department in this regard is being

forwarded

to Los Angeles separately.
