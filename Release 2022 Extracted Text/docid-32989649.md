Wilkins has been associated with the NAACP since
approxinately 1931, During the 1930's and 1940's various
communist publications carried articles concerning Wilkins'
activities when those activities coincided with prograns
sponsored by the Communist Party (CP), No information has
been received, however, that Wilkins has ever been sympathetic
to comninist ideolosy. It has been reported that Wilki
has vigorously opposed communist infiltration in the NAACP

movement and was founder and president for many years of

the International Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, He

was the subject of a security-type investigation in 1944

from other sroups for the same reason. His integration
activities have, at times, paralleled CP activities; however,

_REQUEST FOR PRESS PASSES ~~)
pe.
This memorandum is being prepared pursuant to your instructions
“_ following a call to your office by Mr. Edwin Guthman of the Department late
” yesterday afternoon. ' aay,

“Mr, Guthman advised that the Metropolitan Police Department
regularly receives requests for press passes from newspapers throughout the
country so that their representatives may cover special events in Washington. :

« He said that the practice of the Metropolitan Police Department
in regard to these requests is to have Mr. Ben Gilbert, one of the editors of the
Washington Post, screen the names submitted to the police to make certain that
they are not objectionable and are acceptable to the Washington Press Corps. 7

Mr, Guthman said that in connection with the 8/28/63 march on

Washington the police have received a letter signed by Eric Bert, managing editor
of "The Worker" in New York, requesting passes fr sewral individuals allegedly
affiliated with the paper. This request was turned over by the police in-accordance
with their usual custom to Gilbert who in turn called Guthman to ascertain if it
was satisfactory with the Department for. such passes to be issued. In connection
with these passes it is noted that the holders of such are allowed to cross streets,
police lines, and are given other courtesies normally afforded other working press

RE: AUGUST 28TH MARCH ON WASHINGTON .

All of these individuals, of course, are well-known communist
officials and we have prepared a ae resume as to their identity and background.
This is attached.

This attached data regarding these individuals has been furnished :
—te-Guthman by your-office.—Mr.—Guthman has further been told that asfaras - ..—- ——
the FBI is concerned we can see no reason why they should have the requested press
passes or be furnished any other courtesies. It was pointed out to Guthman that

the Communist Party, its officials and its members have defied the Attorney

General and the United States courts by refusing to register as directed under :
the Subversive Activities Control Act. Jt was also stressed to Guthman emphatically, |
however, that a final determination as to any action must be made by the Department.

the object of the JCC is to preserve and extend Jewish cul-
ture, including, without limitations, educational, theatrical,
musical, scientific and literary activities.

On July 27, 1953, a source advised it is his opin-
ion that the JCC is a locai “progressive” organization not
directly connected with the Communist Party, USA (CP); that
the JCC was started by some local members of the CP but not,
in his opinion, at the orders of the CP; and that he believes
the JCC was formed in order to provide a meeting place for
"progressive Jewish groups,”

The source advised on January 5, 1955, that ‘the JCC
continued to act as a meeting place for “progressive Jewish
groups" in the Miami area, and to rent space to any group
meeting that qualification. He further advised the JCC in -—
itself is not a Communist front organization but does permit
such organizations to hold meetings at the Center,

"The Jewish Fraternalist" dated October, 1947,
self-identified as the official publication of the Jewish
People's Fraternal Order (JPFO) of the International Workers
Order (IWO), on page-6,—contained.an article which disclosed .- -
that the Emma Lazarus Division (ELD) of the JPFO was to hold
its first national convention in New York City on November 15

and 16, 1947, after having been first established at a
National Women! s Conference called three years previously
by the JPFO. -

The "Morning Freiheit" on January 25, 1951,
contained a report of the National Convention of the ELD
of the JPFO which took place in New York City on January
20 and 21, 1951. At this convention it was noted that the
‘ELD changed its name to Emma Lazarus Federation of Jewish
Women's Clubs (ELF) and adopted a new constitution.

On April 25, 1963, a source advised that the ELF is
one of several mass organizations comprising the Jewish
cultural progressive movement. June Gordon, ELF Executive
Director, who is a member of the New York State Communist
Party (CP) Board and Committee, is the leading force in the
,organization, whose leadership is largely made up of communists.

The source stated that the ELF claims to be for
peace and interested in protecting the rights of the foreign
born. It is against the Ben Gurion Government of Israel, bomb
testing, anti-Semitism, Negro discrimination, and the rearmament

: On August 19, 1963, a confidential source furnished
information that the Buffalo Chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP),
Buffalo, New York, is continuing to work towards its goal
of 100 passengers to travel by chartered bus from Buffalo,
New York, to Washington, D. C., on August 28, 1963, for
participation in the March on Washington. This source
stated that as of August 19, 1963, 54 persons had paid
the $15.00 bus fare being charged for the round trip and
that epproximately 40 other persons indicated they are
going but have not definitely committed themselves by
payment of the fare, This source stated that a recent
newspaper article containing a statement by the Buffalo
Chapter NAACP President that over 100 persons in the
Buffalo area had already signed for the trip as of a —
few ‘days ago was inaccurate and that there were not yet
100 persons committed, The source added, however, that
it presently appears the goal of 100 passengers and

‘possibly a few over the goal will be reached before
August 28, 1963.

An article in the August 16, 1963, edition

'" of cthe "Buffalo Evening News," a daily newspaper

This source stated. that so many different

committees are involved in the effort and are so
loosely coordinated that any definite computation for

make the trip, The source stated it appears the goal

‘According to this second confidential source
four buses of the Western New York Motor Lines at
Rochester, New York, have been reserved for the :
group that will make the trip and each person will be
charged $11.00 for the round trip. Efforts to chtain
donations from individuals who can not make the trip
to defray the expenses of others who can make the trip
have produced only two or three indefinite pledges of
$11.00 each. : isaac!

APPENDIX
WORKERS WORLD PARTY

On April 17, 1959, a source advised that on
February 12, 1959, a Socialist Workers Party (SWP) minority
group, under the leadership of National Committee member,
SAM BALLAN, split from the SWP,

The source stated that this minority group, referred
to as the Marcyites, after many years of program and policy
aifferences on varied issues concerning tactics and interpreta-
tion of political events, split from the SWP on the grounds that
the Party was liquidating itself by departing from the Marxist
precepts of LEON TROTSKY and retreating from the fight for the
world socialist revolution, The final issue which ultimately
forced“the split-was the minority's opposition to the SWP
" regroupment policy which involvéd coopération wi the Communist
Party (CP) periphery - individuals characterized by the minority
as petty - bourgeois,

7 The minority program, according tothe source, advo- -—
cates unconditional defense of the Soviet Union and has as its
goal the building of a revolutionary party with a complete

proletarian orientation for the purpose of overthrowing capitalism

in the United States and throughout the world,

On May 12, 1962, the source advised that this minority
-€roup had chosen the name Workers World Party,

On April 18, 1962, the source stated that the head-
quarters of the Workers World Party were located at 46 West 21st
Street, New York, New York.

The SWP and the CP have been designated by the Attorney
General of the United States pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

Le -COHABESRAL
W.E.B. DU BOIS CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO,
aka, Du Bois Youth Group, San Francisco

Du Bois Club, San Francisco Du Bois
Youth Group, Student-Labor Alliance

A source advised that on January 31, 1963, the
W.E.B. Du Bois Club of San Francisco held its first general
meeting at California Hall, Polk and Turk Streets, San Fran~
eisco, California, The aims of the club were put forth as
follows: :

1 - alleviate the Negro problem in the U.S.”

“2 - promote peaceful co-existence between
the U.S. and Russia.

a promote and encourage Marxist doctrines
” - and to bring about a socialistic govern~
*ment in the U.S.

This organization publishes a newsletter entitled,
"San Francisco News & World Report." In its first issue,
dated March 3, 1963, there was set forth a “Proposed Statement
of Principles" in which the aforementioned aims were elaborated —
upon.

In this same issue of the "San Francisco News &
World “Report ," the lead editorial in part describes the W.E.B.
Du Bois Club cf San Francisco as Moooa group of young people
who are convinced that Socialism is the only answer to the
many problems of our time and so find philosophical rapport
with the life and thought of Dr. Du Bois, nevertheless we are
weighted with humility in comparing our goals and ambitions
with the genius of his life and work, As a source of
inspiration the figure of W.E.B. Du Bois is unequaled in
American history, but as a standard and example, we seem
miserably lost in his shadow. We can only resolve that we do
his name no dishonor, and whatever we may accomplish should be
“recognized as a supplement to his life work.”

The November 25, 1961, issue of the
"People's World,” a West Coast communist
newspaper published weekly in San
Francisco, California, contains an

August 22, 1963

MARCH ON WASHINGTON
AUGUST 28, 1963
RACIAL MATTERS .

On August 20, 1963, MP T-1 advised as follows: .

A meeting of a seloct group of the Mimnesota March to
Washington Committee was held during the evening of August 20,
1963, at Minneapplis, Mimnesota. At this time the final selection,
so far as possible, was made of persoms who will be granted
passage on the chartered American Airlines plane, which 15
scheduled to leave Minneapolis, Minnesota, at 3:00 a.m., August
28, 1963, for Washingtom, D. C., amd to return to Minneapolis from”
Washington, D. C., at or about 7:30 p.m., on August 28, 1963.

, During the course of this meeting it was decided that
only 58 seats would be allocated. A previously held idea that
some 90 reservations would be sold, thus necessitating a larger
plane, was abandoned.

While the select group was passing on applicants for
seats on the plane, a phone call was received by one of the
members, presumably from Matthew Little, who has been a leader
in the committee, who requested the name of Rose Renaud, also
known as Rose Tillotson, be deleted from the passenger list.
Hr. Little reportedly made this request because Rose Renaud was
a leader locally of the Communist Party (CP). Rose Renaud, in

“Ce amunist Party, USA (HDDCP). Mr. Little also requested that
—t e-name of Oscar M. Mahlke, of Excelsior, Minnesota, --bs -deleted-
‘som those assigned a seat. This again was apparently because
£ information indicating that Mr. Mahlke had had some Communist
affiliations.

On January 4, 1963, Norman John Boehnke
advised that at a meeting of the MDDCP

at the residence of Betty Smith,

Minneapolis, Minnesota, om December 20,

29, 1963, ~ e 7

On August 20, 1963, MP T-2 advised that
Betty Smith was a leading member of and
Ralph Taylor was chairman of the MDDCP.

The approved list of persons travelling on the chartered

plane, together with three individuals travelling independently
but still considered a part of the Minnesota March to Washington
- Committee group, are set forth hereafter in this memorandum.

On August 21, 1963, MP T-3 advised as follows;

Jobn Howard Tillotson, the grandson of Rose Renaud, is

carrently at a camp in New Jersey. John Tillotson plans to travel
from New Jersey to Washingtom, to participate in the March on
Washington. Robert Baum, a “chum" of John Tillotson, is also
going to participate in the march.

(Robert Baum is listed hereafter as a passenger on the

chartered airline, and will be characterized below.)

MP T-4 advised on Juiy 3, 1963, that John Tillotson

attended the annual Progressive Youth Organizing Committee (P¥OC) ©
school from June 25, 1963, to June 30, 1963, at Camp Midvale,
Wanaque, New Jersey. (The’ Pyoc is characterized in the Sodas



MARCH ON WASHINGTON

John Tillotson planned to remain at Camp Midvale’ until the end
of August, 1963.

On August 20, 1963, MP T-2 advised that John
Howard Tillotson is the grandson of Rose
‘ Remaud, secretary of the MDDCP. He re-
called that some months ago a member of

the MDDCP was requested by Rese Remaud to.
indoctrinate John Howard Tillotson into

the Communist ideology.

On August 21, 1963, MP T-1 made available the list of

.approved passengers to travel to Washington and return on August
28, 1963, on the American Airlines plane chartered by the Minnesota

SYNOPSIS

The March on Washington scheduled for August 28,
1963, which has created nationwide interest, is being actively
supported by various legitimate nonsubversive religious,
fraternal, civil and labor organizations.

Current information developed as a result of our
investigation of the Communist Party (CP), USA, activities
does not indicate that this event was actually initiated by
or is controlled by the CP. However, it is pertinent to
note that when Martin Luther King, Jr., one of the leaders NN
£ the March, first conceived the idea of organizing the
jarch on Washington, he discussed the matter with Stanley David
evison, a concealed CP member, and sought Levison's adviée"ss"—
‘O Wiéther the tine was Yight for such a move. Levison agreed
\"the time is now." The fact that King consulted Levison
assumes additional significance in the light of information
we received from a source who has furnished reliable infor-
mation in the past to the effect thatin May, 196%, a national
functionary of the CPUSA commented that Stanle: evison, by
reason of his association with the Martin lw ing tiovement,
was doing the most important work in the varty at that time,
With respect to Levison's Party connection, we received
information in June, 1963, that although he still has strong
communist convictions and still acts as an effective Party
advisor to King, he has become critical of the Party's role —
in the civil rights movement. Levison said he does not
consider himself to be under the control of the Party with
-Fespect to his dealings with King.

The Party is actively supporting the March, in
spite of its awareness of a public statement by leaders
| of the March that they did not want "any communists." CP
support of the March is manifested by endorsement of the
March in the communist press to foster the illusion that
the CP is a humanitarian group acting in the interest of
the Negro, and by Party leadership urging rank-and~file

CP members to clandestinely participate in the March.
This clandestine participation is a Party tactic which
is apparently being used in order not to alienate the
organizations sponsoring the March since the Party views
this event as a golden opportunity to reach a growing
powerful mass movement for Negro civil’ rights.

The Party plans to distribute openly its literature,

including 10,000 copies of a planned special edition of "The
Worker," east coast communist newspaper, to March participants

NW 68262 Docid:32989649 Page 124
me

se ts


in ‘various locations outside of Washington, D. C, In addi-
tion, the Party hopes to sell 10,000 of its pamphiets., No
distribution of Party literature is planned in Washington,
B. C., in deference to public announcements by leaders of
the March that there is to be no literature of any type
distributed in Washington during the March,

Coverage of communist activity in connection with
i [the March is planned at’ present-through six Bureau security-
informants who are coming to the March with local groups.
“ American communists in Mexico are supporting the
. March, including the collection of funds for the purpose of
“2 sending telegrams to March on Washington headquarters,

XN,

: Endorsement of the March has been announced by the
ASocialist Workers.Party (SWP) (cited as subversive under ly c
Executive Order 10450) and ins: ruétions calling for partici-_217v

pation have been issued by the/Workers World Party (WWP), a
:- splinter group of the SWwP, Wo information has. been received
to indicate that Elijah Muhammad, leader of Nation of Islam
(NOI), an all-Negro antiwhite cult, or NOI members plan to
participate, although as with any large Neern sathering,
the possibility exists that some members of the NOI will
_' march as individuals,

CP leaders have stressed the fact that the March _
is not the be ail and end all in itself. Events which sub-
sequently flow from the March will be of utmost importance,
such as following up on contacts now being made by CP members’
working in support of the demonstration. Utilizing the
March, the Party has three basic general objectives:

‘(1) Participation by CP members through legitimate
organizations,

(2) Attempt to get the Party line into the hands of
sympathizers and supporters of the March through
distribution of "The Worker" and Party pamphlets.

(3) Utilize the March: as a steppingstone for, future
Party activity through contacts now being made
by Party members involved in the March.

It remains to be seen to what extent the Party will
. be successful in translating its efforts stated above into
" concrete results,

DETAILS

Utilization of the March to Further Aims of the Communist Party i
‘he_ March on Washington scheduled for August 28, iv

1963, is an event which has created national interest and is
being supported by such nonsubversive organizations as. the B
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, (
Catholic Interracial Council, State Association of the Elks |
and the Greater Philadelphia Council of Churches, The

Communist Party (CP), USA, although it did not initiate nor is i
it controlling the March, is using this event for the purpose iz
of promoting its own interest.

- It is pertinent to note here, however, the conversa-
‘tion Martin Luther King, Jr., one of the March leaders, had
with Stanley David Levison, a secret member of the Party, on
\ June 1, 1963, It is known to us that Levison and King have
been in contact with each other since December, 1956. As i
early as September, 1958, Levison was described as one of King's {
chief assistants who spent considerable time advising and : 1:
helping toy At one time, Levison and his brother, who is i

known as Roy,jBennett, were organizers for the CP in New York. i
They are bi currently known aS Secret members of the Party: fecal
and in past years Levison and his brother, Roy Bennett, both :
have been heavy financial contributors to the CP. During the 1 oi
, afore-mentioned conversation, King commented he had never seen ‘oa
the Negro community as aroused, as determined, and as enthusi-
astic as at that time. He said that "We are on the threshold !
of a significant breakthrough and the greatest weapon is mass !
demonstration." King added "We are at the point where we can ie
mobilize all of this righteous indignation into a powerful mass 4h
movement."" King suggested that there be a mass march of literally
thousands and thousands of people on Washington. King said that
even the threat of such a march might so frighten the President
that he would have to do something, He asked Levison “Are wé

| tebe for that." In reply, Levison said two things would have

to be considered: (1) There would have to be unanimity among
all groups. (2) Would more pressure be generated on Washington
by a series of local situations rather than by one mass march
on Washington. King answered at length and was in favor of one
mass march, He said he envisioned such an event would create
“such an impact that “something would have to give." He again
asked Levison if the time was right for such a move. lLevison
then agreed "The time is nov." :

sranenasecen Acting Executive Director of
the Gandhi Society for Human Rights, who was a participant
Onversation 5 “~“suggésted that King discuss his
— -—proposal with Roy Wilkins, . Executive Secretary, .NAACP, and
A. Philip Randolph, President of the International Brother-
' hood of Sleeping Car Porters, before any announcement is
| made publicly concerning a mass march on Washington. At
that point, King suggested that either Levison or Jones
see A, Philip Randolph and that a statement be worked out
along the lines of the new militancy throughout the
country.

Clarence’ Jones had attended a meeting: at which the
National Council of Churches had expressed an interest in

i King's direct action approach. lLevison asked Jones whether

it would be possible to quote individuals without mention-

Bean ing. names who had attended the meeting as "this is new
when white church leadership is looking for something in
the way of direct action." Levison said this would give
it the biggest, broadest front ever as "you can see the
effect of Negroes joined by the National Council of Churches
and not just Negro churches." The significance of this iaus
conversation is apparent when consideration is given to the
fact that when King first was considering a march on
Washington, he discussed it in detail with his contact in

‘ the CP and sought the advice of this communist as to whether
the time was right for such a march. Additional significance
- Can be attached to this. conversation.: in the light of |

information we received from a source who has furnished
reliable information in the past to the effect that in
May, 1962, a national functionary of the CPUSA commented
that Stanley Levison, by reason of his association with the
Martin Luther King movement, was doing the most important
work in th Party at that time, Information received in
June, 1963, indicated that: while Levison still retains his
strong communist convictions and still acts as an effective
Party advisor to King, he is becoming critical of the Party's”
role in the relationship, He believes the Party has lost
prestige among Negroes lately because it has not been
sufficiently aggressive and effective in promoting civil
“rights for the Negro and otherwise immersing itself in
Negro causes, Levison said he does not consider himself to be
under the control of the Party with respect to his dealings
with King.

James wKottaon, Editor—of.'The-Worker,' east.

poard held iit JULy, 1963;~commented on the Negro struggle ene aed
and stated that "we"’ have to see in this the opportunity 7 :
\ to build up friends with the objective of bringing them
into the Party.

The possibilities inherent in this March as, seen
by the Party are indicated in a statement made by Gu: all,
CP Genoral, Secretory, in sneaking to approximately 7 D.¢
communists or communist sympathizers in Philadelphia, wy
Pennsylvania, on July 31, 1963. He described the March as fam
an ication of a peaceful transition toward socialism and,"
according to Hall, it is imperative that as many white -
people as possible participate. On August 2, 1963, Hall
commented that the Party should not give the appearance that
it is "taking over." (Along this line, Party leaders in
_ early August, 1963, urged rank-and-file CP members to
.Clandestinely participate in the March through legitimate
organizations.) y

\)

At a meeting of leading CP functionaries, New York —e

City, August 14, 1963, PhilyBart, CP National Organization
Secretary, stated that there never has been a comparable figure

in the past wherein hundreds of communists will actually be
together with tens of thousands of others, as will take place

in the March, Bart called for efforts to work with the idea

of, establishing| jconnection with this new force, At this same
meeting, Josep}/Brandt, CP national funetionary, commented that

the Party has blended itself into this "movement" and,
because persons in the March will be listening to our people, “4
the question now arises as to what can be done with these
people after the March. i

-" From information we have received, it is apparent.
the Party anticipates that participation by its members in :
this event, which it feels is of great historical significance, ‘

* will subsequently be used as a vehicle to reach a new massive :
force. Association with March sympathizers could well serve
as components of a future picture painted by the Party,

) featuring itself as the champion of the Negro cause.

Party Program

- As early as June, 1963, some semblance of a Party
program began to jell and was outlined in an article appearing
in the June 23, 1562, issue of "The Worker," This article
suggested a program based om 2 report adopted at a recent
national gathering of communist leaders. It called for:

(1) direct, mass, peaceful action pursued throvgh the Negro
people and their organizations; and (2) the support vf white
allies, beginning with organized labor. Included in the
proposals were the withholding of Federal funds from states —
which deny constitutional rights to its citizens; a petition
to the Supreme Court to set a time limit of January 1, 1964,
for compliance with its 1954 decision on the desegregation of
public schools; and, if necessary, the federalization of the
State National Guards.

7 By July 15, 1963, the Party had issued two directives
- "TO ALL (CP) DISTRICTS." One referred to an article in a

recent issue of "The Worker" by James Jackson, which identified
the "Dixiecrat" politicians and the "Northern Republican ultra-
Rightists" as the enemies of the Negro movenent.- The "Directive"
urged Party members to order:reprints of this article for mailing
to influential figures in Negro organizations, trade unions,
fraternal orders and churches. The other “Directive” urged
Party support of the March, which it described as "an event of
the greatest historic importance." NY

At a meeting of leading CP functiofiaries in
New York City on August 1, 1963, William/Albertson, member of _
the CP National Board, stated that the Party must show the”
| best of everything including the best picket lines and the

best cadre fighting. He proposed that the Party open up a
special headquarters in Washington, D. C, (This headquarters
had opened as of August 22, 1963.) At this same meeting,

Jack}itachel, member of the CP’ National Executive Committee,

commented that "we decided that “we will participate in the

——March by organizing a minimunt of-100 people and by organizing
pressure groups from New Jersey, Philadelphia and Baltimore.

and he hopes to see at least one chartered bus and several car

In Chicago, Illinois, Claude“Lightfoot, Chairman of

August, 1963; that the CP of Illinois is attempting to get 500° 7
white persons to go to Washington.

In Los Angeles, California, at a meeting of the

on August 5, 1963, a recommendation was made for the SCDCP

H Executive. Secretary.,.jSCDCP, had stated on July 30, 1963, that
| ' the SCDCP would not directly support the March by paying "i
! transportation costs due to lack of funds.

The Virginia CP State Executive Committee on July 14,
1963, proposed that work should begin on getting a delegation
to go to Washington as participants or as onlookers.

In Seattle, Washington, the CP leaders of the Central |
District Youth Club are attempting to raise money with an |
apparent objective to cover expenses of bus transportation for
a group to attend the March. According to a source, NAACP _

Ld

leaders in the State of Washington are having nothing to do with a
the communists. : Lg]
Use of Party Literature é
ae.

Much attention has been given the use of Party- ia
literature and a special edition of "The Worker". is being if
planned in connection with the March. Stachel, on August 7, ae

1963, proposed to leading CP functionaries that "The Worker"
and other literature be distributed to delegations to the

March, This was accepted but with the qualification that

no distribution would be. made during progress of the March.
Louis Weinstock, General Manager of "The Worker," who originally
planned to go to Washington on August 27, 1963, With 1,000
copies of "The Worker" in the trunk of his car, proposed, on
August 14, 1963, that 10,000 copies of "The Worker" be distrib-
_uted at bus and train terminals since there is to be no
distribution in Washington, D. C. He also proposed that 10,000
pamphlets be sold at concentration points on the morning of
August 28, 1963, and the remaindér be sold after the demonstration.

The Socialist Workers Party (SWP), designated under

Realizing that plans for the March on Washington are
obviously being carried on successfully by other organizations,
the Party is making an all-out effort to take advantage of this
opportunity to further its cause. The Party has three basic

: (1) Participation by CP membexs through legitimate
organizations :

. (2) Attempt to get the Party line into the hands }
of sympathizers and supporters of the March -—

PROGRESSIVE LABOR MOVEMENT

A source advised on January 15, 1962, that at 4
a meeting of the MILTON ROSEN faction_in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, on January 11, 1962, it was pointed out
that this group was in touch with Communist Party (CP)
and former CP members in various cities throughout the
United States hoping to convene a National Conference in
the summer of 1962 for the purpose of establishing a
National MARXIST-LENINIST organization. .

"Phe Worker,'' an East Coast Communist newspaper,
issue of January 7, 1962, page 10, column 3, reported the
expulsion -of MILTON ROSEN, former Labor Secretary of the
New York State CP, from the CP.

A second source advised on July 2, 1962, that
__.._Progressive Labor groups held a conference in New York
City, on July“1, 1962, where MILTON ROSEN acted as chair-
man. He read a statement at this conference setting forth
their intention to form a new MARXIST-LENINIST party in the
United States. ROSEN stated that a more formal organization
was necessary, one which would provide a framework for all a
who wanted to join in a united effort to build an American
vanguard, The functions of this new organization are to
include: consolidation of all existing forces around
-Progressive Labor and organizing additional forces; expand
and improve political activities; win additional forces to
an outlook of MARXISM-LENINISM and increase the open advocacy
of socialism; develop a significant MARXIST-LENINIST program
for the new party; and organize a collective organization of
leaders and members,

A third and fourth source advised in February, 1963,
that this new MARXIST-LENINIST party has not yet been
organized on a formal, basis, but that Progressive Labor
groups had been formed in several localities in line with
proposals of MILTON ROSEN. The sources advised as of
February, 1963, that the leaders of this group are
referring to it as the Progressive Labor Movement.

Assistant Attorney General Jobn Douglas telephoned me 7
last evening. He said, as we know, he had been assigned by: ‘the.
Attorney General to assist the Deputy Attorney General in
coordinating matters for the Department in connection with the
March on Washington scheduled for August 28, 1963. oa

-

Mr. Douglas stated that he had become concerned on reading. | :
Several memoranda from the Bureau relating activity on the part of 38 7
Communist Party members in connection with the march, Douglas noted’ * Bg
that he frankly has no idea what action the Department should take & Seg
in this regard, He said he was, therefore, contacting us for any ye z

{ advice which we might have. Re

This matter has been discussed with Assistant Director . & |
.Sullivan and we are in accord that great damage would be done to the§ <:
cause of the Communist Party if the Negro leaders of the August 28th..>
march came out forcefully denouncing the communists and rejecting—
their support, This would be a blow to the Communist Party since

it would forestall later propagandizing of their efforts in support §
of the Negroes and the demonstration, There are leaders in the Marck ®

‘On April 17, 1959, a source advised that~on
February 12, 1959, a Socialist Workers Party (SWP) minority
group, under the leadership of National Committee member,
SAM BALLAN, split from the SWP.

The source stated that this minority group, referred
to as the Marcyites, after many yars of program and policy
differenees on varied issues concerning tactics and interpreta-~
tion of political events, split from the SWP on the grounds’ that
the Party was liquidating itself by departing from the Marxist
precepts of LEON TROTSKY and retreating from the fight for the

. world socialist revolution, The final issue which ultimately
forced the split was the minority!s opposition to the SWP

. “egroupment policy which involved cooperation with the Communist
Party (CP) periphery - indiviauais characie:ized bythe minority
as petty ~- bourgeois,”

The minority program, according to the source, advo~
cates unconditional defense of the Soviet Union and has as its-
goal the building of a revolutionary party with a complete
proletarian orientation for the purpose of overthrowing capitalism
in the United States and throughout the world.

- On May 12, 1962, the source advised that this mino ity
group had chosen the name Workers World Party.

“_CENTRAL DISTRICT YOUTH CLUB

The Central District Youth Club (CDYC) came into
existence around the Ist of May, 1963. It originally con-
sisted of about twelve members, several of whom were
related to EDDIE GIVENS. The membership has grown to more’
than thirty-five and has broadened to include young people,
for. the most part, who vere attracted to it as a result of
publicity concerning its activities, The majority of members
have no conmection whatscever with the CP and are not aware
of the fact that CP members are leading the group.

The officers of the CDYC are believed to be EDDIE
GIVENS, Chairman; RAY COOPER, Vice Chairman; and CARLYN KING,

Secretary. RAY hus eomnented OG Several occasions that it

is very difficult for CP leaders to put their program

across to the group because the members of the group lack
political maturity. Activities of the CDYC, therefore, are
often instigated by the group and followed by the CP leaders

Some of the activities of the CDYC include art

classes conducted by MARGARET COOPER, who is not a CP member.

“EDDIE GIVENS, RAY COOPER (husband of MARGARET COOPER) and

CARLYN KING are members of the Communist Party.

The purpose of the CDYC is to develop the political
awareness of the people involved in order to broaden the mass
movement toward Socialism.

W.E.B. DU BOIS CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO,
aka. Du Bois Youth Group, San Francisco
Du Bois Club, San Francisco Du Bois
Youth Group, Student-Labor Alliance

———f#- source advisedthat ‘on January—31;-1963, the
W.E.B. Du Bois Club of San Francisco held its first general
meeting at: California Hall, Polk and Turk Streets, San Fran~
eisco, California. The aims of the club were put forth as
follows: :

1 + alleviate the Negro problem in the U.S.

2 - promote peaceful co-existence between
the U.S, and Russia.

3 - promote and encourage Marxist doctrines
and to bring about a cece govern~
ment in the U.S.
This organization publishes a newsletter entitled,
"San Francisco News & World Report." In its first issue,
dated March 3, 1963, there was set forth a "Proposed Statement
of Principles" in which the aforementioned aims were elaborated
upon.

In this same issue of the "San Francisco News &
World Report," the lead editorial in part describes the W.E.B.
Du Bois Club of San Francisco ‘ag "...a group of young people
who are convinced that Socialism is the only answer to the
‘many problems of our time and so find philosophical rapport
with the life and thought of Dr. Du Bois, nevertheless we are
weighted: with humility in comparing our goals and ambitions
with the genius of his life and work. As a source of
inspiration the figure of W.E.B. Du Bois is unequaled in
American history, but as a standard and example, we seem
miserably lost in his shadow. We can only resolve that we do
his name no dishonor, and-whatever we may accomplish should be
-recognized as a supplement to his life work."

The November 25, 1961, issue of the
"People's World," a West Coast communist
newspaper published weekly in San
Francisco, California, contains an

The same source advised that as of May, 1963, the
W.E.B. Du Bois Club of San Francisco has no permanent head~

on Sunday afternoon at 307 Page Street, Apartment 3, San

PORTLAND CHAPTER,
ee METHCDIST FEDERATION FOR SOCIAL ACTION, -
aka Oregon Chapter, Methodist Federation for Social Action,
Oregon Federation for Social Action

Sources familiar with this organization have advis-
ed that the Portland Chapter, Methodist Federation for Social
Action, also known as the Oregon Chapter and. the Oregon
Federation for Social Action has been in existence from
September 23, 1950, to May, 1963, and has consistently
reflected a pro-Russian, pro-communist line and that its
present leadership, including its executive board, is compos-
ed of some former Communist Party members and others who are
definitely sympathetic to the Communist Party.

The national headquarters of the Methodist Federation
for Sccial Action is located at Ardsley, New York, and a
source close to the Portland Chapter has indicated that the-
Portland Chapter of the Methodist Federation for Social
Action is the most active chapter of this organization.

existence around the Ist of May, 1963. it originally con-~
sisted of about twelve members, several of whom were
slated to EDDIZ GIVENS. The mexbership has grown to more’
thirty-five and has broadened to include young people,
the most part b5 who were attracted to it as e result of
publicity comcerning its activities. The majority of members
save mo connection whatscever with the CP and are not aware
cf the fact that CP members are leading the group.

san Tae officers of tke CDYC are bell eved to be EDDIE
givens? “Chaivtian; RAY CCOPER, Vicé* Chairman; and “ta 3 -KING,

Secretary. RAY has commented om several occasions that it

ig very difficult for CP leaders to put their oregren

acre: to the group because the members of the group lack

political maturity. Activities of the CDYC, therefore, are-—

often instigated by the group and followed by the CP leaders.

Some of the activisies of the CDYC include art’
jucted by HARGARED COOPER, who is not a CP member.

are members of the Communist Party.

t Letter to New York
RE: COMMUNIST PARTY, USA

t NEGRO QUESTION fi
L COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN RACIAL MATTERS .
100-3-116 :

without receiving the investigative attention it required,
Based on information available to your office, the importance
of this meeting and appropriate coverage thereof are obvious,
Your office is well aware that Levison, a secret member of
the Communist Party, gravitated to King, a recognized leader’
of and spokesman for millions of Negroes, some time ago, :
li Levison has applied dedication to the communist cause by
expending prodigious efforts in King’s behalf, This has
reached the point where King now consults with and depends
on Levison for guidance, King has recently adopted the pre-
cautionary measure of avoiding direct contact with Levison
and instead consults with him by using Clarence Jones, an
attorney, as an intermediary.

i The Bureau considers this to be one of the most

H important cases in the New York Office at the present time, -
A number ef recent communications from the Bureau have served
to imoress upon your office the urgency and importance being
attached by the Bureau to all aspects relating to the inves~-
tigations concerning captioned and related matters, SAC
Letier 63-556 (8) dated 10/1/63 is but one example of these
communications, 7

‘ This case should be the responsibility of ASAC Roney,
# You are thererore instructed te obtain from ANAC Roney his

i personal explanations as to the reason this meeting was not
covered, His explanations should set forth what quidance he

} hes given to this matter, as well as what remedial steps he

H intends to take to prevent a recurrence of this situation,

In addition, explanations of other responsible
personnel should be obtained and submitted along with your
personal recommendations as to administrative action, .

me about something to see whether Z could be of some agsistunce. He)
said he was really concerned about the continuing inflammatory pro-
nouncements of Jcalph DrAbernathy. i commented that he is one of the
worst, The Vice President said he has seen some of the backround material A+
on hint and he knows what tit is, but it is beyond the pale as far as execuiive 1
use is concerned, He said in view of what went on in Aucusta and other places, |
it is important ico have the information that revolved around this; the invoive-~ /
rsent of these people, what information we have, whether fleeing trom looting 9 <
or what is roing on, We asked if thereig avy infomnation avaliable,

l told him we are working on these st the present timé, both in

Augusta, Atlanta, and Jackson, where tne recent demonstrations have taken
place. said we have protty well concluded our investigation at eat tate ~~

used them or uot is a question; sone gay there was sniping and some say there a

at the troops before they fired and denials. We are interviewing all the 1d eee

Memorandum for Messrs. Tolson, ReLoach, Rosen, Sullivan, Bishop :

have a demonstration today and the Guardsines are present, but they have
been blocking Hichway No. 1 most every day. 1 said very fortunately,
they have arrested and charged three of the leaders for the damage done
te the Administration lding when they went in the other night and broke
the furniture, et cetera,

The Vice President seid what he wants to be able to de is bring
out some facts the media convesiently overlooked. I said they never rive
the things that are being done consiructively, many times by students, to ~
try to prevent this, but they ernphasize all therthings: these jerks are doing.

The Vice Presidext said he saw 2 picture about Augusta showing
some of the Necrces jumping out of store windows with loot and becty and ra
fleeing and you never hear anything about that. He said whatever icancive - +
him that can ameliorate some of the impact; that he understands some of
these things are wrong and we are probably going te find some of the shootines
showed too much force, but none the less, the people have to understand
the very thrust of the newspaper articles is that a bunch of police shot down
six Negroes and what happened before -- why did they shoot at them --~ not

ust because they felt like killing people. I said they were severely provoked
£ Kenffand we will finish Augusta, Atlanta, and Jackson this week,

Tteld the Vice President 1 was sending te him t ednesday, the
material Kent Crane asked for, which gives in summary the material we
have sent in detaif] - :

The vice President said he thought he was going to have to start
destroying Abernathy's credibility, so anything I can give him would be
appreciated. [I told him I would be glad te, (Cena i was the only one who
spokes out against Uartin Luther King and | got kell, but I did not give a dama

MAY, 1970

The Jackson State College, a state-supported
coeducational Negro institution with a student body of
approximately 5,000, is located in the Negro area of
Jackson, Mississippi, about one mile from downtown Jackson.
This college has been the scene of student dsturbances
in past years. In recent months sources of this Bureau
have advised that many students at the school had acquired
firearms and were retaining them in their dormitories. The
Dean of Men reportedly expressed his concern in this regard
to a gathering of students several weeks ago.

On the night of May 13, 1970, a crowd of approximately
100 students, protesting United States involvement in Cambodia
and chanting antiwhite slogans, gathered on Lynch Street,
which intersects the main campus, and threw rocks and bricks
at passing motor vehicles occupied by white persons. One
“motorist and one bystander were injured. The crowd subse-
quently increased to about 700 persons, made up mostly of
students, According to a source, a number of black hoodlum-
type youths, many of them "high" on Liquor or narcotics,
joined the students in the disorder. Members of the crowd
threw objects at Negro campus police officers and at campus
buildings, causing extensive window damage to dormitories and
classrooms. Numerous pistol shots reportedly were fired into
the air and at some buildings and motor vehicles by mob members.
The disturbance was brought to a‘halt at about 2 a.m., May 14,
Tolson 1970, when a combined force of city police officers and
waters state troopers entered the campus at the request of the eollege
Siti President, John A. Peoples, Jr. Fourteen persons were arrested,
Casper including seven students, and all were charged with carrying
concealed weapons, RA)

Jackson, Mississippi

May, 1970 |

tet 7 Disorder again oceurred on the night of
May 14, 1970, when a erowd of about 60 Negroes, including
many nonstudents, assembled near Alexander Hall, a girls’
dormitory which Eaces Lynch Street. Members of the crowd
renewed their attacks on white-nceupied motor vehicles
with rocks and bricks. A source advised saveral tavern |
owners received anonymyis telephone calls at this time
urging them to spread the rumor that Mississippi civil
rights leader Charles Evers and his family had been killed.
By 11:30 p.m. the disorderly crowd had grown to over 200.
A dump truck was set afire and police units meved into
the area to clear the crowd to enable the fire department
to extinguish the blaze.

Police reported that from the time they arrived
in the area they were subjected to abusive language and
became targets for rocks and bottles from the crowd of
Negroes. Police also reported sniper fire coming from
Stewart Hall, a men's dormitory also incated on Lynch Street.
A newsman reportedly stated that while following a fire

- truck on foot he heard a volley of shots and was told the
shots were coming from a sniper located between two school
buildings. One officer claimed he heard six small caliber
shots in the area of Stewart Hall at the time the truck
fire was being extinguished.

At about 12:15 a.m., Mey 15, 1970, a large
contingent of city police officers and state troopers in
riot gear, carrying rifles and shotguns, who had moved
on to the campus reportedly was approached by a mob of
about 200 students near Alexander Hall. The police fired
three tear gas canisters at the crowd forcing it to retreat.
The crowd, however, again came toward the police line
hurling bottles and other objects, at which time the police

allegedly npened fire. Two witnesses stated they heard

“the crash nf a bottle and one small gunshot or firecracker

just before the police fired. One officer reported that
at about the seme time he saw a muzzle flash in a window
of Alexander Hall and another officer stated he saw a
streak of fire emanate from a top window of another
school building. Police reportedly entered Alexander Hall
where they allegedly fired several shots.

As a result of the gunfire two Negrees, Phillip Gibbs,
age 21, a Jackson State College student, and James Earl Green,
ae high school student, died. Ten other Negroes were wounded,
three critically. Five Negrees, as well as three state
troopers and iwo Jacksou police officers, suffered otiier
forms of injuries, minor in nature.

Two additional arrests of Negroes were made on
the night of May 14, 1970, one being charged with carrying
@ concealed weapon and the other for assaulting a police
officer, Property damage in the two nights of disorder

. from vandalism involving extensive window breakage has been

estimated at $8,000 to $10,000. Some window breakage and
damage to walls was also reported as a result of the gunfire.

A contingent of about 400 National Guardsmen who
had been on standby in the area aided police in restoring
order shortly after the gunfire had ended. A group of about
100 students went to the residence of the college president
and demanded to see him but upon his refusal, they dispersed
and caused no further disturbance.

Complete details regarding the disorder at

Jackson State College and the circumstances surrounding the
shootings are not yet available. State and local investigations

satisfied with the Mayor's response, The biggest demand
of the Negro leaders was for amnesty for all individuals
arrested during the disorder, The Mayor agreed to make an
effort regarding the amnesty grant but indicated that
individuals arrested on State charges were beyond his
control.

During the evening hours of May 12, 1970, local
authorities reported minor isolated sporadic outbursts
of violence in Augusta but there was no organized effort
to repeat the previous night's violence, One 17-year-old
Negro male looter was shot and wounded during the evening
hours of May 12, 1970. At 4:45 a.m. on May 13, 1970, the
Augusta Police Department reported that all was quiet in the
eity with only a few arrests for curfew violations and
intoxication.

Department advised that preliminary information received
by the police indicated that of the six individuals killed
during the rioting, three were shot by police while looting;
two others were found in the street by police after being
shot by unknown persons; and one individual was killed by
fellow looters.

MILITANT STATEMENTS Mape By 1 ~ Mr. Glass

RALPH DAVID ABERNATHY,
PRESIDENT OF THE
SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE

Abernathy purports to advocate nonviolence but
has made a number of statements which, while not directly
advocating violence, certainly invite violence, Examples
of these statements follow.

In May, 1968, at the beginning of the Poor
People's Campaign, a massive march on Washington, D. C.,
sponsored by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,
Abernathy told an audience in Atlanta, Georgia, "I don't
want anyone to expect me to be Martin Luther King, Jr. [I
say, to the Nation, to the United States, with Ralph Abernathy
you"ve got hell on your hands," In the same month in
Birmingham, Alabama, Abernathy said,"Under Doctor King we
were just going to rock the boat, but under the leadership
of Doctor Ralph Abernathy, I'm going to go.’@ step farther.
We're going to turn this Nation upside-down and right side
up." :

In May, 1968, at a speech in Atlanta, Georgia,
Abernathy referred to an unpaid bill for generations of
5 irresponsibility, oppression and neglect. He said,"The bill
is going to be collected =» willingly or unwillingly, in
civilized decency and love or in fear and hate and the flames
of destruction, Time is not;tupning ovt} but :rather; time has
run,dut." so on

MILITANT STATEMENTS MADE BY RALPH DAVID ABERNATHY,
_ PRESIDENT OF THE SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN. LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE

According to the Chicago Tribune August 30, 1968,
Abernathy addressed 3,000 peace demonstrators in Grant Park,
Chicago, Illinois, on August 29,.1968, during the time the
Democratic Convention was being held in Chicago, He referred
to police officers as "pigs" as black extremists regularly
do and said that nothing was taking place on the Convention
floor, He then added, "But the Lord knows itctfs happening here, -
and more will take place because:-we are going to sock it
to ‘em, baby," referring to clashes which had already occurred
between demonstrators and police.

In May, 1969, apparently angered at what he
considered a poor reception received by his poor people's
delegation from the Nixon Administration, Abernathy said time
was running out on nonviolence as an approach to solving the
Nation's problems, He said,"I do not know:hbwmuvhiléngerr
nonviolence can be effective in this country. If the Nation
falls to display some consideration (for the people), then I
tremble for my America." He added that if the I xdan:Administration
fails to hear nonviolent voices, then they will have to listen
to violent voices, 2 +

In September, 1969, while speaking in Atlanta,
Georgia, Abernathy said the country is "on the verge of political
repression and possibly even bloody revolution." He warned
that “there is a limit to people's endurance of injustice and
America is rapidly approaching that limit." .

On August 13, 1969, Abernathy emphatically embraced
and endorsed a plan for counseling young men to refuse to be
drafted into military service, The plan was presented to the
Annual Convention of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference
in Charleston, South Cammlina.

Abernathy's inconsistency in his nonviolent posture

is matched by the same attribute in the personal conduct of
this preacher,

NW 68262 Docld:32989649 Page 376



MILITANT STATEMENTS MADE BY RALPH DAVID ABERNATHY,
PRESIDENT OF THE SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE

On the ‘night of August 29, 1953, Abernathy
dashed from his church office in Montgomery, Alabama,
pursued by an irate husband wielding a hatchet who accused
Abernathy of having a relationship with his wife, The
wife of the assailant told a Montgomery Circuit Court jury
in November, 1958, that she had submitted to unnatural sex
acts with Abernathy before her marriage, beginning at the
age of 15, and that "He never stopped chasing me" even
after her marriage. She had been a member of Abernathy's
church, The jury reportedly deliberated only ten ininutes
before acquitting the husband of charges ,in connection with
his attack on Abernathy.”

During the Poor People's Campaign in Washington, D. C.,
Abernathy was headquartered at the Pitts Motor Hotel in
Washington, D. C., while his followers were mired in the mud
in Resurrection City, a shantytown near the Lincoln Memorial.
This became a point of contention among his followers and on
one occasion Abernathy slept at Resurrection City. However,
he returned to the Pitts Motor Hotel during the night after
suffering 'stomach pains." . so Ei

Abernathy has eeporead the violence=prone Black
Panther Party. In the latter part of 1969 he made several
public statements favorable to the Black Panthers, On
April 20, 1970, Abernathy urged liberal and progressive forces
to joina rally on behalf of the Black Panthers at New Haven,
Connecticut, on May 1, 1970.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

Focus on New Raven

Y ny signs now indicate that the possibility for
_vacial vio’ snce, acts of destruction, and even assassination
in New Hav n, Connecticut, will increase sharply in the
coming wee s and months. The basis for this dire prediction
as the all out effort being made by the violence-prone, black
extremist, and pro-liarxist Black Panther Party (BPP) to make
. New Haven a center of operations for the BPP and a rallying
point for black extremists and white radicals in order to
whip up support for BPP National Chairman Bobby Seale.
Preliminary hearings have been held in New Haven this month
Zor the forthcoming trial in which Seale and other Panthers
are charged with the murder of Alex Rackley, a BPP member
ixom New York City whose mutilated and tortured body was
found *n a swamp near Middlefield, Connecticut, last May
aitor the DEP judged ulm to ue u police informants (NH airtel
4/14/70 ve Possible Racial Violence)
"New Haven Will Burn"

In early March, 1970, information was received that
new operational instructions were to be forwarded-clandestinely
to BPP chapters. Among other things, each chapter was to
furnish a list of sympathizers who have had military experience
‘for the purpose of establishing a school in the United States
for training in guerrilla warfare. ‘The chapters were also to
try to place sympathizers in positions in jaw enforcement and
commit burglaries to obtain firearms and funds to further BPP
programs, About the same time, Douglas Miranda,. BPP Area
Captain in New Haven, stated that each BPP chapter would be
requested to send two representatives, preferably those having
a knowledge of explosives, to New Haven while Seale is there
for the trial. Miranda said that every effort would be made
te prevent Seale's conviction, but if these efforts were

we ), hot successful “New Haven will burn." (SOG LHM 3/10/70 re BPP)

anything happens to Seale "there will not be any lights for
days in this country...not only will we burn buildings, we
will take lives, we will blow up buildings, we will kill
jJudges...." He stressed what was expected of young white
revolutionists in these words: "If they feé1 that they want
to do what t'ey've already been doing in terms of explosives,
then they s} wild do that. If they want to assassinate judges
then they s ovld do that. If you don't want black peaple to
just go out in the street and indiscriminately murder white
people or ‘ice versa, then I think it is necessary for us to
come toget er around the issue of trying to free Bobby."
Hilliard a ied, "we've going to unleash a race war on the
pigs of America and it's up to you, as white revolutionisits,
"
to support the struggle of black people, (NH airtel 4/15/70 re BPP

Counterattack and Annihilate

Similar inflammatory themes have been featured in
recent issues of "The Black Panther," weekly BPP newspaper.
For example, BPP Minister of Information Eldridge Cleaver,
who is a fugitive from justice and self-exiled in Algeria,

i Wrote “R the Maych 7 issues “We, Biucsw peuple, if we are
forced te go it alone, must be prepared to unleash the vitimate
political consequence upon this racist nation. The ultimate
political consequence which Black people have in their power
to unleash is RACE WAR....This is the political consequence
which America faces because of this unspeakable evil attempt
to murder Chairman Bobby Seale in the Electric Chair." The
April 18 issue contains instructions for cleaning shoulder
weapons, for firearms training, and for making -Melotov cock-
tails and hand grenades, This issue also carries a comment
by Randy Williams on the jailing of David Hilliard and BPP
Minister of Culture Emory Douglas in New Haven for contempt
of court. Williams, who is in custody of the Oakland,
California, Police Department for “unprovoked ambush and
wounding of" four Oakland police officers on April 17,

1970, wrote: ‘"Counterattack by any means necessary. Fascist
America will soon dread the birthday and curse the name of
the fascist pig judge in Connecticut....ORDERS: Destroy the
spirit of the fascist forces;seek out and annihilate them
wherever they are found.” ~

Shoot to Kili

The New Haven BPP chapter's "People's News Service"
picked up the theme of race war in its April 5 issue when it
stated: "...But when niggers take to the streets it's shoot _

to kill. When pigs go after Panthers it's destroy all,

kill all. The only solution to our problem is dead pigs

from the three levels of oppression, the demagogic politicians,
avaricious businessmen, and the racist pig cops.” In this
connection, a rumor was spread through the ghetto area of

New Haven that Arnold Markle, State's Attorney who is
prosecuting the BPP case,will be murdered if Seale is
convicted. Another rumor calis for the kidnaping of someone
in the office of the Attorney General of the United States

who would be held for the release of Seale if Seale is
convicted.(NH tt 3/26/70 re BPP; SF tt 4/6/70 re BPP)

“Glant May Day Celebration"

There are other ominous signs. Jon Turner, BPP
activist from the West Coast is in New Haven, Turner, who
is viewed as a possible bombing suspect by the Berkeley,
California, Police Departmen, has told West Coast associates
taat his education and skilis would be useful in New Haven
and that a “big thing," a "giant May Day celebration" is
pianned for May 1 in New Haven. Turner added that in
New Haven things are "uptight," the community is mobilized,
and itS going to get hot. Elbert "Big Man" Howard, BPP
Deputy Minister of Information, has also mentioned a rally
in Rew Haven on May 1, and has said that even school children
in New Haven axe determined to keep Bobby Seale from the

. @lectric chair. At a rally held at Yale University on
April 14, Howard stated that the black community "must meet
Kidnaping with kidnaping; killing with killing." If the

- Panthers are convicted, Howard predicted, "You will have a
flood of crazy niggers in your streets." (yH tts 4/14, 16, 20/70
re BPP
Trouble at Yale

As for Yale University, the campus is tense as the
Panthers go all out to get student support, Earlier this
month, Elbert Howard wanted Robert Scheer, foetmer editor of the
xabidly anti-United States magazine, "Ramparts," to come to
New Haven to lead a three-day strike at Yale University and
to demand of Yale $500,000 for the "Bobby Seale Defense Fund."
Panthers in New Haven are distributing pamphlets, brochures,
and "The Black Panther" widely on the Yale campus to rally
support. On April 20, David Dellinger of the New Mobilization
Committee to End the Way in Vietnam and Reverend Ralph Abernathy

of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference held a press ;
conference concerning the mass rally scheduled to be heid in ,
New Haven on May 1, 1970, and said they expected support

from Yale students. An unidentified Negro told a group of

Yale students on April 17, "If you don't close Yale down in

two weeks, we have the means to do it ourselves." On the ~

night of Apr 1 21, the Yale Student Senate agreed to ‘ta vote

for a yolun’ ary strike to express concern for justice and

the rights" of the Panthers charged with the murder of

Alex Racklt 7. On April 22, about 80 per cent of Yale's

students w 7e on strike. (yH tts 4/16, 17, 20/70 re BPP)

Neapons and Ammunition Stockpiles

The volatile statements and threats of the Panthers
cannot be dismissed as mere rhetoric or propaganda. ft has
been reported, for example, that Robert Webb, New York City
Panther, has been placed in charge of a team of specialists
in demolition and firearms. A Meriden, Connecticut, police
officer apprehended six young Negroes on April & after a gun
shop hed been burglarized, On the previous night, 19 weapons
were Stolen from the same shop. ‘‘nere is ample reason to
believe that these stolen weapons were to be delivered to the
BPP in New Haven. Furthermore, Boston Panthers have been
purchasing arms and large quantities of ammunition for
delivery to New Haven. The purchases, the bulk of which
were made on April 17, inciuded five rifles, one shotgun,
one carbine, and nearly 30,900 rounds of ammunition,
including 23,000 rounds for high-powered rifles. (NH tt 4/9/70

Memorandum for Mr. Sullivan :
RE: THREAT OF RACIAL VIOLENCE
NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT

"United Illuminating, Olin Mathiesen, and United Nuclear would be bombed out."
He stated he had alerted officials of these companies as well as the Atomic
Energy Commission and local authorities.

Information was received in February that dynamite was lécated
at BPP headquarters in New Haven. Recently a source advised that at least
two members of each BPP chapter in the country (BPP organizations
are located in about 40 cities) should proceed to New Haven and that preference
should be given to members having explosives and demolition experience.

Violent statements by BPP leaders have already caused minor
disturbances in New Haven. Following the jailing of two BPP officials on
contempt of court charges during preliminary proceedings in the BPP trial
on 4/14/70, a group of blacks bike windows and created disturbances in
downtown New Haven. Several days later, a group of about 300 high school
students, most of them Negroes, who had been demonstrating in front of
the courthouse ran through the downtown area shoving and pushing shoppers
and damaging property. On 4/22/70, a local BPP leader created a disturbance
at a high school forcing the temporary closing of the school when fires were
started and windows broken by rampaging students.

Reports indicate BPP gaining support of Yale University student
groups. Leaders of the BPP have been active on the Yale campus where
many of their threats of violence have been voiced. They have indicated
they expect strong support from Yale students in the 5/1 rally and have
threatened to close Yale down if a demand of $500, 000 from the University
to be used in defense of Connecticut Panthers is not met. A threat was made
to take over the rare book library at Yale.

On 4/22/70, ten of twelve undergraduate colleges at Yale voted to
strike in support of the Panthers. Yesterday approximately 500 striking
students staged a march to the residence of the University president and
‘then held a brief peaceful rally. A peaceful "civil disobedience" demonstration
called for by Yale Chaplain William Sloane Coffin, Jr., during which Coffin
and othexSwould subject themselves to arrest scheduled to be held on 4/24/70
has been postponed to be held, according to Coffin, in abeyance for possible
future use.

A New York source advised that the National Lawyers Guild, cited as a

the Women's Liberation Movement, a militant women's rights group, will
participate in the BPP activities in New Haven and at Yale beginning on
5/1/70, The source also reported that the December 4th Movement, a radical
student group of 25 to 50 members at Columbia University, New York City, .

to have a drivers permit and the other two for trespass.
Two of the individuals were from Boston, Mass. The police
found various pieces of literature pertaining to the BPP
rally in theautomobile of the arrested persons. They also
found a map of the City of New Haven on which several -
locations, including National Guard Armories, a shopping
mall, the Yale University Bowl, and an office building
housing the FBI office, had been marked. Also found in
the vehicle were numerous electrical and plumbing-type
tools and general instruction manuals pertaining to water
“and electrical systems.

BPP Continues to Receive Outside Support. A source advised
on 4726770 that an individual unknown to him who identified
himself as a member of the Weatherman, the violence-—prone
faction of anarchistic Students for a Democratic Society
(SDS), had contacted the leader of the New Haven Panther
Defense Committee and informed him that he was “looking for
some action." He was told that the best bet for some

"action" was “chief pig Ahern" (Chief of Police in New Haven).

Another source reported on 4/25/70 that two members
of the BPP had visited State University of New York (SUNY),
Stony Brook, New York, that date to confer with Ira Wechsler,
a reported member of the Progressive Labor Party, a pro-
Chinese Marxist organization; Arthur Mitchell, a black
.activist at SUNY; and Mitchell Cohen, a former student and
SDS member, The purpose of the meeting was to plan a
| caarain to begin today to raise money for Bobby Seale and
to rent buses to transport individuals to New Haven to attend
the trial of the BPP members. A source also reported that
one Cathy Schindler of the Union Theological Seminary in
New York City has indicated that she will contact divinity
colleges in that area to gain support for the BPP defendants.

On Saturday, a peaceful rally in support of the
.BPP was staged by about 200 white college-age persons near
the Superior Court Building in New Haven,

Dear Mr. Nassikas:

I thought you might be interested in the
following information concerning the, increasing activity
of the extremist and violence-prone “Black-Panther Party
in the New England area which poses a potential threat

jOoTS

to electrical power installations throughout the country. p

The Black Panther Party is currently engaged in
@ massive campaign in New Haven, Connecticut, in support
of its Chalrman Bobby Seale and other Black Panther Party
members who face trial there for the killing’ of a fellow
Panther in May, 1969, The main propaganda phase of this
campaign is that Seale is a political prisoner who is
being railroaded to the electric chair, The Black Panther
Party claims that he will never be electrocuted because it
will turn off all the electricity and let the flame of
liberatien light the sky, This theme of shutting off the
electricity is contimially preached by the Black Panther
Party in speeches by its members and in the articles and
cartoons appearing in its newspaper, "The Black Panther,"
Approximately 139,000 copies of the newspaper are being
printed each x

Although this threat against electrical power
systems appears to be pure propaganda at present, it is
quite possible that individual members of this extremist
organization could be incited to committing a destructive
act against a power installation. You will, of course,
be advised of any specific threat developed in this regard.

For your additional information, there is
enclosed herewith a Current Intelligence Analysis dated
April 24, 1970, which contains details of the Black
Panther varty campaign currently underway in New Haven,
Connecticut.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY !

Focus on New Haven

Many signs now indicate | that the possibility for
racial violence, acts of destruction, and even assassination
in New Haven, Connecticut, will increase sharoly in the
coming weeks and months, The basis for this dire prediction
is the all-out effort belng made by the violence-prone, black
extrenist, and pro~lMarxist Black Panther Party (BPP) to make
New Haven a center of operations for the ae and a rallying
point for black extremists and white radicais’ in order to |
whip up support for EPP National Chairman pices Seale.
Preliminary hearings have been heid in New Haven this month

eEeEes . for the forthcoming trial in which Seale and other Panthers

: are charged with the murdey of Alex Rackley, a BPP member
from New York City whese mutilated and tortured kody was
found in a _ swamp near Middlefield, Connecticut, last May
after the DEP judged him iv be a police inzormant. (NU airtel
4/14/70 re Possible Racial Violence) ca

“New Haven Will Burn"

In early March, 1970, information was received that
néw operational instructions were to be forwarded-clandestinely
to BPP chapters. Among other things, each chapter was to
furnish a list of sympathizers who have had military experience

i . ‘for the purpose of establishing a school in the United States .
for training in guerrilla warfare. The chapters were algo to
try to place sympathizers in positions in low enforcement and
commit burglaries to obtain firearms and funds to further BPP
programs, About the same time, Douglas Miranda,. BPP Area
Captain in New Haven, stated that each BPP chanter would he
requested to send two representatives, preferably those having
a knowledge of explosives, to New Haven while Seale is there
for the trial, Miranda said that every effort would be made
to prevent Seale's conviction, but if these efforts were

}, mot successful "New Haven will burn.” (soc LEM 3/10/70 re BPP)

anything happens to Seale "there will not be any lights for

H days in this country...n0t only will we burn buildings, we

: revolutionists in these words: "If they feclL that they want
A to do what they've already been doing in terms of explosives,
| then they should do that. If they want to assassinate judges
then they should do that. If you don't want black people to
just go out in the street and indiscriminately murder white
people or vice versa, then I think it is necessary for us to
i come together around the issue of trying to free Eobby."

J Hilliard added, "we're going to unleash a race war on the

y pigs of America and it's up to you, as white revolutionists,
* " :

‘to support the struggle of iaatenl people, (NH. airtel 4/15/70 re BP?

j Counterattack and Annihilate
Similar inflammatory themes have been featured in
“ecent issues. of "The Black Panther," weekly BPP newspaper.
For example, BPP Minister of Information Bldridge Cleaver,
iy who is a fugitive from justice and self-exiled in Algeria,
| wrote in the March 7 issue: “We, Black peopie, it we are
fl forced to go it alone, must be prepared to unleash the ultimate
political consequence upon this racist nation. The ultimate
| political consequence which Black people have in their power
H to unleash is RACH WAR....This is the political consequence
| which America faces because of this unspeakable evil attempt

to murder Chairman Bobby Seale in the Electric Chair." The
April 18 issue contains instructions for cleaning shoulder
weapons, for firearms training, and for making Molotov cock-
tails and hand grenades, This issue also carries a comment
by Randy Williams on the jailing of David Hilliard and BPP

I : Minister of Culture Emory Douglas in New Haven for contempt
I of court. Williams, who is in custody of the Oakland,
California, Police Denartment for “unprovoked ambush and
wounding of" four Oakland police officers on April 17,

1970, wrote: “Counterattack by any means necessary. Tascist
dmerica will soon dread the birthday and curse the name of
the fascist pig judge in Connecticut....ORDERS: Destroy the
spirit of the fascist forces;seek out and annihilate them

| wherever they are found,” : N

Shoot to Kill

The New Haven BPP chapter's "People's News Service"
picked up the theme of race war in its April 5 issue when it
: : stated ",..But when niggers take to the streets it's shoot

to kill, When pigs go after Panthers it's destroy all,
kill all. The only solution to our problem is dead pigs
from the three levels of oppression, the demagogic politicians,
avaricious businessmen, and the racist:pig cops." In this

~—~_ connection, a rumor was spread through the ghetto area of
New'Haven that Arnold Markle, State's Attorney who is
prosecuting the BPP case,will be murdered if Seale is a ‘
convicted. Another rumor calis for the kidnaping of someone
in the office of the Attorney General of the United States
who would be held Zor the release of Seale if Seale is
convicted.(NH tt 3/26/70 re BPP; SF tt 4/6/70 re BPP)

w

"Giant May Day Celebration"

There. are other ominous signs, Jon Turner, BPP
activist from the West Coast is in New Tiaven. Turner, who
is viewed as a possible bombing suspect by the Berkeley,
California, Police Departmert, has told West Coast associates
that his cducation and skilis would be useful in Hew Haven
and that a “big thing," a "giant Hay Day celebration" is
planned for May 1 in New Maven. Turner added that in
New Haven things are “uptight, the comnunity is mobilized,
and its going to get hot. Elbert “Big Man" Howard, BPP
Deputy Minister of Information, has also mentioned a rally
in Kew Haven on May 1, and has said that even school children
in New Haven are determined to keep Bobby Seale from the
electric chair, At a rally held at Yale University on
April 14, Howard stated that the black community "must meet
kidnaping with kidnaving; killing with killing." If the
Panthers are convicted, Howard predicted, "You will have a
flood of crazy niggers in your strects," (NH tts 4/14, 16, 20/70
re BPP) FH anus

‘Trouble at Yale

As for Yale University, the campus is tense as the
Panthers fo all cut to fet student support. Earlier this
month, Elbert Howard wanted Robert Scheer, Zotner editor of the
rabidly anti-United States'magazine, "Ramparts,'' to come to
New Haven to lead a three-day strike at Yale University and
to demand of Yale $500,000 for the "Dobby Sexle Defense Fund,"
Panthers in New Haven are distributing pamphiets, brochures,
and "The Biack Panther" widely on the Yale campus to vally
support. On April 20, David Dellinger of the New Mobilization
Committee to End the War in Vietnam and Reverend Ralph Abernathy

of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference held a press
conference concerning the mass rally scheduled to be held in
New Haven on May 1, 1970, and said they expected support
from Yale students, An unidentified Negro told a group of
Yale students on April 17, "FZ you don't close Yale down in
two weeks, we have the means to do it ourselves." On the
night of April 21, the Yale Student Senate agreed to “a vote
fora yoluntary strike to express concern for justice and
the rights" of the Panthers charged with the murder of

Alex Rackley. On April 22, about 80 per cent of Yale's

students were on strike. (NH tts 4/16, 17, 20/70 re BPP)

Weapons and Ammunition Stockpiles

The volatile. statements and threats of the Panthers
cannot be dismissed as mere rhetoric or propaganda. It has
been reported, for example, that Robert Webb, New York City
Panther, has been placed in charge of a team of specialists.
in demolition and firearms. A Meriden, Connecticut, police
officer apprehended six young Negroes on April 8 after a gun
shop had been burglarized. On the previous night, 19 weapons
were stolen from tne same shop, ‘There is ample reason to
believe that these stolen weapons were to be delivered to the
BPP in Rew Haven. Furthermore, Boston Panthers have been
purchasing arms and large quantities of ammunition for
delivery to Rew Haven. The purchases, the buik of which
were made on April 17, included five rifles, one shotgun,

one carbine, and nearly 30,0900 rounds o£ ammunition,
including 23,000 rounds for high-powered rifles. (NH tt 4/9/70

eo t

A. Géheral Situation

Many signs indicate that the possibility for racial
violence, acts of destruction, and even assassination in New
Haven, Connecticut, is increasing sharply. The basis for
this is the all-out effort being made by the extremist Black
Panther Party (BPP) to make New Haven a center of operations
for the BPP and a rallying point for black extremists and
white radicals in order to whip up support for BPP National
Chairman Bobby Seale and other BPP members who are facing
trial on a murder charge. Many outside groups, including a
4° large portion of the Yale University student body, are

F lending support to the BPP, and reports disclose that these
groups will undoubtedly participate in massive demonstrations
which are scheduled to take place in New Haven for several
days beginning on Hay 1, 1970. A source advised on April 26,
1970, that an individual not known to him had informed the
national headquarters of the BPP that 50,000 persons would
take part in the demonstrations in New Haven next weekend,

B, Threats of Violence

On March 18, 1970, BPP Chief of Staff David Hilliard,
in an address before 2,000 persons at the Univérsity of
Connecticut, threatened that if anything happens to Seale,
"There will not be any lights for days in this country...Not
only will we burn buildings, we will take lives, we will biow
up buildings, we will kill judges..." He stressed what was
expected of young white revolutionists in these words, "If
they feel that they want to do what they have already been
.deing in terms of explosives, then they should do that. If
they want to assassinate judges, they should do that. If
you don't want black people to just go out in the street and
indiscriminately murder white pecple or vice versa, then I

think it's necessary for us to come together around the issue

of trying to free Bobby." Hilliard said “We're going to unleash
® race war on the pigs of America and it's up to you as white
revolutionists to support the struggle of black people."

recent issues of "The Black Panther," weekly BPP newspaper,
and in Ministry of Information Bulletins prepared by the
Connecticut State BPP, Examples of this are included in
~~the attached copy of Ministry of Information Bulletin,

Nuuber 15, which, among other things, contains a photograph

of the Chief of Police at New Haven with the caption "Wanted

bs Dead." Reportedly, 10,000 to 12,000 copies of these Bulletins
are distributed throughout the State of Connecticut, as well
as in New York City and Boston, Massachusetts, weekly. The
April 18 issue of "The Black Panther" carries an article by
Randy Williams who wrote, "Counterattack by any means necessary.
Fascist America will soon dread the birthday and, curse the
name of the fascist pig judge in Connecticut...ORDERS: Destroy
the spirit of the fascist force; seek out and annihilate them
wherever they are found."

2" . Stockpiling of Arms and Ammunition

On April 21, 1970, a source advised that he had been
contacted numerous times by John LaPort, a member of the New
Haven Panther Defense Committee, requesting that he be prepared
to buy large amounts of weapons and ammunition for use by the
New Haven Panther Defense Committee in the upcoming “revolution.”
He indicated he had $3,000 with which to purchase weapons.

According to reports from sources, BPP members in
Boston, Massachusetts, have been buying guns and large
quantities of ammunition in recent weeks for use in New Haven.
dohn Pinderhughes, 2 Boston Panther, has been one of the
largest purchasers of ammunition in the Boston area.

The weapons reported purchased have included five
rifles, one shotgun, and one carbine. The ammunition purchased
has included 4,400 rounds of .30 caliber, 1,700 rounds of &mm,
H §80.vrounds of .44 caliber, and 150 rounds of .00 buckshot. A
source reported that the ammunition purchased by Pinderhughes
was delivered to BPP headquarters in New Haven on April 20,
1970, by dames Wilson, a white male who has been involved in
BPP activity.

A source advised on April 22, 1970, John Wayne Thomas,
a Boston Panther, had made it known that he is trying to obtain
magazines for automatic weapons and said he has 75 9mm automatic
weapons.

A report was received by the Connecticut State

Police on April 27, 1970, that 280 shotguns and 80 rifles were
atolen from a trucking company in North Branford, Connecticut,
_ this past weekend, Worth Branford is near New Haven. The
~company truck in which these weapons were carried away was
found_abandoned and empty near Throggs Neck, New York, on
April” 27, 1970. A theft of 44 rifles was also reported by

a company in Newington, Connecticut, over the weekend. No
suspects in these thefts have been developed,

On April 26, 1970, a source advised that Douglas
Miranda, a New Haven BPP leader, has instructed a member to
obtain 100 sand bags for use at the New Haven BPP headquarters.
A source has also reported that Miranda was attempting to
obtain 1,000 "bags" as quickly as possible as "a matter of
life and death," stating "they" had to get “the stuff prepared
7 by Friday." The source was unable to learn the specific nature
4 z er purpose of the “bags."*

D. Use of Explosives

The use of dynamite and other explosives by BPP
members and their sympathizers in the New Haven situation
is a strong possibility. Information was received in February
that dynamite was Jocated at BPP headquarters in New Haven.
A source advised on April 16, 1970, that Robert Webb, a New
York Panther, has been placed in charge of a team of specialists
in demolition and firearms. Another source reported that the
BPP recently issued instructions for at least two members of
each BPP chapter in the country (BPP organizations are located
in about 40 cities) to proceed to New Haven in connection with
the Panther murder trial, and that preference should be given
to members having explosives and demolition experience. Jon
Turner, a black extremist from Berkeley, California, who is
a bombing suspect of the Berkeley Police Department, was
recently in New Haven, reportedly to aid in the activity
there by utilizing his skills as an expiosives expert,
Indications are that he will return to New Haven.

A source reported on April 19, 1970, that he had
been informed that two members of the Weatherman faction of
the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) will be furnishing
dynamite to the BPP and their cause.. On April 27, 1976,
Robert Goldstein, a professed conscientious objector sympathetic
to "the movement," but a believer in nonviclence, advised that

i SECREP-
- NW 68262 Docid:32989649 Page 481



at a party attended by people in "the movement" in New York City
on April 24, 1970, an individual named Lee Doyle, who is employed
at a chemical warehouse in New Haven, has stated he plans to
use his residence in New Haven as a gathering place where
individuals coming into that city will be able to store explo<-

. sives and weapons to be used in the demonstrations beginning

Fes May 1, 1970, Doyle reportedly stated that he was obtaining
liquid nitroglycerin and will be able to furnish it to anyone
who needed it.

On April 23, 1970, an Office of the United Nuclear
Corporation in New Haven reported that a former employee
informed him that he had overheard on April 22, 1970, a
conversation among six Negroes at a barroom in New Haven who
were discussing the May demonstrations and, specifically,
; heard them say that "United Illuminating, Olin Mathiesen,
Pa ‘and United Nuclear would be bombed out."

On April 28, 1970, police searching a New Haven
residence known as Radcliff Hall, a Yale University building,
seized chemical components capable of destroying a large-size
building when properly combined, Also seized were numerous
homemade smoke bombs. An 18syear~old former Yale student,
dames K, Hernes, who had been expelled for radical activity,
was arrested. Gregory Welis, aged 22, was aiso arrested,
Both were charged with possession of explosives with intent
to destroy property and persons.

' E. Demonstrations Scheduled for May 1, 2, and. 3, 1970
| A chief cause of concern in the New Haven situation
| at the present time is the massive raily which the BPP and
\ its sympathizers are planning for May 1, 2, and 3, 1970,
: .. Reports indicate that 30,000 to 56,000 persons are expected
| to participate in a wide variety of activity over the three=
| Say period, Such activity over this extended period could

: well result in confrontations between the demonstrators and
law enforcement agencies and could tax the strength of the
police agencies.

i. Schedule of Activities
An informant advised that at a meeting of the Committee
- to Defend the Panther 21 in New York City on April 26, 1970, it

was indicated that the following would he the schedule of activities

2, Make-up of Demonstration Participants

The radical groups planning to join the large number
of Black Panthers in the three-day affair at New Haven leave
no doubt that the situation is fraught with danger. Groups
which have indicated that they will participate include SDS
and its violence-prone Weatherman faction. On April 26, 1970,
an individual who identified himseif as a member of the
Weatherman faction contacted the leader of the New Haven
Panther Defense Committee and informed him that he was
“Looking fox'some action." He was told that the best het:
for some “action was "Chief Pig Ahern" (Chief of Police in
New Haven).

On the basis of information received from sources,
the following -is' the number of Black Panthers and members
of radical groups who ere presently in the New Haven area

the Women's Liberation Movement, a militant women's rights
group. A source also reported that the December 4 Movement,

a vadical student group of 35 to 50 members at Columbia
University in New York City, will also take part and will
urge others to join it.

On April 25, 1970, two members of the BPP visited
State University of New York (SUNY), Stony Brook, New York,
to confer with Ira Wechsler, a reported member of the
Progressive Labor Party, a pro-Chinese Marxist organization;

Arthur Mitchell, a. black activist at SUNY; and Mitchell Cohen,
a former student and SDS-‘member. The purpose of the meeting
was to plan a campaign to raise money for Bobby Seale and to
rent busses to transport individuals to New Haven.
eee
: A source advised that approximately 200 members of
the Venceremos Brigade who returned from Cuba this week have
indicated they will travel to New Haven to participate in
the May demonstrations. These Brigade members will travel
to New Haven independently and not be transported there by
the Venceremos Brigade,

3. Yale University Involvement

Leaders of the BPP have been active on the Yale
University campus for several weeks where many of the
threats of violence have been voiced. They have indicated
4° they expect strong support from Yale students in the May

demonstrations and have threatened to close Yale down if the
demand of $500,000 from the University te be used in defense

i of the Connecticut Panthers is not met. A threat was made
to take over the rare book library at Yale.

Gn April 22, 1970, ten of twelve undergraduate
colleges at Yale voted to strike in support of the Panthers.
The strike has tone dnto effect and has halted most academic
functions at the University. On April 23, 1970, 500 striking
students staged a rally on the Yale campus and a peaceful
“civil digebedience” demonstration was called for by Ydle
Chaplain William Sloane Coffin, Jr., om April 24, 1970,
during which Coffin and others would subject themselves to
arrest. This demonstration was subsequently postponed to be
held in abeyance for possible future use.

With respect to Yale student participation in the
May demonstration activity, it has been reported that
approximately »50:~-per:cent of the student body of 9,385
members is leaving the campus for the weekend. A student
strike in support of the BPP defendants has reportedly been
80 per.cent effective.

It has been reported that Yale University will
provide medical aid through medical stations located on the
campus during the May demonstrations,’ Host of the colleges

at Yale ave making arrangements to house visiting demon~
strators in rooms and temporary shelters. Food will be
provided to the demonstraters by the University at a price
of 20 cents per meal.

4. Reports of Planned Violence During the
emonstrations
A source reported that on April 24, 1970, an
individual not known to him had informed the national head~
quarters of the BPP in Berkeley, California, that 50,000
persons would take part in the New Haven demonstrations and
that demonstrators would engage in guerrilla warfare in the
streets. On April 22, 1970, a source advised that a BPP
member in Boston had stated that the Panthers had received
orders to move eon Bobby Seale's trial in Connecticut and
break it up. On April 27, 1970, a representative of the
q - Associated Press in New Haven advised he had received an
" unsigned message from the Associated Press in Boston which
atated that during the confusion which will take place in
New Havenon May 1, 1970, a guerrilla force will attempt to
free Bobby Seale from the State Prison at Montville,
Connecticut. This report has not been verified.

On Aprii 16, 1970, a source advised that Elbert Howard
had stated he feels the temper of the black community in
.New Haven is "very good" and that “the people are ready, just
waiting for the word." He claimed that people in New Haven
are holding clandestine meetings within their homes and that
even the cthool childrei are supporting Bobby Seale.
Rohert Goldstein, previously mentioned, advised that at "the
movement" party which he attended in New York City on
April 24, 1970, that he overheard a discussion between two
members of "the movement" during which one of them said,
“After Kunstler gives bis speech, the plan was to burn
New Haven down." Special emphasis was put on the fact that
no fires were te be started in the ghetto areas of New Haven
and that after the fires were underway, the next phase is to
be sniper fire upon firemen and not the police, This
individual, Lee Doyle, also reportedly stated that there
were plans to blow up thse bridge of the New Haven railroad
which runs through the center of New Haven.

On April 17, 1976, William Kunstler, in a speech
before a biracial audience of 450 persons at the University
of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky, urged everyone to

support the plight of Bobby Seale and to participate in
“the siege of New Haven" on May 1, 1970,

F. Security Measures Being Taken by Local Law Enforcement
Agencies : :

Law enforcement agencies in the New Haven area are
making special preparations to control the demonstrations
during the three-day period from May 1 through 3, L970. The
Chief of the New Haven Police Department has advised that
eurrent plans ¢all for the full utilization of his 425-man
Police force, Sixteen-hour shifts will be worked during the
period with two thirds of the force on duty at all times.
Three hundred Connecticut State Police officers and 700
National Guardsmen will assist local autiorities. In
addition, there will be 1,700 National Guardsmen on call who
can be mobilized within a " two-hour period.

In view of the possible attempts to free the BPP
members awaiting trial in New Haven, extra security guards
will be on duty at the State Prison in Montville, Connecticut,
and Women's Prison at Niantic, Connecticut, where the BPP
members are confined. Both of these cities are approxi~
mately 50 miles east of New Haven.

The police department has established an
Intelligence Center where 17 telephones on direct lines will
be mauned at all times. About 40 undercover police officers
with walkie-talkies operating from strategic concealed
places will act as . spotters. during the period of the three~
day activity.

As a special security measure against the use of
explosives, all manhole covers in New Haven have been welded
down. Special police personnel will be assigned to guard
strategically located business establishments as well as
the police department, courthouse, and the Civic Center,
Large chemical plants. inthe aren will also be afforded
special guards and police officials have notified most other
private business establishments, such as lumberyards, to
afford themselves extra. security protection.

Special attention will be paid to the three public
high schools in New Haven which have about a 5C per cent
Negro student body in view of the strong possibility of



cee eer + e e

SHEREE

students becoming involved. No information has been
received as to whether the schools wili romain open on
May 1, 1970.

G, Reaction of Local Citizens to the Demonstration Activity

The population of greater New Haven is approsi-
mately. 350,000 people. The population of New Haven itself
is approximately 150,00@.neople, 40 per cent Negro.
Indications are that the local responsible citizenry, black
and white, is extremely concerned about the situation and
that .it, will remain clear of the demonstration area, where
possible. :

H. Disorders Which Have Already Occurred

Minor violence has already occurred in New Haven

q °° as 8 result of activities of BPP members. On April 14, 1970,

i following the jailing of two BPP officials on contempt of
court charges during preliminary proceedings at the BPP
trial, a group of Negroes broke windows and created disorders
in downtown New Haven. Several days later, a group of xbout
806 high school students, most of them Negroes who had been
demonstrating in front of the courthouse, ran through the
downtown area shoving and pushing shoppers and damaging
property. On April 22, 1970, a local BPP leader created a
disturbance at a hish school, forcing the temporary closing
of the school when fires were started and windows broken by
rarpaging students. On April 27, 1970, a fire of suspicious
origin caused considerable damage to the basement of the
Yale Law School Library. The damage was confined mostly to
books and to the upper portion of the building caused by
heavy smoke,

On April 26, 1970, police observed an automobile
occupied by two women and a man driving by police headquarters
several times and then stopping at the rear entrance of the
building, One of the individuals was arrested for a traffic
violation and the other two for trespass. A search of the
car hy police revealed literature conceruing. the BPP rally
and also a map of the City of New Baven on which several
locations, including National Guard armories, a shopping
mall, the office building housing the FBI office, and the
Yale University bowl had been marked. Also found in the
vehicle were numerous electrical and plumbing-type tools and
fers instruction manuals pertaining to water and eléctrical
systems,

Conclusions

1. Based upon the current intelligence reflected
in this paper, the potential for violence is extremely high.
~The-assessment in this regard pertains not only to the
possibility of police confrontations and rioting, but also
takes “into account assassinations, bombings, arson and
sabotage against key facilities,

2. The Departmental Civil Disorder Task Force
should proceed te New Haven on instructions of the Attorney
General and Deputy Attorney General for instant deployment.

3. Taking into account the high potential for
violence of all kinds, the decision with respect to alerting Federak
troops will be taken into consideration by the Deputy Attorney
General in connection with his meeting with appropriate
military authorities. o

4. Responsible agencies, both local and Federal,
shovld maintain close and continuous liaison throughout
this crucial three-day period with particular attention
being given to the protection of vital facilities and
installations, including Government buildings which may
become targets for extremist elements,

At 9 o'clock this morning I attended meeting of .

Deputy Attorney General (DAG) for the purpose of further \
assessing the serious New Haven situation, The DAG presided
at the meeting. :

Intelligence regarding the overall New Haven
situation which had come in through the night was discussed
and those in attendance were in complete agreement: that the
situation for potential violence, which has been assessed at,
extremely high, has not changed and that the conclusions wi
had been previously reached by the Evaluation Committee at ‘tts
4/29/70 meeting’ were still valid. The DAG has not,called for
any further meetings at this time, 7

A continuous flow of information regarding the grave
and increasingly high propensity for violence at New Haven,
Connecticut, is being received. The steady influx of militant
extremists, both black and white, into the area’ to take part in i
denoystrations and related activity to commence 5/1/70 to show ;° \
support for Black Panther Party (BPP) members charged with ad
murder has continued, This, accompanied by intelligence infor-
mation indicating that many of these extremists are intent upon
committing acts of violence, appears to underscore the necessity
to send reliable informants to the area. Also, it would appear se ad
that sympathy demonstrations which could result in acts of »/~
violence may occur on campuses or in cities in other parts

Paather headquarters, He observed large caches of explosive
material, weapoas, ammunition and "Right Guard" deodorant
spray cans rigged with explosive devices. He conversed with
Penther members Robert Webb ard Jon Turner who were described
as dcuolition experts and while he was there these individuals
conducted classes in the use and handling of dynamite. Webb

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

‘ A source who has furnished reliable information in
the past attended a "Revolutionary Action on Campus and In
Community" workshop at the Black Student Revolutionary
Conference (BSRC) which was held at Yale University, New Haven,
Connecticut, May 16 - 19, 1970. This conference was held |
under the direction of the Black Panther Party (BPP). At the
May 18, 1970, session of that workshop, at least 100 persons
were present and the group appeared to be made up of four
factions. Two of the factions were white and one of those : .
consisted of the extremist Students for a Democratic Society ;
Weathermen. The other two groups were representatives of the
black extremist BPP and the Black Student Union (BSU).

BPP leader Douglas Miranda and two BPP representatives
from California spoke at that workshop. i

Speakers encouraged students at the workshop to
withdraw their savings from banking institutions and invest
those funds in the necessary arms and material for revolution.
It was stated that an underground should be formed by students
from all states. It was said that intelligence files should
be kept on all black policemen and daily reports kept on their
activities so that they may be judged by the people and tried
at a later date:

t Et was pointed out that maps should be made pin-
pointing all emergency sheltérs, hospitals, fire stations,
reservoirs, railroad terminals, airports, telephone installa-
tions, and utilities. It was noted that guerrilla units
should be organized and developed to operate against trans-
portation facilities, radio and television stations, and
public utilities. Those units should consist of people who
are ready to die and are explosives experts, snipers, and
cameramen.

it was suggested that welfare mothers stockpile
canned goods and that defense groups seek weapons and bombs
for a people's arsenal. Mention was made of an underground
strike center which should be set up with security clearance
necessary for all who enter or leave. Such a center would
be used by only the most trusted personnel of the people's
army. It was proposed that names and addresses of all public
officials, city and state, be recorded and classified so that
they can be readily "moved on" if necessary.

A second source who has also furnished reliable
information in the past advised that as individuals arrived
in New Haven on May 16, 1970, for the BSRC, they went to the
BPP Defense Office where they registered and were assigned
rooms.

As part of the activities of the BSRC,.the second
source advised that at about 8:30 PM on May 18, 1970, there
was a series of speeches by students who spoke of the problems
on their campuses, One unidentified student from Staten Island,
New York, Community College ; mentioned that gun clubs were
being organized on his campus as well as other campuses and
he urged that blacks be influenced to join them. He pointed

out that college libraries have a wealth of information on
guns which is available to all.

According to the second source, another series of
speeches was given at the BSRC on May 19, 1970. One of the |
speakers at that time was BPP member Richard Moore who stated
that when the BPP sends out a call to go to Washington, D. C., .
he wants everyone there to help "repaint the White House," :

Qne of our Black Panther Party sources, who was in
New Haven, Connecticut, on May 1, 1970, during the massive
Black Panther Party demonstrations at Yale University, has
been debriefed and has furnished the following pertinent
information.

It was the source's observation that the Black
Panther Party in New Haven had considerable community support
evidenced by the fact its leader, Douglas Miranda, appeared
to be well-known and well-received by Negroes in the community
as he rode through the streets,(It appears very possible that
the recent remarks made about the Black Panthers by Kingman
Brewster, President of Yale University, expressing his opinion
as to the inability of black revolutionaries to achieve a fair
trial anywhere in the United States may have contributed much
to deepen and widen the commmity support being given the
violent Black Panther Party ..)

Source advised he observed the Black Panther Party
office in New Haven, located at 35 Sylvan Avenue, was protected
on the first floor by sandbags from floor to ceiling. The only
openings were gunports at the windows. The windows and doors
were protected by metal shields and bars. The second floor
was also protected by sandbags and appeared to be the opera-
tional area as it contained office equipment and some sleeping

. quarters. The third floor had sleeping quarters and had food
and clothing stored there. The source was warned that the yard

The source stated he saw in the Black Panther Party
office a Negro making silencers for guns. This individual was
vegarded with awe by other Panthers who said he was making
silencers for various types of firearms. The source also
stated the Black Panther Party had quantities of what appeared
to be dummy or practice-type hand grenades which had "Korea"
stamped on them. The Black Panther Party hopes to be able to
use these as bombs or grenades.

According to the source, during the weekend of
May 1 to May 3, 1970, the Black Panther Party in New Haven
stressed that there was to be no violence at this time as
the "pigs" were ready and outmanned and outgunned the Black
Panther Party.

The source indicated that the Black Panther Party
members in New Haven have noticed the large number of one-
man police patrol cars which they say appear very vulnerable
and opens possibilities for ambush. The source was also told
that a New Haven Police Department plain-clothes man, who is
called "Buffalve,'"' is hated by the Black Panther Party and .
that they will "get him."

The source said the philosophy of the Black Panther
Party during the weekend of May 1 through May 3, 1970, was
that there is a time and place for everything but this was
not the time for violence in New Haven, Connecticut.

evidenced by the fact its leader, Douglas Miranda, appeared
to be well-known and well-received by Negroes in the community
as he rode through the streets, (It appears very possible that
the recent remarks made about the Black Panthers by Kingman
Brewster, Presivent of Yale University, expressing his opinion
as to the inability of black revolutionaries to achieve a fair
trial anywhere in the United States may have contributed much
to deepen and widen the community support being given the
violent Black Panther Party.)

*

Source advised he observed the Black Panther Party |
office in New Haven, located at 35 Sylvan Avenue, was protected |
on the first floor by sanubags from fleor to ceiling. ‘The only
openings were gunports,at the windows, The windows and doors
were protected by metal shields and bars. The second floor
was also protected by sandbags and appeared to be the opera-
tional area as it contained office equipment and some sleeping
quarters. The third floor had sleeping quarters and had food
and clothing stored there. The source was warned that the yard
surrounding the house was mined,

~. +" The source stated he saw in the Black Panther Party
office a Negro making silencers for guns, This individual was
regarded with awe by other Panthers who said he was making
silencers for various types of firearms. The source also
stated the Black Panther Party had quantities of what appeared
to be dummy or practice-type hand grenades which had "Korea!
stamped on them. The Black Panther Party hopes to be able to
use these as bombs or grenades. :

According to the source, during the weekend of

May 1 to May 3, 1970, the Black Panther Party in New Haven
stressed that there was to be no violence at this time as
the "pigs" were ready and outmanned and outgunned the Black
Panther Party.

. The source indicated that the Black Panther Party
members in New Haven have noticed the large number of one-
man police patrol cars which they say appear very vulnerable
and opens possibilities for ambush. The source was also told
that a New Haven Police Department plain-clothes man, who is
called "Buffalve," is hated by the Black Panther Party and
that they will "get him."

The source said the philosophy of the Black Panther
Party during the weekend of May 1 through May 3, 1970, was
that there is a time and place for everything but this was
not the time for violence in New Haven, Connecticut.

their organizations. kPA has been utilized suecessfully
in the past in identifying and apprehending Sureeu fugitives

Captioned program was implemented to aid field -

hate extremists, extremists who were fugitives in dureau /
criminal cases, and extremist informants who traveled on 1 y

o£ leads where photograph and background information were
necessary,

FBIRQ desires that a study of current field usage

of the EPA be made at this time. Each field office is

established the following individual investigative criteria

national officers: and the Minister, .

NOI mosque. (These investigations are os
@losed if subject of same aeases extremist activity

-(2) Limited preliminary inquiries, for the primary
m purpose of determining propensity for violence,
are conducted on all current male members,

ages 18 to 36.

Limited preliminary inquiries consist only of
aseértaining the member's true name, identifying data,
residence, employment and propensity for violence. This
Anformation is to be obtained through established sources.

Reference is made to my memorandum of May 16, 1974
providing you with our opinion that investigation by the
FBI of the Nation of Islam (NOL) should continue. In the '

the NOL's activities appear to violate certain statutes such val

Disorder s) 5 247, 245 (Conspiracy to Depeive aud Deprivation of

In my May 16 memorandum, I informed you that I considered
it inadvisable to base continued investigation of the NOI on
Executive Order 10450 until the question of the continuation
of the Attorney General's list was resolved. On June 4, 197

to whether the continued investigation of the NOI is appro-

has recommended continued investigation for the reasons set
forth in my May 16 memorandum and on the basis of potential

violations of '8 U.S.C. §§ 2101 and 2102 (Riots).

Accordi .gly, continued investigation of this group is

Reference is made to your letters of June 8, 1973,
August 6, 1973, and October 4, 1973, to me in which you
requested an opinion as to whether activities of the Nation
of Islam (NOI) come under the criteria of Executive Order.

whether the investigation of the NOI should be continued [7
along current lines. A review has been made of pertinent
FBI resorts of the activities cf thse crganigation, its rR
members and activities, and consultations have been held & 2

With respect to your specific questions, although our#
‘ review of FBI reports indicates that NOI may have engaged
in activities which deprive citizens of constitutional
rights, and, therefore, it would come within the criteria
of Executive Order 10450, the Department is currently
reviewing the Attorney General's list for the purpose of
determining whether its continued existence is warranted.
Therefore, I do not think it advisable to base continued
investigation of the NOI on Executive Order 10450, until
this question is resolved.

-administered by this Division as to whether NOI's activities
should be investigated in light of statutes over which they,
and we, have jurisdiction.

A basis for continued investigation was described by
Deputy Assistant Attorney General Kevin T. Maroney when he
testified before the Committee on Internal Security of the
House of Representatives on February 20, 1974. He pointed
out, inter alia, that without a broad range of intelligence
information, the President and the departments and agencies
of the Executive Branch could not properly and adequately
protect our nation's security and enforce the numerous
statutes pertaining thereto. There is, in our view,
sufficient evidence to indicate that certain NOI members
have been involved in disturbances and attacks on police
throughout the country as noted in reports disseminated
to the Department of Justice, other executive agencies and to
the Secret Service in connection with its responsibility for
the protection of the PB:
I feel the Department, and in particular the Attorney General,
must continue to be informed of those organizations that engage
in violence which represent a potential threat to the public
safety. Therefore, continued investigation of this group is
warranted.

Sident. Under thase circumstances,

If, during the course of your investigation, information
is developed that the NOI has changed its tactics and
objectives, and has assumed an attitude of non-violence, you
should again consult with the Department to reassess the
| basis for continuing the investigation. In the interim,
| I will apprise you of our decision as to whether NOI's
activities appear to violate certain statutes, e.g., Title 18,
United States Code, Sections 231, 233 (Civil Disorders),

241, 245 (Conspiring to Deprive and Deprivation of Civil
Rights), and 2101 and 2102 (Riots).

BACKGROUND:

7 a
The NOI, founded in Detroit, Michigan, in 1930, isan”
independent, semi-religious black organization with over 7000
members in 120 units, or Mosques, throughout the United States,
‘Foreign units exist in Bermuda, Jamaica and British Honduras.
Elijah Muhammad, 75-year-old Supreme Ruler of the NOI, operates
from NOI national headquarters in Chicago, Illinois, This group
seeks to establish a separate black nation, disavows any allegiance
to the United States Government, preaches a distorted version of
the Islamic religion, and teaches all whites are "devils" who will
be destroyed by the forces of nature, NOI beliefs are propagated
weekly via distribution of over 500,000 copies of the NOI newspaper
“Muhammad Speaks" and by 4 ‘éansmission of NOI teachings over the, |
radio in over 100 United Statés cities ieee once a Lig ae OG at

Since mid-1971, NOI internal’ dissension and difficilties—~
with rival Muslim sects, and other adversaries, are believed to
have been factors: in at least 20‘murders, three bombings, two
abductions and numerous shootings, beatings and assaults. In the

Re: Nation of Islam

NOI a $3 million noninterest loan and promised an additional $6
million of assistance. Qatar and Abu Dahbi have donated $100,000
and $125,000, respectively, and Kuwait has indicated it is
considering a $2 million gift,

We have conducted a continuous security-type investiga~
tion of the NOI since 1953, Periodically, and most recently on
July 12, 1966, we have requested the Department's opinion concern-
ing possible prosecution of the NOI under appropriate statutes
“or its designation under Executive Order 10450. The Department
has repeatedly declined to take action against the NOI citing
lack of adequate evidence of specific acts by its leaders resulting
in force being utilized or violence occurring, as well as referring
to the quasi-religious nature of the NOI as a further deterrent ~o
successful prosecution, In view of the character and activities
of the NOI, the Department requested by memorandum July 28, 1966,
that the NOI continue to be the subject of active investigation
and that the Department be furnished the results for examination
for possible violation of Federal statutes and for possible
designation under the provisions of Executive Order 10450.

During the period April 2, 1973 - May 25, 1973, five

one week in-service sessions of specialized training in black
7 extremist matters were conducted at the FBI Academy for selected
I representatives from each FBI field office except Anchorage and
Honolulu, It was the consensus of those attending these sessions
that the NOI certainly warrants our continued investigative

attention in view of its substantially increased potential for
_Violence inthe:past two years,

As a considerable period of time has transpired since
the Department's last request for investigation regarding the
NOL, and in view of the increased propensity for violence of this
group, it appears in the Bureau's best interests to seek a
decision from the Department as to whether a prosecutable violation
exists concerning the NOI and as to the desirability of Cibeveletenonmiene
this investigation.

ACTION:

If approved, the attached memorandum be forwarded to
Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division.

anaes Recently a suit for refund of income taxes for
the years 1966 and 1967, was instituted in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of
Illinois, by Muhammed Ali. The suit seeks recovery
-of $97,048.68 for the years in question based upon
a claimed deduction for contributions made to the
“Holy Temple of Islam or the Nation of Islam. In
the earlier of the two years Muhammed Ali allegedly
-made a substantial contribution to the organization
and then borrowed the money from it on the same day.
As to that transaction we, of course, are maintaining
that there was no true contribution and that the two
transactions effectively eliminate any claim of
deduction, As an alternative defense for the first
year, and as a defense in the second year as well,
we are also contending that the recipient organi-
zation was not one to which deductibility contributions
could be made since, under the statute, part of its
-earnings inured to the benefit of certain individuals,
namely its leader Elijah Muhammed and members of his

PURPOSE:

Attached for your approval is a memorandum to
3, Walter Yeagley, Assistant Attorney General, requesting
an opinion be furnished at this time as to whether the
activities of the Nation of Islam come within the criteria
of Executive Order 10450 or its activities are in violation
of any other Federal statute.

OBSERVAT IONS:
©

The Nation of Islam is an all-Negro semireligious
organization which advocates a doctrine of violent hatred

of the United States Government and the white race. The
organization is headed by Elijah Muhammad with headquarters / fund
in Chicago, Illinois. We have conducted a continuous

security-type investigation of this organization since 1953.
Periodically, we have requested the Department's opinion

as to possible prosecution of the Nation of Islam under

appropriate statutes or designation under Executive Order

10450, most recently on January 31, 1964.

7 The Department has repeatedly declined to take
action against the Nation of Islam, citing lack of specific
acts of force or violence by its leaders or members. The
Department makes repeated reference to the quasi-religious
nature of the Nation of Islam as a further deterrent to
successful prosecution, Recognizing the threat to the
internal security of the Nation posed by the Nation of Islam,
the Department has requested our investigation be continued
and the names of appropriate Nation of Islam officials be
included in our Security Index and that they be considered
for apprehension during a period of national emergency.

Re: NATION OF ISLAM :
25~330971

While no new information has been developed
concerning specific acts by its leaders to cause acts
of force or violence to be committed, voluminous
additional information has been furnished the Department
since the last request for a prosecutive opinion was made
on January 31, 1964,

The Department apparently has no intention of
authorizing prosecution of the Nation of Islam, in absence.
of the Nation of Islam causing large-scale riots, or
, virtual insurrection. However, it appears to be in the
| Bureau's best interests to put the Department on record
once again as to whether a prosecutable violation exists
concerning the Nation of Islam.

training in judo and karate, and in some instances with guns,

At every meeting the white man is characterized as a devil, a
snake who has tortured the Negro and always will; that this white
devil must be exterminated along with his black sympathizers;
that the white man was alloted by. Allah, their Supreme power, a
certain period on this earth and this period is now up; that all
ROE members must await the signal from Blijah Muhammad to indicate
the beginning of the extermination of the white devils to make
room for a Negro takeover of the country; that such a signal
would be forthcoming momentarily, Moreover, the NOI leaders,
Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X and others, preach that they must
have a yart of the territory of the United States as their own
exclusive territory together with sufficient financial means

to set them up economically independent. At their meetings, the
NOI members denigrate the American flag and advocate disobedience
of any law contrary to the beliefs of the Muslims.

This reported information, however, is insufficient
-to prove a policy of advocacy or approval of the commission of
acts of force or violence to deny other persons their rights
under the Constitution of the United States.

The activities reported must be shown to be more than
mere prophecies or utterances made with the hope of ultimate
attainment of their desired aims. For example, while teaching
that the white man must be exterminated they do not say by whom
or how, There should be available evidence to show that the
advocacy or approval of the commission of acts of violence to deny
others their Constitutional rights is calculated to incite the
members to action now or in the foreseeable future.’ Evidence
is needed to show the specific acts taken by particular individual
leaders in advocating or approving acts of force and violence;
not that “heads will roll in the streets, which could be merely
a prediction, but rather what specific plan of action, direction
or urging has been made to bring about such event; not the abstract
teaching that Allah will cause the desired event, but the concrete
steps taken by specific individual: leaders to effectuate their
goals, It is fully realized that such evidence is not easily
obtained even if it exists; and finally there seems to be some
indication that the leaders are becoming more cautious in their
utterances,

For the past several years, we have been periodically
requesting an opinion fromthe Department relative to possible
prosecutive action against the Nation of Islam (NOI). Our latest
request was dated 2/5/63, In response, the Department has requested
it be supplied with a prosecutive summary report setting forth evidence
the NOI within the past three years has advocated or approved commission
of acts of force and violence to deny individuals their constitutional
rights or in seeking to alter the form of government of the United States
by unconstitutional means.

- In previous opinions, the Department advised a review of the
activities of the NOI did not constitute violations of any Federal
statutes, In fact, the Department in the past has contended the
language used by NOI officials does not advocate overthrow of the
Government by unconstitutional means but seeks.to arouse hatred
against the white race as a whole, The Department requested . we. 5
continue to furnish data concerning NOI for future study. - Wé have.
done this on a continuing basis, Also, a review of material: we have
furnished the Department does not indicate any change in the. teachings
of the NOI toward the overthrow of our Government,

OBSERVATIONS: :
we :
ae Inasmuch as the Department is in possession of ait pertinent
’ inforitation regarding the NOI and its teachings, it appears the Department
is trying to get the Bureau to do the Department*s work, Furthermore,
the Department has not advised or given any indication it is contemplat-

CONFIDENTIAL

This is in response to your memorandum of January 10,
1962, inquiring about the possibility of designation of the
captioned organization pursuant to the provisions of
Executive Order No. 10450, and asking whether its activities
are in violation of any federal statute.

An examination of the reports and memoranda pertaining
to the subject organization fails to disclose sufficient
evidence to warrant prosecutive action against the leaders
under the Smith Act and other related statutes, or to justify
the institution of designation proceedings. The reasons
set forth in our memorandum of September 21, 1960, are
relevant to the present situation.

Because of the radical, semi-secret, and violent nature
of this organization, and the continuing tendency on the part
of some of its leaders to use language of implied threats .
against the Government, we are asking the Bureau to continue
its investigation of the organization and its leaders.

During the past years there hag been an exchange of
correspondence between this Bureau and the Department concerning
what legal action, if any, can be taken against this organization
and/or its members. The Department by various memoranda has advised
_that a reviow of this matter has disclosed there is insufficient

. evidence to establish a violation of the Smith Act of 1940 ox any
other statute of which thic Bureau has investigative jurisdiction;
has disclosed the organization appears to have no program of action
which reasonably would be calculated to bring about or attempt to
bring about the violent overthrow of the United States Government;
and hag disclosed there is insufficient basis upon which to
proceed against this organization pursuant to the provisions of
Executive Order 10450. The Department from time to time has advised
that it desires that security-type investigations be conducted
concerning the leaders of the organization and/or its active
participating members for consideration for apprehension during
the period of a national emergency and for inclusion in the Security
index.

In view of the extreme radical and violent nature of this
organization and its leaders I thought this matter should be called
to your attention in order that you may consider whether there is
any legal action that can be taken or whether the organization can
be designated pursuant to the provisions of Executive Order 10450.

-CONPIDENPEAE-
This is with further reference to your memorandum
dated June 19, 1959, wherein you request to be advised
whether any action against the Nation of Islam (NOI) is

contemplated under provisions of Executive Order No.
10450,

As you know, it has been the Department's policy
not to designate religious or quasi-religious organi-
zations. On the other hand, the NOI's basic tenets make
this a potentially dangerous organization in any emergency
For this reason, extensive study and consideration was

: given the Bureau reports with a view of determining whether
\ the NOI falls within the purview of Executive Order No.
10450.

As you have been previously advised, the designation
of NOI poses a number of legal problems. For example, the
inclusion of NOI under the category that it is an organi-
zation" ... . seeking to alter the form of Government of
the United States by unconstitutional means'', has been
determined to be inapplicable inasmuch as the language
used by Elijah Muhammed and his ministers seeks: to arouse
hatred and antipathy against the white race as a whole,
‘rather than seeking to alter the form of government, and
any language concerning the destruction of the government
usually has been couched in terms of prophecy or prediction
rather than in terms of incitement to action in the fore-
seeable future.

It has also been determined ‘that there is insufficient 7
basis upon which to proceed against the NOI under any other“?
criterion of the Order. ne {

Amendment insofar as freedom of speech is concerned. Any
prosecution involving members of this organization will un-
doubtedly be reviewed by the courts not only from this as-
pect, but also from the "freedom of religion" clause of the
First amendment. It can; therefore, be anticipated that
the courts will require that the proof against any member
of this organization be strong and unequivocal, mainly be~
cause of the claimed religious nature of the organization.

ae With regard-to possible prosecutions under sec-
tions 1001 and 1621”of Title 18, United States Code, we
have reviewed all individual cases coming within the pur-
view of these statutes and, to date, have been unable to
recommend prosecution in. any of them for the various
reasons of which you have been apprised in our previous
correspondence in this matter.

Because of the repeated acts of disrespect to-
ward our flag shown by leaders of this organization, we are
considering the desirability of proposed legislation, simi-
lax to Title 4, Section 3 of the United States Code, which
is applicable only to the District of Columbia, to make
criminal acts of desecration or other disrespectful acts di-
rected toward our country's flag.

With regard to possible designation proceedings,
certain legal problems created by an action under the appli-
cable criteria are under consideration and en analysis is
being made of the more recent reports submitted by the Bureau.

Re: Nation of Islam :
25-330971

i 3 a continuing basis with copies of reports concerning all investiga-
, tions.

As of 6/15/59 there were 400 NOI members on the Security

Index. The Department has recognized that this organization has
dangerous potentiality as it accepts the fact that members of NOI
5

should be on Security Index. In an emergency through the Emergency
Detention Program the effectiveness and operations of this organization
would be destroyed through the apprehension of its key members. On
1/11/56 we presented the facts of this case to the Department to see if
legal action could be taken, including placing the NOI on the Attorney
General's list of subversive organizations (pursuant to B.0.10450). ‘The
Department replied by memorandum 2/7/56 that the organization does not
warrant designation under £.0. 10450 or consideration under the Smith Act
of 1940, It is noted that we could expect considerable difficulty in
producing witnesses to clearly depict the violent nature of this organi-
zation at any administrative hearing because we have gained most of our
information from live Negro informants who would be extremely loathe to
testify publicly because of the inherent physical danger from other members
of the organization and ostricism by other members of their race.

which raises again with the Department the question of possible legal
action against the NOI.

_Assistant Attorney General William F,. Tompkins

With regard to the current use of the name
Nation of Islam as the title of this organization, Elijah
Muhammad, in January, 1957, referred to his.organization
as the "Nation of Islam" and "Muhammad's Temples of
Islam" and approved the afore-mentioned names as being
descriptive of his organization on a national basis.
Since the Nation of Islam and the Muslim Cult of Islam
are one and the same organization, in all instances where
informants have in the past furnished information relative
to the Muslim Cult of Islam and membership therein, such
information in the future will be attributed to the Nation
of Islam and membership therein. Likewise, the Fruit of
Islam and membership therein have the same relationship to
the Nation of Islam as they had to the Muslim Cult of Islam,

As you know, this Division has had under review FBI ts
on the Muslim Cult of Islam since receipt of your memorandum to me of
September 7, 1955, Subject: Program for Apprehension and Detention of § \
Persons Considered Potentially Dangerous to the National Defense and, seas
Public Safety of the United States, ped a

~ The review was being conducted with a view toward making a
determination as to whether or not the Muslim Cult of Islam should be
designated by the Attorney General, and also the effect the reported
membership in this organization would have on the consideration of whe-
ther an individual should be listed on the Security Index.

The memorandum to me of March 25, 1957, captioned "Emergency
Detention Program enclosed a copy of an FBI report dated March 12,
1957, at Atlanta captioned "James Alfred Martin, Jr., was" and bore the
’ character "Security Matter--NOI." The first paragraph of the details
of this report reflects the following: "On January 21 and January 22,

" 41957, Confidential Informant Atlanta T-1, who has furnished reliable
information in the past, advised that the organization formerly referred
to as the 'Muslim Cult of Isiam' has been described by ELIJAH MUHAMMAD ,
the national leader, as the 'Netion of Islam’ and/or®'Muhammad's Temples,

£ Islam’. The character of this case is therefore being changed from :
“TSECURITY MATTER - MCL' to 'SECURTTY MATTER ~ NOT'." 5

It is not clear if your Bureau intends to substitute the “*
‘Nation of Islam" for the “Muslim Cult of Islam" on the sole basis of ‘"
fas description furnished to Atlanta Informant T~1, nor is it clear whe~
a the "Muslim Cult of Islam" is no longer in existence.

the Muslim Cult of Islam, it would be uppreciated if you would furnish

Memorandum for Assistant Attorney General
William F. Tompkina -. eerces

In connection with a recent review of the
files of the Philadelphia liaval Shipyard relating to
Andrew dgohuson, the followlng was noted:

‘Prior to dohnson’s resignation consideration
was given by the employing agency to affording Johnson
@ hearing on the basis ef his membership in the Muslim
Gult of Islan. In this connection, the Assiatant
Secretary of the Navy in charge of personnel by letter
, advised the Personnel Relations Office at the Philadelphia
‘Naval Shipyard that membership in the Muslim Cult of
islam alone was not basis enough to hold a security hearing
as it was the opinion of the Legal Department of the Secretary
of the Havy that the Muslin Cult of Islam was a religious
organisation, was founded ag a religious organization, and net
an organization to overtheqw the Governmuent. It wag also
stated thet the organization had not been included on the
Attorney Genoralts list and there was no indication that it was
connected with the Communist Party. For these reasons the
Personnel Section at the Navy Yard was ordered by the Secretary 5
of the Navy to discontinue the investigation of Johnson. eee

With further reference to tha VusLim Cult of tdlem

it is-noted in your memorandum to this Bureau dated February 7,
1956, entitled "Program for Apprehension and Detention of
Persons Considered Potentially Dangerous to the National

' Defense and Public Safety of the United States," yon advised
that it appaared that the teachings of the Cult would
constitute that organization a potentially dangerous
instrumentality in the event of a national emergency. It
was peinted out that from a review of available evidence for
use in administrative or judicial proceedings, however, Lt

- appeared that the proof did not warvant either designation
of the organization under Executive Order 1050 or the

institution of proceedings undsr the, provisions of the
Snith Act. It was requeetad that this Bureau continue
to conduct security-type investigations of the leaders
. ‘and active participating members of the liuslim Cult of
- Islam as well as investigations of the tult itself. .~.

fhe above is for your information and
consideration and this Bureau will, unless advised to
the ‘contrary by the Department, continue to initiate Ly
field investigations under Executive Order 10450 on
applicants and employees of the Execubive Branch of the
Federal Government in instances where available information
indicates membership in or closes association with the
Muslim Gult of Islem by such individuals.

United States since they are in slavery in this country, These are
among the reasons given by the leaders why Cult members should not
register for Selective Service or serve in the armed forces.

Each Temple of the organization has a branch known as
the Fruit of Islam, composed of the able~bodied male members, The
members of these groups ave instructed in close order drill, self-
defense, eating habits, wearing apparel and the study of regula~
tions and doctrines of the Cult, In some of the Temples, addi~
tional courses of instruction in Mathemebtics, English and Arabic
are also given,

The report cltes four specific : acts of violence in
which Cult members have been involved. These acts may be sum-
marized as follows:

‘Siiver Spring, Maryland, Incident. A group of approximately .
30 Cult members was traveling in a day coach en route from Jersay City,
to Chicago. Shortly before arrival in Washington, D. C., some members
of the party became involved in a dispute with a railroad porter over
the issuance of a soiled pillow to one of the group, Several members
of the group assaulted the porter, who then broke contact witn the
group and reported the incident to the Station Master at Washington.
The train had departed Washington before any action could be taken;
but police in Silver Spring, Maryland, were requested to investigate
the incident. Upon boarding the train in Silver Spring, four police
officers were assaulted by Cult members and the guns and blackjacks {
.of two were taken by Cult members, After police reinforcements .
arrived, nine Gult members were arrested and charged with assault and
battery, inciting a riot, and interfering with an officer in the per~
formance of his duties, Six defendants were tried, convicted, and
sentenced to terms ranging from six months to twenty-one months.

Cincinnati, Ohio, Incident. After engaging in a street
fight, nine parsons were arrested, Seven identified themselves es
Cult menbers and the other two claimed that they were former members,
but were still firm believers. Two were charged with assault with

- intent to kill, by one of the victims, and with assault and battery,
by a policeman who had been struck duting the fight,

: : Detroit, Michigan, Incident. Two police officers who, at~
= tempted to have a double-parked auto moved from in front of the wh
- Detroit Temple had their nightsticks taken from them, and were

~ NW 68262~Docld:32989649-Page-680-



severely beaten. The officers shot and wounded two of their attackers,
wao were identified as Cult members. Three HCI members were tried
and convicted of attempting to incite a riot.

San Diego, California Incident. A dinner was held at
Fort Rosecrans for the 102d Combat Engineers Battalion, a Negro
National Guard organization which liad been called into Federal Service. :
A civilian who attended the dinner, identified as HarrisowCole, a _ ~ ot
Cult member, engaged several of the recruits in conversation. Yhen
“Lt was determined that he was making seditious statements to the
recruits, he was removed from the Fost by armed escort.

The report also contains numerous statements by Elijah
| Mohammed and the various ministers of the organization. These state-
ments appear to advocate the violent overthrow of the Government and rq
the slaughter of the White race. The dominant theme of the utterances
is that all persons who are not members of the Cult will be destroyed
in the War of Armageddon, at-which time the Government will be
overthrown and the Muslims will come to power, There are also
statemehts which aoprove the acts of violence committed by the
Mau-Mau in Africa and the Fuerto Ricen Nationalists, and which exhort
Cult members to kill the white devils in order to bring about the
day of their deliverance. It should also be noted that the report
contains other statements by leaders of the organization to the
effect that the deliverance of the Muslims is to be brought about
through a divine act of Allah, who will destroy the "wicked" and
overthrow their government without any assistance from Cult members.
According to this teaching, the role of the membership of the Cult
in the War of Armageddon will be entirely a passive one.

Although the report is replete with violent statements by
the leadership of the organization and there have been acts of
violence by the individual members, it is: believed. that: the. ¢ evidence

is insufficient to constitute a violati tation of the Smith, ict, This’
opinion is based on the absence of evidence of any >. lan or program
of the organization which could reasonably be calculated to attempt
the violent overthrow of the Government.. The statements of the
leaders of the organization, while they do exoress the desira-
bility of overthrowinz the Government, are more in the realm
of prophecy than of an actual plan for a violent. revolution. on, By
the sae toten; the acts of violence in whic members have
engaged, fail to evidence any clan of the organization or its
leadership. All these acts are of the spontaneous type, and except
for the fact that the persons involved are members of the organ-
ization, have no connection at all. It is also believed that the

need for @ careful review by the Department of the

thia organization constitutes a dangerous instrumentality
in the event of a national emergency. In the meantime,
while the Department was conducting this review, there
would not be furnished to the Department a List of Cult
members included on the Security Index. You were also
advised that, if the Department concluded from tts
review that the Muslim Cult of Islam did not constituse
a@ potential threat to the internal security of thie
Country, we would take steps to remove from. the

who claims to have been sent by Allah, the Supreme Being, te

to lead the Negroes out of slavery in the United States,
Members of the Cult fanatically follow the alleged teachings
of Allah as interpreted by Elijah Mohammed and disavow allegiance
te the United States. Members pledge allegiance only to
Allah and Islam and believe that any civil law which conflicts
with Muslim law should be disobeyed. The Cult teaches

that members of the colored race cannot be considered citizens
of the United States since they are in slavery in this country
and must free themselves by destroying non-Muslims and
Christianity in the coming War of Armageddon." For this
purpose the Cult has a military branch called-the;"Fruit of
islam" composed of all able-bodied members who participate -~
in military drill and judo training.

The Department has advised the Bureau by letters if ead

dated 2/9/53 and 1/26/55 that evidence presently available
in this case is insufficient to establish a violation of the
Smith Act, a conspiracy to violate the Smith Act or Title 18,
U.S. Code 2384 (Seditious Conspiracy), |

In view of the fanatical beliefs of the MCI and
the tense racial situation that exists today, it is believed
hee should send the Department this summary report and the
jexhibits thereto with the request that this material be
ines to determine if the activities of the MCI are in

violation of any Federal statutes within the Bureau's jurisdiction.

The original of the attached memorandum daté&
September 7%, 1955, to Assistant Attorney General Tompkins,
was delivered personally by me on September 8 to Mr,

. Tompkinse I advised him that in our correspondence with
the Department on the Muslin Cult of 4slam, we had the .
distinct impression that the Department has not thoroughly :
reviewed the file and all investigative reports on this Benet

| orgontzation. I potnted out that there are approximately

i 150 persons on the Security Index who are connected with

i this Cult and that the question involved is whether the :

! Department has sufficiently reviewed the file to arrive i
at @ coneluston as to whether membership in a leadership i
capacity, or active capacity in the "Fruit of Islam”

(the military section of the Cult), should be considered

dangerous in the event of aniemergencye I told Mro Tompkins
that if the Department comes to the conclusion such persons
will not be dangerous in an emergency, this Bureau would
tmnediately review the cases of the Security Index subjects

for appropriate actien and that in the meantime the individual
list of Security Index subjects is not being referred to the .. {

Department for review. 8

Security-type investigations of the leaders and active participating

members of the MCI and particularly the members of the Fruit of Islam (FOI),

| the military arm of the Cult, to determine whether the names of such

i With respect to the questions posed to the Department, the

Department odvised (1) that the Bureau should continue to conduct

. security-type investigations of the leaders and active participating

i members of the HCI and (2) that an individual review and evaluation

of derogatory information reported on each of the leaders and active

{ participating members of the Cult must be conducted to ascertain whether

‘ as individuals, they should be removed from the Security Inder or should

{ continue to be included, based on substantiutdevidence of each respective
individual's anarchist and revolutionary activities and beliefs, as

4 members of the Cult. Tle Department further noted that on the basis of
available information the anarchist and revolutionary statements
reportedly made by a single mintster of the Cult are not of such scope as
to indicate an aim or purpose of the Cult as enunciated by the prophe

: and leader, Elijah Mohammed, for uniform compliance by all MCI tempje ‘

i ninisterse ;

The Department concludes that statements and activities on tie
part of individual members of the Cult indicating anarchist and revolu-
tionary beliefs, wili be determining factors in determining whether or not

‘ such individual members come within the revised Security Index criteria.
The Department requests that a complete list of the names and FBI file
numbers of the members of the HCI currently included in the Security
Index be made available and that the Internal Security Division be kept

Memorandum for Ur. Boardman:

Thumbnail Sketch of the MCI:

Reliable informants report that this Cult is an organization
composed entirely of Negroes which was reportedly organized around
1930 in Detroit, Michigan. The national leader and founder is
Elijah Mohammed who claims to have been sent by Allah to lead the Negroes
out of slavery in the United States. Members fanatically follow the
alleged teachings of Allah as interpreted by Mohammed and disavow
allegiance to the United States. Members pledged allegiance only to
Allah and Islam and believe any civil law which conflicts with Muslim
law should be disobeyed. The Cult teaches that members of the dark
skinned race cannot be considered citizens of the United States since
they are in slavery in this country and, therefore, must free themselves
by destroying non-Muslims and Christianity in the "War of Armageddon." for
this purpose the Cult has a military branch called the Fruit of Islan
composed of all male able-bodied members who participate’ in military
drill and judo training. Members of the Gult also believe that they
gre directly related to all Asiatic nations and any conflict involving
Gny Asiatic nation and the Western nationsis considered a part of the
War of Armageddon in which the Asiatic nation will be victorious.

Instanoes of Violence Against Police Authority: °

On several occasions the primitive hatred with which members
are so imbued, exploded into open violence. In June 1950 the Detroit
Police, in attempting to solve a traffic problem, were assaulted by a
number of Negroes in front of the Temple of Islam. The officers had
their night stieks taken away , were forced to use firearms, and were
given a severe beating by the assembled Negroes. These Negroes were
identified as members of the Muslim Cult of Islan.

Another-incident occurred in September 1950 in San Diego,
involving two officers of the San Diego Police Department who were
attempting to serve a traffic warrant. Upon arrivingat the address,
two individuals accosted the officers and advised them the subject of the
warrant was not at home. When the officers exhibited the warrant and
expressed their intention of searching the house, they were .ruthlessly
attacked, This perpetrated a near riot and necessitated the calling
out of additional-cars and approrimately twenty officers. Before the
subject was taken -into custody and order was restored, an unknown
individual fired three shots into a@ police.car. Tt was later determined
that the subject and the two individuals who intercepted the officers
were all members of the San Diego Temple of the Muslim Cult of Islam.

Memorandum for Mr. Boardman:

In February, 1951, another incident occurred which involved
a disturbance between members of the Cult who were en route to the
yearly convention in Chicago. Members of the Montgomery County Police
tn Silver Spring, Maryland, were alerted. Four policemen who met the
train and entered the car were assaulted and had their guns and
blackjacks taken away from them by members of the Cult. This
necessinted a call for police reinforcements, and nine members of the
Cult were removed to the station and charged with assault.

Opposition to Federal Authority: mane

Such open defiance is not relegated merely to local authority.
In view of the stand this organization has taken in connection with
Service in the armed forces, members have consistently, since the
passage of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, adhered to the
a teachings of their leaders in refusing to register, because they claim
“to be registered in the book of Allah in the Holy City of Mecca and
cannot serve two masters. Jn 1942, three leaders of the cr, ineluding-
Elijah Mohammed, and seventy members of the Chicago Temple were arrested
by Agents of the Bureau. The charges leveled against the leaders included
Jailure to register for selective service, sedition and counseling their
followers "that members of the Temple of Islam should not go into the
Army and should ignore any cards or letters from the local draft board.
The indictments returned for sedition and conspiracy to commit eres
were dismissed in May, 1943; however, the three leaders served prison
terms for selective service violations. Of the seventy members arrested,
approzinately forty served prison terms for violation of the Selective
Training and Service Act of 1940.

During the course of the Second Worid War and the war in Korea,
such incidents were repeated throughout the country, and @ number of
convictions were secured for violations of the Selective Service acts;
and now with the threut of hostilities in the Far East, the Cult has
again taken an open stand against service in the armed forces of the
United States. They continue to include in thetr teachings such
_tnformation as:

The black people have always been helping
the devil by fighting in his wars, but the
Yuslins do not go to war but rather to jail.

Those who register will be kicked out of
the nation of Islam and will die with the
white devils.



.

Hemorandum for Mr.o Boardman:

Disloyaity and Disrespect for the United States Government:

Intertwined with defiance of the provisions of the Selective
Service acts is the vivid disloyalty to the Government and the continual
disrespect for its laws. Such comments as "no good Muslim registers
for the draft, vote or do anything else in the Devil's government, * are
repeatedly nade throughout the various temples. In 1942, Elijah Mohammed,
the leader of this Cult, described the American flag as follows: "The
flag you see, here is the flag of the white devil. The white that you
see, and notice that you don't see any black.any where on it, represents
the white race; the red represents the blood that they lose keeping it for
the white devil alone, the blue background, the white stars represent
Justice to the whites, not the red men or the black men but only for
the white devils."

4: When the United States was at war with Japan, the Cult considered
the Japanese their "little brown brothers" and gleefully predicted

the utetory of the Land of the Rising Sune At the outbreak of the war

tn Korea, the Cult immediately allied its sympathies and spoke in

glowing terms of the strength of their Korean brothers. They have
consistently referred.to their Astatic brothers in Russia, and, while

there is no evidence to prove affiliation with the Comnunist Party, many”
of the leaders have lost no occasion to rise, to the defense of the

Soviet Union in any matter inudluing difficulties between the United

States and Russia.

Observations:

Based upon an analysis of the rabid teachings of this group, it
ts definitely considered that these people present a threat to the 7
internal security of the United States, and would, with the right number
of followers and the opportunity, be more than willing to perform any
acts which would subvert American principles and endanger the existence
| Of the American nation as such. Such a potential threat could materialize
: by actual violence against civil authorities prior to a nationas
emergency as has been done by the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico or
by setzing upon the opportunity presented by a ndtionaL emergency to
commit acts of violence based upon their hatred and disloyalty to the
Government of the United States. Our instructions to the field are that
Security-type investigations are to be conducted on individual members
of the Cult who are reported to be (1) functionaries or leaders of the
Cult; (2) members of the military section of the Cult Imown as the
"Fruit of Islam" or (3) active participants in carrying out fanatical
and disloyal aims and purposes of the Cult. Individuals affiliated with
the Cult have been retained in the Security Index ofter careful evatuation
of their activities in furthering the violence and anarchist aims -and

Purposes of the Cult under thut portion of the revised Security Inder

investigation has been conducted of the activities of the organization

to the Department. It appears from the comments contained in the
Department memorandum of August 23, 1955, that an analysis of the
potential dangerousness of this organization: and its members has not
been the subject of a thorough study by the Department. The Domestic

Your attention is directed to cur memorandum to the Bureau dated
August 10, 195k, exptioned “l2ijah Mohamnsd, et al, Muslim Cult Islam,
Internal Security-MCI", in which it was stated at that time that tho
fanaticion of Muslin Cult of Islan wemboxs eppears to be of such an
extreme degrees ae to render possible an outbreak of violence by Cult
members which might be siuilar in nature toe the recently attempted assasse
ination of the members of the House of Representatives by Puorte Rican
[Nationalists. It las been ascertained that the basis for this conclusion
were the alleged revolutionary statements by ASBURY WILLIAMS, minister,
Temple $5, MCI, Cincinnatd, Osio, as reported im Bureau Report of Special
Agent Richard F. Lally, dated May 18, 195, at Cincinnati, Ohio, and
credited to Confidential Informuts Toh and T-5 of knomm reliability.

- On this point, it is to be noted that in rephy to our memorandun of
August 10, 195k, in which we requested a recevaluation of certain informants,
inoluding Confidential Inforzants Tol and T-5 of the referonced SA Lally
report, the Bureau advised on Septenber 2h, 1954 that Confidential Informant
Tol is available to testify but is mown to have furnished false information
on one cscasion, and advised further that Confidential Informant T-5 is not
available to testify. In addition, the Bureau advised on March 3, 1955,
that Confidential Informant Tel was being changed from “of Imowm reliability”
to "ef unknown reliability”. : :

In this comection, a Bureau report on ASBURY WILLIAMS dated September
Us, 195k, reflected the records of the Federal Correctional Institute ab
Milan, Michigan, as follows:

"The subject was described in 1943 as exhibiting
“ne evidence ef major psychological or neuropsychiatric
disorders. A disgnosis of the subject at that tine
indicated that he exhibited e constitutional psychopathic
inferlority with psychosis. His mental deficiency is
noted as ‘familial, border line typo's He was described
as & ‘constitutional psychopathic state = paranoid
personality? .* :
The Bureau report further described WILLIAMS as being of inferior intelligence
with & mental age of between ten and eleven years of age with an IQ. of
seventy to seventy-ines i

y In Light of this Jater acquired information, the conclusions of our
August 10, 1954 memorandun necessarily required re-evaluation. On tho basis

of available information, the onarchist and revolutionary staterents
reportediy made by ASBURY WILLIAMS and referenced in ovr August 10th
memoranduni, appear to be restricted to WILLIAMS, as a single minister
of the Cult, and a minister who appears to be extremely radical, and“
such revolutionary statements are not of a substantial scope to indicate
an aim or purpore of the Cult as enunciated by the prophet and leader,
ELIJAH MOHAMMED, for uniform compliance by all MCI temple ministers.

You have advised that as of July 15, 1955, the date of the last
statistical reviou of the Security Index, the names of 142 Gult morbers
were included in the Seeurity Index. It is requested that this Division
be furnished with a complete List of the ‘names and FBI File numbers ef the
members of the Muslim Cult of Islam currontly included in the Index.

Considering that statements and activities on the part of individual
members of the Cult, indicating anarchist and revolutionary beliefs, will
be devermining factors in concluding whether or not such individual members
cone within the reviced Secursty Index Criteria, it is deemed. vital that
this Division be kept informed of the individual members’ activities on a
continuing basis, in order that their cases may be reviewed or reerevieved

in light of any new evidence or information. Therefore, it ig requested

that you continue to conduct security=type investigations of the leaders and

Memorandum for Mr. Boardman

Memorandum from Assistant Attorney General Tompkins |
dated August 10, 1954, captioned "Elijah Mohammed, et al, |
Muslim Cult of islam, Internal Security - MCI," stated in part i
that the MCI continues to foster a program of vicious racial

hatred, fanned continually by the fanatical preaching of |
Mohammed and his ministers, bitterly denowcing the United

States Government, its flag and leaders, and proclaiming the |
eventual destruction of the country and the white people thereof.

He further stated that the fanaticism of the MCI members appears

to be of such an extreme degree as to render possible an out-

break of violence by Cult members which might be similar in

nature to the attempted assassination of the members of the

House of Representatives by the Puerto Rican Nationalists.

OBSERVATIONS:

The conclusion reached by Mr. Tompkins in regard to
the three Federal Government employees in regard to the dangerousness
of the individuals or the anarchist and violent aims and purposes
of the MCI appears contrary to the observations in his memorandum
of August 10, 1954.

Individuals deemed dangerous because of anarchist
or revolutionary acts or statements have been placed in the
Security Index both under the old Security Index criteria and
the revised criteria, even though there is no affiliation with
the CP or other Marxist revolutionary groups. The criteria
clearly spelled out this situation.

The radical group of Negroes who are members of the
MCI are lead by Elijah Mohammed. They believe he is the “True
Prophet of Allah" and believe that any civil law which conflicts
with Muslim Law should be disobeyed. The members disavow
allegiance to the United States and pledge allegiance only to
Islam. They do not consider it their duty to register for
Selective Service. The members consider themselves merely slaves
of this country who will continue to be slaves until they free
themselves. This Cult presents a threat to the internal security



Menorm dun for Mr. Boardman

Similar to that presented by the Nationalist Party of
Puerto Rico. Their training, teachings and statements
clearly depict them as potential security threats. Only
the leaders, members of the Fruit of Islam and very
active participating members have been included in the
Security Index. The three Federal employees fall within
these categoriese

ACTION:

If you approves there is attached a memorandum
to Assistant Attorney General Tompkins requesting (1) advice
as to whether the investigations of individual members of
the Gult should be continued and (2) whether the names
of the other Security Index subjects who have been placed
in the Security Index because of their anarchist and
revolutionary beliefs in affiltation with the MCI should
\be continued in the Security Indexe

Go Reference is made to your memoranda of March 31 and Kay ‘20,

4 Luslim Cult of Islam in Chicago and (2) the use of rifles in military
drills at the Cincimati temple, respectively, were not available to
testify in any criminal proceeding at that time.

Under the direction of its "Prophet," Elijah Mohammed, the +
4. Muslim Cult of Islam has established temples in avproximately ‘sixteen, 4
i leading cities in the thited States with national headouarters in ops, “

Chicago, This Cult continues to foster a program of vicious racial {,
hatred, fanned continuously vy the fanatical preachin:;s of Mohammed .
and his ministers, bitterly denouncing the United States Goverr nt, “3
its flag and leaders, and proclaiming the eventual destruction of this
country and the white people thereof, Apparently, the Muslim Cult of
Islam also continues to counsel young Celt members to evade regis—
tration under the Selective Service {ct or service in the United Stat

C Armed Forces as required under the Act. :

This refers to my memorandum of September 8, 1953 wherein |
you were advised that pursuant to your request a review of the
material submitted on the above subject would be made for the ae
purpose of determining whether prosecution will be authorized and \

f whether further investigation is desired with regard to the Selective
Service conspiracy phase of this case,

—

: The investigative reports reflect that the Moslem Cult of t

'. Islam is deseribed by informants as a vicious and fanatical organi- th
gation composed of Negroes whose members disavow allegiance to the ‘
United States and declare allegiance only to Islam and Allah's
Prophet, Elijah Mohammed, ‘The organization's rules imply civil dis~
obedience to the laws of the United States while awaiting the amihi~
lation of the White Race in the Biblical reference to the “War of
Armageddon," Ord

Tn connection with its policy of civil disobedience to
the laws of the United States, several instances bave been reported
where leaders of this Cult have, during the course of meetings, made
statements to the effect that its members should not comply with the
Selective Service Laws and to disregard orders received from their
respective local boards.

This attitude is apparently in line with its general
policy of opposition to civil authority and there is no specific
information developed which would establish that a conspiracy was
formed for the purpose of evading or counseling evasion of service
in the Armed Forces of the United States,

While there have been instances where individuals have
ounseled such evasion, it could not be established that they were
acting as part of a conspiracy and, consequently, prosecution based
on this phase of the case is not warranted, ‘In the circumstances,
> therefore, no specific investigation as to this possible violation
on the part of the organization is desired at this time, However, it
is réquested that individual instances of counseling evasion or refusal
to comply with Selective Service lawa be reported to %. Criminal,

Reference is made to your memorandum of December 30, 1952,

The file in this case has been reviewed and it is my opiniol os

i \that the evidence presently available is insufficient to establish a
violation of the Smith Act or a conspiracy to violate said Act. This -

each es

apenas

conclusion has been reached in spite of the fact that the leaders of 7
the Cult, in some measure at least, advocate the desirability of the
violent overthrow of the existing Government. However, such advocacy
= is expressed more in the nature of a prophecy that such overthrow will
inevitably come about under thé leadership of "Allah" in the "War of
Armageddon." The organization appears to have no program of action -
i which reasonably would be calculated to bring about or attempt to E Kd

3? ay" bring about the violent overthrow of the Government. In addition,
4? ait me it is pointed out that the conclusion hereinabove expressed is to
"~ ‘ aha large extent influenced by my opinion that the evidence available
at this time is insufficient to establish such a "clear and present
danger" as is required to make application of the Smith Act consti-
tutional. Dennis v. United States, 31 U.S. Lok.

I am, of course, keenly aware that an organization which
subscribes to and breeds on the fanatical beliefs of the Muslim Cult,
and which encourages bitter race prejudice and disloyalty to the
United States would, under certain circumstances, represent Ws serious

threat to our intemal security. “

with its attachment, in which you requested my views as to whether

the facts developed in the above matter warrant prosecution and also-

to be informed specifically of the extent of any further investigation
that is desirable. !

a This is in response te your memorandum of December

The facts developed in the investigation to date are :
ficient at this time to prove that men within the draft age |
actually counseled, aided and abetted by members of the organization °
to evade registration and/or service in the Armed Forces. However,
since the investigative report of November 28, 1951, reveals that.
men within the critical age group may have been told by members of
the organization not to comply with the provisions of the Selective
Service Act and to disregard orders received from their respective
local draft boards, I believe that the investigation should be con~

tinued. In connection therewith I suggest y upon ‘investigation of”

subséquent Selective Service violations by members of this cult, “that
the delinquent be interviewed, as in the past, with a w to ascer=
taining whether his delinquency_was the resigt” of “being” éounseled by
a member or members of the organization. If this fact is established, \a 23
it is requested that you endeavor to secure the names of those present a)
at that time, the date of the conversation and its substance in detail. ¢}

The information available does not reflect a violation of the
Sedition Statute, 18 U.S.C. 2387, since it does not appear that the
subject group or the members thereof have advised, counseled, urged,
or in any manner caused or attempted to cause insubordination, dis-
loyalty, mutiny or refusal of duty by any member of the military or

The desirable coverage must include, but not he
Limited to, the following investigation. These investigations
must be conducted with initiative and imagination in order that
the desired results are achieved. Each of these cases will
receive close scrutiny at the Bureau,

(1) All KBEs must be included in Priority I of

submit FD-122, :

(2) All KBEs must be included in the Black
Nationalist Photograph Album (BNPA}. Promptly submit
photograph and required background on each KBE not
presently in the BNPA and when a subject is designated
a KBE,

(3) All aspects of the finances of a KBE must
be determined. Bank accounts must be monitored. Safe
deposit boxes, investments, and hidden assets must be
located and available information regarding them must be
reported,

(4) Continued consideration must be given by
each office to develop means to neutralize the effectiveness
of each KBE, Any counterintelligence proposal must be approved
by the Bureau prior to implementation,

(5) Obtain suitable handwriting specimens of each
KBE to be placed in the National Security File in the
Laboratory, When possible, obtain specimens from public
records, law enforcement agencies, and similar sources.
Send specimens to the Bureau under separate cover letter
by registered mail for the attention of the FBI Laboratory.
When they are of value as evidence, so state in the transmittal
letter and request their return after copies have been made.
Specimens should be sufficient to permit future comparisons by

which may subsequently become subject to criminal proceedings.
Promptly record all such information in interview report form,

(7) Where there appears to be a possible violation
of a statute within the investigative jurisdiction of the
Bureau, the substantive violation character should be included
in subsequent communications and the possible violation
vigorously investigated in accordance with existing instructions.

(8) Particular attention must be paid to travel by
a KBE and every effort made to determine financial arrange-
ments for such travel. If a credit card is used, determine
its validity and the amount being charged to that card on a
continuing basis, Travel information must be submitted to
the Bureau and interested offices by appropriate communication
to permit coverage of the KBE, It will be the responsibility
of the office of origin to insure that the activities of the
KBE are covered by auxiliary offices.

(9) The Federal income tax returns of all KBEs must
be checked annually in accordance with existing instructions.

If no investigative summary report has been submitted
in each case, such a report must be submitted to the Bureau by
2/15/71, Thereafter, an investigative report should be sub-
mitted at least every 90 days. Furthermore, appropriate
communications suitable for dissemination should be promptly
submitted in the interim to keep the Bureau fully advised of
the activities of each KBE. The words (Key Black Extremist )
should be included in the character of each communication
submitted except those communications (including reports)
which are prepared for dissemination.

Eee a group of black extremists who are either key leaders or
activists and are particularly extreme, agitative, anti-Government,
and vocal in their calls for terrorism and violence, Leaders of
the violence-prone Black Panther Party have indicated that the
"revolution" is entering the beginning phases of actual armed
struggle and our investigations indicate there are certain extremists
more likely to resort to or to order terrorism as a tactic and
therefore require particular attention. :

Inasmuch as KBE individuals are of the type who would be
subject to maximum investigative attention and close supervision,
the administration and supervision of this program entails only a”
minimum amount of time above that which would normally be
expended on these cases.

The continuing revolutionary activities of the individuals
designated as KBEs warrant the close investigative and supervisory
attention required by the KBE program. This: program will be

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller
Re: Key Extremist Program

The KBE program proved to be a successful vehicle to
insure constant and uniform investigation of such individuals by
the field and the KE concept should do likewise.

: Appropriate Manual changes will be made. This program
will be reviewed in December, 1973.

RECOMMENDATION:

1. That the existing KBE program be revised to include
individuals involved in white-hate Klan-type and American Indian
extremist activity and redesignated the KE program.

2. That the attached airtel containing instructions in line
with the above be sent to all offices.

Re:. Key Extremist Program

157-8415

In order to make a thorough overall analysis and
reevaluation of the KEP at FBIHQ and to assist each office in.
analyzing the effectiveness of its own program, the following survey
is to be conducted:

I. Each office is to examine pending cases on individual

“ extremists (black, white-hate Klan-type, and American Indian) within

its territory to insure all who warrant designation as a Key Extremist
are so designated and those individuals currently designated as Key
Extremists warrant retention as same, By airtel to reach the Bureau
by 7/2/73 under the caption "Key Extremist Program, : Division,
Extremist Matters," advise the Bureau that this survey has been
completed and identify avnropriate individual extremists by name,--
character, Bureau and field file numbers under the following self-
explanatory captions:

A, "Individuals Currently Designated Key Extremists"

B. "Individuals Designated Key Extremists Who No Longer :
Warrant Retention as a Key Extremist"

C, "Individuals Who Warrant Designation as a Key Extremist"

If the answer under any one of the three captions is "None," so
state, :

II, Those offices with individual extremists listed under
above captions B and C, submit by the same date in airtel form
under the individual's case caption your recommendation for inclusion
or deletion of that individual from the KEP, Full justification
should be set out and Bureau will act on your recommendation.

III, Those offices with current individual Key Extremists
(caption A above) submit by the same date in airtel form under
the individual case caption the answer to the following questions,
by number, relative to that individual:

therein, ‘i

3, Outline the nature of the coverage you have of subject's
finances, specifically indicating if bank accounts are or are

9, Has a full. and thorough background investigation
been completed on the subject? ; :

If the answers to questions number 5 through 9 above are
in the negative, outline in another paragraph immediately under the
answer the specific steps underway or being instituted by your
office to fulfill this investigative requirement. :

"Some confusion regarding Key Extremists has arisen over
the new ADEX criteria outlined in Memorandum to All SACs 21-72 dated
9/12/72. This revised criteria make it possible to have an extremist
who warrants designation as a Key Extremist and yet does not meet the
new criteria for inclusion on the ADEX, Such individuals may continue
to be designated as Key Extremists. os

Additional confusion has also arisen over reporting require-
ments which were relaxed by above-mentioned Memorandum to All SACs.
Hereafter, individuals designated as Key Extremists are to be considered
as exceptions to the above memorandum under Item 4d, Page 8, and reports
on Key Extremists are to be regularly submitted every 90 days. If no
report has been submitted on a Key Extremist within the vast 90 days, |
promptly prepare and submit an up-to-date report and submit follow-up ;
reports thereafter on a 90-day basis.

" Section 122 of the Manual of Instructions is being revised
to outline more clearly the criteria for designating black, white-hate
Klan-type, and American Indian extremists as Key Extremists as wel! as
the ADEX status of and reporting precedures for Key Extremists.

All offices insure in the future that thew cases on individual
extremists are carefully scrutinized to see if they warrant designation
as a Key Extremist, and that an appropriate recommendation is promptly
submitted to the Bureau. :

Extremists under investigation, the identity of Key Extremists who
no longer warrant designation as such, the identity of individual
extremists who should be designated Key Extremists, and to deter-
mine if required investigative steps are being followed with respect
to those individuals designated as Key Extremists.

: Originally, all Key Extremists were to be included in the
ADEX, Recent changes in ADEX criteria require an individual included
therein to be dangerous now to national security and some confusion
has resulted in the field over whether or not Key Extremists must be
removed as Key Extremists if they do not qualify for ADEX, The field
is being instructed that this is not necessary and an individual can
be a Key Extremist and still not qualify for ADEX, Confusion also
exists as to when reports are to be submitted on. Key Extremists due
to recent relaxation of reporting rules, Original instructions
required reports on Key Extremists every 90 days and this is being
reiterated,

We currently have throughout the United States a. total of
90 individual extremists designated as Key Extremists in 27 separate
field offices, The New York Office has 19 and the San Francisco
Office has 16. The number of Key Extremists in the remaining 25
‘offices range from one to eight. The results of analysis by each
field office will be thoroughly analyzed and evaluated by the IS - 1

In view of increasing problems with which we are
faced in the overall racial field, particularly in the
development of racial intelligence concerning militant eet
black nationalist elements, we have carefully analyzed our <‘:

crash program, the following procedures will be instituted to
carry out this program. The individuals we will be con-
tacting under this crash informant program will be living in
the ghettos; therefore, in the absence of any derogatory in
formation developed, background investigation should consist
of a check of field office indices, Bureau indices, FBI

through other sources and investigation where possible.

In addition, we are specifically instructing that

With riots and racial disturbances. We_are also reiterating
the instructions that informants should be alerted and di-
rected to obtain information concerning individuals who may
be stockpiling firebombs, Molotov cocktails, and weapons,
and to identify any groups of terrorists who may be planning
on carrying on a type of guerrilla warfare during riotous
situations.

In connection with our intensive investigation of
iolack militant groups, we are requiring all offices engaged
in the Black Nationalist Groups TOPLEV Informant Program
(There are 35 field offices involved in this Program.) to
assign a minimum of one Agent to work exclusively on infor-
mant matters, The results of this endeavor will be reviewed
after a three~month pilot period and additional recommenda~
tions will be made accordingly. The field will be followed
closely to insure that the number and quality of racial in-
formants are developed at a regular rate.

(G) RACIAL INFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS -- In view of the in-
creasing problems with which we are faced in the racial field, particularly
in the development of racial intelligence concerning militant black }
nationalist elements, a careful analysis of this matter has been made in
order to insure that proper emphasis is placed where needed. Also, in
order to afford better coordination over all interrelated racial security
matters (individuals and organizations) including the development of
racial informants, supervision is now being handled by the Racial
Intelligence Section of the Domestic Intelligence Division. For your
information, the Subversive Control Section is no longer in existence.
The investigation of the Communist Party and related matters other

than those with a racial aspect are being handled by the Internal Security
Section.

Our analysis of the racial informant program has shown

there is a definite need to develop additional penetrative coverage of the “
militant black nationalist groups and the ghetto areas immediately to

be in a position to have maximum intelligence in anticipation of another ey
outburst of racial violence next summer. Ny

In line with our objective, particular emphasis is being
placed on the development of ghetto-type racial informants. Individuals
to qualify as this type of informant must live or work in an area described
as a ghetto and, therefore, have access to pertinent racial information.
The steps necessary to qualify such an individual are as follows:

(1) The individual must have access to racial intelligence
information and must be willing to cooperate with the Bureau in furnish-
ing such information.

(2) In the absence of any derogatory information developed,
it will be necessary for you to check the following: field office indices,
FBI Identification Division records, and local credit and arrest records.
Of course, you must develop sufficient background data concerning each
prospective informant to allow an intelligent, check of the foregoing
records to be made. As to the method of recommending to the Bureau
that an individual be approved as a racial informant (ghetto-type), be
guided by the instructions set out in Section 130, Volume IV, Manual
of Instructions, concerning probationary racial informants.

All individuals recommended and approyed as ghetto-type
racial informants will be considered probationary racial informants
with the word "ghetto" after the informant's name or symbol. An
example of this is "John Jones, Probationary Racial Informant (Ghetto)'
or "NY 1234-~R (PROB - Ghetto). ""

Agents handling these ghetto-type probationary racial inform-
ants must be constantly alert for any indications of character traits or
activities of these informants which might cause embarrassment to the
Bureau. In addition, the information furnished by these informants
should not be taken at face value. A diligent attempt-must be made
to verify all information furnished by these informants through other
sources and/or investigation.

In addition, immediately review all security informant files
for the purpose of determining which security informants are solely or
predominantly active in the racial field. Examples would be individuals
furnishing information concerning the Minutemen, as well as the Nation
of Islam, Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, Congress of
Racial Equality, and other militant black nationalist-type groups. The
security designation of these informants should be changed to the
appropriate racial informant designation. For example, a potential
security informant should be made a probationary racial informant and
a security informant should be designated as a racial informant. There-
after, they should be operated principally in the racial field and super-
vised by the Racial Informant Desk. When an informant is changed from
a security informant to a racial informant, the field classification
number should be changed to a 170 classification. Advise the Bureau
promptly as to which security informants are being converted to racial
informants.

Ih addition, each office having a, Black Nationalist Groups
TOPLEV Informant Program is to immediately assign at least one
Agent to work exclusively on developing informants under this Program.
Each office participating in this Program will submit at the end of a
three-month period appropriate observations as to the success of the
Program and recommendations as to its continuance.

As I have advised in the past, it is imperative and essential
that the Bureau learn of any indications of advance planning or organized

informants should be alerted and directed to obtain-information con-
cerning individuals who may be stockpiling firebombs, Molotov cocktails,
weapons, and to identify any groups of terrorists who may be planning
on carrying out a type of guerrilla warfare during riotous situations.

I expect each office to give this most important matter
priority attention in order to achieve our goal during the next six
months. Your efforts and results will be followed closely at the Bureau
and during field Inspections. Appropriate Manual changes will be

forthcoming.

The purpose of this memorandum is to recommend
approval for the attached letter to all continental field
divisions which contains instructions to furnish to the
Bureau information concerning ghetto-type informant coverage
in Negro ghetto areas where there has been violence or where
today there is a concentration of militant violence prone
black power elements and the adequacy of such’ coverage.

By SAC Letter 67-62 (G) dated 10/17/67 captioned
"Racial Informants, Racial Matters," all offices were given
instructions and guidelines for the development of ghetto-type \
racial informants in areas where potential racial violence
exists. We have aggressively followed this matterwith the
field since that time but because of the widely divergent
nature of cities across the Nation where possible racial
problems exist, we have been unable to precisely evaluate the
extent of the need of ghetto-type informants in each division.
Attached letter to all continental offices requires the submission
by each office of factual information concerning the numbers
of all Negro ghetto areas where there has been violence or
where today there is a concentration of militant violence prone
black power elements, an estimate of the population of each
such area, and statistics concerning the numbers of ghetto-type
racial informants developed to cover such areas. It also
requires that each field division advise how many ghetto
informants it believes it should have in each of the abové
type ghetto areas in order to provide the coverage require

Memorandum to Mr. W. C. Sullivan
RE: RACIAL INFORMANTS

Attached letter will serve two purposes. Each
office will have to make a factual survey of pertinent
aspects of the racial problem in all urban areas covered
by it. This survey will serve to drive home to each office
the size of the potential problem in each division and will
force each office to formulate concrete plans for developing
adequate informant coverage where such has not already been
done. Secondly, the information submitted by each office
will give the Bureau a comprehensive picture of the potential
problem in each division which will enable the Bureau to
more effectively evaluate the adequacy of the ghetto-type
racial informant program in each office. Supervisory personnel
will be able to more easily detect shortcomings and weaknesses
in any given division with this information at hand.

To obtain the information requested by this letter
should not be a burden on the field in that it should only
take the time of one Agent for less than one day to compile
the information concerning the ghetto areas from the information
already available in the field divisions. It is to be noted
that on every inspection the inspector requires the field
to identify its ghetto areas and those areas having a potential
for violence.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the attached proposed letter to all continental
field offices in accordance with the above, be approved.

area is that your coverage should be such that you are completely
knowledgeable concerning all pertinent racial activities in a

RACIAL MATTERS

PURPOSE:

To obtain authority to send the attached letter to
all Special Agents in Charge changing the maximum permissible
period between contacts with ghetto-type racial informants
from two weeks, as presently required by the Manual of
Instructions, to one month.

BACKGROUND;
na

The ghetto-type racial informant program was
established in October, 1967, to develop sources living or
working in ghetto areas who are in a position to keep the
Bureau advisedaf situations of potential violence. Ghetto-
type racial informants are distinguished from regular racial
informants in that they are not associated with or reporting
regularly on black extremists, Their primary purpose is to
detect and report on all violence~prone elements, .activities,
and situations in ghetto areas which could spark riots or
assist black extremists in any way.

REGULAR RACIAL INFORMANTS STILL CONTACTED AT LEAST EVERY
TWO WEEKS:

No change in present Manual of Instructions require-
ments that regular racial informants be contacted at least
once every two weeks is contemplated. Because of the rapport
established with ghetto-type racial informants, the field is
often able to direct such informants into membership in or
association with black extremist groups. When suchis the

RE: RACIAL INFORMANTS

case, these individuals are converted from ghetto~type racial
informants to regular racial informants. If approval is given
to extend the maximur period between contacts with established
ghetto-type racial informants to one month, any such informant
who is converted to a regular racial informant will again be
subject to the requirement that he be contacted at least once
every two weeks.

OBSERVATIONS:

Laborers, clerks, housewives, businessmen, and
numerous other types of individuals are developed as ghetto-
type racial informants. Frequent initial contacts with each
such individual are necessary (1) to establish adequate rapport,
(2) to insure that each such individual is fully aware of the
nature of and the seriousness of his assignments, and (3) to
establish adequate channels of communications suitable for
use at any time. Once these goals are achieved, the informant
can be considered established and contacts every two weeks are
no longer necessary since the primary purpose of each such
informant is to remain alert to information of value and promptly
relay same. Once a ghetto-type racial informant is established,
contacts once each month will be adequate. To definitely fix
the time at which a ghetto-type racial informant-is considered
established, the Special Agent. handling this informant will be
required to place a memorandum in informant's file stating
that requirements (1), (2), and (3), mentioned above, have been
met and that informant is considered established.

SAVINGS FROM LENGTHENING PERIOD BETWEEN CONTACTS:

. As of August 1, 1968, there were 3,248 ghetto~
type racial informants developed by the field, New informants
of this type are developed daily. Since Special Agents handling
this type informant are presently required to contact each such
individual at least once every two weeks, there are a minimum
of 6,496 contacts being made each month. Even if a contact
lasts but a few minutes, the manpower expenditure is considerable.
If the maximum permissible period between contacts is extended
to one month, manpower expenditures will be cut in half.

ACTION:

If approved, attached letter to all Special Agents
in Charge will be sent in accordance with the above and appropriate
Manual changes will be prepared. 7

situations in the ghettos which might erupt into racial violence
as well as for the purpose of obtaining information concerning
extremist activity in the ghetto areas. This program has been
productive to date; however, a review of the program in the
various field divisims has shown that certain field divisions
are getting more results from their ghetto informants than
others. In view of this, each field division should analyze

responsible for bringing about the arrest of 283 individuals
(195 local and 88 Federal arrests) as well as solving

63 cases. These informants also were responsible for bringing
about recoverles valued at $82,038.40. i

5. Information concerning high school disturbances.
Although ghetto informants aré not connected with high schools
they may well be in a position to furnish information concerning
any individuals who live in the ghettos and who are planning
or would take advantage of disturbances in high schools.

RACIAL MATTERS

Deeg ve ie 7

The attendees at the recent Specialized Training of
une Personnel conferences concerning informant matters recommended
\that instructions be furnished to the field to the effect that

in addition to having ghetto informants as listening posts, a
larger percentage of these informants be given diréction so that
they will be actively seeking racial information on a regular basis.

The Ghetto Informant Program was instituted in July, 1967,
in order that the Bureau would have access to pertinent racial
information in the ghetto areas in anticipation of outbursts of
racial violence. This program has proven to be very successful; _
however, it was noted that some field divisions were operating - {i $
their ghetto informants as listening posts and other divisions \_ 4
were actively operating the ghetto informants wby giving them :
positive assignments.

pe

It is noted we are presently operating 4,520 ghett
informants and it is essential that we have some operated as
listening posts but we would also achieve greater efficiency
if the greater number of these informants were given positive
assignments in the racial field. These assignments would include
attendance at public meetings held by extremists, surveys of
extremist bookstores, verification.of residence and employment
of Agitator and Security Index subjects who may live or work
in ghetto areas, identification of extremists who may be agitating
in a local area, as well as furnishing information concerning the
activities of youth gangs operating in the area when these activities
may tend to increase racial tensions. In addition, ghetto informants
because of their access to criminal information, could furnish
information concerning both Federal and local crimes./, a

Index subjects who may live or work in ghetto areas,
identification of extremists who may be agitating in a local
area, as well as furnishing information concerning the
activities of youth gangs operating in the area when these
activities may tend to increase racial tensions.

It is recognized that certain individuals presently
being operated as ghetto informants would be more useful in
their role as listening posts; therefore, they should be
continued as such.

In line with the above, each ghetto racial informant
file should be reviewed in connection with the regular review
of ghetto informant files in order to determine whether the informan
should be operated as a listening post or whether he should be
given positive assignments as set out above.

In the future development of ghetto racial informants
you should strive to obtain quality ghetto informants,
particularly the type which can bé operated so they will be
actively seeking racial information in their ghetto areas.

It is to be noted that when ghetto informants are furnishing
information on a regular basis concerning extremist activity
they should be designated as probationary racial informants
and the ghetto designation deleted. An aggressive and
imaginative approach te the Ghetto Informant Program will
enhance the overall Racial Informant Program in every

field division by producing on a regular basis, individuals
who can be directed to positions where they will have access
to pertinent racial information on a regular bacis.

To obtain authority to revise current poltey “with regard

to maintenance of subfiles concerning ghetto informants,

Atb3.2-tlo

As a result of recent specialized training of Bureau

personnel conferences concerning racial matters, it was recommended

' that the maintenance of field office subfiles concerning ghetto in-

/ formants be left to the option of the Special Agent in Charge (SAC).

tree Current policy requires that reports written or oral
(reduced to writing) from racial informants including ghetto
informants be filed in a field office subfile. Many ghetto
informants serve only as "listening posts" and often furnish only’
information to the effect all is quiet. This type of information
is considered positive information and according to current re« A
quirements a copy of the report should be placed in the informant/
subfile along with a copy in the racial situation control file,

{ In view of the nature 6f "Listening post!!_type infor-
mation it is believed sufficient to place a copy of the report in
the racial situation control file, thereby eliminating the
necessity for its inclusion in a subfile. The above policy change
is considered a streamlining device materially reducing paper work
currently involved in the maintenance of the ghetto filesand will
increase the efficiency of our operation.

RECOMMENDATION:

ay) Daw
That the attached SAC Letter in accordance with Aboy

- be approved and sent to all SACs. If approved, appropriate
Manual changes will be prepared.’ 4 .

(D) GHETTO INFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS -- As a result of re-
cent conferences concerning racial informants held at the Seat of Govern-
ment, it has been recommended and aj approved. that ghetto informants be
approved on the authority of the Special Agent in Charge and that the
probationary status of these informants will no longer bé necessary.
Current policy requires that before a ghetto informant can be removed
from a probationary status the Bureau must be advised that certain
specific requirements have been satisfied; thereafter, Bureau authori-
zation is given to remove the probationary status of the informant. You
will no longer be required to advise the Bureau of the identity of the
ghetto informants and your only requirement will be to give the number
of ghetto informants currently being operated by your office at the time
you submit your monthly racial informant status report.

Current investigation required concerning development
of ghetto informants will remain in effect and it will be the responsi-
bility of each SAC to assure the necessary requirements are fulfilled
before approving these informants.

In addition to the above change it will no longer be necessary
to contact any ghetto informants on a two-week basis as was required in
the handling of probationary ghetto informants. You are now required
to contact ghetto informants on a 30-day basis. :

The above changes do not affect your requirements to ob-
tain Bureau authority concerning ghetto informants who will be utilized
in connection with educational institutions.

The above changes should materially ease the administrative
handling of your Ghetto Informant Program and provide you with more
time to develop additional productive ghetto informants throughout your
territory.

Appropriate Manual changes are forthcoming.

accomplishments in the racial field on a regular basis, of ie

The Ghetto Informant Program was instituted by memorandum
G. C, Moore to Mr. W. C. Sullivan, dated 10-11-67, captioned
"Racial Informants, Racial Matters." A ghetto informant is an
individual who resides or works in an area described as a ghetto
and can furnish pertinent general racial information, At the
present time we are operating 5,178 ghetto informants and as *f) :
6-1-69 we were operating 4,067 ghetto informants. This is an Ly
increase of 1,111 ghetto informants in the past year.

During the past year ghetto informants have been responsible

not only for obtaining valuable racial intelligence in the ghetto
areas but also for bringing about the arrest of 76 individuals, 43
on Federal charges and 33 on local charges. In addition, these
informants were responsible for solving 88 other cases, nine of
which were Federal and 79 local as well as bringing about
recoveries valued in excess of $67,660. The types of cases
involved in this were bank robberies, mail robberies, stolen

automobiles, deserters, narcotics, assaults and general fugitive
matters,

As to the racial intelligence furnished by ghetto
informants during the past year it has been responsible for not
only preventing racial violence in certain areas but also for
identifying those individuals who have perpetrated violent acts
in connection with racial disturbances. These informants have
also furnished information concerning acquisitions of firearms
by racial extremists as well as information concerning individuals

who were attempting to form Black Panther groups in certain areas.

Ccopy of which is attached), sets out the Bureau instituted
a new program "ghetto informants"' to cover the ghettos of
America. The analysis in the article is based on the
stolen documents from the Media, Pennsylvania, Resident Agency.

The article sets forth that some of the specific a
assignments were to attend and report on open meetings of
knowtt or suspected black extremists, visit black Afro-type
bookstores to determine if extremist literature is available
and report on changes of the attitudes of the Negro community i.
toward the white community which may lead to racial violende.

The Ghetto Informant Program was instituted in oe
October, 1967, by memorandum dated 10/11/67 from G. C. Moore
to Mr. W. C. Sullivan captioned "Racial Informant, Racial Matters."
It was recommended and approved that the Bureau develop sources

Re: Ghetto Informant Program

This Program has been productive in furnishing racial
intelligence information which has been responsible for not
only preventing racial violence but also identifying individuals
who have perpetrated act of violence during racial disturbances,
identifying individuals attempting to sell explosives,
individuals who participated in firebombings as well as
reporting on the activities while racial disturbances were
occurring,

in addition, these ghetto informants along with all
our racial informants from January to May 31, 1971, were
responsible for bringing about the arrest_of. 237 individuals,
on both local and Federal charges, 64 of which were FBI
fugitives, as well as being responsible for the recovery of
$63,865 in stolen merchandise.

OBSERVATIONS :

The Ghetto Informant Program is a sound program even
if the liberal press stich as "The Washington Post” using
stolen documents attempts to imply that the Bureau through
this Program is checking on every black living in a ghetto
arga. Such a task would be impossible, At the present time
we_have-6,301. ghetto informants throughout the U.S. These’

wil are mostly Negro individuals who are cooperating with the
, a3 Bureau in order to help fight the extremist and criminal
i New + {elements in their neighborhoods which jeopardize and disrupt

fice’s “Racial Squad.”

“Any dissemination of this
information outside the Bu.
reau must be adequately
paraphrased,” the meoran-
dum warned, “in order to
protect this highly sensitive
source.”

Unfortunately for the bu-
Teau, the memo was dissemi-
nated in the most unortho-
dox way—with its raw tone
of tedious snooping unpara-
phrased—by burglars who
broke into an FBI office at
Media, Pa., March 8, They
stole 800 to 1,000 documents
that night; approximately 10
per cent of them have since
been made public, copied
and sent to various newspa-
pers which have described
them in a series of articles.

Considered as a whole,
those Media documents
offer the public and Con-
gress an unprecedented
glimpse of how the U.S, gov-
ernment watches its citizens
particularly hlack citizens.

For, while mbny may con.
sider it natural enough for
the FBI to keex| an eye on

Attempting to draw gener-
alizations from the stolen
parers is a perilous exer-
cise, because the press and
public havt—been shown
only a fraction of what was
burglarized. The clandestine
group that calis itself the
“Citizens Commission to In-
vestigate the FBI” clearly
has been selective in its dis-
tribution—in some cases, re-
vealing only parts of docu-
ments, 7

An FBI memo, which at
first reading seems to reveal
investigative harassment or
unjustified invasion of pri-
vacy, could well be—if other
accompanying — documents
were available—part of legi-
timate surveillance in pur-
suit of crime and criminals.

In_ that-sernse; the Media
revelations are inherently
unfair to the Bureau, There
is no way for the agency to
refute many of the implica-
tions without opening its
confidential files to public
inspection. PPL

In addition, Because the
papers are confidential, he

tably one of subterfuge—the
feeling that the FBI has

questidn. The FBI contends
always that its investigative
activitie}, past and’ present ,
are in accordance with in-
structions from the Justice
Department and the Attor-
ney General. Nothing in the
Media file refutes that
claim.

But, while the Media bur-
glars have been selective in
what they showed the pub-
lic, so have the federal offi-
cials. Both the FBI and the

‘to explain surveillance in
black neighburhoots.and to
justify it, the assistant attor.
ney general for internal se-
curity, Robert Mardian, has
revealed two paragraphs
from a 1967 memorandum
by then Attorney General
Ramsey Clark, a Democrat
who more recently has been
a critic of government intru-

sions on civil liberties, The .

excerpt, by ifiself, sounds
like a sweeping! directive to
spy on Americén Negroes:
“It is imperafive that the
department seek to obtain
the most comprehensive in-
telligence possible regard-
ing organized or other pur-
Poseful stimulation of do-
mestic dissention, civil dis-
orders and riots. To carry
out these responsibilities,
we must make full use of
and constantly endeavor to

telligence ‘available to us,
both from internal and ex-
ternal sounees, concerning
serials and individu.

als throughput the country .
Who may piay a role in ci-

ther instigating or spreading
disorders or in preventing
or checking them.” 7



e
But the

e—Tustice Depart-
ment has declined to release
the entive text of Clark’s
memorandum or the other
accompanying directives as
well as any of the guidelines
et the incumbent Attor-
ney General has iss
» the subject. iit
Clark acknowledges that
he gave such an order, but
his memory is vague about
what restrictions, if
any, were placed on the
scope of the surveillance.
‘The purpose, he said, was to
-develop more reliable intel-
ligence about urban riot sit-
uations so that the federal
government could make a
measured response—a move
which was also recom-
mended by the liberal-ap-
plauded Kerner report.

Clark also wanted to settle ©

the politically volatile ques-
tion of whether a national
conspiracy lay behind the
urban disofders. “Of course,
we never; found one,” he
said. :

“We felt first, a high obli-
gation to be on top of that
Situation,” Clark recalled,

“and, second, that the bu: .
reau was not doing an ade- °

quate job. On methods, we
may have been a little loose.
I just don’t know.”

* Clark feels that if all of
the memoranda were availa-
ble they would show that he
did not issue an open-ended
order without limitations. In
the absence of those official
guidelines, however, the Me-
dia documents, despite their
aps, are still the most com-
plete statement on what the
FBI is doing, Tested against
the experiences of former
FBI agents from other field
offices, some generalizations
are possible,

Bookstores, churches, sa-
loons, storefront community
organizations, campuses and
student " organizations—all
apparently are fair game if
they bear the prefix “Afro”
or if they become classified
through some unrevealed
process as “black militant”
a “militant extremist.” It is
almost as if fhe government
decided to vi oy on all tw
yers who engage in politics
because, as (veryone knows,
some lawyers in politics
turn out to be crooks.

2989649 Page 800

The memoranda prescrib-
ing the xacial surveillance
sound like instructions for
agents being sent to a for-
cign country and, indeed,
only a handful of the FBI's
agents were black when the
escalation in surveillance oc-
curred in 1968 (fewer than 2
per cent of the more than
8,000 agents are black

. today).

One directive from Phila-
delphia’s—sgecial agent in
charge (the SAC in bureau
parlance) even told the 180
agents where to go in search
of “obtaining maximum
productivity from the ghetto
informants developed ~ by
each individual office.”

The SAC gave the ad-
dresses of 10 bars and cafes,
three bookstores, a church
and the headquarters of five
community — organizations.
Among nine specific assign-
ments for informants were
these: ji
© “Attend and report on
open meetings of known or
suspected black extremist
organizations . . .

¢ “Visit Afro-American
type bookstores for the pur-
pose of determining if mili-
tant extremist literature is
available therein and, if so,
to identify the owners, oper-
ators and clientele of such
stores... t

© “Identify (black extre-
mist militants \who attempt
to influence th? Negro com-
munity and report on the ef-
fect of such efforts...

¢ “Report on changes in
the attitude of the Negro
community toward the white
community which may lead
to racial violence.

© “Report on all indica-
tions of efforts, by foreign
powers to take over the
Negro militant movement.
In those cases where you
have an exceptionally intel-
ligent and knowledgeable in-
formant, such an informant
may be given the assign-
ment of reporting on the

general mood of the Negro ,

community concerning sus-

- ceptibility to foreign influ-
ence whether this be from
African nations in the form
of Pan-Africi irom the
Soviet or* ese commu-
nist bloc nations, or from
other nations.”

‘The airectve closed with
a reminder to|plan ahead:
“The Buregu has also in-
structed that we immedi-
ately ascertain among all
Negro informants, including
ghetto informants, which in-

“formants are planning to

enter college this fall and
would be in a position to in-
filtrate black power groups
on campuses, Bureau de-
sires that we furnish them
with the identities of these
informants and the colleges
they plan to attend.”

What the FBI wanted to
find out~and presumably
still seeks—was not so
much the solution to a
crime or the identity of
eriminals, but the answer to
a highly complicated social-
political question that has
baffled the most sophisti-
cated urban investigators:
when and wkere would the
next riot occul'?

An earlier memo, dated in
late February, |1968, outlined
the prob'em “for Philadel-
phia agents:

“It is a major part of our



responsibility to learn in
vance, if that is human!
possible,"If a Fist is planned
or is expected to occur. In
this way, it may be possible
to actually forestall a riot or
at least to be better pre-
pared if it does happen.”

This new responsibility
meant, in effect, reporting
on every demonstration.
planned,, regardless of
whether it produced disor-
der or a violation of any fed-
eral laws. The SAC warned,
a bit grimly, it seems:

“Whether or not a riot
does accur, the Bureau
holds us responsible to keep
the Bureau, the Departmnet
and the White House ad-
vised in advance of each
demonstration. The Bureau
expects this coverage to
come through informant
sources primarily, In addi-
tion, we must advise the Bu.
reau at least every two
weeks of existing tensious
and conditions which may
tigger a riot.”

To accorpplish that, a new
category (f informant was
creared, employing the new-

ly fashionable shorthand for
any black neighborhood:

“Racial Informant—Ghetto.”
‘They would be anyone, white
or black, who happened to

have contact in the “ghetto,”

from taxi drivers and liquor
store clerks to janitors and
bill collectors. ‘These

“Ghetto Informants” would

be distinct from the FBI's

regular “Racial Informants”

who were infiltrating “blac’s

nationalist and black revolu-

tionary groups.” Each agent -
was directed to bring back:

at least one “ghetto inform-

ant”.

The Bureau suggested
that some established crimi-
nal and internal-security in-
formants could be converted
to the new assignment. Phil-
adeiphia was subdivided by
streets and areas to insure _
complete coverage.

I£ one assumes that this
same command went out to
all field agents, that means
that the FBI was catalogu-
ing for starters something
like 8,000 informants, just to
cover the ‘“ghettoes” of
America, But these numbers
cannot be trusted; the total
might have it\volved many
more racial inj formants or it
just may have'been an exer-
cise in expanded paperwork,

pers and impact varied con-

iderably.
stone Neteran of the Wash-
ington, D.C,, field office (not
to be confused with the bu-
reau’s headquarters here,
commonly referred to as
SOG for Seat of Govern-
merit) ‘recalled that they
were given a much more
ambitious goal for the Capi-
fal’s black majority. They
were first told to recruit at
least six “ghetto inform:
ants” apiece. That was later
modified to three each, then
one each, he said.

“In fact,” he related, “only
guys on the Racial Squad
did anything about it”

‘Another ex-agent in a dif-
ferent field office remem:
pered an order to gather
thrée or four “ghetto” con-
fact\ for preriot surveil:
lance but, again, he did not
think’ that goal was ever

genuinely fulfilled. “It just

made for a tremendous
amount of paperwork,” he
said. “Ninety per cent of the
informants were worthless.”

‘By the accounts of former.
agents, many “informants”
were little more than names
and addresses in the files.

They had been submitted

after routine investigations

and only limited contacts.

Months later, the agent

might submit a follow-up

memoranduin, withdrawing
the “potential racial inform-
ant” as unreliable or no

Jonger available, then sub-

‘mit new names. That, the

exagents said, produced a

statistical picture of heavy .

activity in developing new
informants, but not * much
genuine intelligence.

The irony, according to
the yiewpoint of several ex-
agen\s, is that the Media
‘docurents may portray the
FBI surveillance “ ah
more ‘penetrating than it
really is.

Nevertheless, as the
Media documents _ testify,
the. FBI has succeeded in in-
filtrating some black organi-
zations (though the papers
do not reveal whether the
“ghetto” recruiting goal was
ever met). A collection of the
memorand spanning the re-
cent years mentions 14
coded ‘racial informants in
the Philadelphia area and
indicates that they are es-
tablished sources who have
passed the test of.reliability
and who presumably are
paid for their information,

or jteni-by-item.

yatta, has_ specialize.
Very’ pubifeconzrontations
over such issues as church
“reparations” to black 'peo-
ple. Kenyatta’s activities
have been well covered by
the local press and the Phil-
adelphia police.

At least two racial inform-
ants — PH897R and PH
307-R — were providing the
FBI with reports on the pri-
vate coming-and-going of
Kenyatta as recently as Feb-
ruary. None of the informa-
tion contained in the reports
distributed by the Media
burglars suggests that Ken-
yatta is moving away from
public confrontations into
clandestine subversion or
sabotage. iz

On the contrary, one in-
formant describes Kenyat-
ta’s plans for “a new
stronger organization which
will bring in other black
groups in the city of Phila-
delphia.” The #BI learned,
among other |things, the
names of the| prospective
chairmen for 1d subcommit-
tees, ranging from Church
Relationships to Ways and
Means. The planning makes
Kenyatta sound more like a
PTA chairman than a revo-
jutionary, except for two of
his subcommittees — Tacti-
cal, described by the inform-
ant as reparations and con-
frontation, and Defense, de-
scribed as self-defense or
legal defense.

"fo learn more about this
man and his organization,
the FBI turned to his bank
and the telephone company,
both of which were coopera-
tive. The Southeast National
Bank provided copies of can-
celled checks and monthly
statements that showed bal-
ances in 1970 fluctuating

from a higi| of $1,948 toa _

low of $38.

‘The Bell ‘telephone Co. of
Pennsylvanik supplied the
investigator with the Ken-
yattas’ unlisted phone num-
‘ber (but cautioned that this
should not be made public
without first going through
the motions of issuing a sub-
poena for it).

The Media papers, frag-
mentary as they are, do not
really establish how wide-
spread that sort of surveil-
lancet is. Again, the ex
agerits with experleyce in
other cities suggest that is
was the common practice,
not the exception.

NW 68262 Docld:32989649 Page 802

Two former agents who
servec-—together on the
Washington field office’s Ra-
cial Squad agreed that sur-
veillance of black groups
was conducted broadly,
though they came away
from their bureau jobs with
vastly different attitudes
about it. One of them was so
disgusted that it led to his
resignation. The other found
the, work fascinating and ed-
ucational,

“It was very racist,” said
one of them. “The bureau
was interested in anything
or anyone that said black. If
I were to start an organiza.
tion called ‘Friends of
Blacks,’ chances are I would
be investigated. You
couldn’t convince them that
they had no right to investi-
gate all over’ the lot willy-
nilly.”

The secqnd agent, his for-
mer colleague, did not argue
with this description of the
seope, but {insisted that the

illance was not “racist”
om other” squda@ were at
work covering white groups
with equal vigor, particu-
larly New Left dissidents.

“It was something new
and interesting to me,” he
recalled. “I saw things dif-
ferently, things I'd never
seen before about the col~
ored, I used to enjoy going
around with Stokely Carmi-
chael. He was a damn good
speaker. If he could find his
cause, he could be a great
leader.”

Several former agents
added another distinction.
Prior to the urban riots, bu-
Treau agents followed various
civil rights groups, always
on the pretext of potential
foreign attachments. Offi-
cially, they were investigat-
ing to see if the civil rights
movement was being infil-
trated by Communists under
foreign domination. After
1967, the ex-agents said, that
distinction was dropped and
any group ‘Which might be
characterized as “black mili-
tant” or “extremist” became
a subject of concern in its
own right.

None of this probably
would shock many of the
“black militant” citizens
who are being watched. For
years, various civil rights
leaders have complained
about the FBI, even before
the increased surveillance
stimulated by the riots.

. Some of them insisted
that the real purpose was to
destroy their organizations
by stimulating paranoia—
fear of infiltration which
makes fellow members sus-
picious of one another,
splinters a group into fac-.

. tions and inhibits the re-

eruiting of new members.
‘That was a factor, ‘certainly,
in the FBI’s successful pene-
tration of the Communist
Party and the Ku Klux Klan
—although few people ob-
jected when the tactic was
used against those organiza-
tions, - : 5
Curiously, oe Media doc- *
ument mentiofis “paranoia”
as government weapon
against its citizens, A Phila-
delphia agent, reporting on
an SOG conference on the
New Left held last Septem-
ber, notes:



“There was a p.etty gen-
eral consens} more in-
terviews with these subjects
and hangers-on are in order
for plenty of reasons, chief
of which are it will enhance
the paranoia endemic in
these circles and will fur-
ther serve to get the point
across there is an FBI agent
behind every mailbox.”

On the record, the present
administration has said that
its racial intelligence-gather-
ing related to civil disturb-
ances is a continuation, with
a few refinement}, of what
was started unde} Ramsey
Clark and the Democrats.
Privately, Justice Depart-
ment officials have hinted
on several occasions that At-
torney General John N.
Mitchell has actually been
more restrictive, though
they have offered no evi-
dence of that,

sures from the Media files

gress for 1,00 additional

NW 68262 Docld:32989649 Page 803

Thgs and burnings, the bu-
reau ordered all of its 59
field offices—to~investigate
and, if possible, to infiltrate
every black student organi-
zation in the country, not
just at the campuses where
disorders had occurred, but
at every four-year college
and junior college. HE

‘The memorandum is
dated Nov. 4, 1970, @ period
when campuses were quict,
put the tone is urgent. It
linked campus trouble in-
volving black students with
“{nfluence and control by vi-
olence-prone Black Panther
Party and other extremists.”
"The order indicated that the
jpureau was increasing and
reemphasizing an area of
surveillance which already
hhad been opened.

“We must target inform-
ants and sources to de-
velop information regarding
these groups on a continu-
ing basis to fulfill our re-
sponsibilities and to develop
stich coverage where none
exists,” the director said.

“Gffective immediately,
all BSU’s and similar organ-
izations organized to project

the demands of black stu-
dents which are not pres-
ently under investigation,
are to be subjects of dis-
creet, preliminary inquiries
jimited to —_ established
sources ant\ carefully con-
ducted to avoid criticism, to
determine the size, aims,
purposes, activities, leader-
ship, key activists, and
extremist interest or influ-
ence in these groups. Open
jndividual cases on officers
and key activists in each

group to determine back-

ground and if their activi-
fies warrant active investi-
gation.”

In the Philadelphia area,
that meant black-student or-
ganizations on 13 campuses,
each case-“opened and as-
signéd” under the heading
of “Racial Matter,” with ad-
ditional individual files on
the officers and “key activ-
jsts.” Across the nation,
there are now about 500,000
lack collegians and proba-
bly a couple of thousand
campus groups called Black
Student Union or Afro-A-
merican Society. Most of
them, of course, were “ol
ganized to project the de-
mands of black students,” as
the FBI put it, but only a
small minority have been as-

sociated with violent disor-_

ders.

In addition to the cam-
-by-campus investigation,
FBI aimed its resources

at the National Association
of Black Students, a fledg-
ling Washington-based
group that is trying to form
a_ loose national affiliation
of black college groups.

Last summer, all agents
were alerted to have “logi-
cal’ informants” attend the
first NABS convention in
Detroit, NABS is an “RM”
too. The directive suggests
that the FBI was already
successful in infiltrating at
least Some Black Student
Unions,

_, One of the most troubling
items on racial surveillance
is the last one, a memoran-*
dum fromi late February of
this year describing what
the FBI found out from
three informant sources
about the Black Student

Union at Pennsylvania Mili-

tary College, a gifiet campus

in Chester. What they found

was a “basicall}) dormant”

organization, yeti instead of °
closing the file and forget-

ting the matter, the agency

decided to open new files on

two leaders of the organiza

tion—just in case.

“These sources,” the mem-
orandum reported, “de-
scribed the BSU as a some-
what disorganized group of
students, possibly having ,a
membership and/or follow- «
ing of no moge than 30 stu-
dents and posjibly as few as
a half dozen,iwho have not
displayed radjeal or militant
ideas, and do'not appear to
be aligned: with any radical

~ or black militant groups.”

That sounds like a clean
bill, even under the broad
standards which the FBI ap-
plies in deciding who should
be watched. The memoran-
dum even described “Black
Festival Week,” held on the
campus last October, as a
flop, Nevertheless, accord-
ing to the. document, the
FBI is still watching the
leaders of this organization.
The memo acknowledged
the lack of damaging infor- .
mation, then directed: .

“Philadelphia will, how-
ever, open cages on the indi-
vidual Teadert listed as the
leaders of the BSU and in-
formants wil be developed



on these individuals so that
this office i e of their
identity and background.”

The incident frames a cru-
cial question about the FBI
surveillance, not just of
black spying but of political
black organizations, but of
political dissidents gener-
ally: when does the spying
stop?

If one accented the idea
that the FBI has a right at
least to look into any and all
organizations which had
‘probable cause” to be what
it regards as potentially sub- .
versive or ‘the source of
crime or disorder, then pre-
sumably the agency would
follow some procedure for
taking a “first look” to test
its.suspicions. * H

lf the “probable cause”
proved to be unfounded,
then the case would be
ciosed, the surveillance

stopped, ideally, the dossier |
destroyed. The case of Penn-
sylvania Military College
suggests that, on the con-
trary, the dgents keep the
tiles active,/even when they
know the subject is harm-
less.

‘The Media documents pro-
vide no conclusive answer to
this question, but they do
cofitain a series of similar
exumples of the FBI men
passing the threshhold of an
initial investigation without
accepting the negative re-
sults as grounds for closing
the file.

In one bizarre case, the
Philadelphia agents spent
some energy tracking down
Norman John Shore after an
Army intelligence unit in
Europe intercepted seven ,
letters between Shore and
pecple in East Germany.
They dealt with Shore’s
visit to a “Bree German
Youth” camp. When the
agents learned ?that the sub-
ject was only Is years old,
they decided jto close the
case—but switdhed their in-
vestigation to his father,

TA another. document, a
confidential informant, PH
948-S, recounted his evening j
aw. the “Bernheim Com-
mune,” chatting with sev-
eral men about New Left
politics while a Women's +
Liberation meeting was |
under way in an adjoining
room. The men and sorile of
the women were already’ the
subjects of individual sur-
veillance files as “intyrnal
security” ‘cases; so” was

but are not organizational
types and not personally ac-
tivists.” Despite that assess-
ment, the agent’s memoran-
dum closes with instructions
to open and assign a new se-
curity case on the Bernheim
Commune.

In a similar vein, a 1969
memo indicates that the
government is interested in
infiltrating a meeting of the
War Resisters International
at Haverford College for po-
litical propaganda purposes
in conngction-with the Paris
Peace talks, not to detect
potential crime,

"The organization is a radi-

cal pacifist league which has
been producing antiwar
propaganda for several gen-
erations. Its meeting at Hav-
erford was open to press
and ‘public, but the FBI

memo alerted 22 “security ©

informants.”

“Determine its scope and
whether or not there are
any indications it will gener-
ate any anti-U.S. propa-
ganda,” the orders said. “Be
most discreet in handling
this matter.”

Former FBI agents, asked
about their own experiences,
express conflicting views on
this question. Several think
the FBI is reasonably care-
ful about checking out a “se-
curity” or “racial” ‘subject,
then droppitig the case if it
proves unproductive, “A lot
are glminaled by the first
look,” said jpne ex-agent. “I
think they're doing a pretty
good job.”

But others disagree rather
strongly. The system which’
they describe never forgets
a name. Once someone
comes under surveillance,
they contend, it is‘hard to
drop him, One. agent de-
scribed an example:

“In practice, Joe Doaks
gives a speech. He says it's
abgat time forja revolution
in this country. So we take a
determine
that hes’ a straight guy, just

got tartied away, no bomb ,

thrower.

“But then you can’t close
the investigation, becaltse
yol’ve got to get back
grdund, to make sure he’s
okay. Meanwhile, maybe he
makes another speech some-
where and the bureau or an-
other field office asks, ‘Who
is this guy? Once a guy
makes a public name for
himself, it’s almost impossi-
ple to close it.” pect

Some of the bureaticratic
pressure that the ex-agents
cite is evident in the Media
papers, One memorandum
mentions the “credit” sys-
tem under which individual
agents and field offices
score points with their supe-
riors when a case is solved
or stolen property re-

overed, FE
- Agents were urged td use
il informants for solying
but promised thet an
agen) would be given ‘full
credit” for his piece of the
action, even if another



squad made the final ““~ust.
In addition, when the its

were ordered to ob: at
Jeast one ‘ghetto,informant”

apiece, the field office ac-
knowledged that this might
be impossible for some, but
they should protect them-
selves against possible criti-
cism:

“If an individual RA (rési-

-dent agent) covers only a

county which does not en-
compass any municipality
containing a ghetto, so spec-
ify by memorandum form
170-6 with a copy for the
RaA’s error folder, so that he
will not. be charged with
failure to perform.”

With that sort,of encour-
agement, .t-would seem nat-
ural for a special agent to
spread the fruits of his in-
vestigating as broadly 2s
possible, Indeed, again and
again, the Media memos
demonstrate the great pro-
liferation of paper recording
and disseminating even in-
significant discoveries.

The Philadelphia “Secu-
rity” investigation of Jac-
queline Reuss, daughter
‘of the Wisconsin congress-
men, though it discovered
nothing derogatory about
her, was forwarded for files
in Washington, Milwaukee
and Alexandrja, Va.

Seven copies of a report
on a Univerfity of Califor-
nia student were distributed
to files across the country
repeating the allegation that
she is “an inveterate Marx-
ist revolutionist,” although
the field investigation failed
to substantiate that. .

A student at the Univer-
sity of Maryland’s Eastern
Shore campus was investi-
gated as a “black national-

* ist” and described as a “con-

stant source of agitation” on
the campus in recent years.
Thirteen coples of the re-
port went to dossiers on him
in six cities. | :
The FBI files do have a
long memory. That is also
demonstrated clearly by the
Media documents on old left
eases which show the
agency keeping an eye on
people and organizations lit-
erally for decades on the
presumption that they are
potentially dangerous.
There is no “first look”
test applied apparently,
‘one a person or group falls
jntbh this category, even if
we a number of years no
evidence develops to suggest
they are about to omit 8
crime. 7

NW 68262 Docld:32989649 Page 805

One memorandum, for
instance, notes that the FBI
maintais—an® interest in
watching such long-estab-.
lished and public antiwar
groups as the Women's In-
ternational League for
Peace and Freedom, SANE
and the American Friends
Service Committee—but
agents were instructed not
to mix them with New Left
groups who were more dan-
gerous —the “violent and
terroristic-minded young an-
archists.”

In one instance, the FBI
reached back in its collec
tiye memory 30 years,
Agents in Washington were
trying to establish a Latin
‘American employee at an in-
ternatidrat organization
here as a double agent to
spy on Cuba. In their search
éf his background, they dis-
covered that his brother was
a Communist candidate for
‘a minor post ina Maritime
‘Union election, held on the
docks of New Orleans in
1940.

Jn’ still another example
from the Media papers, the
Philadelphia agents were
seanning the background of
a Quaker pacifist, a radio
engineer, who had invited a
Czech folklore scholar to
visit and lecture in the
‘United States in 1966, In the
files, they found a variety of
‘items: {

Quaker’ and his wife were
on the pddressograph plates
of the Fair Play for Cuba
Committee in New York.

Religious Society of Friertds,

. That the engineer has ine
dicated td his employer that

he js not a member of any
subversive organizations but
“during the Spanish Civil
War (1936), he attended
many public meetings which
he believed were sponsored
by groups which are cited
and consequently his name
has apparently been listed
‘on the mailing lists of sev-
eral of these organizations.”

@ A 1956 report, which ap-
parently inspired the 1957
investigation, that the man’s
wife had corresponded with
the Yugoslav State Tourist
Olfice in New York—Whose
dirgetor according to an
‘other confidential “seurce,
was actually an intelligence”
agent.

Maybe the thousands of
hams and organizations
whi(h the FBI is now,cata-

itartt, New Left radical—will
be handled differently, but

i ee?

In order to increase the ee SE the Ghetto
Informant Program, there is attached for approval an airtel to
all continental field offices instructing that each Special Agent
in Charge (SAC) thoroughly evaluate the Ghetto Informant Program
in his respective division and submit recommendations for
improving the program in line with the guidelines set forth by
the Bureau.

The Ghetto Informant Program was instituted 10+11+67.
A ghetto informant is an individual who resides or works in an
area described as a ghetto and can furnish general information
concerning extremist activity. When originally instituted, the
gliétto informant was mainly a listening post; however, with the
change in extremist activities, a good number of these informants
were ‘given positive assignments, which assignments definitely
: incteased the productivity in certain field divisions.

. At the present time we are operating 6,541 ghetto
informants. This is a valuable reservoir of individuals who
“should be elevated into positions in extremist organizations.

In addition, by increasing the productivity of the ghetto
informants, the Bureau will be in a position of obtaining vy Jes
additional criminal statistics. pu

It is to be noted that in addition to obtaining
information concerning extremist activities, the ghetto informants
along with other extremist informants since January 1, 1971, have
been responsible for bringing about the arrest of 445 individuals on
both local and Federal charges, 127 of which were FBI fugitives, as

well as being responsible for the recovery of $193,181.28 in
stolen merchandise. With the increase in extremist activity as
seen by the disturbances in penal institutions, the unprovoked
attacks against police and the definite trend concerning
guerrilla warfare throughout the U.S., we must accelerate our

| penetration of extremist groups.

Accordingly, in order to fully utilize our vast
reservoir of ghetto informants, it is believed each SAC should
be instructed to evaluate the Ghetto Informant Program in his
division along the following lines.

1. Ascertain the number of ghetto informants that
have been elevated into extremist organizations. 2. Determine
what percentage of the ghetto informants are given positive
assignments on a regular basis. 3. Evaluate the extremist
intelligence accomplishments of the ghetto informants in the
particular field division. 4. Evaluate the criminal
statistical accomplishments, 5, Set forth specific steps
being taken to not only increase the productivity of the
Ghetto Informant Program but also the steps being taken to
elevate the ghetto informants into extremist organizations,

Upon receipt of the above from each continental field
office, analysis will be made and appropriate instructions will
be furnished all field divisions concerning the future handling
of ghetto informants.

ACTION:
That attached airtel to all ‘continental field offices

be approved furnishing instructions concerning the ghetto
informants as set out above. coe |

community (ghetto areas); therefore, our ghetto informants
must ‘be targeted to obtain information concerning this
guerrilla warfare activity.

In order to fulfill our responsibilities in this a
field, each field division must promptly improve both the
number and quality of ghetto informants in accordance with the
guidelines set forth below: (1) New ghetto informants
developed must be the type who can obtain information concerning
black extremists who are operating in the ghetto areas and
planning or perpetrating guerrilla-type activities such as
robberies, attacks on police, and other violent activities;
(2) The recent survey of ghetto informants showed that the
productivity of the program in each field office was in direct
relation to the percentage of ghetto informants being given
positive assignments, Those field divisions achieving greater
productivity are the ones who had a greater percentage of their
ghetto informants being given positive assignments, Accordingly,
on your FD-405b setting forth your extremist informant accomplish-
ments you must set forth the percentage of your ghetto informants
being given positive assignments,

Each ghetto informant must be evaluated on a yearly
basis; and if it is determined that the informant has not
produced positive extremist intelligence-type information, which
information would include criminal-type information, the informant
must be closed and a new ghetto informant developed.

It is expected that the quality and quantity of ghetto
informants will be improved in the near future in order that the
Bureau may fulfill its responsibilities in the extremist
intelligence field.

Purpose of this memorandum is to obtain approval for’
attached airtel to all continental field offices instructing that
the extremist ghetto informant program be upgraded in accordance
with the guidelines set out in order to increase the productivity
of this program and to obtain information concerning the present
Phase of extremist activity, namely, the guerrilla warfare phase. ¢

By airtel dated 9/22/71 all continental field offices
were instructed to evaluate the ghetto informant program. These %
evaluations have been received and reviewed. The review clearly
shows that those field offices giving the majority of their ghetto
informants positive assignments are achieving not only positive
intelligence information but also valuable criminal statistical
accomplishments, These informants, since 2/1/71, have been
responsible for bringing about the arrest of 111 individuals, 51
of which were Bureau fugitives, and the recovery of $49,999 in
stolen merchandise, weapons, and cars. SS

\ In addition, we are now seeing another phase of extremist
activity, that is the guerrilla warfare phase, as opposed to the
mass demonstrations which occurred in the past, Extremists are
involved in expropriations (robberies), killing of police,
and other terroristic activities, The extremists involved in
guerrilla warfare have very limited or no contact with the
aboveground extremist organizations; therefore, our coverage has
been limited in this respect. The guerrilla operates within the |
community (the ghetto area), and this is the area where we also uaa
operate our ghetto informants; thetefore, our ghetto informants

This is to justify continuance of captioned program
in view of the fact that this program is producing substantial
accomplishments in the extremist field on a regular basis,

During the past year these informants have furnished
intelligence information concerning extremist activities which
has-brought about the arrest of Black Panther Party (BPP) members
on armed robbery charges, identified individuals responsible for
a fire bombing of a food store, identified individuals who have
been involved in murder cases, as well as information which
brought about the recovery of weapons and ammunition, and
information which has been of assistance to local police in
handling civil disturbances,

hd While the primary objective of the ghetto informant i
program is to obtain information concerning extremist activities, ;
it also provides substantial accomplishments in the criminal 7
field in that these informants either live or work in ghetto
areas which are usually high crime areas. During the period
7/1/71 to 4/30/72 ghetto informants were responsible for bringing
about the arrest of 305 individuals (174 local and state, 131
Federal), of whom 85 were FBI fugitives, In addition, these
informants were responsible for the recovery of $174,994 which
included 37 stolen automobiles, Weapons, ammunition, narcotics,
and other contraband. : 5- “Pid

eccur in the form of disturbances and riots. As the program
progressed it was noted that these informants could be operated
in such a manner to increase their value by giving them positive
assignments to develop information concerning black extremists
who are operating in ghetto areas and planning or perpetrating
guerrilla-type activities such as robberies, attacks on police,
and other violent activities, In addition, the field has
constantly been reminded of the potential of ghetto informants
to obtain criminal information in addition to the extremist
intelligence, and this has paid off as indicated above.

Information has recently been developed indicating
black extremists are obtaining funds by robbing narcotics
dealers. Accordingly, the field has been instructed to target
ghetto informants specifically toward ascertaining the identities
of narcotics dealers in their particular areas as well as
obtaining information concerning plans of black extremists to
rob these individuals.

The ghetto informant program is a sound program and
is analyzed on a regular basis through field inspections,
inspections at FBI Headquarters, and through supervision by
the Domestic Intelligence Division. In view of the need for
extremist intelligence information provided by this program
and its productivity, it is believed this program should be
continued, and it will be reevaluated in July, 1973.

ACTION:

If approved, this program will be continued and
rejustified in July, 1973.

This is to obtain authority to implement a modified
ghetto informant program which will reduce the number of ghetto
informants by fifty per cent without impairing the efficiency
of the operation.

After careful analysis of the ghetto informant pro-
: gram during the recent inspection of the Domestic Intelligence
& Division, it was concluded that a modified ghetto informant pro-
gram would streamline and improve efficiency of the existing
program. This will be achieved by having only Special Agents
t assigned to extremist matters handling ghetto informants.
‘ Experience has shown that Special Agents experienced in extremist
matters are in a better position to achieve maximum use of ghetto
| informants.

| Growing civil unrest in the mid-1960s createdf an urgent
| need for a comprehensive network of "listening post" type sources
within ghetto areas to provide advance intelligence inf$rmation
relating to civil unrest. To fill this need the ghe€td’ informant
program was initiated on October 11, 1967.: The ghetto™informant ©
program proved highly successful and subsequently these informants
i were directed to areas of greater responsibility in addition to ~
q their "listening post" function. A notable bywrreduct of these

explosive element smo\{ldering within the ghetto areas throughout
the Nation. This volatile force, more sophisticated than in the
past, frequently surfaces in the form of urban guerrilla terrorist-
type activities often by unaffiliated extremists, resulting in the
sniping and killing of police, firebombings, and. other violent
criminal activities. The current threat of civil unrest in the
ghetto is perhaps an even greater menace to our society than the
unrest we have witnessed in the past. To cope with this continuing
undercurrent, a more selective ghetto informant program is necessary.

The primary purpose of our modified ghetto informant pro-
gram is to provide a highly selective corps of "listening post"
informants versed in the type of information desired by the Bureau
which will assure we are abreast of growing civil unrest and
developing extremist activities. This can best be accomplished
by having ghetto informants exclusively handled by those Special
Agents assigned to extremist matters. Inasmuch as ghetto informants
generally work or reside in high crime areas and frequently associ-
ated with the criminal element, we will continue to encourage the
acceptance of criminal information coming to the attention of these
informants.

While we expect a fifty percent decrease in the 7,514
ghetto informants currently being operated, the modified ghetto
informant program in no way diminishes the responsibility of the
Special Agent in Charge (SAC) to have "listening post'' type sources
in those ghetto areas where there is a potential for civil unrest
or extremist activity. In addition, the SAC will be instructed to
carefully analyze each current ghetto informant and those with the
best potential to be retained as ghetto informants or elevated to
probationary extremist informant and others, if appropriate, redesig-
nated as criminal informants or discontinued.

Some SACs have levied an arbitrary rule requiring Special
Agents, regardless of assignment, to develop ghetto informants. We
will give instructions to insure this practice is discontinued. ..

RECOMMENDATION: That attached SAC memorandum, ae accordance
with above, be approved and sent.

Zé,

An informant who is classified as a ghetto informant, as dis-
tinguished from a criminal, security, potential security or extremist
informant, appears to be one who is expected to provide advance
intelligence information relating to civil unrest. In evaluating the
program, it is therefore important to know of each instance since the
program was begun on Ocotber 11, 1967, in which intelligence informa-
tion prior to an urban riot or upheaval was obtained from a ghetto
informant.

‘ Classifying the informant as a ghetto informant Whevernyssmme sence

Memorandum for Mr. Gray
Re: Ghetto Informant Program
Extremist Matters

Although I have not seen the answers to the question referred
to above as to the instances in which ghetto informants have furnished the
type information which was expected of them when the program was
established, my initial opinion is that the ghetto informant program has
not produced any information which could not be obtained by (1) regular
debriefing of criminal, security, potential security, and extremist
informants; (2) liaison with local police departments who, as a part of
the increasing emphasis upon better police-community relations, are
much closer to the pulse of the local ghetto community than may have
been the case heretofore, and who have probably always been closer to
the ghetto than the FBI could ever hope to be; and (3) volunteered
information from interested citizens.

The last paragraph of the Moore to Miller memorandum of
9/8/72 impliedly suggests what I believe to be the major justification
for continuing a separate program under the heading of ghetto informants.
SACs do not levy an arbitrary rule requiring SA's to develop ghetto
informants unless the SACs, rightly or wrongly, believe the Headquarters
expects a certain caseload of ghetto informants from their respective
offiees.

The suspicion that it is the caseload concept which underlies
much of the current discussion about the ghetto informant program in
the aftermath of the recent inspection of DID is increased by the proposed
cutback of fifty percent, which, as previously indicated, appears to be
a somewhat arbitrary figure.

You should know in advance what the consequences would be as
far as the budget is concerned if the ghetto informant program, which
has .undoubtedly accounted for a significant number of cases, were dis-
continued. If those consequences include a drastic cut in funds, you of
course can not be oblivious to them, but, at the risk of sounding naive,
I would hope that the future of this program can be decided solely on the
basis of the program's merit or lack thereof without regard to the case-
load factor. YY

Re Dave Kinley's note about our discussing this matter,
I believe I heard at the SAC Conference on 9/26 that DID was going
to poll the Field to get the views of SAC's and I got the impression
that DID, upon receipt of these comments from the Field, might
wish to revise the proposed SAC Memorandum which was the
subject of the 9/8/72 memorandum from Mr. Moore to you.

To: Mr. Miller” aie iit

Bef As

If there is to be a revised proposal from DID in light of
comments from the Field and the comments of Mr. Gray, it may
be that our discussion would take a substantially different form than
if it occurred now. Therefore, I suggest that the meeting contemplated
by Mr. Kinley not occur until after you have had a chance to poll the
‘ield.and consider the comments of Mr. Gray.

EXTREMIST MATTERS Mrs. Neenan,

During the morning session of the Special Agent in

Charge (SAC) conference held at FBI Headquarters on 9/26/72, e
ghetto informant program became the topic of a lively discussion
with various opinions expressed concerning the most efficient
utilization of this program, It was agreed that further study
of the ghetto informant program is necessary. Accordingly,
attached for approval is an airtel to all offices instructing
each SAC to submit their recommendations concerning the ghetto

informant program. ae RECA oe i ag

The ghetto informant program was instituted on 10/11/67,
to fulfill an urgent need to develop a network of "listening posts"
in the ghetto areas of our cities, Ghetto informants are those
persons living or working in ghetto areas who could furnish
information concerning the potential for riots and violent civil
unrest, As the field gained experience in the handling of these
informants, their value steadily increased. The "listening post"
concept was expanded and ghetto informants are now utilized to
attend public meetings held by extremists, to identify extremists
passing through or bcating in the ghetto area, to identify
purveyors of extremist literature as well as given specific assign-
ments where appropriate, A valuable by-product of the ghetto.
informant program has been théir ability to furnish highly
significant criminal information, In addition, our ghetto informant!
program has been a proven reservoir of productive,extremist
informants who have been elevated from the ghetto informant” ranks.

«Re: Extremist Informant Program - Ghetto

security. During the recent inspection of the Domestic
Intelligence Division, it was concluded that a modified
ghetto informant program would streamline and improve the
efficiency of the existing program, This was to be achieved
by having only Special Agents assigned to extremist matters
handle ghetto informants and instructing the SACs to reduce
their ghetto informant numbers by 50 percent in order to
eliminate the less productive informants, To date this
modified program has not been approved.

As a result of the number of views expressed during
the SAC conference on 9/26/72, concerning the appropriate
utilization of ghetto informants, there is a need to obtain
the opinion of all SACs before considering modifying the
existing program. Accordingly, there is attached an airtel to

informant program and submit their recommendations concerning
the most efficient use of these informants in accordance to their
needs to fulfill their respective responsibilities in the
extremist field. Upon receipt of these views, a thorough review
will be made at FBI Headquarters and appropriate recommendation
that will best serve the needs of all field offices will be

made,

RECOMMENDATION:

The attached airtel be approved and sent in accordance
with the above.

GHETTO INFORMANT PROGRAM
EXTREMIST MATTERS
BUDED 10/9/72

The Bureau is currently considering modifying the ghetto
informant program for the purpose of achieving greater efficiency
and maximum utilization of these informants while carefully preserv-
ing the "listening post" concept of the program,

One proposed change to the ghetto informant program
recommends a reduction in the number of these informants by fifty
percent and the handling of these informants exclusively by Special
Agents assigned to extremist matters, This proposal emphasizes
quality and the closing, where appropriate, or redesignation of
those informants best suited as extremist, criminal or security
informants,

The proposed modification of the ghetto informant program
was discussed during the 9/26/72 session of the Special Agent in
Charge (SAC) conference held at FBI Headquarters, A number of
opinions were expressed as to the value of ghetto informants in
enabling each office to fill its responsibility in the extremist
field. It was agreed that further study of the program is necessary
before initiating any modification of the program,

For your ready reference, our ghetto informant program
follows guidelines set out in Bureau airtel to Albany dated 11/24/71,

Re: Ghetto Informant Program

captioned "Upgrading Extremist Ghetto Informant Program,"
This airtel requires that ghetto informants be the type of
individuals who can obtain information concerning black
extremists who are operating in the ghetto areas and planning
or perpetrating guerrilla-type activities such as robberies,
attacks on police, and other violent activities, Our current
ghetto informant program requires that these informants be
given positive assignments and that they be evaluated on a
yearly basis in order to close the unproductive informant.

To assist the Bureau in determining what changes,
if any, should be made to the existing ghetto informant
program, you are instructed to carefully analyze your ghetto
informant program in line with the following points and sub-
mit your recommendations to reach the Bureau by 10/9/72,
Bear in mind our purpose is to have a uniform program to
best do the job intended:

1) Retain current program without modification.

. 2) Adopt the proposed change set out above calling
for a fifty percent reduction in the number of ghetto
informants. Should you disagree with the fifty percent
reduction, submit your recommendation concerning the
percent of reduction you consider appropriate with an
explanation as to how you arrived at your conclusion,
Bear in mind that quality is difficult without
quantitative measurement,

3) Other changes believed necessary.

4) Abolish the ghetto program in its entirety.

If you recommend the program be abolished, submit
specific alternate program you recommend to obtain
the intelligence information now being developed by
ghetto informants.

The purpose of the memorandum is to secure

concerning the ghetto informant program.

A survey of all field offices relative to the

The field overwhelmingly expressed a desire to

offered to modify certain aspects of it.

Based upon a review of the results of this survey Cit
the following recommendations are made: Ye
1)

The number of informants operated under this

an analysis to determine its. needs and only those informants
absolutely necessary to fulfill the needs of the office are

oi Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller
Re: Ghetto Informant Program

: It has been said that there has not been a single
instance where a ghetto informant has furnished significant
information pertaining to civil unrest. This is a mis-
conception because, in fact, since the inception of this
program there have been numerous times that these informants
have furnished significant information concerning civil
unrest, Examples of a few of these are as follows:

A Memphis ghetto informant identified four Negro
males who had assaulted and stabbed a high school teacher
which lead to their arrest and resulted in the quieting
of a potentially riotous situation, A Minneapolis ghetto
informant identified participants involved in a disturbance
at the University of Minnesota. A Jackson ghetto informant

. provided pertinent information concerning a disturbance at
« Jackson State College and identified four individuals
y setting fires on the campus. This informant also identified
individuals leading a mob of 100 persons attacking the
y Reserve Officer Training Corps Building on that campus,
$

Ghetto informants of the Knoxville Office furnished informa-
tion on black extremists extorting money from white merchants
with the threat of fire bombing their stores if they failed
to cooperate. A Norfolk ghetto informant furnished informa-
tion that a gathering of 200 young blacks had 40 fire bombs
which they intended to use. Local authorities credited this
information with avoiding a massive civil disturbance, A
Springfield ghetto informant identified an individual attempt-
ing to sell a large quantity of explosives for use in creating
a civil disturbance, A Tampa ghetto informant identified five
Negroes responsible for provoking trouble at a local school.

In addition, ghetto informants have furnished a
large amount of valuable criminal information which is perhaps
best highlighted by a recent case wherein a ghetto informant
of the Oklahoma City Office furnished the information which
lead to the identification and apprehension of four subjects
in a terrorist-type slaying of a man, his wife, and a young
son,

ADDENDUM OF THE INSPECTION DIVISION L.M,WALTERS:wmj 10/24

i Ghetto Informant Program instituted 10/11/67 to fulfill a need
then recognized to develop a comprehensive network of "listening posts"
in the ghetto areas of urban centers throughout the country, Over the
succeeding years number of such informants has gradually built to some
‘1500 existing today. Field inspections in past year have pointed to diffia It
of evaluating justification for such informants because, unlike the other
informant programs (criminal, security, extremist, revolutionary
activities, and top echelon) the justification for an individual informant
cannot be supported by what he is producing, It is sufficient that ghetto
informants are geographically well dispersed and promise cooperation,
The practice of opening such cases varies widely and can be used by a
field office to effect sharp changes in total case load upward or downward,
The number of ghetto informant cases substantially affects manpower
utilization in that each ghetto informant opened requires a background
investigation and thereafter 30-day contacts,

Accordingly, during inspection (8/18 ~ 9/1/72) of Domestic
Intelligence Division (DID) the merits of the overall program were
thoroughly reviewed and discussed, As a result, DID proposed in inspectim
that hereafter assignment of such informants be limited to those Agents
asgigned to extremist squads or extremist work and that SACs be instructed
to cease levying a requirement that all Agents, regardless of assignment,
must develop and operate ghetto informants, DID estimated that such a
ae in the program would probably reduce the total number of such cases
| by 50%,

The proposed letter to the field accomplishes little meaningful
change, It changes the name of the program; it provides latitude to SACs
to determine extent of program within guideline that the number of
informants operated must be deemed necessary to fulfill the needs of the
office (this has always been so); it also provides latitude to SACs as to
whether all Agents in the office participate or only those Agents assigned to
extremist matters. Implementation of changes proposed herein would
result in an extraordinary lack of uniformity throughout the field,

The point really called into question here is whether concrete
steps should be taken to effect an overall case load reduction by sharply
reducing marginally productive cases in order to divert Agent manpower
to more productive uses in major program areas. The broader question
is currently under consideration and the results of that consideration should

NW 68262 _Docld:32989649_Page-835-———_


8 @

more clearly dictate the proper approach to the Ghetto Informant
Program, Accordingly, it is recommended that any change in this
program be deferred until the overall question of case load vs,
manpower utilization is resolved, /

IST MATTERS" » Fstiee. Noonan —
Re memo of G, C. Moore to Mr. E. S. Miller of 10/18/72
on this subject.

The first paragraph of the Addendum of the Inspection Division
sets forth some of the considerations which have caused my skepticism
as to whether the benefits gained from this Program are sufficient to
justify the costs in terms of resource utilization attendant to the Ghetto
Informant Program.

With reference to the recommendation of the Inspection Division
that no action be taken until the overall question of caseload versus man-
power utilization is resolved, I am not certain as to the precise inquiry
currently in progress which is being referred to by the Inspection Division.
If there is such an inquiry with a view towards instructing. the Domestic
Intelligence Division not to let fears as to the consequences of a reduction
in the quantity of its total caseload interfere with devoting concentrated
attention towards the most important matters within its jurisdiction, I 4
would be the first to applaud this inquiry. we

In this regard, the problem I see with the proposed letter of
the Domestic Intelligence Division is that by giving wide latitude to SACs
to administer the Ghetto Informant Program within their respective offices,
the memorandum is not likely to accomplish meaningful change as long as
So much turns within the Bureau on the total caseload of an office. Even
though an SAC in Field Division X believes that he could terminate his
Ghetto Informant Program altogether and, by doing so, increase the
effective utilization of his personnel, he will hesitate to make such a
decision because he knows it could well result in a substantial reduction
in his total caseload, which in turn would mean that his office would lose
Agents and/or supervisors or would not be able to obtain additional oenta) /

Memorandum to Mr. Gray
Re: Ghetto Informant Program
Extremist Matters

This is why it seems so vitally important to achieve the
by no means easy goal of finding some way to measure the needs of an
office without resort to dependence upon the total caseload of the office
because the present reliance upon caseload figure restricts the SACs
ability to make decisions, otherwise called for, which would reduce
his total caseload.

The Domestic Intelligence Division furnished to me copies of
the responses received from the Field Divisions in connection with the
Field survey concerning the Ghetto Informant Program. The information
submitted by the Newark Division so closely approximates my opinion
concerning the Ghetto Informant Program that I am attaching a copy of
the Newark airtel to this memorandum.

GHETTO INFORMANT PROGRAM AtH-
EXTREAIST MATTERS
BUDED: 10/9/72

Re Bureau airtel to SAC, ALBANY, 9/28/72.

The Newark Office is in complete agreement that
modification of the ghetto informant program is necessary in
order to insure greater efficiency and maximum utilization of
these informants.

A review of peetes informant files in the Newark
Division following the guidelines set out in Bureau airtel
dated 11/24/71 captioned "UPGRADING EXTREMIST GHETTO INFORMANT
PROGRAM" has revealed the following:

7 fy Ghetto informants are divided into two general
groups, : E

The first group are those serving as “listening
posts", These informants are generally individuals who own
or are employed in such businesses as gas stations, candy
stores, barber shops, etc. and are usually in no way directly
connected with extremist or criminal matters, These individua
.are contacted on a regular basis and routinely report that
“all is quiet in the neighborhood". The value of such
informants is highly questionable. © (>  ——___——____

occee Civil disturbances are either planned or spontaneous,
f In the first case, such planning is done by various militant
groups. It is the responsibility of 211 field offices to

have developed informants of such character in these groups
that they are in a position to furnish advance information

' about such plans. "Listening post" informants are not in &
position to furnish information about preplanned disturbances
and they certainly cannot furnish prior information relative to
@ Spontaneous disturbance. Once a disturbance or riot has
started, it is virtually impossible to contact these individualg
inasmuch as most commercial enterprises are closed down and
entry into these areas is not feasible and.the ability of these
informants to report by telephone is very doubtful.

Targeting of such informants towards obtaining
information concerning black extremists, robberies, attacks on
police and. other violent activities, as well as recent targeting!
towards obtaining narcotics information has been extremely Limit.
in its value. In view of this, it is felt that the value of
the "listening post" is limited and they should be eliminated.
‘The manner in which this action should be taken is set out jlater
in this communication,

The second group consists of those individuals opened
as ghetto informants who are considered to have definite value
in the extremist field and who are targeted to furnish specific
information relative to extremist organizations and individuals.
These informants are actually under development towards becoming
extremist informants. They are generally individuals who are
: “presently members of extremist organizations or are in some way
\ : affiliated with these organizations through contact with members.
i These ghetto informants are of great value for the continued
| development of new informants in the extremist field. In the

eee Rewark Division it is this group of ghetto informants who have

. “robberies and locsi criminal matters. They are all targeted

\ towards: furnishing information relative to narcotica activity.

field, These ghetto informants are of definite value and in
: the Newark Division are 211 assigned to Agents or

extremist investigations. :

The Newark Division disagrees with arbitrarily {
. GLosing fifty percent of all ghetto informants. ‘The following

is Kewark‘'s recommendation as to how each ghetto informant ue
should be evaluated: : as :

NE 17006

The Extremist Informant Coordinator or Supervisor,
as the case applies, routinely reviews all files under the
tickler system. As a file comes up on tickler for review, ;
it should be evaluated. If i¢ appears to be a "listening post
with no vaiue as s future extremist informant, this should be
brought to the attention of the case Agent. This Agent should
then within one month make a recommendation to either close this:
informant or convert him to a criminal or security informant z
for development in a specific area. All ghetto informants
cousidered to be of no other value than as “listening posts"
should be closed, . ;

In the Newark Office ghetto informants are assigned
to the extremist squad or security squads, the applicant and a
accounting squads, Those assigned to other than the extremtet “:
squad are generally “listening posts" in character. Upon .
review, as set forth above, if it is determined the informant is
of value in the extremist field he should be reassigned to an
. Agent working extremist matters. Xf of value in anotker field
of investigation, he should be appropriately reassigned.

. It is felt that if the above is adopted, a great deal
of Agent time and clerical time would be saved and could be
diverted to more productive and efficient usage, particularly
by the Agents conducting investigations in the extremist, security
and criminal fields. Further, concentration on the remainder :
ef the informants would logically result in their becoming more

_ productive and efficient, : a :

a7 MATTERS

In connection with various memoranda concerning captioned
matter, Mr. Gray inquired "Why not handle this program in same manner
as our other programs involving informants? G III 11/9 2:34 PY

The question asked is similar to the questions raised at
the time the captioned program was inaugurated in October, 1967.
Faced with the need for a rapid development of a particular type of
informant, the decision was made to to implem th
minimum amount of Headquarters! supervisio: cordingly,
Was granted for the Special Agents in Charge (SAC) to approve the
operation of an individual as a ghetto informant. mire

oe kad

There is set forth data showing that the Ghetto Informant
Program is in line with other Bureau informant programs in that there
are specific guidelines for the operation of the informants, as well
as requirements for the justification of the informants and i
requirements for contacts with these informants along with the (fr

regulations concerning payments to informants.
There are also set forth observations corto
comments made by Mr. Armstrong in his memorandum of November 2, “197

and the comments made by the Inspection Division in its addendum
of 10/24/72.

af
Gis

In 1967 the United States experienced violent racial
disturbances in many cities and it was indicated that there was a
need for cooperative individuals (sources) in those areas
experiencing the above disturbances. Such questions as "Are these
disturbances spontaneous or are they planned?" "Are these dis-
turbances caused by organizations or individuals? If so, identify
them!’ were being asked not only by FBI Headquarters officials, pyft’y

Memorandum to Mr. .g S. Miller @
RE: GHETTO INFORMA? PROGRAM

Analysis of the then existing Security, Criminal and Extremist
Informant Programs determined that none of these existing programs could
supply the answers to the questions being asked...

The above analysis further showed that due to the orientation
of the various informant programs mentioned above, that is, criminal
informants to obtain criminal information, security informants for
security information, and extremist informants for specific information
concerning extremist organizations and known extremist individuals,
there was still a vast area where racial unrest was rampant, namely, the
ghetto areas where there was a need for a "Listening post! type
informant. Accordingly, the Ghetto Informant Program was, instituted.

Comparison of Ghetto Informant Operations With Other Bureau Informant
Operations

The Security Informant Program as well as the Extremist
Informant Program require tight supervision at both Headquarters and
field level because of the extreme sensitivity of these operations. As
previously stated, there was a need for development and rapid operation
of sources in the ghetto areas which were to be utilized as "listening
posts.'' In view of the nature of this operation, it was decided that the
tight supervision required by the other informant programs was not
necessary) however, it was also recognized that for any program to be
fruitful and administratively sound, there must: be guidelines set out..

The guidelines formulated were based on our experiences with
the Security and Extremist Informant Programs and required that some
background checks be conducted prior to: the approval of an individual as
an informant; a contact be made with the individual designated as an
informant at least once every 30 days; that any payments made to a ghetto
informant must be in accordance with Bureau policy which is also the
requirement for other informant programs. .

In synopsis, it can be said that the Ghetto Informant Program
is similar to other informant programs (security and extremist) in that
there are definite guidelines set for the designation and operation of
an individual as a ghetto informant, as well as the fact payment to these
informants must conform to Bureau regulations. In short, the Ghetto
Informant Program, although operated basically as other informant
programs, does serve a separate and distinct need which our experience
has shown the other Bureau informant programs did not and could not
fill.

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller
RE: GHETTO INFORMANT PROGRAM

Comparison of the Justification of Ghetto Informants With
Justification of Other Existing Informant Programs

In the Inspection Division's addendum dated 10/24/72 to
the memorandum from G. C. Moore to E. S. Miller dated 10/18/72
concerning captioned matter, it was set out "Field inspections
in past year have pointed to difficulty of evaluating
justification for such informants (this refers to ghetto
informants) because, unlike the other informant programs
(criminal, security, extremist, revolutionary activities, and

top echelon) the justification for an individual informant
cannot be supported by what he is producing."

The Inspection Division's difficulties have not previousl
been brought to the attention of the Domestic Intelligence
Division (DID), however, this Division does not agree with the
above set out difficulty.

The statistical accomplishments of the ghetto informants
havé been-set out numerous times, therefore, this in itself would
sassist in making a justification for ghetto informants; but,
it is more important that the ghetto informants be justified
by obaining information concerning potential civil unrest.
This must be considered in light of present circumstances.
While we are not experiencing the burning of the cities that

‘ we did in the late 1960s, we are still living in a state of

fe? sop gnstional fears concerning the polarization of the races.

| oat Therefore, based on our experiences, we recognized

| get that in reporting on the pulse of a particular area in regard

\ to the potential for civil unrest it is very important to
know that there is no indication of civil unrest in a particular -
area at a particular time, as well as knowing that there are
indications of civil unrest. Accordingly, the report that there
is no indication of civil unrest in a particular area is
considered positive information and should be counted as such.
In accordance with these guidelines, there does not appear to
be any difficulty in justifying the continuance of a ghetto

instructions and reporting concerning the tempo of feelings

In addition to the above, there will be set forth
observations concerning the comments made in the memorandum
of Mr. Armstrong dated November 2, 1972, as well as the
addendum of the Inspection Division dated 10/24/72.

Addendum of Inspection Division dated 10/24/72

Paragraph one of the above addendum in addition to the
comment concerning the difficulty of evaluating justification
for the Ghetto Informant Program which was answered above
makes reference to the practice of opening ghetto cases and
states these cases can be used by a field office to effect
sharp changes in total case load upward or downward. This
is merely an administrative matter and should not be considered
in connection with the concept of whether or not there should be

a Ghetto Informant Program. The value of this _Deceren has been

The above-mentioned addendum sets out that DID's
proposed letter to the field dated 10/20/72 accomplishes little
meaningful change in the Ghetto Informant Program. This is
exactly what the DID intended. DID's letter to the field was
based on the observations of the SACs and was a consensus of
their studied critique of the program and their respective
recommendations. As a result of discussion with SACs and

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller
RE: GHETTO INFORMANT PROGRAM

Mr. Gray concerning the Ghetto Informant Program on 9/26/72,
all SACs were instructed to submit their comments and
recommendations concerning this program. If we are not going
to take the recommendations of the SACs, who are our leaders
in the field, then why did we bother to request their opinions?
Likewise, they certainly are entitled to know the results of
the survey and this is what we are attempting to do.

In connection with the recommendation made that any
change in this program be deferred until the overall question
of case load versus manpower utilization is resolved, there
apparently is no indication as to when this will be resolved
and further, this question should not be the deciding factor
as to whether or not there should be a Ghetto Informant Program.

Memorandum of Mr. Daniel M. Armstrong, III dated November 2, 1972

Mr. Armstrong stated that in connection with the
inquiry concerning the overall question of case load versus
manpower that if there is such an inquiry with a view toward
instructing DID not to let fears as to the consequences of a
reduction in the quantity of its total case lodd interfere
with devoting concentrated attention towards the most important
matters within its jurisdiction, he would be the first to
applaud this inquiry.

In respect to this, DID is not aware of any fears in
connection with the above case load work load inquiry and,
further, we will always go full steam ahead to obtain the
‘maximum quality intelligence data needed to fulfill our
responsibilities to the United States Government, regardless
of any alleged "fears." i

Mr. Armstrong stated that the problem he sees with
DID's proposed letter of 10/20/72 is that "by giving wide
latitude to SACs to administer the Ghetto Informant Program
within their respective offices, the memorandum is not likely
to accomplish meaningful change as long as so much turns
within the Bureau on the total caseload of an office."

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller
RE: GHETTO INFORMANT PROGRAM

Again it is pointed out that the DID memorandum was intended
to give latitude to the SACs in the operation of the Ghetto
Informant Program because this basically is the recommendation
of the greater majority of SACs.

a Mr. Armstrong cited the opinion submitted by the
Newark Division becausé It so close imated his own
Qpinion, It is to be noted that the SAC Newark was one 0

four SACs who recommended against maintaining the program in
its same form, whereas 53 SACs recommended modifications in
accordance with those set out in DID letter 10/20/72.

It is respectfully submitted that the recommendations of
53 SACs carry more weight than one SAC and that these 53 SACs
recommended that the Program be continued. The greater
majority of these individuals recommended that the Program
be. continued along with the modifications set out in DID
letter dated 10/20/72.

OBSERVATIONS:

The Ghetto Informant Program since 1967, when it was
instituted, has been analysed and critiqued not only by FBI
Headquarters personnel, SACs, but also by Field Supervisors and
Field Informant Coordinators through a series of correspondence,
as well as specialized conferences. The overriding opinion
of the majority of individuals involved in the above has
been that this program has in the past and still is an

’ effective productive program. The program serves a vital

need, that is, the need to know the potential for acts of
civil disturbances that could not only disrupt the operations
in local communities, but could also cause disruption on a
nationwide basis.

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller
RE: GHETTO INFORMANT PROGRAM

As previously stated, the country is not experiencing
the burning of the cities and the major riots as we had in the
late 1960s, however, there are movements in this country that
are more dangerous than the riots of the late 1960s. We are
familiar with the rhetoric of known extremists such as
Stokely Carmichael, Eldridge Cleaver, LeRoi Jones, and
unfortunately this rhetoric is the fact of life in our country
today. These extremists preached the theory of "kill the
pig," and we are seeing today not only known extremists
actively waging guerrilla warfare against the establishment
(the pigs) but we are also seeing individuals not affiliated
with extremist organizations taking this same action.

Messrs. Carl T. Rowan and David M. Mazie in an article
in the November, 1972, "Reader's Digest" captioned "The Growth
of Black Separatism--A National Tragedy" very accurately

portrayed the problem facing FBI intelligence gathering y)
capabilities. Azar + Thcanus wo: Tha volun 9 the Chelle Lufermenit

The above article sets out the hostility of racial

factions in the military which has caused military leaders to
declare it a threat to our national security. It further
points out the tensions and violence that exist in our high
schools and states that traditional white racism has collided
with a virulent new black nationalism to drive the races as far
apart as they have been in half a century, with an increasingly
destructive impact on the stability of our society.

As can be seen from the above, there is still a need
ito measure the potential for violence in our urban areas, as
{fwell as the need to identify any individuals in these areas
ho may be fomenting violence because of racial hatred.

The Ghetto Informant Program has proven in the past
to be the only vehicle where the above type information can

be obtained on a regular basis. Accordingly, it is believed
‘that the attached letter to all field offices setting forth

ADDENDUM OF THE INSPECTION DIVISION J.H.TRIMBACH:wmj 1/24/72

The attached series of documents arose from DID inspection review of
Ghetto Informant Program, 8/18 - 9/1/72. Inspection Division adheres to its
position expressed in addendum to 10/18/72 memorandum attached and still feels
that the proposed letter to the field contains no meaningful change in the
operation of the Ghetto Informant Program.

Under the heading, "Need for the Ghetto Informant Program," in foregoing
memorandum (page 1, last paragraph), DID mentions questions such as "Are
these (racial) disturbances spontaneous or are they planned?”, and "Are these
disturbances caused by organizations or individuals?", as questions asked by
high Government officials after the racial disturbances of 1967, Inspection Division
feels that advance information responsive to such intelligence needs must be
obtained from productive, well-placed Security, Revolutionary Activities, and
Extremist Informants, or as by~product information from Criminal Informants
and other sources from whom we have reasonable expectation of positive
information reporting based on past experience, Our current concept of
a Ghetto Informant includes the proprietor of a candy store or barber shop in
a ghetto (under new proposal in an urban area) who may or may not have
Such information, One such proprietor could have significant information about
an impending racial disturbance and another may not, Can we assume that our
Ghetto Informant is the local proprietor with the answer because we have
selected him in the neighborhood as a listed Ghetto Informant?

Inspection Division feels that the Ghetto Informant Program as viewed by the
DID is different from all other informant programs in at least one highly
important respect. On page 3 of the memorandum, it is stated that the report
(from a Ghetto Informant) that there is no indication of civil unrest in a particular
area is considered "positive" information and should be counted as such, Negative
information is not counted as positive information in any other informant program
and in other programs we obtain some history of the furnishing of productive in-
formation before forming a conclusion that the individual is worthy of continued
contact or further development. If we accept the views of the DID, then every
Ghetto Informant opened by an office and established for monthly contact is
capable of furnishing "positive" information because everyone is capable of
Saying they do not have information indicating civil unrest,

Some Ghetto Informants have in the past furnished information in extremist
or criminal matters, This has been recognized as a by-product of the Ghetto
Informant Program, A more meaningful approach to this whole problem might be
to concentrate more heavily in ghetto areas to develop proven Security, Extremist,
Revolutionary Activities, and Criminal Informants upon whom we can then rely to
keep us advised of civil disturbance plans as a steady by-product to the information

NW 68262 Docld:32989649 Page 850_.-


they are regularly furnishing on domestic intelligence or criminal matters,
Existing Ghetto Informants who have shown productivity in any area of FBI
jurisdiction should be converted to the appropriate substantive informant
program to which their services relate. Further, all informants designated

in the other informant programs who are strategically located in areas of
potential civil mrest, should be briefed on supplying information that may

come to their attention relating to develqing tensions and civil unrest, Such
approach would, in our view, represent a better ordering of priorities and not
have the "cart before the horse," Moreover, we have some concern of
justifiable apprehension that might be expressed by the Congress or the public

if this program were to be described in terms out of context with our real intentions,
We could fully defend informants providing us regularly with information directly
related to our jurisdictional responsibilities and using them for "by-product"
information on civil urest. It would be much more difficult to defend
establishment of ghetto or urban listening posts all over the country with a
possible by-product of information directly within our jurisdiction,

In our view, the Ghetto Informant Program is not a proven program and in
view of the manpower expended on it, the decision as to whether we should

keep it, modify it, or abolish it should be made after a decision is reached’

Re memorandum from Mr. G. C. Moore to Mr. E. S. Miller,
dated November 20, 1972, on this subject and the addendum of the Inspection
Division thereto, dated November 24, 1972.

As noted in the addendum of the Inspection Division, tnelt Urban_
Informant Program the’ Ghetto Informant Program.
di iffers from. all othe: mal in that” negative | information, is,
under this program, counted as s positive information.

It would appear from Section 130 (H) (2) (b) (4) of the Manual of
Instructions that an urban informant who does nothing more than advise our
inquiring Agents that there is no indication of civil unrest in his particular
area could qualify for payments on a regular basis under Bureau authority.

* In this regard, I believe it would be useful to know (1) how
many of the Bureau's present urban informants are being paid on a regular
basis, (2) of that number, how many have furnished only information to the
effect that there is no indication of civil unrest in their areas and (8) of
those urban informants not paid on a regular basis, are there documented
cases in which those informants have been paid for saying that there is no
indication of civil unrest in their areas?

| The answer to Question (1) would appear to be readily available.
The answers to the other questions, especial Supgpion (2), might be

difficult to obtain. i (An fed

If you deem it appropriate, I would be pleased to have you obtain
the answers to one or more of the above questions, or I would make the
effort myself. I would understand completely if you conclude thatthe” ~~"

, In any event, I do recommend that the referenced memorandum
and the addendum be shown to Mr. Gray. Although no action proposals are
now pending and Mr. Felt and Mr. Gray may have discussed this by phone
during Mr. Gray's hospitalization, I think Mr. Gray for his own information
should have a chance to read for himself the arguments pro and con
concerning this controversial program.

Re: /fRBAN nitoninaner PROGRAM

One of the memoranda on this subject which was
included in the package which Mr. Deegan sent me at your
request was a memorandum of 12/5/72 from me to Mr. Kinley
upon which Mr. Gray had written - 'Prepare a memo for my
Signature requesting the info. GIIIT 12-11 9:09A." The
information to which Mr. Gray was referring would be the
answers to three questions set forth in the body of the
memorandum.

In view of the fact that you are already in possession
of the memorandum containing the three questions and Mr.
Gray's instructions with reference thereto, I have suggested
to Mr. Kinley that the preparation of a memorandum for
Mr. Gray's signature would now be, under the circumstances i H
af this case, unnecessary. Mr. Kinley suggested that the a

answers to those three questions could be compiled and made
available fo Mr. Gray in conjunction.with the oveFall project of -
developing an Urban Informant Program which he also requested”
in his notation of 12-11-72 at IT AM. rn

Therefore, I will not prepare 2a memorandum formally
requesting the answers to the three questions, and will assume
that the information will be furnished in. connection with the project
we are now working on. Please advise if this buggested approach

presents any problems. : a

To obtain approval to send a letter to all con-
tinental offices concerning the need for additional ghetto
informant coverage.

PURPOSE:

* BACKGROUND:

Following the murder of Martin Luther King, Jr.,
Bureau Agents conducted numerous interviews in ghetto
areas of U. S. cities as a result of racial disorders.
Productive contacts made with individuals diring these inter- Le
views are avaluable source of untapped informant potential)
By, following up these interviews by recontacting cooperative
residents of the ghetto areas, the Bureau can obtain a
higher quality and larger number of ghetto informants.
Receiving offices are instructed to exploit this situation
by developing, through contacts made during riots, additional
probationary racial informants (ghetto).

OBSERVATIONS :

It is imperative that the Bureau utilize every
available investigative technique to obtain advance

} In the wake of the racial upheavals following the
; murder of Martin Luther King, Jr., numerous U. S. cities
\ ! experienced racial violence in various degreas.

\ In keeping the Bureau and interested agencies
fully advised of the rapidly developing events in these
cities, Bureau Agents interviewed a great number of
individuals who were in positions to report on the under~
currents prevalent in the ghetto areas of these cities.

Undoubtedly these interviews opened up a whole
new avenue of informant development, on a block-to-block :
basis, in the crucial areas of the ghettos of American
cities, ay
*

Those offices covering cities which recently
experienced racial strife are expected to take immediate
steps to exploit this situation and increase the quality
and quantity of ghetto informant coverage.

Those individuals in the ghetto areas ans furnished
valuable information to the Bureau in these crises
fe should be reinterviewed and consideration given to developing

them as probationary racial informants spheres 5 Us a i) ai - Jp f

SUBJECT: EXTREMIST INFORMANT PROGRAM a Fopegattet
Ms. Herwig
aa i
‘ Mrs. Neenan
In accordance with Mr. Gray's instructions,
Messrs. Armstrong, Walters and, Miller met on 2/20/73 at

which time they formulate evised Extremist Informant
_Program designed to be beneficial to the Bureau's
operation both in the field and at FBIHQ.

The new revised Extremist Informant Program
eliminates urban (ghetto) informants and is limited to
potential extremist informants (PEI), extremist informants
(EI), and confidential sources-extremist (CS-E).

Definitions and qualifications for these new
informant categories are as follows:

Potential Extremist Informant:

A PEI is an individual who is in a position to
furnish information concerning extremist activities of
individuals and organizations as well as information of an
extremist nature in those geographical areas where there is
a potential for violence.

The personal authority of the SAC is necessary to
designate and operate an individual as a PEI with exceptions
as noted below, These informants are to be operated for a
period of not more than one year and not less than six months
providing their potential is such that it appears he will qualify
for elevation to EI. The,PEI must be discontinued immediately
following a determirlation that he has no future potential as an
EI and those PEIs not elevated at the end of one year must be

Memorandum to Mr. W. M. Felt
Re: Extremist Informant Program

The following are exceptions to the SAG's authority
for granting the approval of the operation of a PEI. If any
of the following conditions exist, the SAC must submit his
recommendation to FBIHQ on a UACB basis:

1. Any individual in a sensitive position (i.e. news
media, educational field or any other field where disclosure
as an informant would cause concern to the Bureau).

2. Any individual being placed in an extremist
organization or any individual presently in an extremist
organization.

3. Any individual who has been charged with a
felony violation in the past five years.

4. Any individual who is presently under indictment
or is on probation or parole, Federal or local.

5. Any individual with an unsavory background yet
who,is in a position to furnish uniquely valuable information
not available from other sources.

The Special Agent in Charge has authority to
authorize payments’ to PEIs in the amount of up to $400.
Additional payment authority must be obtained from FBIHQ.

Bureau authority is necessary to elevate a PEI to
an EI. Field recommendation must contain full justification.
If PEI does not qualify for EI within one year, he must be
discontinued.

Extremist Informant:
An EI is an individual who has been operated as a
PEI for at least six months (in order that his reliability can

be properly evaluated) and is furnishing extremist information
on a regular basis whether it be concerning an extremist

-2- CONTINUED - OVER



ene e

Rex Extremist Informant Program

organization or an unaffiliated extremist. In order to elevate
a PEI to an EI, he must have produced authentic data on
extremist activities and be in a position to continue furnishing
extremist intelligence information.

Confidential Sources-Extremist:

A CS- E: is an individual who is willing to cooperate
with the Bureau by furnishing extremist information brought
to his attention by virtue of his position in the community,
by his employment, or in view of his background in extremist
activities. This individual, whose identity must be protected,
will not be actively seeking information on behalf of the
Bureau.

OBSERVATIONS:

We contemplate no changes’in the existing extremist
requirements as they pertain to background investigation,
payments, or other administrative policy.

Our present urban informants will be evaluated to
determine if they should be considered in the future as EIs,
PEIs, CS-E, directed to the Security or Criminal Informant
Programs, or discontinued altogether.

No individual will be operated as an EI or PEI solely
because he is in a "listening post" position. To insure we
have informant coverage in those areas where there is a potential
for violence, instructions will be issued to each SAC to insure
all Special Agent personnel are aware of the need for developing
information where there is a potential for violence and that
those Special Agents not directly involved with extremist
matters refer those individuals who may possess information of
potential violence to the Extremist Supervisor in order that
their informant potential may be assessed.

Memorandum to Mr. W. M. Felt
Re: Extremist Informant Program

The field will be instructed that CS-Es are not
to be kept in a pending status unless these sources are
furnishing information on a regular basis. Sources reporting
infrequently may be operated from a pending file with a
provision for closing after a fixed period of inactivity,
out of a dead file or out of a control file. Each SAC should
determine which method of operation is best suited for his
individual needs. SACs may desire to establish an informant
map which will clearly depict coverage in any geographical area
within their division.

Those informants currently carried as probationary
extremist informants should either be designated as PEIs
or elevated to EIs.

If the above revisions to the Extremist Informant
Program are approved, appropriate Manual changes will be made.

ADDENDUM ee af 4/6/73

Mr. Gray in his instructions of 12/11/72, which led to the
aforementioned meeting of 2/20/73, said he was not persuaded that the
"listening post" concept continued to have merit. "It is," he said, "a
luxury that we cannot afford at the present." In view of the fact that the
"listening post" concept has up to now been a central feature of the Urban
(Ghetto) Informant Program, Mr. Gray's comments clearly contemplate
a major change in this program.

In order to insure effective implementation of the new policy,
it is therefore important that SAC's clearly understand that a major change
is intended, Unless the new policy is spelled out in unmistakably clear
terms, SAC's may understandably interpret the new policy as not repre-
senting a major change from the past. The motivation for this kind of
interpretation is great because such an interpretation would be most
consistent with the maintenance of a high case load of urban (ghetto)
informants, and SAC's continue, I fear, to operate on the assumption
(erroneous I hope) that any significant decrease in their case loads,
regardless of the circumstances leading to the decrease, will automatically
mean a reduction in the number of Agents assigned to their Divisions, etc.

It is with the above in mind that I venture the following comments

on the proposed description of the revised Extremist Informant Program.
.

1. The revised policy statement should include language that
the revised Extremist Informant Program is designed to reduce substantially
the number of non-productive informants in the Urban (Ghetto) Informant
Program who have not provided positive specific intelligence concerning
extremist, security or criminal activities, The SAC's should be told that
careful and close attention must be given to insure that each informant
operating in the revised Extremist Informant Program is both in a position
to furnish and willing to furnish information of positive value to the Bureau
in the extremist area, :

2. I would define a PEI simply as an individual who is in a position
to furnish information concerning extremist activities of individuals and/or
organizations. If we are covering both known individuals and organizations
with a potential for violence, "geographical areas where there is a potential
for violence" should automatically be covered. An additional reference to
"geographical areas...," is therefore unnecessary and could be confusing

NW 68262 Docld:32989649 Page 865



NW 68262 Docld:32989649 Page 866

ADDENDUM (Continued...)

to SAC's since they are told elsewhere that mere “listening posts" are no
longer to be operated,

3. Ifa PEI is defined as suggested in #2, it is not clear who else
would be left in the great majority of situations for an SAC to approve as a
PEI except an individual who is being placed in an extremist organization or
an individual who is presently in an extremist organization. Therefore,
requiring an SAC to submit a recommendation to FBI HQ before an individual
is approved as a PEI when the individual in question is being placed in an
extremist organization or is presently in an extremist organization, which
submission is required by condition #2 on page 2 of this memorandum, could
be tantamount to requiring notification to Headquarters in practically every
case, This should not be necessary because the SAC seems to be in the best
position in the great majority of cases to make a final decision as to whether
a person should be operated as a PEI.

4, With further reference to those situations on page 2 of this
memorandum describing when the SAC must submit his recommendation of
a PEI to FBI HQ, there would appear to be very few candidates for a PEI
who have not been at least charged with felony violations. Therefore, the
fact that an individual has been charged with a felony violation in the past
five years seems of no great significance to the question whether that person
should be operated as a PEI, and the SAC should not be required to notify
FBI HQ when this situation arises. Thus, I would delete condition #3. With
Specific reference to condition #5, as presently worded, this condition seems
too broad and/or ambiguous. . Practically speaking, couldn't anyone likely
to qualify as a PEI quite conceivably be described as a person with "an
unsavory background?" If so, this condition could have the effect of requiring
advance notification to FBI HQ in practically every situation, a result which,
" as indicated above, Ido not favor. Finally, if FBI HQ is to be notified, as is
proposed by condition #1, when the individual is in a sensitive position, I
think the SAC should be given more specific guidance as towhat is considered
to be a sensitive position. The phrase "any other field where disclosure as an
informant would cause concern to the Bureau" is too vague.

Armstrong III dated April 6, 1973, attached to Mr. G. C. Moore
to Mr. E. S, Miller memorandum dated March 6, 1973, captioned
"Extremist Informant Program." )

Set forth below are comments concerning Mr. Armstrong's
observations:

i. Mr. Armstrong suggests the revised policy
should include language that th x evised Extremist Informant
Program is devised to reduce substantially the number of
Honproductive informants in the Urban (Ghetto) Informant ayaa
Program. We believe this is clearly stated in our memorandyin 47
to all SACs on page four, paragraph one "Under the revised + vo
program no individual is to be operated as an EI or PEI a
solely because he is in a 'listening post' position.” /

2. Mr. Armstrong proposed that he would define Va
a potential extremist informant (PEI) simply as an individual
who is in a position to furnish information concerning
extremist activities of individuals and/or organizations.
Therefore, since we are covering both known individuals and
organizations with a potential for violence, there is no need
for a reference to "geographical areas where there is a poten-
tial for violence." The key to the weakness in Mr. Armstrong's
definition is the statement "covering both known individuals
and organizations with a potential for violence." There are
many areas in the United States where known organizations and
known extremists do not operate. Nevertheless, there is a
potential for violence in these areas because of socio-economic
conditions that breed frustrations thereby making the individuals
imvglved in these areas potential sparkplugs for extremist
giftators. Consequently, our definition of a PEI must be broad
ngugh to enable informants to actively seek o

Memorandum to Mr. E, S, Miller
Re: Extremist Informant Program

3. The observation that SACs havea better insight
in the great majority of cases to make a final decision as to
whether a person should be operated as a PEI in connection
with the placing of an individual in an extremist organization
is not accurate in each and every case. It is pointed out
that extremist activity is nationwide and individual FBI field
office files do not necessarily contain full information and
background concerning these organizations and the individuals
involved in these activities. Experience has shown that
Headquarters, after considering the SAC's recommendation,
is in a better position to determine an individual's suit-
ability for operation as a PEI. One of our greatest continuing
concerns is penetration of our informant ranks by extremist
"plants" as well as Agent provocateurs. Headquarters' review
of individual cases, although not necessarily one hundred
percent fullproof, is an additional necessary check. This
in no way mitigates the SAC's responsibility as his approval
and recommendation is necessary in the first instance.

4, With regard to the comment there would appear
to be very few candidates for PEI who have not been at least
charged with felony violations, it is stated that although
a great number of our informants have been charged with
violations, a felony charge in itself is not as frequent
as Mr, Armstrong believes. A sampling of forty recently
approved PEIs shows that only seven of this forty had been
charged with a felony.

5. As to the observation concerning informants
having an unsavory background, it is noted our present
regulations as set out in Section 130, Volume IV, Manual of
Instructions require that individuals with unsavory back-
grounds who would not ordinarily be considered as PEIs
because of the possibility they would not make suitable
witnesses because of unfavorable characteristics such as
extensive arrest records, excessive indebtedness, emotional
quirks, abnormal sexual practices, poor employment records,
illiteracy, and personal physical defects receive Headquarters
approval. Our operation of informants has a twofold purpose
(1) to obtain intelligence and (2) evidence necessary for
successful prosecution of violations of local and Federal
statutes. We strongly believe we must continue this
requirement to insure our objectives are attained in all
cases.

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller
Re: Extremist Informant Program

As to specific guidelines furnished to SACs with
respect to individuals in sensitive positions, SACs through
past experience, are knowledgeable of the many possible
situations where operation of an informant and subsequent
disclosure could cause concern to the FBI. These areas
include the news media, entertainment field, academicians,
religious leaders, civil rights activists, politicians, and
many others. It takes common sense on the part of the SAC
to decide the areas in his particular division which could
fit in the above categories. The samples cited in the SAC
memorandum are to serve as a flag to the SAC to remind him
of this pitfall.

OBSERVATIONS :

What we have here in the form of a memorandum to
all SACs is a completely revised Extremist Informant Program,
formulated through a long series of discussions both written
and oral, which began during the August, 1972, inspection
of the Intelligence Division. This matter has not only been
discussed thoroughly within the Section and Division but it
also has been discussed and analyzed by all SACs as well as
their ,supervisors.

As a result of proposals previously submitted
Mr. Gray issued instructions that Messrs. Armstrong, Walters,
and Miller get together and come up with an Extremist Informant
Program which would serve the best interest of the FBI. Based
on these instructions from Mr. Gray, a completely revised
Extremist Informant Program, as set forth in the proposed
memorandum to all SACs, was furnished Messrs. Armstrong and
Walters for review prior to a meeting which took place on
2/20/73. This meeting was attended by Messrs. Armstrong,
Walters, and Miller as well as Mr. J. G. Deegan and

Mr. G. C. Moore of the IS-1 Section.

At the 2/20/73 meeting a thorough word-by-word
and line-by-line analysis was made of the proposed Extremist
Informant Program. Revisions were made concerning the proposals
and there was a free exchange of ideas in this regard. The
proposed SAC memorandum, which has been submitted for Mr. Gray's
approval, was agreed to by everyone present, including
Mr. Armstrong who now raises several points in which he

-3- CONTINUED - OVER

NW 68262 Docld:32989649 Page 869



Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller
Re: Extremist Informant Program

differs with the proposed instructions to the field. It
seems that the time has come that we get on with the job
of getting needed instructions to the field and that the
dialogue come to an end. If Mr. Armstrong had objections,
he should have raised them when we had the meeting which
was for that purpose.

We Zeel that we have a viable, workable program
which accomplishes the purposes which Mr. Gray had in
mind. It will close out any "listening post" concept
and enable the field to concentrate on areas where the
need is greatest. Furthermore, this proposed program has
been discussed in detail at last weeks session of the Black
Extremist, Urban Guerrilla Warfare and Informant Matters
School and those in attendance who are field supervisors
and key investigative personnel were all in agreement that
the proposed Extremist Informant Program is a sound one.

RECOMMENDATION :

That attached SAC memorandum be approved and sent.

Re: Extremist Informant Program

The following are exceptions to the SAC's authority
for granting the approval of the operation of a PEI. If any
of the following conditions exist, the SAC must obtain author-
ity from FBIHQ prior to operating any individual as a PEI:

1. Any individual in a sensitive position (i.e. news

as an informant could cause concern to the Bureau).

2. Any individual contemplating membership in, being
considered for membership in, or presently in an extremist
organization.

3, Any individual who has been charged with a
felony violation in the past five years.

4, Any individual who is presently under indictment
or is on probation or parole, Federal or local.

5. Any individual with an unsavory background yet’

organization or an unaffiliated extremist. In order to elevate
a PEI to an EI, he must have produced authentic data on
extremist activities and be in a position to continue furnishing
extremist intelligence information.

Confidential Source-Extremist:

A CS-E is an individual who is willing to cooperate
with the Bureau by furnishing extremist information brought
to his attention by virtue of his position in the community,
by his employment, or in view of his background in extremist
activities. This individual, whose identity must be protected,
will not be actively seeking information on behalf of the
Bureau. Prior to operating anyone as a CS-E, advise FBIHQ of
the individual's identity and the type of information he is
to furnish on a UACB basis.

OBSERVATIONS:

Our present urban informants will be evaluated to
determine if they should be considered in the future as EIs,
PEIs, CS-Es, directed to the Security or Criminal Informant
Programs, or discontinued altogether.

No individual will be operated as an EI or PEI solely
because he is in a "listening post" position. To assure we have
informant coverage in those areas where there is a potential for
violence, instructions have been issued to each SAC to insure
all Special Agent personnel are aware of the need for developing
information where there is a potential for violence. SACs will be
instructed that those Special Agents not directly involved with
extremist matters, refer those individuals who may possess informa-
tion of potential violence to the Extremist Supervisor in order
that their informant potential may be assessed.

The field will be instructed that CS-Es are not
to be kept in a pending status unless these sources aré

This investigation is predicated upon the .
_ following information which reflects the full support of the~
Communist Party, USA (GPUSA) to the August 28, 1963
March on Washington:

Source furnished a letter daed June 11, 1963,
on the letteriead of the CPUSA, 23 West 26th street, New
York 10, New York, addressed "To All Districts" from the
"Organization Commission,” This letter reflects the
following:

"Dear Comrades:

"The mareh on Washington, August 28th, called by
the major organizations conducting the fight for civil
rights, is an event of the greatest historic importance.

It deserves the support of everyone who recognizes

that this struggle isessential to guaranteeing constitutional
rights for all and for the further democratic advance of our
country.

"Por this reason, we, as all other labor and
progressive groups, will lend our full support to this event,

"We urge you follow closely these developments
and that you follow the Worker and Midweek Worker on the
progress of the campaign, as well as suggestions for its
further development,"

Source related this letter was erroneously dated
\ sune 11, 1963, rather than July 11, 1963.

iy INTEREST OF CPUSA IN MARCH ON WASHINGTON

A. National Leadership, CPUSA +

tt At a meeting of leading cP functionaries : atara!
held June 19, 1963, in New York, JAMES E, JACKSON reported on
the importance of the Negro liberation movement and the
importance of getting legislation abolishing segregation in
all public places, He called for a Federal policy o*
non-diserimination, and the inclusion of on-the-job t
for Negroes in all areas of the United States.

vining

JACKSON stated 100,000 to 200,000 white
people should join with the Negro people in a massive
Geiidiistration in Wachinston, D.Cc.; in the event of a
filibuster to prevent the passage of civil vights laws.
He added a cooperative relationship must be established among
the Negro organizations,

BENJAMIN J, DAVIS remarked everyone is calling the
Negro movement a revolution, He said it is a transition
of the Negro in this country from second class to first
class,citizenship within the framework of our present social
' system, He continued, “We are witnessing a revolutionary
movement in our country, but we are just not in it..."

DAVIS said the biggest single question is not the
disagreement and disunity among Negro leaders, which is
serious enough, but it igs the fact that the white allies of
the Negro people are not coming into the struggle enough.
He said he would like to see a plan of action develop and
would like "to see the Party get on all fours in respect
to the struggle," -

IRVING POTASH commented the differences which exist

POTASH said the criticism against ‘the Party is
valid, and it is correct to say “we" are not coming forward, _
not writing “and not giving leadership. The leadership of the
Party should explore all ways and means for all of "us"
| to play a bigger role in this-struggle “which we have not

r

done yet," :

POTASH felt the trade union movement was not making
a real struggle because of their own discrimination, and
the comrades must find ways to "build a fire" under the
leadership of the trade. union movement.

ELIZABETH GURLEY FLYNN stated no matter how much
"we" do, it is not enough, but, on the other hand, "we"
should not underestimate the work the Party does,

JACK STACHEL stated the purpose of the meeting was to discuss
the August 28th march on Washington, D.C., which he said
‘chad two objectives:

a. To arouse the conscience of America to the
epnomic plight of the Negro in the United states,

-2, To demand that an effective and meaningful
civil rights bill be passed by Congress, to protest
against filibuster and demand majority rule in the United

STACHEL described plans being made by organizations
preparing this demonstration and then asked rhetorically,
"How can we explain to anybody in the future that >
100,000 people went to Washington and we were not among them?!

STACHEL proposed that, if need be, the Party

i that contact be made with Jewish clubs and national groups
| such as the Hungarians, Russians, Ukranians and Armenians
| in order to get people for the demonstration. He commented
| "We must convey this approach to the other Districts, There
are tremendous possibilities here for contacts with the
Negroes, in the Jewish field, the youth, It can open up a
new life for us,"

IRVING POTASH proposed that Comrades go to

there are congregations of Negro population,"

WIELIAM ALBERTSON said it must be realized that
before this “civil rights revolution" got underway, the Party
was isolated from the movement of the Negro people. He stated
that to build the Party, it must be shown “that you are the
best picketers, the best cadre fighting, the best of i

. everything, otherwise you are just a propaganda organization
and you are not participating in the struggle."

ALBERTSON proposed the opening of a special
headquarters in Washington, D.C. He stated "the people
that we organize can go there as part of a whole group, and
then they separate themselves there," He suggested that
recruits for the demonstration be sought among people"
who do not have mass responsibilities" noting "we have a
whole group of needle trades Comrades who are retired."

WILLIAM WEINSTONE proposed that a quantity of
literature be carefully selected to get into the hands of
the people and "thereby help to deepen the struggle.”

ARNOLD JOHNSON said there should be a meeting

between the National Association for the Advancement of

Colored People (NAACP), the church groups and the various

othex agencies that are participating so that some kind of

order can temaintained, He said that there should be a

full-fledged discussion on this and proposed that the NAACP

noting that in this way "we may receive a share of the TV, .

said that besides contacting all these other agencies, it
is very important to contact the unions, both as to their

never had before in history."

AIBERTSON aid "we" have two objectives:

1. Participation by the total membership.

2. "we" take responsibility for initiating

the relationship between Negroes and Puerto Ricans, which
can be harmful, According to THOMPSON, the Puerto Ricans
have not been successful, because they have not gone
through what the Negro has over the years, Coupled with
this, is also the fact that the Puerto Ricans do not desire
to be linked with the Negro population, md as a result
elements of racism are showing,

Continuing, THOMPSON remarked that the Puerto
Rican movement may develop under its:iown leadership,
and "our’ job" should be to attempt to get a development

LUSTIG, in commenting on the March, said that
the number represented will depend upon the amount of
transportation available, He said the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has
sponsored a train from Newark to Washington, D.C., and that
buses*will be sponsored by the Congress of Racial Equality
(CORE), and will leave for Washington from Lincoln Park in
Newark, New Jersey. LUSTIG, in concluding his comments,
stated that the most important thing is that following the
March, the participating organizations will hold a conference

March itself, a

he has regarding the March is that there will ve a large
number of young people attending, He said that a young
person from Pittsburgh had written to him saying that
between two and three thousand people are expected
to go to Washington, D.C. by train and bus, RUBIN said
the one big problem that has arisen is "What is our special
role in all of this? We have people with a lot of
enthusiasm working with people unrelated with us.”

“this situation applies not,only to New York but to all sections

REITAMTN J. DAVIS agreed that ten thousad

copies of "The Worker" should be distributed as a Party
enterprise, He said that as a result there could be

a substantial increase in the paper's circulation, as
well as a build-up for the Party.

DAVIS commented that GEORGE MEANEY's statement
regarding the Negro Movement indicates a white chauvinist
and a white supremacy attitude. DAVIS felt that MEANEY,
becausé of his attitude, is turning the Negro Movement
over to the muslims and other extremists. He recommended
that the Party call upon workers and labor leaders to
repudiate MEANEY's statement. At the same time "we" should
defend A, PHILIP RANDOLPH and WALTER REUTHER's attitude,
DAVIS was of the opinion that RANDOLPH would welcome a
sharp criticism of GEORGE MEANEY, 7

action will have an efgct.not only in relation to the

«concerning the August 28, 1963 march in Washington,

distribution, "we" can bring in "outside forces",

2. Propose that an attachment be added to ~
the leaflets already printed which would be a
pledge to participate in the march or to pledge
funds for expenses, :

3. Propose that a speakers committee be formed
to provide speakers to address church groups,
unions, ete. concerning the march. TORMEY said that
if this proposal is adopted, someone from the caucus
group should be on the committee, or better still,
be the ehaimman of the ca thea.

4, Propose that if the speakers committee is
established, a list of the various unions in New
York City be obtained along with a schedule of
their meeting dates in order that NALC speakers
could attend the various meetings to solicit support
for the march. TORMEY said that this would serve to
obtain union sanctions for the march or to get their
representatives to take part in the march,

5. Propose that NALC delegates be sent to the
New York City Central Trades and Labor Council to
enlist their support for the march. TORMEY felt
that the construction trades would probably support
the march or take part in it so as not to gain the
label of segregationists.

CONNIE BART commented she had observed JACK STACHEL,
MIKE and GAIL DAVIDOW~-in attendance at the March on
Washington, 7 7 if

NY T-47
August 29, 1963

The records of the Northwest Airlines, Seattle,
Washington, reflect that MILFORD SUTHERLAND left on Flight
Number 80 at 12:20 a.m., August 28, 1963, for Washington,
D.C., to arrive at Dulles Airport. He had reservations to
leave Washington, D.C., on the same date.

LEONA TRANQUILLI, ORVILLE EDWARD LINTON and
BERNICE LINTON attended the March on Washington, They
did not represent any organization but part of their
assignment was to sell Communist newspapers and literature
at the bus sites and in Washington, D.C., in accordance
with previous instructions received for the Greater New
York Press Club.
€
iaeeet They had with them 100 copies of "The Worker" and
various CP pamphlets which they began to sell at about 3:00 pom.
when the March on Washington began to break up. They sold \
these items until about 5:30 p.m. and were completely sold
out when they left, Proceeds from the sale in the amount
of $25.00 were turned over to "The Worker",

NY T-17
September 19, 1963

On September 7, 1963, JAMES TORMEY stated he had
driven to Washington, D.C., on August 28, 1963, with his wife,
BETTY GANNETT, and ROBERT THOMPSON, to attend the March on
Washington. He said he met GUS HALL in Washington, D.C., and
that most of the CP leadership was in attendance at the March.

TORMEY added that the reason he and most of the CP
leadership went by car was so they would not attach any stigma
to the March on Washington.

.

Deputy Chief HOWARD V. COVELL, Executive
Officer,+Metropolitan Police Department, Washington, D.C.,
on September 18, 1963, made available to SA PAUL E, MORRISON,
a card index which, he advised, contained the names and
affiliations of individuals who had applied for’and received
press cards to attend the Civil.Rights March on Washington.
This was held at Washington, D.C., on August 28, 1963.

Among these cards was one for PAUL NOVICK, the
"Morning Freiheit", Press Card 1136. :

No instructions or directives were issued by the
officials of the CP of Eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware
(CPEPD) to any members of the CPEPD in regard to the March

for Washington, D,C., bundles of "The Worker" were Blaced on

. the buses chartered by Advance, as well as copies of a. ot
“statement by the PYOC on, its "Right to Earn, Right to Learn

It was decided, in view of the positicn of the
leaders of the March on Washington, to leave the bundles
of "The Worker" unopened on the bus.

NY T-17 additionally reported that upon arrival
in Washington, D.C., members of the informant's group were
given pamphlets written by BEN DAVIS dealing with the Negro
fight for civil rights.

Following the March, these individuals sold about
100 copies of "The Worker" and various CP pamphlets.

Source advised a large Detroit delegation convened
on the mall by the Washington Monument. ‘There was a short
meeting of CP members from Detroit and it was brought out
that "We" should reverse the march, that is, to persuade the
people to march to Capitol Hill instead of the Lincoln
Memorial. This idea was abandoned as not being feasible :
as there were too many marshals and Military Police deployed
around Capitol Hill.

Pan TOMMY DENNIS stated "we" should have brought a
determined group of young people who could stampede the
individuals attending the March into reverse, marching on
Capitol Hill instead of the Lincoln Memorial. DENNIS stated
this demonstration is only the beginning and "we" have won a
point just by having such a demonstration. DENNIS said that
the next time, possibly in two or three years, "we" will have
nother March, and this one will be a March on Congress.

million people in the March. He stated that one quarter of
the people in the March were white and that he and the Party
could take credit for there having been so many white. people
in the March. HALL further stated the Party "had a great
deal to do with this and that the Party played a major role
in many of these white people going to Washington."

NY T-45
August 28, 1953

A meeting of leading CP functionaries was held
August 30, 1963, at CP Headquarters, New York City.

The discussion concerned itself with the e¢ivil rights
legislation pending in Congress and what could be done to get
the Congress to react favorably towards this legislation now
that the March on Washington was a success.

JACK STACHEL urged that efforts should be made to
get the labor unions involved in this fight. WILLIAM L.
PATTERSON commented that demonstrations should be held in front
of press offices demanding editorials on the need to do away
with the filibusters in Congress.

ARNOLD JOHNSON called for work stoppages as well as
demonstrations in Washington, D.C., as an anti-filibuster
step. He said the work stoppages could be for a few minutes
each day, to be increased daily as long as the filibusters
continue.

BENJAMIN J. DAVIS, Jr., stated that the CP should
think more along the lines of a mass movement of a non-partisan

nature, sayi g “the “struggle is for all Americans and that it
has placed the AmefPican system on trial. He noted that the
Muslims;:as a result of the March on Washington, were "buried".
DAVIS said that he would propose that the CP have péople
demonstrate in Washington, D.C., every day of the filibuster. -
“.He also felt that it was possible to have ten million Negroes
shut down everything in this country as an anti-filibuster
move. He felt that the work stoppages could be for fifteen
minutes a day on the first day and the next day incre the
work stoppage to a period of two hours. He felt that it was
a legitimate demand to mobilize the American people in order
to break any filibuster.

DAVIS averred to the recent article by DAVID LAWRENCE
in the "New York Herald Tribune." He described LAURENCE's
coiumn as tne worst one in tne entire country. DAViIs svated
that in his opinion, he did not believe that it would be out of
line to set up a picket line around the "New York Herald Tribune."
He said the picket line would be along the lines that DAVID
LAWRENCE must go or there must be a public apology by that
paper. DAVIS also felt that some effort should be made to force
Governor NELSON ROCKEFELLER of New York to take an active part
in breaking any filibuster. :

At this meeting, the main point on the agenda was
the March on Washington. i
BENJAMIN J, DAVIS discussed the March. He characterized
it as "the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history
of the country" and said there is a feeling in many quarters
that official estimates of the March were lower on attendance
figures than the number who actually participated. He stated
that although the newspapers said there were approximately 200,000,

DAWIS called for the establishment of a policy
committee by the CPUSA for the purpose of bringing the -
meaning ‘Of the March to the people and to act on local
problems. He commented, "More and more it is going” to be :
necessary to work on our contribution within the framework + -
of the March...to fight for the role of the working man... —
more and more it becomes necessary to work for the ideoinzy
of this particular movement and the working class...”

According to DAVIS, the breaking of a filibucter "is
the main next job" and pressure must be put on the President
of the United States to break the resistance.

JAMES JACKSON commended DAVIS on his report. He
stated that ROY WILKINS, Executive Secretary of the nal
Association for the Advancenent of Colored veopse {
had paid tribute to Dr. DU BOIS and it was his opinion
that "there seemed to be kind of a second thought that the
Negro movement at this stage in its organizational security
can ill afford its divorcement of the exnerience and the
substantial contribution of Negro Marxists." JACKSON
noted that every newspaper in every country in the world has
identified DU BOIS, not only as a leading literary figure, but
also és a Communist.

- In describing the role of thé CPUSA, JACKSON said that,
‘although equipped with proper foresignt and projections, it
could not be said that the practical, organizational functions
of responsibility fitted the projections made." He said

We were one of many stimulating elements...but in this we
played a-rather_anonymous_role and we functioned more or less
as_individuals. Our mission was that-or-undistinguisnable
parts of the whole. In many areas our people were responsible
for getting fine turnouts...the stimulating role our people
played in certain areas needed additional emphasis...as to just
what should be our particular role...it is a sad fact that in
the huge mass role we performed anonymously."

JACKSON then, asked rhetorically "Was there no special
role for the Party?" and continued that "it points out a
serious aspect of the Party - a kind of critical aspect of
organizational laxity, a problem of definition of our identity."

JACKSON was critical of the fact that so few
participated in the distribution of "The Worker" and other
literature noting that "in spite of the fact that the
literature was neatly packaged and all prepared, in spite of
the fact there were decisions and commitments, 3 or 4 people
participated in the distribution..." He said this was not
just another mass meeting but was "a big chunk of the most
advanced area of the American popular masses and working class."
He noted that “this is an assembly that comes once in the life-
time of a pacty to asscaiblc the militant, dedicated people who
erossed half the country, gave up their jobs for a day or so,
sacrificed to get into a social struggle. This was a natural
pawn in which Communists should exist...to be with these
people, eat with them, meet with them, develop address with
which they could further communicate."

JACKSON recalled the faét that, with only one
dissenting vote, it had been decided that there be a
special edition of "The Worker" for the March and that "a
hundred comrades should participate" in its distribution
pone spite of this, the one dissent was the prevailing
reaction.

GUS HALL asked how many copies were sold and LOUIS

WEINSTOCK stated that'1,400 copies of” "The Worker" ‘were
sold "that day" and a total of about 1,000 pamphlets were
also sold.
i WEINSTOCK remarked that final arrangements were
! made three or four weeks before the affair and "there were
' nineteen people at the meeting where 100 were supposed to
come, five of them non-Communists..."

JACKSON stressed the need for getting better
organizational means to get people to work, He said
that, while in Weshington, he had gotten "maybe a half
dozen invitations from trade unions" and that the trade
‘unions put on a wremendous public relations job. He ~ oft
noted that there was a Soctalist Party conference for
elvil rights held on Thursday and Friday following the March
attended by 100 people at the first session and about 300
people at the second session. :

WILLIAM PATTERSON remarked "I think there is the
opportunity for us to strengthen our participation in the
follow-up (of the August 28th March) in the major districts

and states that have not only struggled for public works
n

programs but also other unemployment programs
MORTIMER DANIEL RUBIN stated he thought there was

an improvement in youth work in terms of participation through

mass organizations and there has been an improvement in terms

of involvement of youth in civil rights demonstrations.

IRVING POTASH commented "the country will not be
the sage after this March. I think an examination will
probably show that many of our comrades played a very
important role in bringing about or helping to bring about
the participation of quite a number of trade unionists and
trade union officials in this."

POTASH stated the CPUSA must play a very important
role in the civil rights struggle and "the youth movement in
particular has a terrific role to play, and first of all to
establish basic relations with the Negro youth.”

POTASH continued, "It is not difficult to establish
those unions where the Communists have a great deal of

influence, Those were the unions which produced the greatest
participation in this March. To some extent this is true of

it has a great deal of left influence...you take District 65

(District 65 Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union,

AFL-CIO) with a participation of four and one half ‘thousand,

certainly there is an example of left influence, Communist °* -
“influence, where these unions have led the upsurge in the

Negro struggle." i

POTASH, with respect to the role of the CPUSA,
stated he thought that up to now the Party has been too
cautious and it should be put on the agenda to move into this
area with a greater decisiveness.

* At a meeting of leading CP functionarles
held September 6, 1963, in New York, JAMES E. JACKSON
reported on the August 28th, 1963 March on Washington,
Claiming that "not since the Civil War have so many
official bodies of the working population of our country
associated themselves actively under tne banner of the
struggle for the rights of the Negro people ." He said that
the speeches were notable by the absence of red baiting and
there was a unity of purpose between the leadership and those
who yarticipated in the March.

JACKSON mentioned his attendance at a conference
called by the Socialist Party and held in Washington, D.C.,
during the week of the March. He said the conference was
very significant because it attracted to it as participants
and speakers, many of the leading personalities and key
administrators of the March. JACKSON commented, "One of
the very interesting contributions at this conference was
made by BAYARD RUSTIN who described himself as a fellow
traveler of the Socialist Party."

JACKSON Was’ critical of the role of "The
Worker" “in connection with the March, stating "our paper
in comparison with any paper did not follow this event
as it should have done. The truth is that very little bzatd
“happened to utilize 'The Worker' to establish our banner
above the other banners in this movement."

JACKSON pointed out that, in spite of the
decision to publish a véry large number of extra
copies of "The Worker" dedicated to the March, the paper
was not utilized at the March, He described the failure
of adequate distribution of "The Worker" as a serious
weakness in organization and said "Our Party is the
vehicle to socialism. The 200,000 people who took part
ia the March should be the 290,000 people who snoula be
in our Party. So we had the additional duty in this March
to win Party members."

GEORGE MORRIS said that the union representation
at the August 28th March was brought there by unions that
are partially or to some extent Socialist-Party influenced
or have a Left background. He described this as a
revitalization of the united front and stated "I think this
is something for us to seriously think about because it
again emphasizes that there is a base for progressive
activity."

A meeting of léading CP functionaries was held
September 16, 1963, in New York.

JAMES JACKSON reviewed the racial situation in
Birmingham, Alabama, and announced that "The Worker" would
earry a lead editorial on the first page demanding that
Governor WALLACE of Alabama be brought to justice; demanding
that the President establish federal occupational authority
throughout Alabama; demanding a roundup of the membership of
the American Nationalist Party, the White Citizens Councils,
and the Ku Klux Klan; and demanding the immediate discharge of
J. EDGAR HOOVER, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI), and a complete reorganization of the FBI.

. © WILLIAM PATTERSON said that, immediately after hearing
of the bombing in Birmingham, he reached a number of people in
the Harlem area of New York City, and raised the question of
sending telegrams and holding some kind of demonstration.

PATTERSON said that, while he thought JACKSON's
Statement concerning the FBI was correct, he would like to see
a special article devoted to the FBI and "its complete failure
ever the years" in relation to racial matters in the United 5
States. oF ;

ROBERT THOMPSON stated the CPUSA should try to bring
about effective, immediate action by the New York City Committee
on Racial Equality. He said there should be some kind of major
action in New York City, either in the nature of a mass meeting
or a march and the Party should undertake a campaign in New York
and nationally to influence public opinion in this situation.

IRVING POTASH said it is not enough to throw
responsibility on Governor WALLACE of Alabama, but it must
be stated in clear terms that the federal government also
has a certain responsibility for what is happening In Alabama.
~ POTASH noted that President KENNEDY is scheduled
to appear before the United Nations (UN) and suggested it might
be advisable to set up delegations to submit petitions and
demands "even before he gets to the UN", thereby precipitating
a possible demonstration at the UN.

POTASH also suggested the possibility of taking the
proposed statement for "The Worker" and reading it publicly
at some federal office, "possibly at Foley Square" in order
"to dramatize our feelings in this matter."

BEN DAVIS commented, "I feel bitterly disappointed
and bitterly dissatisfied with the response of our Party." He
said the Negro movement has now reached the stage which requires
a sharpening up of "our attack on the Kennedy administration."
DAVIS urged greater activity on the part of the CPUSA stating,
"T am of the opinion that unless our Party finds a way,
symbolically or personally, or in some other way, to integrate
itself «in some public manner, if not in its own name, then
through some organization in which the Party is known to have
influence, we are just going to get a setback that will take us
years and years to overcome."

++ "Brutal murder of 6 Negro children yesterday in
Birmingham demands immediate action and Federal troeps to

responsible for murder and’ bombings. Federal authorities
must take power of government away from such bloody hands.
Failure to act vigorously in this erisis will not be
tolerated by justice loving Americans. You can no longer
ignore the growing popular demands for arrest of Wallace
and those who ineite racist violence and defiance of United
States Constitution. Action must be taken to dissolve the
Ku Klux Klan, the White Citizens Councils, the American Nazi
Party, the National States Rights Party, and all racist

segregationists in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and
elsewhere in the south, for the full establishment of
constitutional liberties immediately to all Negro
| Americans and the establishment of new genuinely democratic
government in those states in accord with the United States
Constitution. Nething short of these minimum measures will
constitute adequate response by you to the challenge of the
Birmingham bombing outrages. You, President Kennedy, are

AE this ‘neeting it was stated the student council of

Tuskegee Instituté had issued an invitation to GUS HALL or
some other representative of the CPUSA to participate in a
series of platform speakers to develop "ideas and philosophy

_ occupying various positions along the ideological spectrum.”

- HALL was requested to explain the basic philosophy of the
CPUSA, and discuss what he felt to be the main threat to the
democratic idea.

7 BEN DAVIS spoke of the letter from Tuskegee
Institute describing it as of greatest importance. He
asserted that the Negroes are now willing, as are other
forces, to know what the Communist Party has to say and
to listen to Communists and welcome whatever support, guidance,
leadership, and practical sacrifice the Communists can give
“4n this new stage, wich 1s how tc breals the resiatance of
the Dixiecrats and how to stop the McCarran Act." DAVIS stated
that the letter from Tuskegee indicates how the students
are thinking and "These students want to know what the
Communists have to say about a democratic perspective in

The meeting concerned itself primarily with a report
being prepared by BENJAMIN J. DAVIS, Jr. on the Negro struggle
in the United States.

BENJAMIN J, DAVIS, Jr. discussed an outline form for
the report he is preparing. He said that he did not intend

‘
‘

~65-

“TA 6BZEZ—DOTINS298969~Page-S¥A———


NA 32989649 Pa

NY 100-151548

that his report be considered an ideological report,, noting
there is "no Chines@ wall" between questions of ideology and

a political Tine. He.said it is possible to divide the.two.
The point. of the report is to concentrate on the next step

in the Negro movement as a whole. DAVIS felt that the Party
had defined the character ‘of the Negro Revolution and "our . ,
‘position" is essentially that the Negro movement is national
in form despite the fact’that "we" nad come up with the
erroneous position of "self-determination."

DAVIS said that the Negro people have adopted a
method of struggle, namely “peaceful, non-violent, direct
mass action." He said this is now the chosen method of
struggle by the Negro masses. He said the new question coming
up, as a result of the bombings in Birmingham, is whether now
is the time to abandon the whole question of non-violent
action, He said it was his opinion that they chould net
abandon this theory because the purpose of the violence in
Birmingham is to provoke the Negro and to date, the Negro
has shown more self-restraint in the fac® of it.

Continuing, DAVIS said "we" must make it clear
that "we are for these self-defense programs of the Negroes."
He said the Negro should have the right to defend himself
agains brutal attacks by racists with whatever weapons they
can. He said the Party should point out that the Federal
Government should step in and protect the Negro so that this
responsibility is not left on the Negro people. DAVIS said
the Negro people are in favor of Federal action in Birmingham
and want Federal troops to take over the state. He felt that
an additional goal is to break the resistance of the Dixiecrats
which means "illegaiizing and outlawing" all fascist organizations ,
operating in the South. ;

DAVIS commented that the two-man truce team sent by
the KENNEDY Administration to Birmingham (KENNETH C, ROYALL and
EARL C, BLAIK) was a pitiful step by the administration. He
said that KING (MARTIN LUTHER KING, President of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference) made a serious mistake when
he agreed to accept these two people. DAVIS said that in
criticizing this method "we" should put the blame on the
KENNEDY Administration and not on KING.

~66-



NY 100-151548

Continuing, DAVIS stated tnat the great.unity achieved
as a result ef the. August 28, March on Washington can only be
maintained by the development of further mass motions of this
character, adding "you cannot have unity of the Negyo people
if they omit actions." He said the domestic leadership of .

. the Negro movement, in one form or another, is tied in some
“way to the KENNEDY Administration. This is a situation
that requires greater independence on the part of the Negro
movement and its leaders. The key question is "how to get
our line out and how to fight for it and how the party is
going to exert some control and some influence."

DAVIS stated that the August 28, March on Washington
was not only a historical and unprecedented demonstration of
the unity of the Negro people as well as the white people, but
that the March transferred ihe responsibility to the Federa.
Government and to the American citizen. He said the next
step, following Birmingham and the bombings, has to be a step
involving masses of people. Since everyone "at the demonstration"
took a pledge to sit in, to stand in, to demonstrate, now is the
time, in my opinion, for the leaders of the Negro movement to
use this to advantage. DAVIS stated that the South in the next
five years will be the additional force which can be brought
into the progressive movement and will help change the whole
relatiénship of forces. He said “somehow our party has to appear
as the champion of the Negro people's movement and as the
champion of the very low poverty levels of living of the white
masses in the South."

He said this has to be done and it is not being done
at the present time, There is no representative form of
government in Alabama, Mississippi and other states. The
focus of attention should be on what is the main source of
resistance in the South today, the implementation of the rights
of the Negro people. DAVIS felt that there was a need for some
center from which a consistent policy and leadership could be
given in order to reach wide sections of the Negro people.

He said it should be something broad, something militant, something
which gives action from another center and which gives direct
leadership ip such a form that it can be an accepted part of
the new revolution’ He said it was time that "we went around
and talked to some of the Negro leaders in order to,see how this
could be developed. He said "we have to have a fori in which |
the consistent policy of the Party can be brought forward and “
‘.can be approximated, if not fully, as closely as possible and
that can reach great masses of the Negro people". DAVIS
acknowledged that this "means money and it means a thorough
discussion on our part." :

DAVIS also remarked that Harlem is a problem that
must be solved because other forces have taken over the Harlem
community "and the Party is no where around.” He said this is
the number one Party problem to be solved. "We" have to keep
-in mind the image of “our Party" among the Negro people as well
ag tne white workers and progressives throughout the country.

Following DAVIS! comments a discussion period
followed. ROBERT THOMPSON said that the main object of
the report is to develop the question "What is required now
to successfully force federal intervention in Alabama?"

He said that "we" have to defend KING's leadership in this
movement...especially the leadership that KING represents.
THOMPSON remarked that he did not agree that there was

a need for a new center for the civil rights movement

as suggested by DAVIS. He said it would not serve a
useful purpose and such a center would be a focal point
for the gathering of "every flighty element that is trying
to horn in on the real movement."

THOMPSON said "we" have to think about the
development of the strength and role of the Negro-American ‘
Labor Council (NALC). He said their activities can play ‘
a real part and can be expanded to shape the program of 7
the civil rights movement.

GUS HALL expressed the opinion that there is a
need now to discuss the question of a new party, a party
of labor and Negro. There is a need to discuss a new

~68-

NY 100-151548

alignment, not ‘hecdssarily a new party but one which could
emerge as a Biant political action. He felt that there was
also a need to project new ideas on the part of labor "in
order to get out of their rut." »

JAMES JACKSON said the report-should give a rousing”
salute to the Negro in this year 1963. The main thing
is the glorious rise of the Negro in America which has
inspired the world. JACKSON, in commenting on the pending
civil rights bill, felt.that there should be a lobby down
in Washington on this bill.

ARNOLD JOHNSON stated that labor will play an
important role in the Negro movement and he was in favor
of some sort of a Negro political action committee.

- IRVING POTASH stated that there was a need for
unity in the Negro movement. He said "our party" for years
has projected this idea and the Party should signify
the weakness of this unity. He said that the right of self-
defense by the Negro is a most important question and "we"
should take a forthright position on it. He said the
Negro patrols in Birmingham have our support in view of the
fact that the Federal authorities are not carrying out
their responsibilities. He said that if the Federal
authorities were carrying out their responsibilities, it would
be a different situation.

GILBERT GREEN commented that what had been
discussed can be the basis for a good report. He said
there is a need to take the Negro freedom struggle off
the streets and into the courts. "Our party" should be
careful to maintain the unity of the Negro struggle. "We
should not impose the party on this movement. We should do
nothing which will either turn this movement into an anti-
Communist movement or will divide the movement."

GREEN said “our objective" must be to press the

administration to break with the Dixiecrats and this will
guarantee the renovation of the South.

NY 100-151546

BENJAMIN J, DAVIS, ‘in concluding the discussion,
said the Party must concentrate on influencing the leaders
and the poligies of the Negro liberation movement. He said
“we" should suggest that there be in Washington in gome
public place like the Washington Monument or the Lincoln
Memorial a round-the-clock massing of people with
‘outstanding speakers from all over the country to continue
until the filibuster is bréken. He said "many people in
the movement are officially considering this." DAVIS said
"our access" to various forces and figures in this movement
is not cut off. "I am not the only one who has this
access. Gus (Hall) and Jim (Jackson) have it as well as
others on various levels." DAVIS said the question is, are
we satisfied with "the limited instrumentalities that we
now have?" DAVIS further remarked "we must have elements
of boldness and change our role from one that just defines
pyiicy aid evaluation vo one that helps shape po.acy.”
DAVIS said "This guy Rustin calls me constantly...openly."

DAVIS, in concluding his remarks, stated that
the Party must demand (President) KENNEDY ccue out against
the ultra right and take a sharp position against them.

He said "we" must demand that a deadline be set for integration
in the country.

On September 17, 1963, a CPUSA New York District meeting
was held at Hellanis Halli, 269 West 25th Street, New York City.
WILLIAM L, PATTERSON acted as Chairman and the agenda included
an evaluation of the March on Washington by ROBERT THOMPSON. In

his report, THOMPSON made the following observations:
The March was.orderly and calm, without any incidents
which would have detracted from it. Negro and whiteunity has

t

NY 100-151548 :

been raised to a new level by the March. The struggle for
equality is a struggle for all Americans not for Negroes
alone. The March was ‘excellent but the murder of Negroes

in Alabama and the fact that police brutality is still a

major issue against Negroes should have been brought out more
in the March, . : +
- The leaders of-the March should concentrate on

these proposals in regard to civil rights and a strong

Fair Employment Practices Commission, They should see that
the Negro is protected in his right to vote in the South

and a fight made for full equality in the struggle for jobs.
The Negro fight Zor jobs is a test for the labor movement

and Negro and white allies. This fight should be concentrated
industry by industry and understanding in trade unions raised
to a new level.

Although the March was good, there was not enough
organization in the graces root section of the movement,
especially in the Puerto Rican comaunisy. ‘Few Puerto Ricans
took part because they were not ozgan d ani were not told what
the March was all about. The Puerto a

an inovement should be
bullt up and this is one field the Pa could move into and
do a good job. :

. £ The Negro American Labor Council was not as successful
as it should have been in the March. ‘This organization has
been going downhill since its last convention in its fight for
Negro rights. However, individual leaders, especially A.
PHILIP RANDOLPH, showed great strength and character.

The formation of the new Negro party is a danger
to the Negro movement at the present time. It is a danger

fo oe Negro movement because its name will split the movement
self. 7

In regard to the Party activity in the March, "The Worker"
did not effectively reach the hands of those who attended this
event, Very few volunteers showed up to distribute "The Worker"
at the various points of embarkation from New York to Washington,
D.C. Although the role of the Party was a correct estimate of

. LOCAL CP CLUBS, NEW YORK DISTRICT

JAMES TORMEY gave a report on the Negro Movement
and the August 28, 1963 March on Washington,
at a meeting of the CP caucus in the New York Chapter of
the Negro American Labor Council (NALC).

Spe qUABT eehsBHaP paPiSBSE#/-en = EEeanUStGn SSSI #7 sEn=RESEEREOrE
TORMEY advised the following in his report.

The Negro Movement is a revolutionary movement
aimed at the elimination of the residue of slavery and
intimidation of the Negro people. Reverend MARTIN LUTHER
KING has said that the whole Movement is a basic attack
-against the power structure of the United States, and
-that this is most important because it is a Marxist approach
‘to the problem coming from a Negro leader.

Concerning the August 28, 1963, March on Washington,
the Negro leadership estimated 250,000 people participated
with an estimate of approximately thirty per cent white people.
This is very important to the overall success of the March.

The Muslim and Black Nationalist Movement suffered
a serious setback because of the March on Washington, the way
it was received and the way that it was carried out without
any riots or fighting. a

. The efforts of the progressives to obtain the labor
unions participation in the Civil Rights and Negro Movement
is tantamount to saving labor unions. If the Labor Movement
‘does not: become involved in this struggle they could be

serlously weakened. Labor seriously needs the alliance
with the Negro Movement. if

The contemplated March on City Hall: in New, York
City scheduled for September 29, 1963, was called off. The :
reason given was that as originally planned it wovld have been
mainly concerned with the building trades and would have
been dangerous and may have destroyed labor's part in the March.

5 The March on City Hall should include other demands ~
besides those against the building trades.

When the new date is announced for the March
on City Hall, “we" will have an all out job, The bridge
between labor and the Negro People's Movement is the Negro

* 1. Newark, New Jersey
\ At a CP meeting held September 4, 1963, in Newark,

New Jersey, a discussion was held relative to the March on
Washington,

It was stated by one of the members present that
he felt the March would not accomplish any great change in
Congress, and it would not bring civil rights closer, but it
Was a success in that the Marcn was actually held. Further,
that President KENNEDY, by -being so nice, had robbed the
March of its militancy. President KENNEDY, by endorsing the
March, attracted many people to the March who otherwise would not
have attended.

It was further felt that a bad part of the March
was the failure of those participating not to realize that

the United States must have socialism to bring about civil
rights and end unemployment.

INDEPENDENT SOCIALIST LEAGUE (ISL), formerly
Known as the Workers Party (WP)

The May 4, 1942, issue of “Labor Action", then an offi-
cial publication of the Workers Party (WP), carried an article
which reflected that the WP was formed in April, 1940, as a
result of a split within the leadership of the Socialist Workers
Party (SWP). The article stated that when the Hitler-Stalin Pact
was signed and Poland invaded, the minority group within the SWP,
in proclaiming the formation of the WP, condemned the pact as
being imperialistic in nature and stated it would not support
either imperialist camp.

The April 25, 1949, issue of “Labor Action” contained
, an account of the Fifth National Convention of the WP, held March
24-27, 1949, in New York City, which reflected the change of name
og the organizuiion from the WP to the independent Sociasist-
League (ISL) in order to emphasize the character of the group as
@ propaganda group for the spreading of socialist ideas and not -
as a full-fledged political party.

The July 14, 1958, issue of "Labor Action", an official
publication of the ISL, contained an article captioned "The ISL
_Program in Brief", The article indicated: "The ISL stands for
Socialist democracy and against the two systems of exploitation
which now divide the world: capitalism and Stalinism. The ISL,
as a Marxist movement, looks to the working class and its ever-
present struggle as the basic progressive force in society. The
ISL is organized to spread the ideas of socialism in the labor
movement and among all other sections of the people. There can
be no lasting and genuine democracy without socialism and there
can be no socialism without democracy."

The September 22, 1958, issue of "Labor Action" con-
tained an undated statement signed by the Political Committee of
the ISL which indicated that the ISL had been dissolved. The
statement urged former ISL members to join the Socialist Party ~

(NSCAFEP) was held at Madison, Wisconsin, April 25-27, 1952.

SOCIALIST YOUTH LEAGUE (SYL)

A source advised that the Socialist Youth League (SYL)
began in 1945 when several militant members of the Young
Peoplets Socialist League (YPSL), the youth organization
of the Socialist Party, accepted a proposal that they become
affiliated with the Workers Party. The first issue of the group's
newspaper, "Youth Action for Socialism," in October, 1945,
contained an article which indicated that ",..Only socialism can
answer youth's needs for jobs, peace, education and a fuller
life...Our organization is the only national revolutionary
youth group in America."

The March 1, 1954, issue of the "Young Socialist
Challenge," published as page three of “Labor Action," an
official publication of the Independent Socialist League, con-
tained an article concerning the creation of the Young Socialist
League (YSL) which pointed out that ataunity conference occurring
February 12-14, 1y54, at Labor Action Hall, New York, New York,
@ merger occurred between the YPSL and the SYL. The new
organization was named the YSL..

A second source on June 15, 1954, made available the
minutes of the YSL'ts National Action Committee meeting of
.April 13, 1954, which reflected that one S. Siteman, "Chairman
of SP (Socialist Party) Youth Committee," had objected
to a statement appearing in "Commerce," a New York University
journal, which indicated that the YPSL merged with the SYL to
form the YSL. He explained that the YPSL did not merge with
anyone, that it continued to exist as the youth section of
the Socialist Party. He explained that a small group of the YPSL
was dropped, expelled, or suspended from that organization
and joined the SYL, which he characterized as the youth group
of the "Trotskyite ISL." He explained that after these few
former members of the YPSL joined the SYL, the SYL then proceeded
to change its name for its own purposes.

which pointed out that at a unity conference occuring February
12-14, 1954, at Labor Action Hall, New York, New York, a merger
occurred between the Young People's Socialist League (YPSL) and
the Socialist Youth League (SYL). The new organization was
named the YSL.

- On June 15, 1954, a source made available the minutes
of the YSL's National Action Committee meeting of April 13, 1954,
which reflected that one S. Siteman, "Chairman of SP (Socialist
Party) Youth Committee," had objected.to a statement appearing
in "Commerce," a New York University journal, which indicated
that the YPSL merged with the SYL to form the YSL. He explained
that the YPSL did not merge with anyone, that it continued ‘to
exist as the youth section of the Socialist Party. He explained
that a small group of the YPSL was dropped, expelled, or
suspended from that organization and joined the SYL, which he
characterized as the youth group of the "Trotskyite ISL". -He
explained that after these few former members of the YPSL joined
, the SYL, the SYL then proceeded to change its name for its own
purposes,

On April 9, 1956, a second source advised that the YSL
has frequently worked in close sympathetic cooperation with the
ISL toward similar objectives, although each major issue given
mutual consideration is decided upon by these organizations
individually. The YSL serves as an apprenticeship for the
ISL, but ISL selection of members from YSL ranks is made on
an individual and personal basis. In may instances YSL members
are also members of.the ISL, The YSL and the ISL utilize the
Same printing house in New York City and the YSL publication is
printed as an insert in "Labor Action." Frequently, lecturers
before the YSL are ISL members.

The September 22, 1958, issue of "Young Socialist
Challenge", which appeared as page five of ‘Labor Action,"

WORKERS WORLD PARTY

On April 17, 1959, a confidential source advised
| that on February 12, 1959, a Socialist Workers Party (SWP)
minority group, under the leadership of National

Committee member, SAM BALLAN, split from the SwWP.

fo

The source stated that this minority group,
referred to as the Marcyites, after many years of program and
policy differences on varied issues concerning tactics and inter-
pretation of political events, split from the SWP on the
grounds that the Party was liquidating itself by
departing from the Marxist precepts of LEON TROTSKY and
retreating from the fight for the world socialist revolution,
The final issue which ultimately forced the split was the
minority's opposition to the SWP regroupment policy which
involved cooperation with the Communist Party (CP)
periphery - individuals characterized by the minority as
petty - bourgenis.

SSS ESAS TN

The minority program, according to the source,
advocates unconditional defense of the Soviet Union and
has as its goal the building of a revolutionary party

Although statements of the leaders of organization:

10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., plus facts reported by our sources dice

Apparent through the lack of coordination existing
between the National Association for, the Advancement of Colored
People (NAACP) and the Congress of! Racial Equality (CORE), the ~
oftentimes divergent vertebrae ‘providing principal support to
racial demonstrations; ‘ is the possibility that‘since organizations
sponsoring the march on Washington many times have not presented
a unified front on a;local -basis, it will be even more difficult.
for the march leaders to establist“a cohesive operation on a i
nation-wide basis. For example, information received 7/24/63 from
our Little Rock sources specifically pointed up such a situation
when the CORE representative issued statements concerning an
"ultimatum" which was going to be forthcoming if racial conditions
were not improved while NAACP leaders in the area separated

Memorandum to Mr, Belmont
RE: MARCH ON WASHINGTON

Our source at a principal focal point of ra¢ial”
activity, Albany, Georgia, indicated exhortations were being
nade to recruit marchers on a pay-your-way basis. Although
local authorities have been gravely beset with demonstration__
problems, by the same token demonstrators have experienced
a drain on funds and energies which may have developed a
recruiting problem.

- All divisions have been ordered to alert Klan and hate
informants, racial informants, and other sources to obtain specific
details concerning the formation of delegates, mode of travel,

and other pertinent details. All divisions have likewise been
instructed to maintain close liaison with security informants

for information as to possible participation of subversive
organizations. Each SAC has been impressed with the fact this

is a personal and continuing responsibility.

The Domestic Intelligence Division has learned that an
official of the Communist Party USA at a meeting of functionaries |
held 7/11/63 stated the party should finance people to attend the
march on Washington, although no formal organization exists along
these lines. The possibility of communist participation has
been furnished to the Civil Rights Division and the Internal
Security Division of the Department by Domestic Intelligence.
Any further developments along this line will be made known
immediately to interested divisions of the Department and other
appropriate agencies. :

7 The assurance of orderly activity given by demonstration
leaders is complemented by recognition of their right to demonstrate

Memorandum to Mr. Belmont
RE: MARCH ON WASHINGTON

The Laboratory Division is alerted personnel~wise
and equipment-wise as to the special needs for photographic
coverage and other possible demands for urgent laboratory
examinations as well as communication needs -of-the Washington
Field Office and has coordinated this matter with Washington

The Special Investigative Division, which occupies
first floor space in close proximity to the public entrances
and public corridors, has especially alerted all employees
to the need for the utmost discretion in their conduct both
in and out of the building, the need for security precautions,
and the desirability of remaining away from windows and
continuing in their normal duties during any demonstration
which might occur. Pursuant to my memorandum of 7/19/63 all
other divisions also have been alerted to emphasize to all
employees the need to be most circumspect in conduct in and
out of the building ud to re~emphasiace cur security precautions
which are always in effect.

As previously indicated Washington Field Office is

of events which may take place, and pursuant to my memorandum

of 7/19/63 Supervisor Joseph C. Trainor, Room 2266, is correlating
information concerning the demonstration at the Seat of
Government.

The suggestion of the Laboratory Division that some
“Seat of Government Kureau automobiles should be dispersed away
from the building so that any bottling up may be prevented has
been referred ta the Administrative Division for consideration.

As a matter of information, WFO has advised the cars
‘of the Washington Field Office will be operated out of the
usual storage facilities, located out of the proposed
demonstration area, and controlled from the investigative
headquarters of the field office, being deployed as the need

for coverage develops in the event of a dex .

Memorandum to Mr. Belmont
RE: MARCH ON WASHINGTON

The Administrative Division, in addition to
alerting all employees, has noted the possibility that
a larger -than-usual number of eee ae: for Bureau

and the presence of Special rar Supervisors to conduct
applicant interviews called for.

The Administrative Division has also been in
contact with the Superintendent of the Generali Services
Administration Protection Branch for the Justice Building
which has advised that maximum available guard force will
be arranged for August 28 through adjusting reporting hours, “
changing days off and in some cases cancelling annual leave
of guards. Superintendent of the Protection Branch has
advised that if developments appear to warrant it, con-
sideration will be given to closing all entramces of the
Justice Building with the exception of the Ninth Street
and Pennsylvania Avenue entrance and the Tenti Street
automobile entrance, both of which are patrolled by guards.

The Inspection Division has alerted all personnel
with reference.to security precautions and comduct and is went
submitting a separate memorandum to that effect.

Although separate memoranda are not being submitted
at this time by divisions other than those named above, the
following action has been taken by these divisions as of
lene 29, 1963,

The Identification Division, although housed in a
building to which the public is not generally admitted, has
arranged to establish extra security patrols on each entrance,
In addition, Special Agent Supervisors will be stationed in the
vicinity of entrances during the duration of the demonstration.
However, so as to avoid generating a premature wave of alarm
among clerical employees of the Identificatim: Division,
actual discussions of special security precautions will be
withheld until a later date.

The Training Division has, in addition to alerting
employees, instituted considerations as to whether a possible

On April 17, 1959, a source advised that on February
12, 1959, a Socialist Workers Party (SWP) minority group,
under the leadership of National Committee member, SAM BALLAN,
split from the SWP. : if

: The source stated that this minority group, referred
to as ‘the Marcyites,-after-many-years-of program and -policy...
differences on varied issues concerning tactics and interpre-
tation of political events, split from the SWP on the grounds
that the Party was liquidating itself by departing from the
Marxist precepts of LEON TROTSKY and retreating from the fight
for the world socialist. revolution. The final issue which
ultimately forced the split was the minority's opposition to
the SWP regroupment policy which involved cooperation with the
Communist Party (CP) periphery + individuals characterized by
the minority as petty-pourgeois..

ane The minority program, according to the source, advo-

eates unconditional defense of the Soviet Union and has as its
goal the building of a revolutionary party with a complete
proletarian orientation for the purpose of overthrowing capi-
talism in the United States and throughout the world.

: On May 12, 1960, the source advised that tiits minority
group had chosen the name Workers World Party. . . :

On April 18, 1962, the source stated that the head-
quarters of the Workers World Party were- located at 46 West
‘2Qlst Street, New York, New York. :

The SWP and the CP have been designated by the
Attorney General of the United States pursuant to Executive
Qrder 10450. : ;

WOMEN’S PEACE AND UNITY CLUB,
Formerly known as the
Chicago Woxen for Peace

: The aims and purposes of the Chicago Women for Peace
“(CWP) as set forth in its self-identified publication; ‘Chicago
Acts for Peace” (CAP), May, 1951, issue, deseribes this organi-
zation as a “service center for wonen ‘working for peace." This
publication described the CWP as being affiliated with the
American Women for Peace amd as cooperating with the American
Peace Crusade (APC).

The January, 1954, issue of "CAP" announced the dis-
. Solution of the American Women for Peace and the affiliation
) of the CWP with the APC Council in Chicago.

A source advised in November, 1956, that the CWP) ~-
vemained affiliated with the APC, Chicago, until that organiza-
tion dissolved in September, 1955. The CWP continued with no F
National affiliation -unmtil Ssptexber, 1956, thon 2 “reorganiza Hi
tion and name change took place,” amd it became known as the H
"Women’s Peace and Unity Club” (WPUC);, The reason given for this i
“reorganization and name change” by DOROTHY HAYES, Secretary of i
the organization at that time, was that the CWP had been formed_
to end the Korean War,and since that war was over and there was
a “measure of peace im the world," women’s interests were more
centered on such issues as civil rights, desegregated and better
schools, juvenile delinquency, equal opportunities for women,
housing, and cost of living. Source advised that the only actual
“reorganization” of the CWP was the change of its name to "Women’s
Peace and Unity Club.”

A second source advised in October, '1956, that the
Communist Party (CP), Illinois-Indiana District, had ordered the
dissolution of the CWP because it no longer served the purpose
of the Party since it was a "left-wing" peace group. Though the te
CWP refused to dissolve and chose to continue in the form of 7
the "Womens Peace and Unity Club,” it continues to be a "communist
front organization" whose policies and activities are directed
by CP members, . :

A third source advised on May 14, 1963, that the WPUC,
as of that date, continued to operate in the Chicago area as a
peace organization under the direction and ccontrolcof CP members
and its objectives continued to be the same.

ree The American Women for Peace and the APC have been
eee designated pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

february 12, 1959, a Socialist Workers_Party.(SWP) minority —_-_—— +
group, under the leadership of national committee member SAM
BALLAN, known in the SWP as SAM MARCY, split from the SWP.

The source stated that this minority group
referred to as the Marcyites, after many years of program
and policy differences on varied issues concerning tactics
and interpretation of political events, split from the
SWP on the grounds that the Party was liquidating itself
by departing from the Marxist precepts of LEON TROTSKY
and retreating from the fight for the world socialist
revolution. The final issue which ultimately forced the
split was the minority's opposition to the SWP regroupment
policy waich involved cooperation with the Communist Party
(CP). periphery - individuals .characterized by. the minority. -.
as petty~bourgeois.

The minority program, according to the source,
advocates the unconditional defense of the Soviet Union and __
has as its goal the building of a revolutionary party with a
-complete proletarian orientation for the purpose of over-
throwing capitalism in the United States and throughout
the world.

On May 12, 1960, the source advised that this
minority group had chosen the name Workers World Party with
headquarters located at 46 West 2ist Street, New York,

New York.

The SWP has been designated pursuant to Executive
Order 10450.

MARCH ON WASHINGTON
August 28, 1963

SL T-1 advised on August 9, 1963 that the headquarters of
the Negro Américan Labor Council (NALC) in New York City was sending
to the St. Louis area approximately 8,000 leaflets and 500 three to
four page booklets pertaining to the itarch on Washington, These
were for dissemination among people possibly interested, however,
none of them'have arrived as yet, This source stated that other
organizations in the St. Louis area were being invited to partici-
pate in the march and these organizations included integrationist
organizations, labor and social organizations, Source stated that
attempts are being made &t this time to raise funds to finance-the
trip to Washington inasmuch as it had been ascertained that the
chartering of a bus would cost. approximately $800.00 or more from . 7
St. Louis, This source said no bus had yet been chartered inasmuch
. @8 personnel willing to go are lacking.

This source also stated that the ‘plans call for the ~
hiring of a Greyhound Bus which would take the group to Washington,
D.C., where they would remain during the daytime only and immediately
return with no stopover, ‘The source stated that there was.a feeling
among NALC leaders that the Committee on Racial Equality (CORE)
was attempting to take over a part of this march and this was -
resented on the part .of NALC officials, This source reiterated
that there is no enthusiasm in’St.' Louis for this trip. He knew
of no one who was going.

SL T-2 advised on August 8, 1963 it was his opinion there
would be a very small representation from the St. Louis-area in
view of the great distance to Washingt on, D.C. and the cost

involved. SL T-2 advised that he felt attempts were being made
to make the trip a peaceful one in every respect and that at least
from the St. Louis area there was a feeling that any demonstration
in Washington which might take place might center around the i
: United States Senate inasmuch as it was felt the greatest Bree let arr
with civil rights legislation and civil rights matters was
‘encountered in the Senate of the United States rather than any ‘
other branch of the Government. This source knew of no one who i
was making the trip. : : k
i
i

SL T~3 advised that to his knowledge no one was going
from the St,’ Louis area on the Washington, D.C. trip-on August 28, a
1963 and he felt the reason for this was the cost involved especially
as it applies to those who might make the trip not being financially :
able to do so.

SL T-4- ‘advised on August 8, 1963 that it was his under-
standing nearly forty people had expressed an interest in making
“the trip to Washington, D2C.+, and that this number would be one
bus load. This source stated that it is his understanding there
would be three drivers onthe one bus in order that the bus would
not make a stop en route to Washington or on.the return trip, This
.was .to avoid the possibility of incident, This source stated_that
the, bus, which would be Greyhound, would not be in Washington, D.C,
more than twelve hours and it was anticipated no problems en route
except possibly in the immediate suburban area around Washington, i

On August 9, 1963, SL T-5 advised’ that Ow utz, whom uy
the informant described as a member ‘of the Freedom of the Press :
Committee (characterized in the attached appendix), stated that fe

ad" attempted to contribute to the National Association for the
rrenabied of Colored People (NAACP), St. Louis, Missouri
sufficient money for the transportation of Dolores“Richardson
for the trip on August 28, 1963. This source described Dolores
Richardson on August ae 1963 asa member of the a Party,
St. Louis, Missouri.’ as peiee

SL T-5 also advised at this time that ae Lutz copii
refused by the NAACP din his offer for a contribution to have
Dolores Richardson go, The source said that the bide had advised

RE: MARCH ON WASHINGTON CONBEDENEIAT

Lutz that they would not take his “money nor would they permit
Dolores Richardson ‘to make the trip under any circumstances
in view of the fact that she was a woman of loose morals and
one whose character was no good and could only bring discredit

a upon the NAACP, This source knew of no one who was making the
trip to Washington, D.C.

SL T-6 advised on August 8 and 9, 1963 from information
available to him even though there have been two inquiries made
regarding bus transportation to Washington, D,.C., no plans have
yet been made to actually charter or reserve a bus to go to.
Washington, D.C, from the St, Louis area, This source advised
that it was his understanding inquiry has also been made in
Kansas City, Missouri regarding the chartering or:reserving of
a bus to leave from Kansas City, Missouri and a second bus to
leave from Kansas:City, Kansas for Washington, D.C. on August 28,
1963. This sourcé advised that only inquiries have been made and
no actual reservations, The source stated that the cost of
chartering a bus would be somewhere between $800.00 and $900.00
and that no bus could be reserved until this money were actually
deposited, This source also advised that if a Greyhound Bus were
chartered for the occasion, the bus would go non-stop from St, Louis
to Washington, D,C., and non-stop return and takes approximately
24 hours for the trip one way. This source stated that the oniy
Stops the bus would make would be for rest periods and food and
the food facilities where the bus would stop would only be those
utilized by Greyhound, This source also advised on August 9, 1963
that unless a bus were reserved or chartered about ten days before
August 28, 1963, it would be very difficult to charter one after
that time for the 28th.

concentrated in various front organizations of which the
Freedom of the Press Committee was one.

In May, 1963, a source advised that the Freedom of
the Press Committee is one of the front organizations in the
St. Louis area in which the activity of the Communist Party is
concentrated; that the Committee's purpose continues to be
distribution of “The Worker"; and that the organization has
beén continuously under the complete control and domination
of the Communist Party in the St, Louis, Missouri anea since

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTER © :

The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York Times”
newspaper contained a Pullepage advertisement captioned “what
Is Reaily Happening In Cuba," placed by the Fair Play for Cuba ;
Committes (FPCC), This advertisement announeed the formation
of the FFCC in New York clvy and declared the FPCC intended to
promuigsts "the truth abouS revolutionary Cuba" to neutralize
the distorted American presse

"The New York Times" edition of January 11, 1961,
reportsd that at a hear ing conducted before the United States
Senate Internsl Seew Subcommittee on January 10, 1961, Dr.
Charles A. Santos~Buch identified himself and Robert Taber as ,
organizers cf the FPCO, Hs giso testified he and Taber obtained
funds from the Cuban Government which were applied toward the
cost cf the afcreementioned advert

On May. 16, 1963, a source advised that during the :
first two years of the FPCC!s existence there was a struggle between
Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers Party (SWP) elements to
exert -their power within the FPCC and thereby influence FPCC policy.
However, during the past year this source observed there has been a
-successfn) affort hy FPCC.jeadership to minimize the role of these ]
and other organizations in the FPCC so that today their influence
in negligible.

On May 20, 1963, a second source advised that the
National Headquarters of the FPCC is located in Room 329 at 799
Broadway, New York City. According to this source, the position
of National Office Director was created in the Fall of 1962 and
