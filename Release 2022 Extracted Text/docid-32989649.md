This memorandum is being prepared pursuant to your instructions

following a call to your office by Mr. Edwin Guthman of the Department late

yesterday afternoon.

Mr. Guthman advised that the Metropolitan Police Department

regularly receives requests for press passes from newspapers throughout the

country so that their representatives may cover special events in Washington.

* He said that the practice of the Metropolitan Police Department

in regard to these requests is to have Mr. Ben Gilbert, one of the editors of the

Washington Post, screen the names submitted to the police to make certain that

sisy are not objectionable and are acceptable to the Washington Press Corps.

Mr. Guthman said that in connection with the 8/28/63 march on

Washington the police have received a letter signed by Eric Bert, managing editor

of "The Worker" in New York, requesting passes for several individuals allegedly

attiliated with the paper. This request was turned over by the police in- accordance

With their usual custom to Gilbert who in turn called Guthman to ascertain if it

was satisfactory with the Department for such passes to be issued. In connection

with these passes it is noted that the holders of such are allowed to cross streets,

police lines

i, and are given other courtesies normally afforded other working pres.

and not to the general public.

M. A. Jones to Mr. DeLoach Memo

RE: AUGUST 28TH MARCH ON WASHINGTON .

All of these individuals, of course, are well-known communist

officials and we have prepared a brief resume as to their identity and background.

This is attached.

This attached data regarding these individuals has been furnished

-to-Guthman by your office.-Mr.-Guthman has further been told that as far as

the FBl is concerned we can see no reason why they should have the requested press

passes or be furnished any other courtesies. It was pointed out to Guthman that

the Communist Party, its officials and its members have defied the Attorney

General and the United States courts by refusing to register as directed under

the Subversive Activities Control Act. It was also stressed to Guthman emphatically,

however, that a final determination as to any action must be made by the Department.

Racial Matters

The "Morning Freiheit" in its issue of August 18, 1963,

page 1, columns 1 - 3, continued on page 4; column 3, reported

that the Reform Rabbis, who are affiliated with the Union of American

Hebrew Congregations and the Central Conference of American Rabbis,

urged the members of their congregations to exert all their efforts

to help the Negroes in their struggle for civil rights. It was

stated that these two organizations represent 650 Reform Temples in

the United States and their appeal was directed to over a million

members of these Temples.

In their appeal the Rabbis called for the boycotting of all

= companies, banks and businesses which practice discrimination against

the Negroes and urged participation in the march to washington on

August 28th.

According to instant article, the spokesmen for the Reform

Rabbis at a press

conference which was held on August 15, 1963, at

the

"House of Living Judaism," 838 Fifth Avenue, New YArk City,

declared that in the march to Washington hundreds of Rabbis will

participate and they will carry signs with quotes from the Torah

which condemns the curse of race hatred and discrimination.

A characterization of the

"Morning Freiheit" is

attached.

advised on August 19, 1963, that there have been no

definite commitments made by any group to reserve buses

for the purpose of attending the August 28, 1963, March

he received a

telephone call from (FNJ) Christon who said

he was with the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), in-

quiring as to the possibility of reserving a bus to be

used by a group, believed to be CORE, to go to Washington,

D. C. He inquired as to prices and time scheáules but

made no definite commitment.

reliable information in the past and who is familiar with

the activities of CORE, advised that CORE and the National

Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)

have not reserved any buses to be used to transport people

to Washington, D. C. He advised that at the present time

the number of special railroad cars to be used to trans-

port people to Washington is not known at this time, but

that these cars will be moved from Miami through Florida

on a regularly scheduled train of the Atlantic Coast Line.

Source I advised that A. D. Moore, Head of Miami

Chapter of CORE, spoke to a group of people at the Jewish

WORKERS WORLD PARTY

On April 17, 1959, a source advised that on

February 12, 1959, a Socialist Workers Party (SWP) minority

group under the leadership of National Committee member,

SAM BALIAN, split from the SWP.

The source stated that this minority group, referred

to as the Marcyites, after many years of program and

policy

differences on varied issues concerning tactics and interpreta-

tion of political events, split from the SWP on the grounds that

the Party was liquidating itself by departing from the Marxist

precepts of LEON TROISKY. and retreating from the fight for the

world

socialist revolution. The final issue which ultimately

forcea the split was the minority's opposition to the SWP

regroupment policy which involved cooperation with-the Communist

Party (CP) periphery - individuals characterized by the minority

as petty - bourgeois.

The minority program, according to the source, advo-

cates unconditional defense of

the Soviet Union and has

as its

goal the building of a revolutionary party with a complete

proletarian orientation for the purpose of overthrowing capitalism

in the United States and throughout the world.

On May 12, 1962, the source advised that this minority

group had chosen the name Workers World Party:

On April 18, 1962, the source stated that the head-

quarters of the workers World Party were located at 46 West 21st

Street, New York, New York.

The SWP and the CP have been designated by the Attorney

General of the United States pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

SYNOPSIS

the March on Washington scheduled for August 28,

1963, which has created nationwide interest, is being actively

supported by various legitimate nonsubversive religious,

fraternal, civil and labor organizations.

Current information developed as a result of our

Investigation of the Communist Party (CP), USA, activities

does not indicate that this event was actually

lor is controlled by the CP. However, it is pertinent to

note that when Martin Luther King, Jr., one of the leaders

NY

of the March, first conceived the

idea of organizing the

narch on Washington, he discussed the matter with stanley David

Levison, a concealed CP member, and sought Levison's advice as

to whether the time was right for such a move.

Levison agreed

"The time is now." The fact that King consulted Levison

assumes additional significance in the light of information

He received from a source who has furnished reliable infor-

mation in the past to the effect that in May, 19g2, a national

functionary of the CPUSA commented that Stanley evison, by

reason of his association with the Martin Luther King movement,

was doing the most important work in the variy at that time.

With respect to Levison's Party connection, we received

information in June, 1963, that although he still has strong

communist convictions and

still acts as an effective Party

advisor to King, he has become critical of the Party's role -

in the civil rights movement. Levison said he does not

consider himseli to be under

the control of the Party with

respect to his dealings with King.

The Party is actively supporting the March, in

spite of its awareness of a public statement by leaders

of the March that they did not want "any communists."

support of the march is manifested by endorsement of the

March in the communist press to foster the illusion that

the CP is a humanitarian group acting in the interest of

the Negro, and by Party leadership urging rank-and-file

CP members to clandestinely participate in the March.

This clandestine participation is a Party tactic which

is apparently being used in order not to alienate the

organizations sponsoring the March since the Party views

this event as a golden opportunity to reach a growing

powerful mass movement for Negro civil'rights.

The Party plans to distribute openly its literature,

including 10,000 copies of a planned special edition of "The

Worker," east coast communist newspaper, to March participants

NW 68262 Docld:32989649 Page 124

---

## Page 125

in various locations outside of Washington, D. C.

In addi-

tion, the Party hopes to sell 10,000 of its pamphlets. No

distribution of Party literature

is planned in Washington,

D. Co, in deference to public announcements by leaders of

the March that there is to be no literature of any type

distributed in Washington during the March.

Coverage of communist activity in connection with

the March is planned at present through six Bureau security.

informants who are coming to the March with local groups.

American communists in Mexico are supporting the

March, including the collection of funds for the purpose of

sending telegrams to March on Washington headquarters.

Endorsement of the March has been announced by the

socialist Norkers Party (SWP.) (cited as subversive under

Executive Order 10450) and instructions calling for partici-

pation have been issued by the workers worla Party (WNP), a

splinter group of the SWP. No information has been received

to indicate that Elijah Muhammad, leader of Nation of Islam

US

march as individuals.

CP leaders have stressed the fact that the March

is not the be all and end all in itself.

Events which sub-

sequently flow from the March will be of utmost importance,

such as following up on contacts now being made by CP members

working in support of the demonstration.

Utilizing the

March, the Party has three basic general objectives:

(1) Participation by CP members through legitimate

organizations.

(2) Attempt to get the Party line into the hands of

sympathizers and supporters of the March through

distribution of "The Worker" and Party pamphlets.

(3) Utilize the March as a steppingstone for, future

Party activity through contacts now being made

by Party members involved in the March.

It remains to be seen to what extent the Party will

be successful in translating its efforts stated above into

concrete results.

DETAILS

Utilization of the March to Further Aims of the Communist Party

The March on Washington scheduled for August 28,

1963, is an event which has created national interest and' is

vh30h ashington

being supported by such nonsubversive organizations as the

American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees,

Catholic Interracial Council, State Association of the Elks

and the Greater Philadelphia Council of Churches.

The

Communist Party (CP), USA, although it did not initiate nor is

it controlling the Harch,

is using this event for the purpose

of promoting its own interest.

It is pertinent to note here, however, the conversa-

tion Martin Luther King, Jr., one of the March leaders, had

with Stanley David Levison, a secret member of the Party, on

1 June 1, 1963.

It is known to us that Levison and King have

foeed in contact with each other since December, 1956. As

early as September, 1958, Levison was descrived as one of king's

chiet assistants who spent considerable time advising and

helping king At one time, Levison and his brother, who is

Known as Roy Bennett, were

organizers for the CP In

New York.

N

They are both currently known as secret members of the

ie "Party"

and in past years Levison and his brother, Roy Bennett, both

have been heavy linancial contributors to the CP.

During the

,afore-mentioned conversation,

King commented he had never seen

the Negro community as aroused, as determined, and as enthusi-

astic as at that time.

of a significant breakthrough and the greatest weapon is mass

demonstration." King added "We are at the point where we can

mobilize all of this righteous indignation into a powerful mass

movement." King suggested that there be a mass march of literally

thousands and thousands of people on Washington. King said that

even the threat of such a march might so frighten the President

that he would have to do something. He asked Levison "Are we

ready for that."

In reply, Levison said two things would have

to be considered: (1) There would have to be unanimity among

all groups.

(2) Would more pressure be generated on Washington

by a series of local situations rather than by one mass march

on Washington. King answered at length and was in favor of one

mass march.

He said he envisioned such an event would create

such an impact that "something would have to give." He again

asked Levison if the time was right for such a move. Levison

then agreed "The time is now."

Clarence Jones, Acting Executive Director Of

the Gandhi society for Human Rights, who was a participant

In the conversation

suggested that King discuss his

proposal with Roy Wilkins, Executive Secretary, NAACP, and

A. Philip Randolph, President of the International Brother-

hood of

Sleeping Car Porters, before any announcement is

made publicly concerning a mass march on Washington.

that point,

King suggested that either Levison or Jones

see A. Philip Randolph and

that a statement be worked out

along the lines of the new militancy throughout the

country.

During the discussion, it was indicated that.

Clarence Jones had attended a meeting at which the

National Council of Churches had expressed an interest in

King's direct action approach.

Levison asked Jones whether

It would be possible to quote individuals without mention-

ing names who had attended the meeting as "this is new

when white church leadership is looking for something in

the way of direct action." Levison said this would give

it the biggest, broadest front ever as "you can see the

effect of Negroes joined by the National Council of Churches

and not just Negro churches."

The significance of this

conversation is apparent when consideration is given to the

fact that when King first was considering a march on

• Washington, he discussed it in detail with his contact in

the CP and sought the advice of this communist as to whether

the time was right for such a march. Additional significance

can be attached to this. conversation: in the light of

Information we received from a source who has furnished

reliable information in the past to the effect that in

May, 1962, a national functionary of the CPUSA commented

that Stanley Levison, by reason of his association with the

Martin Luther king movement, was doing the most important

work in the Party at that time.

Information received in

June, 1963, indicated that while Levison still retains his

strong communist convictions and still acts as an effective

Party advisor to King, he is becoming critical of the Party's

role in the relationship. He believes the Party has lost

prestige among Negroes lately because it has not been

sufficiently aggressive and effective in promoting civil

rights for the Negro and otherwise immersing itself in

Negro causes. Levison said he does not consider himself to be

under the control of the Party with respect to his dealings

with King.

Ito build up friends with the objective of bringing them

The possibilities inherent in this March as seer

by the Party are indicated in a statement made by Gus Hall,

C? Corora? Sacretary, in speaking to approximately 70

communists or communist sympathizers in Philadelphia,

D. C

N

Pennsylvania, on July 31, 1963.

He described the March as

an indication of a peaceful transition toward socialism and,

according to Hall, it is imperative that as many white

people as possible participate.

On August 2, 1963, Hall

commented that the Party should not give the appearance that

it is "taking over." (Along this line, Party leaders in

, early August, 1963, urged rank-and-file CP members to

clandestinely participate in the March through legitimate

organizations.)

At a meeting of leading CP functionaries, New York

City, August 14, 1963,

PhilXBart, CP National Organizatior

secretary, stated that there never has been a comparable figure

in the past wherein hundreds of communists will actually be

together with tens of thousands of others, as will take place

in the March. Bart called for efforts to work with the idea

of, establishing connection with this new force. At this same

meeting, Joseph Brandt, CP national functionary

commented that

the Party has blended itself into this "movement" and,

because persons in the March will be listening to our

people,

the question now arises as to what can be done with these

people after the March.

From information we have received, it is apparent.

the Party anticipates that participation by its members in

this event, which it feels is of great historical significance,

will subsequently be used as a vehicle to reach a new massive

force. Association with March sympathizers could well serve

as components of a future picture painted by the Party,

\ featuring itself as the champion of the Negro cause.

Party Program

As early as June, 1963, some semblance of a Party

program began to jell and was outlined in an article appearing

in the June 23, 1962, issue of "The Worker." This article

suggested a program based on a report adopted at a recent

national gathering of communist leauers.

It called for:

(1) direct, mass, peaceful action pursued through the Negro

people and

their organizations; and (2) the support vi white

allies, beginning with organized labor.

Included in the

proposals were the withholding of Federal funds from states -

which deny constitutional rights to its citizens; a petition

to the Supreme Court to set a time limit of January 1, 1964,

; for compliance with its 1954 decision on the desegregation of

public schools; and, if necessary, the federalization of the

State National

Guards.

"TO ALL (CP) DISTRICTS."

(OP)

By July 15, 1963, the Party had Issued two directives

1963, +

One referred to an article in a

recent issue of "The Worker" by James Jackson, which identified

the "Dixiecrat" politicians and the "Northern

Republican ultra-

Rightists" as the enemies of the Negro movement. The "Directive".

urged Party members to order reprints of this article for malling

to influential figures in Negro organizations, trade unions,

fraternal orders and churches.

The other "Directive" urged

Party support of the March, which it described as "an event of

the greatest historic importance."

A).'

At a meeting of leading CP functionaries in

New York City on August 1, 1963, William Albertson, member of

the CP National Board, stated that the Party must show the

special headquarters in Washington, D. C.

(This headquarters

nad not opened as of August 22, 1963.) At this same meeting,

commented that "we" decided that tronal Executive Committee,

will participate in the

pressure groups from New Jersey, Philadelphia and Baltimore.

morning of August 28, 1963, for Washington. The bus was

chartered by an unidentifted group.

In Philadelphia,

the/Independent Citizons Committee

(ICC), which was initiated and founded by the CP of Eastern

Pennsylvania and Delaware in October, 1962, decided on July 22,

1963, that it would take up the task of contacting people who

would not be contacted by the National Association for the

Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and CORE. The ICC pledged

two bus loads.

set up in Philadelphia by the Socialist Youth Union

The Ad Hoc Committee, concerntns the March (Slick was

July, 1963, the Philadelpia affillate or the Progressive Youth

Organizing Committee (PYOC), is now known as

the Philadelphia

Youth Committee for Jobs and Freedom March."

/ The PYOC was

formed under the direction of the CPUSA", January, 1961, for the

purpose of establishing a national youth group.

The SyU expects

to fill three buses.

mich

In Detroit on July 17, 1963, Cart Winter, CP function-

ary advised that the Party is not happy with President Kennedy'™

speaking out in favor of the demonstration since this will

insure its peacefulness and diminish CP participation.

In late

July, 1963, William Allan, CP member, Michigan, stated that

every Party club organization should try to recruit for the March

and he hopes to see at least one chartered bus and several car

loads of marchers from the west go to Washington.

In Chicao, Flainois, Claude Lightloat, Chat man ofT

the CP in Illinois and a National Vice-Chairman, stated in early

August, 1963, that the CP of Illinois is attempting to get 500*

white persons to go to Washington.

In Los Angeles, California, at a meeting of the

Jewish Commission, Southern California District CP (SCDCP),

on August 5, 1963, a recommendation was made for the SCDCP

to send a representative to Washington on August 28. Ber Dobbs,

Executive Secretary, SCDCP, had stated on July 30, 1963, that

the SCDCP would not directly support the March by paying

transportation costs due to lack of funds.

The Virginia CP State Executive Committee on July 14,

1963, proposed that work should begin on getting a delegation

to go to Washington as participants or as onlookers.

In Seattle, Washington, the CP leaders of the Central

District Youth Club are attempting to raise money with an

apparent objective to cover expenses of bus transportation for

a group to attend the March.

According to a source, NAACP

leaders in the State of Washington are having nothing to do with

the communists.

•Use of Party Literature

Much attention has been given the use of Party-

literature and

a special edition of "The Worker" is being

planned in connection with the March. Stachel, on August 7,

1963, proposed to leading CP functionaries that "The Worker"

and other literature be distributed to delegations to the

March.

This was accepted but with the qualification that

no distribution would be made during progress of the March.

Louis Weinstock, General Manager of "The Worker," who originally

planned to go to Washington on August 27, 1963, with 1,000

copies of "The Worker" in the trunk of his car, proposed, on

August 14, 1963, that 10,000 copies of "The Worker"' be distrib-

uted at bus and train terminals since there is to be no

astribution in Washington, D. C. He also proposed that 10,000

pamphlets be sold at concentration points on the morning of

August 28, 1963, and the remainder be sold after the demonstration.

Support of March by American Communists in Mexicol

A group of American communists.

in Mexico are working

actively to support the march. They have revived temporarily

a defunct organization known as the league for Defense of

Negroes and have been collecting funds to send telegrams of

encouragement to the Washington headquarters for the March.

Individuals in the group are writing the telegrams and

attempting to secure on them the signatures of well-known

persons in Mexico. To date, they have succeeded in obtaining

the signatures of

a numper of prominent personalities.

molit

Oi Including that of the former Mexican President, Lazaro Cardenas.

Haywood Hall, described as one of the most militant members of

the group, reportedly has left Mexico City already with

intentions of joining the

March, and Albert Maltz, one of the

well-known "Hollywood Ten," reportedly also

plans

to travel to

Washington to take part in the demonstration.

IBI Coverage of CP Participation in March

Six security informants from various offices are

scheduled to attend the March.

These informants have been

Instructed to promptly furnish the Washington Field Office with

all pertinent developments pertaining to communist efforts to

influence the March.

Subversive Connections of Certain Leaders of March

Certain leaders of the March have some subversive

connections.

This has been covered in a separate memorandum,

Scatterday to Rosen, dated August 20, 1963, captioned "March on

rashington, August 28, 1963, Summaries Re Principals Involved,"

Fatapyar which is

Participation of Other Subversive Groups

The Socialist Workers Party (SWP), designated under

Executive Order 10450, at its National Convention in July, 1963,

officially endorsed the March as part of its policy to link

the SWP with the struggle of the Negro people.

The Workers

World Party (WWP) issued instructions that all individuals

attending the forthcoming national WIP conference in

New York City should participate in the March. The WVP split

from the SWP in 1959.

While there may be members of the Nation of Islam

(NOI), an all-Negro, antiwhite cult which seeks separation of

the races, participating in the March as individuals, as of

August 14, 1963, there were no indications that Elijah Muhammad,

the leader of the NOI, planned to be in Washington on that date

or that the NOI planned to participate in the March in any way.

It is anticipated members of the NOI in Washington

may attempt to sell copies of "Muhammad Speaks," NOI newspaper,

during the March.

Evaluation of Party Influence and its Utilization of the March

Realizing that plans for the March on Washington are

obviously being carried on successfully by other organizations,

the Party is making an all-out effort to take advantage of this

opportunity to further its cause.

l objectives:

The Party has three basic

(1)

(2)

(3)

Participation by CP members through legitimate

organizations

Attempt to get the Party line into the hands

of sympathizers and supporters of the March

through distribution of "The

Worker" and

Party pamphlets

Utilize the March as a steppingstone for

future Party activity through contacts now

being made by Party members involved in the

March

It remains to be seen to what extent the Party will

be successful in translating its efforts stated above into

concrete results.

APPENDIX

PROGRESSIVE LABOR MOVEMENT

A source advised on January 15, 1962, that at

a meeting of the MILTON ROSEN faction in Philadelphia,

Pennsylvania, on January 11, 1902, it

was pointed out

that this group was in touch with

Communist Party (CP)

and former CP members in various cities throughout the

United States hoping to convene a National Conference in

the summer of 1962 for the purpose of establishing a

National MARXIST-LENINIST organization.

"The Worker," an East Coast Communist newspaper,

Issue of January 7, 1962, page 10, column 3, reported the

expuLsion of MILION ROSEN, former

Labor Secretary of the

New york state CP, from the CP.

A second source advised on July 2, 1962, that

Progressive Labor groups held a conference in New

York

City, on July 1, 1962,

where MILTON RUSEN acted as chair-

man.

He read a statement at this conference setting forth

their intention to form a new MARXIST-LENINIST party in the

United States. ROSEN stated that a more formal organization

was necessary, one which would provide a framework for all

who wanted to join in a united effort to build an American

vanguard. The functions of this new organization are to

include :

consolidation of all existing forces around

Progressive Labor and organizing additional forces; expand

and improve political activities; win additional forces to

an outlook of MARXISM-LENINISM and increase the open advocacy

of socialism; develop a significant MARXIST-IENINIST program

for the new party; and organize a collective organization of

leaders and members.

A third and fourth source advised in February, 1963,

that this new MARXIST-LENINIST party has not yet been

organized on a formal, basis, but that Progressive Labor

groups had been formed in several localities in line with

proposals of MILTON ROSEN.

The sources advised as of

February, 1963, that the leaders of this group are

referring to it as the Progressive Labor Movement.

MARCH ON WASHINGION

AUGUST 28, 1963

Assistant Attorney General John Douglas telephoned me

last evening.

He said, as we know, he had been assigned by the

Attorney General to assist the Deputy Attorney General in

ESS

coordinating matters for the Department in connection with the

March on Washington scheduled for August 28, 1963.

Mr. Douglas stated that he had become concerned on reading

several memoranda irom the Bureau relating activity on the part of s

Communist Party members in connection with the march. Douglas noted

that he frankly has no idea what action the Department should take

in this regard. Fe said he was, therefore, contacting us for any

advice which we might have.

This matter has been discussed with Assistant Director

Sullivan and we are in accord that great damage would be done to the

cause of the Communist Party if the Negro leaders of the August 28thg

march came out forcefully denouncing the communists and rejecting

their support.

This would be a blow to the Communist Party since

It would forestall later propagandizing of their efforts in support

of the Negroes and the demonstration.

There are leaders in the Marc

on Washington movement who have consistently opposed the communists,

such as, A. Philip Randolph, President of the Negro American Labor -

Council and Roy Wilkins, Executive Secretary of the NAACP.

Public denounciation of the Communist Party by responsibler&

a tread in restonse to your recast and is nod for dissemi-

Negro leaders at the time Immediately preceeding the March on

Washington, when public interest is high,' would undoubtedly result

in nationwide publicity.

Our future ability to investigate the

Communist Party would not in any way be

Reopardized by this action.

ACTION TO BE TAKEN

• EX 104

RE #+ 157-97051037

If you approve, Mr. Douglas will be recontacted

and it

will be suggested to him

that the Department might desire to,

the communists are

trying to do relative to this march, In order

SAM BALLAN, split from the SWP.

The source stated that this minority group, referred

to as the Marcyites, after many years of program and policy

differences on varied issues concerning tactics and interpreta-

tion of political events, split from the SWP on the grounds that

the Party was liquidating itself by departing from the Marxist

precepts of LEON TROTSKY and retreating from the fight for the

world socialist revolution.. The final issue which ultimately

forced the split was the minority!s opposition to the SWP

regroupment policy which involved cooperation with the Communist

Party (CP) periphery - indiviauals charavuerized by the minority

as petty-bourgeois.

-..

The minority program, according to the source, advo

cates unconditional defense of

the Soviet Union and has

as its

goal the building of a revolutionary party with a complete

proletarian orientation for the purpose of overthrowing capitalism

In the United States and throughout the world.

On May 12, 1962, the source advised that this mino ity

group had chosen the name

workers world Party.

on April 10, 1962, the source stated that the head-

quarters of the Workers World Party were located at 46 West 21st

The SWP and the CP have been designated by the Attorney

existence

The Central District Youth Club (CDYC) came into

around the lst of lay, 1963. It originally con-

sisted of about twelve members,

several of whom were

related to EDDIE GIVENS. The membership has grown to more

than thirty-five and has broadened to include young people,

Ior, the most part, who were attracted to it as a result oi

publicity concerning its activities. the majority ot members

have no connection whatsoever with the CP and are not aware

of the fact that CP members are leading the group.

The officers of the CDYC are believed to be EDDIE

GIVENS, Chairman; RAY COOPER, Vice Chairman; and CARLYN KING,

" Secretary

RAy was comeuted on several casions that it

is very difficult for CP leaders to put their program

across to the group because the members of the group lack

political maturity. Activities of the CDYC, therefore, are

often imstigated by the group and followed by the CP leaders.

Some of the activities of the CDYC include art

classes conducted by MARGARET COOPER, who is not a CP member.

' EDDIE GIVENS, RAY COOPER (husband of MARGARET COOPER) and

CARLYN KING are members of the Communist Party.

The purpose of the CDic is to develop the political

awareness of the peopie involved in order to broaden the mass

movement toward Socialism.

Party's latest plans with respect to this March.

Gus Hall, leader of the Communist Party (CP), USA, has

now decided to participate in this March. Hall plans to partic-

ipate quietly and with no publicity.

AS

an example of the Party's

desire to participate in the March under a veil of secrecy, nine

Party functionaries,

headed by James E. Jackson, Editor-in-Chief

of "The Worker,". east coast communist publication, are attempting

to gain accreditation as "press representatives" of "The Worker"

While the majority of these individuals will come from the New York

and Philadelphia areas, individuals in such widely scattered areas

as Buffalo, New York;

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Detroit, Michigan;

Chicago, Illinois; Minneapolis,

of Oregon and Washington; San Francisco and Los Angeles, California;

/ and the New England area plan to attend.

Information received on 8/22 and 23/63 indicates that it

has been rumored among Puerto Rican independentists in New York City.

that the New York Junta of the Nationalist Party of Puerto RiCO

(NPPR) (designated pursuant to Executive Order 10450) desires to

have one of its adherents participate-in the March and to join the

March leaders who will be received by the President.

If successft i,

this adherent, in the presence of the President, would attempt to

create some unspecified type of disturbance to publicize NPPR demands

for a free and independent Puerto Rico. Information concerning the

N°PR has been furnished to the local Secret Service by our Washington

Field Office and was promptly telephoned, to Mr.

SIXTH WORLD YOUTH FESTIVAL

The April 29, 1957, Issue of ""The New Leader,"

a

weekly publication of the American Labor Conference on Inter

national Affairs, pages eight and nine, carried an article

entitled "Moscow's Youth Festival."

The article stated that

communist parties and fronts throughout the world were trying

to bring 30,000 young people to Moscow for the Sixth Festival

of Youth and Students for Peace and Friendship, a biennial

communist charivari which has taken place in Iron Curtain

cities since 1947. The article stated that during the two

weeks of the Festival, the Kremlin would undertake to prove

to thousands of young

people from the free world that the

future belongs to Soviet Communism.

The article concluded by

stating that the few million dollars which the Kremlin and

Its satellite countries were raising for this festival would

probably be one of their cheapest Investments in terms of

political alvidends.

The "Dally Worker," an East Coast Communist newspaper

which ceased publication on

January 13, 1958, issue of May 3,

1957, page two, carried an article concerning the Moscow Sixth

International Youth Festival, which stated that the Festival is

, scheduled to be held in Moscow from July 28, 1957, to August 11,

1957, and that the Russians expect some 35,000 visitors from 120

nations to attend.

In its first issue,

Communist Party (CP)

The CP has been designated by the Attorney

General of the United

States pursuant to

Executive Order 10450.

It is to be noted WF I-10 on August 5, 1963, advised

that Claude Lightfoot recently stated the CP of Illinois is

supporting the March on Washington and is attempting to obtain

persons from Illinois to attend this march.

WE I-10 during August, 1963, identified Claude

Lightfoot as the Chairman of the CP of

Illinois.

It is to bo noted still further that on August 20,

1963, WF T-11 and WF T-12 both reported Elizabeth Gurley

Flynn spoke at a public conference at New York City on

August 19, 1963, on the topic of "The Significance of the

August 28 Freedom March to Washington"

According to informant, Flynn stated the significance

of this march was to dramatize the Negro situation and the

need for legislative action.

Flynn specifically stated the

claim has been made that communists are responsible for and

have control of the march.

She denied that this was true,

stating that the Communist Party has been interested in the

Negro situation long before the planned march to Washington,

D.C., on August 28, 1963.

WF I-8 on May 7, 1962, identified Elizabeth

Gurley Flynn as

the National Chairman of the

CP, USA.

On August 14, 1963, WF T-13 advised that a meeting

of the leading functionaries

of the CP was held at CP head-

quarters in New York City on that date and a discussion was

held between these communist leaders concerning the forthcoming

March on Washington.

RE MARCH ON WASHINGTON, AUGUST 28, 1963

James Lustig, Irom the state of New Jersey in

attendance at this National CP meeting, commented that the

most important aspect of the march itself is that

participating organizations will hold a conference following

the march and what will be decided at this conference will

be as important

as the: march itself.

• Phil Bart, in attendance at this Fational CP

meeting, stated that there has not been a comparable period

in the past wherein hundreds of communists will actually

be together with tens of thousands of others in the march.

He said efforts should be made to work with the idea of

establishing connections with new forces.

WF T-14 on July 25, 1963, advised that a meeting

of the CP was held in Philadelphia,

Pennsylvania, on July 23,

1963. At this meeting Thomas Natried, mentioned there will

be a special issue oi

SEGRET

without receiving the investigative attention 1t required.

Based on information available to your office, the importance

of this meeting and appropriate coverage thereor are obvious:

Your office is well aware that Levison, a secret member of

the Communist Party, gravitated to King, a recognized leader

of and spokesman for millions of Negroes, some time ago.

Levison has applied dedication to the communist cause by

expending prodigious efforts in King's behalf. This has

reached the point were king now consults with and depende

on Levison for guidance.

King has recently adopted the pro

cautionary neasure of avoiding direct contact with Levison

and instead consults with hin by using Clarence Jones, an

attorney, as an intermediary. ($)

The Bureau considers this to be one of the most

important cases in the New York Office at the present time.

A number of recent communications fron the Bureau have served

to impress upon your office the urgency and importance being

attached by the bureau to all aspects relating to the inves

tigations concerning captioned and related natters.

SAC

Letter 63-50 (1) dated 10/1/63 is but one example of these

communications.

This case should be the responsibility of ASAC Rolley.

23523

Jou are theretore instructed to obtain fron ASAC Roney his

personal explanations as to the reason this meeting was not

covered. His explanations should set forth what quidance he

intends to take to prevent a recurrence of this situation.

In addition, explanations of other responsible

personnel should be obtained

and submitted along with your

personal recommendations as to administrative action.

Vice President Spiro Agnew called. He said he wanted to talk to

rue about sorething to see whether i could be oi so-re assistance. He .

said he was really coneorned about the continuing intlammatory DrO-

nouncements of lalph D. Abernathy. I commented that he is one of the

on hich and he knows what tuat is, but it ta beyond the pale as far as excuave

use is concerned. Me said in view of wiat went on in Aususta and other places, t

it is important to have the information that revoived around this; the involve-

ment of these people, what information we have, whether fleeing from looting

or what is going on.

Ile asked if there is any lafernation available.

I told him we are working on these at the presont timé, koth in

Augusta

Atlanti, and Jacicon, there tre recent demonstrationa have taken

place. I said we have pretty well concluded our investipation at sent • tate

University as to the shooting and, as always hamens, we found a considerable

amount of arcarms in the dormitories and rooma of the students, wiether they

used thom or not is a question; soine day there was sniping and some say there

was notfit said the same is true at racisson as there are allegalions of sising

at the troops before they tired and denials.

We are interviewing all the 1911-

viduala who had any knowledge, students, et cetera.

I said the problem at

Kent was thay closed the university and the studants departed for all parts of

the country, but we finished the preliminary report on that and will nish today

the final report on sent, while at Allant, sunust and racksog, li wall prosably

have a demonstration today and the Guardsies are present, but they have

been blocking Highway No. 1 most every day. I said very fortunately,

they have arrested and charged three of the leaders for the damage done

to the Administration Emilding when they went in the other night and broke

the furniture, et cetera

The Vice President said what he wants to be able to do is bring

out some facts the media conveniently overlooked.

I said they never give

the things that are being done constructively, many times by students, to

try to prevent this, but they erphasize all the things these jeriss are doing.

The Vice President said he saw a pisture about Augista showing

some of the Negroes jumping out of store windows with loot and bocty and

fleeing and you never hear anythiny about that. he said whatever i can cive

hirs that can ameliorate some of the impact; that he understands some of

these things are wrong and me are probably going to find some of the shootings

showed too much force, but none the less, the people have to understand

the very thrust of the newspaper articles is that a bunch of police shot down

six Negroes and what haypened before … why did they shoot at them -- not

just cecause they feit like killing people. I said they were severely provoked

at iealand we will finish Augusta, Atlanta, and Jackson this week.

I told the Vice President I was sending to hiz Fednesday, the

material Kent Crane asked for, which gives in summary the material we

have sent in detaily

The vice President said he thought he was going to bave to start

destroying Abernathy's credibility, so anything I can give him would be

appreciated. I told him I would be glad to. Caaid i was the only one who

spoke out against slartin Luther Ming and 1 got hell, but I did not give a damn

because it is more like bouquete than brickbats froz some people. The

Vice President said we can't iet demagogues become martyrs and teroes.

I said I had bricied the Appropriations Committee about his (Sing's) back-

ground and it has ceen effective recently because they have been trying

Pursuant to the Director's instructions, a speech by

Abernathy, the President of the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference, on 5/18/70 in New York City was covered by the New York

Office. Essential information regarding the speech is included in

the attached letter to the Vice President who requested to be

advised regarding Abernathy's activities.

In connection with the coverage of the speech, it is noted

that the field offices involved, Atlanta and New York, both did ex-

cellent work in learning of the location of the address on short

notice. New York's work was especially noteworthy in securing a

source who was able to cover the meeting. Atlanta was able to

ascertain discreetly that Abernathy was not in Atlanta but was in

New York City to speak before a meeting of Baptist ministers. The

location of the meeting could not be obtained in Atlanta on such

short notice. Although there was no public advertising of the

meeting, New

at 3 PM. New York was able to secure a source who could blend into

this type meeting and equipped him with a recording device to tape

the address.

2 MAY 22 1970

Abernathy, in a highly emotional speech, called for the

unification Of black churchmen in the Ü.S, and for a reexaminatión

of their nonviolent attitude.

He implored them to take a more

positive position in the racial struggle and beseeched them not to

identify themselves with the late Martin Luther King, JI.

as the

nonviolent struggle in the U.S. was dying out.

He cited the recent

shootings in Augusta, Georgia, and Jackson, Mississippi, as reasons

for believing that nonviolence is dying.

He accused Governor Lester

Maddox of Georgia of giving local police, state police, and the

National Guard wholesale authority to slaughter black people.

ACTION: If you approve, attached letter to the Vice President

will be sent. Tape of, speech being reviewed by New York for any

disorder began on the night of 5-13-70 when a crowd of 100 Negro

students, later joined by 600 other persons, including hoodlum-types,

engaged in extensive vandalism and rock throwing at white-occupied

motor vehicles. Disorder erupted again the following night with

numerous reports of sniper fire and attacks on police resulting in

gunfire by the police.

The gunfire left two Negroes dead and ten

others wounded.

Riotous disorder in Augusta, which erupted 5-11-70,

involved sniping, looting, and arson by crowds of rampaging Negroes

and resulted in the deaths of six Negroes before order was restored.

The disturbances in Athens, which occurred on several

days in the latter part of April and early May involved several

RACIAL DISORDER AT

JACKSON STATE COLLEGE,

JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI

MAY, 1970

The Jackson State College, a state-supported

coeducational Negro institution with a student body of

approximately 5,000, is located in the Negro area of

Jackson, Mississippi, about one mile from downtown Jackson.

This college has been the scene of student @sturbances

in past years. In recent months sources of this Bureau

have advised that many students at the school had acquired

firearms and were retaining them in their dormitories. The

Dean of Men reportedly expressed his concern in this regard

to a gathering of students several weeks ago.

On the night of May 13, 1970, a crowd of approximately

100 students, protesting United

States

involvement in Cambodia

and chanting antivite slogans, gathered on Lynch Street,

which intersects the main campus, and threw rocks and bricks

at passing motor vehicles occupied by white persons. One

motorist and one bystander were injured. The crowd subse-

quently increased to about 700 persons, made up mostly of

students. According to a source, a number of black hoodlum-

type youths, many of them "high" on liquor or narcotics,

joined the students in the disorder. Members of the crowd

threw objects at Negro campus police officers and at campus

buildings, causing extensive window damage to dormitories and

classrooms. Numerous pistol shots reportedly were fired into

the air and at some buildings and motor vehicles by mob members.

The disturbance was brought to a halt at about 2 a.II., May 14,

1970, when a combined force of city police officers and

-state troopers entered the campus at the request of the college

-President, John A. Peoples, Jr.

Fourteen persons were arrested,

including

seven students, and all were charged with carrying

concealed weapons.

Racial Disorder at

Jackson State College,

Jackson, Mississippi

May, 1970

Disorder again accurred on the night of

May 14, 1970, when a crovd of about 60 Negroes, including

many nonstudents, assembled near Alexander Hall, a girls'

dormitory which faces Lynch Street. Members of the crowd

renewed their attacks on white-occupied motor vehicles

with rocks and bricks.

A source advised several tavern

owners received anonymous telephone calls at this time

urging them to spread the rumor that Mississippi civil

rights leader Charles Evers and his family had been killed.

By 11:30 p.w. the disorderly crowd had grown to over 200.

A dump truck was set afire and police units moved into

the area to clear the crowd to enable the fire department

to extinguish the blaze.

Police reported that from the time they arrived

in the area they were subjected to abusive language and

became targets for rocks and bottles from the crowd of

Negroes.

Police also reported sniper fire coming from

Stewart Hall, a men's dormitory also Incated on Lynch Street.

A newsman reportedly stated that while Inllowing a fire

truck on foot he heard a volley of shots and was told the

shots were coming from a sniper located between two school

buildings. One officer claimed he heard six small caliber

shots in the area of Stewart Hall at the time the truck

fire was being extinguished.

At about 12:15 a.m., May 15, 1970, a large

contingent of city police officers and state troopers in

riot gear, carrying rifles and shotguns, who had moved

on to the

campus reportedly was approached by a mob of

about 200 students near Alexander Hall. The police fired

three tear gas canisters at the crowd forcing it to retreat.

The crowd, however, again came toward the police line

hurling bottles and other objects, at which time the police

allegedly opened fire. In witnesses stated they heard

the crash

nf a bottle and one small gunshot or firecracker

just before the police fired. One officer reported that

at abnut the same time he saw a muzzle flash in a window

of Alexander Hall and another officer stated he saw a

streak of fire emanate from a top window of another

school building. Police reportedly entered Alexander Hall

where they allegedly fired several shots.

As a result of the gunfire two Negroes, Phillip Gibbs,

age 21, a Jackson State College student, and James Earl Green,

e high school student, died. Ten other Negrnes were wounded,

three critically. Five Negines, as well as three state

troopers and iwo jackson poiice

nificers, suffered other

forms of injuries, minor in nature. •

Two additional arrests of Negroes were made on

the night of May 14, 1970, one being charged with carrying

a concealed weapon and the other for assaulting a police

officer. Property damage in the two nights of disorder

• from vandalism involving extensive window breakage has been

estimated at $8,000 to $10,000. Some windw breakage and

damage to walls was also reported as a result of the gunfire.

A contingent of about 400 National Guardsmen whr

had been on standby in the area aided police in restoring

order shortly after the gunfire had ended. A group of about

100 students went to the residence of the college president

and demanded to see him but upon his refusal, they dispersed

and caused no further disturbance.

RACIAL DISTURBANCE

AUGUSTA, GEORGIA

MAY 11-12, 1970

On May 9, 1970, a 16-year-old Negro male,

Charles Oatman, being held in the Richmond County Jail,

Augusta, Genigia, for the March 31, 1970, gunshot slaying

of his five-year-old niece was beaten to death by two other

Negro juveniles incarcerated in the same cell.

On the evening of May 10, 1970, local authorities

advised that a group of approximately 300 Negroes led by

Negro City Councilman Grady Abrans and a "Committee of Ten,"

a group of local Negro citizens attempting to take a more

active part in heiping Negro juveniles and the poor of

the community, appeared at the County Jail seeking an

explanation of the death.. The demonstrators dispersed

without incident after the Sheriff of Richmond County

furnished an explanation of Oatman's death to the group.

On May 11, 1970, approximately 400 Negroes,

primarily teen-agers, led

by Abrams appeared at the Richmond

County Municipal Building demanding improved conditions

at the Richmond County Jail specifically relating to the

handling of juvenile prisoners. When the Sheriff presented

Abrams and his group with a list of plans worked out with

the Chairman of County Commissioners toward the improvement

of the handling of juvenile prisoners, Abrams appeared

satisfied with the solution.

The local pastor of a Baptist church then spoke

to the crowd stating that they were not there for violence.

He then indicated that it was time for the crowd to disperse.

-While the demonstrators were in front of the Richmond

-County Municipal Building, however, several of them seized

Office furnished the ages of the six Negroes killed

during the rioting: 45 years, 39 years, 28 years,

20 years, 19 years, and 18 years. Police authorities at

Augusta reported that the Negroes were presumably killed

in an exchange of gunfire between snipers and police.

At a meeting se the City Council on May 12, 1970,

the Mayor of Augusta read the following demands made

Negro leaders in Augusta in connection with the riot:

1. Amnesty for all arrestees.

2. Blacks in policy-making positions in city

and county Government.

3. Positive minority hiring practices.

4. Investigation of county and city penal systems.

5. Community relations committee to be set up

with subpoena powers.

black investors along with private industry.

7. Periodic meetings of officials to ascertain

problems and moods of community.

demands under advisement.

During the evening hours of May 12, 1970, local

authorities reported minor isolated sporadic outbursts

of violence in Augusta but there was no organized effort

to repeat the previous night's violence. One 17-year-old

Negro male looter was shot and wounded during the evening

hours of May 12, 1970. At 4:45 a.m. on May 13, 1970, the

Augusta Police Department reported that all was quiet in the

During the evening of April 30, 1970, about 100

Negro youths assembled near a Negro housing development and

MILITANT STATEMENTS MADE BY

RALPH DAVID ABERNATHY,

PRESIDENT OF THE

SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE

Abernathy purports to advocate nonviolence but

has made a number of statements which, while not directly

advocating violence, certainly invite violence. Examples

of these statements

follow.

In May, 1968, at the beginning of the Poor

People's Campaign, a massive march on Washington, D. C.,

sponsored by the

Southern Christian Leadership Conference,

Abernathy told an audience in Atlanta, Georgia, "I don't

want anyone to expect me to be Martin Luther King, JI. I

say to the Nation, to the United States, with Ralph Abernathy

you've got hell on your hands." In the same month in

Birmingham, Alabama, Abernathy said, "Under Doctor King we

were just going. to rock the boat, but under the leadership

of Doctor Ralph Abernathy, I'm going to gor step farther.

We're going to turn this Nation upside-down and right side

up."

In May, 1968, at a speech in Atlanta, Georgia,

Abernathy referred to an unpaid bill for generations of

Irresponsibility, oppression and neglect. He said, "The bill

is going to be collected • willingly or unwillingly, in

civilized decency and love or in fear and hate and the flames

of destruction. Time is not; running out; but rather; time has

run. Öut."

MILITANT STATEMENTS MADE BY RALPH DAVID ABERNATHY,

PRESIDENT OF THE SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE

According to the Chicago Tribune August 30, 1968,

Abernathy addressed 3,000 peace demonstrators in Grant Park,

Chicago, Illinois, on August 29, 1968, during the time the

Democratic Convention was being

held in Chicago. He referred

to police officers as "pigs" as black extremists regularly

do and said that nothing was taking place on the Convention

£100r.

He then added, "But the Lord knows It.ts happening here,

and more will take place because we are going to sock it

to 'em, baby," referring to clashes which had already occurred

between demonstrators and police.

In May, 1969, apparently angered at what he

considered a poor reception received by his poor people's

delegation from the Nixon Administration, Abernathy said time

was running out on nonviolence as an approach to solving the

Nation's problems. He said, "I do not Inowchow muulilonger.

nonviolence can be effective in this country. If the Nation

fails to display some consideration (for the people), then I

tremble for my America." He added that if the lllter Administration

fails to hear nonviolent voices, then they will have to listen

to violent voices.

In September, 1969, while speaking in Atlanta,

Georgia, Abernathy said the country is "on the verge of political

repression and possibly even bloody revolution." He warned

that "there is a limit to people's endurance of injustice and

America 1s rapidly approaching that limit."

On August 13, 1969, Abernathy emphatically embraced

and endorsed a plan for counseling young men to refuse to be

drafted into military service. The plan was presented to the

Annual Convention of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference

in Charleston, South Carolina.

Abernathy's inconsistency in his nonviolent posture

is matched by the same attribute in the personal conduct of

this preacher.

MILITANT STATEMENTS MADE BY RALPH DAVID ABERNATHY,

PRESIDENT OF THE SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE

On the night of August 29, 1953, Abernathy

dashed from his church office in Muntgomery, Alabama,

pursued by an irate husband wielding a hatchet who accused

Abernathy of having a relationship with his wife. The

wire of the assailant told a Montgomery Circuit Court jury

In November, 1959, that she had submitted to unnatural sex

acts with Abernathy before her marriage, beginning at the

age of 15, and that "He never stopped chasing me" even

after her marriage. She had been a member of Abernathy's

church.

The jury reportedly deliberated only ten minutes

before acquitting the husband of charges

in connection with

his attack on Abernathy

During the Poor People's Campaign in Washington, D. C.,

Abernathy was headquartered at the Pitts Motor Hotel in

Washington, D. C., while his followers were mired in the mud

In Resurrection City, a shantytown near the Lincoln Memorial.

This became a point of contention among his followers and on

one occasion Abernathy slept at Resurrection City.

However,

he returned to the Pitts Motor Hotel during the night after

suffering 'stomach pains."

Abernathy has supported the violence-prone Black

Panther Party. In the latter part of 1969 he made several

public statements favorable to the Black Panthers. On

April 20, 1970, Abernathy urged liberal and progressive forces

to join a rally on behalf of the Black Panthers at New Haven,

Connecticut, on May 1, 1970.

Connecticut, in connection with the trial of BPP National

Chairman Bobby Seale, charged in the murder of Alex Rackley,

a BPP member suspected of being a police informant...

[NK 605-R* learned on 4/5/70 that Jon Turner in

New llaven talked to an unknown woman in Berkeley, California,

and told her he would be in New Haven about three weeks to do

something about Bobby Seale being "framed" into the electric

chair. He said his education and skills would be useful and

. told

I her that Dave (not further identified) would bring Turner's

"stuff" in Dave's briefcase on 4/6/70.

David Hilliard, BPP

Chief of Staff, left Los Angeles on 4/5/70 for New Haven.

Turner told the woman to listen for news from New Haven in the

next few weeks because it would be interesting.

According to the source, Turner again called California

a BPP member who

on 4/14/70 and instructed that Shelley Bursey'"black briefcase"

works on the Panther newspaper, bring him his

when she comes to New Haven.

The source added that a "big thing"

"details'"

liconsidered a bombing suspect because his clothes contained

information on explosives when he took them to be cleaned.

The New Haven police and Secret Service in New Haven

have been advised concerning Turner and the possible violence.

Investigation of Turner and Bursey is being intensified and

we are attempting to learn the contents of the briefcase being

carried by Bursey. New Haven is preparing a comprehensive letter-

The BPP national headquarters has promised the :

New Haven Chapter all the support it needs in preparation for

Seale and other Panthers. Reportedly, all chapters throughout

the United States have received instructions to send members

to the arca with an emphasis being placed on those having

Elbert Howard, the Deputy Minister of Information, have already

arrived and Howard has stated that "The people are ready, just

waiting for the word." A massive rally has been planned Ior

May 1, 1970, and thousands of individuals, incuding BPP members,

¡ the New Left, students and various coalition groups are expectec

¿to participate. The BPP states that "big thinos" are planned,

during this rally.

Large purchases of guns, ammunition and explosives have

been made for transportation to New Haven and a New York BPP

member has been placed in charge of a team of specialists in

demolition and fircarms. A bombing suspect of the Berkeley,

California, Police Department is in New Haven and is assisting

in this regard.

Current emphasis by the BPP is being placed on shutting

The basis for this dire prediction

is the all out eifort being made by the violence-prone, black

extremist, and pro-liarxist Black Panther Party (GPP) to make

New Haven a center of operations for the BPP and a rallying

point for black extremists and white radicals in order to

whip up support for BPP National Chairman Bobby Seale.

Preliminary hearings have been held in New Haven this

commit burglaries to obtain firearms and funds to further BPP

programs.

About the same cime, Douglas Miranda,. BPP Area

Captain in lew Haven, stated that each SPP chapter would be

requested to send two representatives, preferably those having

a knowledge of explosives, to New Haven while Seale is there

fox the trial. Miranda said that every effort would be made

to prevent Seale's conviction,

but i1 these efforts were

not successful "New Haven will burn." (SOG LHM 3/10/70 re BPP)

Blackout and Race War

he stressed what was expected of young white

revolutionists in these words:

"If they feel that they vant

the issue of trying to free Bobby,"

Milliard a led, "we're going to unleash a race war on the

pigs of America and it's up to you, as white revolutionists,

to support the struggle of black people."

(NH airtel 4/15/70 re BPP

Counterattack and Annihilate

Similar inflammatory themes have been featured in

recent issues of "The Black Panther," weekly BPP newspaper.

For example, BPP Minister of Information Eldridge Cleaver,

who is a fugitive Iron justice and sell-exiled in Algeria,

vIte n the Maich 7 losue:

"He, Diacs peopie, if we are

forced to go it alone, must be prepared to unleash the ultimate

political consequence upon this racist nation.

The ultimate

political consequence which Black people have in their power

to unleash is RACE WAR... This is the political consequence

which America faces because of this unspeakable evil attempt

to murder Chairman Bobby Seale in the Electric Chair."

The

April 18

issue contains instructions for cleaning shoulder

weapons, for firearms training, and for making Molotov cock-

tails and hand grenades.

This issue also carries a comment

by Randy Williams on the jailing of David Hilllard and BPP

12190502*y

Minister of Culture Emory Douglas in New Haven for contempt

California,

Police Department for "unprovoked ambush and

wounding of" four Oakland police officers on April 17,

1970, wrote: "Counterattack by any means necessary.

Shoot to K111

The New Haven SPP chapter's "People's News Service"

picked up the theme of race war in its April 5 issue

when it

to kill. When pigs go after Panthers it's destroy all,

kill all. The only solution to our problem is dead pigs

from the three levels of oppression,

the demagogic politicians,

avaricious businessmen, and the racist pig cops."

In this

connection, a rumor was spread through the gheito area of

New Haven that Arnold Marrie,

State's Attorney who is

prosecuting the BPe case, will be murdered it seale is

convicted.

Another rumos calls for the kidnaping of someone

in the office of the Attorney General of the United States

who would be held ¿or the release of Seale if Seale is

convicted. (NH it 3/26/70 re BPP; SF t* 4/6/70 re BPP)

"Glant May Day Celebration"

There are other ominous signs.

Jon Turner, BPP

activist from the West Coast is in New

Haven. Turner, who

is viewed as a possible bombing suspect by the Berkeley,

California,

Police Departmer's, has told West Coast associatos

that his education and skills would be useful in New Haven

and that a "big thing," a "giant May Day colebration" is

Turner added that in

New Haven things are

planned for May 1 in Ney ishe" the community is mobilized,

and its going to get hot.

Elbert "Blg Man" Howard, BPP

Deputy Minister of Information, has also mentioned

a raLly

in New Haven on May 1, and has said that even school children

in New Haven are determined to keep Bobby Seale from the

electric chair.

At a rally held at Tale University on

April 14, Howard stated that the black community "must meet

kidnaping with klanaping; killing with killing." If the

Panthers are convicted, Howard predicüed, "You will have a

i2o0d of crazy niggers

in your streets."

(H tts 4/14, 16, 20/70

Trouble at Yale

As for Yale University, the campus is tense as the

Panthers go all out to gei student support.

tarlier this

month, Elbert Howard wanted Robert Scheer, lorner editor of the

rabidly anti-United States magazine, "Ramparts," to come to

New Haven to lead a three-day strike at Vale University and

to demand of Tale $500,000 for the "Bobby Seale Defense Fund."

Panthers in New Haven are distributing pamphlets, brochures,

and "The Black Panther" widely on the Yale campus to rally

support. On April 20, David Dellinger of the New Mobilization

of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference held a press

conference concerning the

mass rally scheduled to be held in

New Haven on May 1, 1970, and said they expected support

from Yale students.

An identified Negro told a group of

Tale students on April 17,

"If you don't close Yale down in

two weeks, we have the means to do ii ourselves." On the

night of Apr 1 21, the Vale Student Senate agreed to "a vote

for a volun iry strike to express concern for justice and

the rights" of the Panthers charged with the murder of

Alex Rackir 7. On April 22, about 80 per cent of Yale's

students wire on strike. (NH tts 4/16, 17, 20/70 re BPP)

Weapons and Ammunition Stockpiles

The volatile statements and threats of the Panthers

cannot be dismissed as more rhetoric or propaganda.

It has

been reported, for example, that Robert Webb, New York City

Panther, has been placed in charge of a team of specialists

in demolition and firearms. A Meriden, Connecticut, police

officer apprehended six young Negroes on April & alter a gun

shop had been burglarized.

On the previous night, 19 weapons

vere stolen from the same snop. there is ample reason to

belleve that these stolen weapons were to be delivered to the

BPP in New Haven.

Furthermore, Boston Panthers have been

purchasing arms and large quantities of anmunition for

delivery to New Haven. The purchases, the bulk of which

were made on April 17, included five rifles, one shotgun,

one carbine, and nearly 30, 000 rounds of ammunition,

including 23,000 rounds for high-powered rifles. (NH t: 4/9/70

This is to furnish a summary of the racial situation in New Haven,

Connecticut, where tension is building in connection with the approaching

murder trial of Bobby Seale, chairman.of the Black Panther Party (BPP),)

and other members of the extremist BPP. •

New Haven law enforcement agencies are preparing for BPPiL

, violence. In view of the many threats of violence made by BPP leaders in the

event Bobby Seale is convicted of murder, law enforcement agencies in

New Haven are making special preparations to handle any violence that may

occur. The chief cause of concern at the present time is the massive rally

which the BPP and its sympathizers are planning for 5/1/70, which activity

may continue for several days. The chief of the New Haven Police Department

advised today that current plans call for utilization of 200 police officers on

duty on a continuous basis from 5/1 through 5/3/70. Three hundred Connecticut

State Police officers and 700 National Guardsmen will assist.

In addition,

there will be 1700 National Guardsmen on call who can be mobilized within a

2-hour period. •

received. These reports have been to effect that members of BPP are prepared

to buy large amounts of weapons and ammunition for use by New Haven Panther

Defense Committee in the upcoming "revolution." Police in Boston report

that BIr members or sympathizers there hake roade purchases of rifles,

I shotguns, handguns and large quantities of ammunition for use in NeW Have

Weapons in possession of the Panthers reportedly include automatic weapons.

On 4/23/70 an official of the United Nuclear Corporation in

New Haven reported that a former employee informed him that he had

overheard on 4/22/70 a conversation among six Negroes at a bar room who

were discussing the 5/1 demonstration and specifically heard them say that

Memorandum for Mr. Sullivan

RE: THREAT OF RACIAL VIOLENCE

NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT

"United Illuminating, Olin Mathiesen, and United Nuclear would be bombed out. "

He stated he had alerted officials of these companies as well as the Atomic

Energy Commission and local authorities.

Information was received in February that dynamite was located

at BPP headquarters in New Haven. Recently a source advised that at least

two members of each BPP chapter in the country (BPP organizations

are located in about 40 cities) should proceed to New Haven and that preference

I should be given to members having explosives and demolition experience.

Violent statements by BPP leaders have already caused minor

disturbances in New Haven. Following the jailing of two BPP officials on

contempt of court charges during preliminary proceedings in the BPP trial

on 4/14/70, a group of blacks broke windows and created disturbances in

downtown New Haven. Several days later, a group of about 300 high school

students, most of them Negroes, who had been demonstrating in front of

the courthouse ran through the downtown area shoving and pushing shoppers

and damaging property. On 4/22/70, a local BPP leader created a disturbance

at a high school forcing the temporary closing of the school when fires were

started and windows broken by rampaging students.

Reports indicate BPP gaining support of Yale University student

scoups.

Leaders of the BPP have been active on the Yale campus where

many of their threats of violence have been voiced. They have indicated

they expect strong support from Yale students in the 5/1 rally and have

¡ threatened to close Yale down if a demand of $500, 000 from the University

'to be used in defense of Connecticut Panthers is not met. A threat was made

to take over the rare book library at Yale.

On 4/22/70, ten of twelve undergraduate colleges at Yale voted to

strike in support of the

Panthers. Yesterday approximately 500 striking

students staged a march to the residence of the University president and

then held a brief peaceful rally. A peaceful "civil disobedience" demonstration

called for by Yale Chaplain William Sloane Coffin, Jr., during which Coffin

and otherwould subject themselves to arrest scheduled to be held on 4/24/70

has been postponed to be held, according to Coffin, in abeyance for possible

future use.

The Black Panther Party is currently engaged in

a massive campaign in New Haven, Connecticut, in support

of its Chairnan Bobby Seale and other Black Panther Party

members who face trial there for the killing' of a fellow

Panther in May, 1969. The main propaganda phase of this

campaign is that Seale is a political prisoner who is

being railroaded to the electric chair. The Black Panther

Party claims that he will never be electrocuted because it

will curn off all

the electricity and let the flame of

liberation light the sky. This theme of shutting off the

electricity is continually preached by the Black Panther

Party in speeches by its members and in the articles and

cartoons appearing in its newspaper,

be advised of any specific threat developed in this regard.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

Focus on New Haven

Many signs now indicate that the possibility for

racial violenca, acts of destruction, and even assassination

In New Haven, Connecticut, will increase sharply in the

coming weeks and montis.

The basis for this dire prediction

is the all-out effort being nade by the violence-prone, black

extremise, and profarxist Black Panther Party (BPP) to make

New Haven

a center of onerations for the B2y and a rallying

point for black extremists and white radicals in order

whip up support for BPP Hacional Chairnan Bobby Seale.

Preliminary hearings have been held in New Haven this

In early March, 1970, information was received that

new operational instructions were to be forwarded clandestinely

to BPP chapters.

Among other things, each chapter was to

funish a list of sympathiners who have had milliary experience

for the purpose of establishing a school in the United States

for training in guerrilla

Vardare.

The chanters were also to

try to place sympathizers in positions in lew enforcement and

commit burglaries to obtain firearms and lunds to further BPP

programs. About che same time, Douglas Miranda,. BPP Area

Captain in New Haven, stated that each BPP chapter would be

requested to send two representatives, prefesably those having

a knowledge of

explosives,

to New Haven while Seale is thexe

for the trial.

Miranda said that every effort would be made

to prevent seale's conviction, but 11 these eiforts were

not successful "New Haven will burn." (SOG LEM 3/10/70 re BPP)

Blackout and Pace War

On Harch 18, 1970, BPP Chief of Start David Mlllard

will take lives, we will blow up buildings, we will kill

He stressed what was expected of young white

revolutionisis in these words:

"If they feil that they want

to do what they've already been doing in terms of explosives,

then they should do that.

It they want to assassinate judges

then they should do that.

If you don't want black people to

just go out in the strcet and indiscriminately nurder white

people or vice verse, then I think it is necessary for us to

Ililliard added, "we're going to unleash a race war on the

pigs of America and ti's up to you, as white revolutionists,

to support the struggle of black people."

(NH. airtel 4/15/70 re BPE

Counterattack and Annihilate

Similar inflammatory themes have been featured In

secent issues of "The Black Panther," weekly BPP newspaper.

Boï example, BPP Minister of Infornation Eldridge Cleaver,

who is a fugitive from justice and self-exiled in Algeria,

wrote in the march " issue:

"Tie, Black people, It ve are

Lorced to go it alone, must be prepared

to unleash the uitimate

political consequence upon this racisi nation.

The ultimate

political consequence which Black people have

in their power

to unleash is RACE WAR... This is the political consequence

whäch America faces because of this unspeakable evil attenpt

to murder Chairman Bobby Seale in the Electric Chair."

The

April. 18 Issue contains instructions for cleaning shoulder

weapons, for firearns

training, and for making Malotov cock-

tails and hand

grenades.

This

issue also carries a comment

by Randy Williams on the jajling of David Hilllard and BPP

Minister of Culture Emory Douglas In New Haven for contempt

of court. Willians, who is in custody of the Oakland,

California, Polico Departnent for "unprovoked ambush

and

wounding of" four Oakland police officers on April 17,

1970, wrote: "Counterattack by any means necessary.

America will soon dread the birthday and curse the name of

the lascist pig judge in Connecticut....ONERS: Destroy the

spirit of the fascist forces; seek out and annihilate them

wherever they ara found."

"Glant May Day Celebration"

There are other ominous signs.

Jon Turner, BPP

activist from the lest Coast is in New Haven. Turner, who

is vigved as a possible bombing suspect by the Berkeley,

California, Police Depariner, has told West Coast associates

that his cducation and

planned for May 1 in New Haven.

Turner added that in

has

said that even school children

In New Haven are determined to keep Bobby Seale from the

electric chair. At a rally held at Yale University on

between local and Federal agencies, and a decision with respect

to alerting Federal troops, such decision to be taken into

consideration by the Deputy Attorney General in connection

with his meeting this afternoon with military agencies.

POTENTIAL FOR VIOLENCE DURING

DEMONSTRATIONS IN SUPPORT OF

BLACK PANTHER PARTY DEFENDANTS

NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT

A.

General Situation

Many signs indicate that the possibility for ractal

violence, acts of destruction, and even assassination in New

Haven, Connecticut, is increasing sharply. The basis for

this is the all-out effort being made by the extremigt Black

Panther Party (BPP) to make New Haven a center of operations

for the BPP and a rallying point for black extremists and

white radicals in order to whip up support for BPP National

Chairman Bobby Seale and other BPP members who are facing

trial on a murder charge.

Hany outside groups, including a

large portion of the Yale University student body, are

lending support to the BPP,

groups vill undoubtedly participate in massive demonstrations

which are scheduled to take place in New Haven for several

days beginning on hay I, 1970. A source advised on April

1970, that an individual not known to him had iniormed che

national headquarters of the BPP that 50,000 persons would

take part in the demonstrations in New Haven next weekend.

B. Threats of Violence

On

March 18, 1970, BPP Chief of Staff David Hilllard,

in an address before 2,000 persons at the University of

Connecticut, threatened that if anything happens to Seale,

"There will not be any lights for days in this country...Not

only will ve burn buildings, ve will take lives, ve will blow

up buildings, we will kill judges..." He stressed what was

expected of young white revolutionists in these words, "If

they feel that they want to do what they have already

doing in terms of explosives, then they should do that.

they want to assassinate judges, they should do that.

you don't want black people to just go out in the street and

indiscriminately murder white pecple or vice versa, then I

think it's necessary for us to come together around the issue

of trying to free Bobby."

Balliard said

"We're going to unleash

o race war on the pigs of America and it's up to you as white

revolutionists to support the strugglo of black people."

SEERET

Similar inflammatory themes have been featured in

recent issues of "The Black Panther," weekly BPP newspaper,

and in Ministry of Information Bulletins prepared by the

Connecticut State BPP.

Exanples of this are included in

-the attached copy of Ministry of Information Bulletin,

Number 15, which, among other things, contains a photograph

of the Chief of

Police at New Haven with the caption "wanted

Dead." Reportedly, 10,000 to 12,000 copies of these Bulleting

are distributed throughout the State of Connecticut, as well

as in New York City and Boston, Massachusetts, weekly. The

April 18 issue of "The Black Panther" carries an article by

Randy Williams who wrote, "Counterattack by any means necessary.

Fascist America will soon dread the birthday and curse the

name of the fascist pig judge in Connecticut...ORDERS:

Destroy

the spirit of the fascist force; seek out and annihilate them

wherever they are found."

C. Stocipiling of Arms and Ammunition

On April 21, 1970, a source advised that he had been

contacted numerous times by John laPort, a member of the New

Haven Panther Defense Committee, requesting

that he be prepared

to buy large amounts of weapons

and ammunition for use by the

New Haven Panther Defense Committee in the upcoming

"revolution."

He indicated he had $3,000 with which to purchase weapons.

According to reports from sources, BPP members in

Boston, wassachusetts, have been buying guns and large

quantzizes of ammunition in recent weeks for use in New haven.

John Pinderhughes, a Boston Panther, has been one of the

the Boston area.

The weapons reported purchased have included five

rifles, one shotgun, and one carbine.

The ammunition purchased

has included 4,400 rounds of .30 caliber, 1,700 rounds of 8mm,

880. rounds of .44 caliber, and 150 roundg of

00 buckshot.

source reported that the ammunition purchased by Pinderhughes

was delivered to BPP headquarters in New Haven on April 20,

1970, by James Wilson,

a white male who has been involved in

BiP activity.

A source advised on April 22, 1970, John Wayne Thomas,

a Boston Fanther, had made it known

that he is trying to obtain

magazines for automatic weapons and said he has 75 Smm autonatic

weapons.

A report was received by the Connecticut State

Police on April 27, 1970, that 280 shotguns and 80 rifles were

stolen fron a trucking company in North Branford, Connecticut,

this past weekend.

North Branford is near New Haven. The

company truck in which these weapons were carried away was

Apri-abandoned and empty near Throggs Neck, New YOrk, on

27, 1970. A theft of 44 rifles was also reported by

a company in Newington, Connecticut, over the weekend. No

suspects in these thefts have been developed.

On April 26, 1970, a source advised that Douglas

Miranda, a New Haven BPP leader, has instructed a member to

obtain

100 sand bags for use at

the New Haven BPP headquarters.

A source has also reported that Miranda was attempting to

obtain 1,000 "bags" as quickly as possible as "a matter of

11le and

death," stating "they" had to get "the stuff prepared

by Iriday. "

The source was unable to learn the specific nature

or purpose of the "bags."

D. Use of Explosives

The use of dynamite and other explosives by BPP

wembers and their sympathizers in the New Haven situation

is & strong possibility.

Information was received in February

that dynamite was located at BPP headquarters in New Haven.

A source advised on April 16, 1970, that Robert Webb, a New

York Panther, has been placed in charge of a team of specialists

in demolition and firearms.

Another source reported that the

BPP recently issued

instructions for at least two members of

each BPP chapter in the country (BPP organizations are located

in about 40 cities) to proceed to New Haven in connection with

the Panther murder trial, and that preference should be given

to members having explosives and demolition experience. Jon

Turner, a black extremist from Berkeley, California, who is

& bombing suspect of the Berkeley Police Department, Was

recently in New Haven, reportealy to ald in the activity

there by utilizing his skills as an explosives expert.

Indications are that he will return to New haven.

A source reported on April 19, 1970, that he had

been informed that two members of

the Weatherman faction of

the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) will be furnishing

dynamite to the BPP and their cause.. On April 27, 1970,

a professed conscientious objector sympathetic

Robert Goldstein,, but a believer in nonviolence, advised that

at a chemical warehouse in New Haven, has stated

he plans to

use his residence in New Haven as a gathering place where

individuals coning

into that city will be able to store expio

sives and weapons to be used in the demonstrations beginning

May 1, 1970. Doyle reportedly stated that he was obtaining

Liquid nitroglycerin and will be able to furnish it to anyone

who needed it.

On April

28, 1970, police searching & New haven

residence known as Radclift Hall, a Yale University building,

homemade smoke bombs. An 18-year-old former Yale atudent,

Gregory Wells, aged 22, was also arrested,

Both were charged with possession of explosives with intent

to destroy property and persons.

E. Demonstrations Scheduled for May 1, 2, and. 3, 1970

A chief cause of concern in the New Haven situation

at the present time is the massive rally which the BPP and

its sympathizers are planning for May 1, 2, and 3, 1970.

Reports indicate that 30,000 to 50,000 persons are expected

to participate in a wide

variety of activity over the three

day period.

such activity over this extended period could

went result in confrontations between the demonstrators and

law enforcement agencies and could tax the strength of the

police agencies.

1. Schedule of Activities

An informant advised that at & meeting of the Committee

to Defend the Panther 21 in New York City on April 26, 1970, it

was indicated that the following would be the schedule of activities

2, Make-up of Demonstration Participants

The radical groups planning to join the large number

ot Black Panthers in the three-day aifair at New Raven leave

no doubt that the situation is fraught with danger. Groups

which have indicated that they will participate include SDS

and its violence-prone Ventherman faction.

On April 26, 1970,

an individusl who identified himself as a

member of the

Weatherman faction contacted the leader of the New Haven

Panther Defense Committee

and informed hin that be was

"looking for some action," He was told that the best bot :

10r some

"action" was "Chieî Pig Ahorn" (Chief of Police in

New Haven) -

On the basis of information received from sources,

the following is the number of Black Panthers and members

of radical groups tho are presently in the New Haven area

or who are expected by May 1, 1970:

Black Panther Party

Connecticut membership - 55

Out-of-state members presently in New Haven m 60

Total out-of-state members expected 200

SDS and New Left Groups

Connecticut membership - 65

Out-of-state members presently in New Haven - 80

Out-of-state representatives expected - 70

Local SDS sympathizers - 500

Other groups which have indicaied they will partici

pato include the National Lawyers Guild, cited as & communist

front by the House Conmittee on Un-American Activities, and

the Women's Liberation Movement, a militant wonen's rights

group.

A source also reported that the December 4 Movement,

a radical student group of 35 to 50 members at Columbia

University in New Yorl City, will also take part and will

urge others

to join 1e.

On April 25, 1970, two members of the BPP visited

State University of New York (SUNY), Stony Brook, New York,

Arthur Mitchell, a black activist at SUNY; and Mitchell Coben,

a former student and SDS member. The purpose of the meeting

was to plan a campaign to raise money for Bobby Seale and to

rent busses

to transport individuals to New Haven.

A source advised that approximately 200 members of

the Venceremos Brigade who returned from Cuba this week have

indicated they will travel to New Haven to participate in

the lay demonstrations.

These Brigade members will travel

to New Haven independently and not be transported there by

the Venceremos Brigade.

3. Yale University Involvement

Leaders of the BPP have been active on the Yale

University campus for several weeks where many of the

threats of violence have been voiced.

They have indicated

they expect strong support fron Yale students in the May

demonstrations and have threatened to close lale down if the

demand of $500,000 fron the University to be used in defense

03 the Connecticut Panthers is not met. A threat was made

to take over the raro book library at Yale.

On April 22, 1970, ten of twelve undergraduate

colleges at Yale voted to strike in support of the Panthers.

The strike has goue into effect and has halted most academic

functions at the University. On April 23, 1970, 500 striking

students staged a rally on the Xale campus and a peaceful

"civil

disosedience" demonstration was called for by Yale

Chaplain William Sloane Coffin, Jr., on April 24, 1970,

during which Coffin and others

would Bubject themselves to

arrest. This demonstzation was subsequently postponed to be

held in abeyance ior possible future use.

With respect to Yale student participation in the

May demonstration

activity, it has been reported that

approximately 150: per cent of the student body of 9,385

members is leaving the

campus for the weekend. A student

strike in support of the BPP defendants has reportedly been

80 per .cent effective.

At has been reported that Yale University mil

provide medical aid through medical stations located on the

campus during the

May demonstrations: Most of the colleges

BEERS

at Yale are making arrangements to house visiting demon-

strators in rooms and temporary shelters.

Food will be

provided to the demonstraters by the University at a price

of 20 cents per meal.

4. Reports of Planned Violence During the

Demonstrations

A source reported that on April 24, 1970, an

individual not know to him had informed the

national head-

quarters of the BPP in Berkeley, Califoraia, that 50,000

persons would take part in the New Haven demonstrations and

that demonstrators would engage in guerrilla warfare in the

streets.

On April 22, 1970, a source advised that a BPP

member in Bosion had stated

that the Panthers had received

orders to move on Bobby Seale's trial in Connecticut and

break it up. On April 27, 1970, a representative of the

Associated Press

in New Haven advised he had received an

unsigned message from the Associated Press in Boston which

stated that during the confusion which will take place in

New Havenon May 1, 1970, a guerrilla force will attempt to

Iree Bobby seale from the state Prison at montvitle,

Connecticut.

1970, a Stat

This report has not been veritied.

On April 16, 1970, a source advised that Elbert Howard

had

stated he feels the temper of the black community in

New

Haven is "very good" and that "the people are roady, just

walting for the word." He clained that people in New Haven

aro holding clandestine meetings within their homes and that

even the school children are supporting Bobby Seale.

Rohert Goldstein, previously mentioned, advised that at "the

movement" party which he attended in New York City on

April 24, 1970, that he overheard a discussion between two

nenbers of "the movement" during which one of them said,

"After Kunstler gives bis speech, the plan nas to buxu

New Haven down." Special emphasis was put on the fact that

20 flres vero to be started in the ghetto areas of New Haven

and that after the fires were underway, the nest phase is to

be sniper fire upon firemen and not the police..

Individual, Lee Doyle, also reportedly stated that there

were plans

to blow up the bridge of the New Haven railroad

which runs through the center of New Haven.

On April 17, 1970, William Runstler, in a speech

before a biracial audience of 450 persons at the University

o1 Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky, urged everyone to

support the plight of Bobby Seale and to participate in

"the siege of New Haven" on May 1, 1970.

Security Measures Belag Taken by Local Law Enforcement

Agencies

: Lay enforcement agencies in the New Haven area are

making special preparations to control the demonstrations

during the unree day period rom hay 1 through 3, 1970.

The

Chiet of the New Haven Police Deparinent has advised that

current plans call for the full utilization of bis 425-man

police force. Sixteen-hour shifts will be worked during the

period with two thirds of the force on duty al all times.

Three hundred Connocticut State Polico officers and 700

National Guardsmen will assist local authorities. In

addition, there will be 1,700 National Guardsmen on call who

can be nobilized within a two-hour period.

In view of the possible attempts to free the BPP

members awaiting trial in Ney Haven, extra security guards

will be on duty at the State Prison in Montville, Connecticut,

and Homen's Prison at Niantic, Connecticut, were the EPp

members are contined.

Both of these cities are approxi

mately 50 miles east of New Haven.

The police department has established an

Intelligence Center where 17 telephones on direct lines will

be manned at all times.

About 40 undercover police officers

with walkie-talkies operating fron strategic concealed

places will act as - spotters, during the period of the three

day activity.

As a special security measure against the use of

explosives, all manhole covers in New Haven have been welded

down.

special police personnel wiii. be assigned to guard

scrategically located business establishments as well as

the police department, courthouse, and the Civic Center.

Large chemical plants in the area

will also be afforded

special guards and police officials have notified most other

private business establishments, such as lumberyards, to

afford thenselves extra security protection.

Special atiention will be paid to the three public

high schools in Now Baven which have about a 50 per cent

Negro student body in view of the strong possibility of

students becoming involved. No information has been

raceived as to whether the schools will remain open on

MaY I, 1970.

G. Reaction of Local Clüizens to the Demonstration Activity

The population of greater New Haven is approxi-

mately. 350,000 people.

The population of New Haven itself

is approximately 150,000 people, 40 per cent Negro.

Indications are that the local responsible citizenry, black

and white, is extremely concerned about the situation and

that it:

will remain clear ot the demonstration area, where

possible.

I. Disorders Which Have Already Occurred

Minor violence has already occurred in New Baven

as a result of activities of BPP members.

On April 14, 1970,

following the jailing of two BPP oificials on contempt of

court charges during preliminary proceedings at the EPP

trial, a group of Negroes broke windows and created disorders

in downtown New Haven®

Several, days later, a group of about

300 high school students, most of then Negroes who had been

demonstrating in front of the courthouse, ran through the

downtown area shoving and pushing shoppers and damaging

property. On April 22, 1970, a local IPP leader created a

disturbance at a high school, forcing the

temporary closing

of the school when fires were started and windows broken by

rampaging students.

On April 27, 1970, a fire of suspicious

origin caused considerable damage to the basement of the

Yale Law School Library. The damage was contined mostly to

books and to the upper

portion of the building caused by

heavy smoke.

On April 26, 1970, polico observed an automobile

occupied by two women

and a

man driving by police headquarters

several times and then stopping at the rear entrance of the

building. One of the individuals vas arrested for a traific

violation and the other two for trespass. A search of the

car by police revealed literature concerning the BIP rally

and also a map of the City of New Haven on which several

locations, Including National Guard arnories, a shopping

mall, the office building housing the IBI office, and the

University bowl had boen marked. Also found in the

vehicle were numerous electrical and plumbing-type tools and

general instruction manuals

pertaining to water and electrical

systens.

I. Conclusions

1. Based upon the current intelligence reflected

• In this paper, the potential for violence is extremely high.

-The assessment in this regard pertains not only to the

possibility of police confrontations and rioting, but also

takes Into account assassinations, bombings, arson and

sabotage against key facilities.

2.

The Departnental Civil Disorder Task Force

should proceed to New Haven on instructions of the Attorney

General

and Deputy Attorney General for instant deployuent.

3. Taking into account the high potential for

violence of all kinds, the decision with respect to alerting redera

troops will be taken into consideration by the deputy attorney

General in connection with his meeting with appropriate

military authorities.

4.

Responsible agencies, both local and Federal,

should maintain close and continuous liaison throughout

this crucial chree-day period with particular attention

being given to the protection of vital facilities and

Installations, including Government buildings which may

become targets for extremist elements.

To recommend that the attached teletype be sent to all

offices, except Anchorage, Honolulu, and San Juan, alerting them

to the high potential for violence at New Haven and to instruct

that immediate contacts be made with informants and sources to

insure that appropriate coverage is afforded this matter.

A continuous flow of information regarding the grave

and increasingly high propensity for violence at New Haven,

Connecticut, is being received. The steady influx of militant

excremists, both black and white, into the area

¡to take part in

denorstrations and related activity to commence 5/1/70 to show l

support for Black Panther Party (BPP) members charged with

murder has continued. This, accompanied by intelligence infor-

mation indicating that many of these extremists are intent upon

committing acts of violence, appears to underscore the necessity

to send reliable informants to the area. Also, it would appear

that sympathy demonstrations which could result

violence may occur on campuses or in cities in other parts

in acts of Trail

of the United 'States.

P.D. CUte

ACTION:

except Anchorage, Honolulu, and San Juan will be sent in

accordance with the above.

are planning to arrive in New Haven on 5/1/70. A source has advised this

group is bent on destruction and some members have been holding secret

meetings at which bombing attacks were planned. One of the leaders of

the group, Robert Butterfield, reportedly stated that the group was not

going to touch Yale but "just the center of New Haven" and further that they

would use fire bombs rather than explosives. This group is said to consist

of both white and black students.

SDS Chapter at Brown University plans to take part. The SDS

chapter at Brown University at Providence, Rhode Island, has chartered

la bus for New Haven on 5/1/70 to take 44 SDS members there.

SCLC leaders plan to take part in New Haven demonstrations.

Reportedly, RalphAbernathy and Andy Young of the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference (SCLC) plan to take part in the demonstrations at New Haven.

Supposedly, they have received assurances from the BPP that there will be

immediately on the first sign of violence.

BPP headquarters, 35 Sylvan Avenue, New Haven, was barricaded with some

2000 sandbags.

Yale students preparing for vidence. Sources have advised that

New Haven and surrounding areas are selling firearms and ammunition at a

rate 75 per cent above normal. On 4/30/70 several white girls of college age

Following are the

up-to-date developments as of early

this afternoon in New Haven, Connecticut, where the three-day

dononsüration activity by the extremist Black Panther Party (BPP),'"

various radical groups,

and other sympathizers in support of the

BPP bogan today. The Directos may wish to use this information in

connection with the briefing requested by the Vice President.

Background:

The basis for the activity in New Haven is the all out

effort being made by the BPP to make New Haven a rallying point

for black extremists and white radicals in order to whip up support

for BPP National Chairman Bobby Seale and the other BPP members who

are facing trial on a murder charge.

Previous information disclosed

that many outside radical groups and other sympathizers, including

a large portion of the Yale University student body, will take

part in the demonstrations during the three-day period of May 1, 2,

, and 3, 1970. Early information indicated that the number of

People

expected to participate in the demonstrations ranged from 20,000

¡to 50, 000.

Activity leading up to the May demonstrations has been

accompanied by many threats of violence, including assassinations,

burnings, bombings, and other forms of destruction made by BPP

lecders.

Reports have been received of the stockpiling of arms,

amnunition, and explosives by the BPP and some radical groups such

as tre Weatherman faction of the Students for a Democratic Society.

Memorandun R. D. Couter to W. C. Sullivan

RE:

DEYCNSTRATION ACTIVITY IN

SUPPORT OF BLACK PANTHER

PARTY MEMBERS FACING TRIAL,

NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT

Current Developments:

The demonstration activity in New Haven started today -

shortly after noon with a press conference on the New Haven Green

ducing which David Hilliard, BPP Chief of Staff, and Elbert Howard,

Hillta, s8

BPP Deputy Minister of Information, and several members of the

"Chicago 7," including Abbey Hoffman and David Dellinger, spoke.

An estimated crowd of 1,000 persons were present.

Hoirman made

the statement "If they do anything to Panther headquarters, we

will bring it out into the streets." Dellinger, on the other hand,

stated "We" should not have violence because the Government is

promoting violence and wants to cover up the true purpose of the

demonstrations by creating violence.

The press conference lasted

* about 1 hour and 15 minutes and no violence was reported. About

30 members of the violent Weatherman faction of SDS

were reported

earlier to be on the Yale campus with Abbey Hoffman, who was

"preaching fire."

Connecticut Hall on the Yale campus is being

used by the Boston, Massachusetts, SDS contingent.

As of 1:30 p.m. the estimated number of individuals who

hạd arrived in New Haven to participate in the demonstrations was

4, 000, The demonstrators are continuing to arrive from New York,

New Jersey, and other points. One group from Washington, D.C., is

reportedly on its way to New Haven carrying 50,000 "Free Bobby Seale"

leaflets prepared by a Washingion radical newspaper. The New York

Conmittee to Defend the Panther 21 in New York City paid $7,000 for

the chartering of 32 buses yesterday which were being used to

¿transport persons to New Haven.

A source reported that 75 members of a Hartford, Connecticut,

alack Panther group and the Blackstone Rangers, a Hartford youth

gong, are attempting to secure trucks and buses to come to New Haven

and these individuals are reported to be armed.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

A source who has furnished reliable information in

the past attended a "Revolutionary Action on Campus and In

Community" workshop at the Black Student Revolutionary

Conference (BSRC) which was held at Yale University, New Haven,

Connecticut, May 16 - 19, 1970. This conference was held

under the direction of the Black Panther Party (BPP). At the

May 18, 1970, session of that workshop, at least 100 persons

were present and the group appeared to

be made up of four

factions. Two of the factions were white and one of those

consisted of the extremist Students for a Democratic Society

Weathermen. The other two groups were representatives of the

black extremist BPP and the Black Student Union (BSU) .

BPP leader Douglas Miranda and two BPP representatives

from California spoke at that workshop.

Speakers encouraged students at the workshop to

withdraw their savings from banking institutions and invest

those funds in the necessary arms and material for revolution.

It was stated that an underground should be formed by students

from all states. It was said that intelligence files should

be kept on all black policemen and daily reports kept on their

activities so that they may be judged by the people and tried

at a later date:

It was pointed out that maps should be made pin-

pointing all emergency shelters, hospitals, fire stations,

reservoirs, railroad terminals, airports, telephone installa-

tions, and utilities. It was noted that guerrilla units

should be organized and developed to operate against trans-

portation facilities, radio and television stations, and

public utilities. Those units should consist of people who

are ready to die and are explosives experts, snipers, and

cameramen.

It was suggested that welfare mothers stockpile

canned goods

and that defense groups seek weapons and bombs

for a people's arsenal. Mention was

made of an underground

strike center which should be set up with security clearance

necessary for all who enter or leave. Such a center would

be used by only the most trusted personnel of the people's

army.

It wa's proposed that names and addresses of all public

officials, city and state, be recorded and classified so that

they can be readily "moved on" if necessary.

A second source who has also furnished reliable

information in the past advised that as individuals arrived

in New Haven on May 16, 1970, for the B'SRC, they went to the

BPP Defense Office where they registered and were assigned

IoOmS.

As part of the activities of the BSRC, the second

source advised that at about 8:30 PM on May 18, 1970, there

was a series of speeches by students who spoke of the problems

on their campuses.

One unidentified student from Staten Island,

New York, Community College ¡ mentioned that gun clubs were

being organized on his campus as well as other

campuses and

he urged that blacks be influenced to join them. He pointed

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

One of our Black Panther Party sources, who was in

New Haven, Connecticut, on May 1, 1970, during the massive

Black Panther Party demonstrations at Yale University, has

been debriefed and has furnished the following pertinent

information.

It was the source's observation that the Black

Panther Party in New Haven had considerable community support

evidenced by the fact its leader, Douglas Miranda, appeared

to be well-known and well-received by Negroes in the community

as he rode through the streets. (It appears very possible that

the recent remarks made about the Black Panthers by Kingman

Brewster, President of Yale University, expressing his opinion

as to the inability of black revolutionaries to achieve a fair

trial anywhere in the United States may have contributed much

to deepen and widen the commity support being given the

violent Black Panther Party .)

Source advised he observed the Black Panther Party

office in New Haven, located at 35 Sylvan Avenue, was protected

on the first floor by sandbags from floor to ceiling. The only

openings were gunports at the windows. The windows and doors

were protected by metal shields and bars. The second floor

was also protected by sandbags and appeared to be the opera-

tional area as it contained office equipment and some sleeping

quarters. The third floor had sleeping quarters and had food

and clothing stored there. The source was warned that the yard

surrounding the house was mined.

The Black Panther Party hopes to be able to

that a New Haven Police Department plain-clothes man, who is

called "Buffalve," is hated by the Black Panther Party and

that they will "get him."

The source said the philosophy of the Black Panther

office a Negro making silencers for guns.

This individual was

regarded with awe by other fanthers who said he was making

silencers for various types of firearms. The source also

stated the Black Panther Party had quantities of what appeared

to be durmy or practice-type hand grenades which had "Korea"

stamped on then.

The Black Panther Party hopes to be able to

use these as bombs or grenades.

According to the source, during the weekend of

May I to May 3, 1970, the Black Panther Party in New Haven

stressed that there was to be no violence at this time as

the "pigs" were ready and outmanned and outgunned the Black

Panther Party.

The source indicated that the Black Panther Party

members in New Haven have noticed the large number of one-

man police patrol cars which they say appear very vulnerable

and opens possibilities for ambush.

The source was also told

that a New Haven Police Department plain-clothes man, who is

called "Buffalve," is hated by the Black Fanther Party and

that they will "get hin."

The source said the philosophy of the Black Panther

Party during the weekend of May 1 through May 3, 1970, was

that there is a time and place for everything but this was

not the time for violence in New Haven, Connecticut.

Connecticut and contacted John Cheatham. Source

stated he traveled around with Cheatham who, while

they were at the Panther location on Newhall Street,

in New Haven, showed source three brand new . 306

pump shotguns.

He told source that the Panthers were

watching the operations at the Colt, Winchester and

Olin gun manufacturing plants. They ars seriously

thinking

of a raid on Olin and they have some

sympathetic people in there who may be able tö assist

them in setting it up. Cheatham bragged that he is

sheet of yellow lined paper with names of New

Source did not get the opportunity

to exanine it but roughly estimated it held about sixty

names.

Cheatham replaced the paper in his outside jacket

pocket where he seemed to keep it.

Cheathan also mentioned that the Mafia in the

Greater Boston area have a man, who keeps a supply of guns.

"When the Mafia is going to make a hit he issues guns and

they are returned to him. The BPP knows who he is and

where the arsenal is and are speculating about the possi

bility of hitting it. He also claimed a black soldier

attached to the Military Police or Security Department at

about selling them some Ml6 rifles for $500. The plan is

to have this soldier drive a trück onto the base on Memorial

While at the Chapel Street office of the BPP

white men. There were three wooden boxes of dynamite on

the floor one of which was open and contained long red

sticks of dinamite. They were being cut in smaller pieces.

The young men when speaking to one another spoke in a

language which source belleved to be French. Miranda had

not paid for it and was asking how he could reach them.

He wrote down one or two phone numbers and an address.

Miranda mentioned he had to go down south to appear at

some demonstration for black students. He did not

mention wherefor when. Source felt in observing Miranda

that he seemed to be worried and jumpy and not his usual

self.

Intelligence files should be kept on all black

EXTREMIST PHOTOGRAPH ALBUM

EXTREMIST MATTERS

• 7293-12.

The purpose of this

memorandum

to/recommend that

the

Black Nationalist Photograph Album (BNPA) be renamed the

Extremist Photograph Album and that it be expanded to include

extremist individuals in Klan and similar white extremist groups

meeting criteria for inclusion.

It is also recommended the

attached airtel be sent all offices and Legal Attaches (Legats),

Paris, Ottawa, and

Mexico City, advising them of changes.

The BNPA is available to all offices, Legats, Paxis,

Ottawa, and MeXiCo City LA THIRD AGENCY

and A

FOREIGN POLICE AGENCY

Currently it includes

a photograph,

biographical data and, where appropriate, confirmed felony con-

victions of individuals who are militant black nationalists, leaders

but not necessarily limited to black extremist groups, black

extremists who are fugitives in Bureau criminal cases

and

pron

extremist informants who travel in behalf of their respective

extremist organizations. Approximately 484 names are included

in the BNPA.

D

Elso.

•The BNPA has been a valuable investigative aid in our

investigations of black extremists who travel by making available

photographs and background data.

Inclusion of extremist individual

in the Klan and similar white extremist groups who come within

the above criteria for inclusion in the BNPA would prove equally

valuable. It is estimated that approximately 25 to 30 individuals

connected with Klan and similar white extremist groups will be

added as result of the above.

If approved, appropriate Manual changes will be made

and form-FD-432 will be revised for submission of data

connection with the BNPA.

The BNPA was approved and established in March,

1968, and consists of a photograph and biographical data

of individuals in the racial field who travel or are likely

¡to travel extensively. It has repeatedly proven to be an

extremely valuable aid to any office in which a black

extremist from another area travels. Experience indicates

that these extremists travel extensively and with the BNA

an office covering the travel has a photograph and background

of the individual immediately available.

Bureau letter 3-11-68 instructed that a Black

Nationalist Photograph Album be maintained in each Bureau

office. Although the original instructions were to include

the photographs of subjects known to

travel, it now appears

logical to include the photographs of

the principal leaders

of any black extremist organization, as experience has shown

that they can be expected to travel

also.

The inclusion of photographs of racial informants,

particularly those in the Black Panther Party, should be

considered as the availability of such photographs could

simplify investigations when the informants travel outside

their own divisions. Those informants who have traveled for

her respeceive black extremist organizations, or who are

COMM-FBE

LIkelyt do so, should be included.

These photographs and

their descriptions should be handled just as those of any

other subject and they should not be distinguished in any way

The availability of these photographs has proved

to be an excellent investigative aid and greatly simplifies

the handling of leads by auxiliary offices. Each office

should review the matter at this timo to determine if other

subjects or informants should be included.

established the following individual invescigative criterie

regarding NOI members:

(1) Full Investigation is conducted on all male

national officers; and the Minister,.

Secretary, and Captain of the FOl, in each

NOI mosque. (These investigations are

and/or is determined not to possess a

propensity for violence and is nos

• (2)

Limited preliminary inquiries, for the primary

purpose of determining propensity for violence,

are conducted on all current male members,

ages 18 to 36.

Limited preliminary inquiries consist only of

ascertaining the member's true name, identifying data,

residence, employnent and propensity for violence. This

Information is to be obtained through established

sources.

If a limited preliminary inquiry reveals a menber has

à propensity for violence, full investigation is subsequently

condueted...

We will continue to advise you if investigation of

the NOI reveals a reassessment la necessary as to the basis

for same, or if any substantial polley change is instituted

by this Bureau as pertains to investigating individual NOI

members.

Reference is made to my memorandum of May 16, 1974

providing you with our opinion that investigation by the

FBI of the Nation of Islam (NOI) should continue. In the

interim we have had an opportunity to further consider whether

the NOI's activities appear to violate certain statutes such

as Title 18, United States Code, Sections 231, 233 (Civil

united States

Disorder s); 241, 245 (conspiracy lu Deprive ani Deprivaiion vi

Civil Rights); and 2101 and 2102 (Riots).

In my May 16 memorandum, I informed you that I considered

it inadvisable to base continued investigation of the NOI on

Executive Order 10450 until the question of the continuation

of the Attorney General's list was resolved. On June 4, 1974

the President signed Executive Order 11785, which abolished

the list and prohibited its use by any agency of the Govern

ment.

However, Section 8(a)(5) of Executive Order 10450, as

revised by Executive Order 11785, requires that investigations

conducted pursuant to Executive Order 10450 shall relate to; *

inter alia, knowing membership in any organization which

unlawfully advocates or practices

force or violence to

prevent others from exercising their

to whether the continued investigation of the NOI is appro-

has recommended continued investigation for the reasons set

forth in my May 16 memorandum and on the basis of potential

violations of 8 U.S.C. 8$ 2101 and 2102 (Riots).

"and, finally, represent a potential threat to the public

safety as described in my May 16, 1974 memorandum.

As I have previously indicated, you should consult

further with the Department to reassess the basis for con-

tinuing the investigation if information is developed that

the NOI has changed its tactics and objectives and has

Reference is made to your letters of June 8, 1973,

August 6, 1973, and October 4, 1973, to me in which you

requested an opinion as to whether activities of the Nation

of Islam (NOI) come under the criteria of Executive Order

along surrent lines. A review has been made of pertinent

FbI reports di the activitics of the crganization, its

members and activities, and consultations have been held

with members of your staff. As a result, it is our opinion

that, for the time being, investigation of the NOI should

continue.

With respect to your specific questions, although our

review of FBI reports indicates that NoI may have engaged

in activities which deprive citizens of constitutional

rights, and, therefore, it would come within the criteria

of Executive Order 10450, the Department is currently

reviewing the Attorney General's list for the purpose of

determining whether its

continued existence is warranted.

Therefore,

I do not think it advisable to base continued

investigation of the NOI on Executive Order 10450, until

this question is resolved.

Insofar as any statutory violations may be concerned,

we are seeking the views of the Civil Rights Division and

we are considering further the applicability of statutes

•administered by this Division as to whether NOI'S activities

should be investigated in light of statutes over which they,

and we, have jurisdiction.

A basis for continued investigation was described by

Deputy Assistant Attorney General Kevin T. Maroney when he

testified before the Committee on Internal Security of the

House of Representatives on February 20, 1974. He pointed

out, inter alia, that without a broad range of intelligence

information, the President and the departments and agencies

of the Executive Branch could not properly and adequately

protect our nation's security and enforce the numerous

statutes pertaining thereto.

There is, in our view,

sufficient evidence to indicate that certain NOI members

have been involved in disturbances and attacks on police

throughout the country as noted in reports disseminated

to the Department of Justice, other executive agencies and to

the Secret Service in connection with its responsibility for

the proteccion ui lle President. Undor these circumstances,

I feel the Department, and in particular the Attorney General,

must continue to be informed of those organizations that engage

in violence which represent a potential threat to the public

safety. Therefore, continued investigation of this group is

warranted.

If, during the course of your investigation, information

is developed that the NOI has changed its tactics and

objectives, and has assumed an attitude of non-violence, you

should again consult with the Department to reassess the

basis for continuing the investigation. In the interim, •

I will apprise you of our decision as to whether NOI's

activities appear to violate certain statutes,

e.g., Title 18,

United States Code, Sections 231, 233 (Civil Disorders),

241, 245 (Conspiring to Deprive and Deprivation of Civil

Rights), and 2101' and 2102" (Riots) .

PURPOSE:

Attached for your approval is a memorandum to the

Assistant Attorney General

Criminal Division, requesting an

opinion be furnished at this time as to whether the activities

of the Nation of Islam (NOI) come within the criteria of

Executive Order 10450, or its activities are in vioLation of

• any other Federal statute.

The Department is also being

requested to advise whether the investigation of the NOI

should be continued.

BACKGROUND:

The NOI, founded in Detroit, Michigan, in 1930,

is ar

semi-religious black organization with over

7000/

•foreign units exist

independen 120 units, or Mosques, throughout the United States.

members in

in Bermuda, Jamaica

and British Honduras.

Elijah Muhammad, 75-year-old Supreme Ruler of the NOI, operates

from NOI national headquarters in Chicago, Illinois.

This group

seeks to establish a separate black nation, disavows any allegiance

to the United States Government, preaches

' a distorted version oi

the Islamic religion, and teaches all whites are "devils" who will

be destroyed by the

forces of nature.

NOI beliefs are propagated

weekly via distribution of over 500,000 copies of the NoI newspaper

"Muhammad Speaks" and by transmission of NOI teachings over the

dissension and difficulties

with rival Muslim sects,

and other adversaries, are believed to

have been factors: in at least 20 murders, three bombings, two

abductions and numerous shootings, beatings and assaults.

in the

past 18 months, the NOI has sought and received

Qatar and Abu Dahbi have donated $100,000

and Kuwait has indicated it is

considering a $2 million

We have conducted a continuous security-type investiga

tion of the NOI Since 1953.

PerIOdICaLLy,

and most recently on

July 12, 1966, we have requested the Department's opinion concern-

ing possible prosecution of the NOI under appropriate statutes

or its designation under Executive Order 10450.

The Department

has repeatedly declined to take action against

the NOI citing

lack of adequate evidence of specific acts by its leaders resulting

in force being utilized or violence occurring, as well as referring

to the quasi-religious nature of the NOI as a

further deterrent o

successful prosecution.

In view of the character and activities

of the NOI, the Department requested by memorandum July 28, 1966,

that the NOI continue to be the subject of active investigation

and that the Department be furnished the results for examination

for possible violation of Federal statutes and for possible

designation under the provisions of Executive

Order 10450.

During the period April 2, 1973 - May 20, 1973,

five

one week inservice sessions of specialized training in black

extremist matters were conducted at the FBI Academy for selected

representatives from each FBI field office except Anchorage and

It was the consensus of those attending these sessions

• that the NOI certainly warrants our continued investigative

attention in view of its substantially increased potential for

..- Violence in the past two years.

As a

considerable period of time has transpired since

the Department's last request for investigation regarding the

NOI, and in view of the increased propensity for violence of this

group, it appears in the Bureau's best interests to seek a

lecision from the Department as to whether a prosecutable violatior

exists concerning the NOI and as to the desirability of continuing

this investigation.

ACTION:

If approved, the attached memorandum be forwarded to

Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division.

Civil No. 72 C 1156

- N.D. Illinois

Recently a suit for refund of income taxes for

the years 1966 and 1967, was instituted in the United

States District Court for the Northern District of

Illinois, by Muhammed All. The sult seeks recovery

of $97,048.68 for the years in question based upon

a claimed deduction for contributions made to the

• Holy Temple of Islam or the Nation of Islam.

In

the earlier of the two years Muhammed Ali allegedly

made a substantial contribution to the organization

and then borrowed the money from it on the same day.

As to that transaction we, of course, are maintaining

that there was no true contribution and that the two

transactions effectively eliminate any claim of

deduction.

As an alternative defense for the first

year, and as a defense in the second year as well,

we are also contending that the recipient organi-

zation was not one to which deductibility contributions

could be made since, under the statute,

part of its

earnings inured to the benefit of certain individuals,

namely its leader Elijah Muhammed and members of his

Lamily.

Evidence available to us indicates that

organization funds were used to purchase homes, cars,

and other things for such it is - 436351-166

through

Accordingly, we

Lact of the existence of the reports and we propose

to advise counsel that such reports do exist but

that their contents are privileged.

Should you have any differing views as to the

procedure to be followed, we would appreciate

and to our correspondence in this matter dated March 3, 1964

Reference is made to your memorandum of July 18, 19660

wherein we discussed the operations of the NOI and particu

larly the type of evidence which would be needed to initiat l

action against the organization for designation under Sectio

8 (a) (5) 0f Executive Order No. 10450.

1966

The results of the investigations conducted in this

matter have been closely followed and it is noteworthy that

since our last communication there has been no significant

change as to the character and tactics of the organization.

The Fruit of Islam and Military Girls' Training groups con-

tinue to function and the role of the white man as a devil

and snake continues to be the central theme of all

preachings of the minister in the various temples. It is

also to be observed that the leadership continues to deni

grate the American flag and advocate disobedience of any

law contrary to the beliefs of the Muslims.

While it is clear that the leadership preacher's dis-

trust of all other groups and that the membership owes

allegiance only to the Muslim Cult, the tenor of the

preachings are in the nature of religious prophecies subject

to be fulfilled at some unknown future time by the supreme

rower, Allah.

Attached for your approval is a memorandum to

3. Walter Yeagley, Assistant Attorney General, requesting

an opinion be furnished at this time as to whether the

activities of the Nation of Islam come within the criteria

of Executive Order 10450 or its activities are in violation

of any other Federal statute.

OBSERVATIONS:

The Nation of Islam is an all-Negro semireligious

organization which advocates a doctrine of violent hatred

of the United States Government and the white race.

The

organization is headed by Elijah Muhammad with headquarters

in Chicago, Illinois. We have conducted a continuous

security-type investigation of this organization since 1953.

Periodically, we have requested the Department's opinion

as to possible prosecution of the Nation of Islam under

appropriate statutes or designation under Executive Order

10450, most recently on January 31, 1964.

The Department has repeatedly declined to take

action against the Nation of Islam, citing lack of specific

acts of force or violence by its leaders or members.

Department makes repeated reference to the quasi-religious

nature of the Nation of Islam as a lurther deterrent to

successful prosecution. Recognizing the threat to the

internal security of the Nation posed by the Nation of Islam,

the Department has requested our investigation be continued

and the names of appropriate Nation of Islam officials be

included in our Security Index and that they be considered

for apprehension during a period of national emergency.

CONT IDENTIAL

This will refer to your memorandum of January 31, 1964

wherein you request an opinion whether in the light of the

additional information furnished by the Bureau since May 16, 1963

rith reference to the above-entitled organization, the activities

o. the NOI come within the criteria of Executive Order No statute

or whether its activities are in violation of any Federal

within the jurisdiction of this Division.

There is insufficient evidence to warrant proceedings

for violation of any Federal statute within the jurisdiction of

the Internal Security Division's responsibility.

Section 8(a) (5) of Executive Order No. 10450 provides

for the designation of "any foreign or domestic organization,

association, movement, group, or combination of persons which is

totalitarian, Fascist, Communist, or subversive, or which has

adopted,

or shows, a policy of advocating or approving the

commission of acts of force or violence to. deny other persons

their rights under the Constitution of the.

. U.s., or which seeks

to alter the form of government of the United States by unconstitu-

tional means"

The NOI cannot be designated as subversive under

Executive Order No. 10450 unless the evidence available proves

its activities to be in the category of "subversive, or which

has adopted or shows, a policy of advocating or approving the

commission of acts of force or violence to deny other persons

their rights under the Constitution of the U.S.,. ..

indicate that most of the NOI

training in judo and karate, and in some instances with guns.

At every meeting the white man is characterized as a devil, a

snake who has tortured the legro and always will; that this white

devil must be exterminated along with his black sympathizers;

that the white man was alloted by. Allah, their Supreme power, a

certain period on this earth and this period is now up; that all

NOI members must await the signal from Elijah Muhammad to indicate

the beginning of the extermination of the white devils to make

room for a Negro takeover of the country; that such a signal

would be forthcoming momentarily.

Moreover, the NOI leaders,

Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X and others, preach that they must

have a part of the territory of the United States as their own

exclusive territory together with sufficient financial means

to set them up economically independent. At their meetings, the

NOI members denigrate the American flag and advocate disobedience

of any law contrary to the beliefs of the Muslims.

This reported information, however, is insufficient

to prove a policy of advocacy or approval of

the commission of

acts of force or violence to deny other persons their rights

under the Constitution of the United States.

The activities reported must be shown to be more than

mere prophecies or utterances made with the hope of ultimate

attainment of their desired aims.

For example, while teaching

that the white man must be exterminated they do not say by whom

or how.

There should be available evidence to show that the

advocacy or approval of the commission of acts of violence to deny

others their Constitutional rights is calculated to

members to action now or in

the foreseeable future. Incite the

Evidence

is needed to show the specific acts taken by particular individual

leaders in advocating or approving acts of force and violence;

or urging has been made to bring about

such event; not the abstract

teaching that Allah will cause the desired event

but the concrete

steps taken by specific individual leaders to eifectuate their

goals.

It is fully realized that

such evidence is not easily

obtained even if it exists;

and finally there seems to be some

indication that the leaders

are becoming more cautious in their

utterances •

prosecutive action against the Nation of Islam (NOI) •

Our latest

request was dated ?/5/63. In response, the Department has requested

It be supplied with a prosecutive summary report setting forth evidence

the NoI within the past three years has advocated or approved commission

of acts of force and violence to deny individuals their constitutional

rights or in seeking to alter the form of government of the United States

by unconstitutional means.

In previous opinions, the Department advised a review of the

activities of the NOI did not constitute violations of any Federal

statutes.

In fact,

the Department in the past has contended the

language used by NOI officials does not advocate overthrow of the

Government by unconstitutional means but seeks. to arouse hatred

against the white race as a whole.

The Department requested we

continue to furnish data concerning NOI for future study. ' Wei have:

done this on a continuing basis.

This is in response to your memorandum of January 10,

1962, inquiring about the possibility of designation of the

captioned organization pursuant to the provisions of

Executive Order No. 10450, and asking whether its activities

are in violation of any federal statute.

An examination of the reports and memoranda pertaining

to the subject organization fails to disclose sufficient

evidence to warrant prosecutive action against the leaders

under the Smith Act and other related statutes, or to justify

the institution of designation proceedings. The reasons

set forth in our memorandum of September 21, 1960, are

relevant to the present situation.

Because of the radical, semi-secret, and violent nature

of this organization, and the continuing tendency on the part

of some of its leaders to use language of implied threats .

against the Government, we are asking the Bureau to continue

its investigation of the organization and its leaders.

This is in reply to your memorandum to the Attorney General

dated September 9, 1960, inquiring about the possibility of pro

secutive action against the leaders or designation of the captioned

oxganization under provisions of Executive Order No. 10450.

The available evidence concerning the activities of the

leaders and members of this organization falls far short of the

evidentzary requirements sufficient to meet the standards set forth

In the Yates decision. phile che leaders or the Nör at times re-

sort to the use of virulent and vicious language which would incite

the members to 'individual acts of violence against the white race,

it is more calculated and designed to arouse hatred and antipathy.

against the white race as a race,

rather than against the Government.

There is evidence of language which speaks of the destruction of

America, but is couched more in terms of prophecy and prediction,

often referring to the "War of Armageddon," than in terms of incite

ment to action. Moreover, the First Amendment would require

something more than language of prophecy and prediction and implied

threats against the Government to establish the existence of a

clear and present danger to the nation and its citizens.

Regarding designation of the NOI pursuant to the provisions

of Executive Order 10450, it is our opinion that hate-language em-

ployed by the organization's leaders is not probativeof the criteria

of "subversive" nor is it sufficient to establish the NOI to be an

organization".. seeking to alter the form of government by

unconstitutional means.!'

"Although there' is substantial evidence of

NOI's advocacy of future violent reprisals-for alleged wrongs com-

mitted against one or more of its members, the evidence is

insufficient at this time to meet the criterion that it has adopted

a policy of advocating or approving-the commission of such acts

of violence to deny othere.

As you have been previously advised, the designation

of NOI poses a number of legal problems.

For example, the

inclusion of NOI under the category that it is an organi-

determined to be inapplicable inasmuch as the language

criterion of the Order.

Amendment insofar as freedom of speech is concerned.

Any

prosecution involving members of this organization will un-

doubtedly be reviewed by the courts not only

from this as

pect, but also from the "freedom of religion" clause of the

First Amendment. It can; therefore, be anticipated that

the courts will require that the proof against any member

of this organization be strong and unequivocal, mainly be-

cause of the claimed religious nature of the organization.

FRAUD

With regard to possible prosecutions under sec-

tions 1001 and 1621 of Title 18, United States Code, We

have reviewed all individual cases coming within the pur-

view of these statutes and, to date, have been unable to

recommend prosecution in any of them for the various

reasons of which you have been apprised in our previous

correspondence in this matter.

Because of the repeated acts of disrespect to-

ward our flag shown by leaders of this organization, we are

considering the desirability of proposed legislation, simi-

Lax to Title 4, Section 3 of the United States Code, which

is applicable only to the District of Columbia, to make

criminal acts of desecration or other disrespectful acts di-

rected toward our country's flag.

With regard to possible designation proceedings,

certain legal problems created by an action under the appli-

cable criteria are under consideration and an analysis is

being made of the more recent reports submitted by the Bureau.

You will be advised concerning this matter as soon as a de-

cision has been reached.

legal action could be taken, including placing the NOI on the Attorney

General's list of subversive organizations (pursuant to E.0.10450) •

Department replied by memorandum 2/7/56 that the organization does

warrant designation under E.O. 10450 or consideration under the Smith Act

of 1940. It is noted that we could expect considerable difficulty in

producing wienesses to clearly depict the violent nature of this organi-

zation at any administrative hearing because we have gained most of our

information from live Negro informants who would be extremely loathe to

testify publicly because of the inherent physical danger from other members

of the organization and ostricism by other members of their race.

which raises again with the Department the question of possible legal

action against the NOI.

SUBJECT:

Nation of Islam,

Formerly Referred to as Muslim Cult of Islam

As you know, this Division has had under review FBI reports

on the Muslim Cult of Islam since receipt of your memorandum to me of

September 7, 1955, Subject: Program for Apprehension and Detention of

Persons Considered Potentially Dangerous to the National Defense and

Public Safety of the United States.

The review was being conducted with a view toward making

determination as to whether or not the Muslim Cult of Islam should be

designated by the Attorney General, and also the effect the reported

membership in this organization would have on the consideration of whe-

ther an individual should be listed on the Security Index.

The memorandum to me of March 25, 1957, captioned "Emergency

Detention Program! enclosed a copy of an FBI report dated March 12,

1957, at Atlanta captioned "James Alfred Martin, Jx., was" and bore the

character "Security Matter--NOI.

" The

first paragraph of the details

of this report reflects the following:

"On January 21 and January 22,

1957, Confidential Informant Atlanta I-l, who has furnished reliable

information in the past, advised that the organization formerly referred

to as the 'Muslim Cult of Isiam' has been described by ELIJAH MUHAMMAD,

the national leader, as the 'Nation of Islam' and/or" Muhammad's Temples

lf Islam'. The character of this case is therefore being changed from

"SECURITY MATTER - MCI' to 'SECURITY MATTER - NOI'

It is not clear if your Bureau intends to substitute the

""Nation of Islam" for the "Muslim Cult of Islam" on the sole basis of

the description furnished to Atlanta Informant T.l, nor is it clear whe-

Ilther the "Muslim Cult of Islam" is no longer in existence.

If it is intended that the Nation of Islam be a substitute for

the Muslim Cult of Islam, it would be appreciated if you would furnish

United States since they are in slavery in this country. These are

among the reasons given by the leaders why Cult members should not

register for Selective Service or seive in the arned forces.

Each Temple of the organization has a branch known as

the Fruit of Islam, composed of the able bodied male members. the

members of these groups are instructed in close order drill, self

defense, eating habits, wearing apparel and the study of regula

tions and doctrines of

the Cult. In some of the Temples, addin

tional courses of instruction in Mathematics, English and Arabic

are also given,

The report cites four specific acts of violence in

which Cult members have been involved. These acts may be

suM-

marized as follows:

"Silver Spring, Maryland, Incident. A group of approximately

30 Cult memoers was traveling in a day coach en route from Jersay City,

to Chicago.

Shortly before arrival in Wasnington, Do Cos some members

of the party became involved in a dispute with a railroad porter over

the issuance of a soiled pillow to one of the group. Several members

of the group assaulted the porter, who then broke contact with the

group and reported the incident to the Station vaster at Washington

The train had departed Washington before any action could be taken;

but police in Silver Spring, Maryland, were requested to investigate

the incident. Upon boarding the train in Silver spring, four police

officers were assaulted by Cult members and the guns and blackjacks.

Of two were taken by Cult members.

After police reinforcements

arrived, nine Cult members were arrested and charged with assault and

battery, inciting a riot, and interfering with an officer in the per

formance of his duties.

Six deiendants were tried, convicted, and

sentenced to terms ranging from six months to twenty-one months.

Incinnat.

Le ono Incident

After engaging in a street

fight, nine persons were arrested.

Seven identified themselves as

Cult members and the other two claimed that they were forner members,

but were still firm believers. Two were charged with assault with

Intent to kill, by one of the victims, and with assault and battery,

by a policeman who had been struck during the fight.

severely beaten.

The officers shot and wounded two of their attackers,

who were identified as Cult members.

Three MCI members were tried

and convicted of attempting to incite a riot.

San Diegor

California Incident. A dinner was held at

Fort Rosecrans for the 1402d Combat Ingineers Battalion, a Negro

National Guard organization which had been called into Federal Service.

A civilian who attended the dinner, identified as Harrison Cole, a

Cult member, engaged several of the recruits in conversation. then

it was determined that he was making seditious statements to the

recruits, he was removed from the Fost by armed

escort.

The report also contains numerous statements by Mijah

Mohammed and the various ninisters of the organization. These state-

ments appear to advocate the violent overthrow of the Government and

I the slaughter of the White race.

The dominant theme of the utterances

is that all persons who are not members of the Cult willbe destroyed

in the War of Armageddon, at which time the Government will be

overthrom and the Muslims will come to power.

There are also

statements which approve the acts of violence committed by the

Mau-Mau in Africa and the Fuerto Rican Nationalists, and which exhort

Cult members to kill the white devils in order to bring about the

day of their deliverance. It should also be noted that the report

contains other statements by leaders of the organization to the

eifect that the deliverance of the luslims is to be brought about

through a divine act of Allan, who will destroy the "wicked" and

overthrow their government without any assistance irom Cult members.

According to this teaching, the role of the membership of the Cult

In the war of Armageddon will be entirely a passive one.

Although the report is replete with violent statements by

the leadership of the organization and there have been acts of

violence by the individual members, it is believed that the evidence

of the organization which could reasonably be calculated to attempt

the violent overthrow of the Government.. The statements of the

leaders of the organization, while they do express the desira-

billty of overthrowin, the Government, are more in the realm

for the fact that the persons involved are members of the organ-

The report also cited the attempt of District 1 of the

In the discussion had with you by li. Belmont

on Sepüember o, 1955, when he delivered my menoranoun

of septenber 1, 1955s it was agreed that sher was a

need for a careful review by the Department of the

file on the Muslim cult of Islam to determir: wnecher

this organization constitutes a dangerous instrunentality

in the event of a national emergency.

In the meantimes

while the Depariment was condueting this review, there

would not be furnished to the Depariment a list of Cult

members included on the security Index.

Jou were also

advised thats if the Depariment concluded from its

review that the Muslim Cult of Ision did not constzüude

a potential threat to the internal security of this

country, us would take steps to remove from the

security Index the names of those individual members

presently inoluded therein.

UNRECORSED COFY

Your memorandum of February 7, 1950, states

it appears that the anciunite and anti-t. so coverunent

teachings of the cult constitute that organization o

potentially dangerous instrumentality in the event of

Tig sect

a national emergency.

Consequently, we are not

removing the names of cult members from the security

Index at this time.

The attached memorandum from Assistant Attorney

General William D. Impkins dated 2/7/56 reiterates a requeli

contained in Department memorandum of 8/23/55 that the names

and I'BI file numbers of members of the Muslim Cult of Islam (MCI)

included in the security Index be forwarded to the Department

for review for the purpose of determining whether their names

should be retained in the security Index.

The Director askea

"What about this? Haven't we complied with request of

August 23? H."

The Department's request of 8/23/55 was discussea in

my memorandum of : 912/55. I recommended that

this list not be

furnished the Department pending a decision by the Department

as to whether membership in, active participation in the affairs

thereof, and adherence to the basic tenets of the MCI constitute

sufjicient basis to include an individual's name in the security

Index.

We have been pressing the Department for a decision in

this matter since 8/8/55 and, with the Director's approval, I

personally delivered a memorandum to Mr. Iompkins on 9/8/55

requesting the Department to thoroughly review the organizational

reports on the McI. I informed Mr. Tompkins at that time that,

if the Department arrived at the conclusion that the cult did

not constitute a potentially dangerous instrumentality in the

event of a national emergency and that active participation in

the affairs thereof and adherence to its basic tenets were

insufficient io consider an individual potentially dangerous,

this Bureau would immediately review the cases of the security

Inaes subjects for appropriate action and that; in the meantime,

the individuäl list of security Index subjects was not being

referred to the Department for review. i li

While I still feel that the basic problem involved. has

not been resolved, it is noted that the Department indicates: that

the reappraisal is being made. of the case on the basis of a

The Chicago Office has submitted a comprehensive

summary report of 326 pages concerning the

ectivities

of the Muslim Cult of Islam (MCI).

The MCI was reportedly organized in 1930 in Detroit,

Michigan.

The national leader since 1933 Is Elijab Mohammed

who claims to have been

222 ga

sent by Allah, the supreme Being,

to lead the Negroes out of slavery in

the United states.

Members of the Cult fanatically follow the alleged teachings

of Allah as interpreted by Elijah Mohammed and disavow allegiance

to the United States.

Members pledge allegiance only to

Allah and Islam and believe that any civil law which conflicts

with Muslim law should be disobeyed. The Cult teaches

that members of the colored race cannot be considered citizens

of the United States since they are in slavery in this country

and must free themselves by destroying non-Muslims and

Christianity in the coming x"War of Armageddon." For this

purpose the cult has a military branch called the, Fruit of

Islam" composed of all able-bodied i

in military drill and judo training.

The Department has advised the Bureau by letters

dated 2/9/53 and 1/26/55 that evidence presently available

in this case is insufficient to establish a violation of the

Smith Act, a conspiracy to violate the Smith Act or Iltle 18,

* IU.S. Code 2384 (Seditious Conspiracy)..

In view of the fanatical beliefs of the MCI and

the tense racial situation that exists today, it is believed

we should send the Department this summary report and the

exhibits thereto with the request that this material be

reviewed to determine if the activities of the MCI are in

Iviolation of any Federal statutes within the Bureau's jurisdiction.

The original of the attached memorandum

dated

September re

1955, to Assistant Attorney General Iomphins,

was delivered personally by me on September & to dr.

Tompkins. I advised him that in our correspondence with

the Department on the Muslim Cult of Islam, we had the

distinet impression that the Depariment has not thoroughly

reviewed the file and all investigative reports on this

organization, I pointed out that there are approvimately

I50 persons on the security Index who are connected with

this cult and that the question involved is whether the

Department has sufficiently reviewed the file to arrive

at a conclusion as to unether membership in a leadership

or active capacity in the "Fruit of IsIam"

the military section of the cult), should be considered

dangerous in the event of an emergencyo

I told AT. Tompkins

thai if the Department comes to the conclusion such persons

will not be dangerous in an emergencys this Bureau would

immediately review the cases of the security Inder subjects

Por appropriate action and that in the meantime the individual

List of security Index subjects is not being rejerred to the

Department for review.

I advised Mr. Tomplins that the memorandum of.

Septembery sets forth several incidents, together with the

background of this organization, wich reflect the need for

a careful review by the Departmento

bro Tompkins agreed

and stated that a thorough review would be made and that he

As result of action taken by the department to remove three

members of the luslim cult of Islam (MCI),

all Government employees,

from the security Index, we directed a letter to the Department August 8,

1955, requesting aduice as to (1) whether we should continue to conduct

security-tupe investigations of the leaders and active participating

members of the MCI and particularly the members of the fruit of Islam (FOI),

the military arm of the cult, to determine wnether the names of such

individuals should be added

to the security Index and (2) whether the

names of all members of the MoI currently on the security Index should

be removed from the security Index.

• ? '

With respect to the questions posed to the Department, the

Department advised (1) that the bureau should continue to conduct

security-type inuestigations of the leaders and active participating

members of the McI and (2) that an individual review and evaluation

of derogatory information reported on each of the leaders and active

participating menbers of the cult must be conducted to ascertain whether

as individuals, they should be removed from the security Inder or should

continue to be

included, based on substantidevidence of each respective

individual's anarchist and revolutionary activities and beliefs, as

members of the cult. The Department further noted that on the basis of

available infornation the anarchist and revolutionary statements

reportedly made by a single minister of the cult are not of such scope as

to indicate an aim or purpose of the cult as enunciated by the prophet

and leader, Elijah Mohanned, for uniforn compliance by all MoI temple

ministers.

The Department concludes that statements and activities on the

part of individual members of the cult indicating anarchist and revolu

tionary beliefs, will be determining factors in determining whether or not

such individual members come within the revised security Index criteria.

The Department requests that a complete list of the names and FBI file

numbers of the members of the uci currently included in the security

Index be made available and that the Internal security Division be kept

informed of the individual members' activities on a continuing basis in

order that their cases may be reviewed or re reviewed in light of any new

evidence or information developed.

Memorandum for ur. Boaraman:

Thumbnail Sketch of the uCI:

Reliable informants report that this cult is an organization

composed entirely of Negroes which was reportedly organized around

1930 in Detroit, Michigan. The national leader and founder is

Elijah Mohammed who claims to have been sent by allah to lead the Negroes

out of slavery in the United States. Members fanatically follow the

alleged teachings of Allah as interpreted by lohammed and disavou

allegiance to the United states.

Members pledged allegiance only to

Allah and Islam and believe any civil law which conflicts with Muslim

law should be disobeyed. The cult teaches that members of the dart

skinned race cannot be considered citizens of the United states since

they are in slavery in this country and, thereforenmar of Armageddon. "

must free themselves

by destroying non-uuslims and Christianity in the

this purpose the cult has a military branch called the Fruit of Islam

composed of all male able-bodied members who participate in military

drill and judo training. lembers of the cult also believe that they

are directly related to all Asiatic nations and any conflict involving

any Asiatic nation and the Western nations is considered a part of the

War of Armageddon in which the Asiatic nation will be victorious.

Instances of Violence Against Police Authority: •

on several occasions the primitive hatred with which members

are so imbued, exploded into open violence.

In June 1950 the Detroit

Police, in attempting to solve a traffic problem, were assaulted by a

number of Negroes in front of the Temple of Islam. The officers had

their night sticks taken away, were forced to use firearms,

and were

given a severe beating by the assembled Negroes.

These Negroes were

identified as members of the Muslim cult of Islam.

Another incident occurred in september 1950 in san Diego,

involving two officers of the san Diego police Department who were

attempting to serve a traffic warrant. upon arrivingat the address

two individuals accosted the officers and aduised them the subject of the

warrant was not at home.

then the ms cod

When the officers exhibited the warrant and

expressed their intention of searching the house, they were ruthlessly

attacked. This perpetrated a near riot and necessitated the calling

out of additional-cars and approximately twenty officers. Before the

subject was taken into custody and order was restored, an unknown

indiuidual fired three shots into a police car.

It was later determined

that the subject and the two individuals wno intercepted the officers

were all members of the san Diego Temple of the Muslim Cult of IslaM.

Lemorandum for Mr. Boardman:

In february, 1951, another incident occurred which involved

a disturbance between members of the cult who were en route to the

yearly convention in chicago. Members of the Montgomery County Police

in silver spring, Maryland, were alerted. Four policemen who met the

train and entered the car were assaulted and had their guns and

blackjacks taken away from them by members of the cult.

This

necessiated a call for police reinforcements, and nine members of the

cult were removed to the station and charged with assault.

Opposition to Federal Authority:

such open defiance is not relegated merely to local authority.

In view of the stand this organization has taken in connection with

service in the armed forces,

members have consistently,

since the

passage of the selective Iraining and service Act of 19410, adhered to the

-teachings of their leaders in refusing to reguster,

because they claim

"to be registered in the book of Allah in the Holy City of Mecca and

cannot serve two masters.

In 1942, three leaders of the fCI, including

Elijah lohammed, and seventy members of the Chicago Temple were arrested

by Agents of the Bureau. The charges leveled against the leaders included

failure to register for selective seruice, sedition and counseling their

followers "that members of the Temple of Islam should not go into the

Army and should ignore any cards or letters from the local draft board."

The indictments returned for sedition and conspiracy to commit sedition

were dismissed in way, 1943; however, the three leaders served prison

¿erns for selective service violations. of the seventy members arrested,

approximately forty served prison terms for violation of the selective

Training and Service Act of 1910.

During the course of the second world War and the war in Korea,

such incidents were repeated throughout the country, and a number of

convictions were secured for violations of the selective service acts;

!

and

now with the threut of hostilities in the far fast, the cult has

again taken an open stand against service in the armed forces of the

United States.

They continue to include in their teachings such

' information as:

The black people have always been helping

the devil by fighting in his wars, but the

Muslims do not go to war but rather to jail.

Those who register will be kicked out of

the nation of Islam

and will die with the

white devils.

Memorandum for Mr. Boardman:

Disloyalty and Disrespect for the United States Government:

Intertwined with defiance of the provisions of the selective

service acts is the vivid disloyalty to the Government and the continual

disrespect for its laws. such comments as lino 900d Muslim registers

for the draft, vote or do anything else in the Devil's government, " are

repeatedly made throughout the various temples. In 1942, Elijah

Mohammed,

the leader of this cult, described the American flag as follows: "The

flag you see, here is the flag of the white devil. The white that you

see, and notice that you don't see any black. any where on it, represents

the white race; the red represents the blood that they lose keeping it for

the white deurl alone, the blue background,

the white stars represent

justice to the whites, not the red men or

the black men but only for

the white devils."

When the united states was at war with Japan, the cult considered

the Japanese their "little brown brothers" and gleefully predicted

the victory of the land of the Rising sun. At the outbreak of the war

in korea, the cult immediately allied its sympathies and spoke in

glowing terms of the strength of their korean brothers.

They have

States and Russia.

Observations:

Based upon an analysis of the rabid teachings of this group, it

acts which would subvert American principles and endanger the existence

of the American nation as such.

such a potential threat could materialize

by actual violence against civil authorities prior to a national

emergency as has been done by the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico or

by seizing upon the opportunity presented by a national emergency to

commit acts of violence based upon their hatred and disloyalty to the

Government of the United States.

Our instructions to the field are that

security-type investigations are to be conducted on individual members

of the cult who are reported to be (1) functionaries or leaders of the

Cult; (2) members of the military section of the cult known as the

"Fruit of Islam' or (3) active participants in carrying out fanatical

and disloyal aims and

purposes of the cult. Individuals affiliated with

the cult have been retained in

the security Index after careful evaluation

of their activities in furthering the violence and anarchist aims and

purposes of the cult under thut portion of the revised security Index

Memorandum for MT. Boardman:

criteria which reads "investigation has developed information that the

individual though not a member or a participant in the activities of

a subversive organization has anarchist or revolutionary beliefs and is

likely to seize upon the opportunity presented by a national

emergency to. endanger the public safety as shown by overt acts or

statements within the last three years established through reliable

sources,

informants or individuals." As of the current date, we have

151 such individuals included in the security Index.

Extensive

investigation has been conducted of the activities of the organization

since 1942 and the numerous reports in the matter have been foruarded

to the Department.

It appears from the comments contained in the

Department memorandum of August 23, 1955,

that an analysis of the

potential dangerousness of this organization and its menbers has not

been the subject of a thorough study by the Depariment. The Domestic

Intelligence

Division feels that we should cite the information set

out previously herein and specifically draw the attention of the

Department to the organizational reports submitted concerning the

Huslim cult of Islam, and request the Department to reconsider its

stand in this matter. If the department has

a: technical legal

reason jor not desiring the names of these individuals included in

the security Index, it is felt that we should be so informed.

RECOMENDATIONS:

(1) If you approve,

there is attached a proposed letter to

the Department along the lines mentioned above.

(2)

It is recommended that we not furnish the Depariment a

list

of the 151 individuals, ucI members, included in the security

Index pending reconsideration by the departmento

(3) The Department's correspondence indicates it has not thoroughly

reviewed the entire file on the Muslim cult but it is basing its opinion

on the statement of one minister.

If you agree, Belmont will deliven

the attached letter to Tompkins

or reagley and point out the necessar al

for the department to thoroughly review the gule on this organization l

prior to any decision as to the individual members.

including Confidential Infomants los and Tos of the referonced SA lally

report, the Buresu advised on Septenber 2, 1954 that Contidential Informant

Toll is erailable to testify bus is known to havo fumished false intormation

on one occasion, and advised further that Confidontial Informant To in not

aveslable to testifyo In addition, the Bureau advised on March 3, 1955,

that Confidential Informant Tol was being changed fron "of laow reliability"

to "oi unnown rellability"

In this connection, & Bureau report on ASBUHY WILIAMS dated Septembes

I, Losu, reilocted the records of the federa, Correcion, Institute a6

15n, Machigan, as Lollows:

"The subjeet as described in 1943 as exhibiting

no evidence of major psychological or neuropsychiatric

disorders. A diagnosis of the subject aù that time

indicated that he exhibited a constitutional psychopathic

inferiorly vith psychosia. His mental deficiency is

noted as "familial, border line typo". He was described

as & *constitutional psychopathic state • paranoid

personality'."

The Burenu report further deseribad WILLJAMS as being of inferior intelligence

wich a mental age of between ten and eleven gears of age with an I.lo ol

seventy to sevend iine,

In light of this later acquirad information, the conclusions of our

He further stated that the fanaticism of the MCI members appears

to be of such an extreme degree as to render possible an out

break of violence by Cult members which might be similar in

nature to the attempted assassination of the members of the

House of Representatives by the Puerto Rican Nationalists.

OBSERVATIONS:

The conclusion reached by Mr. Tompkins in regard to

the three Federal Government employees in regard to the dangerousness

of the individuals or the anarchist and violent aims and purposes

of the MCI appears contrary to the observations in his memorandum

of August 10, 1954.

Individuals deemed dangerous because of anarchist

or revolutionary acts or statements have been placed in the

Security Index both under the old Security Index criteria and

the revised criteria, even though there is no affiliation with

the CP or other Marxist revolutionary groups. The criteria

clearly spelled out this situation.

The radical group of Negroes who are members of the

MCI are lead by Elijah Mohammed.

The members disavow

allegiance to the United States and pledge allegiance only to

Islam.

They do not consider it their duty to register for

Selective Service.

themselves. This Cult presents a threat to the internal security

Miss Gan'-r

CONT

This refers to my memorandur of September &, 1953 werein

you were advised that pursuant to your request a review of the

material submitted on the above subject would be made for the

purpose of devermining whether prosecution will be authorized and

That

whother further investigation is desired with regard to the Selective

Service conspiracy phase of this case.

The Investigative reports reflect thst the Moslem Cult of

Islam is described by informants as a vicious and lamatical organi

zation composed of Negroes whose members disavor allegiance to the

United States and declare allegiance only to Islam and Allah's

Prophet, Mijah Mohamed.

The organization's rules imply civil dis

obedience to the laus of the United States while awaiting the annihi.

lation of the White Race in the Biblical reference to the "War of

Armageddon. "

il

In connection with Its policy of civil disobedience to

the laws of the United States, several instances bave been reported

where leaders of this Cult have, during the course of meetings, made

scatements to the effect that its members should not comply with the

Selective Service Laws and to disregard orders received fron their

respective local boards.

This attitude Is apparently in line with lts general

policy of opposition to civil authority and there is no specific

information developed which would establish that a conspiracy vas

formed for the purpose of evading or counseling evasion of service

in the Armed Forces of the United States.

OPIES DESTROYIO

85 NOV

23 1962

While there have been instances where individuals have

counseled such evasion, it could not be establishod that they were

acting as part of a conspiracy and, consequently, prosecution based

on this phase of the case is not varranted. In the circumstances,

on the part of the organization is desired at this time.

However, It

Is requested that individual instances of counseling evasion or refusal

to comply with Selective Service lawa be reported to the Criminal

Division.

Reference is made to your memorandum of December 30, 1952,

wherein you requested to be advised if the activities of the

captioned organization and its leaders constitute a violation of

the Smith Act of 1940. Your memorandum also requests advice as to

whether security-type investigations should be conducted regarding

the leaders and/or members of the Cult for consideration in connection

with the Security Index.

The file in this case has been reviewed and it is my opinion

that the evidence presently available is insufficient to establish a

violation of

the Smith Act or a conspiracy to violate said Act.

conclusion has been reached in spite of the fact that the leaders of

the Cult, in some measure at least, advocate the desirability of the

violent overthrow of the existing Government. However, such advocacy

is expressed more in the nature of a prophecy that such overthrow will

inevitably come about under the leadership of "Allah" in the "war of

Armageddon."

The organization appears to have no program of action

which reasonably would be calculated to bring about or attempt to

Averisis,

bring about the violent overthrow of the Government.

In addition,

MARITO

it is pointed out that the conclusion hereinabove expressed is to

a large extent influenced by my opinion that the evidence available

at this time is insufficient to establish such a "clear and present

danger" as is required to make application of the Smith Act consti-

tutional. Dennis v. United States, 341 U.S. 494.

I am, of course, keenly aware that an organization which

subscribes to and breeds on the fanatical beliefs of the Muslim Cult,

and which encourages bitter race prejudice and disloyalty to the

United States would, under certain circumstances, represent a serious

threat to our internal security.

CONFIDENTIAL, -

• Miss Gandy.

This is in response to your memorandum of December 28, 79515

with its attachment, in which you requested my views as to whether

the facts developed in the above matter warrant prosecution and also.

to be informed specifically of the extent of any further investigation

that is desirable.

The facts developed in the investigation to date are insuf-

ficient at this time to prove that men within the draft age have been

actually counseled, aided and abetted by members of the organization

to evade registration and/or service in the Armed Forces. However,

since the investigative report of November 28, 1951, reveals that

men within the critical age group may have been told by members of

the organization not to comply with the provisions of the Selective

Service Act and to disregard orders received from their respective

local draft boards, I believe that the investigation should be c

tinued. In connection therewith I suggest, upon investigation

subsequent Selective Service

violations by members of this

_cult,

*that

the delinquent be interviewed, as in the past, with a view to ascer.

taining whether his delinquency was the residt

being counseled by

a member or members of the organization. If this fact is established,

it is requested that you endeavor to secure the names of those present

at that time, the date of the conversation and its substance in detail.

The information available does not reflect a violation of the

Sedition Statute, 18 U.S.C. 2387, since it does not appear that the

subject group or the members thereof have advised, counseled, urged,

or in any manner caused or attempted to cause insubordination, dis-

loyalty, mutiny or refusal of duty by any member of the military or

naval forces of the United States.

which may subsequently become subject to criminal proceedings.

Promptly record all such information in interview report form.

(7)

Where there appears to be a possible violation

of a statute within the investigative jurisdiction of the

Bureau, the substantive violation character should be included

in subsequent communications and the possible violation

vigorously investigated in accordance with existing instructions.

(8) Particular attention must be paid to travel by

a KBE and every effort made to determine financial arrange-

ments for such travel. If a credit card is used, determine

Its validity and the amount being charged to that card on a

continuing basis.

Travel information must be subnitted to

the Bureau and interested offices by appropriate communication

to permit coverage of the KBE. It will be the responsibility

of the office of origin to insure that the activities of the

KBE are covered by auxiliary offices.

(9) The Federal income tax returns of all KBEs must

be checked annually in accordance with existing instructions.

If no investigative summary report has been submitted

in each case, such a report must be submitted to the Bureau by

2/15/71.

Thereafter, an investigative report should be sub-

mitted

at least every 90 days. Furthermore, appropriate

communications suitable for dissemination should be promptly

submitted in the interim to keep the Bureau fully advised of

the activities of each KBE. The words (Key Black Extremist )

should be included in the character of each communication

submitted except those communications (including reports)

which are prepared for dissemination.

Because of the'violence potential of all black extremists,

Leaders of

the violence-prone Black Panther Party have indicated that the

"revolution" is entering the beginning phases of actual armed

struggle and our investigations indicate there are certain extremists

more likely to resort to or to order terrorism as a tactic and

therefore require particular attention.

Intensified coverage to bring to bear the tatal capabil

warranted.

We should cover every facet of their

Re: Key Black Extremist Program

Inasmuch as KBE individuals are of the type who would be

subject to maximum investigative attention and close supervision,

the

administration and supervision of this program entails only a

minimum amount of time above that which would normally be

expended on these cases.

The continuing revolutionary activities of the individuals

designated as KBEs warrant the close investigative and supervisory

attention required by the KBE program. This program will be

reevaluated in December, 1972.

States who were extremely active and posed the greatest

potential for revolutionary activity. The program's objective was

to develop complete and detailed information on their day-to-day

It is recommended this KBE concept be revised into a KE

program, which would encompass the activities of all extremist

A preliminary anolysis of the Key Extremist Program. (KEP)

by FBIIQ, including discussions with supervisory and investigative

personnel who have been attending special Extremist Matters In-

Service classes, indicates that constant investigative attention is

not always being afforded individuals who

have been designated as

Key Extremists. . All offices are reminded that KEP was instituted

i in

1970 as the Key Black Extremist Program to provide guidelines for

Intensive investigation of certain black extremist leaders and

activists whose endorsement and/or involvement in revolutionary and

terrorist activity warranted priority attention.

In January, 1973,

the program was redesignated KEP and revised to include key

white-hate

Klan-type extremists and American Indian extremists in addition to

black extremists.

There are approximately 90 individuals throughout

the country currently designated as Key Extremists in some 27 field

offices.

Specific instructions as to the nature and extent of

investigation to be conducted on Key Extremists are outlined in

Manual of Instructions, Section 122 A, Item 5, Pages 5 and 6, and

Re:. Key Extremist Program

157-8415

In order to make a thorough overall analysis and

reevaluation of the KEP at FBIHQ and to assist each office in .

analyzing the effectiveness of its own program, the following survey

is to be conducted:

I.

Each office is to examine pending cases on individual

extremists (black, white-hate Klan-type, and American Indian) within

its territory to insure all who warrant designation as a Key Extremist

are so designated and those individuals currently designated as Key

Extremists varrant retention as same. By airtel to reach the Bureau

by 7/2/73 under the caption "Key Extremist Program,

Division,

Extremist Matters," advise the Bureau that this survey has been

completed and identify appropriate individual extremists by name,

character, Bureau and field file numbers under the following self-

explanatory captions:

A. 'Individuals Currently Designated Key Extremists"

B. "Individuals Designated Key Ixtremists Who Ho Longer

Warrant Retention as a Key. Extremist"

C. "Individuals Who Warrant Designation as a Key Extremist"

If the ansver under any one of the three captions is "None," so

state.

II. Those offices with individual extremists listed under

above captions' B and C, submit by the same date in airtel form

under the individual's case castion your recoruendation for inclusion

or deletion of that individual from the KEP. Full justification

should be set out and Bureau will act on your reconmendation.

III. Those offices with current individual Key Extremists

(caption A above) submit by the same date in airtel form under

the individual case caption the answer

to the following questions,

by number, relative to that individual:

Re: Key Extremist Program

Is the subject included on the ADEX? If not, and

recommendation to include or to delete from the old ADE

criteria has not yet been submitted, submit your recommendation

to include or delete pronntly with full justification in accord-

sance with current instructions. If a recommendation has been

submitted and the individual has not been included or has been

deleted, so state.

2. Is the subject included in the Extremist Photogrash

Album?

If not, immediately submit Form ED-432 for inclusion

therein.

3. Outline the nature of the coverage you have of subject's

finances, specifically indicating if bank accounts are or are

not being monitored.

It bank accounts are not being monitored,

give reasons therefor.

•4. If warranted, has the Bureau been specifically

requested to obtain subject's tar returns?

If not, give your

reasons for not considering this investigative step.

5.

Have you developed or placed an informant close to

the subject? If so, identify such informant(s) by symbol

number, indicate his relationship to the subject, and succinctly

summarize the type of information informant is in a position to

furnish.

6. Have handwriting specimens been obtained and filed in

the National Security File of the FBI laboratory?

7. Have fingerprints been filed in the Single Fingerprint

File, Latent Fingerprint Section, of the Identification Division?

8: Have you been successful in obtaining a written record

or a witness's statement of inflammatory and/or revolutionary-

type writings or statements by the subject?

Re: Key Extremist Program

9. Has a full. and thorough background investigation

been completed on the subject?

If the answers to questions number 5 through 9 above are

in the negative, outline in another paragraph immediately under the

answer the specific steps underway or being instituted by your

office to fulfill this investigative requirement.

Some confusion regarding Key Extremists has arisen over

the new ADIX criteria outlined in Memorandum to A11 SACs 21-72 dated

9/12/72. This revised criteria make it possible to have an extremist

who warrants designation as a Key Extremist and yet does not meet the

new criteria for inclusion on the ADEX. Such individuals may continue

to be designated as Key Extremists.

Additional confusion has also arisen over reporting require-

ments which were relaxed by above-mentioned Memorandm to All. SACs.

Hereafter, individuals designated as Key Extremists are to be consirered

as exceptions to the above memorandum under Item 4d, Page 8, and reports

on Key Extremists are to be regularly submitted every 90 days. If no

report has been submitted on a Key Extremist within the past 90 days,

promptly prepare and submit an up-to-date report and submit fo110w-up

reports thereafter on a 90-day basis.

Section 122 of the Manual of Instructions is being revised

to outline more clearly the criteria for designating black, white-hate

Klan-type, and American Indian extremists as Key Extremists as well as

the ADEX status of and reporting procedures

for Key Extremists.

All offices insure in the future that hew cases on individual

extremists are carefully scrutinized to see if they warrant designation

as a Key Extremist, and that an appropriate recommendation is promptly

submitted to the Bureau.

no longer warrant designation as such, the identity of individual

extremists who should be designated Key Extremists, and to deter-

mine if required investigative steps are being followed with respect

to those individuals designated as Key Extremists.

Originally, all Key Extremists were to be included in the

ADEX.

Recent changes in ADEX criteria require an individual included

therein to be dangerous now to national security and some confusion

has resulted in the field over whether or not Key Extremists must be

removed as Key Extremists if they do not qualify for ADEX. The field

is being instructed that this is not necessary and an individual can

be a Key Extremist and still not qualify for ADAX. Confusion also

exists as to when reports are to be submitted on. Key Extremists due

to recent relaxation of reporting rules. Original instructions

required reports on Key Extremists every 90 days and this is being

reiterated.

We currently have throughout the United States a total of

90 individual extremists designated as Key Extremists in 27 separate

field offices. The New York Office has 19 and the San Francisco

Office has 16. The number of Key Extremists in the remaining 25

offices range from one to eight. The results of analysis by each

field office will be thoroughly analyzed and evaluated by the IS - 1

Section with additional instructions issued, if warranted.

ACTION:

If you approve, the attached airtel to all offices in line

with the above will be sent.

Purpose of this memorandum is to justify continuation

of the Key Extremist Program.

This program was initiated 12/23/70. to intensify

investigative coverage of selective black extremists throughout

the United States who were extremely active and posed the

greatest potential for revolutionary activities.

The program's

objective was to develop complete and detailed information on

their day-to-day activities and future plans. On 1'4/73, this

program was expanded to include non-black extremist subjects.

Individuals designated Key Extremists (KE) are con-

sidered for the ADEX; a biographical sketch with photo is

included in the Extremist Photo Album; all aspects of financés

are determined; handwriting specimens

are placed in the National

Security File in the Laboratory Division: fingerprints are

included in the Identification Division's Single Fingerprint

File; all possible criminal violations are vigorously pursued;

emphasis is placed on obtaining records of revolutionary state-

ments. In addition, particular attention is paid to their

travel and high level informant coverage is required on each

individual.

T.EC- 106

15y C -459

Ninety individuals were initially designated under

this program but with additions and deletions, and as a result

of an annual review, this number is now 68.

API : ..

Inasmuch as KE individuals are of the type who would

be subject to maximum investigative attention and close:.•

supervision, the administration and sunervision of this program

entails only a minimum amount of time above that which would be

normally expended on these cases.

The KEP was initiated 12/23/70 to intensify

investigative coverage of selected black extremists

throughout the United States who were extremely active and

posed the greatest potential for revolutionary activities.

The Program's objective was to develop complete and detailed

information on their day-to-day activities and future plans.

On 1/4/73 the Program was expanded to include nonblack

extremist subjects.

Justice

The Program indicates a current decline in these

selected extremists as evidenced in December, 1972, there

were 94 individuals included in Program; 72 individuals in

• December of 1973; and 51 individuals at the present time.

The Program currently reflects the result of

streamlining our investigative procedures. We are now

able to give special attention to extremist subjects

through individual supervision and it is no longer necessary

to continue a special

program..

In view of our current procedures,

the remaining

51 individuals who are designated Key Extremists are

included, as a requirement of the KEP, on the ADEX. We ca

are able to concentrate on these individuals through our

RACIAL INFORMANTS

RACIAL MATTERS

In view of increasing problems with which we are

faced in the overall racial field, particularly in the

development of racial intelligence concerning militant

black nationalist elements, we have carefully analyzed

informant program to place proper emphasis where needed.

our fei,

Although we are making progress in developing racial sources

in the ghettos, we feel we can do much more and must do so

rapidly in the

coming six months to be prepared for another

potential summer of violence.

Proposed SAC letter attached.

To accomplish our objective of thorough penetration

of the ghettos with a network of quality sources under a

crash program, the following procedures will be instituted to

carry out this program.

The individuals we will be con-

tacting under this crash informant program will be living in

the ghettos; therefore, in the absence of any derogatory in

formation developed, background investigation should consist

ot a check of field office indices, Bureau indices, FBI

Identification Division records, and local credit and arrest

records. Of course,

prior to instituting any background

investigation to qualify a ghetto informant, he must be in a

position to furnish racial information and must be willing

to cooperate with the Bureau. This individual will be carried

as a probationary racial informant and the Agent contacting

him will be constantly alert for any indications of character

traits or activities which might cause embarrassment to the

In addition, the information furnished by such an

informant will not be taken on'face value but will be verified

through other sources and investigation where possible.

In addition, we are specifically instructing that

security informants active in the racial field be designated

as racial informants and that their activities be supervised

by the Racial Informant Desk.

We are also reiterating our

instructions that it is imperative and essential that the

Bureau learn of any advance planning or organized conspiracy

Memorandum to Mr. Sullivan

Re: Racial Informants

on the part of individuals or organizations in connection

with riots and racial disturbances.

We are also reiterating

the instructions that informants should be alerted and di-

rected to obtain information concerning individuals who may

situations.

In connection with our intensive investigation of

black militant groups, we are requiring all offices engaged

in the Black Nationalist Groups TOPLEV Informant Program

(There are 35 field offices involved in this Program.) to

assign a minimum of one Agent to work exclusively on infor-

mant matters.

The results of this endeavor will be reviewed

after a three-month pilot period and additional recommenda-

tions will be made accordingly. The field will be followed

closely to insure that the number and quality of racial in-

formants are developed at a regular rate.

RECOMMENDATION:

That attached proposed letter to all Special Agents

in Charge concerning the above be approved. It this proposed

SAC letter is approved, the appropriate Manual changes will

be made.

(G) RACIAL INFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS -- In view of the in-

creasing problems with which we are faced in the racial field, particularly

in the development of racial intelligence concerning militant black

nationalist elements, a careful analysis of this matter has been made in

order to insure that proper emphasis is placed where needed. Also, in

order to afford better coordination over all interrelated racial security

matters (individuals and organizations) including the development of

racial informants, supervision is now being handled by the Racial

Intelligence Section of the Domestic Intelligence Division. For your

information, the Subversive Control Section is no longer in existence.

The investigation of the Communist Party and related matters other

than those with a racial aspect are being handled by the Internal Security

Section.

Our analysis of the racial informant program has shown

there is a definite need to develop additional penetrative coverage of the

militant black nationalist groups and the ghetto areas immediately to

be in a position to have maximum intelligence in anticipation of another

outburst of racial violence next summer.

In line with our objective, particular emphasis is being

placed on the development of ghetto-type racial informants. Individuals

to qualify as this type of informant must live or work in an area described

as a ghetto and, therefore, have access to pertinent racial information.

The steps necessary to qualify such an individual are as follows:

(1) The individual must have access to racial intelligence

information and must be willing to cooperate with the Bureau in furnish-

ing such information.

(2) In the absence of any derogatory information developed,

it will be necessary for you to check the following: field office indices,

FBI Identification Division records, and local credit and arrest records.

Of course, you must develop sufficient background data concerning each

prospective informant to allow an intelligent check of the foregoing

records to be made. As to the method of recommending to the Bureau

that an individual be approved as a racial informant (ghetto-type), be

guided by the instructions set out in Section 130, Volume IV, Manual

of Instructions, concerning probationary racial informants.

All individuals recommended and approved as ghetto-type

racial informants will be considered probationary racial informants

with the word "ghetto" after the informant's name or symbol. An

example of this is "John Jones, Probationary Racial Informant (Ghetto)"

or "NY 1234-R (PROB - Ghetto). "

Agents handling these ghetto-type probationary racial inform-

ants must be constantly alert for any indications of character traits or

activities of these informants which might cause embarrassment to the

Bureau. In addition, the information furnished by these informants

should not be taken at face value. A diligent attempt must be made

to verify all information furnished by these informants through other

sources and/or investigation.

in addition, immediately review all security informant files

for the purpose of determining which security informants are solely or

predominantly active in the racial field. Examples would be individuals

furnishing information concerning the Minutemen, as well as the Nation

of Islam, Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, Congress of

Racial Equality, and other militant black nationalist-type groups. The

security designation of these informants should be changed to the

appropriate racial informant designation. For example, a potential

security informant should be made a probationary racial informant and

a security informant should be designated as a racial informant. There-

after, they should be operated principally in the racial field and super-

vised by the Racial Informant Desk. When an informant is changed from

a security informant to a racial informant, the field classification

number should be changed to a 170 classification. Advise the Bureau

promptly as to which security informants are being converted to racial

informants.

In addition, each office having a Black Nationalist Groups

TOPLEV Informant Program is to immediately assign at least one

Agent to work exclusively on developing informants under this Program.

Each office participating in this Program will submit at the end of a

three-month period appropriate observations as to the success of the

Program and recommendations as to its continuance.

As I have advised in the past, it is imperative and essential

that the Bureau learn of any indications of advance planning or organized

conspiracy on the part of individuals or organizations in connection

with riots and racial disturbances. You are again reminded that

informants should be alerted and directed to obtain information con-

cerning individuals who may be stockpiling firebombs, Molotov cocktails,

weapons, and to identify any groups of terrorists who may be planning

on carrying out a type of guerrilla warfare during riotous situations.

I expect each office to give this most important matter

priority attention in order to achieve our goal during the next six

months. Your efforts and results will be followed closely at the Bureau

and during field Inspections. Appropriate Manual changes will be

forthcoming.

On May 16, 1968, the Executive Conference, consisting

of Messrs. DeLoach, Mohr,

Sullivan, Tavel, Casper, Callahan,

Trotter, Conrad, Gale, Bishop, Scatterday for Rosen, Walters

for Felt, and Beaver, considered a recommendation by Assistant

Director Sullivan that a survey be made of the Negro ghetto

areas where violence has occurred or where there is a concen-

tration of militant, violence-prone, black power elements in

order to determine

the racial informant coverage in those areas.

Complete details are set out in attached memorandum and proposed

letter to all continental offices dealing with this matter.

Basically, the purpose of this survey is to enable both the

the Bureau to evaluate the adequacy of informant

coveyage in reede areas and to pinpoint iseas in which anded

coverage is needed.

This assignment could be completed in each office

by one Agent.

in less than one day. from information already

available in each field division, it being noted that on every

inspection the inspector requires the field to identify its

ghetto areas.

Following consideration, the Executive Conference

unanimously recommended that this

survey be conducted.

The purpose of this memorandum is to recommend

approval for the attached letter to all continental field

divisions which contains instructions to furnish to the

Bureau information concerning ghetto-type informant coverage

in Negro ghetto areas where there has been violence or where

today there is a concentration of militant violence prone

black power elements and the adequacy of such

coverage.

By SAC Letter 67-62 (G) dated 10/17/67 captioned

"Racial Informants, Racial Matters," all offices were given

instructions and guidelines for the development of ghetto-type

racial informants in areas where potential racial violence

exists. We have aggressively followed this matterwith the

field since that time but because of the widely divergent

nature of cities across the Nation where possible racial

problems exist, we have been unable to precisely evaluate the

extent of the need of ghetto-type informants in each division.

Attached letter to all continental offices requires the submission

by each office of factual information concerning the numbers

of all Negro ghetto areas where there has been violence or

where today there is a concentration of militant violence prone

black power elements, an estimate of the population of each

such area, and statistics concerning the numbers of ghetto-type

racial intormants developed to cover such areas. It also

informants it believes it should have in each of the above

type ghetto areas in order to provide the coverage required

by the Bureau.

Memorandum to Mr. W. C. Sullivan

RE: RACIAL INFORMANTS

Attached letter will serve two purposes. Each

office will have to make a factual survey of pertinent

aspects of the racial problem in all urban areas covered

by it. This survey will serve to drive home to each office

the size of the potential problem in each division and will

force each office to formulate concrete plans for developing

adequate informant coverage where such has not already been

done.

Secondly, the information submitted by each office

will

give the Bureau a comprehensive picture of the potential

problem in each division which will enable the Bureau to

more effectively evaluate the adequacy of the ghetto-type

racial informant program in each office. Supervisory personnel

will be able to more easily detect shortcomings and weaknesses

in any given division with this information at hand.

To obtain the information requested by this letter

should not be a burden on the field in that it should only

take the time of one Agent for less than one day to compile

the information concerning the ghetto areas from the information

already available in the field divisions. It is to be noted

that on every inspection the inspector requires the field

to identify its ghetto areas and those areas having a potential

for violence.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the attached proposed letter to all continental

field offices in accordance with the above, be approved.

RE: RACIAL INFORMANTS

For your guidance, the goal you should be setting

as

to how many ghetto informants are needed in a particular

area is that your coverage should be such that you are completely

knowledgeable concerning all pertinent racial activities in a

particular area.

The type of information you should be receiving

from your ghetto informants is advance information as to whether

anyone is planning to cause a racial disturbance, stockpiling

weapons for use during a racial disturbance, full details

concerning the activitles or militant black nationalists and

white extremists in ghetto areas, as well as any other activities

which may bring about a racial disturbance.

I expect that immediate attention will be given this

matter and I also expect that the Bureau will be kept advised

of progress being made in this field. Progress will be followed

closely and the desired results are expected to be produced.

PURPOSE:

To obtain authority to send the attached letter to

all Special Agents in Charge changing the maximum permissible

period between contacts with ghetto-type racial informants

from two weeks, as presently required by the Manual of

Instructions, to one month.

BACKGROUND:

The ghetto-type racial informant program was

established in October, 1967, to develop sources living or

working in ghetto areas who are in a position to keep the

Bureau advisedof situations of potential violence. Ghetto-

type racial informants are distinguished from regular racial

informants in that they are not associated with or reporting

regularly on black extremists. Their primary purpose is to

detect and report on all violence-prone elements, activities,

and situations in ghetto areas which could spark riots or

assist black extremists in any way.

REGULAR RACIAL INFORMANTS STILL CONTACTED AT LEAST EVERY

TWO WEEKS:

No change in present Manual of Instructions require-

ments that regular racial informants be contacted

at least

once every

two weeks is contemplated. Because of the rapport

established with ghetto-type racial informants, the field is

often able to direct such informants into membership in or

association with black extremist groups.

When such is the

Intormants to regular racial informants.

If approval is given

to extend the maximum period between contacts with established

hetto-type racial informants to one month, any such intorman

no 1s converted to a regular racial informant will again be

subject to the requirement that he be contacted at least once

every two weeks.

OBSERVATIONS:

Laborers,

clerks, housewives, businessmen, anc

numerous other types of individuals are developed as ghetto-

type racial informants. Frequent initial contacts with each

such individual are necessary (1) to establish adequate rapport,

(2) to insure that each such individual is fully aware of the

nature of and the seriousness of his assignments, and (3) to

establish adequate channels of communications suitable for

use at any time.

Once these goals are achieved, the informant

can be considered established and contacts every two weeks are

no longer necessary since the primary purpose of each such

informant is to remain alert to information of value and promptly

relay same. Once a ghetto-type racial informant is established,

contacts once each month will be adequate.

To definitely fix

the time at which a ghetto-type racial informant is considered

establisned, the Special Agent handling this informant will be

required to place a memorandum in informant's file stating

that requirements (1),

(2), and (3), mentioned above, have been

met and

that informant is considered established.

SAVINGS FROM LENGTHENING PERIOD BETWEEN CONTACTS:

As of August 1, 1968, there were 3,248 ghetto-

type racial informants developed by the field.

of this type are developed daily.

Since Special Agents handling

this type informant are presently required to contact each such

individual at least once every two weeks, there are a minimum

of 6,496 contacts being made each month.

Even if a contact

lasts but a few minutes,

the manpower expenditure is considerable.

If the maximum permissible period between contacts is extended

to one month, manpower expenditures will be cut in half.

(E) RACIAL INFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS -- Effective immediately,

the maximum permissible period between contacts with established ghetto-

type racial informants is extended from two weeks to one month. Prior

to the time that you consider an individual as an established ghetto-type

informant, you must continue to make contacts with that individual at

least once every two weeks. A ghetto-type racial informant is to be

considered established only after he has been contacted a sufficient

number of times (1) to insure that good rapport exists between the con-

tacting Special Agent and the individual concerned, (2) to insure that the

individual concerned is fully aware of the nature and seriousness of the

matters assigned to him, and (3) to establish adequate channels of com-

munication suitable for use at any time. To definitely fix the time at

which a ghetto-type racial informant is considered established, the

Special Agent handling the informant must place a memorandum in

informant's file stating that requirements (1), (2), and (3), mentioned

above, have been met.

Purpose of this memorandum is to obtain approval Ior

potential from its network of ghetto informants.

We are presently operating 4,469 ghetto informants

throughout the United States.

These informants are producing

valuable racial information on a regular basis. For example, during

the past year ghetto informants were able to furnish information

which was given to the local police and was helpful in containing

racial disturbances. In addition, since April, 1969, our informants

have been responsible for bringing about the arrest of 283

individuals (195 local

arrests) and have been.

responsible for solving 63 other cases, and recoveries valued

at $82,038.40.

Although the ghetto informant program is producuive,

a

review has clearly shown that certain field offices are getting

far more results from their ghetto informants than others.

In

view of this it is believed every frecolffice should analyze

their program.

The attached letter to all continental field offices

instructs each field office to analyze their ghetto intormant

program and we are furnishing: several guidelines for their

assistance in this reevaluation. The purpose of this reevaluation

is to insure that their ghetto informants are producing information

on a regular basis.

The Ghecto Racial Informant Program was instituted

on 10/11/67 for the purpose of obtaining information concerning

situations in the ghettos which might erupt into racial violence

as well as for the purpose of obtaining information concerning

extremist activity in the ghetto areas. This program has been

productive to date; however, a review of the program in the

various field divisions has shown that certain field divisions

are getting more results from their ghetto informants than

others. In view of this, each field division should analyze

its - particular ghetto racial informant program to insure that

its

informants are producing information on a regular basis.

In the event an informant is not producing information on a

The attendees at the recent Specialized Training of

¡Bureau Personnel conferences concerning informant matters recommended

that instructions be furnished to the field to the effect that

they will be actively seeking racial information on a regular basis.

The Ghetto Informant Program was instituted in July, 1967,

in order that the Bureau would have access to pertinent racial

information in the ghetto areas in anticipation of outbursts of

racial violence. This program has proven to be very successful;

however, it was noted that some field divisions were operating

their ghetto informants as listening posts and other divisions

were actively operating the ghetto informants by giving them

positive assignments.

5-Deaneri

It is noted we are presently operating 4,520 ghetto

informants and it is essential that we have some operated as

listening posts but we would also achieve greater efficiency

if the greater number of these informants were given positive

assignments in the racial field.

These assignments would include

attendance at public meetings held by extremists, surveys of

extremist bookstores, verification of residence and employment

of Agitator and Security Index subjects who may live or work

in ghetto areas, identification of extremists who may be agitating

in a local area, as well as furnishing information concerning the

activities of youth gangs operating in the area when these activities

may tend to increase racial tensions. In addition, ghetto informants

because of their access to criminal information, could furnish

information concerning both Federal and local crimes./

Index subjects who may live or work in ghetto areas,

identification of extremists who may be agitating in a local

area, as well as furnishing information concerning the

activities of youth gangs operating in the area when these

activities may tend to increase racial tensions.

It is recognized that certain individuals presently

being operated as ghetto informants would be more useful in

their role as listening posts; therefore, they should be

continued as such.

In line with the above, each ghetto racial informant

tile should be reviewed in connection with the regular review

of ghetto informant files in order to determine whether the informan

should be operated

as a listening post or whether he should be

given positive assignments as set out above.

In the future development of ghetto racial informants

you should strive to obtain quality ghetto informants,

particularly the type which can be operated so they will be

actively seeking racial information in their ghetto areas.

It is to be noted that when ghetto informants are furnishing

information on a regular basis concerning extremist activity

they should be designated as probationary racial informants

and the ghetto designation deleted. An aggressive and

Imaginative approach to the Ghetto Informant Program will

enhance the overall Racial Informant Program in every

field division by producing on a regular basis, individuals

who can be directed to positions where they will have access

to pertinent racial information on a regular basis.

have been exploring methods to administratively streanline this

program to reduce paperwork and

correspondence; in this regard

It was suggested during a recent Specialized Training of Bureau

Personnel conference concerning informant matters that we

discontinue the classification of probationary ghetto informants

and permit Special Agents in Charge to authorize and supervise

all chetto informants within their respective territories requir!

ing that only a number count be included in the monthly racial

informant progress letter.

Current policy requires that removal of the proba-

tionary status on ghetto informants be on Bureau authority

after notification that specific requirements have been met.

Proposed plan eliminates necessity for the probationary status

and.will place alt ghetto informants in one classification

upon completion of necessary requirements on SAC approval.

The recommended procedure will materially reduce correspondence

between the field and the Bureau. Additionally above

recommendation eliminates the necessity for the currently

required two-week contact with probationary ghetto informants

which was necessary at the beginning of the program and will

place all ghetto informants under a thirty-day contact rule

which we feel is more realistic at this time.

To obtain authority to revise current policy with regard

to maintenance of subfiles concerning ghetto informants.

As a result of recent specialized training of Bureau

personnel conferences concerning racial matters, it was recomnended

that the maintenance of field office subfiles concerning ghetto in-

; i

formants be left to the option of the Special Agent in Charge (SAC).

Current policy requires that reports written or oral

(reduced to writing) from racial informants including ghetto

informants be filed in a field office subfile. Many ghetto

informants serve only as "listening posts" and often furnish only!

information to the effect all is quiet. This type of information

is considered positive information and

according to current re-

quirements a copy of the report should be placed in the informant

subfile along with a copy in the racial situation control file.

In view of the nature of "listening past" type infor-

mation it is believed sufficient to place a copy of the report in

the racial situation control file, thereby eliminating the

necessity for its inclusion in a subfile. The above policy change

is considered a streamlining device materially reducing paper work

currently involved in the maintenance of the ghetto files and will

increase the efficiency of our operation.

RECOMMENDATION:

5-De

That the attached SAC Letter in accordance with above

(D) GHETTO INFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS -- As a result of re-

cent conferences concerning racial informants held at the Seat of Govern-

ment, it has been recommended

and approved that ghetto informants be

approved on the authority of the Special Agent in Charge and that the

probationary status of these informants will no longer be necessary.

Current policy requires that before a ghetto informant can be removed

from a probationary status the Bureau must be advised that certain

specific requirements have been satisfied; thereafter, Bureau authori-

zation is given to remove the probationary status of the informant. You

will no longer be required to advise the Bureau of the identity of the

ghetto informants and your only requirement will be to give the number

of ghetto informants currently being operated by your office at the time

you submit your monthly racial informant status report.

Current investigation required concerning development

of ghetto informants will remain in effect and it will be the responsi-

bility of each SAC to assure the necessary requirements are fulfilled

before approving these informants.

In addition to the above change it will no longer be necessary

to contact any ghetto informants on a two-week basis as was required in

the handling of probationary ghetto informants. You are now required

to contact ghetto informants on a 30-day basis.

The above changes do not affect your requirements to ob-

tain Bureau authority concerning ghetto informants who will be utilized

in connection with educational institutions.

The above changes should materially ease the administrative

handling of your Ghetto Informant Program and provide you with more

time to develop additional productive ghetto informants throughout your

territory.

Appropriate Manual changes are forthcoming.

(SAC) the option of maintaining subfiles concerning ghetto informants.

As you are aware, current policy concerning subfiles relating

to ghetto informants requires that a subfile be maintained on all ghetto

informants regardless of whether or not they are furnishing only "listen-

ing post'' type information. Effective immediately, the maintenance of a

subfile for your ghetto informants is being left to the option of the SAC.

There is little reason to maintain a subfile on those ghetto informants

Who are used primarily as "listening posts" and furnish information con-

cerning attitudes and tensions within a ghetto area. It will suffice to

place a copy of the report (FD-209) in the racial situation control file,

thereby eliminating its inclusion in a subfile.

Subfiles may be necessary in those instances when ghetto

informants are reporting valuable substantive information.

RACIAL MATTERS

-=

This is to justify the continuance of captioned program

in view of the fact that this program is producing substantial

accomplishments in the racial field on a regular basis pe

The Ghetto Informant Program was instituted by memorandum

G. C. Moore to Mr. W. C. Sullivan, dated 10-11-67, captioned

"Racial Informants, Racial Matters." A ghetto informant is an

individual who resides or works in an area described as a ghetto

and can furnish pertinent general racial information. At the

present time we are operating 5,178 ghetto informants and as of

6-1-69 we were operating 4,067 ghetto informants. This is an

increase of 1,1ll ghetto informants in the past year.

During the past year ghetto informants have been responsible

not only for obtaining valuable racial intelligence in the ghetto

areas but also for bringing about the arrest of 76 individuals, 43

on Federal charges and 33 on local charges. In addition, these

informants were responsible for solving 88 other cases, nine of

which were Federal and 79 local as well as bringing about

recoveries valued in excess of $67,660. The types of cases

involved in this were bank robberies, mail robberies, stolen

automobiles, deserters, narcotics, assaults and general fugitive

matters.

As to the racial intelligence furnished by ghetto

informants during the past year it has been responsible for not

only preventing racial violence in certain areas but also for

identifying those individuals who have perpetrated violent acts

in connection with racial disturbances. These informants have

also furnished information concerning acquisitions of firearms

by racial extremists as well as information concerning individuals

In accordance with the Director's request the

5- Dellan

i following is set forth to show the difference between a

racial informant and a ghetto

A racial informant is an individual who is

furnishing information on a confidential basis concerning

extremist groups (black or white) as well as information

concerning individuals who are members of these groups.

A ghetto informant is an individual who lives

or works in a ghetto a

ärea and has access to information

regarding the racial situation and racial activities in

his area which he furnishes to the Bureau on a confidential

basis.

The difference between the above types of informants

is that the racial informant is targeted towards extremist

organizations and their members whereas the ghetto informant

furnishes general racial information and is not a member of

an extremist group.

66-251-11-2191

At the present time we are operating 953 racial

informants and 6,024 ghetto informants.

The combination

of these two types of sources gives us a combined total of

6,977 individuals who are furnishing racial intormation to

the Bureau.

"To obtain approval for attached airtel to all field

offices concerning the advising of the Bureau of symbol

numbers assigned to ghetto racial informants.

F. Pile

SAC Letter 71-19 (C) dated 5-4-71 set out that a

symbol number designation should be afforded to all

individuals from the time any steps are taken to develop

them as any type of Bureau source. This letter instructed

that the Bureau should be advised concerning the symbol

number assigned by secure teletype.

Ghetto informants are approved by the authority

of the Special Agent in Charge and the identity of the

ghetto informant is not normally furnished to the Bureau.

In such cases as it is necessary for the Bureau to obtain

the identity of a particular ghetto informant, this is done

by individual communication.

Accordingly, it is not believed necessary for the

field to advise the Bureau of the symbol numbers assigned

to individual ghetto informants.

ACTION:

That attached airtel instructing the field not to

advise Bureau of the symbol numbers assigned to ghetto

informants unless an unusual situation occurs be approved.

Purpose of this memorandum is to advise concerning

the racial Ghetto Informant Program in respect to the article

which appeared in Sunday's 7/4/71 edition of "The Washington

Post" highlighting this Program.

"The Washington Post" article captioned "Analysis

of Stolen FBI Documents Provides Glimpse of Bureau at Work,"

(copy of which is attached), sets out the Bureau instituted

a new program "ghetto informants" to cover the ghettos of

America. The analysis in the article is based on the

stolen documents from the Media, Pennsylvania, Resident Agency.

The article sets forth that some of the specific

assignments were to attend and report on open meetings of

knowt or suspected black extremists, visit black Afro-type

bookstores to determine if extremist literature is available

and report on changes of the attitudes of the Negro community

toward the white community which may lead to racial violence.

The Ghetto Informant Program was instituted in o~

October, 1967, by memorandum dated 10/11/67 from G. C. Moore

to Mr. W. C.

Sullivan captioned "Racial Informant, Racial Matters."

It was recommended and approved that the Bureau develop sources

living or working in ghetto areas who are in a position to

keep

the Bureau advised of situations of potential violence.

This was necessary because of our responsibility of developing

racial intelligence

concerning black extremists who could

foment: racial violence in the ghetto areas. 170 - 3!:

~ Memorandum to Mr. C. D. Brennan

Re: Ghetto Informant Program

This Program has been productive in furnishing racial

intelligence information which has been responsible for not

only preventing racial violence but also identifying individuals

who have perpetrated act of violence during racial disturbances,

identifying individuals attempting to sell explosives,

individuals who participated in firebombings as well as

reporting on the activities while racial disturbances were

occurring.

In addition, these ghetto informants along with all

our racial informants from January to May 31, 1971, were

responsible for bringing about the arrest of 237 individuals,

on both local and Federal charges, 64 of which were FBI

fugitives, as well as being responsible for the recovery of

$63,865 in stolen merchandise.

OBSERVATIONS:

The Ghetto Informant Program is a sound program even

if the liberal press such as "The Washington Post" using

stolen documents attempts to imply that the Bureau through

this Program is checking on every black living in a ghetto

area. Such a task would be impossible. At the present time

we have 6,301 ghetto informants throughout the U.s. These

are mostly Negro individuals who are cooperating with the

Bureau in order to help fight the extremist and criminal

elements in their neighborhoods which jeopardize and disrupt

the law abiding Negro citizen.

This Program is analyzed on a regular basis through

field inspections, inspection of the Seat of Government and

through supervision by the Domestic Intelligence Division.

In view of the need for racial intelligence that is provided

by the Program and its productivity, we will continue to

operate it in accordance with Bureau standards.

ACTION: For information.

But the Justige Depart-

ment has declined to release

the entire text of Clark's

memorandum or the other

accompanying directives as

well as any of the guidelines

which the, incumbent Attor-

ney General has issued on

, the subject.

Clark acknowledges that

he gave such an order, but

his memory is vague about

what restrictions, if

any, were placed on the

scope of the

surveillance.

The purpose, he said, was to

• develop more reliable intel-

ligence about urban riot sit-

uations so that the federal

government could make a

measured response-a move

which

mended by the liberal-ap-

report.

Clark also wanted to settle

the politically volatile ques-

tion of whether a national

conspiracy lay behind the

urban disorders. "Of course,

we never found one,"

said.

"We felt first, a high obli.

gation to be on top of that

situation," Clark recalled,

"and, second, that the bu-

reau was not doing an ade-

quate job. On methods, we

may have been a little loose.

* Clark feels that if all of

the memoranda were availa-

did not issue an open-ended

order without limitations. In

the absence of those official

guidelines, however, the Me-

ber (but cautioned that this

without first going through

the motions of issuing a sub-

poena for it).

The Media papers, frag

mentary as they are. do not

really establish how wide-

spread that sort of need.

lance is.

Again,

agerits with experiekce in

other cities suggest that is

was the common practice,

not the exception.

Two former agents who

servedatogsther

on

the

Washington field office's Ra-

cial Squad agreed that sur-

veillance of black

groups

was

conducted

broadly,

though

they

came

away

from their bureau jobs with

vastly

different

attitudes

about it. One of them was so

disgusted that it led to his

resignation. The other found

the work fascinating and ed-

ucational.

"It was very racist," said

one of them.

"The bureau

was interested in anything

or anyone that said black. If

I were to start an organiza-

tion

called

"Friends

of

Blacks, chances are I would

beinvestigated. You

couldn't convince them that

they had no right to investi-

gate all over the lot willy-

nilly."

The secrad agent, his for-

mer colleajue, did not argue

with this description of the

scope, but insisted that the

NW 68262 Docld:32989649 Page 802

illance was not "racist"

other squads were a

work covering white groups

with equal vigor, particu-

larly New Left dissidents.

"It was something

new

and interesting to me," he

recalled. "I saw things dif-

ferently,

things I'd never

seen before about the col-

ored. I used to enjoy going

around with Stokely Carmi-

chael. He was a damn good

speaker. If he could find his

cause,

he could be a great

leader."

Several former

agents

added another distinction.

Prior to the urban riots, bu-

reau agents followed various

civil rights groups, always

on the pretext of potential

foreign

attachments. Offi-

cially, they were investigat-

ing to see if the civil rights

movement was being infil-

trated by Communists under

foreign domination.

After

196%, the exagents said, that

distinction was dropped and

any group which might be

characterizep as "black mili-

tant" or "extremist" became

a subject of concern in its

own right.

None of this probably

would shock many of the

"black

militant"

citizens

who are being watched. For

years, various civul rights

leaders have complained

about the FBI, even before

the increased

surveillance

stimulated by the riots.

Some of them insisted

that the real purpose was to

destroy their organizations

by stimulating

paranoia-

fear of infiltration

which

makes fellow members sus-

picious

of

one

another,

splinters a group into fac-.

tions and

inhibits the re-

cruiting of new members.

That was a factor, certainly

in the FBI's successful pene

tration of the Communist

Party and the Ku Klux Klan

-although few people ob-

jected when the tactic was

used against those organiza-

tions.

Curiously, ore Media doc.

ument mentions "paranoia"

weapon

against its citizens. A Phila-

lelphia agent, reporting oi

an SOG conference on th

New Left held last Septem-

ber, notes:

## Page 803

"There was a p.'etty gen-

eral consensus that, more in-

and hangers-on are in order

for plenty of reasons, chief

of which are it will enhance

the paranoia endemic

these circles and

in

will fur-

ther serve to get the point

across there is an FBI agent

behind every mailbox."

On the record, the present

administration has said that

its racial intelligence-gather-

ing related to civil disturb-

ances is a continuition, with

In order to increase the productivity of the Ghetto

Informant Program, there is attached for approval an airtel to

all continental field offices instructing that each Special Agent

in Charge (SAC) thoroughly evaluate the Ghetto Informant Program

in his respective division and submit recommendations for

improving the program in line with the guidelines set forth by

the Bureau.

The Ghetto Informant Program was instituted 10-11-67.

A ghetto informant is an individual who resides or works in an

area described as a ghetto and can furnish general information

concerning extremist activity. When originally instituted, the

ghetto informant was mainly a listening post; however, with the

change in extremist activities, a good number of these informants

were given positive assignments, which assignments definitely

increased the productivity in certain field divisions.

At the present time we are operating 6,541 ghetto

informants. This is a valuable reservoir of individuals who

"should be elevated into positions in extremist organizations.

In addition, by increasing the productivity of the ghetto

informants, the Bureau will be in a position of obtaining

additional criminal statistics.

It is to be noted that in addition to obtaining

information concerning extremist activities, the ghetto informants

along with other extremist informants since January 1, 1971, have

been responsible for bringing about the arrest of 445 individuals on

both local and Federal charges, 127 of which were FBI fugitives,

well as being responsible for the recovery of $193,181.28 in

stolen merchandise. With the increase in extremist activity as

seen by the disturbances in penal institutions, the unprovoked

attacks against police and the definite trend concerning

guerrilla warfare throughout the U.S., we must accelerate our

penetration of extremist groups.

Accordingly, in order to fully utilize our vast

reservoir of ghetto informants, it is believed each SAC should

be instructed to evaluate the Ghetto Informant Program in his

division along the following lines.

1. Ascertain the number of ghetto informants that

have been elevated into extremist organizations. 2. Determine

what percentage of the ghetto informants are given positive

assignments on a regular basis. 3. Evaluate the extremist

intelligence accomplishments of the ghetto informants in the

particular field division. 4. Evaluate the criminal

statistical accomplishments. 5. Set forth specific steps

being taken to not only increase the productivity of the

Ghetto Informant Program but also the steps being taken to

elevate the ghetto informants into extremist organizations.

Upon receipt of the above from each continental field

office, analysis will be made and appropriate instructions will

be furnished all field divisions concerning the future handling

of ghetto informants.

ACTION:

That attached airtel to all continental field offices

be approved furnishing instructions concerning the ghetto

informants as set out above.

The evaluation of the ghetto informant program made by

each continental field division clearly shows that there is a

definite relationship between the accomplishments of this program

and the percentage of ghetto informants being given positive

assignments.

In addition, the ghetto informant program has proven to be

a most productive program not only in the extremist intelligence

field but it has also shown that ghetto informants can be helpful in

obtaining criminal statistical accomplishments. Since 2/1/71 ghetto

informants have been responsible for bringing about the arrest of

111 individuals, 51 of whom were Bureau fugitives, as well as

bringing about the recovery of $49,999.

In view of the increase of guerrilla warfare activity on

the part of black extremists, it is necessary that ve develop

additional informant coverage to obtain information concerning this

activity. .

community (ghetto areas); therefore, our ghetto informants

must be targeted to obtain information concerning this

guerrilla warfare activity.

In order to fulfill our responsibilities in this

field, each field division must promptly improve both the

number and quality of ghetto informants in accordance with the

guidelines set forth below: (1) New ghetto informants

developed must be the type who can obtain information concerning

black extremists who are operating in the ghetto areas and

planning or perpetrating guerrilla-type activities such as

robberies, attacks on police, and other violent activities;

(2) The recent survey of ghetto informants showed that the

productivity of the program in each field office was in direct

relation to the percentage of ghetto informants being given

positive assignments. Those field divisions achieving greater

productivity are the ones who had a greater percentage of their

ghetto informants being given positive assignments. Accordingly,

on your FD-405b setting forth your extremist informant accomplish-

ments you must set forth the percentage of your ghetto informants

being given positive assignments.

Each ghetto informant must be evaluated on a yearly

basis; and if it is determined that the informant has not

produced positive extremist intelligence-type information, which

information would include criminal-type information, the informant

must be closed and a new ghetto informant developed.

It is expected that the quality and quantity of ghetto

informants will be improved in the near future in order that the

Bureau may fulfill its responsibilities in the extremist

intelligence field.

Purpose of this memorandum is to obtain approval for

attached airtel to all continental field offices instructing that

the extremist ghetto informant program be upgraded in accordance

with the guidelines set out in order to increase the productivity

of this program and to obtain information concerning the present

phase of extremist activity, namely, the guerrilla warfare phase.

By airtel dated 9/22/71 all continental field offices

were instructed to evaluate the ghetto informant program. These

evaluations have been received and reviewed.

The review clearly

shows that those field offices giving the majority of their ghetto

informants positive assignments are achieving not only positive

intelligence information but also valuable criminal statistical

accomplishments.

These informants, since 2/1/71, have been

responsible for bringing about the

arrest of 111 individuals, 51

of which were Bureau fugitives, and the recovery of $49,999 in

stolen merchandise, weapons, and cars.

In addition, we are now seeing another phase of extremist

jactivity, that is the guerrilla warfare phase, as opposed to the

mass demonstrations which occurred in the past.

Extremists are

involved in expropriations (robberies), killing of police,

and other terroristic activities.

The extremists involved in

guerrilla warfare have very limited or no contact with the

aboveground extremist organizations; therefore, our coverage has

been limited in this respect. The guerrilla operates within the

community (the ghetto area), and this is the area where we also

operate our ghetto informants; therefore, our ghetto informants

i should be targeted, toward developing information concerning acts

¡of guerrilla warfare.

This is to justify continuance of captioned program

in view of the fact that this program is producing substantial

accomplishments in the extremist field on a regular basis.

During the past year these informants have furnished

intelligence information concerning extremist activities which

has brought about the arrest of Black Panther Party (BPP) members

on armed robbery charges, identified individuals responsible for

a fire bombing of a food store, identified individuals who have

been involved in murder cases, as well as information which

brought about the recovery of weapons and ammunition, and

information which has been of assistance to local police in

handling civil disturbances.

While the primary objective of the ghetto informant

program is to obtain information concerning extremist activities

it also provides substantial accomplishments in the criminal

field in that these informants either live or work in ghetto

areas which are usually high crime areas. During the period

7/1/71 to 4/30/72 ghetto informants were responsible for bringing

about the arrest of 305 individuals (174 local and state, 131

Federal), of whom 85 were FBI fugitives. In addition, these

informants were responsible for the recovery of $174,994'

which

included 31 stolen automobiles, weapons, ammunition, narcotics,

and other contraband.

occur in the form of disturbances and riots. As the program

progressed it was noted that these informants could be operated

in such a manner to increase their value by giving them positive

assignments to develop information concerning black extremists

who are operating in ghetto areas and planning or perpetrating

deven ghetton

guerrilla-type activities such as robberies, attacks on police,

and other violent activities. In addition, the field has

constantly been reminded of the potential of ghetto informants

to obtain criminal information in addition to the extremist

intelligence, and this has paid off as indicated above.

Information has recently been developed indicating

black extremists are obtaining funds by robbing narcotics

dealers. Accordingly, the field has been instructed to target

ghetto informants specifically toward ascertaining the identities

of narcotics dealers in their particular areas as well as

obtaining information concerning plans of black extremists to

rob these individuals.

The ghetto informant program is a sound program and

is analyzed on a regular basis through field inspections,

inspections at FBI Headquarters, and through supervision

the Domestic Intelligence Division. In view of the need for

extremist intelligence information provided by this program

and its productivity, it is believed this program should be

This is to obtain authority to implement a modified

ghetto informant program which will reduce the number of ghetto

informants by fifty per cent without impairing the efficiency

of the operation.

• After careful analysis of the ghetto informant pro-

gram during the recent inspection of the Domestic Intelligence

Division, it was concluded that a modified ghetto informant pro-

gram would streamline and improve efficiency of the existing

program. This will be achieved by having only Special Agents

assigned to extremist matters handling ghetto informants.

Experience has shown that Special Agents experienced in extremist

matters are in a better position to achieve maximum use of ghetto

informants.

Growing civil unrest in the mid-1960s created an urgent

need for a comprehensive network of "listening post" type sources

within ghetto areas to provide advance intelligence intormation

relating to civil unrest. To fill this need the ghetto informant

program was initiated on October 11, 1967. The ghetto informant

program proved highly successful and subsequently these informants

were directed to areas of greater responsibility in addition to

their "listening post" function. A notable byeproduct o these

intormants. has been their ability to furnish highly significant

crininal information.

Memorandum to Mr. E. 'S. Miller

Re: Ghetto Informant Program

explosive element smol ldering within the ghetto areas throughout

the Nation. This volatile force, more sophisticated than in the

past, frequently surfaces in the form of urban guerrilla terrorist-

type activities often by unaffiliated extremists, resulting in the

sniping and killing of police, firebombings, and other violent

criminal activities. The current threat of civil unrest in the

ghetto is perhaps an even greater menace to our society than the

unrest we have witnessed in the past. To cope with this continuing

undercurrent, a more selective ghetto informant program is necessary.

The primary purpose of our modified ghetto informant pro-

gram is to provide a highly selective corps of "listening post"

informants versed in the type of information desired by the Bureau

which will assure we are abreast of growing civil unrest and

developing extremist activities.

This can best be accomplished

by having ghetto informants exclusively handled by those Special

Agents assigned to extremist matters.

Inasmuch as ghetto informants

generally work or reside in high crime areas and frequently associ-

ated with the criminal element, we will continue to encourage the

acceptance of criminal information coming to the attention of these

informants.

While we expect a fifty percent decrease in the 7,514

ghetto informants currently being operated, the modified ghetto

informant program in no way diminishes the

responsibility of the

Special Agent in Charge (SAC) to have "listening post" type sources

in those ghetto areas where there is a potential for civil unrest

or extremist activity. In addition, the SAC will be instructed to

carefully analyze each current ghetto informant and those with the

best potential to be retained as ghetto informants or elevated to

probationary extremist informant and others, if appropriate, redesig

nated as criminal informants or discontinued.

Some 'SACs have levied an arbitrary rule requiring Special

Agents, regardless of assignment, to develop ghetto informants. We

will give instructions to insure this practice is discontinued. ..

RECOMMENDATION: That attached SAC memorandum, in accordance

with above, be approved and sent.

EXTREMIST MATTERS

Ms. Herwig

Mrs. Neenan -

. -L::

A request to reduce the number of ghetto informants by fifty

percent, which gives the appearance of being an arbitrary figure,

AGREE

immediately suggests the need to explore thoroughly the merits of the

ghetto informant program and to consider what, if any, more practical

alternatives might exist.

An informant who is classified as a ghetto informant, as dis-

tinguished from a criminal, security, potential security or extremist

informant, appears to be one who is expected to provide advance

intelligence information relating to civil unrest. In evaluating the

program, it is therefore important to know of each instance since the

program was begun on Ocotber 11, 1967, in which intelligence informa-

tion prior to an urban riot or upheaval was obtained from a ghetto

informant.

I am not referring to criminal and security information. If

the information from a ghetto informant fits within one of these two

categories, it would seem more plausible for the informant to be

carried as a criminal, a security, a potential security or an extremist

informant. Only if he has furnished intelligence information concerning

an urban riot or upheaval should an informant be designated as a

ghetto informant.

SL11 REC 43 110.09

2420 NOV I-1972

Classifying the informant as a ghetto informant wher cryon

information obtained from him falls only within the criminal or security

field is not a mere matter of semantics. It seems apparent from the

Agents Handbook, Part I, pp. 20a and 20b, that carrying a person as a

ghetto informant involves a vast expenditure of Agent and clerical time.

There has to be a background investigation, at least one contact a month

and, in some instances, progress letters to the Bureau every six months.

Memorandum for Mr. Gray

Re: Ghetto Informant Program

Extremist Matters

Although I have not seen the answers to the question referred

to above as to the instances in which ghetto informants have furnished the

type information which was expected of them when the program was

established, my initial opinion is that the ghetto informant program has

not produced any information which could not be obtained by (1) regular

debriefing of criminal, security, potential security, and extremist

informants; (2) liaison with local police departments who, as a part of

the increasing emphasis upon better police-community relations, are

much closer to the pulse of the local ghetto community than may have

been the case heretofore, and who have probably always been closer to

the ghetto than the FBI could ever hope to be; and (3) volunteered

information from interested citizens.

The last paragraph of the Moore to Miller memorandum of

9/8/72 impliedly suggests what I believe to be the major justification

for continuing a separate program under the heading of ghetto informants.

SACs do not levy an arbitrary rule requiring SA's to develop ghetto

informants unless the SACs, rightly or wrongly, believe the Headquarters

expects a certain caseload of ghetto informants from their respective

offices.

The suspicion that it is the caseload concept which underlies

much of the current discussion about the ghetto informant program in

the aftermath of the recent inspection of DID is increased by the proposed

cutback of fifty percent, which, as previously indicated, appears to be

a somewhat arbitrary figure.

You should know in advance what the consequences would be as

far as the budget is concerned if the ghetto informant program, which

has undoubtedly accounted for a significant number of cases, were dis-

continued. If those consequences include a drastic cut in funds, you of

course can not be oblivious to them, but, at the risk of sounding naive,

I would hope that the future of this program can be decided solely on the

basis of the program's merit or lack thereof without regard to the case-

load factor.

Re Dave Kinley's note about our discussing this matter,

I believe I heard at the SAC Conference on 9/26 that DID was going

to poll the Field to get the views of SAC's and I got the impression

that DID, upon receipt of these comments from the Field, might

wish to revise the proposed SAC Memorandum which was the

subject of the 9/8/72 memorandum from Mr. Moore to you.

If there is to be a revised proposal from DID in light of

comments from the Field and the comments of Mr. Gray, it may

be that our discussion would take a substantially different form than

it it occurred now. Therefore, I suggest that the meeting contemplated

by Mr. Kinley not occur until after you have had a chance to poll the

Field, and consider the comments of Mr. Gray:

REC-46 / 4/s.-

-236

The ghetto informant program was instituted on 10/11/67,

to fulfill an urgent need to develop a network of "listening posts"

in the ghetto areas of our cities.

Ghetto informants are those

persons living or working in ghetto areas who could furnish

information concerning the potential for riots and violent civil

unrest. As the field gained experience in the handling of these

informants, their value steadily increased. The "listening post"

concept was expanded and ghetto informants

are now utilized to

attend public meetings held by extremists, to identify extremists

passing through or locating in

the ghetto area, to identify

purveyors of extremist literature as well as given specific assign-

ments where appropriate. A valuable by-product of the ghetto.

informant program has been their ability to furnish highly

Significant criminal information.

In addition, our ghetto informant

program has been a proven reservoir of productive-extremist

informants who have been elevated from the ghetto informant rarks.

We currently operate 7,482 ghetto informants.

informants are developed and handled by field agents tegardless

security. During the recent inspection of the Domestic

Intelligence Division, it was concluded that a modified

ghetto informant program would streamline and improve the

efficiency of the existing program. This was to be achieved

by having only Special Agents assigned to extremist matters

handle ghetto informants and instructing the SAls to reduce

their ghetto informant numbers by 50 percent in order to

eliminate the less productive informants. To date this

modified program has not been approved.

As a result of the number of views expressed during

the SAC conference on 9/26/72, concerning the appropriate

utilization of ghetto informants, there is a need to obtain

the opinion of all SACs before considering modifying the

existing program. Accordingly, there is attached an airtel to

all SACs with instructions to promptly analyze their ghetto

informant program and submit their recommendations concerning

the most efficient use of these informants in accordance to their

needs to fulfill their respective responsibilities in the

extremist field. Upon receipt of these views, a thorough review

The Bureau is currently considering modifying the ghetto

informant progran for the purpose of achieving greater efficiency

and maximum utilization of these informancs while carefully preserv-

ing the "Ilstening post" concept of the program.

One proposed change to the ghetto informant program

recommends a reduction in the number of these informants by fifty

percent and the handling of these informants exclusively by Special

Agents assigned to extremist matters. This proposal emphasizes

quality and the closing, where appropriate, or redesignation of

those informants best suited as extremist, criminal or security

informants.

The proposed modification of the ghetto informant program

was discussed during the 9/26/72 session of the Special Agent in

Charge (SAC) conference held at FBI Headquarters. A number of

opinions were expressed as to the value of ghetto informants in

enabling each office to fill its responsibility in the extremist

field. It was agreed that further study of the program is necessary

before initiating any modification of the program.

For your ready reference, our ghetto informant program

follows guidelines set out in Bureau airtel to Albany dated 11/24/71,

Re: Ghetto Informant Program

Captioned "Upgrading Extremist Ghetto Informant Program."

This airtel requires that ghetto informants be the type of

individuals who can obtain information concerning black

extremists who are operating in the ghetto areas and planning

or perpetrating guerrilla-type activities such as robberies,

attacks on police, and other violent activities. Our current

ghetto informant program requires that these informants be

given positive assignments and that they be evaluated on a

yearly basis in order to close the unproductive informant.

To assist the Bureau in determining what changes,

if any, should be made to the existing ghetto informant

program, you are instructed to carefully analyze your ghetto

informant program in line with the following points and sub-

mit your recommendations to reach the Bureau by 10/9/72.

Bear in mind our purpose is to have a uniform program to

best do the job intended:

1) Retain current program without modification.

2) Adopt the proposed change set out above calling

for a fifty percent reduction in the number of ghetto

informants. Should you disagree with the fifty percent

reduction, submit your recommendation concerning the

percent of reduction you consider appropriate with an

explanation as to how you arrived at your conclusion.

Bear in mind that quality is difficult without

quantitative measurement.

3)

Other changes beljeved necessary.

4)

Abolish the ghetto program in its entirety.

If you recommend the program be abolished, submit

specific alternate program you recommend to obtain

the intelligence information now being developed by

ghetto informants.

The purpose of the memorandum is to secure

concerning the ghetto informant program.

A survey of all field offices relative to the

ghetto informant program has been completed.

The field overwhelmingly expressed a desire to

continue the program; however, a number of suggestions were

offered to modify certain aspects of it.

Based upon a review of the results of this survey

the following recommendations are made:

1) The number of informants operated under this

program should definitely be governed by the needs of a

specific office as determined by the Special Agent in Charge

(SAC. Attached letter will instruct each office to conduct

an analysis to determine its needs and only those informants

absolutely necessary to fulfill the needs of the office are

to be operated.

The letter will also instruct that this

program is not to be utilized as a device to increase the

office case load.

some offices actually do not have "ghetto" areas but do

have certain geographical locations of potential civil

unrest and extremistativity.

As of September 1, 1972, we were operating 7,482

ghetto informants. It is not possible to determine at this

time the number of these informants that we will end up with

based on the instructions set forth in attached letter.

However, we anticipate a decrease from the existing level.

OBSERVATION: There have been a variety of opinions expressed

in the past on the value of the ghetto informant program and,

in fact, we have utilized a discussion of this program to

"warm up" Agent conferences and in-service classes because

of the lively discussion it generates. The recently completed

survey, however shows that only four offices were in favor

of doing away with the existing ghetto informant program.

It is obvious

that this program is considered to be of con-

tinuing value to our field offices.

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

Re: Ghetto Informant Program

It has been said that there has not been a single

instance where a ghetto informant has furnished significant

information pertaining to civil unrest. This is a mis-

conception because, in fact, since the inception of this

program there have been numerous times that these informants

have furnished significant information concerning civil

unrest. Examples of a few of these are as follows:

A Memphis ghetto Intormant identified four Negro

males who had assaulted and stabbed a high school teacher

which lead to their arrest and resulted in the quieting

of a potentially riotous situation.

A Minneapolis ghetto

informant identified participants involved in a disturbance

at the University of Minnesota. A Jackson ghetto informant

provided pertinent information concerning a disturbance at

Jackson State College and identified four individuals

setting fires on the campus.

This informant also identified

individuals leading a mob of 100 persons attacking the

Reserve Officer Training Corps Building on that campus.

Ghetto informants of the Knoxville Office furnished informa-

tion on black extremists extorting money from white merchants

with the threat of fire bombing their stores if they failed

to cooperate. A Norfolk ghetto informant furnished informa-

tion that a gathering of 200 young blacks had 40 fire bombs

which they intended to use. Local authorities credited this

information with avoiding a

massive civil disturbance.

A

Springfield ghetto informant identified an individual attempt-

ing to sell a large quantity of explosives for use in creating

a civil disturbance..

A Tampa ghetto informant identified five

• Negroes responsible for provoking trouble at a local school.

In addition, ghetto informants have furnished a

large amount of valuable criminal information which is perhaps

best highlighted by a recent case wherein a ghetto informant

of the Oklahoma City Office furnished the information which

lead to the identification and apprehension of four subjects

in a terrorist-type slaying of a man, his wife, and a young

son.

ADDENDUM OF THE INSPECTION DIVISION L. M. WALTERS:wmj 10/24/

Ghetto Informant Program instituted 10/11/67 to fulfill a need

then recognized to develop a comprehensive network of "listening posts"

in the ghetto areas of urban centers throughout the country. Over the

succeeding years number of such informants has gradually built to some

7500 existing today. Field inspections in past year have pointed to diffic It]

of evaluating justification for such informants because, unlike the other

informant programs (criminal, security, extremist, revolutionary

activities, and top echelon) the justification for an individual informant

cannot be supported by what he is producing. It is sufficient that ghetto

informants are geographically well dispersed and promise cooperation.

The practice of opening such cases varies widely and can be used by a

field office to effect sharp changes in total case load upward or downward,

The number of ghetto informant cases substantially affects manpower

utilization in that each ghetto informant opened requires a background

(investigation and thereafter 30-day contacts.

Accordingly, during inspection (8/18 - 9/1/72) of Domestic

Intelligence Division (DID) the merits of the overall program were

thoroughly reviewed and discussed. As a result, DID proposed in inspection

that hereafter assignment of such informants be limited to those Agents

assigned to extremist squads or extremist work and that SACs be instructed

to cease levying a requirement that all Agents, regardless of assignment,

must develop and operate ghetto informants.

DID estimated that such a

change in the program would probably reduce the total number of such cases

by 50%.

The proposed letter to the field accomplishes little meaningful

change.

It changes the name of the program; it provides latitude to SACs

to determine extent of program within guideline that the number of

informants operated must be deemed necessary to fulfill the needs of the

• office (this has always been so); it also provides lat ude to sAcs as to

whether all Agents in the office participate or only those Agents assigned to

extremist matters. Implementation of changes proposed herein would

result in an extraordinary lack of uniformity throughout the field.

The point really called into question here is whether concrete

steps should be taken to effect an overall case load reduction by sharply

reducing marginally productive cases in order to divert Agent manpower

to more productive uses in major program areas. The broader question

is currently under consideration and the results of that consideration should

NW 68262. Docld:32989649_Page-835

---

## Page 836

more clearly dictate the proper approach to the Ghetto Informant

Program.

Accordingly, it is recommended that any change in this

program be deferred until the overall question of case load vs.

manpower utilization is resolved.

Re memo of G. C. Moore to Mr. E. S. Miller of 10/18/72

on this subject.

The first paragraph of the Addendum of the Inspection Division

sets forth some of the considerations which have caused my skepticism

as to whether the benefits gained from this Program are sufficient to

justify the costs in terms of resource utilization attendant to the Ghetto

Informant Program.

With reference to the recommendation of the Inspection Division

that no action be taken until the overall question of caseload versus man-

power utilization is resolved, I am not certain as to the precise inquiry

currently in progress which is being referred to by the Inspection Division.

If there is such an inquiry with a view towards instructing the Domestic

Intelligence Division not to let fears as to the consequences of a reduction

in the quantity of its total caseload interfere with devoting concentrated

attention towards the most important matters within its jurisdiction, I

would be the first to applaud this inquiry.

In this regard, the problem I see with the proposed letter of

the Domestic Intelligence Division is that by giving wide latitude to SACs

to administer the Ghetto Informant Program within their respective offices,

the memorandum is not likely to accomplish meaningful change as long as

so much turns within the Bureau on the total caseload of an office. Even

though an SAC in Field Division X believes that he could terminate his

Ghetto Informant Program altogether and, by doing so, increase the

effective utilization of his personnel, he will hesitate to make such a

decision because he knows it could well result in a substantial reduction

in his total caseload, which in turn would mean that his office would lose

Agents and/or supervisors or would not be able to obtain additional Agents

and/or supervisors.

Re: Ghetto Informant Program

Extremist Matters

This is why it seems so vitally important to achieve the

by no means easy goal of finding some way to measure the needs of an

office without resort to dependence upon the total caseload of the office

because the present reliance upon caseload figure restricts the SACs

ability to make decisions, otherwise called for, which would reduce

his total caseload.

The Domestic Intelligence Division furnished to me copies of

the responses received from the Field Divisions in connection with the

Field survey concerning the Ghetto Informant Program. The information

submitted by the Newark Division so closely approximates my opinion

concerning the Ghetto Informant Program that I am attaching a copy of

Civil disturbances are either planned or spontaneous.

In the first case, such planning is done by various militant

groups.

It is the responsibility of all field offices to

have developed informants of such charzeter in these groups

that they are in a position to furnish advance information

about such plans.

"Listening post" informants are not in &

position to furnish information about prrplanned disturbances

and they certainly cannot lurnish prior information relative to

spontaneous disturbance. Once a disturbance or riot has

started, it is virtually impossible to contact these individuala

inssnuch as nost commercial enterprises are closed down and

entry Into these areas is not leasible and the ability of these

informants to report by telephone 1s very doubtful.

Targeting of such informants towards obtaining

Information concerning black extremists, robberies, attacks on

police and other violent activities, as

well as recent targeting

towards obtaining narcotics inforuation has been extrenely Iimite

11n 1ts value. In view of this, it 1s felt that the value of

the "Itstening post" is limited and they should be eliminated.

The manner in which this action should be taken is set out later

in this communication.

The second group consists of those individuals opened

as ghetto informants who are considered to have definite value

in the extremist field and who are targeted to furnish speciiie

information reistive to extremist organizations and individuals.

These informants are actually under develoument towards becoming

oxtronist iniormanta:

presently menbers of extremist organizations or are in some way

attiblated with these organizations through contact with members.

These ghetto intorants are of great value for the continued

development of new informants in the extrenist flold. In the

Newark Division It is this group of ghetto informants who have

furnished positive iniormation relstive to extremist activities,

as well as contributing information relative to lugitives, bank

robberies and local criminal matters.

They are all targeted

towards furnishing infornation relative to narcotics activity.

It is anticipated that they will be or great value in this

field.

These ghetto iniormants are of definite value and

the Newark Division are all assigned to Agents conducting

extremist investigations.

roview, is set forth above, it it is determined the informant is

It is felt that il the above is

adopted, a great deal

by the Agents conducting investigations in the extremist, security

and criminal fields.

Further, concentration on the remainder

EXTREMIST MATTERS

Mrs. Neenan -

In connection with various memoranda concerning captioned

matter, Mr. Gray inquired "Why not handle this program in same manner

as our other programs involving informants? G III 11/9 2:34 P"

The question asked is similar to the questions raised at

the time the captioned program was inaugurated in October, 1967.

Faced with the need for a rapid development of a particular type of

informant, the decision was made to implement a program with a

minimum amount of Headquarters'

supervision.

1. Accordingly, authority

was granted for the Special Agents in Charge (SAC) to approve the

operation of an individual as a ghetto informant.

there is set forth data showing that the Ghetto Informant

Program is in line with other Bureau informant programs in that there

are specific guidelines for the operation of the informants, as well

as requirements for the justification of the informants and

requirements for contacts with these informants along with the

regulations concerning payments to informants.

There are also set forth observations concerning the.

comments made by Mr. Armstrong in his memorandum of November 2,

11972,

and the comments made by the Inspection Division in its addendum

of 10/24/72.

In 1967 the United States experienced violent racial

disturbances in many cities and it was indicated that there was a

need for cooperative individuals (sources) in those areas

experiencing the above disturbances. Such questions as "Are these

disturbances spontaneous or are they planned?" "Are these dis-

turbances caused by organizations or individuals? If so, identify

them"' were being asked not only by FBI Headquarters officials, t

RE: GHETTO INFORMA

PROGRAM

Analysis of the then existing Security, Criminal and Extremist

Informant Programs determined that none of these existing programs could

supply the answers to the questions being asked..:

The above analysis further showed that due to the orientation

of the various informant programs mentioned above, that is, criminal

informants to obtain criminal information, security informants for

security information, and extremist informants for specific information

concerning extremist organizations and known extremist individuals,

there was still a vast area where racial unrest was rampant, namely, the

ghetto areas where there

= was a need for a "listening post" type

informant. Accordingly, the Ghetto Informant Program was instituted.

Comparison of Ghetto Informant Operations With Other Bureau Informant

Operations

The Security Informant Program as well as the Extremist

Informant Program require tight supervision at both Headquarters and

field level because of the extreme sensitivity of these operations.

previously stated, there was a need for development and rapid operation

of sources in the ghetto areas which were to be utilized as "listening

posts." In view of the nature of this operation, it was decided that the

tight supervision required by the other informant programs was not

necessary, however, it was also recognized that for any program to be

fruitful and administratively sound, there must be guidelines set out..

The guidelines formulated were based on our experiences with

the Security and Extremist Informant Programs and required that some

background checks be conducted prior to the approval of an individual as

an informant; a contact be made with the individual designated as an

informant at least once every 30 days; that any payments made to a ghetto

informant must be in accordance with Bureau policy which is also the

requirement for other informant programs.

In synopsis, it can be said that the Ghetto Informant Program

is similar to other informant programs (security and extremist) in that

there are definite guidelines set for the designation and operation of

an individual as a ghetto informant, as well as the fact payment to these

informants must conform to Bureau regulations. In short, the Ghetto

Informant Program, although operated basically as other informant

programs, does serve a separate and distinct need which our experience

has shown the other Bureau informant programs did not and could not

fill.

states these cases can be used by a field office to effect

Mr. Gray concerning the Ghetto Informant Program on 9/26/72,

all SACs were instructed to submit their comments and

recommendations concerning this program. If we are not going

to take the recommendations of the SACs, who are our leaders

In the field, then why did we bother to request their opinions?

Likewise, they certainly are entitled to know the results of

the survey and this is what we are attempting to do.

In connection with the recommendation made that any

change in this program be deferred until the overall question

of case load versus manpower utilization is resolved, there

apparently is no indication as to when this will be resolved

and further, this question should not be the deciding factor

as to whether or not there should be a Ghetto Informant Program.

Memorandum of Mr. Daniel M. Armstrong, III dated November 2, 1972

Mr. Armstrong stated that in connection with the

inquiry concerning the overall question of case load versus

manpower that if there is such an inquiry with a view toward

instructing DID not to let fears as to the consequences of a

reduction in the quantity of its total case load interfere

with devoting concentrated attention towards the most important

matters within its jurisdiction, he would be the first to

applaud this inquiry.

In respect to this, DID is not aware of any fears in

connection with the above case load work load inquiry and,

further, we will always go full steam ahead to obtain the

maximum quality intelligence data needed to fulfill our

responsibilities to the United States Government, regardless

of any alleged "fears."

Mr. Armstrong stated that the problem he sees with

DID's proposed letter of 10/20/72 is that "by giving wide

latitude to SACs to administer the Ghetto Informant Program

within their respective offices, the memorandum is not likely

to accomplish meaningful change as long as so much turns

Again it is pointed out that the DID memorandum was intended

recommended that the Program be continued. The greater

majority of these individuals recommended that the Program

letter dated 10/20/72.

OBSERVATIONS:

The Ghetto Informant Program since 1967, when it was

instituted, has been analysed and critiqued not only by FBI

Headquarters personnel, SACs, but also by Field Supervisors and

Field Informant Coordinators through a series of correspondence,

as well as specialized conferences. The overriding opinion

of the majority of individuals involved in the above has

been that this program has in the past and still is an

ettective productive program. The program serves a vital

need, that is, the need to know the potential for acts of

civil disturbances that could not only disrupt the operations

in local communities, but could also cause disruption on a

nationwide basis.

ADDENDUM OF THE INSPECTION DIVISION J.H. TRIMBACH:wmj 11/24/72

The attached series of documents arose from DI inspection review of

Ghetto Informant Program, 8/18 - 9/1/72. Inspection Division adheres to its

position expressed in addendum to 10/18/72 memorandum attached and still feels

that the proposed letter to the field contains no meaningful change in the

operation of the Ghetto Informant Program.

Under the heading, "Need for the Ghetto Informant Program," in foregoing

memorandum (page 1, last paragraph), DID mentions questions such as "Are

these (racial) disturbances spontaneous or are they planned?", and "Are these

disturbances caused by organizations or individuals?"

', as questions asked by

high Government officials after the racial disturbances of 1967. Inspection Division

feels that advance information responsive to such intelligence needs must be

obtained from productive, well-placed Security, Revolutionary Activities, and

Extremist Informants, or as by-product information from Criminal Informants

and other sources from whom we have reasonable expectation of positive

information reporting based on past experience. Our current concept of

a Ghetto Informant includes the proprietor of a candy store or barber shop in

a ghetto (under new proposal in an urban area) who may or may not have

such information.

One such proprietor could have significant information about

an impending racial disturbance and another may not. Can we assume that our

Ghetto Informant is the local proprietor with the answer because we have

selected him in the neighborhood as a listed Ghetto Informant?

Inspection Division feels that the Ghetto Informant Program as viewed by the

DID is different from all other informant programs in at least one highly

important respect. On page 3 of the memorandum, it is stated that the report

(from a Ghetto Informant) that there is no indication of civil unrest in a particular

area is considered "positive" information and should be counted as such. Negative

information is not counted as positive information in any other informant program

and in other programs we obtain some history of the furnishing of productive in -

formation before forming a conclusion that the individual is worthy of continued

contact or further development. If we accept the views of the DID, then every

Ghetto Informant opened by an office and established for monthly contact is

capable of furnishing "positive" information because everyone is capable of

saying they do not have information indicating civil unrest.

Some Ghetto Informants have in the past furnished information in extremist

or criminal matters. This has been recognized as a by-product of the Ghetto

Informant Program.

A more meaningful approach to this whole problem might be

to concentrate more heavily in ghetto areas to develop proven Security, Extremist,

Revolutionary Activities, and Criminal Informants upon whom we can then rely to

keep us advised of civil disturbance plans as a steady by-product to the information

NW 68262 Docld:32989649 Page 850

## Page 851

they are regularly furnishing on domestic intelligence or criminal matters.

Existing Ghetto Informants who have shown productivity in any area of FBI

jurisdiction should be converted to the appropriate substantive informant

program to which their services relate. Further, all informants designated

in the other informant programs who are strategically located in areas of

potential civil unrest, should be briefed on supplying information that may

come to their attention relating to develoing tensions and civil unrest. Such

approach would, in our view, represent a better ordering of priorities and not

have the "cart before the horse." Moreover, we have some concern of

justifiable apprehension that might be expressed by the Congress or the public

it this program were to be described in terms out of context with our real intentions.

We could fully defend informants providing us regularly with information directly

related to our jurisdictional responsibilities and using them for "by-product"

information on civil unrest. It would be much more difficult to defend

establishment of ghetto or urban listening posts all over the country with a

possible by-product of information directly within our jurisdiction.

In our view, the Ghetto Informant Program is not a proven program and in

view of the manpower expended on it, the decision as to whether we should

keep it, modify it, or abolish it should be made after a decision is reached

concerning the oerall question of case load vs, manpower utilization now pending

in connection with a separate management study.

Re memorandum from Mr. G. C. Moore to Mr. E. S. Miller,

dated November 20, 1972, on this subject and the addendum of the Inspection

Division thereto, dated November 24,

1972.

As noted in the addendum of the Inspection Division, the Urban

Informant Program formerly known as the Ghetto Informant Program

differs from all other informant programs in that negative information 15,

under this program, counted as positive information.

It would appear from Section 130 (H) (2) (b) (4) of the Manual of

Instructions that an urban informant who does nothing more than advise our

inquiring Agents that there is no indication of civil unrest in his particular

area could qualify for payments on a regular basis under Bureau authority.

In this regard, I believe it would be useful to know (1) how

many of the Bureau's present urban informants are being paid on a regular

basis, (2) of that number, how many have furnished only information to the

effect that there is no indication of civil unrest in their areas and (3) of

those urban informants not paid on a regular basis, are there documented

cases in which those informants have been paid for saying that there is no

indication of civil unrest in their areas?

The answer to Question (1) would appear to be readily available.

The cuses ta the other questions, especiallie Etion (2), might be

difficult to obtain.

If you deem it appropriate, I would be pleased to have you obtain

the answers to one or more of the above questions, or I would make the

effort myself. I would understand completely if you conclude that the'" a ne

request for this information should come only from Mr. Gray. 1 JAN I::'P

Re: 11

URBAN INFORMANT PROGRAM

One of the memoranda on this subject which was

included in the package which Mr. Deegan sent me at your

request was a memorandum of 12/5/72 from me to Mr. Kinley

upon which Mr. Gray had written - "Prepare a memo for my

signature requesting the info. G III 12-11 9:09A." The

information to which Mr. Gray was referring would be the

answers to three questions set forth in the body of the

memorandum.

In view of the fact that you are already in possession

of the memorandum containing the three questions and Mr.

Gray's instructions with reference thereto, I have suggested

to Mr. Kinley that the preparation of a memorandum for

Mr. Gray's signature would now be, under the circumstances

at this case, unnecessary. MI. Kinley suggested that the

answers to those three questions colla be compiled and made

available to Mr. Gray in conjunction with the overall project of

developing an Urban Informant Program which he also requested™

in his notation of 12-11-72 at 9:1T AM.

Thereiore, I will not prepare a memorandum formally

requesting the answers to the three questions, and will assume

that the information will be furnished in connection with the project

we are now working on. Please advise if this suggested approach

presents any problems.

operation both in the field and at FBIHQ.

The new revised Extremist Informant Program

eliminates urban (ghetto) informants and is limited to

potential extremist informants (PEI), extremist informants

(EI), and confidential sources-extremist (CS-E).

Definitions and qualifications for these new

informant categories are as follows:

Potential Extremist Informant:

A PEI is an individual who is in a position to

furnish information concerning extremist activities of

individuals and organizations as well as information of an

extremist nature in those geographical areas where there is

a potential for violence.

The personal authority of the SAC is necessary to

designate and operate an individual as a PEI with exceptions

as noted below. These informants are to be operated for a

period of not more than one year and not less than six months

providing their potential is such that it appears he will qualify

for elevation to EI. The PEI must be discontinued immediately

following a determination that he has no future potential as an

EI and those PEIs not elevated at the end of one year must be

discontinued.

Memorandum to Mr. W. M. Felt

Re:

Extremist Informant Program

The following are exceptions to the SAC's authority

for granting the approval of the operation of a PEI. If any

of the following conditions exist, the SAC must submit his

recommendation to FBIHQ on a UACB

basis:

1. Any individual in a sensitive position (i.e. news

media, educational field or any other field where disclosure

as an informant would cause concern to the Bureau).

2. Any individual being placed in an extremist

organization or any individual presently in an extremist

organization.

3.

Any individual who has been charged with a

felony violation in the past five years.

4. Any individual who is presently under indictment

or is on probation or parole, Federal or local.

5. Any individual with an unsavory background yet

who, is in a position to furnish uniquely valuable information

not available from other sources.

The Special Agent in Charge has authority to

authorize payments to PEIs in the amount of up to $400.

Additional payment authority must be obtained from FBIHQ.

Bureau authority is necessary to elevate a PEI to

an EI. Field recommendation must contain full justification.

If PEI does not qualify for EI within one year, he must be

discontinued.

Extremist Informant:

An EI is an individual who has been operated as a

PEI for at least six months (in order that his reliability can

be properly evaluated) and is furnishing extremist information

on a regular basis whether it be concerning an extremist

organization or an unaffiliated extremist. In order to elevate

a PEI to an EI, he must have produced authentic data on

extremist activities and be in a position to continue furnishing

extremist intelligence information.

Confidential Sources-Extremist:

A CS-E is an individual who is willing to cooperate

with the Bureau by furnishing extremist information brought

to his attention by virtue of his position in the community,

by his employment, or in view of his background in extremist

activities. This individual, whose identity must be protected,

will not be actively seeking information on behalf of the

Bureau.

OBSERVATIONS:

We contemplate no changes in the existing extremist

requirements as they pertain to background investigation,

payments, or other administrative policy.

Our present urban informants will be evaluated to

determine if they should be considered in the future as EIs,

PEIs, CS-E, directed to the Security or Criminal Informant

Programs, or discontinued altogether.

No individual will be operated as an EI or PEI solely

because he is in a "listening post" position. To insure we

have informant coverage in those areas where there is a potential

for violence, instructions will be issued to each SAC to insure

all Special Agent personnel are aware of the need for developing

information where there is a potential for violence and that

those Special Agents not directly involved with extremist

matters refer those individuals who may possess information of

potential violence to the Extremist Supervisor in order that

their informant potential may be assessed.

Re: Extremist Informant Program

The field will be instructed that CS-Es are not

to be kept in a pending status unless these sources are

furnishing information on a regular basis. Sources reporting

infrequently may be operated from a pending file with a

provision for closing after a fixed period of inactivity,

out of a dead file or out of a control file. Each SAC should

determine which method of operation is best suited for his

individual needs. SACs may desire to establish an informant

map which will clearly depict coverage in any geographical area

within their division.

Those informants currently carried as probationary

extremist informants should either be designated as PEIs

or elevated to EIs.

Program are approved, appropriate Manual changes will be made.

ADDENDUM

DMA: nm. '

4/6/73

Mr. Gray in his instructions of 12/11/72, which led to the

aforementioned meeting of 2/20/73, said he was not persuaded that the

"listening post" concept continued to have merit. "It is," he said, "a

luxury that we cannot afford at the present." In view of the fact that the

"listening post" concept has up to now been a central feature of the Urban

(Ghetto) Informant Program, Mr. Gray's comments clearly contemplate

a major change in this program.

In order to insure effective implementation of the new policy,

it is therefore important that SAC's clearly understand that a major change

is intended. Unless the new policy is spelled out in unmistakably clear

terms, SAC's may understandably interpret the new policy as not repre-

senting a major change from the past.

The motivation for this kind of

interpretation is great because such an interpretation would be most

consistent with the maintenance of a high case load of urban (ghetto)

informants, and SAC's continue, I fear, to operate on the assumption

(erroneous I hope) that any significant decrease in their case loads,

regardless of the circumstances leading to the decrease, will automatically

mean a reduction in the number of Agents assigned to their Divisions, etc.

It is with the above in mind that I venture the following comments

on the proposed description of the revised Extremist Informant Program.

1. The revised policy statement should include language that

the revised Extremist Informant Program is designed to reduce substantially

the number of non-productive informants in the Urban (Ghetto) Informant

Program who have not provided positive specific intelligence concerning

extremist, security or criminal activities. The SAC's should be told that

careful and close attention must be given to insure that each informant

operating in the revised Extremist Informant Program is both in a position

to furnish and willing to furnish information of positive value to the Bureau

in the extremist area.

2. I would define a PEI simply as an individual who is in a position

to furnish information concerning extremist activities of individuals and/or

organizations. If we are covering both known individuals and organizations

With a potential for violence, "geographical areas where there is a potential

for violence" should automatically be covered. An additional reference to

"geographical areas...." is therefore unnecessary and could be confusing

NW 68262 Docld:32989649 Page 865

---

## Page 866

ADDENDUM (Continued...)

to SAC's since they are told elsewhere that mere "listening posts" are no

longer to be operated.

3. If a PEI is defined as suggested in #2, it is not clear who else

would be left in the great majority of situations for an SAC to approve as a

PEI except an individual who is being placed in an extremist organization or

an individual who is presently in an extremist organization. Therefore,

requiring an SAC to submit a recommendation to FBI HQ before an individual

is approved as a PEI when the individual in question is being placed in an

extremist organization or is presently in an extremist organization, which

submission is required by condition #2 on page 2 of this memorandum, could

be tantamount to requiring notification to Headquarters in practically every

case. This should not be necessary because the SAC seems to be in the best

position in the great majority of cases to make a final decision as to whether

a person should be operated as a PEI.

4. With further reference to those situations on page 2 of this

memorandum describing when the SAC must submit his recommendation of

a PEl to FBI HQ, there would appear to be very few candidates for a PEI

who have not been at least charged with felony violations. Therefore, the

fact that an individual has been charged with a felony violation in the past

five years seems of no great significance to the question whether that person

should be operated as a PEI, and the SAC should not be required to notify

FBI HQ when this situation arises. Thus, I would delete condition #3. With

specific reference to condition #5, as presently worded, this condition seems

too broad and/or ambiguous.. Practically speaking, couldn't anyone likely

to qualify as a PEI quite conceivably be described as a person with "an

unsavory background?" If so, this condition could have the effect of requiring

advance notification to FBI HQ in practically every situation, a result which,

as indicated above, I do not favor.

Finally, if FBI HQ is to be notified, as is

proposed by condition #1, when the individual is in a sensitive position, I

think the SAC should be given more specific guidance as to what is considered

to be a sensitive position. The phrase "any other field where disclosure as an

informant would cause concern to the Bureau" is too vague.

Armstrong Ill dated April 6, 1973, attached

to Mr. G. C. Moore

to Mr. E. S. Miller memorandum dated March 6, 1973, captioned

"Extremist Informant Program."

Set forth below are comments concerning Mr. Armstrong's

observations:

1. Mr. Armstrong suggests the revised policy

should include language that therevised Extremist Informant

Program is devised to reduce substantially the number of

nonproductive informants in the Urban (Ghetto) Informant

Program.

We believe this is clearly stated in our memorandm

to all

SACs on page four, paragraph one "Under the revised.

program no individual is

to be operated as an EI or PEI

solely because he is in a 'listening post' position."

2. Mr. Armstrong proposed that he would define

who is in a position to furnish information concerning

• extremist informant (PEI) simply as an individual

extremist activities of individuals and/or organizations.

therefore, since we are covering both known individuals and

organizations with a potential for violence, there is no neea

for a reference to

"geographical areas where there is a poten-

tial for violence."

The key to the weakness in Mr. Armstrong's

definition is the

statement "covering both known individuals

and organizations with a potential for violence. "

There are

many areas in the United States where known organizations and

known extremists do not operate. Nevertheless,

potential for violence in these areas because of socio-economic

conditions that breed frustrations thereby making the individuals

Involved in these areas potential sparkplugs for extrenist

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

Re:

Extremist Informant Program

The observation that SACs have a better insight

in the great majority of cases to make a final decision as to

whether a person should be operated as a PEI in connection

with the placing of an individual in an extremist organization

is not accurate in each and every case.

It is pointed out

that extremist activity is nationwide and individual FBI field

office files do not necessarily contain full information and

background concerning these organizations and the individuals

involved in these activities.

Experience has shown that

Headquarters, after considering the SAC's recommendation,

is in a better position to determine an individual's suit-

One of our greatest continuing

concerns is penetration of our informant ranks by extremist

"plants" as well as Agent provocateurs. Headquarters' review

oI Indiviaual cases, although not necessarily one hundred

percent fullproof, is an additional necessary check.

This

in no way mitigates the SAC's responsibility as his approval

and recommendation is necessary in the first instance.

4. With regard to the comment there would appear

to be very few candidates for PEI who have not been at least

charged with felony violations, it is stated that although

a great number of our informants have been charged with

violations, a felony charge in itself is not as frequent

approved PEIs shows that only seven of this forty had been

charged with a felony.

5. As to the observation concerning informants

it is noted our present

regulations as set out in Section 130, Volume IV, Manual O1

Instructions require that individuals with unsavory pack-

grounds who would not ordinarily be considered as PEIs

because of the possibility they would not make suitable

witnesses because of unfavorable characteristics such as

extensive arrest records, excessive indebtedness, emotional

approval.

(1) to obtain intelligence and (2) evidence necessary for

successiul prosecution of violations of local and Federal

statutes.

We strongly believe we must continue this

requirement to insure our objectives are attained in all

cases.

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

Re:

Extremist Informant Program

As to specific guidelines furnished to SACs with

respect to individuals in sensitive positions, SACs through

past experience, are knowledgeable of the many possible

situations where operation of an informant and subsequent

disclosure could cause concern to the FBI.

These areas

entertainment field, academicians,

to decide the areas in his particular division which could

fit in the above categories.

The samples cited in the SAC

memorandum are to serve as a flag to the SAC to remind him

of this pitfall.

OBSERVATIONS:

What we have here in the form of a memorandum to

all SACs is a completely revised Extremist Informant Program,

formulated through a long series of discussions both written

and oral, which began during the August, 1972, inspectior

of the Intelligence Division. This matter has not only beer

discussed thoroughly within the Section and Division but it

also has been discussed and analyzed by all SACs as well as

their supervisors.

As a result of proposals previously submitted,

Mr. Gray issued instructions that Messrs. Armstrong, Walters,

and Miller get together and come up with an Extremist Informant

Program which would serve the best interest of the FBI. Based

on these instructions from Mr. Gray, a completely revised

Extremist Informant Program, as set forth in the proposed

memorandum to all sals, was turnished Messrs armstrong ana

Walters for review prior to a meeting which took place on

2/20/73. This meeting was attended by Messrs. Armstrong,

Walters

and Miller as well as Mr. J. G. Deegan and

Mr. G. C. Moore of the IS-i Section.

At the 2/20/73 meeting a thorough word-by-word

and line-by-line analysis was made of the proposed Extremist

Informant Program.

Revisions were made concerning the proposals

and there was a free exchange of ideas in this regard.

organization or an unaffiliated extremist.

In order to elevate

a PEI to an EI, he must have produced authentic data on

extremist activities and be in a position to continue furnishing

extremist intelligence information.

Confidential Source-Extremist:

A CS-E is an individual who is willing to cooperate

with the Bureau by furnishing extremist information brought

to his attention by virtue of his position in the community,

by his employment, or in view of his background in extremist

activities. This individual, whose identity must be protected,

will not be actively seeking information on behalf of the

Bureau.

Prior to operating anyone as a CS-E, advise FBIHQ of

the individual's identity and the type of information he is

to furnish on a UACB basis.

OBSERVATIONS:

Our present urban informants will be evaluated to

determine if they should be considered in the future as EIs,

PEIS, CS-Es, directed to the Security or Criminal Informant

Programs, or discontinued altogether.

No individual will be operated as an EI or PEI solely

because he is in a "listening post" position. To assure we have

informant coverage in those areas where there is a potential for

violence, instructions have been issued to each SAC to insure

all Special Agent personnel are aware of the need for developing

information where there is a potential for violence. SACs will be

instructed that those Special Agents not directly involved with

extremist matters, refer those individuals who may possess informa-

MEMORANDUM TO ALL SPECIAL AGENTS IN CHARGE

(A) EXTREMIST INFORMANT PROGRAM -- Effective immediately

changes in the Extremist Informant Program as set out below are to

The revised Extremist Informant Program eliminates

the urban (ghetto) informant category and will now be limited to the

following three categories:

(a) potential extremist informant (PEI)

(b) extremist informant (EI)

(c) confidential source-extremist (CS-E)

Potential Extremist Informant:

A PEI is an individual who is in a position to furnish in-

formation concerning extremist activities of individuals and organizations.

A PEI should also be utilized to furnish information of an extremist

nature in those geographical areas where there is a potential for violence.

The personal authority of the SAC is necessary to designate

and operate an individual as a PEI with exceptions as noted below. These

informants are to be operated for a period of not more than one year and

not less than six months providing their potential is such that it appears

they will qualify for elevation to EI. The PEI must be discontinued im-

mediately following a determination that he has no future potential as

an EI.

The following are exceptions to the SAC's authority for

granting the approval of the operation of a PEI. If any of the following

conditions exist, the SAC must obtain authority from FBIHQ prior to

operating any individual as a PEI:

1. Any individual in a sensitive position (i.e. news media,

educational field or any other field where disclosure as an informant

could cause concern to the Bureau).

from FBI Headquarters.

Bureau authority is necessary to elevate a PEI to an EI.

The field recommendation must contain full justification. Il PEI does

not qualify as an El within one year, he is to be discontinued.

Extremist Informant:

An El is an individual who has been operated as a PEI for

at least six months (in order that his reliability can be properly evaluated)

and is furnishing extremist information on a regular basis whether it be

concerning an extremist organization or an unaffiliated extremist. In

order to elevate a PEI to an EI, he must have produced authentic data

on extremist activities and be in a position to continue furnishing

extremist intelligence information.

Confidential Source-Extremist:

A CS-E is an individual who is willing to cooperate with the

Bureau by furnishing extremist information coming to his attention by

virtue of his position in the community, by his employment, or in view

of his background. This individual, whose identity must be protected,

will not be actively seeking information on behalf of the Bureau. Prior

CS-Es are not to be kept in a pending status unless they

are furnishing information on a regular basis. Sources reporting in-

frequently may be operated from a pending file with a provision for

closing after a fixed period of inactivity, out of a dead file or out of a

control file. Each SAC should determine which method of operation

is best suited for his individual needs.

You may also desire to establish

an informant map which will clearly depict coverage in any geographical

area within your division.

You are instructed to carefully evaluate each of your

urban (ghetto) informants to determine if they should be considered for

redesignation as Els, PEIs, CS-Es, directed to the Security or Criminal

Informant Programs, or discontinued altogether. This should be

handled promptly and be completed within sixty days of receipt of this

communication.

Under the revised program no individual is to be operated

as an El or a PEI solely because he is in a "listening post" position.

It is your responsibility to insure that there is informant coverage in

those geographical areas where there is a potential for violence. Alert

all Special Agent personnel to the need for developing information where

there is a potential for violence. Instruct those Special Agents not

directly involved with extremist matters to refer those individuals who

may possess information of potential violence to the Extremist

Supervisor in order that the informant potential of these individuals may

be assessed.

Those informants currently carried as probationary

extremist informants should either be designated as PEls or elevated

as EIs.

Appropriate Manual changes follow.

DETAILS:

This investigation is predicated upon the

following information which reflects the full support of thè

Communist Party, USA (GPUSA) to the August 28, 1963

March on Washington:

source furnished a letter dated June 11, 1963,

on the letterlead of the CPUSA, 23 West 26th Street, Naw

York 10, New York, addressed "To All Districts" from the

"Organization Commission."

This letter reflects the

following:

"Dean Comrades:

"The march on Washington, August 28th, called by

the major organizations conducing

the fight for civil

rights, is an event of the greatest historic importance.

It deserves the support of everyone who recognizes

that this struggle is essential to guaranteeing constitutional

rights for all and for the further democratic advance of our

country.

"For this reason, we, as all other labor and

progressive groups, will lend our full support to this event.

"We urge you follow closely these developments

and that you follow the worker and Midweek Worler on the

progress c the campaign, as well as suggestions for its

further development."

June 11, 1963, rather than July 11, 1963.

INTEREST OF CPUSA IN MARCH ON WASHINGTON

A. National Leadership, CPUSA

At a meeting of leading CP functionaries

JACKSON reported on

Importance of getting legislation abolishing segregation in

all public places.

He called for a Federal policy o

non-aiscrimination, and the inclusion of on-the-job training

Ior Negroes in all areas of the United States.

JACKSON stated 100,000 to 200,000 white

people should join with the Negro people in a massive

demonstration in Wachington, D.C.: in the event of a

IlLibuster to prevent the passage

of civil rights laws.

He added a cooperative relationship must be established among

the Negro organizations.

BENJAMIN J. DAVIS remarlied everyone is calling the

Negro movement a revolution.

He said it is a

transition

of the Negro in this country from second class to first

class citizenship within the framework of our present social

system.

He continued,

"We are witnessing a revolutionary

movement in our country, but we are just not in it..."

DAVIS said the biggest single question is not the

disagreement and disunity among Negro leaders, which is

serious enough, but it is the fact that the white allies of

che Negro people are not coming into the struggle enough.

He said he would like to see a plan of action develop and

to the struggle."

IRVING POTASH commented the differences which exist

among the Negro organizations should not be permitted to

POTASH felt the trade union movement was not making

ELIZABEIH GURLEY FLYNN stated no matter how much

"we" do, It is not enough, but, on the other hand, "we"

should not underestimate the work the Party does.

JAMES E.

JACKSON stated "The Worker" must be

utilized along with Party facilities to interest the trade

union movement in the Negro struggle, and "the Party must

register its presence on the street "

At a meeting of the Organization Bureau, CPUSA,

held July 11, 1963, at CP Headquarters, New York City,

JACK STACHEL, stated the purpose of the

meeting was to discuss

the August 28th march on Washington, D.C., which he said

had two objectives:

I. To arouse the conscience of America to the

economic plight of the Negro in the United States.

2. To demand that an effective and meaningful

civil rights bill be passed by congress, to protest

against filibuster and demand majority rule in the United

States senate.

STACHEL described plans being made by organizations

preparing this demonstration and then asked rhetorically,

"How can we explain to anybody in the

future that

100,000 people went to Washington and we were not among them?"!

STACHEL proposed that, if need be, the Party

finance people to go to this demonstration. He suggested

that contact be made with Jewish clubs and national groups

such as the Hungarians, Russians, Ukranians and Armenians

in order to get people for the demonstration.

"We must convey this approach to the other Districts.

are tremendous possibilities here for contacts with the

Jewish field, the youth. It can open up a

IRVING POTASH proposed that Comrades go to

community organizations and set up groups in shops to

collect money.

He said the Party must concentrate on the

nomployment issue in Harlem, Newark and other areas "where

there are congregations of Negro population."

STACHEL proposed

further meetings on this matter

to penfect plans, stating that he thinks it possible "for

our left forces alone, if they work properly, to organize

more than five thousand people to be there in washington."

During a meeting of the National Board, CPUSA,

and invited guests, held July 31, 1903, in New YOrK, JAMES E

commenting on the Negro

struggle for integration,

said

"we" have to spell out the task for our rank and file

membership on how to most effectively utilize the

struggles to make our contribution.

In addition to being a

part of the movement, "we

have to see in this the opportunity

to build up friends with the objective of bringing them into

JACKSON-said "we" have to discuss how the Party can

do more,, because one of the aspects of this struggle is

that it is an ideolcgical struggle for the minds

of the many people who come to join

"us" in the fight.

"We!

have a pole not only as "act that is being born.

the publication of a supplement.

He commented,

'I think we can sell this for a nickel.

WILLIAM ALBERTSON expressed pleasure with the

activity going on in New York, and commented "we have in

this march a relationship between Negro and white that we have

never had before in history."

ALBERTSON said "we" have two objectives:

1. Participation by the total membership.

2. "We" take responsibility for initiating

organization on the "grass roots level" in connection with

the march....

He said there is one problem, the Puerto Ricans are

going down and are setting up their own political actior

group and there is nothing "we"

can do about it.

IRVING POTASH commented that "our Comrades" in

Industry have been instructed to make the maximum contacts

should follow up these contacts "after August 28th."

WILLIAM ATBERISON, concluding the discussion,

said that there is to be from 50 to 75 assembly points in

Washington. Each State will have an assembly point. The

smaller states will be merged. ALBERTSON then proposed that

they set up a committee of three to plan the washington

operation.

NABRIED said that there is the usual amount of

jealousy among the various organizations working on the

March, but he believes they will

be set aside "for this

historic event."

JAMES LUSTIG commented on the situation in New

Jersey, which he said was getting better.

JUsTiG, In commenting on the March, said that

the number represented will depena upon the amount of

transportation available.

He said the National Association

for the Advancement of Colorea People (NAACP) has

sponsored a train from Newark to Washington, D.C., and that

buses will be sponsored by the Congress of Racial Equality

(CORE), and will leave for Washington from Lincoln Park in

Newark, New Jersey.

and what will be decided there will be as important as the

March itself.

MORTIMER DANIEL RUBIN said that the general picture

he has regarding the March is that there will be a large

number of young people attending.

He said that a young

person from Pittsburgh had written to him saying that

between two and three thousand people are expected

to go to Washington, D.C. by train and bus.

RUBIN said

the one big problem

that has arisen is "What is our special

role in all of this?

We have people with a lot of

LOUIS WEINSTOCK said the Party has to extend

the distribution and sale of literature nationally, as

well

said

get one or two people to go out."

He said that unfortunately

"this situation applies not, only to New York but

to all sections

of the country. WEINSTOCK recommended that ten thousand

copies of "The Worker'' be distributed in various parts

of the country, since there is to be no distribution in

Washington, D.C.

He also recommended that ten thousand

pamphlets be sold at concentration points on the morning

of August 28, 1903; the remainder to be sold after the

demonstration.

RENTAMTN T. DAVIS

agreed that ten thousad

copies of "The Worker" should be distributed as a Party

enterprise.

He said that as a result there could be

a substantial increase in the paper's circulation, as

well as a build-up for the Party.

DAVIS commented that GEORGE MEANEY's statement

regarding

the Negro Movement indicates a white chauvinist

and a white supremacy attitude.

DAVIS felt that MEANeY,

because of his attitude, is turning the Negro Movement

over to the muslims and

other extremists.

He recommended

that the Party call upon workers and labor leaders to

repudiate MEANEY's statement.

At the same time "we" should

defend A. PHILIP RANDOLPH and WALTER REUTHER's attitude.

DAVIS was of the opinion that RANDOLPH would welcome a

sharp criticism of GEORGE MEANEY.

WILLIAM L. PATTERSON commented that MEANEY'S

action will have an effect.not only in selation to the

March but also to its aftermath.

He said it must be

shown that MEANEY's attitude does not reflect the attitude

of the Trade Union Movement as a whole.

PHIL BART stated that there has not been a

comparable period in the past wherein hundreds of

Communists will actually be together with tens of thousands

of others in the March.

He said efforts should be made to

work with the idea of establishing connections with new

forces.

if this proposal is adopted, someone from the caucus

group simula be on the committee, or better still,

he the chairman nê the committoo.

Propose that if the speakers committee 1s

established, a list of the various unions in New

their meeting dates in order that NALC speakers

could attend the various meetings to solicit support

for the march.

TORMEY said that this would serve to

This article reflects Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING had

reiterated his call "upon all people of good will Irom every

on page 1, an article oy JAMes E. JAcKsoN, entitled:

"A Fighting People Forging New Unity."

In this article, JACKSON reviews the massive

upsurge of the Negro masses to secure their full rights as

American citizens.

He writes that the movements unity

was dramatically affirned when Negro leaders affirmed the

determination to proceed with the August 28, 1963. March

on Washington.

In conclusion, JACKSON writes, "Anti-communism

can only foster divisionism in the ranks of the movement

at a time when the paramount resolution of all conscious

forces are striving to enhance its unity for victory in

the sharp battles

that still are to be fought in order to

consolidate gains made and to secure full freedom.

"The Negro freedom movement stands on the threshold

of a great victory.

In the mighty revolutionary upsurge of

Negro masses against segregation and discrimination,

social forces are being activized, fighting alliances of the

common people are being forged such as will carry our nation

forward to a genuine new birth of democracy, of peoples' well

being, social progress and peace."

This editorial stresses that, "The selfless, and

oiieu piunterings nole of the communists in the strugele

for the freedom and equal rights of the Negro people is

unmatched by the members of any other political party in

American life.

The Communists, Negro and white, set a

standard of leadership and service in the fight for the

just rights of the Negro people that is only now being matched

oy numerous other forces and organizations.

The editorial goes on to state, "Indeed, in the entire

phase of the modern history of the Negro freedom struggle,

contained an article by CLAUDE LIGHTFOOr entitled,

Era Dawns for Negro

PeOpLe Aster Century of streetle,

In this article, LIGHTFOOT writes that the

August 28 March on Washington and other demonstrative

actions must have as a focal point preparations for the

1964 elections.

In citing various elements of a political action

program for 1964, LIGHTFOOT states that among the issues

the Negro freedom movement should concentrate on is the

immediate, all out support of and participation in the

March on Washington.

In conclusion, Ileumont wrote that, communists

will contribute everything they possibly can to forging

unity in the struggle for these immediate goals of the

Negro freedom movement.

In this article, WILLIAM I. PATTERSON writes that

Communists are unalterably opposed to racism in any manner.

. Concerning the March on Washington, PATTERSON states

provocations will undoubtedly be made charging the infiltra

He writes,

"No such provocation must move any

person from the struggle to achieve the aims and purposes

of this March and the campaigns of struggle which everywhere .

will be aided and inspired by it.

"For the unity of all forces seeking the

destruction of racism and the political power of racists

we must devote our greatest efforts."

V. VIEWS OF CPUSA ON RESULTS OF MARCH ON

WASHINGTON AND "SUBSEQUENT ACTIVITY

A. National Leadership, CPUSA

GUS HALL stated; with respect to the March ón

Washington, that in his opinion

there were a quarter of a

million people in the March.

He stated that one quarter of

the people in the March were white and that he and the Party

could take credit for there having been so many white. people

in the March. HALI further stated the Party "had a great

deal to do with this and that the Party played a major role

in many of these white people going to Washington."

NY I-45

August 28, 1963

A meeting of leading CP functionaries was held

August 30, 1963, at CP Headquarters, New York City.

The discussion concerned itself with the civil rights

Jegislation pending in Congress

and what could be done to get

the Congress to react favorably towards this legislation now

that the March on Washington was a success.

JACK STACHEL urged that efforts should be made to

get the labor unions involved in this fight.

PATTERSON commented that demonstrations should be heda in front

oi press offices demanding editorials on the need to do away

with the filibusters

in Congress.

ARNOLD JOHNSON called for work stoppages as well as

each day,

to be increased daily as long as the Illibusters

continue.

BENJAMIN J. DAVIS, Jr., stated that the CP should

think more along the lines of a

mass movement of a non-partisan

NY 100-151548

nature, saying the struggle is for all Americans and that it

as placed the American system on trial. He noted that the

Muslims;'as a result of the March on Washington, were "buried".

DAVIS said that he

would

propose that the CP have

people

demonstrate in Washington, D.C., every day of the filibuster."

He also felt that it was possible to have ten million Negroes

move: на со

shut down everything in this country as an anti-filibustes

move. He fel that the work stoppages could be for fifteen

minutes a day on the first day and the next day incre.". the

work stoppage to a period of two hours.

He felt that it was

a legitimate demand to mobilize the American people in order

to break any filibuster.

DAVIS averred to the recent article by DAVID LAWRENCE

in the "New York Herald Tribune."

He described LAURENCE'S

column as the wors one in the entire country.

NAVly sated

that in his opinion, he did not believe that

• it would be out of

line to set up a picket line around the "New York Herald Iribune."

he said the picket line would be along the lines that DAVID

LAWRENcE must go or there must be a public apology by that

paper. DAVIS also felt that some effort should be made to force

Governor NELSON ROCKEFELLER Of New York to take an active part

in breaking any filibuster.

NY I-45

August 30, 1963

A meeting of the National Board, CPUSA, and invited

guests was held September 4, 1963, in New

York.

At this meeting, the main point on the agenda was

the March on Washington.

BENJAMIN J. DAVIS discussed the March. He characterized

It as "the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history

the country" and said there is a feeling in many quarters

that official estimates of the March were lower on attendance

figures than the number who actually participated. He stated

that although the newspapers said there were approximately 200,000,

it appeared more likely that there were close to 300,000 or

400,000.

NY 100-151548

DANIS called for the establishment of a policy

committee by the CPUSA for the purpose of bringing the

meaning of the March to the people and to act on local

problems.

He commented,

"More and more it is going to be

necessary to work on our

contribution within the framewor'

"of the March... to fight for the role of the working man...

more and more it becomes necessary to work for the ideolngy

of this particular movement and the working class...

According to DAVIS, the breaking of a filibuster "1s

the main next job"

and pressure must be put on the Prosident

of the United States to break the resistance.

stated that ROY WILKINS, Executive Secretary of the Wational

Association for the Advancement of Colored people (Naür)

had paid tribute to Dr. DU BOIS and it was his opinion

that "there seemed to be kind of a second thought that the

Negro movement at this stage in its organizational security

can ill afford its divorcement of the experience and the

substantial contribution of Negro Marxists."

JACKSON

noted that every newspaper in every country in the world has

dentifiea DU BOIS, not only as a leading literary figure, but

also as a communist.

In describing the role of the CPUSA, JACKSON said that,

"although equipped with proper foresignt and projections, it

could not be said that the practical,

of responsibility fitted the projections made tional functions

"We were one of many stimulating elements... but in this we

played a rather anonymous role and we functioned more of less

as inaividuals.

Our mission was that r undistinguishable

parts of the whole. In many areas our people were responsible

for getting fine turnouts... the stimulating role our people

playea in certain areas needed additional emphasis...as to just

what should be our particular role...it is a

sad fact that in

the huge mass role we performed anonymously. "

NY 100-151548

JACKSON then asked rhetorically "was there no special

role for the Party?"

and continued that "it points out a

serious aspect of the Party - akind of critical aspect of

organizational laxity, a problem of definition of our identity."

JACKSON was critical of the fact that

participated in the distribution of "the worker" and other

literature noting that "in spite of the fact that the

Iiterature was neatly packaged and all prepared, in spite of

the fact there were decisions and commitments, 3 or 4 people

He noted that "this is an assembly that comes once in the life-

time or à party to asocmelo cho militant, dedicates people uno

crossed hall the country, gave up their jobs for a day or so,

sacrificed to get into a social struggle.

This was a natural

pawn in which Communists should exist...to be with these

people, eat with them, meet with them,

develop address with

which they could further communicate.

JACKSON recalled the fact that, with only one

dissenting vote, it had been decided that there be a

special

edition of "The Worker" for

the March and that "a

hundred comrades should participate" in Its distribution

but, In spite of this, the one dissent was the prevailing

reaction.

GUS HALL asked how many copies

WEINSTOCK stated that 7

sold "that day"

and a total of about 1,000 pamphlets were

also sold.

WEINSTOCK remarked that final arrangements were

made three or four weeks before the affair and "there were

nineteen people at the meeting where 100 were supposed to

come, five of them non-communists..."

JACKSON stressed the need for getting better

organizational means to get people to work. He said

that, while in Washington, he had gotten

"maybe a half

dozen invitations from trade unions"

and that the trade

unions put on a remendous public relations job. He

noted that there was a Socialist Party conference for

civil rights held on Thursday and Friday following the March

attended by 100 people at the first session and about 300

people at the second session.

WILLIAM PATTERSON remarked "I think there is the

opportunity for us to strengthen our participation in the

Iodlow-up (of the August 28th March in the major districts

gust 28th March)

and states that have not only struggled for public works

programs but also other unemployment programs

MORTIMER DANIEL RUBIN stated he thought there was

an improvement in youth work in terms of participation through

mass organizations and there has been an improvement in terms

of involvement of youth in civil rights demonstrations.

IRVING POTASH commented "the country will not be

the same after this March. I think an examination will

probably show that many of our comrades played a very

Important role in bringing about or helping to bring about

the participation of quite a number of trade unionists and

trade union officials in this."

POTASH stated the CPUSA must play a very important

cole in the civil rights struggle and "the youth movement ir

particular has a terrific role to play, and first of all to

establish basic relations

with the Negro youth."

POTASH continued, "It is not difficult to establish

those unions where the Communists have a great deal of

influence.

Those were the unions which produced the greatest

participation in this March.

To some extent this is true of

certainly there is an example of left influence, Communist

stated he thought that up to now the Party has been toc

cautious and it should be put on

September 4, 1963

At a meeting of leading CP functionaries

held September 6, 1963, in New York, JAMES E. JACKSON

reported on the August 20th, 1903 March on Washington,

claiming

that "not since the Civil War have so many

official bodies of the working population of our country

associated themselves actively under the banner of the

struggle for the rights of the Negro people ."

the speeches were notable by the absence of red baiting and

there was a unity of purpose between

the leadership and those

who participated in the March.

JACKSON mentioned his attendance at a conference

during the week of the March.

very significant because it attracted to it as participants

and speakers, many of the leading personalities and key

administrators of the March.

-JACKSON commented, "One of

the very interesting contributions at this conference was

March, stating "our paper

The truth is that very little

happened to utilize

'The Worker' to establish our banner

JACKSON pointed out that, in spite of the

decision to publish a very large number of extra

copies of "The Worker" dedicated to the March, the paper

was not utilized at the March.

He described

the failure

of adequate distribution of

"The Worker"

as a serious

weakness in organization and said "Our Party is the

A meeting of leading CP functionaries was held

September 16, 1963, in New York.

JAMES JACKSON reviewed the racial situation in

Birmingham, Alabama, and announced that "The Worker" would

carry a lead editorial on the first page demanding that

Governor WALLACE of Alabama be brought to justice; demanaing

that the president establish federal occupational

authority

throughout Alabama; demanding a roundup of the membership of

the American Nationalist Party, the White Citizens Councils,

and the Ku Klux Klan; and demanding the immediate discharge

J. EDGAR HOOVER, Director of the Federal

Bureau of Investigation

(FBI), and a complete reorganization of

• the FBI.

& WILLIAM PATTERSON said that, immediately after hearing •

PATTERSON said that, while he thought JACKSON's

statement concerning the FBI

he would like to see

a special article devoted to the FBI and

was correct,"its complete failure

over the years" in relation to racial matters in the United

States.

ROBERT THOMPSON stated the CPUSA should try to bring

about effective, immediate action by the New York City Committee

on Racial Equality. He said there should be some kind of major

action in New York City, either In the nature of a mass meeting

or a march and the Party should undertake a campaign in New York

and nationally to influence public opinion in this situation.

IRVING POTASH said it is not enough to throw

responsibility on Governor WALLACE of Alabama, but it must

be stated in clear terms that the federal government also

nas a certain responsibility for what is happening in Alabama.

POTASH noted that President KENNEDY is scheduled

to appear before the United Nations (UN) and suggested it might

be advisable to set up delegations to submit petitions and

demands "even before he gets to the UN"

", thereby precipitating

a possible demonstration at the UN.

POTASH also suggested the possibility of taking the

proposed statement for "The Worker"

and reading it publicly

at some federal office, "possibly at Foley Square" in order

"to dramatize our feelings in this matter."

BEN DAVIS commented, "I feel bitterly disappointed

and bitterly dissatisfied with the response of our party."

He

said the Negro movement has now reached the stage which requires

a sharpening up of "our attack on the Kennedy administration.

DAVIS urged greater activity on the part of the CPUSA stating,

"I am of the opinion that unless our Party finds a way,

symbolically or personally, or in some other way, to integrate

itself in some public manner, if not in its own name, then

through some organization in which the Party is known to have

influence, we are just going

to get a setback that will take us

At this meeting it was stated the student council of

Tuskegee Instituté had issued an invitation to GUS HALL Or

some other representative of the CPUSA to participate in a

series of platform speakers to develop

"ideas and philosophy

occupying various positions along

the ideological spectrum.,

• HALI was requested to explain the basic philosophy of the

CPUSA, and discuss what he felt to be the main threat to the

democratic idea.

BEN DAVIS spoke of the letter from Tuskegee

Institute describing it as of greatest importance.

He

asserted that the Negroes are now willing, as are other

forces, to know what the Communist Party has to say and

to listen to Communists and welcome whatever support, guidance,

leadership, and practical sacrifice the Communists can give

"In this new stage, which is how to breal the resistance of

the Dixiecrats and how to stop the McCarran Act." DAVIS stated

that the letter from Tuskegee indicates how the

students

are thinking and "These students want to know what the

America today.

He described this as

to the role of communist youth and to the setting up of a

new organization."

A meeting of the National Board, CPUSA and invited

guests was held September 25, 1963, in New York.

The meeting concerned Itself primarily with a report

being prepared by BENJAMIN J. DAVIS, Jr. on the Negro struggle

In the United States.

BENJAMIN J. DAVIS,

Jr, discussed an outline form for

the report he is preparing.

He

said

that he did not intend

÷ :

NY 100-151548

that his report be considered an ideological report,, noting

there is "no Chinese wall" between questions of ideology and

a political Iine. He said it is possible to divide the two.

The point, of the report is to concentrate on the next step

in the Negro movement as

a whole.

DAVIS felt that the Party

had defined the character of the

Negro Revolution and "our

position" is essentially that the

in form despite the fact that

"we"egro movement is national

erroneous position of "self-determination" up with

DAVIS said that the Negro people have adopted a

method of struggle, namely "peaceful, non-violent, direct

mass action.

He said this is now the chosen method of

struggle by the Negro masses.

He said the new question coming

up, as a result of the bombings in Birmingham, is whether now

the time to abandon the whole

question of non-violent

abuion.

ne said it mus his opinion that thoy should not

abandon this theory because the purpose of the violence in

Birmingham is to provoke the Negro and to date, the Negro

has shown more self-restraint in the face of it.

Continuing, DAVIS said "we" must make it clear

that "we are for these self-defense programs of the Negroes."

He said the Negro should have the right to defend himself

against brutal attacks by racists with whatever weapons they

can. He said the Party should point out that the Federal

Government should step in and protect the Negro so that this

responsibility is not left on the Negro people. DAVIS said

the Negro people are in favor of Federal action in Birmingham

and want Federal troops to take over the

state.

He felt that

an additional goal is to break the resistance of the Dixiecrats

which means "Illegaiizing and outlawing"

all fascist organizations.

operating in the South.

DAVIS commented that the two-man truce team sent by

the KENNEDY Administration to Birmingham (KENNETH C. ROYALL and

EARL C. BLAIK) was a pitiful step by the administration.

said that KING (MARTIN LUTHER KING,

President of the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference) made a serious mistake when

he agreed to accept these two people.

DAVIS said that in

criticizing this method "we" should put the blame on the

KENNEDY Administration and not on KING.

Continuing, DAVIS stated that the great unity achieved

as a result di the August 20, March on Washington can only be

maintained by the develooment of further mass motions or this

character, adding "you cannot have unity of the Negro peoole

if they omit actions.

said the domestic leadership of

the Negro movement, in one form or another, is tied in some

"way to the KENNEDY Administration.

This is a situation

that requires greater independence on the part of the Negro

movement and its leaders.

The key question 1s "how to get

our line out and how to fight for it and how the party is

going

to exert some control and some influence."

DAVIS stated that the August 28, March on Washington

was not only a historical and unprecedented demonstration of

the unity of the Negro people as well as the white people, but

that the March transferrad ihe responsibility to the Federal

Government and to the American citizen.

He said the next

has to be a step

step, following Birmingham and the bombings lat the demonstration"

involving masses of people. Since everyone

took a pledge to sit in,

to stand in, to demonstrate, now is the

time, in my opinion, for the leaders

of the Negro movement to

use this to advantage. DAVIS stated that the South in the next

Iive years will be the additional force which can be brought

Into the progressive movement and

will help change the whole

relationship of forces.

He said "somehow our party has to appear

as the champion of the Negro people's movement and as the

champion of

the very low poverty levels of living of the white

masses in the south."

He said this has to be done and it is not being done

at the present time. There is no representative form of

government in Alabama, Mississippi and other states. The

focus of attention should be on what is the main source of

resistance in the south today,

the implementation of the rights

of the Negro people. DAVIS felt that there was a need for some

center from which a

consistent policy and leadership could be

given in order to reach wide sections of the Negro people.

He said it should be something broad, something militant, something

which gives action from another center and which gives direct

leadership in such

said it was time that "we went around

and talked to some of the Negro leaders in order to,see how this

could be developed.

He said

"we have to have a form in which

acknowledged that this

"means money and it means a thorough

DAVIS also remarked that Harlem is a problem that

must be solved because other forces have taken over the Harlem

community "and the Party is no where around "we" have to keep

He said this is

the number one Party problem to be solved.

• In mind the image of

among the Negro people as well

as the white workers and progressives throughout the country.

Following DAVIS' comments a discussion period

followed.

ROBERT THOMPSON said that the main object of

the report is to develop the question "What is required now

to successfully force federal intervention in Alabama?"

He said that "we" have to defend KING's leadership in this

movement.. especially the leadership that KING represents.

THOMPSON remarked that he did not agree that there was

a need for a new center for the civil rights movement

as suggested by DAVIS. He said it would not serve a

useful purpose and such a center would be a focal point

for the gathering of "every flighty element that is trying

to horn in on the real movement."

THOMPSON said "we" have to think about the

development of the strength and role of the Negro-American

Labor Council (NALC). He said their activities can play

a real part and can be expanded to shape the program of

the civil rights movement.

GUS HALL expressed the opinion that there is a

need now to discuss the question of a new party, a party

of labor and Negro. There is a need to discuss a new

emerge as a giant political action.

He felt that there was

there should be a lobby down

ARNOLD JOHNSON stated that labor will play an

important role in the Negro movement and he was in favor

IRVING POTASH stated that there was a need for

unity in the Negro movement.

He said "our party"

has projected this idea and

the Party should signify

the weakness of this unity. He said that the right of self-

defense by the Negro is a most important question and "we"

should take a forthright position on it. He said the

Negro patrols in Birmingham have our support in view of the

fact that the Federal authorities are not carrying out

their responsibilities. He said that if the Federal

authorities were carrying

out their responsibilities, it would

be a different situation.

GILBERT GREEN commented that what had been

discussed can be the basis for a good report. He said

there is a need to take the Negro freedom struggle off

the streets and into the courts.

should not impose the party on this movement. We should do

nothing which will either turn this movement into an anti-

administration to break with the Dixiecrats and this will

guarantee the renovation of the south.

The March was orderly and calm, without any incidents

which would have detracted from it.

been raised to a new level by the March. The struggle for

equality is a struggle for all Americans not, for Negroes

alone.

The March was

excellent but the murder of Negioes

in Alabama and the fact that police brutality 1s still a

major issue against Negroes should have been brought out more

in the March.

The leaders of the March should concentrate on

these proposals in regard to civil rights and a strong

Fair Employment Practices Commission.

They should see that

the Negro is protected in his right

to vote in the south

and a fight made for full equality in the struggle for jobs.

The Negro fight or jobs is a test for the labor movement

and Negro and white allies.

This fight should be concentrated

Industry by industry and understanding in trade unions raised

Although the karch was good, there was not enough

rganization in the grass root section of the morement.

specially in the puerto Rican cormunity. Few Puerto Rican:

took part because they were not organized and were not told what

the March was all abouï.

The Puerto Ravan Movement should be

built up and this is one field the Pariy could move into and

do a good job.

The Negro American Labor Council was not as successful

as It should have been in the March. Ihis organization has

been going downhill since its last convention in its fight for

Negro rights. However, individua: leaders, especially A.

PHILIP RANDOLPH, showed great strength and

character.

The formation of the new Negro party is a danger

to the Negro movement at the present time.

It is a danger

to the

Negro movement because its name will split the movement

itself.

In regard to the Party activity in the March, "The Worker"

ald not effectively reach the hands of those who attended this

event. Very few volunteers showed up to distribute

C. LOCAL CP CLUBS, NEW YORK DISIRIOT

JAMES TORMEY gave a report on the Negro Movement

and the August 28, 1963 March on Washington,

at a meeting of the CP caucus in the New York Chapter of

the Negro American Labor Council (NALO).

TORMEY advised tho iulioning in hio isport:

The Negro Movement is a revolutionary movement

aimed at the elimination of the residue of slavery and

Intimidation of the Negro people.

Reverend MARTIN LUTHER

KING has said that the whole Movement is a basic attack

against the power structure of the United States

that this is most important because it is a Marxist approach

to the problem coming from a Negro leader.

concerning the August 20, 1963, March on Washington,

the Negro leadership estimated 250,000 people participated

with an estimate of approximately thirty per cent white people.

This is very important to the overall success of the March.

The Muslim and Black Nationalist Movement suffered

a serious setback because of the March on Washington, the way

It was received and the way that it was carried out without

any riots or fighting.

The efforts of the progressives to obtain the labor

unions participation in the CIvil Rights and Negro Movement

I's tantamount to saving labor unions. If the Labor Movement

does not become involved in this struggle they could be

seriously weakened. Labor seriously needs the alliance

with the Negro Movement.

It was stated by one of the members present that

that President KENNEDY, by being so nice, had robbed the

March of its militancy. President KENNEDY, by endorsing the

March, attracted many people to the March who otherwise would not

have attended.

It was further felt that a bad part of the March

was the failure of those participating not to realize that

the United States must have socialism to bring about civil

rights and end unemployment.

INDEPENDENT SOCIALIST LEAGUE (ISL), formerly

known as the Workers Party (WP)

The May 4, 1942, issue of "Labor Action"

cial publication of

Party (SWP).

The article stated that when the Hitler-Stalin Pact

was signed

and Poland invaded, the minority group within the SWP,

in proclaiming the formation of the WP, condemned the pact as

being imperialistic in nature and stated it would not support

either imperialist camp.

The April 25, 1949, issue of "Labor Action" contained

an account of the Fifth National Convention of the WP, held March

24-27, 1949, in New York City, which reflected the change of name

of the organizaiion from the ip to the independent socialist.

League (ISL) in order to emphasize the character of the group as

a propaganda group for the spreading of socialist ideas and not

as a full-fledged political party.

The July 14, 1958, issue of "Labor Action", an oificial

publication of the ISI, contained an article captioned "The ISI

Program in Brief". The

article indicated:

"The ISL stands for

socialist democracy and against the two systems of exploitation

which now divide the world:

capitalism and Stalinism.

The ISt,

as a Marxist movement, looks to the working class and

present struggle as the basic progressive torce in society.

The

Ish is organized to spread the ideas of socialism in the labor

movement and among all other sections of the people. There can

be no lasting and genuine democracy without socialism and there

can be no socialism without democracy."

The September 22, 1958, issue of "Labor Action" con-

tained an undated statement signed by the Political Committee of

the ISL which indicated that the ISL had been dissolved.

The

statement urged former ISL members to join the Socialist

its influence.

Cohen further stated, according to the source, that

the object of Labor Youth League (LYL) members within the

organization would be to control it.

The LYL has been designated by the Attorney General

SOCIALIST YOUTH LEAGUE (SYL)

A source advised that the Socialist Youth League (SYL)

began in 1945 when several militant members of the Young

People's Socialist League (YPSL), the youth organization

of the socialist Party, accepted

a proposal that they become

affiliated with the Workers Party.

The first issue of the group's

newspaper, "Youth Action for Socialism,"' in Only socalism can

contained an article which indicated that "

youth our a eatens the only national revolutionary

The March 1, 1954, issue of the "Young Socialist

Challenge," published as page three of "Labor Action," an

official publication of the Independent Socialist League, con-

tained an article concerning the creation of the Young Socialist

League (YSL) which pointed out that ataunity conference occurring

February 12-14, 1y54, at Labor Action Hall, New York, New Yoris,

a merger occurred between the YPSu and the SYL. The

nEW

organization was named the YSL..

A second source on June 15, 1954, made available the

minutes of the YSL's National Action Committee meeting of

April 13, 1954, which reflected that one

S. Siteman, "Chairman

of SP (Socialist Party) Youth Committee," had objected

to a statement appearing in "Commerce,"

a New York University

journal, which indicated that the Yesu merged with the sit to

form the YSL.

He explained that the YPSu did not merge with

anyone, that it continued to exist as the youth section of

the socialist Party.

He explained that a small group of the YPSI

was aropped, expelled, or suspended from that organization

and joined the syL, which he characterized as the youth group

of the "Trotskyite

former members of the YPSI joined the SYl, the SYL then proceeded

YOUNG SOCIALIST LEAGUE (YSL)

The March 1, 1954, issue of the "Young Socialist

Challenge," published

as page three of "Labor Action," an

official publication of the Independent Socialist League (ISL),

contained an article concerning the creation of the YSL,

which pointed out that at a unity conference occuring February

12-14, 1954, at Labor ACtion Hall, New York, New Iork, a merger

occurred between the Young People's Socialist League (YPSL) and

the Socialist Youth League (SYL). The new organization was

named the YSL.

On June 15, 1954, a source made available the minutes

of the YSL'S National Action Committee meeting of April 13, 1954,

which reflected that one S. Siteman, "Chairman of SP (Socialist

Party) Youth Committee," had objected to a statement appearing

in "Commerce," a New York University journal, which indicated

that the YPSL merged with the syL to torm the YSL. He explained

that the YPSL did not merge with anyone,

that it continued to

exist as the youth section of the Socialist Party.

He explained

that a small group of the YESL was dropped, expelled, or

suspended from that organization and joined the SYL, which he

characterized as the youth group of the "Trotskyite

ISL". He

explained that after these few former members of the YPSu joined

, the sYL, the SYL then proceeded to change its name for its own

purposes.

On April 9, 1956, a second source advised that the YSL

has frequently worked in close sympathetic cooperation with the

ISt toward similar objectives, although each major issue given

mutual consideration is decided upon by these organizations

individually. The YSL serves as an apprenticeship for the

Ish, but ISh selection of members from Ist ranks is made on

an individual and personal basis. In may instances Ish members

are also members of the ISL. The YSL and the ISL utilize the

same printing house

in New York City and the YSL publication is

printed as an insert in "Labor Action." Frequently, lecturers

before the YSu are ISL members.

WORKERS WORLD PARTY

on April 17, 1959, a confidential source advised

that on february 12, 1959, a Socialist Workers Party (SWP)

minority group, under the leadership of National

Committee member, SAM BALLAN, split from the swe.

The source stated that this minority group,

referred to as the Marcyites, after many years of program and

policy differences on varied issues concerning tactics and inter-

pretation of political events, split from the SWe on the

grounds that the Party was liquidating itself by

departing from the Marxist precepts of IEON TROISKY and

retreating from the fight for the world socialist revolution.

sister

petty - bourgeois.

The minority program, according to ine source,

advocates unconditional defense of the Soviet Union and

has as its goal the building of a revolutionary party

with a complete proletarian orientation

for the purpose of overthrowing capitalism in

the United States and throughout the world.

On May 12, 1950, the source advised that this

minority group had chosen the name Workers World Party.

On May 6, 1963, a second confidential source

stated that the headquarters of the Workers World Party

were located at 45 west Zlst Street, New York, New York.

The SWP and the CP have been designated by the

Attorney General of the United States pursuant to

Executive Order 10450.

Although statements of the leaders of organizations

involved in the march on Washington set for August 28, 1963,

10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.I., plus facts reported by our sources toys

date indicate a "peaceful demonstration" and that violence may latem

be averted, nevertheless, we are bending every effort to

secure in advance detailed information as to the make-up,

size,

and the mode of transportation of local groups which will

attend, are keeping the Department and interested agencies advised.

of all pertinent developments, have arranged for visual and

photographic coverage by Washington Field Office, and have

demonstrations occur in the Federal triangle area.

Apparent through the lack of coordination existing

between the National Association for, the Advancement of Colored

People (NAACP) and the Congress of'Racial Equality (CORE), the

oftentimes divergent vertebrae providing principal support to

racial demonstrations, is the possibility that since organizations

sponsoring the march on Washington many times have not presented

a unitied front on a local basis, it will be even more difficult.

for the march leaders to establistria cohesive operation on a

nation-wide basis.

For example, information received 7/24/63 from

our Little Rock sources specifically pointed up such a situation

when the CORE representative issued statements concerning an

"ultimatum" which was going to be forthcoming if racial conditions

were not improved while NAACP leaders in the area separated

themselves from this position with "no comment" answers to press

inquiries.

Memorandum to Mr. Belmont

RE: MARCH ON WASHINGTON

Our source at a principal focal point of racial

activity, Albany, Georgia, indicated exhortations were being

nade to recruit marchers on a pay-your-way basis. Although

Local authorities have been gravely beset with demonstration

problems, by the same token demonstrators have experienced

a drain on funds and energies which may have developed a

recruiting problem.

All divisions have been ordered to alert Klan and hate

informants, racial informants, and other sources to obtain specific

details concerning the formation of delegates, mode of travel,

and other pertinent details. All divisions have likewise been

instructed to maintain close liaison with security informants

for information as to possible participation of subversive

organizations.

Each SAC has been impressed with the fact this

is a personal and continuing responsibility.

The Domestic Intelligence Division has learned that an

official of the Communist Party USA at a meeting of functionaries

held 7/11/63 stated the party should finance people to attend the

march on Washington, although no formal organization exists along

these lines.

The possibility of communist participation has

been furnished to the Civil Rights Division and the Internal

--

Security Division of the Department by Domestic Intelligence.

Any further developments along this line will be made known

immediately to interested divisions of the Department and other

appropriate agencies.

The assurance of orderly activity given by demonstration

leaders is complemented by recognition of their right to demonstrate

announced publicly by the Administration, the incentive that

violence might prejudice possible passage of favorable legislation

plus advanced planning by the Washington Metropolitan Police

Department.

Washington Field is maintaining close liaison with

the Metropolitan Police Department so as

to be informed of plans

of local police authorities.

Reports Irom a confidential source which has been

authorized to provide close coverage of Clarence Jones, the

attorney for Reverend Martin Luther King, JI., will be

watched closely by the Domestic Intelligence Division for

pertinent information for our own intelligence and dissemination

purposes. initially the Attorney General requested such coverage

of the Reverend Mr. King but later indicated he had decided not

to authorize such.

The Laboratory Division is alerted personnel-wise

and equipment-wise as to the special needs for photographic

coverage and other possible demands for urgent laboratory

examinations as well as communication needs of-the Washington

Field Office and has coordinated this matter with Washington

Field.

The Special Investigative Division, which occupies

first floor space in close proximity to the public entrances

and public corridors, has especially alerted all employees

to the need for the utmost discretion in their conduct both

In and out of the building, the need for security precautions,

and the desirability of remaining away from windows and

continuing in their normal duties during any demonstration

which might occur. Pursuant to my memorandum of 7/19/63 all

other divisions also have been alerted to emphasize to all

employees the need to be most circumspect in conduct in and

out of the building did to re-emphasizo cur security precautions

which are always in effect.

As previously indicated Washington Field Office is

coordinating the investigative activities necessary for coverage

of events which may take place, and

pursuant to my memorandum

of 7/19/63 Supervisor Joseph C. Trainor, Room 2266, 1s correlating

information concerning the demonstration at the Seat of

Government.

The suggestion of the Laboratory Division that some

•Seat of Government bureau automobiles should be dispersed away

from the building so that any bottling up may be prevented has

been referred to the Administrative Division for consideration.

As a matter of information, WO has advised the cars

of the Hashington Field Office will be operated out of the

usual storage facilities, located out of the proposed

demonstration area, and controlled from the investigative

headquarters of the field office, being deployed as the need

for coverage develops in the event of a demenstratien.

RE:

MARCH ON TASHINGTON

The Administrative Division, in addition to

alerting all employees, has noted the

possibility that

a larger-than-usual number of applicants for Bureau

employment might appear on August 28, 1963, and, therefore,

has made arrangements for a sufficient™

supply of materials

and the presence of Special Agent Supervisors to conduct

applicant interviews called for.

The Administrative Division has also been in

contact with the Superintendent of the General Services

Administration Protection Branch for the Justice Building

which has advised that maximum available guard force will

be arranged for August 28 through adjusting reporting hours,

changing days off and in some cases cancelling annual leave

of guards.

Superintendent of the Protection Branch has

advised that if developments appear to warrant it, con-

sideration will be given to closing all entrances

of the

Justice Building with the exception of the Minth Street

and Pennsylvania Avenue entrance

and" the Tenth Street

automobile entrance, both of which are patrolled by guards.

The Inspection Division has alerted all personnel

with reference to security precautions and conduct and is

submitting a separate memorandum to that effect.

Although separate memoranda are not being submitted

at this time by divisions other than those named above,

the

following action has been taken by these divisions as of

July 29, 1963.

The Identification Division, although housed in a

building to which the public is not generally admitted, has

arranged to establish extra security patrols on each entrance.

In addition, Special Agent Supervisors will be stationed in the

vicinity of entrances during the duration of the demonstration.

However, so as to avoid generating à premature wave of alarm

among clerical employees of the IdentifICation DIvIsIon,

actual discussions of special security precautions will be

withheld until a later date.

The Training Division has, in addition to alerting

employees, instituted considerations as to wether a possible

problem of traffic congestion and demands on housing which

may occur during the demonstration.

The Training Division

Will be in contact with the Administrative Division on this

point.

Files and Communications Division, in addition to alerting

personnel, will take extra precautions with respect to the

courier service between the Riddell, Justice and Identification

Division Buildings noting it may become necessary. to reroute

or suspend this service temporarily.

The security patrol

force will be especially alerted and consideration will be

given to locking the doors to this division's space if

developments so warrant.

The Crime Records Division has advised that no

additional action is being. taken at this time in addition to

the general alert already in effect.

ACTION:

WORKERS WORLD PARTY

CONFIDENTIAE

On April 17, 1959, a source advised that on February

12, 1959, a Socialist

Workers Party (SWP) minority group,

under the leadership of National Committee member,

SAM BALLAN,

split from the swP.

The source stated that this minority group, referred

to as the Marcyites, after many years-of program and policy....

aifferences on varied issues concerning tactics and interpre-

tation of political events,

split from the SWP on the grounds

that the Party was liquidating itself by departing from the

Marxist precepts of LEON TROTSKY and retreating from the fight

for the world socialist. revolution.

The final issue which

ultimately forced the split was the minority's opposition to

the SWP regroupment policy which involved cooperation with the

communist Party (CP) periphery - Individuals characterized by

the minority as petty-bourgeois:

The minority program, according to the source, advo-

cates unconditional defense of

the Soviet Union and has

as its

goal the building of a revolutionary party with a complete

proletarian orientation for the purpose of overthrowing capi-

talism in the United States and throughout the world.

On May 12, 1960, the source advised that this minority

group had chosen the name

Workers world Party.

On April 18, 1962, the source stated that the head-

quarters of the Workers World Party were located at 46 west

2ist Street, New York, New York.

The SWP and the CP have been designated by the

Attorney General of the United States pursuant to Executive

Order 10450.

APPENDIX

WOMEN'S PEACE AND UNITY CLUB,

Formerly known as the

Chicago Women for Peace

The aims and purposes of the Chicago Women for Peace

(CWP) as set forth in Its self-identified publication, "Chicago

Acts for Peace" (CAP), May, 1951, Issue, describes this organi

zation as a "service center for

women working for peace." This

publication described the CHP as being affiliated with the

American Women for Peace and as cooperating with the American

Peace Crusade (APC) .

solution of the American Women for Peace and the affiliation

of the CWP with the APC Council in Chicago.

A source advised in November, 1956, that the CWP

remalned attitlated with the ArC, Chicago, until that organiza-

cion aissoLved in septender, 1255. the CiP continued with no

national aiiillation until Soptember, 1956, shor = "reorganiza»

tion and name change took place," and it became known as the

"Women's Peace and Unity Club" (WPUC) •

The reason given for this

"reorganization and name change" by DOROTHY HAYES, Secretary of

the organization at that time, was that the CHP had been formed

to end

the korean War, and since that war was over and there was

a "measure of peace in the world," women's interests were more

centered on such issues as civil

rights, desegregated and better

schools, juvenile delinquency, equal opporturities for women,

housing,

and cost of living.

Source advised that the only actual

"reorganization" of the CWP was the change of its name to "Women's

Peace and Unity Ciub."

A second source advised in October, 1956, that the

Communist Party (CP), Illinois-Indiana District, had ordered the

dissolution of the CWP because it no longer served the purpose

of the Party since It was a "left-wing" peace group. Though the

CHP refused to dissolve and chose to continue in the form of

the "Womens Peace and Unity Club," it continues to be a "communist

front organization" whose policies and activities are directed

by CP members.

A third source advised on May 14, 1963, that the WUC,

as of that date, continued to operate in the Chicago area as a

peace organization under the direction and controlcof CP wembers

and its objectives continued to be the same.

The Anerican Homen for Peace and the APC have been

designated pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

WORKERS WORLD PARTY

On April 17, 1959, a source advised that on

February 12, 1959, a Socialist Workers Party (SWP) minority

group, under the leadership of national committee member SAM

BALLAN, known in the SWP as SAM MARCy, spllt from the sWe.

The source stated that this minority group

referred to as the Marcyites, after many years of program

and policy aifferences on varied issues concerning tactics

interpretation of political events, split from the

swe on the grounds that the Party was liquidating itself

by departing from the Marxist precepts of LEON TROTSKY

and retreating from the fight for the world socialist

revolution.

The final issue which ultimately forced the

split was

the minority's opposition to the swe regroupment

policy which involved cooperation with the Communist Party

(CP) periphery - individuals characterized by the minority

as petty-bourgeois.

The minority program, according to the source,

advocates the unconditional defense of the Soviet Union and

has as its goal the building of a revolutionary party with a

•complete proletarian orientation for the purpose of over-

throwing capitalism in the United States and throughout

the world.

On May 12, 1960, the source advised that this

minority group had

chosen

the name Workers World Party with

headquarters located at 46 west 21st Street, New York,

New York.

The SWP has been designated pursuant to Executive

Order 10450.

"The growing influence of the irredentist forces

upon the policies of our nation as indicated by the alarming

drift towards war and the outlawing of the COMMUNIST PARTY (CP)

progressive and

liberal forces to unite in a common party."

In a leaflet entitled "Call to Progressive Minded

America" issued by the LNVP, its founding convention was

scheauled for November 25, 1961, in New York City. The aims

and purposes were listed as:.

1. For the resurgence of the American Labor Movement.

Go For the winning of the struggle for Negro rights.

3..For an end of the cold war.

. For economic security and higher mass living standards.

5. For the end of the exploitation of man by man.

A source advised on December 19, 1961, that CLARENCE

COGGINS is considered the Provisional Chairman of the LNVP.

Other active members include BERNARD (WHITEY) GOODFRIEND,. ALVIN

Reverend Lovell

Johnson, & Pastor

in & Minneapolis church having a predominantly Negro member-

ship is known to have commented that, the March having been

ultimately did bring the support of the NAACP behind the Minne-

sota March Committee and was given assurances that every

• possible measure would be taken to keep the Minnesota dele-

gation free of subversive influences.

The contributions made to the Minnesota Committee

have not as yet been completely tabulated.

It is known

that a number of labor groups have promised support.

Thusfar, according to both MP T-1 and MP T-2,

there has been no

appreciable nor effective communist or

otherwise subversive influences on the activities of the

Kinnesota. March

to Washington Committee.

In July 1963, Betty Smith, who is an active and

leading member of the Minnesota-Dakotas District of the

Conmunist Party (MDDCP), had made attempts to place certain

individuals which as yet have been unnamed by her on the

committee and in the delegation from Minnesota which will

go to Washington. It is known that on the morning of August

12, 1963, Ralph Taylor, Chairman, MDDCP, approached another

member of the MDDCP to

discuss the possibilities of having

& person named by Taylor go to Washington with the Minnesota

delegation.

MP T-1 has indicated that the participation

of this individual in the March is an extremely remote

possibility.

The Minnesota delegation will depart Minneapolis-

St Paul International Airport on a chartered American

Airlines plane between 3 A.M. and 4 A.M. on August 28,

1963 .

Before any person will be permitted to board the

plane that person will be required to execute a formal

non-violence pledge which restricts that person from engag-

ing in violence of any character whatever the provocation

might be. The pledge cautions that any participant in the

delegation who is involved in violence will be summarily

abandoned by the remainder of the delegation and will not

be permitted to return to Minneapolis aboard the chartered

plane.

The delegation will return to Minneapolis on the

evening of August 28, 1963.

MARCH ON WASHINGTON

August 28, 1963

•SI I-l advised on August 9, 1963 that the headquarters of

the Negro Américan Labor Council (NAIC) in New York City was sending

to the St. Louis area approximately 8,000 leaflets and 500 three to

four page booklets pertaining to the March on Washington.

These

were for dissemination among people possibly interestea,

however,

none of them'have arrived as yet. This source stated that other

organizations in the St. Louis area were being invited to partici-

pave In the march and these organizations included integrationist

organizations, labor and social organizations.

Source stated that

attempts are being made at this time to raise funds to finance the

trip to Washington inasmuch as It had been ascertained that the

chartering of a bus would cost approximately $800.00 or more from

St. Louis. This source said no bus had yet been chartered inasmuch

. as personnel willing to go are lacking.

This source. also stated that the plans call for the

hiring of a Greyhound Bus which would take the group to Washington,

D.Co, where they would remain during the daytime only and Immediately

and Immediately

return with no stopover.

The source stated that there was a feeling

among NALC leaders that

the Committee on Racial Equality (CORE)

was attempting to take over a part of this march and this was .

resented on the part of NALC officials.

This source reiterated

that there is no enthusiasm in'St.' Louis for this trip. He knew

of no one who was going.

SI T-2 advised on August 8, 1963 It was his opinion there

would be a very small representation

from the St.

Involved. SL T-2 advised that he felt attempts were being made

to make the trip a peaceful one in every respect and that at least

from the St. Louis area there was a feeling that any demonstration

In Washington which might take place might center around the

United States Senate inasmuch as it was felt the greatest problem

with civil rights legislation and civil rights matters was

encountered in the Senate of the United States rather than any

other branch of the Government. This source knew of no one who

was making the trip.

SI I-3 advised that to his knowledge no one was going

from the St. 'Louis area on the Washington, D.C. trip on August 20,

1903 and he felt the reason for this was the cost involved especially

as it applies to those who might make the trip not being financially

able to do so.

SI T-4 advised on August 8, 1963 that it was his under

standing nearly forty people had expressed an interest in making

the trip

to washingion, D.C., and thât this number would be one

bus 10ad.

This source

stated that it is his understanding there

would be

three drivers on the one bus in order that the bus would

not make a stop en route to Washington or on, the return trip.

was to avoid the possibility of incident.

This source stated that

not be in Washington, D.C.

more than twelve hours and it was anticipated no problems en route

except possibly in the immediate suburban area around

Washington,

on August 9, 1963, SI T-5 advised that Owen

Lutz, whom

the informant described as a member of the Freedom

Committee (characterized in the attached appendi), stated that

he had attempted to contribute to the National Association for the

St: Louls, Missouri:

SI T-5 also advised at this time that Owen Lutz was

Lutz that they would not take his money nor would they permit

Dolores Richardson to make the trip under any circumstances

In view of the fact that she was a woman of loose morals and

one whose character was no good and could only bring discredit

upon the NAACP.

This source knew of no one who was making the

trip to Washington, D.C.

SI I-6 advised on August 8 and 9, 1963 from information

available to him even though there have been two inquiries made

regarding bus transportation to Washington, D.C., no plans have

yet been made to actually charter or reserve a bus to go to

Washington, D.C. from

the St. Louis area.

This source advised

that it was his understanding inquiry has also been made in

Kansas City, Missouri regarding the chartering or reserving of

a bus to leave from Kansas City, Missouri and a secona bus to

Leave from Kansas City, Kansas for Washington, D.C. on August 28,

1963.

This source advised that only inquiries have been made and

no actual reservations. The source stated that the cost of

chartering a bus would be somewhere between $800.00 and $900.00

and that no bus could be reserved until this money were actually

deposited.

This source also advised that if a Greyhound Bus were

chartered for the occasion, the bus would go non-stop from St. Louis

to Washington, D.C., and non-stop return and takes approximately

24 hours for the

trip one way.

This source stated that the only

stops the bus would make would be for rest periods and food and

the food facilities where the bus would stop would only be those

utilized by Greyhound.

This source also advised on August 9, 1963

that unless a bus were reserved or chartered about ten days before

August 28, 1963, It would be very difficult to charter one after

that time for the 28th.

Re: MARCH ON WASHINGION

August 28, 1963

The article stated that the buses will leave Cleveland

at 7:00 PM on August 27, 1963, and will leave Washington as soon

the demonstration is over on August 28, 1963.. .

On the same date, another article in the Cleveland

"Plain Dealer," reflected that the Cleveland chapter of the

Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) plans to send a total of

78 persons on two chartered buses to the August 28, 1963,

demonstration. The article reflected that the buses will

leave Cleveland at 12:00 midnight on August 27, 1963.

On August I2, 1963, a source, who has furnished

reliable information in the past, advised that the buses

sponsored by CORE will return to Cleveland as soon as the

march is over in washington on August 20, 1903. He statec

ne had heard that two or three members of the socialist

Workers Party Isup! might go to Washington for the demon-

stration but did not now as yet if they would go with the

CORE group. He stated that these SWP members do not plan

to cause any trouble and would not make their identities

as sWP members known if they go with a group.

The SWP has been designated by the Attorney General

of the United States pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

An article

reflected that the Reverend George Short, President of the

Elyria chapter of the_NAACP, announced that his group would

hire a büs to take Elyrians to Washington for the march on

August 28, 1963.

This advertisement announced the formation

oi the FPCC in New Yori City and declared the FPCC intended to

promuigate "the truth about revolutionary Cuba" to neutralize

the distorted American press.

"The New York Times" edition of January 11, 1961,

reported that at a hearing condusted before the United States

senate Internal Security Succormittee on January 10, 1961, Dr.

charles A. Santos-Büch identifiad himseif and Robert Taber as

organizers of the FPCO. Hs aiso testified ha and Taber obtained

funds from the Cuban Government which were applied toward the

cost of the afore-mentioned advertisement.

On May. 16, 1963, a source advised that during the

first two jears of the FPCCiS

existence there was

a struggle betweer

Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers Party (SWP) elements to

exert their power within the FPCC and thereby influence FPCC policy.

However,

during tha past Joar this source observed there has been a

successin AiLor+ ry FPCC. Jeadership to minimize the role of these

and other organizations in the FPCC so that today their influence

in negligible.

On May 20, 1963, a second source advised that the

National Headquarters

of the FPCC is located in Room 329 at 799

Broadway, New York City.

According to this source, the position

This source observed lde has followed a course of entertaining

and accepting the cooperation of many other organizations including

the CP and the SWP when he has felt it would be to his personal

benefit as well as bre

• FPCO:S.

However, Lee has indicated to this

source he has no intonsion of

permisting FPCO policy to be determined

by any othar organization.

Lee feels ths FPCO should advocate

resumption of diplomatis relations between Juba and the United States

and support the right of lubans to manage their revolution without

interference from other nations, but not support the cuban revolution

per se.

The CP and the swe have been designated pursuant to

Executive Order 10450.

RE: HYMAN DAVID JENKINS

A fifth source reported that at a meeting of

cussing the school's future, JENKINS said that he was

the person who had started the els and had for many years

devoted a tremendous amount of time and work toward the

school. JENKINS said that during the past few years the

school had adopted a policy with which he did not agree

and. that if the school continued to teach the present

courses he did not see why he should assist it. JENKINS

said that if the CLS would change its political orientation

from pushing a pro-Marxist line andævote itself simply

to educating the working people in the San Francisco area

along the lines of general educational courses he would

again be willing to support the school.

A sixth source advised on September 25, 1957

that at a CP meeting held in September, 1957, It was

mentioned that JENKINS dropped from the Party but was not..

an enemy of the Party.
