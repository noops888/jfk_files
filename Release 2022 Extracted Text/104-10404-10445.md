Sergio Vicente ARCACHA Smith (Enclosure 2 of reference memorandun)

DPOB: 22 January 1923, Cuba

1. Traces on ARCACHA do not reflect the date he first
arrived in the U.S. However, he became the FRENTE REVOLU-
CIONARYO DENOCRATICO (FRD) delegate in New Orleans prior
to the Bay of Pigs invasion and continued in that position
until the FRD ceased to function, The FRD wus the predecessor
of the CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL, and was organized and
supported by the Agency. The organization was used as a '
front for recruitment of Brigade 2506 for the invasion,

During this period ARCACHA reported to the FRD headquarters
in Miami through a post office box in Coral Gables, and

. reportedly maintained extensive relations with the New

Orleans FBI and Immigration offices. Two of his regular _
FBI contacts were a Mr. De Bruce and the deceased Guy
Banister,

2. ARCACHA was also one of the promoters of the
FRIENDS OF DEMOCRATIC CUBA, INC (FDC) which was incorporated
in New Orleans on 6 January 1961, This organization was
ostensibly. created by several New Orleans business and
political figures, including the deceased former ¥BI agent,
Guy Banister, to collect money to aid Cubans in their
fight against Communism, According to the articles of
incorporation, these donations would also be used to support
the FRD and the funds were to be channeled through ARCACHA,
less a percentage to be retained by the FDC. An invest
gation conducted by a reliable Miami Station asset concluded
that the FDC was organized strictly for the personal gain
of the promoters with the approval and collaboration of
AKCACHA, The investigation produced no evidence that any
individual donations were ever solicited or received and
recommended that the funds of the Stevedores Union and the
books of the New,Orleans Exporters Company be investigated
for evidence of personal gain and possible evidence of
federal tax evasion, since both the president of the New
Orleans Exporters Company, Gerard F, Tuiague, and the Chief
of New Orleans Stevedores Union, Alfred Chittenden, were
officials of the FDC, Approximately one month after the
FDC was created, strong criticism from some prominent Cubans
put the organization out of business.

3. Information in an immigration card reflects that
ARCACHA travelled to Caracas, Venezuela at an unspecified
date, Mis address in Venezuela was HOTEL TIUNA, Caracas,
and his US address was listed as 4523 Duplesses Street,
New Orleans. Passport No, 00433,

DPOB: 15 July. 1929, New Orleans, Louisiana
1. Subject is Alberto Casimir FOWLER Perillait, a
member of Brigade 2506 who was captured duiing the invasion

and returned to the US in the December 1962 prisoner

lost his US citizenship during his years of residence in
Cuba and immigration records indicate he applied for advance
parole status in November 1964 while he was still employed
in W. Pain Beach, He apparently returned to Louisiana
sonetime after that date, FOWLER's mother lives in Coving-
ton, Louisiana, and he has a sister who is married to Fort

MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Lawrence J, LABORDE, 201-294688

1. On ll May 1967 the headquarters office of the Domestic
Contacts Service telephoned the C/CI/R&A and said that Subject had
telephoned the New Orleans office of the DCS that day. Subject said that
he was an ex-CIA employee, that he feared that D.A, Jim GARRISON
would subpoena him, that he was willing to leave the U.S, to avoid a
subpoena, and that he wanted the office to tell him what to do.

2. A review of Subject's file has led to the hypothesis that this
visit may have been a provocation, probably engineered by GARRISON
in an attempt to trap CIA into advising Subject to leave Louisiana,

Had such advice been given, GARRISON would have been able to buttress
his charge that CIA is attempting to obstruct the couxse of justice in
New Orleans.

3, - The Miami Station requested a provisional covert security
approval for Subject.on 14 March 1961, The request was granted on
24 March 1961, (A PCSA approves contact for spotting and assessing
only,) However, a 31 March 1961 cable from Miami requested per-
mission to increase Subject's salary to $700 a month and to pay him
bonuses.

4, A Headquarters dispatch of 23 March 1962 warned Miami
that Subject was indiscreet, drank too much, and had an unsavoury
reputation, On 20 April 1962 Miami cancelled the request for an
approval, on the grounds that Subject was a poor security risk,
Subject had no later relationship with the Agency. Subject was bitter
about his CIA contacts when terminated and made reckless threats,

5, An FBI report of 23 May 1962 said Subject had contacted
representatives of the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC, Agency-created
and supported) in New Orleans, his home town; had offered his services;
and had said he was running a boat out of Key West, smuggling Cubans
and guns with the knowledge of CIA,

6, A Miami repost of June 1962 said that Subject was employed
1947-1949 in Mexico by the U.S. Department of Agriculture but was
fired for excessive drinking, discharging unauthorized firearms, and
non~-support of dependent children,

a. The New Orleans States~Item of 28 July 1962 named Subject
as the source of bitterly anti-CIA remarks in a story which praises
LABORDE as a "good family man, completely reliable", and quotes a
Cuban refugee leader as saying that CIA and FBI agents termed Subject
a man of integrity. An anti-CIA article in the Denver Post of 3 June 1962
also appears to be based on statements from LABORDE,

_ 8 FBI reporting of August 1962 stated that LABORDE had duped
certain persons into buying a schooner, the Elsie Reichart, by saying
that he and a crew would operate it for Cuban operations which the
U.S, Government Could not openly acknowledge but for which it would
pay handsomely.

DIRECT © REVOLUCIONARIO ESTUDIANTIL (DRE)
(STUDENT REVOLUTIONARY DIRECTORATE)

1. ‘fhe DRE was conctived, created and gunded by the
Agency in September 1960 and terminated in December 1966,
It was an outgrowth of the activist student group in Cuba
which fought against BATISTA and later against CASTRO,
Many of the leaders came into exile avound September 1960
and were subsequently trained and infiltrated into Cuba
by the Agency in late 1960 where they operated by obtain-
ing intelligence setting up action teams, etc., up through
the Bay of Pigs invasion. , While the DRE was initially set
up as a psych warfare outfit, the organization was given a
large amount of paramilitary aid in-funds and material,
Aftex the Bay of Pigs, the DRE engaged in independent
military actions, which declined at Agency direction and
because of a reduction in funds from late 1962 until ter-
mination of ‘the group. Members were used through 1966 as

‘political action agents, for publishing propaganda which

was sent throughout the Hemisphere, attending international
student meetings at Agency direction, and producing radio
programs and special propaganda campaigns.

2, After the cutback in military operations, many
of the best DRE members relocated in other areas, At
present there arc delegations in most Latin American coun-
tries which have maintained some contact with various
Agency stations over the years although the DRE is no
longer very active. During the organization's 6 year
period of active existence DRE personnel were in contact
with several JMWAVE staffers and outside contract agents.
However, from Jantary 1965 through December 1966, contact
with DRE personnel was limited to two agents, Juan Manuel
SALVAT, the current ‘DRE: Secretary General who is now
operating a bookstore in Miami, Florida, and Fernando
GARCIA Chacon who was relocated in El Salvador.

with dyuerters in New Orleans, that disseminates English
and foreign language propaganda tapes and ‘films on a world
wide basis, conducts public forums of an extr

Dr. Aiton OCHSNER, of the OCHSNER CLINIC, and Willard ¥

shortly after Miss CASTRO's defection and there

major American cities in connection with

YRENYE REVOLUCIONARIO DEMOCRAYICO (RD)
(CUBAN DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTIONARY FRON‘1)

1. The FRD was created with Agency assistance,
guidance and financial support in May 1960 and consisted
of several anti-CASTRO groups. The FRD was formed as a
political action, propaganda and military unit. Initial
actions consisted of extensive rddio and printed propaganda,
demonstrations, and trips throughout the Hemisphere to gain
support for the fight against CASTRO. The FRD also functioned
as the front organization for recruiting the meubers of
the Bay of Pigs invasion force and carried out a massive
program of social assistance to Brigade 2506 members in
training camps and their families. Although the FRD head-
quarters were based in Miami, delegates were assigned to
other areas wiich included New Orleans, Louisiana, Tawipa,
Florida, and Mexico City, to gather intelligence and

2. In late 1960 or carly 1961 the CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY
COUNCIL (CRC) was formed to coordinate and direct FRD
activities and this group was headed by Agency and White
House sponsored Dr. Jose MIRO Cardond, assisted by Manuel
ARTINE and Dr. Antonio VARONA. Both the FRD and the CRC
continued to function until October 1961 when theD was
completely absorbed by the CRC in order to avoid the confusion
resulting from duplication of personnel, activities and
funding. -The CRC also had direct access to President
Kennedy and top Dhite House aides. Because of the magnitude
of the 2D and CRC operations and the Agency participation
in the activities and funding of the groups, a large number
of JMWAVE and Headquarters were directly involved with both
FRD and CRC personnel. ,
