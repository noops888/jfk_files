According to a Bender source (AMCLATTER-I) who talked

operation, i,e., an Autentico Party operation. It was arranged by

Tony through one Ernesto Rojas who contacted White House officials

Hopkins and White. Also involved are Manolo Braña, Juge Antonio

Maestre and an MRR man named Jose Antonio Mendes, (AMCLATTER-1

also mentioned a ({nu) Manolin Hernandez, a wealthy sugar man

connected with the Reforma Central.) AMCLATTER-1 had no

information concerning the size of the group although estimates seem

to run from a few hundred to about a thousand.

3. From Mr. Jacobs we hear that Rojas is an unofficial delegate

of AMBIDDY and lives at 6711 Glencarlyn Drive, Lake Barcroft, Falls

Church, JEfferson 2-5598. A call to this number was answered by

Bill Kent reported from Miami that Rojas is working with

Manuel Brana and in Now York with Jose Antonio Mestro; allas Jose

Agustine Mendes.

Rojas talked to Mr. White and Mr. Hopkins of the

White Houge Stälf In Pennsylvania recently.

5. AMCLATTER-1 algo reported that Tony Varona said he was

dealing with Eduardo Gonzales; & Rescate man in Now York, who was

bringing down 300 people from New York in addition to the unspecified

number of people coming from Miami.

6. AMCLATTER-I commented that when Rasco found out about

the proposed trip he called the MDC ropresentative, name unknown,

in New York and told him to see that the movement was stopped

since

It was not FRD-sponsored. Eduardo Gonzales called Varona to try to

get the MDC representative to lay off, which Tony did, assuring Ràsco

that thia was his own personal operation.

7.. Mr. Stanulie suggested that Mr. Barnes should make it quite

clear in any conversations at the Whito House that we seriously doubt

that at this stage Varona or anyong else can oxort very much control

Ll the delegation comes to Washington. Thie seems obvious since by

now not only does it suem that several groupa in addition to Varona's

were initially involved in the organization of the cavalcado but othere

may well try to gut into the act.

We have been promised through the Bender channel more

precise information on when the cavalcade will arrive but given the

somewhat confused picture one cannot count on receiving advance

word.

Note: See memorandum to A/DDP/A, subject "Jose Manuel Braña

Duran. "
