. 000, 000.

a, To thank President Eisenhower for the
relief fund made available for Cuban refuge:

; b, To thank the Porui ian, Ambasdador for tha break
’ in relations between Peru and Cuba,

c. To try to get an audience with the OAS in order
. to influence other Latin American countries to break
ae relations with Cuba,

2. According to a Bender source (AMCLATTER-1) who talked
with Tony Varona, Varona considers this a completely unilaterat
operation, i;e,, an Autentico Party operation, It was arranged by
Tony through one Ernesto Rojas who contacted White House officials
i Hopkins and White, Also involved are Manolo Brafia, Jose Antonio,
Mgestré and an MRR man-named Jose Antonio Mendes, (AMCLATTER-1
algo mentioned a (fnu) Manolin Hernandez, a wealthy sugar man
‘connected with the Reforma Central.) AMCLATTER-1 had no
information concerning the size of the group although estimates seem
to run from a few hundred to about a thousand,

3. From Mr, Jacobs we hear that Rojas is an unofficial delegate
of AMBIDDY and lives at 6711 Glencarlyn Drive, Lake Barcroft, Falls
Church, JEfferson 2-5598. A call to this number was anawered by
Rojas’ wife who eaid yes, he is connected with the matter of 1,000
signatures for presentation to Eisenhower.

4. Bill Kent reported from Miami that Rojas is working with
Mansel Brana and ‘aie York with Jose. Ani

a Rescate: man:in New York, who
down 300 people from Naw York in addition to the unspecified:
Humber, of people coming {rom Miami, :

6. AMCLATTER-1 commented.that when Rasco found out about
Hed the. MDG representative, name unknown,
to see. that the movement was stoppe’ a
Eduardo Gonaales called Varona to

tthe MDG reprecentative to lay off, which Tony aid, agsuring Rasco
that this was his own personal operation,

7,.. Mr, Stanulie suggested that Mr. Barnes should make it quite
clear in any conversations at the White Houge that wo seriously doubt
that at this stage Varona or anyone else can exert very much control
if the delegation comes to Washington, Thia scems obvious, since by
now not only does it seem that several groups in addition to Varona'é,
were initially involved in the organization of the cavalcade but others

may well try to get into the act.

8, We havé been proriieéd through the-Béndor channel more
preciae information on when the cavalcade will arrive but given the
somewhat confused picture.one cannot count on receiving advance

word,
