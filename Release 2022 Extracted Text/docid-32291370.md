all the bets which he booked. It is noted that CG 6272-C has
advised that it is ALEX's command that all bookmakers operating
in the First Ward must lay off all their bets with BRIATTA.

The conversation overheard by the informant showed very definitely
that TORNABENE was to pay off one per cent of what he obtained
in revenue from juke. boxes to 100 North LaSalle. 100 North
LaSalle is the headquarters of Alderman JOHN D'ARCO, Alderman

of the First Ward. BRIATTA complained that TORNABENE, in the
Santa Fe Hotel was in the First Ward and that contrary to
instructions, “He would hold the cream and give him the rotten
stuff. There were certain parts that he didn't wanna hold, he
turns it over to. us." FERRARO then called TORNABENE two obscene
names and BRIATTA commented as follows: He double crossed me
(obscene). FERRARO asked, "How?", and BRIATTA replied, "Because
GUSSIE (ALEX) told him to go over there and if he says one word,
he says wack him right in the mouth. I went over there and he
didn't yap at all. That's why I went over there and I caught
him. I said what: the (obscene) you guys doing. Where's the
business. So one afternoon MARCI (PAT MARCI, Secretary to
Alderman JOHN D'ARCO) and I as they opened the door we got into
the place. There were two fellows making $50.00 and $100.00 bets
and I says, ‘What the (obscene) are ya doin'.' He says oh I just
started this."|. FERRARO then said, "You want to knock him out of
the box", and BRIATTA replied, "Ya". ' FERRARO then said, "Warn
him that we're gonna take.action if we catch him holding out
anymore,

CG 6343-C* then advised that following this conversation
BRIATTA apparently handed to FERRARO $23,650.00. Of this amount
$13,000.00 was returned to BRIATTA and BRIATTA was instructed to
"Take this to John D'Arco". BRIATTA asked, "Take it to the office
or home?" FERRARO replied, "Wherever he's at. $1,600.00. Oh,
here's the extra." BRIATTA then asked, "Should I give it to
John or Pat? If Johnny is not there give it to Pat and say to
Pat give this to Johnny." FERRARO replied, "Sure". BRIATTA then
said, "Okay, I'll go over there now."

Following this conversation BRIATTA stated, "This
morning, I had a guy from Phelan's Office (Captain. KYRAN PHELAN,
Deputy Chief of the Uniform Police, Chicago Police Department)
over to the house. Eddie. Well I got this guy now from the

It would also appear from the conversation that ~
ALEX and FERRARO have some jurisdiction over TORNBENE and
ARGER. From CG 6232-C it is known that ALEX and FERRARO
have sanctioned TORNBENE's and ARGER's activities in the
loop and without their approval ARGER and TORNBENE could.
not continue to operate as they do. ‘This information has\,
been reported in the past. i

CG 6343-C* reported on January 18, 1960, that on
that date SAM GIANCANA and MURRAY HUMPHREYS, Chicago top
hoodlums, had a conversation. HUMPHREYS made the following
comment:

"You know, the older I get, the better I get.
You guys better not put me on the (obscene)
farm."

GIANCANA laughed at that remark.
HUMPHREYS continued:

"What with GUSSIE saying that they're gonna put
him on the j(obscene) farm, you better keep me
around."

HUMPHREYS reference to GUSSIE is obviously to GUSSIE
ALEX and it would appear that in view of ALEX's deteriorating
health, ALEX is considering retiring from the Chicago crime
syndicate, at least to some extent.

On the same date, HUMPHREYS had a conversation with
FRANK FERRARO concerning MIKE BRORKIN, well known Chicago
criminal lawyer with offices at 188 West Randolph. In this
regard, FERRARO made the following comment:

"That money hungry MIKE. GUSSIE is the guy who
controls him on the price." E

Later on this same date BRODKIN had a conversation
with FERRARO and HUMPHREYS. HUMPHREYS and FERRARO were angry
with BRODKIN in view of the fact that they felt that he was
charging them too much money for a particular situation which

The reférence to STEVE by ALEX midway in the
conversation is probably a reference to STEVE DE KOSTA.
It is noted that DE KOSTA is ostensibly the owner and
manager of the Huckster's Restaurant in Chicago.
According to PCI TURA “SATANA, a burlesque dancer)\ who
is Gntimately friendly with HENRY SUSK and also well
acquainted with GUS ALEX, the Huckster's is operated
by DE KOSTA for SUSK and ALEX, who are the actual owners.
The reference to CLAIR is apparently a reference to the
owner of three Chicago hotels, the St. Clair, the Croydon,
and the Eastgate, all of which are located on the near
' North ‘Side of Chicago. From information furnished by
' CG 6343-C* in the past, it is known that CLAIR is very
closely associated with MURRAY HUMPHREYS and other Chicago
hoodlums,...

On ‘July 12, 1960, CG 6343-C* furnished the
following information regarding a conversation between
JIMMY CELANO, MURRAY HUMPHREYS, and GUS ALEX, in which
they discussed surveillances and investigations conducted
on themselves by various agencies: :

CELANO: "I have guys come in, buy a couple suits.
They. know aboutme. They tap my home
phone. They know my kids go to college.

i They know all about me,

H HUMPHREYS: They investigate. They did the same

i thing to me. They start out since you

i were a kid. All your family. They even

: know whether my wife went to urinate.
Divorce too, Gus and her.

ALEX: So what, I haven't done anything.
HUMPHREYS: In 1958 they started. The comings and

goings. Gussie and Frankie. Ross Prio
(obscene) them. They followed me.

CELANO: They followed me.
HUMPHREYS: Did they?

HUMPHREYS: And you weren't touching LEO's money at

ALEX: No, we.....LEFTY's money, 25% of LEFTY's

HUMPHREYS: Your word is good enough,

ALEX: OK. ccvesccceccceeccescecclEFTY died...ccseee

HUMPHREYS: eeeseeLEFTY didn't have any money and he

The reference made to BRAD EBEN relates to A, BRADLEY
EBEN, an attorney at 134 South La Salle, who represented
Premium Beer Sales, Incorporated, during the fight with
the Fox Head Brewing Company of Waukegan, Wisconsin. EBEN
also represented DOMINIC VOLPE, President of Premium Beer,
at the time VOLPE was contacted andiinterviewed by agents
of this office. It should further be noted that EBEN
authorized the records of Premium Beer Sales, Incorporated,
be made available to the FBI. (-

The reference to "LENNIE" probably pertains to
LENNIE PATRICK, an associate of the Chicago Crime Syndicate
who handles the gambling element in the Rogers Park area
in Chicago. "DAVEY" is probably DAVE YARRAS, a lieutenant
for LENNIE PATRICK, who reportedly spends most of his time
in Miami. .

The reference to "LEO" is believed to be LEO
SCHAFER, a bookie who was arrested in Terre Haute, Indiana,
in connection with the operation of a. multi-million dollar
sport's service, SCHAFER was convicted on a tax charge in
connection with the above in June, 1959, and his case is
on appeal,

\. CG 6272-C has advised that LEO SCHAFER and LEFTY
SCLAR were boyhood friends and were partners in a gambling
operation in the Chicago area. LEFTY died about two years
ago and his wife allegedly died a short time before his
death. It is believed that the reference to LEFTYmde by
ALEX and HUMPHREYS concerns the same individual identified
by CG 6272-C.

doctor" contact was made by SA CARLSON on 9/26/60 with
RAYMOND SCHROEDER, Assistant Security Officer at the Mayo
Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. It is noted that information
has previously been developed that ALEX was a patient at the |
clinic on two occasions during the past year. Mr. SCHROEDER
advised, however, that ALEX was not registered at the clinic.
RUSSELL LANG, Manager of the Kahler Hotel, advised that ALEX
was not registered at the hotel on that date, it being noted
that ALEX stayed at the Kahler Hotel during the occasions of
his visits to the Mayo Clinic.

PCI TURA SATANA advised SA ROEMER on 9/29/60 that she
recently went boating with GUSSIE ALEX, LOUIE ARGER, BUTCH
LADON, JOE PIGNATELLO, and with another girl whom she knew
only as GEORGIA, who appeared to be a good friend of ALEX. It
is noted that ARGER is a subordinate of ALEX who operates
several arcades and amusement rlors in the Southern portion
of the Loop in Chicago. LADON is ALEX‘ chauffeur and body
guard. .PIGNATELLO is a chauffeur, body guard, and cook for
SAM "Mooney" GIANCANA, Chicago top hoodlum. GEORGIA'’s identity
is unknown except that information has been developed in the
past that ALEX has a girl friend named GEORGIA. PCI advised,
that the boat excursion was taken by the group in one of the
boats ‘owned by ARGER which he keeps in Burnham Harbor in
Chicago.

It is noted that PCI SATANA left the Chicago area

shortly after the contact with her on 9/29/60 and at the present

time is touring the burlesque circuit in Las Vegas, Honolulu,
Los Angeles, and other cities in the Western portion of the

United States. For this reason, she has furnished no information

concerning ALEX since that time.

PCI BETTY ANN AMOS advised SASRALPH R. HILL and
ROEMER on 10/25/60 that she has obtained information that GUS
ALEX is the financial interest behind a series of pancake
stores called "Eddie Doucette’s Pancake Plantations." It is
noted that there are four of these restaurants located in
the Chicago area. It is noted that PCI AMOS has been the
cashier at Mike Fish's Restaurant in the Sovereign Hotel at
6200 North Kenmore in Chicago. She advised that many Chicago
hoodlums frequently have met at Fish's Restaurant in a private
dining room located in the rear of the restaurant. She stated
that these hoodlums included ALEX, MURRAY HUMPHREYS, EDDIE
‘VOGEL, and others such as ROCCO DE STAFANO, PAUL DORFMAN,
MANNY SKAR, JOE FUSCO, and PAT MANNO, :

: CG 5973-C advised SA C, LEONARD TREVIRANUS on 4/4/60
that GUS ALEX and SIDNEY KORSHAK are frequently seen together
in public places, He identified KORSHAK as being a millionaire
attorney with homes in Chicago and Los Angeles, California,
and with offices in Chicago and Los Angeles. It is noted that
SIDNEY KORSHAK has been interviewed on three or four occasions
by SA ROEMER and has admitted his association with ALEX.
KORSHAK is presently under investigation as a top hoodlum of
the Los Angeles Office.

CG 5973-C advised SA TREVIRANUS on 10/26/60 that
ALEX and KORSHAK continue to be seen together in publt as of
that time. This informant also advised that ALEX has a
considerable financial interest in an automobile agency or
agencies operated by HENRY SUSK. It is noted that HENRY SUSK
is a prominent Pontiac dealer in Chicago and that he operates
Henry Susk Pontiac, 1510 N. Clark St., and Peter Epsteen
Pontiac in Skokie, Illinois. As noted above, PCI TURA
SATANA has advised that SUSK and ALEX are close associates.

CG 5973-C advised on 11/14/60 that GUS ALEX recently
became quite friendly with a prominent New York model, named
SONNY ANDERSON, It is noted that information has previously
been developed that ALEX spent last winter in the New York -
New Jersey area recuperating from a nervous ailment. This
informant advised that recently ALEX contacted his wife, MARIANNE
ALEX, from New York and has otherwise conducted himself
indicating to MARIANNE ALEX that he and SONNY ANDERSON are
intimate friends. Informant stated that MARIANNE ALEX is
very angry with her husband concerning this situation and that
the situation is aggravated due to the fact that SONNY
ANDERSON has been one of MARIANNE ALEX's closest friends.

It is noted that MARIANNE ALEX is one of Chicago's most
prominent models and that SONNY ANDERSON was a close associate
of hers while in Chicago.

PCI BEN LIEBLING advised SA JOSEPH G. SHEA on
11/16/60 that he had recently learned that LOUIE TORNABENE
is in serious trouble with the hoodlums in Chicago. He advised
that TORNABENE has been running a horse book in the vicinity
of the Santa Fe Hotel, Polk and State Streets, Chicago, for
some time and has withheld approximately $75,000 from the
underworld by not posting all his bets on his books. PCI
stated that he has learned that GUS ALEX, who is in charge
of the district where TORNABENE ran his handbook for the
underworld, will take action in the future after some of this

money has been collected and that the word among hoodlums

is that TORNABENE will eventually be disposed of, It is noted
that information has previously been developed concerning

a similar situation involving TORNABENE through PCI JERRY
LOMBARDI, who advised that TORNABENE was in trouble with

ALEX in the early Winter of 1958-59,

, GEORGE E, Q. JOHNSON, JR., was contacted on 12/15/60.

It is noted that JOHNSON is the husband of CAROLE JOHNSON, the
peeraer of MARIANNE RYAN ALEX, in a dress shop at 110 East

ak Street in Chicago and is also the partner of MARIANNE RYAN
ALEX in another business concern involving modeling. JOHNSON
has been contacted frequently in the past by SA ROEMER
concerning the marital relationship between GUS and MARIANNE
ALEX and concerning his knowledge of the activities and travel
of ALEX. JOHNSON advised SA ROEMER on 12/15/60 that on
12/14/60 MARIANNE ALEX decided to divorce GUS ALEX. He
stated that MARIANNE has been very unhappy with her relationship
with ALEX for the past year or so and that finally on 12/14/60
she made a firm decision to divorce ALEX, JOHNSON stated,
however, that he has advised her not to leave ALEX at the
present time due to the possibility that ALEX could then obtain
the divorce on grounds of desertion and that MARIANNE ALEX

and GUS ALEX will continue to reside at Apartment 1001, Marine
Drive, in Chicago but that they will live in separate rooms

in that apartment.. JOHNSON stated that the reason for MARIANNE's

decision is that she has finally become fed up with ALEX's

‘way of life as a hoodlum and that she can no longer stand her

existence as the wife of a syndicate hoodlum.

JOHNSON advised that he has been acting as MARIANNE
ALEX's attorney in connection with her business affairsbut
that he is not a divorce attorney and does not expect that he
will handle the divorce for MARIANNE; although, he will probably

_ influence her decision as to her choice of an attorney.

JOHNSON stated that he expects that GUS ALEX will choose
EUGENE BERNSTEIN as his attorney in this regard, it being
noted that BERNSTEIN has handled ALEX's tax returns for
many years.

JOHNSON advised that he is agreeable to approaching
MARIANNE ALEX in order to sound her out concerning the
possibility of an interview with SA ROEMER. He stated that he
will talk to MARIANNE and explain to her that it would
appear to him to be the better course of action to explain
her relationship with ALEX and her knowledge of ALEX's
activities rath@r than to have the FBI investigate by talking
to other friends and associates of MARIANNE concerning ALEX.
