• I. Organization of CIA Investigation

of President Kennedy's Assassination

In his Executive Session testimony before the Select

Committee, Richard Helms, the CIA's Deputy Director for

Plans during 1963, described

the CIA's role in the

investigation of President Kennedy's assassination as

follows:

This crime was committed on United

States soil. Therefore, as far as the

Federal government was concerned, the pri-

mary investigating agency would have been

the Federal Bureau of Investigation without

any question. The role of the CIA would

have been entirely supportive in the sense

of what material we are (sic) able to

acquire outside the limits of the United

States with reference to the investigation.

... For investigative purposes, the Agency

had no investigative role inside the United

States at all. So when I used here the

word "supportive," I meant that in the

literal sense of the term. We are (sic)

trying to support the FBI and support the

Warren Commission and be responsive to

their requests, but we were not initiating

any investigations of our own or, to my

recollection, were we ever asked to.

(Executive Session Testimony of Richard

Helms, 8/9/78, pp. 17-18.)

On November 23, 1963 Helms called a meeting of senior-

level CIA officials to outline the Agency's investiga-

tive responsibility vis a vis the assassination. (SSC,

Book V, P. 25.) At that time, Helms placed John Scelso, Headqu

Scelso testified before the Select Committee,

that he was given charge of the Agency's investigation

on the basis of two considerations: l)!his prior

experience in conducting major CIA security investi-

gations and 2) the observance of Oswald by CIA

surveillance in Mexico, (Scelso's operational concern)

less than two months prior to the assassination. (SSC

Book V, p. 25, HSCA Class. Deposition of John Scelso,

during the course of his investigative efforts, Helms

theories nor reach conclusions within a set period of.

CIA's Counterintelligence Staff characterized Scelso's

rather to "coordinate

with the DDP with respect to what was being done over

the whole world..."

Scelso described in detail to the Committee the

manner in which he conducted the Agency's investiga-

We dropped almost everything

else and I put a lot of my officers to work

in tracing names, analyzing files.

We were flooded with cable traffic, with

reports, suggestions, allegations from all

these things had to be

Counsel sheds further light on the difficulties encountered

Cuban involvement in the assassination:

Mr. Goldsmith.

Earlier, when I asked you which

areas of the case received emphasis, I believe that you

indicated that on balance the primary area of emphasis

was the Soviet connection.

Mr. Rocca. That was certainly the one that I would

say dominated -- looking at it from my point of view.

Mr. Goldsmith. Now, had you known about the anti-

Castro assassination plots on the part of the CIA, would

you have given

more priority, more emphasis, to the

possibility of a Castro conspiracy to kill the President?

Mr. Rocca.

Again, I say that it would have

simply intensified it, that there was attention given

to it, not particularly by the staff. I had no capabilities

on the Cuban side.

The organization of their service and their

operation in Mexico was something entirely entirely (sic)

within -- it was an enigma at

the time.

They were just

getting started. This

was WH's area.

This was Win

Scott's area of

proficiency.

So the

defectors had only

-begun. to. come out and they came out later, the Cuban

defectors.

So, I can't -- I really can't say that (a) the

Cuban connection was ignored, because it wasn't.

The

press was filled with it at the time.

The Harker interview should have been undoubtedly

given greater attention in a generalized sense; but it

was given specific attention, I was told at the time of

the Rockefeller thing.

Mr. Goldsmith. In what way was the Cuban connection

investigated?

Mr. Rocca. I don't know. I don't know this.

As noted above, the CI Staff assumed responsibility

in late December 1963 - early January 1964 for the

coordination of CIA efforts to assist the Warren

Commission in its investigation. At that time, Raymond

Rocca, Chief of Research and Analysis for CI Staff,

was designated point of contact with the Warren

Commission. (schlasseted Depesition uf Jemes

Angleton, 10/5/78, p. 77.) Rocca's Research and

A. Opinions of Warren Commission and CIA Representatives

Regarding Warren Commission-CIA Relationship

The Committee has contacted both representatives of

the Warren Commission staff and those representatives of

the CIA who played significant roles in providing CIA-

generated information to the Warren Commission. The

general consensus of these representatives is that the

Warren Commission and the CIA enjoyed a successful

working relationship during the course of the Commission's

investigation. (HSCA Class. Depo. of R. Rocca 7/17/78,

p. 18) (See also Exec. Sess. Test. of Richard Helms,

8/9/78, Rpl,24:) William Coleman, a senior staff counsel

for the Warren Commission who worked closely with Warren

Commission

staff counsel W. David Slawson on matters

which utilized the CIA's resources, characterized

the CIA representatives with whom he dealt as

highly competent, cooperative, and intelligent.

(See HSCA staff interview of William Coleman,

8/2/78.)

(Ibia. p. 24.) MI. Rocca concluded that on this basis:

"The CIA was to turn over and to develop any information

bearing on the assassination that could be of assistance

to the Warren Cormission." (Ibid., p. 26.)

A different view of the CIA's sole regarding the

supply of CIA's information to the Warren Commission was

propounded by Richard Helms. Mr. Helms, who served as

the CIA's Deputy Director for Plans during the Warren

Conmission investigation, was directly responsible for the

CIA's investigation of President Kennedy's assassination andthe

establishmen of ClA policy visa ris the Warren Commission.

(Ibid., p. 23.)

He testified to the Committee that the

CIA made every effort to be as responsive as possible to

Warren Commission requests. (Exec. Sess. Text. of Richard

Helms, 8/9/78, p. 10.) MI. Helms added further testimony

regarding the manner in which the CIA provided its infor-

mation to the Warren Commission. He stated:

An inquiry would come over (from the Warren Com-

mission). We would attempt to respond to it.

But these inquiries came in individual bits and

pieces or as individual items...Each individual

item that came along we took care of as best we

could. (Ibid., pp. 10-11.)

However, it was Mr. Helms' recollection that the CIA

provided information to the warren Commission primarily

oath he supported

this proposition:

Mr. Goldsmith:

In summary, is it your position that

the Agency gave the Warren Commission

information only in response to speci-

fic requests by the Warren Commission?

MI. Helms:

That is correct.

I want to modify that by saying that

memory is fallable.

There may have been

times or circumstances under which some-

thing different might have occured, but

my recollection is that we were attempting

to be responsive and supportive to the

FBI and the Warren Commission. When

they asked for something we gave it to

• them.

As far as our volunteering information

is concerned, I have no recollection of

whether we volunteered it or not.

(Ibid., p. 34.)

Mr. Helms' characterization of fulfilling Warren

Conmission requests on a caserbasis rather than uniformly

volunteering relevant information to the Warren Commission

stands in direct opposition to J. Lee Rankin's perception

of the CIA's investigative responsibility. Mr. Rankin was

asked by Committee Counsel whether he worked under the

impression that the Agency's responsibility was simply to

respond to questions that were addressed to CIA by the

Warren Commission. In response, Mr. Rankin testified as

follows:

Mr. Helms:

Yes, but how do you know they did

How do you

know Mr. Dulles had not told them?

How was I to know that? And bestdes?

I was not the Director of the Agency

and in the CIA, you did not go

to tell the Warren Commission

Agency concern for the Sanctity

of Sensitive Sources and Methods - Factors Affecting

CIA Resporse to Warren Commission Requests

The length of time required by the CIA to

respond to the Warren Commission's requests for

information was dependent upon l) the availability

of information;.. 2) the complexity of the issues

presented by the request and 3) the extent to which

the relevant information touched upon sensitive CIA

sources and methods. On the first two points, Mr.

Helms testified that when CIA had been able to

satisfy a Commission request, the CIA would then send

a reply back:

"and some of these inquiries obviously

took longer than others.

For example, some might involve.

Moreover, there is no indication that Slawson had

concerning the Mexican police report, it would

appear that the Warren Commission, as of March 25,

had been provided little substantive information

pertaining to Silvia Duran. As Slawson reveals,

the commission had been forced to rely upon the two

*Regarding the issue of whether Calderon's comments

could reasonably be interpreted to indicate possible

foreknowledge, the CIA position is as follows:

During the Rockefeller Commission inquiry,

Calderon's conversation was identified

possible item of information from

decisit

space

of a plot to assassinate the American Presi-

dent. This involves a faulty translation of an

answer Calderon gave to her caller.

In answer

to the latter's question as to whether she

had heard the latest news, Calderon said:

"Si, claro, me entere casiantes que Kennedy."

The verb entere is mistranslated. Me entere

(the first person of the verb enterarsede,

past tense)

should be translated as ".f.I

found

out (or I learned) /about it -- the assassination/

almost before Kennedy /did/."

In other words,

calderon was saying she heard about the shooting

of Kennedy almost at the time the event took

place..."

(CIA DoC., Memorandum Regarding

Luisa Calderon conversation, p.l).

The Committee fundamentally disputes the

narrow interpretation of Calderon's comments

assigned by the Agency. It is the Committee's

position that translation of Me Entere as

either "I found out" or "I learned about"

does not foreclose interpretation of Calderon's

comments as a suggestion on her part of possible

foreknowledge of President Kennedy's assassination.

in what form this information was provided,

and which CIA official provided it. (HSCA

request letter of August 28, 1978)

The CIA responded by memorandum:

"Although the (Mexico City) Station considered

the conversation of sufficient possible

interest to send a copy to headquarters,

the latter apparently did nothing with

it, for there appears to

be no record in the

Oswald file of such action as may have

A review of those Warren

Commission documents containing information

provided by the Agency and still bearing a

Secret or Top Secret classification does

not reveal whether the conversation was

given or shown to the Conmission."

(CIA DOC., Memorandum Regarding Luisa

Calderon conversation, p. l)

The available evidence thus supports the

conclusion that the Warren Commission was never

given the information nor the opportunity by

which it could evaluate Luisa Calderon's

significance to the events surrounding President

Kennedy's assassination. Had the Commission been

Two difficult issues remain which are raised

by the Committee's finding. First, why didn't

the Agency provide the Calderon conversation to the

Warren Cornission; secondly, why didn't the Agency

that this information was not provided the Warren

A September 1, 1963 CIA dispatch from the Chief

The Committee has queried David Ronis, the

author of the above cited dispatch requesting

that Calderon's sister be contacted by the CIA's

"domestic exploitation section." (HSCA Class.

Staff Interview of David Ronis, 8/31/78) Ronis

was a member of the CIA's Special Affairs Staff

at the time he wrote the dispatch. He worked

principally at CIA headquarters and was

responsible

for recruitment and handling of agents for collection

of intelligence data.

Mr. Ronis, when interviewed

by this Committee, stated that part of his responsi-

for operational leads related to the work of the

Special Affairs staff. Ronis recalled that he

normally would send requests to CIA field stations

for information or leads on various persons. Often

he would receive no response to these requests,

which normally indicated that no follow-up had

either been attempted or successfully conducted.

It was Ronis' recollaction that the above-cited

within the Special Affairs Staff. He also stated

Ronis told the. Committee that he had no

recollection of recruiting any person associated

with the Cuban Intelligence Service. He did recall

that he had recruited women to perform tasks for

he did not recall ever recruiting

any employees of the Cuban Embassy/Consulate in

Mexico City. Finally, Mr. Ronis stated that he had

no recollection that Luisa Calderon was associated

with the CIA. (Ibid.)

Various present and former CIA representatives

were queried whether Luisa Calderon had ever been

associated with the CIA. The uniform answer was

that no one recalled such an association. (Cites:

*The CIA memorandum states in part as follows:

When CI Staff learned of AMMUG-1's defection

and considered the possibility that he

might have some knowledge of the Oswald

case, CI Staff submitted a list of questions

to WH (Western Hemisphere) for debriefing

AMMUG-1...WH desk records reflect that

AMMUG-1 was debriefed on 4 May 64 regardin

this questionnaire.../B/ecause the debriefing

on the Oswald case

was handled

as a sensitive

matter, it was dictated directly to a CI

(Counterintelligence) stenographer on

5 May 1964.

/Note:

A-1 was debriefed on

several subjects on 4 May 64. The procedure

was to assign each subject discussed a

debriefing number and they were written

up in contact report form by the WH case

officer.

The instructions from CI staff

were to handle the Oswald case debriefing

very closery and not to keep any copies in

The "Oswald Case" was

logged in the WH notebook log as debriefing

report number 40, but the report itself

was dictated by the WH Case Officer directly

to a CI staff stenographer.

There would

be no reason to include the number 40 on

the report of this special debriefing for

CI staff, since it was their only debriefing

report.

We are certain it is the debriefing

report (#40) because the date is the same;

it is the only debriefing report on Oswald

listed in AMMUG-1 records; and it it (sic)

the only AMMUG-1 debriefing report in

Oswald's 201 file.

Agency project referred to as the AMLASH

operation (CIA Inspector General Report 1967

pp. 1-74, 78-112). The AMLASH operation involved

a high level Cuban official (assigned the CIA

cryptonym AMLASH/1) who, during 1962 while meeting

with a CIA representative expressed the desire to

assassinate Fidel Castro (Ibid., p. 84). As a

result of AMLASH's expressed objective and the

CIA's desire to find a viable political alternative

to the Castro regime, the Agency subsequently

provided AMIASH with both moral and material

support designed to depose Fidel Castro. (Ibid.,

pp. 80-94).. The AMLASH operation was terminated

by the CIA in 1965 as the result of security leaks.

(Ibid. pp. 104-106) During 1965, AMLASH and his

conspirators were brought to trial in Cuba for plotting

against Castro. AMLASH was sentenced to death, but

at Castro's request the sentence was reduced to

twenty-five years imprisonment. (Ibid. pp. 107-110).

In its examination of the AMLASH operation

the 1967 IGR concluded that the CIA had offered both

direct and indirect support for AMLASH's plotting (Ibia.

The most striking example of the CIA's direct

offer of support to AMLASH reported by the

1967 IGR states

"it is likely that at the very

moment President Kennedy was shot a CIA officer

was meeting with a Cuban agent in Paris and giving

him an assassination device for use against CASTRO."

of the assassination; unlike the earlier

plots, the AMLASH operation could

clearly be traced to the CIA; and

unlike the earlier plots, the CIA had

endorsed AMLASH's proposal for a coup,

assassination, despite Castro's threat

to retaliate for such plotting. No one

directly involved in either investigation

(i.e. the CIA and the FBI) was told of

the AMLASH operation. No one investi-

operation

and President Kennedy's

assassination. Although Oswald had been

in contact with pro-Castro and anti-

Castro groups for many months before the

assassination, the CIA did not conduct

a thorough investigation of questions

In 1977, the CIA issued a second-Inspector

Langosch, as the Chief of Counterintelligence

Intelligence Services (HSCA Classified Affidavit

characterized by the Special Affairs

senior CIA officers as an assassination

CIA.

(Ibia., p. 4)

Langosch further recollected that as of 1962

*In response to Langosch's sworn statements, this

Committee has received from the CIA an affidavit

executed by Kent L. Pollock (CIA pseudonym) who "served

as Executive Officer for Desmond FitzGerald during the

entire period in which he was Chief of the Special Affairs

Staff...and discussed with him the AMLASH operation as it

progressed." (CIA Doc., Affidavit of Kent I. Pollock,

executed Oct. 5, 1978, p. 1) Mr. Pollock specifically

contested Langosch's assertion that the AMLASH operation

was characterized by the Special Affairs Staff, Desmond

FitzGerald, and other senior level CIA officials as an

assassination operation.

In pertinent part, Pollock

drew the following conclusions:

To the best of my knowledge, Mr. FitzGerald

considered the AMLASH operation

to be a political

action activity with the objective of organizing

a group within Cuba to overthrow Castro and the

Castro regime by means of a coup d'etat.

I heard

Mr. FitzGerald discuss the AMLASH operation

frequently, and never heard him characterize it as

"assassiantion operation."

Mr. FitzGerald

stated within my hearing on several occasions

his awareness that coup d'etat often involves

loss of life. (Ibid., par. 3, p. 2)

He also stated:

Desmond FitzGerald did not characterize the AMLASH

operation as an

"assassigntion operation"; the

case officer did not; I, as Executive Officer,

never

discussed any aspect of the AMLASH operation with

Joseph H. Langosch; the Deputy Chief, the other •

the special assistants could not

have so characterized it since they did not know

about the pen (the pen was specially fitted with a

hypodermic syringe in response to urgings by AMLASH

for a means to start the coup by killing Castro.)

The case officer offered the pen to AMLASH on the day

of President Kennedy's death.

AMLASH rejected the

pen with disdain. /Ibid., par. 1, p. 3/), (Ibid.,

I think there would have been a

much better chance of getting to

the heart of it.

It might have

in it and who approved it and all

that.

But I think that would

have at least come out.

(HSCA Class.

Depo. of J. Lee Rankin, 8/17/78, p.91)

The Committee

is in agreement with Mr. Rankin

that had the AMLASH operation been disclosed to

the Warren Commission, the Commission might have

been able to foreclose the speculation and conjecture

that has surrounded the AMLASH operation during

the past decade. As history now records, the AMLASH

operation remains a footnote to the turbulent

relations between Castro's Cuba and the United States.
