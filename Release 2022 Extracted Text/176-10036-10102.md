WAS THAT SOME ACCORD WAS REACHED BY THE TWO LEADERS, AS CHEN WAS IN
EXCELLENT SPIRITS AT THE CONCLUSION OF HIS VISIT.

4. -ALTHOUGH SOMEWHAT SLOW IN GETTING STARTED, THE VISIT DID
RESULT IN BRINGING THE TWO GOVERNMENTS CLOSER TOGETHER, PARTICULARLY

THE COUNTERPARTS OF THE TWO COUNTRIES, THE VISIT ALSO SERVED A
USEFUL PURPOSE IN EFFECTIVELY IMPRESSING THE LOCAL CHINESE POPULATION,
WHICH TURNED OUT MORE OR LESS SPONTANEOUSLY IN AN ESTIMATED ONEi HUNDRED
THOUSAND ALONG THE ROUTE 10/aiRPORT TO CHEER CHEN WHEN HE
DEPARTED. THE APPARENTLY GENUINE ENTHUSIASM OF THE USUALLY APATHETIC
VIETNAMESE CHINESE CAME AS A SURPRISE EVEN TO THE LOCAL CHINAT
