PEIPING. CONCENSUS AMONG THE CHINAT COMMUNITY AND CHEN'S DELEGATION

WAS THAT SOME ACCORD WAS REACHED BY THE TWO LEADERS, AS CHEN WAS IN

EXCELLENT SPIRITS AT THE CONCLUSION OF HIS VISIT.

4. -ALTHOUGH SOMEWHAT SLOW IN GETTING STARTED, THE VISIT DID

RESULT IN BRINGING THE TWO GOVERNMENTS CLOSER TOGETHER, PARTICULARLY

THE COUNTERPARTS OF THE TWO COUNTRIES. THE VISIT ALSO SERVED A

USEFUL PURPOSE IN EFFECTIVELY IMPRESSING THE LOCAL CHINESE POPULATION,

WHICH TURNED OUT MORE OR LESS SPONTANEOUSLY IN AN ESTIMATED ONE: HUNDRED

THE

THOUSAND ALONG THE

ROUTE TO/AIRPORT TO CHEER CHEN WHEN HE.

DEPARTED. THE APPARENTLY GENUINE ENTHUSIASM OF THE USUALLY APATHETIC

VIETNAMESE CHINESE CAME AS A SURPRISE EVEN TO THE LOCAL CHINAT

DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY.
