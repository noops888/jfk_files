UNNECESSARILY, BY OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION OF CIA USE

ONLY DURING THE PAST FEW YEARS THAT A NEW PRESIDENT AND HIS BOLD

FREE-MARKET REFORMS HAVE PUSHED

SQUARELY INTO THE

CURIOUSLY, THE CLOSE POLITICAL RELATIONS AND OUR

STEADILY- IMPROVING RELATIONS WITH

MEANS THAT BOTH PARTIES

-EMBASSY DIPLOMATS AND SENIOR

OFFICERS - - WONDER WHY WE NEFD

IF WE CAN GET VIRTUALLY ANYTHING WE ASK FOR FROM

OR FROM

OFFICIALS.

INDEED,

IN THIS RELATIVELY

OPEN, COMFORTABLE ENVIRONMENT, AN INDICATION THAT

WAS WORKING

ON INCOMPATIBLE

TARGETS WOULD BE ESPECIALLY DAMAGING.

AT THE RISK OF BORING THE READER WITH DETAIL, EMBASSY

IS SO OPEN A WORKPLACE THAT THERE IS NO REAL CLEARED ACCESS

AREA (CAA), BUT RATHER A "HYBRID" CAA,

TO USE THE RSO'S PHRASE.

THIS

MEANS THAT ESN'S HAVE LONG HAD OFFICES ON THE THIRD FLOOR, WHERE THE

LOCATED. NEEDLESS TO SAY,

IS NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE

CONFIGURATION OF OFFICES,

IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, WHERE EMBASSY OFFICERS DO NOT HAVE

FULL APPRECIATION OF THE ROLE/NEED

IN SUCH AN OPEN,

FRIENDLY SOCIETY, OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION OF CIA'S USE

WOULD ONLY REAFFIRM THEIR POINT OF VIEW. OUR FEW

WOULD ESSENTIALLY THEN BE DECLARED.

REDUCING THE NUMBER

AS HEADQUARTERS IS AWARE,

UNDER CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES THERE ARE FEW

_AND THE SELECTION AND

TRAINING OF NEW ONES TAKES YEARS AND IS EXPENSIVE. IN THIS SCENARIO,

WOULD NEVER RECEIVE ENOUGH PRIORITY TO WARRANT SENDING

THREE

TO REPLACE THE THREE

_SLOTS WE CURRENTLY

THE END RESULT WOULD BE THAT WE WOULD COLLECT VERY LITTLE

ON MAJOR PORTIONS OF OUR OPERATING DIRECTIVE (OD).

SPECIFICALLY, INTERNAL POLITICAL REPORTING, WHICH IS A FIRST PRIORITY

OBJECTIVE, WOULD BE ZEROED OUT, AND REPORTING ON THE

TARGETS, BOTH SECOND PRIORITY OBJECTIVES, WOULD BE NON-EXISTENT.

THIS WOULD BE A SERIOUS LOSS TO THE USG,

_REPORTING HAS

HISTORICALLY BEEN THE ONLY MEANS OF LEARNING TO WHAT EXTENT THE

ARE RESPECTING INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS AND NOT REBUILDING

THEIR MISSILE PROGRAM. ON THE

TARGET, WE WOULD LOSE SIGNIFICANT

REPORTING ON REGIONAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND THE IMPACT OF THE ASIAN

FINANCIAL CRISIS IN THE AMERICAS. PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY, HOWEVER,

WE WOULD LOSE THE TRUST OF

_ GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND OF SOME

OFFICIALS,

WITH THE PREDICTABLE RESULT THAT IT WOULD

TAKE YEARS TO REBUILD THE RELATIONSHIP.
