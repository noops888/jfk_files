Re Philadelphia airtel 10/24/58.

SID /ISR

on 10/30/58, PCI MORRIS KOVLER

in the week he had had dinner with CHARLES SCHWARTZ while

JFK)

he was in Philadelphia®

KOVLER does not Know MORISI, who

accompanied SCHWARIz from Cuba.

KOVLER said SCHWARTZ has a home in Philadelphia,

but does not get along with his wife and is seldom there.

He has a girl friend, name unknown to KOVLER.

Lears ago

SCHWARIZ was & bookmaker and ran dice games in Philadelphia.

Then he went to Atlantio City, N.J., and operated the Bath

and lurf club there.

That club haa roulette wheels, aice

games, eto., and since, according to KOVLER, HERMAN

" STUMP Y"

ORMAN

controls all the

gambling in Atlantio City, it was

Likely that ORMAN either wholly or partly owned the Bath and

Turf Club.

At present SCHWARTZ is working at the Hotel

Nacionale in Hawanag, where he could be a front man or an

employee.

KOVLER belleves 1t is also possible that ORMAN owns

a piece of the Nacionale, and that SCHWARTZ is watching it

for him.

KOVIER said he, himself, was offered a job at the

Nacionale, but turned it down because it is too confining and

the employees are too strictly controlled, not being allowed

to go anywhwee.

He said shares in the Cuban gambling establish

ments are sold by the "point,

the return being in proportion to the number of

" each polat being pointed and

owned.
