Re: Proposal for a Multi-Agency Declassification Review of Joseph Califano’s Army
Papers under the JFK Act

Gentlemen:

The Assassination Records Review Board would like to make arrangements with you to

ify six boxes of Army records from the files of Joseph Califano. The files date.
principally from the period 1962-63, during which Mr. Califano served as Army General
Counsel and as Special Assistant to the Secretary of the Army. The records had been
deposited at the National Archives and Records Administration, where they were
recently located. A description of the records, which primarily periain to US. activities
related to Cuba, is attached hereto. We have identified what appears to us to be
equities of numerous military entities in the Califano papers as well as equities of the
Central Intelligence Agency, the State Department, the United States Information
Agency, and others.

Deadlines

‘Due to the volume of the records, and the Review Board’s current sunset date of
September 30, 1997, it is important that we proceed expeditiously in our review of the
records. We have slated the Califano papers for review by the Board at its August 5-6, 1997
meeting. The Review Board staff is prepared to assist you in making arrangements for a
prompt and efficient review of the Califano papers.

Preliminary Review of Califano Papers

‘The Review Board staff has conducted an initial review of the records and has
tentatively reached the following conclusions: first, the records are very similar in
subject manner to many other records that already are a part of the JFK Collection;
Perepplnprntnceinesbtaerag sept wearmniiartnanarrd remain classified, there is
little remaining : ‘due to the passage of time and to the release of much of the
information in other contexts; and third, the Califano papers contain equities of
numerous military and non-military agencies, which, under the standard referral
process, would be very difficult and time-consuming? Thus, the logistical problem in
‘the records is not the continued sensitivity of the records, but the number
of agencies that will need to review their own equities in the records. For this reason,
and for the short time-line on which we are now operating, we believe that there is an
urgent need to make acceptable arrangements for the review and referral of records.

Proposal

In order to expedite the process and make it more efficient, we would like to propose an
alternate arrangement for declassification of records that we previously have found
effective. We suggest the holding of a multi-agency concurrent review of the Califano
papers. We would like to schedule a single session at our offices, on or before July 23,
1997, where all agencies with equities in the Califano papers be concurrently present for
a declassification review. At such a session, agencies would be able to review their own
equities in the records, declassify them, and simply hand them across the table to ottier
agencies for their review. Ithas béen our own experience that sessions of this sort
greatly simply the review process by giving agencies the opportunity to speak with
each other and quickly to resolve questions.

Because the Califano papers will need to be reviewed by the Board at its August 5-6
meeting, we believe that an arrangement such as is proposed above will provide all
agencies with a full opportunity to identify their equities in the records and to make
determinations regarding the need for continued classification. If the Army and the

?Ms. Toni Bowie, of the Army Declassification Activity, spent three days
reviewing some of the records and making recommendations for referrals to other
agencies both within and outside of the military. Although Ms. Bowie worked.
energetically for three days, it was our sense afterwards that, if we continue at the same
‘pace, the agencies with equities will likely not be able to complete their reviews before
the August deadline arrives.

The Assassination Records Review Board would like to make arrangements with you to
declassify approximately 147 records previously flagged by the Joint Staff from both the
JCS Central Files, tnd the paper of JCS [CS Chairmen Lemnitzer, Taylor and Wheeler. The
Ses date principally from the period 1961-64. ‘The records were flagged during
searches directed by Mr. Edmund McBride (Chief, Information Management Division,

all records flagged by Mr. McBride's working group are relevant to the historical
understanding or context of the assassination of President Kennedy. A description of
the records, which primarily pertain to U.S. activities related to Cuba, or to Vietnam

The Review Board staff has conducted an initial review of the records and has
tentatively reached the following conclusions: first, the records are very similar in

statement that the Joint Staff was standing by to expeditiously process these records for
declassification in collaboration with other agencies when the ARRB was ready. ARRB
staff has only recently completed its initial review of these records, which constitute

‘The Assassination Records Review Board, an independent federal agency overseeing
the identification, review, and release of records related to the assassination of President
John F. Kennedy, today released approximately 1,500 pages of previously classified
military records from 1962-64 that relate to U'S. policy toward Cuba.

“These documents further expand the historical record by illustrating the United States
government's deep interest in developing a policy that would force Castro from power
during the early 1960's,” said Dr. Anna Nelson, a member of the Review Board. “We
now have a new window into the policy options toward Cuba that were being
considered and debated at the highest levels of the military services.”

The mandate of the Review Board is to make the record surrounding the assassination
of President Kennedy as complete as possible. The Board has aggressively sought to
uncover records on U.S. foreign policy that put the assassination into its historical
context.

The Review Board worked cooperatively with representatives from the Department of
Défense (DOD) and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) to
locate records stored at NARA that met the definition of being “assassination related.”
The documents are from the served as General Counsel to
the Secretary of the Army, the files Chairmen Lemnitzer, Taylor
and Wheeler, and the central files of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

The records have been transferred to NARA for inclusion in the JFK Collection, which is
housed at the NARA facility in College Park, Maryland. These documents are now
available to researchers.

Copies of selected documents are available from the Assassination Records Review

commercial communications facilities in Cuba, 7

bs Concept: This to be accomplished by the clandestine introduction of
® “special” vacuum tube into selected communications equipment. ‘The tube,
which is available, is virtually undetectable inasmuch as ite effectiveness is
j due to the insertion of a chemical compound in the base af the tube. The
chemical, when heated becomes a conductor, when cool a non-conductor,

a. Objective: The objective is to create unrest and dissension amongst
the Cuban people.

b. Concept: This to be accomplished by airdropping valid Pan American
ox KLM cne-way airline tickets good for passage to Mexico Gity, Caracas,
etc. (none to the U.S.). Tickets could be intermixed ‘with other leaflets
planned to be dropped. The number of tickets dropped could be increased,
The validity of the tickets would have to be restricted to a time period,

3. Operation TURN ABOUT:

a. Objective: The objective is to create indications to Fidel Castro that
his value to the revolutionary cause has diminished to the point where plans are *.
being made for his "removal", :

b. Concept: This to be accomplished by the use of intelligence means the

Objective: To induce elements or individuals of the Cuban military to
defect with equipment.

b, Concept: This activity when properly planned and implemented has the
effect of decreasing military capability. In a totalitarian system the immediate
reaction is increased security accompanied by decreased activity, It also
creates havoc in security and: intelligence agencies, Could be accomplished
by intelligence means and promise of rewards.

5. Operation BREAK-UP: i

Objective: To clandestinely introduce corrosive materials to cause
atreraft, vehicle or boat accidents. .

b. Concept: This activity, if possiblé-shotld-be aimed primarily toward the
Soviet-provided aircraft. If properly accomplished it would degrade confidence
in the equipment, increase supply and maintenance problems and seriously

affect combat capability,
6. Operation COVER-UP:

a. Objective: The objective is to convince the Communist government of
Cuba that Naval Forces ostensibly assigned to the MERCURY project is merely
a cover.

b. Concept: It should not be revealed as to what the cover is--this shor
be left to conjecture. This could tie in with Operation DIRTY TRICK.

a. Objective: The objective is to provide irrevocable proof that, should:

b. Concept: This to.be accomplished by manufacturing various pieces of
evidence which would prove electronic interference on the part of the. Cubans.

grows until it consumes all the space inside the tank.

9. Operation PHANTOM:

a. Objective: The objective is to convince the Castro Government that
clandestine penetration and resupply of agents is being regularly conducted.

b. Concept: This to be accomplished by use of BJ, UDT, AND JJ capa-
bilities to create the impression that landings have been made on beaches
and air drops have been made in other areas.

10. Operation BINGO:

a. Objective: The objective is.to.creato,an incident which has the appea
of an attack on U.S. facilities (GMO) in Cuba, thus providing the excuse for
use of U.S, military might to overthrow the current government of Cuba.

b. Concept: This to be accomplished by the use of SNAKES outside the
confines of the Guantanamo Base. .SNAKES simulate‘an actual fire-fight and
‘upon hearing such a sound it is-entirely feasible that the immediate reaction
on G'Mo would be that the base is being attacked. This would, with proper
preparation, be followed by a counterattack and with adequate planning the base
at G'Mo could disgorge military force in sufficient number to sustain itself
until other forces, which had been previously alerted, could attack in other
areas. It is envisaged that a schedule of operations similar to the following
would overwhelm the Cuban military and cause its defeat:

(1) Simulated attack on Guantanamo.
(2) Word flashed to the President.
(3) President orders counterattack to include: a
(a) Immediate launch of alerted aircraft whose targets 3 are Cuban airfields.
(b) Immediate launch of counterattack down strategic lines in communi-
cation in Cuba.
(c) Fleet force standing by on alert would make way toward pre-selected
targets /landing areas.
(d) Immediate embarkation of airborne troops previously alerted to
pre-selected targets.
(e) Launch of additional combat aircraft to clear drop areas and
further interdict lines of communication.
(£) Ships and aircraft would land/airdrop troops and secure airfields,
road/rail terminals, etc.

Properly executed, the above could overthrow the Cuban Government in a
matter of hours, providing the plan is implemented within the next six months.

1l. Operation GOOD TIMES:

a. Objective: To disillusion the Cuban population with Castro image by
distribution of fake photographic material.

b. Concept: Prepare a desired photograph, such as an obese Castro
with two beauties in any situation desired, ostensibly within a room inthe -
Castro residence, lavishly furnished, and a table briming over with the most
delectable Cuban food with an underlying caption (appropriately Cuban) such as __
''My ration is different." Make as many prints as desired on sterile paper and |
then distribute over the countrygide by air drops or agents. Thig should put
even a Commie Dictator in the proper perspettive with "thé underprivileged *
masses.

12. Operation HEAT IS ON:

. @ Objective: To create the impression with Castro Government that
certain dyed-in-the-wool Red pilots are planning to defect, thus causing a
detrimental tightening of security.

b. Concept: It ie known that many Cuban refugee pilots are personally
acquainted with many of the present CRAF pilots. Accordingly, by utilizing
all sources available, determine by name those pilots considered to be dedicated
Castro Reds. Then by use of agents, communications, etc. inject into the
Castro intelligence system the fact that these pre-designated Reds are planning
to defect for monetary and/or ideological reasons. Security crackdown should
help destroy Castro image and also impose unacceptable restrictions on
routine training activities. a

OPERATION: Invisible Bomb

OBJECTIVI

1. To create the impression that isolated bombings are taking place
in Cuba thus maximizing harrassment and confusion of the Castro govern-
ment.

carats

CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS:

4 2. The Air Force can utilize the operational characteristics of F~101

7 or other Century series aircraft to create the impression that anti-Castro

2 opposition is ‘continuing. The aircraft operational characteristic to be
exploited is the "sonic-boom."

i : 3." The "sonic-boom" can.ke.émployed in several different ways such

: as an individual boom at selected spote or a continuous boom and performed
at either high or low altitudes. It will cause not only apprehension but
varying degrees of malicious damage as well, i.e. break all the windows
on a street in Havana. EE

4, The "sonic-hoom"' effect can be maximized by planning missions
for execution during the early morning hours when the populace is sleeping.
‘The Cuban people are generally unfamiliar with this phenomenon, therefore
it is felt that the impact for a time would be most beneficial.

5. The directional aspects of the "'sonic-boom" also make it feasible
for use in simulating U.S, Naval gun-fire in the immediate vicinity of the
Cuban land mass.

6. This operation is considered relatively safe and leaves no tangible
evidence, It can be planned and executed with a minimum of effort and
expense.

Special Hendling of this payor is requested.

(Florida, Inagwa, Jamaica, aboard Naval ship) which have the capability of
overriding commercial Cuban radio and TV stations, periodically degrade
Castro and other government figures in the minds of the Cuban people.

3. The technique of communications. intrusion could be exploited by pre-
taping or live broadcasts of anti-communist and anti-Castro propaganda at

Cuban refugee to make such broadcasts and naturally would require close
monitoring of stations to be worked. Any number of thoughts could be
injected such as

a. "Cuba Si, Russia No." |

c. Communism is ruthless totalitarianism.

Opération "NO LOVE LOST"

1. Objective: To confuse and harrass Castro Cuban Pilots by use of
radio conversations.

2. Concept of Operations: Fly Cuban refugee pilot in sterile aircraft

in proximity of Cuba at periodic intervals while communication monitoring

Cuban air/ground frequencies utilized for airdrome control, Cuban refugee

pilot in sterile aircraft would personally know many of the pilots still flying
- for Castro. Refugee pilot would get into argument with Castro pilots over

radio thus distracting confusing, etc. Would be real trouble for Castro

pilots in actual weather conditions. Argument could go, "I'll get you you

Red son-of-a-gun, "-and call by name if appropriate.

I. Operation SMASHER,

1. Objective: Disrupt or disable military and commercial communications
facilities in Cuba.

2. Technical Requirements:

. a. Detailed information on both commercial and military communi-
cations facilities and capabilities, to include inside and outside plant
construction, system networks, equipment details (i.e. circuitry, tubes, etc.)
location and type of repeator stations. This information is required to
construct a refined device. ;

‘’b. A vacuum tube modified in such a manner as to cause a short
circuit. This is.possible by inducing silicon carbide (7?) into the base of the
tube. When the tube becomes hot the silicon carbide liquifies and becomes.

@ conductor; whem the tube codls the matter returns to a solid non-conductive
state. Such a device (vacuum tube) is available.

3. Targets:

a. Cuban Telephone Company. The company provides local and long
distance telephone service throughout Cuba and also international telephone
service.

b. Radio Corporation of Cuba Avenida Carlos. The company provides
radiotelephone service to American and European countries. It also provides
Fadiotelegraph service and includes leased teleprinter channels. In conjunc-
tion with AT&T the company inaugurated over-the-horizon microwave radio
service between Cuba and Florida in 1957. This latter mada available two-way
TV channels.

¢. Cuban American Telephone and Telegraph Company. Founded by
IT&T and AT&T, providing six (6) submarine cables linking Havana and Key
West. Facility operates in conjunction with microwave link.

d. Commercial Radio and Television Stations.

©. Military Radio and Land-line Facilities. These include point-to-
point command and administrative systems, air/ground facilities, navigational
aids. Obviously certain commercial facilities provide service to the military
therefore disrupting or disabling commercial facilities will affect military
communications capabilities. Special Handling of this pnzer is requested.

Joint Chiefs of Staff are to indicate brief but precise
description of pretextywhich they consider would provide:
Justifiestion for U8 military intervention in Cuba.
FAORS BRARING ON ‘THE PROBLEM
2, It 1s recognized that any action which becomes pretext
for U8 military intervention in Cuba will lead to a political
decision which then would lead to military action.
3. Cogninande has been taken of a suggested course of
aotivn proposed™* by the US Navy relating to generated
instances in the Guantanamo area.
4. For additional facts see Enclosure B.
DISCUSSION
.5. The suggested coursesof action appended to Bnolosure A
are based on the premise that ‘US militery intervention will
result from 8 period of heightened US-Cuben tensions which
place the United States in the position of suffering’ justif-
table grievences. World opinion, and the United Nations
forum should be favorably,affected by developing the inter-
national image of the Guban goverment es fash and irresponsible,
and as en alarming and unpredictable threst to the peace of
‘the Western Hemisphere, —

present time it will contimas to hold good only as long as
there oan be reasonable certainty that US military intervention

The terror campaign could be po \
haven 4n the United states. We could sink a boatload of Cubsne
enroute to Florida.(real or simulated). We could foster attempts
on lives of Cuban refugees in the United States even to the
extent of wounding in instances to be widely publicized.
Exploding a few plastic bombs in carefully chosen spots, the
ervest of Cuban agents and the release of prepared documents
substantiating Quban involvement also would be helpful in
projecting the idea of an irresponsible government.

5. A “Quban-based, Castro-supported" f1libuster could be
aimilated against a neighboring Caribbean nation (in the vein
of the With of June invasion of the Dominican Republic). We
Imow that Castro 1g becking subversive efforts clandestinely*
against Haiti, Dooinican Republic, Guatemala, and Nicaragua at
present and possible others. These efforts oan be magnified and
additional ones contrived for exposure. For example,” advantage
can be taken of the sensitivity of the Dominican Atr Feree to
intrusions within theds national atr space. "Cuban" B-26 or
0-46 type atroraft could make cane-burning raida at. night,
Soviet Bloo incendiaries could be found. This obit be coupled
with "Cuban" messages to the Commmist underground in the
Dominican Republic and "Cuben" shipments of arms which would
be found, or intercepted, on the beash.’””

6, Use ‘of MIG type atroraft by US pilots could provide
additionel” provocation. Haresément of oivil air, attacks on”
surface shipping and destruction of US military drone sirereft
by MIG type planes would be useful as complementary actions.

An F-86 properly painted would convince air passengers that they
sew a Cuban MIG, especially 1f the pilot of the transport were
to announce such fact. ‘he primary drawback to this suggestion
eppears to be the security risk inherent in obtaining or modify-

PACTS BRARING ON THE PROBLEM

1, The Joint Chiefs of staff have previously stated"
that US unilateral military intervention in Cuba can be
undertaken in the event that the Cuban regime commits hostile
acts, against US forces or property which would serve as an
Aneident upon’ which to base overt antarvention. :

2. The need for positive action in the event that current
covert efforts to foster an internal Ouban rebellion are
unsuccessful was indicated" by the Joint chiefs of staff
on 7 March 1962, as follows:
* - ~ - determination that a credible internal

revolt 19 impossible of attainment during the next

9-10 months will require a decision by the United states

to develop a Cuban “provocation” as justification for

" positive US military action." :

3. It 4s understood that the Department of State also is
preparing suggested courses of action to develop justification
for U8 military intervention in Cuba.

DISCUSSION

INTRODUCTION
1, Rurnose. This report 1s in response to a request from
the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of staff, to consider the desira-
bility and requirements of a fomented révolt in Cubs. te
Ancludes an examination of engineering an incident or a series
of incidents as.a cause for invasion and consideration of
. pertinent comments received from CINCLANT.

2. Sumary. Study of the desirability and the requirements
of a fomented revolt in Cuba and of the advantages of
enginepring an incident or a series of incidents rather than
trying to generate and coordinate action from inside Anvolving
many Cubans of doubtful reliability leads to the conclusions
that:

a. It is unlikely that an effective spontaneous revolt

will occur in the near future,

Db. Any uprising without US overt. support is likely to
be short-lived because of the improved Cuban/Soviet -
military capabilities presently in Cuba pnd Castro's
comand efficient internal security’ operations.

+ There appears to be little 11kelihood that the Castro

Communist regime will risk a direct provocation that
could be used as a pretext for US interverition.

4. Unless the United stat

intervenes ‘militarily, the
Castro government will become more firmly entrenched and its

efforts and ability to spread international commnisa wilL
increase.

@+ The United States, should intervene militarily in
Cuba and could (a) engineer Provocative incidents ostensibly

perpetrated by the Castro regime to serve as the cause of
fnvasion or (b) foment a revolt within Cuba which would
call for US military intervention.

*. Bngineered provocation would provide greatelr advantages
in control, timing, simplicity, and security than would a
fomented revolt. It would be most difficiit to generate a
wddespread effective revolt. However, thé staging of a 100d)
uprising as a contrived incident ‘should not be precluded.

. The United states should:

(2) Intttate a coordinated program to créate a pre-
text for US military intervention in cuba.

(2) Im aupport of the above, undertake a flexibly
phased effort to build Cuban resistance potential, com
mencing with the;tntensification of intelligence collec-
tion and sabotage in cuba, and the creatiori of a rrame-
Work for guerrilla activity,

(3) At @ propitious time, launch appropriate military
action to remove the Castro communigt- government.

h. Implementation of the above would involve many
Agencies of the United States Government. It would appear
necessary that one governmental organization should. be
Given the primary responsibility for developing such a
national plan. The Joint chiefs of staff should participate
4 the development of this national plan.

4. The broad concepts herein and the views of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff should be forwarded to the Special Group
(5412 Committee) for consideration under the Provisions of
NAM 57. .

J. CINCLANT's concept for fomenting a revolt in Cuba
While containing much merit, should be rerexamined both
for its timing and for the large-scale guerrilla activity

. Conduct physical and psychological military harassment
of the Cuban regime and covert and clandestine operations as
directed.

c, Undertake military action in Cuba in accordance with
contingency plans approved by the Joint chiefs of Staff and
directed by the President. ‘The primary purpose of the US
military intervention would be to assure the overthrow of

the Castro communist government and to
’ ment of a new, non-communist government acceptable to the
United States,

20, The implementation of any of the suggested courses of
action. in this study would involve many agencies of the United
States Government. It would appear necessary, therefore, that
one single governmental. organization be given the primary
responsibility for developing a national plan.

21,, Because of the extensive military operations involved,
the Joint Chiefs of Staff should participate in the development
of this national plan. In addition, for a contrived revolt,
they should be assigned the specific responsibility for develop-
ing the-military and paramilitary aspects of the plan. This
would require the Joint Chiefs of Staff to seek a determination
under NSAM 57 when a revolt contrived by-the United States were

an operation large enough to warrant control of covert forces
by the Department of Defense and that CINCLANT be designated as
the DOD agent. In this connection, CINCLANT has developed a
Bpecific concept for political and military action in Cuba.
CINCLANT CONCEPT

22, The .CINCLANT concept provides for inciting a revolt in
Cuba, followed by overt, large-scale US military operations.
The proposed ‘timing of operations permits completion in 15-18
months. Supporting operations by CIA, State, and USIA will
be required.

feeesreey~ RRL



13-00000

23. Preliminary operations require the introduction by CIA
as soon as practicable of assets into Cuba for thé developnent
of intelligence,’ the organtzation by State of a Free Cuban
Government (FCG), the development of a propagenda plan by USIA, and q
the devdlopment of a suitable cover plan. :

2%. Actual operations would commence with the execution by
CINCLANT of OPLAN 380-63 about 15 Jamary 1964. This plan calls
for infiltrating of UW forces into Cuba for area assessment,
establishing guerrilla bases, developing military units,
establishing escapb and evasion nets and conducting subversion.

On about 15 June 1964, UW forces would be augmented and would

accelerate. subversive operations to create conditions favorable
for establishing a Free Cuban Governnent on Cuban soil and for
employment of conventional forces. :

25. CINCLANT then proposed that on about 15 July mobilization
of forces for US conventional operations would begin. Execution of
CINCLANT. OPLAN 312 would conmence on 26 July 1964 followed by

D-Day OPLAN’316, about 3 Auguot 1964,-
26. Although the foregoing schedule is approximate, it should

be noted that the Free Cuban Government would be required to
exist at least for 18 days in the face of the Castro governnent's
excellent counterguerrilla ability. This time requirement appears
to be excessive, but it could be shortened. The criteria for
United States recognition of a new government could be met in
this period. The Free Cuban Government could cleim it:

@. ‘Was in actual po!

‘b. Mas administering it with general acceptance by the
Population; and,

¢. Was prepared to honor international obligations:

. The UW forces required for CINCLANT OPLAN 380-63 are
approximately:
(2) Headquarters, Joint - 6 ore W2 EM

assets as required by
+ CTNCLANT.

28. CINCLANT does not have UW forces assigned at this tine,
however, @ nucleus JUWIFA staff is included vithin the CINCLANT
staff and has the capability for preparing UW plans for normal
contingencies. Planning or conducting UW operations of the
magnitude envisaged in CINCLANT's concept in’ this plan is beyond
current capabilities. é

29. At an appropriate time in preliminary operations the

+ activation of the JUWIFA as a separate organization and the
assignment to it of full vartime headquarters complement of
48 officers, 56 enlisted men, and five civilians vould be
required. Approval of any concept in principle or for

activation of a separate headquarters. In this oase,
would re-evaluate his staff capabilities and submit ae,
recommendations to the Joint Chiefs of starr. :

30. CINCLANT in a related outline concept’ recomended, con-
cerning the use of Cuban nationals in UW operations, that "As

practical, the Military Services should initially form their
Cuban natdorials into integral, all Cuban units ...". Tt 40
considered that the creation of a "Cuban Eipeditionary Forde" ‘in

8 risk which cannot be justified and should not be undertaken.
‘There appears to be no reason, however, why Cubane could not be
formed into small teema for use in W activities, It io estimated
‘that from two to four hundred carefully selected Cubans could be
Used in this role. It would be appropriate for the CTA in a
supporting role to select and train‘the individuals forming then
into teams of ‘appropriate size to be made available for joint use

‘py GINCLANT or by CIA, as necessary.

31. Por other details of training cuban nationals, see
‘JOSH-360-63.

32. The force levels in CINCLANT OPLANS 312 and 316 are adequate
to cope with the improved Cuben military capability and the
Presence of Soviet troops on the island.

33. The experience of the JUWTFA during the Cuban crisis in
October 1962, indicates that the present military supply system
in the CONS W111 be unable: immediately to provide equipment and
supplies in’ the required configuration for projected UW operations
in Guba. ‘he Aruy 4s currently studying prestockage of UW equip-
ment and will submit proposals for approval and financing.

34. The conceptual outline submitted by CINCLANT floes not
provide an exact plan in détatl for contriving @ revolt in
Guba. Hovever, his general concept vould provide ‘for:

3. a. The President was mést interested in economic denial
‘actions. He was informed that talks would be undextaken in the
immediate future with representatives of the Canadian and Britich
governments relative to the supply of spare parts and critical materials
adian and British firme to Cuba. It wao stated that Spanich firme
wine active in this area, a8 well ac a number of essentially
-by-night firms located in a number of foreign countries. No

putable A:mesicen firms are engaged in supplying Cuba and, in fact,

ve bron helpful in preventing their foreign affiliates from engaging

this traffic. Apparontly, State regards the Canadian, the British

and the Spanish efforts as being the real trouble spots. The President.
directed that State undertake talks, 2¢ appropriate, with the governmenta
vi firma concerned to dissuade them from this practice.

b. Under questioning, Mr. FitzGerald stated that exploitation
of Cuban military digaffectiod is a long term undertaking. While there
are disaffected Cuban military mén in important posts, they have not,
to date, made any contacts with each other nor formed any sort of group.
However, Mr. FitzGerald considers that any successful operation to
overthrow Castro emanating from within Cuba will have to be supported
by the Cuban military if it {e to have any real likelihood of success.

¢. During the discuasion oa sabotage and harrassment, the
resident expressed his reluctance to undertake high risk actions at
this time for two reasons

(1) Curzent attempts to get OAS agreement to various
actions directed against Cuba might be jeopardized; and

(2) The Soviets seem to be watching closely the new
administration's policies toward Cuba, and it might influence unfavorably
the success of uur efforté to achieve further reductions,in Soviet military
personnel in Cuba. aoe

4, Mr. Helms briefed on the significance of the arms cache.
covered in Venezuela. Mr. Martin briefed upon the activities of
.¢ OAS. survey group now in Venezuela and the results, to date, of
their curvey. He stated that the group apparently had accepted that
the arms had been introduced for subversive purposes, but that the
survey group wae asking of the Venezuelan government further informa-
tion regarding propaganda activities directed against the Venezuelan
government, otc. He does not expect that the commission will report



peer

to the GAS prior to 10 January 1964. In the méantime, our effort
is deveted to ascertaining the maxirura that the GAS is prepared

to ds as 2 result of the Venezuela affair. They are hopeful that the
CAS will support an increased surveillance system, He thinks it is
‘00 early to expect a complete break in cconomic.and travel relations

between CAS countries and Cuba.

3. There was come discussion of further actions we might
take to increase preesures and harrassments at an appropriate time.
Amony other iteme mentioned were the effect of low tovel reconnaissance
flighto from time to tirhe and the dboirability of executing euch flights
at intervals to maintain the viability of our "right" to do 60, While the
President did not expreos disapprobation, neithor did he expres
=pprovel. In fact, no real decisions weré taken at this mecting which
must be regarded, I think, as being an important orientation session. *

HALAS ees

1, Problem. To provide planning guidence for US response to a coup in
Cuba in’order to assure that US intervention, if undertaken, results in
replacement of the Communist government with one acceptable to the United
States.

2. Ascumptions,

@. The leaders of the coup may or may not be avare, from previous
contact with CIA, that if they agree to and appear capable of meeting
certain specified conditions (see ‘peragtaph 2.4. below), their ‘revolt
will be supported by the US if a US “epecial. team" (see paragraph 3.b.(1)
below) confirms that the criteria for support have been adequstely met.
Thus, the coup could be triggered.in one of two ways: The leaders, in
secure radio contact with CIA, implement their plan with US concurrence
and establish @ Provisional Goverment in full expectation of forthcoming
US support barring a complete and immediate crushing of the uprising; or,
less acceptably, the ledders, in the belief that they can meet probable
criteria for US support, inittate ‘the coup vthout consulting with or
obtaining the concurrence of the US but establish 4 Provisional Govern-

ment, hoping that the US will intervene.

D. If the US had prior knowledge of the coup, up to forty-eight \\)
hours would be required after initiation of the action to introduce into
Cuba and receive reports from a "special team" which would obtein in-
formation to assist in making a decision to support the insurgents; if the
US did not have prior knowledge, a longer time would be required.

(1) A pre-arranged call for help from a Provisional Government
set up by the insurrectionists (preferably to the OAS, although US action,
vould mt await formal OAS approval), or

(2) A call for help from the insurrectionists after a coup had
started without prior US concurrence, if the US determined that the in-
surgents met generally the criteria for support, or

. (3) Intervention by local Soviet forces.

&. A coup should meet the following criteria to be supportable,
recognizing that specific criteria will depend upon the situation extst-
ent at the time: : il

(2). Have some power base in the Cuban army or militia in order
to survive.

(2) Be prepared to establish a Provisional Goverment, ‘however
rudimentary, with some sort of public claim to political viability to
provide an adequate political basis for overt US action (not required if
Soviet troops were clearly fighting Cuban patriots).

(3) Neutralize the top echelon of Cuban leadership.

(4) Seize and hold a significant piece of territory, preferebly
including Havana, long enough to permit the US plausibly to extend support
and some form of recognition to the Provisional Government.

e. Policy Considerations. For purposes of this paper, US policy af- -
fecting US support to a revolt in Cuba is summarized below. : :

(1) The US doés not contemplate either a premeditated full scale.
invasion of Cuba (except in the case of Soviet intervention or the re-

introduction of offensive weapons) or the contrivance of a provocation

. (2) By the seme token, it is not US policy to encourage un-
organized and uncoordinated mass uprisings since these would be too
easily crushed by indigenous Cuban military forces. The likelihood of

any spontaneous uprising surviving long enough to receive adequate US

paper is ‘Dased on the following general sequence of events:
+ Upon receipt of word that the dissident leaders have agreed to
and eppear capeble of meeting the criteria for US support, approval

would be given to commence: the coup at the earliest practicable time.
(In theevent that a coup vere initiated without prior US knowledge,

the US would proceed as described below but introduction of the special
team into Cuba would probebly be delayed and its task of gathering in-

formation made more aifficult. Consequently, it might not be possible

for the US to make 9 decision to support the coup in time to comit

forces needed to sustain it.)
+’ Upon receiving word that a coup had been initiated, either on
© Bre-arrenged tasis with CIA or as a surprise to the US Goverment, the

US would:

(1) Introduce into Cuba a "special teen to obtain information
which would assist in meking a decision to cupport ‘the insurgents. This
team, canposed ‘of severa) persons representing DOD, State, and CIA,.vould
meke contact with the coup leaders vithin twenty-four hours of the start
of the coup if the US had prior knowledge of the plan, probably later if
not. ‘The report ofthe findings should be received by CIA within twenty-
four hours after the team's arrival on the island but this might not be

possible without prior knowledge of the insurgents’ plans. In any event,

american
reliable reports from trained/ observers in Cuba would be of great value

to making a decision to intervene in order that the US would not comit

its prestige to the support of an uprising vhich might collapse prior to

the point at which US help has become effective enough to sustain and-
expand it. (The special-team, augmented as appropriate by CINCLANT,

would remain in Cuba as a liaison element with the Provisional Govern-
ment if the US intervened end would be directed to report immediately

to CINCLANT for operational control at the time the decision was made

to intervene.) :

(2) Order forces needed to establish an air and sea blockade
of Cuba to take assigned stations in preparation for implementing the
‘blockade; commence generating and positioning forces required for the
implementation of CINCLANT OPLANS 312’ end 316.

c+ A recommendation to intervene, based on a multiple source in-
telligence assessment including the special team's report, would be

made to the President. This would be the critical. decision because,

once made, certain actions would ensue immediately and, henceforth,

the US vould be committed to the ultimate success of the coup. These ac-

tions would include:
” (1) The assumption by CINCLANT of’ conmand of all militery

and para-military operations in Cuba. :
‘ (2) Prompt introduction of small groups of personnel:.for’the
purposes of intelligence, reconnaissance, communications and liaison
with the insurgents, and provision of unattributable logistic support
by eirdrop-or submarine, In the event that the US delsyed public an-
nouncement of the decision to support the coup, this assistance would
ve provided in such a manner as to minimize public knowledge of active

US involvement in Cuba.
(3) When authorized by the President, direct the special team

to have the coup leaders proclaim a Provisional Govermment, if one has

not already been established, and request US and OAS assistance in order
to provide: justification for a blockede and consultation within the OAS.

As soon as the request for help is received, the President vould announce
publicly that the US will isolate Cuba by means of an air and sea blockade
to become effective at (time, date), The justification for this unilateral,
interim action would be based on Paragraph 3 of Resolution-2 of the Punta
del Esta meeting of Foreign Ministers until such time ag the COAS/OC es~
tablished a collective basis for the blockade, as well ae to insure that
support for either side is not provided from external sources. Actually,
the ennourcement would be designed to immobilize the Cuban Navy end Air
Force, encourage indigenous support for the insurgents, and reinforce a

warning to the Soviet Union not to intervene. (See Paragraph %.a. belov).

(4) Complete positioning of forces for implementation of por-
tions or all of CINCLAND CPLAHS 312 and 316.

a. The US would have the option of replying to a formal call for
help by either publicly announcing immediately its intention to support
the Provisional Goverment end initiating overt military operations, or
responding by establishing a blockade without admitting other support
for the coup. In the latter case, the US would, between the time of the
Presidential announcement of the blockade and public announcement of the
other forms of support, employ small groups of intelligence and recon-
naissence units, thereby providing visible evidence. to .the insurgents

thet support is forthcoming and yet providing a facade of non-iditervention

while the US consulte with its allies to gain their political support.

At the same time, the US would be generating and positioning forces re-
quired for significant overt military operations. Upon publicly announc-
ing US intent to support the Provisional Government, the US would initiate
overt logistical and air support to the insurgents. There is a possibility
that this level of assistance end demonstrated US intent would be suffi-
cient to bring down the Castro. regime, if the coup carried with it a
significant elenent of the Cuben aimed forces.. However, tt 18 probeble
that the US vould have to introduce conventional forces incrementally as
required to sustain the uprising and should be prepared to and would im-
plement portions or all of CINCLANT OPLANS 312 end 316, as required.

precise description of pretexts which the Joint Chiefs of
Staff consider would provide justification for US military

used as a basis for developing a time-phased plan. The
individual projects can. then be considered on a case-by-

3. This plan, incorporating projects selected from the
attached suggestions, or from other sources, should be
developed to focus ail efforts on a specific ultimate
objective which would provide adequate justification for

US military intervention. Such a plan would enable a
logical build-up of incidents to be combined with other
seemingly unrelated events to camouflage the ultimate
objective and create the necessary impression of Cuban
rashness and irresponsibility on a large scale, directed
at other countries as well as the United States. The plan
would also properly integrate and time phase the courses

of action to be pursued. The desired resultant from the
execution of this plan would be to place the United States
in the apparent position of suffering defensible grievances
from a rash and irresponsible government of Cuba and to
develop an international image of a Cuban threat to peace
in the Western Hemisphere.

PRETEXTS TO JUSTIFY US MILITARY INTERVENTION IN CUBA

(Note: ‘The courses of action which follow are a preliminary
submission suitable only for planning purposes. They are
arranged neither chronologically nor in ascending order.
Together with similar inputs from other agencies, they are
intended to provide a point of departure for the development
of a single, integrated, time-phased plan. Such a plan would
permit the evaluation of individual projects within the context
of cumulative, correlated actions designed to lead inexorably
to the objective of adequate justification for US military
intervention in Cuba),

1, Since it would seem desirable to use legitimate
provocation as the basis for US military intervention in Cuba
a cover and deception plan, to include requisite preliminary
actions such as has been developed .in response to Task 33 co,
could be executed as an initial effort to provoke Cuban
reactions. Harassment plus deceptive actions to convince the
Cubans of imminent ‘invasion would be emphasized. Our militery
posture throughout exeoution of the plan will allow @ repid
change from exercise to intervention if Cuban response justifies.

2. A series of well coordinated incidents will be planned
to take place in and around Guantanamo to give genuine
appearance of being done by hostile Cuban forces.

a. Incidents to establish a credible attack (not in
chronological ordex’):.

(1) Start rumors (many). Use clandestine radio.

(2) Land friendly Cubans in uniform “over-the-fence"
to stage attack on base.

(3) Capture cuban (friendly) saboteurs inside the
base.

(4) Start riots near the base main gate (friendly
Cubans).

3 Fi aa

\

wee SECTET-SPECAT-RENTTING- WerORR—

TOP-SECRET» SPECHAL-HANDLING —HOFORH

(5) Blow up ammunition inside the base; start fires.
(6) Burn aircraft on air base (sabotage).
(7) Lob mortar shells from outside of base into base.

Some damage to installations.

(8) Capture assault teams approaching from the sea
or vicinity of Guantanamo City.
(9) Capture militia group which storms the base.
(10) Sabotage ship in harbor; latge fires -- napthalene.
(21) Sink ship near harbor entrance. Conduct funerals

for mock-victims (may be lieu of (10)).

b. United States would respond by executing offensive
operations to secure water and power supplies, destroying
artillery and mortar emplacements which threaten the base.

c. Commence large scale United States military operations.
3. A "Remember the Maine" incident could be arranged in

several forms: E :

a. We could blow up a US ship in Guantanamo Bay and
blame Cuba.

b. We could blow up a drone (unmanned) vessel anywhere
in the Cuban waters, We could arrange to cause such incident
in the vicinity of Havana or Santiago as a spectacular result
of Cuban attack from the air or sea, or both. The presence
of Cuban planes or ships merely investigating the intent of
the vessel could be fairly compelling evidence that the ship
was taken under attack. The nearness. to Havana or Santiago
would add credibility especially to those people that might
have heard the blast or have seen the fire. The US could
follow up with an air/sea rescue operation covered by US
fighters to "evacuate" remaining members of the non-existent
orew. Casualty lists in US newspapers would cause a helpful
wave of national indignation. : .

4, We could develop a Commmist Cuban terror campaign in
the Miami area, in other Florida cities and even in Washington.

4


13-00000

The terror campaign could be pointed at ‘Cuban refugees seeking
haven in the United States. We could sink a boatload of Cubans
enroute to Florida (real or simulated). We could foster attempts
on lives of Cuban refugees in the United States even to ‘the
extent of wounding in instances to be widely publicized.
Exploding a few plastic bombs in carefully chosen spots, the
arrest of Cuban agents and the release of prepared documents
substantiating Cuban involvement also would be helpful in
projecting the idea of an irresponsible government.

5. A "Quban-besed, Castro-supported” filibuster could be
simulated against a neighboring Caribbean nation (in the vein
of the 14th of June invasion of the Dominican Republic). we
know that Castro is backing subversive efforts clandestinely
against Haiti, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, and Nicaragua at
present and possible others. These efforts can be magnified and
additional ones contrived for exposure. For example, advantage
oan be taken of the sensitivity of the Dominican Air Force to
intrusions within their national air space. "Cuban" B-26 or
C-N6 type airoraft could make cane-burning raids at night.
Soviet Bloo incendiaries could be found. This could be coupled
with "Cuban" messages to the Communist underground in the
Dominican Repiblic and "Cuban" shipments of arms which would
be found, or intercepted, on the beach. é

6. Use of MIG type aircraft by US pilots could provide
additional provocation. Harassment of civil air, attacks on
surface shipping and destruction of US military drone aircraft
by MIG type planes would be useful as complementary actions.

An F-86 properly painted would convince air passengers that they
saw a Cuban waza, especially if the pilot of the transport were
to announce such fact. The primary drawback to this suggestion
appears to be the security risk inherent in obtaining or modify-
ing an aircraft. However, reasonable copies of the MIG could
be produced from US resources in about three months.

7. Hijacking attempts against civil air and surface oraft
should appear to continue ag harassing measures condoned by the
government of Cuba. Concurrently, genuine defections of Cuban
civil and militery air and surface craft should be encouraged.

8. It 18 possible to create an incident which will demonstrate
convincingly that a Cuban aircraft has attacked and shot down
a, chartered civil airliner enroute from the United States to
Jamaica, Guatemala, Panama or Venezuela. The destination would
be chosen only to cause the flight Plan route to cross Cuba.
The passengers could be a group of college students off on a
holiday or any grouping of persons with a common interest to
support chartering a non-scheduled flight.

a. An airoraft at Eglin AFB would be painted and
numbered as an exact duplicate for a civil registered
airoraft belonging to a CIA proprietary organization in the
Miami area. At a designated time the duplicate would be
substituted for the actual civil aircraft and would be
loaded with the selected passengers, all boarded under
carefully prepared aliases. The actual registered
airoraft would be converted to a drone. .

bd. Take off times of the drone aivoraft and the actual
eiroraft will be scheduled to allow a rendezvous south of
Florida. From the rendezvous point the passenger-carrying
airoraft will descend to minimum altitude and go direotiy
into an auxiliary field at Eglin AFB where arrangements will
have been made to evacuate the passengers and return the
airoraft to its original status. The drone airoraft
meanwhile will continue to fly the filed flight plan. When
over Cuba the drone will being transmitting on the inter-
national distress frequency a "MAY DAY" message stating he
4s under attack by Cuban MIG aircraft. ‘The transmission

will be interrupted by destruction of the aircraft which will
be triggered by radio signal.. This will allow ICAO radio



13-00000

stations in the Western Hemisphere to tell the US what

has happened to the aircraft instead of the US trying to .

"“gell" the incident. :

9. It 18 possible to create an inoident which will make it
appear that Commmnist Cuban MIGs have destroyed a USAF aircraft
over international waters in an unprovoked attack. :

a. Approximately 4 or 5 F-101 airoraft will be dispatched
in trail from Homestead AFB, Florida, to the vicinity of Cuba.

Their mission will be to reverse course and simulate fakir

airoraft for an air defense exercise in southern Florida.

These aircraft would conduct variations of these flights at

frequent intervals. Crews would be briefed to remain at

least 12 miles off the Cuban coast; however, they would ‘be
required to carry live ammunition in the event that hostile
actions were taken by the Cuban MIGs. :
b. On one such flight, a pre-briefed pilot would fly
tell-end Charley at considersble interval between airoraft,

While near the Cuban Island this pilot would broadcast that

. he had been jumped by MIGs and was going down. No other
calls would be made. The pilot would then fly directly

west at extremely low altitude and land at a seoure base, an

Eglin auxiliary. The airoraft would be met by the proper

people, quickly stored and given a new tail number. The

Pilot who had performed the mission under an alias, would

resume his proper identity and return to his normal place

of business. The pilot and aircraft would then have

disappeared, a

6. At precisely the same time that the aircraft was‘
presumably shot down a submarine or small surface craft:
would disburse F-101 parts, parachute, ets., at approximately

. 15 to 20 miles off the Cuban coast and depart. The pilots
returning to Homestead would have a true story as far as
they Imew. Searoh ships and aircraft could be @ispatohed
and parts ef airoraft found. :

JUSTIFICATION FOR US MILITARY INTERVENTION IN CUBA (TS)

THE PROBLEM .

1. As requested” by Chief of Operations, Cuba Project, the
Joint Chiefs of Staff are to indicate brief but precise
description of pretextswhich they consider would provide
justification for US military intervention in Guba.

‘ FACTS BEARING ON THE PROBLEM

2. It is recognized that any action which becomes pretext
for US military intervention in Cube will lead to a political
decision which then would lead to military action.

3. Cognizande has been taken of a suggested course of
actien proposed” by the US Navy relating to generated
instances in the Guantanamo area.

4, For additional facts see Enclosure B.

DISCUSSION

.5. The suggested coursegof action appended to Enclosure A
are based on the premise that US military intervention will
result from a period of heightened US-Cuban tensions which
Place the United States in the position of suffering justif-
table grievances. World opinion, and the United. Nations
forum should be favorably.affected by developing the inter-
national image of the Cuban government as fash and irresponsible,
and as an alerming and unpredictable threat to the peace of
the Western Hemisphere.

6. While the foregoing premise can be utilized at the
present time it will continues to hold good only as long as
there oan be reasonable certainty that US military intervention
in Cuba would not directly involve the Soviet Union. There is

as yet no bilateral mutual support agreement binding the USSR

to the defense of Cuba, Cuba has not yet become a member of the
Warsaw Pact, nor have the Soviets established Soviet bases

in Cuba in the pattern of US bases in Western Europe. Therefore,

since time appears to be an important factor in resolution of
the Cuba problem, all projects are suggested within the time
frame of the next few months.
CONCLUSION

7. The suggested courses of action appended to Enclosure A
satisfactorily respond to the statement of the problem. However,
these suggestions’should be forwarded as a preliminary submission
suitable for planning purposes, and together with similar inputs
from other agencies, provide a basis for development of a single,
integrated, time-phased plan to focus all efforts on the
objective of justification for US military intervention in Cuba.

ANNEX TO APPENDIX TO ENCLOSURE A
PRETEXTS TO JUSTIFY US MILITARY INTERVENTION IN CUBA

(Note: ‘The courses of action which follow are a preliminary
submission suitable only for planning purposes. They are :
arranged neither chronologically nor in. ascending order.
Together with similar inputs from other agencies, they are
intended to provide a point of departure for the development
of a single, integrated, time-phased plan. such a plan would
permit the evaluation of individual projects within the context :
of cumilative, correlated actions designed to lead inexorably
to the objective of adequate justification for US military
intervention in Cuba). oa

1, Since 1t would seem desirable to use legitimate
Provocation as the basis for US military intervention in Cuba
@ cover and deception plan, to inolude requisite preliminary
actions such as has been developed in response to Task 33 0c,
could be executed as an initial effort to provoke Cuban
reactions. Harassment plus deceptive actions to convinces the

2 Cubans of imminent ‘invasion would be emphasized.. Our military
Posture throughout execution of the plan will allow a rapid
change from éxeroise to intervention if Cuban response: justifies.

2.'A series of-well coordinated incidents will be planned
to take place in and around Guantanamo ‘td give gemuine
appearance of being done by hostile Cuban forces.

&. Incidents to establish a credible attack (not in
chronological order):

(1) Start rumors (many). Use clandestine radio.

(2) Land friendly Cubans in uniform "over-the-fence"
to stage attack on base.

(3). Capture Cuban (friendly) saboteurs inside the
base.

(4) Start riots near the base main gate (friendly
Cubans).

iL.



13-00000

(5) Blow up anmunition inside the base; start fires.
(6) Burn eiroraft on air base (sabotage).
(7) Lob mortar shells from outside of base into base.
Some damage to installations.
(8) Capture assault teams approaching from the sea
or vicinity of Guantanamo City.
(9) Capture militia group which storms the base.
(10) Sabotage ship in harbor; large fires -~ napthalene.
(11) Sink ship near harbor entrance. Conduct funerals
for mock-viotims (may be lieu of (10)).
bd. United States would respond by executing offensive
operations to secure water and power supplies, destroying
artillery end mortar emplacements which threaten the base.
©. Commence large scale United States military operations.
3. A "Remember the Maine" inoident could be arranged in
several forms:
@. We could blow up a US ship in Guantanamo Bay and
: blame Cuba.

. b. We could blow up a drone (unmanned) vessel anywhere
in the Cuban waters. We could arrange to cause such incident
in the vicinity of Havana or Santiago as a spectacular result
of Cuban attack from the air or sea, or both. The presence
of Cuban plenes or ships merely investigating the intent of
the vessel could be fairly compelling evidence that the ship
was taken under attack. ‘The nearness to Havana or Santiago
would add credibility especially to those people that might
have heard the blast or have seen the fire. The US could
follow up with en air/sea. rescue operation covered by US
fighters to “evacuate" remaining members of the non-existent
orew. Casualty lists in US newspapers would cause a. helpful
wave of national indignation.

4, We could develop a Commmist Cuban terror campaign in
tiie Miami area, in other Florida oities and even in Washington.

“Ghe terror campaign could be pointed at Cuban refugees seeking
haven in the United states. We could sink @ boatload of Cubans
enroute to Florida (real or simulated). We could foster attempts
“on lives of Cuban refugees in the United States even to. the
extent of wounding in instances to be widely publicized.
Exploding a few plastic bombs in carefully chosen spots, the
errest of Cuban agents and the release of prepared documents
substantiating Cuban involvement also would be helpful in
projecting the idea of an irresponsible goverment.
5. A "Ouban-based, Castro-supported” filibuster could be
similated against a neighboring Caribbean nation (in the vein
of the 14th of June invasion of the Dominican Republic). we
‘mow that Castro is backing subversive efforts olandestinely
against Haiti, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, and Nicaragua at
present and possible others. ‘These efforts can be magnified and
additional ones contrived for exposure. For example, advantage
can be taken of the sensitivity of the Dominican Air Force to
intrusions within their national sir space. "Cuban" B-26 or
o-6 type aircraft could make cane-burning raids at. night.
Soviet Bloo incendiaries could be found. This could be coupled
with "Cuban" messages to the Communist underground in the
Dominican Republi¢ and "Cuban" shipments of arms which would
be found, or intercepted, on the beach.!”*

6. Use of MIG type aircraft by US pilots could provide
additional provocation. Harassment of civil air, attacks on
surface shipping and destruction of US military drone atroraft
by MIG type planes would be useful as complementary actions.

An F-86 properly painted would convince air passengers that they
saw a Cuban MIG, especially if the pilot of the transport were
to announce such fact, The primary drawback to this suggestion
appears to be the security risk inherent in obtaining or modify-
ing an aircraft. However, reasonable copies of the MIG could
be produced from US resources in about three months.

Annex to Appendix
9 to Enclosure A



T. Hijacking attempts against civil air and surface craft
should spear to continue as harassing measures condoned by the
goverrment of Cuba. Conourrently, genuine defections of Cuban
odvil and military air and surface craft should be encouraged.

8. It 18 possible to create an incident which will demonstrate
convinoingly that a Cuban‘ atroraft has attacked and shot down
a chartered civil airliner enroute from the United States to

Jamaioa, Guatemala, Panama or Venezuela. The destination would
be chosen only to cause the flight plan route to oross Cuba.
The pessengers could be a group of college students off'on a

holiday or any grouping of persons with a common interest. to

support chartering e non-scheduled flight.

@. An aircreft at Eglin AFB would be painted and
numbered as an exact duplicate for a civil registered
aircraft belonging to e GIA proprietary organization in the
Miami area. At a designated time the duplicate would be
substituted for the actual oivil airoraft and would be
loaded with the selected passengers, all boarded under
carefully prepared aliases. ‘The actual registered
atroreft would be converted to a drone,

b. Take off times of the drone aircraft and the actual
- adroraft will be scheduled to allow a rendezvous south of
Florida. Prom the rendezvous point the passenger-oarrying
airoraft will descend to minimum altitude and go directly
into an auxiliary field at Eglin AFS where arrangements will
have been made to evacuate the passengers and return the
alroraft to its original status. The drone aircraft
meanwhile will contime to fly the filed flight plan. when
over Cuba the drone will being transmitting on the inter-
. national distress frequency a "MAY DAY" message stating he
je under attack by Cuban MIG airoraft. ‘The transmission
will be interrupted by destruction of the airoraft which will
be triggered by radio signal. ‘This will allow ICAO radio

stations in the Western Hemisphere to tell the US what

has heppened to the airoraft instead of the US trying to

“gell" the inoident. : ; :

9. Tb 48 possible to create an incident which will make 1t
appear that Commmnist Cuban MIGs have destroyed a USAF aircraft
over international waters in an unprovoked attack.

a. Approximately 4 or 5 P-101 airoraft will be dispatched
in trail from Homestead AFB, Florida, to the vicinity of Cuba.
Their mission will be to reverse course and simlate fakir
airoraft for an air defense exercise in southern Florida. ©
These aircraft would conduct variations of these flights at
frequent intervals. Crews would be briefed to remain at
least 12 miles off the Cuban coast; however, they would be
required to carry live ammmition in the event that hostile
actions were taken by the Ouban MiGs.

‘b. On one such flight, a pre-briefed pilot would fly
tail-end Charley at considerable interval between aircraft.
While near the Cuban Island this pilot would broadcast that

‘ he had teen jumped by MIGs and was going down. No other
calls would be made. The pilot would then fly directly
west at extremely low altitude and land at a secure base, an
Eglin auxiliary. ‘The airoraft would be met by the proper
people, quickly stored and given a new tail number. The
Pilot who had performed the mission under an elias,
resume his proper identity and return to his normal place
of business. The pilot and aircraft would then have
disappeared.

©. At precisely the same time that the airoraft was
presumably shot down a submarine or small surface craft
would disburse F-101 parts, parachute, eto., at approximately
15 to 20 miles off the Cuban coast and depart. ‘The pilots
returning to Homestead would have a true story as far as
they Imew, Search ships and airoreft could be dispatched
and parts ef aircraft found.

ENCLOSURE B

FACTS BEARING ON THE PROBLEM

1. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have previously stated”
that US unilateral military intervention in Cuba can’ be
undertaken in the event that the Cuban regine commits hostile
acts against US forces or property which would serve as an
incident upon’ which to base overt intervention.

@. The need for positive action in the event that current
covert efforts to foster an internal Cuban rebellion are
‘unsuccessful was indieated** by the Joint eee of Staff
on 7 March 1962, as follows:

". - - determination that a credible. internal

revolt is impossible of attainment during the next

9-10 months will require a decision by the United States,

to develop a Cuban "provocation" as justification for

: positive US military action."

3. It is understood that the Department of State also is
preparing suggested courses of action to develop justification
for US military intervention in Cuba.

While we goustaily Gear with the paper prepared by the
Department of State, we do not believe that the proposals contained
therein present a sufficiently wide spectrum of options or activities

to impede and stop Castro/Communist subversion in Latin America.
Specifically, we recommend the following additional actions:

a) Measures to attrit Cuban resources:
__ da) Purchase the defection of personnel,
aircraft, ships, boats and other valuable items.

{b) Conduct non-attributable actions, Against
petroleum resources, upon which much of Cuba's pase depends.
‘These actions ‘should extend all the way from direct destruction to
sabotage through chemical and bacterial contamination of carriers
and storage,

(c) By means of intelligence indications (aircraft
flights, agents, clear radio transmission, beach jumpers) cause Cuban
military forces to stand continually at high alert level and thus:. to
consume supplies which could otherwise be dedicated to subversive

training.

(4) Consider introduction of counterfeit currency

in large quantities, to distort the Cuban financial posture, and to

,

undermine confidence.

to the Latin who, like the American, believes what he reads:
(c) Distribute Anti-Communist Literature

_ Books and pamphlets, in large numbers,

exposing the reality of communism should be printed in Spanish and
Portuguese and distributed through inexpensive commercial sale.

(4) Greatly expanded training and orientation in the
United States for key segments of each Latin American country's
population, such as:
(a) Enlisted as well as officer military personnel
to be schooled in Panama and/or the United States, fine
(b) Police personnel to be schooled in Panama
or in the United States.
(c) Newspaper personnel to be schooled within
the United States,
{d) Nurses (male and female) to be trained in the
United States.
{e) Civilian technicians to be trained in United
States training schools.
The thrust of such an expanded training program,
taking place in the United States, 1s not just to enhance.the skill and
education level of the people involved but, even more, to expose the

Latins to US influence, to show them our country, to persuade them by

TK.A.3.d. General Pressures to Create a Contingency

In order to accomplish the overthrow or reorientation of the Cuba
regime without harming the United States image and with minimm distortion
of bilateral US-USSR relationships, there must be careful coordination and
hosing of our future actions and demesnor. There mist be @ plan capable
of getting us from where we are now to where ve vant to go, ty gredually
increasing pressures until the objective 1s achieved. ‘These pressures
should be designed to reste opportunities and contingsi tions

for further exploitation, along the way. Oe

The optimm orchestration of suche Cuban program mst obviously be
developed as the future unfolds. But in order to provide overall guidénce
vithin this Goverment, a plan tracing the nainstreans of effort 1s required.
This plan is divided into eight headings with a gradually inefeasing level
of effort described under each of these headings. ‘he progress through
the various phases is visualized as taking place in a coordinated but not
necessarily symmetrical manner. In other words, we may be in the most
vigorous phase of propaganda while not yet having reached the final phase
with regerd to subversion but nonetheless the decision to proceed to the
respective phase ‘in either category would be cooriinsted as -part of an
overall governmental orchestration.

A program scenario capable of producing a decisive change or
exploiteble contingency over en 18-month period follows. °

US Posture - ~ Initially the US image should be that of willingness
to do all thet is necessary to keep Cestzo's militery threat nil end his

subversive threat to the Western Hemisphere at en acceptably low level.
It should be characterized as one during which the USG, hhaving been

* extremely ressonable despite Castro's intransigence, 1s vaiting for signs
. "” of more favorable change in Cubs.

Later the US image should change to one in which the US is being _
"led" by the majority of the OAS into OAS initiated and sponsored
Pressures against Cuba. These would consist of measures less than those
certain to overthrow Castro but going beyond the earlier measures, in
oH the expectation that resulting internal pressures might eliminate Castro

“te provide an occasion for decisive ection. Pressures vould be applied
~” ..) im such fashion as’ to represent both a carrot to the Cuban people to get

rid of Castro regime and a stick toverd the present regims. still leter
v4 the US stance should becom: publicly, "at last" to join the OAS majority :
4n seeking vigorous pressures ‘on the Castro regime_without yet irrevocably
committing US prestige to decisive action. :

Finally, if and vhen the orchestration and circumstances have
brought the U3 position to such a point that decisive action 4e possible,
and if earlier pressures have not eliminated Castro or do not give promise
of eliminating, stao decisive action might be considered. tts need not
be an invasion by UB forces and could be re-faposition of total blockade
or a disarming airstrike, dependent on the circumstances.

QAS Action - - The USG will need to devote major attention to the
strengthening of the solidarity of the OAS as a source of regional
opposition to the Castro regime. These efforts should go forward openly
along several Mines, quite apart from the covert effort to organize the
majority on specific issues. mis effort to achieve. solidarity should
consist of frequent briefings of the OAS nations through all appropriate
\ 7° .chamnels, Consultative Meetings of Foreign Ministers of the OAS, efforts

to set up an OAS military organization with occasional commitment of troops

*.) "$or training, énd oll other feasible developments of regionel themes, such
as intensive efforts to build up the counterinsurgency capabilities of the
region. - It 1s very necessary, in view of the general IA situation to
continue all measures necessary to isolate Castro.

aa Initial OAS action should be the enlargement of the bases for the

Anvocation of the Rio Treaty. ‘This broadening should be against the con-

‘timed presence of Soviet troops (unless negotiations ea as wees initeete
that this aspect should be deferred) and/or against Castro's continued

subversive activity. Concomitantly, the recent study of the. Special

Consultative Committees on Security should be given wide publicity and ,

"the US choula press for implemintation of ite recomendations, :

‘The OAS, in the near future, probably after publication of the results

of the ‘foregoing study and. enlargement of the basis for invoking the Rio
Treaty to include subversion, should egain formally warn Guba against
= . Promotion of any more subversive activities. The OAS should formlly

state that should Cuban subversive activities rise above sone (unspecified)
level, © "new condition” would exist vhich woild justify decisive action
__— against Cuba, ALL episodes of subversion or sabotage vhich could be
attributed to Castro should be highly publicized. ‘the majority OAS support
_ should be organized to neutralize the Brazilian co-existence theme.
J Ba.ateral approsches and economic quid pro quos should be used to win
Brazil to the U.s. view vithin OAS.
sti aster, at an appropriate time, the ‘OAS should make an official

finding, from its studies initiated enrlier, that the Castro regine has
continued, despite warnings, to conduct aggressive and subversive ections
in Letin America. A summary publication of subversive activities or



13-00000

“Witte Paper shoula be promilgated through the OAS. Ister a “new condition"
should ve found formally to exist, following which the US would state
‘that the earlier US-USSR modns vivendt regardiig’Cuba.has come to an end.
Following the above,-an GAS vote should call for the neasining IA metiicie——
to sever diplomstic relations with Cube and for all menbers to restrict

their nationals from travel to Cuba. Castro should be officially labeled

as a-major threat to the hemiephere and to the objective of the Alliance

for Progress.

The OAS might then declare thet Castro's gubversive activity constitutes
warlike ectivity end proclain e prohibition against eny varlike activity
being conducted by Cubs within an océen and land area around the entire LA
continental end Caribbean area, Intervention of afreraft and’ shipe
carrying arms, subversive agents, rropagands materials, ete. could be

Still later at an appropriate time the OAS should vote, under the
Rio Pact, to punish Castro's aggression. This action could take the
form of a resolution for all menbers to take such action including the
use of force as individually considered appropriate or to endorse any
specific decisive action to which the menbers hed agreed.

‘The USG should brief its Allies an the views of the OAS and warn that
the sitistion may get worse. Later, as a result of “OAS insistence" the
Free World should be urged to extend or re-affirm trade eubargos to all
items except food stuffe, medicines, and medical supplies; to-spply shipping
restrictions; NATO should be persuaded to include: Cuba on the list of
countries to which shipment of COCOM list (strategic) items is prohibited;
free vorld industrial nations should be dissuaded from shipping to Cuba

Mumit their airline services-to Cuba and to withhold transit rights to

After thet tine minimal covert contacts should be established vithin

-Purpose. vould be to estsblich rebel connotation end to generate leatlership.
Tais vould lead to the establishment of rudimentary c@liular training

in seditious activity. Minimal supply of critical items should be initiated

to subversive groups within Cuba on a case-by-case basis. Potential leaders
should be identified. Contingency planning, covert and unilateral, should
continue. The mmber of Cuban exiles teken into the United States Armed

Forces for training and formtion of reserve units should be significantly
fmoreased. A siniler program for “freedom fighters for Cuba” should be :
undertaken for’ volunteers from other IA nations. At a later. point in the
crescento, departures from the Cuban armed forces in organized units should

‘be encouraged. All covert effort should be exerted toward conrdinsting

the cells, pockets, and groups resisting Castro, inside and outside Cuba.

This would be, a transition period from sporadic acts in isolation into

organized subversion. Puel:and: food suppliés: should be sabotaged. An
organized supply system should be put into effect with large mmbers of

fied in revolt, they should be vorked into the supply system. New IA and

Cubsn fighters training cutside.Cuba, should be introduced in the seme way

into these organized movements within Cuba. ‘There should be frequeat
Jeaks of planned US invasion and eypropriate denials to frustrate the
suspicious Castro. Fleet and air “training” denbustretions should be
scheduled off Cubs. At the que time it should be mde clear to rebel
Jeaders that an externally launched invasion is not to be expected until
@ revolution has come from vithin, vith external logistic assistance.

"Te should ve emphasized to the reicl lenéers that the U.S. does not expect
the clock to be turned back with regard to social conditions.

" gti2a .eter 0 complete orchestration should be woven together,
coming to a crescendo through the optimel exploitation of all the min-
etreans discussed in the categories ebove. Propagenda should reach the
maximum denunciation of the regime, ezhorting to revolt, holding up the
prospect of peace and a better life should the Cuban people join their
resistance leaders. Subversion should be stepped up by introduction of
al available externally trained vesictenze fighters, provision of maximm
logistic support, etc. s% the ep.roprict: “vime, if this resistance noverent
needs the essistance of external forces there should be an OAS structured
air strike, related to an sppropriete Castro mis-step, to diserm Cuban .
offensive and defensive pover and to destroy all FOL storage. This atteck
should be coordinated with all-out saboteze.

An invasion force should be kept in readiness for use, if re-
quired to save the resistance, once the ol1-out internal resistance
efforts has been initiated.
Criteria -- The pressures discussed in all categories above should

‘be appropriately coordinated. The period of moderation should end after
one or two months when it 4s apparent that no further Soviet nilitary
personnel are to be removed. Moderate pressures should then commence,
lasting for a period of two to-three months, until some episode of
escalation by Castro or other appropriate event, makes further pressures
feasible. If such an event is not forthcoming, OAS major insistence should
lead to escalation of pressures. After enother shart period, again pre-
ferable triggered ty en appropriate Ccstro episode or alternatively by @
majority OAS vote still more vigorous pressures should be initiated.

2 iA FOR Tis NSTIONAL SECURETY COUNCIL'S EXECUTIVE COMMITTZE

(@s-pared for tha Meating of » February _, 1963, 4 P.M.)
FROM: Coordinator of Cuba Affairs i qi

SUBJECT: Psychological Program in Support of U.S. Policy on Cuba

3 \

Objectives A
Hee Tha basic program adopted by the Executive Committee on January
25, 1963 sets forth major objectives for our policy toward Cuba, It als

compits us to "be prepared to increase the political, econosiic, psycho-

logical and military pressures, as appropriate opportunities present
; °

themselves, or can be created." i

This memorandum outlines a program that will meet the paychologica:

requirements of our overall policy.
Role of Psychological Operation:

A successful psychological campaign cannot be viewed solely as a
propaganda exercise or an informational program. It should cover actio
and statements--all that is said or done solely or primarily for psycho:
logical effect, This definition sets off psychological activities from

those actions undertaken primarily for their direct value--whether in tt
fields of intelligence, military, political, or economic action.

One of the tasks of psychological: operations is to.exploi. other

es-vities to maximum advantage, or to seek to minimize any nc sative as:

to balance possibly conflicting intarests and to determine which, in any
given circumstance, shall have priority.
Strategy and’ Tactics etctee .
Wa gust keep in mind constantly the relationship between what happens
"Gm Guba and the overall struggle between ourselyes and the Communists. _
We should seek to insure that the Cuban situation will develop in a way
that will:

a) lead to the collapse or overthrow of the Castro regime;

b)' demonstrate to the Cyban people and to'the world at large that

-| communism is not a solution for the problems of a.developing

coyntry;

c).diseredit Castro and his associates and their methods of opera~
tion throughout the Americas;

d) insure that the burden imposed by Cuba on the Soviet Union and.
the satellites adds substantially to thea mounting evidence that
efforts to export commmist revolution are unsuccessful and ex-
cessively costly.

Our focus should always be on the first of these objectives--the
end of the commmnist regime in Cuba, But pending achievement of tais,
we'csn rove toward the other objectives. And they, after all, are of
majoz importance to our overall strategic purposes.

z FORTEAN



13-00000

Wa have the possibility of insuring that so long as Cuba remains
Communist it will serve as an open, bleeding wound that will weaken the
Communist cause generally, This strategic concept is one which the
Communists have tried to use against us.

Our tactical approach should be designed to fit this overall concept.
It calls for the utilization of every ‘avaiieble weapon in our aresenal
and engagement, day~in and day-out, in a multi-faceted struggle at all
levels. i:

Our initial aim should be to wésken steadily the capability, con-
fidence and will of the a (inside and outside Cuba) and, correspond-
ingly, to Strengthen our side. We heed not, indeed ought not, ateke every-
taing on one great effort. Nor should we concentrate on simply building
up our forces and husbanding them "until the right time comas" for a final
showdown, ni

Instead, our effort should be directed toward achieving an unbroken
series of. small suecesses, encompassing gains on the part of anti-Castxo
elements and failures onthe part of the regime itself. Our aim should
be that the end of each day'would sea the position and prospects of the
Castro regime and little worse than they had been at sunrise.

resort to terrorist methods egainst the populace, an unexplained fire,
exeetion of suspicion in a minor but key official, _ sudden appearance
of antiregime slogans on walls, a " defection ‘from the armed forcess-these
and similar things, whether major or minor, and over and over agzin on

a mounting scale, will have a cumilative impact, In the long run, they

can be equivalent to a major victory.

The important thing is to keep-the pressure on, to never give the
‘regime @ respite, to see that the series of small defeats and setbacks
is unbroken and unending “our purpose is to create a a cnn in which
the regime and its supporters steadily lose hope and Heart, in Deter they
coma to “accept the certainty of eventual defeat.

Meanwhile, repercussions wauld be felt throughout the Commnist
world, Assistance to the regime would increasingly be regarded as a
“xat hole" operation. The "example of Cuba" would become the reverse of
expectations; fidelismo would become a term of opprobrium,

In short, the goal is to bring about the elimination of the castro
regime without resort to direct and massive forcé, We cannot rule our
the possibility that some reliance on force may become necessary to. insu

finel victory for anti-Castro forces. But the greater and more effec-

is the effort herein outlined, the more we are likely to insure thai

Specific programs to carry: out this kind of approach to the Giban

probiem are submitted in Annexes A and B. /

fudiences and Targets
The psychological program should be directed at the following primary

audiences or target groups: +
1) the Guba people. Our goal should be to encourage dissatisfaction
ae with the present and hope for the future once Castroism is eli-
miaminated. It should be made clear that the next chapter of Cuba's
history must be written by the Cubans, But they should know that

they will have friendly support from others.

2). the Castro regime, * Our goal should be to create dissension, doubt
and hopelessness inside the ruling clique.

3) Latin America. In progrsing ‘directed at the peoples and govern-

ments of the hemisphere, our goal should be to weaken the influ-
ence of the Cuban regima and its propaganda, to encourage solid-
“arity within the OAS family, ‘to counter Cuban influence in key

a (youth, lebor, intellectuals), to encourage actions that

counteract Cuban programs of subversion and insurrection,
To picture Cuba

In carrying out the kind of many-sided offensive loess herein,
it wil ba necessary to provide for coordinating ps programs. We

* aust be sure that what we do in one area reinforces what we do elsewhere.

It will be necessary to provide careful end reguler policy guidance to
those responsible for action. This task 1s assigned to tha Coordinator
for Cuban Affairs. He should establish the necessary machinery on an
inter~departmental basis.

U.S. Posture toward Cuba . é
Tae eda we should seek to create is one of a confident _ de-

cisive United States moving forward in cooperation with its other fftends,
Gesling with the Cuben situation but not exclusively preoccupied with
Castro, We should not appear to be in doubt or confusion. We should take
note of developments in Cuba promptly and react. to then quickly, Our
answer to claims, charges or attacks should be ewift. Our machinery mst
be geared*to permit answers to Castro and his henchnen imediately and
effectively. If he makes a speech tonight, our reply should be on the
airwaves tomorrow at the latest.

Cur approach should not be defensive. We should not confine ourselve
to cnuswering Castro but as much as possible force him onto the defensive.
Ws should insure that he is required to do thea answering, the explaining,
the disagreeing 2s much as possible.

the seriougness of the problem and our determination to support the cause
of freedom in Cuba with all feasible means.

The Coordinator should arrange for preparation of such a statement
and submit a draft ti the White House. inn

2, It 4s our policy to seek elimination, or at least material re-

duction, of the Soviet military presence in Cuba. Efforts now underway

to achieve this end should be given a reasonable chance, If they fail

to produce the desired result within a reasonable time, we should be pra-
pared to nove forward slong other lites, ‘The Coordinator should develop

& preozsan to mast this contingency. Meanwhile, the continuing presence

of Sovie= forces should be descritcd as ‘an exacerbating influence in
East-West relations and a symbol of foreign domination and control in Cuba.

could be read as a fim pledge to come to the aid of anyone who moves
egsinst Castro, We should make clear, however, that we are prepered to
support and cooperate with any elements. who succeed in ending commmnist

dominance in Cuba and who are committed to establishing in Cuba a free

SUBJECT: Future Cuban Leadership

INTRODUCTION

Following is a proposal for the creation of an imaginary
Cuban leader. This proposal is presented primarily to fill gaps
existing in the present policy study. It will become obvious that
‘this proposal can be utilized ir! conjunction with current programs
as well as many of those programs proposed for the future. It
may be necessary to address this proposal or a similar proposal
separately and in advance of the policy study; however, in the
event no pressing requirement exists, it is suggested that this
proposal be considered in conjunction with the policy study and
handled on a closely held basis.

REASON FOR PROPOSAL

. Following are listed a number of indications that the lead
ship question will be addressed in the near future:

a, With the termination of U.S. support to the Cuban
Revolutionary Council (CRC) a vacuum has been created. Various
exile groups in the U.S. and elsewhere will be vying for recognition
and support in an attempt to fill thie void.

b. There has. been constant pressure on the U.S.
and on other Latin American countries to recognize a government
in exile. This proposal could serve to lessen or eliminate much
of thie political and psychological pressure.

¢. This proposal could serve to reduce the bickering
among exile groups and may serve to resolve some of the problems
of Cuban exile unification.

ee SCRE

a, The proposal could emphasize the development of
a native "David" in opposition to Castro, the Cuban "Goliath," This
could serve the U.S. image by making Castro the "Goliath" rather
than the "David"' who opposes the North American Giant. "

e, Thies proposal could serve to prevent the U.S. from
making premature commitments to a leader or a particular exile group
and could be used as a device to test exile response.

f. This proposal could retain for the U.S. the ability
to control future selections of leaders or groups (timing and political
ideologies). a
g. This proposal could permit the U.S, on a progres-
sive basis to influence the idealogies of the resistance and thus to
influence the platform of a future Cuban Government. 5
‘

h. The publicity associated with the prolonged existence
of a resistance in Cuba can serve to delay the furtherance of the de
facto recognition of the present Cuban Regime. ;

OBJECTIVE

To create an imaginary leader or image of resistance in Cuba.
‘This image would serve as a focal point for resistance directed against
Castro by Cubans or Latin Americans.

DEVELOPMENT

. An imaginary name of a resistance leader could be developed
utilizing a popular name from Cuban history, a name associated with
resistance in Cuba or a newly devised name. The name selected
should typify a person who is friendly to the Cuban people, is anti-
communist, is willing to fight against the Regime, and ia little-but
tough. There is no requirement for a detailed staff study in order


13-00000

$OF SEERET soasstve

to determine this name. "The Little Bull," "The Little Worm,"

“The Friendly Worm," "The Fighting Friend," "The Tough Peasant,"
or any such name which is acceptable and meaningful in Spanish

could suffice. Over a period of several months the name could be
"dropped" or leaked through U.S. officialdom, in diplomatic channels,
in intelligence channels or within the Cuban exile community. Specific
acts against the Regime could be credited to this.individual or mem-
bers of his group. Communicationa could be.arranged between this
individual and hie subordinates to be picked up either by Castro's
censors or by. radio intercept in Cuba or in the U.S.

After a ‘period of time, all unexplained incidents and actions
for which credit hae not been seized by some other exile group would
automatically be ascribed to our imaginary friend. At some point in
time it could be leaked that the U.S, is, in fact, supporting this
imaginary person. Similarly, other Latin American countries may,
without inducement, publicly follow the U.S. pattern.

During the course of this operation it is quite possible that the
Castro Regime could indicate that the activities of this individual were
terminated, that the individual was captured, that he was being pur-
sued, or that he was an imaginary faker or fraud. Such action would
only serve to further publicize the actions of the individual and so long
as resistance in general continued the fame of our "Cuban Kilroy"
would spread. Humorous antics could be credited to our imaginary
friend and rumors of hie exploits of bravery (ala Zoro) could be
circulated.

At some point in time it may be wise to indicate what this
individual stands for. (it will become obvicus that he is opposed to
the Regime in Cuba.) It could be possible to indicate little-by-little
his political platform in very general terms -- realizing that the
mistique and the "generalness" connected with his operation is, in
fact, the power behind the operation. Ultimately, Cubans and others
may demand that he proclaim his complete political views or even
that he present himself physically. Since this is not desirable,

arrangements could be made to have selected individuals meet
with his appointed representative. His instructions and words
could be relayed to the public by many means,

As his political platform becomes more apparent within
the exile groups, it may be possible to determine those willing to
follow his leadership (to gain Cuban independence under hie terms)
or those who are unwilling to accept his leadership. The lines of
controversy among exiles can be drawn more clearly. Undesirable
leaders and exile groups can be eliminated from the competition
through his disavowals.

Eventually, a member of the resistance in Cuba may gain
sufficient stature to assume or to be given the title of this imaginary
leader. This, of course, will depend in large measure on individual
leadership ability and the ability to "fill the boots" of this anti-Castro
image.

While this scheme is replete with gimmickery, its imple-
mentation could be undertaken in a relatively ehort period of time.
Sensitivity of this scheme is such that the knowledge should be held
on the tightest basis and if implemented, those proposing should
not be informed. In the event the scheme is compromised, (unle
knowledge is widespread) there is little need for plausible deniability;
however, once used and compromised the scheme can hardly be
reinstated. A major advantage is that this image can be created
over a long period of time or developed rapidly. without a political
or economic commitment on the part ofthe U.S. There may be a
point at which the U.S, could no longer disavow collaboration with
thie imaginary person, This point, however, is so distant that
during any point in the intervening period it would be possible for
the U.S. to disengage easily without suffering embarrassment or
loss of prestige.

CONCLUSION

Based on a consideration of factore indicated above, it
appears that the U.S. should immediately undertake to implement
this proposal, determining at 30 to 60 day future intervals what
additional action should be taken to improve, reduce, or change
the image during the subsequent 30 or 60 day period,
