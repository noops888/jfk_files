to Saigon, MC CONE was called over by PRESIDENT KENNEDY and met privately with PRESIDENT

S KENNEDY and the Attorney General, ROBERT F. KENNEDY, and took the position that the CIA

“should take a hands off position as far as the assassination of DIEM was concerned. MC CONE

felt that the President agreed with my position, despite the fact that he had great reser-

advised him of our meeting with GENERAL WEEDE, of TAYLOR's cable, and of the decisions which
RICHARDSON had made as a result of the TAYLOR cable. LODGE was angry and expressed the view
that RICHARDSON's decision had destroyed the possibilities of carrying, out a coup. RICHARDSON

OCCURRENCE:

The I.G. REPORT of 1967 (CIA) contains the following, description of the events of August 25,
1963, from a book by MARGUERITE HIGGINS: "The crucial act, with its overtones of Greek
tramedy, opened with a cable. It was dispatched to Saigon late in the evenine: of August 24,
1963, a date made more sipmificant because it was a Saturday. Washinton usually-empties on
summer weekends or lapses into a somnolent mood as officials desperately seek relaxation.

"The telegram contained spectacular new instructions for the U.S. EMBASSY in SAIGON.
It was drawn up at a meeting called by Under-secretary of State AVERELL HARRIMAN and ROGER
HILSMAN, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs and head of the Vietnam task
force. The President's senior advisers were, for the most part, out of town. CIA DIRECTOR
JOHN MeCONE was in California. DEFENSE SECRETARY ROBERT MCNAMARA was on vacation. (con't)

CCURRENCE?

Higgins states that the Xa Loi pagoda, based on her off riences, was more a political
command post than a holy place. It was the headquarters, tom which the militant fi

Thich Tri Quang and others had run their political war against the Diem regime.

According to Higgins, Thich Tri Quang told an Austrian journalist by the name of

Denis Warner early in August that he hoped in the process "they would kill one or two

of us.” :

Higgins goes on to note that the State Department regarded the actions against a dozen
pagodas a betrayal of Diem's promise to reconciliate the Buddhists. (Page 181)

Higgins claims that "...the raids by the Vietnamese Army and the pagodas took place
five days after the departure of Ambassador Milting from Saigon, and a week before Henry
Cabot Lodge was expected to arrive on his first tour of duty in Viet Nam." Higgins goes
on to explain that Diem claimed that the reason that the raids were performed at this
time was because: "It had become clear that Thich Tri Quang of Buddhist was that no
intention of coming to any agreement with the government, irrespective of how many
consessions were made. Since the raids would create an anti-Diem propaganda explosion,
it would be less; emparyassingto the United States if they took mYage when the new

OCCURRENCE? Diem on May 6, 1963 revived a regulation banning the public display of any

religious flag--either the Buddhist or Catholic-- having any precedence over the National
Vietnamese flag in public places or in public view. Higgins does not doubt that the
Vietnamese government's decision to revive these flag regulations on May 6, 1963 made
possible the Hue tragedy. Ironically, action by Diem has been generally viewed as anti-
Buddhist. His May 6 circular had been provoked a few days earlier in Da Nang by the
excessive use by Catholics of the flag of the vatican with the Nati Vietnamese flag
on view being sometimes tattered and torn and few in number. (91,

—OCCURR: :

OCCURRENCE? CONEIN stated that the catalyst that brought down the DIEM regime was their
antagonism of the Buddhists. He explained that 80% of the Vietnamese people claimed to be
Buddhists. And that DIEM led a Catholic regime and that this drove people, particularly in.
light of MADAME NHU's statements to the effect that she'd like to furnish some mustard at

a bonzes barbecue, or something to that effect. This made people want to identify themselve:

against the regime and so they would go back to the pagodas. CONEIN did not know whether or
not this became the principal reason for the United States wanting to get rid of the regime.

OCCURRENCE:  Mecklin stated that the American position following the incident at Hue
was to "urge Diem to repair all Buddhist grievances forthwith, to accept responsibilit
for the May 8 killings, and to indemnify the victims and apologize, perhaps by Visiting
Hue himself to do so.'' (Ambassador Nolting was on a Meditterranean vaction at the time.)

. "According to Mecklin, William Trueheart, the Charge d'Affaires, applied on orders from
Washington, 'direct,relentless, tablehammering pressure on Diem such as the United States
had seldom before attempted with a sovereign friendly government...' In despair Trueheart
in June resorted to a formal warning to Diem that if he continued repressive measures
(police effort to prevent and disperse illegal demonstrations), the,Unifed States would
be forced to disassociate itself publicly from such actions, ie fwe did two months

by making them become a political entity which they had never been before. CONEIN stated
that it had become obvious to people in the State Department, USAIB and JMSPAU, as well

as persons within the CIA and the country team generally, that the true power of the govern-
ment at that time was not DIEM but rather NHU and CAN, as well as MADAME NHU, the chief of

OCCURRENCE:

Nguyen. Van Bang later at the trial of Maj on Sy said that "While we
were inside, two loud explosions ‘suddenly reverberated. on the veranda. Then came the
sounds of broken glass, gunshots, and: exploding hand grenades."" In the confusion Major
Dang Sy heard the explosions also and in attempting to signal what he feared may be a
Viet Cong attack fired three shots in the air. Unfortunately this was the prearranged
signal authorizing his troops to’ use grenades to disperse the crowds.. At least 15 of
these grenades were throw and the explosions caused at least 8 dead at the radio station.
(95) This statement though, appears to be in conflict with later medical evidence coming
from the Interior Minister which ‘found that. none of the bodies of the dead had metal
splinters in their organs, but rather the weapons expert said that the bombs were probably
made of plastic and that "plastic is the arm of the Viet Cong guerilla." (95- 96)

OCCURRENCE: According to Higgins on May 8, 1963 on tl Sddhist birthday Thich Tri
Quang, in the middle of a religious ceremony, began to give a vitriolic anti-government
speech on the subject of the non-existent ban on Buddhist flags. About 8 pm Thich Tri
Quang arrived at the radio station carrying in his hands a tape recording which he then
made the demand upon the director of the station to play. He was refused. Thich Tri
Quang proceeded to encourage an already active angry crowd which in the middle of this
oration began to shout and press forward. The director of the station called up Nguyen
Van Bang who soon arrived and attempted to appease Thich Tri Quang, but the latter would
not listen. Nguyen Van Bang then asked for armored cars im hopes that this would
fighten the crowd and prevent any violence to the radio station. Major Dang Sy
then arrived with some armored cars and got some general orders to disperse the crowd.
Police arrived and attempted to turn fire hoses on the crowd. (93-94)

OCCURRENCE: "No evidence can be adduced showing that before the Hue incident of

May 8, 1963, there was a religious issue in Vietnam. If there had been, assuredly

the critics of Diem's leadership would have trumpeted it to the world. Complaints of
alleged religious repression made by Thich Tri Quant and his accomplices in a campaign

of letters to the United Nations and prominent foreigners , had begun, but they represented
no more than the early activity of determined propagandists.

“Most hostile criticism toward Diem centered not on what he did but on his methods and
techniques of governing."

far from free and many of the devices used to stimulate popular support for the regime
bore the the familiar stamp of modern totalitarian practice. No doubt these moves could
be justified, at least to some extent, in terms of the overwhelming problems confronting
Dien during his first few years in office and also the inexperience of Free Viet Nam's
people with the forms and substance of democracy, but...Diem had still to prove that his
professed devotion to the democratic cause represented anything more than a facade to
disguise increasingly plain reality of stern dictatorship.” (164-165)

staff meeting and shocked them by telling them that he knew of some coup planning going on

OCCURRENCE:

Higgins notes that. Kennedy dispatched Krulik and Mendenhall to Viet Nam to make a tour of
the country to determine the effect of the Buddhist crisis on the war against the Viet
Cong. Returning to Washington, Krulik and Mendenhall each gave a different report on the
effect. Higgins notes that Kennedy asked wryly, "Have you two fellows been in the same
country?" Higgins goes on to note that this was indeed indicative of the American reac~
tion to Vietnam generally. Krulik, Higgins points.out, visited the theatre of war by go-
ing to all core areas as well as six divisional and some twenty-five regimental and bat-—
talion headquarters. But Mendenhall saw the theatre of the political intrigue, i.e.,
Hue in Saigon. These latter two areas was the only Viet Nam that Americans knew during
that time, and it was the slightly Effett, volital society fon the haven of Viet
Nam's chronically critical and bickering intellectualg. (Page's log 5

COCURRENCE? COLBY stated that the United States sought to pub pressure on President DIEM
and the government, particularly to remove NC? DINH NHU from the country, to bring about cer-
tain changes of policy in August of 1963 that was thought necessary to improve the perfor-
mance of the government of South Vietnam. Among these were the suspension of Public Law
480 aid the suspension of the commodity inport.program. And also through various contacts
with dissident generals, the United States was requested whether it would-stand aside if
the generals ran thelr own. coup, and they were given the response in general terms that,
“Yes, we would stand aside, and yes, we would continue the aid program if! a successor gov-
ernment took over and looked reasonably able to carry on the war.’ This can only be read as
a green light to the generals, This message was passed through a CIA officer, but his cre-
ditentials were checked by the generals receiving this kind of a message, with the Ambassador
and with the Chief of the Military Aid group in Saigon so. that there was _no question
SOURCE? about what U.S. policy was, nor that the CI! office
was speaking for the Ambassador with his knowledge

SECUBRENCE? COLBY testified that during August, 1973 between the change of ambassadors
from NOLTING to LODGE, that the government of South Vietnam took that period and raided
Buddists pagadas and essentially sought to surpress the Buddihist dissidence. COLBY stated
that DIEM went out and supressed this kind of active dissidence, justifying. it in his mind
and publicly as not accepting this kind of dissidence during a wartime situation, which that
country was faced with. COLBY claimed that this suppression only served to adversely affect
DIEM's image here in. the United States and intensify the feeling of dissent within the educa-
ted class in Saigon and in the cities, weakened himself, rather than strengthen himself.

OCCURRENCE: Higgins asked Diem ‘in an interview on August 7, 1963 whether Diem thought
the United States was plotting against him. Diem replied: ''I do not think Ambassador
Nolting is plotting against me. I do not think Richardson /of the CIA7 is plotting
against me. I know there are American officials who are preparing the way in the event
the decision is taken to try and get rid of me. I cannot forsee the future. And I
cannot believe that America would turn against an ally under attack, engaged in a struggle |
for its very existence. But some people are crazy--and the world is crazy. Still,
Miss Higgins, I hope that your government will take a realistic look at these young
generals plotting to take my place. How much maturity or political understanding do
they have--of their own country, let alone the world?" (169)

On August 26, 1963, in a CIA document entitled "ONE Start Memorandum, No. 60-63, Internal ONE
Sorking Paper, CIA Distribution Only," the following statement appears:

‘On balance, we believe the best hope for the preservation of US interests and attainment

of US objectives in South Vietnam lies in the possibility of a coup d'etat by anti-Conmunist
rationalists with sufficient military support to obviate prolonged civil war. Such a froup
nicht net prove able to salvage the situation and, indeed, might eventually prove no better
shan the present repime. Such a development would, however, enable the US and anti-Communist
iationalist elements to make a fresh start unencumbered and unhampered by political errors of
vast years, months, and weeks. In such a fresh Start, we believe, lies the only viable hope
“or the attainment of US interests and objectives in South Vietnam." (8)

were going to pull the coup and one general didn't like the other general. The best way I
ean describe it, if you had three Vietnamese generals sitting and talking to you, one genera!
would talk, walk out of the room to go to the "john", two would tell you, don't trust that
one, and finally the one who had out-waited the other two, there would be one left, and he

In a CIA cable from Saigon (SAIG 0523) ,/the I.G. REPORT provides the following summary:

"RICHARDSON cabled a damage assessment. He coneluded that DIEM and the NIU's are fully aware
that the USG encouraged the GENERALS to attempt a coup and that CIA was the instrumentality of
this encouragement. He judged there was an even possibility that all major programs could
mo forward as in the past. Me listed as a major dilemma the Stations future relationships with
COL. TUNG. He noted his dissatisfaction with TUNG as a SVN liaison vehicle through which to
conduct PM programs, but noted that the GVN had offered no alternative. Unless we were willing
to discontinue our NVN, Laos border, and cross-border programs, we must continue to work with
TUNG. {NOTE: PM programs = paramilitary programs)
"The Tunes of Vietnam published charges that the CIA was plotting and financing a couy:
and was giving asylum to the chief anti-DIEM Buddhist leader. The story was picked up and widely
olaved by the New York Daily News, the Chicago Tribune, Baltimore Sun, and other prominent

that he believed that we should move ‘cautiosly, that we should talk seriously to Diem
and that Todge should be urged to visit the countryside to obtain a more realistic
view of the effects of suspending aid. Mr. McCone a}so suggested that another approach
be made to NHutto seek his cooperation ina departure. The President asked whether we
had carefully studied the detail effects of cuts in aid.(as proposed in a paper prepared
by Hillsman). It was evident that the effects had not been studies. The President
asked DOD and CIA to analyze the Hillsiwan paper. He also asked that a telegram be sent
to Lodge asking him to try to reduce the press leakage from Saigon and to establish some

URRENCE: DINH's desire to become a Minister was greater than his allegiance to rres
DIEM. He became the actual key to the success of the coup. His facile, and at times
brilliant mind, was used to the general's advantage in that GENERAL DINH convineed President

DIEM that he, General DINH, along with COLONEL TUNG, should be given blanket orders to be
a counter-coup force. “DINK also convinced TUNG to move four of his principal airborne com
panies on a bootless operation outside of Saigon on 29 and 30 October, so that these troops
would not be present on 1 November. DINH is the Minister of Security in the provisional

government. p. 13

opinion of CIA with the exception of Colby, Chief Fareast Division, that fiddling with
the commodity import program as a political lever would be much more likely to create
an economic crisis undermining the war effort than to scare Diem and Nhu into a more
cooperative attitude, because it would seriously affect the confidence and planning
of the Vietnamese business community and quickly engender inflationary measures at
large of a more serious nature. It was the concensus of the meeting that some reaningful
political movements had to be made but exactly what they should be was not determined.

the cut in aid was deliberately planned to spur the generals on, but if so, that
intention did not find its way into the record. ‘Ihe nearest thing to it is in the
record of a presidential, meeting of 10 September 1963. The President asked

Rufus Phillips of AID what specific actions Phillips recommended and he suggested
“eutting aid to Colonel Tung which would be viewed by the generals with much

CCURRENCE:

COLBY states that "When CONEIN was told by the generals, GENERAL MINH,

that the NHU brothers, DIEM and NHU, had committed suicide, CONEIN thought it incredible

on its face. This was because both brothers were very strong Catholics and CONEIN doubted
that they would have done such a thing. According to COLBY, CONEIN was offered a chance

to look at the bodies but turned it down, In trying to reconstruct the period of the assass-
ination on November 1, COLBY reports that there was a telephone conversation between Presi-
dent DIEM and the generals. In fact there were several of them. President DIEM was very
strongly rejecting the generals, calling them to discipline, and so forth, in the early
stages. At a later stage, in the early morning of November 1, he called and indicated that
he would surrender if he would be properly handled. The generals then sent somebody down to
veceive that surrender and found that President DIEM was not there. He'd actually gotten
out through the back door of the palace and had gone down to another section of the city.

following statement: ‘"The first cable (on the coup) was received at headquarters at 0117

At 0256 hours, following receipt of the sixth non-CRITIC cable, headquarters instructed the
STATION to put the coup reporting on the CRITIC network at the STATION. Sometime during the
day of 1 November (the confirmation copy of the cable lacks a date/time stamp) headquarters
cabled a waming to the STATION against including the names of CIA personnel in ‘its CRITIC

seven of which were put into the CRITIC channel, without the name being deleted, here at

In retrospect, one must realize that there was, however, considerable debate about encoura;

very clear that the United States through itsoverall policy was in support of that overthr:
and, of course, I think it is fair to say that in launching a violent overthrow of a re~

same date by CIA cable from Saigon (SAIG 2063): "........do not think we have the
power to delay or discourage a coup. DON has made it clear many times that this is
a Vietnamese affair......I believe we should continue our present position of keeping
hands off but continue to monitor and press for more detailed information. CAS has
been anaylzing forces for some time and it is their estimate that the generals have
probably figured their chances pretty closely.......It does not seem sensible to have
the military in charge of matter which is so profoundly political as a change of govern-
ment....AS to requests from the generals, they may well have need of funds at the last
moment with which to buy off potential opposition. ‘To the extent that these funds can be
passed discreetly, I believe we should furnish them....If we were convinced that the coup
was going to fall, we would of course do everything we could to stop it. HARKINS has read

message that only conviction of certain failure justifies intervention....U.S. authorities
will reject appeals for direct intervention from either side.... " ( the IG Report here
states without further showing the author of the above message that "the White House re-
peats its instructions on command of the country team after LODGE leaves." The inference

tunnel took them under and through the palace and the half block to City Hall.

MAJOR DANG SY |

| ot
At the trial of Dang Sy by the Khanh regime that; eded that of the

coup leaders temporary or provisional government, Khanh's,piros 6r insisted that the
deaths had been .caused-by American-supplied grenades at thestype known as MKIII whose

use had been ordered by Dang Sy, and the convictionsb Sthéesmilitary court was that the 8
deaths were caused by these concussion grenades. AG, gins argues in her book that this
conviction is contrary to the Pentagon's assessmerié Of the MKIII grenade which fowid that
at worst the effects of such a grenade are non-fatal. Nor does such a grenade have suffi-
cient force to decapitate or mutilate persons, let. alone bring down the ceilings, doors,
and windows that were adjacent to the veranda of the radio station. (95-96) Higgins also
states that: ‘The conviction of Major Dang Sy certainly throws no light on the matter
one way or another. The trial was clearly rigged from the start." (96-97)

als, but only as approved and under instructions. (¢) A CIA officer, CONEIN, was at the
generals' command post throughout the fighting. (d) CONEIN furmmished. GENERAL DON about
