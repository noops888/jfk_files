McCone and Colby the record by Colby reflects that

McNamarra pointed out that

Lodge has little contact with Diem and has not been out of Saigon.

Mr. McCone commented

that he belleved that we should move cautiasly, that we should talk seriously to Diem

gand that Lodge should be urged to visit the countryside to obtain a more realistic

"view of the effects of suspending aid. Mr. McCone also suggested that another approach

*be made to Nhu to seek his cooperation ina departure.

The President asked whether we

had carefully studied the detail effects of cuts in aid (as proposed in a paper prepared

by Hillsman). It was evident that the effects had not been studies.

The President

asked DOD and CIA to analyze the Hillsman paper.

He also asked that a telegram be sent

to Lodge asking him to try to reduce the press leakage from Saigon and to establish some

real contact with Diem.

Any current plans for aid negotiation should be stalled, and the

Presidenburcispuld be well informed of any steps taken in this contes raffsuch as the

instance involving CIA payment to Col Tung last week.

OCCURRENCE:

The I.G. REPORT of 1967 (CIA) contains the following, description of the events of August 25,

1963, from a book by MARGUERIIE HIGGINS:

"The crucial act, with its overtones of Greek

tragedy, opened with a cable. It was dispatched to saigon late in the evening of Aurust 24,

1963, a date made more significant because it was a Saturday. Washington usually empties on

summer weekends or lapses into a somnolent mood as officials desperately seek relaxation.

"The telegram contained spectacular new instructions for the U.S. EMBASSY in SAIGON.

It was drawn up at a meeting, called by Under-secretary of State AVERELL HARRIMAN and ROGER

HILSMAN, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs and head of the Vietnam task

force.

The President's senior advisers were, for the most part, out of town. CIA DIRECIOR

JOHN MCCONE was in California. DEFENSE SECRETARY ROBERT MCNAMARA was on vacation. (con't)

OCCURRENCE:

Diem on May 6, 1963 revived a regulation banning the public display of any

religious flag--either the Buddhist or Catholic - having any precedence over the National

Vietnamese flag in public places or in public view.

Higgins does not doubt that the

Vietnamese government's decision to revive these flag regulations on May 6, 1963 made

possible the Hue tragedy. Ironically, action by Diem has been generally viewed as anti-

Buddhist. His May 6 circular had been provoked a few days earlier in Da Nang by the

excessive use by Catholics of the flag of the vatican with the National Vietnamese flag

on view being sometimes tattered

and torn and few in number. (91)

OCCURRENCE: CONEIN stated that the attacks in May in Hue followed up by an attack in Augus

on the pagodas in Saigon consolidated the three or four different sects of the Buddhists

by making them become a political entity which they had never been before. CONEIN stated

that it had become obvious to people in the State Department, USAID and JASPAU, as well

as persons within the CIA and the country team generally, that the true power of the govern-

ment at that time was not DIEM but rather NHU and CAN, as well as MADAME NHU, the chief of

the womens' solidarity movement. DIEM was felt to be out of touch with reality and not get-

ting the true facts as everything was being channeled through his brother, NHU. pp. 44-45

Diem during his first few years in office and also the inexperience of Free Viet Nam's

COLBY stated

that DIEM went out and supressed this kind of active dissidence, justifying it in his mind

and publicly as not accepting this kind of dissidence during a wartime situation, which that

COLBY claimed that this suppression only served to adversely affect

DIEM's image here in the United States and intensify the feeling of dissent within the educa-

On 10 September 1963 in a cable from the CIA station in Siagon (SAIG0760) to

Washington, the following quotation appears: "Am inclined to feel general officers

will seek evolutionary accomodation with Diem, (if he permits them to do so)

Is breakdown of civil order or of governmental machinery, or unless war effort

begins to go backward seriously (despite danages suffered since 8 May and 21 August

in military and civil sections) do not align myself with the view that USG should

OCCURRENCE:

On 5 October there was a Presidential meeting on Vietnam.

The only CIA participant was

McCone. He provided the following record. The meeting was held to discuss matters that

became the subject of DEPTEL, 5/34 (See later entry of 5 October.) DCI said it was the

opinion of CIA with the exception of Colby, Chief Fareast Division, that fiddling with

the cormodity import program as a political lever would be much more likely to create

an econonic crisis undermining the war effort than to scare Diem and Nhu Into a more

coperative attitude, because it would seriously affect the confidence and planning

large of a more serious nature.

It was the concensus of the meeting that some meaningful

political movements had to be made but exactly what they should be was not determined.

FOR CCCRET

On October 5, 1963 In a CIA Cable from Saigon (SAIG1445) it was stated that the

meeting with Conein (approved by Ambassador in October) General Minh requested a

statement of the U.S. Position with respect to a change in the GVN in the near future.

He said he did not expect U.S.G. support of a coup effort but did need USG assurances

that USG would not try to thwart his plans.

He outlined three possible plans for the

i ent to meet a assassinattonof Ngo Din Nhu and Ngo

keeping President Diem in office; (b) encirelement of Saigon by various

military units; and (c) direct confrontation between military units Involved in the

coup and loyalist military undts.

eussion had nothing to do with assassinations.

this was whether we should let the coup go

If use our influences not to.

Then interestingly enough, the President sent a series of mes-

gages to CABOT LODGE urging that he'd do all that he could to get DIEM to change his ways.

CABOT LODGE's first attempt failed and then he was called - CABOT LODGE was called by DIEM's

Office and DIEM said, you tell the President to tell me what he wants me to do and I'll do

it. Unfortunately, the forces were surrounding the palace at that very moment and the coup

was on. It was a kind of a dramatic little part of the history of that tragedy.!

OCCURRENCE: COLBY testified as to the events surrounding the cable from Saigon of 5 Octo-

ber 1963 which reads as follows: "We do not set ourselves irrevocably against the assass-

ination plot since the other two alternatives mean either a blood bath in Saigon, or a pro-

tracted struggle which could rip the army and the country asunder." And the response on

6 October 1963 which COLBY wrote for MC CONE as follows:

"MC CONE directs that you withdraw

recommendation to Ambassador concerning assassination plan under MC CONE instructions as we

cannot be in a position to actively condone such course of action thereby endangering our

our responsibility, therefore COLBY explained that this second message he drafted was to

eliminate assassination as an alternative. COLBY stated that the assassination of DIEM's

other brothers NHU and KAHN, NGO DINH KAHN, were to continue. A reply was sent on October 7

from Saigon in response to the MC CONE cable saying that action was taken as directed, mean-

ing that the Ambassador had been so informed to withdraw the recommendation."

SPECIAL GROUP

OCCURRENCE:

On October 8, 1963 at a special group meeting the DCI expressed concern that there

was a lack of intelligence coverage during the period when "the U.s.

was maintaining

a posture of almost no official contact at top levels." They refer to the fact

that NHU and DIEM are not being contacted by Americans. Mr. MCCONE also referred

to "theorientation of (Saigon) station functions." Mr. BUNDY pointed out that "for

Americans to resume top level contacts at this time would appear to represent

a political rapprochement. Ambassador LODGE might feel that this was running

counter to his policy."

The Group gave its approval to the basis realignment of

station functions. (The nature of such functions are not outlined.)

OCCURRENCE:

On 8 September 1963, the CIA IG report reflects in a conment that the U.s.

government publicly confirmed on Oct. 8, 1963 that aid had alraady been cut

quitely and over a period of some months. Bill Colby,

Jock Anderson and Dave Snith

told us that the public announcement of the aid reduction was a signal to the

general

and that the reduction was planned with that in mind. It may be that

the cut in aid was deliberately planned to spur the generals on, but if so, that

intention did not find its way into the record.

The nearest thing to it is

in the

record of a presidential meeting of 10 september 1963.

The President asked

Rufus Phillips of AID what specific actions Phillips recemended and he suggested

"cutting aid to Colonel Tung which would be viewed by the generals with much

enthusiasm as an Indication of virgouous of American position.

" In general,

ald cuts were discussed in terns of bring pressure on Diem to make needed changes in

his resuorce? ever planned, or hewever leokea-upon by the dos commiscation, it Is

clear that-

the Vietnamese considered the official confirmation of ald ballas a clear

token of their support of coup planning.

OCCURRENCE: On November 1, 1963, "CONEIN went to JGS headquarters and remained at the

command post throughout the struggle. Before leaving his home, CONEIN alerted the STATION

by radio. Upon arriving at JGS headquarters, CONEIN was told by GENERAL DON that DON had

tried unsuccessfully to reach CONEIN earlier by telephone. A later check revealed that

CONEIN's telephone was out of order. CONEIN was told that he was to keep a telephone line

open to the Ambassador. Because there was a CIA officer on the scene and in intimate con-

tact with the coup principals, the STATION was able to report almost minute-by-minute progres:

of the coup."

OCCURRENCE:

COLBY states that "When CONEIN was told by the generals, GENERAL MINA,

that the NHU brothers, DIEM and NHU, had committed suicide, CONEIN thought it incredible

on its face. This was because both brothers were very strong Catholics and CONEIN doubted.

that they would have done such a thing. According to COLBY, CONEIN was offered a chance

to look at the bodies but turned it down. In trying to reconstruct the period of the assass-

ination on November 1, COLBY reports that there was a telephone conversation between Presi-

dent DIEM and the generals. In fact there were several of them. President DIEM was very

strongly rejecting the generals, calling them to discipline, and so forth, in the early

stages. At a later stage, in the early morning of November 1, he called and indicated that

he would surrender if he would be properly handled. The generals then sent somebody down to

receive that surrender and found that President DIEM was not there. He'd actually gotten

out through the back door of the palace and had gone down to another section of the city.

SOURCE: CONEIN was not in attendance.

OCCURRENCE:

The IG Report makes the following statement: "The fact that CONEIN was at

JGS headquarters is well known in official circles"

, and bolsters

that notoriety by the

following statement:

'"The first cable (on the coup) was received at headquarters at 0117

hours,

(November 1, 1963,) Washington time, and was filed on the CRITIC network at 0159.

At 0256 hours, following receipt of the sixth non-CRITIC cable, headquarters instructed the

STATION to put the coup reporting on the CRITIC network at the

STATION. Sometime during the

day of I November (the confirmation copy of the cable lacks a date/time stamp) headquarters

cabled a warning to the STATION against including the names of CIA personnel in Its CRITIC

cables. CONEIN is identified by and as being at JGS headquarters in eleven CRITIC messages,

seven of which were put into the CRITIC channel, without the name being deleted, here at

headquarters."

OCCURRENCE: COLBY stated that "Ihe CIA had nothing to do with the assassination of Pres-

ident DIEM and Mr. NHU. The actual assassination was a shock and surprise to everyone in

ihe United States goverment and when it was announced it was a matter of grave concern.

In retrospect, one must realize that there was, however, considerable debate about encoura

ing and supporting the generals in an overthrow of the DIEM regime, and that the record is

very clear that the United States through itsoverall policy was in support of that overthr

and, of course, I think it is fair to say that in launching a violent overthrow of a

re-

gime involved such as this, people are going to get hurt, and in this case, the leaders we:

killed in the process."

certain time in order to alert American personnel who might be living around the area to

There were no American casualities during this coup. The Vietnamese suffered about 100

same date by CIA cable from Saigon (SAIG 2063) : "

........do not think we have the

power to delay or discourage a coup. DON has made it clear many times that this is

a Vietnamese affair......I believe we should continue our present position of keeping

hands off but continue to monitor and press for more detailed information.

CAS has

been anaylzing forces for some time and it is their estimate that the generals have

probably figured their chances pretty closely.......It does not seem sensible to have

the military in charge of matter which is so profoundly political as a change of govern-

ment....As to requests from the generals, they may well have need of funds at the last

was going to fail, we would of course do everything we could to stop It. HARKINS has read

OCCURRENCE: On October 30, 1963, in a CIA cable to Saigon (DIR 79407) the following

quotation appeared: "....We do not accept as a basis for U.S, policy that we have no power

to delay or discourage coup....We cannot limit ourselves to proposition implied in your

message that only conviction of certain failure justifies intervention....U.S. authorities

will reject appeals for direct intervention from either side....

" ( the IG Report here

states without further showing the author of the above message that "the White House re-

peats its instructions on command of the country team after LODGE leaves."

The inference

can probably be drawn that the message although looked upon as a CIA cable to Saigon, it

was indoubtedly emanating from the White House.)

The Attorney General

that even a successful coup would create a period of interregmum, confusion which might

OCCURRENCE: CONEIN stated that around 6:30 or 6:40 on November 2, 1963, DIEM talked

to MINH for the first time.

DIEM asked MINH for full honors and MINH replied that he could

not guarantee full honors, if and during the time that Vietamese were still killing one

another. DIEM stated that he would order the cease fire at the palace and CONEIN recalls

that this took place at about 7:50, November 2, 1963. CONEIN stated as follows: "At this

stage, there were four armored cars and 113's an escort of military police proceeded imme-

diately from the joint general staff headquarters toward GAI LONG PALACE. BIG MINH with

his aide, CAPTAIN HUNG got into a sedan and with MIS Corps, went out the back road from

the general staff headquarters toward the back of the golf course and took a different road

from the armored cars that went down Cong Le."

OCCURRENCE:

At the trial of Dang Sy by the Khanh regime that

icceeded that of the

coup leaders temporary or provisional government, Khanh's prosecutor insisted that the

deaths had been caused-by American-supplied grenades af

use had been ordered by Dang Sy, and the conviction by the military court was that the 8

deaths were caused by these concussion grenades. Wiggins argues in her book that this

conviction is contrary to the Pentagon's assessment of the MKIII grenade which found that

at worst the effects of such a grenade are non-fatal. Nor does such a grenade have suffi-

cient force to decapitato or mutilate persons, Let alone bring down the coil a los also

states that: "The conviction of Major Dang Sy certainly throws no light on the matter

one way or another. The trial was clearly rigged from the start." (96-97)

als, but only as approved and under instructions.

. (c) A CIA officer, CONEIN, was at the

generals' command post throughout the fighting.
