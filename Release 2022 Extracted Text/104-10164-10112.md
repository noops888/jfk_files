to be aware of the identitiss of these. men, Furthermore,
according to an official of the US Embassy, at one tin
it appeared that Charles had originated the idea of the
junta, hoping to utilize it eventually to launch his own

to be placing some distance between himself and the pro-

During Charles’ sforementioned conversation with an

He conceives of his role in Haiti in grandiose, almost

MEWORANDUM FOR THE RECORD — i

SUBJECT: Letter from Louis A. Brun to FSO. Felder -

1. Y talked with George Musulin (DCS/Ops Support
Staff) at 0840 hours this morning about the. letter mailed
to FSO Felder at the American Embassy in Port au: Prince,
Musulin said that he had spoken with Brun absut the letter
and Brun had assured him that Felder suid to mail letters
to him through Foreign Service mail channels.:. Brun is in
contact with Felder during his visits to Haiti and. this
system was laid on between them during cne of his trips.

2. Brun also said that he:was a little upset about:
the problems which had arisen. in sending his. letter... Brun

said that he had received a letter from Felder (mai
New York City) saying that he had never received the.letter "
from Brun. Brun was concerned that the le. may shave -
fallen into the wrong hands in Haiti. Musulin.said thi
he would try to recover the letter and send -_ back to
Brun.

3. 1 told Mustilin that Ambassador Ross was very iauch
disturbed about this matter and that any. further involve-
ment by the Agency with correspondence between Brun and
Felder should be avoided. Brun is a business agent of

* Clemard Joseph-Charles and thus any correspondence between

Brun and an official of the American Embassy is of parti-
cular concern to the Ambassador ‘because of the obvious

- political implications. Musulin said he understood this

and would tell Brun that the dispatch of any correspondence

Dear.Mr. Brun... ¢

I apologize for the delay in responding to your

- Suggestion concerning the commercial bank in Haiti.
, My activities herc have been such that I have been

unable. until the past day or so to give your pro-

{ posal adequate thought and consideration.

‘st I must admit that the recent abortive invasion
attempt caused. ccrtain reflection and it is this
kind of. activity, successful or unsuccessful, that

culd cre co ser’ sus dislocations for those establis!
an business. i:wever I must assure you that this wa:
only a-refleccion and the reason that I will be unable.
te accer: your offer is the extent and nature of
activities here in Washington. -I believe Taliuded
to some of them during your visit. The occasions. when
I would find it possibl: to visit Port-au-Prince or to
deve’ any aienificant amount o? time to the bank's
actwitics nero would-be rare indeed. ‘1 shall. coniess
&o you that I declined a similar position on a bank
board here in the states for the. same reason,

' oy
I regret that this decision is neceasary but I hope
that ir future relationships we may be able.to; do

something Useful and ful in haiti. goles

Under those circumstances, Duvalier loosing his old grip on key.

elements comitted-te his support, a large portion ofswhich he has
recently liquidated, is trying to instore a new political philosophy ©
reaching out for elements of the middle cluss’a. wéll as those of the

aimed at antcgonizing the U.S, Government. for its hands-off policies ond
the economic aqueoze applied by the U.S, against his government. Tais

* , antagonicn will go as far on necossary cven.to an almost impossible al-

Ateance with communist countries such as Cuba or other communist nations

of Surope, Africa or Asia. As evidence of that direction in Duvalier's

. Governxont, he has allowed the so-called "Little Red Book" of Chatman

" Mao-Tee-Tung of Conmnist China to circulate freely in Haiti, wheroos

radically leftist oriented Government. If allowed tine, ouvalier may
weil cuccced to turn the country into a new communist satellite and vors e
out sone agreements with communist countries. Here acain, we should not
fail to mention the new exchange Cf diplomatic representations between
Haiti end some communist countries. The most sigizicant one is the new.
appointment in Haiti of an Acbassador from Poland with whoa,I vas told,
Duvalier is closely worxing with.

Taking everything into consideration:

1. The non existence of any organized opposition: in Nats;

2. The stave of ron cohesiveness and distrust erongst wie exiled
political elements abroad, therefore nullifying any positive action fron
outside Haiti;

3. The fear of local politicians that, if outside forces were to cone,
in, their safety and security vould be very much at stake, therevore they, |

should resist such intervention and do whatever is pecessary to prevent
it et all cost;

4, the fear of Duvalier's so-called followers that they nay be élininated
upon mere suspicion, ju.et or unjust denctieiations;

5. Tne middle and upper classes sentiment that the U.S, is not working

for the belief of a possible collusion by means of money or otherwise of —

It would be childish, however, to formulate an opinion only on the

basis of the rentioned facts, although on the surface, they apzear” 1 et ’
logical exough to confirm these conclusions. Hiei E ieee een
_T en’ convenced in my own mind, that when sone politicians close tof |

Duvalier will feel that their lives are in real dances, soze of thes
will successMlly attexpt to eliminate him even though they may not be,
thezselves, in a position to control the chaotic situation that vill ne=
cessorily follow. This -is where the real danger is. If any such un- Z
planned action was allowed to take place, the U.S. wiil then find itself
with a rel “hot potato”, requiring such drastic action sintlar to, those
takin in 1965 durfng the recent crisis in the Dominican Republic. Such
actions are not to se desired, not only because they are costly to the
fmerican taxpayers, but because they inevitably provoke strong dnti-
Americon feelings based on the opinion that the U.S. did novhing to help
bring about the collapse, but is merely there to impose its choice™and *
Gecisions against the will of the people. If the U.S. is to wait for the
OAS to decide on joint action in the eventuality of chaos, we are sfraid.
; that communist influence and even control of the situation by forces
based in Cuba and other countries, will make it mich more difficult: to
cope with within the context of our national security, It.is, therefore,
dmperative, in our opinion,.that the U.S. take some steps towards working
“with local politicians to take the initiative of o coup which, when per=
‘formed, would receive the strong backing of this country, militarily,
financially and othervise, to sccure an orderly succession of the present
regime, As far ae Haiti is concerned, I feel that I have. thu most. adequate
‘olution for the proposed ection. I feel that whenever the security of
this nation or any nation is concerned, there is no time for wait~and-sce
_@oneiderations. In the case of Haiti, in particular, where tho political
“@eene is really deprived of individuals of strong convictions, one way or
“the other, we feal that the U.S. should nof have any problem in finding
. Bomsonc that they can build’ politically and work with in o. cincora and
Loyal effort to help that. small nation rlve some of its perennial probleas.

In connection with the possibility of finding a yolitical Leader,
as indicated above, I rust say that J have becn in contact with a man
whos, I feel, could very wells! 1 the position. His noxe is Clérard
Joseph Caazles, President of Bn. :e Commerciale d'llaiti, President of
Haiti's Cnexber.of Commerce, a ixscctor of several other business and
industrial organizations in Haiti. :

I have xnown sir, Charles sinc 1951. \e have been friends and *
Dusiness associates eversince. To =e, Nx, Charles is a true and sincere
patriot. OF course, today, a number of people question his patriotiss ©
on the besis of his close cooperation with the Duvalier regime. I have
nyself, sonetimes, felt.that he went too far, I have also told him so,
many tines. His-answers on such occasions have, most of the iime, satisfy
my own judgexent. In fact, Mr. Charles told me that, knowing Duvglier, ~
es he knows him, it would have been a question of life or death if-he _
were to behave in a different manner. What would his death serve if he
had teken a position of ron-conproniset He feels that ih order to be-
able to control the situaticn and outlive Duvalier, it was better to be

“gn" than “out" or to put it another way to be alive than dead. I can
say that on’ several occasions, was 1t not for Nr, Charles'.influence on
Duvalier, this latter would have done more harm to the poor pelple of

| ‘Haiti, in general, than he has done so far, :

T have always maintained a dioloque with Mr. Charles.and passed on to
fia as mich as possible the Judgements of Haitians and others with vhom
hhe had no direct contact. I must say that I lahracieade find him re-
‘Gaptive to their opinions. i
..,,, Bversince I have known Mr, Chaxlea, he hes always told me of his
‘ambitions ond deteraination te. be a great Haitian, He asked me to never
let him.down and to stay with him to help hin. carry out his dream. Though
46 has cost me soms:of my friends, I have extended to him everything that
Teould possibly offer to help him reach hie goals. :

Unlike the majority of laitian politicians, Mr. Charles hos an un-

{ @Surmontable faith in the future of his country, He fucle that if Haiti,

under Duvecier, has considernbly regrosaed. in every woy, the time will. cone

where, lixe a miracle, the country will acain take its course forwarded
to join the ether procressive nations of this h

here. Unlike those
oem who have seen their prominent positions as

effairs with absolutely no future beyond Duvalier, Mr. Charles hos

a invested in Haiti ainost oll the wealth that he has accumula- "”
tea before and during Davalier's reign through genuine efforts and self-
@lecipline. Of course, I will adatt. that his wealth vould not have .
fnezeused in its prosent proportion if it was not for Duvalier's favors

position kave genuinely dirceted their efforts in using ‘thetr gains Zor’
the betterment of the people? I have always find that Kr, Charles took
very much satisfaction in giving exploysent and assistance to es many,
people as ne possibly could. As a matter of fact this ca one of his

: biggest assets in his present struggle.

Mr. Cucrles is not a demagogue. He believes in the realities of the
modern world. He realizes that without the assistance‘of the U.S., :
progress is impossible for Haiti. He sincerely believes in the spirit ~
of the Alliance for Progress. Having traveled «xtensively, he is fully
aware of the tragie state of stagnation in which his country is in. He -°

in their evaluation of Mr. Charles, it is their privilege and undeniable
rights. :

Now, 4f we are to take for granted my opinions, what docs Nr. Charles
have to offer to the U.S. to prevent the chaos that will necessarily
Sellow Duvalicr's dovnfallt First of all, Mrs Charles is at present

" peady.end willing to provoke the desired collapse of Duvalier's regime.
‘Tats, he assured mo, he can do without any outside assistance. I am
personally avare of certain confidential dicpositions.taken by him to
‘ascure the success of a coup. if and when he decides to. make it. Why does



'

not he co chead and sake it, you may ack? His reply is thit should
“he make it, shat absurances does he have that hfs action will. satisfy q
the U.S. As I stated before, Xr. Cnarles feels that without United : |
i

States bscking, no covernsent can ppssibly exist in Haiti except uncer
‘the very’ caxe conditions of Duvalier's Government. There would be no
reason to precipitate a change. if Haiti were to resain under a feces 4
@ictatorship lixe Duvalier's.

“What Nr. Charles is asking as a prerequisite or any action to be a
sponsored or initiated by him is the assurance fron a person of established
euthority in the U.S. Governnent thet the United States will support the
provisional governzent thet will necessarily have to assure power after
Duvalier, 4

Te dispositions taxen by Mr. Charles are that a nilitary coup by a
Junta will take over and stay in power until free elections are ‘held. The
menbers of that military junta have been already selected by Mr. Charles,

a who has their commitzents to that effect. Kr. Charles believe that if.
free elections are hel‘ he should not have any great difficulty in selling
his plans and prograns to the people and. therefore be elected the next
“president of Haiti... In ny opinion, Mx. Cherles is not asking too mich,

While I feel, it can wrap up the situation safely in accord with Mr.Charles'

Haiti a "cen of o the masses";
: 2, He is black, therefore representing the vast majority of

“Haitian people who, at this point, considers the light-skin tatstin as

The task, if and when he succecds to gain pover, will not be an easy
eng. I am sure, however, that Mr. Charles will be able to find the cup-

Joseph Charles, a Haitian banker who has been deeply involved

‘The following ie my hunble appraisal of the peliticel situation
now provafling in Heiti. . : is oy

As 1 repeatedly stat:d.to anyon: who may have asked me, my motl- |
vations sre purely patriotic ‘waile I en also moved by a sinsexe desire
to'boe findti omorge as a dcmocratie independent nation friendly to the ”
United States. . i

‘Since I left Haiti with my faxtly ten years ago to later become en
dmoricnn citizen, T have made several trips to Raitt and have maintained
close contacts with people in all walks of life both in Haiti and with
those who were forced out of the sountry for political reasons or other-
“wise.

. My latest visit to Haiti took place’on June 5th of this year and I
stayed tvo-days in Port-au-Prince. /Althcugh the purpose of my trips
were mostly business I also had the opportunity to discuss the Haitian
political situation with politicians, as well as with average Haitian
eitizens concerncd with the situation: My personal conclusions are as
follows: : : : : ;

‘The fact is that the Duvalicr regize is, at present, in a state o> _
Anterial politicenl confusion in which no one Girectly or indircetly .con=
nected with it con predict the outcoae. There is strong evidence showing
“that his son-in-lav, Colonel Max Dominique, has in fact tried to overthrow
-: Duyalier in order to personally assume the direction of Haiti's political
caftairs, Row Davalier becanc avare of Coleone) Dominique's intentions is
" the:quastion everybody 10 trying to find the ensver to. Nevertheless,
Duvalier roundod up the alledged associates of Colonel Dominique and,
after e wock court martial eccusing and convincing 19 young amy officers
of treason they vore ‘all killed ty a firing aquad on cune 8, 1967 at
“Fort Dimanche on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince. Duvalier himoelf was
} present at the slaughter and he ordered Col. Dominique tobe a menber of
the firing squad; Won-confimmed information from usually reliable sources



indicates that severel other persons, low runing military personnel,
militia men and civilians were also executed 3

imilur charges, without
fanfare, It is also the general concensus of opinion that the "purge"
will continue at a rate that.no one can yet determine, x

!Ne one ignores that there has been and still are very hostile’ feelings
etween two groups within the. President's family and close associates.
One 1s headed by Colonel Dozinique and his wife Marie-Denise Duvalier,
and another is led by Hrs. Yvon St.Vietor, the President's private se-
erctary and confidante. ‘The nanes of the President's wife, Simone, his”
son Jean-Claude and his younger daighter Simone, are being mentioned as
being part of the first grup. In the second group, Mrs, St.Victor's
Brother, the present Head of the Department of Tourism, Mr, Luc=Albert_
Foucard, who is also married to one of the President's daughter, 1s among
ther names such as Henri Siclait, head of the Regie, Minister Lebert |
Jn.Plerre, et2. mentioned to be siding with Mrs. St. victor, So far, the :
President has shovn signs that he favers the latter group. The ‘ramifice=
stions of both groups extend to people who were considered the most fenatic.
supporters of Duvalier hinself. ‘The fact is that none of the remaining
,€o-ealled strong men of Duvelier in the militis, the Tonton Macoutes or
the Army know for sure how.the president feels. towards them and are very“
siuch concerried ebout their own future and survival, In other vords
eonfusion ‘and insecurity are wide spread amongst Davalier's followers.
_Lisy Believe that in spite of the actual confusion and sense of insecurity
PFevailing in government circles, there is:no real organized opposition -
is such against Duvalier at, this moment, aiaied for what I will point out,
renee in this paper,
#°here is, nowever, strong enti-Divalier au in the niddie ant

well succeed to turn the country into a now communist satellite and work
out some agreements with communist countries. Here again, ‘ve should not

fail to mention the new exchange of diplomatic representations between
Haiti and some communist countries.

’
If allowed time, Duvalier may iMG
Ul

Tae most significant one 1s the nev i
appointment in Haiti of an Ambassador from Poland with vhoa,I was told,
Duvalier is closely working with.

Taking everything into consideration: '

» The non existence of any organized opposition in Haiti;
2. The state of non cohesiveness and distrust amongst the exiled

political elements abroad, therefore nullifying eny positive action from
outside Haiti;

3. The fear of local politicians that, if outside forces were to come °
in, their safety and security would be very much at stake, therefore they

should resist such intervention and do whatever is necessary to prevent
it at all cost;

4, Me fear of Duvalier's so-called follovers that they may be eliminated
upon mere suspicion, just or unjust dengiietations;

3. The middle and upper classes sentiment that the U.S. is not working
as it should to bring about the downfall of Duvalier and that the U.S. is
even supporting the regime intentionally or unintentionally by not en=
@ouraging or allowing the opposition to organize itael?;

: > 6, The interpretation of the above classes which arc at a loss tq under
stand the silence of the U.S. press in general for ‘not having raised: the
usual indignation about the recent masa killings, thersfore making roon-
for the velief of a possible collusion. by means of money or otherwise of |
| Duvalier with said press, particularly the New York Times, to refrain ‘from
_Wringing these fete to the attention of international public opinion;

7. The strong “belief th«t compromises have. been worked out with President’
‘Balaguer in the Dominican §

‘wpaylic to return to Halt’ all opponents of ~
. Duvalier who had fled there,

alk shia Sen to beldave 6 Dover VIL held tn pom for gitte « vt



It would be childish, however, to formulate an opinion only on the a
basis of the mentioned facts, although on the surface, they appear i
Logieal enough to confirm these conclusions. 7

I am convenced in my own mind, ‘that when some politicians close to :
Duvalier will feel that their lives are.in real danger, some of then
will successfully attempt to eliminate him even though thoy mey not be,
thezselves, in a position to control the chaotic situation that will ne=
cessarily follow. ‘This is vhere the real danger is, If any such un=
Plansied action was allowed to take place, the U.S. will then find itself
with a real "hot potato”, requiring such drastic action simtlar to those :
takin in 1965 during the récent erisis-in the Doninicon Republic. Such °° = :
actions are not to be desired, not only because they are costly to the A
American taxpayers, but because they inevitably provoke strong anti- leas ts
American feelings based on the opinion that the U.S, did nothing to help ae
bring about the collapse, but is merely there to impose its choice and
Gecisions against the will of the people. If the U.S. is to wait for the.
OAS to decide on joint action in the eventuality of chaos, ve are afraid
that conmunist influence and-even control-of the situation by forces
‘dased in Cuba and other countries, will make it mich more difficult to
eope with within the context of our national security. It is, therefore,

- imperative, in our opinion,.that the U.S. take some steps towards working -
with local politicians to take: the initiative of a coup which, when per=
formed, would receive the. strong backing of this country, militarily,
financially and otherwise, to secure an orderly succession of the present :
“pegime. As far as Haiti is concerned, I feel that I have the most adequate |;
‘solution for the proposed action. I feel that whenever the security of” i:
thie nation or any nation 18 concerned, there 1s nd tine for wait-and-sdo |
@eneiderations, In the case of Haiti, in particular, vhere the politica).
gcene is really deprived of individuals of strong convictione,;.one way or =
the other, wo fee). that the U.6, should not have any problem in finding
someone that they can build politically and work with in a. sincere and
Loyal effort to help that small nation solve some of ite perennial problens.

Now, if we are to take for granted my opinions, what does Mr. Charles ..
‘pave to offer to the-U.S, to prevent the chaos that will necessarily
follow Davalier's dowifallt. First of all,.Mr, Charles is'at present
“ weady and willing to provoke the desired collapse of Duvalier's regime,

the U.S,. As I stated before, Mr, Charles feels that without United —
States backing, no government can possibly exist in Haiti except. under
‘the very same conditions of Duvalier's Government. There vould be no
Teason to precipitate a change if Haiti were to romain under ry tyranical
@ietatorship like Duvalier's.. :

Wheat Mr. Charles is asking as a prerequisite of any action to ve
sponsored or initiated by him is the assurance from a person of established
authority in the U.S. Government that the United States will support. the
Provisional government that will necessarily have = assure power after “|
Davalier,

The dispositions taken by Mr. Charles ere that e@ military coup by a
dunta will take over and stay in power until free elections. are held. ‘he
menbers of that military junta have been already selected by Mr. Charles,  [

‘ whe has their commitments to that effect. Mr. Charles beliove that if i
free elections are hcid he should not have any great difficulty in selling i
Ais plans and programs to the people and therefore be elncted the next.

* @bove, I feel that the Haitian situation, long @ sore rote in the U.S.

“@oneerned: eee ‘a

Why should the United States gamble on any other calculated risk,
while I feel, it can wrap up the situation safely in accord with Mr.Char!:
plans? The military junta proposed by Mr. Charles willbe made up by high
vanking officers of the Haitian army loyal to him, therefore on the side

ateps proposed by Hr. Charles after the junta will take over are as follovss/

4, Provent the return to the Haitian political scone of ouch "rabblee.

5. Star. the ground work for free elections as soon as pousible,

Mr, Charles feels that although it will probably be impossibie to pre=
vent acts of reprisals during the first 72 hours of the milivary take,
over, strong efforts should be made to avoid unnecessary: bloodshed, i

* Ye. Charles, in my opinion, is.one of the few individuals around whom
&@ reconciliation of all the social’ divisions and subdivisions of the
Haitian family can be Reseed ‘I will mention some of the basic reasons
behind this opinion: i .

1. He is of nodest rural extraction, therefore is what is calied in
Haiti a “son of the masses";

2. He is black, therefore representing the vest najority of the
*‘Heitian people who, .at this point, considers the lighteskin Haitian as
@ threat for the return of the domination of the mulatto minority;

3. He ie deprived of the prejudice of color, therefore the mlatto
minority will find in him a’ certain feeling of sccurity and can be ase
gured that it will not be ene solely on the basis of the color of”
their skins; :
+++ by He a wealthy, hain iam tor not esbitiening power for”
mere personal gains; 7
Ge He 18 known to be a hard, intelligent tntustriad tot and edminis
‘trator capable of promoting and encouraging the stablishnent: of nev y
~Dusiness and industries in Haiti; E

6. He has chown respect for certain moral values euch os the undeniable
right of the individuel to live without fear within the Hirer! of the
“Qavs of the land;

:° Ts He de a Roman Catholic. who prof ‘to have nothing to do vith
"Yoodoo" a2 4 religion or e cult and who has given ali the other religious
Genominations functioning in Haiti all the evidence of nie encouragenent:
and support for their pastoral activities;



-10- : =

8. Beize a businessman in his own right, tho business comunity with _ |
which he has dealt through the Chamber of Commerce and his bank will
alvays have a dialogue with him and therefore will find him receptive

eee to their suggestions and erdeavours;
9. Having dealt with elements of the actual regime who huve his
L confidence, he will. be able to control them in a way which will avoid
unnecessary hardships should someone else = a complete stranger to then of
7 be in a position of Government leadership; : p
: 20. He 4s know to be strongly anti-conmnist and pro-American, there-
fore opening the door to close cooperation with the United States, under
the doctrine of the Alliance for Progress, to promote better understanding |
and opportunities for the Haitian. people with the help of the United. |
States; A
21. He will welcome the return of all Haitian exiles to take their
plece anev within the Hattion community. and to vork with Kim to the task
of making the country a safer and better place to live;
dle | 3. He does not contemplate any reprisals or even sanctions egatiist
peed ~ anybody for their past political affiliations, his efforte to be mainly —
” Atrected not to solve-tho-errors of the past, but to provide e better
: Present and future for those vho want to. live in Ratti,

é

The task, 4f and when he succeeds to gain power, will. not be an easy
ene. I am sure, however, that Mr, Charles will be able to find the .sup=
* port of enough honest and patriotic Haitians to help him carry out his
dream of building up 4 better Haiti,
| Wes Charles! past affiliation with the Duvalier regime. should not,
therefore, be held ageinst hin, As a mattor of fact, this affiliation may
“give him the foresight that he should do his utmost not to repeat the same

a Fasheround Clemard Josaph CHARLES, born Gonaives, Haiti,
21 April. Negro of peasant origin. -CHARLES ts a shrewd,
opportunistic, basically dishonest individual whose natural talents
have been channelled to President DUVALIER's advantage over a period
of ten years. lavine made considerable money in the banana busin
CHARLES was able, in 1960, to create the Commercial fank of Haiti,
which he is acsil the sole owner. Since its becinning, the Bank has been
an instrument for DUVALIER's financial manipulations, and CHARLES
is a subservient agent’ for the President in many of the latter's i:
clandestine operations conceived to evade U. S. Government surveillance.
CHARLES, for example, was DUVALIER’s agent in the operation designed
to smuggle surplus U. S. military aircraft to Haiti and, in fact, ~-.
made a trip to s USAF base in Arizona to effect: purchase, which tas ~~
later blocked. After long, close association with OUVALIER, during
~ - whieh CHARLES had: become extremely wealthy, he managed to: incur.
* DUVALIER's digpleasure. Cradus lly. cnartes} influence diminished in’
favor of Henri SICLAIT, Director of the Regie de-Tabac. As CHARLES -
, began to realize that he no longer enjoyed DUVALIER‘s favor, he
" . began, for the second or third time, to seek. cha: the pe
2 S. Government and to solicit support for himsel: successor to

the President...

3. in brief, CHARLES 4s trying to-coerce the U..S.° Government
