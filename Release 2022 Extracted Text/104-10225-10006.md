turn several failuros (recruitment pitches) into succerres.

Program which he completed in Aug 1908, After rejoining the
WH Division, he was selected for ignnent as an operations”
officer at the Base, where he arrived in May 1909.

____3-_Mr, Flores has made a most impressive beginning in

He has adapted to new tasks and a new environment Hi
with a mature assurance and a professional approach, Shortly ‘
after arrival in the Base was temporarily depleted of
other officers, ‘ir, Flores carried out the duties of acting
Chief of Base in a most commendable manner, fis fluency in
Spanish and his Latin background have been definite assets in the
performance of his duties. Nis performance to date has demonstrated
that he handles his agents securely and productively, Both Mr.
Flores and his wife have been well accepted within the locai
community and they carry out their representational duties very
effectively,

4, Mr.. Flores has proven to be a competent operations
officer. As he further develops tarough experfence and responsibility
he should become eligible for rapid advancewent. In any case he
is already performing at a level higher than his present grade and
a prometion at this time is strongly recommended,

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

nad WASHINGTON 28, D.C.

Applicant Information
oe Sheet No. 1

To all persons applying for eaployment
with the Central Intelligence Agency:

This paper is the first step in applying for employment or consultant
status with the Central Intelligence Agency. No application may proceed

beyond this first step if the applicant te not in agreement with the condi-

tions stated below:
General Considerations:

1. The National Security Act of 26 July 1947 (Public Law 253, S0oth
Congress) which created the Central Intelligence Agency places upon the

Agency the responsibility:

a, "to advise the National Security Council in matters concerning
such intelligence activities of the Government departments and agencies
as relate to the national security;

b. “to make recommendations to the National Security Council
for the coordination of such intelligence activities of the depart
ments and agencies of the Government as relate to the national

security;

c. "to correlate and evaluate intelligence relating to the
national security, and provide for the appropriate dissemination
of euch intelligence within the Government . . . 3

a. "to perform, for the benefit of the existing intelligence
agencies, such additional services of common concern aa the National
Security Council determines can be gore efficiently accomplished

centrally;
e. "to perform such other functions and duties related to

intelligence affecting the national security ag the National Security
Council way from time to time direct."



The spectal character of this national responsibility requires the Agen=
cy to maintain correcpondingly special employment criteria which may be
different from the routine or normal employment standards of other Gov-
ernment departments and agencies which do not have the highly senaitive
responsibility borne by the Central Intelligence Agency. It follows

that the investigation of applicants prerequisite to their acceptance 1s
a time-consuming process which, in addition to loyalty and security
checks, includes evaluation of competence, physical and enotional fitness,
and availability of a suitable position at such time as employment may

be offered. This 1s called "clearance" of an applicant.

2. Investigation of an applicant may reveal something which prevents
his clearance - perhaps something of which the applicant 1a genuinely un-
avare, perhaps something which only the special employment eriteria of the
Agency make unacceptable, In any event, adverse findings by the Agency
are conclusive and final co far as the Agency 1s concerned, and no state=
ment of specific reasons {6 made to the applicant.

3. Employment by the Central Intelligence Agency 1a not a right upon
which on applicant can insist. Offer of employment which 1s subject to
full clearance does not constitute a commitment on the Agency's part giv-
ing an unsuccessful applicant grounds for any claim againzt the'Agency.
Acceptance of employment upon the condition of clearance is at the appli-
cant's risk, taken with the knowledge that a very substantial percentage
of applicants are not cleared. :

Statement of Understanding

and Agreement.

I have read, understand, and agree to the foregoing General Consid-
erations. If not accepted for employment by the Central Intelligence
Agency, I will make no claim or demand in conflict with those considera-

tions.
I have also seen and read Applicant Information Sheet fo. 2.

and to devise a secure and timely method of

approach to the individual Quban.

In comparing Mr. Flores’ performance as an operations officer and as a

supervisor, I belicve his performance is somewhat stronger in the former capacity. i

Mr. Flores has all the attributes of an-excellent case officer: he is aggressive, i

thinks operationally, and is fast on his feet in an operational situation. He is

further aided by his fluency- in Spanish and has on more than one occasion successfully cies

| During his TDY travels, he has i i
‘yepeatedly demonstrated dedication to: the job at hand, willingness to work long
hours, and a flexibility to handle all types of situations. :

Mr. Flores is less enthusiastic when it comes to the paperwork and bureau- - ,
cratic requirements of his position. while he is a good writer, he tends to handle
his written tasks in a hurried mamer and consequently, his work oftentimes requires
review. He is also inclined to take the shorter and easier approach when handling
the paper flow requirements. I mention these points not because they represent
basic shortcomings, but simply to contrast them to his exceptionally high performance

in his operations officer capacity.

In sum, Mr. Flores is an extremely experienced, competent and well motivated
operations officer. His talent as a “street operator" with a keen sense for the
human target has been amply demonstrated. le has now quite successfully been
introduced to his first supervisory position and proven that he is competent for
assignments of this nature, I believe Mr. Flores is capable of handling positions
of increasing responsibility and should be given the opportunity to do so.

in the

The first independent training task given to Mr. Flores

was of a jserving as an access agent,
but this task was cancelled at the t minute when the con-
cerned Base discovered grounds for ficld termination of the
agent rather than providing tutorial training for the. agent in
the U.S. Mr. Flores was justifiably irritated at this turn of
events which denied him what held promise for being a challeng-
ing initial training program,

It was with regret that we learned, early into what turned
out to be Mr. Flores’ only independent training program, that
a priority requirement of his home-base Division would necessi- ~

“tate his return to Division duty soonest. The Division agreed ; Hi

. to our request that Mr. Flores conclude the training program
he had tailored, and begun, and Mr. Flores is to be commended
for having done an exceptionally fine job in this assignment.
The completion-of-training report was also well organised, and
the questionnaire which asks for an evaluative follow-up from
the trainee's field Station is to the point.

Farly in his assignment Mr. Flores took over the mainten-
ance and improvement of the Unit's operations training slides,
consolidated them into an extremely functional package, and
solicited ideas from other instructors to improve the package,
Much to his credit and the Unit's benefit, Mr. Flores managed
to persuade another Agency component to undertake--without
charge--a major revamping of some of the slides using computor-
designed art work to replace some of the less impressive early
work in this field.

In a very short time, Mr. Flores has become an important factor in

LA/COG's efforts to directly handle'Cuban and to :
expand its recruitment program,’ His fluent Spanish, past onerational
experience, versatility and ability to in
most Latin American countries, make him highly qualified for his present
assignment. He demonstrates sound operational judgment under often
trying conditions, and good ability to communicate effectively both
orally and in writing. His frequent TDYs demand long and unusual hours,
which he gives ungrudgingly.

Almost immediately after his assignment to LA/COG in March 1974,
Mr. Flores was called upon to handle a sensitive - | case. The
agent had already been recruited and many of the developmental aspects
of the case had been resolved prior to Mr. Flores’ introduction, but it
still required a Headquarters based case officer to provide the neces-
Sary continuity wherever the. agent The case is com-
plicated and time-consuming, involving extended TDYs and utmost
adherence to good tradecraft procedures, It has developed into one of

STATEMENT CONCERNING THI8 EVALUATION

CoumEnte OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

I concur with the rating officer's comments and performance evalua-
tion. Soon after his arrival at: LA/COG, Mr. Flores took over the
handling of a sensitive agent. While the agent's bona fides had already
been established and -his modus operandi determined, considerable ad hoc
judgement and direction were required to continue the agent's motivation
and ensure his viability. Mr. Flores did extremely well in his guidance
of the agent in a series of complicated, extended meetings which took

place in| Good, professional tradecraft and sound

activities in Latin America, due largely to Mr. Flores’
professionalisn.

Mr. Flores' current assignment is a combination of
operational and Headquarters desk responsibilities, the
latter calling for the support of field stations in their
efforts to develop individual Cuban recruitment programs.
His extended TDYs have understandably prevented Mr. Flores
(from devoting much time to his desk responsibilities and it
is somewhat difficult to judge his performance as a desk
officer. He has a good grasp of what needs to be done, and
his handling of specific tasks indicates good managerial
potential, Nevertheless, he does need additional desk
experience, especially in areas which will allow him to use _
his operational ability to support and guide field stations
that are developing Cuban operational programs.

COMMENTS BY REVIEWING OFFICIAL (CONTINUED)

this aspect of his performance was less noteworthy, and it
is believed more attention and research could have been given
to this activity. Mr. Flores writes concisely and well, and
his CI/CE instincts are sharp and true. He can be expected
to turn in a solid desk performance in the future.

illness of his daughter. mi : areait of this illness it was also
necessary for him-to spend the months of December and January on
emergency leave in the United States, returning without his family
in February in order to transfer his ops workload and pack out his
personal effects for PCS transfer to Headquarters on 4 March.

Although the undersigned had the privilege of working with
Subject only briefly, as rating officer he had the advantage of
taking over handling of most of Subject's cases following the
departure on emergency leave, Thus he was able to observe first

the progress he had made in developing their access and capabilities,
and the respect these agents had for him.

In carrying this heavy workload, Subject demonstrated that he is

a superior agent handler, He succeeded in conveying to these
people a sense of mission and participation which has kept their
morale.and motivation, and hence their production, at a high level.
He also insisted upon work and security discipline, with a result
that the record of these agents in prompt and relfable appearance
for meetings and in responding in writing to requirements is
extraordinarily good. -They all have a clear idea of what is
expected of them, confidence that performance will be rewarded
and conversely that non-performance will not be tolerated. Just

prior to his departure, Subject successfully terminated an entire

upon simply because the ._..) had been heavily used

order. Letting old agents go 1s always a delicate and usually a
thankless task. It takes finesse and bargaining skill. Subject
showed these and more in divesting us of the team without a hitch.

: During his Yast month in despite the fact that he was
burdened with the problems of closing out his household and the
normal operational and administrative cleanup prior to PCS depar-
ture, Subject made two very significant contributions to Station
objectives. First, he coordinated with the

The Station will miss Subject a great deal. As the above

came up, he was the officer we turned to most frequently. He

Subject has a clear-headed approach to the collection of
intelligence and is realistic in evaluating potential sources.

in the local community and he has devoloped several potentially
useful sources and identified others.

In considering this officer for promotion, two facts should
be kept in mind:

a. He is probably older and certainly more mature than
the average officer at his grade level, He is anxious to
get ahead and this explains much of his initiative and drive.

b. The rating officer has rated him very realistically
which, in my view, adds to the importance of the-outstanding
rating given him on Specific Duty No. 2, :

the target is good. The project is, however, in need of good human
reporting assets and it is expected that as Subject overcomes a
weakness mentioned in the next paragraph he will be able to devote
more of his time to this important task.

The Subject has encountered some difficulty in the preparation
of written material -- dispatches, intelligence reports -- and
finds it necessary to spend an extended portion of his time on its
preparation. The rater has discussed this with Subject on several
occasions, and it is believed that his difficulty is due to a lack
of experience, and that in time ana with a continuing effort on his
part he will develop his writing skills.

The Subject"s overall attitude and response towards his pro-
fessional responsibilities during the first tour have been positive.
He is interested in the kind of work he is doing, likes it and is
willing to put in the kind of long hours it sometimes demands
without complaint.

responsible acute cost consciousness in the use of funds and properties,

This rater's principal criticism!of this employee is his tendency
toward impulsiveness and too-quick Judgement before weighing all the
facts and Implications in the pursuit of Kis operational requirements;
however, this weakness is more a function of his inexperience in the
field and will be resolved as he gains more ficld experience.

expresa his own convictions and trust in his own assessment of a

Mr, Flores is a part-time staff employce who works a maximum of
193 hours per week while attending univer ity full-time, In August
1967 he will obtain his bachelor's dexree in Political sefence, He
will revert to full-time employment upon finishing his university
studies and will be recommended to the Office of Training for admission
in the CT class beginning November 1967,

The linitations imposed by part-time employment have prevented
us fron assigning Mr, Flores-to jobs within the branch such as the
monitoring of active field cases which require close, daily attention,
~However, he is qualified for this type of duty. His performance in

the duties described above is excellent. Re accomplishes his tasks
quietly and efficiently with a minimum of guidance from his super=
visor. Because he is bi-lingual in Spanish and English he is of
great use to the Branch in scrcening quickly and accurately materials
which are of counter-intelligence interest,

Mr. Flars agency work background, coupled with his formal
education about to be completed and his own desire to make a carcer
in intelligence make him an extremely valuable employee, one in whom
the Agency should not hesitate to invest time and money for the
advancement of his career training,

language, his willingness to learn and perform tedious tasks, and his conscientious
approach to his work were important factors in his performance. His previous
assignments in the RI Division and in WH/SA as a translator and in conducting name
traces gave him a good background.
