MIKE ZERVOS.
Confidential Source

MIKE ZERVOS, who has furnished valuable information
concerning the activities of the MANNARINO organization since
the inception of the Top Hoodlum Program, sailed for A;hens,
@reece, on 4/10/59, aboard the SS OLYMPUS from New York, N.Y.
ZERVOS, the acknowledged racket boss in Westmoreland County,
Pa., during the 1920's, was released from the Western State
Penitentiary during the summer of 1952 after being a prisoner
for over 20 years on a conviction formrder. When ZERVOS.
eee to New Kensington, Pa., in 1952, he quickly re-

stablished himself in the MANNARINO controlled numbers
racket on a limited scale and even though he was disliked
and mistrusted by the MANNARINO brothers, he was able to
furnish valuable data to this office concerning their operations.
Information that he furnished concerning the numbers operation
resulted in two highly successful raids conducted by the
Intelligence Division, Internal Revenue Service, following
dissemination by this office.

ZERVOS stated that he does not intend to return to
the United States and his criminal history and alien status

will preclude his re-entry into the United States through
normal channels.

It will now be-necessary for the agents assigned
to the MANNARINO investigation to develop new sources of
information who are capable of providing the caliber of
intelligence data previously furnished by ZERVOS.

MIKE GEORGE HAZIDAKIS a

Confidential Source MIKE ZERVOS on 3/13/59 stated
after HAZIDAKIS was released from Montefiore Hospital
November, 1958, he was in a very weakened condition and
attempted to recuperate at bis home in New Ken: gton with
great fficulty, ZERVOS said that after several months
BAZIDAKIS became alarmed over his inability to recover from
operation and since he was obviously not responding to
matmens, he decided to return to his family in Greece.

ZERVOS said that HAZIDAKIS left for Greece around
3/10/59, probably aboard the SS OLYMPUS, saying that he. might
return,to sell his home and settle other business affairs
providing his health improved.

ZERVOS stated that in his opinion, HAZIDAKIS would
undoubtedly take full advantage of his poor physical condition
to remain in Greece permanently because of his long expressed
fear of GABRIEL MANNARINO.
