Msg. Nr. 11512

44 USC 2107(5)(g)(2)(D)(i)

On 7 October

reported fron Havana:

Comments on FIDEL's speech of 28 September.

Cuba's foreign policy and its

attitude toward the Moscow Treaty are determined by the aggressive activities of

the United States. General relaxation may not be applicable to the Caribbean area.

1o The coups in Honduras and the Dominican Republic,, and the rise of

reactionaries in Venezuela, he ties in with coordination of operations against

Cuba by the CIA from Central America.

Smuggling of arms to the capitol is on the increase.

The underground

is switching to a long-range harassment supported by pirate activities from the

outside. In September the government carried out massive military operations in

the Escambray and Matanza areas.

The Cuban counterrevolutionaries and Cubans from Central America

heavier underground traffic in men and arms for November and December.

4. I believe that the approaching Presidential elections in the United

States will strengthen reactionary forces from within and without. Immediate US

aggression is out of the question.

Therefore, there is a need for a strong gorilla

[sic] collar around Cuba.

Simultaneously, the economic blockade is being intensi-

Pied. This is dictated by the consequent "anti-imperialistic lines of our own

foreign policy.". On the whole, in their opinion, relaxation is due to the peace-

ful policy pursued by the Soviet Union, but they attribute this, first of all, to

their own position.
