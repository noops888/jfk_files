Comments on FIDEL's speech of 28 September. Cuba's foreign policy and its
attitude toward the Moscow Treaty are determined by the aggressive activities of
the United States. General relaxation may not be applicable td the Caribbean area.

le The coups in Honduras and the Dominican Republic,” and the rise of
reactionaries in Venezuela, he ties in with coordination of operations against
Cuba by the CTA from Central America. i

26 Smuggling of arms to the capitol is on the increase. The underground
is switching to a long-range harassment supported by pirate activities from the
outside. In September the government carried out massive military operations in
the Escambray and Matanza areaso

3. The Cuban counterrevolutionaries and Cubans frem Central America
announce heavier underground traffic in men and arms for Navember and December.

4e I believe that the approaching Presidential elections in the United
States will strengthen reactionary forces from within and without. Immediate US
aggression is out of the question. Therefore, there is a.need for a strong gorilla
(sic] collar around Cuba. Simultaneously, the economic biockade is being intensi-
fied. This is dictated by the consequent "“onti-imperialistic lines of our own
foreign policy." On the whole, in their opinion, relaxation is due to the peace-
ful policy pursued by the Soviet Union, but they attribute this, first of all, to
their own position.
