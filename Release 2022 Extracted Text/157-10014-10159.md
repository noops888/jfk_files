Re telisved we should mininiza our iivolvement in this coup and
allow Artassader Lodge to return on schedula. The Presidemt com=
rented that Anbassadcor Lodgs’s departura need not o3 delayed but
that Ceneral Uarictns chowld bs placed in charges if any cop should
begin. He and Cemral Taylor commented that the problem was not m
overall balance of forces bat that the role of few leaders would oa
éscisivs in a coup situaticen. It was sus,jested that General
Charge d'affaires Trceneart and CAS chiar act as a com
dirset any coup operation. lr. ieCcne countered with the view that
CAS chief should not oe involved in such a pollcy-naxing function
although be vould be in a rositdon to provide tecimical advice to
Ceneral Saricdins and Irneneart as well as carry out their instrace
ticrs in the operational fisld.

3. ‘The Attorney Ceneral commented that a corp is Yietnan was

pointed cut that President Dian was a fishter end would probably
reacs nest sharniy and aly to the ir rates, Ha qd
that ve ssould imow more abort this coup and that failure could spell
disaster. He felt that ine United States was risking too mich based

flissy evidsnce.

4. General Taylor commented that his impression was that tha
military were not interested in politics but only in getting on with
the war. He added that even a successful coup would have a bad short-
tora effect on tha war since the confusion and changes of persennel
such es province chisf3 vould lead to a satback, tir. MeCone stated
that he azreed with Caneral Taylor that sven a siiccessfal coup would
create a reriod of interrecmm and confusion which might only be
solved by a second or third coup. The President questioned vhether
such wide changes in provinca chiefs would necessarily have to
follow a succass@al coup. ‘Secretary Rusk stated his belief that a
quick, snecessful coup would bring better leadership to Vietnam.
Governor Harrizan stated nis belief that wiless a change in coverne
ment vas brought about, the var will ron dom and be Isst since Diem
éces rot have ihe leadership qualities necessary to carry the comtiry
to victor. 5

the prosrect of increased nilitary effort in the war, ypocular sup=

SUBJZCT: Cuban Arms Cache in Venezuela

1. At5:CO P. Me, 19 November, : the, former * Deputy
Chief of Station in Caracas, and I called on the Attermey Gereral to show
hin one of the submachine. guma which had been retrieved from ihe arms
ener on the
Paraguana Peninsula of Veremela. Last week, the Attorney General h:
teld m= that it would be most useful if the Agency were to produce some
gm or other piece of military equinment which had actually been sent from
Cuba to another country in Latin America. Therefore, we briefed tha At-
torney General in detail on the materiel in t
which we had been able to demonstrate that the origin of wt
Cuban. He examined the submachine gun and the succorting photograms
which show serial numbers and the Cuban Army shield. ‘While we were talc
ing with the Attormay General, he took a telapnone call in another room.
Upon bis retum, he said that he had been speaking witn the President and
that we were to go to the ‘ihite House within thirty minutes to show this
gun to hin.

2. The President was briefed on the origins af the submachine gun
and on the methods used to establish that it had coms from Cuba. We also
described in Hetail what was foumd in the arms cache and the purposes for
waoich the sateriel was intended. ‘Je referred to the fact that mortar
shells had Seen found wrapped in the unique airdrop gear which the Agency
had devised Zor use at the Bay of Pigs. Tne Frresicent inquired about haw
the military equimment had been transported to Vanesuela, our reply ceing
that we believed it had been by boat since a small aluminum craft with an
outboard motor had been found thres hundred yards from the actual cache
site. We then pointed out that President Zetancourt cesirsd to surface
the finding of the Cuban arms cache at a tina of his cheosing prior to
the Venezuelan presidential election on 1 December. The President agreed
that President Fetancourt should be siven this cpeortunity. He further

- stated that the United States Govermnent should co nothing a>oub sure

facing its interest in these arms wmtil a decision has been made on what
steps the united States wants to take in retaliaiion against castro. He
gave no suggestions as to what line of action he desired to pursue but

informed hin that the nroblem was already veing worked on by Alexis ;
Johnson, Paul Nitze, and representatives of this Agency. I specifically
cleared with the President showing the submachine gim and other evidence
to interested officials of State and Defense.

3. It was clear that both the President and the Attornsy General
were intensely interested in this concrete example of Castro's export of
arus for subversion. ra wags no opportunity with either gentleman to
2 on other evidence of Castro subversive activity

in Central and South America. ef

"Yes, it gives me a feeling of confidence." The formerz™d I Fen went

out ona of the French doorg on to the portico and walled sroud to
