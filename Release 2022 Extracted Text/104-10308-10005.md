the terms providing his name was never involved, Accordingly,
on 25 April, BABUN gave CAMERON the $2,500.00 and CAMERON

had already called their man in PBRUM:N telling him to proceed
as planned adding that "their other man" would be heading for

held jointly by CAMERON and a confidant of LOBO.

ty Squad who was about to retire from the force and who had numerous
connections in the MAFIA, CAMERON also implicd that “the other mar
in question was in Spain, Because of his position between the St.
Louis contacts and the BABUN group, CAMERON has become somewhat
nervous about the operation but not to the extent that he would
be willing to compromise it to the police, As CAMERON knows, he
could also be indicted for conspiracy and he also knows that if
there was any treachery on'his part, the BAGUN group would not
hesitate to sink his ship, the M/V CAYMAN HOPE,
