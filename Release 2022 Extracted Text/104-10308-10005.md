and BOSCH agreed to advance the $100,000.00 with the BABUN group

apprehensive and had AMCANOE-1 contact Julio LCBO Olavarria

Accordingly,

on 25 April, BABUN gave CAMERON the $2, 500.00

CAMERON also revealed during the negotiations that

his contact was a police officer in the St. Louis, Missouri, Vice

Squad who was about to retire from the force and who had numerous

connections in the MARIA. CAMERON also luplied that

"the other ma!

in question was in Spain. Because of his position between the St.

louis contacts and the BABUN group, CAMbRoN has become soncwhat

nervous about the operation but not to the extent that he woul

be willing to compromise 1t to the police.

AB CAMERON knOwS,

could also be indicted for conspiracy and he also knows that

there was any

treachery on his part, the BArUn group would not

hesitate to sink his ship, the M/V CAYMAN HOPS.
