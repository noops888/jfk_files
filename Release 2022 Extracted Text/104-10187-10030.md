Headquarters will note from the above that three lines were disconnected in
order to cover three Yugoslav lines. Two of the lines which were disconnected
were Cuban Embasay lines, both were not in use by the Cubans, One was in
the apartment which had been vacated by Ramon Sinobaw and not occupied by
other Cubans, The other was a telephone in the Cuban Rmbassy which was
never anewered, The Cubans are trying to get Sinobas' line moved to the
Embassy. They have also asked for the telephone company to repair L4=92-14,
‘As soon as thege lines are working again, coverage of two of the Yugoslav
Embasoy linea will be dropped in order to pick up all the Cuban lines which

are presumed to have a much higher priority.

Cuban lines (three), the Soviet Embassy lines (five), and ag of 13 and 23
S eptember the Yugoslav lines (three). These transcripts are received each

PERSONALITY BRIEF

1. General Lazaro CARDENAS del-Rio

. AS a pro-Communist, anti-United States former (1934-1940)
President of Mexico, CARDENAS plays an important role in the
political activities of Mexico by virtue of his being the

Movement), rabidly anti-U.S., pro-Cuba Communist Front; and
(3) CCI (Independent Peasants' Center), radical, anti-Mexican
Government organization. Having been banished from Mexico
until after the 1964 elections for anti-government activities,
MALDONADO 4s currently in Europe and secking admittance to
the USSR, obstensibly to visit his daughter who is a student
at the Friendship University in Moscow,

3. Alonso AGUILAR Monteverde

who is the titular head of the MLN (National Liberation
Movement), rabidly anti-U.S., pro-Communist front. ie is a

Lazaro, CARDENAS, the. Cuban Ambassador to Mexico, and Polish,
Soviet, and Chinese Communist officials. TAMAYO's son has
studied in Warsaw and travelled to the USSR and Communist

China,

5. Jose David ALFARO Siqueiros

imprisoned for eight (S) years as a consequence of the role
he played in the Communist-inspired railroad stike of 1959,
He is a leader of .the PCM (Mexican Communist Party) and has
visited the Soviet Union. Ho fought for the Loyalist Army
in the Spanish Civil War and was later arrested in Mexico
for complicity in the murder of Leon TROTSKY'S secretary.
ALFARO has a long history of pro-Communist, anti-U.S. leanings.

6, Roberto ROMERO Adams

ROMERO is an informant for the Cuban Intelligence Service
in Mexico.

7. Enrique GONZALEZ Pedrero

Pro-Communist professor at the National Autonomous
University of Mexico, GONZALEZ Pedrero has contributed to the
writing or editing of at least five (5) leftist publications

MLN, has alledgedly received training in the Soviet Union,
and has travelled to Cuba twice in recent times,

8. Ignacio ACOSTA Laguacs

contact with high-level personnel of both the Cuban and

management of the Communist Trade Fair in Mexico, and a great
deal of participation in promoting sympathy for the Cuban

Revolution in Mexico,

9. Direccion Federal de Seguridad ~ Federal Sccurity Police

The principal functions of this security unit are to:
(1) Provide a plain-clothed security detail for the President,
(2) maintain an extensive telephone tap activity on both

the Rightist and Leftist political opposition forces, and

(3) perform investigations and arrests of primarily political
offenses, The unit's agents are largely poorly trained,
insecure, and unreliable. Their professional characteristics
are best described as being dishonest, cruel, and abusive.
The position, at this moment, of Manuel RANGEL Escamilla as
Direct6r General of DFS 1s precarious,

10, Politica

A Marxist anti-U.S. semi-monthly magazine published in
Mexico, Politica is printed by Talleres Graficos de Mexico,
the same shop which prints La Voz de Mexico. In addition to
the modest revenues derived From a circulation of 15,000
to 25,000, Politica is financed by the Soviet Embassy, the
MLN, the PPS, and possibly, the Cuban Embassy, As an
indication of the Mexican government's assessment of the
capability of this magazine to influence public opinion, it
is worthwhile noting that Politica frequently experiences a
great degrce of difficulty tm printing and circulating itself
due to the government's repressive efforts.

11. Movimiento de Liberacion Nactonal (MLN)

Organized under the influence of the PCM in August 1961,
the MLN today is dedicated to the furtherance of the mutual
interests of its adherents who are found primarily in the
ranks of the PRI, the PPS, the PCM, the CNC and the UGOCM.

The MLN's objective ts to gain leftist political represen-
tation in the government by inciting PRI to accept leftists
into its camp, As a consequence of this objective, the mission
of MLN is to generate evidence of popular leftist sympathy

by means of fomenting agitation among the popular, labor, and

peasant masses,

12, Confederacion de Trabajadores de la America Latina (CTAL)

The CTAL has recently been replaced by the CUTAL (Single
Confederation of Latin American Workers). Until recently, the


-4-

pro-Communist, CTAL, which is described as being the liaison
bureau of the WFTU (World Federation of Trade Unions) whose
headquarters are in Prague, was headai by Vicente LOMBARDO

Toledano.

13. Prensa Latina

= Operatiéng directly under the Cuban Communist regime,
Prensa Latina is obstensibly a press service, In reality,
however, it is the official propaganda organ of the Cuban
Government. Prensa Latina works closely with Tass, the
Soviet Agency; with Hsinhua, the Chinese Agency;and with
Cetepka, the Czechoslovakian Agency.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Forelgn Intelligence ,
SUBJECT: ‘TDY to Mexico City

1. After taking a good look at LIRNVOY and LIFEAT, I would agree
with the persone I talked with in Mexico} they maintain that any well-
run tap operation should produce substantial intelligence information,
provided the targets are of intelligence interest, and provided aleo ‘
there are people at the station who look for it and are able to recog- ‘
nize it. The case of LIFEAT 1s interesting’in this respect: It has
deen deprived of its most productive lines in favor of LIZKVOY, and
yet ite intelligence production coupares favorably, vith that of the
other productive taps, except LIENVOY.

2. Maxteo has people who can detect any little item of intellt-
gence significance. This includes the Chief of Stacton, who goes over
the highlights of the previous day's take every morning and marke
certain {tems for action by station case officers or reports officeras
The reports officers work on copies of the take at the came time.

3. ‘There are several aspects of LIENVOY that make it an excellent
operation and an outstanding producer of intelligence. I will describe
thea in detail when ay notes gst here from the station. The principal
factors in the success of LIRNVOY seem to be the rollowing.

a. The agreenont wede with top Mexican officials, unlike
many such agreements elsewhere, ia as mich in effect today as it 7
vas aot the start: the targeting is not dated on personal politica
the intercept staff has atayed on the Job; the equipsent is con- ~
sidered to be on loan from CIA,

bd. ‘The native monitoring staff hae reached a peak of effec-
tiveness that evaryone at the station praises very highly.

c. Tha otation fo organized to handle the tuke speedily as
soon as it coms in. The Chief of Station, the case officers, the
reports officers, ali work on it at the same time and excnange
Views on hot items, They do not let reports backlogs accumulate.



Viki

d. Bach new item on @ target person is linked to a past

Mistery; vhat appeara as a fragzentary bit in a-conversation
decanes a meaningftl developesnt, in a contiquous story. Contle

muity on the Job makes this possible.

@. ‘The equipsent is kept in gocd working order by complete
@leaning dnd checking of rach unit orce a month. The 32 unite
in uge today are those installed in 1959.

4, .A detailed description of LIRNVOY and its counterpart LIVRAT
should provide good modela with vhich to compare other tap operations. .
It chould give criteria for good procedures. It should giv some idea
of. the desirable size of such operations, considering the available
targets, the site of the atation, and the other tasks and operations of
the station. It should ohov viat the station puts into ite tap opera-
tions and what it gets out of then. LIRNVOY and LIFKAT are an interesting
example of tvo interacting operations, one Joint and the other indepond-

ent.

5. My otay in Nextco was as interesting and fruitful as it ves
enjoyable. And I hope it waa not too great a burden on the station.

12 September 1963

Dear Willard:

This may seem to you like a voice out of the void, but I
always carry in my miad your repeated invitations to visit you
and remember clearly your acquaintance and kindness to ny
brother, ‘trangely enough it seems to continue to be true
that the only escape from this jail-like desk is back to ny
old area where I nevor expected to roturn--I even had ono this
Bpring. Just now I have a specific reason for wanting to
visit your place, that is, in addition to our own personal

reasons,

For some time I have boon bent on trying to push for sore
positive information from taps and audio, I realiza taat it
de taken for granted around the world that the purpose of taps
anc audio is for operational leads, particularly in the KUDESS

field,

In one or two places in the world, positive production is
outstanding and have beon making study for sowe tine
trying to see why it works in some os and not in others.
Ons of the outstanding examples is LIFEAT and especially LISNYOY.
Tnesa seem to be far ahoad of other similar operations around
the world even though they seem to approach the problom
sonevhat similarly. It occurred to mo that wo might find out
what makes yours so especially effective by having one of ay
paople go to your station for a few days to talk with you and
your officers and get the detailed story. I could then take
another look at the other operations and see what's missing or
what's wrong. I'm suro this would be of great help to tho
place as a whole. If you agree, I will send Paul V. Levister
(ideo), the editor of our Foreign Intelligence Series (our
8taff doctrinal papers, the first few of which have been
dispatched to you). He could bo in Mexico City on or about
23 September, or any time thereafter that 1s more convenient
for you and your peoplo. Could you let us know your reaction
by cable, and if it's favorable, when you would prefer to have
levister arrive, Ye would confirm his ETA by cable,

!



Galbond is leaving tomor!
way and I havo asked bim to
he desk here concurs in our

row to make a visit down your
be kind enough to pass this to you,
interest subject to your approval.

On 7 August 1963 the Station EE case officer requested LIENVOY coverage of
the Yugoslav lines, Arrangements are being made to put these lines in within
the near future,

3. Processing of LIENVOY Information,

The Station continues to receive full transcripta in Spanish from ten
lines (five Cuban Embassy aad five Soviet Embassy), DIR-60764 dated

15 August 1963 asked the Station to send to Headquarters one copy of the full
transcripts from the Cuban Embassy lines. These are being forwarded on a

weekly bauis, The (irst group is being forwarded as an attachment to HMMA=22000
dated 21 August 1963, If they do not please Headquarters officers who desire

them, it is requested that the Mexico Station be promptly advised with any
suggestions for changes,

On 6 August 1963 Orville HORSFALL, staff ayent, arrived in Mexico
to work presently ag a unilateral monitor but eventually as the supervisor of

a tap center either under LIENVOY or LITEMPO. He haa established himself
outside and is presently at work eliminating the backlog of Soviet tapes,

Douglas J, FEINGLASS continues to do the Russian from LIENVOY,
the Russian from two LIFEAT lines on Soviet targets, and the Russian from

the LIPAWN audio operation, In addition, FEINGLASS sends clipped transcripts
to the Station ready for 201 files.

4. Exploitation of LIENVOY Informatign,

HMMW-1I831 dated © August 1963 indicated that Headquarters was

not well informed on the way the Mexico Station exploits operational leads from
LIENVOY, The outside staff agent, Arnold AREHART haa instructions to alert
the Station immediately if a U.S, citizen or English speaking person tries io
contact any of the target installations, This is done by a telephone call from
outside the tap center at a pay phone to Robert B, RIGGS inside the Station,
Emergency nieetings are arranged in double talk (meeting for coffee or lunch),
RIGGS meets AREHART within fifteen minutes at a presarranged downtown
location and receives the reel with an extract of the pertinent conversation,
The reel is then taken to the Station and given to the case officer responsible
for the target the person was trying to contact. Headquarters is notified by
cable af the action taken, Only in rare cases is information on a U.S, citizen
passed without prior Headquarters approval.

CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH

Other lvade appear in the full transcripts or daily resumen, They
also are exploited by the Station case officer responsitle for the target where
the lead appears, For example, onl August 1903 Boris KAZANTSEV,
recently arrived Counsclor of the Soviet Embassy and former defection target
in Mexico, called hie wife at their reaidence, The number was not listed but
was immediately checked by Raymond GERENDE who determined that the
number waa the switchboard of theapartment house where KAZANTSEV and
several other families live. The reason the Station checked out this number
was to put unilateral coverage on it if pousible; however, the switchboard was

beyond the Station's capability tohandle,

i Maryknoll priest Felix McGOWAN contacted the Cuban Embassy on
$i July 1965, MEXI-5565 reported details of this contact. This cable was sent
to Headquarters for dissemination and action by ODENVY.

Professor WEBB (fnu) of the University of Louisiana contacted Mexican
Communist Jorge L. TAMAYO Castillejos, prominent Mexican Marxist intel=
lectual and professor at the University of Mexico, and arranged to meet with
him on 31 July 1963, MEXI-5563 reported this contact to Headquarters for

dissemination and action by ODENVY.

Bartolo (fnu) contacted former Governor of Baja California, Braulio
MALDONADO Sandez on 16 July 1963 regarding the sale of Cuban pesos. MEXI~5569
reported this contact to Headquarters for dissemination and action by ODENVY.

5, Liaison

On 15 August 1963 Willard C, CURTIS met with LITENSOR to arrange
for a sensitive PBRUMEN case (MEXI=5789 reported the details of this meeting).

6. Security

There were no security incidents within the project during this month,

7. Technical

‘There were no technical problems during this period,

8. Personnel

Orville HORSFALL's arrival is the only change in personnel since the
last report and he is handled as an independent agent by the Station, with no
LIENVOY personnel aware of his presence in Mexico, Robert B, RIGGS sees

HORSFALL daily to deliver and pick up tapes,

! 1. The referenced cables describe tvo recent incidents in which the

i Mexico City Station made use of LIENVOY information to take investigative or
punitive action against security suspecto. The first reference reported the
Adentitying and .."trapping".of a PHPHIME citizen vho was offering his services
to the Cuban Embassy, and the second reported the deporting of a Cuban I8
agent identified by LIENVOY naterial.

- 2+ In both of these cases, there seems to have been departure from the
extreme caution with which the Mexico Station has always handled the LIENVOY
material. Admitting that the cables do not set cut enough facts to enable us
to make a final judgment, ve still feel o little uneasy dbout this use of
{ LIENVOY material. In the first case, the Station sent on agent to the suspect's

hotel, posing as a Cuban Embassy official to "trap" him into revealing his
intentiona. The scheme, vhich was admittedly clever, succeeded, but ve vere
i concerned about what would hava happened if the Cubans themselves had decided
i to contact the individual. Would not the LIENVOY operation have been exposed
to same extent? We grant that the Cubans and other bloe personnel in Nexivo

City may suspect LIENVOY exists, but they do not know it --- yet. Incidentally,
we had no traces on the PSPRIMER involved.

3. The second case involved the detection, spprehension and deportation
of a Cuban IS agent viose vhereaboute vero learned through LIENVOY. Fron the
few facts we know about this cane, we cannot really judge the possible risk to
LIBNYOY. The Mexico Station created LIENVOY and has always guarded ite security
with serupulous care. Has there been u change?

i 4, Finally, pleasenote that both these cases should have been reported
to Heedquarters before action was taken. In general, arrests, deportation,
tropping, or other action against accurity suspects should te approved by llead-
quarters, except where in the opinion of the Chief of Staticn, tho added time
needed vould seriously impair ODYOKE security or the security of our operations.
| ‘The Mexico Statica has wlvays done thia, ani the coincidence of two recent cases
| Vhere.1t was.not done inspires us to query you. Please let us knov your views.

On 5 Jame 1963 Douglas J, FEINGIASS, Staff Agent, arrived in
Mexico to repla: iO. the Statios translator for Russian
language conversations appearing on LIENVOY and LIFEAT lines, SAFARANO
departed PCS on 15 June thus freeing an inside slot for use by an operations
officer, FEINGLASS’ usefulness io the Station is handicapped by his Inability
to transcribe the Spanish portion of the reels from the Soviei coverage. This,
despite Headquarters assurance that he coull do these transcriptions, Howeved,
he has settled into outside living condizions with a minimum of difficulty,

. For the present, a monitor from the LIENVOY tap center is transcribing the
Spanish portion ofthe above take, There is a Station backlog of Soviet tapes
numbering about 50 waich accumutated during the perlod when FEINGLASS
was trying unsuccessfully to transcribe the Spanish, Tae backlog is being

= retained until Orville HORSFALL arrives, In addition to the Russian trans-
erptions, FEINGLASS also ellps the cranscripts for individual dossiers thus
relieving the S.ation Cas¢ Officer for Soviet operations of a clerical task,
After the arrival of HORSPALL. the Mexico S:ation will review requirements
for outside translators and make recommendations for future use of

FEINGLASS,

In early Junc to support the AMROD operation, the Station requested)
full transcripts of the Cuban Embassy lines, In addition, ‘Thomas G,
URQUHART (ps) while on temporary duty in Mexico was given access to the
LIENVOY tap center co review the traffic on a current basis,

4, Exploitation of LIENVOY information,

Coverage of the Cuban, Czech, and Soviet Embassies provided
details of their personnel, their contacts, travel and other useful CE data,
In most all cases of official travel, LIENVOY gave the Station advance
informatton when reservations were made, Confirmation of the travel ts,
of course, obtained through the LIFIRE project.

The traffic is reviewed for English speaking persons who might
be U.S, citizens making contact with Soviet or Soviet Satellite Embassies for
political or other reasons, On 20 May 1963 an English speaker identifying
himself as Albert Kennedy called the Soviet Embassy and requested political
| asylum for himself, his wife and seven children, Subsequent investigation
‘ revealed that he was also a protection case at the U, Embassy in Mexico.
Appropriate U, S, agencies were advised of Subject's contact with the Soviet
Embassy,

5. Liaison,

During this reporting period there were no mectings between the
Chief of Station KUBARK and LITENSOR; however, regular coatact was
maintained with LUELEGANT and LIERGO,

6, Security,

There were no security incidents within the project during this
month, As reported in MEXI-5170, 26 June 1963, the true name of a
KUBARK case officer was revealed <o the Cuban Embassy by a caller who
refused to identify himself, From the cranseripr it appeared that the Cuban
Embassy was nov interested in making coniact with the caller who claimed to
have details of KUBARK operations in Mexico,

1963 by Thomas G. URQUHART, :

2. A copy of this dispatch with attachnent is being sent

in ARELLANO, .

3, Owing to the occasional lack of logging, it was not
always possible to ascertain the exnct date a particular conversation

office line of Vludimir Ivanovich SAMOKHIN).

this product reaches the Soviet ease officer about an hour or two after receipt
of the Spanish reporting. Simultaneously, flimsy copies of the above have been
viven to the reports officer and to other interested Station offizsers. The
first copy is kept in a Station chrono file, for purposes of perzanent record.
It {0 annotated for ZOUAR purposes.

3. ‘The Soviet officer, Lucy A. Dillin@r, and other cfficers, read the
product quickly for the Immediate purpose of obtainin.: exploitable LCIMPROVE

or other operational leads, and/or reportable intellizence. Arter this initial
acannins, the product 1s literally cut up, with each elippin: of stsnificant
conversation sent to COS and to various Station officers for their information
and/or action. Whenever pertinent, the actual LIENVOY clip is seat to Head-
quarters, for inforcation or action - or a owunury of the clip is sent to
Headquarters in dispatch form. Each clip is eventually routed to the Station's

rezistry where indexing and filing; is completed.

4, ‘The Station finds that this Soviet LIENVOY clipping program provides
the files on the individual Soviet staffers with a rather yocd Picture of their
activities and personality. (‘These individual files are of ccurse aumented
with information derived from double agent operations, LIEMPIY reporting, Head-
quarters provided information, ODASID reportin;,, newspaper clippings and other
miscellaneous reporting). In many cases, however, the backbone cf a Station
file on a Soviet may derive principally from bits and pieces of LIEWVOY product,

activities, propaganda activities, Soviet contacts, etce very often, 4 sinale
clipping may have to be copied to be sent to the files of several imiividual
Soviets and/or to one or pore casecory files.

5. Unfortunately, the Station does not have sufficient personnel
available to analyze and collate periodically the LIESVOY and other Station
product in the individual soviet files for transmittal to Headquarters for
its information; or possibly more important, for eventual transmittal to another
Station where a Soviet from Mexico City is revasigned. Ieadquarters attention
is directed ajain to MEXI-9825 of 17 January 1962 and allied correspondence
resarding the desirability of ‘having ao trained Headquarters TDYer work on these
saterials at the Station. Headquarters may now wish to reinvestivate the
possibility of finding a qualified staffer for this TIDY assignment.

Minister, and sug nat Fidel Castro write a short

Message ta the Mi peuple ia Sicinpre on it
sary of pablication (see HMMA 19399).

The negative treatment to a Czech commercial representative
by Mexican Immigration authorities (see HMMA 19158),

The refusal by the Pan American Inszitute of Geography and
History of the Organization of American States to permit Teresa
Proenza Proenza, Third Seeretary and Cultural Attache at the
Cuban Embassy, to attead the meeting held by i (see HMM 6438).

The embarrassment caused by thg,immoratbetavior of Mextcan
female delegates to the Cuban 26 July celebration held in Havana
in 1961 according to Manuel Marcue Parinas of the perlodical
Politica as told to Teresa Proenza Proenza,

D. Liaison

With the approach of the GPIDEAL visit to Mexico 29 June - 1 July,
liaison activities greatly increased, COS visited LITENSOR on 28 June,
LITENSOR assured that there would be no problems in the GPIDEAL visit
i tae safety of GPIDEAL was guaranteed and in the haads of LITENSOR,
this meeting LITENSOR indicated his annoyance with the Cubans, (See
EXT 1253),

LIELEGANT turned over to the Chief of Station a list of persons who
were put under surveillance in connection with the GPIDEAL visit, ‘The list
also indicated those who were arrested, (Sec MEXIs 1244 and 1264),

Acta meeting held on 28 May 1962. the Chief of Station, LIELEGANT,
and LIENVOY/2 met with LIENVOY/L and obtained his agreement to hire
LIENVOY/14 to work under LIENVOY/3 as a technical inspector in Telefonos:
Ge Mexico, The purpose in putting LIENVOY/L4 in this capacity is to have a
ff who would be more available to the LIENVOY Project and who "would see
x thers might be tapping telephones” in Telefonos de Mexico, Further-
more, LIENVOY/I agreed to see to it that LIENVOY/14 would have "the
range and authority” co do the work,

Putting LIENVOY/14 as a technical inspector within Telefonos, could
create problems for the LIFEAT Project. At the same time WILSTED is re~
suadying the LIFEAT system, improving it, tightening up the security and
alerting the base houses to watch for any abnormal activity on present taps,
s been underszood by the LIENVOY fficer that this has been done
xd it will be reported from time to time in future LIENVOY reports,

E, © Security

For a report on security of the LIENVOY site for June 1962, see
peragraph 2 E of HMMA-19319 (RYBAT-1S92) dated 10 July 1962,

As was stated at the end of that paragraph, any surveillance or
security threat of the LIENVOY basehouse or personnel can eventually be
ndled, should this be found necessary, by Chief of Station to LITENSOR,

Remembering the other Fiat at the end of the block, which waa quite
visible from the corner of Panuco ard Itudson, the urderaigned decidad
to delay entry into the safehouse and casually walk down the block.

The undersigued cut across Hudsun Streei tu avoid walking close to the
parked car and as he walked on Lerma, noticed the presence of a alow
moving car behind him. This did cut arouse toe much suspicion since
this area apparently specializes in street walkers and the local "tenorios”
cruise the streets looking for them, As the undersigned reached the
parked Q.P, car at the curner of Lerma aud Duaro the slow moving auto
came abreet of the car and the driver almost atopped and etared at the i
undersigned as ho attempted to uniock the car to depart the area. By

this Umea the undersigned got suspicious and attempted to read the license

noted aa he made tha audden turn inte Miesisaippi that the other rahicle
braked as soon as he passed Minsteatppi and, tt seemed to the under=
signed, was backing up toward Misniavippi. At thia point the undarsigned
poured the coal into the old Green Hornet and left the area, The ondere
signed then want to tha Polanco Bowling Alley instead of home, howled
for approximately az hour aud then returved at 2300 hours ta inspect

tha area of action once more. The area van complotely frou of any

saine schedule of work as reported for April,

H, Production

During May, LIENVOY produced the forty-five (45) positive intel-

25 January 1962

The following message has been received from Haxico Citys
For King and Sayre from Ambassador Mann

1. As you Imoy, somo weeks ayo we bocome convinced that cnly chance
ef getting Mexico to break relations with Cuba would bo on baris Cuban
intervention Mexican intornal affaira. This of course was on agsnption
two thirds Mo treaty vote could not be obtained at Punta Del ete.

2. With this objective in mind Dept and CAS authorized mo to turn \

over materials describod 4n iN 12549 to appropriate Mexican official.
I chose Gustavo DIAd Ordas. a

3. Via! Ordas has informed CAS that ho discussed tis evidence with
Lopas Hatens vio exprecsed surnries and intereat, We discount Lopes Mateos
atatexonts because aa you know ho haa much better evidence of Cuban Embassy
intervention which he keeps strictly to hinself and has nevor told Cabinet
about. the evidence ve turned over to DiAc Orcas has psyottological isportance
vecnuee President 19 now axare that DIAZ Ordaz also knows part of the atory.
He oan vevor be eure that DIAZ Onias vill not use this to supoort his om

‘antiecomuniot convictions if a showiown betwoen tus Comiea and anti-Cormies

should cecur in Mexico.

U. DIAZ Ordas has apked ne through CAS whether I would have any goseation
if the information wa furnished him were mado public should an app7
oceasion arise in tho future. Ke said thore would be no mention of tha WSs
Govt and that Ool:ernacton vould prescnt tha ovidence a6 collected by ite

5. I recommend that CAS and Iept authorize me to inform DIAZ Ordes that
we have no objection on ths basis outlined by him. Season for my raconmend= \
ation 19 that on the one hand we lows little by blowing tho microphone oneration |
sinca battery 1s sohedulod to expire soon in any We believe we are ina!
position where we can safely deny thet we had an)

Phone. In this connection DIAZ Ordas obviously belteves our tory that wo
pieked up sicnal by routine dialing of different frequencics and that microphone
vas prommably rlsced by Loviats to check on their satellites. dn othar hand
affirmative answer to DIAL Ordas will also inplicitly sugsest the cossibility
that the time may cone wien we ourselves might wish to make this information



public, I can think of no better incentive to Lopes Mateoo to break relations
with Cuba than possibility Mexican public might eventually become aware of
extont te which Mexico has tolerated Cuban intervention in spite of ite vaunted
devotion to the doctrine of non-intervention.

6, Finally I wiah to eay that I realise all of these mansuvers involve
some risk to U.S. but I believe resurgence of Communist influence in last two
months requires unusual counteraction on our part.

7. DIAZ Ordas has returned material to CAS for safe keeping and it is
now in our possession, He claims he made no copies and wa believe this probably

REASON FOR MY RECOMMENDATION IS THAT ON THE ONE HAND WE LOSE LITTLE
BY BLOWING THZ MICROPHONE OPERATION SINCE BATTERY IS SCHEDULED
TO EXPIRE SOON It ANY CASE. WE BELIEVE WE ARE IN A POSITION WHERE
WE CAN SAFELY DENY THAT WE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH PLACING MICRO-
PHONE. IN THIS CONNECTION DIAZ ORDAZ OBVIOUSLY BELIEVES OUR STORY
THAT WE PICKED UP SIGNAL BY ROUTINE DIALING OF DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES

ON THEIR SATELLITES. ON OTHER MAND AFFIRMATIVE ANSER TO DIAZ ORDA

WILL ALSO IMPLICITLY SUGGEST THE POSSIDILITY THAT THE TIME MAY COME
