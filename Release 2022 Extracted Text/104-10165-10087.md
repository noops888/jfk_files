pointed out tha? Dr. Milliam McElroy,

director of ine National Science Foun-

dent of the National Academy of

sciences, had suggested that they maise

a trip joindy to China. This view was

part of the feeling in science quarters

in Washington that an exchange oi

between boih countries

would be very benefirial to the thro

countries even though all sorts of un

derstandings would hive to tale place..-

This was the reasoning expressed by

President Nixon's science advisor, DI.

Edward Davis, Jr.

Up to this point there has beea

no official Govemme,l effost to

initiate exchanges and an early ap

praisal of Ims possiblity indicates that

finance any sizeable program. Never-

theless, those on the scene say these

passage of an emergency request for

funds to see that such a scientific.

Administraion,

which credits itself

with the break-through which led to

the ping peag matches, is certain to

push harder-for a more forceful er.

open, even if the Administration has

to finance an exchange from funds

which it might consider of an emergen-
