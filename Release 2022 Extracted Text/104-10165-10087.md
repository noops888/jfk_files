Biomedical, biological, and natural
scientists are e2ger to survey the sciea-
lifie scene. At the same time it wes
pointed out that Dr. William McElroy,
Girector of the National Science Foun-
dation, and Dr. Philip Handler, presi-
dent of the National Acztemy of
Sciences, hed suggested that they make
8 Wtip joinzy to China. This view wes
part of the feeling in science quarters
in Washinzton that an exchange of
scientists between both countries
would be very beneficial to the two
countries even though all sorts of un
derstandings would hive to take place.
This was the ressoniog expressed by
President Nixon's science advisor,.Dr.
Edward Davis, Jr.

Up to this point there has been
80 official Governmest effort to
initiate exchanges and an early ep-
Praisal of this possibility indicates that

would have to be obtained to
finance any sizeable program. Never-
theless, those on the scene say these
could probably come fron founda-
_ tions, It is even quite possible that
the White House would push for early
posers of an emergency request for
ds to sce that such a_ scientific:
venture got underway. The present

Administration, which credits itself -

with the break-through which led to
the ping peng matches, is certain to
push harder for a more forceful ex-
‘change nov: that the door is slightly
‘open, even if the Administration has
to finance an: exchange from funds
which it might consider. of an emergea-
_¢y nature.

But the ». papers remained undisturbed
after it became known that an ex-
change was far in the future.

‘The Committee on Scholarly Com-

tensely. Headed by Dr. John Lindbeck

data has cea accumulated, all indi-

The Autume Csnton Trade Fair

recently pave some indication of the
tends in China. Among the changes
noted were the 30 per cent increase in
customers and the Chinese favoritism
fer West Europcan countries, especio0y
France and Italy, at Japan's expense.
Exhibits at the fir reflected numerous
technological advances over the pre-
vious year. Among the displays were
silicon-controlied automatic electronic
and punch-tape-controll2d tools, meas
uring and testing instruments, oscillo-
scopes, microscopes, and a wide range
of synthetic plastics, resins and such
basic drugs as antibiotics, sulphur
drugs and vitamins.

‘The revolution in Chinese education
kas produced many schools such as
the Shantong University of Science
znd Technology in Tsinan which
opened Jast October.

Chairman “Mao's thinking along
medical Tines is responsible for. the
“cooperative medical service” intended
to bring medical treatment to all rural
areas. It has been reported that one-

" third of a million city medical workers

and graduates of medical colleges have
setded in rural areas while 400,000.
others were organized into mobile
medical teams to tend rural areas.
‘This has prompted shifting of some
hospitals from large metropolitan cen
ters to the country. The Hailung zrea,
it is reported, hus set up a so-called
“ted medical network” designed to en-

jyabic each production team and factory

to have its own. highly publicized
“barefoot doctors.”

Ia another area all medical schoot.
graduates have been dispatched to the
‘countryside und one-half of the modi-
cal workers .in Harbin, Tsitshibar,

Shanghai recently has been the scene

taking serious note of the pepulation

result of a 15-year birth control cam-

contraception, abortion, sterilization
and encouragement of the late mar-

halved its earlier population growth
