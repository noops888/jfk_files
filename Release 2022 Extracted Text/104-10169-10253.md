Paraphrase of the source's story: I do not have a high
* pegard for the GIA sr for most of “the exiled Cubans but
I am egainat the Castro regimefor which reason I have
become involved in these mattcr about which I must be
sure the CIA is informed. I contacted the INS and the ree
FBI because through them I could ensure contact with a .

“responsible CIA officer. saat

I Was a good friend of Rolando CUBELAS. We conspired
» together against BATISTA and we planned assassinztions
of Batista supporters. We carried out the killing of
one of the SIM chiefs, Rid6-Gatan, successfully-. A lot
thio“ things the the. anti-HATISTA students did were not
ffective but we did more than talk and this old
gesaeination is proof that people like Rolando and myself

something very important, that it involved Rolando CU3ELAS, Fe
that Rolando wanted me to: go to Paris on an urgent matter,

truth, wnat I an telling you is what I found out fron
El Loco, confirred tateé through Eliaco RO!REN0, and

Sa
confirred in part through questioning ethers who ‘now
parts of the story but not all of it.

Rolando CUSELAS Plans to kill Fiddl and Raul CASTRO and
other key men in the regime. Rolando kas a house at
Veradero Beach adjacent to the house of Fidel, so it is
easy for Rolando to ret Fidel anytime. The idea is not

gor Rolando has the cooperation of other peoplewhose names

By do not know km except for El “oco Blanco and El Rago
Robreno and ALIEIDA, Rolanfdo is very security consc#dus
so he does not want people involved to know any more than
ois necessary, You must understand the danger to these people.: ~~ 7

what I can tell you now is that El Loco has his faults and

30 does ROARENAO but both worship Rolando and are trustworthy at
insofar as he 1s concerned. El Loco is back inside Cuba now,
El Mago Robreno is in Madrid and can get messages in andout,. -:) -— ot
