MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel
THROUGH :_ Deputy Directos’ for Support

SUBJECT 3 Narrative Fitness Report
5 James P. O'Connell
Chief, Executive Staff

1, Mr. O'Connell has served as Chief, Executive Staff of
this Office from 1 April 1967 to 31 March 1968, the rating period
covered by this Fitness Report. : :

2, Mr. O'Connell has been most effective in the administration
and direction of the complex’ and varicd activities encompassed in the
functions in the Executive Staff of this Office. He has been effective
in directing the staff in'the formuilation and implementation of basic
security policies and procedures. In addition, he has performed
diligently in continuing review of the considerable volume of paper
that transits the Office of the Director of Security. He has been
meticulous in ensuring that staff work and correspondence leaving
this office is up to the highest standards and has been very effective
in arranging priority action in mecting short deadlines, As the
initial professional recipient of the majority of correspondence
received by this Office for action, he has been very effective in
applying his knowledge of the basic organization of the Office to the
assignment of action with appropriate coordination.

3. Mr. O'Connell is‘a personable and articulate senior
executive who writes particularly well, He has had extensive
experience as a Security careerist, both in Headquarters and
overseas, and his career has been marked by rather rapid advance -
ment and a record of fine performances in positions of increasing
responsibility. Ihave no reservations abaut rating his performance
in this position over the past year as OUTSTANDING

EVES GLY
SECRET

a



SECRET =

4. In searching for an area where Mr. O'Connell might strive
for further improvement, I am hard put to find any in the light of
his consistently high performance record, Ido believe, however,
that Mr. O'Connell has lost or appears to have lost some of his
enthusiasm and eager initiative which marked his performance tor
the first six months in this position, It is possible that this is due
to the fact that the problems we encounter today require more
measured and considered judgment as opposed to enthusiasi~ and
initiative, Nonetheless I would like to see Mr. O'Connell strive
for a better balance in these essential performance characte risties

4. In searching for an area where Mr. O'Connell might strive
for further improvement, I am hard put to find any in the light.of
his Consiatently high performance record. I do believe, however,
that. Mr. O'Connell has lost or appears to have lost some of his
enthusiasm and eager initiative which marked his performance for
the first six-months in this position. It is possible that this is due
to the fact that the problems we encounter today require more
measured and considered judgment as opposed to enthusiasm and
initiative, Nonetheless I would like to see Mr, O'Connell strive
for a better balance in these essential performance characteristics

fer this key position in the Office of Security and has already begun to

(Fitness Report)

This is an annual Fitness Report on the above employee
for the period ending 9 January 1967. Mr. O'Connell was reas-
signed from Assistant Deputy Director of Security (IOS) to Chief,
Security Policy and Executive Staff, and the Director of Security
will add comments for the remainder of the rating period ending
31 March 1967.

As Assistant to the DDS(IOS), Mr. O'Connell applied excep-
tional executive talent in sharing with me the responsibility for
the direction of the investigative and operational support programs
in the Office of Security. It is felt that Mr. O'Connell made an
outstanding contribution to the management of IOS at a time of

_the heaviest work pressures in our history. Mr. O'Connell has

a calm, clinical approach to work problems, and his solutions to
these problems reflect the soundness of his judgment and the
breadth of his experience. He expresses himself clearly and con-
cisely in both writing and speech. As Assistant DDS(IOS), he
demonstrated sound management concepts and acute cost con-
sciousness, His strength as a supervisor is reflected in the
universal respect he enjoys among all subordinates,

I regard Mr, O'Connell's performance as ADDS(IOS) as

"Outstanding."

ability to meet and solve conyplex administrative problems, I have

Acting D/COS, He served in ste capacity from carly

April until his departure on 16 June 1965,

2, Within a matter of days he was performing
the assigned duties in a superior manner. He most
certainly demonstrated sound judgment, dependability
and mature tolerance. The latter is an essential for

the daily problems unique to any post type service.

3. As to his executive or leadership qualities
I believe I can save several paragraphs by stating
simply that within a week of assuming his new assign-
ment I left on a G-day TDY¥ and within 30 days de-
parted south for over 3 weeks. and in each case departed
with abgolute assurance the Station was in good hands,

and it Was.

his grade, the organization's mid-career program would probably be
more effective than some external programs.

WASHINGTON

Dear Shef,

I would like to take this opportunity to belatedly
express the sincere appreciation of both my office and
the Broadcasting Service of this Agency for the assist-
ance rendered by employees of your staff, Mr, James
O'Connell and Mr, Exvon Kuhnke in September and
December of last year, This assistance consisted of
picking up tape recordings prépared by Radio Moscow
in the possession of Mr, Paul Frederick Dauer, 1923
De La Vina Street, Santa Barbara, California and
delivering them to my office for the information of our
Broadcasting Service, In addition to this service, Mr.
Kulmke of your staff readily volunteered to see that
these tapes were returned to Mr. Dauer and this
latter service was performed last month.

The excellent spirit of Maison co-operation
evidenced by your staff is most gratifying to me and
it is hoped that I might be of service in some similar
matter in the future,

Sincerely,

Peul J, MeNichol, Director
