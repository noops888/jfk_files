A I think Saul was there about a year and a half. He

left in 1968 when we reduced the size of the Station. Let's

say Henze was there from 1966 to 1968. And then Jake Esterlind.

He was Chief of Station from 1968 to 1973.

And then, I believe after that it became the Cuban Operations

Group.

Q Now, was this a special group within the DDO or was

it attached to one of the area divisions?

A No. Following the Bay of Pigs, they created a thing

called Task Force W which was headed by Bill Harvey. And

of Station, Rome,.

that -- when Harvey left, he went to

It wasn't attached to anything except -- it reported to the

was first created. Helms was DDP at that time.

2 And Task Force W was created immediately after the

Bay of Pigs?
vA Weil, not immediately. I think sometime around ~=

_in the Bay of Pigs was in April. I think this was created in

September, something like that, 1961.

A You mean prior to. the Bay of Pigs?
Q Yes.
A I really don't know. It was a small -- it was a

forward base and it was more or less as I recall, a support typ

thing.

Q Well, after the Bay of Pigs when Task Force W was

established, did it have sole responsibility for Cuban

operations?

A Yes.

Q Or was that shared with the Miami base, Miami
Station?

A No. The Miami Station was under Task Force W.

2 All right. Would that also be true of the Special

Activities Staff, the Cuban Operations Group?

A Right, except that at the present time the Station

has no Cuban operations.

Q I understand that. When were Cuban operations termi-
nated? 7
A At the Station? Let's see. Sternfield went down

there in 1972. It was during fiscal year '72. I think it was
in early 1973. It was a gradual reduction.
Q And have those operations been terminated entirely

or are they now run out of the Washington area?

A All Cuban operations are run out of Washington.

a ves, and I really can’t recall some of the other
people. We were -- we aad just moved the Station at that time,

in Paris, out of the Embassy into the old Rothschild Palace

Mr.i Sanchez -- was he a member of the military?

Sanchez was..in the ‘Special Activities Staff.

He was stationed in Washington. And he was in contact with

Cuban military+type.

Q Was it your understanding that the Agency had received

instructions with respect to this activity from another

ij component ef the Government?

A Well, let me put it this way. I don't know whether

| they received instructions. I have to assume, and I am pretty

positive, that this was a result of a Special Group decision.

Q Me. Sturbitts, are you familiar with a gentleman by

‘

the name of Frank Sturgis?

A No. It is what is contained in the files.

ie] Have you caused a search to he made of CIA files,

particularly the files of the Western Hemisphere Division,
in an attempt to determine whether Mr. Sturgis ever had any
connection with the Agency?

A T have.

Q What were the results of that search?
A Absolutely no connection, never has been.
re) When we talk about connection, are we talking about

an employment relationship?

the Agency?

A No.

A I can't speak to that but the records

somebody in that context, knowing that there is a 201 file

on Sturgis, they would have to coordinate with the Latin

American Division before they did anything since we do hold

as a result of other agency reporting and that type of thing..

a

H beat captain eventually. And he did participate in infiltrations

i

sabotage-type actions against Cuba. Sturgis never engaged in

any cf these things. He never did it for us nor did he ever

r
i do it on any of our boats, planes, or ~~ anything that belongs

i te the Agency. i

1

his instructions and briefings from his Case Officer.

along on any of these operations? ’

foreign subsidiary of an American company cannot trade with
the country that is designated and Cuba was a designated country.
And all the businessmen were well aware of this. Nobody tried
to twist their arm. i
Q Other than insuring that these companies refused
to accept orders from Cuba, which I take it you feel they were
legally constrained from doing, what other types of support did
you receive from American business? |
A Well, if American business -- sometimes they would
receive correspondence, particularly, say, from -- well, they |
received it from Cuba asking for publications and this type
of thing. They would normally forward all this type of thing
to the Commerce Department and the Treasury Department, or in
some instances they might call me and I would just give them
a Post Office box to send the correspondence to.
Q Any other types of support solicited or received by
the Agency from American business?
A No. Not that I can recall. There just wasn't one
firm we approached, and God knows we approached I don't know
how many, that wasn't extremely cooperative. As a matter of
fact, a lot of them, you know, thought we weren't doing enough,
that we ought to do a little more than we were doing, the

shortly after the Bay of. Bigs?

at their height during the period about 1963 through, say,
1967. The program was terminated in 1968, I think in December
1968, something like that.

the tides had to be right, the meon had to be in the proper

! to the Soviet Union and I forget exactly now what happened to

it but I know that it got a hole below the waterline, or

something, and had to put into Puerto Rico for repairs.

In order to repair it, I guess, and get it in the

drydock or wherever it was, they had ta remove the sugar and

put it in the. warehouse and at that time I guess somebody came
up with a plan to try to widen the rift between -- there was
a rift at that time between the Soviets and Cubans and to

put a harmless substance into the sugar that would make it
acid, sour tasting, and it wouldn't harm the sugar or the
individual, and some of this was done. And then when it
leaked, of course, we had to get rid of it and we had a sugar

firm buy it back from the Soviets. ! photocopy from

Q Which of these activities, if any , of them were
actually being conducted within the Cuban community in Miami?

counterintelligence. |

activities in the Miami area?

A Yes, sir.

Q Can you give me an example of the kinds of counter-
intelligence activities that the Agency would be conducting
in that area or was conducting in the area at that time?
H A Well, we had a number of joint operations, as I
recall, with the Bureau. We had identified a‘Castro agent shay
came in by small boat and when she was -- she came in ‘with a {
number of other people. When she hit the -~- they had a recep-

we did, too. Our people from the DDO were under

cover. When the UEW people did the

out forms, where were you born, this type of thing, biegraphic+

look at the forms and based on previous experience or what
they might have been doing, ad they felt that perhaps they

It was in this manner that this gal came to our
knowledge. We surveilled her for a long time and determined
that obviously she was receiving messages. and she was
sending messages. So along with the Bureau we put a surveillance
on her and we obtained a van with DF equipment in it and Hy
indeed, she went on the air in the morning at 5:00 o'clock
or 4:30 or whatever it was, and the direction finder found
it was being beamed toward Cuba, this type of thing, and that
was cen of the examples of the CI activities we were involved |
in. ,

Q Were there many activities of that type?

A Not really. You have got to remember that the
Bureau's Cuban squad was fairly small. I mean, it was a large |
squad in terms of FBI squads. It had 36 people on it, some-
thing like that, but 36 people trying to follow a couple of
hundred thousand Cubans around, you know, it is pretty nega-
tive. This was one of the reasons that obviously from --"
in those days when we had formed these revolutionary fronts
which were being run by the Cuban exiles, they were reporting
to Case Officers and they would report on things in the
community, of people they thought were suspect and this type
of thing. These leads in turn were then given to the Bureau
and it was to this extent that we got ourselves involved
in CI activity.

Q Would it be fair to say that the involvement in CI

activities in that area was primarily a function of the over-
whelming number of these people and the Bureau's inability
to properly staff the thing?
A ‘Yes, yes. You have got to remember, too, that a lot
of the people on that Cuban squad were in the legal section
of the Embassy in Havana. You know, the FBI overseas is
known as Legal Attaches, obviously working out of the Embassy
the same as our Station was, and a lot of our Station officers
from Havana were down in Miami at that time. So there was a
relationship there that had gone over a period of years
between the Agency and the Bureau.
MR.MANFREDI: We will reconvene at 1:00 o'clock.

A

A Really, they are both -- the only reason we separated
the two groups was for security because we had one group housed |

that is why wetook the smaller establishment to preserve some

of intelligence. They compiled dossiers on the principals
inside Cuba, They carded -- they kept card files on every .
refugee that came throuch the reception center. They provided +-
they did do economic and social reporting. They put out a
