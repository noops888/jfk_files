Bulet, December 29, 1966, requested comments, ob-
servations, and recommendations, as to further investigation.

: It is, therefore, respectfully submitted that
results of investigation in New York area, as. requested
in this report, will, to a great extent, determine the future
course of investigation. Therefore, recommendations as to
further investigation will be submitted on receipt of New

York report. iat

* The question to be resolved is whethér or not
subject is presently a Cuban Intelligence Service (CIS)
agent. A review of material in this report, and in reports ~
previously submitted, would tend to show that subject could
have functioned as such, Considering CIS targets, subject's
activities in thé Miami area in 1959 and 1960, prior to the
time he went to New.York, are highly suspect.» He seems to ‘
have been able to disrupt eVery attempt by. anti-CASTRO organi-
zations to organize or unify. For example, not only-did he
denounce the Frente Revolucionario Democratico (FRD), as
well as its leader, MANUEL ANTONIO VARONA, as a tool of. the
Communists, he also said he had withdrawn support of GARCIA
KOHLY, SR., and his Cuban Liberating Commandos, after associ-
ating with_-KOHLY in Washington, D. C. When questioned about
individual units in’ the KOHLY organization, ECHEGOYEN said
he had either withdrawn his support of .KOHLY, or that he, |
ECHEGOYEN, could furnish no additional information concerning

each individual unit. This information was previously submitted (Qu

of the Cuban Air Force. It is possible that the Bureau -

has more information on this point concerning subject
and DIER in June, 1959, and subsequent period.

és There could have been also attempts to plant
information such as the information originally furnished

by subject to GEORGE TODT, Herald Express, columnist, e
in Los Angeles, California, May 9, I961, that he,

ECHEGOYEN, had received a code message from Cuba to the

effect that the Cuban Government imported printing

equipment from East Germany via Czechoslovakia capable of

counterfeiting $50.00 and $100.00 bills in U. S, currency.
~The above has been reported previously.
