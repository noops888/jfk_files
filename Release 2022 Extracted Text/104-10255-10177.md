A. It hag been the experience in similar cages
that certsin consulates will NOT issue visas to their
countries to persons applying for them in one city and
holding pagsperts and I-94 forme shoving permanent or even
temporary addresses in another city.

B. Tho fect that subject resides in the WAVE srea
should pose no particular problem in his being
backstopped in alias in the same city. Yor example,
AMMUG/1 resided in true neme in the ZRNETAL area and
at the sane time was backxstopped in alias in the same
