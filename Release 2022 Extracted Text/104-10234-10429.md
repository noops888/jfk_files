REF ACCOUNT MEETING WITH BLANCO MOST INTERESTING AND THOUGHT-
PROVOKING. BASIC QUESTION IN BLANCO CASE IS WHETHER HE LOYAL TO
AMLASH/1 OR WHETHER THIS CLEVER CUBAN RUSE TO GET PROOF AMLASH/1 AND

E ACCOMPLICES LINKED TO ODYOKE. FYI, IT KNOYN CUBANS SEEKING EXPLOITABLE

al Garrep wines y
W SENSATION FOR PRESENTATION TO,CxG3, AND IT NOT UNFEASIBLE WRAP-UP OF

AMLASH/1 COMPLEX WOULD PROVIDE THIS PEG, PARTICULARLY IN VIEW SEVERAL
- REPORTS FROM VARIOUS SOURCES THAT AMLASH GROUP SEEKING VIOLENT OVER-
THROW CASTRO GOVT. (11 FOLLOFS THEREFORE, IF WORD OUT REFUGEE CIRCLES,
"> Goe MUST ALSO BE AWARE RUMORS.) i

2, WITH ABOVE IN MIND, HQS WISHES KEEP BLANCO ISOLATED FROM ANY

FOR PROOF ODYOXE INVOLVED WITH auase? REGARDLESS WHETHER HE CLEAN OR
KOT, ACCORDING HQS RECORDS, ONLY AMWHIP/1 AND UNSNAFU/9, AND PERHAPS

AMWHIP/2 AWARE KUBARK TIES WITH AMLASH/1 OPERATION, UNFORTUNATELY, IT

“NOP KNOWN OTHER THAN AMVHIP/1'S WORD WHETHER ANLASH/2 KNOVLEDGEABLE, af
