MEMURAMNOUM FOR: Directer of Central Intelligence
Viar Deputy Director (Plans)

SUBIOCT: - ; Operational Exploitation of Khrushchev Visit te Cuba

t, This memorandum ig for the Director's information only ard dozs
not require action.

2. An invitation by the Government of Cuba to Khrushchev to visit
that country hae been officially accepted, but as yet no definite time has
been set. There has been speculation that Khrushchev wesld arrive In
Habana for the 26th of July celebrations, while a preas report, confirming
a statement of the Soviet Ambzasader In Mexico, predicts the arrival for
August, Earler reports had suggested December 1¢60 or January 17461
as possible dates.

3. His felt that a successful visit by Zhrushchey te Cuba would assist
further in the establishment af a solid Sovict understanding with that country,
with distarbing overtones on the possible establishment of claser Soviet
relationships in other parts of Latin America, For this reason it le
desirable to prevent the visit or to counteract it by a show of massive
opposition by the Cuban poople. i

4 On21 June the Habana Station was asked for its views on pos:
plans. In the exchange of cables that has followed, the Station and Hea
are now in agreement that the best course of action lies in two operations.
First, a massive church manifestation or rally to be called for some other
purposs would afford the people of Cuba an obvious way to expresa their
protest, Second, the instigation of rarners that Khrushchev's life will be
in danger while in Guba from a well-planned assassination attempt would
be propagated from other Latin American countries.

5. Because of the nee? of avoiding action in Cubs in this crateert
would imperil Station assets, it has been Jetermined that such asaets wo
be used only aa a means of iustigating the church to hold the rally.

6. The latest report from Ha! indicates that plans are going
satisfactorily. (pionop Boza Maaviiad) lis described as enthused about the
ob


ope

idea, {th Lavasitda) &@ prominant ley leader, he is now visiting

7 to solicit the sduport of the local Blehep. Lavastidd » iL. seek

3. ‘Tho Station hag asked that the entire effert begin with Cuba,
without initial cutside support from Cuban exile groupa or the soontore Gi
the anti-Castro programs on Station WRUL. A cable has been sent(to /¢.

2 July 1960

TO 3 CAH/,
Subject: Khrushchev Visit to Cuba

1. Background, An invitation to visit Cuba has been extended
to Khrushchev by the Government of Cuba, The invitation has been
accepted, but do definite time has been set. There has been sons
speculation that Khrushchev would arrive in Havana in time for the
celebrations of the 26th of July. The press has reported that he
will-arrive in August (a date confirmed by a statement of the Soviet
‘Ambassador in Mexico), Other reports say the visit will not teke
place for several months, probably in December or January. In any
event we mst plan for the possibility of the July visit.

It has been stated from several sanguine quarters that we
should "do the ssme thing to Khrushchev that the Japs did to Eisen-
hower", This is a completely unrealistic dream,

It is true that a successful Khrushchev visit to Cuba
would be the final stone in the construction of a solid Soviet
base in Cuba, with disturbing overtones for the possible construction
for more Soviet ideoligical bases in all.of Latin America, For that
reagon we are trying to do what we can to prevent the visit, or at
least to show a maseive sk opposition to it.

1
2. Exploiteti@nPlana. On 21 dune Hqs sent a cable to Havana
asking for views on possibility of a major effort to force cancellation
of the visit. A resulting series of cables shows thst the station and
headquarters are row in agreement that our best hope lies in

a. A massive Church manifestation or rally, which
though called for some other purpose, would be to the people
of Cuba an obvious way to express their protest, And

b. from outside Cuba, instigating of rwnors that
Khrushchev's life will be in danger fe from a well-plenned
assassination attempt.

3. Mr. Helms has teld x us that he wants CIA to underteke no
action that will imperil Station eseets. This injunction was placed
on us vhile we were exchanging cables with Havana, The result is that
station agsets are actively instigatiry the church to hole the rally.
A BREZESTH cable from Headquarters hee instructed the station to
continue this course of action as long as there is "safety in numbers",
i.e., as long as it is a church action rather that an AMPALM one.

4. The latest cable fron the field (IN 18883) Coports that
that plans are going satisfactorily. fisenop Boza_Masvi is Ht
gm "enthused" about the idea, With(Jose Lavasti ae Ba prominent
lay leader, he is now visiting Camaqtey to solici: @ support of
the local £=:8 Bishop. ose Lavastidgy~e promient lay leader, is
in Santiago to seek thevhelp k of the Santéago Bishop, Tentative
plans call for a congress or rally on Assumption Day, 15 July.

The station has esked that the entire effort at least
-begin within Cuba, without ouside support from FRD or WRUL.

eq
5. Hemisphere Plang. A cable has gone out to CELAM) (in o-"
Bogota, asking this Church organization to spark similar rallies
thr out Latin America. JMRAKE assets will be called upon to
support these and the Cuban necting when pm plans ere ij hite

7 193, the assagsination REsk angle: (tions) a
controlled age! t (in B A), is soon to visit high officials in
Havana. He has ben inetructed to ask these leaders what sub-
stance there might be to the rumore he has heard that an attempt
will take place.....Rivas, a friend of Rudy Gomes, is using the
sane £atixtoemcterx technique through three Cubans living in Miami
who are constant contact with Cuba.

Speculation on the assassinationattempts will be surfaced
on the WRUL progrem, in AMPACA'S paper, etc.
