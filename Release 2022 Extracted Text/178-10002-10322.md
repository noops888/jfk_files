And are you a Ph.D. or a medical doctor?

I'm a physician.

And you were in the Technical Services Division

I was not.

In what area were you?

I'm a medical officer.

Oh, vou were the manical nfficer for the Agency?

And when did you leave the Agency?

I retired in--well, I think now is--1971.

G:

B:

Yes.

I'11--We talked about the development of pills which

might have contained a type of poisoning which were

developed inside the Agency for possible use against a speci-

fic foreign leader. Were you aware of any such development?

G:

B:

G:

I was aware that certain--or a pill--was prepared,

but I have no way of knowing what was in the pill.

Do you have any knowledge of at whose direction the

pill was prepared?

He late no gyps it old are to be supposed,

B:

Did you have any conversations with Mr. Bissell,

or is this just your assumption? If you can remember.

G:

Well, the Technical Services Division came under

Mr. Bissell, and I was aware--I believe I was aware

of his interest or his knowledgeability after the pill had

been prepared.

B:

Nege of ava bull the now eageability- the know-

G:

B:

No, I was not.

Were you aware of the knowledge of possibly any

people in the White House 'at the time?

G:

B:

No, I would not be in a position to know that.

Now, you do believe that the pills were developed,

Is that correct?

G:

B:

I know that some pills were made available and I

know that at least one set--I don't know--I know

that there were pills prepared, yes, but I--exactly the

content I would have no way of knowing.

To the best of your recollection, were the pills--

wound they have been fatal if taken by a human

G:

Well, since I had been interested in the protection

of human beings against such things, why I did test

them against some guinea pigs, and at least one batch did not

have any effect on guinea pigs.

B:

G:

But there was a subsequent batch that did?

A subsequent batch, one out of four guinea pigs did

depart.

B:

G:

B:

Do you remember about what time, whether this was in

1959, or 1960 or 61 or 62, any particular time that

stands out in your mind?

None rout than he pretably in the '59 or "60

Do you know whether or not these--there were ever

nything other than these pills prepared that migh

ave--for use against a human beino

A particular

human being -- such as a foreign leader?

G:

B:

I believe that this same-the substance that I was told

was in the pills was applied--or supposedly made a

part of some cigars.

That was possibly to be used against the same person?

Yes.

And was there an actual box of cigars put together,

do you know?

G:

I know there was a box of cigars and--in other words,

I first was told there was a box of cigars, I saw a

completely unopened box of cigars sometime later I saw what

appeared to be the same box still unopened, but I was led to

believe that they had been improved.

B:

Is there a possibility the first box of cigars might

have had a substance that might not have killed

someone but might have affected behavior whereas the second

box of cigars they had a substance that could have killed

someone?

G:

Well, using the word "possible", yes. But I have

no--I have no thoughts that makes me think that this

was the case.

B:

Do you think in both cases it was to try and kill

someone?

€:

B:

B:

G:

B:

G:

I think the first case was of items before they had

been treated and the second was supposedly the same

items that had been treated. That was my understanding.

Oh, I see.

Do you know what eventually happened to

the cigars?

They were destroyed, completely.

Do you know what eventually happened to the pills?

No, I don't.

Do you know if the cigars were prepared before or

after the pills?

My recollection is that they were after, but really

at this state I can't be sure. I think it was after.

Is there any other information you have that might

in any way be relevant to any allegations that the

CIA engaged in plans involving assassination of any foreign

engage thy are one in c

leader. that you think might be relevant?

G:

I never had heard inference of any other potential

target--

B:

Other than the particular target for which the

cigars and the pills were prepared?

G:

Yes. That's right.

B:

Do you have any other knowledge about that particular

target that you think might be relevant? That noise

you hear is the end of the tape, and I'm going to have to put

another tape on, but you have about ten seconds left before

I do.

G:

B:

I don't think directly. You are bound to hear

things, but I have never been one that just takes

something I hear and put any weight on it.

All right. I'm going to just have to conclude on

one more tape if you'd hold on a minute please.

Is there any other thing that you can think of,

whether I've asked it or not that is any way relevant

to any inquiries of this Commission?

G:

Not that I know of. I would be happy to have anyone

come here and I'll talk with them to the best of my

ability.

This morning I asked/whether or not it would be

possible for you to come to Washington and you in-

involved any other target other than the particular

target that these pills were involved on?
