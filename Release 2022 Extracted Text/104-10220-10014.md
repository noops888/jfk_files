3, The artivlo does not make clear whether or not
NAGELL ie back,.dn Germany at the momont, nor do we have any
information regarding hiv present whereabouts, other than
the stitement in tle articlo that he is probably now in the
Unitod States, The Public Safety Ofticer/USBER advises us,
however, that subsequent to his release from prison in East
Germany in Octobor 1968 he aeatn visited West Berlin and con=
tacted the Public Safoty Office where he complained about
not being able to locate his children,

4, There are no Berlin Base traces on the author of
the article, Thomas C, LUCEY, Since the article appenre to
be an effort to discredit the U.S, Government and certain
officials of the govornment we would appreciate roceiving
any traces which Iicadquarters or the German Station may have,
