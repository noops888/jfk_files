SUBJECT: Alpha 66 Frogmen (C)

5 November 1962

le w Capt Hubbard called undersigned at 1000,3 November. He
said he had spent a great deal of time talking with Veciana and Veciana
had agreed to try and get the two men to Miami for Hubbard to meet.
Veciana had asked if we gwould pay the expense of the boat, since it was
not in their budget. Although Veciana specified that only Hubbard could
see the men, Hubbard said he was going to “turn them over" to him and he
thought we could inject the Navy man into the debriefing.

2. (§) Hubbard had tentatively agreed to this arrangement. The
bhat cost is estimated at $300. Veciana was to proceed to Mjami as planned
on 3 Nowember. From there he was to arrange for the exit of the two
frogmen. Hubbard asked if we could provide assistance through INS if it
became necessary. I said we would try. I suggested that Hubbard wait in
Puerto Rico for Veciana to call from Miami, saying he had the two men there,
before he proceeded to Miami. He also said that Veciana had offered to take
him to thé island base of Alpha 66 to look around. Hubbard noted that
while he was talking with Veciana, he Wad turned down a $5000 offer im
by CBS to send a camera crew to the island. Hubbard strongly recommended
that he be permitted to go. He asked that if he was permitted to go that
we obtain for him a life jacket with dye markers and shark repellent.

35 95 Undersigned discussed these developments with Maj Swafford and
Maj Drashpil. Our consensis of opinion was that Hubbard should be allowed ©
to go ahead, that tdumx Navy not be notified until the men were in Miami.
Hubbard was notified of this about 1100, 3 November, prior to seeigg
Veciana off on the plahe.

he Ca Col Boyt directed that a letter be written to Operations Branch
requesting a policy decision on Capt Hubbard's trip to the base. Subsequently
Capt Hybbard called at 1500 hours, 7 November to say he had had a call grom
Veciana saying he and the two frogmen would arrive by boat in Miami about
1000, 8 Nov. Hubbard is going to Miami early 8 Nov (EAL Flight 150, 0917
arrival Miami). He will meet the boat. Maj Watlington was notified of these
developments and “he will meet Hubbard at the plane. It was suggested to
Maj Watlington that Lt Stein accompany Hubbard to meet the boat if feasible.
Hubbard will call us when the men are in his cusfody, at which time we will
notify Navy. This course of action agreed upon by Lt Col Daugherty.

De G iVeciana was contacted as scheduled. The boat with the frogmen
was supposédly/ 70 milés offshore. Hubbard did not go out to meet the boat
and instructed Veciiana to try and get the frogmen to shore. Veciana promised
to be back in Miami late 9 November

i 6, Hubbard called at 0700, 10 Nov and repor’
Stein had just finished debriefing the leaier of the attack on that date.

A full report was being prepared and placed in the mail to us that date.

The leader reported that he passibly could get the two frogmen in three or
four days: - they were out on "another mission" at present. Hubbard said that
he would call Lt Col King later in the day to give him a full report. As to
guidance whether he should stay on in hopes of meeting him, I referred him to
King, saying it was all right if King approved.

® About 1430 hours, 10 Nov. I contacted King in PR. He had
just returned from his survey trip of the Caribbean, I filled him in on
the developments with Alpha 66 and gave him a full briefing on the policy
and thinking here as we knew it at that time. King said he understood
perfectly, was interested in exploiting this opportunity and would proceed
as he saw fit.

8. & On 13 Nov a cable from CIA was received outlining purported
differences between Alpha 66 and SFDE. (Filed in Pfutner SD). Based on
this there szemed little point in working with Alpha 66 or Veciana. Therefore
I talked with DeGagne (King being absént) and explained the situation to
him, then spoke with Hubbard in Miami. Hubbard stated he was aware of all
this information and that it was his opinion that Veciana enjoyed a
position equally as high as Menoyo in the SFDE movement now. Further he
had talked with Menoyo.

9. ( With these aiditional facts, matter was again discussed with
Lt Col Daugherty as it now appeared we were working with SFDE and with
an organization with the capability to assist in emplacing agents should
we be allowed to proceed with such actions. A file check was condiicted
revealing a 1961 ISR on Menoyo. An ISR check (priority) was submitted on
Veciana (although we have no present dealing with him). Veciana, of course,
was initially contacted to assist in obtaining the frogmen and not for a
clandestine purpose.

10. hy The debriefing of Menoyo was received on 1) Nov. Pending a
resolution of the case, Hubbard returned to Puerto Rico on 1) Nov at 1230
hours from Miami

1800 hours, 15 Nov and passed on the message. Grover and Pat were called
in Puerto Rico about 1930 hours. The message was passed on with word that
if there were any change in plans, the Miami contact must know by 0830 hours
16 Nov. Grover was told that he still had not received permission for the

from CIA. There is an OI. In verbal conversation between Lt Col Daugherty
and Mr Sherwood on 15 Nov it was firmly established in Sherwood's mind
that we have a priority of interest on Menoyo and are contacting him in
the U.S. Further, Sherwood reported that the PM people were the ones with
an OI on VECIANA and he promised to look into the mafter to see if there
might be the possibility of some modus vivendi for his use.

6 On 16 Nov Maj Watlington informed this office that Lt Col King
and Capt Hubbard were in Mjami. On 19 Nov, Major Watlington informed us that
they had both departed on 17 Nov. (see attached Memo).

8.|\NoF% On 22 Nov I réceived a phone call from Lt Col King in Miami.
He said both he and Capt Hubbard had just returned and would leave for
Puerto Rico that day. He was sending two rolls of colored film that date
from Miami to us for processing. He wpuld prepare his report as soon as he
reached Puerto Rivo. He réported no unusual occurénces and he had not
been further than the base. They did not bring back any material.
