5 November 1962

SUBJECT: Alpha 66 Frogmen (C)

1. (#) Capt Hubbard called undersigned at 1000,3 November.

He

said he had spent a great deal of time telking with Veciana and Veciana

had agreed to try and get the two men to Miami for Hubbard to meet.

Veciana had asked if we would pay the expense of the boat, since it was

not in their budget. Although Veciana specified that only

Hubbard could

see the men, Hubbard said he was going to "turn them over" to him and he

thought we could inject the Navy man into the debriefing

2. ($) Hubbard had tentatively agreed to this arrangement. The

boat cost is estimated at $300. Veciana was to proceed to Mjami as planned

on 3 Notrember®

From there he was to arrange for the exit of the two

frogmen. Hubbard asked if we could provide assistance through INS if it

became necessary®

I said we would try.

I suggested that Hubbard wait in

Puerto Rico for Veciana to call from Miami, saying he had the two men there,

before he proceeded to Miami. He also said that Veciana had offered to take

him to the island base of Alpha 66 to look around. Hubbard noted that

while he was taliding with Veciana, he had turned down a $5000 offer ma

by CBS to send a camera crew to the island. Hubbard strongly recommended

that he be permitted to go. He asked that if he was permitted to go that

we obtain for him a life jacket with dye markers and shark repellent.

3. (0)

Undersigned discussed these developments with Maj Swafford and

Maj Drashpil.

Our consensus of opinion was that Hubbard should be allowed

to go ahead,

that thax Navy not be notified until the men were in Miami.

Hubbard was notified of this about 1100, 3 Notember, prior to seeing

Veciana off on the plabe.

4. (4) Col Boyt directed that a letter be written to Operations Branch

requesting a policy decision on Capt Hubbard's trip to the base. Subsequently

Capt Hubbard called at 1500 hours, 7 November to say he had had a call grom

Veciana saying he and the two frogmen would arrive by boat in Miami about

1000, 8 Nov.

Hubbard is going to Miami early 8 Nov (EAL Flight 150, 0917

arrival Miami. He will meet the boat.

Maj Watlington was notified of these

developments

and he will meet Hubbard at the plane.

It was suggested to

Maj Watlington that It Stein accompany Hubbard to meet the boat if feasible.

Hubbard will call us when the men are in his custody, at which time we will

notify Navy. This course of action agreed upon by It Col Daugherty.

5.

Veciana was contacted as scheduled. The boat with the frogmen

was

supposedly 70 miles offshore.

Hubbard did not go out to meet the boat

and instructed Veciana to try and get the frogmen to shore. Veciana promised

to be back in Miami late 9 November.

Hubbard called at 0700, 10 Nov and reported that he and lit

Stein had

Just finished debriefing the lealer of the attack on that date.

A full report was being prepared and placed in the mail to us that date.

The leader reported that he possibly could get the two frogmen in three or

four days - they were out on "another mission" at present. Hubbard said that

he would call Lt Col King later in the day to give him a full report. As to

guidance whether he should stay on in hopes of meeting him, I referred him to

King, saying it was all right if King approved.

About 1430 hours, 10 Now I contacted King in PR. He had

just returned from his survey trip of the Caribbean. I filled him in on

the developments with Alpha 66 and gave him a full briefing on the policy

and thinking here as we knew it at that time.

King said he understood

perfectly, was interested in exploiting this opportunity and would proceed

as he saw

fit.

• 8. 15)

On 13 Nov a cable from CIA was received outlining purported

differences between Alpha 66 and SFDE. (Filed in Pfutner SD). Based on

this there seemed little point in working with Alpha 66 or Veciana. Therefore

I talked with DeGagne (King being absent) and explained the situation to

him, then spoke with Hubbard in Miami.

Hubbard stated he was aware of all

this information and that it was his opinion that Veciana enjoyed a

position equally as high as Menoyo in the SFDE movement now. Further he

had talked with Menoyo.

9. (A) With these aditional facts, matter was again discussed with

It Col Daugherty as it now appeared we were working with SFDE and with

an organization with the capability to assist in emplacing agents should

we be allowed to proceed with such actions.

A file check was condicted

revealing a 1961 ISR on Menoyo. An ISR check (priority) was submitted on

Veciana (although we have no present dealing with him). Veciana, of course,

was initially contacted to assist in obtaining the frogmen and not for a

clandestine purpose.

10. (6)

The debriefing of Menoyo was received on I4 Nov. Pending a

resolution of the case, Hubbard returned to Puerto Rico on 14 Nov at 1230

hours from Miami.

11

Maj Watlington received contact instructions from the

SFDE contact

at 1630 hours, 15 Bov 62. He called undersigned at home

1800 hours, 15 Nov and passed on the message.

Grover and Pat were called

in Puerto Rico about 1930 hours.

The message

was passed on with word that

if there were any change in plans, the Miami contact must know by 0830 hours

16 Nov. Grover was told that he still had not received permission for the

tripo

from CIA. There is an 0I. In verbal conversation between It Col Daugherty

and Mr Sherwood on 15 Nov it was firmly established in Sherwood's mind

that we have a priority of interest on Menoyo and are contacting him in

the U.S. Further, Sherwood reported that the PM people were the ones with

an OI on VECIANA and he promised to look into the matter to see if there

might be the possibility of some modus vivendi

for his use.

6.Yos On 16 Now Maj Watlington informed this office that It Col King

and Capt Hubbard were in Miami.

On 19 Nov, Major Watlington informed us that

they had both departed on 17 Nov. (see attached Memo)•

7. (c)

On 19 Nov Mrs Taylor received a call from Marie (CIA-ISR rep)

saying the OI on VECIANA had been dropped. We picked it up.

• (a) On 22 Nov I received a phone call from It Col King in Miami

e said both he and Capt Hutbard had just returned and would leave fo

Puerto Rico that day. He was sending two rolls of colored film that date

from Miami to us for processing.

He would prepare his report as soon as he

reached Puerto Rivo. He reported no unusual occurences and he had not
