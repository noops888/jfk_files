Chief, Special Security Division

FROM : (Edwin O. O1son)

SUBJECT:

James P. O'Connell, Jr. --Recommendation of

DATE: 10 December 1951

I have known James F. O'Connell, JI., for a period of three

years, the majority of which time he was a co-worker and supervisor in

the FBI. Throughout the time I have known him he has maintained an

excellent reputation among his co-workers and is known as one who is

straightforward, dependable, and honest at all times.

Although I have had no social acquaintance with him, other than

through a few office functions, I would have no hesitancy in recommend-

ing him as a person of excellent personal habits, good moral character,

and as one whose loyalty to this country is unquestionable.

He has had wide and valuable experience in the investigative field

and will be a decided asset to any employer. Through his work with the

FBI he has learned the importance of security and is a good security

risk.

It is with a great deal of pleasure that I recommend Mr. O'Connell

for employment by this Agency.
