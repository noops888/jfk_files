SUBJECT: James P. O'Connell, Jr.--Recommendation of

I have kncwn James F. O'Connell, Jr., for a period of three
years, the majcrity cf which time he was a co-worker and supervisor in
the FBI. Throughout the time I have known him he has maintained an
excellent reputation among his co-workers and is known as one who is
straightforward, dependable, and honest at all times.

Although I have had no social acquaintance with him, other than
through a few office functions, I would have no hesitancy in recommend-
ing him as a person of excellent personal habits, good moral character,
and as one whose loyalty to this country is umquesticnable.

He has had wide and valuable experience in the investigative field
and will be a decided asset to any employer. Through his work with the
FBI he has learned the importance of security and is a good security
risk.

It is with a great deal of pleasure that I recommend Mr. O'Connell
for employment by this Agency.
