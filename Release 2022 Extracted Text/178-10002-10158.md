l. Mr, Esterline briefed the group on the current situation in Cuba

with the report that an alert has been sounded to initiate Phase One of the

unified evacuation plan in Cuba, He added that this group would be working

largely together in operational programming and planning.

Col, King told the group that the DCI is presenting a special policy

2,
He mentioned growing evidence that certain

paper to the NSC 5412 representatives,
of the "heads" in the CASTRO Government have been pushing for an attack

on the U.S, Navy installation at Guantanamo Bay and said that an attack on
the installation is in fact, possible, :

“3, Col, King stated that the first problem in this operation is how
to reach the mass of Cubans with the truth, To date, he said, we have been
denied use of certain American islands that might be useful for either PP
or PM activities, In addition, a number of Chiefs of State of friendly
smaller countries are, at the moment, unwilling to ''stick their necks out
further to support an operation directed at the overthrow of the CASTRO regime
The are in fact, worried that their respective countries may soon
be the victims of Cuban exploitation, He said that unless Fidel and Raul
CASTRO and Che GUEVERA could be climinated in S&& package - which is highly
unlikely - this operation can be a long, drawn-out affair and the present
government will only be overthrown by the use of force.

4, Returning to.the basic operational premises, Col. King said that
the first problem is to reduce the base of support of the CASTRO Government
with the masses (reportedly the regime now enjoys the support of between
60 and 70 percent of the population), An additional problem is that opposition
forces have no real leader and are divided into many parts with some
of them, wsliScepti ble to merger than others, Three groups appear to be satis-
factory “Tor {initial exploitation and each of these has been asked to come up .
with names of potential candidates for paramilitary and allied training.
After training, this group could become the instructor cadre to train additional

Cuban covert action groups.

5, The DCi, Col, King said, has approved the training of the instructor
cadre at a U.S, military installation, The principal installation under
consideration at this time is Fort Sherman in the Canal Zone which is under
the control of the U.S, Army's Jungle Warfare Training Center. The DCI has
also approved the Phase Two training, that is the training of Cuban action
groups, in non-U.S, territory. A given area in one of the Caribbean countries
has been offered and is under consideration, Col, King expressed the opinion
that the minimum time that will be consumed in this training will be between
6 and 7 months, It is hoped that during this period the acceptable opposi-
tion groups will have been merged and will have formed a government-in-exile
to which ail trained elements could be attached.

6, Col, King, addressing himself to the enemy's capabilities and
programs, said that CASTRO will unquestionably continue to train and arm
various worker and student groups who can be mobilized into militia elements
in support of the regular military establishment of Cuba, He added that
reports indicate that CASTRO has more arms and ammunition available to him
now than BATISTA had at the height of his power and warned that under no
circumstances should we underestimate the capabilities of the enemy. He
said that the Cuban operation would be far more difficult and complicated
than the previous one conducted by this Division and that before this prob- "
jem is solved, major operations will be necessary,

7. Capsulizing various intelligence reports, Col, King said the Cubans
are now initiating operations with an objective of establishing revolutionary
movements in the Caribbean area that are not Hmited to those countries
that are under dictatorships. With Ambassadors acting as chiefs of operations,
the Cuban Government apparently hopes to overthrow the existing national
governments and establish in their place governments that are far left and
that are friendly to, and if possible, controlled by Cuba. Naturally, he
added, this is generally in line with the objectives of International
Communism which are, and for some time have been, to divide the traditional
solidarity of the Latin American countries to the detriment of U,S, national

security and foreign policy objectives.

8. In terms of operational problems, Col, King stated that he knew of
no Latin American country whose people were less secure operationally than
‘Gubans, On the CI side, he said that it is known that CASTRO has more than

122 agents in the Miami area alone,

9. In summarizing the more immediate requirements and possibilities,
Mr. Esterline said that the support of all offices represented at the meeting
will be required on a continuing basis, He added that support from the

Office of Security, Logistics, and OTR and others would be needed comparatively :

10, He said that while we are awaiting national policy authorizations,
Branch is proceeding with its planning operations and is preparing two
jects at this time, one to cover extensive radio operations which probably
will include the establishment of a "gray" radio transmitter and another
beibject for the development of air and maritime capabilities for the in-exfil-

tration of men and materiel,
