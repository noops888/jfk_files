SAC Curtis O. Lynum, Dallas, called at 7:05 p.m. 8-25-59,

to furnish the following information concerning the apprehension of Harry

Raymond Pope, who has been on the Ten Most Wanted list since 8-11-59.

Pope was arrested at 4:16 p.m., 8-25-59, by Senior

Resident Agent Aubrey Elliott, Jr., and SA Leland Stephens in company

with the Chief of Police of Lubbock, Texas, two captains and a lieutenant

of the Lubbock Police Department and two Texas Rangers. Pope was found

in a trailer in a trailer court in Lubbock, Texas, was unarmed, offered no

resistance and admitted his identity. Found in the trailer home was an

unloaded shotgun in a closet. Pope is being held in the Lubbock City Jail

and will be arraigned at the first opportunity before the U. S. Commissioner

in Lubbock.

Tex

The apprehension resulted from information furnished by an

l informant of the El Paso Office, one Donald-tenes, who was recently

contacted telephonically by Pope who was seeking from Jones information

as to the possibility of employing two prostitute friends of his named only

as Chris and Louise. This information was furnished by El Paso to the

Dallas Office and Dallas after a thorough search of its files succeeded in

identifying Chris and Louise as Christine Nolan, FBI #787893A, and Rita

Louise Norris, FBI #43157B. Based on the file reviews leads were set out

to Lubbock, Texas, and the Resident Agent Elliott, in checking out motels,

apartments and neighborhood investigation succeeded in locating Christine

Nolan in a trailer court. Based on information received it was believed

Pope was residing with Christine Nolan who is now married to one Norris

Clifton Thompson and on this information the raid was carried out.

SAC Lynum advised the Thompsons are being interviewed regarding their

harboring of Pope.
