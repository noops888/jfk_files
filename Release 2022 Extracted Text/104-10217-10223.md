MICROFILM

1. After considering several alternatives and given ORPHONE/1'5

lack of financial forward planning, ICPIPIT believes that it would

be beneficial and advantageous for WOFIRM to offer to subsidize a

portion of an overt life insurance program designed to give him both

life insurance and a cash value toward retirement.

We have dis-

cussed this with QRPHONE/1 and he has agreed to the desirability of

such a program. He is willing to participate in such an arrangement

and has undertaken to explore the possibilities available to him.

We are forwarding under separate cover a copy of several proposals

which he has received from the local representative of a reputable

WOLADY insurance fimm.

2. -MCPIPIT requests authority to subsidize up to 1/2 of the

cost of a life insurance program for QRPEONE/1. (This WOFIRM portion

not to exceed $50 per month.) Prom an administration standpoint

this would merely take the form of an increased monthly paywent and

we would take the necessary steps to verify that the funds were

indeed being devoted to their designated purpose.

2. In terme of our operational atllization of ORPHONE/l at this time.

while they reserve finite comment until all the returns (per above) are in, the

Medieal Staff did stress the paramount importance proper rest and of not over-

taxing the strength of the agent, coupled with his strict adherence to regular.

warm, balanced meals in accordance with the dietary restrictions usually imposed,

and complete absence of alcohol, in order to prevent a relapso. So long as these

caveats are adhered to, however, there is no reason why he could not make some

more short trips during the next few months, if necessary. However, since he

also has an office to set up and we would like him to concentrate on the Kambona

offer, perhaps it would be a good idea to keep those trips to a minimum for the

time being.

The Medical Staff will be glad to review any further chemical tests per

para. I above suggestions, or any others which his doctor may have already run.

REVISED MEMORANDUM OF ORAL COMMITMENT

1. QRPHONE/1 collaborates with WOFIRM as a Field Agent who

provides certain services of a confidential nature. He has

received 3 Provizional Operational Ayprovai, datea do lany 66.

Financial aspects of his activity are charged to approved Project

ORPHONE.

2. ORPHONE/1's employment by WOFIRM, which began 1 June 1965.

was originally formalized by a letter of Agreement for a period

of three months, replaced by a Memorandum of Oral Cormitment dated

Under this NOC, which remains in effect (as

amended) since that date. ORPHONE/l's employment continues on a

month-to-month basis. It can be terminated by either party on a

3. ORPHONE/ receives the following financial entitlements:

a. Compensation so computed as to give QRPHONE/1 a

"tax-free" income of $800 per month (this figure

effective 1 July 1967).

NOTE: The actual breakdown of QRPHONE/1's finances

as carried on #OFIRM's books is $800 monthly salary

and $70 per month tax supplement withheld at Head-

quarters to discharge ORPHONE/1'S WOLADY tax

obligation. These taxes are remitted through

the

Covert Tax Committee.

This procedure was devised

to honor the original "tax free" commitment made

at the time of his recruitment and at the same

time to fulfill the requirement that all WOLADY

citizens pay taxes on funds received from LNFORT.

b.

Reimbursement for operational expenses and travel

unless these are paid by other sources in which

case WOFIRM will offset such outside reimbursement

against WOFIRM financial obligations to QRPHONE/1..

Since security considerations preclude processing

of detailed accountings for miscellaneous opera-

tional expenses, and as an added inducement to

ORPHONE/1 in connection with his obtaining certain

confidential information of interest to WOFIRM, a

small operational payment, as authorized by Chief,

ICPIPIT will be made to QRPHONE/l for each day

during which he is required to be absent from his

home on confidential business.

NOTE:

Write-off of the funds passed to QRPHONE/1

is to be effected on the basis of the procedure

approved by Chief, ICPIPIT and COS/London, a copy

of which is attached.

This procedure is authorized

in view of the security considerations applicable

to QRPHONE/1 and the need to limit the knowledge

of this operation within WOllACE.

ORPHONE/1 is authorized to receive a non-accountable

office allowance of $100 per month.

NOTE:

This provision was included

in ORpHONe/l's criginal borter of Agreement and was retained in

this MOC since it may be operationally desirable for @RP HONE/1

to accept employment with a target organization based elsewhere.

WOFIRM has arranged for a portion of QRPHONE/l's finan-

cial entitlements to be funded to him by QRPURE, which has also

agreed to repatriate QRPHONE/1 to WOLADY. This has been done

for operational reasons to enable ORPHONE/l to qualify for

reimburse QRPURE for any costs incurred.

6. ICPIPIT is authorized to approve purchase by @RPHONE/1

of certain items of operational equipment which are to be non-

accountable and which shall be charged against the operational

expense category of approved Project ORPHONE.

7. QRPHONE/l signed a separate Secrecy Agreement (in true.

name) at the time of his original recruitment. He is aware that

its provisions are still in effect.

8. QRPHONE/l is aware that he may be required, from time

to time, to undertake an SGSWIRL.

9. QRPHONE/l is aware of all provisions of the Memorandum

of Oral Conmitment with the exceptions of paragraph 6, which

describes an internal WOFIRM procedure; certain aspects of para-

his behalf; and certain aspects of paragraph 3b-specifically

1. ICPIPIT is revising the QREBONY Project files--which

have been rather haphazardly naintained over the past year or

so (much of this time the project was without a case officer).

In our attempts to locate basic project documents we have been

unable to find any copy of the provisions of the Operational

Approval applicable to QREBONX/1. We do have a copy of the • •

Provisional Approval granted 23 May 1966 forwarded with OFLW -

1591, 7 July 1966. Possibly the relevant document was destroyed

during the reduction of files attendant upon the ICPIPIT move,

or possibly it was inadvertantly not forwarded to ICPIPIT.

any rate we will appreciate being sent a copy.

2. We would also like to have a sterile version of the

Project Renewal as well as all other basic documents

ought to be available to ICPIPIT.

We are forwarding USC a copy of a letter sent QREBONY/1

by Jacques Verges' lawyer in which he makes a settlement offer

on behalf of his client. CREBON'/1 will probably accept this,

after a suitable waiting period, as it offers very telling and

effective annunition for use in his continuing battle to counter

Verges' allegation that he was a WOPACT agent. It is our reading

at this point that QREBONY/1 has been quite successful in this

effort and that this settlement fron Verges will be the final

triumph in his campaign.

Cher Yonsieur,

Mon confrère adverse, Conseil de la Société Nouvelle

des Editions Internationales, et de Monsieur VERGES, me fait

savoir qu'il a eu une conversation avec sie VirGis qui lui a

indiqué qu'il vit actucilement en Algérie et serait disposé

à rechercher un règlement amiable des difficultés qui vous

opposent.

Il n'a fait part qu'actuellement sa situation

lui permet pas de payer en

une autre monnaie que la monnaie

algérienne; savoir le dinar.

Il y a là une question de principe. Pourriez-vous,

je vous prie, ne faire savoir si vous pourriez invisazer une

ransaction aux terres de laquelle vous seriez regle

on dinits.

j'ignore d'ailleurs dans quelles conditions l'exportation ces

capitaux d'alsáre est encore possible à ce jour.

Uuos qu'il en soit, peut-être seriez-vous intéressé

par cette proposition.

Je n'ai pas encore discuté de chiffres avec non

adverse puisqu'il s'agit là d'une question préjudi-

cielle à

toute discussion sur le fond de la somme due.

J'attends done votre prochaine réponse et vous prie

de croire, cher Monsieur, à l'exprossion

de mes sentiments.

2. We do not believe that the testimony is particularly awlazard for

QREBONY /1, and while we had an opportunity to have this portion of the

it since it would have involved revealing VOFACT interest in QREBONY /.

3. FYI, In order to avoid any concern on the part of QRPURE should

this portion of the testimony ever hit the press, KAMMERMAYER

Ref A contains previous JAGUAR comments about

L and

SCHLEIFER, of about the same period. While TIFFANY was in London

(which puts it at the right time)

'1 was in touch with

SCHLBIFER, and TIFFANY should be-able to compare JAGUAR's comments

with what

I said at the time.

Ref B reflects a different

A. QRBONY/ (Q) gives the convincing impression that he is at home

in his new work. He responds sell to su; estions and instructions, adds

suggastions of his own ior i-proving the =lan-- an indication that he

wishes to please. in the begiring he storea a tenuency to raise minor

objections involving personal zaterial problems (e.:, Inconvenience to

family life oi a long tdy) but less of this was renarked as he cane to

realize that requirements were to be reasonable and he was to te treated

as a haman being with his on problems.

He has stated that he sould not continue his present involvement

with target personalities and institutions if it were not that re wish

him to, l.e., his oin inclination would te to withdraw irom the political

fringe. Podigast feels that this is consistent hith his background,

which has not a party career; in his youth he was willfully apolitical

and hostile to the "rovement"; later he ves involved in opposing party

people in his lew York work; in Faris he didn't get along wit.. his party

friends (the affair oi the forged letter) and oi course broke with the

magazire crond there.

He seems to be genuinely comnitted to working against erenies

of CDYuke, ready to accept eve- deeper comitient; he has expressed

no reservations as to what he vill do. He doesn't object to reporting

on old friends, fello: BRIEs,

PLUTTEd, or using s/w techniques (which he took with him on a trip to what

was then a very hostile area, ihere he has known enenies, and where

there has a recent history oi sealing roughly with outsiders). shen

orders contlict tith personal desires (for example, when he planed to

spend a weekend in a city he enjoys but ras told he should proceed

Imediately to his next stopping place), he obys without hesitation.

the foregoing is a collection of discellaneous facts, cut taken

together they paint the portrait of a promising agent, both in terns

oi motivations and abilities.

АТТОБРВСТІ

B. Rodigast's knorl:de of @'s a-vitude in the months prior to.

recruitrent (June 1905) is limited. Rodigest has the impression & had

simply reached the end of his rose-- he had nowhere to go, he had

earlier decided that he would iike to work for or at least cooperate with

ODYOKs (although earlier attespis to maxe contact met with no success) .

The humane treatment received at the hands oi his recruiter, the

subsequent sympathetic handlin; by his case oilicer, undoubtedly

convinced hir that he had not nade a mistake.

The material factor is

not to be underestinated.

The dezoralizing position

oi lirinz on his wire

and worse, on her fanily,

must have lowered his resistance to any possible alternative. Rodigast

simply doesn't know hor @ might have responded to a reasonable offer

from enesies of ODYCK: at that point. The prospect of immediate engagement

at a decent wage may have been cecisive.

Since that time, Rodigast feels @'s motivation has been reinforced

and perbass considerably altere: he has been asked to do obviously

necessary tasks, and so he can feel he is reeded by someone; he has been

given reasonable instructions on how to acc.nplish them; he sees that

others are concerned for his personal safety and material wellbeing.

Rodigast has taken pains to avoii giving the impression that there was

any coniusion or error or difference oi vientoint in running the project

(even at a time when there were alanty of all three); such problens were

resolved before being taken up with f, and thus he has a sonewhat rosy

vl:w of the operation. The satisfaction oi accos?Lishment (i.e., bein?,

able to produce userul answers to our questions) is surely a jactor

in his present attitude.

Though Light-skinned, with a voice and accent which would be

considered acceptable in any raPilil, society, & is extremely sensitive

to the fact that he is a liegro. He has not said or suggested any such

thing to rodigast, but this is so obvious a lactor in his correspondence

(even discounting the extent to which the correspondence is part of

his conscious cover) that it seems to Rodigas: that it must be a factor

in his life. On the other hand, lodigast has knor another liegro who

was a close iriend of & (and now one of his major enenies,

as a resuit

of the Paris jorged letter incident and contributing events) who was

so sensitive about race that he makes & in retrospect seem like an

Uncle Tom.

who is not genuinely a "niger lover", i.e., who could not convey

a convincing image oi a person for whom a color difference vas not a

barrier (Q would surely detect the false "pal"). & has mentioned anti-

Negro prejudice as a reason for his refusal to cooperate nith ODeNY

oificers who talked to him while he was in New York. In fect, & deais,

with his present case o:ficer as a possible i: not a true iriend;

they share an inter-st and involvement in writiug, English literature,

Living happily abroad, etc.; Rodigast has tried to read Dants in the

original and l has done so; Rodigast would like to write a novel and

Q has published one; lodigast doesn't know much about the post-logical

positivists who interest & but probably gives a convincing impression

that he would like to know about them, and just night be capable of

understandin: them. "hat all the foregoin" means is that in l we have

an accomplished person, and it is a useful tactic to treat him if

not as a superior than at the very least as an equal.

primary: A joined the orgenization a-u stayed with us because he could

not do as well in any other job, could in iact get no job (because of;

his background, his alien status abroad, etc). Fodigast does not exclude

this, although he feels that whatever the originai motivation, it has

been

strengthened and perhaps converted into sosething more worthy.

But even if his prinary zotivation renains material,

project over its lirst nine months suggest it is a viable one.

C. & has lived in the underground for so nany years without

breaking that it is likely he will be able to continue to do so. He thinks

fast, handles himseli well in matters presenting security problems.

He is not fully trained for clandestine activity. Fodigast's long

mestings with him alriays include advice on one or zore specilic aspects

of clandestine work, wrich then added yp may be taken to repr-sent a

short, course, but that is all. The lacs of training has led @ to do or

say things which hoalgast would not have wished hin to do or say, and

whenever possible t.is has been brought to Q's atiention, and he seems

responsive to such instruction.

Rodigast would not recommend that l be given a training course,

but this would not preclude more lornal sessions with Rodigast during

which Rodigast could give nore complete instruction on various phases

of clandestine work.

It is to ce hoped that the present situation regarding his wife

(who belleres him to be working for th= arch foa of : BERIMa) will be

possible to naintain. She doesn't like the situation much, but accepts

It, and apparently hasn't betrajed his "confidence".

Rodigast feels the evidence for his loyalt: is at least as good as

not disloyalty, and in any case should not prevent hin from executing

KUBARK policy to the letter. Undosbtedly be has a leftist econosic

orientation, but there is no evidence that it is an orthodor larst

one (or that it ever was).

He seens to like Rodigast; in any event they work well together.

He has made no effort to develop a warm relationship with Rodigast,

horever, apparently feeling that this is not necessary, night not

be apprecisied, and would conilict with the conparimentalization so

On the -ther hard, part oi d's satisfaction with KüBAR". might

derive fron a feeling that rubili is a "soft touch". Rodigast does

not recanend that anything be done to change i's opinion (if he really

does hold it); Rodigast feels that it are going to pay & as much whether

A appears to possess a realitsic, sane view or Odivis, what

background would lead one to expect. In any case, te have no

recent evidence to contradict his statement that he considers himseli

to be a loyal PBP:!:R; it may just be true. If it isn't, this won't

make any difference to the project as it is understood by Rodigast.

Q is unlikely to hold syrathetic feelings ior Cost,

in the other hand, he is sophisticated enough to assume that nis

reporting on

PBeRraRi is oi concern to CDuTY, and he must ko.or

that his one suggestion for tdy in PBPRIS to contact target

instititions and old iriends there rould put him into ODENVY territory.

He would probably accept any necessary collabo:ation without sho:ing

that he didn't like it.

E. Rodigast does not believe @ i3 at present vorking for another

service, but it is difficult to kron what rould happen ii another

service approached him. Rodigast assumes he would report this to us,

just as he reported in ietail the overtures by trio persons apparently

working with the services of the country in which he resides. As part

of the present operation involves the possibility that & will in fact

be approached by the opposition, and l is aware oi this, one assumes

he is prepared to remain loyal to NUBiRk; one would also assums ho would

recognize the heichtened value oi his services to us should he be

approached by the ocher side and continue to remain loyal to us.

A certainly would not agree to work ios an opposition service

hiletthere is no evidence that li leit alone @ would driit

dragging out an assignment to :ill time,

it is possible that he would.

He has not written as many iree-iance articles as codigast iould have

liked him to, because each requires thinking out a subject, gathering

naterial, selecting a point oi view and thinking o: the public to which

it would be addressed- a lot of york lor articles neant to sem: nainly

as cover, for publication in obscure organs, or perhaus merely to be

used to convince editors that he as active. Or the other hand, he produced

the 1irst issue o. the nenslotter in record time. folloing instructions

to the letter (indeed, accesting what must at tines seem like petty

editorial changes nade by Rodigast). Ferha-s he produced the latter

so efficiently because he say in it added prestige, an opportunity to

get his name back beiore the public in a respectable context.

Idealogical totivation would not seem to be a level oi control

in his case, "hat is nost important is his contentuent with being (he

hopes) a persanent part o: a large organization, with a steady salary

important than its knonn reputation ¿or keeping its promise to pay,

Doubtless, his tendency to bear a grudge is a factor here- o

is now in a position where he can thunb his nose at sane of his enenies.

Rodigast feels that considerate dealing with l, letting

him knor where he is going, what he can expect, not changing the rules

possibility of snall but certain increases in aterial benefits in the

Fe read A Spy and His laster by Christopher Pellt., and has

mentioned it a couple oi times when a renark by railgast reminds him

of sorething saii in the book.

Roilgast doesn't think that even aiter training l rould ba very

good at ürroning oif surveillance (jor example) as ho seems too natier

of fact to be sly, and perhars slightly lazy about what sight be

gratuitous shavior (e.f, changing subway trains or taxis just on the

assumption that someone might be following hin). rodigest's solution

is not to depend on y ior such things, but to atteat to plan nesting

The same ease is to be noted in his substantive rork; he submits

couplinents vith a very slight nod. then iodigast iirst met l in a hote
