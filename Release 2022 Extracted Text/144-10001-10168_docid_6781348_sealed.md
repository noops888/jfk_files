MINREX, HAVANA VERIFIES OSWALD'S REQUEST FOR TRANSIT VISA FOR RUSSIA

FR Havana: MINREX F 26 Nov 63
TO Circular [Warsaw: Cuban Embassy] ((A)) ==
Msg Nr: 7482

MINREX reported yesterday that the information in the newspaper
Excelcior of Mexico €ity concerning LEE OSWALD's request for a transit
visa to go to the USSR, which was requested from the Cuban Congulate
in Merida, is true. This visa was requested 27 September from said
consulate, which stated that it could not grant the visa without
permission of MINREX, and unless permission had been granted pre-

beforehand to involve Cuba and the USSR in the acts. The inconceive
able impunity of a person who, with a known police record could -
murder OSWALD in the presence of the police in a prison basement,
demonstrates the scandalous meane which reactionary forces are
using-in the United States to cover up the perpetrators and the
motives for KENNEDY's assassination. World-wide public opinion
demands a clarification of the facts, It is absurd that the Dallas
District Attorney is closing the case of the death of the President
scarcely 48 hours after the deed.
