MINREX, HAVANA VERIFIES OSWALD'S REQUEST FOR TRANSIT VISA FOR RUSSIA

FR Havana: MINREX

Cuban Embassy] ((A))

Msg NI:

MINREX reported yesterday that the information in the newspaper

Excelcior of Mexico City concerning LEE OSWALD's request for a transit

visa to go to the USSR, which was requested from the Cuban Consulate

in Merida, is true. This visa was requested 27 September from said

consulate, which stated that it could not grant the visa without

permission of MINREX, and unless permission had been granted pre

beforehand to involve Cuba and the USSR in the acts. The inconceiv

able impunity of a person who, with a known police record could

murder OSWALD in the presence of the police in a prison basement,

demonstrates the scandalous means which reactionary forces are

using in the United States to cover up the perpetrators and the

motives for KENNEDY's assassination. World-wide public opinion

demands a clarification of the facts. It is absurd that the Dallas

District Attorney is closing the case of the death of the President

scarcely 48 hours after the deed.
