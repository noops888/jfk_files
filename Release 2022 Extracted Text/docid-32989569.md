that BRODERICK contacted his lawyer concerning the pending

DRAGER did admit to past memberships in the American

Nazi Party, National socialist Waite Peoples Party, Ku kLux

Klan, Knights of Constantine, as well as generally claiming

nenbership in all right wing organizations at one time or

another during the past 15 years.

He stated he was recently the self-appointed Acting

Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan in New Jersey. He felt the

ot

other leaders in the group, but did have some conflicts

with some other independent klan organizations in New Jersey. •

command although he would never accept any rank higher than

For a period during 1964-1967 he worked mainly

at the party's training camp in Pennsylvania as the individual

in charge of the printing of all literature for the party.

After ROCKIELL's death, DRAGER advised he was asked to take

command of the party but he declined because of his past

criminal record, a: decision he regrets to this day. Approxi~

mainly three nonths after RCOWiLLL's death he left the Nazi

Party. DRAGER feels that MATT KOEHL, the present commander

of the party, has the guts but not the know how to run the

party organization.

that ROCKWELL has and he does not reach the public effectively

with the party's message. DRAGER stated be currently has no

association with the American Nazi Party or with the National

DRAGER advised he knows no one in Illinois associated

with the American NazI Party or the national soczalist laite

Peoples carty and the name Dill Ductch mans Little to ban.

He does

recall vatul writing to his ill but stated Dozin

was not at Nazi Party Headquarters in Arlington during the

same period that he served there.

He advised that he knows no one in the Phoenix,

Arizona area since the death of WeSTEroOk PaKO (phonetic).

He knows of no right wing activity in that area but he did

recall in the past he communicated with a Nazi

Farty member

there but he no longer recalls this individual's name.

DRAGER stated that all of his travels are basically

politically notivated and that

the main philosophy of his

WAll is victory for white Christianity and a return to the

natural order.

feels that the white race was placed

this earth as the "gilted race" and that a geographical

separation of the races is necessary to prevent interbreeding

of the races. lie contributes the basis of his beliefs to

the writings of HISIER but stated that many of the ancient

philosophers preached the same white supremacy philosophy.

He believes that interbreeding of the races will eventually

lead to the degeneration oi our society and its eventual

downiall.

DRAGER stated that in the event the political

systel fails as a mans for the right wing groups

in this

country to save the country from its external and internal

enemies, then any other neans necessary will be used to achieve

their goals. He feels that if the Government will not act

to save the

country then right wing organizations must act to

do so.

DIGUR stressed the danger of an internal enemy in

the form of an overly suppressive Government that would no

louger act for tho roll-boing of the average white Arerican.

Although he stated again that the right wing extremist

organizations will aitempt to gain pover by legitimate political

process, it this process should break down any nethod, including

that of violence, would be used to accomplish their goals.

He stated the targets of the right wing would be any suppressive

## Page 50

SI 157-4275

5

Govornnont agencies or any left wing organization that would

be doing the

"bidding" of the suppressive Government in

power.

Additional targets of the right wing would include

the United States Treasury Department and the Internal Bevenue

Service, and such organizations as the Jewish Anti-Defanation

League, who although is not a Government agency, he feels

it receives its authority to act from the Government.

DRAGER agreed that to succeed in the violent over

throw of the country a supply of weapons and ammunition would

be necessary.

He stated he knows of no right wing organiza-

tion who currently has a stockpile of weapons and advised

that the source of weapons at the right tine would be the

United States military establishment, whose leaders and

white members he predicts will join his cause when it is

time for action. Although he has heard that the Minutenen

organization was stockpiling weapons, he has no evidence that

that organization currently has any large supply of weapons

in its possession.

He stated that he also folt that all the State

units of Government will join his cause at the right time

that they will revolt against the suppression placed on

then by the Federal Government. He feels that even personnel

of the Federal Bureau of Investigation will join his cause

because of their basic conservative

beliefs and because of

the Federal Bureau of Investigation's concern for the good

of the country

He feels that the Federal Bureau of Investi-

gation is now only a "pawn" of the Justice Department from

which it receives its orders.

DRAGER continued tosstate his personal philosophy

concerning the power and iniluence exerted by the Jewish

population in this country:

He considers the total Jewish

control on the lnerican political system io be the greatest

internal threat present today in our system. He believes

that the Communist movement, all racial organizations, and

all liberal loft wing organizations operating in this

country are tools of the Jewish population in the United

States. le predicts a complete economic takeover by the

JowLish

segiant of our society. Is exampios of the extent

of the jowish control in

this

country, LAGER uses the

appointment of HallY KIssINGER as secretary ot state as weil

as the fact that the NIXON administration is controlled by

his high-ranking Jewish advisors and by political contributions

furnished by the Jewish population in this country. He also

r"..

stated that all sectors of the news media are controlled by

Jons and that they dirccily control all newspaper publications

either by direct ownership or by controlling the advertising

that newspapers need for their survival.

In addition, he

pointed out that the three major radio-television networks

are all headed by jewish individual and as such they are able

to direct public broadensting to benefit their own views and

the views of the Jewish segment of our society. DMGER further

stated that this great influence exerted by Jews in this

country will eventually lead to the degeneration of our

society unless their activities are stopped by actions from

the right wing.

DRAGER stated that as a result of his travels

throughout the country he has coordinated activities between

the various right wing groups to such a degree that all that

is needed for them to act in unison would be

the right

conditions to exist in this country. Fe feels that his

activities are currently peaceiul in nature and that he is

determined to work within the present political system for

change, but if conditions should become too suppressive

the average white citizenry in this country, then a

time for action will be at hand and if a violent revolution

is necessary to bring about change, it will be used. When

ZE IS tIEE fOX ACTION DRAGER prediCted a unification of all

the right wing organizations in this country for the good of

the common man.

DRAGER

admitted that he confines his activities

and travels to the area east of the Mississippi River and

that he feels thai the West is organized enough. He did

admit to having spoken in the past in Feunsylvania, New

York, New Jersey, Toledo, and Columbus, Chio, and Chicago.

He again declined to comment further regarding his activities

or individuals he nay have been in contact with during his

travels since leaving New Jersey.

DINGER refused to comont on any aliasos he may

use or upon the various identitications lound in his possession

lat the time lof his arrest in the nares of DINIS DSAN LITTER

BLACK PANTHER PARTY,

Also. Known as

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther

Party (BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland

California, to organize black people so they can take control of

the life, politics and the destiny of the black community. It

was organized by Bobby Seale, BPP Chairman, and Huey P. Newton,

BPP Minister of Defense.. Newton was sentenced in 1968 to serve

2 to 15 years alter being convicted of manslaughter in connection

with the killing of an oakland police officer.

"The Black Panther", which

further describes itself as the

The official news the "glack Community News Service",

stated that the BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla

tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression of the

black people.

Residents of the black community are urged to arm

chemselves against the police who are consistently referred to in

the publication as

"pigs" who should be killed.

- ..

"The Black Panther" Issue of September 7, 1968, con-

tains an editorial by BPP Minister of Education, George Mason

Murray, which ends with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,

...we will not dissent. from American Government. We

will overthrow it"

tations from the writings of Chairman Mao Ise-tung of the People's

Republic of China and feature Mao's statement that "political

power grows out of the barrel of a gun"

The national headquarters of the BPP is located at

3106 Shattuck Avenue, Berkeley, California.

Richmond, which "coalition" would in essence be a BPP-sponsored

committee against Fascism, were meeting with great difficulty.

These sources reported that as a result of numerous interviews

conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (MBI) of the

individuals interested in forming the aforementioned

very suspicious of one another.

VILLIAL JUNIOR STAITORD, 1108 Claridge Drive,

Lexington, kentucky, known to interviewing agent as

JAY STAFFORD, through previous association and interviey,

furnished the following ¿niormation: -

STAFFORD advised that he had been searching his

memory for the name of a chemical previously discussed

with him by MIke BROWN on the ccasion then STAFfOlf and

aS brother, LABlY STAFFORD, viSIted BROWN Seresidence

In Berca, Kentucky, on July

23, 1974. STAFFORD advised

that he now remembers the name of the chemical that

BROWN discussed as being thermite. STAFFORD stated that

theimite was the ingredient which BROWN discussed a

need

for inasmuch as thermite would linish or be the

remaining chemical to be used in a composition which,

then lii, vould create so much heat that it would destroy

any bronze or metal statue!

STAFFORD rediscussed with the interviewing agent

pecticulars of BROWN's plan to travel. to New York and

place incendiary and explosive devices in the United Nations

Building. StArrORD, on retelling the story, was positive

thai BROW describea the basement arca or ine united

Nations Building where dynamite was to be placed as being

& "meditation place." STATTORD again described the staïue

1n this 'neditation place" as being, according to BROIN's

description, a statue symbolizing Pagan WorshIp or 1001.

STAFTORD renembers BROWN describing this statue as being

made of marble and siated that BROWN discussed a need for

dynamite to destioy this statue inasmuch as the burning

composition inciuding thermite would not do the job on

rocks.

STAFTORD discussed his impression of BROWN's

personallty and character, desching BRolll as a person

who seemed

extremely well read and an individual who seened

to have a great deal of sophistication.

STAFFORd stated

that he bad not seen nor talked to BROWN since his visit

ou July 25,

1974.

number of New Left demonstrators, riots, police retaliation, etc.

The Secret Army Organization (SAO) 1s a para-military

organization formed during the early part of

October, 1971, by former members end supporters

of the Minutemen Organization, for the purpose

of replacing that organization,

the Bothell, Washington area carrying sidearms and wearing,

camoflage clothing.

When investigated by his department,

it was determined that at that time ANDERSON was involved

in what was referred to as "simulated maneuvers" in the

woods

around the Bothell, Washington area which PLANCICH

described as being heavily populated by farms and related

businesses. Also during the summer of 1969, a Bothell

Police Officer observed ANDERSON in the company of several

other white males who were once again conducting some sort

of maneuvers. At this time the officer observed

a shotgun

in one of the vehicles, which when measured was

just 112 inch

over the legal limit. During the early fall of 1969,

ANDERSON approached an officer of the Bothell Police

Department

with a weapon to determine if it was legal and under the

current interpretations of both Federal and state law, it

was opined that the weapon ANDERSON had was legal, but

nO

record was

maintained as to the type of weapon.

PLANCICH stated that ANDERSON, in the past, has

purchased old Bothell Police Department vehides and it was

PLANCICH's opinion that ANDERSON did this to satisfy some

unknown egomania that he felt ANDERSON had.

PLANCICH

stated that he knew of no violent acts committed by ANDERSON

at any time.

PLANCICH stated that the only close friends and

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION

PX T-I advised on April 26, 1972, that during

his contact with members

of the Secret Army Organization

counter disruptions by revolutionary groups at the

Republican National Convention.

This question was

never

discussed

at great length, but in this connection, one

member suggested that old

junk-type cars be parked

at

strategic Locations where, in the event or controntatior

with dissident elements,

the SAO members could have access

to the necessary weapons hidden in the cars.

Since the

time of the above discussion, however, SAO leadership

appears to have had second thoughts on the matter because

che latter have been heard to say that they are going

to stay out of San Diego entirely during the Republican

National Convention in order to preclude any untoward

incident that could be attributed to the presence of

the SAO and redound to the discredit of the SAo.

Informant advised that he has not been present

when sources of weapons may have been discussed by the

SAO, but states that he is aware of the fact that leaders

of the SAO have attended gun shows at every opportunity,

notably at Yuma, Arizona, on October 15, 16, 1971, and

again at Yuma on February

25, 26, 1972, and

at Phoenix,

Arizona, on March 25, 26, 1972.

Source advises that the Secret Army Organization

is a new paramilitary group that has been

formed in California. to replace the Minutemen

organization.

It is composed of ex-Minutemen

groups with intent to disrupt the convention. In this

connection, Davis spoke in terms of having an SAO training

session some time before the convention lor the purpose of

preparing to control and counter dissident elements in the

event the latter should get out of hand.

Source advised that the SAO is confining its recruiting

efforts to the Rocky Mountain States, but that the group has

established contact with former Minutemen in Michigan and

Maryland.

UNDERERDUNO BULETIN

GENERAL HEADQUARTERS

JANUARY 1972

"God grants liberty only to those who love it and are always willing to guard and

defend it".. Daniel Webster

Fellow members,

This month's bulletin will deal mostly with "Booby Traps". Because of the

length of this article we are only sending out the first half this month. The second

half will be published in next month's bulletin. Future bulletins this coming year

will contain material on psychoiogical warfare, urban warfare tactics, communi-

cations, survival equipment, first aid, explosives, weapons, codes, and other re-

lated warfare subjacts.

Those members who have not yet completed or started on the organization's

basic training programs are hereby urged to do so. We cannot, in most cases,

assign any member to an imposiant underground project or to an organized team

or group until they have compieted this training program.

While headquarters cannot assign a member in the above classification to

an established unit, any member can (and is encouraged to) recruit and form their

own combat team (see December 1971 Bulletin). In many cases this may be the

best policy in regards to personal security as the member would be working with

the people he personally knows and trusts. If any member would like to form their

own unit they should write to their assigned mail drop and the organization will send

them further instructions along with a Team Recruiting Packet. The articlo on .

"The Dispersed Team" in this month's bulletin should help those members who

wish to form their own Combat Team.

We are enclosing a small number of S. A. O. stickers with this month's

bulletin. Please put them in your shirt pocket or billfold and as soon as possible

stick them up in phone booths, at bus stops, or other piblic places that you visit.

The stickers are alrcady gummed and when wet will athere firmly to glass, melal,

or any other smooth surface. If our members would use these stickers along with

the leaflets that are available, it would have a real psychological impact on the

rest of the American people and give them evidence that there are still those among

them who are willing to fight for the re-establishment of a Constitutional kepublic.

These first stickers are being sent to each member free, additional stickers aud

leaflets can be ordered on the monthly report form.

When discussing a

Iet Army Organization "Combat

ham"', we usually think

,Of a small group of people mo live very close lo one another.

Such an arrangement

has certain advantages, such as ease of communication and travel for collective

training and team operations, but there are also several disadvantages.

Among the disadvantages are these: Team members may be well acquainted

with only a small geographical area. If forced to leave this area the team may be

placed at a serious disadvantage. It is harder for a team of SAO members who

live closely together to keep from attracting atiention, thus unit security may be

poor. If one ember of the team is ever discovered and arrested by the enemy,

chances are that all members of the team will be rounded up together.

These considerations have caused us to experiment with a new arrangement that

we refer to as a "Dispersed Team"'. Such a team has the same number of members

(usually six) as a regular Combat Team. Each team is split into to sections as is

the old team. The members have the same type of individual specialties and duties.

The big difference lies in the fact that the team members may be located over

• a comparatively larger area - perhaps as much as 25 to 50 miles in diameter. In

urban areas one team member may live in each of six different cities. Thus the

team may range over a fairly large geographical area with at least one team member.

being familiar with the immediate territory through which they are traveling.

• When active as part of an underground movement (as opposed to the classical

: forms of guerrilla warfare) the Dispersed Team has several other advantages.

For example, if one member of the team gets too "hot" in his area, he automatically

has five other hide-outs to which he can go for assistance or to which he can send

his family for temporary safety. The Dispersed Team can conveniently cover a

larger area in the fields of recruiting, psychological warfare, and propaganda.

Operations of sabotage, surveillance and harassment of.communist personnel,

raids, and other combat type operations can be successfully conducted while moving

& minimum of people over a minimum distance.

During the present period of deliberate delay the activities of the team will

naturally be different from some future period in which all out warfare between our

organization and our country's communist enemies develops.

If the team is to achieve its ultimate objectives the following astivities must

be provided for: (1) organization of and within the team, (2) communications between

the. team and higher command, (3) maintaining secrecy of team members, (1) main-

taining a continuous and effective propaganda effort, (5) obtaining the necessary sup-

plies and equipment for present and future needs, (6) training of the team in general,

and of individual members in their own specialties.

When the required personnel are not available to form a full team, a three

man section should be formed. When additional people are recruited the unit can

then be expanded in an orderly fashion.

BOOBY TRAPS

Broadly defined a booby Lrap can be any kind of apparatus

En which a reaction unfavorable to the enemy is brought about

when he unintentionally makes sone act which triggers the re-

action. The most coumon types of booby traps used in warfare

involve an explosive charge which is set off by movement of a

trip wixe or the moving of some object which is connected to

the trigger mechanism.

On occasion the explosive charge may be replaced by

signal flares, gas, snoke or other chemical agents. The trigger

mechanism may be either electrto, mechanical, thermal or chemical.

ELECTRICALLY OPERATED TRIGGERS. Such trigger mechanisms

are very easily arranged wherever a supply of electric blasting

caps are available and also a suitable source of electricity.

One of the most common electric type booby traps is to simply

Interrupt the electrical circuit in some building so that when

the lights are turned on the explosive is detonated. This

simple procedure applied to an automobile with a few sticka of

dynamite has marked the end of more than one gangland hoodlum.

To booby trap a car in this manner one side of the electric

blasting cap can be attached to any metal part of the car while

the other side is attached to a spark plug or the "cold side"

of the Ignition switch. In the first case the cap detonates the

dynamite when the starter motor is turned over or if attached to

the key switch detonating occurs when the ignition is turned on.

Any novable object can be booby trapped so that when it

is moved some simple type electrical switch contact is closed

•to complete a circuit between a dry cell. battery and the de-

tonator.

A very sinple example would be to have one wire tacked

along the edge of a door and the other wire tacked to the frame

extending out far: enough that contact is made between the

two when the door is opened. A slightly more refined trigger

involves two small springs separated by some thin piece of 1n-

sulation at one end as shown in Figure No. l. When pressure

I8 applica, the springs are held apart and when the pressure

1s released, the springs come together

to make electrical con-

tact. This may be placed in & door which is then closed to open

the switch while the explosive 1s wired into the circult.

the door is opened pressure is released

and the charge explodes.

This simple trigger can be placed under the leg of a chair,

a wooden box or any other movable object of aufficient weight.

If the chair is moved or the box lifted the release of preasure

• will close the electrical circuit.

A person skilled in the placement of booby traps will not

leave any part of the switch, wires or charge visible. Instead of

connecting the wires

to the door itself he will t

e off the door.

Irame, place the

sger mechanism at the coge of

une door and

then replace the frame so that the entire mechanism is hidden when

"the door is closed.

by taking off the frame of a window and drilling a hole

'out through the window casing the trigger mechanism can'be placed

aza-that the charge will be detonated by either raising or lowering

-sua half open window.

A simple time delay mechanism can be arranged by placing

- Fsane.of

stenough these triggers under a glass jar filled with water. When

of the water evaporates, the weight of the jar will no

longer be sufficient to hold the contacts open.

Figure No. 2 shows another simple electrical trigger made

a spring clothes pin. The improvised contacts are held

apart by a small wooden wedge in the jaws of the clothes pin.

This wedge can be attached to a trip wire or other movable object.

When it is withdrawn the clothes pin shuts and the electric cir-

cult is completed.

A trigger of this type, can be used to make a time delay

-•* mechanism in many different ways. The wedge may be connected by

a Loose cord to the end of a spring which is also attached to a

- tin can. • Above this a second tin can fuli of sand or

water is

placed with a hole in the bottom so that the contents gradually

" fall through into the second can.

When the weight of the lower

can becomes enough to stretch the spring sufficiently the wedge

will be pulied from the clothes pin.

As an alternate method the

spring may be already stretched out and held there by a second

cord attached to some other solid object. The cord holding the

spring could be placed through a candle so that it will be

burned

In two when the candle burned down a certain distance. An

active

Imagination can devise countless ways for activating this type

of trigger either by instant action or delayed action.

A clever derivative of this simple trigger is used in the

"British book trap". In this casela book is hollowed out to

- contain a small battery and a quarter pound block of INT which

Is detonated by an electrical blasting cap. The circuit passes

through two contacts attached to opposite pages of the book but

are held apart by some insulating material which is attached to

the back of the bookcase. If the book is withdrawn from the case

the contacts come together and the INT is detonated.l

A British ball bearing contact switch is shown in Figure No.

3. This type of contact is very useful in placing charges entirely

within a movable object.

For example, a suitcase could be laid

on its side with, the contact positioned inside in such a way that

when the suitcase was picked up the ball bearing would roll forward

• and complete the contact. Similar electrically activated booby

-2=

traps could be pl

d in closed gasoline cans, ca

cens, ammuni-

tion boxes or dozens of other objects which an enemy would place

right side up before opening.

A plastic or glass test tube

could be used instead of a metal case by sticking to wires through

the cork in such a manner that the ball bearing would come in

contact with both of them.

A surprisingly accurate timing device can be made with a

tube of this type. Holding the tube with the open end up, first

peas, then a measured amount of

water, drop in the ball bearing (in this case a wad of tin foil

be used as weil), finally put the cork in the top with the

wire sticking down through. The water will cause the dried peas

the ball bearing (or wad of tin foil)

up until it makes contact with the two wires to complete the

circuit. The time can be regulated. from a few minutes to several.

hours depending on the length of the tube, the amount of water, and

Far more sophisticated types of electrical triggers are manu-

factured some of which operate by photoelectric cell or even more

difficult to recognize mechanisms. These may be used to safeguard

record centers, important military or missile bases, etc. but are

• seldom encountered under battlefield conditions.

MECHANICAL TRIGGERS. These may be operated either by impact

or by friction. The ordinary hand grenade employs an impact

trigger. When the handle is released a spring operated lever snaps

against a cap (similar to the priming cap in a shotgun shell)

which in turn starts a short fuse to burn. This fuse leads to a

blasting cap centered in an explosive charge.

The trigger mechanism of a "potato masher" hand grenade

operates much

like the firing pin of a bolt action rifle. In

this case a spring activated plunger

strikes a detonator. The

plunger may be released by pulling out a pin as shown in Figure

No. 4, by cutting a wire as shown in Figure No. S or by applying.

pressure to a slotted key as shown in Figure No. 6.

Explosion of the primer cap alone is not sufficient to de-.

tonate most military explosives.

Generally a booster charge of a

fairly sensitive explosive is detonated by the primer and this in

turn detonates the main charge. In military use TNT is by far the

most common explosive used in the main charge of booby trapse

So called "plastic explosive" or "Composition C-3" contains

percent RDX and 22% plasticizer made up of mixture of dinitrotolune,

TNT, nitrocellulose and dinethylformamide. RDX is cyclotrinethy-

lenetrinitramine which is manufactured by nitrating hexamethylene-

tetramine (which is obtained by the Icaction of formaldchyde and

ammonia).

Booster charges where necessary are usually tetryl or PEN.

Common explosives used in primers are load azide, lead styphnate

or the now large

discontinued mercury fulminat

Characteris-

tics, uses and manufacture of explosives will be dealt with in

another chapter.

A very simple device can be made from a screen door spring

that will explode an ordinary rifle

cartridge when activated by a

trip wire. Although the "explosion" is almost harmless it can be

very nerve racking to an approaching enemy.

=

A more deadly booby trap consists of a short piece of pipe

which is driven into the ground. A plunger type trigger mechanism

is dropped into the pipe and an ordinary rifle cartridge placed

point up in the pipe so that perhaps one-half inch is exposed

above the ground. The weight of a man stepping on the bullet

releases the trigger and fires the cartridge which will penetrate

well up into the leg or the body.

Some mechanical triggers are activated by friction just

like striking a match on the rough material of the match cover.

Figure No. I shows a cut-away drawing of the U.S. Army firing

device, pull friction type M-2.

a gritty substance much like the strip on a book of matches.

When this is pulled out through a container of flash compound

(chemically similar to the match heads) the friction ignites the

flash compound which may be used either to light a fuse or fire

a blasting cap.

A crude but effective friction device can be prepared by

sticking the end of a fuse in some small cylinder filled with

match heads through which is placed a small strip of tin or heavy

cardboard with a friction strip from match books glued to both

• sides.

In field use the friction type ignitor can be hidden in

many ways connected with trip wires or attached to movable objects

to set off either instant or delayed charges.

THERMAL IGNITORS. In some cases the ignitor, (fuse or primer).'

can be used as a trigger mechanism.

For example in World War II

the Germans were known to tear down fireplaces and cement them

back together with hidden charges that would ignite when a fire

was built. A simple hand grenade or mortar shell hidden in a

hollow log by a burned out fire would, of course, explode lf the

10g were used

as fuel without being inspected.

A common trick is for a retreating army to leave behind coal

011 lamps oi lanterns filled with gasoline. An unthinking person

who touches a match to such a lantern will nearly always be burned

to death.

CHEMICAL TRIGGERS. These are more frequently used in the

construction of time bombs than in booby traps. Figure No. 8

NW 68262 Docld:32989569 Page 245

## Page 246

COMP

shows an Italian

chemical delay igniter. The upper chamber

contains acetone.

When the piercing pin is pushed downward it

penetrates the lead disc and allows the acctone to flow into the

lower chamber.

The acetone gradually dissolves the celluloid

washer which holds back the striker. The time delay can be varied

by placing different numbers of cellophane washers on the striker

tod.

In several similar types of delayed mechanisms the striker

Is held back by a thin metal wire which is gradually dissolved

when a solution of acid is allowed to surround it.

Other types of delay mechanisms may be constructed where a

liquid is allowed

to drop through a small hole into a lower con-

tainer having a reactive substance attached part way up one wall.

• The liquid level

in the chamber gradually raises until it comes

in contact with the reactive substance which is the igniter. One

suitable combination is sulfuric acid for the liquid and a mixture

of potassium chlorate and sugar for the solid. Another suitable

combination is plain water for the liquid and

metallic sodium for

the solid. There are many other combinations which a chemist might

improvise from materials at hand.

There are some explosives so sensitive that they can be used

as trigger mechanisms.

Ammonium tri-iodide can be made from

ordinary household ammonia and iodine crystals. If the iodine

crystals are not available they can be obtained by evaporating

sufficient volume of tincture of iodine in a flat glass dish..

Place two or three teaspoons of lodine crystals in a piece

of kleenex and wet thoroughly with strong ammonia solution. A

small amount of ammonia may be added from time to time making

certain that it does not have the chance to dry out.

After three

or four tablespoons of ammonia solution have been absorbed and

partly evaporated from the iodine it can be left to dry out. While

wet ammonium tri-jodide is reasonably safe to handle.

it is so sensitive that it detonates at the slightest touch. It

may be exploded by a person walking on a wooden floor several feet

away or a door being closed in the same building. The amount

described above will produce a violent explosion

treated with extreme caution.

Several similar compounds will be

mentioned in the chapter on explosives.

One or two teaspoonsful of mercury fulminate of silver

fulminate mixed (very gently) with ten percent coarse sand can

be placed in a small packet of paper and attached to the upper

side of an automobile tirc with adhesive tape.

When the tire rolls

over it the fulminate will explode with sufficient power to destroy

even a husky truck tire. These combinations also are very danger-

ous to handle.

READY MADE BOOBY TRAPS

All national armics are supplied with a variety of

manufactured trigger devices, charges, etc. to be uscd

specifically as booby trap material.

Most firing devices

are threaded on one end with a standing size that allows them to

be used either with prepared charges or with improvised charges

made from mortar or artillery shells.

Figure No. 9 shows a

simple firing device attached to a hand grenade.

An antipersonnel mine of French manufacture is shown in

Figure No. 10. The apparatus at the left side is a trigger

mechanism

that can be operated by a trip wire.

When it is fired

the flash

passes through the "y" tube which propels a 60mm

grenade into the air and at the same time ignites a il's second

delay pellet. The grenade explodes a few feet off the ground

to shower metal fragments over a wide area. Total weight of

mine is 5-1/2 pounds.

Guerrilla bands have sometimes used artillery shells or

mortar shells in demolition work by placing them 'in a large

pile of wood or other combustible material and building a bond

fire around them until they exploded. For booby traps use, however,

the projectile of an artillery shell is the only part of any

value. Useful sizes include 75mm, 90mm, 105mm, and 155mm.

In

those artillery shells where the prjectile is attached to the case,

it is generally best to remove the projectile and discard the case.

Artillery shell projectiles may be fused either in the nose or

in the base.

For most efficient use, the regular fuse must be

unscrewed

and a standard firing device (M10 Universal destructor)

put in Its place.

IMPROVISED BOOBY TRAPS

Standard hand grenades can be used alone in booby traps

in a number of methods. The simplest is to carefully remove

the handle and wedge the grenade between two heavy objects

strong enough to hold the spring in the cocked position.

Another trick is to cover a hand grenade with wet mud with

just the safety pin ring sticking out.

After the mud has hardened,

it will hold the handle in place and the safety pin ring can be

withdrawn. These harmless looking clumps of mud scattered along -.

a dirt road will,. of course, break open when hit by an automobile

tire which will relcase the handle and fize the grenade. A similar

trick is to place grenades in glass jars tight enough to hold tis..

handle in place when the safety pins are withdrawn.

may be strung on a wire across a road and

may not be seen by a

• car traveling at night with its lights off.

When the bottles

break the grenade handles are released and they soon explode.

: It seems doubt

that man's ingenuity will e

exhausted when it sumes to improvising traps of varzous types.

A rusty nail stuck to a voard left where it will be stepped

on by a running enemy may be just as deadly to that one indivi-

dual as an atomic bomb.

Open pits (sometimes with-sharp stakes

ai the bottom, coverud with flimsy camouflage is much older than

the bow and arrow, but were still used by the Japanese in World

"Dead falls" made from heavy tree limbs that fall when a

victim releases them by tripping over a jungle vine can still

be useful in guerrilla wartare.

Leaving behind poisoned food or bottled drinks is common.

Alcoholic diinks are casily diluted with wood alcohol (temporary

type antifreeze) equal to 1/4 their content of ethyl alcohol

without detection. A total intake of 2 or 3 ounces will cause

blindness or death in a few hours. Soft drinks can be easily

poisoned with ethylene glycol (permanent type antifreeze) at

the rate of 2 ounces per bottle.

This dose is usually fatal

and once symptoms develop there is no known antidote.

When five parts of potassium permanganate is mixed with

one pärt of powdered sugar it forms a combination that vill

either explode (if confined) or burn with a flash if ignited in

the open.

A new idea might be to put three or four tablespoonsful

of this material in an ash tray covered with a thin dust of cig-

aretie ashes.

The first person to put his cigarette out in that

particular ash tray would be burned bad enough to be out of

commission for quite some time.

Black powder, if available, would

actually explode if used in this way.

• USE OF BOOBY TRAPS

It is obvious that the use of hooby traps favors an army in

retreat, and one of their greatest uses is to slow down pursuit.

For most efficienr. use the laying of booby traps must be done in

a planned ind coordinated method. When time permits the entire

area to be booby trapped should be reconnoitered and the placement

of available material planned in such a way as to confuse the enemy,

impede his progress and cause maximum number of casualties.

Generally speaking a large number of small booby traps are

preferred lo a fen large ones.

Two or more triggers may be

autached to a single charge.

Variety of types and settings is

essential to effective use

of booby traps in iage numbers.

In the event that friendly troops or your own personnel

may ic-enter such an area later on, it is desirabic that a written

record and detailed maps be kept as to where boody traps are

placed. When U.S. Army troops discover a place that is booby

, trapped they mark it with a sign which consasts of a red trlangle

the word

When anti-vehicle mines are placed by regular army forces

it is common practice to booby trip the mines so they will ex-

plode when being renoved by personnel attempting tò

clear the

area.

The use of booby traps is very adaptable to boch guerrilla

and countcr-guerrilla activily. Guerrilla warfarc involves

two

basic types of action: ambushes and raids. When the guerrillas

ambush regular army forces, they are the ones that will make usc

of the booby traps. In raiding an enemy garrison or supply depot

they must beware of booby traps that the regular forces have

placed to protect their fixed positions.

The ambush may start when the leading vehicle of an enemy

column strikes a mine or drives on to a bridge which is dynamited.

Perhaps time delay booby traps activated by the first vehicle in

the column may be used to destroy other vehicles several positions

behind. Troops riding in a truck convoy may be expected to seek

cover in ditches beside the road or other points of natural pro

tection. If these ditches have been booby trapped beforehand, they

• will be killed in the very process of seeking shelter.

Before making any raid on a fixed enemy position, guerrilla

forces should carefully consider the potential danger of booby

when regular army forces are being harrassed by guerrillas

they may be expected to leave supplies badly needed by the guerrillas

in slightly protected warehouses as traps. These supplies may be

heavily booby trapped and counter guerrilla forces may

be waiting

& short distance away to take pursuit. To guard against these

things, the guerrilla should attempt to keep their target under

surveillance for several hours or days before making the raid.

They should observe the coming and going of enemy personnel.

If

the enemy is very careful to always come and go by the same route

it may mean that other routes are booby trapped. If the supplies

are not added to or taken from regularly, this may indicate that

they are being used to bait a trap. By scouting the general area

guerrilla forces should guard against surprise by other enemy

After making either a raid or an ambush, guerrilla forces

should place booby traps behind them to slow up pursuit.

Real

booby traps can be interspersed with imitation traps. Io be

safe the enemy will have to go around or de-activate the imitations

path of their retrcat gucrrilla

forces should booby trap alternate

• routes which enemy forces might use to cut them off.

Fellow members,

This month's bulletin will deal mostly with "Booby Traps". Because of the

length of this article we are only sending out the first half this month. The second

half will be published in next month's bulletin. Future bulletins this coming year

will contain material on psychological warfare, urban warfare tactics, communi-

cations, survival equipment, first aid, explosives, weapons, codes, and other re-

lated warfare subjects.

Those members who have not yet completed or started on the organization's

basic training programs are hereby urged to do so. We cannct, in most cases,

assign any member to an importani undergroud project or to an orgarized team

or group until they have completed this training program.

While headquarters cannot assign a member in the above classification to

an established unit, any member can (and is encouraged to) recruit and form their

own combat team (see December 1971 Bulletin). In many cases this may be the

best policy in regards to personal security as the member would be working with

the people he personally knows and trusts. If any member would like to forn their

own unit they should write to their assigned mail drop and the organization will send.

them further instructions along with a Team Recruiting Packet. The article on

"The Dispersed Team" in this month's bulletin should help those members who

wish lo form their own Combat Team.

We are enclosing a smali number of S. A. O. stickers with this month's

bulletin. Please put them in your shirt pocket or billfoid and as soon as possible

sticis them up in phone booths, at bus stops, or other public places that you visit,

The stickers are already gummed and when wet will adhere firmly to glass, metal,

or any other smooth surface. If our members wouid use these stickers along with

the leaflets that are available, it would have a real psychological impact on the

rest of the American people and

give them evidence that there are still. these among

them who are willing to fight for the re-establishment of a Constitutional Republic.

These first stickers are being sent lo each member free, additional stickers and

leaflets can be ordered on the monthly report form.

'HE

DISPERSED TEAM

When discussing a Secret Army Organization "Combat Team", we usually think

of a small group of people who live very close to one another. Such an arrangement

has certain advantages, such as ease of communication and travel for collective

training and tearn operations, but there are also several disadvantages.

Among the disadvantages are these: Team members may be well acquainted

with only a small geographical area. If forced to leave this area the team may be

placed at a serious disadvantage. It is harder for a team of SAO members who

live closely together to keep from attracting attention, thus unit security may be

poor. It one ember of the team is ever discovered and arrested by the enemy,

chances are that all members of the team will be rounded up together.

These considerations have caused us to experiment with a new arrangement that

we refer to as a "Dispersed Team". Such a team has the same number of members

(usually six) as a regular Combat Team. Each team is split into two sections as is

the old team. The members have the same type of individual specialties and duties.

The big difference lies in the fact that the team members may be located over

a comparatively larger area - perhaps as much as 25 to 50 miles in diameter. In

urban areas one team member may live in each of six different cities. Thus the

team may range over a fairly large geographical area with at least one team member

being familiar with the immediate territory through which they are traveling.

When active as part of an underground movement (as opposed to the classical

forms of guerrilla warfare) the Dispersed Team has several other advantages.

For example, if one member of the team gets too "hot" in his area, he automatically

has five other hide-outs to which he can go for assistance or to which he can send

his family for temporary safety. The Dispersed Team can conveniently cover a

larger area in the fields of recruiting, psychological warfare, and propaganda.

Opcrations of sabotage, surveillance and harassment of communist personnel,

raids, and other combat type operations can be successfully conducted while moving

a minimum of people over a minimum distance.

During the present period of deliberate delay the activities of the team will

naturally be different from some future period in which all out warfare between our

organization and our country's communist enemies develops.

If the team is to achieve its ultimate objectives the following astivities must

be provided for: (1) organization of and within the team, (2) communications between

the team and higher command, (3) maintaining secrcey of team members, (4) main-

laining a continuous and cilcetive propaganda effort, (F) obtaining the necessary sup-

plies and equipment for present and future needs, (f) training of the team in goncral,

and of individual members in their own specialties.

When the required personnel are not available to form a full team, a three

man section should be formed. When additional people are iccruited the unit can

then be expanded in an orderly fashion.

BOOBY TRAPS

Expadly defined a booby trap can de any kind of apparatus

in which a reaction unfavorable to the enemy is brought about

when he unintentionally maises some act which triggers the re-

action. The most common types of booby traps used in warfare

involve an explosive charge which is set oit. by movement oi a

tilp wire or the moving of some object which is connected to

the trigger mechanism.

On occasion the explosive chaige may be replaced by

signil flares, gas, smoke or other chemical agents.

The trigger

mechanism may be either electric, mechanical, thermal or chemical.

ELECTRICALLI OPERATED TRIGGERS:

Such trigger mechanisms

are very easily arranged wherever a supply of electric blasting

caps are available and also a suitable source of electricity.

One of the most common electric type booby traps is to simply

Interrupt the electrical circuit in some building so that when

the lights are turned on the explosive is detonated. This

simple procedure applied to an automobile with a few sticka of

dynamite

has marked the end of more than one gangland hoodlum.

To booby trap a car in this manner one side of the electric

blasting cap can be attached to any metal part of the car while

the other side is attached to a spark plug or the "cold side"

of the ignition

switch.

In the first case the cap detonates the

dynamite when the starter motor is turned over or if attached to

the key switch detonating occurs when the ignicion is turned on.

Any movable object can be booby trapped so that when it

18 moved some simple type electrical switch contact is closed

to complete a circuit between a dry cell battery and the deo

tonator.

A very simple example would be to have one wire tacked

along the edge of a door and the other wire tacked to the frame

and extending out far enough that contact is made between the

two when the door is opened. A slightly more refined trigger

Involves two small springs separated by some thin piece of in-

sulation at one end

as shown in Figure No. l. When pressure

1s applied, the springs are held apart and when the pressure

Is released, the springs come together to make electrical con-

tact.

the

This may be placed in a door which is then closed to open

switch while the explosive is wired into the circuit.

When

the door is opened pressure is released and the charge explodes.

This simple trigger can be placed under the leg of a chair,

a wooden box or any other movable object of sufficient veight.

If the chair 18 moved or tie box lifted the release of pressure

• will close the electrical circuit.

A person skilled in the placement of booby traps will not

leave any part of the switch, wires or charge visible. Instead of

-1=

NW 68262 Docld:32989569' Page 258.

## Page 259

connecting the wires to the door itself. he will take off the door

frame, place the trigger mechanism at the edge of the doci and

then replace the frame so that the entire mechanism is hidden when

the door is closed.

By taking off the frame of a window and drilling a hole

out through the window casing the trigger mechanism can' be placed

so that the charge will be detonated by either raising or lowering

a half open window.

A simple time delay mechanism can be arranged by placing

one of these triggers under a glass jar filled with water. When

enough of the water evaporates, the weight of the jar will no

longer be sufficient to hold the contacts open.

Figure No. 2 shows another simple electrical trigger made

from a spring clothes pin. The improvised contacts are held

apart by a small wooden wedge in the jaws of the clothes pin.

This wedge can be attached to a trip wire or other movable object.

When it is withdrawn the clothes pin shuts and the electric cir-

cult is completed.

A trigger of this type can be used to make a time delay

mechanism

in many different ways.

The wedge may be connected by

a loose cord to the end of a spring which is also attached to a

tin can.

Above this a second tin can full of sand or water is

placed

with a hole in the bottom so that the contents

gradually

fall through into the second can. When the weight of the lower

can

becomes

enough to stretch the spring sufficiently the wedge

will be pulied from the clothes pin.

As an alternate method the

spring may be already stretched out and held there by a second

cord attached to some other solid object. The cord holding the

spring could be placed through a candle so that it will be burned

in two when the candle burned down a certain distance.

An active

imagination can devise countless ways for activating this type

of trigger either by instant action or delayed action.

A clever derivative of this simple trigger is used in the

"British book trap"

• In this case a book is hollowed

out to

contain a small battery and a quarter pound block of TNI which

1s detonated by an electrical blasting cap. The circuit passes

through two contacts attached to opposite pages of the book but

are held apart by some insulating material which is attached to

the back of the bookcase. If the book is withdrawn from the case

the contacts come together and the TNT is detonated.

A British ball bearing contact switch is shown in Figure No.

3. This type of contact is very uscful in placing chaiges entirely

within a movable object.

For example, a suitcase could be laid

on its side with the contact positioned inside in such a way that

when the suitcase was picked up the ball bearing would roll forward

• and complete the contact. Similar electrically activated booby

-2-

## Page 260

traps could be placed in closed gasoline cans, canteens, ammuni-

tion boxes or dozens of other objects which an enemy would place

right side up before opening. A plastic or glass test tube

could be used instead of a metal case by sticking two wires through

the cork in such a manner that the ball bearing would come in

contact with both of them.

A surprisingly accurate timing device can be made with a

tube of this type.

Holding the tube with the open end up, first

pour in a quantity of dried peas, then a measured amount of

water, drop in the ball bearing (in this case a wad of tin foil

could be used as well), finally put the cork in the top with the

wire sticking down through.

The water will cause the dried peas

to swell which will push the ball bearing (or wad of tin foil)

up until it makes contact with the two wires to complete the

circuit.

The time can be regulated from a few minutes to several

hours depending on the length of the tube, the amount of water, and

the quantity of peas used.

Far more sophisticated types of electrical triggers are manu-

factured some of which operate by photoelectric cell or even more

difficult to recognize mechanisms. These may be used to safeguard

record centers, important military or missile bases, etc. but are

seldom encountered under battlefield conditions.

MECHANICAL TRIGGERS. These may be operated either by impact

or by friction. The ordinary hand grenade employs an impact

trigger. When the handle is released a spring operated lever snaps

against a cap (similar to the priming cap in a shotgun shelly

which in turn starts a short fuse to burn. This fuse leads to a

blasting cap centered in an explosive charge.

The trigger mechanism of a "potato masher" hand grenade

operates much like the firing pin of a bolt action rifle.

plunger may be released by pulling out a pin as shown in Figure

ox the now largely discontinued mercury fulminate. Characteris-

tics, uses and manufacture of explosives will be dealt with in

another chapter.

A very simple device can be made from a screen door spring

that will explode an ordinary rifle cartridge when activated by a

trip wire. Although the "explosion" is almost harmless it can be

very nerve racking to an approaching enemy.

A more deadly booby trap consists of a short piece of pipe

which is driven into the ground. A plunger type trigger mechanism

is dropped into the pipe and an ordinary rifle cartridge placed

point up in the pipe so that perhaps one-half inch is exposed

above the ground.

The weight of a man stepping on the bullet

releases the trigger and fires the cartridge which will penetrate

well up into the leg or the body, :

Some mechanical triggers are activated by friction just

like striking a match on the rough material of the match cover.

Figure No. I shows a cut-away drawing of the U.S. Army firing

device, pull friction type M-2.

The coated wire is covered with

a gritty substance much like the strip on a book of matches.

When this is pulled out through a container of flash compound

(chemically similar to the match heads) the friction ignites the

flash compound which may be used either to light a fuse or fire

a blasting cap.

A crude but effective friction device can be prepared by

sticking the end of a fuse in some small cylinder filled with

match heads through which is placed a small strip of tin or heavy

cardboard with a friction strip from match books glued to both

sides:

In field use the friction type ignitor can be hidden in

many ways connected with trip wires or attached to movable objects

to set off either instant or delayed charges.

THERMAL IGNITORS. In some cases the ignitor, (fuse or primer) *

can be used as a trigger mechanism. For example in World War II.

the Germans were known to tear down fireplaces and cement then

back together with hidden charges that would ignite when a fixe

was built. A simple hand grenade or mortar shell hidden in a

hollow 10g by a burned out fire would, of course, explode 1f the

log were used as fuel without being inspected.

A common trick is for a retreating army to leave behind coal

oil lamps or lanterns filled with gasoline. An unthinking person

who touches a match to such a lantern will nearly always be burned

to death.

CHEMICAL TRIGGERS. These are more frequently used in the

construction of time hombs than in booby traps. Figure No. 8

shows an Italian chemical delay igniter. The upper chamber

contains acetone. When the piercing pin is pushed downward it

penetrates the lead disc and allows the acctone to flow into the

lower chamber.

The acetone gradually dissolves the celluloid

washer which holds back the striker.

The time delay can be varied

by placing different numbers of cellophane washers on the striker

rod.

In several

similar types of delayed mechanisms the striker

is held back by a thin metal wire which is gradually dissolved

when a

solution of acid is allowed to surround.it.

Other types of delay mechanisms may be constructed where a

liquid is allowed to drop through a small hole into a lower con-

tainer having a reactive substance attached part way up one wall.

The liquid level in the chamber gradually raises until it comes

suitable combination is sulfuric acid for the liquid and a mixture

of potassium chlorate and sugar for the solid. Another suitable

combination is plain water for the liquid and metallic sodium for

the solid. There are many other combinations which a chemist might

improvise from materials at hand.

There are some explosives so sensitive that they can be used

as trigger mechanisms. Ammonium tri-iodide can be made from

ordinary household ammonia and iodine crystals. If the iodine

crystals are not available they can be obtained by evaporating

sufficient volume of tincture of iodine in a flat glass dish.

Place two or three teaspoons of iodine crystals in a piece

of kleenex and wet thoroughly with strong ammonia solution.

A

small amount of anmonia may be added from time to time making

certain that it does not have the chance to dry out.

After three

or four tablespoons of ammonia solution have been absorbed and

partly evaporated from the lodine it can be left to dry out.

While

wet ammonium tri-iodide is reasonably safe to handle. When dry,

it is so sensitive that it detonates at the slightest touch. It

may be exploded by a person walking on a wooden floor several feet

away or a door being closed in the same building. The amount

described above will produce a violent explosion and should be

treated with

extreme caution.

Several

similar compounds will be

mentioned in the chapter on explosives.

One or two teaspoonsful of mercury fulminate of silver

fulminate mixed (very gently) with ten percent coarse sand can

be placed in a small packet of paper and attached to the upper

side of an automobile tire with adhesive tape.

When the tire rolls

over it the fulminate will explode with sufficient power to destroy

even a husky truck tire. These combinations also are very danger

ous to handle.

READY MADE BOOBY TRAPS

All national armics are supplied with a varicty of

manufactured trigger devices, charges, etc. to be used

specifically as booby trap material.

Most firing devices

are threaded on one end with a standing size that allows them to

be used either with prepared charges or with improvised charges

made from mortar or artillery shells.

Figure No. 9 shows a

simple firing device attached to a hand grenade.

An antipersonnel mine of French manufacture is shown in

Figure No. 10. The apparatus at the left side is a trigger

mechanism that can be operated by a trip wire. When it is fired

the flash

passes through the "y" tube which propels a 60mm

grenade into the air and at the same tine ignites a 1/5 second

delay pellet. The grenade explodes a

few feet off the ground

to shower metal fragments over a wide area. Total weight of

mine is 5-1/2 pounds.

Guerrilla bands have sometimes used artillery shells or

mortar shells in denolition work by placing them in a large

pile of wood or other

combustible material and building a bond

fire around them until they exploded. For booby traps use, however,

the projectile of an

artillery shell is the only part of any

value.

Useful sizes include 75mm, 90mm, 105mm, and 155mm.

In

those artillery shells where the prjectile is attached to the case,

it is generally best to remove the projectile and discard the case.

Artillery shell projectiles may be fused either in the nose or

in the base.

For most efficient use, the regular fuse must be

unscrewed and a standard firing device (Ml0 Universal destructor)

put in its place.

IMPROVISED BOOBY TRAPS

Standard hand grenades can be used alone in booby traps

in a number of methods. The simplest is to carefully remove

the handle and wedge the grenade between twe heavy objects

strong enough to hold the spring in the cocked position.

Another trick is to cover a hand gienade with wet mud with

just the safety pin ring sticking out. After the mud has hardened,

it will hold the handle in place and the safety pin ring can be

withdrawn.

These harmless looking clumps of mud scattered along

a dirt road will, of course, break open when hit by an automobile

tire which will relcase the handle and fire the grenade. A similar

trick is to place gienades in

glass jars tight enough to hold the

handle in place when the safety pins

are withdrawn.

At night these

may be strung on a wire across a rnad and may not be seen by a

car traveling at night with its lights off. When the bottles

break the grenade handles are released and

they soon explode.

It seems doubtful that man's ingenuity will ever be

exhausted when it comes to improvising traps of various types.

A rusty nail stuck to a board left where it will be stepped

on by a running enemy may be

just as deadly to that one indivi-

dual as an atomic bomb.

Open pits (sometimes with sharp stakes

ai the bottom) covered with flimsy camouflage is much older than

the bow and arrow, but were still used by the Japanese' in World

War II.

"Dead falls" made from heavy tree limbs that fall when a

victim releases them by tripping over a jungle vine can still

be useful in guerrilla warfare.

Leaving behind poisoned food or bottled drinks is common.

Alcoholic drinks are easily diluted with wood alcohol (temporary

type antifreeze) equal to

1/4 their content of ethyl alcohol

without detection. A total intake of 2 or 3 ounces will cause

blindness or death in a few hours. Soft drinks can be easily

poisoned with ethylene glycol (permanent type antifreeze) at

the rate of 2 ounces per bottle.

This dose is usually fatal

and once symptoms develop there is no known antidote.

• When five parts of potassium permanganate is mixed with

one part of powdered sugar it forms a combination that will

either explode (if confined) or burn with a

flash if ignited in

the open.

A new idea night be to put three or four tablespoonsful

of this material in an ash tray covered with a thin dust of cig-

aretre ashes.

The first person to put his cigarette out in that

particular ash tray would be burned bad enough to be out of

commission for quite some time. Black powder, if available, would

actuaily explode if used in this way.

USE OF BOOBY TRAPS

It is obvious that the use of hooby traps favors an army.in

retreat, and one of their greatest uses is to slow down pursuit.

For most efficient use the laying of booby traps cust be done in

a planned and coordinated method. When time permits the entire

area to be booby trapped should be reconnoitered and the placement

of available material planned in such a way as to confuse the enemy,

impede his progress and cause maximum number of casualties.

Generally speaking a large number of small booby traps are

preferied to a few large ones.

Iws or more triggers may be

attached to a single charge.

Variety of types and settings is

essential to effective use of booby traps in large numbers.

in the event that friendly troops or your own personnel

nay re-enter such an area later on, it is desirabie that a written

record and detailed maps be kept as to where boody traps are

placed. When U.S. Army troops discover a place that is booby

trapped they mark it with a sign which consists of a red triangle

booby traps painted in white across the top.

When anti-vehicle mines are placed by regular army forces

it is common practice to booby trap the mines so they will ex-

plode when being removed by personnal attempting to clear the

The use of booby traps is very adaptable to boch guerrilla

and counter-guerrilla activity. Guerrilla warfare involves two

basic types of action: ambushes and raids. When the guerrillas

ambush regular army forces, they are the ones that will make use

of the booby traps.

In raiding an enemy garrison or supply depot

they must beware of booby traps that the regular forces have

placed to protect their fixed positions.

The ambush may start when the leading vehicle of an enemy

column strikes a mine or drives on to a bridge which is dynamited.

Perhaps time delay booby traps activated by the first vehicle in

the column may be used to destroy other vehicles several positions

behind. Troops riding in a truck convoy may be expected to seek

cover in ditches beside the road or other points of natural pro-

tection. If these ditches have been booby trapped beforehand, they

will be killed in the very process of seeking shelter.

Before making any raid on a fixed enemy position, guerrilla

forces should carefully consider the potential danger of booby

traps.

When regular army forces are being harrassed by guerrillas

they may be expected

to leave supplies badly needed by the guerrillas

in slightly protected warehouses as traps.

These supplies may be

heavily booby trapped

and counter guerrilla forces may be waiting.

a short distance away to take pursuit.

To guard against these

things,

the guerrilla should attempt to keep their

target under

surveillance for several hours or days before making the raid.

They should observe the coming and going of enemy personnel.

the enemy is very careful to always. come and go by the same route

it may mean that other routes are booby trapped. If the supplies

are not added to or taken from regularly, this may indicate that

they are being used to bait a trap. By scouting the general area

guerrilla forces should guard against surprise by other enemy

forces waiting within danger distance.

After making either a raid or an ambush, guerrilla forces

should place booby traps behind them to slow up pursuit. Real

booby traps can be interspersed with imitation traps. To be

safe the enemy will have to go around or de-activate the imitations

and take just as much time doing so as if they were real. If the

enemy becomes carelcss in handling your imitation traps, he will

run the danger of getting killed by a live onc. In planning the

path of their retreat guerrilla forces should booby trap alternate

routes which enemy forces might use to cut them off.
