FRANK AUGUST DRAGER, JR. was interviewed while
incarcerated in the Sangamon County Jail. He was furnished
the identity of the interviewing Agents and the purpose of
the interview and he furnished the following information.

. DRAGER stated that he ig presently Sot a member of
any right wing organization. He did admit to being the
organizer and leader of the White Action Hovement (WAH) which
operated at one time out of Trenton, New Jersey, and Reading,
Pennsylvania. He advised that the headquarters operations
of that organization were disbanded due to a lack of finances.
He declined to comment on the names of any members or of
the total number of individuads involved in the WAM. DRAGER
stated the aim of his movement was victory for all right
wing organizations and this was to be accomplished through
political elections or other necessary methods. His metheds
included preaching to the public concerning goals of his
organization and by supporting the right type of individuals
for public office. He considered BOB MII#S, who is presently
incarcerated in the Federal Penitentiary, Leavenworth, Kansas,
to be the type of individual qualified to hold public office.

DRAGER stated that his WAM has adopted a philosophy
of being the coordinator between all right wing organizations
currently operating in this country. He stated that the
strategies and ideals of all right wing groups actually are
very Similar and that when the comlitions are right there
will be a unification for all these groups into one large
organization that will effectively be able to take control
of the country. He stated he originally founded the WAM in
1970 and for a time published and distributed literature in
an attempt to educate the public concerning his beliefs.

He advised that WAM was unable to xecomplish its goals as

an above ground organization and as a result several years

ago he decided to take the organization “under ground",

Although there is no longer any formal organization or
financial backing, WAM still has its officers and membership
but the extent of its activities consists of himself and

others traveling the country preaching the right wing philosopby
to any group that will listen. DRAGER declined to comment

on the number of individuals presently in WAM but did state

he had previously issued 300 membership cards. He again
declined comment concerning the names of any of the organiza-~
tion's leadership or its membership. He did state that the
majority of WAM members were disillusioned members of other
right wing organizations. He advised the uniform of WAN
cousists of military fatigues with a pistol belt with a

half swastika emblem on the collar. This is the uniform he
usually wears during his speaking engagements.

DRAGER stated that recently he had been vacationing
in Florida, living mainly on previous savings. He did work
for approximately 17 days as a chef at the Ocean Reef Club,

Key largo, Florida. He was paid $250 per week there and had
accumulated about $500 at the time of his departure from the
Florida Keys area. He aiso advised he was currently existing
on survival tablets, taking up to 12 tablets daily as a

method to supplement his normal meals, He stated he could
easily maintain his health and weight by use of these tablets.
DRAGER claimed that he is traveling by camper truck and that
since leaving Florida he was en route to New Jersey when
arrested in Springfield, Illinois. He declined to comment

on when he leit Florida or to where he had traveled since

that tim. He further declined comment concerning any metings
he may have attended or any communication he has had with

any individuals connected with extremist organizations during
his traveis, He advised that he usually camps nightly in
either State of Federal park campsites or if none are available
would utilize a commercial camp grounds.

DRAGER stated that the individual who was arrested
with him in Springfield and who has been traveling with hin
Since leaving Florida is CHARLZS MIDDAUGH, who has been a
friend of the family for several years in New Jersey. He
stated Lids:UGIl has bocn in trouble since the age of 13 and
was most recently released in January, 1973, from a juvenile
detention facility in New Jexsey. He stated MIDDAUGH worked
with hin in Florida and that he is currently HIDDAUGH's legal
guardian and will be until his 19th birthday in December,
1974, He advised MIDDAUGH shares some of his same basic
beliefs but is not politically motivated in any way. |

He admitted that DANIEL BRODERICK was the indivi-
dual who was arrested with him by local authorities in New
Jersey in September, 1973, and that he traveled with him for
a period but that BuG@unick had stayed in Florida. Ue advised

itp eee at tae



VAL

SI 157-4275

°

that BRODERICK contacted his lawyer concerning the pending
charges in New Jersey and has probably returned to New Jersey.

DRAGER did admit to past memberships in the American
Nazi Party, National Socialist White Peoples Party, Ku Klux
Klan, Knights of Constantine, as well as generally claiming
membership in all right wing organizations at one time or
another during the past 15 years.

He stated he was recently the self-appointed Acting
Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan in New Jersey. He felt the
organization needed leadership and that he had the respect
of other leaders in the group, but did have some conflicts
with some other independent klan organizations in New Jersey.

DRAGER stated that he, in the past, has been
harassed by local authorities and the Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation but that he has never had any problems with any of the
jeadership of any right wing organization.

He claimed he is not currently a member of the
Minutemen organization but that he does personally know
ROBERT DEPUGH. He declined to comment on the last time he
had any communications with DEPUGH.

DRAGER stated he personally knows several individuals

-associafed with the American Nazi Party, including MATT; KOEHL

and DON PARSONS in Virginia, and first name unknown COLSNAN

in Chigago. He advised that from 19Gi-1967 he was a member
of the/ American Nazi Party and worked in its national head-
quarters in Arlington, Virginia. He worked closely with
GHORGE LINCOLN ROCKWELL during this period as his second in
comand although he would never accept any rank higher than
lieutenant. For a period during 1964~1967 he worked mainly

at the party's training camp in Pennsylvania as the individual
in charge of the printing of all literature for the party.
After ROCKVELL's death, DRAGER, advised he was asked to take
command of the party but he declined because of his past
Criminal record, a>decision he regrets to this day. Approxi-
mitely three months after RCCIIELL's death he left the Nazi
Party. DRAGER feels that MATT KOEHL, the present commander
of the party, has the guts but not the Imow-how to run the
party organization. He does not feel that he has the charisma
that ROCKWELL has and he does not reach the public effectively
with the party's message. DRAGER stated he currently has no

association with the American Nazi Party or with the National
Socialist Vhite Poopices Party. ;

DRAGER advised he knows no one in Illinois associated
| with the American Nagi mond oF e National bocialist White

7 Peoples Party and the name D/H ER moans little to bi
| He docs recall DaxtuR wri ting to his Wii but stated DIZTun
was not at Nazi Party Headquarters in Arlington during the
same period that he served there.

He advised that he knows no one in the Phoenix,
Arizona area since the death of WESTBROOK PAKO (phonetic),
He knows of no right wing activity in that area but he did
recall in the past he communicated with a Nazi Party member ~
there but he no longer recalis this individual's name,

DRAGER stated that all of his travels are basically
politically motivated and that the main philosophy of his
| WAM is victory for white Christianity and a return to the
natural order, He feels that the white race was placed on
this earth as the "gifted race" and that a geographical
separation of the races is necessary to prevent interbreeding
of the races. He contributes the basis of his beliefs to
the writings of HITLER but stated that many of the ancient
philosophers preached the same white supremacy philosophy.
He believes’ that interbreeding of the races wili eventually
Jead to the degeneration of our society and its eventual
downfall,

DRAGER stated that in the event the political

j system fails as a means for the right wing groups in this

i country to save the country from its external and internal
enemies, then any other means necessary will be used to achieve
their goals. He feels that if the Government will not act

to save the country then right wing organizations must act to
do so.

DRAGER stressed the danger of an internal enemy in
the form of an overly suppressive Government that would no
louger act for the well-being of the average white American,
Although he stated again that the right wing extremist
organizations will attempt to gain pover by legitimate political
process, if this process should break down any method, including
that of violence, would be used to accomplish their goals.
He stated thetargets of the right wing would be any suppressive

L-NL68262Docld:32989569 Page dd -G-



I 157-4275

Mw

Governuent agencies or any left wing organization that would
be doing the "bidding". of the suppressive Government in

power. Additional targets of the right wing would include
the United States Treasury Department and the Internal Kevenue
Service, and such organizations as the Jewish Anti-Defamation
league, who although is not a Government agency, he feels

it receives its authority to act from the Government.

DRAGER agreed that to succeed in the violent over-
throw of the country a supply of weapons and ammunition would
be necessary. He stated he knows of no right wing organiza-
tion who currently has a stockpile of weapons and advised
that the source of weapons at the right time would be the
United States military establishment, whose leaders and
white members he predicts will join his cause when it is
time for action. Although he has heard that the Minutemen
organization was stockpiling weapons, he has no evidence that
that organization currently has any large supply of weapons
in its possession.

He stated that he also felt that all the State
units of Government will join his cause at the right time
and that they will revolt against the suppression placed on
them by the Federal Government. -He feels that even personnel
cf the Federal Bureau of Investigation will join his cause
because of their basic conservative beliefs and because of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation's concern for the good
of the country. He feels that the Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation is now only a "pawn" of the Justice Department from
which it receives its orders.

DRAGER continued tosstate his personal philosophy
concerning the pover and influence exerted by the Jewish
population in this country. He considers the total Jewish
control on tke American political system to be the greatest
internal threat present today in our system. He believes
that the Communist movement, all racial organizations, and
all liberal loft wing organizations operating in this
country are toois of the Jewish population in the United
States. He predicts a complete economic takeover by the
Jewish seguent ox our society. £8 examples of the extent
of the Jowish control in this country, DRAGER uses the
appointrent of HENKY KISSINGER as Secretary of State as well
as the fact that the NIXON administration is controlled by
his high-ranking Jewish advisors and by political contributions
furnished by the Jewish population in this country. He also

-7-

NW 68262 Docld:32989569 Page 50



SE 157-4275

ue

stated that all sectors of .the news media are controlled by
Jovs and that they directly control all newspaper publications
either by direct ownership or by controlling the advertising
that newspapers need for their survival, In addition, he
pointed out that the three major radio-television networks

are all headed by Jewish individual and as such they are able
te direct public broadcasting to benefit their own views and
the views of the Jewish segment ‘of our society. DRAGER further
stated that this great influence exerted by Jews in this
country will eventually lead to the degeneration of our
society unless their activities are stopped by actions from

the right wing.

DRAGER stated that as a result of his travels :
throughout the country he has coordinated activities between
the various right wing groups to such a degree that all that
is needed for them to act in unison would be the right
conditions to exist in this country. Ie feels that his
activities are currently peaceful in nature and that he is
determined to work within the present political system for
change, but if conditions should become too suppressive
toward the average white citizenry in this country, then a
time for action will be at hand and if a violent revolution
is necessary to bring about change, it will be used. When
it is time for action DRAGER predicted ® unification of all
the right wing organizations in this country for the good of
the common man.

DRAGER admitted that he confines his activities
and travels to the area east of the Mississippi River and
that he feeis that the Vest is organized enough. He did
admit to having spoken in the past in Pennsylvania, New
York, New Jersey, Toledo,and Columbus, Ohio, and Chicago.

He again declined to comment further regarding his activities
oy indivicuais: he may have been in contact with during his
travels since ieaving New Jersey.

DRAGER refused to comment on any aliasos he may

APPENDIX "
. S

BLACK PANTHER PARTY,
Also. Known as
Black Panther Earby for Self-Defense

oie

“ Aecording to its official newspaper the Black Panther
Party (BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland,
California, to organize black people so they can take control of
the life, politics and the destiny of the black community. It
was organized by Bobby Seale, BPP Chairman, and Huey P. Newton,
BPP Minister of Defense. . Newton was sentenced in 1968 to serve
2 to 15 years after being convicted of manslaughter in connection
with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther", which
. further describes itself as the "Black Community News Service",
stated that the BPP advocates the. use of guns and guerrilla
tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression of the
black people. Residents of the black community are urged to arm
themselves against the police who are consistently referred to in
- the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

‘"Phe Black Panther" issue of September ie 1968, con=
tains an editorial by BPP Minister of Education, George Mason
Murray s which ends with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,
revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture worth
keeping is a revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom everywhere.

. Dynamite! Black Power, Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere,"

Ineluded in the introduction to an article appearing in
the October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the
statement "..2we will not dissent. from American Government. We
will overthrow it". - :

“Issues of "The Black Panther” regularly contain quo=
tations from the writings of Chairman Mao Tse-tung of the People's
Republic of China and feature Mao's statement that acmicocen
power grows out of the barrel of a gun".

‘The national headquarters of the BPP is located at
3106 Shattuck Avenue, Berkeley, California. Branches have been
established at various locations throughout the United States.

Reference is made to communication of this Bureau
- captioned "Unnamed Coalition Being Formed in Richmond, Virginia",
dated December 22, 1969, at Richmond, Virginia.

Referenced communication set forth information relat-
ing to efforts to-organize a "coalition" in Richmond which had |
connections with the Black Panther Farty (BPP) and which received
impetus for its formation as a result of a visit to Richmond
in September, 1969, by Bob lee, then the Field Secretary of
the BPP of Illinois. i

A characterization of the BPP is attached hereto.

Contacts during January and February, 1970, with
confidential source number one and confidential source number
i two, poth of whom have furnished reliable information in the
1 past, revealed that efforts to form a viable "coalition" in
. Richmond, which "coalition" would in essence be a BPP-sponsored
- committee against Fascism, were meeting with great difficulty.

quarters. his source advised that these efforts met with
negative results, The source also advised that the reason

Richmond, which resulted in Jones being unable to fully pay

Gesetription, a statue symbolizing Pagan worship ox idol.

. who seemed extremely well read and an individual who seemed
to have a great deal of sophistication, STAFFORD stated

quarters located at San Diego, California,
the SAO intends to work towards becoming
a nationwide organization.

The Minutemen is a para-military group
organized in June, 1960, by ROBERT B.
DE PUGH in Norkorne, Missouri, as a
resistance to the spread of communism
in the United States by use of guerrilla
tactics, DE PUGH is currently incar-
cerated in a federal penitentiary for
violation of the Federal Firearms Act.

described as being heavily populated by farms and related
businesses. Also during the summer of 1969, a Bothell
Police Officer observed ANDERSON in the company -of several
other white males who were once again conducting some sort
of maneuvers. At this time the officer observed a shotgun
in one of the vehicles, which when measured was just 1/2 inch
over the legal limit. During the early fall of 1963,
ANDERSON approached an officer of the Bothell Police Department
with a weapon to determine if it was legal and under the

“ current interpretations of both Federdl and state law, it
was opined-that the weapon ANDERSON had was legal, but no
record was maintained as to the type of weapon.

PLANCICH stated that ANDERSON, in the past, has
purchased old Bothell Police Department vehides and it was
PLANCICH's opinion that ANDERSON did this to satisfy some
unknown egomania that he felt ANDERSON had. PLANCICH
stated that he knew of no violent acts committed by ANDERSON
at any time.

PLANCICH stated that the only close friends and
acquaintances that he knows of ANDERSON's are as follows:

these sources will be maintained for possible information
on the SAO. :

SAM NAPIER is currently undersoing investigation

PX T-1 advised on May 26, 1972, that the captioned
. group has been endeavoring to take on an organizational

structure since October, 1971, .He states that, while the
group is motivated by the same principles which brought the
Minutemen into existence, the Secret Army Organization (SAO)
is taking a more cautious approach than the Minutemen in
its recruitment of membership, in order to avoid the
assimilation of people of poor reputation,

In California, notably in San Diego, the SAO
has recently had to sift the letters and applications being
received there because of the obvious eccentric type person
endeavoring to find acceptance in the group.

Concerning Arizona, source advised that the SAO
has mailed a considerable amount of literature pertaining
to the SAO to "conservative" thinking people, but has not
at this time received response from the type of people they
wish to affiliate. Consequently, no formal chapter or
nucleus around which to organize has been formed in
Arizona, However, a coordinator has been named and is
operating. Source advised that not all former Minutemen
will be accepted into the SAO,

Source advised that the SAO foresees a decentralized
type of operation in each State, where in a revolutionary
situation brought about by treasonous communist elements,
the SAO could present a militant front immediately, Recent

introduced the thought that “the basic battle facing our
country today is the one between individualism and
collectivism. In its political’ form it appears as personal
freedom versus police-state regimentation.....In times

of emergency, our members are not going to depend on
General Headquarters for training material, bulletins

Communications to and from higher commands may be uncertain
and the transmission of organization orders may be slow.
We must have people who think for themselves, Equally
important, we must have people who can see what needs

to be done and get at it without being told."

to the spread of communism in the United States

a

PX T-1 advised on April 26, 1972, that during
his contact with members of the Secret Army Organization
(SA0) in February, 1972, Sam Davis, also known as Jerry
Davis, and one Cy Anderson, posed the question to an SAO
group as to what measures could be taken by the SAO to
counter disruptions by revolutionary groups at the
Republican National Convention, This question was never
discussed at great length, but in this connection, one
member suggested that old junk-type cars be parked at
strategic locations where, in the event of confrontation
with dissident elements, the SAO members could have access
to the necessary weapons hidden in the cars. Since the
time of the above discussion, however, SAO leadership
appears to have had second thoughts on the matter because
the latter have been heard to say that they are going
to stay out of San Diego entirely during the Republican
National Convention in order to preclude any untoward
incident that could be attributed to the presence of
the SAO and redound to the discredit of the SAO.

Informant advised that he has not been present
when sources of weapons may have been discussed by the
SAO, but states that he is aware of the fact that leaders
of the SAO have attended gun shows at every opportunity,
notably at Yuma, Arizona, on October 15, 16, 1971, and
again at Yuma on February 25, 26, 1972, and at Phoenix,
Arizona, on March 25, 26, 1972,

GENERAL HEADQUARTERS — JANUARY 1972

/
"God grants liberty only to those who love it and are always willing to guard and
defend it". | Daniel Webster :

Fellow members,

This month's bulletin will deal mostly with "Booby Traps", Because of the \

dength of this article we are only sending out the first half this month, The second 4

half will be published in next month's bulletin. Future bulletins this coming year _

vill contain material on psychological warfare, urban warfare tactics, communi-;

---—cations, survival-equipmeni, first aid, explosives, weapons, codes, and other zen
lated warfare subjects. :

Those members who have not yet completed or started on the organization's
basic training programs are hereby urged to do so. We cannot, in most cases,
assign any member to an impsziant underground project or to an organized team
or group until they have compicted this training program.

While headquarters cannot assign a member in the above classification to

_ an established unit, any member can (and is encouraged to) recruit and form their
own combat team (see December 1971 Bulletin). In many cases this may be the
best policy in regards to personal security as the member would be working with

- the people he personally knows and irusts. If any member would like to form their
own unit they should write to their assigned mail drop and the organization will send
them further instructions along with a Team Recruiting Packet. The article on .°
"The Dispersed Team" in this month's bulletin should help those members who
wish to form their own Combat Team. 7

’ We are enclosing a small number of S.A.O. stickers with this month's
bulletin. Plcase put them in your shirt pocket or billfold and as soon as possible
stick them up in phone booths, at bus stops, or other prblic places that you visit.
The stickers ure already gummed and when wet will adhere firmly io glass, metal,
or any other smooth surface. If our members would use these stickers along with
the leaflets that are available, it would have a real psychological impact on the
rest of the American people and give them evidence that there are still those among
thém who are willing to fight for the re-establishment of a Constitutional Republic.
These first stickers are being sent to euch member free, additional stickers aud
leaflets can be ordered on the monthly report form.

SRT Se i a=
_ When discussing a oe: Army Organization "Comba pen, we usually think
. Of a small group of people Who live very close to one another. Such an arrangement ~
has certain advantages, such as ease of communication and travel for collective
training and team operations, but there are also several disadvantages.

Among the disadvantages are these: Team members may be well acquainted
with only a small geographical area. If forced to leave this area the team may be
placed at a serious disadvantage. It is harder for a team of SAO members who
live closely together to keep from attracting atiention, thus unit security may be
poor. If one rember of the team is ever discovered and arrested by the enemy,
chances are that all members of the team will be rounded up together.

These considerations have caused us to experiment with a new arrangement that
+ we refer to as a "Dispersed Team". Such a team has the same number of members
{usually six) as a regular Combat Team. Each team is split into two sections as is
the old team. The members have the same type of individual specialties and duties.

The big difference lies in the fact that the team members may be located over
* a comparatively larger area - perhaps aS much as 25 to 50 miles in diameter. In
urban areas one team-member may live in each of six different cities. Thus the
team may range over a fairly large geographical area with at least one team member,
being familiar with the immediate territory through which they are traveling.

- -When active as part of an underground movement (as opposed to the classical
. forms of guerrilla warfare) the Dispersed Yeam has several other advantages,
For example, if one member of the team gets too "hot" in his area, he automatically
has five other hide-outs to which he can go for assistance or to which he can send
his family for temporary safety. The Dispersed Team can conveniently cover a
larger area in the fields of recruiting, psychological warfare, and propaganda.
Operations of sabotage, surveillance and harassment of. communist personnel,
raids, and other combat type operations can be sticcessfully conducted while moving
“a minimum of people over a minimum distance.

During the present period of deliberate delay the activities of the team will ‘
i naturally be different from some future period in which all out warfare between our
organization and our country's communist enemies develops.

i If the team is to achieve its ultimate objectives the following activitics must

be provided for: (1) organization of and within the team, (2) communications between
the.team and higher command, -(3) maintaining secrecy. of team members, (4) main-
taining a continuous and effective propaganda effort, (5) obtaining the necessary sup-
plies and equipment for present and future needs, (6) training of the team in general, ~
and of individual members in their own specialties,

When the required personnel arc not available to form a full team, a three
maa'‘scction should be formed. When additional people are recruited the unit can
then be expanded in an orderly fashion.

@ BOOBY TRAPS

Bréadly defined a booby trap can be any kind of apparatus
fn which a reaction unfavorable to the enemy is brought abour
when he unintentionally makes some act which triggers the re-=
action. The most common types of booby traps used in warfare
involve an explosive charge which is set off by movement of a
trip wire or the moving of some object which is connected to
the trigger mechanism.

On occasion the explosive charge may be replaced by
signal flares, gas, smoke or other chemical agents. The trigger
mechanism may be either electric, mechanical, thermal or chemical,

ELECTRICALLY OPERATED TRIGGERS. Such trigger mechanisms
are very easily arranged wherever a supply of electric blasting
caps are available and also a suitable source of electricity,
One of the most common electric type’booby traps is to simply
interrupt the electrical circuit in some building so that when
the lights are turned on the explosive is detonated, This
simple procedure applied to an automobile with a few sticks of
dynamite has marked the end of more than one gangland hoodlum.
To booby trap a car in this manner one side of the electric
blasting cap can be attached to any metal part of the car while
the other side is attached to a spark plug or the “cold side"
of.the ignition switch, In the first case the cap detonates the
dynamite when the starter motor is turned over or if attached to
the key switch detonating occurs when the ignition is turned on,

Any movable object can be booby trapped so that when it
is moved some simple type electrical switch contact is closed
-to complete a circuit between a dry cel] battery and the de-
tonator. <A very simple example would be to have one wire tacked
along the edge of a door and the other wire tacked to the frame
and extending out far enough that contact is made between the
two when the door is opened. A slightly more refined trigger
involves two small springs separated by some thin piece of in-
sulation at one end as shown in Figure No. 1. When pressure
is applicd, the springs are held apart end when the pressure
is released, the springs come together to meke electrical con-
tact. This may be placed in a door which is then closed to open
the switch while the explosive is wired into the circuit, When
the door is opened pressure is released and the charge explodes.

This simple trigger can be placed under the leg of a chair,
& wooden box or any other movable object of sufficient weight.
If the chair is moved or the box lifted the release of preasure
- WALL close the electrical circuit,

A person skilled in the placement of booby traps will not
leave any part of the switch, wires or charge visible. Instead of

sent



* connecting the wirgs to the door itself he will off the door:
frame, place the @...: mechanism at the edge of Whe door and

. <efhen replace the frame so that the entire mechanism is hidden when

tae . “the door is closed.

* By taking off the frame of a window and drilling a hole
+gut’ through the window casing the trigger mechanism can’be placed
a-that the charge will be detonated by either raising or lowering
half open window.

A simple time delay mechanism can be arranged by placing
yane.of these triggers under a glass jar filled with water. When
eneagh of the water evaporates, the weight of the jar will no
longer be sufficient to hold the contacts open,

“Figure No. ‘2 shows another simple electrical trigger made
from a spring clothes pin. The improvised contacts are held
apart by a small wooden wedge in the jaws of the clothes pin.
This wedge can be attached to a trip wire or other movable object.
When it is withdrawn the clothes pin shuts and the electric cir-
euit is completed,

A trigger of this type can be used to make a time delay
mechanism in many different ways. The wedge may be connected by
a loose cord to the end of a spring which is also attached to a
-- Siti can, -Above this a second tin can fuli of sand or water is

placed with a hole in the bottom so that the contents gradually
~ fall through into the second can. When the weight of the lower
can becomes enough to stretch the spring sufficiently the wedge
will be pulied from the clothes pin. As an alternate method the
spring may be already stretched out and held there by a second
‘cord attached to some other solid object. The cord holding the

: in two when the candle burned down a certain distance.’ An active
imagination can devise countless ways for activating this type
of trigger either by instant action or delayed action.

A clever derivative of this simple trigger is used in the
“British book trap", In this casefa book is hollowed out to
~ contain a small battery and a quarter pound block of INT which
is detonated by an electrical blasting cap. The circuit passes
through two contacts attached to opposite pages of the book but
are held apart by some insulating material which is attached to
the back of the bookcase. If the book is withdrawn from the case
the contacts come together and the INT is detonated.!
A British ball bearing contact switch is shown in Figure No,
3. This type of contact is very useful in placing charges entirely
within a movable object. For example, a suitcase could be laid
on its side with. the contact positioned inside in such a way that
when the suitcase was picked up the ball bearing would roll forward
+ and complete the contact. Similar electrically activated booby

traps could be pi@e in closed gasoline cans, cMeons, ammunis”
tion boxes or dozens of other objects which an enemy would place
right side up before opening. A plastic or glass test tube

could be used instead of a metal case by sticking two wires through
the cork in such a manner that the ball bearing would come in
contact with both of them.

L A surprisingly accurate timing device can be made with a
tube of this type. Holding the tube with the open end up, first
pour in a quantity of dried peas, ten a measured amount of
water, drop in the ball bearing (in this case a wad of tin foil
could be used as weil), finally put the cork in the top with the
wire sticking down through. The water will cause the dried peas
to swell which will push the ball bearing (or wad of tin foil)

i up until it makes contact with the two wires to complete the
circuit. The time can be regulated from a few minutes to several
hours depending on the length of the tube, the amount of water, and
the quantity of peas used.

Far more sophisticated types of electrical triggers are manu-
factured some of which operate by photoelectric cell or even more
difficult to recognize mechanisms. These may be used to safeguard
record centers,- important military or missile bases, etc. but are
seldom encountered under battlefield conditions.

MECHANICAL TRIGGERS. These may be operated either by impact
or by friction. The ordinary hand grenade employs an impact
trigger. When the handle is released a spring operated lever snaps
‘against a cap (similar to the priming cap in a shotgun shell)
which in turn starts a short fuse to burn, This fuse leads to a
blasting cap centered in an explosive charge.

ql : The trigger mechanism of a “potato masher" hand grenade
operates much like the firing pin of a bolt action rifle. In
this case a spring activated plunger strikes a detonator. The
plunger may be released by pulling out a pin as shown in Figure
No. 4, by cutting a wire as shown in Figure No, 5 or by applying.
_pressure to a slotted key as shown in Figure No. 6.

Explosion of the primer cap alone is not sufficient to de-
tonate most military explosives. Generally a booster charge of a
fairly sensitive cxplosive is detonated by the primer and this in
turn detonates the main charge. In military use INT is by far the
most common explosive used in the main charge of booby traps.

So called "plastic explosive" or "Composition C-3" contains 78
percent RDX and 22% plasticizer made up of mixture of dinitrotolune,
TNT, nitrocellulose and dimethylformamide. RDX is cyclotrimethy-
lenetrinitramine which is manufactured by nitrating hexamethylene~
tetramine (which is obtained by the reaction of formaldchyde and
ammonia).

Booster charges where necessary are usually tetryl or PEIN,
. Common explosives used in primers are lead azide, lead styphnate

or the now Dea eae ‘mercury fulminat®® Characteris-
tics, uses and manufacture of explosives will be dealt with in
another chapter.

A very simple device can be made from a screen door spring
that will explode an ordinary rifle cartridge when activated by a
trip wire. Although the “explosion is almost harmless it can be
very nerve racking to an approaching enemy.

A more deadly booby trap consists of a short piece of pipe
which is driven into the ground, A plunger type trigger mechanism
is dropped into the pipe and an ordinary rifle cartridge placed
point up in the pipe so that perhaps one-half inch is exposed
above the ground. The weight of a man stepping on the bullet
releases the trigger and fires the cartridge which will penetrate
well up into the leg or the body,

Some mechanical triggers are activated by friction just
like striking a match on the rough material of the match cover.
Figure No. 7 shows a cut-away drawing of the U.S. Army firing
device, pull friction type M-2, The coated wire is covered with
a gritty substance much like the strip on a book of matches.
When this is pulled out through a container of flash compound
(chemically similar to the match heads) the friction ignites the
flash compound which may be used either to light a fuse or fire

.@ blasting cap.

A crude but effective friction device can be prepared by

sticking the end of a fuse in some small cylinder filled with

match heads through which is placed a small strip of tin or heavy
cardboard with a friction strip from match books glued to both

sides.

In field use the friction type ignitor can be hidden in
many ways connected with trip wires or attached to movable objects
to set off either instant or delayed charges.

THERMAL IGNITORS, In some cases the ignitor, (fuse or primer) i

can be used as a trigger mechanism. For example in World War IT
the Germans were known to tear down fireplaces and cement them
back together with hidden charges that would ignite when a fire *
was built. A simple hand grenade or mortar shell hidden in a
hollow log by a burned out fire would, of course, explode if the
log were used as fuel without being inspected.

A common trick is for a retreating army to leave behind coal
oil lamps o: lanterns filled with gasoline. An unthinking person
who touches a match to such a lantern will nearly always be burned
to death.

. CHEMICAL TRIGGERS. ‘These are more frequently used in the
construction of time bombs than in booby traps. Figure No. 8

wh

shows an Ae. chemical delay igniter. The upper chamber
contains acetone. When the piercing pin is pushed downward it
penetrates the lead disc and allows the acctone to flow into the
lower chamber, The acetone gradually dissolves the celluloid
washer which holds back the striker. The time delay can be varied
by placing different numbers of cellophane washers on the striker
rod,

vf

In several similar types of delayed mechanisms the striker
is held back by a thin metal wire which is gradually dissolved
when a solution of acid is allowed to surround it.

Other types of dclay mechanisms may be constructed where a
liquid is allowed to drop through a small hole into a lower con-
“tainer having a reactive.substance attached part way-up one wall,
’ The liquid level in the chamber gradually raises until it comes
in contact with the reactive substance which is the igniter. One
suitable combination is sulfuric acid for the liquid and a mixture
of potassium chlorate and sugar for the solid. Another suitable
combination is plain water for the liquid and metallic sodium for
the solid, There are many other combinations which’: .a chemist might
. : ‘ improvise from materials at hand.

‘There are some explosives so sensitive that they can be used
. as trigger mechanisms. Acmonium tri-iodide can be made from
- - ‘! ordinary household ammonia and iodine crystals. If the iodine
erystals are not available they can be obtained by evaporating
sufficient volume of tincture of iodine in a flat glass dish.

Place two or three teaspoons of iodine crystals in a piece
of kleenex and wet thoroughly with strong ammonia solution. A
small amcunt of ammonia may be added from time to time making
| certain that it does not have the chance to dry out. After three
or four tablespoons of ammonia solution have been absorbed and
partly evaporated from the iodine it can be left to dry out. While
wet ammonium tri-iodide is reasonably safe to handle. When dry,
it is so sensitive that it detonates at the slightest touch. It
may be exploded by a person walking on a wooden floor several feet
away or a door being closed in the same building. The amount
described above will produce a violent explosion and should be
treated with extreme caution. Several similar compounds will be i
mentioned in the chapter on explosives. : :

One or two teaspoonsful of mercury fulminate of silver
fulminate mixed (very gently) with ten percent coarse sand can - . iaaal|
be placed in a small packet of paper and attached to the upper
side of an automobile tire with adhesive tape. When the tire rolls
over it the fulminate will explode with sufficient power to destroy
even a husky truck tire. These combinations also are very danger-
ous to handle,

READY MADE BOOBY TRAPS

All national armics are supplied with a variety of
manufactured trigger devices, charges, etc. to be used
specifically as booby trap material. Most firing devices
are threaded on one end with a standing size that allows them to
be used either with prepared charges or with improvised charges
made from mortar or artillery shells. Figure No. 9 shows a
simple firing device attached to a hand grenade.

An antipersonnel mine of French manufacture is shown in
Figure No. 10. The apparatus at the left side is a trigger
mechanism that can be operated by a trip wire. When it is fired
the flash passes through’the “U" tube which propels a 60mm
grenade into the air and at the same time ignites a 1/5 second
delay pellet. The grenade explodes a few feet off the ground
to shower metal fragments over a wide area. Total weight of
mine is 5-1/2 pounds. :

Guerrilla bands have sometimes used artillery shells or
mortar shells in demolition work by placing them'in a large
. pile of wood or other combustible material and building a bond

fire around them until they exploded, For booby traps use, however,

the projectile of an artillery shell is the only part of any
value, Useful sizes include 75mm, 90mm, 105mm, and 155mm. In

those artillery shells where the prjectile is attached to the case,
it is generally best to remove the projectile and discard the case,

Artillery shell projectiles may be fused either in the nose or
in the base. For most efficient use, the regular fuse must be
unscrewed and a standard firing device (M10 Universal destructor)
put in its place.

IMPROVISED BOOBY TRAPS

Standard hand grenades can be used alone in booby traps
in a number cf methods. The simplest is to carefully remove
the handle and wedge the grenade between two heavy objects
strong enough to hold the spring in the cocked position.
Another trick is to cover a hand grenade with wet mud with
just the safety pin ring sticking out. After the mud has har
. dt will hold the handle in place and the safety pin ring can be

dened,

withdrawn. These harmless looking clumps of mud scattered along _...

a dirt road will,.of course, break open when hit by an automobile

tire which will release the handle and fire the grenade, A similar

trick is to place grenades in glass jars tight enough to held the. ,

handle in place when the safety pins are withdrawn. At nivht these. 7

may be strung on a wire across a road and may not be seen by a
car traveling at night ‘with its lights off. When the bottles
break the grenade handles are released and they soon explode.

type antifreeze)’ equal to 1/4 their content of ethyl alcohol i
without detection. A total intake of 2 or 3 ounces will cause cf
blindness or death in a few hours. Soft drinks can be easily H
poisoned with ethylene glycol (permanent type antifreeze) at H
the rate of 2 ounces per bottle. This dose is usually fatal 7 by

* When five parts of potassium permanganate is mixed with
‘one part of pawdered sugar it’ forms a combination that will
either explode’ {if confined) or burn with a flash if ignited in
the open. A new idea might be to put three or four tablespoonsful
of this material in an ash tray covered with a thin dust of cig-
“aretve ashes. The first person to put his cigarette out in that
“particular ash tray would be burned bad enough to be out of
commission for quite some time. Black powder, if available, would
actually explode if used in this way. 7 |

USE OF BOOBY TRAPS

It is obvious that the use of booby traps favors an army in
retreat, and one of their greatest uses is to slow down pursuit.
For most efficient use the laying of booby traps must be done in
@ planned and coordinated method. When time permits the entire “tf
area to be booby trapped should be reconnoitered and the placement
of available material planned in such a way as to confuse the enemy,
impede his progress and cause maximum number of casualties, '

Generally speaking a large number of small booby traps are
preferred to a few large ones. Two or more triggers may be ,
avtached to a single charge. Variety of types and settings is i
essential to effective use of booby traps in iarge numbers,

In the event that friendly troops or your own personnel
may re-enter such an area later on, it is desirable that a written i
. xecord and detailed maps be kept as to where boopy traps are
placed. When U.S. Army troops discover a place that is booby
, trapped they mark it with a sign which consists of a red triangle

booby traps painte@@#n white across the top.

When anti-vehicle mines are placed by regular army forces
it is common practice to booby trap the mines so they will ex-
plode when being removed by personnel attempting to cléar the
area, :

The use of booby traps is very adaptable to bech guerrilla
and counter-guerrilla activity. Guerrilla warfare involves two
basic types of action: ambushes and raids. When the guerrillas
ambush regular army forces, they are the ones that will make use
of the booby traps. In raiding an enemy garrison or supply depot
they must beware of booby traps that the regular forees have
placed to protect their fixed positions.

The ambush may start when the leading vehicle of an enemy
column strikes a mine or drives on to a bridge which is dynamited.
Perhaps time delay booby traps activated by the first vehicle in’
the column may be used to destroy other vehicles several positions
behind. Troops riding in a truck convoy may be expected to seek’ *
cover in ditches beside the road or other points of natural pro-+
tection, If these ditches have been booby trapped beforehand, they
will be killed in the very process of seeking shelter.

Before making any raid on a fixed enemy position, guerrilla
forces should carefully consider the potential danger of booby
traps. When regular army forces are being harrassed by guerrillas
they may be expected to leave supplies badly needed by the guerrillas
in slightly protected warehouses as traps. These supplies may be
heavily booby trapped and counter guerrilla forces may be waiting
a short distance away to take pursuit. To guard against these ©
things, the guerrilla should attempt to keep their target under
surveillance for several hours or days before making the raid,

They should observe the coming and going of enemy personnel, If
the enemy is very careful to always come and go by the same route
it may mean that other routes are booby trapped. If the supplies
are not added to or taken from regularly, this may indicate that
they are being used to bait a trap. By scouting the general aréa
guerrilla forces shou 1d guard against surprise by other enemy
forces waiting within danger distance.

After making either a raid or an ambush, guerrilla forces
should place booby traps behind them to slow up pursuit. Real
booby traps can be interspersed with imitation traps. To be
safe the enemy will have to go around or de-activate the imitations
and take just as much time doing so as if they were real. If the
enemy becomes carelcss in handling your imitation traps, he will

Ford automobile.

A complete check of the records failed to locate
anyone by the name of BARRY from San Diego; STAN from i
San Diego or a "SI" from Seattle, Washington; an EVERETT from
Phoenix; a HOWARD CLARK from Ramona, California; a JOE BURTON

GENERAL HEADQUARTERS —— JANUARY 1972

"God. grants liberty only to those who love it and are always willing to guard and
defend it". Daniel Webster

Fellow members,

This month's bulletin will deal mostly with "Booby Traps". Because of the
length of this article we are only sending out the first half this month. The second
half will be published in next mouth's bulletin. Future bulletins this coming year
will contain material on psychological warfare, urban warfare tactics, communi-
cations, survival equipment, first aid, explosives, weapons, codes, and other re-
lated warfare subjects.

‘Those members who have not yet completed or started on the organization's
basic training programs are hereby urged to do so. We cannct, in most cases,
assign any member to an imp. undergrsuud project or to an organized team
or group until they have completed this training program.

While headquarters cannot assign a member in the above classification to
an established unit, any member can (and is encouraged to) recruit and forra their
own combat team (see December 1971 Bulletin). In many cases this may be the
best policy in regards to personal security as the member would be working with
the people he personally knows and trusts. If any member would like to form their
own unit they should write to their assigned mail drop and the organization will send.
them further instructions along with a Team Recruiting Packet. The article on
‘The Dispersed Team" in this month's bulletin should help those members who
wish to form their own Combat Team.

We are enclosing a small number of S.A. O. stickers with this month's
bulletin. Please put them in your shirt pocket or billfoid and as scon as possible
stick {hem up in phone booths, at bus stops, or cther public places that you visit.
‘The stickers are already gummed and when wet wili adhere firmly to glass, metal,
or any other smooth surface. If our members would use these stickers along with
the leaflets thal are availuble, it would have a real psychological impact on the
rest of the American people and give them evidence that there are still those among
them who are willing to fight for the re-establishment of a Constitutional Republic.
These first stickers are being sent lo cuch member free, additional stickers and
leaflets can be ordered on the monthly report form. 4, /

HE DISPERSED T

When discussing a Secret Army Organization "Combat Team", we usually think
of a small group of people who live very close to one another. Such an arrangement
has certain advantages, such as ease of communication and travel for collective
training and team operations, but there are also several disadvantages.

Among the disadvantages are these: Team members may be well acquainted
with only a small geographical area. If forced to leave this area the team may be
placed at a serious disadvantage. It is harder for a team of SAQ members who
live closely together to keep from attracting attention, thus unit security may be
poor. If one y ember of the team is ever discovered and arrested. by the enemy,
chances are that all members cf the team will be rounded up together.

These considerations have caused us to;experiment with a new arrangement that
we refer to as a "Dispersed Team". Such a team has the same number of members
(usually six) as a regular Combat Team. Each team is split into two sections as is
the old team. The members have the same type of individual specialties and duties.

The big difference lies in the fact that the team members may be located over ~
a comparatively larger area - perhaps as much as 25 to 50 miles in diameter. In
urban. areas one team.member may live in each of six different cities. Thus the
team may range over a fairly large geographical area with at least one team member
being familiar with the immediate territory through which they are traveling.

When active as part of an underground movement (as opposed to the classical
forms of guerrilla warfare) the Dispersed Team has several other. advantages ae
For example, if one member of the team gets too "hot" in his area; he automatically
has five other hide-outs to which he can go for assistance or to which he can send
his family for temporary safety. The Dispersed Team can conveniently cover a
larger area in the fields of recruiting, psychological warfare, and propaganda.
Operations of saboiage, surveillance and harassment of communist personnel,
raids, and other combat type operations can be successfully conducted while moving
aminimum of people over a minimum distance.

During the present period of deliberate delay the activities of the team will
naturally be different from some future period in which all out warfare between our
organization and our country's communist enemies develops.

If the team is to achieve its ultimate objectives the following activities must
be provided for: (1) organization of and within the team, (2) communications between
the team and higher command, {3) maintaining secrecy of team members, (4) main-
taining a continuous and effective propaganda effort, (5) obtaining the necessary sup-
plies and equipment for present and future needs, (6) training of the team in general,
and of individual members in their own specialties.

When the required personnel are not available to form a full team, a three
maa‘section should be formed. When additional people are recruited the unit can
then be expanded in an orderly fashion.

BOOBY TRAPS

Exoadly defined a boohy trap can be any kind of apparatus
fn which a reaction unfavorable to the enemy is brought about
when he unintentionally makes some act which triggers the re=
action. The most common types of booby traps used in warfare
involve an explosive charge which is set off by movement of a
trip wire or the moving of some object which is connected to
the trigger mechanism. 7

On sccasion the explosive charge may be replaced by
signsl flares, gas, smoke or other chemical agents, The trigger
mechanism may be either electric, mechanical, thermal or chemical.

ELECTRICALLY OPERATED TRIGGERS, Such trigger mechanisus
are very easily arranged wherever a supply of electric blasting
caps ate available and also a suitable source of electricity.
One of the most common electric type booby traps is to simply
interrupt the electrical circuit in ‘some building so that ‘when
the lights are turned on the explosive is detonated. This
simple procedure applied to an automobile with a few sticks of
dynamite has marked the end of more than one gangland hoodlum
To booby trap a car in this manner one side of the electric
blasting cap can be attached to any metal part of the car while
the other side is attached to a spark plug or the “cold side”
of the ignition switch. In the first case the cap detonates the
dynamite when the starter motor is turned over or if attached to
the key switch detonating occurs when the ignition is turned on,

Any movable object can be booby trapped so that when it
ig moved some simple type electrical switch cuntact is closed
to complete a circuit between a dry cell battery and the deo
tonetor. A very simple example would be to have one wire tacked
along the edge of a door and the other wire tacked to the frame
and extending out far enough that contact is made between the
two when the door is opened. A slightly more refined trigger
involves two small springs separated by some thin piece of ine
sulation at ome end as shown in Figure No. 1, When pressure
is applied, the springs are held apart and when the pressure
is released, the springs come together to inake electrical con-
tact. This may be placed in a door which is then closed to open
the awitch while the explosive is wired into the circuit. When
the door is opened pressure is released and the charge explodes.

This simple triggor can be placed under the leg of a chair,
a wooden box or any other movable object of sufficient weight.
Xf the chatr is moved or tiie bex Lifted the release of pressure
. will close the electrical circuit.

A person skilled in the placement of booby traps will not
-leave any part of the switch, wires or charge visible. Instead of

connecting the wires to the door itself. he will take off the decor
frame, place the trigger mechanism at the edge of the docr and

then replace the frame so that the entire mechanism is hidden whea
the door is closed.

By taking off the frame of a window and drilling a hole
out through the window casing the trigger mechanism can‘ be placed
so that the charge will be detonated by either raising or lowering
a half open window. .

A simple time delay mechanism can be arranged. by placing
one of these triggers under a glass jar filled with water. When
enough of the water evaporates, the weight of the jar will no
longer be sufficient to hold the contacts open,

Figure No. ‘2 shows another simple electrical trigger made
from a spring clothes pin. The improvised contacts are held
apart by a small wooden wedge in the jaws of the clothes pin.
This wedge can be attached to a trip wire or other movable object.
When it is withdrawn the clothes pin shuts and the electric cir-
cuit is completed,

A trigger of this type can be used to make a time delay
mechanism in many different ways. The wedge may be connected by
a loose cord to the end of a spring which is also attached to a
fin can, Above this a second tin can fuli of sand or water is
placed with a hole in the bottom so that the contents gradually
fall through into the second can, When the weight of the lower
can becomes enough to stretch the spring sufficiently the wedge
will be pulied from the clothes pin. As an aiternate method the
spring may be already stretched out and held there by a second
cord attached to some other solid object. :The cord holding the
spring could be placed through a candle so that it will be burned
in two when the candle burned down a certain distance. An active
imagination can devise countless ways for activating this type
of trigger either by instant action or delayed action.

A clever derivative of this simple trigger is used in the
“British book trap", In this case a book is hollowed out to
contain a small battery and a quarter pound block of TNT which
is detonated by an electrical blasting cap. The circuit passes
through two contacts attached to opposite pages of the book but
are held apart by some insulating material which is attached to
the back of the bookcase, If the book is withdrawn from the case
the contacts come together and the INT is detonated.

A British ball bearing contact switch is shown in Figere No.
3, This type of contact is very useful in placing charges entirely
within a movable object. For example, a suitcase could be laid
on its side with the contact positioned inside in such a way that
when the suitcase was picked up the ball bearing would roll forward
+ and complete the contact. Similar electrically activated booby

traps could be placed in closed gasoline cans, canteens, ammuni~
tion boxes or dozens of other objects which an enemy would place
right side up before opening. A plastic or glass test tube

could be used instead of a metal case by sticking two wires through
i the cork in such a manner that the ball bearing would come in

: contact with both of them.

A surprisingly accurate timing device can be made with a
tube of this type. Holding the tube with the open end up, first
pour in a quantity of dried peas, then a measured amount of
water, drop in the ball bearing (in this case a wad of tin foil
could be used as well), finally put the cork in the top with the
| wire sticking down through. The water will cause the dried peas
' to swell which will push the ball bearing (or wad of tin foil)

j- up until it makes contact with the two wires to complete the
circuit. The time can be regulated from a few minutes to several
hours depending on the length of the tube, the amount of water, and
the quantity of peas used.

Far more sophisticated types of electrical triggers are manu-
factured some of which operate by photoelectric cell or even more
difficult to recognize mechanisms. These may be used to safeguard
record centers, important military or missile bases, etc. but are
seldom encountered under battlefield conditions.

MECHANICAL TRIGGERS. These may be operated either by impact
or by friction, The ordinary hand grenade employs an impact
trigger. When the handle is released a spring operated lever snaps ”
against a cap (similar to the priming cap in a shotgun shell)
which in turn starts a short fuse to burn, This fuse leads to a
: blasting cap centered in an explosive charge.

The trigger mechanism of a "potato masher" hand grenade
operates much like the firing pin of a bolt action rifle. In
this case a spring activaced plunger strikes a detonator. The
plunger may be released by pulling out a pin as shown in Figure
No. 4, by cutting a wire as shown in Figure No. 5 or by applying

_pressure to a slotted key as shown in Figure No. 6.

Explosion of the primer cap alone is not sufficient. to

tonate most military explosives. Generally a booster charge oft7~
fairiy sensitive explosive is detonated by the primer and this i+
turn detonates the main charge. In military use INT is by far Lhe
most common explosive used in the main charge of bocby traps.
So called "plastic explosive" or "Composition C-3" contains +3 °°
percent RDX and 22% plasticizer made up of mixture of dinitrotolun;
TNT, nitrocellulose and dimethylformamide. RDX is cyclotrimethy~ ot
lenetrinitramine which is manufactured by nitrating hexamethvlena
tetramine (which is obtained by the reaction of formaldehyde and -
ammonia) .

Booster charges where necessary are usually tetryl or PEIN,
Common explosives used in primers are lead azide, lead styphnate

or the now largely discontinued mercury fulminate. Characteris~
tics, uses and manufacture of explosives will be dealt with in

‘another chapter.

A very simple device can be made from a screen door spring
that will explode an ordinary rifle cartridge when activated by a
trip wire. Although the "explosion" is almost harmless it can be
very nerve racking to an approaching enemy.

A more deadly booby trap consists of a short piece of pipe
which is driven into the ground. A plunger type trigger mechaaism
is dropped into the pipe and an ordinary rifle cartridge placed
point up in the pipe so that perhaps one-half inch is exposed
above the ground, The weight of a man stepping on the bullet
releases the trigger and fires the cartridge which will penetrate ..
well up into the leg or the body.

Some mechanical triggers are activated by friction just
like striking a match on the rough material of the match cover.
Figure No. 7 shows a cut-away drawing of the U.S. Army firing ~ =
device, pull friction type M-2. The coated wire is covered with
a gritty substance much like the strip on a book of matches,
When this is pulled out through a container of flash compound
(chemically similar to the match hedds) the friction ignites the
flash compound which may be used either to light a fuse ox fire
a blasting cap.

A crude but effective friction device can be prepared by
sticking the end of a fuse in some small cylinder filled with
match heads through which is placed a small strip of tin or heavy
cardboard with a friction strip from match books glued to both
sides.

In field use the friction type ignitor can be hidden in
many ways connected with trip wires or attached to movable objects
to set off either instant or delayed charges.

THERMAL IGNITORS, In some cases the ignitor, (fuse or primer) **
can be used as a trigger mechanism. For example in World War IL.
the Germans were known to tear down fireplaces and cement ¢! ar’
back together with hidden charges that would ignite when a fire ~
was built, A simple hand grenade or mortar shell hidden in a
hollow log by 2 burned out fire would, of course, explode if the
log were used as fuel without being inspected.

A common trick is for a retreating army to leave behind coal
oil lamps or lanterns filled with gasoline. An unthinking person
who touches a match to such a lantern will nearly always be burned
to death. :

CREMICAL TRIGGERS. These are more frequently used in the
construction of time bombs than in booby traps. Figure No. 8

shows an Italian chemical delay igniter. i

The upper chamber
contains acetone. When the piercing pln is pushed downward it
penetrates the lead disc and allows the acetone to flow into the
lower chamber, The acetone gradually dissolves the celluloid
washer which holds back the striker. The time delay can be varied

by placing different numbers of cellophane washers on the striker
rod.

In several similar types of delayed mechanisms the striker
is held back by a thin metal wire which is gradually dissolved
when a solution of acid is allowed to surround .it.

Other types of delay mechanisms may be constructed where a
liquid is allowed to drop through a small hole into a lower con-
tainer having a reactive substance attached part way up one wall.
The liquid level in the chamber gradually raises until it comes
in contact with the reactive substance which is the igniter. One
suitable combination is sulfuric acid for the liquid and a mixture
of potassium chlorate and sugar for the solid. Another suitable
combination is plain water for the liquid and metallic sodium for
the solid, There are many other combinations which a chemist might
improvise from materials at hand.

There are some explosives so sensitive that they can be used
as trigger mechanisms. Ammonium tri-iodide can be made from
ordinary household ammonia and iodine crystals. If the iodine
erystals are not available they can be obtained by evaporating
sufficient volume of tincture of iodine in a flat glass dish.

Place two or three teaspoons of iodine crystals in a piece
of kleenex and wet thoroughly with strong ammonia solution, A
small amcunt of ammonia may be added from time to time making
certain that -it does not have the chanée to dry out. After three
or four tablespoons of ammonia solution have been absorbed and
partly evaporated from the iodine it can be left to dry out. While
wet ammonium tri-iodide is reasonably safe to handle. When dry,
it is so sensitive that it detonates at the slightest touch. It
may be exploded by a person walking on a wooden fioor several feet
away or a door being closed in the same building. ‘The amount
described above will produce a violent explosion and should be
treated with extreme caution. Several similar compounds will be
mentioned in the chapter on explosives.

One or two teaspoonsful of mercury fulminate of silver
fulminate mixed (very gently) with ten percent coarse sand can
be placed in a small packet of paper and attached to the upper
side of an automobile tire with adhesive tape. When the tire rolls
over it the fulminate will explode with sufficient power to destroy

even a husky truck tire, These combinations also are very danger-
ous to handle.

READY MADE BOOBY TRAPS

All national armics are supplied with a variety of
manufactured trigger devices, charges, ete. to be used
specifically as booby trap material. Most firing devices |
are threaded on one end with a standing size that allows them to |

{

be used either with prepared charges or with improvised charges
made from mortar or artillery shells. Figure No. 9 shows a
simple firing device attached to a hand grenade.

An antipersonnel mine of French manufacture is shown in
Figure No. 10, The apparatus at the left side is a trigger
mechanism that can be operated by a trip wire. When it is fired

on

the flash passes through the “U' tube which propels a 60mm 4
grenade into the air and at the same time ignites a 1/5 second #

delay pellet. The grenade explodes a few feet off the ground
to shower metal fragments over a wide area, Total weight of
mine is 5-1/2 pounds, :

Guerrilla bands have sometimes used artillery shells or
mortar shells in demolition work by placing them in a large
pile of wood or other combustible material and building a bond
fire around them until they exploded. For booby traps use, however,
the projectile of an artillery shell is the only part of any
value. Useful sizes include 75mm, 90mm, 105mm, and 155mm. In _
those artillery shells where the prjectile is attached to the case,
it is generally best to remove the projectile and discard the case.
Artillery shell projectiles may be fused either in the nose or
in the base. For most efficient use, the regular fuse must be
unscrewed and a standard firing device (M10 Universal destructor)

Standard hand grenades can be used alone in booby traps
in a number ef methods. The simplest is to carefully remove
the handle and wedge the grenade between two heavy objects
strong enough to hold the spring in the cocked position.

Another trick is to cover a hand grenade with wet mud with
just the safety pin ring sticking out. After the mud has hardened,
it will hold the handle in place and the safety pin ring can be
withdrawn. These harmless looking clumps of mud scattered along
a dirt road will, of course, break open when hit by an automobile
tire which will release the handle and fire the grenade. A similar
trick is to place grenades in glass jars tight enough to hold the
handle in place when the safety pins are withdrawn, At night these
may be strung on a wire across a road and may not be seen by a
ear traveling at night with its lights off. When the bottles
break the grenade handles are released and they soon explode.

It seems doubtful that man's ingenuity will ever be
exhausted when it comes to improvising traps of various types.
A rusty nail stuck to a board left where it will be stepped
on by a running enemy may be just as deadly to that one indivi-
dual as an atomic bomb. Open pits (sometimes with sharp stakes
ai the bottom) covered with flimsy camouflage is much older than
the bow and arrow, but were still used by the Japanese’ in World
War IL.

"Dead falls" made from heavy tree limbs that fall when a
victim releases them by tripping over a jungle vine can still
be useful in guerrilla warfare,

Leaving behind poisoned food or bottled drinks is common.
Alcoholic dzinks are easily diluted with wood alcohol (temporary
type antifreeze)’ equal to 1/4 their content of ethyl alcohol
without detection. A total intake of 2 or 3 ounces will cause
blindness or death in a few hours. Soft drinks can be easily
poisoned with ethylene glycol (permanent type antifreeze) at
the rate of 2 ounces per bottle, This dose is usually fatal
and once symptoms develop there is no known antidote,

’ When five parts of potassium permanganate is mixed with

one part of powdered sugar it forms a combination that will

either explode (if confined) or burn with a flash if ignited in
the open. 4 new idea might be to put three or four tablespoonsful
of this material in an ash tray covered with a thin dust of cig-
‘aretre ashes. The first person to put his cigarette out in that
particular ash tray would be burned bad enough to be out of
commission for quite some time. Black powder, if available, would
actuaily explode if used in this way. :

USE OF BOOBY TRAPS

It is obvious that the use of booby traps favors an army_-in
retreat, and one of their greatest uses is to slow down pursuit,
For most efficient use the laying of booby traps rust be done in
a planned and ceordinated method. When time permits the entire
area to be booby trapped should be reconnoitered and the placement
of available meterial planned in such a way as to confuse the enemy,
impede his progress and cause maximum number of casualties,

Generally speaking a large number of small booby traps are
preferred to a few large ones. Two or more triggers may be
attached to a single charge. Variety of types and settings is
essential to effective use of booby traps in large numbers.

7 In the event that friendly troops or your own personnel
may re-enter such an area later on, it is desirable that a written
record and detailed maps be kept as to where boopy traps are
placed. When U.S. Army troops discover a place that is booby
trapped they mark it with a sign which consists of a red triangle

“7

NW 68262 Docld:32989569 Page 264 ~~ “ Peet eee eee +e



pointed downward with a white circle in the middle and the word .
booby traps painted in white across the top.

When anti-vehicle mines are placed by regular army forces
it is common practice to booby trup the mines so they will ex-
plode when being removed by personnel attempting to cléar the
area,

The use of booby traps is very adaptable to bech guerrilla
and counter-guerrilla activity. Guerrilla warfare involves two
basic types of action: ambushes and raids. When the guerrillas
ambush regular army forces, they are the ones that will make use
of the booby traps. Jn raiding an enemy garrison or supply depot
they must beware of booby traps that the regular forces have
placed to protect their fixed positions,

The ambush may start when the Leading vehicle of an enemy
column strikes a mine or drives on to a bridge which is dynamited.
Perhaps time delay booby traps activated by the first vehicle in
the column may be used to destroy other vehicles several positions
behind. Troops riding in a truck convoy may be: expdéted to seek
cover in ditches beside the road or other points of natural pro-
tection. If these ditches have been booby trapped beforehand, they
will be killed in the very process of seeking shelter.

Before making any raid on a fixed enemy position, guerrilla
forces should carefully consider the potential danger of booby
traps. When regular army forces are being harrassed by guerrillas
they may be expected to leave supplies badly needed by the guerrillas
in slightly protected warehouses as traps. These supplies may be
heavily booby trapped and counter guerrilla forces may be waiting
a short distance away to take pursuit. To guard against these
things, the guerrilla should attempt to keep their rget under
surveillance for several hours or days before ‘making. the raid.
They should observe the coming and going of enemy personnel. If
the enemy is very careful to always. come and go by the same route
it may mean that other routes are booby trapped. If the supplies
are not added to or taken from regularly, this may indicate that
they are being used to bait a trap. By scouting the general area
guerrilla forces shou ld guard against surprise by other enemy
forces waiting within danger distance.

After making either a raid or an ambush, guerrilla forces
should place booby traps behind them to slow up pursuit. Real
booby traps can be interspersed with imitation traps. To be
safe the enemy will have to go around or de-activate the imitations
and take just as much time doing so as if they were real, If the
enemy becomes cacelcss in handling your imitation traps, he will
run the danger of getting killed by a live onc. In planning the
path of their retreat guerrilla forces should booby trap alternate
routes which enemy forces might use to cut them off.
