Director Woolsey:

We are writing to express our sincere appreciation and recognition of the

excellent support that has been provided to the Senate Select Committee on

Intelligence by a member of your agency.

From October 1993 through August 1994, Mr. John Carver has assisted

Committee staff in the review process required for release of the John F.

Kennedy Records Collection. The project involved reading and evaluating

thousands of classified records that were in the possession of this Committee,

and approving them for release pursuant to Public Law 102-526.

Given the volume of documents stored at the Select Committee, this

was a tremendous administrative task. Mr. Carver's expertise,

professionalism, and personal attention to detail were a significant

contribution to our Committee being able to successfully complete this

important task.

Mr. Carver is clearly a credit to your organization and we appreciate his

hard work and superior performance on behalf of our Committee.

Please extend our personal thanks to Mr. Carver.
