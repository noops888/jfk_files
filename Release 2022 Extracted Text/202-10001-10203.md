SUBJECT: Tasks Assigned to CIA in General Lansdale's Program
Review
A. TASKS

Part V, pp. 5-8, of General Lansdale's program review of
the Cuba Project, dated 18 January 1962, assigns 32 specific tasks
to elements of the U.S. Government. Of these, 16 are assigned
to CIA solely or jointly. The tasks have been reviewed by this
Agency, and it has been determined that substantially all reporting
and planning deadlines can be met. Work on all tasks, with and °
without assigned dates for completion, is in progress. The
following detailed observations are keyed to General Lansdale's
paper.

l. Task il, p.5. The intelligence community is hard at
work on NIE 85-62 and is attempting to meet the deadline of
7 February. As was agreed ina conversation of 22 January 1962
with General Lansdale, a short extension may be necessary

2. Task 2, p.5. The Cpa-Locka Interrogation Center in

-_

gration on 15 February -- the dead

Florida will be in date.

3... Task 3. p.5 The survey in progress and will be

completed on the stipulated date. On the basis of the information

obtained the possibility of establishixg additional interrogation
points will be determined.
4. Task 4, p.5. An operational assessment of the stay-

behind net in Cuba will be completed and reported by the deadline

of 15 February. Because communication with singleton agents is
by sw, not W/T, it is unlikely that assessment can be completed

by the date stipulated; an extension to 28 February may be

necessary, altho every effort is being made to complete the work

before that dat An intensive program aimed at the acquisition

of third countrfassets through the cooperation of

is also under way, partic rly in|

IA progress report on the status of

this program will be ildde’by 15 February, although this Agency
cannot be sure that the cooperation of all intended participants will
have been obtained by that date. CIA has also taken the follow-

ing additional steps in respect to Task 4.
a. A cable has been sent to field stations to give added

impetus to the search for assets and the development of both

unilateral and joint operations. Progress reports have been

February.

c. An assessment of more than one hundred Persons to
determine their suitability for return to Cuba as agent{in

the guise of srudeniah also being conducted. Target date:

end of February.

S. Task 5, p.5. Thel February deadline will be met, and
by that date we shall also have begun the search for suitable inter-
mediaries. Analysis to date has not uncovered a top-level official
of the Cuban regime whose personal characteristics indicate he
would accept recruitment or agree to defection now, Although
some targets of opportunity will appear outside Cuba, most planning
will necessarily be based upon an appeal made inside the island by
intermediaries selected from the ranks offournalists, foreign
officials, international businessmen, foreign lawyers, crime
syndicates, international detectives and foreign police officials |
Additionally, plans for the defection of lower-level Cuban officials
abroad have been completed, and the search for targets and access

abroad is under way]

6. Task 6, p.5. By the assigned date we shall complete

and submit a coordinated plan. We shali also have begun action on
