1. Mr. Cregar, FBI, on 4 December 1963 confirmed that the Subject
is the daughter of William Avery HYDE, SSD-157435. Cregar was furnished
a copy.of two 1957 investigative reports on William HYDE for lead purposes
only and was informed thet William HYDE was under consideration for a
covert use by this Agency in Viet Nem in 1957 but was not used. (This
information had previously been obtained from(@scar Sells, ct/sic).

2. Subject is the individual who is taking care of the widow of
Lee Harvey Oswald and has apparently been quite well know to the widow
of Lee Harvey Oswald and possibly Lee Harvey Oswald for an undetermined
period of time. The possibility that William Avery HYDE was the father
of Ruth PAINE was previously brought to the attention of Mr. Papich
through Mr. O'Neal, ct/si¢. The Security File of William HYDE contains
a copy of a 1956 FBI Investigative Report (SECURITY OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES)
on Sylvia Ludlow HOKE, aka: Mrs. John L. HOKE, nee: Sylvie Ludlow HYDE, who
is the sister of Ruth PAINE. The file of William HYDE also contains 211956
OSI report on Sylvia HOKE. .

3. In addition to the above, it was previously know that William
‘Avery HYDE and wife Carol HYDE were associates in the late 1920's and
later of Talbot BIELEFELT, #29931, who is currently employed by this
Agency in FDD. A certain amount of information concerning William HYDE,
Carol HYDE, and other associates of HYDE and BIELEFEUT during the latter
1920's was furnished by Talbot BIELEFELT during interviews several years
ago. At that time the BIELEFELT Case was under extensive investigation.
