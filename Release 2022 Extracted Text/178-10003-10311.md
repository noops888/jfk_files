CIA "HISTORIES"; BREAKDOWN OF CERTAIN
ITEMS REQUESTED AND ITEMS NOT REQUESTED

Note: This analysis excludes histories of a purely internal, or-

» ganizational or administrative nature (such as "CIA Recruitment,
1947-71") and histories of other matters covering essentially the entire
period of the CIA {such as "Major Policy Authorization for the Conduct
of Covert Paramilitary Activities by CLA, 1948-1966."') Ir focuses in-
stead on activities or operations -- particularly specific covert or
clandestine actions ~- and similar matters which are within the Senate
Select Committee's stated area of interest and generally attributed to
one particular Presidential Administration. .
