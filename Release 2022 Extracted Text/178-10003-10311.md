CIA "HISTORIES": BREAKDOWN OF CERTAIN

ITEMS REQUESTED AND ITEMS NOT REQUESTED

178-10003-10311

Note: This analysis excludes histories of a purely internal, or-

• ganizational or administrative nature (such as "CIA Recruitment,

1947-71") and histories of other matters covering essentially the entire

of Covert Paramilitary Activities by CIA, 1948-1966.") It focuses in-

stead on activities or operations -- particularly specific covert or

clandestine actions - and similar matters which are within the Senate

Select Committee's stated area of interest and generally attributed to

one particular Presidential Administration.
