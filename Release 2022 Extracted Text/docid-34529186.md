AGENT'S NOTES: Attention is invited to Court Order in the Spanish lan-
guage, dated 12 February 1963, by which SUBJECT'S father legally changed his name
to Manuel Marti, (EXHIBIT ), which was subsequently translated into the
English language (EXHIBIT ). Attention is further invited to the discre-
pancy between the spelling Of SUBJECT'S father's surname on the Court Order and
on the Certificate of Birth Registration. Source advised that the spelling Martir
was a typographical error, and that the surname would be changed to read Marti.
Attention is further invited to tle fact that the term natural child is a term
used in Puerto Rico, when a child's birth is registered at the Bureau of Demo-
graphic Registry by someone other than the parents of the child. The child tekes
the name of the mother and the father's name does not appear on the record, in-
asmuch as the parents are not married to each other.
