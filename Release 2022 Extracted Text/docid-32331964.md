SAMUEL MANNARINO, FBI $115840

The following investigation was conducted in an

effort to obtain a recent photograph of national top hoodlum,

SAMUEL MANNARINO,

Hotel in Miami Beach, Florida, under the allas SAu MANN,

during the te

1.e. 10/24/58 - 11/7/58.

A recent photograph is also needed

in connection with investigation at the warwick and St. Moritz

Hotels, New York, New York.

On 4/30/59 SA RICHARD GORDON DOICE contacted NORMAN

GREENBERG, crime reporter for the "pittsburgh Post Gazette,"

JAMES ROGERS, crime reporter for the "Pittsburgh press," and

LESTER SULLIVAN, crime reporter for the "pittsburgh sun

Telegraph," with the request that they make a thorough search

of their respective newspaper morgues in an effort to locate

a photograph of MANNARINo.

The reporters pointed out that for

a number of years they have been interested in obtaining a

photograph of MANNARINO, but to the best of their knowledge

no photographs of him exist. Each reporter promisted to

recheck his respective newspaper morgue but when recontacted on

5/4/59 all stated that they were unable to locate a photograph

of MANNARINO.

It is recalled that on 1/26/59 USA HUBERT I, TEITELBAUM,

WILLIAM AHISTROM, news editor, New Kensington, Pa.,

"Daily Dispatch" newspaper, on 6,4/59 advised SA FRANK E. ALLISON,

that for the past 20 years he has made every possible effort

to obtain a photograph of MANNARINO for publication in connection

with racket articles to no avail. AHLSTROM stated that he has

requested MANNARINO to give him a photograph on many occasions

and has been refused every time. AHLSTROM pointed out that he

has been very reluctant to take MANNARINd's photograph

surreptitiously since MANNARINO would undoubtedly file suit

against him and might even subject him to physical violence.

In conclusion, AHLSTROM expressed the opinion that there 1s

no photograph of SAMUEL MANNARINO in existence.

The following investigation was conducted by

SAS RICHARL GORDON DOUCE and ROBERT G. ABEGGLEN to establish

a photographic surveillance on the second floor of the

Central Drug Company, Executive Office, which overlooks the

Ken Iron and Steel Company In New Kensington, owned and

operated by MANNARINe.

Before making contact with the Central

Drug Company, SAS DOUCE and ABEGGLEN observed that the corner

office on the second floor would provide an excellent view

of an area often frequented by MANNARINo and that

since the inception of the

Dop Hoodlum Program serious

difficulty has been experienced in obtaining MANNARINO'S

photograph because he never appears in public without dark

glasses.

Central Drug Company Location was considered

Ideal since on 5/29/59 SAS DOUCE and ABEOGLEN observed

MANNARINO standing in front of his office without sunglasses.

Executive

WILLIS

Vice president, Central Drug Company,

Orfaces,

1263 - 320 Arenue, New Kensington, on

5/29/59 was contacted concerning the

FBI's interest in obtaining

a photograph or MANNARINO.

Without aisclosing any details

of the investigation, mus was told that MANARINd was the subject

of an important criminal investigation and that the FBI would

greatly appreciate using a second floor office as a vantage

point to obtain nis photograph.

HUG stated that in the

Interest of good citizenshio and because of his disgust over

the corruptive influence present In New Kensington due to

MANNARINO control of the community he would be glad to

make the space avallable with the approval of A. E. BLEIER,

President of Central Drug Company.

Mr.

HUG

suggested

that the agents walt for Mr. BLEIER's

retuon since be was expected in the office within the hour.

When Mr. BLETER arrived, Mr. HUG did not explain the purpose

of the visit and SAS DOUCE and ABEGGLEN were introduced to

MY. BLETER and accompanied him to his office on the second floor

which was the ideal location to take photographs.

It should be noted that when SAS DOUCE and ABEGGLEN

entered the Central Drug Company they did not identify themselves

to the receptionist

on duty but merely asked to speak to Mr.

Since the agents were carrying briefcases containing

cameras and were required to wait a short time before seeing

Mr. HuG in a room occupied by drug salesmen also carrying

briefcases,

there was absolutely no grounds for the receptionist

to assume that the callers were Special Agents of the FBI.

This form of approach was taken to afford the utmost precaution

and protection to the Central Drug executive contact since 1t

was felt that no one in the company except one or possibly two

executives, should know of the agents desires.

Me. BLEIER appeared to be genuinely pleased to

see the interviewing agents and before the purpose of the

visit was explained, he outlined at some length his hardships

as a young man who successfully developed a proistable chain

of drug stores servicing several Pennsylvania counties.

He

stated that he was appalled that the racket element in

Kensington held such tight control over the community and

emphasized that over the years he has attempted to dedicate

himself to improving the situation by being of service to

his community.

As an example, BLEIER pointed out that he 1s a

former member of the Lions and somewhat active as a Rotarian.

Mr. BLETER also spoke at some length about his membership

In the local country club and at that point in the interview

asked the agents how he might be of assistance.

Without disclosing any details of the investigation,

Mr. BLEIER waS told that SAMUEL MANNARINO was the subject of

an important criminal investigation being conducted by the

FBI and that he could be of real service by making his office

available as a vantage point from which the agents could

obtain a photograph of MANNARINO. Upon hearing this, Mr.

BLEIER's hands began to shake noticeably and his entire

attitude and expression changed immediately. It seemed

obvious to the interviewing agents that the man was almost

terror stricken at the agents' request when it involved

MANNARINO.

After a few

moments of silence on the part of Mr.

re-gained his composure and began making

excuses to the effect that If his employees ever learned that

photograpns were taken from his office, business might be

subjected to a boycott on the part of the Italian population

in New Kensington. Mr. BLEIER was reminded that it was his

duty as a good citizen to extend cooperation to the FBI in

connection with investigations into violations of Federal

law, and he agreed that it was his clear duty to grant the

agents' permission to take the photographs. He agreed that

a man of his background and position in the community should

be pleased to assist the fBI especialy when such assistance

would be of great value in the possible solution of an

important matter under investigation involving one that

he admittedly recognized as being responsible for the

present corruption in his community. Mr. BLEIER strongly

Implied that he was afraid of MANNARINO and his confederates

and the possible reprisal he might be subjected to if the

photographs were ever made public.

It was explained to Mr. BLEIER that the photographs

would be treated in such a manner that such a situation would

never occur, but he

still declined

He promised, however, to give the

matter some serious thought

and would contact the office if he changed his mind.

Mr. BLEIER was reinterviewed by SAS DOUCE and ABEGGLEN

on 6/1/59 and again refused to give his permission to take

photographs, saying that he had to place duty to his business

above duty to his country.

Mr. WILLIS V. HUG was recontacted on 6/1/59 by

SAS DOUCE and ABEGGIEN at which time he emphasized that he

was greatly disappointed over the decision reached by Mr.

BLETER, but added that since he had no control over this

situation there was nothing at all he cout do.

It is noted that only Mr. BLEIER and Mr. HUG were

aware that agents had contacted the Central Drug Company for

the purpose of obtaining a photograph of MANNARINO.

JACK SCHWARTZ, Special Agent, Intelligence Division,

Internal Revenue Service, Pittsburgh, on 6/5/59, in a telephone

call to SA DOUCE,

It Is noted that even though SCHWARTZ has been

most cooperative in the past in connection with top hoodlum

Investigation in New Kensington, he was not given any

information concerning the plans to photograph MANNARINO from

the Central Drug Company nor was the unsuccessful approach to

the Central Drug Company revealed to him.

It appears logical to assume that BLEIER was in

such fear of reprisal on the part of MANNARINO and his

confederates should it become known that Bureau Agents

attempted to photograph him, that he immediately told

MANNARINO of the Bureau's plans.

This situation is an excellent

example of the obstacles that must be overcome in connection

with any violation within the Bureau's jurisdiction in New

Kensington which is dominated completely by the MANNARINO

gang.

on 5/29/59 SA DOUCE contacted Mr. and Mrs. JAMES C. POST,

established neighborhood sources covering MANNARINO's residence

since the inception of the Top Hoodlum Program.

Without

disclosing details of the investigation Mr. and Mrs. POST were

impressed with the necessity of obtaining a recent photograph

of MANNARINO. Mr. POSt, an executive in the International

DIVision of ALCOA, and his wife, stated that they would be

pleased to make available a room on the second floor of their

home which was located diagonally across the street from

MANNARINO's residence at a distance of approximately 125 feet.

SAS DOUCE and ABEGGLEN maintained a photographic surveillance

and Photo Tel

MANNARINO was not observed although several photographs

of his

family were taken.

on sunday, 0/7/59, the photographic surveillance

continued from 7:30 AM until 12:30 PM with agents working 15

minute shifts on the camera in order tobe prepared when

MANNARINO left his home.

At 11:05 AM on Sunday morning,

MANNARINO appeared in the doorway wearing sunglasses and a

summer hat pulled well down over his eyes. He quickly walked

from the doorway to his car parked in front of his house, with

hishead down, and SA ABEGGLEN was able to take approximately 15

photographs in the space of approximately 20 seconds. At

present,

these photographs are

being developed but it is

doubtful whether they will be of any value to this investigation.

No additional photographic surveillances are

contemplated from the POST home or elsewhere In New Kensington

because of the obstacles outlined above.

The situation will be

followed closely, however, and in the event MANNARINO should

ever appear in public without sunglasses photographic

survei lances will again be considered.

ALBERTO ARDURA, aka., Alberto Ardura Moya

Investigation conducted to date in Miami and Jacksonville,

Florida, discloses that ARDURA, a Cuban National and part owner

of the Tropicana Nightclub, now living In Ormond Beach, Florida,

with his family since the collapse of the BATISTA government,

has been identified in connection with an exchange of long

distance telephone calls to NORMAN ROTHMAN, now under Indictment

in this case, which included calls to "SAMMY" in New York City

during February, 1959, who is probably 1dentical with

national top hoodlum SAMUEL MANNARINO.

For the benefit of all offices, ARDURA has long been

recognized by

the Pittsburgh Office as a confederate of SAMUEL

MANNARINO. As an example, MANNARINO in October, 1956, advised

that he had shipped a number of slot machines to ARDURA and

ROTHMAN in care of the Tropicana Nightclub in Havana, Cuba,

and pointed out that Cuban Government, at that time,

had

granted them permission to place the machines in various spots

throughout the island. MANNARINO at that time admitted that

he would have an interest in the operation.

Moreover, Havana 4, Interviewed by the Legat in

September, 1956, described ARDURA as the principal importer

of slot machines in Cuba associated with MARTIN FOX in the

operation of the Tropicana Nightclub. Havana 4 at that time

characterized ARDURA as a close personal friend of Colonel

ROBERTO FERNANDEZ MIRANDA, brother-in-law of former Cuban

dictator FULGENCIO BATISIA and director of the Cuban National

Commission of Sports. Havana 4 said at that time that

through the influence of MIRANDA, ARDURA had no difficulty

In placing slots on location In Cuba: #(U)

To further demonstrate ARDURA's closeness to

MANNARINO, It Is Interesting to note that during the Top

Hoodlum investigation In New Kensington, it was discovered

that during the period, March, 195% to July, 1957, the

New Ken Novesty Company operated by MANNARio, shipped 137

slot machines and five boxes of slot machine parts to

ALBERT ARDURA, In care of the Tropicana Nightclub.

on the basis of past experience in the Top Hoodlum

Program, there 1s little doubt that MANNARINO, ROTHMAN and

ARDURA are very close and it is not beyond the realm of

possibility that ARDURA, along with ROIlMAN, could have been

the receiver of the National Guard weapons when they reached

Cuba.

It is significant that Dr. LOUIS C. PESSOLANO,

when first interviewed concerning the part he played in

the

gun-running conspiracy, came up with the name CECIL HARDURA,

as the person who instructed him to rent the twin engine

Beechcraft for a hunting and fishing party.

Dr. PESSOLANO

nas, of course, implicated ROTHMAN as the man who instructed

him

in the matter

since that time but in his effort to hamper

the investigation; PESSOLANO may have unintentionally brought

out the fictitious name HARDURA knowing that ARDURA was

involved in the conspiracy.

PHILLIP. JAMES MAINER, FBI #868314A

It is recalled that MAINER and his associate, GEORGE

MIKE FLOREA, FBI #2888609, were named by Canton; Onto,

Police

Department Informant at the beginning of this investigation

as the men who committed the burglary at the Ohio National

Guard Armory on 10/14/58.

that MAINER was not

the person who accompanied UFFIE CHARLES, deceased, several

years ago in an effort to sell a load of

stolen cigarettes.

ABRAHAM also denied that he ever referred CHARLES or anyone

else attempting to sell stolen merchandise, to GABRIEL

MANNARINO at the S&S Distributing Company or anyone

connected with

the MANNARINO gang:

It is noted that eariler in this investigation

confidential source MIKE ZERVOS, Who Is well acquainted with

ABRAHAM, positively identified MAINER as the person who

approached ABRAHAMalth another unknown individual approximately

two years ago in an erfort to sell a load of cigarettes.

ZERVOS also pointed out at that time that he had seen MAINER

as to who perpetrated the burglary.

he has no positive information that CARUSO was actually

connected with the job but described him as an active

racket figure in Canton and one time lieutenant of "NICK

Carton.

ABRAHAM was of the opinion that further investigation

Of CARUSO and his associates would be varranted in this case.

JEROME M. GLUCK, aka., Jerry G11CK,

FBI: #5039711

The following investigation was conducted to

identify JEROME M. GLUCK, who was characterized during

the: Initial stages of this investigation as an agent for

the Dominican Republic attempting to purchase arms and

ammunition in Pittsburgh, Pa.

Thisphase of theinvestigation

1s considered important since the name JERRY GLICK, OW

1dentifled as JEROME M. GLUCK, was first introduced into

the case in connection with a long distance telephone call

from JOE MEROLA's sulte at the Warwick Hotel In New York,

N.Y., on 9/6/58, to the office of JAMES A. ASHTON, attorney

at law, Pittsburgh:

A summary of this phase of the Investigation will

be found on cover pages D through K, in report of SA RICHARD

GORDON DOUCE, PIttsburgh, 4/20/59.

On 5/5/59 MAXWELL KAHN, editor and pubalsner,

"Clairton Progress," weekly newspaper published in clairton,

Pa., advised SAS DOUCE and THOMAS G. FORSYTH III, as follows:

He has been a resident of Clairton only since 1943 and

never became too well acquainted with the CLUCK family; hug who

he heard rumors that JERRY GLUCK was a "loafer and gambler"

had been in some sort of trouble with the law prior to the time

KAHN arrived in Clairton. He said he was certain that ANDY

KVASNAK, Clairton real estate agent, would know more about the

GLUCKS.

on the same date BERNARD J. WATKO, Real Estate Agent,

Andrew Kvasnak Agency, 324 St. Clair Avenue, Clairton, advised

SAS DOUCE and FORSYTH as follows:

WATKO's father-in-law, ANDREW KVASNAK, Is the rental

agent for several properties in Clairton owned by the GLUCK

family. SAMUEL GLUCK formerly owned the property. He was a

banker in Clairton until his retirement in 1948, at which time

he moved to Florida. SAMUEL GLUCK died in about 1957, and his

properties are now owned by his widow, SARAH GLUCK, who resides

at 220 South Coconut Lane, Palm Island, Miami Beach 39, Florida.

Mr. and urs. GLUcK had two sons, the elder being JERRY GLUCK,

Florida.

of age, is a graduate of the Law School, University of Pittsburgh,

and 1s a practicing attorney in Miami, Florida.

JERRY GLUCK attended the University of Pittsburgh

but was expelled for some unknown reason.

He was a "ne'er-do

well" who would not study or work but preferred to spend his

gambling or shooting pool. He was involved in some sort

of a"lover's lane" murder In approximately 1942 but was

subsequently cleared by a Coronen's Jury in Allegheny County,

Pittsburgh. JERRY GLUCK left home and went to Florida, purpose

unknown, in approximately 1946 or 1947. He married a girl

names HARTSTEIN (phonetic),who was the daughter of a wealthy

Pittsburgh hardware dealer, and when she received

a substantial

inheritance, JERRY GLUCK dissipated it.

In about 1950 and 1951,

JERRY GLUCK. was arrested and convicted on a charge of rape in

Florida, and he spent several years in a penal institution in Florida

as a result of this conviction.

On the same date Chief PETER P. ORSINI, Clairton

Police Department, advised SAS DOUCE and FORSYTH that his

department had no record of arrest for any member of the GLUCK

family.

He said he was not clear as to the facts but did

recall

that JERRY GLUCK had been arrested, and subsequently

cleared, in a murder case in about 1942 and he said the

Allegheny County Detective Bureau, Pittsburgh, would probably

have the details.

Chief ORSINI said that recently a source

of his, whom he declined to identify, told him that JERRY

GLUCK had been in the Clairton - Pittsburgh vicinity in the

summer of 1958 for a few weeks.

Chief ORSII said his

source

related that JERRY GLUCK had been attempting to buy a "discount

departed,

there was

"plenty of action" there.

On the same date EDWARD PAULSEN, resident manager,

Webster Hall Hotel,

Oakland Section, Pittsburgh, advised SAS

DoUcE and Forsyth that a thorough review of the hotel's records

for the months of May and September, 1958, reflected no infor-

mation concerning JERRY GLUCK or other names he has possibly

used,

such as BEN AZAROW, HENRY COHEN and HENRY STERN. PAULSEN

said that his was the only good hotel in the oakland section

of Pittsburgh, and that the old Schenley Hotel had gone out of

existence prior to May, 1958.

The Miami Office on 6/5/59 forwarded a photograph

Of JEROME M. GLUCK, Miami Beach Police Department #A16981,

INVESTIGATION CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY LATENT FINGERPRINT IMPRESSION

ON FIVE GALLON OIL CAN RECOVERED AT ALLEGHENY VALLEY AIRPORT,

12/5/58

Extensive investigation has

been conducted to identify

the latent impression on the five gallon oil can, including a

fingerprint analysis of all officers

and enlisted men assigned

to the 744th AAA Missile Battalion, at Russellton,

Pa., "near

the Allegheny Valley Alrport.

During the initial

stages of

this case, the manufacturer of the hydraulic oil was

Identified in Los Angeles, California, and the shipment in

which the can was shipped

to Army Ordinance has abso been

established. It has been determined that cans similar to

the one recovered at the Allegheny Valley Airport on

11/5/58 were shipped by Army Ordinance to the 744th AAA Missile

Battalion.

Moreover, a number of such cans were actually

observed on the missile launching site and since investigation

at Canton, Ohio, indicates that five gallon oil cans are not

stocked by the National Guard Armory, no further inquiry will

be made concerning this phase of the

investigation at this time

since it appears that the oil can was not thrown from SUTOR's

airplane on 10/26/58 or 11/4/58.

The fingerprints of all logical suspects have been

compared with the latent impression on the can without making

an identification.

Telephone Company Sources

The source at the Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania

1s Special Agent WILLIAM MEREDITH contacted by SA HAROLD L.

STEVENS.

The source at the North Pittsburgh Telephone Company

1S EULA POFF, Commerical Supervisor, contacted by SA RICHARD

GORDON DOUCE.

LEADS

All offices conducting investigation in this case are

requested to submit the results promptly in report form in order

to keep the Bureau advised of current developments.

At Canton, Ohio

1. Will contact logical Informants concerning PAT

CARUSO or PAT FERRUCCIO described as an important racket

the burglary on 10/14/58.

2. Will conduct investigation requested in Pittsburgh

to telephone number Gb 2-1024, called seven days after the

burglary (10/21/58) from the private line of SAMUEL MANNARINO

in New Kensington. It is noted that the same number was called

by MANNARINO for "GEORGE" from the St. Moritz Hotel In New York

City on 10/22/58.

3. In the event investigation discloses that this

Canton number is registered to GEORGE MIKE FLOREA, FBI #2888609,

or that it 1s a telephone which he has used in the past, he

should be interviewed at length and viewed as a definite

suspect in connection with the burglary on 10/14/58.

six days

Ohio National Guard Armory were flown out of the Allegheny

Valley Airport by STUART SUTOR.

JACKSONVILLE

At Daytona and Ormond Beach, Florida

1. Will review background material concerning ALBERTO

ARDURA covering his numerous dealings with SAMUEL MANNARINO and

NORMAN ROTHMAN set out previously herein on pages H and I.

2. Will Interview B. W. COFFIN, U.S. Border Patrol

Inspector, to determine ARDURA's official immigration status

and whether he might be subject to deportation for failure

to provide full cooperation in connection with this investigation.

It is noted that ARDURA, on 1/20/59, telephoned

Mrs. BATISTA presumably at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York

City. Mrs. BATISTA is probably the wife of former Cuban

dictator, FULGENCIO BATISTA, who has long been rumored to have

worked closely with ARDURA when he was in power in Cuba.

3.

Will, in the light of investigation conducted

concerning EDMUND A. CHESTER, furnish your recommendations

concerning the productivity of a thorough interview with

ARDURA for information of value in this case.

It seems logical

to assume that since ARDURA 1s probably a BATISTA sympathizer

it would probably be dangerous for him to return to Cuba at

this time. Consequently, his immigration status should be

determined prior to such an interview and Jacksonville should

request all pertinent reports from Pittsburgh, Cleveland and

Miami before contemplating the interview.

2. Will Interview MILTON thoroughly concerning the

report that

he made some arrangement with MEROLA alter purchasing

the boat to work out the price by making trips presumably for

MEROLA.

This investigation is requested because the USA's

office in Pittsburgh feels that any evidence

showing a pattern

of activity or involvement of MEROLA in revolutionary activities

might be admitted as evidence in USDe to substantiate the

conspiracy charges.

Consequently, if MILTON would disclose that

he ran guns between the United States and Cuba for MEROLA, such

Information would be of great value to the investigation.

3. Will, at the appropriate USOGDistrict office,

confirm information furnished by Border Patrol Inspector

ANTHONY PROVENZO that MEROLA was actually the registered owner

of the boat "MENACE.

At Miami Beach, Florida

Will interview JEROME M. GLUCK, FBI #5039711, for

1958, after he had obtained permission from STUART SUTOR

to search the twin Beech airplane SUTOR had flown into the

Morgantown Airport, he started toward the airplane but saw

a

plane approaching the airport at that time, and waited

to see if that plane was carrying the Border Patrol Agent

he had been told was

Corporal

SNODGRASS stated that he had not searched the twin Beech,

but had started to the twin Beech to do so when he saw the

other plane approaching.

He advised that when the plane

he had seen approaching landed, it taxied up near the twin

Beech, and he went to meet it.

He stated that Agent

GROOTENDORST of the Border Patrol got out of the plane

and

identified himself, and it is his, Corporal SNODGRASS',

recollection that

he and GROOTENDORST went directly over

to the twin Beech at that time.

Corporal SNODGRASS advised

he was unable to recall whether he and GROOTENDORST

merely looked in through the window at that time, or whether

they actually checked the cargo, but he does recall

that Agent GROOTENDORST was immediately satisfied that

the cargo was guns. He advised that he and GROOTENDORST

only remained at the plane for a moment and then went

into the airport manager's office where SUTOR was being

held. He advised that GROOTENDORST busied himself about

arrangements to secure the twin Beech airplane and put a

guard on the plane, and also with arrangements about taking

SUTOR into Morgantown for interview, etc.

ANTHONY REMICH, owner of the Remich Flying Service and the

Allegheny Valley Airport, Russellton, Pa., was interviewed

at his place of business

on April 29, 1959, by SAS RICHARD

GORDON DOUCE and THOMAS C. FORSYTH, III.

At the outset REMICH was advised that he was not required

to make any statements and that any statements he might

make could be used against him in a court of law.

He was

also advised that. he could consult with an attorney as to

the advisability of participating in an interview with

Special Agents of the FBI.

REMICH then examined a photograph of the five gallon low

viscosity ofl can found at the Allegheny Valley Airport

on November 5;

1958, and stated that he had never seen

that type of U,S. Army container on his property before.

REMICH pointed out however that it is not uncommon for

men assigned to the Battery "D" Launching Site adjoining

the airport runway. to dispose of oil cans by throwing them

over the fence onto his property.

In conclusion REMICH authorized SAS DOUCE and FORSYTH to

search the end of airport runway adjoining the Battery.

It is recalled that investigation conducted in

April, 1959,

established that ALVIN FISH of 765 Freeport Road,

Creighton,

Pa., was helping Mr. and Mrs. THOMAS OCCELLI set

tile inthe kitchen of their home near the Allegheny Valley

Airport during the latter part of October, 1958, when a young,

unidentified man walked into the OCCELLI home and requested

to use the telephone.

The investigation established that the unknown

individual placed a lengthy toll call, presumably to Pittsburgh,

and left the house without paying the OCCELLIs.

While in the

OCCELLI home, the individual mentioned that he had just arrived

on a airplane at the Allegheny Valley Airport.

When he

left, the OCCELLIs and FISH noticed that he had difficulty

starting a small black foreign sports car that he said was

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

INTERVIEW REPORT,

Date

May 11, 1959

EUGENE A ChorUl, Intelligence Officer, United

States Border Fatro, d9th and Grant Streets, Lampa,

Florioa, stated that when ne was previousty interviewed by

SA GEORGE E. DAVIS he mentioned that Border Patrol suspicions

had increased concerning the Beechcraft plane, Serial

Number N7165-C, when Information was received from trooper

SKILMAN, Pennsylvania State Police, that JOSEPH MEROLA of

mams was laentilled as naving made a trip with the piot.

of this plane October 24, 1958, because of previous Information

making MEROLA suspect in gun smuggling activities. He

explained the name of MEROLA had first, come to attention in

January or February, 1958, in connection with an incident

Involving a boat called "MENACE."

CHAPUT recalled that the "MENACE" was a 28 foot

boat, United States Coast Guard Humber 1801491, which went

aground with a hole in her bottom near lower Matacumbe, Key,

Florida, on January 31, 1958. Six men went ashore from the

boat.

and were seen by JAck wArson; united states rian and

Wildlite service, Tavernier, Forida,

who reported the matter

to the Border Patrol.

Three of the

men were observed to

catch a north bound bus toward Miami.

The other three

originally headed south but later returned to the vicinity

of the boat where they were seen by Border Patrol Inspector

ANTHONY PROVENZO, who identified them as CESAR VEGA, HECTOR

DUARE and HUMBERTO WEBSTER. PROVENZO was able to identify

them because all three had previously been arrested by

Unitdd States Customs and Border Patrol at Big Pine Key

& board

the boat "PHILOMAR IIT" as they were attempting to

launch an armed expedition to Cuba, and all three were

out

on bond at the time of this incident, January 31, 1958.

CHAPUT said PROVENZO and possibly other Border

Patrol officers searched the "MENACE" but found no arms

aboard. They did find three 55 gallon fuel drums on the

boat as well as large quantities of food and a suitcase full

of brass weights bearing the inscription "Cuba Rebelde", which

weights he understood (source not recalled) were commonly

used by the Cuban rebels to hurl through plate glass windows

of "enemy" establishments. He said there was also a report

at the time, although he could not identify the source,

that the men had been

seen tossing something overboard before

they beached the "MENACE" and went ashore; however, he said

a search of the area failed to locate anything. He went

on to say the captain of the "MENACE" was one HANS GOSTA

MILTON, who claimed to have bought it about a week

previously at the Flagler Marina in Miant.

When questioned

by PROVENZO, MILTON denied knowing who the previous owner

of the boat was but said it may have been JOE MEROLA.

Asked about how he paid for the boat, MILTON said there

was an agreement for him to work it out on trips..

CHA PUT

said it is his recollection that the records of the Coast

Guard confirmed MEROLA's previous ownership of this boat.

CHA PUT said there were other instances where

MEROLA's name came up in connection with Cuban revolutionafy

activities, the details of which he does not now recall.

He said he does not recall any specific allegation of gun

running on MEROLA's part but the circumstances of his name

cropping up repeatedly caused him to be suspect.
