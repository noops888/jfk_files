SAMUEL MANNARING, FBI #115840

The following investigation was conducted in an
effort to obtain a recent photograph of national top hoodlum,
SAMUEL MANNARINO, to establish his presence at the Seagull
Hotel in Miami Beach, Florida, under the alias SAL MANN,
during the important stages of the gun-running conspiracy,
i.e. 10/24/58 - 11/7/58. A recent photograph is also needed
in connection with investigation at the Warwick and St. Moritz
Hotels, New York, New York. :

On 4/30/59 SA RICHARD GORDON DOJCE contacted NORMAN
GREENBERG, crime reporter for the "Pittsburgh Post Gazette,"
JAMES ROGERS, crime reporter for the "Pittsbur, Press," and
LESTER SULLIVAN, crime reporter for the "Pittsburgh Sun
Telegraph," with the request that they make a thorough ‘search
of their respective newspapermorgues in an effort to locate
a photograph of MANNARINO. The reporters pointed out that for
a number of years they have been interested in obtaining a
photograph of MANNARINO, but to the best of their knowledge
no photographs of him exist. Each reporter promisted to
recheck his respective ‘newspaper morgue but when recontacted on
5/4/59 all stated that they were unable to locate a photograph
of MANNARINO. : :

WILLIAM AKLSTROM, news giltor, New Kensington, Pa.,
"Daily Dispatch" newspaper, on 6/4/59 advised SA FRANK E, ALLISON,
JR., that for the past 20 years he has made every possibile effort
to ohtain a photograph of MANNARINO for publication in connection
with racket articles to no avail. AHLSTROM stated that he has
requested MANNARINO to give him a photograph on many occasions
and has been refused every time. AHLSTROM pointed out that he
has been very reluctant to take MANNARINO's photograph
surreptitiously since MANNARINO would undoubtedly file suit
against him and might even subject him to physical violence.
In conelusion, AHLSTROM expressed the opinion that there is
no photograph of SAMUEL MANNARINO in existence.

| SAS.RICHARD GORDON DOUCE and ROBERT G. ABEGGLEN to establish

a photographic surveillance on the second floor of the -

| Central Drug Company, Executive Office, which overlooks the
Ken Iron and Steel Company in New Kensington, owned and
operated. by MANNARINO. Before making contact with the Central

photographs could be taken at a’ distance of about 35 feet.
Since the inception of the Top Hoodlum Program serious

5/29/59 was contacted concerning $i 2 FBI's 4 t+ im obtaining
@ photograph of MANNARINO. Without disclosing any details

of the investigation, HUG was told that MANNARING was the subject
of an-important criminal investigation and that the PBI would
greatly appreciate using a second Ploor office as a vantage
point to obtain his photograph. HUG stated that.in the

interest of good citizenship and because of his disgust over

the corruptive influence present in New Kensington due to
MANNARINO control of the community he would be glad to

make the space available with the approval of 4, H, BLEIER,
President of Central Drag Company.

Mr. HUG suggested that the agents wait for Mr. BLEIER's
return since be was expected in the office within the hour.
When Mr. BLEIER arrived, Mr. HUG did not explain the purpose
of the visit and SAS DOUCE and ABEG@LEN were introduced -to
Mc. BLEIER and accompanied him to his office on the second floor
which was the ideal location to take photographs.

It should be noted that when SAS DOUCE and ABEGGLEN
entered the Central Drug Company they did mot identify themselves
to the receptionist on duty but merely asked to speak to Mr.
HUG. Since the agents were carrying briefcases containing
cameras and were required to wait a short time before seeing
Mr. HUG in a room occupied by drug salesmen also carrying
briefcases, there was absolutely no grounds for the receptionist
to assume that the callers were Special Agents of the PBI.

This form of approach was taken to afford the utmost precaution
and protection to the Central Drug executive contact since it
was felt that no one in the company except one or possibly two
executives, should know of the agents' desires.

PG 52-1687 :

Mr. BLEIER appeared to be genuinely pleased to
see the interviewing agents and before the purpose of the
visit was explained; he outlined at some length his hardships
as a young man who successfully developed a profitable chain
of drug stores servicing several Pennsylvania counties. He
stated that he was appalled that the racket element in New
Kensington held such tight control over the community and
emphasized that over the years he has attempted to dedicate
himself to improving the situation by being of service to
his community. As an example, BLEIER pointed out that he is a
former member of the Lions and somewhat active as 4 Rotarian.
Mr. BLEIER also spoke at some length about his membership
in the local country club and at that point in the interview
asked the agents how he might be of assistance. ~

Without disclosing any details of the investigation,
Mr. BLEIER was told that SAMUEL MANNARINO was the subject of
an important criminal investigation being conducted by the
FBI and that he could be of real service by making his office
available as a vantage point from which the agents could
obtain a photograph of MANNARINO. Upon hearing this, Mr.
BLEIER's hands began to shake noticeably and his entire
attitude and expression changed immediately. It seemed
obvious to the interviewing agents that the man was almost
terror stricken at the agents' request when it involved
MANNARINO.

After a few moments of silence on the part’ of Mr.
BLEIER, he finally re-gained his composure and began’ making
excuses to the effect that if his employees ever learned that
photographs were taken from his office, business might be
subjected to a boycott on the part of the Italian population
in New Kensington. Mr. BLEIER was reminded that it was his
duty as a good citizen to extend cooperation to the FBI in
connection with investigations into violations of Federal
law, and he agreed that it was his clear duty to grant the
agents' permission to take the photographs. He agreed that
aman of his background and position in the community should
be pleased to assist the FBI especially when such assistance
would be of great value in the possible solution of an

damportant matter under investigation involving one that

he admittedly recognized as being responsible for the
present corruption in his community. Mr. BLEIER strongly
implied that he was afraid of MANNARINO and his confederates
and the possible reprisal he might be subjected to if the
photographs were ever made public. :

It was explained to Mr. BLEIER that the photographs
would be treated in such a manner that such a situation would
never occur, but he still declined,to give his permission.

He promised, however, to give the matter some serious thought
and would contact the office if he changed his mind.

Mr. BLEIER was reinterviewed by SAS DOUCE and ABEGGLEN
on 6/1/59 and again refused to give his permission to take
photographs, saying that he had to place duty to his business
above duty to his country.

Mr. WILLIS V.i HUG was recontacted on 6/1/59 by
SAS DOUCE and ABEGGLEN ‘at which time he emphasized that he
was greatly disappointed over the decision reached by Mr.
BLEIER, but added that since he had no control over this
situation there was nothing at all he cowl do.

It is noted that only Mr. BLEIER and Mr.HUG were
aware that agents had contacted the Central Drug Company for
the purpose of obtaining a photograph of MANNARINO,

It is noted that even though SCHWARTZ has been
most cooperative in the past in connection with top hoodlum
investigation in New Kensington, he was not given any
information concerning the plans to photograph MANNARINO from
the Central Drug Company nor was the unsuccessful approach to
the Central Drug Company revealed to him.

It appears logical to assume that BLEIER was in
such fear of reprisal on the part of MANNARINO and his
confederates should it become known that Bureau Agents
attempted to photograph him, that he immediately told
MANNARINO of the Bureau's plans. ‘This situation is an excellent
example of the obstacles that must be overcome in connection
with any violation within the Bureau's Jurisdiction in New
Kensington which is dominated completely by the MANNARINO
gang. .

On 5/29/59 SA DOUCE contacted Mr. and Mrs. JAMES C. POST,
established neighborhood sources covering MANNARINO's residence
since the inception of the Top Hoodlum Program. Without
disclosing details of the investigation Mr. and Mrs. POST were
impressed with the necessity of obtaining a recent photograph
of MANNARINO, Mr. POST, an executive in the International
Division of ALCOA, and his wife, stated that they would be
pleased to make available a room on the second floor of their
home which was located diagonally across the street from
MANNARINO's residence at a distance of approximately 125 feet.
SAS DOUCE and ABEGGLEN maintained a photographic surveillance
from the POST residence using the Alfa camera and Photo Tel
lens from 8:15 AM until 6:30 PM on Saturday, 6/6/59, but
MANNARINO was not observed although several photographs of his
family were taken.

On sunday, 6/7/59, the photographic surveillance
continued from 7:30 AM until 12:30 PM with agents working 15
minute shifts on the camera in order tobe prepared when
MANNARINO left his home. At 11:05 AM on Sunday morning,
MANNARINO appeared in the doorway wearing sunglasses and a
summer hat pulled well down over his eyes. -He quickly walked
from the doorway to his car parked in front of his house,’ with
hishead down, and SA ABEGGLEN was able to take approximately 15

photographs in the space of approximately 20 seconds. At-
present, these photographs are being developed but it is
doubtful whether they willbe of-any value to this investigation.

No additional photographic: surveillances are
contemplated from the POST -home or elsewhere in New Kensington
because of the obstacles outlined above. The situation will be
followed closely, however, and in the event MANNARINO should
ever appear in- public without sunglasses photographic
surveillances will again~be considered.

ALBERTO ARDURA, aka., Alberto Ardura Moya

Investigation conducted to date in Miami and Jacksonville,
Florida, discloses that ARDURA, a Cuban National and: part-owner
of the Tropicana Nightclub, now living in Ormond Beach, Florida,
with his family since the collapse of the BATISTA government,
has been identified in connection with an-exchange of--long
distance. telephone .calls to NORMAN ROTHMAN, now under indictment
in this case,which included calls to "SAMMY" in-New York City
during February, 1959, who is probably identical with
national top hoodlum SAMUEL’ MANNARINO.

For the benefit of all offices, ARDURA has long been
recognized by the Pittsburgh Office as a confederate of SAMUEL
MANNARINO. As an example, MANNARINO in October, 1956, advised
. that he had shipped: a number of slot: machines to ARDURA: and
ROTHMAN in care of the Tropicana Nightclub in Havana, Cuba,
and pointed out that.Cuban Government, at that time, had
_ ranted them permission to place the machines’ in various spots
throughout the island.-MANNARINO at that time admitted, that
he would have an interest in the operation:

Moreover; Havana 4, interviewed by the Legat in
September, 1956, described ARDURA as the principal importer
of slot machines in Cuba associated with MARTIN FOX in the
operation of the Tropicana Nightclub. Havana 4 at that time
characterized ARDURA as a close personal friend of Colonel
ROBERTO FERNANDEZ MIRANDA, brother-in-law of former Cuban
aictator FULGENCIO BATISTA and director of.the Cuban Nationa @

pees - Keer
PG 52-1687

Commission of Sports. Havana 4 said-at that time that
through the influence of MIRANDA, ARDURA had no aifficulty
in placing slots on-location-in- Cuba. KW

To further demonstrate ARDURA's closeness to
MANNARINO,, it is interesting to note that: during the Top
Hoodlum investigation in’ New: Kensington, it was discovered
that during the period, March; 1957, to July, 1957, the
New Ken-Novelty Company; operated by MANNARINO, ~shipped 137
slot machines and five boxes of slot machine parts to
ALBERT ARDURA, im care of the Tropicana Nightclub.

On the basis of past experience in the Top Hoodlum
Program, there is little doubt that MANNARINO, ROTHMAN -and
ARDURA are rvery close and it is~not~ beyond the realm of
Possibility that ARDURA, along with ROTHMAN,’ could have been
the receiver of the National Guard weaponsewhen they reached
Cuba.

It is significant that Dr. LOUIS Cc. -PESSOLANO,
when first interviewed concerning the part he played in the
gun-running conspiracy, came up with the name CECIL HARDURA,
as the person who: instructed him-to rent: the twin-engine
Beechcraft for a hunting and-fishing party. Dr.-PESSOLANO
has, of course, implicated ROFHMAN-as the man: who instructed

him in the matter since that time but in his effort to hamper
the investigation, -PESSOLANO may have unintentionally brought

out the fictitious-name HARDURA knowing that ARDURA was
involved in’ the conspiracy.

PHILLIP JAMES MAINER, FBI #868314a

It is recalled: that -MAINER and his associate, GEORGE
MIKE FLOREA, FBI- #2888609, were named*by Canton, Ohio, Police

Department informant at the beginning of this investigation
as the men who committed the burglary at the Ohio National
Guard Armory on 10/14/58;

It is also recalled that supplemental investigation

PCI HENRY ABRAHAM of this office approximately two years. ago
in an effort- to sell a load of stolen -cigarettes-which may
have eventually reached GABRIEL -MANNSRINO; owner of the

S & 5 Distributing Company; a cigarette vending machine
business in New Kensington.---Most offices are-aware that
the S & S Distributing: Company panel truck was used to
transport part of the stolen-weapons to the airport in this
case and, of course, GABRIEL MANNARINO is the brother of
SAMUEL MANNSRINO.

When interviewed im February, 1959, POI ABRAHAM
claimed he was not acquainted with MAINER but mentioned
two individuals had approached him some time ago with a
load of hot cigarettes. It may be significant that ABRAHAM
brought out the name of a mat who tried to sell the hot
cigarettes who is now deag.

The following investigation was conducted: to
--again determine whether ABRAHAM could be acquainted with
MAINER . :

On 4/21/59 PCL ABRAHAM examined a good: photograph
of MAINER and advised SA JOHNS. PORTELLA that-MAENER was not
the person who accompanied UPFIE CHARLES, deceased, several
years ago in an effort to sell a load of stolen cigarettes.
ABRAHAM also denied that he ever referred CHARLES or anyone
else attempting to sell stolen-merchandise to GABRIEL
MANNARINO at the S-& S Distributing Company or anyone
connected with the MANNARINO gang. -

: It is noted that earlier in this investigation
confidential source MIKE ZERVOS, who is well acquainted with
ABRAHAM, positively idenmtifiied-MAINER as the person who
approached ABRAHAMwith another unknown individual approximately
two years ago in an effort to sell a load of cigarettes.

ZERVOS also pointed out at-that time that he had seen MAINER

in New Kensington on a-number of occasions loafing around the
Kenmar-’ Hotel which is a gathering place’ for members of the
MANNARINO gang. As an example, DANIEL HANNA, aka., SPEEDO,

Canton, Ohio, and a very~close friend of AL SEID of -the
MANNARINO gang in-New: Kensington; might have had-something
to do with the National Guard Armory~burglary.~- ABRAHAM
furnished this information im response to a question-by
SA PORTELLA as to whether ABRAHAM had any theories or ideas
as to who-perpetrated the burglary. ABRAHAM stated that
he has no positive information that CARUSO was actually
connected with the job but described him as an active
racket figure in Canton and one time lieutenant of "NICK
THE GREEK," who at one time controlled the rackets of .
Cariton. ABRAHAM was of the opinion that further investigation
of CARUSO an@ his associates would be warranted in this case.

JEROME-M. GLUCK, aka., Jerry Glick, FBI #5039711

The following investigation was conducted to
identify JEROME M. GLUCK, who was characterized during
the: initial stages of this investigation as an-agent for
the Dominican Republic attempting to purchase arms and
ammunition in Pittsburgh, Pa. Thisthase of theinvestigation
is considered ‘important ‘since the name JERRY GLICK, now
identified as  JEROME’M. GLUCK, was first introduced into
the casein connection with a. long distance telephone: call
from JOE MEROLA's suite at the Warwick Hotel in New-York,
N.Y¥., on 9/6/58, .to the office of JAMES A. ASHTON, attorney
at law, Pittsburgh:

A- summary of this phase of the investigation will
be found on cover pages D through K, in report of SA RICHARD
GORDON DOUCE, Pittsburgh, 4/20/59.

on 5/5/59: MAXWELL KAHN, editor and publisher,

"Clairton Progress," weekly newspaper published in Clairton,

He has been a resident of Clairton only since 1943 and
never became too well acquainted with the GLUCK famtly;~hoever,
he heard rumors that JERRY-GLUCK was a "loafer and gambler" who
had been in some ‘sort of- trouble with the law prior to the time
KAHN arrived in Clairton. He said he was certain that ANDY
KVASNAK, Clairton real estate agent, would know more about the
GLUCKS,

On the same date BERNARD J, WATKO, Real Estate Agent,
Andrew Kvasnak Agency, 324 St. Clair Avenue, Clairton, advised
SAS DOUCE and FORSYTH as follows: :

WATKO's father-in-law, ANDREW KVASNAK, is the rental
agent for several properties in Clairton owned by the GLUCK
family. SAMUEL GLUCK formerly owned the -property.--He was a
banker in Clairton until his retirement in 1948, at which time
he moved to Florida. SAMUEL GLUCK died in about 1957, and his
properties are now owned by his widow, SARAH GLUCK, who resides
at 228 South Coconut Lane, Palm Island, Miami Beach 39, Florida.
Mr. and-Mrs. GLUCK had two gons, the elder being JERRY GLUCK,
aged approximately 43, residence unknown, but believed to be in
Florida. The younger son, name not recalled, now about 36 years
of age, is a graduate of the Law School, University of Pittsburgh,
and is a practicing attorney in Miami, Florida.

JERRY GLUCK atittended the University of Pittsburgh
but was expelled for some unknown reason. He was a “ne'er-do
well" who would-not study or work but preferred to spend his
time gambling or shooting pool.- He was involved in some sort
of a"lover's lane" murder in approximately 1942 but was ;
subsequently cleared by a Coronen's Jury in Allegheny County,
Pittsburgh. JERRY GLUCK left home and went to Florida, purpose
unknown, in approximately 1946 or 1947. He married-a-girl
names HARTSTEIN (phonetic),who was the daughter of a wealthy
Pittsburgh hardware dealer, and when she received a substantial
inheritance; JERRY GLUCK dissipated it. In about™1950 and 1951,
JERRY GLUCK. was arrested and convicted on a charge of rape in
Florida, and he spent several years in a penal institution in Florida
as a result of this conviction.

Oh the same date Chief PETER P. ORSINI, Clairton
Police Department, advised SAS DOUCE-and- FORSYTH that his
department had no record of arrest for any member of the GLUCK
family. He said he was not clear as to the facts but did
recall that JERRY GLUCK had been arrested; and subsequently
cleared, in a murder’ case tn about 1942 and he said the
Allegheny County Detective Bureau, Pittsburgh, would probably
have the details. Chief ORSINI said that recently a source
of his, whom-he declined to identify, told him that JERRY
GLUCK had been in the Clairton - Pittsburgh vicinity in the
summer of 1958 for .a few weeks. Chief ORSINI said his source
related that JERRY GLUCK had been attempting to buy a "discount
house" in Pittsburgh, and when the deal fell through, GLUCK
departed, saying he intended to go to Mexico to live because
there was "plenty of action" there.

On the same date EDWARD PAULSEN, resident manager,

Webster Hall Hotel, Oakland Section, Pittsburgh, advised SAS
DOUCE and FORSYTH that a thorough review of the hotel's records
for the months of May and September, 1958, reflected no infor-
mation concerning JERRY GLUCK: or, other names he has possibly —
used, such as BEN AZAROW, HENRY COHEN and HENRY STERN. PAULSEN
said’ that his was the only good hotel in the Oakland section
of Pittsburgh, and that the old Schenley Hotel had gone out of
. existence prior to May, 1958.

The Miami Office on 6/5/59 forwarded a photograph
of JEROME M. GLUCK, Miami Beach Police Department #A16981,
FBI #5039711, obtained from the Miami Beach PD by IC
CLIFFORD M. WERNER. GLUCK's arrest record at the-Miami Beach
PD discloses that he was taken into custody on 5/26/38 by the
State Police, Clinton, Michigan, for gross indezemsy; on 1/27/48,
for disorderly conduct and resisting an officer by the
Hollywood, Florida, PD; and on 12/13/50, for investigation by
the Dade County Sheriff's Office, Miami, Florida.

The Miami Office advised that according to the

files of the Dade County Sheriff's Office, GLUCK was arrested
on 3/16/53 for assault with intent to commit rape.

INVESTIGATION CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY LATENT FINGERPRINT IMPRESSION
ON FIVE GALLON OIL CAN RECOVERED AT ALLEGHENY VALLEY AIRPORT,

11/5/58

Extensive investigation has been conducted to identify
the latent impression on the five gallon oil can, including a
fingerprint analysis of all officers and enlisted men assigned
to the 744th AAA Missile Battalion, at Russellton, Pa., near
the Allegheny Valley Airport. During the initial stages of
this case, the manufacturer of the hydraulic oil was
identified in Los Angeles, California, and the shipment in
which the can was shipped to Army Ordinance has also been
established. It has been determined that cans similar to
the one recovered at the Allegheny Valley Airport on
11/5/58 were shipped by Army Ordinance to the 744th AAA Missile
Battalion. Moreover, a number of such cans were actually
observed on the missile launching site and since investigation
at Canton, Ohio, indicates that five gallon oil cans are not
stocked by the National Guard Armory, no further inquiry will
be made concerning this phase of the investigation at this time
since it appears that the oi] can was not thrown from SUTOR's
airplane on 10/26/58 or 11/4/58.

The fingerprints of all logical suspects have been
compared with the latent impression on the can without making

to telephone numbers called from the private line of national
top hoodlum, SAMUEL MANNARINO, at the Ken Iron and Steel
Company, during the active stages of the gun-running conspiracy.

CLEVELAND
At Canton, Ohio

1.. Will contact logical informants concerning PAT
CARUSO or PAT FERRUCCIO described as an important racket
figure in Canton to determine his possible connection with
the burglary on 10/14/58.

2. Will conduct investigation requested in Pittsburgh
airtel to Bureau, 5/7/59, involving interview with subscriber
to telephone number GL 2-1624, called seven days after ti
burglary (10/21/58) from the private line of SAMUEL-~MANNARINO
in New Kensington. It is noted that the same number was called
by MANNARINO for "GEORGE" from the St. Moritz Hotel in New York
City on 10/22/58.

3. In the event investigation discloses that this
Canton number is registered to GEORGE MIKE FLOREA, FBI #2888609,
or that it. is a telephone which he has used in the past, he
should be interviewed at length and viewed as a definite
suspect in connection with the burglary on 10/14/58. :

4. Will conduct long distance telephone checks for
calls emanating from GL 2-1624 during the period ‘October, 1958,

six days before the first load of weapons stolen from the
Ohio National Guard Armory were flown out of the Allegheny
Valley Airport by STUART SUTOR.

JACKSONVILLE
At Daytona and Ormond Beach, Florida

1, Will review background material concerning ALBERTO
ARDURA. covering his numerous dealings with SAMUEL-~MANNARINO and
NORMAN ROTHMAN set cut previously herein on pages H and I.

2. Will interview B, W. COFFIN, U.S. Border Patrol
Inspector, to determine ARDURA's official immigration status
and whether he might be subject to deportation for failure
to provide full cooperation in connection with this investigation,

It is noted that ARDURA, on 1/20/59, telephoned
Mrs. BATISTA presumably at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York
City. Mrs. BATISTA is probably the wife of former Cuban
dictator, FULGENCIO BATISTA, who has long been rumored to have
worked closely with ARDURA when he was in power in Cuba.

3. Will, in the light of investigation conducted
concerning EDMUND A. CHESTER, furnish your recommendations
concerning the productivity of a thorough interview with
ARDURA for information of value in this case. It seems logical
to assume that since ARDURA is probably a BATISTA sympathizer
it would probably be dangerous for him to return to Cuba at
this time. Consequently, his immigration status should be _
determined prior to such an interview and Jacksonville shaulda
request all pertinent reports from Pittsburgh, Cleveland and
Miami before contemplating the interview.

MEROLA'S reported aynership of the boat “MENACE.”

2. Will interview MILTON thoroughly concerning. the
veport that he made some arrangement with MEROLA after purchasing
the boat to work out the price by making trips presumably for
MEROLA. This investigation is requested because the USA's
office in Pittsburgh feels that any evidence showing a pattern
of activity or involvement of-MEROLA in revolutionary activities
might be admitted as evidence in USDC to substantiate the
conspiracy charges. Consequently, if MILTON would disclose that
he ran guns between the United States and Cuba for MEROLA, such
information would be of great value to the investigation.

: 3. Will, at the appropriate USODistrict Office,
confirm information furnished by Border Patrol Inspector
ANTHONY PROVENZO that MEROLA was actually the registered owner
of the boat "MENACE." :

that MANNARINO placed a long distance telephone call from NORMAN
ROTHMAN's suite at the St. Moritz Hotel person to person to
"GEORGE" in Canton, Ohio, on 10/22/58 or eight days after the
burglary of the Armory. Investigation in New York does not
indicate thslt MANNARINO was registered at the St. Moritz at this
time but it seems reasonable to assume that he probably flew
to Florida immediately after the 10/22/58 call to Canton
since’a check of his telephone at the Ken Iron and Steel

LOUIS C. FESSOLANO collect for-MANNARINO on 10/23/58. Past

a INTERVIEW REPORT ~

oa ae

Corporal WALTER B, SNODGRASS, West Virginia State Police,
Morgantown, W. Va., Detachment, advised that on November 4,
1958, after he had obtained permission. from STYJART SUTOR

to search the twin Beech airplane SUTOR had flown into the
Morgantown Airport, he started toward the airplane but saw
a plane approaching the airport at that time, and waited
to see if that plane was carrying the Border Patrol Agent
he had been told was enroute to Morgantown. Corporal
SNODGRASS stated that he had not searched the twin Beech,
but had started to the twin Beech to do so when he saw the
other plane approaching. He advised that when the plane

he had seen approaching landed, it taxied up near the twin
Beech, and he went to meet it. He stated that Agent
GROOTENDORST of the Border Patrol got out of the plane and
identified himself, and it is his, Corporal SNODGRASS',
recollection that he and GROOTENDORST went directly over
to the twin Beech at that time. Corporal SNODGRASS advised
he was unable to recall whether he and GROOTENDORST

merely looked in through the window at that time, or whether
they, actually checked the cargo, but he does recall

that Agent GROOTENDORST was immediately satisfied that

the cargo was guns. He advised that he and GROOTENDORST
only remained at the plane for a moment and then went

into the airport manager's office where SUTOR was being
held. He advised that GROOTENDORST busied himself about
arrangements to secure the twin Beech airplane and put a
guard on the plane, and also with arrangements about taking
SUTOR into Morgantown for interview, etc,

IV, INTERVIEWS OF WITNESSES AT ALLEGHENY VALLEY AIRPORT,
RUSSELLTON, PA.

. It is recalled that investigation conducted in
April, 1959, established that ALVIN FISH of 765 Freeport Road,
Creighton, Pa., was helping Mr. and Mrs. THOMAS OCCELLI set
tile intthe kitchen of their home near the Allegheny Valley
Airport during the latter part of October, 1958, when a young,
unidentified man walked into the OCCELLI home and requested
to use the telephone.

The investigation established that the unknown
individual placed a lengthy toll call, presumably to Pittsburgh,
and left the house without paying the OCCELLIs. While in the
OCCELLI home, the individual mentioned that he had just arrived
on a airplane at the Allegheny Valley Airport. When he
left,the OCCELLIs.apd FISH noticed that he had difficulty
starting a small black foreign sports car that he said was
left for him at the airport.

e INTERVIEW REPORT © >

Dore MAY) 22, 1959

EUGENE A.CHAPUT, Intelligence Officer, United

States Border Patrol, 19th and Grant Streets, Tampa,
Plorida;, stated that when he was previously interviewed, by
SA GEORGE E. DAVIS he mentioned that Border Patrol suspicions
had increased concerning the Beechcraft plane, Serial
Number N71L65-C, when information was received from Brooper
SKELLMAN, Pennsylvania State Police, that JOSEPH MEROLA. of
Miami was identified as Pare made a trip with the pilot
of this plane October 24, 1958, because of previous information
making MEROLA suspect in gun-smuggling activities. He
explained the name of MEROLA had first, come to attention in
January or February, 1958, in connection with an incident

. involving a boat called "MENACE."

nO

‘AG CEMEIARL

CHA PUT recalled that the "MENACE" was a 28° foot
oe United States Coast Guard Mumber 1801491, which went
aground with a hole in her bottom near lower Matacumbe,, Key,
Florida, om January 31, 1958. Six men went askore from the
boat and were seen by JACK WATSON, United States Figh and
Wildlife Service, Tavernier, Florida, who reported the matter
to the Border Patrol. Three of the men were observed to
catch a north bound bus toward Miami. The other three
originally headed south but later returned tothe vicinity
of the boat where they were seen by Border Patrol Inspector
ANTHONY PROVENZO, who identified them as CESAR VEGA, HECTOR
DUARTE ,and- HUMBERTO WEBSTER. PROVENZO was able to identify
them because all three had previously been arrested by
Unitdd States Customs and Border Patrol at Big Pine Key’
aboard the boat "PHILOMAR III" as they were attempting to
launch an armed expedition to Cuba, and all three were out
on bond at the time of this incident, January 31, 1958.,

CHAPUT said PROVENZO and possibly other Border

aboard, They did find three 55 gallon fuel drums on the
boat as well as large quantities of food and a su&dtepase full
of brass weights bearing the insaription "Cuba Rebelde", which
weights he understood (source not recalled) were commonly :
used by the Cuban rebels to hurl through plate glass windows ,
of "enemy" establishments, He said there was also a report

at the time, although he could not identify the source,
that the men had been seen tossing something overboard before
they beached the "MENACE" and-went-ashore; however, he said
a search of the area failed to locate anything. “He went

on to say the captain of the "MENACE" was-one HANS GOSTA
MILTON, who claimed to have bought it about a week
previously at the Flagler Marina in Miami. When questioned
by PROVENZO, MILTON denied knowing who'the previous owner
of the boat was but said it -may have been JOE -MEROLA.

Asked about -how he paid for the boat, MILTON said there

was an agreement for him-to work it out on trips. CHAPUT
said it is his recollection that the records of the Coast
Guard confirmed MEROLA's previous ownership of this boat.

CHAPUT said there were other instances where
MEROLA's name came up in connection with Cuban revolutionary
activities, the details of which he does not now recall.
He said he does not recall any specific allegation of gun
running on MEROLA's part but the circumstmces of his name
cropping up repeatedly caused him to be suspect.

lobby of the Auld-Hotel, Washington, Pa., where STUART SUTOR
stayed from the afternoon of October 26, 1958, to the morning
of October 28, 1958, because he encountered bad weather ~
conditions after leaving the Allegheny Walley Airport and was
forced to land at the Washington, Pa., airport.

It 1s recalled that a long distance telephone call
was made from JOE MEROLA's suite in the Warwick Hotel in
New York, New York, during September, 1958, person to-person,
to "MARTIN" at Duquesne, Pa., telephone number HObart 6-6205.
The subscriber to the Hobart number has been previously
identified as FRANK BENNETT MARTIN, aged 69, father of
WALLACE H. MARTIN, 804 crawford Street, Duquesne, Pa.

It is recalled that when interviewed by a Special
Agent of ‘the FBI in-March, 1959, FRANK BENNETT MARTIN stated
that he could not recall receiving a long distance telephone
call from New York City on September 21, 1958, but suggested
that the call may have been made to his son, WALLACE H, MARTIN,
aged 34, a business associate of WILLIAM DONOFRIO, proprietor
of a burglar alarm business, in McKeesport, Pa., known as
Silent Service.

The following investigation was conducted to-

determine the significance of the call from the Warwick Hotel

RE: STUART SUPOR

TGP; ITSP; FFA; NM; CONSPIRACY

On May 6, 1959, WALLACE H. MARTIN, 804 Crawford
Street, Duquesne, Pas was interviewed at his
‘place of employment, The Silent Service, a burgiar aiarm
concern lacated at 771 Clairton Boulevard, Pleasant Hills,
Pittsburgh, Pa.

At the beginning of the interview, MARTIN was
advised that he was not required to make any statements and
that any statements he might make could be used against him
in a court of law. He was told of his right to consult
with an attorney before. joining in an interview with a
Special Agent of the FBI, and acknowledged that he
understood his situation and wanted to proceed with the
interview.

MARTIN advised that he is a 34 year-old bachelor
and partner in the Silent Service Burglar alarm enterprise
but considers his partnership a "side line" to obtain money
to write motion picture seripts and popular songs. He
explained that he and his partner, WILLIAM DONOFRIO,
consider themselves to be promoters and that they spend a
great deal of time traveling throughout the Eastern. part of
the United States, particularly New York City.

A photograph of JOSEPH MEROLA of Miami, Florida,
was shown to MARTIN who immediately identified same as a
person he met through DONOFRIO at the Warwick Hotel in
New York City during the summer of 1958. MARTIN pointed
out that he could not be more specific regarding the date of
their meeting and stated that he could not recall the subject
of any conversation between DONOFRIO and MEROLA at the Warwick
Hotel.

NW 68486 Docld:32331964 Page 47


MARTIN stated that moreover he would prefer that |
DONOFRIO answered any questions regarding their conversations :
since MEROLA appeared to be a personal friend of DONOFRIO,.

MARTIN emphasized that he could not recall receiving
a@ long distance telephone call at his home on September 21,
1958, from the Warwick Hotel but added that if such a call
was made it was undoubtedly made with the purpose of contacting
DONOFRIO.

At this poi

in the interview. MARTIN stated that

he did not prefer to uss the matter rurther except in
DONOFRIO's presence. stated, however, that to the best of
his knowledge any contact between MEROLA and DONOFRIO would
definitely pertain to some legitimate business enterprise .

since DONOFRIO would not participate in any criminal undertaking.

MARTIN was also shown a photograph of STUART SUTOR
of Hialeah, Florida, but stated that he was not acquainted with
SUTOR and could furnish no information concerning him.

In conclusion, MARTIN stated that he had secured the
services of JAMES A, ASHTON, Attorney at Law, with offices
in Pittsburgh,Pa., who also represents DONOFRIO, and that he
would not discuss the matter further except in the presence
of his attorney.

‘RE: STUART SUTOR
nae TGP; ITSP; FFA; NM; CONSPIRACY

LOUIS ZEIDEN, 156 Clearview Street, Beaver Falls,
Pa., telephone TIlden 6-6645, was interviewed on May 2@,
1959, at his place of employment, Berkemans Clothing Store,
Beaver Falls, regarding the significance of a telephone call
to his-home on November 28, 1958, from the Ken Iron and
Steel Company, New Kensington, Pa.

At the outset ZEIDEN was advised that he did not
have to make any statements and that any statement he might
make could be used against him in a court of law. He was
also advised of his right to consult with an attorney and
indicated that he fully understood his position and would
proceed with the interview.

ZEIDEN advised that he could not account for any
call which might have been placed to his residence from the
Ken Iron and Steel Company or from anyone who might have
had access to that telephone. ZEIDEN pointed cut that on
November 28,1958, he worked all day im the store assisted
by his wife. He said that he was sure that the call
must have been billed to his telephone through an error on
the part of the telephone company personnel, and that if
such a call was placed to his home it must have been someone
calling a wrong number.

In the: presence of SA WALL, ZEIDEN telephonai his
