Dear Dick:

Thank you so much for your expression of confidence
in me which I assure you I will do all that is humanly possible
to justify.

A quick and casual glance suggests that you are being
deluged with administrative needs and decisions so monumental
that it is taking your valuable time away from the primary
Eunction of planning the investigations. May I suggest that
my first task be to use my organizational talents to review
completely the current situation and give you a full report
with suggestions as to how we might simplify and reduce the
start-up problems.

Have Carol give me a call if there is anything that
you wish me to do in the interim, but otherwise, I look forward
to seeing you on December 6.

With all best regards,

ABL,Jr.:gm

Former Lebanon County CESS ois attorney, Al Lewis, Jr., has
ae a top position in the ponacessionsll investigation of the
Kennedy-King assassinations, it was announced today. "The position
presents a tremendous challenge and opportunity to serve our country
with the hope that we might solve the many mysteries that remain in
these two murders," said Lewis. The former district attorney lost a
close and vigorous election to Robert Walker last spring in the race
x the Republican nomination to represent the sixteenth district of

Pennsylvania in the United States Congress.

Lewis will serve as an assistant to Chief Counsel Richard A.
Sprague of the "House Select Committee on Assassinations to reinvesti-
gate the murders of President John F. Kennedy and Reverend Martin
Luther King, Jr." Sprague is recognized as one of the outstanding

criminal investigators and prosecutors in the nation having served

as rst assistant district attorney in Philadelphia for many years.
Recently, he successfully concluded the prosecution of the Yablonski
mine-worker murders in Southwestern Pennsylvania. "I regard Sprague
as the finest criminal investigator in the country", said Lewis,

"and it will be an honor to serve with him in this vitally important
role." . To avoid any conflict of interest, Lewis indicated that he has
terminated his private law practice, and his former law firm, Lewis,

Brubaker and Christianson, will handle his pending cases. He will be-

gin work in Washington on December 6.

Lewis has a long and varied record in criminal investigation,

prosecution and the improvement of criminal justice techniques. He

three cabinet members, oné
‘already convicted.

The Governor's response
to the problem has been
threefold. He maintains,
with no evidence to the con-
trary, that he is in no way in-
volved with the wrongdoers.
Like the late Gov. George H.
Earle, he stays clean — and
like-Earle, his-Admini:

upset. In fact, in the midst of
dt all, Atty. Gen. Robert
“Kane announced a State le-
gal assistance program for
officials, which has some
merit but is incredibly ill-

. And, thirdly, the Gover-

Former Lebanon County Dist. Atty. Alvin B.
Lewis Jr. declaring himself “increasingly ap-
alled” with Gov. Milton J. Shapp’s approach to the
‘administration of justice in Pennsylvania, has re-
-signed as a member of the Southcentral Regional
Council of the Governor's Justice Commission

“Perhaps my resignation will impress upon you
ihe Totality of my revulsion with the path the sta
‘administration seems to be aveline” Lewis sar
in his letter of resignation Thursday to Sha]
Sea we ho Tarmerly was regional chal tan and
before that state chairman of the commission's
eight regional councils, told The Sunday -Patriot-
News his decision to quit, after serving eight years,
‘came toa head with the Shap Administration's fir.
ing on Wednesday of Walter M. Phillips Jr. as spe-
cial prosecutor of corruption in Philadelphia, along
with his first assistant, Ben Joseph.

The southcentral council covers Dauphin, Cum-
berland, York, Lebanon, Perry, Franklin, Lancaé-

id Adams counties. The commission, an out-
‘growth of the original state Crime Commission, is
Tesponsible for distributing federal funds under the
Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of
1968. Most of the grants go to local governmental
‘units to assist in upgrading police forces, the court
system, and prisons.

Reminding Shapp that they on occasion had dis-
cussed “'my belief that our system of justice is sim-
ply not working well,” Lewis wrote: “My frustra-
tions and distress have become more and more in-
tense with every passing month.

““Lcannot condone the firing of an independent
special prosecutor

which cracks down on the poor and middle class and
ignores the important and powerful."”

Ina telephone interview with Lewis, the news-
paper suggested that his letter appeared to allude to
Phillips’ assertion that one of the principal reasons
for his dismissal, ordered by State Atty. Gen. Rob-
ert P. Kane, was his effort to investigate several
| leading state legislators.

"No question about it; that's what I had in
mind,” Lewis'said.

Phillips has confirmed reports he had begun an
investigation of House Speaker Herbert Fineman,

then Wodjak and Senate Appropriations Committee

followed by the resignation of Atty. Gen. Elliott
Richardson. “The analogy is the same in Harris-
burg.”

Lewis’ letter continued:

“Governor, perhaps the reasons you appointed
meas chairman of the Southcentral Regional Coun-
cilof the Governor's Justice Commission were your
knowledge of my years of service as district attor-
ney of Lebanon County, my previous service as
chairman of regional crime commission during the
tenure of your predecessor, my past presidency of
the Pennsylvania District ‘Attorneys Association,
and my chairmanship of all the state regional coun-

The letter added:

Lewis told a reporter he sent copies to the four
legislative leaders particularly because the Legis-

paying the legal fees for state officials charged with
crimes while in office. Kane has defended the policy

Dear Dick:

Congratulations on your appointment by the congressional
investigative committee. It is a great opportunity and I know
that you will do an excellent job.

You may have heard that this spring I ran for Congress in
the Sixteenth District (Lancaster, Chester, Lebanon) of Pennsyl-
vania and came in.a close second in a field of eleven.* While ~
it was hard work, the effort was enjoyable. My problem is that
I am having trouble settling yback into the general practice of law:
forming corporations, writing wills, and trying personal injury
cases.

Thus, when I heard of your appointment, it occurred to me
that you might be searching for a top assistant with strong organ-
izational, investigative and trial experience. There is no doubt
that the position would be a tremendous challenge, and knowing
you as I do, I am sure we would work well together.

Enclosed is a brief portion of my resume' for your consider-
ation and, if you are interested, I would look forward to renewing
our friendship at any convenient time.

I would appreciate your keeping this inquiry extremely con-
fidential, for obvious reasons; you are the only one who knows
of it.

Best personal regards,

Sincerely,

ABL,Jr.:gm
