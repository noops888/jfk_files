Number of releases of previously postponed information: 14

Dear Dick:

Thank you so much for your expression of confidence

in me which I assure you I will do all that is humanly possible

to justify.

A quick and casual glance suggests that you are being

deluged with administrative needs and decisions so monumental

that it is taking your valuable time away from the primary

function of planning the investigations.

May I suggest that

my first task be to use my organizational talents to review

completely the current situation and give you a full report

with suggestions as to how we might simplify and reduce the

start-up problems.

Have Carol give me a call if there is anything that

you wish me to do in the interim, but otherwise, I look forward

to seeing you on December 6.

With all best regards,

B. Lewis, JI.

197E IMMEDIATE RELLASI

Contact: 833-1321

Former Lebanon County district attorney, Al Lewis, Jr., has

accepted a top position in the congressional investigation of the

Kennedy-King assassinations, it was announced today. "The position

presents a tremendous challenge and opportunity to serve our country

with the hope that we might solve the many mysteries that remain in

these two murders," said Lewis. The former district attorney lost a

close and vigorous election to Robert Walker last spring in the race

for the Republican nomination to represent the sixteenth district of

Pennsylvania in the United States Congress.

Lewis will serve as an assistant to Chief Counsel Richard A.

Sprague of the "House Select Committee on Assassinations to reinvesti-

gate the murders of President John F. Kennedy and Reverend Martin

Luther King, Jr." Sprague is recognized as one of the outstanding

criminal investigators

and prosecutors in the nation having served

as first assistant district attorney in Philadelphia for many years.

Recently, he successfully concluded the prosecution of the Yablonski

mine-worker murders in Southwestern Pennsylvania. "I regard Sprague

as the finest criminal investigator in the country", said Lewis,

"and it will be an honor to serve with him in this vitally important

role.".. To avoid any conflict of interest, Lewis indicated that he has

terminated his private law practice, and his former law firm, Lewis,

Brubaker and Christianson, will handle his pending cases.

He will be-

gin work in Washington on December 6.

Lewis has a long and varied record

in criminal investigation,

prosecution and the improvement of criminal justice techniques. He

Dear Dick:

Congratulations on your appointment by the congressional

investigative committee. It is a great opportunity and I know

that you will do an excellent job.

You may have heard that this spring I ran for Congress

the Sixteenth District (Lancaster, Chester, Lebanon) of Pennsyl-

and came in a close second in a field of eleven.: While.

it was hard work, the effort was enjoyable. My problem is that

I am having trouble settling back into the general practice of law:

forming corporations, writing wills, and trying personal injury

cases.

Thus, when I heard of your appointment, it occurred to me

that you might be

searching for a top assistant with strong organ-

izational, investigative and trial experience.

There is no doubt

that the position would be a tremendous challenge, and knowing

you as I do, I am sure we would work well together.

Enclosed is a brief portion of my resume' for your consider-

ation and, if you are interested, I would look forward to renewing

our friendship at any convenient time.

I would appreciate your keeping this inquiry extremely con-

fidential, for obvious reasons; you are the only one who knows

of it.

Best
