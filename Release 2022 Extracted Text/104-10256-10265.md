WATERGATE INCIDENT

BACKGROUND

Reference is made to the previous summary of 26 Jane 1972,:.
which provided details on the arrest of five men by the*
Washington Metropolitan Police, after having been discovered
breaking into the Democratic National Headquarters on

17 June 1972. The five primary figures included Messrs.
James Walter McCord, Jr., a former CIA Staff Employee
(1951-1970); Bernard L. Barker, a former Agency Asset
(1960-1966); Frank Anthony Sturgis, who has never been
employed by CIA; Eugenio Rolando Martinez Careaga, who
worked on an Agency project from 1961 to 1969, and has
since been on a $100, 00 a month retainer; and Virgilio Ramon
Gonzales-Rosabel, who has never had any ties with CIA,

EVENETTE HOWARD HUNT, JR.

Much of the publicity on the case has centered on Mr, Everette
Howard Hunt, Jx., a White House Consultant who formerly
served as a CIA Stafi Employee from 1949 to 1976. Mr. Hunt
was initially interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation

“in the evening of 17 June 1972, but he refused to discuss details
of-his-involvement-on_Constitutional grounds, Information has _
. now developed which indicates-that in 1960 he had a documented

alias in the name of Edward V. Hamilton; he used the name

Edward J. Hamilton in 1963; and in 1968-1970, he was seriously

considering the publication of a book under the name of Edward
J. Hamilton, Recent news articles indicate that Mr, Frank
Anthony Sturgis had registered at the Watergate and gave the
police the name of "Edward Hamilton" at the time of his arrest.
As of 27 June 1972, the Federal Bureau of Investigation gave -
indications that the whereabouts of Mr. Hunt is unknown, The.
Bureau is checking on Mr. Hunt's handwriting.
