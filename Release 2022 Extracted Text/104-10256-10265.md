WATERGATE INCIDENT

1. BACKGROUND

Reterence is made to the previous summary of 26 June 1972,

which provided details on the arrest of five men by the

Washington Metropoliian Police, after having been discovered

breaking into the Democratic National Headquarters on

17 June 1972. The five primary figures included Messrs.

James Walter McCord, JI., a former CIA Staff Employee

(1951-1970); Bernard L. Barker, a former Agency Asset

(1960-1966); Frank Anthony Sturgis, who has never been

employed by CIA; Eugenio Rolando Martinez Careaga, who

worked on an Agency project from 1961 to 1969, and has

since been on a $100. 00 a month retainer; and Virgilio Ramon

Gonzales-Rosabel, who has never had any ties with CIA.

2. EVERETTE HOWARD HUNT, JR.

Much of the publicity on the case has centered on Mr. Everette

Howard Hunt, Jx., a White House Consultant who formerly

served as a CIA Stafí Employee from 1949 to 1970. MI. Hunt

was initially interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation

in the evening of 17 June 1972, but he refused to discuss details

of his involvement on Constitutional grounds.. Information has

. now developed which indicates that in 1960 he had a documented

alias in the name of Edward V. Hamilton; he used the name

Edward J. Hamilton in 1963; and in 1968-1970, he was seriously

considering the publication of a book under the name of Edward

J. Hamilton. Recent news articles indicate that Mr. Frank

Anthony Sturgis had registered at the Watergate and gave the

police the name of "Edward Hamilton" at the time of his arrest.

As of 27 June 1972, the Federal Bureau of Investigation gave

indications that the whereabouts of MI. Hunt is unknown. The

Bureau is checking on MI. Hunt's handwriting.

the Central Cover Staff/DDP, since 1963. Office of

Security records reflect that MI. Naeher served as

an Agency Staff Employee from 1952 to 1969. A

Covert Security Approval was granted for his

operational, use on 18 December 1970.

interpretation of the bugging story. This matter was

referred to MI. John Unumb, Deputy Assistant to the

Mis. Bernard Le Barker

Mrs. Bernard L. Barker has been mentioned in the

press as the individual who initially called an attorney,

Michael Douglas Caddy, after the arrest of her husband

in connection with the Watergate incident. There has

been an increased focus of attention on him because of

his financial interests. Office of Security records now

reflect that Clara Elena Fernandez Collazo de Barker,

the wife of Bernard L. Barker, was granted a

provisional operational approval on 20 February 1961,

so that she might assist her husband on translation

work.

7. FINANCIAL SUPPORT

The Federal Bureau of Investigation has apparently traced

large sums of money to banking establishinents in Mesico

City, Mesico. Mr. Bernard L. Barker has been questioned

extensively on the funding aspects of the operation, and his

explanations on real estate deals are not being accepted as

the truth. As of 27 June 1972, the Federal Bureau of Investi-.

gation continued to show considerable interest in the financial

aspects of the Watergate incident.

MEDIA GRAPHIX

The Federal Bureau of Investigation expressed an interest

in Media Graphis, a Washington, D. C. firm with offices at
