On 3-29-61 JESUS MANZARBEITIA, treasurer of the dele

gation in Spain of the frente Revolucionario Democratico (FRD),

advised that his group had received information that subject

would probably be coming to Spain.

MANZARBEITIA said tht some

of the more hot-headed Cuban exiles in Madrid wanted to try to

intercept the subject at the airport here in order to administer

a severe physical beating to him. MANZARBEITIA said that he

personally felt that such action would draw unfavorable attention

to the Cuban exiles in Madrid from the Spanish Government, and

that he was doing everything possible to discourage such action.

MANZARBEITIA pointed out that the subject is a close friend of

wealthy Argentine named JORGE ANTONIO, Who resides in Hadrid

and who is a close associate of ex-President JUAN PERON OI

MANZARBEITIA said he is personally

friendly with ANTONIO and thought he could learn from him when

and if subject arrived in Madrid.

MANZARBEITIA indicated that

he is not averse to subject getting his "lumps"

but felt that

a more careful plan should be worked out. (SU

subject is staying at the Hotel Imperatriz in Madrid.

On 4-4-61 JESUS MANZARBEITIA advised that one of

his sources had reported to him that subject had been seen

at the Bodegon Restaurant in Madrid on 4-3-61 in the company

of JORGE ANTONIO.

From this it would appear that subject's

prescuice in diadria is definitely know to the cuisan exiles A)

On 4-10-61 Mr. TAlisON advised that for the noment

subject is being given protection by two members of the Directorate

General of Security (DGS) in Madrid.

He said that he had re-

ceived information on that date that the DGS was planning to

use a pretext in an effort to debrief the subject. (

On 4-11-61 JESUS MANZARBEITIA and JOSE M. CABEZON,

who heads the delegation in Spain of the FRD, called at the

Madrid Office and supplied the following information

Approximately a month ago CABEZON, through a Spanish

newspaperman to whom he had given an interview concerning

ERD activities in Spain, became acquainted with AUGUSTIN PARRADAS

SICILIA, and at that time CABIZON was told that although

PARRADAS is ostensibly a newspaperman, he is actually a secret

agent

for a Spanish Government organization, not otherwise sp

identified.

(As has been previously reported to the Bureau

under the caption AUGUSTIN PARRADAS SICILIA, aka; IS - CUBA

8 SPAIN, PARRADAS apparently is employed in something of an

informant capacity with the Information Section of the Spanish

High General Staff.) CABEZON said that PARRADAS indicated an

interest in introducing CABIZON to his superiors, but that

this was never done.

MANZARBEITIA advised that he had been approached by

an Inspector PRADAS of the Directorate General of Security in

Madrid, with which individual they maintain contact as repre-

sentatives of the FRD here, to arrange an interview with the

subject for the purpose of obtaining any information which the

subject might be willing to volunteer. MANZARBEITIA pointed

out that Inspector PRADAS is in charge of the investigation

of Cuban matters in Madrid and is most helpful to them;

accordingly he agreed to talk to PARDo LlADA and through JORGE 1)/U)

MANZARBEITIA said that they expected to be furnished a copy

of the questions and answers on 4-12-61, and that they would

furnish a copy of the same to the Madrid Office thereafter.

*(4)

On 4-11-61 MANZARBEITIA and CABEZON made available

a copy of the first report of PARRADAS, which he had supplied

to them.

The contents of this report have been incorporated

into a letterhead memorandum, 12 copies of which are turnishec

for the Bureau together with 12 copies of an evaluatior

memorandun.

The confidential source abroad mentioned in the

letterhead memorandum is MANZARBEITIA, and the memorandum has

been classified confidential since both MANZARBEITIA and

CABEZON are furnishing intornation of Bureau interest on a

continuing basis to the Madrid Oftice. C

• Palma de Mallorca, Balearic Islands, Spain, on the afternoon

of 4-11-61. This

is a resort area.

From the above it appears rather obvious that the

interview of subject on 4-10-61 by MANZARBEITIA and GABINO

DELGADO had been the pretext interview mentioned above by

Inasmuch as this is primarily a matter coming within

CIA jurisdiction and inasmuch as Mr. WILLIAMSON had been keeping >

the Madrid Office currently advised of all his activities in

an effort to debrief the subject, on 4-11-61 he was furnished

orally with full information concerning all the interviews of

the subject that were going on and the apparent conflict of

interest between the Directorate General of Security on the

one hand and the High General Staff, represented by PARRADAS,

on the other hand. At the same time he was furnished with a

copy of the report prepared by PARRADAS which contained the re-

suits of his interview of the subject on 4-7-61.

stated that he would furnish a copy of this' report to WILLIAMSON S

On 4-12-01 Mr. WILLIAMSON furnished a copys

with the report prepared by PARRADAS.

(MANZARBEITIA had advised

on 4-11-61 that they planned to give Inspector PRADAS Of the

DGS a COpY OL PARRADAS' report.

He said that this report

esentially contained all the information which had been furnished

to him, MANZARBEITIA, by the subject, and he planned to tell

Inspector PRADAS that he could supply no additional information.

It was subsequently learned on 4-12-61 from MANZARBEITIA that

He claims to be an

enemy of Communism but at the same time he backs almost

all the measures adopted by the CASTRO government.

He

tries to justify the system and made various allusions

to the lack of capacity of persons in responsible

positions in Cuba and placed the blame on them for

the present chaotic situation in Cuba.

He does not

describe IDEL CASTRO nor the members of his government

as Communists although he recognizes that all of them

are dominated and under the control of members of the

Communist Party. He claimed that REGINO BOTI, Minister

of Economy, RAUL CEPERO BONILLA, Director of the National

Bank and ex-Minister of Commerce, and LUIS BUCH, Minister

of the Presidency, are all anti-Communists.

were completely ignorant about everything concerning

his journey.

This latter would appear doubtful inasmuch

as JORGE ANTONIO went to the airport to meet the subject,

to cover up the arrival in Madrid of the subject. It was

From infornation obtained from subject, it

would appear that with regard to the aid which the govern-

ment of CASTRO gives to Spanish Communists, perhaps the

most important is that of furnishing Cuban passports to

those who lack documentation.
