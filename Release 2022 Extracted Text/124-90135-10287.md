He indicated that subject had traveled from Mex, to Europe
via Canada on the KiM Airlines. Mr. fiintirauson|@dvisea that
subject is staying at the Hotel Emperatriz in Madrid. a

On 4-4-61 JESUS MANZARBEITIA advised that one of
a his sources had reported to him that subject had been seen
at the Bodegon Restaurant in Madrid on 4-3-61 in the company
of JORGE ANTONIO. From this it would appear that subject's |
presence in Madrid is definitely known to the Cuban exiles. 4)

On 4-10-61 Mr. (uuu raKson 2Qwisea that for the moment
subject is being given protection by two members of the Directorate
General of Security (DGS) in Madrid. He said that he had re-~
ceived information on that date that the DGS was planning to
use a pretext in an effort to debrief the subject. i

On 4-11-61 JESUS MANZARBEITIA and JOSE M. CABEZON,
who heads the delegation in Spain of the FRD, called at the
Madrid Office and supplied the following information,
fe Approximately. a month ago CABEZON, through a Spanish
-."newspaperman to whom he had given an interview concerning,

FAD activities in Spain, became acquainted with AUGUSTIN{PARRADAS,
ICILIA, and at that time CABEZON was told that although‘

* PARRADAS..is ostensibly a newspaperman, he is actually a secret ,
agent for a Spanish Government organization, not otherwise S Phony
, identified. (AS has been previously reported to the Bureau ——-—.

under the caption AUGUSTIN PARRADAS SICILIA, aka; IS - CUBA

& SPAIN, PARRADAS apparently is employed in something of an
informant capacity with the Information Section of the Spanish
High General Staff.) CABEZON said that PARRADAS indicated an
interest in introducing, CABEZON to his superiors, but that
this was never done. u)

MANZARBEITIA advised that he had been approached by
an Inspector PRADAS of the Directorate General of Security in
Madrid, with which individual they maintain contact as repre-
sentatives of the FRD here, to arrange an interview with the
subject for the purpose of obtaining any information which the
subject might be willing to volunteer. MANZARBEITIA pointed
out that Inspector PRADAS is in charge of the investigation
of Cuban matters in Madrid and is most helpful to them; i
accordingly he agreed to talk to PARDO LLADA and through soacx/¥)(U)

MANZARBEITIA said that they expected to be furnished a copy .
of the questions and answers on 4-12-61, and that they were Ou)

furnish a copy of the same to the Madrid Office thereafter.

On 4-11-61 MANZARBEITIA and CABEZON made available
a copy of the first report of PARRADAS, which he had supplied
to them. The contents of this report have been incorporated
into a letterhead memorandum, 12 copies of which are furnished
‘ for the Bureau together with 12 copies of an evaluation
memorandum, The confidential source abroad mentioned in the
letterhead memorandum is MANZARBEITIA, and the memorandum has
peen classified. confidential since both MANZARBEITIA and
CABEZON are furnishing information of Buregu interest on a
continuing basis to the Madrid Office. A a) . :

» Palma de Mallorca, Balearic Islands, Spain, on the afternoon
of 4-11-61. This is a resort area. u)

interview of subject on 4-10-61 by MANZARBEITIA and GABINO
DELGADO had been the pretext interview mentioned above by
Mr. {WILLIAMSO oR 4-10-61. ‘

Inasmuch as this is primarily a matter coming within

the Madrid Office currently advised of all his activities in
an effort to debrief the subject, on 4-11-61 he was furnished
orally with full information concerning all the interviews of
the subject that were going on and the apparent conflict of
interest between the Directorate General of Security on the
one hand and the High General Staff, represented by PARRADAS,
on the other hand. At the same time he was furnished with a
copy of the report prepared by PARRADAS which contained the re-.
sults of his interview of the subject on 4-7-61. sr. faruttauson =)

those who lack doc tation. The subject considers that
