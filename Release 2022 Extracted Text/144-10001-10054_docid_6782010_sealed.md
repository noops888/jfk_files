Reference my telex Nr. 561 ((A).) .

I should add that succession to, the presidence falls to the

Presidency of the Senate and Senator from Texas, Vice President

LYNDON JOHNSON, who will be in office until 20 Japuary 1965.

After the latter, it would fall to the, Representative from

Massachusetts and Speaker of the House of Representatives

MACCORMACK.

. *

The press today reported that Attorney General ROBERT KENNEDY,

brother of the late. President, was

•in the process of leaving the

post to participate actively in his brother's presidential cam-

paign. In diplomatic circles it is believed that; in the absence

of other Democratic figures of the first rank who could aspire to

the presidency in the November 1964 election, the present Attorney

General becomes, with the death of President KENNEDY, the first

choice to succeed him for the presidential term which will begin

in January 1965.

News has just arrived that at 1438 (Easterh time) LYNDON

JOHNSON took the oath of office as President oE:the United States

before a federal district judge.
