1956 he waa promoted to Second Secretary and Chef af the Cocmular Becton, Soviet
Sebasay. Froa information civen ty several wources, we hare compiled the follocing
Gescription af COLUR and some background data.

2. He was torn about 1925 in the environs ef either Otyasa or Kharkov. Be
Proodly asserted that he was a Ukrainian, During World Ver IT he was a eoloue) in
the Soviet Army, saw action in Leningrad and Moscow and sae wounded six tines, Ue
elainnd to be @ child pechologiat. Altho:igh be looked like « product of peasant
stock, his converextion implied that he was well-educated and knowledgeabls on
eiplomatic affairs, Nerxias and current events which involve the USSR, Contrarily,
his knowledge of life cutaide the USSR was meager. Me was married to Mina Fedorovna.
Rather sorroxfully be explained that he and his wife would lite to have ehildrea bat
so far have not been oo blesood. His main interest in morte vas skiing, He wae very
Jovial, congenial snd peened to enjoy playing host. It has boen very obvious that he
always picke up the check xhen he dines with Mesterners = evea if he is not the host,

gor 472 om source COLIB stated he had served in Vienna, Varsex, Butepest,
Suebarest and Sophias while to another he stated that Helsinki was his first foreign
arsignment. It 18 possible that "UB meant Holainti vas hie *firet foreign seciga-
mant® cutaide tho Soviet Bloo (if bo hed eerved in Vierma during the occupation), or
be could have been deliberately attempting to confuse, He has conversed ohly in
Rersian-and Finnishy however, he stated that he hed attended the Lancuage Institate,
We mapect that be also knows sore English but may feel reluctant to converes in
Moglish.

a QOUB's predecessor was @ known RIS officer, Probably HUB, We suspect that
COLER i now the top KDB officer in Helsinki. Although ve have no cancrete evidence
for this suspicion, we feel thet COLUB's interest in Westeroers generally end in
particularly in his opposite numbers in Western instal?ations in Heleinkt is more then
vould bo called for by his position. .

5. BS 207k, when shows « newspaper photo of OOUUD, stated that GOLUB'S Pros was
fecilier, When DS 207h wes told GOUM's nase, Source replied that there wae a lied.
