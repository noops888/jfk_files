PERSONAL HISTORY AND BACKGROUND
EMPLOYMENT ;

ATTORNEY AT LAW PRACTICE

On March 27, 1958, CECIL HOWE, Building Manager for
the California Bank Building, 9441 Wilshire Boulevard, Los
Angeles, advised SA CHARLES E, STINE (A) that FRANK DESIMONE
was a tenant in Room 436 from Jurie, 1953, until sometime
in the early part of 1954. He said that another attorney
named JOHN WALSH shared an office with him. WALSH is
presently in Room 412 of this building, according to
HOWE. HOWE advised that if the exact dates of his tenancy
ever become an issue, he would recommend: contact with the
Beverly Sign Company which placed the subject's name on the
door and also removed it when he vacated this office. HOWE
said he had little contact with the subject and believed he
later had desk space in the law firm of Cantillon and
Cantillon, which is also in the same building.

On March 27, 1958, T-1 advised that DESIMONE
is associated with the Cantillon law firm only insofar as
the Los Angeles County Supreme Court case of GEORGIANA vs. FISHER
is concerned. T-1 said that this is a civil suit and has not
been pressed because DESIMONE has not been in touch with the
firm and his whereabouts are not known to any persons
connected with this firm, T-1 advised that the subject is
known to the CANTILLONS, who are the attorneys for the
Tropicana Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. T-1 said that JOHN
ROSELLI is also a client of this firm and believes he was
introduced to the firm by DESIMONE. T-1 said that among
the CANTILLON clients is ANTHONY. MOSCIOTRA, 4115 Vally Vista
_ Courts, Sherman Oaks, California. He is the manager of the
.Silver Fox, a tavern located in San Fernando Valley and
actually owned by a family named PUCCI. T-1 said that
RICHARD .CANTILLON and MOSCIOTRA had a conversation in which
the fact that the subject's whereabouts were unknown was a point
of discussion. T-1l said it appeared apparent that neither knew
where the subject might be, but it was also apparent that
they were concerned about him.

T-l has also advised that within a few days following
the notoriety given the subject in the local press, RICHARD

Docld:32316427 Page 7


LA 92-107

CANTILLON learned that a "Life" Magazine reporter had telephonically
contacted the CANTILLON office and had engaged one of the

clerical employees in conversation concerning the subject.
According to T-1, it was apparent that CANTILLON was concerned

that there would be publicity in which the subject's

connection with the firm would become known. T-1 said that

the subject was never a member of the firm and recently

all calls for the subject have been referred to G, VERNON
BRUMBAUGH, 139 North Broadway, Los Angeles. T-1 said that
DESIMONE was. never a member of the CANTILLON law firm.

On March 31, 1958, G. VERNON BRUMBAUGH advised
SA STINE that he still had no idea of the subject's whereabouts.

EJECT-O-LETTE MANUFACTURING COMPANY

On March 7, 1958, W. D. HIGGINSON, United States
Corporation Company, 210 West Seventh Street, Los Angeles,
advised that at the request of the subject he had filed the
necessary legal documents with the California Department of
Corporations for this firm. He said that this business, to
his recollection, was a machine shop located somewhere in the
vicinity of: Central Los Angeles. He said all names of persons
listed as original stockholders were employees of the United
States Corporation Company.

(It will be recalled that the United States Corporation
Company specializes in forming corporations under the laws of
the State of California and other states for a fee, They
act on instructions of attorneys, and according to HIGGINSON,
perform the function of a specialized law clerk insofar as
the filing of proper documents with the states are concerned. )

HIGGINSON said that he has a vague recollection
of the fact that this firm may not actually have begun
operations and does not believe it is presently active. He
said he cannot recall the exact circumstances for the formation
of this particular company, but believes the only work he
did in connection therewith was the result of a short
telephone call from the subject. He said he does not know
who may have been associated with the subject in this
venture,

NEIGHBORHOOD AMUSEMENT CLUB

HIGGINSON stated that on November 27, 1939, the
subject requested him to file Articles of Incorporation with
the State of California for this non-profit corporation,

He furnished a carbon copy of the Articles of Incorporation
for inspection. This copy did not indicate who the officers
or stockholders were, nor was the address shown. The only
names shown were LOUIS BONO; J, DiGREGORIO, and DOMINIC
SALO. There was no further identification of these persons
and they were referred to as “incorporators"., Among the
purposes for the club there was set forth that for the
benefit of members pool, billiard, and snooker tables would
be provided. HIGGINSON stated that he did not know where
this club was located.

CUCAMONGA WINERY

On March 31, 1958, HIGGINSON advised that on
searching through old records he had found misfiled a
record to the effect that at the request of the subject, he
had caused to be filed with the State of California Articles
of Incorporation for this firm. He said the date May 15,
1939, appeared in his records in connection with this firm.
He advised that there were no other references in his records
to this company and did not know whether or not the subject
was an officer, stockholder, or merely attorney for the firm.
He said he did not know whether this was still in business.

Close Relatives
ROSALIA DESIMONE ~ Mother

On March 14, 1958, CHESTER PERKINS, Investigator,
Immigration and Naturalization Service, Los Angeles, advised
SAA STINE that the files of that agency include alien regis-
tration forms completed by ROSALIE CORDA DESIMONE bearing
number A-494102 dated January 10, 1951; January 21, 1957;
and January 12, 1958. She also registered as an alien
on December 12, 1940. On this early registration form she
listed her place of birth as Lucca Sicila, a provinse of
Gergenti, Italy. The form indicated that she entered the
United States under her maiden name at New York City on July
30, 1907.

Mr. PERKINS pointed out that the Immigration and
Naturalization Service investigation at Pueblo, Colorado,
developed that the records of the Mt. Carmel Catholic Church
at Pueblo included a record of a marriage on December 23,
1906, of ROSARIO DESIMONE and ROSALIA CORDO.

PERKINS pointed out that in the 1951, 1957, and
1958 alien registration forms completed by Mrs. DESIMONE
she’ consistently represented that she entered the United
States in July, 1907, at New York City. The name of the
steamship was listed as "unknown." She listed her relatives
in Italy as MAICH CORDA; however, the degree of relationship
was not shown. She listed all of her children, which included
LEON who resided at 3831 Hepburn; FRANK, JOSEPH, and
ROSALIE, 1028 North Paramount, Downey, California, the family
residence; JOSEPHINE SHASHA, 3522 Carmelete, Maywood; and
TONINA LORIA, 195 Alhambra, San Francisco, California.

T-2 on March 7, 1958, advised that the account of
ROSALIA DESIMONE at the Security-First National Bank, Downey,
California, was increased by $226.35 in a deposit made
March 4, 1958. This amount represented a check drawn on the
U. S. National Bank, San Diego, California, El Cajon Branch,
The balance as of March 7, 1958, was $12,531.17.

Street, advised that she had been in frequent touch with

ROSALIE DESIMONE on a neighborly basis, but the subject of 1
FRANK's whereabouts and condition has never arisen. She

said it is evident from the fact that ROSALIE continues to
park her car in the HAURET garage that the subject's car is
still on the DESIMONE premises. She said that in the event
the subject's whereabouts. become known to her she wiil
immediately inform this office. She advised that she has the
impression from her contacts with ROSALIE that the family
continues to be concerned about the subject's failure to
contact them,

, On April 4, 1958, Mrs. RICHARD POWELL, 7833 Comolette,
Downey, California, advised that she has observed that the
DESIMONE family wash does not include male attire, and for

this reason she believes the subject is not at home. She \
said when the subject is home the DESIMONE wash line, which \
is visible from the POWELL residence, includes many white

shirts and other items which she assumes only the subject

would wear inasmuch as he is: the only male known to be living

at those premises. She said she has not been.in recent

contact with the subject's family but would attempt to see

them and,if possible,determine the subject's whereabouts and

immediately inform this office.

c On April 4, 1958, it was ascertained that the
residence at 7032 Adoree Street, Downey, California, is
occupied by THEODORE WORMLEY who is employed by the Union
Oil Company at 17103 South Central Avenue, Compton, California.
This information was obtainsd on March 28, 1958, by IC JOHN

Bureau is evidently looking for the subject in order to serve

a subpoena. 1-5 said it has not been possible to engage the i
subject's mother in an extended conversation about him. T-5 \
stated that Mrs. DESIMONE does not respond to questions concerning

her son, except to state generally that she would rest easier
if she knew where and how he is.

T-3 , on March 25, 1958, advised that the only
entries against the subject's "clients account" and his
regular checking account were bank charges of less than
$1 on each account, therefore, the balances have not been
materially changed.

U. S&S National Bank
Main Office
San Diego, California

On March 14, 1958, the San Diego Office reported
that on March 3, 1958, a payment was made on the subject's
loan account at this bank by a person who was identified by
the bank officer receiving the payment as SAM BOMPENSIERO.
The payment was in cash.

In connection with this loan, the San Diego Office
on the same date advised that on February 28, 1958, Mr.
ROBERT P, DRYDEN, Loan Officer, U. S. National Bank, El Cajon
Boulevard Branch, San Diego, California, informed SA's
FRANK V. SULLIVAN and WILLIAM W. LeBAR that FRANK DESIMONE
had obtained a $2000 loan from that bank on September 6, 1955,
co-signed by WILLIAM R. LIPIN. Payments were made as agreed
and the loan paid. off in ivs entirety.

On November 20, 1956, a similar loan requested by
LIPIN was made to DESIMONE in the amount of $2000, which also
was, paid off,

On May 8, 1957, 2 loan of $6300 was made again to
DESIMONE, requested by LIPIN, a very close personal friend of
DESIMONE, the funds to assist DESIMONE to buy a new business
(type’not stated). This new business allegedly would not
interfere with DESIMONE's law practice. The note was
guaranteed by LIPIN. Monthly payments were to be made in
the amount of $525.

LA 92-107

Payments were made regularly on this loan until
about Decemter, 1957, payments having been made in cash. Mr.
DRYDEN recalled that some individual other than DESIMONE,
Italian appearing, frequently made these payments, When
DESIMONE fell behind in his payment schedule, the bank wrote
letters to him at his given address, 7838 Adoree, ‘Downey,
California. Such letters were dated December 18, 1957;
January 23, 1958; and February 11, 1958. The last letter
was sent by registered mail with the request that it be
Gelivered to the addressee only and a return receipt card was
requested to show the address to which it was delivered.
To-date no reply has been :-eceived, but Mr. LIPIN had made
one of the payments. The bank contacted Mr. LIPIN on
- February 18, 1958, at which time Mr. LIPIN stated he. believed
DESIMONE, who supposedly had been in a hospital, was back

in the Los Angeles area. Another payment was due as of
March 3, 1968. Mr. YDEN stated that he would advise this
office of any information received as to DESIMONE or his
payments. . i.

Relative to WILLIAM R, LIPIN, Mr. DRYDEN confidentialiy
informed that he is a brother of LEWIS LIPTON and BERNARD
LEIPINSKY, both San Diego businessmen, WILLIAM R. LIPIN and
BERNARD LIPLNSKY are partners in a business known as B & B
| Enterprises, which operates coin machines such as stamp,
| cigarette, and candy machines, at military bases in the area.
| Their deposits at that bank total $161,305.33. WILLIAM R.
LIPIN is one of the largest stockholders in the U. S. National
| Bank outside of the "actual owners" He is. associated also

been his lawyer and because of all the help given him by

the subject, the loan payment was being made for him.

DRYDEN said he wes unable to state whether or not the payment
was being made by the unknown person out. of his own pocket.

DRYDEN noted that this person was driving a 1956
Oldsmobile bearing California license LPF 919. The San
Diego Office ascertained that this automobile was registered
to FRANK or SUSANNE MARINO, 4007 Hope Street, San Diego.

The San Diego Office files reflect FRANK MARINO, Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Number 1651123, is a bartender
for the Spot Cafe operated by SAM BOMPENSIERO and the latter
frequently uses MARINO's automobile.

Photographs.of several individuals of Italian
descent were shown to DRYDEN and to tellers RICHARD MOORS
and RICHARD CARSON, who had received payments on the subject's
loan previously. DRYDEN and MOORS identified the photograph
of SALVATORE (SAM) BOMPENSIERO as the person making the
payment. on March 3, 1958. CARSON recognized only the
photograph of DESIMONE, who had made payments previously on
other loans.

New York. He stated that SCOZZARI had never appeared before
this Grand Jury because he was in a hospital at Los Angeles
for a tumor operation.

BRUMBAUGH mentioned to him on the telephone that DESIMONE

JAMES PLUMERI, with alias,
JIMMY DOYLE

Inclusion of PLUMERI as a possible associate of the

occupied by the subject and SIMONE SCOZZARI at the Hotel New Yorker

on November 13, 1957. As reported earlier, a call was made
on November 13, 1957, from this suite to OR 5-6492, The
subscriber of this telephone is ELVIRA GARGUILO, and she
resides at Apartment 3B, 156 West 20th Street, New York City.

The New York Office supplied the foregoing
information in regard to PLUMERI and GARGUILO on March 18,
1958, and also reported at the same time that according to
the records of T-6 another Government agency investigating
hoodlum activities, JAMES PLUMERI, a top hoodlum of the New
York Office, had a girl friend, DIANA ROSE, who operated the
Diana Rose Sportswear Company, 106th Street and Third Avenue,
New York City. According to those records, ROSE was also
known as VERA, VICK, VICKIE DALE, YOLANDE GARGUILO, and
ROSE CAUTERO. Those records reflected that her business

.was financed by PLUMERI and that he periodically lived with

her in a penthouse located somewhere on Park Avenue in New
York City. Those records reflected that PLUMERI was using
her telephone number for certain contacts with his criminal
associates.

New York City Office files reflect that on
February 6, 1948, YOLANDA GARGUILO was arrested by Bureau
agents at’ New York City in a Theft From Interstate Shipment
case and the complaint. against her was dismissed on
November 10, 1948. YOLANDA GARGUILO has FBI Number 5051782.

WILLIAM RICHARD LIPIN

On March 21, 1958, the San Diego Office advised that
the city directories for the year 1942 disclose that W. R. LIPIN
“resided at 3454 Olive Avenue at that time. This was the address
shown by the subject in his application for employment at the
Solar Aircraft Company.

ROBERT DRYDEN on February 28, 1958, advised SA's FRANK V,
SULLIVAN and WILLIAM W. LeBAR that LIPIN is one of the
largest stockholders in the U. S. National Bank and a partner
with his brother, ‘BERNARD LIPINSKY in the B & B Enterprises,
which operates coin machines such as stamp, cigarette, and
| candy machines on military bases in the San Diego area. Their
deposits at the bank total in excess. of $160,000, LIPIN is
also associated with the Northpark Mortgage Company, 2896
| Wightman, San Diego, California.

The San Diego Office, on March 14, 1958, advised
that on February 28, 1958, WILLIAM RICHARD LIPIN, 49-1 Yerba
_ Santa Drive, San Diego 15, California, telephone JU 3-2200,
was interviewed at his residence by SA's FRANK V.. SULLIVAN and
WILLIAM W. LeBAR, This residence is in a quite exclusive ,
neighborhood and gives the appearance of being a very expensive
home, probably valued at $100,000 or more, with an elaborate
| lawn sprinkling system and, according to information received
from T-8, there is a very elaborate telephone system installed
in this residence - one which greatly impressed some of the
telephone installers.

Mr; LIPIN related that he is "very, very close" to
FRANK DESIMONE, having known him since about 1927 when the two
were attending Southern California University at Los Angeles,
California. During that time the two helped support themselves
by selling oranges by the crate. He knows the DESIMONE family
well and refers to them by their first names. He stated that
he always calls Dr. LEON DESIMONE as "Cousin LEON" and refers
to ROSALIE DESIMONE, subject's unmarried sister, as "Baby".

LIPIN related that one incident that endeared him
to the DESIMONE family was the securing of a loan of some $100
by subject from one of his uncles who was a barber in ‘Downey,
California, in the early 1930's for LIPIN. LIPIN had needed this
money ‘to help his brother, LEWIS LIPTON, the latter having been

. practically ostracized by the family because of his marriage

to a "non-Jewish" girl, LIPIN had gone to a wealthy uncle of
his in the Los Angeles area to secure this loan and when he
learned that it was to go to LIPTON, he refused to make the
loan. When DESIMONE heard about it, he secured the loan
voluntarily from an uncle of his who was in the most modest
financial circumstances, LIPIN cited this to show the type of
association he has had with subject.

Over the period of intervening years he has had
frequent contact with subject; because of divergent interests,
however, which resulted partly from the fact that LIPIN became a
married man with a family and DESIMONE has always remained
single, he has not been out socially with subject since about
1941 or 1942, .

During the early World War II years, LIPIN accompanied
subject on a trip to Washington in an attempt by subject to
secure a commission in the Army. This failed because of subject's
poor eyesight. It was then that LIPIN's brother, LEW LIPTON,

“who was on the Selective Service Board, suggested that subject

enlist. This he did and served some time in the Army. Since
subject's discharge, according to LIPIN, he has been a changed
man and seems to have lost his "spirit". He has been very
uncommunicative as to his personal affairs, having always been

a rather unusual individual. Of late years he has remarked that
his law practice has not been too good and he has wondered why
he remains in the practice.

. 25 -

LA 92-107

LIPIN volunteered that he has been guarantor on several
loans in the past few years which have all been paid off except
the last in an amount of some $3,000 to $5,000. On the last
loan subject has not made payments in the last few months and
the bank, El Cajon Boulevard Branch, U. S. National Bank, has
contacted LIPIN about the loan and LIPIN has made at least one
of the payments. He informed that DESIMONE has never given a
reason why he wanted the money and LIPIN, knowing subject's
personality, has never inquired. He has never hesitated to make
the loans because of his very close friendship, "almost like a
brother", and would make other loans to him or be co-signer
for such notes, if DESIMONE so requested, and with no questions
asked. LIPIN remarked that he has noticed, however, that in
spite of subject's comments about his meager law practice and
his occasional need of loans, he always has driven a relatively
new Cadillac automobile and "smokes long, black cigars".

LIPIN denied that he has had any contact whatsoever
with DESIMONE in the past few months or that he knows of his
whereabouts. He related that on about February 5, 1958, he

hed been in Los Angeles on business, taking a realtor's examination,

and he happened to see "Cousin LEON" on the street. LIPIN
inquired about subject and was told that LEON did not know
subject's whereabouts. LEON added, "You know FRANKIE. He goes
and comes and just doesn't communicate with his family".

LIPIN stated that about the middle of February he was
told by an individual whose identity he would not disclose, that
subject had recently tried to call LIPIN, but since LIPIN had
moved, subject was unable to reach him. LIPIN assumed that from
that conversation DESIMONE had been in San Diego, but that
was purely an assumption. He promised to contact that source
and attempt to obtain additional information concerning subject's
whereabouts and the telephone call at that particular time.

“(LIPIN telephonically advised on March 3, 1958, that he still

Nw 68262

was unable to disclose the identity of the aforementioned

source, but that he had contacted that source and learned that
the source had, in about the middle of February, received a
telephone call from DESIMONE in which he had said that he had
attempted to. call LIPIN, but without success. It is noted that
LIPIN has recently moved into a new home and into a new

business address. However, should subject have made a determined
effort to contact LIPIN, he certainly should have succeeded.
LIPIN advised that this source would not disclose whether the
telephone call from DESIMONE was from a local or long distance

-~ 26 -

LA 92-107

telephone call, and he could furnish no additional information
as to DESIMONE's whereabouts. )

LIPIN on February 28, 1958, continued that he knows
of no close associates of DESIMONE either in Los Angeles or
San Diego, or other areas. He described most of subject's
associates as being of Italian extraction. About 15 or so years |
ago DESIMONE introduced LIPIN to the late GIRALOMO "MOMO" ADAMO
and LIPIN always considered "MOMO" as a good friend because of
his having been introduced by DESIMONE, Also DESIMONE has been
related in law practice with an attorney by the name of C. H.

AUGUSTINE in San Diego. He believes also that DESIMONE, in
the past, has been invited to: join the _law firm of PROCOPIO,
PRICE, CORY & SCHWARTZ.

7 As to subject's personal habits, LIPIN informed that
DESIMONE considers himself a connoisseur of food and drink and
will spend several hours at a meal at a good restaurant. He has
no known hobbies; no serious girl friends, although he is much
interested in "women"; is not interested in sports or television;
is even-tempered and not inclined to violence; is a light
drinker of alcoholic beverages. He has known subject to
travel primarily in his personal automobile, which was last
known to have been a Cadillac, license and identifying data
unknown.

LIPIN informed that subject is known, although not
intimately, by his brother, LEWIS LIPTON

LIPIN openly stated that if he learns of DESIMONE's
whereabouts, he will tell the subject that the FBI is interested
in locating him and suggest that DESIMONE contact the FBI.

He stated further that he will attempt.to locate DESIMONE for

this purpose, but that he "probably would not" furnish information
to this office as to DESIMONE's whereabouts without first

talking to subject. He stated he was certain that if DESIMONE

is hiding out, it is only to "protect someone".

On March 3, 1958, WILLIAM RICHARD LIPIN telephonically
contacted SA WILLIAM W. LeBAR and informed that he has reconsidered
.the matter and will notify this office of any pertinent informa-
tion as to the whereabouts of DESIMONE; however, he could not \
disclose his source which told him that subject had tried to
contact him earlier in February.

LEWIS LIPTON

The San Diego Office, on March 14, 1958, advised that
on March 3, 1958, Mr. LEWIS LIPTON, 5018 Marlborough, San
Diego, California, was interviewed at his place of business,
LEW LIPTON's Savoy, 1065 Fourth Avenue, San Diego, by
SA T. HYRUM CALLISTER and SA WILLIAM W. LeBAR. LIPTON informed
that he has known DESIMONE for 20 or more years, having met him
through his brother, BILL LIPIN, who had.gone to school with
the subject. He stated that he does not know subject in a
social way, having never gone out with him socially. He knows
subject to be an avid horse race fan and "wouldn't miss a race
for anything". He stated that he has not seen nor heard of
subject for months, but that he will advise this office of
information coming to his attention regarding subject.

LIPTON informed further that DESIMONE had been
attorney for the deceased "MOMO" ADAMO, whose wife has since,
remarried and lives in San Diego. The former Mrs. ADAMO
reportedly married someone who is not Italian, now employed at
Convair, and as a result she may be "antagonistic" toward the
Italian element of San Diego.. Her name might be determined from
MEL WILSON, U. S. National Bank. He advised that he believes
subject was also attorney for TONY MIRABILE and PAUL MIRABILE,
(TONY MIRABILE 1s a San Diego local hoodlum on whom reports
have been forwarded and PAUL MIRABILE is a well known brother
of his.) He believes that if DESIMONE came to San Diego,

SAM BOMPENSIERO will be certain to know of it.

LIPTON informed that DESIMONE is peculiar in his
eating habits and at times particular. He stated that a couple
of years ago he remarked that he could not find a good meal
in San Diego and was going to the Bernardo Winery (operated by
VINCENT RIZZO, méntioned previously in this investigation)

* for a meal. LIPTON added that other Italians in the past have

|| NW 68262

been known to go to that winery occasionally for meals.

LIPTON stated that DESIMONE is an unusual individual
and his close associates other than mentioned above are not
known. When DESIMONE was last seen by LIPTON, some months ago,
he told LIPTON during his conversation that’ he thought his
office had been "bugged" for a long time, reason not stated.
LIPTON informed that he would talk with his brother, BILL LIPIN,

business in San Diego for a long time and that he has become
acquainted with individuals in the bar and restaurant business
who are of Italian extraction. He mentioned among them the
MATRANGA brothers, who sought LIPTON's aid two or three years
ago in helping an Italian named DI GREGORIO, LIPTON described
DI GREGORIO as an Italian who appeared refined and possibly
with a university education who had come to Tijuana, B.C.,
Mexico, to seek entrance into the United States. While there

he married one of the VITALE girls. He referred .the matter

to an attorney named VERNE WARNER. DI GREGORIO was'not allowed
to enter and went back to Italy with his wife. A child was born
to them since. He was again contacted by the MATRANGAS and wrote
to Representative BOB WILSON on his bahalf. The last LIPTON
claims to have heard, DI GREGORIO was still in Italy.

On March 14, 1958, the San Diego Office advised that
FRANK MARINO, FBI Number 1651123, was the registered owner of the
automobile used by the person making the payment to the subject's
loan account at the U. S. National Bank on March 3, 1958. It
has been established that the person making the payment was
SAM BOMPENSIERO, but. in view of the fact that MARINO is a
bartender for SAM BOMPENSIERO, the following information is
peing set forth concerning him at this point:

The records of the San Diego Merchants Credit
Association, as made available by Mrs. OLIVE ROBINSON on
March 4, 1958, show that FRANK MARINO and his wife, SUZANNE,
have resided at 4007 Hope since 1951. This individual is, /
according to those files, the nephew of FRANK MARINO, 1360 Columbia,
and the son of JOE MARINO. He is reported owner of Lamar Ura
Company, San Diego, of which there is no record. He has been
a fisherman and has been arrested as a suspect in bookmaking
by the San Diego Police Department. He does his banking at
the Security Trust and Savings Bank, Fifth and "E", San Diego.

, The records of the San Diego Police Department, as
made available on March 4, 1958, by Lieutenant JACK BAKER,
reflect that FRANK B, MARINO, San Diego Police Department
Number 67910, FBI Number 1651123, was born at San Diego on
May 30, 1920, and was arrested on a bookmaking charge on
November 13, 1950, the charge later being dismissed. He was
a suspected partner of a bookmaker named LLOYD HAINES. A
photograph of MARINO was secured.

Mrs. PATRICK GAVIN
4134 Lymer Drive
S San Diego, California

The San Diego Office, on March 14, 1958, advised that
Mrs, GAVIN was formerly married to "MOMO" ADAMO and as previously
reported, allegedly she and DESIMONE had an "affair" prior to
ADAMO's suicide. Through MEL WILSON, U. S. National Bank, the
San Diego Office determined that Mrs. GAVIN's present husband
is an engineer working for Convair and was reportedly left with
only meager resources when ADAMO committed suicide.

JOHN PERUMEAN

. On March 12, 1958, Patrolman RICHARD BAUGH, Downey,
California Police Department, advised that PERUMEAN was a
close friend of DESIMONE, and during the day (March 12, 1958)
had advised that he considered himself the closest friend the
subject has in the city of Downey. BAUGH said that PERUMEAN
expressed the attitude that the newspapers and law enforcement
agencies had harrassed the suoject unreasonably, and he did
not think that the subject would come out of hiding until he
decided to do so. He also told BAUGH that he was concerned
for the subject's safety because he had not heard from him
since the day the subject left for New York City in November,
1957. ‘

On March 14, 1958, PERUMEAN advised SAA STINE
at his place.of business, the Downey Motor Company, 8112
South Firestone Boulevard, Downey, California, that he met
the subject in 1923 and since that time has been with the
subject on at least a once-a-week basis when they were both
in the Los Angeles area (which includes Downey). He said
the subject left Downey for New York City intending to have
an eye operation performed by Dr. TAGLIAGAMBE in New York.
He said the subject did not want his mother to know that he
was being operated om and wished to spare her concern for him.
PERUMEAN said that he had been in contact with the family
(DESIMONE) since FRANK left for New York City and had not
heard anything from them concerning his whereabouts since
approximately January 1, 1958. He said at that time he had
learned from Dr. JOE DESIMONE that the subject was in Tampa,

’ Florida, and presumed that he was recovering from an eye

operation. He said that as of March 14, 1958, he was convinced
that Dr. JOE DESIMONE did not know where his brother was.
PERUMEAN advised that he intended to go to the San Diego,
California area where he believed FRANK might possibly be

with friends.

PERUMEAN said that he feels the subject has slighted
him in not keeping ‘him informed of his whereabouts or condition.
He said that he regards the subject as “closer than a brother"
and feels that if the subject is in any difficulty they know \
each other well enough to expect mutual help within their ability.
He said that from time to time in-the past he has loaned the
subject money and has always been repaid. He said he knows
that subject has not obtained a gréat deal of money from his
practice as an attorney within the past two or three years.

He advised the subject has:taken clients who are unable to
pay or are considered so close as friends that he does not
charge them normal legal fees.

He stated that the subject in 1954 and 1955 spent a
great deal of his time in San Diego defending FRANK BOMPENSIERO,

PERUMEAN stated that he is convinced from what
DESIMONE has said that BOMPENSIERO was "railroaded to prison,"
He said the subject explained that BOMPENSIERO, who is now
in prison, was put there as the direct result of uncorroborated
testimony of one person who committed perjury. He advised that
he, PERUMEAN, shared the subject's attitude toward. law enforce-
ment agencies in Los Angeles and San Diego that they have
not been fair in their dealings with DESIMONE's friends. He
said he included in this category JACK DRAGNA, "who was framed
by the Los Angeles Police Department." PERUMEAN did not
amplify this remark but stated it was because of "deals like
this" that DESIMONE will have nothing to do with law enforce-
ment authorities.

PERUMEAN said that he has become increasingly

alarmed over the fact that the subject-has not contacted him
and believes there is a possibility that because of his
“physical condition the subject may be seriously ill. He said
there is also the possibility that the subject is no longer
alive. He advised that the subject has friends all over the

‘ United States, and if he wished to hide out from the authorities
would be able to do so foras long as'he wished. PERUMEAN
advised that he would try to determine where the subject was

_ but would not promise to alert this office in case his search

or inquiries were fruitful. He advised that he would inform
the subject and be guided by whatever he desired, 4

PERUMEAN said that recent stories in the Los Angeles
papers concerning the fact that the Federal Narcotics Bureau
is searching for the subject in order to serve him with a |
subpoena has caused the subject's family a’ great deal of
embarrassment, He advised that a local newspaper had called
the DESIMONE residence and had conversed with the subject's
sister, ROSALIE. He said.the reporter "gave her a bad time."

PERUMEAN said that the subject is an inveterate
gambler and would not be at all, surprised if when all the facts
are known the so-called Apalachin, New York "hoodlum convention"
was merely a gettogether by a group of friends wanting to
gamble. He said he did not know any of the others who were
present, except SIMONE SCOZZARI.

He advised that the subject is a close friend of
FRANK DIECIDUE, Tampa, Florida, who provides him with the
| long black cigars which he, subject, always smokes. He said
that TAGLIAGAMBE was discharged from the service on the
West Coast, and after his discharge spent a great deal of
time with the subject in Los Angeles.

i . PERUMEAN said that to his knowledge the subject

| has never been engaged in any illegal activities. He said

| the subject is a good attorney who usually represents fellow

i Sicilians. He said the subject's father, ROSARIO DESIMONE,
was regarded as a very influential person among the Sicilians
in the Los Angeles area, and as a result the subject has been
sought after by other persons of this nationality to do their
legal work,

! He said the subject's father was a big gambler,

| and many_ games of poker with high stakes were played among
friends in his home. He said the subject inherited his father's
proclivity for cards and has also an avid interest in the horse
races,

He said. that. DESIMONE's close friends include
the BOMPENSIERO and ‘the MfRABLI families in San Diego, California.

Organized Crime - Mafia

FABIO DE GREGORIO (also spelled and previously
referred to as DI GREGORIO) was interviewed on March 20,
1958, at the U. S. Immigration and Naturalization Service,
San Ysidro, California, when he applied for "parole" into
the United States to be near his wife who is eight months
pregnant. Previously it was reported that DE GREGORIO had
named DESIMONE as the person who had assumed leadership of
_ the Mafia in Southern California after JACK DRAGNA's death.

The San Diego Office on March 21, 1958, advised in
addition to the above, that DE GREGORIO related much the same
information as he had furnished a Federal Narcotics Officer
in Rome, Italy, in January, 1957. He said he did not personally
know DESIMONE, nor did he now know where the subject might
possibly be, He said he recognizes the subject's name only
as one mentioned about in San Diego during 1955 when he was
there. He said he does not recall the circumstances under
i which the subject's name was brought up but does remember
) that he received the impression that the name was treated with
considerable respect. He said also that the name had been
mentioned by one of the ADAMOS in San Diego, but he was unable
to state which member of this family had said anything about
the subject. DE GREGORIO said he did not recognize the subject's
photo,

He said that he had read in Italian newspapers

| a list of the individuals present at the Apalachin meeting

but did not recall that the name DESIMONE was included. He

said he reviewed this list with his wife in Italy and that

she acknowledged recognizing two or three of the names, including
PRIZIOLA. He said he did not recall the other names which
“seemed to make an impression on his wife.

DE GREGORIO said that his family is engaged, in
an import-export business in Italy and that he has no blood
relatives in the United States; that the only relatives
are through marriage and that he has not been taken into
eonfidence by the SALVATORE VITALE family so far as business '
matters are concerned. He said he has been treated well as a i

son-in-law by his wife's family who come from a rather low
social strata in Italy. He said he has not become acquainted
with the activities of his in-laws' family in the United States.

On February 28, 1958, the San Diego Office advised
that DE GREGORIO arrived at Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico,
from Italy on February 27, 1958. He traveled via New York,
San Francisco, and Los Angeles. He was met at the Tijuana
Airport by LEO MATRANGA, brother of JOE MATRANGA, a San Diego
local hoodlum,

On March 20, 1958, the San Diego Office advised that

pai informed that the MATRANGA family had rented an apartment
in Tijuana at Number 374 Avenida Guanajuato but it had been
unoccupied because DE GREGORIO did not wish to live in the
immediate vicinity of JASPER (GASPARE) MATRANGA, a deportee
from the United States. T-l4 said that DE GREGARIO wishes to
avoid contact in Tijuana with any questionable element in
order to further his’ case for entry into the United States.
{-14 stated that on March 1, 1958, DE GREGORIO had been contacted
by a person referred to as Mr. CAPPELLO (phonetic) who might
possibly be identical with HOWARD CHAPPELL, head of the Federal
Narcotics Bureau, Los Angeles, California. T-l4 said this-
‘U. S. Government agency to date has barred the possibility

of DE GREGORIO's entry into the United States owing to a
family (VITALE) history of dealing in narcotics.

In connection with the foregoing, it had previously

RICHARDS said he offered VITALE a ride, and during the course
of conversation VITALE noted that RICHARDS was a detective

and commented that his father's disappearance had never been
satisfactorily investigated. RICHARDS said that he met

the VITALE son on one other occasion within a few days follow-
ing his first contact and at that time the VITALE boy said
that news that his father would not be seen again was first
brought to the VITALE family by FRANK DESIMONE, the subject,
RICHARDS said that VITALE explained that DESIMONE had never
before or since been seen in the VITALE household. RICHARDS
said that he tried to contact VITALE a few times following
this second meeting and was politely informed that the

VITALE. boy had mentioned the meeting with RICHARDS to his
family, and they told him to say nothing more about the
incident. RICHARDS said it was not possible to engage this
person in conversation any further on the disappearance of his
father or of the part played by DESIMONE in notification to
his mother about the disappearance. \
