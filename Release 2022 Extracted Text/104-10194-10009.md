1, Latin American Consultant =
Area Knowledge and spanish language fluency dates back to
1946-49 when I engaged in preparation.of ec-nomic and political

studies and analyses of Latin American republics for U.5. Air Force
staf? and command dissemination. After studies in Scononic and Social
Sciences at universities of Costa dica and Havana, I contributed to,
or supervised, research, analysis and preparation of investment and
marketing studies in Mexico-and Cuba. Because of language fluency

I have frequently maintained business and social contacts with she
government agencies and indigenous organizations.

2. Training, Administr-tion and Hanagement: -

At various times, I have supervised two to five conpany personnel
and up to twenty or, tzirty, indesenous field axents. This also involved
seloction, ann ys ‘and training of indigenous personnel as well.
as funding their field survey operations. Training usually xxx included
the techniques: of- interviewing as attuned withthe field of study or

survey. Id The compilation of studies and publications frequently
required editorial supervision and =) ion, using skills
in maps, photography, reproduction methods, and some knowledge of

printing. 7
