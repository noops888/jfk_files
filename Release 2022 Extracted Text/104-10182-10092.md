Reference: !DCA-3447

Action: Paragraphs 1 and 8,

1. In response to the Station's request contained in
reference for information on Mitchell Livingston WER-SELL, IIT,
this is to provide the Station with sone pertinent personal data
on him, and to recommend that the Station, i.e., Theodore R, KETTNE:
aveid contact with him in Operational matters but, to the extent

7 securely possible, monitor his activities in the area.

2. WER-BELL, born on 8 March 1918 in Phi lade Iphia,
Pennsylvania, was sarried in 1942 to Ji Idegarde Elizabeth
HEMMERICH, and has six children, He was an Army first lieutenant
when recruited by KUTWIN, with which service he saw duty with some
distinction in the China Theater during the second half of 1945,

3. In 1953 he established his own business, Mitchell Werbell
Public Relations and Advertising Company, in Atlanta, Ceorgia,
which went out of business in 1959, due _to_insolvency caused
priadrily by his injudicious and unorthodox trade practices.

4) Subject is well-known to KUBARK, whose officers have
categorized him variously as unscrupQlous, a "whealer-dealer",
and a promoter of grandiose schemes; as a man whe lives beyond
his means; and as a high-pressure advertising and promotion

man,

‘Sa In the summer of 1959 Subject offered his services to
KUBARK, ‘claiming knowledge of Cuban and UVorinican affairs.
Although a POA was granted on 4 August 1989 for his use as a
source of information on revolutionary activities in the
Caribbean area, it evolved that the information he provided was
of little value, It was further judged that Subject wished to

use KU3ARK funds to promote his personal interests and,
consequently, he was terminated in Uctober of 1959.

6. «ith regard to Subject's assertions as reported in
reference, we wish to comment that:

a. Although we cannot confira ay controvert nis
status as vice-president of FINA, in Aprid of 1963 he allowed
,to OJENVY at Atlanta that he was presidéit of Communications
International, Inc. ODENVY pad cohtacted Subject to deternine
his pessible connection with Dr. Elmer Henry LOUGHLI», who
has recently been indiaed as an unregistered agent of the
aitian Government.

b. while his claim of past KUTHIN service is true,

_ the degree of his friendship with that service's well-known

director remains open to speculation, ior there are no
indications that the two were even acquainted.

c. The nature and extent of his relationship with
many important Central American officials is scored by an
episode which occurred in August-September 1962, when he tried -
to secure the recognition by several Central Anerican countries
of a Cuban government in exile. In this undortaking, for
example, he offered a Nicaraguan goverment spokesman
$100,900 to secure that country's recognition. And, in
October of 1962, he reportedly tried, through an intermediary,
to purchase used military aircraft in PBPRIME ostensibly for
use in the Dominican kepublic to train Latin American pilots
for a thrust against Cuba. /Yq this October report, Subject
is cited as being a forner public relations representative
here tor the Trujillo regimey+

7. Further to the above, in Cctober of 1962 Subject was
being investigated by OvENVY For his possible involvonent in
1959 in the shipping of arms to Ecuador.

8. ‘The avove salicnt features as to Subject's background,
should be sufficient to discourage any operational use of
subject, and to indicate the need for caution on se Tinix's
part should he have any further contact with hin, At the sane
tine, deadquarters considers that information on Subject'«
local activities and contacts, as could affect QDYOKc interests,
should be reported as such becones known to the Station.
