agree to let the agent view the note for a few moments.

He advised that the original of the note was in a

safety deposit box and could be obtained for court by

issuing a subpoena to him as custodian of the note.

The copy of the note, which was payable to J.

FOLSE ROY for $300,000.00 bore

the signature of CARLOS

MARCELLO. On the back of the note was a statement

advising

that the sum of the note was backed by certain

coded

security, stocks in Churchill Farms, Inc. and in

Bayou Verret Land Company, Inc. The

sum of the note

was further backed

by a promissory note dated 11/25/60,

signed by VINCENT C. RODRIGUEZ and made payable to

FLORENCE MONTALDO which CARLOS MARCELLO apparently had

bought from MONTALDO.

The back of the J. FOLSE ROY note

was notarized by M. H. CONNOLLY.

MAGEE advised that RODRIGUEZ waS ROY'S

attorney, but FLORENCE MONTALDO was not known to him. He

believed M. H. CONNOLLY waS MARY CONNOLLY.
