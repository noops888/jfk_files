“* PBRUMEN/LIRING-3

Action Required: None, FY!

1, Forwarded herewith for Headauarters information and
files Is an Agent Service Record on Liz IKG-3.

2. As Addressees are aware. Waliace P. ROWTON recruited

: and formerly handled LIRING-3 for the Hexico City Station,

Prior to RONTON's PCS departure from Mexico City in July 1969,

it was deciced, after some discussion, to effect 4 turnover of

LIRING-3, rather than terminate him, Although LIRING-3 apparently

had been well "burned" with the Cubans, he seemed to have maintai:.ed

good contacts with members of the Rebel Armed Forces (FAR) of

Guatemala. !n addition, in May and June of this year, he had

begun tc develop access to some Panamanian revolutionaries of

interest. It was therefore decided to rur LIRING-3 on a triat

basis to determine whether he could be used effectively against

“ Central American revolutionary targets, despite his problems with
the Cubans,

t

3. ROWTON introduced Leonard S. TORMET, in alias, to LIRING-3
on I July 1969. Although ROWTON had represented himself to LIRING-3
as a Greek tusinessman, it was decided that it would be preferable
to ‘clear the air" somewhat with LIRING-3, at least by making it

clear that he was in touch with a WOLADY orsenization. ce
less, no specific exalaration was given LIRING-3 of his soonsor
and he requested none. LIRING-3 was told tnat TORMET would be
seeing him for some months, since ROWION was leaving the country
for an indefinite period. |

&, LIRING-3 was told that although TORHMET was trusted by
ROWTON and collaborated with him, he represented a different
organization. LIRING-3 was also told that although he had in the
past been receiving between 3,000.00 and 3,520.00 Mexican’ pesos
fee, month on an informal basis, TORMET's ha ba zation feit that
7500 Mexican pesos per month ($120.00) woula te a fair salary at
this stage of the operation. TORMT explainec that he was eware
of LIRIKG-3's past activities directed against tre Cubans, and the
N resuitant problems which hed arisen. It was explained that

TOR ‘s interest was in Central Averican revolutionary activities.
In orcer to deal with LIRING-3's virtual "burneo" status with the
Cubans, he was directed to tell any Central American contacts that
the Cubans no longer trusted him, and that he tnerefore was no
longer directly involvec with any revolutionary groups or activities.)
Nonetheless, LIRING-3 was directed to offer any assistance which
ne Couia provive co any revolutionaries, ON LHe esis UI Uis
leftist beliefs and the friendships which he had made with FAR
members while in prison in Guatemala. It would then be a matter
of time before we could learn whether LIRING-2 «2s complete -y
blacklisted in all revolutionary circles becai:se of his proviems
with the Cubans or whether he could provide information of value.

5. LIRING-3 throughout the meeting seemed in good spirits
and he seemed to accez* the turnover without any qualms, . Indeed,
he pointed out that the Cubans had lost trust in him only after
he had been given various tasks to co by ROWTON which he nad known
and warned in advance would cause suspicion, {t was agreed that
LIRING-3's troubles were not of his own making, but that at this
stage all that could te done was to attempt to circumvent the

existing problems. |

6. LIRING-3 was given a Station non-attributable telephone
number and false name to ask for (Identity) to set up meetings
with TORMET. Only the meeting time was to be set by phone, and
@ prearranced pickup point was decided upon, It should be noted
that TORMET's QP vehicle was used for this first meeting with
LIRING-3, which means it was of course exposed to LIRING-3,

7. Subsequent to this meeting, LIRING-3 never initiated
contact with the Station. Although he might have lost the new
telephone number he was given to use with TORMET, there is no
Indication he ever again tried to call ROWTON, who was in Mexico
for at least three weeks after the | July turnover to TORMET.

8. The Station assumes that for whatever reasons, WIRING-3
has in effect terminated himself. Given the nature of this case--
the fact that LIRING-3 was denounced in Cuban official circles as
a@ RVROCK agent, the fact that LIRING-3 in over two years was never
very productive and-now the apparent decision of LIRING-3 to break

- off contact--it has been cecided to make no effort to reestablish
contact with him. . .

24 September 1968

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECOK))

FROM: WH/L

SUBJECT: 17 Septembi-r 1968 discussion with DRISCOLL
re LIRUG/3 & LIRING/4.

PARTICIPANTS: DRISCOLL, Ks:RBE, FRANCIS and Laurence
PIPER (C/Mis/2/6) .

1, LIRING/4 is stil} very concerned about the im-
prisonment of LIRING/3. LIRING/4 wil} not travel to Cuba
until she is assured of the aafetr a2 TTPINT 2, CISCO

i jas toorougniy discussed L/3 with L/4 and has pointed out
the danger of attempting to intercede on L/3‘s behalf
through business contacts, L/4 contacted the Cubans for’
assistance but they stated there was nothing they could do.
They have assisted L/4 with small amounts of money. L/3
has devised an open code which he uses in letters to let
L/4 know how he is. The letters are grim reading because
L/3 keeps stating he is unable to hold out much longer.
Fellow prisoners have warned L/4 nct to let the Guats
transfer him to another priaon as this usually ends in the
prisoner being shot “while escaping.” One good result
from the continued imprisunment of L/3 is that both he and
L/4 are furthering their bona fides with the Cubans.

t
i

2. L/4 is in telephone contact with the Third Secre-
tary of the Mexican Enbassy in Guatemala. He has made
inquiries about L/3 with the Guats on behalf of Foreign

__. Minister CARRILLO Flores. A few weeks ago (prior to the
assasination of the U.S. Awhassador) the Third Secretary
told L/4 there were three possibilities, the first which
he considered out of the question was that L/3 sould be
shot, the second was that 1/4 would come to trial and'be
released within a few weeks, and the third was that he woul¢
receive a sentence of two or three years. Just prior ito
departing Mexico on this current trip, DRISCOLL attempted
to strange a meet with L/4 in the usual means by slipping a

t typed note under her apartment door. She did not make the

1 meeting. DRISCOLL later learned through phone tap material.

dante that she callea the Cuban Embassy and informed them the

Mexican authorities had notified her she was being fined
500 pesos. The purpose of the payment was not identified.
Later she made a call from the Cuban Enbassy which indicated
she was staying there until she could get the funds to pay
the Mexicans. DRISCOLL. therefore, concluded she had not
returned to her apartment and did not get the note to make
their meeting. DRISCOLL said SUAREZ (the visiting Cuba
Cultural type) has a key to L/3's apartment and night see
the note but would be unable to identify the sender since
DRISCOLL uses a meaningless sé as a signature. !
3. DRISCOLL now plans upon his return to Mexico to_

recontact L/4 to get the latect readinr on 1/2 Pekapers
Guavemaia. 41 the Mexican Charge is unable to obtain L/3's
release ir behalf of the Mexicans and if it appears he will
be held indefinately, DRISCOLL wants to explore the possibility
of our doing something to get L/3 out so the operation ean
become active again.

4. In the above regard L/3 was discussed with Mr. i
of the Guatemala desk. Mr. PIPER believed the Station has
a high enough contact with the Guats (ESM:JOR/20-Presidents
brother) to arrange to get L/3 and his Vexican compatriot out
of prison and back to Mexico with a minimun security risk.
DRISCOLL said he would initiate the cable upon his return to
Mexico after he has talked sith L/4. DRISCOLL felt he Should
possibly travel to Guaterala and have a preliminary neet with
L/3 before Guat Station makes any all out effort to officially
request L/3's release. If, after seeing L/3 DRISCOLL is ‘'satis—
fied that L/S is still an ally and is willing to cooperate
after his release then DRISCOLL believes we should attempt to
have the Station intercede with ESHAJOR/20. Hopefully, ESKAJOR/
20 will arrange the release so that all involved believe it
has been done at the request and urging of the Mexican Govern-
ment. DRISCOLL, however. would like L/3 and L/4 to believe ~
he (DRISCOLL) had something to do with the release in onder
to raise his status with both for the sake of future operation-
al tasks he will levy on them. ,

* CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH

b. "Romulo," who made at least one trip: “out
of town” from 17 February to 2 April 1965 (possibly
to Guatemala) during the period covered by ROSTON's
reports, appears to belong to a faction of the
Guatenalan FAR family disillusioned with PBRUMEN.

c. The only real service asked LIRING-3 by’ ~
“Romulo” during the period under review was to put
up an unidentified "comrade" scheduled to come to

determine exactly. This "comrade" was not the young
Guatemalan who dropped in on’ LIRING-3 for a couple
of days mentioned in the report dated 25 April.

d. LIRIXG-3 continues to collect clear evidence
i that LIRING has done its best to denounce him as a

Freports dated 15 and 19 February).

varticularly sienificant results. A vretext investigation of

4. There is little question at this point that L Tiree
is close to persona non grata with LIRING. Hence, his further
usefulness against the PBRUMEN target is very limited.

ROWTON has kept away from LIRING-4 since LIRING-3's release

from prison in Guatemala. Although LIRING-4, following her
father's death (see MEXICO CITY-0125), may visit her mother

in PBRUMEN, she has no particular love for LIRING or the PERUMEN
authorities. On the Guatemalan side of this operation, the
Station is, as it has done many times in the past, waiting for
LIRING-3's Guatemalan contacts to make the next berth

wiser not to teke any initiative in seexing out bis FAr friends or

revisitins tae
that bis old Guatezelan friend, Jacoto Rodriruez Padilla,
ou hig once in the company of Carlos Yeca, but nothing sisaificant
had emerged from the casual conversation. Vega, at several points

in the conversation, nad sunbled scnetsing te Zodriguez about the

: “crisis" but nieher cave an explanation. L/3 tcld Rowton that he as-

f ‘sumed that tais rcmerk referrred to the currext factiorelism in the

i Rowton told L/3 that according to the very sketchy information he

had concerning Mario aucosto Mendez Azuiler it appeared thet the latter

: explain the turn-about of the LIRi‘Gs after he, i/3, hed indicated to

= LIRISG/9 that he was in contact with *Pavel." }

H Rowton urged L/3 to seek out *Rémuto”™ at the calle Coshuila 221 safe-
house, and, failing this, to recentact Humberto Gonzalez vega at his
one on calle Manzanillo, in the hope tnoat the latter could arrange

going on. Jorge Godoy was cuite frank with hin telling hic that the ii-1\G
office had advised bin to keep clear of L1#I"S/3 because he was inot te be
trusted. Godoy continued thet a LIKIG officiel had told him that LiaIxG/3
was being used ( perhaps uweccnsciously at first) l-y sone counter-revolu-
tion: Office based it assertion on the
followine three points: (1) LIAING/3 had been in teuch with a foreimor wao

bad undertaxen the mission te Saatemala to get informatica against the re-
volution. - |

According to LIRiLG/3, Forge Godoy told him tcat it was difficult to belive

office to attempt to obtain information on the state of health of the



*
father of LIRI:.G/4 through the LIKING office in 2 City. LisING/3
agreed that there was li.tle chance of this request being honored, but
it would serve to revesl nis lac of any otzer channels to LIRIN3/4 's
father and stress the lezitimacy of LIRING/4's concern for the tealth
of her father( an appliceticn for a visa to visit hin). A

in Mexico and a suspeczed PBRUMEN contact. The H
Staticn had the LIBGRACZ team cover the entrance |
of the building where ¥E\DEZ and other FAR members |
have an apartment they use for clandestine meetings |
with LIRING-3, Despite the fact that the team i
knows LIRING-3 from previous surveillance and that
“a copy of LIRING-3's sketch of MENT7 was also
provided, the LIEMBRACES spotted neither an. The
(Station naturally plans to cover another meeting |
and is also exploring the possibility of determining,
who rented the apartneat and from whom. It is of |;
Some interest to note that MENDEZ, aithough he gave
LIRING-3 the agreed upon recognition signal, may |
still not be the "Pavel" LIRING-3 was told he would |
meet. LIRING-3 was shown a photograph of Oscar

(ao\- isa) arturo“@PEae Ramirez (know. to have serviced a

letter drop in Mexico City used by Michelle Jeannette
FIRK before her death in Guatemala). LIRING-3 fl
thougnt it Icoked like a poor print of a photograph |
of “Pavel” shown to Lin while still incarcerated. ‘

NG-3 is apparently still suspicious |

an th

several letters (see paragraph 2) froz members of
the YAR in Guatemala warning him that adverse rumors:
(some of then calling nin a WOFIRM agent) have been ‘
circulated in that country by Carlos PERZABAL Marcve.
Knowing that PERZABAL's father-in-law is 2 close
friend of Chief, LIRING, LIRING-3 sourced the rumors,
to the LIRING headman. He first took up the matter
of the accusations made against hin with LIRING-9. ©
The latter said there was ndthing to this, but, and
there was 2 but, LIRINC-9 reminded LIRING-3 that

\z the past he had been connected “with a person of |

mysterious aid suspicious affiliatious," a clear
reference to ROWTON, LIRING-3's Greek friend. When
LIRING-3 insisted he wanted to discuss the matter [
of the allegations sade against his directly with
Chief, LISING, LIRING-9 promised to make an appoint
ment for him. This appojntsent, however, never
materialized. That Chief, LIRING may have spread ,
the allegations made.against LIRING-3 by PERZABAL {|
|

was confirred by” RolindoSUAREZ (see ROWION'S
report dated 31 December); LIRING-3 also took up
the matter of the PERZABAL denunciations with MENDEZ,
who told him that the FAP had paid no attention to |
them and even accompanied LIRING-3 to PERZABAL's = |
house. LIRING-3, hovever, nade the mistake of |
giving his name when asked who was calling. The |;
result, as could be expected, was that PERZABAL was |
“not in.” MENDEZ agreed to accompany LIRING-3 to.
LIPING to talk to its Chief, but he warned LIRING-3 !
not to make accusations without proof. MENDEZ,
incidentally, does not appear to be pro-PBRUMEN. |
This is interesting in view of the fact that
CONTRERAS, with whom he may. be identical, is a
- Suspected contact of the PBRUMENers.

©. So far, it does not seen that the FAR has
‘been greatly disturbed by the accusations made
against LIRING-3. “In fact, MENDEZ and tke two othe
FAR members LIRING-3 met on 1 January have urged = -
LIRING-3 to join them ia the hills of Guatemala,

x intensified. They did not hide that their purpose

was to broadcast LIRING-3's tame and the fact that
a Kezican had joined their fight. This was apparently
to zppeal to the Mexican left and gain their support.
While LIRING-3 has declared himsel! ready to go back
to Gaatenala (if this was what ROWZ0N wanted him to
do), he did sot need ROWTON to decide that broad-
casting his name from the jungles of Guatenala was
not a thing he wanted anyone to do. At Station -
directive, LIRING-3 pointed out that after his
recent imprisonment he had to take care of his wife
before doing any more for the cause. The best way
to do this vas to take LIRING-4 to PPRUMEN ind leave o
her wiih relatives. This led LIRING-3 to ask what, :
if anything, he could do for the FAR in Mexico.
So far, however, his FAR friends have not risen to
the bait. j

Subject: LIRING/3 Report of Gentact by “Pavel” of PAR. {
i i Henin

4. LIRING/3 reported to Rowton et 1000 on 23/12/66 at the restaurant
in the Camino Zeal Hotel that at long last the FAR contact promised by
the Leén Barrios brothers. had appeared. LIAiiiG/3 told Zowton that et ebcut
1900 on 19 December a Guatezalan came to his apartment and intppduced
himself as “a friend of Violeta.“ L/3 invited him in but asked him not to
discuss anything sensitive in the presence of his wife. After about ten
minutes of chit chat in the spartrent, 1/3 end the Custemalan, who gave

his name sizply as "Rémulo", went to a nearby restaurant to talx privately.

2. According to LIRING/3, the Guatemalan stated that he kad been ordered
by FAR to maintain contact with 1/3. When queried by 1/3 regarding the
Humberto Gonzflez Vega whom he had met nrevinuely, "Phents 0
"Oh, you mean '£1 Gato’ - he's a good element, but ne vill not beim your
FAR contact. I have been entrusted with that mission.” "Rémulo" also stazed
that he knew Francisco Lara well and had worked with hin in Guatemala City
some time ago until Lara was arrested. "Rénuio” added thet unfortunately
Lara's mother hed betreyed him to the police and he barely escaped arrest
at that time. "Késulo” confirmed that Lara had been under a cloud as Sar
as his superiors were concerned and had mad.

é the ill-feted trip
in order to attempt to clear himself of charzes against him.

3. When L1RING/3 told "Rémulo” that be had been in touch with the LIRING
office since bis return, the latter exclained,"But what wave the LI
People to do with us?" Tais gave L/3 the definite impression that "Rémulo"
ainself was not in touch with a PEEUAEN representative in Mexico City,and,
in any case, didnot like the LIRING establishment. i

&. He then asked 1/3 to cive him a summary report of tke arrest and detention,
1/3 told Rowton that he balked at this at first, protesting to "Rémulo™ that
he bad already given the details to the Leén Sarrios brcthers and"Cebollito"
who he was sure had passed on the report to the FAR in Guatemala. “hen
"Rémulo" explained that he vould appreciate sn oral report on the spot since
he wes not fully inforzed beceuse of communications problems, LIRiiG/3 told
Rowton that he went over the whole episode for "Rémulo's" benefit. "Rémulo"
then asked to see LIRING/3 again at 1100 on 24 December to coatinue their
discussion. He promised to-neet L/3 on the, street in front of his apartment
house at the appointed tine. ‘ }

i
5. LURING/3 con*%inued to Rowton that much to bis surptrise and: indignation
he received a lettcr on the following day(20/12/68) from Martha, the sother



. longer since he was very busy. After another annoying wait, LIRING/S appear

2.

of the Len Zarrios brothers, in which,smong other thines, she stated that
“the man on the bgcycle", which L/3 explained to Kowton xeant Carlos
Persabal bed written a letter contaising grave charges
against LIXING/3. The letter, which 1/3 read aloud to zcwton, went an to
assure L/3 that these charges vere not believed but constituted a source
of annoyance to tne writer's friends. i

6. LIRING/3 continued to Rowtcn thet he felt so indicnant and shockei at

this unpleasant development that he decided to see the Chief LIKING and

have it ait with hin. L/3 explained that since the Chief LIR’ is on very
friendly terms with the father-in-law of Persabai he might be aware of the
letter and even possibly enccurgaged Persabal to write it. L/3 told zowton
that he then got in touch with LIaING/2 by telephone andi made a date to meet
nim at tne LIKING establishzent at 0930 on 21/12/62. when he arrived et the
gate at thet time he was told that LIRING/2 had not yet arriveed. After a wait
of some twenty minutes, LIRING/2 appeered but asked LIRZING/3 to wait a little

B

instead of LIRING/2 and talzed with LIZING/3 on the patio. LIRING/3 explain
that he wanted urcently to talk with the Chief LIZING sice something bad
come up with regard to Persetal. He reminded LIRING/9 that he originelly hod
exppresseé a desire to have a face-to-fece ccnfrontationiwith Persbbal in
tbe LIKING office so that he could preseut his report on‘the arrest in sis
presence. LIRiNG/9, accordirg to LIAING/3, brushed this 6ff again with the
comment, "But as I told you before, you're maxing a mountain of a noledill.
You're exaggerating the whole business.”

9. LIRIKG/3 tole Rowton that he then took out Martha's letter and insisted
that LIRING/9 read it. The latter expressed amazement at ithe revelation of | -
Persabal's action but did not agree with LIRING/3 that the Chief LIEING i
would be able to shed ligot on it. LIRING/3 then told LIRING/9 that be did :
not like the gemes that everycne seemed to be playing with him, and asked
LIRING/9 point ba’ank what it was thet zotivated hin to ask for a written
report of the arr:st and,after L/3 complied with the request, to @raf bis
feet. L/3 continued that he felt he had been frank with the LIRIXG office,
whereas on the other hand they were not honest with him jn telling him shat
they thought of him. 1/9 then assured L/3 of his confidence inhim and edded
that in the past certain persons, including Hugo, the assistant to LIRLiG/1,
had felt thatLIzinc/3 had been connected with a person off mysterious and i:
suspicious affiliations.!L/3, understarding this to be a clear allusion to
Rowton, admitted to havihg known this person in the past re bey ‘ing hed ae

.@ few business transac-ions with him, including the sale of a sumber of

his paintings, but insisted with some annoyance that this kad sok bearing
on big political activity. LIZIN3/9 acreed and eaced that it was really a
thing of the past that should not bother iIZI#G/3. He promised to muke an
appointment for LIRING/3 to see the Caief LIRING sozetime the following week.

8. LIainG/3 continued that whea ke met with "Rémulo® later tuat morning he
also showed the letter froz Mar‘ to hin. According to 1/3, ;"Rémulo" becane
indignant and sugeested thet they talk to Fersabal tocether to get to the
bottom of the matter. 1/3 and "Zizulo" then took a taxi to the residence of
Fersabal in the hope of findine nim in at the time. when L/3, Bowever, rang
the outside beal he was told byk woman ( who he suspects mxxk was either
Persabal’s wife or sister-in-law) that iersabal was not at boxe. 1/3 noted
the woran's astonishrient in cer tcue or voice woen ce evavea-cis name ew ues
request. "Rémulo” who was present later cozmeated thet L/3 should hot have
given his nane since it was obvious that mem Litddeietiee was at nome but did
not want to see LIRING/3.

‘9. According to 1/3, "Rémulo" at the second meeting stated that “several”

friends of his were plannir.y to return to Guatemala to continue their work
for the PAR end that he hoped thet LIRING/3 might be able to Lelp in this
mission. "R6mulo” did net specify what kind of assistence he! expected from
LIRING/3 tut promised to give bin detaiis shen the tine cane for action in

this matter. He promised to see L/3 azain at 1600 on 24 Deceaber 1968.

10. LIEING/3 told Rowton that he planned to insist on seeing: the Chief LIKTIG
IN TSE HOPE of determining his reaction to the charges by Persabal in view
of the Chief's friendship with tae in-laws of Fersabal.

a) Contact of Cerlos Lévez: i/3 reported that about 1430 ca 24 December
as he and bis wife arrived at their apartment, tney found a*chaparit?
who introduced himseif as Carlos Lépez, a Guatemalan friend of
dacobo Hodriguez(Padilla), and gave L/3 a note of intrcduction from
that person. L/3 gave Rowton the ortinel Iatten | Ae ae wee

herewith. L/3 told Rowton taat Lépez stated that he was anxious to

send various items, including medicines, to FBRUMEN,and appealed to

L/3 since he "uxderstood" that 1/3 and his wife had contacts through

which he could send the itens. Lépes, according to i/3 appeared Bvery

interested to be reassured that L/3 really did nave good contacts
with the LIRING establistzent. When L/3 assured him tnat he did see

LIRING respresentatives, Lépez went on to re¥eal that: he was a friend

7 of Carlos Perzabal and thet ne was fully informed concerning the

recent "tragic situation” of both Persadal end LIRINGS/3. This bomb

shell shock L/3 badly and he felt obliged to launch inte e diatribe
against Perzabal. shen Lépez commented that “naturally we have to

take Ferzabal's word ageinst yours,since he know hin better,” L/3

told Rowton that he demanded an explanation of who the "we" were.

Lépez simply replied thet it meaht"idortant" persons in Guatemala

and Mexicu. He added that,"as you know", Persadal was ynown even to

CSsar Montes. L/3 retorted, "But Montes has been stripped of bis

authority,as you should know." This led 1/3 to the counterclaim that

he also had good friends in Guatemala and Mexico who could testify op
bis bebalt. es

LIRTKG/3 told Rowton thet he then showed Lopes a ptr: copy

of the attached letter which he had written to Perzabal demanding

: an explanation of the Jee he was known to be, spreading against

I him, and which ne /hk632: lrescy sent to the CP Mexico and. Spain. He’

asked Lépez to keep the copy and tell his good friend persabal where ©

eae i he got it and under what circumstances.

LIRIKG/3 continued to Rowton that be had to cut short rather
. heated exchange with Lépez since he had a date at 1600] that same
day with "Rémulo" outside bis apartment house.

"important FAR officials in Mexico", including a certain SJulie®
also known as "Buda". Résulo felt that Bude could lure Perzabel to
a@ private seeting sinne the latter tear alre.dy had interviewed

provide a go0d pretext for a confrontation between Perzabal acd

explained that he felt he could cet some sort of statement from the
LIKING Chief, either affirming or denyirg his knowledge of the
Perzabal letter so that he could use this in a pogsible meetizg with

that be went, as requested by "Xéaulo", to Calle Coahuila 224 (across
frox #oolwortts nezr the corner of Insurgextes Sur) ené found "Rénulo”

in apartment 12 in the company of two otter persons, previously unknown
to LIRING/3. Zoth wppeared younger than "zézulo” and one could easily be
hia brother because of the physical resezbiance. The other, apparent ege
25, light exicned,vho was introduced simply 2s an Ecuadorian, had a good
Guatenalan accent, and revealed in his recarxs an excellent knowledge of
Guatezala. The Zcuadorian, who hed the most pleasant personality of the
three, remarred during the conversation tast he had been inprisoned in
tke old penitentisry in Guatemala City and subsequently "thrown" over the
Yurtce vo saivecor. :
2. LZkING/3 tole Kowton that the small apertzent contained nothing that he
could see but a table and several chairs and was obviously a safehouse
rather than a resicence. "Rémulo™ later confirmed tais when he toid 1/3
i that taney would have to ceet there in the future only by appointment since
they did not live there but came cnly from tize to tine to talk.
sult, LIRING/3 made a date with them for 1600 on Friday, 3/1/69, at
time he, L/3, would come to the apartment. "Rémulo" premised to wait for him
at the entrance to the apartment building so taat 1/3 would not have to ‘
ring the bell end wait outside the door unnecessarily. {| 3
3. During the friendly discussicn that ensued in the apartrent ,1/3 took
the line previcusly agreed on with Rowton with apparent success. The young
Eeuadorien showed his approval by nodding ais head several times, when L/3
outlines his reasons for not accerting at cnce the proposal to return to :
Guetemala. "Romulo" was less sympathetic, and wnen 1/3 stated that he as

LIRING/3 agreed and said that he felt he would have to continue to stall,
even at the risk of alienatirg the affections and confidence of his new

2. LIRING/3 then speculated tuat F2rzabal could not have done such a serids
thing of his own initiative, but cust necessarily have been inspired by
some outside source, most probably tue LIKING establisiment. He continued
that he therefore felt it rore necessary than ever to put the LIgIiG Chief
"up against the wall" end force hii to adrit nis courlicity.| LIRING/3 added
that he hed seen "Rémulo" on 3 Jexcary a3 plerned and had — bim about

the letter from Marta and Terzabal's treachery. Secording to LIxihG/3
"Rémulo" became indignant and volunteered to accorpany LIRING/3 to the
LIRING esteblisiment to have the stole thing out once and for all. LIxi:G/3
appeared so disturbed at the unexpected news that Rowton found it impossible
to check with him on the exact tire and place he allegedly met “Rémlo” on
Friday, 3/1/69. vhen Rowton stated that he felt it very importent to iden-
tity "Rémulo” positiveely ( Rowton alleged that he had access to the Gober-

to the Mexicans for identificaticn}, LIRING/3 volunteered to arrange to

willing to travel to PPRUMEX. However, the.recent

. @eath of her nother, as well as the recent incar-

t ceration of her son (in a frare-up by his exployer —

and psychological low. The Station is allowing her

during this period.

empty tnents in the sane buildings where these
two LINING officers live. Attempts lo rent at least
one of these for an audio operation proved difficult
in yiew of the need for a cosiguer and finding
suitable people to move in. LIROSIN-) was’ goi:g to

the latter was of higher priority and discontinued

period.

D. LIRING-3/LIRING-4: On 29 October ROSTON
ret LIRING-3 after his release from jail. The
results of the initial debriefing were cabied in :
MEXICO CITY-7900. LIRING-3 indicated that LIRING-4
was very nervous and upset, and that he wanted all |
his ozn activity and association with ROJTON to be
kept from her. LIRING-3 has been necting fairly |
: frequently with LIRING-9, who has been debriefing
1 hin on his encarceration in Guatezala. (See MEXICO
’ CITy-8159 and -8228.)

%. PBRUMEN Maids: The Station decided to

H i mount an operation against the PSRUMEN maids, and

z selected LIEVBRACE-3 as a suitable access agent. sins
(See MEXICO CITY-7861.) The Station is in the
process of turning LIEXB2ACE-3 over to LIREALM-1, |
who vill be the outside Case Officer on this |

, operation. (See alse MEXICO CITY-8124.)

10. Double Agents: LISASSY-1 returned from:his puropean
trip on 17 Noveuber and was recontacted by LIRING-9, who
gevied requirements on him es reported in MEXICO CITY-8339.
LISASSY-1 continues to have difficulty satisfying LIRING-9
requests for information on the activities of the. PBRUMEN

xico City and Miz.i. The CI aspect of the
LISASSY-1 operation was virtually at a standstill;for two
reasons: first, at une timo or another, either LIRING-9 or
LISASSY-1 "as out of Mexico; and second, the Station has beer
unable tu cone up with information which LISASSY-1 could pass
to LIRING-9. In this last respect, LIS4SSY-1 continues to be
an excellent channel ef WOFIR“-controlled information to the
PERUNEN Government via LIRING-9.

11. Operations Against PBEUMEN Subversive activities in
Latin America:

A, LIRING-3:

co cITy-75: 0 tox’ ROXTON's

Guatenala, MEXICO CIfY-7245. reported that LIRING-3
received a letter from Guatemala which he interpreted
as a check on a new como channel between the
Guatemalan rebels and hin. LIRING-3 reported at
length to LIRING-9 on his contacts with FAR nenbers
while in jail. At LIRING-3's suggestion, LIRING-9
may send LIRING-3 to PBRUNE¥ to make a personal
report on this. (See MEXICO GITY-8159.) yore
detailed reports were forwarded in H¥MA-35905.
HMMA-35904 forwarded a report of LIRING-3's imprison-
ment in Guatemala.

B. Letter Drops: The PBRUMEN letter drops
being covered by the Station only produced one
interesting letter during this period. (See ‘MOtA-
35873.) The Statica suggested that Headquarters
follow up on the lead provided. :

C. LIRING-7: LIRING-7 continued to see his
Mexican leftist student “friends” during this period.

—--. (See HXMA-35822.) He also escorted a high-ranking
member of the Orthodox Church during a visit to
Mexico. One intelligence dissemination was made on
the basis of information produced by LIRING-7 during
this visit.

D. LIHACK-4: When he was in jail in mid- i
November, LIHACK-4 was approached by. some Mexicans,
arrested in connection with the student disturbances.
He was asked to take a walkie-type radio intq jail:
for their conmo, and was asked if he vould b@ willing
to assist them with his haz radio equipment for
direct commo between the revolutionaries and PBRU‘EN,
since going through LIRING vas not satisfactory.

The Station is taking a wait-and-see attitudd to see
how this develops. (Sce KEXICO CITY-8213.) .

E. Subject of HMMA-35872; Via LIFEAT, ‘LLENTRAP,
and the LIEMBRACEs, the Station identified a {Mexican
student contact of LIRING. Background information-

ZEPEDA apparently also visited Comsunist China. He appears

the Station instructed ROBTON to ask LIRING-3 to refrain from
attempting to use ZEPEDA to obtain a “bootleg” copy of the

Subject: | LIRING/3 Report of Méeting with LIRING/9.

A. LIRING/3 reported to Rowton at 0915 on 27/11/é5 that he had ‘met with
L1xig/9 at the LIRING estabdlinhment frea about 4745 until 1900 on 26/11/68.

Ee stated that he gave LIK1"G/9 bis written report on his recent experiences

in Guatemala and the conclusions be drew from talking with PAR jeabers there.
1/3 also stated that he did his best to assure 1/$ that, aithough he sympathized
with the laments of the Leén Earrios brothers, te was really on the PBXUMEN
side and offered to do all he could to assist the-IhINGs in their attexpts to
assist the revolutionary forces. The following is Rowton's reconstruction of
the conversation, based on iIZING/3's report:

L/3: "I'm sorry to be late, but I bad to finish the report."
L/9: “Alright. I've been waiting here at the gate so there wouldn't
be any furtner delay. Let's go to my office so we cen a pri-

sststs.*

Upon entering office, 1/9 reroves jacket and offers 1/3 a seat in the
office.

1/3: “Well, here's my report, I must apologize that it's in rough draft
form. I had to write it rather hurriedly when my vife was not around.

: It's really just a series of badly organized thoughts and ideas but

i I'll be glad to explain. There's a great deal more, of course, that

i I could explain on the subject. Do you wish me to read it?"

H L/9: "Ko, that's alright. i

1/9 glences through the report and continues: i

"I'll read it carefully later. I really didn't expect uch @ lone
report. I appreciate it. In the meantine, how are you dobng in your
personal effairs??

L/3: “#ell, as I told you last time, I'm very much up in tae air at. the

-moent. My exposition has started but is nct going as/well as can be

expected - as well as I had hoped. You know, these weld oa their

up's and down's. I'll sell soze things, at least to gover my current

expenses, but I'll really have to get better organized financially

in the near future. The first problem that I'm really worried about

pees “ds my wife, and I frankly feel that I gust appeal ae for help.

"Of course. Well, what is the problem?”

“AS you aro, some time ago my wife and I had a serits of unpleasant

situations that alsost led to a separation..”

I/3 (who had eiven the original letter to Rovton) stalled pro-

mising to produce the letter on 10 January ir the presence of her

husband. 1/3 told Rowton that when he atterptedé to contact Iden B

and her husband by phone on the morning of 10 January, he found

the phone constantly busy and suspects that the receiver was

left purposely off the hcok. 7
(b) On the evering of 12 January,1969, Arturo Serrano of the CPM,
visited L12I;G/3 at his hore and tolc nim that the Central Conm-
mittee of the CPM had discussed his feud with Identity A ’
in response. to the letter LIRING/3 had sent to it alleging that
Iden A was malicning hir unjuetiy. Serrano continued that the
CC of the CFM had found the letter too vague to sake any sense,
but in any case cculd not take Iden A seriously, Serrano told
L/3 that Iden A and = Identity B vhad been recently formally
expelled fron the party for ideolocicel reasons, but still had a
number of friends willing toe voueh for them. On tae! other hand
Serrano stated that the CC of the Crm had received {nformation
"some tine avo" from the LizinG office alleging that LIRING/3 had
been actine in a suspicious manner, esp2cially with)regard to cer=
tain information he bad provided concerring Julién Lépes that
“could not tave come from a source other than the police." Serrano
continued that although the CrM had no love for the|LIRING office
it nevertheless hsd to take such a report into consideration and
the burdea of proéf was really on LIRI.G/3. I

two "very important" letters to FP: N throuc: friends who could
bypess the usual censorship. L/3 promised to io what he coulé end asxed
Vega to deliver tne letters tohim on 25 January. |

3. Because of the obvious possibility of provecation in this rather
unexplaized behavior of Carlos Vega ( he originally told 1/3 that te
was a close friend of Identity A ), Rowton azreed with ‘1/3 thet
no attempt should be made to open the letters eri shat they should
be delivered ;rozptly to the LIKING office for snatever dispositicn

Serrano,as a friend, advised L/3 to “taxe the bull by the |
horns” and send as such data as possitle to defend himself

to all “icportaxt progressive" orgenizations. Ze volunteered

to pass a copy of the letter from Harta Barrios to the CEM and
1/3's version of the arrest and detention as scon as he had pre-
pared it.

general director of CONASLPO, who aparently hed political ambitions.

3. Rowton suggested that 1/3 get in tocch with Zepeda not only to determine

relationship with the CPH and the LIRING office, if any. :
