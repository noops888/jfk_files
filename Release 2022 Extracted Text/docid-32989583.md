MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

The telephone surveillance on the [national head-
quarters of the Black Panther Part¥]which was authorized on
February 4, 1969, has proved to be most valuable. It has

rovided information concerning the planned establishment of
Black Panther Party branches at Eugene, Oregon; Fresno,
California; the Watts area of Los Angeles, California;
Syracuse, New York; Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; and Columbus,
Ohio. It provided information concerning the removal of
Joudan Ford from his leadership position in the New York City,
branch and, most recently, has furnished details concerning
the travel of National Chairman Bobby George Seale to the
Scandinavian countries where Seale is at the present time.

Live informants are furnishing information indicat-
‘ ing that the organization will increasingly use underground
methods of operation which further emphasizes the desirability
of obtaining additional coverage to supplement data being
furnished by our live informants,

It is requested that authority be granted for
telephone surveillances on the] Black Panther Party headquarters
at 4115 South Central Avenue, Los Angeles, and on the Black
Panther Party office at 2026 7th Avenue, New York city or on
any other places to which they may move. :

MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

RE: REQUEST FOR NATIONAL SECURITY
ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE

I hereby request, that you, on behalf of the
President of _the United States, authorize a telephone surveil-
lance on the[ National Office of the Young Lords Party (YLP)
at 202 East 117th Street, New York City.

The YLP is a militant Puerto Rican youth group patterned
, | after the Black Panther Party. In addition to several branches
in New York City, there are YLP branches in Bridgeport,
Connecticut; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Puerto Rico. ee
According to its 13-Point Program and Platform, the
; YLP is a revolutionary political party fighting for the
liberation of all oppressed people, seeks self-determination
for Puerto Ricans' liberation, and believes armed self-defense
and armed struggle are the only means to liberation. It cites
the Castro revolution in Cuba as an example of the right of the
people to destroy a government which oppresses them and of the
importance for all true revolutionaries to, have definite plans.

Major confrontations with police authorities erat
in New York City during 1969 and 1970 when armed YLP members

and sympathizers forcibly occupied a Harlem church for an
extended period. During the current month agitational activity
of YLP members and sympathizers precipitated serious civil
disturbances in New York City and Bridgeport, Connecticut.

One YLP leader, Rafael Viera, reportedly is an associate of
lyarious suspects in the Capitol bombing investigation.

Panther Party may be evicted from its headquarters in the near ~_
future and, if so, (certer's}residence ~would undoubtedly be used,
at least temporarily, as a headquarters to conduct Los Angeles
Black Panther Party business. As you are aware, the Black
Panther Party is a black extremist violence-prone_ organization.
The Los Angeles, California, chapter has been oné of its most
active chapters.

A surveillance of [carter's}telephone would be a
valuable supplement to the telephone surveillance on Los Angeles
Black Panther Party headquarters which you initially approved _.
on March 20, 1969, and renewed for a three-month period on
September 8, 1969. This coverage has provided invaluable
information not available through other sources.

A surveillance on|Carter's]telephone might furnish a
valuable insight into the current power struggle between factions
of the Los Angeles Black Panther Party in which the subject is

‘prominently involved. In view of ther. feurrent position, [she] will
undoubtedly be contacted on matters of planning and policy. For
the same reason {she should be in contact with numerous individuals
who are actively engaged in Black Panther Party activities in”

an underground capacity. : if

It is requested authority be granted for a surveillance
on the telephone at (Evon Carter's apartment located at 2728
Ellendale Place, Apartment_3, Los Angeles, California] Inter-
ception will be away from [her] residence and no trespass is.
involved. If the coverage proves productive, it will be con-

_ The National Steering Committee of the “ALDCC has
‘ designated Howard Lamar Fuller as Chairman. Members of the-
National Steering Committee include Huey P. Newton, LeRoi Jones,
and RooSevelt Bernard Douglas. Statements of endorsement of
the ALDCC have been received from Stokely Carmichael and
‘H. Rap Brown. :

Fuller is President of the Malcolm X Liberation — Z
University in Greensboro, North Carolina, and during an
address February 23, 1972, before a group of 200 people
at Howard University, Washington, D. C., he stated there
_ would be no change in this society without revolution and
. that basic changes should be 3 in political and economic
structures.

The April 1, 1972, issue of ae a Canadian |
newspaper self-identified as serving the black community,,
disclosed Fuller reportedly visited Africa during the Fail
of 1971 and made contact with liberation army leaders, He
spent approximately 45 days among fighters under battle
conditions and was urged upon his return to the United States
to mobilize "brothers and sisters" in demonstrations to protest
United States and Canadian involvement in Southern Africa.

: “Huey P. Newton is the leader of the Black Panther
Party and the March, 1972, issue of a national publication
quotes Newton as saying, "Armed struggle is still my belief,
and always will be. We have to get it to that point. We're
building and organizing an army to finally get people to the
point where we'll fight, because we believe that the only way
we will resolve the final contradiction is through armed
struggle." :

In his book, "Raise, _Race, Rays, Raze, Essays Since
1965" published in 1971, LeRoi’ Jones stated Newark "never
seemed as beautiful as it did those nights when fire was

must be Black ruled or they will not be ruled at all....
Unless we Black people can come into peaceful power and
begin the benevolent rule of the just, the next phase of
_armed rébellion will burn Newark to the ground."

With regard to Roosevelt Bernard Douglas, a
. West Indian now residing in Canada, it is noted he was
convicted in April, 1971, of charges in connection with a
oy, “student riot in Montreal, Canada, during January and

“During public speeches made in 1967 throughout the
United States, H. Rap Brown has called for "rebellion by any
Gaal and "massive civil disobedience."

Ina speech at. the University. of Hawaii” October 31,

BLACK PANTHER PARTY (BPP)

According to the official newspaper of the Black
Panther Party (BPP), the BPP was started during December, 1966,
in Oakland, California, to organize black people so they can
take control of the life, politics, and the destiny of the black
community, It was organized by Bobby G, Seale, BPP Chairman,
and(Huey P. Newton, Minister of Defensé.]

The official newspaper, ‘The Black Panther," has
regularly stated that the BPP advocates the use of guns and
guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression
of the black people, Residents of the black community are urged
to arm themselves against the police, consistently referred to
as "pigs,'' who should be killed, -

The newspaper, in its issue of September 7, 1968, had
-an article by the then Minister of Education, George Murray.
This article ended with the following:

"Black men, Black people, colored persons of America,
revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves, The only culture
worth keeping is revolutionary culture, Change. Freedom
everywhere, Dynamite! Black power. Use the gun, Kill
the pigs everywhere,"

The BPP néwspaper, issue of October 5, 1968, had an
article introduced with the following statement: 'We will not
dissent from American government, We will overthrow it,"

David Hilliard, Chief of stafé, BPP, in a speech at
the San Francisco Polo Field on November 15, 1969, said, ''We A
will kill Richard Nixon."

David Hilliard, in 'The New York Times," issue of
December 13, 1969, was quoted as follows: "We advocate the

very direct overthrow of the government by way of force and i
violence."

In the issue of April 25, 1970, the BPP newspaper
had an article by Minister of Culture Emory Douglas as follows:

"The only way to make this racist U. S. government administer
justice to the people it is oppressing, is ... by taking FI
up arms against this government, killing the officials, j
until the reactionary forces 1... are dead, and those that
are left turn their weapons on their superiors, thereby
passing revolutionary judgement against the number one
enemy of all mankind, the racist U. S. government,"

The BPP headquarters is located at 1046 Peralta Street,
Oakland, California, Branches of the BPP and Committees to
Combat Fascism, under control of the BPP, have been established
“in various locations in the United States,

Newton exercises autocratic control of BPP national
headquarters and through national headquarters all of the BPP
branches. He rules from his apartment at 1200 Lakeshore
Boulevard, Oakland, California, issuing instructions by telephone

dd holding policy conferences in the apartment, —

The BPP established an international section at
Algiers, Algeria, in 1969, through which it maintained liaison
with Algeria, Red China, North Korea, North Vietnam, and other
communist~dominated governments, In February, 1971,

Eldridge Cleaver, then BPP Minister of Information, in self-
imposed exile in Algeria, and about 100 followers split from
the Newton dominated BPP national headquarters, One member of
each opposing faction has been murdered with each faction
accusing the other of the murders,

At this time it has not been firmly established which
of the two factions the various communist governments will
support. i

- As recent as June 30, 1971, a BPP spokesman stated
that the ultimate goal of the BPP is the complete destruction
of the United States Government and its replacement with

Since the installation. of these. surveillances, ©
information has been developed, ‘on a daily. basis, regarding
plans, movements and activities:of ‘individuals responsible
for the massive demonstration in Washington, D.C., on April 24; .
1971, and who plan violence and civil disobedience during :

group planned to break away from the.massive demonstratiém: :

over the South Vietnamese Embassy: by way-of Dupont Circle. ~
This information enabled the Metropolitan Police Department
. to effectively block Dupont.Circle well in advance-of the

this coverage developed information regarding a schism which
developed between the (National Peace Action. ( Coaliti iC) 4

The period which offers the greatest potential for

MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

In carrying out the Marxist-Leninist ideology of the
Progressive Labor Party} |Worker Student Alliancéymembers have
repeatedly sought to become involved in tabor disputes on the
side of labor, join picket lines and engage in disruptive
and sometimes violent tactics against industry recruiters on
college campuses. For example, on February 18, 1970, several
thousand demonstrators protested the presence of General Electric
recruiters on the University of Michigan campus. / Worke
Student-ALljance\menbers were included in the iat p of
this demonstration which snowballed into city-wide violence
and extensive damage occurred to banks and police cars in
the areas,

This faction is currently very active in many of the
major demonstrations and student violence on college campuses.
It is making all-out efforts to assume leadership in the anti-
war movement and is in the forefront of organizations
maintaining steady agitation to stop military recruitment and
abolish the Reserve Officers' Training Corps; .- During the current
academic year over five hundred campus demonstrations have
taken place. Over two thousand arrests have been made and there
have been forty-one cases of attempted arson and four cases
of bombing. Nearly two million dollars in damages have been
inflicted to college facilities, 7

Last summer worker, Student Alliance had a(Summer
Work-In project designed to infiltrate industry and it has
made plans to rejuvenate this project this summer. /Worker ‘
Student Allianceyleaders have repeatedly encouraged action against
ndustrial Concerns, both off and on campus with General Electric
being the main target. New Left advocates are believed to be
responsible for the bombing of General Electric offices in
New York City on February 7, 8, 1970. On March 11, 1970,
powerful bombs also destroyed the offices of three major
corporations in New York City.

The leadership of (Worker Student Alliance) is extremely

security conscious at this time. Many of its leaders are
traveling throughout the United States, especially the South,
in an effort to promote the aims of the group, as well as
directing agitation against universities and industry.

A telephone surveillance on the national headquarters
