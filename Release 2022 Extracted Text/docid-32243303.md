Assassination Records Review Board

Final Determination Notification

AGENCY : HSCA

RECORD NUMBER : 180-10068-10337

RECORD SERIES : STAFF PAYROLL RECORDS

AGENCY FILE NUMBER

December 8, 1995

Status of Document:

Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 8

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors

including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United

States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 6

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could

reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of

privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

Substitute Language: SSN

INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING FEDERAL EMPLOYEES' NOTICE OF

INJURY OR OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE, CA-1 & 2

IMPORTANT: Employee and official superior should read all of the following instructions before the

page is removed.

Items 1 through 16 of this form should be completed by the injured employee or by someone

acting

on his behalf, whenever an injury is sustained in the performance of duty. The term in-

jury includes occupational disease caused by the employment. The form should be given to the em.

ployee's official superior within 48 hours following the injury. The official superior is that indi-

vidual having responsible supervision over the employee.

• In instances of a recurrence of disability resulting

an injury previously reported on form

CA-1 & 2, the official superior should complete and

submit form CA-2a.

The official superior will complete the

"Receipt of Notice of Injury" at the bottom of this page, tear

off the page, and give it to the employee. The official superior will also be responsible for obtaining

the statement of a witriess (it any), signature, and date, in items 17, 18 and 19 on the front of

A brief description of benefits provided by the Federal Employees' Compensation Act is given on

INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING OFFICIAL SUPERIOR'S

REPORT OF INJURY OR OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE, CA-1 & 2

The back of form CA-1 & 2 should be completed by the employee's official superior. The form should

be sent immediately to the Office of Federal Employees' Compensation servicing the employing es-

tablishment if:

1. The injury causes disability for the employee's usual work beyond the shift it occurred, or

2. It appears that the injury will result in prolonged treatment, permanent disability or serious

disfigurement of the head, face or neck, or

3. It appears that the injury will result in

a charge for medical. or other related expense.

If none of the above occurs or appear likely to occur, the form should be

filed in the employee's

official personnel file after the official superior completes the "Receipt of Notice of Injury' and

gives it to the employee.

When additional information is required to explain or clarify any point, attach supplemental state-

ments to the form. The form should then be sent to the appropriate office of the Bureau. For fur-

ther information, see the regulations governing the administration of the Federal Employees' Com-

pensation Act (Code of Federal Regulations Title 20 Chapter 1).

DISABILITY BENEFITS FOR EMPLOYEES UNDER THE FEDERAL

EMPLOYEES' COMPENSATION ACT

The Federal Employees' Compensation Act ad-

ministered by the Office of Federal Employees'

Compensation (OFEC) provides the following

basic disability benefits for employment related

injuries or occupational diseases:

1.

Full medical care.

Compensation is not paid automatically-an em.

ployee or someone acting on his behalf must

claim it by filing OFEC form CA-4. This form

may be obtained from the employing establish-

ment or the OFEC. In practically all cases medical

reports are required before compensation may

be paid, therefore arrangements should be made

to have medical reports submitted to the OFEC

at the earliest possible date.

2.

Payment of compensation for wage

loss.

3.

Payment of compensation for perma-

nent impairment of certain members

or functions of the body (such as loss

or loss of use of an arm,

loss of

hearing, etc.) or for serious

disfig-

urement of the head, face or neck:

4. Vocational rehabilitation and related

services where necessary.

Medical care must be obtained from United States

medical officers and hospitals when available and

practicable. Otherwise, from any duly qualified

private physician or hospital of the employee's

choice. Qualified physicians may be used only if

U.S. or designated medical facilities are not avail

able, or if an emergency exists.

Compensation is paid by check sent to the em.

ployee's home mailing address. Compensation

for wage loss is payable only for periods when

an employee is in a non-pay status. The first

three days in a non-pay status are waiting days

and no compensation is paid for these days un-

less the period of disability exceeds 21 days or

the employee has suffered a permanent disabil.

ity. Compensation is generally paid at the rate

of 2/3 of an employee's salary if he has no.

dependents, or 3/4 of his salary if he has one

or more dependents.

If an employee stops

work

as a result of an

employment related injury or occupational dis-

ease, he may:

1. Use sick and/or annual leave, or

2. Receive compensation from the OFEC.

Before compensation may be paid, the OFEC must

receive form CA-1 & 2; form CA-4; and medical

evidence concerning the nature and causal re-

lationship of the injury. Medical reports must

cover initial examination and the employee's con-

dition at the time claim for compensation is

filed. In addition, if a case involves some com.

plication or conflicting information, it.-may be

necessary to obtain supplemental information.

An employee: or someone acting on his behalf

must complete the front of the form CA-l &

2 and file it within one year after the injury or

disease occurs. However, under certain circum-

stances, the OFEC may waive the one-year re-

quirement if the front of the CA-1 & 2 is com-

pleted

and the form filed within five years.

If an employee is in doubt about his compensa:

tion benefits, he may write to the Office of Federal

Employees' Compensation servicing the employ.

ing establishment. (Obtain the address of the

OFEC office from the employing establishment).
