RECORD SERIES : STAFF PAYROLL RECORDS

AGENCY FILE NUMBER :

December 8, 1995
Status of Document: Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 8

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors
including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the
absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United
States or to any. individual.

Number of Postponements: 6

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could
reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of
privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING FEDERAL EMPLOYEES’ NOTICE OF
INJURY OR OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE, CA-1 & 2

IMPORTANT: Employee and official superior should read all of the following instructions before the
page is removed.

Items 1 through 16 of this form should be completed by the injured employee or by someone
acting on his behalf, whenever an injury is sustained in the performance of duty. The term in-
jury includes occupational disease caused by the employment. The form should be given to the em-
ployee's official superior within 48 hours following the injury. The official superior is that ind
vidual having responsible supervision over the employee.

In instances of a recurrence of disability resulting from. an injury previously reported on form
CA-1 & 2, the official superior should complete and submit form CA-2a.

The official superior will complete the “Receipt of Notice of Injury’ at the bottom of this page, tear
off the page, and give it to the employee. The official superior will also be responsible for obtaining
the statement of a witness (if any), signature, and date, in items 17, 18 and’19’on the front of
the form.

A brief description of benefits provided by the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act is given on
the back of this page. .

INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING OFFICIAL SUPERIOR'S
REPORT OF INJURY OR OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE, CA-1 & 2

The back of form CA-1 & 2 should be completed by the employee's official superior. The form should
be sent immediately to the Office of Federal Employees’ Compensation servicing the employing es-
tablishment if:

1. The injury causes disability for the employee's usual work beyond the shift it occurred, or

2. It appears that the injury will result in prolonged treatment, permanent disability or serious
disfigurement of the head, face or neck, or

3. It appears that the injury will result in a charge for medical or other related expense.
If none of the above occurs or appear likely to occur, the form should be filed in the employee's

official personnel file after the official superior completes the “Receipt of Notice of Injury’ and
gives it to the employee.

When additional information is required to explain or clarify any point, attach supplemental state.
ments to the form. The form should then be sent to the appropriate office of the Bureau. For fur-
ther information, see the regulations governing the administration of the Federal Employees’ Com-
pensation Act (Code of Federal Regulations Title 20 Chapter 1).

DISABILITY BENEFITS FOR EMPLOYEES UNDER THE FEDERAL
EMPLOYEES’ COMPENSATION ACT

The Federal Employees’ Compensation Act ad-
ministered by the Office of Federal Employees’
Compensation (OFEC) provides the following
basic disability benefits for employment related
injuries or occupational diseases:

- 1. Full medical care

| 2. Payment of compensation for wage
loss.

| 3. Payment of compensation for perma-
nent impairment of certain members
| . or functions of the body (such as loss
| or loss of use of an arm, loss of
| hearing, etc.) or for serious disfig-
urement of the head, face or neck,

| 4. Vocational rehabilitation and ‘related
services where necessary

Medical care must be obtained from United States
medical officers and hospitals when available and

private physician or hospital of the employee's
choice. Qualified physicians may be used only if
U.S. or designated medical facilities are not avail
able, or if an emergency exists. °°" 8"

: Compensation is paid by check sent to the em-
ployee’s home mailing address. Compensation
for wage loss is payable only for periods when
an employee is in a non-pay status. The first
three days in a non-pay status are waiting days
and no compensation is paid for these days un-
less the period of disability exceeds 21 days or
the employee has suffered a permanent disabil-

| ity. Compensation is generally paid at the rate

of 2/3 of an employee's salary if he has no:
dependents, or 3/4 of his salary if he has one
| or more dependents.

practicable. Otherwise, from any duly qualified |

Compensation is not paid automatically—an em:
ployee or someone acting on his behalf must
claim it by filing OFEC form CA-4. This form
may be obtained from the employing establish-
ment or the OFEC. In practically all cases medical
reports are required before compensation may
be paid, therefore arrangements should be made
to have medical reports submitted to the OFEC
at the earliest possible date.

If an employee stops work as a result of an
employment related injury or occupational dis-
ease, he may:

1. Use sick and/or annual leave, or

2. Receive compensation from the OFEC.

Before compensation may be paid, the OFEC must
receive form CA-1 & 2; form CA-4; and medical
evidence concerning the nature and causal re-
lationship of the injury. Medical reports must
cover initial examination and the employee's con-
dition at the time claim for compensation is
filed. In addition, if a case involves some com:
plication or conflicting, information; it~may be
necessary to obtain supplemental information.

An“employee*or someone acting-on his behalf
must complete the front of the form CA-1 &
2 and file it within one year after the injury or
disease occurs. However, under certain circum-
stances, the OFEC may waive the one-year re-
quirement if the front of the CA-1 & 2 is com-
pleted and the form filed within five years.

If an employee is in doubt about his compensa-
tion benefits, he may write to the Office of Federal
Employees’ Compensation servicing the employ
ing establishment. (Obtain the address of the
OFEC office from the employing establishment).
