when necessary recruitment and training will
be done inside Cuba either by established
agents or by agents infiltrated especially for
the task. Whether this is done unilaterally

organization is determined on a case by
case basis.

In some cases the travel as generated
‘specifically by CLA; in other cases the
travels can be utilized to meet intelligence
requirements. .

See 34 above.

CONSIDERATIONS

Due to local conditions and problems, the
Madrid Debriefing Center will continue to
be more limited in size and selective in
choice of refugees than Opa-locka. This
is primarily an NSA problem but CIA will
continue to assist as practicable.

PAA requires financial assistance to con-
tinue this activity.

It is recognized that significant increase in
coverage of the internal micro-wave system
would become a major budget and personnel
problem.

This is done on a regular basis by FBIS.

This will be handled through existing
liaison channels.
