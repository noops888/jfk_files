A check with the Dallas phone company ascertained

that the above telephone was installed 9/14/63 for a JAMES

ELLIOTT, Apartment 122 at 2901 Knight Street. Buagents

immediately checked the area, obtained the license numbers

of automobiles and ascertained that an Oldsmobile bearing

Texas license NH 8526, parked in the apartment parking lot,

was registered to the

subject.

A recheck of this same

area on 10/11/63, the Friday before one of the biggest

football weekends in dallas history, again ascertained

that POLLARD was at the apartment house. Dallas has

instituted investigation of POLLARD and

DAVIS to ascertain

if they are in violation of the Federal Anti-Gambling

Statute.

RE: GEORGE FREDERICK RECHENBERG, aka.

IGA

(DL 162-210)

On 10/7/63, DL 185-C-TE advised that subject

was operating as a bookmaker under telephone LA 8-0211.

CI stated that RECHENBERG would not actually take the bets

over the phone but had an associate to do so. Buagents

ascertained the phone was connected 8/26/63 in Apartment

203, at 3412 Eudnall and listed to ALFRED BLEDSOL..

Buagents checked the parking area at the apartment house,

obtained license numbers, and ascertained that a car bear-

ing Texas license NV 2625 and belonging to known Dallas

bookmaker NORVELL STANFIELD was parked at this apartment

house. Dallas will ascertain if STANFIELD and RECHENBERG

are in violation of Federal gambling statutes through

investigation.

RE: LAWRENCE PERKINS, aka.

ITWI

(DL 165-148)

Previously, DL 185-C-TE had furnished an

extensive amount of

information concerning the gambling

activities of PERKINS and his associates. PERKINS special-

izes in being brought into a set up card

game and through

his proficient card manipulating, he is able to win large

amounts of money from "suckers"

On 10/7/63 CI furnished

information how PERKINS had recently taken a Dallas

businessman for a large amount of money and that PERKINS

was closely associated with one RICHARD MELVIN. Informant

furnished entensive pertinent background information con-

cerning MELVIN which Buagents had been unable

to obtain

during prior investigation.

Dallas is instituting an

investigation of MELVIN, a

Dallas informant, to ascertain

if he is in violation of Federal statutes and as a

companion case with captioned matter.

On 10/7/63, PCI

MIKE LESCHETSKO advised that the Dallas businessman

had been taken by PERKINS for $25,000.

well as the CI, have both been alerted to advise Dallas

upon PERKINS'

return to the Dallas area.

RE: JOHN ELI STONE, aka; ET AL

ITWI

(DL 165-116)

DL 185-C-TE had previously identified one of

STONE's "runners" as a BILL JET ROGERS.

On 10/7/63,

CI furnished a description of this ROGERS, as well as

his place of employment.

Through confidential source

JEROME CRANE, Buagents were able to obtain more per-

tinent background information concerning ROGERS, and con-

template interviewing him concerning his knowledge concerning

STONE's activities in the near future.

CI advised that STONE, because of all the "heat"

on gambling activities in Dallas is not coming around to

his usual places at the present time but is using associate

ISADORE MAX MILLER.

This CI also advised that he had heard that a

man namedSHORTY MARONEY OF MALONEY, & WaCO,

Texas, gambler,

had died about two or three months previously. He further

stated that he was of the opinion that about three months

an alleged collector for STONE, had killed somebody and

money on him at that time and it was then that WILLIAM

RAY DAVIS, a known associate of MATTHEWS, told CI, "I

know the guy he planted for that", meaning the money.

RE: LEONARD LEE FITZGERALD, et al

ITWI"

(DL 165-101)

On 10/10/63, subject DAN BIRCH, following a

DL 94-55A-Sub

trial in Rockwall, Texas, on felony charges of operating

a gamblipg house, was found guilty by a jury and received

a two year suspended sentence.

BIRCH was the first of

six persons charged on these felony counts and it is

believed the other five will now plead guilty.

RE: CHARLES CLARENCE HILL;

JOSEPH "SOFIE" GEBRON, aka

ITWI

(DL 165-104)

On 10/7/63, DL 185-C-TE advised that GEBRON

was operating as a bookmaker for HILL and it was CI's

opinion they were accepting bets at a cleaning shop

they have recently opened on Ross Avenue (Phone TA 3-3180) •

On 10/7/63, PCI LESCHETSKO verified this stating that he

personally had placed bets with GIBRON. Dallas is

following this matter to ascertain if GEBRON and HILL

are in violation of a Federal statute.

None of the above information has been disse-

minated during the past week by the Dallas Division 'ex-

copt that concerning RUSSELL DOUGLAS MATTHEWS, as Bureau

interests are not secured at this time and dissemination

might possibly resut in compromises of both above

informants at this time. LT. JACK REVILL was furnished

information concerning

TE and he stated he would attempt to ascertain the

circumstances concerning the death of MARONEY Or MALONEY

at Waco.

LT. REVILL has asied that information concerning

the exact whereabouts of known bookmakers not be fur-

nished to him until such time as the Bureau does not have

any intorest in the activities of these men or does not

care whether they are raided and arrested.

He explained

that it he makes a record oi such information, the Vice

Squad will then receive instructions from their commander

to arrest these men at their place of operation. It is

the desire of the Dallas Office to ascertain if

bookmakers are in violation of the Federal statutes prior

to having them arrested.

arrest or activities by local authorities at this time

could possibly place the informants in jeopardy.
