: The HSCA Investigation of the Mexico City Station

1. The memorandum from Scott Breckinridge, attached hereto, dated

15 June, addresses only one aspect of our problem with the HolA.

It will seriously weaken our

ability to protect our country from Soviet intelligence activities.

intelligence activities in Mexico City.

This may not prove to be helpful

in dampening the ardor of the HCSA staff, but it most certainly will put

them on notice that the course they are taking will have direct repercussions

not only on CIA activities in Mexico City, but on our bilateral relations

with that country.
