2. In December 1944 William Clarence WOOD, JI.

was approved for duty with OSS in a writing/publishing assignment.

He did not serve with OSS, however, because he was assigned instead

to combat infantry duties in the Southwest Pacific. On 13 December

1950 he was cleared for duty on the island of Saipan as Chief Instructor

in Clandestine Operations. He arrived in Saipan in March 1951. A

year later he suffered a nervous breakdown and was returned to

Washington. Medical examination indicated that the breakdown had

been induced by family problems and overindulgence in alcohol.

Subject was assigned to our headquarters training component in

May 1952 as an instructor.

3. In December 1952 he was found lying on a sidewalk near

an Agency installation and at his own request was taken to Emergency

Hospital.. He failed to report for duty and in January 1953 was arrested

for drunkenness. On 27 January 1953 he resigned at the request of

CIA.

4. On I1 July 1953 WOOD telephoned to say that he was

scheduled for brain surgery in Dallas, Texas, on 13 July. He requested

that a ClA representative be present.

No surgery was performed, but

WOOD was given sodium pentothal in connection with a spinal tap.

While under the influence of sodium pentothal Subject said that he had

served overseas with CIA and had seen many people killed. He said

that CIA was a bunch of dirty cut-throats and that he would not be

surprised if they sent one of their men to cut his throat. He also said

that one day he would show CIA that he is smarter than they are. After

he got well, he would go back to school and get his degree and fight the

CIA with everything he had.

5. An FBI report from Dallas, Texas, 30 April 1957, showed

that Subject had telephoned long distance from Midland, Texas, to a

Chinat intelligence officer in Formosa, claimed former CIA employment,

and offered to "help you with things I know"'. Then he called a person

in Lubbock,

Texas,

who was believed to be his wife. Hc told hor that

he had talked with Chiang KAI-CHEK's intelligence representative in

Formosa and that she and the baby would receive $700 - $1000 a month

"if this thing goes through". (Ul)
