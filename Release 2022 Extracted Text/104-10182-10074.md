SUSJECT: Appraisal of Interrogation

, this attitude detracted from iris ctherwise seemingly genuine

manner and at least for me it "untered down" his attempt to generate

a repentant impression.

The subject readily answered questions and was extremely

friendly during both periods of interrogation.

Plottings and data,

however, by the subject on a blank to:un plan left him for homework

later proved disoriented.

The subject discovered his error during

our second meeting and volunteereá corrections.

3. As far as substantive intelligence gained is concerned

die interiogation provided data on a piani previously described

as possibly in the electronics business as a probable radar storage

and repair arer.

A hitherto unkrown naval installation as also

identified and located.

The pilot plant of the subject's emoloying

institute was identified and located in an area other than the one

previously assumed.

It can be said that if the subject's bond fides are

definitels established, positive intelligence gathered from him is

of real value.
