PART II SPECIFIC COMMENTS

1. Justification for Any Minus Ratings Given

SA Sentinella has been rated minus in connection

with his attitude because for 11 of the 13 months ending

5/31/60, he did not equitably share the work load of the

office.

This action on his part, since he was in a super-

visory capacity, apparently had some effect on other Agents

as 11 of the 18 Agents on his squad also failed to equit-

ably share the work load during the 3-month period ending

5/31/60. However, in this connection, it is noted he has

given his assurance that his future course of action will

leave no basis whatsoever for any similar situation.

2. Experience and Ability as Inspector's Aide

SA Sentinella has been

an approved Inspector's

Alde.

He has not assisted on any inspections during this

rating period, but prior thereto he served on several such

assignments and favorable comments have been received con-

derning

; his

performance in this regara.

3. Participation in Informant Programs

SA Sentinella is fully cognizant of the security

Informant Program and has made material contributions in that

regard in the past.

However, he has been supervising the

development of security-type informants.

4. Testifying Experience and Ability

Although this Agent has not had an opportunity to

testify during the rating period, he has appeared as a wit-

ness during his Bureau

career and has made a creditable showing.

5. DisciplInary Action

SA Sentinella has been removed as a Supervisor and

1s presently under transfer to the Atlanta Division.

very high level to show current communist activities in

relation to the Negro movement. It incorporates up-to date

Executive Commillee.

Discussion ot raclal matters was a

primary topic at the week-long meeting.

The enclosed article is a factual, documented

analyois of the over-all current situation.

the Central Intelligence Agency; Mr. Rusk, at the Department

of State; as well

as to Mr. McNamara and the three Armed Forces

intelligence agencies of the Defense Bepartment.

Accordingly,

In accordance with the Director's approval of our recommendation that

we prepare a special paper for select dissemination in captioned matter, we have

begun the necessary research for the preparation of the paper.

In this connection, it is important to note that the Communist Party is

planning to hold an important meeting of its National Executive Committee

October 1-5, 1900, with racial matters perunying a prominent place on the agencia.

We have instructed New York to give the meeting appropriate coverage and promptly

report results.

It is felt that the information we obtain from this coverage couid be very

pertinent to the paper we are going to prepare. In addition, the Party's most

current interests in the present racial situation as disclosed by our coverage of

the meeting will provide an excellent basis for the preparation and dissemination

of such a paper.

Therefore, unless advised to the contrary, we will proceed with the

preparation of the paper with the intention of including pertinent information we

obtain from the National Executive Committee meeting.

Predication:

Reference is made to the enclosed memorandum dated 9/16/63

and to the attached proposed SAC Letter.

On returning from a few days leave I have been advised of

the Director's continued dissatisfaction with the manner in which f

we prepared a Brief on the above-captioned matter and subsequent

memoranda on the same subject matter.

This situation is very

disturbing to those of us in the Domestic Intelligence Division!

responsible for this area of work, and we certainly want to do

everything possible. to correct our shortcomings.

We absolutely will

not be stubborn about admitting any mistakes we nave made ui be

stiff-necked and unbending concerning our analysis of this matter.

The Director indicated he would not approve our last SAC Letter

until there was a clarification and a meeting of minds relative to

the question of the extent of communist influence over Negroes and

their leaders. In this memorandum I will seriously and sincerely :

try to clarify a most regretable situation.

official office memorandum but rather on plain bond believing that

this discussion need not be made a matter of' official record..

Common Agreement:

First, I am sure we all are in agreement on the following

which was in both the cover memorandum and the detailed brief

attached:

(1)

for the past 44 years the Communist Party, USA,

has

spent enormous sums of money and ceaseless efforts to influence

Negroes and to make communists out of them; (2)

the 19 million

Negroes in the country today constitute the greatest single racial

target of the Communist Party, USA; (3) Negro leader Martin Luther

advisor Stanley Levison, a secret Communist Party member; (4)

are right now in this nation engaged in a form of social revolution

the time has never been so right for exploitation of the

Negroes by communist propagandists; and (5)

the Communist Party

could in the future make prodigious strides and great successes with

the American Negro to the serious detriment of our national security.

In addition to the above, the material furnished contained many pages

of specific examples of communist lolicies, programo ane

Memorandum for Mr. Belmont

RE:

COMMUNIST PARTY, USA

NEGRO QUESTION

COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN RACIAL MATTERS

showing communist involvement in Negro racial matters

relative to which we can all agree.

Essence of the Situation:

this nation,

The essence of the situation seems to be this:

We

presented what facts there are in our files in the Brief in question

and I know that the Director certainly would not want us to do other

than this. The position taken at the time the Brief was written was

that, while there is communist influence being exerted on Negroes

and Negro leaders, it has not reached the point of control or

domination. This

historically has been the position of the Bureau

in this matter in light o1 Ille revleWs going back ten to twenty

years. Lening this is net true with it

The Historical Position: to justicison tinfoset.

For example, in a detailed document prepared on Communist

Party and the Negro in 1953, we find the statement roferring to nobe

failure of the Communist Party to attract even

a significant number

of Negroes in the United States to its number." Another example is

to be found in an analysis in this same field prepared by the Bureau

in 1956 to the effect that communist efforts have been "unsuccessful

on a state or national level" in infiltrating "legitimate Negro-

fraternal, protest and improvement organizations," although they

limited success in some

"isolated chapters." The Director's book,

Masters of Deceit, published in 1958, states: "It became obvious

that the Party,

despite great efforts, had failed to win over even

a significant minority of Negroes." In 1960 the Director's statement

to" The Committee on the Judiciary,

United States Senate, reads:

"It is no secret that one of the bitterest disappointments of

comnunistic efforts in this Nation has been their failure to lure

our Negro citizens into the Party." In 1962 similar public statements

were made.

On page seven of the Brief submitted to the Director

under the date of August 23, 1963,

, this historical position was

restated and

it was said, "One of

the bitterest disappointments of

the conmunists has beén their single lailure to lure any significant

number of our Negro citizens into the Party," This statement was

set forth again in the cover memorandum which the Director marked.

The point I wish to make here is this:

The fact that this

has been our historical position in the Bureau for many years is no

reason to assume that it is

Director has clearly explained.

the correct position at this time,

as the

Times and conditions change

and, as

the evidence mounts, naturally we need to change our position along

with this evidence.

Interpretation:

As we know, facts by themselves are not too meaningful,

for they are somewhat like stones tossed in a

Leadership Conference, and in the comprehensive memorandum entitled

stated, we are in complete agreement with the Director that

communist influence is being exerted on Martin Luther King, Jr.,

As we have

stated before in a memorandum, we regard Martin Luther King to

Predication:

Reference is made to the enclosed memorandum dated 9/16/63

and to the attached proposed SAC Letter.

On returning from a few days leave I have been advised of

the Director's continued dissatisfaction with the manner in which

we prepared a briet on the above-captioned matter and subsequent !!

memoranda on the same subject matter.

This situation is very

disturbing to those of us in the Domestic Intelligence Division:

responsible for this area of work, and we certainly want to do

cvorything possihle to correct our shortcomings.

We absolutely will

not be stubborn about admitting any mistakes we nave naue ur ve

stiff-necked and unbending concerning our analysis of this matter.

The Director indicated he would not approve our last SAC Letter

until there was a clarification and a meeting of minds relative to

the question of the extent of communist influence over

Negroes and

their leaders. In this

memorandum I will seriously and sincerely

try to clarify a most regretable situation. It is prepared not on

-oilicial office memorandum but rather on plain bond believing that

this discussion need not be made a matter of official record..

Common Agreement:

First, I am sure we all are in agreement on the following

which was in both

the cover memorandum and the detailed brief

attached: (1) for the past 44 years the Communist Party, USA, has

spent enormous sums of money and ceaseless efforts to influence

Negroes and to make communists out of them; (2)

the 19 million

Negroes in the country today constitute the greatest single racial

target of the Communist Party, USA; (3) Negro leader Martin Luther

King, reported to be a Marxist, does have as an extremely important

advisor Stanley Levison,

a secret Communist Party member; | (4)

we

are right now in this nation engaged in a form of social-revolution

and the time has never been so right for exploitation of the

Negroes by communist propagandists; and (5)

the Communist Party

could in the future make prodigious strides and great successes with

the American Negro to the serious detriment of our national security.

In addition to the above, the material furnished contained many pages

of specific examples of communist policies, pragrant ani activities

RE:

NEGRO QUESTION

COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN RACIAL MATTERS

showing communist involvement in Negro racial matters

in this sation,

relative to which we can all agree.

Essence of the Situation:

The essence of the situation seems to be this: He

presented what facts there are in our files in the Brief in question

and I know that the Director certainly would not want us to do other

than this. The position taken at the time the Brief was written was

that, while there is communist influence being exerted on Negroes

and Negro leaders, it has not reached the point of control or

domination. This

in this matter in light of file reviews going back ten to twenty

The Bistorical Position:

For example, in a detailed document prepared on Communist

Party and the veern in 1953, we find the statement roferring to "the

Iailure of the Communist Party to attract even a significant number

oi Negroes in the United States to its number."

Another example is

to be lound in an analysis in this same field prepared by the Bureau

in 1956 to the effect that communist efforts have been "unsuccessful

a state or national level" in infiltrating "legitimate Negro-

Iraternal, protest and improvement organizations," although they made

limited success in some "isolated chapters."

The Director's book,

Masters of Deceit, published in 1958, states: "It became obvious

that the Party, despite great eiforts, had failed to win over even

a significant minority of Negroes."

In 1960 the Director's statement

to The Committee on the Judiciary,

United States Senate, reads:

"It is no secret that one of the bitterest disappointients of

comnunistic efforts in this Nation

has been their failure to lure

our Negro citizens into the Party." In 1962 similar public statements

were made.

On page seven of the Brief submitted to the Director

under the date of August 23, 1963, this historical position was

restated and it was said, "One of the bitterest disappointments of

the communists has been their single failure to lure any significant

number of our Negro citizens into the Party." This statement was

set forth again in the cover memorandum which the Director marked.

The point I wish to make here is this: The fact that this

has been our historical position in the Bureau for many years is no

reason to assume that it is the correct position at this time,

as the

¡Director has clearly explained. Times and conditions change and, as

the evidence mounts, naturally we need to change our position along

with this evidence.

On July 16, 1963, an official of this Bureau

occasion, Mir. Kennedy said he was considering the

possibility of a telephone surveillance of King because

of King's communist associations. He was advised by

the Bureau official that since King was in travel status

practically all the time, the productivity of such a

surveillance was doubtful and he was asked to consider

the repercussions if it ever became known that such a

surveillance had been instituted on King. Mr. Kennedy

said he was not concerned about possible repercussions

and that he thought it advisable to have as complete

coverage as possible in view of the possible communist

influence in the racial situation.

This relates to your letterhead memorandum

•of September

5 to the Atiorney General, relating 10/

Hunter Pitts ODell and the related prior memoranda:

I appreciaie your having sent copies of these to me.

This matter had been broughi to the actention

of DIs King some time

ago by me, but in accordance

with conversations which the Attorney General

had with Couriney Evans.

it was not

felt to be wise

in view of the sources of the Bureau's informa

tion to siic that I knew ODell to be under Communist

influence os control at any time.

I did inform

Di. King and two members of his organization

Reverend Andrew Young and Reverend Wyatt Walker

some time ago .. that since ODell was believed by

many people io have had Communisi connections,

his

association with

their organization was not in the

best interests of the organization.

At that time,

inconclusive steps were taken

to remove ODell, and his job with the southern

Christian Leadership Conference was

changed

In

response to direct questions whether I had hard evidence

of ODell's Communisi connections, however: I replied

thai I was not in a position to give any.

Following fuither conversations with

Evans in June, however, I brought the matter to the

atiention of Di. King very explicitly in my office

the morning

of June 22 prior to a scheduled meeting

which Die King had with the President.

This was

the direction of the Attoiney Generals

Later thai morning both the Attorney General and

DI. King stated that the connection would be

Thereafter, the Attorney General

and I

both received copies of the attached letter, dated

July 3, 1963, from DI: King to O Dell.

On the

same occasion, I also informed Di.

King that

OUT

was that Stanley Levison

was a secrei member of the Communist Party.

This was also done after conversations with Mi. Evans

to the meeting with Di. King, and

was done at

the direction of the Attorney General and the

to that. time, again based upon

Attorney General and Mr. Evans at

which I was present, it had been decided that it

was not in the best interest of the United states to

inform Di. King that ve had any firm information

that Levison was under Communist contiol!

howevel, on a previous

occasion, warned Dr. King

about any association with Levison, basing the

warning upon doubis about Levison's loyalty to the

United States.

I thought you should have this additional

De Loach to Mohr 11-18-64

Re: Sarah McClendon, Background Briefing Sessions Group

Appointment with the Director, 10:00 a.Mo, 11-18-64

Miss Nonberg interrupted the Director's briefing to state that the reporter

would like to know, before continuing the briefing, just how the Director achieved the

success he had over the years. The Director replied by giving a brief resume of his

career. He spoke highly of the personnel in the FBI and of the devoted and dedicated

service of our personnel. He spoke of giving positions to wives of Agents who had been

killed in the line of duty. He mentioned that he personally presented service keys to

personnel who had completed 25, 30, 35 and 40 years in the FBI's service. The Director

told of his policies with respect to the fact that male clerks are encouraged to attend

college. He mentioned the good experience given on'the tour route to male clerks.

The Director outlined the structure of the FBI to the reporters. He

mentioned the 56 offices and the 10 foreign offices. He described the foreign offices as

liaison listening posts. He mentioned that FBI foreign offices have excellent liaison with

their opposite numbers who represent other countries. He briefly described the FBI's

liaison section and the fact that meeting other government personnel on a man-to-man

basis promoted efficiency. He stated this prevented a flood of memoranda between

government agencies.

The Director told the reporters that the FBI has jurisdiction over

approximately 170 violations. This is the largest number handled by any government

additional jurisdiction each year. He stated he does not want the FBI to get larger and

that he shudders now when he realizes that we have approximately 15, 000 employees.

The Director gave as an example of increase in jurisdiction the incident wherein the late

Senator Pat McCarran insisted that the FBI be given enforcement jurisdiction over the

theft of cattle being taken interstate.

As a further example of increase in jurisdiction, the Director mentioned

the kidnaping statute and the fact that the Weinberger case caused the

Congress to reduce the presumptive clause to 24 hours rather than the 7 day rule. The

Director explained that sometimes when we do a good job we are penalized because

Congress increases our burdens.

The Director stated that rather than burdening the FBI, the Congress and

the general public should look to strengthening local law enforcement.

In this regard,

the Director stated he had been more or less of a "states rightist" all of his life. He

added that local law enforcement should be stronger with respect to enforcing violations.

He stated that local communities should look after their own violations rather than

causing the Federal Government to infringe upon them. In some instances, however,

local authorities are not anxious to enter investigations of civil rights type.

The Director

stated that the trouble in Mississippi and many parts of the South over the past 3 years

was partially the fault of the Justice Department because of the "harsh approach" used

in promoting civil rights.

Deloach to Mohr 11-18-64

Re: Sarah McClendon, Background Briefing Sessions Group

Appointment with the Director, 10:00 a. Mo, 11-18-64

The Director briefly discussed his trip to Mississippi and his meeting with

Governor Johnson. The Director stated that Governor Johnson had forthrightly indicated

he was a "segregationist," however, he did not believe in bloodshed, violence or

violation of the laws. The Director

stated he had explained the reasons for his

appearance in Mississippi and, as a result, he and Governor Johnson had gotten along

extremely well together.

Because of the common meeting ground, the Federal Govern-

ment had a good relationship with Governor Johnson as of today.

The Director stated it was sometimes difficult to obtain convictions in

southern civil rights cases. He stated he thought that our case in Georgia in which

Colonel Lemuel Penn had been murdered had been "foolproof. " He explained that the

subjects in this case had talked among themselves that they were going to "kill a Nigger"

and that without knowing the identity of Colonel Penn they had wilfully murdered the first

stranger they had come across. The Director stated a confession had been obtained in

this case, but despite this fact, the jury acquitted all of the defendants and then later

shook hands with them. The Director stated this, of course, was absolutely outrageous.

The Director described the Atlanta, Georgia, Police Department under

Sheriff Jenkins as one of the best in the country. He added,

however, that when a persen

goes back in the hill country of Georgia or Mississippi he finds numerous water moccasins

rattlesnakes and redneck sheriffs. He added that Mississippi probably has some good

sheriffs and that he wanted to make it clear that the Mississippi Highway Patrol was an

outstanding organization who had been very cooperative. The Director added that we had

trained a number of representatives of the Mississippi Highway Patrol at the specific

request of Governor Johnson and that our next National Academy class would have

additional representatives in attendance.

The Director told the reporters that there had been less than 1, 000

employees in the FBI when he became Director. He stated he had always insisted that

our Agents be above average, in appearance, education and ability. He explained that

these qualities were prerequisites to men handling themselves adequately, particularly

in court. He stated that forthrightness was always needed in law enforcement. He added

that a man can be a good investigator yet present a bad impression because of his

personal appearance.

The Director stated that a real fetish with him was the fact that many

people thought that the FBI both investigated and prosecuted. He stated that the FBi does

not recommend; we merely set forth the facts; we do not reach conclusions. The

Department of Justice handles prosecutions.

Re: SARAH McClendon, Background Briefing Sessions Group

Appointment with the Director, 10:00 a. Mo, 11-18-64

The Director explained that during the last fiscal year the FBI obtained

I2, 191 convictions. He stated that 96. 5 % of the defendants brought to trial in FBI

cases were convicted. 91% of these defendants pled. guilty.

Fines,savings

and

recoveries amounted to $210, 771, 402. This represents an excess of $24 million over

the previous year. During the current fiscal year the FBI is running ahead in this same

category. For every dollar spent in the expense of running the FBI, we return to the

taxpayer approximately $1. 43. The FBI apprehended 12, 810 fugitives during the past

fiscal year.

At this point the Director briefed the reporters concerning the "Top Ten"

program and specifically placed emphasis on the tremendous cooperation given to us by

the Nation's communications media. The Director stated it was an accepted fact in the

underworld that once a criminal is placed on the "Top Ten" by the FBI he will definitely

be apprehended.

The Director next talked generally regarding organized crime. He stated

we have over 5, 000 investigations in progress today concerning this phase of our work.

This includes investigation of Cosa Nostra as well as gambling and other elements. The

Director told the reporters that up until this year the FBI had, for a long time, stated

that the cost of crime was $22 billion per year.

The cost is now $27 billion per year.

The Director stated the FBI has been successful in penetrating organized crime

syndicates. This includes Cosa Nostra. FBI successes have largely been based through

the usage of informants. He stated the informant is a very important and very necessary

element of our fight against crime. As an example, informants located 2, 600 criminals

during the last fiscal year. Over $7 million in contraband was located. The Director

categorized informants as truly patriotic individuals. He stated that many informants are

not paid but are willing to work because of their patriotic beliefs®

The Director stated he vigorously opposed a national police system in the

United States. He added that a "clearinghouse" established by the Federal Government

would be a step in this direction. He stated this was not needed. He explained that

during the past fiscal year the FBI furnished over 187, 000 items of information to the

local police.

This cooperation enabled local authorities to make over 3, 000 arrests and

to recover millions of dollars in merchandize.

The Director hit the idea of a "clearing-

house" once again. He stated we must be realistic in understanding that some police

are crooked. He added that some local law enforcement authorities are on the payroll of

Cosa Nostra. He explained that some individuals backing the idea of a "clearinghouse"

represent the type of person who wants to play "cops and robbers." He stated that if

local authorities are honest they can obtain information from the FBI. If they are not

honest they do not receive this information. In one large Metropolitan area 400 gamblers

were arrested within the past two years as a result of information furnished by the FBI to

local authorities. In this particular area, however, we found it necessary to deal with

the County Attorney and not the local police in that city. In Youngstown, Ohio, there have

been 80 gangland bombings in the last 10 years. Approximately 2 years ago the FBI went

into Youngstown. As a result of our efforts, 37 racketeers have been indicted. The

Youngstown police are now showing more cooperation.

DeLeach to Mohr 11-18-64

Re: Sarah McClendon, Background Briefing Sessions Group

Appointment with the Director, 10:00 a. Mo, 11-18-64

The Director next spoke of crime in general. In 1963 there was an

increase of 10% in general crime; 2, 259, 000 serious crimes having been committed.

This exceeded the previous year by approximately 208, 000, Crime outpaced the growth

of population by a percentage of 5 to 1. The Director then gave statistics in various

categories to back up his facts.

The Director made reference to juvenile criminality. In explaining the

growth, he stated that persons under 25 years of age were responsible for 72% of crime

in the United States. He stated he was in violent disagreement with the "bleeding hearts"

or "pseudo liberals" who desire to raise the legal age of juveniles to 21 years of. age.

A more realistic approach would be to reduce the age to 16 years of age.

The Director presented statistics concerning auto theft. He spoke of

apathy and lethargy and gave as an example the incident of the young woman in New York

being murdered while 37 people looked on and did nothing about it. He spoke of the

undesirability of walking the streets of New York or Washington during the night hours.

He stated that Central Park in New York City was a variable jungle at night. He stated

there had been holdups on Fifth Avenue in New York after 9:30 p.m.

The Director made reference to recent riots in New York City and to the

fact that a young Negro, 15 years of age, had touched off a race riot by his attack upon a

police officer. The Director then stated, on an off the record basis, that the FBI had

attempted to obtain the record of the young Negro, however, one Judge Kelly had refused

on the basis that he was a juvenile. The Director stated he could tell the reporters, on a

confidential basis, that the young Negro in question had engaged in knife fights since he

was 7 years of age.

The Director spoke of juvenile crime and of the fact that he believes such

incidents should be made public. He stated that the public should realize the identity of

the individuals who represent a menace to society.. The Director then mentioned that he

is personally held responsible if his dogs commit any incidents in destruction of property

and that, very frankly, the parents of children should be considered in the same category.

He mentioned the recent destruction of automobile antennae in Bethesda, Maryland He

stated that crimes of this nature by young hoodlums should not be tolerated.

In speaking of juvenile criminality, the Director spoke of over indulgence

and pampering of youngsters. He explained he knew an individual whose son had been

recently arrested while in possession of a revolver. The father of the young man

threatened the police Captain by stating that if his son's name were placed on the police

blotter the Captain would be demoted. The police Captain did not place the name on the

blotter. The Director stated this was over-indulgence and merely encouraged the young

_man to commit further violations of the law.

Re: Sarah McClendon, Background Briefing Sessions Group

Appointment with the Director, 10:00 a. Mo, 11-18-64

The Director gave another example of a friend who had come to the United

States as an emigrant and who had worked hard all of his life. This friend had a son who

made poor marks in college, however, the father gave him an airplane, a boat and an

automobile. The father often complained that his son was not "towing the mark." The

Director told this friend that he was indulging in the whims of his son too much and,

therefore, seting a bad example. The friend replied that he did not want his son to have

the same trials and tribulations of growth that he had suffered. The Director replied that

the son should be given some challenges in order to know what lay ahead for him in life.

The Director stated that in the case of clerical employees in the FBI, if they do not

respond to discipline they are immediately fired from the Bureau.

The Director gave examples of other violations under FBI jurisdiction and

presented statistics to reflect our successes in these fields. He specifically mentioned

antitrust violations, Federal assaults and bank robberies. In the latter regard, he

explained there were 1, 624 bank robberies last year. The FBI, however, solved the

largest number of cases and obtained the largest number of convictions of any year.

ApproximatelyS, 300, 000 was recovered in loot. The Director explained that bank

robberies today were participated in by experienced criminals and novices. He gave as

an example an elderly lady in California who attempted to rob a bank. The Director

additionally detailed statistics regarding bribery and conflict of interest matters.

The Director next spoke of civil rights violations. He told the reporters

he wanted to dispel a number of myths concerning FBI jurisdiction and assignment of

personnel in such cases. He stated it was a common belief in some circles that Special

Agents in the South were all, without exception, southern born Agents. As a matter of

fact, 70% of the Agents currently assigned to the South were born in the North. He stated

that the "notorious" Martin Luther King had attempted to capitalize on this matter by

claiming that all Agents assigned to the Albany, Georgia, Resident Agency were southern

born Agents. As a matter of fact, 4 out of 5 of the Agents assigned to the Albany,

Georgia, Resident Agency were northern born. The Director stated he had instructed me

to get in touch with Reverend King and line up an appointment so that King could be given

the true facts. He stated that King had refused to give me an appointment and, therefore,

he considered King to be the most "notorious liar" in the country.

The Director stated that the rumor that the FBI does not have Negro

Agents is a lie. He stated that we not only have Negro Agents but even have a number of

Indian Agents. He added that he has always strongly enforced the rule that there should

be no discrimination in the FBI. He quickly added, however, that this does not mean that

qualifications of our personnel will be lowered. He stated that regardless of a person's

color, he will not accept that person for employment unless he meets the high standards

of qualifications the FBI has always insisted upon.

• Re: Sarah McClendon, Background Briefing Sessions Group

Appointment with the Director, 10:00 a.M., 11-18-64

The Director stated he wanted to make it clear that the FBI is not a

"police agency." We do not guard anyone; we are "fact finders"; the FBI cannot "wet

nurse" anyone.

The Director explained that the FBI has had remarkable success in

civil rights cases, although, to hear Martin Luther King talk the FBI has done nothing.

The Director stated that we have been able to penetrate the Ku Klux Klan and that as a

result we know what the Klan is doing currently and what they plan to do in the future.

He added that in the case of the 3 murdered civil rights victims in Mississippi he had

instructed that FBI Agents interview all members of the Ku Klux Klan to put them

on notice that the FBI was going to thoroughly investigate violations of the law. He added

that Governor Johnson of Mississippi had fired 5 or 6 officers who had been members

of the Klan.

The Director stated that some progress is being achieved in the South in

civil rights matters, however, there is yet considerable room for further progress. He

stated that in McComb, Mississippi, recently 3 men pled guilty to civil rights crimes,

however, the judge suspended sentence on them because of their ages. The Director

stated this was absolutely wrong inasmuch as it would establish the precedence of believing

that guilty individuals could escape the law in any locality when they commit such crimes.

The Director briefly detailed our jurisdiction regarding crimes against

aircraft and crimes on the high seas. He spoke of our jurisdiction concerning crimes on

Government and Indian Reservations. He mentioned embezzlements and gave statistics

to reflect our successes in this regard. He additionally brought up the subject of

extortion matters and stated that in kidnaping cases the FBI had investigated a total of

697 and had solved all but 3. The Frank Sinatra case had been solved in 5 days. The

attorneys of the defendants in this case are being tried at the present time on charges of

coaching witnesses to commit perjury by claiming the Sinatra case was a "hoax." The

Director stated he wanted to state, somewhat facetiously, that if we do not solve the next

kidnaping case within 5 days the papers may claim that the FBI has "slipped."

The Director spoke of crimes involving the Federal Housing Administration

insurance matters and gave statistics in this regard. He additionally gave statistics

regarding fraud against the government violations. He mentioned the Fugitive Felon Act

and how our investigation in this regard had clearly assisted local law enforcement. He

additionally mentioned such violations as illegal wearing of uniforms, impersonationg

interstate transportation of gambling paraphernalia, auto thefts, theit of government

property, White Stave Traffic Act, and security of government employees. He gave

statistics concerning all of these matters and stated that in cases involving security Ef

government employees, over 235, 000 security forms had been checked during the past

fiscal year.

Re: Sarah McClendon, Background Briefing Sessions Group

Appointment with the Director, 10:00 a.M., 1118-64

The Director spoke of applicant type investigations and in this regard

stated that the FBI investigated applications for the position of Federal Judges, U. S.

Marshals, U. S. Attorneys and those applicant investigations requested by the White

House.

The Director spent some time regarding our achievements in the police

training field and particularly made reference to the National Academy. He stated thai

such training has helped eliminate the need for a "clearinghouse" or National Police

Force.

The Director made reference to foreign trainees in the National Academy and

stated these individuals, after graduation, returned to their respective countries to be

ambassadors of good will. He stated that such training was obviously raising the

standards of law enforcement in foreign countries.

The Director specifically stated that in countries where there is a strong

police force communism makes few inroads. He gave the Philippine Islands as a good

example in this regard. The Director explained that we have 4, 640 graduates of the

National Academy at the present time. The Director also explained that police trainins

by the FBI eliminates jealousy in law enforcement. He stated that over the years he had

personally noted a marked change in the educational background of the police officers.

He stated this had come about as a result of police training.

The Director spoke of the FBI Laboratory and stated this is the largest

crime Lab in the world. He explained our policy with respect to examination of evidence

and the fact that we make our Agent scientists available to testify, free of charge, in

local cases.

:..

The Director made reference to the Identification Division and explained

that 23, 108 prints are received on an average basis each day. He stated we now have

171, 340, 775 prints on file. He stated this represents approximately 78 million people

inasmuch as we have a considerable number of duplications or "repeats" in the receipt

of prints.

At this point the Director was interrupted with a question. A reporter

asked if prints sent to the FBI by Secret Service were returned to the Secret Service.

The Director replied that within the recent past the Secret Service has requested that:

these prints be returned. He stated that we checked them, however, before they were

returned.

The Director elaborated on the fact that numerous fugitives are

apprehended each year as a result of "stop notices" being placed for the convenience of

local law enforcement. He explained that a man's name means nothing. The specific

prints are what count. He stated that one example of a person having 170 aliases,

however, he can always be readily identified through the medium of his fingerprints.

The Director spoke of domestic intelligence responsibilities. He stated

that the Soviet Government had intensified their efforts to obtain intelligence information

within the United States. The Director stated he often wondered how talk of peaceful

coexistence can be sincere when it is a well known fact that the Soviets intensify their

espionage activities on a daily basis. He said that the Russians obviously have a differe ni

definition of "peaceful coexistence" than the Americans. He explained that there were

several different types of espionage agents for the Soviets. He briefly discussed the Iron

Curtain Diplomatic Corps and their attempt to carry out espionage. He next discussed

the deep or secret type espionage agent.

The Director explained that the FBI has been

able to penetrate Soviet and satellite espionage circles, however, we, of course, have

plenty of room for improvement. He stated he would not want to indicate that the FBI has

"completely penetrated" such circles.

The Director stated that the question was often asked of him as to whether

we have women Special Agents. He stated we obviously do not have such employees

because of the very nature of our hazardous duties. He advised that we currently have

5, 580 women employees in supervisory and responsible positions. He explained that it

would be impossible for women employees to conduct civil rights investigations in the

south and Harlem. He added, however, that our women employees are very valuable.

He stated it was sometimes necessary to use women employees in investigative and

surveillance type work. Such usage creates less suspicion on the part of subjects,

The Director spoke of the success of the child molester poster and

indicated that millions of such posters have been sent to the public in response to requests

He stated that the coloring of such poster by school children has proved to be very

effective. He mentioned a recent solid example of a little girl refusing to get into an

automobile with a stranger because she had colored a poster sent to her by the FBI.

The Director spoke of the voluntary overtime put in by our investigative

personnel. He stated there were over 3, 330, 200 hours of overtime put in by our

personnel during the past fiscal year. This averages approximately 2 hours 28 minutes

per day. These employees are paid for only one hour 12 minutes of such overtime. The

Director stated this reflects a dedication and devotion to duty of our employees. He gave

an example of the man in Mississippi working on civil rights matters and the fact that

many of these men have worked night and day in swamps. He stated in his opinion this

was probably the highest among all overtime in government service today. The Director

stated he was very proud of the fact that there was a very small turnover of personnel in

the FBI inasmuch as we are a career service. He stated that 77% of our investigative

employees have served over 10 years.

The Director made reference to the "Disaster Squad." He used the recent

Nevada plane crash of Bonanza Airlines as an example. He stated this was most

distasteful work, however, our personnel had been very effective and successiul in doing

these humanitarian chores.

He stated that in the Nevada plane crash, 13 out of 28 victims

had already been identified.

Re: Sarah McClendon, Background Briefing Sessions Group

The Director was asked as to whether he thought Governor Johnson of

Mississippi was doing a good job. The Director replied that Governor Johnson is

attempting to raise the standards of law enforcement in Mississippi and had asked the

FBI for considerable assistance. He stated in his opinion that Governor Johnson was

attempting to do a good job. The same reporter asked if the FBI was prepared to lend

assistance to the police in training matters in Mississippi. The Director stated he had

already answered this question and that such assistance would be in the form of

lecturers, etc.

A reporter inquired as to whether Mississippi law enforcement officers

were allowed to attend the FBI's civil rights conferences held throughout that state.

The Director replied in the affirmative and stated that particularly the Highway Patrol

had attended such conferences.

A reporter indicated that the State of Mississippi spent less money per

person on education and health, however, at the same time had the lowest crime rates.

She asked if there was something possibly wrong with crime statistics in Mississippi.

The Director replied in the negative adding, however, that it was wrong to compare

areas with each other with respect to crime statistics. The Director stated that

Mississippi was actually two states. The northern part is very beautiful and in Jackson

particularly there was a similarity to large northern cities. In the southern part of the

state there was an entirely different element. The Director stated there are many good

people in Mississippi who do not believe in violence.

Miss McClendon inquired if the FBI conducted investigations for the

Senate. The Director indicated that we conducted investigations for the House Judiciary

Committee regarding impeachment proceedings against Federal Judges and that we

• additionally made checks for several Senate Committees, including the Armed Forces

and Senate Judiciary Committees at the specific request of the Attorney General. He

explained very carefully that we loan employees to the various Appropriations

Committees; however, these employees are not under our jurisdiction when they are

on loan.

A reporter asked if one of the 3 civil rights workers whose bodies were

discovered by the FBI had had communist affiliations. The Director replied, off the

record, that the mother and father of victim Schwerner had formerly been members of

the Party. The Director specifically stated at this point that his specific criticism ot

Martin Luther King should also be off the record.

The Director was asked if there was any truth to the fact that the FBI knew

the identities of the murderers of the 3 civil rights victims in Mississippi. He replied,

on an off-the-record basis, in the affirmative. He added that we might not obtain

convictions inasmuch as the case, if arrests were made, might possibly be tried in

state court.

Re: Sarah McClendon, Background Briefing Sessions Group

Appointment with the Director, 10:00 a.M., 11-18-64

The Director was asked once again as to his opinion regarding Governor

Johnson of Mississippi. He replied that he could not speak too highly of the Governor

and that he appreciated the Governor's reception given the FBI when our office was openet

in Jackson, Mississippi.

The Director was asked as to whether communists have successfully

penetrated the youth of our Nation. He explained in some detail the formation of the

W. E. B. DuBois Clubs. He also briefed the reporters regarding the Communist

Party's speaking program. He stated there were 50 appearances last year on college.

and university campuses. He stated that some campuses have even allowed the

appearance of George Lincoln Rockwell. He stated that some appearances by

communists and fanatics have been made under the guise of academic freedom. He

stated he believed in academic freedom but did not believe in "academic license,"

inasmuch as young students are entitled to the truth.

The Director was asked if he would comment on the fact that several

members of the police force in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, have been told they will be

fired if they did not give up their John Birch Society membership. The Director replied

that this was a problem for the city administration in Philadelphia. He stated he had no

respect for Welch, President of the John Birch Society, because of his unjustified

criticism against General Eisenhower. The Director stated that Welch might have also

criticized General MacArthur but he was not certain of this fact.

The Director was asked for his opinion, informally, regarding the John

Birch Society. He replied that any group which is supposedly dedicated to observing

freedom should be meticulous in the statements they make. The Director indicated that

if a person lies to you once he certain" would not believe him again. He stated that

organizations should never make wild charges. He added that wild charges have even

been made against him reflecting that he was "soft on communism." He stated that he,

of course, paid no attention to these charges, that he merely considered the source.

He stated over the years he has found it necessary to develop a "hide like a rhinocerous"

in view of the many wild charges made.

The Director was asked if he would comment as to the basis for the

Baltchs being released in New York after being charged with espionage. He specified that

he would answer this question off the record. He then explained that he wanted his

answer to be strictly off the record because he uid not-desire to be placed in the position

of criticizing the Department of State publicly. The Director informed the reporters that

he personally does not believe in exchanging skilled and experienced espionage agents

for just any nincompoop. He stated that some espionage agents who have been exchanged

have been very skilled individuals who later were sent bythe Soviet Union to other parts

of the world to once again conduct espionage. He stated that insofar as the Baltchs were

concerned this probably will happen in their case. The Director did not bring up the

subject of wire tapping information in this regard.

Re: Sarah McClendon, Background Briefing Sessions Group

Appointment with the Director, 10:00 a. Mo, 11-18-64

The question was raised as to whether the Baltchs were obtaining valuable

information in the United States. The Director replied that they were sent here for that

purpose by the Soviets and that some information had been obtained.

A reporter raised the question as to whether there should be instituted a

program in which college and universities would be alerted as to the danger of

communists appearing on their campuses. The Director replied that he had constantly

called attention to this fact in speeches and articles, however, some colleges knowingly

allowed communists to appear under the guise of academic freedom.

A reporter asked if American college students were thrown off guard

because of our country's coexistence theory. The Director replied that this reporter's

point was well taken.

He explained that exchange students are usually accompanied by

KGB representatives. He gave the example of olympic contests in which the Soviets

always send along espionage agents who accompany their athletes.

A reporter stated that there had been criticism of the FBI over the

alleged failure to investigate right-wing organizations. The Director emphatically

replied that there was nothing more right-wing than the Ku Klux Klan and the FBI had

certainly done a good job on this organization. The reporter stated this answer

satisfied her, however, asked if the Director would indicate the number of Klansmen

• in Mississippi. The Director stated at one time there was over 480 such members.

The

question was asked as to whether the FBI was investigating the

Black Muslims organization. The Director promptly replied that we were well aware

of their activities.

Miss McClendon inquired as to whether the FBI investigated violations

of the wire tapping statutes. The Director replied in the affirmative. He said he wanted

to make it clear that it was not a crime to tap wires, however, it was definitely a

crime to tap and disclose the information obtained as a result of the tap. The Director

emphasized that the FBI taps wires only in instances involving kidnaping where the

victim's life is at stake or where the internal security of the country is involved. He

stated that we never usedtaps until the Russians perpetrated the cold war. He said that

the FBI has less than 80 wire taps today.

A reporter inquired as to whether the Director was in favor of average

citizens carrying a gun. He replied in the negative. He stated any individual that needs

to have a gun should be required to have a license. The Director indicated he knew he

would run head long into the National Rifle Association by making this statement,

however, no individual should be ashamed of getting a license.

Re: Sarah McClendon, Briefing with Director

Miss McClendon told the Director that a delegation from Houston,

Texas, large in size, planned to come to Washington upon hearing that the Director

planned to resign. She stated that these people planned to protest the Director's

resignation and/or retirement. She stated the Director was much loved in Texas and

that her people wanted the Director to continue in his position. She then inquired as to

whether the Director had any intentions of retiring in the near future. The Director

replied in the negative. He stated he promised the President that he would stay on.

He mentioned that the President had asked him to do this immediately upon being made

Prèsident. He stated that at this time he had informed the President that as of

January 1, 1965, the law would make it mandatory that he retire. The President stated

he would take care of this matter. The President has done this and the Director

stated he would continue to stay in his job.

The Director elaborated that he has known the President for many

years and that for 19 of these years he and the President lived directly across the street

from each other and often visited each other. He stated that he has always been very

friendly with the President and knew Mrs. Johnson and the two daughters very well.

There were a number of other routine type questions such as what type

dogs does the Director, ye

does the Director enjoy walking, etc., to which the Director

replied.

Without exception, the reporters were very thrilled at the reception

given them by the Director. In the outer office, upon departing, they were mostly

anxious to return to their papers to prepare their stories immediately. Before

leaving, however, all of them expressed appreciation and a majority indicated this

was the finest briefing their group had ever experienced.

"Because FBI Agents have sided with segregationists, they have not investigated

beatings and other intimidations of Negroes who are fighting for equality in Albany, Georgia

or surrounding areas," Another statement of King's was,

"One of the great problems we

face with the FBI in the South is that the Agents are white southerners who have béen

The trouble with rash or inflamma-

Mr. Hoover spoke of these and other

Misunderstanding of FBl's Powers

The President's commitment to the civil rights cause is unques-

They point out that agents

have no general police power.

submitted a telegram Irom Atlanta,

11/19/64,

regarding the director semarie to the enemin

King's telegram is analyzed below.

KING STAMES:

He has questioned the Bureau's effectiveness but has never

attributed this merely to the presence of southerners in

the FBI.

FACTS:

In November, 196), in discussing racial disturbances in Albany!

Georgia, King was

widely quoted in the press as stating that bne

of the greatest problems regarding the FBI in the South is that the Agents

are white Southerners who have been influenced by the mores of the

community.

This is, of course, absolutely false, and it is noted that

tour of the live Agents then assigned to Albany, Georgia, were Northerners.

KING STATES:

Not a single arrest was made in Albany, Georgia, during the

many brutalities against Negroes.

FACTS:

During the summer of 1962, there was a continuing series of mass

racial meetings, marches and demonstrations by Negroes in the

Albany,- Georgia, area. This resulted in numerous multiple arrests of

Negroes for lying down in the street, blocking traffic and disorderly

conduct.:

During this period, numerous allegations of civil rights

violations were made to Bureau Agents and Departnent officials.

In every

instance-the Department was advised of the complaint and the results of

any 'investigation conducted. Any additional investigation requested by

the Department was immediately and thoroughly run out and the results

furnished to the Department.

The Department did not see fit to prosecute

lany of the incidents arising out of these demonstrations.

During this same period, however, prosecution was brought against

Denver lidgar Short, If short intimidated voter registration workers on

, Sasser, Georgia, which is about

20 miles fron Albany.

Memorandum to Mr. Belmont

RE:

TELEGRAM FROM MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

DATED NOVEMBER 19, 1964

It is also noted that on 9/17/62, FBI Agents arrested four

white subjects in the vicinity of the I Hope Baptist church, a Negro

church near Dawson, Georgia, and about 30 miles from Albany, which had

been burned that day. In the absence of a lederal violation, confessions

obtained by Bureau Agents were made available to local authorities

resulting in a seven year sentence for each of the three adult subjects

jand three years probation for the fourth subject who was a juvenile.

On 10/4/62 Bureau Agents arrested Jack Phelix Smith and a

detainer was placed against Douglas howard Parker, a state prisoner,

on civil rights charges in connection with the burning of the Shady

Grove Baptist Church near Leesburg, Georgia, on 8/15/62. This was a

Negro church approximately 12 miles from Albany. Smith and Parker are

white.

A Federal Grand Jury failed to indict,

and our evidence was made

available to state officials who presented the case to a local grand jury

which also returned a no bill.

KING STATES:

Not a single arrest has been made in connection with the

bombing in Birmingham or the thiee murdered civil riguis

workers

in Mississippi.

FACTS:

the sixteenth street Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama, was

bombed 9/10/63 killing lour Negro children.

We

immediately

launched the most intensive type

•ot investigation which is still

vigorously continuing.

Our investigation was prejudiced by premature

arrests made by the Alabama Highway Patrol, and consequently, it has

not yet been possible to obtain evidence or confessions that

would insure

successful prosecution although we have identified a small group of

Klansmen believed to be responsible.

We, of course, launched a massive investigation following the

disappearance of the three civil rights workers in the vicinity of

Philadelphia, Mississippi, on June 21, 1964. We located their bodies in

an earthen dam and have developed information identifying those

responsible.

Intensive investigation is continuing to develop the case

¡for prosecution as quickly as possible.

It should be noted that our recent investigations in

Mississippi have produced the following positive results: (1) Eleven

arrests in McComb on state charges involving bombings and other violence.

Nine of those arrested have pleaded guilty or nolo contendere and

received probationary sentences;

(2)

Seven arrests in Natchez on

state charges involving shooting incidents and a beating; (3) Two

subjects arrested on state murder charges 11/6/64 in connection with

the killing of Henry Hezekiah Dee and Charlie Eddie Moore; (4) Seven

arrests for racial violence by the Sheriff of Pike County

who stated

this resulted from his success in practicing Bureau methods he

observed during our recent investigations; and (5) FBI Agents have

arrested five present and forner law enforcement officers in Neshoba

County on charges of police brutality. They are presently avaiting trial.

KING STATES:

FBI Agents work with local officers on criminal cases

making it difficult for them to effectively function

where Negroes are threatened.

FACTS:

This is a shopworn canard, the falsity of which is clearly

illustrated by our currently effective cooperation with local

officers in Mississippi, our arrest of live officers in Neshoba County,

Mississippi, our effective cooperation with local officers in the

Georgia church burning investigations, the Penn murder case and many

other cases in all parts of the country.

KING STATES:

He has no record of a request from the Director to

meet with him.

FACTS:

In November, 1962, Assistant Directors DeLoach and Sullivan

sought to make an appointment with King to straighten him out

with regard to his public remarks concerning our performance in Albany,

Georgia.

King was never availabb on the telephone and left instructions

with his secretary on 11/28/62 that he would call us when he was willing

to arrange an interview. He did not call us and on January 15, 1963,

we decided to make no further effort to contact him..

KING STATES:

He has always made himself available to Atlanta FBI Agents.

FACTS:

In July, 1961, it was necessary to contact King in connection

with the investigation of Theodore Edward Brown, a special

inquiry for the Peace Corps.

secretary for his interview

interview 1/22 dove

An appointment was made through King's

7/22/61; however, King kept the Agent

waiting for one hour past the appointed time

and stated he was behind

in his paper work and had completed some of it before admitting the Agent.

In June, 1962, efforts were made to obtain an appointment with

King in connection with

a case involving Shirley Blackwell Cummings,

a Peace Corps applicant.

Beginning on approximately 6/5/62, King's

secretary kept stating the he was not available for interview although

it was known

to us

that he was in his office daily. On 6/8/62 Wyatt T.

Walker, King's assistant, advised the Atlanta Office that he and King

were proceeding to Shreveport, Louisiana, in connection with the voter

registration drive and that the Little Union Baptist Church in

Shreveport had received a bob threat. At that time, Halker was intormec

that Agents had been urgently trying to make an appointment with King

telephoned the Atlanta Office from Shreveport to inquire as

to why the

Agent wanted an appointment and to advise of the bomb threat previously

furnished by Walker. King consented to interview which was conducted

16/9/62.

King was also interviewed by the Atlanta Office on 7/24/62

the U.S. District Court to stop demonstrations. The interview was

conducted in the U.S. courtroom where king had appeared for a hearing.

On 11/30/62, when Assistant Directors DeLoach and Sullivan

were attempting to arrange an Interview with king, the atlanta

Office

contacted King's secretary to make such an appointment at King's

convenience.

The Agont was

advised that ring was writing a book and

could not be reached.

King's secretary was requested to have King

contact the Atianta Office on an urgent matter but he never made such

a contact.

On 6/25/63 the Atlanta Office attempted to contact King to

advise him of a threat against his life. Efforts to contact him were

at first unsuccessful, but

after a delay of some hours, King's secretary

informed him of the Bureau's interest in talking to him and arrangenents

were made for an Agent to contact King by telephone.

ACTION

(1)

King states in his telegram that he would be happy to

discuss his telegram with the Director in the near future.

In view of

King's character, it is recommended that the Director have no contact

with him.

(2) It is recommended that no reply be made to King's telegra=

as his character and prior conduct have made it obvious that it would be

only a futile gesture to make any effort to apprise him of the facts.

SELECIVE SERVICE ACTAR/eS J.

On the attached clipping from the Baltimore "Sun, " the Director

has noted "This is in greater detail than earlier clipping which I sent through.

Even Nichols' affidavit is set out and is the first I ever knew about it. I want

immediately a full explanation."

"Alfred BXEdd

The attached clipping set out details concerning a notation which appears

on the original logs of conversations overheard on the electronic surveillance

of Martin Luther King. It notes that these notations were excised from the

material which had been previously made available to the defense in the

Cassius Clay, Selective Service Act, case. We are resolving the question

of these notations and are requiring the Atlanta office to inform the Bureau

in full detail by teletype today why these notations appeared on the original

log but did not appear on the copy of the log made available to the Department

for the Clay hearing ThomAs

anAs

tXif AndRews

On June 6, 1969, Federal Judge Joe Ingraham, U. S. District Court,

Houston, ordered the Government to make available the original logs pertaining

to this case for review by defense attorneys. The defense prior to this order

had reviewed copies of the logs involved. By memorandum to the Assistant

Attorney General, Criminal Division, dated June 13, 1969, the original logs

were transmitted to the Department.

Departmental attorney, Michael Epstein,

one of the attorneys handling the prosecution of Clay, made inquiry concerning

the pencilled notation which appeared on the original log to the effect, "Sum up

¡in memo." Epstein stated that this notation did not appear on the copy of the

log which had been made available to the defense.

The Bureau requested the

Atlanta Office on the afternoon of June 19 to obtain an appropriate affidavit

to explain the significance of the notation.

The affidavit prepared by SA Robert R

vichols of the Atlanta Office was received at the Bureau late on the afternoon

of June 20, 1969.

This affidavit explained that the notation had been made by

ISA Nichols as a flag for himself to consider writing a memorandum. He statea

RE: CASSIUS MARCELLUS CLAY

that the substance of the information did not warrant the preparation of a

memorandum.

His affidavit further states that his recollection is borne

out by the absence of any such memorandum in the file. Because of the

urgency of the matter, with the concurrence of Section Chief Eddy and

Number One Man McAndrews, *this affidavit was delivered to Epstein on the

late afternoon of June 20 at which time Epstein stated that this was exactly....

I this devel sment?

upervisor Charles J. Devic has advised that the affidavit, upon

review at the Bureau, was noted to be entirely consistent with the testimony

electronic surveillance by the Atlanta office. For this reason, Devic states

that he believed that the affidavit was a logical extension of the earlier testimony

of Agent Nichols in Houston and he, therefore, did not submit a memorandum

on this point. A copy of Nichols' affidavit is attached.

ACTION:

An appropriate memorandum concerning Nichols' affidavit should

have been prepared. This was not done and, therefore, it is recommended

that letters of censure be directed to Supervisor Devic,

Section Chief Eddy,

and Number One Man McAndrews:

The Atlanta Division has been instructed to advise today by teletype

why the notation "Sum up in memo, " which appears on the original logs was

AFEIDAVIT OF SA ROBERT R. NICHOLS

Atlanta, Georgia, Fulton County:

I, Robert R. Nichols, a Special Agent of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation, having been duly sworn,

hereby make the following statement to Charles T. Haynes,

a Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation

I have been shown a copy of the original log

dated September 4, 1964, Involving the conversation of

cassius Clay with

Martin Luther King, Jr., which log was

subject of my testimony on June 4, 1909, In United

States District Court, Houston, Texas, in the case

involving the United States versus Cassius Clay. Noted

on the left hand margin of this log 1s the hanawritten

notation "sum up in memo."

handwritten notation

to consider this as an item to be placed in memorandum

form.

Upon subsequent detailed review of the entire log

and evaluation of its contents, I decided the substance

of the information did not warrant the preparation of

a memorandum.

Therefore, to the best of my recollection,

I did not prepare a memorandum summarizing this infornation.

This fact is borne out by the absence of any such

memorandum in the file.

Soon after, the Justice Depart-

On June 3, Judge Joe M. In-

This is to set forth the results of the

On page 10 of the transcript appears the

following sequence of questions and answers:

This. conversation was five years

ago, but that particular investigation went on some time

after that 1964 date, didn't it?" Objection was made to

Answer: "Yes, sir."

Question: "It went on until April 4, 1968,

did it not?"

Answer: "I wasn't on it after May, 1965."

Question: "Do you know whether or not it went

Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach

RE: CASSIUS MARCELLUS CLAY

SA Nichols explained that what was

meant by his state-

ment that investigation and electronic surveillance continued after

the case was reassigned to another Agent in May, 1965, he had in

mind that technical coverage continued on the offices of the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference after case was reassigned from him.

It is noted that Dr. King was active in this organization.

(The

technical coverage on the offices of the Southern Christian Leader-

ship Conference was discontinued on 6/21/66.) SA Nichols further

explained for a period of several weeks after case reassignment,

the Agent receiving the case conferred with SA Nichols on several

occasions for assistance in identifying individuals mentioned in

the logs based on the overall case knowledge of SA Nichols. Because

of this, SA Nichols felt he was compelled to testify that he under-

Istood investigation continued until some time after May, 1965.

The Special Agent in Charge (SAC), Atlanta, has advised

that based on a review of this matter, it appears that the testimony ri

as given by SA Nichols was gratuitous

and hearsay.

The SAC stated..rr

thai Nichols was not actually ina-position to tescify-regarding:.

this intormation because he did not have first-hand knowledge

ACTION:

SA Nichols volunteered information as to his under-

standing which was not called for by the question put to him by

the defense.

This has enabled the hostile press to capitalize

on this phase of the testimony.

It is to be noted that the

surveillance on the telephone at Dr. King's residence, Atlanta,

Georgia, was in effect from November 8, 1963, to April 30, 1965.

Dear Mr. Hoover:

to move to Oklahoma City pursuant to transfer letter

This is to advise I have already made arrangements

June 25, 1969.

I again express my regrets for my handling of the

matter for which I was placed on probation June 25, 1969.

I fully appreciate the seriousness of the matter, deeply

regret that it happened and will ever be mindful of the

outcome.

I only wish there was some way that I could

personally correct the situation.

•wit

Mr. Hoover, I want to personally appeal to you

with the request that my transfer be cancelled. I base

this request on my efforts and accomplishments, and point

out that during the past seven years I received three

Incentive Awards and during the past two years have

been responsible for reporting twenty-seven convictions.

Seven of these convictions related to prosecutions in

Selective Service Act matters wherein a racial organization

interfered with draftees attempting to enter an induction

center.

During my twenty-two years of service as a Special

Agent I have never been placed on probation or transferred

before for aisciplinary reasons.

I hope you will favorably consider my request

based on my

overall record and I assure you that whatever

the outcome I will continue to do the best job that I

possibly can for you and for the FBI.

CRITICISM OF MR. HOOVER AND FBI ON

WIRETAPPING OF MARTIN LUTHER KING

Anglet

5 Crore

Reference my memorandum to you of 6/17/69, captioned

as above, in which it was approved that the Director answer a critical

letter to the Editor of "The. New York Times" by Greenawalt which appeared

in the 6/14/69 issue of that newspaper. Accordingly, by letter of 6/18/69,

the Director transmitted to Greenawalt a copy of Mr. Tolson's letter to

Carl T. Rowan regarding Rowan's unfounded charges concerning wire-

tapping.

By letter of 6/23/69, Mr. Greenawalt acknowledged the

Director's letter and indicated that at the time he wrote his original letter,

he "did not have enough facts to know who was responsible for the wiretapping

or whether... there were sufficient reasons to justify it. " He then indicates

that the former question has been "clarified" a good deal, and, though he

still has some doubts concerning the latter question, he can see that it may

not be possible to disclose enough information at this time for it to be com-

pletely explained to the public. Greenawalt finally states: "I am somewhat

reassured that the tapping was done pursuant to a good faith view of the needs

Lot internal security and appreciate your having made that clear. "

OBSERVATION:

REC- 71: /

363

In view of the generally conciliatory tone,of Greenawalt's

letter, it would seem advisable to let this matter now rest since there

would be little purpose in further pursuing the discussion with Greenawalt.

RECOMMENDATION:

- "That no fürther correspondence be undertaken with

Mr. Greenawalt on this matter and, accordingly, his letter not be

answered.

Washington, D.C. 20535

Dear Mr. Hoover:

Thank you for your letter of June 18. I am disturbed by

your statements that my letter to the New York Times contained "unwarranted

criticism" of the F.B.I. and "unfounded charges." My use of thequestion

form in the central part of that letter was meant to be honest, not

rhetorical. At the time, I did not have enough facts to know who was

responsible for the wiretapping or whether, putting aside the legal im

port of the Federal Communications Act, there were sufficient reasons

to justify it.

As to the former question, subsequent statements have

clarified the matter a good deal (though to my knowledge, it has still

not been explicitly stated that all tapping did stop when the authorization

ceased).

In regard to the latter question, it may be it is impossible

to lay before the public enough information about the reasons for the

tapping for interested private citizens to make a juagment on its ad-

visability, but so far as I am aware no statements have been made since

my letter that would quiet my doubts on that score.

I am somewhat reassured that the tapping was done pursuant to

la good faith view of the needs of internal security and appreciate your

having made that clear:

Perhaps the basic question is how broadly that

term should be interpreted when something as serious as continued wire-

tapping absent judicial approval is involved.

sincerely yours,

CRITICISM OF MR. HOOVER AND FBI,ON

WIRETAPPING OF MARTIN LUTHER KING

Reference is made to Letter to the Editor from captioned

individual which appeared in the 6-14-69 issue of "The New York Times."

Greenawalt states he is "shocked by the disclosure of continuing electronic

surveillance of one of the country's greatest and most respected leaders. "

Greenawalt asks who authorized such a surveillance on King, noting that

Ramsey Clark had denied one was authorized during his term as Attorney

General and had stated that any implication that the Justice Department thought

King was a national security risk is "outrageous." His letter concludes with

the insistence that there be safeguards in the Justice Department to see that

similar surveillances do not recur.

Sir:

• My attention has been called to the malicious

concerning tir. J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the fEl.

For your information, the wire tap on Martin

Luther king, Jr., was specifically approved in advance in

writing by the late Attornuy General of the United States,

Mr. Robert F. Kennedy. This device was strictly in the

feld of internal security and, therefore, was within the

provisions laid down by the then President of the United

States.

It is to be hoped that you will give the same

PURPOSE:

To publicize hypocrisy on the part of Martin Luther

RACKGROUND:

Martin Luther King has urged Negroes in Memphis,

Tennessee, to boycott white merchants in order to force

compliance with Negro demands in the sanitation workers'

strike in Memphis.

When violence broke out during the march King led

in Memphis on 3-28-68, King disappeared.

There is a first

chose to hide out at the white owned and operated Holiday Inn

Motel.

RECOMMENDATION:

The above facts have been included in the attached

DO AS I SAY, NOT AS I DO

Martin Luther King, during the sanitation workers®

strike in Memphis, Tennessee, has urged Negroes to boycott

downtown white merchants

to achieve Negro demands. On 3-29-68

King led a march for the sanitation workers. Like Judas leading

lambs. to slaughter King led the marchers to violence, and when

the violence broke out, King disappeared. •

The fine Hotel Lorraine in Memphis is owned and

patronized exclusively by Negroes but King didn't go there

from his hasty exit.

Instead King decided the plush Holiday

inn Motel, white owned, operated and almost exclusively white

patronized, was the place to "cool it."

There will be no

boycott of white merchants for king, only for his followers.

(SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE)

The Pittsburgh "Point," a weekly newspaper

dated 10/24/68, contains an article which indicates that

Dr. RALPH ABERNATHY will speak at a mass rally at Central

Baptist Church, Pittsburgh, Pa., on 11/2/68, as part of a

drive by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference

(SCIC) to educate Black communities concerning the three

major presidential candidates.

The Congressional Record dated 5/6/68, on

Page /H3389, contains an article which inicates that the 6th

7196fledition of the "Herald," 407 Butler Street, Anderson,

s. C., South Carolina's oldest Negro newspaper, contains

the testimony of a 15 year old female member of ABERNATHY's

church.

The testimony relates to a filthy and perverted

sex scandal between ABERNATHY and the girl according to

the Congressional Record.

It is believed that if information

relating to this sordid episode on the part of ABERNATHY

were made public in Pittsburgh, his effectiveness would be

curtailed,

It is felt that the mailing of these copies of the

Herald newspaper from South Carolina, there would be less

chance the information would be discounted as a Kian trick it the

information was received from Pittsburgh in a way to indicate a

member of the local community sent it. Also the same page, in

the Herald contains an article condemning Martin Luther King, Ji..

and accusing him of traveling to Puerto Rico with a young girl.

If the paper were used, this information on King would only serve

to "muddy the water,"

For your information the edition of the

the Congressional Record.

NOTE:

Ralph Abernathy, President of the SCLC, is to speak at

a Pittsburgh Church on 11/2/68 to educate the black community

on the elections. Pittsburgh suggested that the Herald,

reportedly a South Carolina newspaper, be sent to the minister

and Chairman of Deacons of the Church prior to Abernathy's

appearance.

The paper contains an article about a sex scandal

involving Abernathy and a 15-year-old girl. The Congressional

Record also contains information about this scandal.

Correspondence received from the Atlanta and New York Offices

relating to the activities of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference

(SCLC) has indicated the Communist Party (CP) has been attempting to exert

Influence on Di. Martin Luther King, the southern integrationist leader

and through him the SCLC. Dr. King

• is the President of SCLC which is

actively engaged in the integration movement in the South. Stanley David

Tevison, a secret member of the CP, and Hunter Pitts O'Dell, a member of

the National Committee of the SP, are Influential with Dr. King. Bothi

have been identified in the past as officers of SCLC.

The New York and Atlanta Offices were instructed to make a

complete review of all available information concerning CP interest in the

SCLC and to furnish the Bureau recommendations concerning a communist

infiltration investigation of this organization. Both offices have

recommended a communist infiltration, investigation of SCIC due to the

dominant CP influence on the executives of the New York Chapter of SCLC and

the fact that four CP members are presently associated with SCLC and that at

least one of these members is an officer in the organization.

It is believed a communist infiltration investigation of SCLC 1s

warranted to determine the CP influence in that organization.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the attached letter to Atlanta with copies to pertinent fieic

offices authorizing a communist infiltration investigation of SCLC be

approved. The field is being cautioned that this investigation must be

limited to and directed toward determining the extent of communist infil-

tration of the SCLC and any information developed concerning the integra-

tion or racial activities of SCLC must be reported under the racial

matter

When Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING was invited to address

the AFI-CIO convention some time ago, KING, on LEVISON's ad-

vIce, first obtained approval to do so from A. PHILLIP RANDOLPH,

nogro labor leader, who, if he had not been consulted in the

matter, might have felt

that KING's making a speech at the

aforesaid convention was a blow to RANDOLPH's prestige.

KING delivered a remarkably effective speech at the

ArL-CIo convention, ang asa result, receivea invitations

Irom numerous labor leaders, including "MC DONALD Of Steel,"

to address their respectave unions.

As the outstanding

champion of negro rights in the country, KING is a powerful

political influence, recognized as such

by the higher echelons

oI the democratic Party. He has access to Attorney General

ROBERT KENNEDY and president. KENNEDY: who; politically, need

KING, particularly in the south, where in cities like Atlanta

and New orleans the negro vote

now constitutes the balance of

power, and where king controls the negro vote.

JAMES HOEFA, Teamsters Union "boss" appreciates

the political power of KING, particularly the fact that KING

can influence the 90,000 negro members of the Teamsters

Union. HOFFA invited KING to address the Teamsters Union:

and KING accepted the invitation.

Knowing that KING is being

deferred to by Attorney General KENNEDY, and President KENNEDY,

HOFFA requested KING to, contact the Attorney General in an

effort to influence the latter "to lay off" HOFFA.

KING waS

¡inclined to do as HOFFA requested, but LEVISON convinced him

that to do so would be politically unwise, inexpedient, and

likely to be a "boomerang," since the Attorney General

would

never accede to such a request, particularly in the case of

HOFFA.

LEVESON had to steer KING away from another politi

cally hazardous situation.

Some months ago OTTO PREMINGER,

hoLLywood movie director,

entered into negotiations with a

KING representative for KING to play a part in a picture

which PREMINGER woulddirec""fast, easy money" for KING's

Although PREMINGER's offer was

offer would

¡ #sthat "KING Is a wholehearted Marxist, who has studied

of his being

a minister of religion, does not dare to espouse

It publicly."
