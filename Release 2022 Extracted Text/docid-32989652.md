PART II SPECIFIC COMMENTS

1. Justification for Any Minus Ratings Given

SA Sentinella has been rated minus in connection
-with his attitude because for 11 of the 13 months ending | -
5/31/60, he did not equitably share the work load of the
office. This action on his part, since he was in a super-
visory capacity, apparently had some effect on other Agents
as 11 of the 18 Agents on his squad also failed to equit-
ably share the work load during the 3-month period ending
5/31/60. However, in this connection, it is noted he has
given his assurance’ that his future course of action will
leave no basis whatsoever for any similar situation.

°

2. Experience and Ability as Inspector's Aide

PEELE "ne eSERBVERCOSTSPEMEESAIT<) |W ‘Sentinella has been ati, approved Inspector! s
Aide. He: has not assisted on any inspections during this

derning his performance in this regard.

3. Participation in Informant Programs .

zi SA Sentinella is fully cognizant of the Security
Informant Program and has made material contributions in that
regard in the past. However, he has been supervising the
development of security-type informants.

4, Testifying Experience and Ability
Although this Agent has not had an opportunity to

testify during the rating period, he has appeared as a wit-
ness during his Bureau career and has made a creditable showing.

5. Disciplinary Action

COMMENT on type of work handied entire rating period and appraisal of overall work performance:

SA NICHOLS was the sole Resident Agent in Valdosta, Ga., where his assign-
ments consisted of a variety of Criminal, Applicant and Security matters un-
til his transfer to Oklahoma City, arriving 7/25/69. His work in Okiahoma
City has consisted primarily of General Criminal and Fugitive type matters.
He has demonstrated the ability to handle the more complicated, complex
investigative type matters, requiring a minimum of supervision. He plans hig
work well, is most amenable to suggestions and is able to get to the heart o
a matter with no lost motion. He has displayed an eagerness to handle any
assignment, accepts such assignments willingly and appears genuinely desir-

Predication: :
Reference is made to the enclosed memorandum dated 9/16/63
and to the attached proposed SAC Letter.

On returning from a few days leave I have been advised of

the Director's continued dissatisfaction with the manner in which ¢

we prepared a Brief on the above-captioned matter and subsequen’ ‘aaen!
| memoranda on the Same subject matter. This situation is very Re

disturbing to those of us in the Domestic Intelligence Division |
responsible for this area of work, and we certainly want to do
everything possible. to correct our shortcomings. We absolutely will
not be stubborn about admitting any mistakes we nave made vr be
stiff-necked and unbending concerning our analysis of this matter.
The Director indicated he would not approve our last SAC Letter
until there was a clarification and a meeting of minds relative to
the question of the extent of communis’ influence over Negroes and
their leaders. In this memorandum I will seriously and sincerely
| ey to clarify a most regretable situation. It is prepared not on

official office memorandum but rather on plain bond believing that
this discussion need not be made a matter of’ official record...

Common Agreement:

6 First, I am sure we all are in agreement on the following”;
which was in both the cover memorandum and the detailed brief L
attached: (1) for the past 44 years the Communist Party, USA, has’
| spent enormous sums of money and ceaseless efforts to influence
Negroes and to make communists out of them; (2) the-19 million
Negroes in the country today constitute the greatest single racial
target of the Communist Party, USA; (3) Negro leader Martin Luther
King, reported to be a Marxist, does have as an extremely important
: advisor Stanley Levison, a secret Communist Party member EC) we
are right now in this nation engaged in a form of social-—revolution
and the time has never been so right for exploitation of the
Negroes by communist propagandists} and (5) the Communist Party

the American Negro to the serious detriment of our national security.

showing communist involvement in Negro racial ma’ this nation,
relative to which we can all agree.

Essence of the Situation: . : : A |

The essence of the situation seems to be this: We
presented what facts there are in our files in the Brief in question
and I know that the Director certainly would hot waht GS to do other
than this. The position taken at the time the Brief was written was
that, while there is communist influence being Gxerted on Negroes
and Negro leaders, it has not reached the point of control or
domination. This historically has been the position of the Bureau
in this matter in light of file reviews going back ten to twenty

years. ae Bay Biele ly eB Tree wrth ee
‘ 6 oT otal Ste en [rape Rar
The Historical Position: <> solo la wu ya

poly

For example, in a detailed document prepared on Communist
Party and the Negro in 1952, we find the stetement referring tc "the
failure of the Communist Party to attract even a significant number
of Negroes in the United States to its number." Another example is
to be found in an analysis in this same field prepared by the Bureau
in 1956 to the effect that communist efforts have been “unsuccessful
on 4 state or national level" in infiltrating “legitimate Negro-
fraternal, protest and improvement organizations," although they made
limited success in some "isolated chapters." The Director's book,
Masters of Deceit, published in 1958, states: "It became obvious
that the Party, despite great efforts, had failed to win over even
a significant minority of Negroes." In 1960 the Director's statement
to'The Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, reads:
"It is no secret that one of the bitterest disappointments of
communistic efforts in this Nation has been their failure to lure
our Negro citizens into the Party." In 1962 similar public statements
“ were made. On page seven of the Brief submitted to the Director
under the date of August 23, 1963, this historical position was
restated and it was said, "One of the bitterest disappointments of
the communists has beén their single failure to lure any significant
number of our Negro citizens into the Party."' This statement was
set forth again in the cover memorandum which the Director marked.

The point I wish to make here is this: The fact that this
has been our historical position in the Bureau for many years is no
| zeason to assume that it is the correct position at this time, as the
Director has clearly explained. Times and conditions change and, as
the evidence mounts, naturally we need to change our position along
with this evidence. - :

‘i 1
Interpretation:

As we know, facts by themselves are not too meaningful,
for they are somewhat like stones tossed in a heap as contrasted |
to the same stones put in the form of a sound edifice. It is

obvious to us now that we did not put the proper interpretation upon
|| tne tacts the facts which we gave to the Director.

Martin Luther King:

We have been aware of the communist influence for nearly
two years on Martin Luther King, Jr., head of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, and in the comprehensive memorandum entitled
“Communist Pariy, USA, Negru Question," dated $/23/63 we set out
information to the effect that a number of Negro leaders in this
country have had subversive connections in their backgrounds and
that Martin Luther King, Jr., has been dealing with)Stanley Levison,
‘a concealed communist| as well as {Hunter Pitts O'Dell, a secret
member of the Nationa} Committee of the’ cPusAy As previously
stated, we are in complete agreement with the Director that
communist influence is being exerted on Martin Luther King, Jr.,
and that King is the strongest of the Negro leaders. As we have
stated before in a memorandum, we regard Martin Luther King to
be, the most dangerous and effective Negro leader in the country.

In addition, we know the Party is directing a major effort toward
strengthening its position among the Negroes inasmuch as we have
information the Party plans to intensify its efforts to exploit
the racial situation for the purpose of gaining influence among
the Negroes. To this end, the Party plans to hold a highly se-
cretive leadership meeting in November, 1963, which will deal
primarily with the Negro situation. This meeting is to be preceded
by a[Gus Hall }"barnstorming" trip through key areas of the
country to méet Party people and thus better prepare himself
for the November meeting. Furthermore, in the last few days
Halifhas advised_an informant he contemplates requesting the
evison bri hers | to set up an office in Atlanta, Georgia, to
be used brogners] Pitts O'Dell} which will serve as the office
for "Freedomways," a Communist Party sponsored publication, and
as headquarters for Communist Party activity in the South.

Memorandum for Mr, Belmont ; | i

RE:, COMMUNIST PARTY, USA |
1 NEGRO QUESTION
COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN RACIAL MATTERS i au |

SAC Letter to the Field : 7 1 ot

I would like to set forth here briefly why I think that
the enclosed SAC Letter, which was returned to us by the Director,
should be sent to the field offices, My first reason is this:
We need to renew our efforts and keep the pressure on and leave
no_stone unturned to develop every and all facts which exist
in his matter. Some of these facts may not yet “have been
unearthed by our field offices, and will not be unless we
follow up this matter evermore closely with them. My second
reason why I think the SAC Letter should be sent is related
to the present changing situation inthe Communist Party ~ Negro
relations area. During the past two weeks in particular there
have been sharp stepped-up activities on the part of communist

| officiais to infiltrate and to dominate Negro developments in
this country. Further, they are meeting with successes. This
should be no surprise to us because since the Negro march on
| Washington on August 28 communist officials have been doing all
_ possible to exploit the very troubled racial situation, As
* they said weeks ago, the end of the Negre march would be the
beginning of evermore systematic activities on their part to
penetrate and influence Negroes and Negro leaders, They are
now in full force acting upon this intention of theirs expressed
i weeks ago. The field should be alerted to this fact and given
instructions to investigate exhaustively new communist - Negro
_activities. The SAC Letter in question will be a great help
toward this end, and it should result in our developing important
facts relating to the current changes and pertinent activities
going on during the past few weeks in this entire field.

Subject of Deep Concern

May I repeat that our failure to measure up to what the
Director expected of us in the area of communist - Negro relations
\is a subject of very deep ¢ rn to us in the Domestic Intelligence

Division. We are dist y. this and ought to be. I want him

(2) In order that other agencies and prominent government

these facts forth, succinctly and clearly}? the reader cannot help
but be impressed with the seriousness of the communist activities.

of Negroes im the United States to its number."' Another example is
to be found in an analysis in this same field prepared by the Bureau
in 1956 to the effect that communist efforts have been "unsuccessful
on & state or national level" in infiltrating "legitimate Negro-
fraternal, protest and improvement organizations," although they made
limited success in some “isolated chapters." The Director's book,
jiasters of Deceit, published in 1958, states: "It became obvious’
‘that the Party, despite great efforts, had failed to win over even
a significant minority of Negroes." In 1960 the Director's statement
to'The Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, reads:
"It is no secret that one of the bitterest disappointments of
communistic efforts in this Nation has been their failure to lure
our Negro citizens into the Party." In 1962 simjlar public statements
“ were made. On page seven of the Brief submitted*to the Director
under the date of August 23, 1963, this historical position was
restated and it was said, "One of the bitterest diseppointments of
the communists has beén their single failure to lure any significant
number of our Negro citizens into the Party." This statement was
set forth again in the cover memorandum which the Director marked.

The point I wish to make here is this: The fact that this
has been our historical position in the Bureau for many years is no
| reason to assume that it is the correct position at this time, as the
rector has clearly explained. fimeS and conditions change and, as
the evidence mounts, iiabateate we need to change our position along
with this evidence.

-Interpretation: oe

As we know, facts by themselves are not too meaningful,
for they are-somewhat like stones tossed in a heap as contrasted
to the same stones put in the form of a sound edifice. It is

obvious to us now that we did not put the proper interpretation upon
|| the facts the facts which we gave to the Director.

i Martin Luther King:

We have been aware of the communist influence for nearly
two years on Martin Luther King, Jr., head of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, and in the comprehensive memorandum entitled
“Communist Pariy, USA, Negru Questiva," dated 6/23/05 we set cut
information to the effect that a number of Negro leaders in this
country have had subversive connections in their backgrounds and
that Martin Luther King, Jr., has been dealing with:Stanley Levison,
a concealed communist! as well as! fHunter Pitts O'Dell, a secret
member of the Nationa} Committee of the’ CPUSAY As previously
stated, we are in complete agreement with the Director that
i communist influence is being exerted on Martin Luther King, Jr.,
rand that King is the strongest of the Negro leaders. As we have
stated before in a memorandum, we regard Martin Luther King to
be, the most dangerous and effective Negro leader in the country.

In addition, we know the Party is directing a major effort toward
strengthening its position among the Negroes inasmuch as we have
information the Party plans to intensify its efforts to exploit
the racial situation for the purpose of gaining,influence among
the Negroes. To this end, the Party plans to hid a highly se-
“eretive leadership meeting in November, 1963, which will deal
primarily with the Negro situation, This meeting is to be preceded
by a[Gus Hall ,"barnstorming" trip through key areas of the
country to méét Party people and thus better prepare himself
for the November meeting. Furthermore, in the last few days
Halifhas advised _an informant he contemplates requesting the
evison brothers |to set up an office in Atlanta, Georgia, to.
be used by(Huntéer Pitis O'Dell/ which will serve as the office
for "Freedomways;" a Communist Party sponsored publication, and
as headquarters for Communist Party activity in the South.

i a - .
SAC Letter to the Field + '

I would-like to set forth here briefly why I think that
the enclosed SAC Letter, which was returned to us by the Director,
should be sent to the field offices. My first reason is this:

We need to renew our efforts and keep the pressure on and leave

no_stone unturned to develop every and all facts which exist
in this matter, Some of these facts may not yet hi been

Uiearthed by our field offices, and will not be unless we
follow up this matter evermore closely with them. My second
reason why I think the SAC Letter should be sent is related

to the present changing situation inthe Communist Party - Negro

‘xelations area. During the past two weeks in particular there

have been sharp stepped-up activities on the part of communist
officials to infiltrate and to dominate Negro developments in
this country. Further, they are meeting with successes, This
should be no surprise to us because since the Negro march on

| Washington on August 28 communist officials have been doing all

pessible to exploit the very troubled racial situation, As
they said weeks ago, the end of the Negrq march would be the
beginning of evermore systematic activities cn their part to
penetrate and influence Negroes and Negro leaders, They are
now in full force acting upon this intention of theirs expressed
weeks ago. The field should be alerted to this fact and given
instructions to investigate exhaustively new communist - Negro

_ activities, The SAC Letter in question will be a-great help

toward this end, and it should result in our developing important
facts relating to the current changes and pertinent activities

going on during the past few weeks in this entire field.

Subject of Deep Concern

May I repeat that our failure to measure up to what the

This matter had been brought to the attention
of Dr, King some time ago by me, but in accordance
with conversations which the Attorney General
had with Courtney Evans, it was not felt to be wise
in view of the sources of the Bureau*s informa
tion to state that I knew O*Del1 to be under Communist
infiuence or control at any time, JI did inform ..

Dr. King and two members of his organization «a.

Reverend Andrew Young and Reverend Wyatt Walker «+

some time ago +. that since O*Deil was believed by

many people to have had Communist connections, his |
association with their organization was not in the

best int sts of the organization,

At that time, inconclusive steps were taken *"
to remove O*De1i, and’his job with the Southern ”
Christian Leadership Conference was changed, In
response to direct questions whether I had hard evidence
of O?Deil*s Communist connections, however, I replied
that I was not in a position to give any,

Following further conversations with Mr, |

Evans in June, however, I brought the matter to the
attention of Dr, King very explicitly in my office
on the morning of June 22 prior to a scheduled neeting
which Dr, King had with the President, This was
done at the direction of the Attorney General,
Later that morning both the Attorney General and |

Dx. King stated that the connection would be

both received copies of the attached letter, dated
July 3, , 1963, from Dr, King to O*Deil,

On the same occasion, IT also informed Dr.
King that our information was that Stanley Levison
was a,secret member of the Communist Party.
This was also done after conversations with Mr, Evans
prior to the meeting with Dr. King, and was done at
the Qirection of the Attorney General and the
President, Prior to that time, again based upon
talks between the Attorney General and Mr. Byans at
which I was present, it had been decided that it
was not in the best interest of the United States to
inform Dr, King that we had any firm information
that Levison was under Communist control, i had,
however, on a previous occasion, warned Dre King
about any association with Levison, basing the
warning upon doubts about Levison's loyalty to the
United’ States.

DeLoach to Mohr 11-18-64 |
Re: Sarah McClendon, Background Briefing Sessions Group
Appointment with the Director, 10:00 a.m., 11-18-64

Miss Monberg interrupted the Director's briefing to state that the reportex
would like to know, before continuing the briefing, just how the Director achieved the
success he had over the years. The Director replied by giving a brief resume of his
career. He spoke highly of the personnel in the FBI and of the devoted and dedicated
service of our personnel, He spoke of giving positions to wives of Agents who had been
killed in the line of duty. He mentioned that he personally presented service keys to
personnel who had completed 25, 30, 35 and 40 years in the FBI's service. The Director
told of his policies with respect to the fact that male clerks are encouraged to attend
college. He mentioned the good experience given onthe tour route to male clerks.

The Director outlined the structure of the FBI to the reporters. He
mentioned the 56 offices and the 10 foreign offices. He described the foreign offices as
liaison listening posts. He mentioned that FBI foreign offices have excellent liaison with
their opposite numbers who represent other countries. He briefly described the FBI's
liaison section and the fact that meeting other government personnel on a man-to-man
basis promoted efficiency. He stated this prevented a flood of memoranda between
government agencies.

The Director told the reporters that the FBI has jurisdiction over
approximately 170 violations. This is the largest number handled by any government
agency. He stated that the Congress passes more laws each year and due to the’
confidence and faith that Congressmen have in the FBI we are often penalized by getting
additional jurisdiction each year. He stated he does not want the FBI to get larger and
that he shudders now when he realizes that we have approximately 15,000 employees.
The Director gave as an example of increase in jurisdiction the incident wherein the late
Senator Pat McCarran insisted that the FBI be given enforcement jurisdiction over the
theft of cattle being taken interstate,

As a further example of increase in jurisdiction, the Director mentioned
the kidnaping statute and the fact that the Weinberger case caused the
Congress to reduce the presumptive clause to 24 hours rather than the 7 day rule. The
Director explained that sometimes when we do a good job we are penalized because
Congress increases our burdens. :

The Director stated that rather than burdening the FBI, the Congress and
the general public should look to strengthening local law enforcement. In this regard,
the Director stated he had been more or less of a "states rightist" all of his life. He
added that local law enforcement should be stronger with respect to enforcing violations.
He stated that local communities should look after their own violations rather than
causing the Federal Government to infringe upon them. In some instances, however,
lJocal authorities are not anxious to enter investigations of civil rights type. The Directoy
stated that the trouble in Mississippi and many parts of the South over the past 3 years
was partially the fault of the Justice Department because of the "harsh approach" used
in promoting civil rights.

Delscach‘to Mohr 11-18-64
Re: Sarah McClendon, Background Briefing Sessions Group
Appointment with the Director, 10:00 a,m., 11-18-64

The Director briefly discussed his trip to Mississippi and his meeting with
Governor Johnson. The Director stated that Governor Johnson had forthrightly indicated
he was a “segregationist, ** however, he did not believe in bloodshed, violence or
violation of the laws. The Director stated he had explained the reasons for his -
appearance in Mississippi and, as a result, he and Governor Johnson had gotten along
extremely well together. Because of the common meeting ground, the Federal Govern-
ment had a good relationship with Governor Johnson as of today.

: The Director stated it was sometimes difficult to obtain convictions in
southern civil rights cases, He stated he thought that our case in Georgia in which
Colonel Lemuel Penn had been murdered had been "foolproof, '' He explained that the
subjects in this case had talked among themselves that they were going to "kill a Nigger”
and that without knowing the identity of Colonel Penn they had wilfully murdered the first
stranger they had come across. The Director stated a confession had been obtained in
this case, but despite this fact, the jury acquitted all of the defendants and then later
shook hands with them, The Director stated this, of course, was absolutely outrageous.

The Director described the Atlanta, Georgia, Police Department under
‘Sheriff Jenkins as one of the best in the country. He added, however, that when a person
goes back in the hill country of Georgia or Mississippi he finds numerous water moccasins
rattlesnakes and redneck sheriffs. He added that Mississippi probably has some good
sheriffs and that he wanted to make it clear that the Mississippi Highway Patrol was an
outstanding organization who had been very cooperative. The Director added that we had
trained a number of representatives of the Mississippi Highway Patrol at the specific
request of Governor Johnson and that our next National Academy class would have
additional representatives in attendance.

The Director told the reporters that there had been less than 1, 000
employees in the FBI when he became Director. He stated he had always insisted that
our Agents be above average, in appearance, education and ability. He explained that
these qualities were prerequisites to men handling themselves adequately, particularly
in court, He stated that forthrightness was always needed in law enforcement, He added .
that a man can be a good investigator yet present a bad impression because of his :
personal appearance.

The Director stated that a real fetish with him was the fact that many
people thought that the FBI both investigated and prosecuted, He stated that the FEL does
not recommend; we merely set forth the facts; we do not reach conclusions. The
| Department of Justice handles prosecutions,

Re: SARAH McClendon, Background Briefing Sessions Group
Appointment with the Director, 10:00 a,m., 11-18-64

The Director explained that during the last fiscal year the FBI obtained
12,191 convictions. He stated that 96.5 % of the defendants brought to trial in FBI
cases were convicted, 91% of these defendants pled. guilty. Fines,savings and
recoveries amounted to $210,771,402, This represents an excess of $24 million over
the previous year, During the current fiscal year the FBI is running ahead in this same
category. For every dollar spent in the expense of running the FBI, we return to the
taxpayer approximately $1,43, The FBI apprehended 12, 810 fugitives during the past
fiscal year. At this point the Director briefed the reporters concerning the "Top Ten"
program and specifically placed emphasis on the tremendous cooperation given to us by
the Nation's communications media, The Director stated it was an accepted fact in the
underworld that once a criminal is placed on the "Top Ten" by the FBI he will definitely
be apprehended, aa

The Director next talked generally regarding organized crime. He stated
we have over 5, 000 investigations in progress today concerning this phase of our work,
This includes investigation of Cosa Nostra as well as gambling and other dements. The
Director told the reporters that up until this year the FBI had, for a long time, stated
that the cost of crime was $22 billion per year. The cost is now $27 billion per year,
The Director stated the FBI has been successful in penetrating organized crime
syndicates. This includes Cosa Nostra, FBI successes have largely been based through
the usage of informants, He stated the informant is a very important and very necessary
element of our fight against crime, As an example, informants located 2, 600 criminals
during the last fiscal year. Over $7 million in contraband was located, The Director
categorized informants as truly patriotic individuals. He stated that many informants ard
not paid but are willing to work because of their patriotic beliefs.

The Director stated he vigorously opposed a national police system in the
United States, He added that a "clearinghouse" established by the Federal Government
would be a step in this direction. He stated this was not needed. He explained that
during the past fiscal year the FBI furnished over 187,000 items of information to the
local police. This cooperation enabled local authorities to make over 3,000 arrests and
to recover millions of dollars in merchandize, The Director hit the idea of a "clearing-
house" once again. He stated we must be realistic in understanding that some police
are crooked, He added that some local law enforcement authorities are on the payroll of
Cosa Nostra. He explained that some individuals backing the idea of a "clearinghouse"
represent the type of person who wants to play “cops and robbers," He stated that if
local authorities are honest they can obtain information from the FBI. If they are not
honest they do not receive this information, In one large Metropolitan area 400 gamblers
were arrested within the past two years as a result of information furnished by the FBI to
local authorities, In this particular area, however, we found it necessary to deal with
the County Attorney and not the local police in that city. In Youngstown, Ohio, there have
been 80 gangland bombings in the last 10 years. Approximately 2 years ago the FBI went
into Youngstown, As a result of our efforts, 37 racketeers have been indicted, The
Youngstown police are now showing more cooperation.

Re: Sarah McClendon, Background Briefing Sessions Group
Appointment with the Director, 10:00 a,m., 11-18-64

The Director next spoke of crime in general, In 1963 there was an
increase of 10% in general crime; 2,259, 000 serious crimes having been committed,
This exceeded the previous year by approximately 208,000, Crime outpaced the growth
of population by a percentage of 5to 1, The Director then gave statistics in various
categories to back up his facts.

The Director made reference to juvenile criminality. In explaining the
growth, he stated that persons under 25 years of age were responsible for 72% of crime
in the United States. He stated he was in violent disagreement with the "bleeding hearts”
or "pseudo liberals" who desire to raise the legal age of juveniles to 21 years of.age.
Amore realistic approach would be to reduce the age to 16 years of age.

The Director presented statistics concerning auto theft. He spoke of
apathy and lethargy and gave as an example the incident of the young woman in New York
being murdered while 37 people looked on and did nothing about it, He spoke of the
undesirability of walking the streets of New York or Washington during the night hours,
He stated that Central Park in New York City was a variable jungle at night. He stated
there had been holdups on Fifth Avenue in New York after 9:30 p, me

The Director made reference to recent riots in New York City and to the
fact that a young Negro, 15 years of age, had touched off a race riot by his attack upon a
police officer, The Director then stated, on an off the record basis, that the FBI had
attempted to obtain the record of the young Negro, however, one Judge Kelly had refused
on the basis that he was a juvenile, The Director stated he could tell the reporters, on a
confidential basis, that the young Negro in question had engaged in knife fights since he
was 7 years of age,

7 The Director spoke of juvenile crime and of the fact that he believes such
incidents should be made public, He stated that the public should realize the identity of
the individuals who represent a menace to society... The Director then mentioned that he
is personally held responsible if his dogs commit any incidents in destruction of property
and that, very frankly, the parents of children should be considered in the same category.
He mentioned the recent destruction of automobile antennae in Bethesda, Maryland, He
stated that crimes of this nature by young hoodlums should not be tolerated,

In speaking of juvenile criminality, the Director spoke of over~indulgence
and pampering of youngsters. He explained he knew an individual whose son had been
recently arrested while in possession of a revolver. The father of the young man
threatened the police Captain by stating that if his son's name were placed on the pclice
blotter the Captain would be demoted, The police Captain did not place the name on the
blotter. The Director stated this was over~indulgence and merely encouraged the young
_man to commit further violations of the law.

Re: Sarah McClendon, Background Briefing Sessions Group’
Appointment with the Director, 10:00 a,m., 11-18-64

The Director gave another example of a friend who had come to the United
States as an emigrant and who had worked hard all of his life. This friend had a son who
made poor marks in college, however, the father gave him an airplane, a boat and an
automobile. The father often complained that his son was not "towing the mark, "" The
Director told this friend that he was indulging in the whims of his son too much and,
therefore, selling a bad example. The friend replied that he did not want his son to have
the same trials and tribulations of growth that he had suffered, The Director replied that
the son should be given some challenges in order to know what lay ahead for him in life,
The Director stated that in the case of clerical employees in the FBI, if they do not
respond to discipline they are immediately fired from the Bureau,

The Director gave examples of other violations under FBI jurisdiction and
presented statistics to reflect our successes in these fields. He specifically mentioned
antitrust violations, Federal assaults and bank robberies, In the latter regard, he
explained there were 1,624 bank robberies last year. The FBI, however, solved the
largest number of cases and obtained the largest number of convictions of any year.
Approximately$1, 300, 000 was recovered in loot, The Director explained that bank
robberies today were participated in by experienced criminais and novices. He gave as
an example an elderly lady in California who attempted to rob a bank, The Director
additionally detailed statistics regarding bribery and conflict of interest matters.

The Director next spoke of civil rights violations, He told the reporters
he wanted to dispel a number of myths concerning FBI jurisdiction and assignment of
personnel in such cases, He stated it was a common belief in some circles that Special
Agents in the South were all, without exception, southern born Agents, As a matter of
fact, 70% of the Agents currently assigned to the South were born in the North, He stated
that the notorious" Martin Luther King had attempted to capitalize on this matter by
claiming that all Agents assigned to the Albany, Georgia, Resident Agency were southern
born Agents. As a matter of fact, 4 out of 5 of the Agents assigned to the Albany,
Georgia, Resident Agency were northern born. The Director stated he had instructed me
to get in touch with Reverend King and line up an appointment so that King could be given
the true facts, He stated that King had refused to give me an appointment and, therefore,
he considered King to be the most “notorious liar" in the country. 7

The Director stated that the rumor that the FBI does not have Negro
Agents is a lie, He stated that we not only have Negro Agents but even have a number of
Indian Agents. He added that he has always strongly enforced the rule that there should
be no discrimination in the FBI, He quickly added, however, that this does not mean that
qualifications of our personnel will be lowered, He stated that regardless of a person's
color, he will not accept that person for employment.uniess he meets the high standards
of qualifications the FBI has always insisted upon,

The Director stated he wanted to make it clear that the FBI is not a
“police agency. "' We do not guard anyone; we are "fact finders"; the FBI cannot twet
nurse" anyone. The Director explained that the FBI has had remarkable success in
civil rights cases, although, to hear Martin Luther King talk the FBI has done nothing,
The Director stated that we have been able to penetrate the Ku Klux Klan and that as a
result we know what the Klan is doing currently and what they plan to do in the future.
He added that in the case of the 3 murdered civil rights victims in Mississippi he had
instructed that FBI Agents interview all members of the Ku Klux Klan to put’ them
on notice that the FBI was going to thoroughly investigate violations of the law. He added
that Governor Johnson of Mississippi had fired 5 or 6 officers who had been members
of the Klan,

The Director stated that some progress is being achieved in the South in
civil rights matters, however, there is yet considerable room for further progress. He
stated that in McComb, Mississippi, recently 3 men pled guilty to civil rights crimes,
however, the judge suspended sentence on them because of their ages. The Director
stated this was absolutely wrong inasmuch as it would establish the precedence of believing
that guilty individuals could escape the law in any locality when they commit such crimes.

The Director briefly detailed our jurisdiction regarding crimes against
aircraft and crimes on the high seas. He spoke of our jurisdiction concerning crimes on
Government and Indian Reservations. He mentioned embezzlements and gave statistics
to reflect our successes in this regard. He additionally brought up the subject of
extortion matters and stated that in kidnaping cases the FBI had investigated a total of
697 and had solved all but 3, The Frank Sinatra case had been soived in 5 days. The

. attorneys of the defendants in this case are being tried at the present time on charges of
| coaching witnesses to commit perjury by claiming the Sinatra case was a “hoax. *? The *
Director stated he wanted to state, somewhat facetiously, that if we do not solve the next «
kidnaping case within 5 days the papers may claim that the FBI has "slipped, *

The Director spoke of crimes involving the Federal Housing Administration
insurance matters and gave statistics in this regard, He additionally gave statistics
regarding fraud against the government violations, He mentioned the Fugitive Felon Act
and how our investigation in this regard had clearly assisted local law enforcement. He
| additionally mentioned such violations as illegal wearing of uniforms, impersonation,
interstate transportation of gambling paraphernalia, auto thefts, theft of government
property, White Slave Traffic Act, and security of government employees, He gave
statistics concerning all of these matters and stated that-in cases involving security Gf
government employees, over 235,000 security forms had been checked during the past
fiscal year.

The Director spoke of applicant type investigations and in this regard
stated that the FBI investigated applications for the position of Federal Judges, U. S.
Marshals, U. S. Attorneys and those applicant investigations requested by the White
House,

The Director spent some time regarding our achievements in the police
training field and particularly made reference to the National Academy. He stated that
such training has helped eliminate the need for a "clearinghouse" or National Police
Force, The Director made reference to foreign trainees in the National Academy and
stated these individuals, after graduation, returned to their respective countries to be
ambassadors of good will, He stated that such training was obviously raising the
| standards of law enforcement in foreign countries. Le ps

The Director specifically stated that in countries where there is a strong
police force communism makes few inroads, He gave the Philippine Islands as a good
example in this regard, The Director explained that we have 4, 640 gratuates of the
National Academy at the present time. The Director also explained that police training
by the FBI eliminates jealousy in law enforcement, He stated that over the years he had
personally noted a marked change in the educational background of the police officers.
He stated this had come about as a result of police training.

| The Director spoke of the FBI Laboratory and stated this is the largest
crime Lab in the world, He explained our policy with respect to examination of evidence
and the fact that we make our Agent scientists available to fee free of charge, in
local cases. .

The Director made reference to the Identification Division and explained
* that 23, 108 prints are received on an average basis each day. He stated we now have
171,340,775 prints on file. He stated this represents approximately 78 million people
inasmuch as we have a considerable number of duplications or ‘trepeats" in the receipt
of prints,

At this point the Director was interrupted with a question, A reporter
asked if prints sent to the FBI by Secret Service were returned to the Secret Service.
The Director replied that within the recent past the Secret Service has requested that
these prints be returned, He stated that we checked them, however, before they were
returned,

The Director elaborated on the fact that numerous fugitives are
apprehended each year as a result of "stop notices" being placed for the convenience of
local law enforcement, He explained that 2 man*s name means nothing, The specific
prints are what count, He stated that one example of a person having 170 aliases,
however, he can always be readily identified through the medium of his fingerprints,

The Director spoke of domestic intelligence responsibilities, He stated
that the Soviet Government had intensified their efforts to obtain intelligence information
within the United States. The Director stated he often wondered how talk of peaceful
coexistence can be sincere when it is a well known fact that the Soviets intensify their
espionage activities on a daily basis. He said that the Russians obviously have a differeni
definition of "peaceful coexistence" than the Americans, He explained that there were
Several different types of espionage agents for the Soviets, He briefly discussed the iron
Curtain Diplomatic Corps and their attempt to carry out espionage. He next discussed
the deep or secret type espionage agent. The Director explained that the FBI has been
able to penetrate Soviet and satellite espionage circles, however, we, of course, have
plenty of room for improvement. He stated he would not want to indicate that the FBI has
"completely penetrated" such circles, :

The Director stated that the question was often asked of him as to whether
we have women Special Agents. He stated we obviously do not have such employees
because of the very nature of our hazardous duties, He advised that we currently have
5, 580 women employees in supervisory and responsible positions. He explained that it
would be impossible for women employees to conduct civil rights investigations in the
South and Harlem. He added, however, that our women employees are very valuable,
He stated it was sometimes necessary to use women employees in investigative and
surveillance type work, Such usage creates less suspicion on the part of subjects,

The Director spoke of the success of the child molester poster and
indicated that millions of such posters have been sent to the public in response to requests
He stated that the coloring of such poster by school children has proved to be very
effective. He mentioned a recent solid example of a little girl refusing to get into an
automobile with a stranger because she had colored a poster sent to her by the FBI.

The Director spoke of the voluntary overtime put in by our investigative
personnel, He stated there were over 3,330,200 hours of overtime put in by our
personnel during the past fiscal year. This averages approximately 2 hours 28 minutes
per day. These employees are paid for only one hour 12 minutes of such overtime, The
Director stated this reflects a dedication and devotion to duty of our employees. He gavé
an example of the man in Mississippi wo rking on civil rights matters and the fact that
many of these men have worked night and day in swamps. He stated in his opinion this
was probably the highest among all overtime in government service today. The Director
stated he was very proud of the fact that fere was a very small turnover of personnel in
the FBI inasmuch as we are a career service, He stated that 77% of our investigative
employees have served over 10 years.

The Director made reference to the "Disaster Squad," He used the recent
Nevada plane crash of Bonanza Airlines as an example, He stated this was most
distasteful work, however, our personnel had been very effective and successiul in doing
these humanitarian chores, He stated that in the Nevada plane crash, 13 out of 28 victims

The Director was asked as to whether he thought Governor Johnson of
Mississippi was doing a good job. The Director replied that Governor Johnson is
attempting to raise the standards of law enforcement in Mississippi and had asked the
FBI for considerable assistance, He stated in his opinion that Governor Johnson was
attempting to do a good job, The same reporter asked if the FBI was prepared to lend
assistance to the police in training matters in Mississippi. The Director stated he had
already answered this question and that such assistance would be in the form of :
lecturers, etc. :

A reporter indicated that the State of Mississippi spent less money per
person on education and health, however, at the same time had the lowdst crime rates,
She asked if there was something possibly wrong with crime statistics in Mississippi.
The Director replied in the negative adding, however, that it was wrong to compare
areas with each other with respect to crime statistics, The Director stated that
Mississippi was actually two states. The northern part is very beautiful and in Jackson
particularly there was a similarity to large northern cities. In the southern part of the
state there was an entirely different element. The Director stated there are many good
people in Mississippi who do not believe in violence.

Miss McClendon inquired if the FBI conducted investigations for the

Senate. The Director indicated that we conducted investigations for the House Judiciary
Committee regarding impeachment proceedings against Federal Judges and that we

* additionally made checks for several Senate Committees, including the Armed Forces
and Senate Judiciary Committees at the specific request of the Attorney General. He
explained very carefully that we loan employees to the various Appropriations
Committees; however, these employees are not under our jurisdiction when they are
on loan,

A reporter asked if one of the 3 civil rights workers whose bodies were :
discovered by the FBI had had communist affiliations, The Director replied, off the
record, that the mother and father of victim Schwerner had formerly been members of
the Party. The Director specifically stated at this point that his specific criticism of
Martin Luther King should also be off the record,

: The Director was asked if there was any truth to the fact that the FBI knew
the identities of the murderers of the 3 civil rights victims in Mississippi, He replied,
on an off-the-record basis, in the affirmative, He added that we might not obtain

The Director was asked once again as to his opinion regarding Governor
Johnson of Mississippi. He replied that he could not speak too highly of the Governor :
and that he appreciated the Governor’s reception given the FBI when our office was opentt
in Jackson, Mississippi.

The Director was asked as to whether communists have successfully
penetrated the youth of our Nation, He explained in some detail the formation of the
W. E. Bs DuBois Clubs. He also briefed the reporters regarding the Communist
Party's speaking program, He stated there were 50 appearances last year on college .
and university campuses, He stated that some campuses have even allowed the
appearance of George Lincoln Rockwell, He stated that some appearances by
communists and fanatics have been made under the guise of academic freedom. He
stated he believed in academic freedom but did not believe in "academic license, "
inasmuch as young students are entitled to the truth.

t

The Director was asked if he would comment on the fact that several
members of the police force in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, have been told they will be
fired if they did not give up their John Birch Society membership. The Director replied
that this was a problem for the city administration in Philadelphia, He stated he had no
respect for Welch, President of the John Birch Society, because of his unjustified
criticism against General Eisenhower. The Director stated that Welch might have also
criticized General MacArthur but he was not certain of this fact.

. The Director was asked for his opinion, informally, regarding the John
Birch Society. He’ replied that any group which is supposedly dedicated to observing
freedom should be meticulous in the statements they make. The Director indicated that

. if a person lies to you once he certain would not believe him again, He stated that

organizations should never make wild’ ‘Charges. He added that wild charges have even
been made against him reflecting that he was “soft on communism." He stated that he,
of course, paid no attention to these charges, that he merely considered the source.
He stated over the years he has found it necessary to develop a "hide like a rhinocerous"
in view of the many wild charges made.

The Director was asked if he would comment as to the basis for the
Baltchs being released in New York after being charged with espionage. He specified that
he would answer this question off the record. He then explained that he wanted his
answer to be strictly off the record because he did not-desire to be placed in the position
of criticizing the Department of State publicly, The Director informed the reporters that
he personally does not believe in exchanging skilled and experienced espionage agents
for just any nincompoop, He stated that some espionage agents who have been exchanged
have been very skilled individuals who later were sent bythe Soviet Union to other parts
of the world to once again conduct espionage. He stated that insofar as the Baltchs were
concerned this probably will happen in their case, The Director did not bring up the
subject of wire tapping information in this regard,

The question was raised as to whether the Baltchs were obtaining valuable
information in the United States, The Director replied that they were sent here for that
purpose by the Soviets and that some information had been obtained.

A reporter_raised the question as to whether there should be instituted a
program in which college and universities would be alerted as to the danger of
communists appearing on their campuses. The Director replied that he had constantly
called attention to this fact in speeches and articles, however, some colleges knowingly
allowed communists to appear under the guise of academic freedom.

A reporter asked if American college students were thrown off guard
because of our country's coexistence theory. The Director replied that this reporter’s
point was well taken. He explained that exchange students are usually accompanied by

KGB representatives, He gave the example of olympic contests in which the Soviets
always send along espionage agents who accompany their athletes, v

A reporter stated that there had been criticism of the FBI over the
alleged failure to investigate right-wing organizations, The Director emphatically
replied that there was nothing more right-wing than the Ku Klux Klan and the FBI had
certainly done a good job on this organization, The reporter stated this answer
satisfied her, however, asked if the Director would indicate the number of Klansmen

: in Mississippi. The Director stated at one time there was over 480 such members.

The question was asked as to whether the FBI was investigating the
Black Muslims organization, The Director promptly replied that we were well aware
of their activities.

Miss McClendon inquired as to whether the FBI investigated violations
of the wire tapping statutes. The Director replied in the affirmative, He said he wanted
to make it clear that it was not a crime to tap wires, however, it was definitely a
crime to tap and disclose the information obtained as a result of the tap. The Director
emphasized that the FBI taps wires only in instances involving kidnaping where the
victim's life is at stake or where the internal security of the country is involved, He
stated that we never usedtaps until the Russians pepetrated thecold war. He said that
the FBI has less than 80 wire taps today.

A reporter inquired as to whether the Director was in favor of average
citizens carrying a gun, He replied in the negative. He stated any individual that needs
to have a gun should be required to have alicense. The Director indicated he knew he
would run head long into the National Rifle Association by making this statement,
however, no individual should be ashamed of getting a license.

A’Lesson for Both Sides “

When FBI Director J.” Edgar
Hootie ae into the Rev. Martin

Luther’
“cusation th ng “is the most no-
torious liar in the country” was so
sizzling that the remainder of Mr.
Hoover's remarks were largely ov-
erlooked.-

“We think, however, that his oth-

er charges must be weighed in or- .
der to clearly appraise the incident.

The vetcran lawman touched on

racial issue, and it should’be noted-
that he swang steaming punches in
both directions’ —at racism and at.
civil rights leadership.. Indeed, |
though his punch at King .was one
big haymaker; his efforts in the
other direction were plentiful, pre-
cisely placed and power-packed. ”
a an ae

In retrospect, it seems obvious
that Mr. Hoover is thoroughly fed
up with excesses from both sides of
the issue, He expressed utter con-
tempt for Mississippi lawmen who

participate in racial volence, and --

he was scathing in his criticism of “
certain aspects of Mississippi jus--
lice.

Those sentiments ina man who ---

has demonstrated unswerving dedi-
cation to law and justice are, to us,
completely understandable. Cou-
pied with the pressure those feel-
‘a2s must have exerted upon his
staal restraint was recent and

Wilts ° civ: his
BLING pee banset Bhs

ing Jr. last week, the ac-

movement, For a man who tries so
manifestly to run an- irreproach-
able FBI, such aspersions must

- have seemed the vilest of canards.

There are some to whom Mr:
King can do no wrong, and, to hear

bewilderment and pained forebear-
ance was Mr. King when inter-

~ viewed in the Bahamas following
several subjects," but the prepon- :°
derance of his remarks bore on the _

the Hoover lambasting.
But one thing shone glaringly in
Mr. King’s comments: He is lament-

ably confused as to the functions }}
and powers of the FBI. 7

He was, for example, critical of

the FBI because-“no arresis” had |'
been made after several. outbreaks
., o£ violence in the South. Or should

we say outbreaks of “militant non -

. violence,” as Mr. King calls his f
“own activities? What Mr. King ob-
* viously does not understand is that |
“the FBI is not a federal police

agency; it is, as its name states, a

federal investigative bureau and is.

not empowered to make arrests ‘for

* the violation of state statutes, such,”
‘as murder. 5

yw OF. ¥
Whether’ or not it was clear to
Mr. King, we think it is clear to
most that Mr. Hoover brought us a
needed, though abrasive, lesson in
his remarks — that guilt lies on
many heads for the turbulent racial
incidents, and that Mr. King’s is
not the least nor lowermost among
them. 3, :

{FBI agents for being derelict

‘their Southern background.

Mowcver, Hoover was quite
[garding his description of the|

and gave the Negro leaders
the definite impression that!
he was sincere and deter-
mined regarding future pol-
icy. He said that if there
were any instances of failure|
by FBI agents, Dr. King
should bring them to his at,
tention and he would act
immediately.

FBI's Problems

| Hoover also listed some of
the problems the FBI faces in
the Deep South.

The No. 1 problem, he said,
is the difficulty of getting]
juries to convict. He cited the
murder of Lt, Col. Lemuel
Penn, the Reserve officer]
killed while traveling from
military duty in Georgia. The|
evidence against the mur-|

erers, Hoover said, was
overwhelming, yet a jury had|
failed to convict.

1 The No. 2 problem, Hoover
said, is that of Southern law-
enforcement officers, Some-|
times they themselves have
been responsible for beatings;

rights workers in Philadel-
phia, Miss.

Hoover said he knew the {
kind of treachery of which
these local officers were
guilty, and understood the
glaring injustice done to:
Negroes in some parts of th
South. 7
“Hoover kept reminding Dr.'{
King that the FBI is only an 4
investigative agency, that it
has no police power beyond
that,

Negro’s One Hope

Dr. King, in turn, empha-
sized to the FBI chief that {
the Negro’s one ray of hope
is the Federal Government.
In state courts, the Negro
cannot expect to get justice,
but the Federal Government,
is the Negro’s one hope of
combating despair,

Therefore, the FBI, ¥epre-|j:
senting as it does the Federal
Government, is a symbol of
fairness, Dr. King explained,
When the Negro talked of the
FBI, he had said, in the past: 1}
“Now we are going to get
results.”

But today, said Dr. King,
fwe have sometimes wondered
whether the FBI was with us.t

Hoover seemed to think
that recent criticism by|
Negroes was a personal at,
tack on him.

During the conversation,|
Hoover also seemed inclined,

told them that King had re-

From Gazette Press Sertices
4 A simmering feud between FBI Director nr ee
Hoover and Negro integration leader Rev. Martin Luther
iKing Jr. exploded into the open Thursday. “There weté——~
iealls’ by some Negro leaders for Hoover's resignation.

King accused Hoover of irresponsibility and said that,

the longtime FBI chief “has apparently faltered under the
awesome burden, complexities and responsibil ities of his

This charge prompted Geor-
gia Governor Carl E. Sanders
toi say at Atlanta that “1 don’t
know anything about this ‘reign
of terror’ in Georgia. I tkink
ith's statement is rather strahge
sitce it comes from one who
professes to be against violence
and terror.”

King, who was in the Ba-
lhamas to write his speech ac-

epting the Nobel Peace Prize,

said that Hoover made his “vi-
cious accusation” while “under
extreme pressure.”

“This pressure,” King said,
“has come from the racial front}
and from the Warren report
aising serious questions about
he effectiveness of the FBI.”

King drew support from six:
other Negro leaders, who told!
President Johnson that they’
shared King’s view that the FBI!

had not provided protection for!
Negroes in the South.
“We expressed our disagree-'
ment with Mr. Hoover’s charac-
terization of Dr. King,” said
Roy Wilkins, executive director|
of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored
People.

‘ilkins said the Negro lead.
ets expressed themselves inci-
fdentally about King and the FBI
during an hour-long meeting]
with President Johnson. He said
Mr. Johnson ‘simply listened]
and gave no comment and no]
opinion.”

nine men convicted of bombing and
burning a Negro church. Around
Philadelphia, Miss., he said, law-
enforcement officials participate in
crime. Southern bombings and burnings
are the work of the Ku Klux -Klan and
the FBI now knows pretty well who
they are.

But the facts, even if Mr. Hoover’s
version cf them were 100 per cent
accurate. hardly justify his heated
statement that Dr. King is “the most
notorious liar in the country.””

This was based on Dr. King’s
fsupposed statement that FBI agents in
Albany, Ga., wouldn’t act on Civil
Rights complaints because they were
Southerners. Mr. Hoover savs four ovt
of the five agents in Albany are frorn
the North.

Dr. King insists he didn’t say it. He
has “sincerely questioned’’
-effectiveness of the FBI in racial
incidents but he never atiributed this

Washington, Nov. 20—Now-that the Presidential clec-

leadérs of the civil rights movement imposed upen them-

American society as it is, not as
-they would like it to be.
{Also during the moratorium
the Civil Rights Act, -signed into,
law July 2, was given a chance to
go into operation under reason-
. [ably good circumstances. Despite

a few publicity-grabbing instances
of defiance, the new law did take
hold, perhaps even more success-
fully than its supporters had an-

One of these is former Florida

“DATED NOVEMBER 19, 1964 1 + Mr. McGowan Pir ial
CIVIL RIGHTS MATTERS 2- Mr. Martindale y¥ |

Martin Luther King, Ires submitted a telegram from Atlanta,
11/19/64, regarding the Director's remarks to the press on 11/18/64.
King's telegram is analyzed below.

KING STATES: He has questioned the Bureau’s effectiveness but has never
attributed this merely to the presence of Southerners in
the FBI.

In November, 1962, in discussing racial disturbances in Albany}
Georgia, King was ely quoted in the press as stating that
of the greatest problems regarding the FBI in the South is that the edits
are white Southerners who have been influenced by the mores of the

community. This is, of course, absolutely false, and it is noted that /\~~
four of the a Agents then assigned to Albany, Georgia, were Northerners.

KING STATES: “Not a single arrest was made in Albany, Georgia, during the
many Pee eereenee against Negroes.

FACTS: During the Pees of 1962, there was a continuing series of mass

racial meetings, marches and demonstrations by Negroes in the
Albany,. Georgia, area, This resulted in numerous multiple arrests of
Negroes for lying down in the street, blocking traffic and disorderly
conduct, During this period, numerous allegations of civil rights
violations were made to Bureau Agents and Department officials, In every
instance-the Department was advised of the complaint and the results of
,,any “investigation conducted. Any additional investigation requested by
[Bs Department was immediately and thoroughly run out and the results
\furnished ‘to the Department. The Department did not see fit to prosecute
[ie of the. -incidents arising out of these demonstrations.

Denver Edgar Short, Jr., Deputy Marshal, Sasser, Georgia, which is about
20 miles from Albany, Short intimidated voter registration workers on
8/30/62, and FBI investigation developed that Short cursed the victims,
ordered them out of town and fired his gun in the direction of their tires.
‘AU. S. District Court Petit Jury acquitted Short of civil rights charges

| During this same period, however, prosecution was brought against
on 1/25/63,

RE: TELEGRAM FROM MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR,
DATED NOVEMBER 19, 1964

It is also noted that on 9/17/62, FBI Agents arrested four
| white subjects in the vicinity of the I Hope Baptist church, a Negro
church near Dawson, Georgia, and about 30 miles from Albany, which had
been burned that day. In the absence of a Federal violation, confessions
obtained by Bureau Agents were made available to local authorities
resulting in a seven year sentence for each of the three adult subjects
and three years probation for the fourth subject who was a juvenile,

On 10/4/62 Bureau Agents arrested Jack Phelix Smith and a
detainer was placed against Douglas Howard Parker, a state prisoner,
on civil rights charges in connection with the burning of the Shady
Grove Baptist Church near Leesburg, Georgia, on 8/15/62. This was a
Negro church approximately 12 miles from Albany. Smith and Parker are
white, A Federal Grand Jury failed to indict, and our evidence was made
available to state officials who presented the case to a local grand jury
which also returned a no bill,

KING STATES: Not a single arrest has been made in connection with the
bombing in Birmingham or the three murdered civil sighis
workers in Mississippi.

bombed 9/15/63 killing four Negro children, We immediately
launched the most intensive type of investigation which is still
vigorously continuing. Our investigation was prejudiced by premature
arrests made by the Alabama Highway Patrol, and consequently, it has
not yet been possible to obtain evidence or confessions that would insure
successful prosecution although we have identified a small group of

FACTS: The Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama, was
Es believed to be responsible,

We, of course, launched a massive investigation following the
disappearance of the three civil rights workers in the vicinity of
Philadelphia, Mississippi, on June 21, 1964, We located their bodies in
an earthen dam and have developed information identifying those
responsible. Intensive investigation is continuing to develop the case
for prosecution as quickly as possible,

It should be noted that our recent investigations in
‘Mississippi have produced the following positive results: (1) Eleven
arrests in McComb on state charges involving bombings and other violence.

Nine of those arrested have pleaded guilty or nolo contendere and

received probationary sentences; (2) Seven arrests in Natchez on

state charges involving shooting incidents and a beating; (3) Two

subjects arrested on state murder charges 11/6/64 in connection with
the killing of Henry Hezekiah Dee and Charlie Eddie Moore; (4) Seven
arrests for racial violence by the Sheriff of Pike County who stated
this resulted from his success in practicing Bureau methods he
observed during our recent investigations; and (5) FBI Agents have
arrested five present and former law enforcement officers in Neshoba
{County on charges of police brutality. They are presently awaiting trial.
KING STATES: FBI Agents work with local officers on criminal cases
making it difficult for them to effectively function
where Negroes are threatened,

illustrated by our currently effective cooperation with local
officers in Mississippi, our arrest of five officers in Neshoba County,
Mississippi, our effective cooperation with local officers in the
Georgia church burning investigations, the Penn murder case and many
other cases in all parts of the country.
KING STATES: He has no record of a request from the Director to

meet with him.

| FACTS: This is a shopworn canard, the falsity of which is clearly

FACTS: In November, 1962, Assistant Directors DeLoach and Sullivan

sought to make an appointment with King to straighten him out
; With regard to his public remarks concerning our performance in Albany,
Georgia. King was never availake on the telephone and left instructions
with his secretary on 11/28/62 that he would call us when he was willing
¢ to arrange an interview. He did not call us and on January 15, 1963,

we decided to make no further effort to contact him. .
KING STATES: He has always made himself available to Atlanta FBI Agents.
FACTS: In July, 1961, it was necessary to contact King in connection
with the investigation of Theodore Edward Brown, a special
inguiry for the Peace Corps. An appointment was made through King's
secretary for his interview 7/22/61; however, King kept the Agent

waiting for one hour past -the appointed time and stated he was behind
in his paper work and had completed some of it before admitting the Agent.

HET

In June, 1962, efforts were made to obtain an appointment with
King in connection with a case involving Shirley Blackwell Cummings ,
a Peace Corps applicant. Beginning on approximately 6/5/62, King's
secretary kept stating the he was not available for interview although
it was known to us that he was in his office daily. On 6/8/62 Wyatt T.
Walker, King's assistant, advised the Atlanta Office that he and King
were proceeding to Shreveport, Louisiana, in connection with the voter

registration drive and that the Little Union Baptist Church in

Shreveport had received a bomb threat. At that time, Walker was informed
that Agents had been urgently trying to make an appointment with King

and Walker stated an appointment would be made, On 6/8/62, King
telephoned the Atlanta Office from Shreveport to inquire as to why the
Agent wanted an appointment and to advise of the bomb threat previously
furnished by Walker. King consented to interview which was conducted

16/0/62.

King was also interviewed by the Atlanta Office on 7/24/62
in connection with racial incidents at Albany, Georgia, involving
alleged violation by King of a temporary restraining order issued by
the U. S. District Court to stop demonstrations. The interview was
conducted in the U. S. courtroom where King had appeared for a hearing.

On 11/30/62, when Assistant Directors DeLoach and Sullivan
were attempting to arrange an interview with King, the Atlanta Office

contacted King" s secretary to make such an appointment at King's
convenience, The Agent was advised that King was writing a beok and
could not be reached, King's secretary was requested to have King

contact the Atlanta Office on an urgent matter but he never made such
a contact.

On 6/25/68 the Atlanta Office attempted to contact King to
advise him of a threat against his life. Efforts to contact him were
at first unsuccessful, but after a delay of some hours, King's secretary
informed him of the Bureau's interest in talking to him and arrangenents
were made for an Agent to contact King by telephone.

ACTION

(1) King states in his telegram that he would be happy to
discuss his telegram with the Director in the near future. In view of
King's character, it is recommended that the Director have no contact

with him,

(2) It is recommended that no reply be made to King's telegraz
as his character and prior conduct have made it obvious that it would be
only a futile gesture to make any effort to apprise him of the facts.

the urgency of the situation, and’the“necessity to assure the

On the attached clipping from the Baltimore "Sun, " the Director
has noted "This is in greater detail than earlier clipping which I sent through.
Even Nichols’ affidavit is set out and is the first I ever knew about it. I want
immediately a full explanation." —

The attached clipping set out details concerning a notation which appears
on the original logs of conversations overheard on the electronic surveillance
of Martin Luther King. It notes that these notations were excised from the
material which had been previously made available to the defense in the
Cassius Clay, Selective Service Act, case. We are resolving the question
of these notations and are requiring the Atlanta office to inform the Bureau
in full detail by teletype today why these notations appeared on. the original
log but did not appear on the copy of the log made available to the Department

for the Clay hearing. oe

: On June 6, 1969, Federal Judge Joe Ingraham, U. S. District Court,
Houston, ordered the Government to make available the original logs pertaining
to this case for review by defense attorneys. The defense prior to this order
had reviewed copies of the logs involved. By memorandum to the Assistant
Attorney General, Criminal Division, dated June 13, 1969, the original logs
were transmitted to the Department. Departmental attorney, Michael Epstein,
one of the attorneys handling the prosecution of Clay, made inquiry concerning .- «
the pencilled notation which appeared on the original log to the effect, Sum up
{in memo."" Epstein stated that this notation did not appear on the copy of the
log which had been made. available to the defense. The Bureau requested the
Atlanta Office on the afternoon of June 19 to obtain an appropriate affidavit
explain the significance of the notation. The affidavit prepared by SA Robert R
ols of the Atlanta Office was received at the Bureau late on the afternoon
of June 20, 1969. This affidavit explained that the notation had been made by
SA Nichols as a flag for himself to consider writing a memorandum. He stated

Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach
RE: CASSIUS MARCELLUS CLAY :

that the substance of the information did not warrant the preparation of a
memorandum. His affidavit further states that his recollection is borne
out by the absence of any such memorandum in the file. Because of the
urgency of the matter, with the concurrence of Section Chief Eddy and
Number One Man McAndrews,+this affidavit was delivered to Epstein on the
late afternoon of June 20 at which time Epstein stated that this was exactly.-
{what he needed to cut off any avenue by the defense to attack previous testi-
mony given by SA Nichols to the effect that no information received by him re Clay
.|had been disseminated, He stated this affidavit was consistent with SA

Nichols’ previous testimony. - Uif- 7

- ree SP) of tan deel prank

aD Bpervisor Charles J. Devic has advised that the affidavit, upon
at

+" | review he Bureau, was noted to be entirely consistent with the testimony
f already placed in the record at She hegring in Houston, the specific issue being
that there was no dissemination/6t data in the logs maintained on the
\electronic surveillance by the Atlanta office. Far this. reason, Devic states
that he believed that the affidavit was a logical extension of the earlier testimony
lof Agent Nichols in Houston and he, therefore, did not submit a memorandum
nm this point. A copy of Nichols' affidavit is attached.

ACTION:

An appropriate memorandum concerning Nichols’ affidavit should
have been prepared, This was not done and, therefore, it is recommended

that_letters of censure be directed to Supervisor Devic, Section Chief Eddy,

and Number One Man McAndrews. E

The Atlanta Division has been instructed to advise today by teletype
why the notation "Sum up in memo, " which appears on the original logs was
not made available to the Bureau when Xeroxed copies of these bgs were origin-
ally transmitted in 1968.

AFFIDAVIT OF SA ROBERT R. NICHOLS

Atlanta, Georgia, Fulton County:

I, Robert R. Nichols, a Special Agent of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, having been duly sworn,
hereby make the following statement to Charles T. Haynes,
a Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
who is qualified to administer oaths:

I have been shown @ copy of the original log
dated September 4, 1964, involving the conversation of
Cassius Clay with Martin Luther King, Jr., which log was
subject of my testimony on June 4, 1969, in United
States District Court, Houston, Texas, in the case
involving the United States versus Cassius Clay. Noted
on the left hand margin of this log is the nanawritten
notation "sum up in memo." :

When I initially scanned this log, I made the
handwritten notation "sum up in memo" as a flag to myself
to consider this as an item to be placed in memorandum
form. Upon subsequent detailed review of the entire log
and evaluation of its contents, I decided the substance

” of the information did not warrant the preparation of
“a memorandum. Therefore, to the best of my recollection,

I did not prepare a memorandum summarizing this information.
This fact is borne out by the absence of any such

memorandum in the file.

Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach
RE: CASSIUS MARCELLUS CLAY

SA Nichols explained that what was meant by his state-
ment that investigation and electronic surveillance continued after
the case was reassigned to another Agent in May, 1965, he had in
mind that technical coverage continued on the offices of the Southern
(Christian Leadership Conference after case was reassigned from him.
lz is noted that Dr. King was active in this organization. (The

technical coverage on the offices of the Southern Christian Leader-
ship Conference was discontinued on 6/21/66.) SA Nichols further
explained for a period of several weeks after case reassignment,
the Agent receiving the case conferred with SA Nichols on several
‘}occasions for assistance in identifying individuals mentioned in
the logs based on the overall case knowledge of SA Nichols. Because
of this, SA Nichols felt he was compelled to testify that he under-
stood investigation continued until some time after May, 1965.

The Special Agent in Charge (SAC), Atlanta, has advised

-} {that -baSed.on a review of this matter, it. appears that the .testimon
jas given by SA Nichols was gratuitous and hearsay The SAC stated
[BE Nichols: was not actuialiy in-a~position to tesbity regarding’ :

this information because he did not have first-hand knowledge i asee
‘concerning it.

ACKION:

standing which was not called for by the question put to him by

the defense, This has enabled the hostile press to capitalize

Re Oklahoma City letter to Bureau 10/2/69 and
Bureau letter to Oklahoma City 11/26/69.

The comments and ratings set forth in the

apply and there have been no significant changes in
performance since that time.

by the Bureau.

Since SA NICHOLS' arrival in Oklahoma City, he has
displayed an excellent attitude and eagerly accepts any
assignment which he has undertaken diligently, displaying no
enmity whatsoever toward the Bureau and I believe he is most
sincere in attempting to prove himself. He is carrying a
very heavy case load and as the Bureau is aware, is on
annual leave at the present time because of the death of
his mother in Galesburg, Illinois. His performance has certainly
been at an acceptable level of competence since his arrival
in Oklahoma City and I believe his performance has been
such to justify his removal from probation and such is
recommended.

ON PROBATION SINCE §-25-69
RE: REMOVAL FROM PROBATION

On 6-25-69, SA Nichols was CENSURED, PLACED ON PROBATION AND
TRANSFERRED from Atlanta Office where he was Resident Agent at Valdosta,
Georgia, to Oklahoma City where he arrived 7-24-69. This action was due
to circumstances concerning his testimony in a Selective Service Act
case: (Cassius Clay matter) wherein he offered gratuitous information
subject -to. misinterpretation. indicating a lack.of. mature judgment on
his part.” He “was advised*that he would not be given favorable con-
sideration to any WithinsGrade Increases which:he would be otherwise ane
eligible as long as he was in’ a probationary status.

By memorandum dated 7-23-69, it was approved that he be denied a
Within-Grade Increase effective with the pay period beginning 7-27-69,
because of his probationary status. He was appropriately advised by

CRITICISM OF MR. HOOVER AND FBLON
WIRETAPPING OF MARTIN LUTHER KING Z Cr fig
tT AAT TIN,

Reference my memorandum to you of 6 17/69, captioned
as above, in which it was approved that the Director answer a critical
letter to the Editor of "The.New York Times" by Greenawalt which appeared
in the 6/14/69 issue of that newspaper. Accordingly, by letter of 6/18/69,
the Director transmitted to Greenawalt a copy of Mr. Tolson's letter to
Carl T. Rowan regarding Rowan's unfounded charges concerning wire-
tapping.

By letter of 6/23/69, Mr. Greenawalt acknowledged the
Director's letter and indicated that at the time he wrote his original letter, —_-
he "did not have enough facts to know who was responsible for the wiretapping’ -
or whether... there were sufficient reasons to justify it.'' He then indicates ~~
that the former question has been "clarified" a good deal, and, though he
still has some doubts concerning the latter question, he can see that it may
not be possible to disclose enough information at this time for it to be com-
épletely explained to the public. Greenawalt finally states: "I am somewhat
J reassured that the tapping was done pursuant to a good faith view of the needs
of internal security and appreciate your having made that clear."

OBSERVATION: REC. o/s eee Ss G3.

Dear Mr. Hoover:
SNe “Thank you for your.letter of June 18. I am disturbed by
i your statements that my letter to the New York Times contained "unwarranted ¢
Ss criticism" of the F.B.I. and "unfounded charges." My use of the question {
oN form in the central part of that letter was meant to be honest, not }

Pee port of the Federal Coumunications Act, there were sufficient reasons a
tt to justify it. As to the former question, subsequent statements have
x clarified the matter a good deal (though to my knowledge, it has still AR
free not been explicitly stated that all tapping did stop when the authorization

ceased), In regard to the latter question, it may be it is impossible -
to lay before the public enough information about the reasons for the

va tapping for interested private citizens to make a judgment on its ad-
visability, but so far as I am aware no statements have been made since
my letter that would quiet my doubts on that score.

os baad

y I am somewhat reassured that the tapping was done pursuant to le
la good faith view of the needs of internal security and appreciate your

having made that clear. Perhaps the basic question is how broadly that

term should be interpreted when something as serious as continued wire-

CRITICISM OF MR, HOOVER AND FBLON
WIRETAPPING OF MARTIN LUTHER KING

Reference is made to Letter to the Editor from captioned
individual which appeared in the 6-14-69 issue of "The New York Times."
Greenawalt states he is "shocked by the disclosure of continuing electronic
surveillance of one of the country's greatest and most respected leaders."
Greenawalt asks who authorized such a surveillance on King, noting that
Ramsey Clark had denied one was authorized during his term as Attorney
General and had stated that any implication that the Justice Department thought
King was a national security risk is "outrageous." His letter concludes with
the insistence that there be safeguards in the Justice Department to see that
similar surveillances do not recur.

Wiretapping Dring

To“thé Editor:

On page 27 of your June 5
issue is a report of testimony
by an F.B.I. agent that Martin

. Luther: King’s telephone had
been tapped for a number of
years before his death. I may
be naive, but I was shocked by
the disclosure of continuing
.electronic surveillance of one
of the country’s greatest and
most respected leaders. Entirely
2part from the patent illegality
of this wiretapping, it is deeply
disturbing that someone like:
Dr. King, who himself could
have been thought “subversive”
only by the most fertile imag-
inings of bigoted niinds, was
subjected to systematic: inva-
sions of his privacy.

What reasons could there
have been for this continued
wiretapping? Do the-same rea-

i sons apply to all controversial _
. public figures? Who authorized
this surveillance? It is still -un-"
clear, to my knowledge, whether
Attorneys General Kennedy and.

* Katzenbach gave such authori-
zation, Ramsey Clark has said
that no electronic surveillance
of Dr. King was authorized dur-
ing his term.as Attorney Gen-
eral, and has called “out-..

f eragcous” any implication that °

persons in the Department of
Vrstice thought that Dr. King
‘was a national security risk. If
“§so, does the F.B.I, engage in
‘such systematic incursions on
‘its own initiative? :
Should the surveillance prove

“to be, in fact, as outrageous as
it appears on the limited infor-
mation we now have, are there

, any institutional safeguards in .
the Justice Department to see

| “that similar cases do not recur?

If the, public is to retain even a
modicum of confidence in the
willingness of ‘the F.B.I. and the
Justice Department to be re- .
sponsive to the most elemental *
civil liberties, someone needs to
+ “provide>.ann-answer. to -

“Tt ds Time for J. Edgar Hoover to Go a

A society is never in more
peril than when the people lose
the ability to identify a genu-
ine threat to personal liberty.

is society is in a lot of
pe we thay judge from the
public reaction — or lack of it
— to courtroom admissions of
a variety of illegal FBI wire-
taps and buggings of homes
and hotel rooms.

A Justice Department offi-
cial acknowledged in Federal
District Court that Dr. Martin
Luther King was under elec-
tronic surveillance in 1964 and
1965, and the FBI agent who
supervised this surveillance
told the court “it was my un-
derstanding: that it went on
after that.’

The whole truth is that Dr.
King’s phones were tapped,
his hotel rooms bugged, and he

"was personally shadowed right

up to the time he was slain in
Memphis on April 4, 1968..
Ancther FBI agent, C. Barry
Pickett, told the court in Hous-
ton, Texas, that for four solid
years he had listened eight
hours a day, five days a week,

to the conversations of Elijah -

Muhammad, leader of the
Black Muslims. Pickett em-
ployed both a telephone wire-
tap and a microphone planted
jn Muhammad's home. ,

These cases of electronic
eavesdropping, which violate
both federal law and a presi-
dential executive order, were
disclosed in a@’hearing on for-

Sentence for his refusal to be
drafted.

These bug gings, whi

| eaught some Clay conversa-

tions in their “net,” are but a
fraction of the illegal wiretaps
that have moved this country
far closer to a police state
than most Americans realize.

Why the bland, indifferent
reaction om the part of most
Americans?

FBI justification for such tac-
ties: “national security.”

Former Attorney General
Ramsey Clark, who states em-
phatically that the FBI had no
authority to wiretap or bug
Dr. King, asserts that “the im-
plication’ that people thought
Dr. King was a security threat
is outrageous.”

Still, that term “national se-
curity” is more powerful than
“motherhood,” for it evokes
fear, and men stil! surrender
more things — including liber-
ty — out of fear than they de
out of love.

‘The puzzling thing about
§ Clark’s' statement is that he
‘acts as though he is surprised
{ito hear of the wiretapping and

bugging of Dr. King. Could

Clark possibly have been una-

ware that FBI officials were

going before congressional
committees and partly justify-
ing larger appropriations by

titillating some congressmen
and feeding anti-King ammu-
nition to Southerners who de-
spised the civil rights leader
— all by way of revealing “tid-
bits” picked up through the
wiretaps and buggings?

Was Clark unaware that cer-
tain FBI officials were roam-
ing the country leaking to
newspaper editors poisonous
oe a Ja ae ot
what the buggings alle
had revealed? vend

Everybody else in Washing-

ton of any consequence knew
it, and many deplored it, hut
no one seemed to know how to
* go about making the FBI bend
“to the laws of the land.

There is a_nof-too-flippant
assumption in Washington that
J, Edgar Hoover has been FBI
director for 45 years because
all the recent Presidents have
assumed that he knew too
much about them to be re-
placed. Se not only was he not
replaced by any of the young-
er, very able FBI men in the
normal course of things, but
Presidents Johnson and Nixon
have felt it wise or expedient
to waive a law saying Hoover
has reached the rocking-chair

age.
Foover ought to be replaced
as FBI director — immediate-

ly.
i As Washington agency heads
go, Hoover may have dore a

:belter job than most. But the
“people of this country knew

something when they limited
the time one man might serve
in the presidency, They saw
personal fiefdoms as inimical
to the democracy, the personal
freedom, that we have come to
cherish,

If it is dangerous to havo
one man serve three full terms
as President, it is far more
dangerous to have one man
take lifetime possession of a
powerful police-investigative
agency that prods into the
deepest secrets of the most
prominent, most honored citi-
zens and has the power to dis-
credit, even destroy, almost
anyone. The kind of abuse of
and contempt for the law man-
ifest in the King and Muham-
mad eavesdropping become
almost inevitable when a man
is left in a key job as long as
Hoover has been.

Were Hoover a more
thoughtful man; or as con-
cerned about the preservation
of democracy and liberty as
his specches suggest, he would
have resigned long ago. He
would not keep putting Presi-
dents in the political bind of
deciding to keep him or ease
him out,

Tt is clear Hoover has no
‘intention of resigning. So when
does the President muster the
courage to say: “Well done,
thou good and faithful servant.

Goodbye.”? wwomce,’

Martin Luther King, during the sanitation workers'
strike in Memphis, Tenriessee, has urged Negroes to boycott
downtown white merchants to achieve Negro demands, On 3~29-68
King led a march for the sanitation workers. Like Judas leading
lambs. to slaughter King led the marchers to violence, and when
the violence broke out, King disappeared, .

The fine Hotel Lorraine in Memphis is owned and
patronized exclusively by Negroes but King didn't go there
from his hasty exit. Instead King decided the plush Holiday

_Inn Motel, white owned, operated and almost exclusively white
patronized, was the place to "cool it." There will be no
boycott of white merchants for King, cnly for his followers.

Enclosed for Pittsburgh are three Xerox copies of page

H 3389 of the Congressional Record, 5/6/68, One copy is

enclosed for Columbia for information,

It is felt that the mailing of these copies of the
Congressional Record from Pittsburgh to the people suggested in
referenced airtel would be more effective than a mailing of the
Herald newspaper from South Carolina, There would be less
chance the information would be discounted as a Klan trick if the
information was received from Pittsburgh in a way to indicate a
member of the local community sent it, Also the same page in
the Herald contains an article condemning Martin Luther King, Jr.,
and accusing him of traveling to Puerto Rico with a young girl.
If the paper were used, this information on King would only serve
to "muddy the water,", and make less effective the information on

Abernathy. vA

RALPH ABERNATHY—PREACHER
OR PERVERT

Mr. RARICK. Mr, Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
my remarks,

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentleman
from Louisiana?

‘There was no objection.

Mr. RARICK. Mr, Speaker, ever since
Ralph Abernathy assumed control of
the rich man’s “poor people’s march” to
occupy Washington, most southerners
who know about Abernathy have shud-

dered at the deceit and national prestige -

buildup given Abernathy as a leader.

We have kept our peace—knowing
that any comment would not receive fair
consideration—in all probability dis-
‘counted as “racism.”

But the news establishment, knowing
the facts, continued to be silent until
the Montgomery Advertiser on May 2,
1968, spoke out.

In a lead editorial captioned, “The
Leader of the Great Crusade,” the
Montgomery Advertiser slashed into
Abernathy's reputation by calling him,
“an unpolished and disreputable clod’+
and politely, I assure you, rehashed the
sex scandai involving Abernathy and a
15-year-old female member of Aber-
nathy’s church. C

I have a complete transcript of the
testimony of the exploited girl given at
the jury trial of her husband—who was
acquitted by a jury of chasing and strik-
ing at Abernathy with a hatchet,

The testimony of the youthful victim,
Vivian MeCoy Davis, uncontradicted by
Abernathy, is so filthy and perverted
that I cannot—in good conscience—
Place it in the Recorp for our colleagues’
examination.

I will, however, make her testimony
available on request to my colleagues,
or it can be obtained from the Herald,

Carolina’s oldest Negro newspaper—by

of the sordid background of Ralph Abe.
nathy including the testimony,

I can only add that Abernathy ap.
parently has little control over himself
he couldn't have control of the threa:.
ened booby trap merging on Washington
under the banner of a poor people's
march. But he can be used to exploit
Poor people.

Mr. Speaker, I place the May 2 edito.
rial from the Montgomery Advertiser in
the Recorp at this point:

THs Leaver oF TH Great Crusape

It ts preposterous but unfortunately true
commentary on the recent history of the
most powerful country on earth that it ts
now recelving ultimatums from the kes of
Ralph D, Abernathy.

Abernathy succeeded to the late Dr. King’s
mantle in the Southern Christian Leadership,
Conference by virtue of an association dat-
ing from the Montgomery bus boycott,

King was at least glib and adroit in the
guile by which he managed to flummox an
alarming number of Americans, But Aber-
nathy Js an unpolished and disreputable clod
best remembered here for what may have
been a record dash from his church office
on the night of Aug. 29, 1958. 7

Panie-stricken and screaming, he ‘was
pursued by an irate, hutchet-wlelding hus-
band who had accused him of having a.rela.
tionship with his wife more suited to the
pages of Krafft-Ebing’s Psychopathia Sezualts
than a family newspaper.

‘The wife of his assailant told a Montgomery
Cireult Gomi juiy 1 Nov
she had submitted to unnatural sex acts
with the Reverend before her marriage, be-
ginning at the age of 15, and that “he never
stopped chasing me” even after her marriage
to Edward Davis. She had been a member of
Abernathy’s church.

On the day Davis accosted Abernathy in
his office, armed with pistol and hatchet,
Abernathy had called her. Mrs. Davis testif

‘The jury deliberate..;only 10 minute:
obviously invoking the “mwritten law, be
fore acquitting Davis of attempting to do in
the preacher.

Yet, basking In the reflected glory of King.
Abernathy emerged from the revolting case
‘unscathed in the eyes of SCLC,

In 1960, he was Signally honored by Prime
Minister Kwame Nkrumah, the subsequently
deposed dictator of Giana, by being Invited
to Accra for a “Conference on Non-Violence
and Positive Action for the Security of
Africa.”

This was heady stuff for a man who, but
for his color and the accident of tlme and
place, would never have been heard from.
But he was to go on to loftior things, despite
his unsavory background, finally being ele-
vated to King’s throne after the tragedy In
‘Memphis.

‘Monday he led the vanguard of 2 move-
ment which fs trying to intimidate Congr
not only into massive reciistribution of.
wealth to the poor (along with the shiftiess).
but into changing foreign policy. Vietnam ts
only one item of the agenda of the amer
phous mass which may number In the t
of thousends (hundreds of thousands, some
say) Who will attempt to immobilize Wash
ington by late May.

In their initial protest Monday, the Aver-

nathy-led extortionists denounced U.S. dipto-
matic and business ties with Portugal
South Afrien, The United States must not
‘be encumbered, the formal statement sald,
“with the support in any way of racist
societies abroad.”

Although Abernathy keeps mouthing the
old line about non-violence, this ts once agaln

semantic camouflage for the threat of Wlo-
lence unless Wi: lent

us Agured, there will be shantytowns all over
washington and the work of government
pheuld be paralyzed—uniess:

‘The government meets all demands, in-
ciding massive new federal programs and
jouits, a guaranteed income for everyone,
ratization of welfare programs and regu-
ons, and stich changes in foreign policy
as the blackmatlers may demand.

‘Terror is not the appropriate reaction in
Washington: righteous anger is; accompa-
nied by massive force. Unless authoritles
have the courage to turn back this invasion,
‘by whatever force is necessary, and refuse to
be intimidated, the words of Senator Robert
¢. Byrd, West Virginia Democrat, will prove
prophetic:

“E am_ greatly concerned for my coun-

dence ‘of destruction of our nation from

Tt would all be sickening enough if the
leadership were other than Ralph Abernathy,
an unprinelpled and unspeakable bum with-
out any redeeming qualities whatever; @
demagogue worse than Stokely Carmichael
if only because he’s so stupid: a degenerate
unfit to lead the smallest rural church, much
less pose as the representative of America’s
unfortunate poor. '

WILBUR MILLS HONORED BY
CLEMSON - UNIVERSITY

Mr. DORN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent to address the House for
1 minute and to revise and extend my
remarks,

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentleman.
{rom South Carolina?

There was no objection.

Mr. DORN. Mr. Speaker, Wits0r

Mitus, our esteemed and beloved col-
league from Arkansas, was honored by
Clemson University in my congressional
district on Saturday, May 4.
_, When Clemson University honored our
distinguished colleague, Wiubur Muruts,
Clemson was in turn honored. As chair-
man of the great Committee on Ways and
Means for more than 10 years, WILEUR
Mitts has exercised a great and bene-
ficial influence on this Nation, and indeed
on the entire free world. His wise counsel
and superb leadership in international
trade, taxation, social security, and fiscal
Tesponsibility has profoundly infiuenced
the destiny of this Nation and the course
of freedom in the Western .World.

Witcur Minus was awarded an honor-
ary doctor of laws degree by Clemson
University for his statesmanship and
leadership in preserving the economy of
cur country and for his forthright stand
for fiscal responsibility.

Mr. Speaker, it was fitting and proper
that our great colleague be honored at
Clemson University, named for Thomas
G. Clemson, son-in-law of John C. Cal-

(NW 64578 Docld:32989652 Page 322

CONGRESSIONAIQQECORD — HOUSE doses

houn, and the first Superintendent of the
Department of Agriculture. Clemson Uni-
versity is on the old plantation of the
immortal John C, Calhoun, one of.the
five greatest Senators of all time.

Mr, Mitts, while in the Calhoun man-
sion—one of the best kept shrines in
America—was presented a gavel and
pounding block made from a tree grown
on the Calhoun mansion grounds by Dr.
Wright Bryan, Clemson vice president
and former editor of the Atlanta Journal
and the Cleveland Plain Dealer.

The lovely and charming Mrs. Mills
accompanied her distinguished husband
to the Clemson campus. His excellency,
the Honorable Robert E. McNair, Gov~-
ernor of South Carolina, and our own be-
loved and great colleague, the gentleman
from South Carolina, MenpEL Rivers,
chairman of the Committee on Armed
Services, were present for this, one of
the most momentous occasions in the his-
tory of my congressional district and in-
deed the State of South Carolina. The
dynamic and able president of Clemson
University, Dr. Robert C. Edwards, pre-
sented this coveted honorary degree to
Chairman Mitts on behalf of the board
of trustees and the faculty.

Mr. Speaker, the chairman of the
Clemson board of trustees is a friend of
yours, the Honorable Edgar Brown, of
South Carolina, who sat beside William
Jennings Bryan at the Democratic Na-
tiona] Canventian in New York in 1924
and who for 40 years, as State senator
and as chairman of the senate finance
committee, has provided for South Caro-
lina fiscal responsibility. Mr. Speaker,
another lifetime member of the Clemson
board is the Honorable James F. Byrnes,
who served with honor in this House and

the Senate and was perhaps best known -

for his distinguished service as Secretary
of State and as “Assistant President”,
under the wartime administration of
President Franklin D. Roosevelt,

Mr. Speaker, I commend Clemson Uni-
versity for honoring, on its graduation
day, this great and good American who
today is providing that leadership so
essentfal to the future of young America,

EXPLANATION OF GENERAL PAIR

Mr, FULTON of Pennsylvania. Mr,
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to
address the House for 1 minute.

‘The SPEAKER, pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentleman
from Pennsylvania?

There was no objection.

Mr. FULTON of Pennsylvania. Mr.
Speaker, on Wednesday, May 1, 1968, I
left Washington by plane at 5 o’clock
p.m. to go to West Liberty, W. Va., to
make the keynote speech at the West
Liberty State College students’ mock
national political convention.

After I left the floor on that date the
bill, H.R. 16913, making appropriations
for the Department of Agriculture and
related agencies for the fiscal year end-
ing June 30, 1969, was passed.

Iwas paired generally with the gentle-
man from North Carolina [Mr. Gati~
FIANAKIS] on final passage of that bill.

RE: COLMUNIST INFILTRATION OF THE

EvUTAERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE
100-438794

All offices are cautioned that any information
developed concerning the SCLC relating to racial matters
must be reported under the racial natters gaption, It
should be noted that the uurean maintains a separate file
on SCLC relating to racial incidents (157-632),
investigation uider the caption of this letter must be
limited to and directed toward determining the extent of
communist infiltration of the SCLC,

NOTE _ON_ VELLOW:

Review of correspondence received & the Bureau
under various captions relating to the activities of SCLC
and its leader, iiartin Luther “ing, Jr,, indicated the
CP nas been atteusiiug to exert influence on Ming and
through him the SCLC, New York and Atlanta were instructed
to make a complete review of all information concerning
this matter and to furnish the Bureau recommendations
concerning a communist infiltration investigation, ReRYlet
recommended a COMINFIL investigation of the Rew York
chapter due to the dominant CP influence on the executives
of the New York chanter of the SCLC, ReATlet also
‘recommended a COMHIFIL investigation of SCLC due to the
fact that four CP members are presently associated with
SCLC and that at least one of these members is an officer
of SCLC and close to King,

7 _ it is believed a communist infiltration
investigation is warranted; See memo Baumgardner to Sullivan,

New York 19, N. ¥. In this letter LEVISON requested to be

- furnished anapplication for registration “by a committee
in organization to be known as &£ppeal for Human Dignity Now."

One photostat of the registration statement of the
‘AFHDN pearing #9535 received by the CRB on 6/5/61 reflects
the AFHDN solicited under the slogan "Dollars for Human

~ Dignity" and seeks to provide financial assistance to the
movement for desegregation and achievement for equal rights
under the Constitution. The statement indicates there will
be emphasis on giving more assistance to the SCLC of Atlanta,
Georgia, and the Student ‘Nonviolent Coordinating Céimmittes-~
of Atlanta, Georgia. Page three of the registration statement
contains the name of STANLEY D, LEVISON as co-chairman of
the AFHDN.

The following security sources of information were
contacted on 10/8/62 and they had no information regarding
any Communist Infiltration of the SCLC, These sources are
all familiar with some activities of SCLC through their work
in the desegregation field:

It is not contemplated there would be any need for
investigation by Savannah at the Dorchester Center, McIntosh
_ (County, Georgia, The only CP member known to be active
there was O'DSLL and that was for a short period of time
in early 1962.

There is no indication that any investigation would
pe made in this matter in the Mobile Division.

| ny New Orleans, if investigation authorized by the
Bureau, should determine whether a SCLC branch has been
established in your division. if so, whether CAULFIELD,
SGN or other CP members formed or control it or have
any great influence on its activities.

~ It is obvious thatallCP infiltration or influence
known at this time is either in New York City or emanates. .
from there, The only CP member who is known to be an officer
of SCLC is HUNTER PITTS O'DELL. He divides his time between
his position of head of SCLC branch office in New York City
and his duties at Atlanta Headquarters. A411 of his known
CP contacts are in New York City with the exception of
SARGEANT CAULFIELD in Louisiana.

Correspondence received from the Atlanta and New York Offices
relating to the activities of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference
(SCLC) has indicated the Communist Party (CP) has been attempting to exert:
influence on Dr. Martin Luther King, the southern integrationist leader
and through him the SCLC. Dr. King is the President of SCLC which is
actively engaged in the integration movement in the South. Stanley David

“TLevison, a secret membér of the ce, and Hunter Pitts O'Dell, a member of
the National Committee of the oP, ere influential with Dr. King, Roth

have been identified in the past as officers of SCLC.

The New York and Atlanta Offices were instructed to make a
complete review of all available information concerning CP interest in the
SCLC and to furnish the Bureau recommendations concerning a communist | F
infiltration investigation of this organization. Both offices have ce
recommended a communist infiltration investigation of SCLC due to the
dominant CP influence on the executives of the New York Chapter of SCLC ani
the fact that four CP members are presently associated with SCLC and that at
least one of these members is an officer in the organization.

It is believed a communist infiltration investigation of SCLC is
warranted to determine the CP aa that organization. -

RECOMMENDATION: au 7 7

That the attached’letter to Atlanta with copies. to ‘pertinent fiel¢
offices authorizing a communist infiltration investigation of SCLC be i
approved. The field is being cautioned that this investigation must be
limited to and directed toward determining the extent of communist infil-
tration of the SCLC and any information developed concerning the integre-

tion or racial activities of SCLC must be reported under the racial matter

When Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING was invited to address
\ine AFL-CIO convention some time ago, KING, on LEVISON's ad-
vice, first obtained approval to do so from A, PHILLIP RANDOLPH,
? negro labor leade who, if he had not been consulted in the
fi matter, might have\felt that KING's making a speech at the
aforesaid conventiot was a blow to RANDOLPH's -prestige.

KING deliveted a remarkably effective speech at the
AFL-CIO convention, an esa result, received invitations
| Brom numerous labor leaders, including "MC DONALD of Steel,"
}to address their respective unions. As the outstanding
champion of negro rights in the country, KING is a powerful \
{political influence, recoghized as such by the higher echelons \
i of the Democratic Party. He has access to Attorney General
{ ROBERT KENNEDY and President\ KENNEDY, who, politically, need
f KING, par ularly in the Soush, where in cities like Atlanta

; and New Orleans the negro vote now constitutes the balance of
{ power, and where KING controls\the negro vote,

JAMES HOFFA, Teamsters, Union "boss" appreciates

j;ecan influence the 90,000 negro members of the Teamsters

4, Union. HOFFA invited KING to address the Teamsters Union,
;and KING accepted the invitation. \Knowing that KING is being

; deferred to by Attorney General KENNEDY, and President KENNEDY,

I { HOFFA requested KING to, contact the\Attorney General in an
effort to influence thé latter "to Dey off" HOFFA, KING was
jtinclined to do as HOFFA requested, but LEVISON convinced him
‘that to do so would,be politically unlyise, inexpedient, and
flikely to be a "bogmerang," since the \attorney General would

never accede to svich a request, partichlarly in the case of
{HOFFa, f

LEVESON had to steer KING away\from another politi-
cally hazardous situation. Some months o OTTO PREMINGER,
Hollywood movie director, entered into nekotsations with a

| KING representative for KING to play a part in a picture
}iwhich P. (EMINGER woulddirect. Although PREMINGER's offer was
j"temptirfg," since it meant "fast, easy money" for KING's
{{organjZation, LEVISON realized that for KING to accept the
ae would lower the latter's prestige. After convincing

KL. of this fact, LEVISON personally telephoned to PREMINGER,
te@ling him that "the deal was off."
