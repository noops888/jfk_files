Please make contact with Mr. IRVING DAVIDSON ((B)) »

Washington representative, address Suite 306, City Building,

1612 K Street N.W, Washington 6, D.C., District 7-3400;

and give him in the name of the Haitian Government the

folloing highly confidential message:

"The Haitian Government: has had to request of Charge

d'Affaires CURTIS the recall of three United States Embassy

officials, JOHN W. WARREN, Military Attache, STANLEY D0S2

Cultural

Attache, and JOHN MASEC ((C)), Political Counsellor.

The State Department replied that the new Ambassador has been

Instructed to discuss this question after he presents his

credentials, but that these officials will not be recalled

unless they are declared personae non grata, and that the State

Department will make reprisals.

JohntHeser

Please explain to you know who the necessity of making

a cleaning out of the Embassy so that Haitian-United States

relations may be resumed on a friendly and cordial basis.

The three officials have figured in the arousing of a

frankly hostile feeling toward the Haitian Government.

Military Attache WARREN has talked with high-ratking officers

of the Haitian Army in an effort to corrupt them and hatch

a plot against this Government. JOHN HASEC, a former member

of the Foreign Legion who came here directly from Viet Nam,

noon and night. We suspect that he has some special assignment.

He has talked about it in the course of conversations at the

Hotel El Rancho. Cultural Attache MOSS Is a declared enemy of

the Haitian Government. The latest number of the magazine

"Actualites", edited by the U.S. Embassy Cultural Service in

memory of KENNEDY is an illustration of his spirit of

hostility. At his clear choice only intellectuals who are

enemies of this Government collaborated on this number. It

contained cables of condolence from many chiefs of state, but

not that of President DUVALIER. There was no mention of the

manifestations of numerous organizations in memory of KENNEDY,

as, for example, the three days of mourning, the funeral

service, ete.

We are requesting the departure also of NORMAN WARNER

because of the categorical position of opposition to this

Government which he took during the events of April and May.

Ambassador TIMMONS has produced a bad impression. He

seems to be the man least fitted to work for a Haitian-United

States rapprochement on a durable basis. We believe it would

be advisable that he be recalled even before he presents his

credentials and that a political personage of blended spirit

who is capable of understanding be designated.

Report immediately on the result of your demarches."

THEARD is requested to explain to Mr. IRVING the United

States position on recall and reprisals and to keep the Haitian

Government informed constantly.

Please (translate Into English] for Mr. IRVING. [753
