The State e Department replied t. the new Ambassador has been ial

credentials, but that these officials will not be recalled roy

Please explain to you know who the necessity of making
a cleaning-out of the Embassy so that Haitian-United States
telations may be resumed on a friendly and cordial basis.

The three officials have figured in the arousing of a
frankly hostile feeling toward the Haitian Government.
Military Attache’WARREN has talked with high-rapking officers
of the Haitian Army in an effort to corrupt them and hatch
a plot agatinst this Government, JOHN HASEC, a former member
of the Foreign Legion who came here directly from Viet Nam,

noon and night. We suspect that he has some special assignment.
He has talked about it in the course of conversations at the
Hotel El Rancho. Cultural Attache’ MOSS is a declared enemy of
the Haitian Government. The latest number of the magazine
“Actualites", edited by the U.S. Embassy Cultural Service in
memory of KENNEDY is an illustration of his spirit of
hostility. At his clear choice only intellectuals who are
enemies of this Government collaborated on this number, It
contaaned cables of condolence from many chiefs of state, but
not that of President DUVALIER. There was ng mention.of the
manifestations of numerous organizations in memory of KENNEDY,
as, for example, the three days of mourning, the funeral
service, etc.

We are requesting the departure also of NORMAN WARNER
because of the categorical position of opposition to this
Government which he tock during the events of April and May.

Ambassador TIMMONS has produced a bad impression. He
seems to be the man least fitted to work for a Haitian-United
States rapprochement on a durable basis. We believe it would
be advisable that he be recalled even before he presents his
eredentials and that a political personage of blended spirit
who is capable of understanding be designated.

Report immediately on the result of your demarches."

THEARD is requested to explain to Mr. IRVING the United
States position on recall and reprisals and to keep the Haitian
Government informed constantly.
