SUBJECT: AMKIN, Victor Petrovich
AL-2752 - SSD-90097

A review of Subject's file has been made in connection with
a request from the CI Officer; Franch Desk, with reference to
information from the @bi j8) that Subject's Washington
pook store, as of the summer of 1959, one of the four book stores
in _ in the United States where subscriptions could be bought for "RODINA!
¢ the bulletin edited by the Repatriation Conmittes of East Berlin
WRODINA® (LA PATRIE), which is distributed in various languages
and is failed in sealed envelopes, has been forbidden distribution
in France. (See attached thermofax.

Security files reflect that in April 1957 the FBI advised that
Victor Petrovich KAMKIN, Elena Andreevna KAMKIN and Nina SAPELKIN
had been the subjects of an Internal Security ~ R type investigation
as of 1951 and thats "There is no derogatory data of 3 subversive
nature in the files of this Bureau concerning the subject of your
inquiry (KAMKIN). It should be noted, however, that Victor

Leepeaste Petrovich KAMKIN is currently of investigative interest to this

Bureau and, accordingly, it is requested that any contact of him
in behalf of_th tral Intelligence Agency be handled by this

mas. Sa atkins According to an undated blind memorandum (possibly 3 Staff C
pu$o Led uth the memorandum), Nina SAPELKIN is Elena KAMKIN's sister and as of
Brae ences 3961 was living with the KAMKINs in ennesses+ Nina SAPELKIN was
swans porn in Russia 48 August 19123 and was evacuated from Shanghai to
Samar, Philippine Islands under IRQ auspices in April 199»

accompanied by her husband Semen I. SAPELKIN and their two childrens
She came to the United States in 1952 and lived in Tennessee for

a time with the KAMKINS. The SAPELKINs reportedly renounced

Soviet citizenship in Shanghai in September or Octeber 19h8.

The KAMKINs also were born dn Russia and KAMKIN attended
high school and university in Harbin, Manchuria. Thereafter until i:
‘ 195 he wes in the printing and publishing business in Chinas and
during 19h6-L7 says he was with "Special Services, Section II,
Amph., Marine Corps", working on its newspaper, "North China
Marine". In 19h7 he was co-publisher of TFreea Word? which he says
wae an anti-Soviet newspaper closed by pressure of the Soviet

se


Consulate. From 1947 to 19h9 he stated that he was the owner of
the “Anchor Printing Shop" in which the "North China Marine"
continued publication in Tsingtao, China. The KAMKINs came to
the United States in 19h9 arriving in San Francisco in Marche

As of 1957 KAMKIN was being used on an unclassified basis by
the CIA Library asa publications procurement channel. It is, of
course, possible that Subject's interest in "RODINA" is on behalf
of this Agency.

The otker book stores involved in the report to the French
Desk were the well known Commnist "Four Continents Book Store",
(MS-2000), "Imported Publications and Products" (MS-2001-I) and
"Universal Distributors Company" (#91916). ‘These organizations are
registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The Four
Continents Book Store is flagrantly Communist needs no defining;
and the "Imported Publications and Products" is reported to be
one of the four principal outlets for Communist politicel prop-
aganda in the United States. "Universal Distributors Company" is
described as "an official distributor of Communist Party literature"
and as "Commnist controlled". It is the distributing agency for
the Four Continents Book Store.

Information from a reliable confidential informant reflects
that during the summer of 1959 KAMKIN indicated he planned to
open a branch book store in San Francisco to be operated by S.
SAPELKIN. The store was to be called Znanie, Russian Book Store,
and located at 5237 Geary Street, San Francisco. This S. SAPELKIN,
in all probability, is Mrs. KAMKIN's brother-in-law Semen I.
SAPELKIN, MS-5000, who with his wife Nina, nee DAVIDOVA, aka
DAVIDOF, was the subject of an FBI Record Check Request in May
1955. (The wife Nina, per the check sh-et, resided at Route
1, Van Leer, Tennessee from 1951 to 1952, which was the KAMKIN's
address during this period.)

The 1955 FBI Record Check Request on SAPELKIN indicated that
he was formerly a painter; that hie wife Nina was a dentist; that
both were born in Russia; that he arrived in the United States
from France around the end of 1954, was stateless and had his first
papers and that she arrived in San Francisco 5 June 1951. They
were residing at 1405 Harvard Street, N.W., Washington, D. C.
(which was the address of Subject's book store); and had formerly
resided in Tientsin and Shanghai, China. Both their children
were born in Mentsin, one in ighé and one in 19h9.

An RI check requested in 1957 for USIA indicated that the nare
Semen I. SAPELKIN appeared in a report from a reliable seurce in
May 1950, which dealt with refugees in an IKO camp at Guinan,

Samar, Philippine Islands; and, according to the report, ho had
been a member of the Russian Residents Association (probably Russian



13-00000

Emigrants Association) and of the Soviet Glub in Shanghale

An ONE name check on KAMKIN, in November 1954, reflected the
cerous-referencing of his name to "Foreign Service Dispatch, Hong Kong
#402, 22: Aagust 1952", the subject of which was "Contact of Mr.

Se Veni ASILIEVITCH SAPELKIN with the Hong Kong Consulate General";
ran while ts of a 1957 "K" check based on this same "Foreign
is Service patch, Hong Kong #402, 22 August 1952, Secret",

reads as followst "Mr. SAPELKIN reported that he had. recently
received various commnications from a White Russian friend of his,
Mr. Victor P. KAMKIN who was formerly head of the Russian Emigrants
Association in Tsingtao, China, Mr. KAMKIN left China early in
1549 and has resided in the United States since that time. Both
SAPELKIN and KAMKIN reportedly had certain contacts with a Eugene
GORDENEV, Russian-speaking officor attached to the +2 Section of
the First Marine Division in Tientsin following the Japanese Surrender
in 1945. Mre KAMKIN has now written to Hong Kong asking Mre
SAPELKIN to supply certain economic information on North China and
Manchuria for the use of the ‘American Govermmont'. Mr. KAMKIN
indicates that he is involved in certain intelligence activitics.™
fin a letter of 13 July 1950, offering his services to ONI, Subject
Tamed GORDENEV as one who could "substantiate my work in China".
ONE advised CIA that their records contained no derogatory infor-
mation regarding Subject, but that ONI did not contemplate utiliz-
ing his services.7

te Aceording to a 1955 RI check conducted on one Ale:
yt|eo Re for G-2, a report of 17 May 1950 advised that 0!
Rad beon described as an "Old Soviet worker") was closely associated
—-<° with Vemiamin Vasilievitch SAPELKIN, an alleged Soviet agent at
the IRO Camp at Samar, P. I, As reported above, Mrs. KAMKIN's
sister Nina and her husband Semen SAPELKIN were evacuated to Samar,
P. I., from Shanghai under IRO auspices in April 199.

Ventamin Vasilievitch SAPELKIN's friend ORLOFF, according to
a report of 8 April 1950, was alleged to have influenced a district
leader of the IRO Camp at Samar with pro-Soviet propaganda, and to
have worked with a number of other pro-Soviet internees in the cemp
to Sovietize the Russian refugees interned there. According to a
report dated 5 May 1950, ORLOFF allegedly was believed to be a
Soviet agent. (The report noted that this information originated
in the IRO Camp in Samar; that much information originating there
had proven unreliable; and that the reliability of this particular
information hed not been determined.)



13-00000

However this may be, it appears that there could be much truth
in the allegations. Information in Security files reflects that
ORLOFF very possibly is identical with a "Count ORLOFF of the
Russian Committes", (apparently a committee of TkO),“uho assisted
the Commercial Counselor for the Bulgarian Legation in securing
IRO employment for one Bogdana OTTAI, a possible Soviet agent in
Paris who was living with and was engaged to marry Kiril VASSIIEV,
who was believed to be an agent of the Bulgarian Military Intelligence
Service. "Count ORLOFF" also helped arrange OTTAI's entrance into
the United States. Alexander S. ORLOFF and "Count ORLOFF" may well
be identical with Alexander ORLOFF, DI-2881, a highly suspect
individual of Russian birth, and a former AMTURG employee who was
security disapproved by OSS in 1943. This latter individual, per
a 1943 OSS investigation, was known as "The Count®,

A December 195) Staff C memorandum regarding KAMKIN, reported
that unevaluated information dated 1 June 198 indicated that ons
Victor N./KAMKIN was involved in a money printing transaction with
the Jap: @, in which he used the mechinery of the Chihli Press
in Tientsin to facilitate the counterfitting. The source of this
information had pointed out the possibility that Victor N. KAMKIN
might be identified in some way with a VY. P, KAMKIN who was named
as a character reference by one Vladimir Vasily IVASHKOFF. (IVASHKOFF
was not identified.) The memorandum advised that according to a
report dated 1 June 1948 frem a U. S. Naval Attache, Nanking, to
the American Ambassador, Nanking, V. N. KAMKIN was a printer and
publisher in Shanghai and later was in charge of the Russian
Publishing Houge/ known as Nashe ZNANIE. He was closely associated
with Bernard S,/ROGARD of the Chihli Press, who in turn was
associated witfi\alleged Soviet espionage agent Olga NAKVASIN.

According to the Staff C memorandum , a report from the FBI
dated 1) August 1953 indicated that a scurce of unknown reliability
stated that one Victor KAMKIN, who operated a book store as a
possible cover in Tientsin, China, acted as a paid informer of
the Japanese during World War II; and was a paid informer of Use Se
Arny Intelligence after the War. With the assistance of the
American Military Government in Tsingtao, China, he became Chairman
of the Russian Inmigrant Society in Tsingtao in 1948. There seems
small doubt that this Victor KAMKIN is identical with Victor Ny
KAMKIN, and with Subject, Victor P. KAMKIN who was formerly head
of the Russian Immigrant Association in Tsingtao, China, accord-
ing to his friend SAPELKIN, as reported in Hong Kong Dispatch
#402, Note that Victor N. KAMKIN was in charge of a Russian
Publishing House in China known as Nashe Znanie; and that the
branch store Subject intended to open in ancisco (and may
have opened) was also to be called Znanie (this work in Russian
means "Knowledge").

(Bernard S. ROGARD of the Chihli Press, referred to

ane



above as a close associate of Subject anc also of alleged
Soviet espionage agent Olga NAKVASIN, is the Subject

of SSD file #35095. ROGARD is a former U, S. Marine whose
parents were Polish-born and who lived in China for
twenty years prior to returning to the United States in
1950. He allegedly was pro-Soviet, ie: riciculed White
Russians who did not avail themselves of Soviet citizen-

Tientsin Evening Journal, following its resumption after
the War, one Leonoff who was an employee of TASS;
followed a Commnist inspired line in his newspaper;

and published without comment in his Tientsin Evening
Journal a letter discrediting American Military Police

entsin, comparing them unfavorably with Soviet

Military Police in Harbin who were praised in glowing
termsy etc. ROGARD, "if used" by Project PILLAR,

was to be limited to Category Ils but his wife, <p
Pragunott ROGARD, #79069, had (clearance for a “very \

sensitive use on another Project¥.

(responsible positions with Agency Cover Companies) since
“1953. Her association with the Agency was terminated in
May 1959, with the termination of Project(ABEB@y but

she gave{the Agenzy\ a “hard time" for months and refused
to sign her Secrecy agreement until 30 November 1959.
Various relatives_of_hers have in the past been
associated with ‘the Agency’. Mra. ROGARD appears to
have had much the same history as Subject. She was

born in Russia of Russian-born parents, of Turko-Tartar
nationality; left Russia in 1919 for Harbins was
aducated in Mukden and Tientsiny and was employed in
Tientsin in various import-export firms, etc. (No
thorough study has been made of the ROGARDS! files.
