However this may be, It appears that there could be much truth

In the allegations.

Information in Security files reflects that

ORIOrE very posalbly is identical with a "Count ORiOfF of the

Fussian Committoe", (apparently a committoo of 1K6), Who assisted

the Commercial Counselor for the Bulgarian Legation in securing

IRO employment for one Bogdana OTTAI, a possible Soviet agent in

Paria who was living with and was engaged to marry Kiril VASSILEV,

who was belleved to be an agent of the Bulgarian Military Intelligenco

service.

"Count ORIOFF" also helped arrange OTTAI's entrance into

the Undtod Statos. Alexander S. ORIOFF and "Count ORIOFF" may w9ll

bo identical with Alexander ORIOFF, DI-2881, a highly suspect

Individaal of fussian birth, and a former AlloRG employee who was

security disapproved by OSS in 1943. This latter individual, per

a 1943 OSS investigation, was known as "The Count".

A December 1954 Staff & memorandum regarding KAMKIN, reported

that unevaluatad iniormation dated 1 June 1940 indicated that one

Victor No

KAMKIN was InvOlved in a money printing transaction with

the Japanese; In which he used the machinery of the Chihli Press

in Tient'sin to facilitate the countorfitting. The source of this

information had pointed out the possibility that Victor N. KAMKIN

migat be identified in some way with a v. ?. KAMKIN who was named

as a character reference by one Vladimir Vasily IVASHKOFF. (IVASHKOFF

was not identifiod.) The memorandum advised that according to a

report dated 1 June 1948 frem a U. S. Naval Attache, Nanking, to

the American Ambassador, Nanking, V. No KAMKIN was a printer and

publisher in Shanghai and later was in charge of the Russian

Publishing House, known as Nashe ZNANIE. He was closely associated

with bernard so logard of the chinlt fross, who in turn was

associatod with alloged Soviet espionage agent Olga NAKVASIN.

According to the Staff C memorandum, a report from the FBI

dated l4 August 1953 indicated that a scurce of unknown reliability

stated that one Victor KAMKIN, who operated a book store as a

possible cover in tientsin, china, acted as a paid informer of

the Japanese during World War Il; and was a paid informer oî U. So
