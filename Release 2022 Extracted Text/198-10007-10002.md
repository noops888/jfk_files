CASTRO'S SUBVERSIVE
CAPABILITIES IN LATIN
AMERICA

THE PROBLEM

To describe and evaluate Castro’s capabilities, with Soviet nelp,
for carrying out subversion and sabotage in Latin America after
satisfaction of all US conditions relative to the withdrawal of
strategic weapons systems from Cuba and a consequent US com-
mitment not to invade.

NOTE: In this estimate we have considered Castro’s raw capabilities,
om taking note of, but not working out in detail, US and Latin
cr) American capabilities for counteraction.

SUMMARY

A. The dangerously unstable situation that prevails through-
out much of Latin America is the product of fundamental in-
* equities and historic circumstances; it is not the creation of ©
Castro and the Soviets. Castro’s efforts, with Soviet help. to
exploit this situation by means of subversion and sabotage save
not produced significant, results. Propaganda exploitatic:. «f
Castro and Cuba as symbols of revolution has probably beer: more
effective to date than other subversive activities. Castres’ in-
fluence in Latin America had waned by the time of the missile
base crisis and was further reduced by the revelation that he
had accepted Soviet strategic missile bases on Cuban soil and

by the manner of the Soviet decision to withdraw them.

B. Implementation of an agreement between the US anc. the
USSR whereby the strategic weapons systems would be with-
drawn and the US committed not to intervene in Cuba with force
will leave Castro with a new immunity and a greater freedom

<e SECRET

for subversive actions throughout Latin America. The extent
to which this potential is realized will depend upon the situation
in Cuba, Soviet policy toward Cuba, and the policies and perform-

.  Yespect to the Castro threat.. There are many targets
hemisphere vulnerable to Castro-Communist subversicn and‘sab-
otage, and the Soviets are likely to assist. Castro in reaching them
by contributing both to his security at home and to his capability
for action overseas. As in the period before the missile base
crisis, the effect of Castro’s subversive activities will depend not
only upon his capabilities but upon the attractiveness of the
Cuban example and the willingness of the American governments
to take determined counteraction. This willingness will probably
be weakened by fulfillment of the US commitment not to invade
Cuba.

C. We have examined how Castro’s subversive potential would

be affected by alternative courses of Soviet policy regarding Cuba:

(1) virtual withdrawal of support; (2) continuation of economic

and military support ranging from present up,to substantially

Cc increased levels. We believe that course (1) would considerably

reduce Castro’s subversive potential, and that the Soviets are

unlikely to elect it. We conclude that Soviet course (2) would

maintain Castro’s potential for subversive action at least at pres;

ent levels or actually raise it to the ‘point where he could under-

take amphibious and/or airborne subversive operations against
close-in. targets.

THE ESTIMATE

“1, CASTRO’S SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES BEFORE THE MISSILE BASE CRISIS *

Aims

1. From the time of his accession to power Fidel Castro has sought to
gain acceptance of the Cuban revolution as a model for others and of
‘himself as the leader of revolutionary forces throughout Latin America.
He has constantly sought to foment revolutions in other Latin American
States. Moreover, Castro has generally had the support of the Sino-
Soviet Bloc in the pursuit of these aims.

Means

2. Castro began. his career of sponsorship for revolutions in Latin
America in 1959 with landings of small rebel forces in Nicaragua, Pan-
ama, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti. None of these were successful
and he turned to other means.

3. From the beginning, propaganda has been one of the principal in-
struments on which Castro has relied. In addition to the main trans-

’ missions of Radio Havana for external listeners, which have had a great

deal of revolutionary content, he has beamed special programs devised

* to stimulate revolutionary action to each of half a dozen selected

countries.2 A major effort has been made through Prensa Latina, the
Cuban news service, to disseminate Castro-Communist propaganda.

_Printed propaganda has also been sent from Cuba into most other

Latin American States, and Cuban diplomatic missions and personnel
have actively disseminated it. Students returning from indoctrination
in Cuba have helped establish Cuban Institutes for Friendship among

~ Peoples which have functioned as propaganda outlets.

4, Thousands of Latin Americans have been brought to Cuba; about
1,200 foreign trainees are believed to be there now. Many hundreds
have been trained in revolutionary techniques and guerrilla warfare.
Cuba has been made a main transit point Loe travel between Latin
America and the Bloc. Haart

5. Financial support has been~ provided. by Cuba to revolutionary
groups in a number 1 of countries, although the cases on which we have
reports involved- relatively small sums of money. Arms shipments have
ee

f SECRET

also been reported, but the evidence is unclear as to quantities shipped
and the extent of Cuba’s role in thesé transactions. We believe that
there is an extensive agent net in Latin America directed from Havana.

6. Castro has associated himself with revolutionary activist groups
throughout Latin America. In most cases these have been Communist,
but where the regular Communist Party favored a legal or parliamen-
tary line he has not hesitated to support dissident Communist groups,
eg., in Brazil, and non-Communist revolutionaries, e.g., in Guatemala
and El Salvador. In some cases he has sponsored new revolutionary
organizations, e.g., in Panama, Colombia, and Peru. In Chile he has
endorsed a popular front coalition made up of Communist and moderate
leftists.

Evaluation

7. Instances of financial and material support sent by Cuba to revolu-
tionaries in other countries which have come to our attention are
probably only a part of the total effort. Even so, the effort seems to
have been relatively small and ineffective. Yet along with the political
and psychological stimuluswhich Castro’s influence has provided, Cuban

ais subversive activities have perceptibly strengthened activist revolutionary
Q groups. Dangerous situations subject to exploitation by Castro and
the Communists exist in a number of Latin American countries—

red notably Venezuela, Brazil, British Guiana, the Dominican Republic, and
Bolivia. These dangers arise from political and social tensions which
existed long before Castro came to power. They might lie dormant

/ for some time; but with Castro as a potential detonator, they are more
| likely to blow up. The detonative compound will exist as long as Cas-
| troism survives, whatever may happen to Castro personally.

: | 8. The most dangerous aspect of Castroism has been its broad appeal
} as a symbol of revolutionary change and nationalist assertiveness in
Latin America. Propaganda from Cuba has taken advantage of this

fact and has almost certainly been a more important influence in the

i Latin American situation than Castro’s other subversive activities.
| During 1960 and 1961 Castroism became a ‘force to be reckoned with q
politically in a number of Latin American countries. Certain govern- : i
ments felt obliged to move in the direction of neutralist and leftist posi- i
}

i tions. This influence waned, however, after Castro identified himself
i with the Bloc in late 1961. Nevertheless, the appeal to Castro’s move-
i ment continued to be a source of major concern to almost all govern-
ments and seriously restricted their willingness to associate themselves,
at least publicly, with the US.

AGREEMENT: UNDER WHICH THE SOVIETS WOULD WITHDRAW
* THEIR STRATEGIC MISSILES AND THE US GIVE ASSURANCES THAT
| “* [T WOULD NOT INVADE CUBA :

“9. Castro’s subversive capabilities—and his disposition to use them—
will be enhanced by the sense of security provided by such sophisticated
weapons as are retained in Cuba after the withdrawal of, Soviet strategic
missiles. The IL-28 bombers, if retained, and other modern equipment
noted in Annex B, would be important in this regard. A US commit-
ment not to invade Cuba will further strengthen his sense of immunity
from reprisal and almost certainly encourage him to intensify subver-
sive activities in other Latin American countries.

| Il. CASTRO'S SUBVERSIVE POTENTIAL IN THE AFTERMATH OF AN

Response of Castro Supporters to Missile Base Crisis

10. Castro’s supporters throughout Latin America, with few though
important exceptions (e.g., sabotage of oil facilities in Venezuela), failed
to respond to the missile base crisis with effective acts of sabotage or
with impressive public demonstrations. Two important limiting factors
should be taken into account in judging this response, however. US
action to alert Latin American governments led them to make extensive
advance preparation, including deployment of security forces and the
roundup of suspects, a condition’ of readiness which is unlikely to be
maintained indefinitely. There also may have been some uncertainty
= Re among the activist followers of Castro whether they should make their

a big effort in response to the announcement of the US blockade, or wait
toa for the anticipated US invasion. Moscow’s apparent failure to provide
guidance may have contributed to the confusion. It is our judgment,
however, that the response to Castro’s appeal for attacks on the US-
and its friends indicates that his power to command revolutionary
action, at least in the circumstances of the missile base crisis, is limited,

O

Support Which Castro Can Expect in the Future

11. The range of Castro’s support has been, we believe, considerably
narrowed by events since Castro declared himself a Communist.’ Rev-
vy "elation of the fact that he had allowed the Soviets to establish offensive
bases under exclusive Soviet control has alienated many non-Communist
nationalists, genuine neutralists, and even revolutionaries seeking social
and economic betterment. San Tiago Dantas, formerly Foreign Min-
ister under President Goulart and an author of Brazil’s nonalignment
policy, and leading Mexican officials have publicly expressed their
disenchantment.

12. The activist revolutionaries are probably the only important force
on which Castro can’now count, but even their support has apparently
been rendered less effective by differences on the question of Soviet rela-
tions with Castro and with Latin American Communist parties.

Castro’s Resources for Continued Subversive Activity

13. Arms. (See Annex B.) Castro has substantial stocks of arms.
In addition to Soviet Bloc materiel there are stores.of arms inherited
from the Batista regime not being used by Castro forces and available
for distribution outside Cuba. In the past he has apparently been ham-
pered in his efforts to use arms for subversive purposes by problems
of transport and delivery. He has at his disposal, however, 11 I-14
transports belonging to Cubana airlines which could be used to deliver
arms under certain circumstances. The IL-28’s now in Cuba are in-
appropriate for subversive purposes. However, they could be used for
air drops. Cuba has many small craft suitable for, infiltration of men
and arms. The 6 Khronshtadt subchasers, 16 P~6 motor torpedo boats,
and 12 Komar missile boats obtained from the Bloc could also bé used
for arms deliveries. If the projected trawler base is built up, trawlers—
both Cuban and Soviet—could be used for arms deliveries. If Soviet ;
submarines call at the trawler base or at other Cuban ports, they, too;
could be used in support of subversive activities. We see no evidence
that Cuba has or is- developing a sophisticated amphibious warfare
capability, and all the means of delivery of arms by sea noted above
would be vulnerable to precautionary measures by Latin American mil-
itary and naval forces.

14. Propaganda apparatus. Castro’s propaganda machine remains
intact. For-the time being, however, his diplomatic missions are likely
to find it harder to disseminate propaganda than in the past, both be-
cause of new precautions by local governments and because of a reduc-
tion-in the numbers of cooperative volunteers outside the organized
Communist’ groups: \

15. Money and equipment. Despite differences between Castro and
the USSR concerning dismantling of the missile bases, we believe that the
Soviets will continue to supply Castro with money, supplies, and equip-
ment for subversive activity. The Soviets have certainly supplied Castro
with sophisticated instruments of intelligence collection, sabotage, and
clandestine communications.

16. Organization. The organization of Castro’s subversive assets
throughout Latin America was shown by. the recent crisis to be loose
and otherwise faulty. We estimate that Castro will make a strong
effort to strengthen and improve it, and that he will continue to receive
support in this effort from the Soviet apparatus, both in Cuba itself,
where the Soviet Ambassador is a veteran officer of the KGB, and in
other important centers of Soviet activity such as Mexico City and
Montevideo. « :

Other Factors on Which Castro’s Subversive Capability Will Depend

17. If the US and USSR reach and implement the agreement stated
in the problem Castro will gain an immunity which he lacked before the ,
missile base crisis. He will, furthermore, still have most of the arms
and equipment which were delivered in the post-July buildup, as well -
as enhanced capabilities provided by accelerated training. Presumably
his enemies will have about the same, or less, freedom to engage in
propaganda, sabotage, support for resistance activities, and other actions
designed to overthrow Castro than they had before the crisis—almost
certainly not more. Unless Castro is gravely endangered by internal
political and economic. problems, there is no reason to believe that anti-
Castro activities-aré any more likely to jeopardize his position than they
did before” ‘the crisis.

eae “I. Situation in Cuba. Castro’s ability to engage in subversive activ-
Sate ities will be influenced significantly by thé strength and stability of his
ces position at home. Heightened political and economic difficulties in
Cuba would restrict Castro’s subversive effort, while the more secure
he is at home, the more freedom and strength he is likely to have for
subverting other governments and re-establishing his prestige and in-
fluence. Castro’s position in Cuba will depend in part on his own
policies, but is likely to depend even more upon those of the Soviets.

. Ge A 19. Alternative Soviet policies. There are several courses of action
with respect to Cuba which the Soviets are likely to consider. Some
leaders may argue that the whole policy of economic and military
support for Castro should be abandoned along with the plan for the
deployment of strategic missiles in Cuba. We believe, however, that
the Soviet stake in Cuba as an ally and as a Soviet center in Latin
America is still too high to abandon. The stake in Castro as a person,
however, is questionable. If the Soviets did make a decision to with-
draw support either from Castro or from Ciba; we bélieve that Cuban.
A éapability for subver: ersion,in Latin Am ‘America ca would” be greatly te Yéduced, at 7
an ees “= Jeast fora time. This capability would be reducéd more in the case of
“ “the Soviet withdrawing support from Cuba than in the case of their
abandonment of Castro alone.

20. An alternative course would be for the Soviets to continue to
extend economic and military assistance. Such assistance could range
all the way from the amounts necessary to maintain Cuba in its present
condition, incliding\ support of the expanded military establishment,
to substantial increases. Such a policy would probably reduce con-
siderably Castro’s internal problems and thus give him additional free-
dom to engage in external subversion and sabotage. Additions to Cas-
tro’s stocks of small arms would not in themselves change his capa-
bility for subversive activity, as he already has supplies of surplus arms.
However, if the Soviets were to provide substantial additional air and |

sealift capability, the Cubans would be able to mount large-scale
subversive interventions in neighboring countries. Furthermore, what-
ever degree of success is achieved in improving Cuba’s position and in
expanding its physical resources, Cuba’s net capability for subversion

and sabotage will in the last analysis largely be determined by the.

overall situation in Latin America.

21. We do not believe that Castro or the Soviets can yet foresee what
the effects of the recent crisis will be over the long term.on their rela-
tionship. The crisis has probably created difficulties of a political and
psychological nature that neither of them can readily solve, however
determined they may be to do so. Castro may have been moved by the
treatment he has received at the hands of the. Soviets to consider
modifying his relationship with them and seeking to improve his rela-
tions with the OAS and possibly even the US. We believe, however,
that he is unlikely to find feasible ways.of reducing his dependence
upon the USSR. The Soviets certainly must consider that they have
effective means of exercising control over Castro. Furthermore, his re-
peated assertions of continued loyalty to Marxism-Leninism make it
unlikely that he is seriously contemplating a restoration of relations
with the OAS, or that he could succeed if he tried.

22. Policy of other American nations. Castro's subversive capabilities
will be greatly influenced by the policies and actions of other Latin
American nations, as by those of the US. ‘We believe that the high
state of security alert that has prevailed since 22 October and the show
of unity that marked the recent crisis are unlikely to last. There is
sure to be a revival of nationalist sentiments. On balance, however,
we believe that the prospects for countersubversive action by Latin
American States, on their own and in conjunction with the US, are im-
proved. Many responsible Latin Americans will have interpreted recent
events to mean that firm. and united action can be effective against
the Soviet threat from Cuba. However, Latin American governments
will probably be less willing to take coordinated action against Com-

munist inroads if the US commits itself not to invade Cuba.

Likely Future Targets for Cuban Sabotage
23. The extent of Castro's capabilities for sabotage and other clan-
destine activity in Latin America will depend upon the complicated
factors noted above. Whatever his capabilities are, he will not be at
a loss for targets against which to use them. Some of the more obvious
targets are:
a. US missions and personnel. US missions and personnel all over
Latin. America were designated as targets for attack in the various
calls for action which went out during the recent crisis. Action against

SECRET

such targets has a primarily political and propaganda value to Castro
in that it tends to show public opposition to US policy. It is also rela-
tively easy for Castro to promote attacks against official US installations
in a crisis situation and to get help from all the various elements which
are opposed to American influence in the area. Future attacks may
be anticipated in situations in which Castro feels that the public resent-
ment of US policy exists or can be stirred up.

b. Physical targets vulnerable to a limited sabotage effort. Prime
targets for sabotage will be mining, industrial, and business installa-
tions in which there is a large proportion of US capital, which are other-
wise associated with the US, or which are so important to the local
economy that damage to them would create difficulties for govern-
ments which are anti-Castro and cooperating with the US. Oil facilities
in Venezuela, including the oil and water pipelines to the’refineries on
the Paraguana Peninsula, and similar facilities are likely to be chosen
as targets for Cuban sabotage. Installations for the handling of Vene-
zuelan iron ore are also likely objectives. US installations in Panama
might be attacked. |

c. Port and communications facilities are generally vulnerable to
sabotage and are appealing targets to Cubans and other Latin American
Communists particularly in countries which are cooperating with the
US and whose communications media.are taking an anti-Castro line.
Telephone, telegraph, radio and television facilities, and most public
utilities, particularly electric power and transformer stations, are poten-
tial targets. Selection of targets for sabotage will depend on the im-
portance of particular facilities but even more on the varying access of
Castroites and Communists to them.

d. Political targets susceptible to exploitation. Political instability
throughout Latin America, in almost every case characterized by pres-
sures from below upon relatively conservative and generally anti-
Communist governments, provide Castro with opportunities for sub-
versive political activity. Particularly unstable situations include the
following:

(1) Venezuela, where Communist-inspired disorders have been kept
in check by the government, but where continued Communist
and leftist violence may lead the military to take control.
In a country such as Venezuela, where the stability of an anti-
Castro and anti-Communist government depends heavily upon
one man, assassination is another danger.

(2) Nicaragua, where Communist-led groups, in anticipation of
coming elections, may seek to incite or exploit violence against
the Somoza regime.

(3) Guatemala, where President Ydigoras’ position is weak and
uncertain. . :

(4) The. Dominican Republic, where the problems of political recon-
_-—stfuction after a generation of dictatorship have proved almost
eee more than the caretaker government can handle, and where
a some political groupings amenable to Castro’s influence are ,
sete seeking to gain a footing.

(5) Bolivia, where the struggle for dominance within the ruling
MNR Party between the moderates and those on the far left
is ready-made for exploitation by Castro.

(6) Brazil, where Communists have penetrated the government
and military to some limited extent, the tide of nationalist and
anti-US feeling is strong, and depressed socio-economic condi-
tions and inefficient government administration provide Castro
many opportunities, especially in the northeast.

i. The World Peace Council (WPC) was expected to pay for the
C exoenses of the Continental Congress in Support of Cuba,

7 which is to be held in Rio de Janeiro from 28 to 30 March 1963,
according to comments made by General Luiz Gonzaga Leite,
president of the Society of Friends of Cuba (SAC), at a
meeting of the SAC on 21 January 1963.

2.° As of 21 January the SAC had not received any replies from
the invitations sent to the African nations to participate
in the congress. It was announced at the meeting that Valerio
Konder, acting president of the Brazilian Pro-Peace Movement
and a member of the SAC,was planning to go to Tanganyika to
attend the Third Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Conference
in early February and would take a copy of the convocation

i for the congress with hin.

3. Plans were made for painting slogans concerning the congress
5 all over the city and for placing large signboards along some
of the main parkways. The possibility was discussed of
persuading a well-known painter, such as Emiliano di Cavalcanti,
to paint a picture for the congress, which would be raffled
off for the benefit of the congress.

i

At a meeting of the SAC on 15 January a series of-.pro-Cuba

meetings, which would be held before the congress, was

planned. The possibility of inviting certain Brazilian

sts to perform at the meetings in order to attract a

arge crowd was discussed. The SAC was also trying to obtain

the signature of Dias Gomes, the theatrical producer, on the
convocation of the congress. Gomes planned to go on 19 January

5 to Cuba, where he was to direct a play.

OFFIC: USE_ONL

(Attachment to February 6, 1963 paper: "Current USIA Programs on Cuba")

The Voice of America broadcasts 8 3/4 hours in Spanish daily
to Latin America, of which 2 3/4 hours is tailored especially for
the Cuban audience. The transmission times of the Cuban hours are
6:00 to 7:00 a.m., and 10:00 to 11:45 p.m.

The "Appointment with Cuba" hour (10:00 to 11:00 p.m.) consists
of 15 minutes of news, followed by a five-minute commentary on some
development in the Cuban situation, a 30-minute Miami-produced package
(interviews with refugees, commentaries refuting the latest Caban
propaganda claims, excerpts of letters received from listeners inside
Cuba), and a ten-minute sports feature emphasizing the activities of
Cuban athletes in the U.S.

The 11:00 to 11:45 p.m. broadcast opens with 15 minutes of news
and is followed either by a half-hour dramatization or a 15-minute
news documentary and 15 minutes of features. A 150-installment series
of a soap-opera type adventure, featuring three brothers combatting
a Castro-like regime, was run at this time until recently. A new
series of this dramatization is now being produced under contract in
Miami with Cuban writers and actors and will soon be broadcast to Cuba
in the same time spot.

The 7:00 to 8:00 a.m. broadcast to Cuba also opens with 15 minutes
of world news and repeats the Miami package and features of the previous
night.

In the six hours of daily broadcasts to the general Latin American

., audience, which can also be heard in Cuba, the total material relating

to the Cuban situation averages approximately one hour. This consists
of commentaries, interviews with refugees, and news documentaries.

In addition to the short-wave broadcasts (relayed also to Cuba
on medium wave by two mobile transmitters), the main features on Cuba
are sent out as tapes to all USIS posts in Latin America for placement
with some 1500 local radio stations. The number-of listeners reached
by this means is many times greater than the shortwave audience.

The main themes emphasized in the Voice's Cuban programming are:
1). Castro's betrayal of a legitimate national revolution; 2) the sub-
servience of the Cuban regime to international communism; 3) the economic
failures of the regime, relating these to the pattern of communist failures
in the rest of the world; 4) the isolation of Cuba in the face of continental
solidarity opposing Cuba's alliance with the communist bloc; and 5) the U.S.
position that Cuba will one day be free. i |

7. The: FUAR seems to have been in a recess during recent months in

* the Cali area. In early November Luis Emiro Valencia, one of.
the leaders of the FUAR, was asked directly if there was any
truth to the story ci: ating in a. ad_given
him 50,000 dollars . He laughed and asserted the
amount mentioned in Bogota is only 30,000. He said his only
assistance from Cuba was a 1,000-dollar first prize in a literary
contest in 1959 or 1960 and two paid trips thereafter to
judge other literary contests. It is difficult to determine
the truth of Valencia's denial or the charges mentioned herein.
The Story has been circulating in Cali for approximately six
months and could be hearsay on the part of either Plata or
Zapata. It is noteworthy that Valencia has refused to espouse_-
common ideology with the PCC, except for Castro, which Valencia
ingists he wilt not accept if it is a tool of international “

are the fact that Cubs visitors employ many devious means in twavelling
‘to and from Cuba; some states deaire not. to infringe on the freedom of

travellers; and the difficulty of obtaining o useful exchange of intelli-

are young--ia their teens, twenties, and early

in some detail his experiences in.Guba

g this period, He was first approached by
gentine pro-Castro leader last June as to
whether he would be interested in taking courses
in Cuba on guerrilla warfare and "clty fighting.”
Aiter several days he agreed, With three ether
Argentines, none -6f them orthodox Cosimunists but
all of them radicals, he left Buenos Aires on a
about 1 July.. He traveled by way of Uruguay, - tie
Chile, Brazil; and Trinidad to Cuba. ‘in Chile,
the Cuban emhassy supplied him with travel money
and “complimentary visas” to enter Cuba, He ar=
rived sin Havana on 5 duly. ..During most of July

he had little to do as a group of about fifty
gradually collected at a-camp near Havana. They
eventually protested this lack of action and

were visited by Fidel Castro; who apparently camo

"to assure them that their program would shortly

get underway, On 30 July they began a series of
marches into the woods somewhere in the Organos
mountains in Pinar del Rio province under tho
command of two Cuban officers; Mest of’ his activity
between August and October seems to have boon cone
cerned with guerrilla training. Training with him
were 34 others, most if not all of them-apparéatily . -
Argentines.- There were political disputes among
them, particularly concérning the pro-Communiss
Argentine Peronist leader John William Cooke, a
political exile in Cuba who apparently had some

- degree of authority over the Argentine trainees

but who was resented. by them.

: ll. During the October crisis the entire

group “volunteered” to join the militia in defense
of the Cuban revolution "tareatened py Yankee ine

in “political economy" yaught by a Spaniard ‘named iz
"Guillen." -These classes were held daily for eight
cays untjI 5 November, when the ‘group was again

sent into the field for guerrilla training, They
engaged in firing practice, with various typos o”

‘weapons, including rifles and bazookas, On 14

November they were moved to a new area 2or a new

Cuban G-2 and taken to the Hotel Riviera, where they
later met Cooke. Cooke told them that it was necessary
to train expert guerrillas who could carry out the
revolution in Argentina. He insisted that General Juan
>* Peron knew about the training.

From the hotel the trainees were transferred to the Tabare
finca, behind the Buen Pastor Seminary.2 After several
! Weeks of inactivity they were visited on 20 July by
= Fidel Castro who promised that they would soon begin
“ their training. They were transferred the next day to

Rio; the march lasted about one month. .On 26 August the -....
41 men returned to Tabare.

On 3 September, the trainees were moved to a house called
"San Antonio," at kilometer no. 18, Arroyo Arenas,
Habana Province. The house had belonged to Celia Rosa .~

| Toucezt Masfera. From 28 August to 10 September, when

lasses began, training consisted mainly of Communist
films which they were taken to see several times. From
10 September to 14 November classes were held in the
following subjects: weapons.and explosives, ballistics,
communications, strategy, tactics, marksmanship,
sanitation, and closed and open drill. Manolo (lnu),

a Cuban, gave classes in explosives; Guillen (fnu)

. taught economics; Angel Martinez taught the class in

guerrilla tactics and strategy; ian unidentified mulatto
instructed the class in communications; a 17-year old
youth named Jose (1nu) taught marksmanship; and a man
known as "Cara de.Goma" (Rubber Face), a Cuban, served
aS political commissar. Weapon practices were made
with 22-calibre Mauser rifles, Garand rifles, Thompson
submachine guns, Browning and Husine rifles, bazookas,
and 8l-mm mortars. They also practiced with a 57-mm
recoilless cannon.

Alicia Eguren de Cooke, John William Cooke's wife,
visited the school at San Antonio; on one occasion She
told the students in a speech that they had to forget
Peron and Peronism since they had to organize a
guerrilla army, an Army of Liberation.

Qn 14 November the trainees were moved to "Las Mil Lomas
de Echeverria," five kilometers from the town of Pan de
Guajaibon (N 22-48, W 82-21), Pinar del Rio Province.
They dug trenches and individual foxholes and studied
mines and fuses, illumination with infrared rays, and
Bengal lights, and the construction of electrified and
simple wire entanglements. On 17 November, under the
direction of a Cuban lieutenant known as Manolo Nunez,
they carried out two sighting exercises. Later that “
day they carried out two more sighting exercises and
made a march with topographic maps of the area; the
march did not turn out well because of errors of calecu-
lation on the map. Daily training from 18 November
through 25 November was as, follows:

18 November ~ Rested and studied.

19 November - Made observations from a hillock,

studied, and made a scouting-type march.
*"" 20 November’ - Practiced defense exercises and fighting
from individual foxholes; explored and
located elements of a simulated barracks
in the hills, taking notes with regard
to an attack.

22 November - Studied plan of attack on the encamp-

.the woods.

23 November - Practiced hanging and taking down

hammocks; studied tactical manual.

"""" "94 November’ -"Practicéd security and emergency plan
of the encampment.

Hee Seedy 25 November - Studied tactical manual.”

On 26 November, during an exercise to practice security
on the march, the advance and rear guard groups got lost
in the woods. As a result there was criticism of poor
leadership, and the instructor ordered them to repeat

the operation. Several men refused; and the instructor
ordered that they not be given anything to eat. Because
of the order, the rest of the men refused to eat but
through argument and an appeal to the Revolution they {°,
were eventually persuaded to do so. i

4,8. Whilé they were studying on 27 November, Lt. Manolo
“Nunez arrived from Habana with news that the course
would be intensified because some of the group had a
fixed date for their departure from Cuba for Argentina.
During the day a conversation was overheard in which a
Trotskyite said that the Cuban Government ought not

to allow those who wanted to leave to do so since they |:
might be dangerous when they got to Argentina. The ~~
conversation was repeated to members of the Peronist
group, one of whom loaded a rifle, intending to shoot
the Trotskyite. The shooting was prevented but the
atmosphere was so tense that the two groups were ready
to fight. At that moment the lieutenant instructor
appeared and took away the rifles and ammunition; he
"immediately went to Habana to report the incident.

By night the five Trotskyites were separated from

their group.

ee)

On 29 November Cooke arrived and urged the immediate
withdrawal of the Peronists and the Vanguard Socialists
so that they could return to Argentina. That evening
the trainees left for Habana, where they were housed in
a residential building on Calle Septima. On 30 November
the trainees, because of their semi-abducted situation,
became’ very concerned and put on civilian clothes instead
of their military uniforms. On 1 December some of the
: . men left the housé, without permission, intending to take
ae a walk; they were told by Ulises (Inu), a Negro member
ke Soc th of G-2, that they could not go out without the permission
: of the Cuban Government. They said that they wished to
deal directly with the Cuban Government concerning their
ss) return home since they did not wish to have anything to
do with Cooke, who they thought was deceiving them.
Ulises immediately asked them for a written, personal
report, including 1) their regard for and opinion of
John William Cooke; 2) the type of work which they
desired to do when they arrived in Argentina; 3) their
. political affiliations; and 4) the impressions produced

Even after the reports were submitted the rule against
leaving the building continued in effect, so they then
talked with the political commissar who went to see
about the matter. When he returned he said that he
had not been able to put the case before higher
authorities.

On 6 December one Guidi (1nu),4 someone Cooke's wife"! °.
had met in Montevideo, took séveral of the trainees to
have their photos taken for the visa required for ~
leaving Cuba. The Vanguard Socialists refused to

go because of the man's connection with Cooke; they °'‘!
wished to deal with the Cuban representatives. When

one of the trainees who was taken to see Cook explained
his position, stating that he no longer would obey orders
from anyone but General Peron, Cooke replied that he
should be careful what he said, especially since the
Cuban Revolution had taken a turn toward the Chinese
policy in view of the behavior of the Soviet Union.

Guillen, the Spanish instructor, said that he had spent
an entire afternoon in the Albanian Embassy trying to
obtain aid for the Argentine guerrilla army.

During the period when the events described above took
place,®5 Hector Villalon, an emissary from General Peron, ,
arrived with instructions to demand the immediate. ~
departure from Cuba of all those who were studying in
the schools; in this ne was supported by the Vanguard
Socialists.

return home via Prague on 11 December. Themen, in i
some cases, were given two passports, one Cuban and ey
one Ecuadorean.” In Prague they were interviewed by, , .

Josef Hokes, former Czech Ambassador to Mexico, plays an

; ’ important role in Cuba's revolutionary activity in Latin
nearen America.+ He is allegedly connected in Peru with Hugo

f . Blanco, a revolutionary leader who lives in the mountains
ivi,, Of Cuzco,. to whom he has sent economic assistance and *

rie armaments. He is said to have carried out similar actions
for Alljo de Fleitas, a priest and guerrilla leader of

Brazil. :

5. Invasions are not contemplated as a part of the revolutionary
program in Latin America unless there are first internal up-

_. risings. These could: possibly be carried out, because
equipment for such uprisings is already stored in strategic
places. :

‘Hokes was present at a reception which the Czech Embassy in i
Habana gave for Fidel Castro and other Cuban officials.3 Among 4

i

those invited were Manuel Galich, of Guatemala, and Aleksandr
Ishkov, Minister of Fisheries of the USSR. :

‘Latin American leaders who wished to speak with Hokes in order
/<" sto obtain assistance were presented in Mexico by Natividad Rosales ~
-and Luis Suarez. a wos

8...Chinese leaders are~demanding that Cuba invade Guatemala, if
Nicaragua, El-Salvador, Costa Rica, and Puerto Rico, and
bombard-Panama. They are also demanding that Cuba issue
orders that the Communist and liberal soldiers in Venezuela

overthrow the government and take power, and that the
guerrilla organizations in Chile, Colombia, and Peru prepare
for the declaration of a general revolutionary strike. As for
‘Mexico, there they will only await an occasion when the military
supporters of General Lazaro Cardenas and other active groups
will take over power by means of a passive insurrection. :

Cardenas and his supporters would rely upon receiving decisive
‘assistance from the internal and external revolutionary
organizations resulting from the coalition of Communist and
ey revolutionary parties of Central America and Mexico which was
carried out in Mexico in August 1962 and in which the Mexican
y’ leaders exercised control and supervision through Arnoldo ‘
Martinez Verdugo, a member of the central committee and the
political commission of the Partido Comunista Mexicano (PCM, ai
q

Mexican Communist Party). The coalition is made up of the
PCM, the Partido Guatemalteco de Trabajadores (PGT, Guatemalan
Communist Party), the Partido Socialista de Nicaragua (PSN,
Nicaraguan Communist Party), the Vanguardia de Accion 3
Nacional (VAN, pro-Cuban revolutionary group), the Partido
Communista Salvadoreno (PSC, Salvadoran Communist Party), ;
Partido Comunista de Honduras (PCH, Communist Party of
Honduras), Partido de los.Trabajadores de Honduras. (PTH, t
Honduran Workers Party), and other leftist groups. The i
: administrative Secretary of the organization works in the
building of the Mexican-Czech Institute of Culture, at

coalition and relies upon the support of soldiers on active
duty and on the National Front of Liberation.

“10. The coalition has arms which were disembarked at Vera Cruz,

a Mexico, from the Soviet vessel TARKA (phonetic spelling)
during late September or early. October 1962, Arms have
also allegedly been unloaded, in accordance with the plans
referred to, somewhere along the coasts of Peru and Chile,
and possibly in Brazil, in spite of the fact that the
coalition did not include Argentina, Chile, Uruguay,
Paraguay, Bolivia and Brazil.

11. In addition to General Cardenas and the PCM, Mexican
‘.". organizations associated with the coalition include the | ;

Partido Obrero-Campesino Mexicano (POCM, Mexican Worker-
Peasant Party), the Federacion Obrera.Revolucionaria (FOR, -
Revolutionary Workers Federation), and the Movimiento
Revolucionario del Magisterio (MRM, Revolutionary Teachers
Movement); they have allegedly been organized into a
bee .permanent association at Calle Salvador No. 30-301,

Sy" Gatelligence organizations, a portion of whose personnel
also belong to this Communist conspiracy.

Headquarters Comments
“1,° Hokes left Mexico on 4 October 1962.

“9, Fleitas is probably identical with Alipio de Freitas, who
has made many speeches favoring revolution along Cuban lines

~ 3, Source did not provide the date of the reception; presumably
ay." at was in October 1962.

Suarez is probably identical with Luis Suarez Lopez,

naturalized Mexican of Spanish origin, who is a
Communist newspaperman,

Recently Portes Gil publicly denounced Cardenas and charged
that he 1s working for a foreign power.

All these questions (the 58) had three principal motives:

to know the future guerrilla fighter better; and, above all,
his needs and limitations for the struggle; and, generally,

his personal~problems and those of morale. Time given for
answering each question was unlimited. One of the possibilities

_is“that of introducing arms by smuggling, as, for example, in

the case or relatives who work on the borders, such as comrades
from Cuzco; also, in the case of Comrade Betancurt (pseudonym)
who is from the town.of Ayabaca, Piura, and who has facilities
for smuggling arms, since his community borders on Ecuador,
where large-scale smuggling of arms has developed. Also, the
experiences of soldiers, such as Vallejos, who have served in
such localities, show considerable practice in effecting such
contraband. 1+

“1, Source Comment. In the question regarding possibilities

of guerrilla warfare, the Cubans asked about possibilities
of supply by air--suitable drop-zones, etc. It is possible
that this questionnaire has been filled out by at least
100 Peruvians who have gone to Cuba. Among those who have
enlarged on these topics, the range is from lawyers down
to those who can barely write their names. Likewise, from
the interest they are showing in Peru, it is presumed that
many Cubans can introduce themselves into. the country,
passing as Mexicans or Panamanians, and set up profitable
businesses and commercial firms. One of those who presented
the questions had been in Brazil. The Cubans took two photos
of those in training, front and profile, in militia uniform,
but without eA

The FUAR seems te have been in a recess during recent months in
the Cali area. In early November Luis Emiro Valencia, one of
the leaders of the FUAR, was asked directly if there was any
truth to the story circulating in Cali that Castro had given
him 50,000 dollars to help FUAR. He laughed and asserted the
amount mentioned in Bogota is only 30,000. He said his only
assiszance from Cuba was a 1,00C-dollar first in a literary
in 1959 or 1960 and two paid trips therea
u iterary contests. It is difficult to det
he truth of Valencia's denial cr the charges mentioned herein.
fhe story has been circulating in Cali for approximately six
months and could be hearsay on the part of either Plata or
it is noteworthy that Valencia has refused to espouse
non ideology with the PCC, except for Castro, which Valencia
iasists he will not accept if it is a tool of international

allegedly were used by the Cuban Government 88 an opportunity to indoctrigate «
end train a number of Latin American students. Several Salvadorean athhetee
reportedly took no part in the games but spent their timo in training classes
for "Boctalist revolution" conducted by Cuban instructors. A number of
athletes fros other wepecified comtries followed the same schedule,

HQ OST commnrr: (C) (Gp-1) Such events es this competition supple-

ments the vast treining program conducted in Cuba. Many of the partici-
pants in the 1960 conference of the Commmist front World Federation
of Democratic Youth (WFDY) in Havana stayed behind to teke part in a
“work cemp" sponsored by the WRDY in the Cierra Miestras. Attendance
at such events may algo serve as cover for Party travel and other
personnel previously selected for specialized training. ‘The events
also served to promote the image of Cuba es a major regional Comamitst
stronghold. (SCIB, Vol XI, #2h, 28 November 1962)
