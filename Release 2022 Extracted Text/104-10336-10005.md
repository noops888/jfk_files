Re: Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board’s Requests for
dition: atic d Recor

Dear John:

Tam writing to follow-up on our telephone call earlier today and to convey my serious
concern about the status of CIA’s responses to the Review Board’s requests for
additional information and records. Although CIA has completed its responses to
several requests, and many others have been answered in part, a significant number of
requests have not been answered — including some that were made more than two
years ago. On many occasions we have been assured that responses would be
forthcoming, only to have promised dates come and go without answers. It is now
extremely important that these requests be answered promptly so that we may conduct
a proper follow-up if necessary. The issues that we can now identify as being of the
highest priority are identified in the text below by double asterisks (**)' and we request
that they be answered within the next month. We request that the remaining requests
be answered by April 1, 1998.

The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts: first, a listing of the formal
requests for information and records, and second, a listing of the informal requests for
information and records. Please let me know if your understanding of any of the
following points differs from ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies.

1As identified more fully below, the issues are: CLA-1 Organizational Material,
CIA-6 Cables and Dispatches, CIA-13 Backchannel Communications, CIA-IR-03
HTLINGUAL Documents, CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton Files, CIA-IR-07 Claude
Barnes Capehart, CIA-IR-15 Electronic “take” from Mexico City, CIA-IR-21 DRE
Monthly Operational Reports, CIA-IR-22 “A” Files on Clay Shaw and Jim Garrison.

Documents file: documents Nos. 496, 498, 499, 500, and 510. The Review Board
is awaiting confirmation that these documents are at HRG for processing.

CIA-IR-05 Possible Foreign Source for Records on Oswald.

CIA was informally requested to use its contacts to pursue certain records
related to Oswald that were orally described to CLA. The Review Board
understands that the CIA has taken steps to pursue these records.

CIA-IR-06 QKENCHANT.

The Review Board seeks information regarding the purpose of QKENCHANT
and its connection with Clay Shaw, Howard Hunt, and Monroe Sullivan.

The Review Board was initially provided some information in regard to this
request that now appears to be incorrect. CIA is now seeking additional
information to correct or to clarify its previous answers. The Review Board seeks
an immediate, full, and accurate formal response to this request. Once the formal
statement is provided, this request will be complete.

“*CIA-IR-07 Claude Barnes Capehart.

The ARRB staff has reviewed all records that CIA has been able to locate to date.
During the course of this review, additional questions were raised that CIA
agreed to pursue. CIA also agreed to conduct additional searches to determine
whether there may be additional retrievable records on Mr. Capehart. The
Review Board seeks a full and accurate formal response to this request. Once the
formal statement is provided, this request will be complete.

CIA-IR-08 Unredacted Copy of the “Family Jewels” Memoranda.

ARRB has reviewed a redacted version of the “Family Jewels.” Additional

. questions have been raised. At meeting between HRG, ARRB and the DCI/IRO
on December 11, 1997, specific redacted pages were identified for ARRB staff
review. These pages should be made available as soon as possible.

SUBJECT: (U) DO Response to Informal Request CIA IR #06

REFERENCE: (U) ARRB’s Memorandum dated 18 December 1997, -
RE: Status of CIA Responses to
Assassination Records Review Board's
Requests for Additional Information and
Records

(U) This memorandum is submitted in response to informal
request number 06 (CIA IR #06) from the Assassination Records
Review Board (ARRB).

**CIA-IR-06 QKENCHANT

a. (U) Per the Review Board’s request regarding the
purpose of QKENCHANT and its connection with Clay Shaw, Howard
Hunt, and Monroe Sullivan, the following information is
provided.

b. (S) QKENCHANT was a project for obtaining clearances,
that is, Provisional Covert Security Approvals (PCSA) and Covert
Security Approvals (CSA), with the Office of Security in
connection with the acquisition of Corporate Cover for Action >

CCAY} In connection with the acquisition of CCA} Directorate of
Operations guidelines require that a(PCSA/CSA be obtained in
most instances before a €orporatéjentity can be used as a (Cover)
(for Action (CEA) Sponsor.’

c. (U) With regard to Clay Shaw and his association with
the QKENCHANT project: A review of Shaw’s security file
indicates that he received a “five Agency” clearance on 23 March
1949. Our records indicate the QKENCHANT project did not begin
until sometime in 1952, therefore, Shaw in all probability was
not cleared by the QKENCHANT program.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Laura Denk
Executive Director, ARRB

FROM: © Jd. Barry Harrelson
JFK Project Officer, HRP/OIM

SUBJECT: CIA-IR-06, QKENCHANT

1. QKENCHANT was the name of an Agency project used to
provide security approvals on non-Agency personnel and
facilities. Such approvals were required so that Agency
personnel could meet individuals to discuss proposed
projects, activities, and possible relationships.

2. Clay Shaw received an initial “five agency”
clearance on 23 March 1949 and Agency records indicate the
QKENCHANT project did not begin until sometime in 1952.
Thus, in all probability he was not cleared by that program,
at least initially.

3. ffonroe Sullivan, Clay Shaw's boss, was granted a
security approval in December 1962.

4. With respect to Howard Hunt, following his
retirement from the Agency, he went to work with a company
which had previously cooperated with the Agency. Hunt was
granted a clearance so he could deal with administrative
matters in the absence of others within that company.

5. The Agency believes it has fully answered the
questions asked within this request and considers it

completed.
