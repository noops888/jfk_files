within the last six months, as a result of shopping habits
became in debt. Not wanting to advise her husband of this
situation, she approached JILLY RIZZO3 owner of Jilly's,
West 52nd Street, NYC, for a possible“source of funds. RIZZO
"steered her" to unknown shylocks from whom TREE borrowed
$1,000 at a usurious rate of interest.

In some unknown manner, TREE made contact with
CHARLES TOURINE, who interceded on her behalf with JILLY
RIZZO. RIZZO contacted the shylocks with whom TREE had been
involved and resolved the matter. TREE was subsequently
interviewed by Bureau Agents and would furnish no information
concerning this matter.

On 12/1/69, NY 5837-C-TE advised he has had several
discussions with CHARLIE THE BLADE TOURINE. TOURINE has asked
NY 5837-C-TE to lend out shylock money for him since he claims
| he cannot Ls eared get around to take care of his customers.
| He told NY 5837-C-TE that he wants two points and he (NY 5837-C-TE)
can keep anything above two points in shylock loans. The
informant told TOURINE that since he is a three time loser he
cannot afford to be put in a position where a shylgck victim
would make a complaint about him and it was agreed NY 5837-C-TE
would attempt to steer customers to TOURINE.
