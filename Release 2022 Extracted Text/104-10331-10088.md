Honorable Anthony Lake
Assistant to The fcesident for
National Security Affairs

The White House
Washington, D.C. 20500 :

Dear Mr. Lake: ee 3

No other ethic is as well-established and as
essential to the success of the intelligence community as
the procection of intelligence sources and methods ard the
Safeguarding of confidences. The effectiveness of the U.S.
Government’s intelligence and counterintelligence programs
is signiticantly attributable to the historical conmitmenc
by the agencies which conduct these activities to those
principles. Disclosure of the identacies of sources has
had and may be expected to have a profound effect upon the

- ability of the intelligence agencics to obtain the
confidential assistance of persons whose cooperation is
dependence upon assurance of continuing confidentiality.
Similarly, the disclosure of information about intelligence
sources and methods has caused and will predictably result
an the development of. countermeasures which will atfect the
ability of the United States to provide the, President with
simely and high-quality intelligence and detect and address
hostile intelligence activities directed against the
United States. 7 -

. Tae’ agencies represented hy the National Counter-
intelligence Policy Board unanimously share, and hereby
express, their concern that these fundamental principles could
be compromised by an inappropriate commitment te disclosure
by the Assassination Records Review Board (the Board) in

ics administration of the John F. Kennedy Assassination
Records Collection Act.of 1992 (the Act).

ANTBONY SEI TTT,

Honorable Anthony Laks

To date, the xesponse by the intelligence agencies --
to Board xequests for the release of documents has been 2
unprecedented. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), for
examole, has‘ released over 613,000 documents to the National
Archives ava Records Administration and has requested that cs
disclosure be postponed with respect Co portions of only 4.37
percent of those documents. The FBI has sought postponement
with respect to Limited portions of that modest number of ~*
records based upon expressed concezn by foreign governments
which contributed or originated the inlormation and reluctance
to reveal the identities of intelligence assets or intatligence
sources ang methods. ” Y

The Act pexmits the postponement of eisciosure upon
presentation of clear and convincing evidence that the threat
to the military defense, intelligence operations, or roreign
relatuons of the United States posed by public disclosure
outweighs the public interest in disclosure and that such
Gisclosure would reveal:

(A) an intelligence agent whose identity currentiy
requires protection: or

(B) an intelligence source cr method which is
currently utilized. or reasonably expected toa be
utilized, by the United States Government and which
has not been officially disclosed, the disclosure of
which would interfere with the conduct of intelligence
activities.

(See Act, Sections §(2) (A.3))

The Acct furcher permits the postponement of
@isclosure upon a Showing, by clear and convincing evidence,
that public disclosure would compromise the existence of an
understanding ef confidentiality currently requiring protection
between a government agent and a cooperating individual or a
foreign government, and public disclosuxe would be so hazaftul
that 1t outweighs the public interest. (See Act, Section 6(4)})

DRALT_LEITER TO ANTHONY LAKE, NATIONAL SHCURTTY COUNCIL

Honorable Anthony Lake

The Board‘s rejection of postponements proposed -
under these Sections of the Act dismisses the fact that the
intelligence agencies are uniquely qualified to assess the harm
to intelligence operations which would result from disclosure
of the identities of intelligence assets or revelations about
intelligence souxces and methods. it remains essential thac
the U.S. government stand by assurances. to persons and fareign ©
governments that information they provide on the basis of those
assurances will remain confidential for as long as is necessary
to protect those persons or govermments. [It is similarly
essential that sources, methods, and techniques which have
bad value in the past and could be expecced to have valug in
the future not be compromised. ‘fo requirs disclosure of the
identities of intelligence assets or revelation of sources .’
and methods, including the confidential cooperation of
foreign governments, would enervate U.S. intelligence and
counterintelligeance programs and discourage the confidential
cooperation on which the successful conduct of effective
intelligence is dependent. The intelligence community believes
that the harm which would result from such disclosures would
demonstrably impair the national security of the United States
and that the clear and convincing evidence standard doses acct
require that it divine, with absolure precision, the specific
manner in which that harm will arise.

The National Counterintellagence Policy Beard
xespectfully requests, thercfore, that these concerns be
brought to the attention of the Board and that the position
of the intelligence conmunity with respect to the disclosure
of intelligence asset identities and intelligence sources and
methods be considered in any Subsequent review of final
determinations by the Board.

Respectfully yours,

Nora Slatkin, Chairperson
National Counterintelligence
Policy Board
