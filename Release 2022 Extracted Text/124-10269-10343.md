Uponreceipt of the translations of the Chinese material

which is forwarded to the Bureau, as well as an evaluacion made

of the English language material, which is photostated, San

material which can be consürued as having intelligence value.

In manyinstances, San Francisco has kno:/ledge concerning the

identities of security subjects residing wionii ocher field

divisions and furnishes pertinent data concerning these indivaunis

Numerous requests are made by certain Chinese, scientists to {03:25
