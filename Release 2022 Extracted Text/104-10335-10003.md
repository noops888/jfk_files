RE: ARRB Additional Information Request No. CIA-4
Dear John:

To prepare for its July 17-18 Board Meeting, the ARRB will need to receive the Agency's “clear and
convincing evidence” in support of its postponement récommentdations. Accordingly, we would
appreciate your sending evidence including further information on CIA records currently under Board
review, including the names, pseudonyms, and crypts appearing on the attached list. In response,
please include short descriptions of each crypt, a brief identification of each individual (including what
that person was doing for the CIA in 1963-64, whether the name is a true name or a pseudonym), and
indications of whether these crypts, operations, and individuals are presently active or inactive. As we
have discussed, the Board in particular needs to know, in specific terms, what evidence CIA can
provide for those cases where release would endanger personal safety, ongoing intelligence operations,
or current foreign relations. Please focus your search on such information. To help with your search,
we have included document numbers where these names and crypts are found.

Please call me or Jeremy Gunn if you have any questions. We look forward to your response to this
request, by July 10, as well as to the results of your continued research into outstanding requests for
CIA-2 and CIA-3 prepared for the last Board meeting.

Sincerely yours,
