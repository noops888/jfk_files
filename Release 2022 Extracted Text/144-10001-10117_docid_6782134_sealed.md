EFFORTS STILL BEING MADE TO GET AMERICAN OUT OF CUBA :

Msg Nr: 18 *.

Your telegram Nr. 23((A)). : :

I have already intervened with the United States ‘Embassy
in Mexico City with regard to the person concerned, who is an
American and whose recards have beén shown to the Swiss Embassy
in Havana. . Since the a&sassinatior| of the President of the
United States, American Services have become extremely, rigid
and seem to appear more réticent regarding the American citizen,
a former officer, living in. Cuba, Mexican services will issue
a transit visa as soon as the American Embassy in Mexico City,
where the matter has been periding foramonth, makes the request.

I suggest an intervention ‘also: be made in Washington, I
shall see what I can do unofficially. .
