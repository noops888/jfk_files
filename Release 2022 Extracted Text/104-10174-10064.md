MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief/E/1B/S

SUBJECT:

Project WUBRIN& Possible Operational

Support of Madrid Station Objectives by

Edward G. TICHBORN (P)

REFERENCE:

OSMA 23, 350 Dated 1l January 1968

1. Per

request, the undersigned on 30 January 1968

discussed with Edward G. TIGHBORN (P) possible support of Madrid

Station objectives as raised in ref. It was confirmed that:

a.

WUSALINE

can be used as an information collection

mechanism in cases where information requirements can be couched

in plausible economic and commercial terms for contractual surveys.

b. TICHBORN can assess and develop selected Spanish contacte

of Madrid Station who may be visiting New York and who desire

introductions in US commercial circles.

C. TICHBORN can develop

in New York as may be

of operational interest to the Madrid Station. TIGHBORN has not

made an effort to develop

in New York but is willing and

able to do so for any designated as operational targets. If desired.

TICHBORN thinks he can meet the

through a friend

d. TIGHBORN feels that he could write an article concerning

leading Spanish industrialists and bankers for publishing in a pro-

minent publication, such as "Life International." TICHBORN

believes that he has excellent bonafides for such a task because

he previously published in "Life International" a four page spread

on birth control in Latin America. This article was favoradly

reviewed,

TICHBORN suggested a related article on the pupula-

tion explosion in Europe and its effect on business as a possible

topic for interviewing leading Spanish businessmen. TICHBORN.

as a result of journalistic collaboration with

Is represented in New York by a top literary agent,

TICHBORN thinks that it would take hix two

to three weeks in Spain Interviewing top Spanish industrialists

and bankers. He would send letters in advance to these targets

Informing them of his proposed itinerary, the purpose of his

trip, and enclosing copies of his previous articles with favor-

able reviewer commente. He could be essentially a free lance

journalist or have a business purpose as well. In the latter

connection, it is of interest that following TIGHBORN's trip to

Spain, WUBRINY/l sent a geologist to WUSALINE/Iberia to look

into acquisition of silver properties in Spain. This purely com-

mercial development appears to be a direct result of TICHBORN's

trip and thus enhances TICHBORN's commercial bonafides.

2. It is understood that E/IB/S has a copy of TICHBORN's report

for dispatch to the Madrid Station per ref.

3.

Personnel concerned with Project WUBRINY will be glad to

work with E/IB/S in any follow-up to the possibilities noted above.

8 November 1966

SERjECT: Information about Spaln (and Portugal)

1. I have a request which seems to me to be right up the alley

of your friend, WUBRINY/l, I would hope, therefore, that he will try

to do us a fairly rapid and yet analytic job.

2. The request is for as accurate information as possible on

the following questions:

What or who, or both, represent the most significant

power elements in the economic or commercial field in Spain

today? Wherever possible, even in the cases where potent

companies have been named, specific individuals having the

positions of authority should be identified. In addition, where-

ever possible, relationahips between these individuale and

American interests whether a company or another individual.

should be specified.

bo

What American interests, corporate or personal, have

major investments or holdings in Spain? What are the nature

of their Investments or holdings and who are the individuals

basically responsible?

c.

To the extent possible, provide the sanie answers a8

requested above for Portugal. Since Spain le of greater inters

est, this question should only be answered to the extent posaible

Without too great an expenditure of time. Il on the other hand it

is felt that good answers can be provided with regard to Portugal

given extra dme, I would suggest that the Spanish anawers bu

submitted a soon an possible and the Portuguese Information

given at a later data.

3.

I would appreclate it ll you could let me know as soon ad pos-

sible WUBRINY/l's reaction to the above requesto • can he got the anawers;

will they be in considerable detail and how long does ho think that it will take?

that he should not conceal the fact that he bad sone to

any possible embarsasing situations.) Tichborn (P) was

anxious to talk vith Nr. Mann and Mr. Paxton was attempting

a pain in the groin and was afreld thet he had a hernia.

2.

On the vay to the airport he asked me if thore would be anj

chance of the Government picking up his medical expenses in the eveat

that he actually had a herate which required any subatantial treatent:

I told him at that tice that I did not know what the Goverment's

position would be, but that I would check tato the matter and let his

know.

3:

On 2 February, I coatacted

SSA/DDS, and

explained the circumstances to bim.

that as far as the provisions of his contract vere concerned, it was

stated that be was not an employee of the U. S. Government and while

opined that although the contract stated ho was not an

employee of the U.S. Goverment, in actual fact during the period he

was doing our bidding, he was.

I went on further to explain to

Putwe services for us and that while he vas being paid, it was doubt-

ful that the reimbursement fron us equaled what he vould make t

his regular lay practice.

MEMORANDUM FOR THIS RECORD

SUBJECT: Edward G. Tichborn (P)

On the noming de la September I called Michborn and arranged

to meet bin at his office at 1230.

As an ettachment to this memo

I have outlined the standerd approach which was followed in Tichborn's

Instance; therefore, I will not go further into it.

2.

Tichbor struck me as being extremely quick, intelligent, very

sympathetic to my suggestions and andous to cooperate. Be is ar

Nexican descent, speaks Nexican/Spanish fluently and according to hin

can essily pass as a Medesn. Michbora has spent considerable time

over the yeach in Mexico as vell as attending the University af

Mexico for a year or tro. He bas also traveled to Cuba and is a

friend of

is personally known to me and

might, at sometime, be of use to us. I shall not delve into Michborn's

political history as that vill be outlined in his PRa. Part I when

it arrives.

• In the period of three hours that I was with Tirkborn,

as extremely impressed by kin and feel sure that he would do e

excellent joo of brieling any individuals that we might desire him

to brief.

Ian also sure that if he was sent out on a IDY he vould

acquit himself In superlor fashion. Michborn is called upon fron

time to time to give advice on the handling of Mexcen/American

problens and show the grest appreciation at the difficulties of

dealing with Latin Amertcans, their great sense of politicelmmorality.

their inferiority camplex and ul their unfound but nevertheless anti-

gringo feeltags. Tichborn vas particularly interested in the situation

In Cuba and asked my opinion of it.

My comment in essence was that

it seemed pretty obvious that Castro was extremaly emotional and

tended tovards being a dentget too had von the ver but was losing
