President DE GAULLE was the first foreign chief of state

to [decide to] participate personally in KENNEDY's funeral,

meeting with the new President JOHNSON, and has decided to visit

America in the spring of next year, etc., and the relationship

of both countries," which has been estranged, has taken a favorable
