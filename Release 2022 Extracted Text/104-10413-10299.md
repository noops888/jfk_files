has not provided coverage of the entire Soviet official
installation in Mexico City since 22 June 1960 when Projeot LIENVOY
assumed this responsibility. This freed LIFEAT to provide, with its
unilateral coverage, home phones of selected Soviet officials which
could better support not only the Station's CE effort but also other
Station operations against the Soviet target. In this effort, LIFEAT
covered the homes of four of the more active Soviet Intelligence
Officers stationed in Mexico during the reporting period. Samples
of the operational information provided by LIFEAT follows:

C. Yugoslav Coverage

LEFEAT coverage of the Yugoslav official installation in Mexico City
has provided a wealth of information on the contacts, activities, and
travel of members of that missien, Since the Station's effort against
this target was greatly increased within the last year, LIFEAT infor-
mation has been used extensively to provide the basic operational and
personality data necessary for this stepped-up program, Examples of
LIFEAT produced positive intelligence and general operational informa-
tion on this target are as follows:

During the reporting period LIFEAT coverage of the Cuban target was
directed toward the support of KUBARK operations in this field and was
not designed to provide positive intelligence, LIFEAT covered a total,
in direet support of operations in this field. Most of
the produet of this area of operation was forwarded by cable to JMWAVE
and Headquarters. Examples of pouch commmications in this field are:

E. American Commmnist Group in Mexico (ACGM)

As noted in past project reviews, most of the targets in this group
have been covered at the request of ODENVY, and the raw take has been
processed by them. During thepperiod July 1962 through May 1963
approximately 590 reels of take were passed to the local ODENVY for
their processing. On 23 August 1962 the local ODENVY advised, This
office feels the coverage mentioned is quite valuable and many useful
leads are obtained from this coverage, particularly with regard to
travel in and out of Mexico of American Commmists who are in contact
with individuals on whom coverage is maintained", Typical examples
ef reporting based on LIFEAT coverage of the ACGM are:

F. Exile and Revolutionary Activities

During the past year this area of activity, in additien to the already
noted Cuban coverage, accounted for the greatest percentage of the
LIFEAT effort. Most of the information provided by LIFEAT in its
eoverage of targets in this area was not available from other sources.
While Coverage has been provided on Spanish Republican, Guatemalan,
Coste Riean, and Niearaguen exiles, the bulk of this product has
Fesulted from the coverags of Juan Jose AREVAIO Bermejo and varicus of
his acquaintances, the "take" being forwarded to Headquarters and Station

Operational Support and Leads Provided other Station Operations

During the past project year LIPEAT continued actively supporting the
operations of Mexico City Station through the production of leads and
the providing of information on selected targets in the manner available
enly through the use of a unilateral telephone tap operation. Indeed,
it 1s in this area, secure support totthe Station's operations,. that .
LIFEAT is of greatest and unique value to the Station. The following
is a list of selected contributions by LIBEAP of cperational ¢

and leads provided te the various Station Case Officers and Station
operations as a whole:



13-00000

LIFEAT/Boviet: The valuable assistance whieh LIFEAT rendered Station
Bfforts in -this area was amply displayed in its support of Station
assets mounting a tecinical surveillance operation targeted against
the home of 2 known Soviet intelligence officer stationed in Mexico
City under official cover. LIVEAT information provided vital infor-
wation which enabled the Station to establish a pattern of action
of both the family of the Soviet officer and his maid. This infor-
made possible the setting of a time for the actual entry into
target, and contiming coverage (ineluding live monitoring of the
line immediately preceeding the operation) by LIFEAT made
possible a degree of security for this operation which would not have
peen possible without the support of a unilateral tap operation. ~
Further LIFEAT coverage has, in addition to giving information on
the daily activities and contacts of Soviet officials, provided an exe
cellent check:en the contacts of three KUBARK controlled double agents
with their Soviet Case Officers, This coveragehhas enabled the respon-

if

LIFEAT/Cuban: LIWEAT activities in this area were concerned primarily
with support to the AMSTRUT operation. Coverage of relatives of
-2 provided an excellent “window” into the operation which
enabled the responsible Case Officers to move with more certainty
and security in developing his operation, The Case Officers involved
Considered the LIFEAT coverage an essential check on the activities of

in ‘the Cuban area LIFEAT coverage of G-2 agent enabled the Station
to gain an insight into his contacts and activities, Further, recent

LIFEAT/Polish: LIPEAT continued its coverage in the BEKNAVE/EECHICK
operation. (See previous project renewal for background of this case
and the LIFEAT participation in it.) Of great interest to this operation
was LIFEAT information indicating that the wife of BEKNAVE had become —
ee
ment’ and travel plans of BEKMIVE.



13-00000

LIFEAT/Yigoslav: In addition to the usual information concerning
the Yugoslav officiais and their daily contacts and activities,
LIFEAT provided leads which could pay off in future operations.

One example was a lead which revealed that a diplomatic courier
would be travelling alone and taking 4 new travel route while
carrying an official pouch, With this early warning, the Station
was able to plan an operation to provide access to this correspon-
dence. Although Headquarters finally vetoed this particular oper-
ation, sufficient early warning was given by LIFEAT so that the
operation could have been carried out, Another example of this
type of lead was the data available from LIFEAT coverage that a

new location was being sought for the Yugoslav Embassy, and which
specific locations were under consideration. Armed with this informa-
tion the Station has been able to make a technical casing of one of
the prospective sites and obtain information necessary for entry into
the other sites,

LIFEAT/Exile: As noted previously, LIFEAT coverage of the exile
activities was the single major effort by: LIFEAT during the project
year, In particular, LIFEAT coverage of Juan Jose AREVALO Bermejo,
whieh ineluded lengthy periods of "live-monitoring”, on occasion
called for coverage of five lines. Cabled summaries of LIFEAT
information were provided Headquarters and Station Guatemala. It
ig believed that the importance of this LIFEAT coverage oan not be
stressed too mich. LIFEAT Coverage of a Costa Rican Commmist exile
resident in Mexico City has lead to a wealth of operational leads
MMBEAAing the discovery of this persen’s envolvement in a Commmist
funding mechanism, Also, LIFEAT was active in covering the Spanish
Republican exile comamity in Mexico City during the GPIDEAL visit
to Mexico, LiFEAT coverage in this case was considered necessary
to reveal immediately any renewal of an earlier planned attempt on
the life of an GDYOKE official by one group of the Republican Exiles,
Ultimately, LIFEAT revealed the departure from Mexico of two of the
ringleaders in the plot.

LIPEAP/CIAE: At Headquarters request LIFEAT was established
on @ former SMOTH agent whose past actions Some suspicion of
his present activities, Proguet from this line has revealed an effort
by a group of this individual's friends to discredit the senior ODACID
official in Mexico, Early warning by LIVRAT has made possible the
preparation. of counter action. (see HMMA-22364}. LIFEAT has also .
provided coverage of a suspected RIS support agent. This coverage
had provided the background material necessary for checking on the
activities of this suspect agent. Continuing LIFEAT reporting on the
American Commmist Group in Mexico (ACOM) has provided ODENVY with:
great quantities of information on activities of leftist friends of



13-00000

nm.

of the ACGM including their travel plans to Mexico and in some cases
Cuba, As noted in paragraph I, EB, above, the looal office of ODENVY
considers this coverage "quite valuable”, As abso noted in previous
renewals, LIFEAT ability to give the interested case officers a check
on active and former agents increases the security of present opera-
tions and provides greater security for long t«im assets who may have
been in contact with now terminated agents.

H, Conelusion

It is the opinion ef the Mexico City Station that the support provided
other Station operations, the CI/CE information and leads, and the
ability of the unilateral LIFEAT operation to cover sensitive targets
without revealing Station interest te the liaison forces, well justify
the expenditure of funds, time, personnel and security risk. As it has
been noted in the past, that evemmwith the Station's envolvement in the
parallel, but liaison-type LIENVOY operation, a change in attitude by
the present loos] government administretion or a change in government
-- @dministrations could end KUEARK participation ‘in: that’ liaison project.
For that reason, LIFEAT, in addition to maintaining its present heavy
coverage, must be available to once again undertake coverage of the
official Soviet and Czech official targets in Mexico City. Therefore, ._
LIFEAT's present orientation, thoughhtoward supporting Station operations
and CI/CE mission rather than toward targets which would provide positive
intelligence, leaves it readily available for recall inte the Soviet-
Czech coverage. It is the Station's firm opinion that the LIFEAT
Project provides a substantial ani vital contribution in fulfilment the
several pricrity objectives of the Station's Related Mission Directive.

Progress of the Operation

The objectives of the LIFEAT Project are of a contiming nature and
are therefore not considered for fulfillment during any given period of
time. For this reasen percentage figures as to completion of project
objectives camot. be dram. However, an indication of the coverage
provided in working toward fulfillment of the objectives can be noted
in. that approximately 12,500 pages of raw text were produced in the
period July 1961 through April 1963. LIFEAT has been in dafly opera-
tion during the review period with the average number of lines covered
per month being 18, and a high in Oetober 1962 of 2 lines covered,

ITI. Plenning for the Future

As was indteated at the time of the last project renewal, LIFEAT hopes
to remain uncommitted to coverages that require the expenditures of
a great portion of LIFEAT resources but provide coverage of but one
target...euch as Soviet Embassy coverage. It is added emphatically,
however, that should the need arise for LIFEAT to again assume such
responsibilities, it is fully able to do so, Until such time LIFEAT
will centime to enjoy greater flexibility in the employment of its
assets, especially in the areas in which the Station dees not wish

to reveal its interest or operations te the liaison forces involved
4n the LIERVOY operation.

Vv. Expenditures

Approval for renewal of Project LIFEAT was granted 8 August 1962 for
FY 1963 in the amount of $99,000.00. ‘he proposed budget for FY 1964

VI. Status of Commitments

There are no commitments other than those noted in the project outline
submitted herewith and in the individual contracts and oral agreements
(wemorande of oral agreements were forwarded as necessary) of the
verious LIFEAT personnel.

Even with the operational emphasis of the LIFEAT Project being
on Station operational support, it is thought significant to

PROJECT OUTLINE, PART I

Area of Operations

This operation is run from Mexico City Station and is concerned with targets
located within Mexico City.

Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide, unilaterally, daily information

on the activities of official foreign installations in Mexico and the personnel
thereof, as well as coverage of the activities of selected individuals and
groups in response to both Station needs and Headquarters requests, Presently,.
LIFEAT stresses flexibility of coverage with support of Station operations and
CIAE coverage receiving the greatest emphasis.

Background

Project LIFEAT was originated on 3 October 1960 as a unilateral telephone tap
operation, Aetual initiation of operations under this authority ocourred
on 18 Jamary 1951, and the operation has mm econtimoualy from thst date,
The project was opened with the installation of a single tap and has growm
in the past eleven years to coverage of as many as thirty lines in a given
month.

The LIFEAT Project is a unilateral operation completely independent from any
liaizon arrangement. It is staffed by KUBARK contract employees with the
majority of personnel being indigenous controlled agents.

During the past twelve years, Project LIPEAT has produced more than 97,000 -
(estimate) pages of operational and intelligence information in direst support
of Hexieo City Station's specific objectives, and contributed materially to
the intelligence gathering activities connected with the Soviet-Satellite
Bloo and more recently with the Cuban representatives in Mexico. In addition,
LIFEAT has been of considerable value in monitoring the activities of the
American Communist Group in Mexico (ACGM), as well as the activities of the
exile groups and local Cocmmnists.

With the LIENVOY's assumption of coverage of the Soviet and Czechoslovakian
official installations in July 1960, LIFEAT asssts were released from continuous
eoverage of these two targets, These assets were then employed in direat
support of Station operatiens—-a rele ideally suited for # unilateral operaticn.

directly envolved in LIFEAT type work. It had been originallly planned
to use LIERODE basehouse as the terminus for the LIFEAT/MKTRAP
technical operation targeted against the official LIERODE mission in
Mexieo City. LIFEUD-22 and 23 were to have been the basehousekeepers
for this operation, When it was found that the MKTRAP operation could
not be routed te this basehouse because of technical considerations,
the base was employed as a photosurveillance base targeted against
the LIERME mission. Since this operation is not connected with
LIFEAT operations or personnel, these two agents will no longer

be oarried under the LIFEAT project,

she was never recruited and this clearance was cancelled on 25
January 1963.

Contact and Communications

Daily contact is maintained between the Case Officer and the agents employed.
in the project, These contacts are made in a clandestine manner with varying
patterns established for car pickups, foot contacts, and emergency meetings.
Pre-arranged signals are employed in setting and accomplishing the meetings,
When heavy cr bulky material is to be passed, meetings are held at night.
Entrance te the basehouses by other than the basehousekeepers is made only

on the basis of strict necessity; sueh as need for equipment repaip installation
for new line coverages, or line coverage cut off.

As to agent recontact arrangements, there is little possibility that project
LIPEAT could continue to operate in its present form in the event Mexico would
become a “denied area” police state, It ts possible, however, that certain
of the presently employed agents could be converted to straight FI funbtions
or support agent roles. Recontact can be effected by mentioning that the
the agent is a friend of "Ingeniero Stanley” (title used

operational enviornment, and are reviewed periddically by both WILSTED end
the responsibile Case 6fficer and are updated as necessary,

Telephone contact concerning the projeet and with the agents is kept to a
minimum. Pre-arranged open code is used for phone senversations between
Case Officers and agents.

Security.

centrals have been removed by the central's workmen, but these are of no
danger to the operation unless a full investigation is made of one of

these unusual eonmmetions. During the past project year no such investigation
has been undertaken, and no suspicion of the LIFRAT linemen has been revealed
to date.

The greatest dangers faced by LIFEAT in the past year centered on two
developments: 1) the continued efforts of the telephone company toward moderni-
zation of the Mexileo City telephone system and 2) the investigation launched by
the Secretaria de COmmnicaeiones y Obras Publicas (SCOP) to determine if the
telephone company has not been providing maximm possible service to Hexico
City residents by holding from use certain "spare pairs" of every cable and —
distribution box.

In the first development (which has been in process for the past few years
and was so noted in past project renewals) the most noteable incidents which
effeot LIPEAT security are the installation of new underground cables re-
placing the old overhead telephone wires (thereby reducing access to target
lines and tap routing lines) and the institution of. a more efficient systen
"to keep’ track of daily assignments of the telephone company personnel Lerioned

in the telephone centrals. However, there is no way that the tap routing
line can be completely concealed when it is run from the terminal of the
telephone cable to the basehouse itself. With fewer legitimate overhead
wires to mask the presence of the tap lead-in lines, these lead-in lines
besome more readily noted in casual inspection by telephone company crews.

~ assignment in order to cut back the affected LIVEAP tap could cause serious
consequences, A number of ideas have been tried to bypass this problem but
as yet no satisfactery solution has been found. LIFEAT persomel are eontimuung
their attempts to negate this problem, too. -

As to the SCOP investigation, which is presently being pursued with more
vigor than is usually found in Mexican bureaucracy, the problem here is also
two-fold, First is the problem that the SCOP crews have authority to enter
any (and eventually all) telephone distribution box and check back an each
connection in these boxes to see if they are actually in use. On one occastinn
thsy have rung back.on a "spare pair” which was was in use by LIFEAT to route a
tap to a basehouse. Although no security: problem ensued itis an example

of the daily danger faced by LIFEAT in this case,

Another problem, and in the long run a greater danger to LIFEAT, is

the distinot possibility that SCOP will force the telephone company to

use the "spare pairs" for providing service to new subscribers. This

would eliminate LIFEAT use of these pairs to route tap lines to its
basehouses, in effect leaving LIFEAT with no way to get the tap from

the "cross" in the telephone central to the basehouse. Even the possibility

- of SCOP insiatance on only a reduction in the number of "spare pairs" held

from use by the telephone company could affect LIFEAT adversely, since this
would reduce the options LIVEAT has in routing its tap lines. However, until t
the investigation is completed, and no firm estimate of a target date is
presently known, the real danger of LIFEAT oan only be speculated upon.
LIFEUD-1 is alerted to obtain the recommendations of SCOP when given to

the telephone company and all efforts will be made by LIPZEAT personnel to
either negate or take advantage of any recommendations which are placed

inte practice,

It should be noted at this point that the LIFRAT operation could "blow"

of a large number of security dangers LIFEAT
faces in its daily operation as a unilateral effort. LIFEAT personnel are
trained and experienced in taking whatever action is necessary to negate
or lessen the damage amnecessary, but it is true that there can ocour a
situation which will "blow" the operation despite the best efforts.

Training

Initial training of new personne] and continuing refresher training for

the experienced personnel are handled primarily by the "outside" case officer,
David M. WILSTED. Minor repair and maintenance of equipment as well as
emergency security procedures are stressed and continually reviewed with

the

Equipment and Support

With the funds requested for this purpose in last approved project renewal,
LIBEAT audio and dial tape recorders were replaced during the past year,
Exeept for the usual problems discovered in equipment which has been
shipped for any distance, this new equipment has worked well since initial
use in the operation, It is believed that there will be no need to mirehase
additional large amounts of special equipment for some years in the future,

LIPEAT has been in continuous operation sinee its inception in January 1951,
and as a vital Station operational support asset, it is planned to contime
it indefinitely.

PROJECT LIVEAT
PROJECT OUTLINE, PART IT

18, Estimated Costs

The following are the estimated costs for Fiscal Year 1964, All figures
are U.S, dollars per year (US $1.00 equals 12.50 Mexican pesos). Changes
in estimated costs for particular items will be noted, These reflect not
only the continued inflationary trend in the Mexican economy, but also
the LIFEAT operational emphasis of support to Station operations. In this
latter oase particular line coverage is of shorter duration, causing
greater expense in installation and removal of tap lines and crosses and
frequent shifting of basehouse sites.

In the agent salary category total expense in contract agent salaries was
increased somewhat (due to raises granted DRABAND and

r during
> he past year) and reduced considerably in the field agent category {due

primarily to termination of three well paid agents.) Overall funds
requested for FY 1964 total $83,808 compared to $99,000 granted for use
an FY 1963 -- a reduction of $15,192. A great part of this reduction was
possible by programing newnew equipment purchases for the coming year
(see paragraph 16 above).
