I. Produet of the Project

A, Soviet Coverage

Erniest InTRAT, has not provided coverage of the entire Soviet offloial

Installation in Mordeo City since 22 June 1960 when Projeat LLENVOY

assumed this responsibility. This freed LIFRAT to provide, with 1ts

unilateral coverago, home phones of selected soviet offlolals which

could better support not only the Station's CB effort but also other

station operations against the sovlet target. In this effort, LIFEAT

covered the homes of four of the more aotive Soviet Intelligence

Officers stationed in Mexico during the reporting perlod. Samples

of the operational information provided by LIFFAT POlLONE:

C. Yugoslav Coverage

LIFEAT coverage of the Yugoslav offloial Installation In Merdeo City

has provided a wealth oi iniormation on the contacts,

activities, and

travel of members of that mission. Since the Station's effort agalnst

this target was greatly increased within the last year, LIFEAT InfOI-

mation has been used extensively to provide the basio operational and

personality data necessary for this stepped-up progran.

Examples of

IJFEAT produced positive Intelligence and general operational infarma-

thon on this target are as follous:

the providing of Information on selented targets in the manner avallable

only through the use of a unilateral telephone tap operation. Indeed,

It is in this area, seoure support totthe Station's operations,. that :

LeLFEAT/Soviet: The taluable assistance which LIFEAT rendered Statian

efforts in this area nas amply displayed in Its support of Station

assets mounting a tecinical surveillance operation targeted against

the home of a knon soviet Intelligence officer stationed In Mextoo

City under offleial cover. IliAT Information provided vital infor

mation which enabled the Station to establish a pattern of action

of both the fantly of the soviet officer and his maid. This infor

mation made possible the setting of a time for the actual entry into

the target, and contiming doverage (Indluding live manltoring of the

target line Immediately predeeding the operation) by LIFEAT made

possible a degree of security for this operation which would not have

been possible ulthout the support of a unilateral tap operation.

Further LIFRAT coverage has, in addition to glving Information on

the dally aotivitles and contaets of soviet offlelals, provided an exe

cellent cheat en the contacts of three KUBARK controlled double agents

with their Soviet Case Offloers, This coveragahhas enabled the respas-

sible Case Offloer to guide his operations with Increased assurance

that his agents continue to ba fully cooperative and under his control.

LTPRAT/Cubans LisAT sotivities in this ares were concerned primarily

with support to the AMSIRUT operation.

Coverage of relatives of

ANSIRUT-2 provided an excellent "windon" into the operation which

enabled the responstble tase offlors to move with more certainty

and seturity in developing his operation. The Case Officers involved

considored the ITILAT coverage an essential cheak on the sotivities of

the prinoipals in the case which was espeetally valuable during the

1n1t1al stages of the operatien. Travel plans of ANSIRUNi2 provided

by ITErAT vere also essential to the timing of the operation. AlBO

In the tuban ares lilai coverago of t2 agent enabled the station

to gain an insight into his contacts and aoltultles.. Further, recent

initiation of coverage of a Cuban Cameralal Off1o1al gives evidence

of produoing solid information of commercial transactions and MerLoan

Cameratal contacts of the Cuban Government.

LIFEAT/rigoslav: In addition to the usual information concerning

the Yugoslav offloials and their dally contaats and activities,

LIFEAT provided leads which could pay off in future operations.

One example was a lead which revealed that a diplonatio courier

would be travelling alone and taking a new travel route while

carrying an offlelal pouch. With this early warning, the station

was able to plan an operation to provide adoess to this correspon-

dence. Although Headquarters finally vetoed this partioular oper-

ation, sufficient early warning was given by LIfEAT so that the

operation could have been carried out. Another example of this

type of load was the date avallablo iron IliAT coverage that a

nen location was being sought for the Yugoslay Embassy, and which

spoolfio locations were under consideration. Armed with this informa-

ton the Station has been able to make a tacnical casing of one of

the prospective sites and obtain Information necessary for entry into

the other sites.

LIFEAT/Exiles As noted previously, IlIRAT coverago of the extlo

aotivitles.nas the.angle.major sffort by ITHAT during the projest

preparation of counter astion (see HMMA-21364). ILVRAT has also:

provided coverage of & suspeated RIS support agent: This coverage

had provided the background material necessary for abeaking on the

activities of this suspect agent. Contimuing LIFEAT reparting on the

American Commist Group in Madoo (ACCH) has provided ODENVY with

of the ACGM Including their travel plans to Mexico and in some cases

tuba.

As noted in paragraph 1. I. above, the looal office of ODiNVY

considers this coverage "quite valuable", As also noted in previous

renewals, IPEAT ability to glve the interested ease offleers a check

on astive and former agents Indreases the security of present opera-

tions and provides grester security for long tira assets uho may have

been in contact with now terminated agents.

H. Conclusion

It is the opinion of the Mextoo City Station that the support provided

other Station operations, the (1/CR Information and leads, and the

ability of the milateral IlFHAT operation to cover sensitive targets

without revealing Station Interest to the liaison forces, nell justify

the expenditure of funds, time, personel and security risk. As it has

been noted in the past, that evenith the station's envolvement in the

parallel, but l1afson-type LINVOY operation, a change in attitude by

the present lonal government administration or s change in government

diministrations could end Kulfik partialpation in that l1aison projeat.

For that reason, IliAT, in addition to maintaining Its present heavy

coverage, must be avallable to moe again undertare coverage of the

offloial Sortet and Crech offlelal targets in lexico City. Therefore,

INFEAT's present orientation, thoughhtonard supporting Station operations

and CI/CE mission rather than toward targets which nould provide positive

Intelligence, Jonvas 1t readily avallable for recall into the soviet

Gaaah coverage.

It is the station's firy opinion that the LIFEAT

projeot provides a substantial aid vital contribution in fulfilment the

several priority objeotives of the Station's Related Mission Direative.

I. There i8 attached a llst of the Hills produeed fron LIPAT provided

material during the perlod July 1962 through May 1963, as a by-produet

of the project's prime responsibility of providing support to Statior

operations.

II. Progress of the Operation

The objestives of the IliBAT Project are of a contiming nature and

are therefore not considered for fulffllment during any glven period of

time. For this reasen percentage figures as to completion of project

In that approximatoly 12,500 pages of ran text vera produced in the

period July 1961 through April 1963. WIFAT has been in dally opera-

tion during the revies period with the average number of lines covered

per month being 18, and a high in letober 1962 of 25 Ilnes covered.

III. Planning for the Future

As was indieated at the time of the last project renenal, LIFEAT hopes

to remain uncommitted to coverages that require the expenditures of

a great portion of LIFEAT resources but provide coverage of but one

target...such as Soviet Embassy coverage.

It 1s added emphatically,

however, that should the need arise for LIkkAT to again assume such

responslbilities, 1t 1s fully able to do s0. Untll such time INFEAT

w1ll conttmue to enjoy greater flexibility in the employment of 1ts

assets, especially in the areas in winich the station does not wish

to reveal 1ts interest or operations to the 11a1so1 farces Involved

in the lilitivox operation.

V. Expenditures

Approval for renewal of Project LIFFAT was granted 8 August 1962 POr

FY 1963 in the amount of $99,000.00. The proposed budget for FX 1964

1s broken down In the attached Fleld Projoct Outllne Renenal Request,

Part II, and tote18$83,408.

VI. Status of Commitments

There are no commitments other than those noted in the project outline

submitted herewith and in the individual contrasts and oral agreements

(memoranda of oral agreements were forwarded as nesessary) of the

PROJECI OUTLINE, PART I

1. Area of Operations

This operation 1s run from Nerdoo City Station and 1s concerned with targets

located within Mexico City.

2. Purpose

The purpose of this project 1s to provide, unilaterally, dally Information

an the aotivities of offlotal foreign Installations In Mexico and the personnel

thereof, as vell as coverage of the aotivities of soleoted individuals and

groups In response to both station needs and Hoadquarters raquests. Presently,.

LIFEAT stresses flexlbillty of coverage with support of Station operations and

CI/CE coverage receiving the greatest emphasis.

3.

Background

Project ITFRAT was originated

1 on 3 October 1950 as a unilatoral telephone tap

operation.

Actual Initiation of operations under this authority acouried

on 18 Janary 1951, and the operation has run contimuously front that date.

The project nas opened with the Installation of a single tap and has groun

In the past aleven years to coverage of as many as thirty lines in a elven

month.

The LIFEAT Project 1s a untlateral operation completaly Independent frou any

118180n atrangement.

It 18 staffed by KUBARK contract employees with the

majorIty of personnel boing indigenous controlled agenta.

During the past twelve years, Projoot ITTIAT has produced moro than 97,000

(estimato) pagos of operational and intolligenos Information 1n direst support

of Herdeo City Station's speciflo objectives, and contributed materially to

the Intelligence gathexing astivities conneoted with the soviet-üatelllte

B100 and more recently with the Cuban ropresentatives in Mexdeo. In addition,

INFIAT has been of considerable value in monitoring the astivitles of the

American Conminist Group in Mexio (ACIl), as vall as the antivitles of the

adle groups and looal Communists.

With the LlENVOY's aBsumption of coverage of the Soviet and Czechoslovaktan

official Installations In JUly 1960, LIPEAT AssetS MErA roleased Iron contimoas

coverage of these tho targets. These assets were then employed in direst

support of Station operations i role ideally sulted for & untlateral operation.

such as LIFIAT, and extremaly important to the security and susceas of Station

operations.

not be routed to this basehouse because of teahnioal considerations,

12. Contact and Communicatione

Dally contaot is maintained between the Case Offloer and the agents employed

In the project.

These contacts are made in & clandestine manner with varying

patterns established for ear plokups, foot contacts, and emergency meetings.

iro-arranged signals are employed in setting and accomplishing the meetings,

When heavy of bulky material 1s to be passed, meetings are held at night.

Entrance to the basehouses by other than the basehousekeepers 1s made only

on the basts of strict necessity, such as need for equipment rogali installation

for nen line coverages, or lina coverage cut off..

As to agent recontact arrangements, there 1s i1ttlo possibility that projeat

LEBAT could continue to operate in 1ts present form In the event Mexioo vould

bedone a "denied area" police stato. It Is posalble, borever, that certain

of the presently employed agents could be convezted to straight II funitions

person recontating the egant 1s a frlend of "Ingeniero Stanley" (title used

by David N. WIISTED wIth ITFEAT indiganous agents) and mentioning the IlFRAT

centrals have been removed by the central's workmen, but these are of no

danger to the operation unless a full Investigation 1s made of one of

these unusual somations. During the past project year no such investigation

has been undertaken, and no suspicion of the IlliAT Iinemen has been revealed

to dato.

The greatest dangers faced by LIFEAT in the past year centarad on tho

developments: 1)

the continued afforts of the telephone company toward moderni-

zation of the Mexted City telephone system and 2) the Investigation launched by

the Secretaria de Conuunloadiones y Obras Publieas (SCOP) to deterino 11 the

telephone company has not been providing nadmm possible service to Mexico

City Fenidents by holding frou use cortain "spare pairs" of every cable and,

distribation box.

In the first development (which has been in process for the past pen years

and was so noted in past project renewals) the most noteable inoidents which

effeot IliRAT seourity are the installation of new underground cables re-

placing the old overhead telephone wires (thereby reduoing access to target

lines and tap routing lines) and the institution of a more offlolent system

to keep track of datly assignments of the telephone company personnel (thereby

reduedag the nobility of the tro LIlIAT linemen and one centralmen) ""CrOBBes"

has managed to somewhat negate the first of these by making 1ts tap

in the telephone centrals. However, there is no way that the tap routing

line can be completely concealed when 1t 1s run fron the terminal of the

telephone sable to the basehouse 1tsolf. With fewer legitimate overhead

wires to mask the presence of the tap lead-in lines, there lead-in lines

become more readily noted in casual inspection by telephone company crens.

The liniting of the nobility of thairthAT linemen has not jet interferred

sertously with LIPRAT security or efficiency. Forever, in evant of a "flap"

situation, the dolay in gatting one of these Ilneman andy fron his nortal

"assignment in order to out back the afreeted hilli tap could cause serious

consequences. A number of ideas have been tried to bypass this problem but

as yet no satisfastory solution has been found. LIlIAT persomel are sontiming

their attempts to negate this problem, too.

As to the scoP investigstion, which 18 presently being pursued with more

vigor than 1s usually found in Mexlean burezuoracy, the problem here 1s also

two-fold. First is the problem that the SCOP orens have authority to enter

any (and eventually all) telephone distribution bax and check back on each

corneation in these baxes to see if they are aotually In Usa. On one oscaster

they have rung back on a "spare pal-" which was in use by IJlEAT to route a

tap to a basehouse.

Although no security problen ensued it '1s an axample

of the dally danger faced by LIlkAT in this sase.

Another problen, and in the long run a greater danger to IIFEAT, 18

the distinot possibility that scoP will force the telephone company to

This

would elminate IIFEAT use of these pairs to route tap lines to 1ts

basehouses, in effest leaving ITFEAT with no way to get the tap from

the "cross" in the telephone central to the basehouse.

Even the possibility

of SCOP insistance on only a reduction in the number of "spare pairs" held

from use by the telephone company could affect LIFEAT adversely, since this

would reduce the options IT'AT has in routing its tap lines. However, until t

the Investigation 1s completed, and no firm estimato of a target date 18

presently knom, the real danger of IlFEAT can only be speculated upon.

the telephone company and all efforts will be mado by IlEAT personnel to

trained and experienced in taking thatever action is necessary to negate

or lessen the damage annecessary, but 1t 1s tive that there can ocour a

situation which will "blow" the operation despite the best efforts.

15. Tralning

Inttial training of nen persomel and continuing refresher training for

the experienced personnel are handled primarily by the "outsido" case officer,

DavId M. WIIST:). Minor repair and maintenance of eguipment as nell as

energenoy seourity proceduras are streated and contimally reviered with

the agents.

16. Equipment and Support

With the funds requested for this purpose in last approved project reneral,

LIFEAT audio and dial tape rocorders were replaced during the past year.

Except for the usual problams discovered in equipment which has been

shipped for any distance, this new equipment has worked well since initial

use in the operation. It is balleved that there will be no need to purchase

additional largo anounts of special equipment for some years in the future,

provided that there 1s no radical shift necessary in the tap techniques:

presently employed in the operation.

17. Timetable

LaPEAT has been in continious operation since its Inception in January 1951,

and as a vital Station operational support asset, 1t 1s planned to continue

it indefinitely.

PROJECT LIFEAT

PROJECT OUTLINE, PART II

18. Estimated Costs

The following are the estimated costs for Fiscal Year 1964. All figures

are U.S, dollars per Jear (US $1.00 equals 12.50 Mexioan pesos). Changes

in estimated costs for particular items will be noted. These refleat not

only the continued inflationary trend in the Mexican economy, but also

the MIFBAT operational emphasis of support to Station operations. In this

latter case partioular line coverage 1s of shorter duration, causing

greater expense in installation and removal of tap lines and crosses and

frequent shifting of basehouse sites.

In the agent salary category total expense in contract agent salaries vas

increased somewhat (due to raises granted DRABAND and ZINSMEISTER during

the past joar) and redueed considerably in the fleld agent estegory faue

primarily to termination of three well paid agents.) Overall funde

requested for FY 1964 total $83,808 compared to $99,000 granted for use

1n FY 1963 - a reduction of $15,192. A great part of this reduction vas

possible by prograning norned equipment purchases for the coming year

(see paragraph 16 above).
