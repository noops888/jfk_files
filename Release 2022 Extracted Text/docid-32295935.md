: MARCELLO was convicted of violation of the Marijuana >
Tax Act in United States District Court, New Orleans, Louisiana,
October 29, 1938. He was sentenced to one year and one day
in the United States Penitentiary. MARCELLO's conviction was
based upon the sale of 634 ounces of marijuana December 6, 1937,
and 316% ounces of marijuana December 15, 1937, to GIEMORE
FAILOR, Agent, United States Narcotics Bureau, New Orleans,
Louisiana, :

MARCELLO has been the subject of innumerable suits
and appeals through the Immigration and Naturalization Service
and through the United.States. District Court and on May 3, 1955,
the United States & ‘the Court affirmed MARCELLO's deporta-
tion and on August -1955, he surrendered to the Immigration
and Naturalization Service,

On August 9, 1955, the Italian Consul, City of
New Orleans, requested the return of MARCELLO's. passport and
on December 16, 1955, Judge HUGO BLACK, United States Supreme
Court, ordered MARCELLO's release on $10,000 bond.

This bond has subsequently been reduced to a
parole agreement.

On February 7, 1958, informant RAYMOND ROLLING of
New Orleans furnished information that CARL NOLL had a
obtained citizenship papers (apparently birth certificate)
in CARLOS MARCELLO's true name MINACORE, in Guatemala.
(This information was disseminated to Immigration and
Naturalization Service March 21, 1958.)

J. MARVIN HOSTEPTER, Unilted ‘States Immigration and Naturali-
zation Service, Philadelphia’ Pennsylvania, and a copy. of
this report was furnished to New Orleans by Bureau letter
of February 9, 1960.

_ NOLL claimed that, through mutuSl TPiends in
[Seirorieans, Louisiana, he met one JUHIO M@RIDA, an employee
of the Consul General Office for Guatemala_in] New Orleans,
and, through this source, he became friendly with EDUARDO
RODRIGUEZ. GENIS, who was Ministro De Gubernacion and ANTONIO
VALADERES, Attorney for the Government of Guatemala. NOLL

H Contact should be established with the Immigration

FBetessa and Naturalization Service to determine if that Agency has

H interviewed or has considered interviewing of VALADERES and

qi GENIS in Guatemala. Immigration should also be contacted to

i determine if efforts have been made to locate the alleged

| _ birth records which may possibly exist in a village outside
: Guatemala City.

! From both Agencies, it should bepdetermined if the
bank records of the Banko De Nationale show that MARCELLO
| has transferred funds to Guatemala City.

“The State ‘Department should be contacted to deter-
mine if Article 13 offtpe-Eranco ~-Italian Consular Convention
of September 28, 18: 6 exits and if this Treaty would estab-
lish MARCELLO's It@isamecdgizenship.

The curretit status of the Civil Suit as it exists
in Italy should also be determined from the State Department
or from Bureau Leget of Rome, s

In view of the current importance of the investigation
of MARCELLO, the Bureau's Liaison Section is requested to deter-
| mine the Agency which will conduct investigation at Guatemala
! _ City and vicinity to either confirm or refute the. information
furnished by CARL NOLL. It is entirely possible that either
Immigration Service or the Narcotic Service has completed, or

is presently endeavoring to complete, this investigation and
before efforts are-made by the Bureau to obtain this informa-
tion, it is believed that above Agencies should be contacted
in order to prevent duplication of investigation efforts and
possible interference by the FBI in a matter which is primarily
within the jurisdiction of other Government Agencies. In the
event the other Agencies have not undertaken this phase of

the investigation of MARCELLO based upon information furnished
& NOLL, it is enala] to ob that Bureau reques €appropriate

sources in Guatemala]to obtain theJinformation outlined above.
