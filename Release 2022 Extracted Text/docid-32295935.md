MARCELLO was convicted of violation of the Marijuana'

Tax Act in United States District Court, New Orleans, Louisiana,

October 29, 1938.

He was sentenced to one year and one day

in the United States Penitentiary.

MARCELLO's conviction was

based upon the sale of 63 ounces

of marijuana December 6, 1937,

and 316z ounces of marijuana December 15, 1937, to GILMORE

FAILOR, Agent, United States Narcotics Bureau, New Orleans,

Louisiana.

MARCELLO has been the subject of innumerable suits

and appeals through the Immigration and Naturalization Service

and through the United states District Court and on May 3, 1955,

the United States supreme Court affirmed MARCELLO's deporta-

tion and on August 8, 1955, he surrendered to the immigration

and Naturalization Service.

On August 9, 1955, the Italian Consul, City of

New Orleans, requested the return of MARCELLO's passport and

on December 16, 1955, Judge HUGO BLACK, United States Supreme

Court, ordered MARCELLO's release on $10,000 bond.

This bond has subsequently been reduced to a

parole agreement.

On February 7, 1958, informant RAYMOND ROLLING Of

New Orleans furnished information that CARL NOLL had

obtained citizenship papers (apparently birth certificate).

in CARLOS MARCELLO's true name MINACORE, in Guatemala..

(This information was disseminated to Immigration and

Naturalization Service March 21, 1958.)

CARL IRVING NOLL -was interviewed by Investigator

J. MARVIN HOSTEPTER, United States Immigration and Naturali-

zation Service, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and a copy of

this report was furnished to New Orleans by Bureau letter

of February 9, 1960.

NOLL claimed that, through mutual friends in

New Orleans, Louisiana, he met one JUHIO MERIDA, an employee

hof the Consul General Office for Guatemala in New Orleans,

and,

through this source, he became friendly with EDUARDO

RODRIGUEZ GENIS, who was

Ministro De Gubernacion and ANTONIO

VALADERES, Attorney for the Government of Guatemala. NOLL

Contact should be established with the Immigration

and Naturalization Service to determine if that Agency has

interviewed or has considered interviewing of VALADERES and

GENIS in Guatemala.

Immigration should also be contacted to

determine if efforts have been made to locate the alleged

birth records which may possibly exist in a village outside

Guatemala City.

From both Agencies, it should be determined if the

bank records of the Banko De Nationale show that MARCELLO

has transferred funds to Guatemala City.

The State Department should be contacted to deter-

mine 1I Article 13 oi, che-franco - Italian Consular Convention

of September 28, 1896

exists and if this Treaty would estab-

lish MARCELLO's Italian catizenship.

The current status of the Civil Suit as it exists

in Italy should also be determined from the State Department

or from Bureau Leget of Rome.

In view of the current importance of the investigation

Of MARCELLO, the Bureau's Liaison Section is requested to deter-

mine the Agency which will conduct investigation at Guatemala

City and vicinity to either confirm or refute the information

furnished by CARL NOLL.

It is entirely possible that either

Immigration Service or

the Narcotic Service has completed, or

is presently endeavoring to complete, this investigation and

before efforts are made by the Bureau to obtain this informa-

tion, it is believed that above Agencies should be contacted

in order to prevent duplication of investigation efforts and

possible interference by the FBI in a matter which 1s primarily

within the jürisdiction of other Government Agencies.

In the

event the other Agencies have not undertaken this phase of

the investigation of MARCELLO based upon information furnished

By Nouu, It is recommended that the Bureau request appropriate

sources in Guatemala to obtain the rinformation outlinea above.
