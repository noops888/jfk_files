8: Gerald Patrick HemMiNg is well known to this Agency,

the Office of Security Miami Field Office, and JWAVE.

numerous occasions since at least. the early 1960's, HENMIN

ad clained Agency affiliation when in fact there has bee

none.

The most recent incident wherein HEMMING claimed such

affiliation was in May 1975 when he volunteered his services

to the Drug

Enforcement Administration.

Gerald Patrick HEMMING

is a long-time cohort of Frank Anthony STURGIS (SF#353 459),

aka:

long-tine record of

In

the late 1950's HENMING and STURGIS, both former U.S. Narines,

joined Fidel CASTRO in Cuba but returned shortly thereafter

claiming cisillusionnent with the CASTRO cause.

Soon thereafter,

STURGIS organized a group of mercenaries for Caribbean and

Central Anerican activities which he named the International

Anti-Communist Brigade.

A reported sub-unit of this

"Brigade"

(the backers of whom have never been fully established) was

named the Intercontinental Penetration Force, headed by Gerald

Patrick HEMMING.

9.

For an appreciation of the possible ramifications of

a Guatemalan government expose of this assassination plot

involving HENMING, you are referred to attachments to instant

memorandum, to wit: a memorandum by the writer dated 10 June

1975 in the name of Frank STURGIS and Everett Howard HUNT, JT.;

and an extract from a book published in early 1976 written by

The book Coup d'etat

in Anerica--The CIA and the Assassination of John F.

Kennedy

is a diatribe against the Agency and attempts to link the Agency

with the assassination of_President KENNEDY. One of the major -

links attempted by the authors is through Everett Howard HUNT,

JI. to Frank STURGIS to Gerald Patrick HEMMING to Loran Eugene

HALL.

Loran Eugene HALL was a member of HEMMING's Interconti-

nental Penetration Force.

Loran Eugene HALL received nationwide

publicity in 1967 when New Orleans District Attorney "Jim"

GARRISON alleged that HALL (and the Intercontinental Penetration

Force) was involved in the

assassination of President KENNEDY

another cohort, Robert K. BROWN, joined GARRISCN's investigation.
