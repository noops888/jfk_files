Shep "

Per our telecon I Dec, none of

the documents in the attached file:

are classified per se, because they

contain no indication that Kall or

his Army cover unit were associated

with the Agency.

Moreover, the

cover unit was dissolved in 1968.

However, Kail, like many other

military personnel assigned to the

Agency then and since, was on covert

detail at the tine (apparently 1962-

66), and this fact should be pro-

tected because of our cover arrange

ments with the Military.

Therefore,

recormend the Committee

be requested

to treat this file (and any other

Agency records cn Kail) as

-CONFIDENTIAL.

Ra

show this to HSCA.
