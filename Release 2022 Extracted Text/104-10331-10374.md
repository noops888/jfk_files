SUBJECT: JFK Board's Second Letter to the DC!

This note is corrected per comments by Barry Harrelson. Corrections are in first paragraph:

FYI, The JFK Assassination Records Review Board sent its second letter to the DCI on 31 July 1995. This letter notifies the DCI that it
has decided to release in full CIA documents considered during its July hearings. Two of these documents contain the.crypt "LIENVOY..”
This was the erypt for thdjoint CIA/Maxican foletap operation in Mexico City in 1963. This teltap picked up the Leo Harvey Oswald
telephone calls.

As with the previous letter, the Center for the Study of Intelligence has the action to get recommendations to the DCI on whether to
appeal to the President. | understand that John Pereira will discuss this with Fred Wickham (the DO focal point for these issues) whether
to pursue an appeal, | do not know what the DDO's recommendation will be.

During the hearing with the Board on 2 August 1995, we stressed the necessity to keep secret the fact the teltap operation was(a joint")
operation with Mexican liaisoy. The DO sought to-explain the mosaic problem to the Board on the release of LIENVOY. The Board's
position appears to be that release of the crypt when it will nt compromise the fact that the teltap was{aoint operation Should be
permitted under the Act. The Board probably will require us to justify on a document-by-document basis the redaction of LIENVOY, and
will not agree to redact every mention of the crypt. We should know by the end of the week what position the Board will take on the CIA
documents mentioning LIENVOY or talking about the operation. The DO officers at the hearing tried to get the Board to reconsider its
determination to release the crypt in the two'documents. However, the Staff of the Board does not believe the Board can or is inclined to
reconsider.
