DETAILS:

fon On 5/18/76 Mr. August Fipp, investigator for the Standards of
Official Conduct Committee of the House, interviewed you and me in your
office concerning the Bureau's handling of the first version of the final draft
report of the HSC, which version was received by INTD on 1/20/76.

Mr. Fipp was furnished the following information, which to the
best of my recollection was the way in which this was handled by INTD.

At approximately 5 p.m. on 1/20/76 SA Dalseg received from
Douglas Marvin, Special Assistant to the Attorney General, two copies of
the draft report. SA Dalseg furnished these two copies to then Assistant
Director Wannall who in turn appointed me to coordinate the review of the
report, which consisted of approximately 340 pages, for classified material

_ and any errors concerning information furnished by the Bureau to the HSC,

furnished to}Mr. Mitch Rogovin @t CIA. Based on Mr. Wannall's instructions,
each Section"Chief, INTD, was assigned approximately 50 pages to review.
SA Ryan was assigned the task of reviewing the Cointelpro portions of the
report and, as the report contained considerable information concerning the
U. S. Recording Company, the Inspection Division was requested to review
that portion of the report. Tom Hardy, a former informant handled by
General Investigative Division, had been interviewed by the Committee.
Accordingly, General Investigative Division was requested to review that
portion of the report. As former SA Arthur Murtagh had testified before
the Committee and made a number of allegations concerning the Bureau, a
portion of the report was referred to the Finance and Personnel Division
for review.

This dc to be accomplighed by 9 p.m. 1/20/76 and the results -

With the short deadline imposed, five Xerox copies of the report
‘were made making a total of seven copies of the report in the possession of
the INTD.:. These copies were handled as follows: one copy to Mr. Adams,
one copy to Mr. Wannall; one copy to you; one copy to IS-3, INTD; one copy
to Mr. Ryan; one copy split up for review by appropriate Sections of INTD;
and one copy split up for review by Inspection, General Investigative, and
Finance and Personnel Divisions.
