MEHORAHDUM FOR: Domestic Collection Ofviston

ATTERTION: Mr. Shaun P. Ryan
SUBJECT: Joseph R. HEROLA
REFERENCE: HH 25826, 8 January 1974

1. On 10 January 1974 the WH/2/GS desk received the
“referenced memorandum from the Domestic Collection Division
indicating the Miami field office had been in contact with one
Joseph R. NEROLA. MERULA had just returned from a business
trip to £1 Salvador; and he reported that a friend of his had
identified a Mr. Gremilifon in the Political Section of the
American Enbassy in San Salvador as a suspect CIA representative.
Headquarters traces on Joseph R. MEROLA indicated that on several
occasions fn the past MEROLA had claimed that he was a CIA
agent. The Chief of Station, the Hr. Gremillion referred to
above, was recently questioned regarding any Eabassy contact
with HEROLA while the latter was in San Salvador. The COS a
stated that both within the Embassy community and at social
functions MEROLA had frequently referred to his contact with
the CIA, past and present. He also volunteered this infor-
mation to a former Station contact

2. In light of the above, {t would appear that MEROLA
had taken advantage of his agency contacts in an inappropriate
manner to the potential embarrassment of the San Salvador
Station. We would, accordingly, appreciate. that this be given H
due consideration in your assessment of the advantage of your

continued contact with hia.
